Here are 10 things to know about the Hall of Famer and one of the greatest point guards ever to play the game. * * * Point God: Kidd is one of the most unique point guards in NBA history. He ranks second in both assists and steals and has the most rebounds ever by a guard. What separates him from others at the position is his deference when it comes to shooting and scoring. Kidd averaged only 12.6 points in his 19-year career, made just 4.5 shots per game and his field-goal percentage sits at a rather underwhelming 40 percent. However, Kidd has the third-longest consecutive playoff streak in NBA history at 17 seasons, trailing only Karl Malone and John Stockton, and single-handedly turned around franchises when he arrived. In short, Kidd managed to win games in spite of his reluctance to score. Richard Jefferson, one of his teammates with the Nets, said: \u201cI don\u2019t think in the history of the game there has ever been a guy to dominate more games without scoring.\u201d Jumper in progress: The quip among NBA people about Kidd in college is that he had an NBA body and a YMCA jump shot. And for the most part of his 19 seasons, that was true. Kidd was one of the best passers in basketball history (college and pro) but shooting was problematic. Yet late in his career, he developed a dependable jumper from decent range and even became a threat from deep. Kidd shot nearly 36 percent from 3-point range after he turned 30 and was even a volume 3-point shooter with the Mavericks, taking nearly five per game. Kidd now ranks 10th in NBA history on the list of 3-pointers made (1,988). \u201cHe went from a non shooter when he first entered the league to a tremendous three-point shooter,\u201d said Rod Thorn, the former Nets executive who traded for Kidd. Prep power: Kidd was a legend in high school and this was well before YouTube and the Internet. He was already 6-foot-4 and threw entertaining passes that sometimes bounced off the hands of unsuspecting teammates. Gary Payton, another Oakland legend, compared him to Joe Montana with a basketball and said Kidd was \u201cthe first LeBron\u201d in terms of generating buzz in high school. Payton personally \u201ctrained\u201d Kidd in summer pickup games and the Glove, five years older, was relentless in his critiques and defensive efforts against Kidd, who complained to his parents that Payton \u201cwouldn\u2019t let me score.\u201d The tough-love helped because Kidd led his high school to consecutive state titles and won national player of the year as a senior. St. Joseph\u2019s, a small Catholic school (600 students) in Alameda, had to move some of its home games to the Oakland Coliseum because the demand to watch Kidd was intense; his games drew 12,000 at the Coliseum, often outselling the Warriors. The school also sold Jason Kidd T-shirts for $10 each to benefit its athletic program and the shirts sold briskly. Double Dallas: Kidd had two stints with the Mavericks, the first when he began his NBA career and the second when his career was winding down. The Mavericks in 1994-95 were rebuilding with youth, namely Kidd, Jamal Mashburn and Jim Jackson, while the Mavericks of 2011 were loaded with such veterans as Dirk Nowitzki, Tyson Chandler and Jason Terry. Kidd was traded after his first three seasons in Dallas to Phoenix partly because of an inability to mesh with Jackson and Mashburn; his immaturity was cited. Ironically, the Mavericks craved Kidd in 2008 because of his maturity; by then, Kidd had a string of successful seasons with the Nets where he showed great leadership skills with an otherwise average team. Turnaround man: When Kidd was traded by the Suns to the Nets in 2001, he inherited a wayward franchise coming off a last-place finish in the Atlantic Division. Kidd\u2019s impact was immediate and the Nets had a 26-game improvement, still tied for the sixth-biggest turnaround in NBA history with the 2003-04 Nuggets with rookie Carmelo Anthony. The top-five in that category are the 1997-98 Spurs (36 wins) helped by Tim Duncan\u2019s addition, the David Robinson Spurs of 1989-90 (35), the Celtics of 1979-80 (32) with Larry Bird, the Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Bucks of 1969-70 (29 wins) and the 1988-89 Suns (27) and Kevin Johnson. Kidd improved the Mavericks (23 wins), Suns (16 wins) and Nets in his first seasons with those teams. Spurned the Spurs: In the summer of 2003, right after he took the Nets to the NBA Finals for the second time in as many years but came up short of a title, Kidd became an unrestricted free agent at age 30. And one of the teams that made him a high priority was the Spurs, coached by Gregg Popovich and who then had a 27-year-old Tim Duncan, Manu Ginobili and a point guard they drafted two years earlier named Tony Parker. Popovich felt Parker, while promising, lacked the seasoning and leadership of Kidd. Putting Kidd next to Duncan, Popovich felt, would potentially form a dynasty; Kidd had finished second to Duncan in the 2001 MVP voting. The Spurs flew Kidd and his wife Joumana to San Antonio, where they were met by the recently-retired David Robinson. However, within days after Kidd returned to New Jersey , he signed a six-year, $99 million deal to stay with the Nets. The reason? His wife, who dabbled in TV, wanted to stay in the New York area to further her career. The couple divorced four years later, Parker led the Spurs to three more titles and won the 2007 Finals MVP, Kidd and the Nets never made it past the second round again and he didn\u2019t win his first NBA title until 2011 with the Mavericks. Trade quirk: The trade that sent Kidd from the Nets to the Mavericks was actually done on the second attempt. The first try fizzled when one of the players involved in the deal, Devean George, invoked his early Bird Rights and couldn\u2019t be included. So the redone trade was made when Keith Van Horn, the former Nets forward who had retired, came out of retirement just to be included in the package to make the salaries work. Van Horn received $4.3 million for the trouble of filing paperwork twice \u2014 to un-retire, get traded, then retire again. Champion finally: In his third NBA Finals, Kidd finally struck gold, helping the Mavericks beat Miami in 2011 . In that championship run throughout the postseason, Kidd averaged 9 points, 7.3 assists, 4.5 rebounds and nearly two steals per game. But while the numbers were relatively mild, he did leave a historic mark: At 38, Kidd became the oldest starting point guard ever to lead his team to a championship. Tie game: The co-winners of the 1995 Rookie of the Year award were Kidd and Grant Hill. Their careers then took separate roads: Hill had the better start while Kidd the more productive finish. Hill in his first five seasons, all with the Pistons, averaged 22 points, seven rebounds and six assists. Then he struggled the rest of his career while mending from ankle surgery; Hill went seven straight years without playing a full 82 games (and missed an entire season) until he hit that mark with the Suns in 2008-09. Kidd, meanwhile, was on his third team when he arrived in New Jersey in 2001, but soon finished just behind Tim Duncan for the MVP award and led the Nets to a pair of Finals appearances. Both Hill and Kidd retired in June of 2013; Hill announced his retirement two days before Kidd. New coach: Just nine days after retiring as a player, Kidd was named coach of the Nets , now relocated to Brooklyn. It was only the third time in NBA history that a player became a head coach the season after retiring, joining Mike Dunleavy (Lakers) and Paul Silas (Rockets). The Nets wanted Phil Jackson but he declined. Kidd interviewed with GM Billy King, who said of Kidd: \u201cHe reminded me of Larry Brown\u201d and was hired after a strong recommendation by Mike Krzyzewski, who coached Kidd on Team USA. The reunion was highlighted by the Nets retiring Kidd\u2019s No. 5; Kidd played seven seasons with the franchise, reached a pair of Finals, was an All-Star in five and first team All-NBA in two. He owns the only retired NBA jersey by the Nets; the rest are from the ABA."},{"id":31601,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/wizards-hire-rod-thorn-adviser","date":"2019-10-01","title":"Wizards hire ex-NBA executive Rod Thorn as adviser","content":" WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Former NBA GM and league executive Rod Thorn has been hired by the Washington Wizards as a senior adviser to general manager Tommy Sheppard.

Whether seated on the opposing bench or on a stool in a sports bar, somebody is insisting that Harden must have traveled between the time he finished dribbling and launched his shot from a different spot. Traveling will be an emphasis this season for officials, who are determined not to allow offensive players to gain an extra edge by taking an extra step. Scoring stars like Harden already got an advantage once hand-checking on the perimeter was no longer legal, so they can\u2019t be given another one. \u201cIf we can\u2019t allow people to hand check, we can\u2019t allow them to travel because then they\u2019re almost unguardable,\u201d vice president of referee operations Mark Wunderlich said. That said, most times when Harden does his signature step-back, he doesn\u2019t travel. \u201cIt is legal, except for the fact that he gets a third step in every now and then when his rhythm is just off, which shows you the highlight of how difficult it is,\u201d said Monty McCutchen, the NBA\u2019s head of referee development and training. That\u2019s why referees are working harder to get it right. Critics of the NBA \u2014 and even some fans \u2014 have long sneered that the league doesn\u2019t call traveling. McCutchen said data showed officials were missing about two per game, but the way the game is played today can make those misses more penal for the defense. Players are bigger, faster and more skilled, and even big men who would have been centers in a previous generation are now do-everything forwards like 6-foot-11 Kia MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo. He already gets far enough with the two steps that are legal, forget when allowed a third. McCutchen compared the difference with Tiny Archibald, a 6-foot-1 guard who played in the 1970s and \u201980s. \u201cHe covered 10 feet with his two steps,\u201d McCutchen said. \u201cHow far is Giannis covering? The game has changed.\u201d So officials have begun to change with it, altering the way they were taught to officiate when McCutchen and Wunderlich were on the floor. Before, referees were trained to look first at the defensive player. Now they have reversed their sequencing, looking first at the offensive player\u2019s feet to make certain a legal pivot foot has been established and not changed. And the league added new language in the rule book to define the \u201cgather,\u201d to clarify how many steps a player can take after receiving the ball or completing his dribble. At the referees\u2019 preseason meetings and training camp last week, McCutchen said officials studied replays of three travels each time they returned from a break, and had a dedicated 45-minute session on traveling. An educational video was sent to teams , and the referees visited the coaches\u2019 preseason meetings, where they had a traveling station with two players on the floor so they could do demonstrations for the coaches. And Houston coach Mike D\u2019Antoni said the league stressed that Harden\u2019s step-back jumper is legal. \u201cThey made a point, which is great, to tell every head coach that is not traveling. It\u2019s not traveling,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said. \u201cSo hopefully coaches will quit complaining and hopefully you guys in the news will understand that that\u2019s not traveling. There\u2019s other points that we have to clean up that are traveling and the NBA is going to try to do a better job of that.\u201d San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich quipped last year that the step-back 3 came when players \u201cjump backwards and travel and shoot a 3.\u201d But the leaders of the referee team praised Harden for his cleverness and creativity. \u201cOn the dribble, we always talk about dribbling you can take two legal steps to the basket, right? No one ever thought about on the gather after you dribble you can take two legal steps backwards,\u201d Wunderlich said. Added Jason Phillips, who will oversee the Replay Center: \u201cThe rulebook doesn\u2019t state that the two steps have to be in any direction.\u201d Harden said it never should have been a debate, because if he was traveling then referees would have been whistling him for it. \u201cI\u2019m tired of hearing that\u2019s a travel, from coaches, from other players, from haters, fans, whatever you want to call it,\u201d Harden said. But he acknowledges it looks awkward, so the referees know they have to educate teams and fans just as much as themselves. There is no new rule or even a new interpretation of traveling, just a desire to correctly call the travels that are in the books. That\u2019s why it\u2019s the biggest emphasis on the preseason list of points of education. \u201cThe first one is traveling and the second one is traveling and the third, fourth and fifth one are traveling,\u201d McCutchen said. \u201cI\u2019m only joking to show that there are POEs and then there are POEs. We really want to get better at our fundamentals of the game and traveling is a big part of that.\u201d AP Sports Writer Kristie Rieken in Houston contributed to this report."},{"id":31580,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/chris-paul-happy-be-back-oklahoma-city","date":"2019-10-01","title":"Chris Paul excited about second stint in Oklahoma City","content":" OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) \u2014 Chris Paul is happy to be back where his professional career began. Paul started his career in Oklahoma City with the Hornets when they relocated after Hurricane Katrina in 2005. He was rookie of the year during the 2005-06 season, the first of two years he spent in Oklahoma City. Now he\u2019s 34, a nine-time All-Star who came back to where it all started by way of a trade that sent Thunder cornerstone Russell Westbrook to the Houston Rockets in exchange. Paul still has fond memories of the community that welcomed him to the NBA. \u201cThe people here, the fans here, make this city what it is,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy. Our life comes full circle. Now I have two kids. To bring them out here \u2014 they came out here this weekend to see me, them and my wife \u2014 it\u2019s cool to give them perspective because it changes.\u201d Paul, who averaged 15.6 points and 8.2 assists last season, said he holds no resentment toward the Rockets for trading him. He still feels he has plenty left to offer, and he looks forward to working with coach Billy Donovan and being a major piece of the rebuilt Thunder. \u201cI\u2019m excited,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s funny because a lot of people try to tell your truth, try to tell your story, say what you want and a lot of different kind of stuff. I\u2019m excited about the opportunity, excited about our team and excited about Billy.\u201d Here are some things to watch as the Thunder head into training camp Tuesday: Center Steven Adams had played his entire NBA career in Oklahoma City with Westbrook. He said it\u2019s a bit strange not having him around. \u201cIn terms of personal relationships, like it just affects that a little bit, you know,\u201d Adams said. \u201cStill going to be there, but you\u2019re thinking argh, I don\u2019t get to see them as often, you know. So obviously it\u2019s a bit tough, mate, but you know, you deal with it. Still above ground.\u201d Paul has a chance to mentor guards Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Dennis Schroder. Gilgeous-Alexander averaged 10.8 points and 3.3 assists as a rookie last season. He joined the Thunder in the deal that sent All-Star forward Paul George to the Los Angeles Clippers. Schroder is the top returning scorer after averaging 15.5 points last season. Donovan said all three could play together at times. \u201cI think that\u2019s what it comes down to,\u201d Donovan said. \u201cMultiple ball handlers down on the floor. You want to be able to incorporate all those guys so that they\u2019re flowing and playing together.\u201d Gilgeous-Alexander knows media expectations are low this season after the Thunder traded Westbrook and George. He\u2019s not focused on that. \u201cPersonally, I try not to worry about everything that the league or the media says in terms of things like tanking and things like that, expectations for us,\u201d he said. \u201cI think if we\u2019re focus on ourselves, try to get better every day, and play to the best of our ability the best we can, it\u2019ll take us where it takes us. Whether it be the playoffs, not the playoffs, finals run, never know.\u201d Adams\u2019 numbers could jump this season. The 7-foot center averaged 13.9 points and 9.5 rebounds last season while shooting nearly 60% from the field. He heard his name in trade talks this summer, but he\u2019s focused on what he can do this season. \u201cIt still affects you in some way. You know, because you\u2019re human, and you care,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you care about something \u2014 obviously I care about the organization here. But again, we\u2019re here because we\u2019re trying to support the organization itself, and the organization needs to do well, right? So you have to keep that in mind. You\u2019re just here to help.\u201d Forward Andre Roberson, one of the league\u2019s best perimeter defensive players, is expected to play in the preseason after missing the past 1 1\/2 seasons with a left knee injury. He said he learned a lot during his time away. \u201cA lot of ups and downs,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s taught me a lot about myself, about my body, just about the game in general and just kind of the effect on my life.

Critics have long complained that universities are getting rich off the backs of athletes \u2014 often, black athletes struggling to get by financially. \u201cOther college students with a talent, whether it be literature, music, or technological innovation, can monetize their skill and hard work,\u201d the governor said. \u201cStudent athletes, however, are prohibited from being compensated while their respective colleges and universities make millions, often at great risk to athletes\u2019 health, academics and professional careers.\u201d Newsom predicted other states will introduce similar legislation. The NCAA \u2014 which had called on him to veto the bill, arguing that it would destroy the distinction between amateurs and pros and give California an unfair recruiting advantage \u2014 said it is considering its next steps. It did not elaborate. In a statement, the NCAA said it is working to revise its rules on making money off a player\u2019s name and likeness. But it said any changes should be made at the national level through the NCAA, not through a patchwork of state laws. California\u2019s law applies to students at both public and private institutions \u2014 but not community colleges \u2014 in the nation\u2019s most populous state. While the measure covers all sports, the big money is in football and basketball. Student athletes won\u2019t get salaries. But under the law, they can\u2019t be stripped of their scholarships or kicked off the team if they sign endorsement deals. There are some limitations: Athletes can\u2019t enter into deals that conflict with their schools\u2019 existing contracts. For example, if your university has a contract with Nike, you can\u2019t sign with Under Armour. The law represents another instance of California jumping out in front of other states when it comes to social and political change. The movement to allow student athletes to profit from their labors on the court or the playing field has been simmering for years, portrayed as a matter of economic fairness and civil rights. \u201cA majority of these athletes, it\u2019s no secret, are African American,\u201d said Sen. Steven Bradford, a co-author of the bill who is black. \u201cIt\u2019s an issue of fairness, and it\u2019s an issue that has been long overdue.\u201d Newsom tweeted a video showing him signing the law during a special episode of HBO\u2019s \u201cThe Shop: Uninterrupted\u201d alongside NBA superstar LeBron James, one of many professional athletes who have endorsed the measure. James, whose 14-year-old son is a closely watched basketball prospect in Los Angeles and will be 18 when the law takes effect, exulted over its signing on Instagram, saying it will \u201cchange the lives for countless athletes who deserve it!\u201d He added: \u201cNCAA, you got the next move. We can solve this for everyone!\u201d NBA rookie Jordan Poole of the Golden State Warriors also welcomed the new law. Six months ago, as a player at the University of Michigan, he hit a game-winning shot at the buzzer in the second round of the NCAA tournament as millions watched on TV. \u201cI know for sure I would have been using my name after that Houston shot,\u201d he said. His teammate, three-time NBA champion Draymond Green, went further. \u201cThe NCAA is a dictatorship,\u201d the former Michigan State star told reporters Monday. \u201cI\u2019m tired of seeing people get ripped off, and I\u2019m tired of seeing these college athletes being ripped off.\u201d Before the governor signed the law, the NCAA threatened to bar California universities from competition, meaning powerhouses such as the University of Southern California, UCLA, Stanford and the University of California, Berkeley, could find themselves banned. If that were to happen, California schools could form a new governing body and get schools from like-minded states to join, in a threat to the NCAA\u2019s dominance. But the governor, a former college baseball player, said he doubts the NCAA would kick California schools out, arguing that the state\u2019s 40 million people and status as the world\u2019s fifth-largest economy make it too big to lose. The NCAA \u201ccan\u2019t afford to do that,\u201d he said. Democratic state Sen. Nancy Skinner, the bill\u2019s author, said it could especially help female athletes, who have limited opportunities for professional sports once they leave college. \u201cCollege is the primary time when the spotlight is on\u201d them, Skinner said. \u201cFor women, this might be the only time they could make any money.\u201d NCAA rules bar players from hiring agents. The NCAA has also steadfastly refused to pay players in most cases. But a committee is studying other ways players could make money. Its report is expected in October. The NCAA does let some athletes accept money in some instances. Tennis players can accept up to $10,000 in prize money per year, and Olympians can accept winnings from their competitions. Also, many schools pay players yearly cost-of-living stipends of $2,000 to $4,000. \u201cWe just kind of joked every kid is going to want to go to college out here in Cali now,\u201d Warriors forward Glenn Robinson III, who played college ball at Michigan, said of the new law. \u201cI think it\u2019s time. A lot of people are waking up and starting to see how much money that these universities are making off of players,\u201d he added. \u201cWhere I went to school, a lot of players couldn\u2019t afford lunch. * * * AP sports writer Janie McCauley contributed reporting from San Francisco."},{"id":31653,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/media-day-behind-scenes-2019","date":"2019-10-01","title":"Media Day 2019: Behind the scenes with NBA teams","content":" As Monday drew to a close, every team had completed their media day festivities for the 2019-20 season.

That\u2019s what coach Dwane Casey would like to avoid this season. \u201cI\u2019ve said too many times, being from Kentucky, we rode him like a cheap horse last year,\u201d Casey said at media day Monday. \u201cIf we didn\u2019t, I don\u2019t think we would have made the playoffs, because he was that special to us, but again, with addition of some other talented guys on our team, hopefully we don\u2019t have to use him as much. I\u2019m not going to put that in concrete, but I have to be smarter as far as the usage, because he takes a beating.\u201d Griffin averaged 35.0 minutes per game last season, his most since 2014-15, while also achieving the highest scoring average (24.5) of his career. He played 75 regular-season games, his most since 2013-14, but he missed two of the four games when the Pistons were swept by Milwaukee in the first round of the playoffs. Griffin ended up having arthroscopic surgery on his left knee, although he said that didn\u2019t cut into his offseason work too much. \u201cI sort of consider this summer a healthy summer,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cIt was kind of a four-to-six-week recovery. I think I was back on the court mid-June \u2014 so really only a couple weeks after I was last summer.\u201d Pistons executive Ed Stefanski said he expects the team\u2019s depth to be improved. \u201cNot to be disparaging about players that were here, but I think it\u2019s gotten considerably better when you put Derrick Rose in at that point guard position coming off the bench,\u201d Stefanski said. \u201cHe can move Reggie Jackson over to the two. Derrick had a terrific year last year. I think he averaged 17 points a game, on fairly limited minutes.\u201d The Pistons signed Rose and forward Markieff Morris. They also signed Joe Johnson, who did not play in the NBA last season. Stefanski says Johnson will be competing for the 15th roster spot. Stefanski acknowledged that big man Andre Drummond is eligible for a contract extension, but he didn\u2019t say much more. \u201cWe don\u2019t talk about contracts or negotiations,\u201d Stefanski said. \u201cWe really like Andre \u2014 the person and the player.\u201d Casey was hired by the Pistons before last season. He thinks the team got better offensively down the stretch. \u201cIf you look at our statistics as the season went on from February 1st to April 1st, our offensive output \u2014 we were far more efficient,\u201d Casey said. \u201cWe shot the ball better. We got the right shots, and as simple as it sounds, we made shots. I think we got used to the system that we implemented last year \u2014 the 3-point shooting system.\u201d"},{"id":31637,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/warriors-willie-cauley-stein-out-training-camp","date":"2019-10-01","title":"New Warriors center Willie Cauley-Stein sidelined for training camp","content":" SAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u2014 New Warriors big man Willie Cauley-Stein will be sidelined for training camp with a left foot injury, while Klay Thompson is making progress from a July 2 surgery for a torn left anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee but will be out at least until the All-Star break. General manager Bob Myers said at Monday\u2019s media day that Cauley-Stein strained his foot last week while scrimmaging. Cauley-Stein is scheduled to be reevaluated in about a month with an update on his status expected at the end of October. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing for him mostly, I know he was ready to go,\u201d Myers said at the new Chase Center, where the Warriors will begin training camp Tuesday. \u201cYou like to have new players get a chance to get acclimated in camp, so for him and obviously the coaches, myself, the whole organization, we want him to get back. The good news is he will be back. But camp is a formative time for him and his teammates. Nothing you can do, injuries are clearly a part of it. We want everybody to be healthy. Hopefully he\u2019ll be able to watch and pick up on some things without participating and stay as in shape as he possibly can.\u201d Thompson injured his knee in a Game 6 NBA Finals loss June 13 to Toronto that gave the Raptors their first NBA title. Thompson said since surgery, \u201cI\u2019ve made huge strides.\u201d Thompson said he will stick to the rehab plan and that it\u2019s not worth pushing too hard too soon at this stage. \u201cThe last thing you want to do is rush back, especially for a player like me who wants to play \u2019til his late 30s,\u201d Thompson said. The No. 6 pick in the 2015 draft, Cauley-Stein averaged 10.1 points and 6.4 rebounds with the Sacramento Kings last season. Cauley-Stein was on crutches and in a walking boot. He said it happened playing a pickup game. \u201cI went for a lob, came down awkward on it, put a lot of pressure on the top of my foot,\u201d he said. Golden State doesn\u2019t have its usual depth at center but re-signed Kevon Looney to a three-year contract and he will lead the way. \u201cKevon just keeps getting better, whether it\u2019s talked about or not he puts the work in,\u201d Stephen Curry said. Looney earned the bulk of the minutes at center during the postseason and even returned from a cartilage fracture in his right collarbone area before re-injuring it. Other center options for camp are Omari Spellman and Serbian forward Alen Smailagic, who played for the G-League Warriors last season. \u201cLooney is the starting center. Yeah, I\u2019ve got bigger plans for Looney anyway,\u201d coach Steve Kerr said. \u201cI think I\u2019ve told you guys that. He\u2019s one of our best players. He\u2019s moved up the ladder considerably with all of the losses that we\u2019ve had. So not only is he one of our best players but he\u2019s one of the guys who has the most experience and the feel that we need with this group to try to incorporate the young guys.\u201d When told once again he\u2019s the oldest player on the roster at age 31, Curry said emphatically, \u201cStop reminding me!\u201d The two-time MVP is eager for a new challenge, too. The rebuilt Warriors, with eight new players and minus several key veterans who keyed recent postseason runs, have reached five straight NBA Finals. But two-time Finals MVP Kevin Durant departed for the Brooklyn Nets this offseason. \u201cAs a team, for me, I\u2019ve just been thinking about how this building is going to create an opportunity for us to kind of walk into a new era, appreciating the accomplishments we have, the five Finals in a row, chasing more, all the things that we did in Oakland and at Oracle, but for all the new guys, we are going to be a different team and embrace that,\u201d Curry said. Kerr compared it to going into his first camp as coach in 2014-15. \u201cSo five years ago, when we were really brand new to each other and getting used to one another and getting the system kind of to the point where we felt comfortable with what we were doing,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cWe were experimenting with a lot of different things before we kind of settled on a rotation and how we were going to play, what our defense would look like exactly. I think that\u2019ll be a similar feel this year. We have a lot to experiment with, a lot of combination possibilities, so it\u2019s a really, really important camp, and I would say we will have to work much harder than we have had to the last four seasons because of the number of new players. We\u2019ve got a lot of work to do.\u201d"},{"id":31635,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/ap-gold-standards-nba-players-2020-olympics","date":"2019-10-01","title":"Gold standards: Many NBA players considering 2020 Olympics","content":" USA Basketball had a tough summer. The outlook for 2020 is already much brighter. Plenty of NBA standouts \u2014 elite names like Stephen Curry, James Harden, LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, Damian Lillard, Anthony Davis, Draymond Green and Paul George among them \u2014 are clearly intrigued by the notion of winning Olympic gold in Tokyo next summer. And that\u2019s thrilling to USA Basketball managing director Jerry Colangelo, who wasn\u2019t pleased by some players backing out of commitments and the Americans ultimately finishing only seventh at this summer\u2019s World Cup. \u201cIn some ways, it\u2019s what I expected \u2014 because I really, truly believed that the reason so many did not play this summer was because of the back-to-back competitions and FIBA moving the World Cup to a year before the Olympics,\u201d Colangelo said Monday. \u201cYou might have even projected it would work out that way. Obviously, what they\u2019re saying right now is appreciated.\u201d The Associated Press conducted an informal survey of possible U.S. Olympic candidates at their team media days, and of those approached none said they were not interested in playing in the Tokyo Games. Some issued stronger statements of interest than others, but playing for gold is clearly on the minds of many. Jimmy Butler, Klay Thompson and Andre Drummond all affirmed their interest at media days, as did plenty of others. \u201cDefinitely, I want to be able to play USA Basketball next summer,\u201d Washington guard Bradley Beal said Monday. \u201cI want to play in the Olympics. That was definitely a goal of mine. \u2026 If the opportunity presents itself then sure, that\u2019s an automatic yes for me.\u201d Curry, Thompson, Green and Lillard all openly expressed their interest in various interviews after the World Cup. At media days since, James, George, Leonard, Drummond, Harden, Aaron Gordon, Russell Westbrook and Devin Booker were among those who said they may want to play \u2014 health-permitting. \u201cI\u2019m actually kind of planning my wedding around it,\u201d Green said Monday at Warriors media day. \u201cSo hopefully I make the team.\u201d Gordon said his interest \u201cgoes without saying.\u201d And James wants to have a conversation with U.S. coach Gregg Popovich about the plan for 2020. \u201cWe\u2019ll see how I can do throughout this season, and I will address that at some point, and hopefully have an opportunity to have a conversation with Coach Pop and see what his direction is going forward with Team USA,\u201d James, a two-time gold medalist, replied when asked at Lakers media day last week if he may play in Tokyo. \u201cBut I will always bleed red, white and blue, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d There is a clear wait-and-see approach by some players, and obviously injuries or deep playoff runs would change some player availability. USA Basketball is expected to open its Olympic camp in early July, possibly two weeks or so after a potential Game 7 of the NBA Finals. That\u2019s part of the reason why Colangelo and Popovich don\u2019t intend to start formally recruiting for at least a couple more months. For now, they\u2019re listening \u2014 and liking what they hear. \u201cI would love to play in the Olympics,\u201d Drummond said at Detroit media day Monday. \u201cWho wouldn\u2019t want to play in the Olympics? That\u2019s definitely a big, big-time thing to be a part of. I\u2019ve been part of USA Basketball for a long time. \u2026 Playing for that gold medal is huge, so I would be very honored to play for them.\u201d There were many reasons why some players wouldn\u2019t or couldn\u2019t play this summer. Davis changed teams and wanted time to acclimate to the Lakers. Tobias Harris was dealing with a foot injury and just signed a $180 million contract with Philadelphia. James was filming a movie. Thompson and Kevin Durant \u2014 another potential 2020 candidate \u2014 got hurt in the NBA Finals. \u201cRepresenting your country, playing in the Olympics, all those things have been dreams of mine,\u201d Booker said at Phoenix\u2019s media day Monday. \u201cSo hopefully if I ever get the opportunity, I\u2019d take full advantage of it. \u2026 Representing the country with USA basketball is one of the most prestigious things you can do.\u201d USA Basketball cycled through more than 50 candidates before settling on a 12-player roster for this summer\u2019s World Cup, and only had to cut two players along the way. Everyone else pulled out for schedule or injury reasons. The expectation is that competition for the 12 Olympic spots will be more heated. \u201cAs long as I\u2019m healthy,\u201d George said at Clippers media day. \u201cWhen I get to that point and I\u2019m healthy, I\u2019m in. I want to be a part of that group.\u201d So do some of the players who were on this World Cup team \u2014 Sacramento\u2019s Harrison Barnes, Milwaukee\u2019s Khris Middleton, Boston\u2019s Kemba Walker, Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown, Brooklyn\u2019s Joe Harris and Utah\u2019s Donovan Mitchell are among those who said if Colangelo or Popovich call them again, they\u2019ll be ready to play. \u201cNo matter what the results were this summer, if I ever get the opportunity to represent my country, I will,\u201d Middleton said. The U.S. is bidding for a fourth straight Olympic gold medal next summer. If the Americans pull it off, it would be their longest run of consecutive Olympic golds since winning the inaugural seven tournaments from 1936 through 1968. July 2020 is a long way away, but there\u2019s clear reason for hope. \u201cIt\u2019s great to see that the response is what it is,\u201d Colangelo said. * * * AP Basketball Writer Brian Mahoney, AP Sports Writers Beth Harris, David Brandt, Dan Gelston, Noah Trister, Keith Jenkins, Janie McCauley, Kristie Rieken, Kyle Hightower, Greg Beacham and Josh Dubow, and Associated Press Writer Ian Quillen contributed to this story."},{"id":31628,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/sixers-joel-embiid-confident","date":"2019-09-30","title":"Embiid says Sixers have 'chance to win it all'","content":"Joel Embiid says the 76ers have a \u201cchance to win it all\u201d and he expects to be in the best shape of his career to try and make it happen.

(AP) \u2014 Free agency was only a few hours old when the New York Knicks acknowledged their fans\u2019 disappointment. Three months later, the Knicks have changed their tune. Not only was free agency a success, they say, but fans are going to forget about who the Knicks didn\u2019t get because they\u2019re going to love who they did. \u201cThese are guys that our fans are going to like, the toughness that they bring every day when they come to the court to play for the Knicks,\u201d team President Steve Mills said Monday. The Knicks signed seven new players in free agency, adding Julius Randle, Bobby Portis, Taj Gibson, Marcus Morris, Elfrid Payton, Wayne Ellington and Reggie Bullock. But by that time, Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving had already committed to Brooklyn in the early hours of free agency, and Mills released a statement that night saying he understood that fans could be disappointed but that the team remained confident in its plans. And though the Knicks had enough money to afford two top free agents, Mills said the team they ended up assembling was exactly the type of roster the front office targeted all along. \u201cSo we\u2019re excited about the group of guys that we have,\u201d Mills said. \u201cObviously based on the timeline and how we signed those guys it was clear they were on our radar and they were part of what we thought the future of the Knicks could be and what it should look like.\u201d It\u2019s certainly good enough, combined with No. 3 draft pick RJ Barrett, to improve on what was an NBA-low 17 wins last season. The physicality in the frontcourt and the shooting just about everywhere should exceed anything the 2018-19 Knicks could offer. \u201cI can tell you this: First and foremost, it\u2019s not going to be like last year,\u201d said Morris, who said the Knicks have a lot of \u201cdogs\u201d on the roster who won\u2019t back down from competition. The Knicks seem content to view themselves as a hard-working group of underdogs who together can overcome a lack of individual talent. \u201cThe fact that none of them has been heralded as superstars, they understand that they\u2019re going to need each other to win games,\u201d coach David Fizdale said. Other things of note from Knicks media day: OWNER ON BOARD Madison Square Garden chairman James Dolan predicted the Knicks were going to have a successful summer during a radio interview last season, which seemed to hint that the Knicks believed they would get some of the top talent that was available. But Mills said Dolan was aware of what the Knicks were planning and satisfied with the results. \u201cJim knew we were going to have a successful free agency period and we feel like we did that,\u201d Mills said. \u201cHe was on board with what we were doing.\u201d GETTING THE POINT The Knicks\u2019 most interesting roster situation in training camp could be at point guard, where Payton will compete with former lottery picks Dennis Smith Jr. and Frank Ntilikina. Smith came from Dallas last season in the trade for Kristaps Porzingis, and Ntilikina hopes to jump-start what\u2019s been a largely disappointing Knicks career after playing well for France when it beat the U.S. at the Basketball World Cup. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be a great battle,\u201d Fizdale said. \u201cI think they\u2019re all going to push each other. I think they\u2019re going to compete their butts off.\u201d INJURY UPDATES The Knicks said Bullock is making progress from a cervical disk herniation and will be re-evaluated in early November. They added that swingman Damyean Dotson likely won\u2019t play in the preseason because of a right shoulder injury but could be ready for the start of the season. ROOKIE\u2019S ROLE Barrett was the Knicks\u2019 highest draft pick since taking Hall of Famer Patrick Ewing with the No. 1 selection in 1985, but he won\u2019t walk right into a starting spot. Fizdale said the swingman from Duke will be treated like Kevin Knox, last season\u2019s first-round pick who had to earn his minutes. \u201cIt\u2019ll be the same but probably tougher on RJ because I think, again, this team is more talented,\u201d Fizdale said. \u201cI think we have more guys that he has to fight with to get those minutes, but I think the kid is up for it.\u201d EXPECTATION OF EFFORT The Knicks won\u2019t make any predictions for this season, beyond that their effort will be there whether or not the wins are. \u201cWe\u2019re a deep team so we\u2019re not going to do ourselves any justice by going out there and half going, not playing as hard as we can,\u201d Randle said."},{"id":31658,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/2019-media-day-roundup-eastern-conference","date":"2019-09-30","title":"2019 Media Day roundup: Eastern Conference","content":" The NBA preseason officially begins tonight ( 8 ET, NBA TV ) and the start of the 2019-20 NBA regular season is a little more than three weeks away . But before we get into all of that, it\u2019s media day for 23 teams across the NBA! As such, we\u2019re keeping tabs of all the moments, photos and more from Eastern teams in case you miss something. *  Western Conference Media Day coverage *  Team-by-team livestreaming media day schedule Late last season, John Wall wasn\u2019t sure if he would be able to suit up for the 2019-20 season. As the Washington Wizards opened media day on Monday, coach Scott Brooks made it clear the team is not looking to speed up the timeline for its All-Star guard to return. \u201cThere\u2019s a good chance he misses most of the season \u2014 if not all the season,\u201d Brook said, per Fred Katz of The Athletic . \u201cWe\u2019re gonna be patient. \u2026 He\u2019s not gonna play until he\u2019s ready 100 percent, and he understands that, but what I love about John is he\u2019s gonna fight us over it.\u201d Wall, for his part, isn\u2019t about to race back to the lineup unnecessarily, either. \u201cI\u2019m in no rush (to come back),\u201d Wall said, via Katz . \u201cOnly me can know how my body feels. \u201cIt\u2019s tough to just sit and watch, but my job is to make sure I\u2019m fully healthy and not compensating for anything when I do come back.\u201d Wall\u2019s absence leaves much of the Wizards\u2019 starting lineup in flux. All-Star guard Bradley Beal and big man Thomas Bryant are the only sure-fire starters for Washington once 2019-20 opens, per Brooks . Shoulder injuries have kept Markelle Fultz, the former No. 1 overall pick of the 2017 Draft, from steady playing time in the NBA. He\u2019s been limited to 33 games in his two seasons and, last season, was dealt by the Philadelphia 76ers to the Orlando Magic at the trade deadline. Fultz has put in a lot of work to recover from that injury and has his eyes on playing his first game with the Magic come this weekend. When asked at the team\u2019s media day if his goal was to play in the preseason opener on Saturday vs. the San Antonio Spurs, Fultz confirmed that was the case . His shoulder problems \u2013 first called a scapular muscle imbalance, a fancy way of saying the joints in the shoulder weren\u2019t working together properly \u2013 took him out of the lineup for the first time after just four games of his rookie season with Philadelphia. He missed 68 games that year before returning for the final few weeks. Fultz started Philadelphia\u2019s first 15 games last season before things went bad again. He double-clutched a free throw in a game at Miami and was widely mocked on social media afterward. Before long, he was diagnosed with a new problem \u2013 neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome, a condition where blood vessels or nerves around the collarbone and first rib are compressed. For the first eight seasons of his career, Kemba Walker was the face of the franchise for the Charlotte Hornets. He moved on over the summer, though, landing in Boston via a sign-and-trade deal. On Monday, he spoke with NBA TV\u2019s Kristen Ledlow on that transition, being a leader for the Celtics, his Team USA experience last month and more \u2026 In the offseason, the Charlotte Hornets said farewell to the Kemba Walker era as he went to the Boston Celtics via a sign-and-trade deal. In return, the Hornets got young point guard Terry Rozier from the Celtics, who has shown flashes of leading guard potential throughout his career. In his first comments as a Hornet, Rozier made it clear he wants to forge his own path with the team and not be compared to the player he is replacing. The Boston Celtics were a changed group in the offseason, saying goodbye to All-Stars Kyrie Irving and Al Horford as well as fan favorites like Aron Baynes, Marcus Morris, Terry Rozier and others. Gone, too, is a familiar look for one of the players still sporting a Boston uniform come 2019-20. Forward Jaylen Brown has parted with his trademark flattop hair cut in favor of a much shorter hairdo \u2026 "},{"id":31629,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/spoelstra-miami-heat-optimistic","date":"2019-09-30","title":"Erik Spoelstra, Heat heading into post-Dwyane Wade year with optimism","content":" MIAMI (AP) \u2014 Erik Spoelstra bounded into his first Miami Heat news conference of the season looking tanned and relaxed, the benefit of having nearly six months off. He\u2019s hoping next summer is much shorter. Even without the now-retired Dwyane Wade and after a season where Miami didn\u2019t make the playoffs, Spoelstra said Monday at Heat media day that there\u2019s no reason for his team to not see big opportunities this season. The Heat landed four-time All-Star Jimmy Butler in July, and go to camp starting Tuesday in West Palm Beach, Florida with Spoelstra insisting that his expectations will be at their usual lofty level. \u201cFeels good to be back,\u201d said Spoelstra, entering his 12th season as Heat coach. \u201cWe\u2019ve had plenty of time this offseason to reset, recalibrate and reorganize to get ready for this season. It\u2019s been 172 days. I think that is probably 70some days too many for this organization to have during the offseason. \u2026 We\u2019re excited. Feels like a new team, a new opportunity.\u201d There are new opportunities \u2014 and new challenges. The Heat are the NBA\u2019s only team to enter training camp without their three top scorers from last season \u2014 Josh Richardson (now in Philadelphia as part of the Butler trade) scored 1,209 points, Wade scored 1,083 and Hassan Whiteside (now in Portland, also via the four-team deal that landed Butler) scored 887. Miami returns basically half its scoring, 3-point shooting, rebounding, assists and shotblocking from last season. Clearly, Butler isn\u2019t going account for all those differences. So the Heat are counting on guards Dion Waiters and rookie Tyler Herro to fill some of the shooting gaps, betting center Bam Adebayo\u2019s numbers rise with additional minutes and hoping point guard Goran Dragic can be healthy for more than 36 games this season. \u201cOur camps are for competitors only,\u201d Spoelstra said. \u201cThere are opportunities. But ultimately, this is about winning \u2014 and how can you contribute to winning.\u201d Spoelstra was amused by Butler\u2019s telling of the story last week about how when he was in Chicago he hated the Heat. Turns out, in the first five minutes of their first dinner together this summer after the deal got done, Spoelstra told Butler that the Heat hated going against him then as well. Bonds started to immediately form. \u201cI like that our shootarounds are what they are supposed to be, you breaking a sweat,\u201d Butler said. \u201cI like that we compete in practice every single day. I like that every time we step onto this court, there is a certain way you have to look, there is a certain mentality you have to have. It\u2019s never like you just step on here just to go through the motions.\u201d Spoelstra\u2019s team shares his level of preseason optimism, even knowing there are tons of questions to answer such as who\u2019ll start at the point (Goran Dragic or Justise Winslow), who\u2019ll make up the closing lineup and who emerges as the next options after Butler. \u201cThe sky\u2019s really the limit with this team,\u201d Heat forward Kelly Olynyk said. \u201cWe have a lot of pieces to a puzzle and I think our pieces are going to fit together the best they have since I\u2019ve been here. I think that\u2019s something you can\u2019t take for granted.\u201d Here\u2019s some of what to know going into Heat camp: SCHEDULE Miami is planning two-a-day practice sessions for each of the first four days of training camp, and isn\u2019t scheduled to have a day off until Oct. 10 \u2014 following a back-to-back against San Antonio and Charlotte to open its preseason slate. TWO-WAYS The Heat have six players in camp on what\u2019s called Exhibit 10 (one-year, non-guaranteed) contracts, and two of them will likely be converted into two-way deals before the season begins. Among top candidates: former Miami Hurricanes standout Davon Reed and former Kentucky guard Mychal Mulder \u2014 one of Adebayo\u2019s college roommates. SWEET 17 Udonis Haslem is back for his 17th season in Miami. He\u2019s already had 130 different Heat teammates in his career, not counting the new faces that will make their first Miami appearances this season like Butler, Herro and Meyers Leonard. HEALTH All Heat players should be ready to practice Tuesday except Olynyk, who has a bone bruise in his knee that he thinks may take a couple more weeks. Olynyk believes he can still play at least one preseason game. Olynyk got hurt while playing for Team Canada this summer, and said he would like to play for his country again in 2020 during the Olympic qualifying tournament. THE ROOKIE Herro, the No. 13 overall draft pick, said he\u2019s benefited from spending a lot of time with Butler this summer. \u201cFor him to take me under his wing early on just means a lot to me,\u201d Herro said."},{"id":31607,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-russell-westbrook-out-preseason-opener","date":"2019-09-30","title":"Report: Russell Westbrook to miss Rockets' preseason opener","content":" Tonight on NBA TV:  Shanghai Sharks vs. Houston Rockets (8 ET) Houston Rockets fans will have to wait until at least the team\u2019s next preseason game to get their first glimpse at the team\u2019s shiny, new backcourt.

Westbrook had arthroscopic knee surgery in early May and the team is putting a priority on being cautious with him in the preseason, MacMahon reports. Per Shams Charania and others from The Athletic, Westbrook is expected to sit the first two preseason games and will make his Rockets preseason debut on Oct. 8 against the Toronto Raptors.

Of course, Beverley was ultimately proven wise when the Clippers scrapped their way to 48 wins and a pair of first-round wins against the Warriors while LeBron and the Lakers almost literally collapsed from a kick to the groin. With a swell of attention now being paid to presumptive title favorites, who added Paul George and Kawhi Leonard while retaining much of the supporting cast, Beverley was given the chance Sunday to double down on his prophecy. He toned it down. \u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d he said. Yet his sinister grin was plain to see, and it reflected the swagger and internal expectations of a franchise not known for through-the-roof projections. Such is the new world order in Los Angeles, and perhaps the NBA, in 2019-20. These are unprecedented times for the Clippers, who\u2019ve had winning teams before but none with this much title twinkle headed into the season. \u201cWe know what we\u2019re capable of doing,\u201d said Beverley, and so does everyone else. You don\u2019t add the reigning NBA Finals MVP and another who finished third in the regular-season Kia MVP balloting without shaking up the establishment, even if you\u2019ve never won a championship in franchise history. But there\u2019s a long wait between now and next spring\u2019s playoffs, and a shorter one to see George on the floor.  The 29-year-old swingman is still in the mending stage after off-season surgery on both shoulders. He said \u201cI\u2019m not sure\u201d when he\u2019ll be ready to play, even with opening night against the Lakers a little over three weeks away. George said he hasn\u2019t had any complications or setbacks, but won\u2019t engage in any contact work in camp and coach Doc Rivers said George will not appear in any games until he does. \u201cThere\u2019s no problems,\u201d George said. \u201cI\u2019m just going to do light work and drills for now.\u201d The other issue as it relates to health is Leonard\u2019s usage. Last year in Toronto, still smarting from a persistent quad injury that led to his stormy exit from the Spurs, Leonard didn\u2019t play on consecutive nights during back-to-back games. Rivers said there are no such restrictions this season, or demands from the player, although the coach wants to reserve the right to monitor and change the approach if necessary. \u201cLast year, I was going in with an injury that I was dealing with the year before, still was lingering, and we knew that I had to be healthy going throughout the season and making it to the playoffs,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cThis time, I\u2019m feeling good. I\u2019m feeling way better than I was at the start of last season. There really was no plan laid out to discuss with everyone.\u201d Rivers also noted that the Clippers\u2019 depth will allow for rest periods for George and Leonard; both players are joining a team that prospered without an All-Star last season, a team that will probably once again bring reigning Sixth Man of the Year Lou Williams and Montrezl Harrell off the bench. In due time, the Clippers will be complete, and that\u2019s the most important takeaway from their first official gathering. The level of enthusiasm is \u201csky-high,\u201d said Williams. Rivers has flexibility with Leonard and George, widely considered among the most elite two-way players in basketball. On offense, George and Leonard are top-10 league scorers (26.6 points last year for Leonard; 28.0 for George). Playing those two alongside Williams, who averaged 20 points last season in just 26 minutes off the bench, should cause matchup headaches. \u201cWe\u2019ll force a lot of defenses to make a lot of hard decisions,\u201d said Williams. And the options afforded to Rivers might even be richer on the other end. Rivers thinks pairing two newcomers plus Beverley \u2014 who guarded Kevin Durant in the playoffs, while giving away seven inches \u2014 can be \u201cspecial.\u201d Utilizing three players who can legitimately guard multiple positions, the Clippers\u2019 defense could be epic, if not historic. George said: \u201cIt\u2019s going to be scary \u2026 we\u2019ve really got a chance to do something special on the defensive end. Watching Pat get out there and picking somebody up 94 feet, that\u2019s going to get me going. It\u2019s going to get Kawhi going. It\u2019s just going to become contagious on a nightly basis. I honestly think, for the first time, people are going to be excited to watch the defensive end as opposed to watching the offensive end.\u201d The makings of a unique season, then, is on deck for the Clippers. It became realistic when Leonard, fresh off a title in Toronto, chose George and the Clippers over LeBron James and Anthony Davis and the Lakers \u2014 which, in itself, seems un-Clipper-like given the club\u2019s former reputation and history, when superstars were once allergic to L.A.\u2019s \u201cother\u201d basketball team. But these are new times. \u201cWe actually wanted to be teammates for a long time,\u201d said George. \u201cThis was always in the works to happen at some point.\u201d From the top of the organization to the bottom, everyone knows the potential and just the same, would rather allow a scenario to play itself out than speak it into existence. That\u2019s why Beverley provided the most unexpected news of camp by playing it coy. But you knew where he stood. \u201cCan\u2019t wait to get started,\u201d he said, echoing the thoughts of a locker room thinking big. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

One: Anthony Davis, do-it-all forward, rescued from the depths of the New Orleans Pelicans, desperate for a championship and perhaps in line for the next Kia MVP award, both of which would be his first. Two: LeBron James. Yes, it\u2019s true this is LeBron\u2019s second season with the storied franchise, but does last year truly count? In his mind, no, it doesn\u2019t, because the Lakers and NBA were all deprived of his usual high standard of greatness and astonishing health in 2018-19. The health part betrayed him for the first time in his 16-year career, causing him to miss 27 games, mostly due to a persistently bothersome groin strain. The part about greatness didn\u2019t necessarily and totally disappear ; after all, LeBron did average 27-8-8, numbers that even stars would kill for. Except those numbers didn\u2019t translate into a playoff berth, even when he returned from injury and the Lakers still had a chance in the final month. And that, by extension, generated motivation within LeBron to answer the criticism both real (only a scant amount) and imagined (a lot) that LeBron now approaching 35 is no longer the force he was. \u201cOh, man,\u201d said teammate Kyle Kuzma. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be a load this season, more than usual.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s gonna show all those people who are underestimating him,\u201d added Rajon Rondo. \u201cThe stuff I saw him do this summer, getting up early in the morning, first one in the gym, working hard, it\u2019s gonna pay off,\u201d Davis said. A changed LeBron? Well, it\u2019s hard to imagine him being a more focused player than before, just as it wouldn\u2019t be a stretch to suggest that, yes, LeBron could experience a slight drop-off in talent because Father Time shows no mercy to anyone. But it\u2019s also quite possible the 2019-20 LeBron can and will do what last year\u2019s version couldn\u2019t: Push the Lakers to a championship or at the very least, a deep playoff run. He appeared refreshed Friday at media day \u2014 as he should with plenty of time off. Stoic at times and totally businesslike, LeBron spoke about the frustration of watching the playoffs \u2014 he stressed he \u201cdidn\u2019t miss a single game\u201d \u2014 from his couch for the first time since 2005. He also shared his anticipation of sharing the floor with Davis. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting to have such a beautiful young mind, a beautiful player but also a great leader as well,\u201d LeBron said about Davis, although the 2018-19 Pelicans might quibble with that last part. \u201cI know the caliber of player that AD is. When Rob (Pelinka, the GM) and everyone upstairs did what they had to do to acquire a talent, person as AD, I was obviously truly excited. You saw how much time we spent together in the summer.\u201d True enough, Davis and LeBron have been shadows of one another, with Davis spending time on the set of the \u201cSpace Jam\u201d sequel, where LeBron is the star and Davis has a role, and also on the phone with Pelinka when the Lakers made decisions on the rest of the roster. The sight of Davis and LeBron, a pair of generational talents with one of them still in his prime, running the floor and causing problems for the other bench is what LeBron needed but didn\u2019t have last season when the Lakers won just 37 games and missed the playoffs for the sixth straight season. LeBron plans to be as deferential as possible to Davis, who\u2019s coming off a bitter end to a six-year run in New Orleans, in order to get the best from his All-Star forward. If that means LeBron must allow Davis to be the focal point of the offense, LeBron says so be it. \u201cIf we\u2019re not playing through Anthony Davis while he\u2019s on the floor, then it makes no sense to have him on the floor,\u201d James said. \u201cBecause he\u2019s that great.\u201d The goal, obviously, is for LeBron to develop the same chemistry with Davis that he had with Dwyane Wade in Miami, and to get similar results \u2014 the Heat won a pair of championships and reached the NBA Finals every year with LeBron in the fold. The process is a bit more critical now because the Lakers sacrificed a chunk of their future to get Davis, and LeBron has only three years left on his contract. There\u2019s also the notion that LeBron is in his sunset years although the insinuation, according to LeBron, is that it means he\u2019s lost a step and a place among the league\u2019s great players. While some of this criticism might be generated by his imagination, there was talk this summer \u2014 such as comments from David Griffin \u2014 that might have bothered him a little bit. \u201cI\u2019m very motivated,\u201d he said, \u201cbut right now I\u2019m in \u2018not talking about it mode.\u2019 I\u2019ve been very quiet this summer for a reason \u2026 but there\u2019s some motivation for me. There\u2019s a lot of conversations going on this summer and I\u2019m just very quiet, very quiet. And I\u2019m just going to maintain quiet, My mother always taught me, \u2018don\u2019t talk about it, be about it.\u2019 So that\u2019s where I\u2019m at. I think as a team, and myself, we need to get the Lakers back to what they\u2019ve been accustomed to over the years. I\u2019m excited about that.\u201d LeBron needs Davis and yet, Davis needs LeBron just as much \u2014 the projected 2019-20 LeBron, who\u2019s juiced by motivation, failure, an injury setback and all that chatter that he hears (or doesn\u2019t) about his declining skills. Because without LeBron, Davis wouldn\u2019t be here. Davis would either still be in New Orleans or staring up at the banners hanging from the ceiling in Boston and wondering how to duplicate that. Therefore, until further notice, the fate of the Lakers will rest with how much LeBron can distance himself from last season. The Lakers will require improved outside shooting and better defense (especially from LeBron) and obviously an MVP-level season from Davis to place themselves in the championship conversation . Then, all of the above are realistic. But it ends with LeBron, and isn\u2019t this how it all started, with him? * * * Veteran NBA writer Shaun Powell has worked for newspapers and other publications for more than 25 years.

With plenty of free time on his hands, James filmed \u201cSpace Jam 2,\u201d which will be released next summer. But those early call times at Warner Bros. meant he had to rise before dawn to complete his daily workouts.

James says he is more motivated than ever to win big with the Lakers, who have missed the playoffs for six straight years.

So thanks, Vermont.\u201d > 30 Teams in 30 Days: Thunder If only the changes for the Thunder were as simple. Paul George\u2019s surprise trade request accelerated the end of an era. The Thunder sent George to the Los Angeles Clippers, then traded former MVP and scoring champion Russell Westbrook to Houston and rising star Jerami Grant to Denver. Now, for the first time, the Thunder enter a season with no players who were part of the team that debuted in Oklahoma City in 2008. The Thunder got a slew of draft picks in the deals and some players who can help immediately. Oklahoma City added veteran point guard Chris Paul from Houston in the Westbrook trade and Danilo Gallinari and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander from the Clippers. Paul, a nine-time All-Star, averaged 15.6 points and 8.2 assists for the Rockets last season. Gallinari, a forward, averaged a career-highs of 19.8 points and 6.1 rebounds per game last season and made 43.3 percent of his 3-pointers. Gilgeous-Alexander, a point guard, averaged 10.8 points and 3.3 assists as a rookie last season. There are some significant holdovers, too. Steven Adams has a chance to make a bigger name for himself. The 7-foot center averaged 13.9 points and 9.5 rebounds last season while shooting nearly 60% from the field. \u201cI\u2019m really excited for him,\u201d Presti said. \u201cI am really obviously a huge fan of his. I think that he still has growth left in his game. I think he has an opportunity to expand himself a little bit. He\u2019s the ultimate blocking, tackling player, but I also think that he\u2019s a talented player, and so he\u2019ll have an opportunity to do a little bit more.\u201d Guard Dennis Schroder is the top returning scorer after averaging 15.5 points per game last season. Forward Andre Roberson, one of the league\u2019s best perimeter defensive players, is back after missing the past 1 + seasons with a left knee injury. Presti said Thursday that Roberson will participate in training camp and is expected to play in the preseason. \u201cI\u2019m excited, and I think everybody is excited, to watch and see how the team comes together through the year,\u201d Presti said. \u201cI think this team has a significant amount of discovery within it in terms of just learning about the new players that we have and how they fit with the existing group.\u201d There is enough talent that Presti still sees the playoffs as a goal. \u201cWhat we want to do is be playing meaningful basketball at the end of the year,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to try to do everything we can to put ourselves in position to optimize the group that we have, and there\u2019s just no shortcuts to that.

Under the new experimental NBA G League rule, one free throw worth one, two or three points will be awarded in the event of any foul that would typically result in one, two or three free throws being shot under standard NBA rules. The experimental free throw rule will not apply during the last two minutes of the fourth quarter or the entirety of any overtime period. The NBA G League will continue to play with experimental rules that were previously implemented, including the transition take foul, the 14-second shot clock reset on an advance, a two-minute overtime period, the away-from-the-play foul rule and the reset timeout. The reset allows teams to call a timeout to advance the ball and make substitutions but not huddle in the final two minutes of the fourth quarter and during entire overtime periods. Apart from experimental rules, NBA G League games are played under all other NBA rules. The research and development arm of the NBA, the NBA G League routinely tests experimental rules and procedures.

I felt like the past season I lost that enjoyment side of it but I feel like this summer has been huge for me. Just the work I\u2019ve been putting in, I kinda fell in love with putting that work in again and I\u2019ve been in the gym every day working and the results have been paying off so I\u2019m excited for the season to start.\u201d > 76ers set for Media Day on Monday > 30 Teams in 30 Days: 76ers >  Mid-Summer Power Rankings: East Simmons, the No. 1 overall draft pick in 2016, has helped lead the Sixers to the second round of the NBA playoffs two straight seasons after making his debut in 2017. He was the Rookie of the Year that season and an All-Star for the first time last season. Simmons has averaged 16.4 points, 8.5 rebounds and 7.9 assists and signed a $170 million, five-year contract extension in July. Philadelphia is 101-58 in regular-season games when Simmons plays. He has had 22 triple-doubles in the past two seasons, tied for third most in the league with Denver\u2019s Nikola Jokic and trailing Oklahoma City\u2019s Russell Westbrook (59) and the Los Angeles Lakers\u2019 LeBron James (26). Simmons also has had 80 double-doubles over the past two seasons. But the one knock against Simmons has been his reluctance to shoot long jumpers and 3-pointers. He\u2019s 0 for 18 from beyond the arc, so defenses often focus on taking away his ability to drive to the basket and dare him to shoot. He\u2019s up for the challenge. \u201dI\u2019m ready to be who I am as a player, continue to develop, keep working,\u201d Simmons said. \u201dIt\u2019s a process. It takes time. Obviously, people always want to see results straightaway but that\u2019s not how things work.\u201d Simmons decided to focus on improving his game instead of playing for the Australian team at the FIBA World Cup earlier this month in China. He rediscovered his love for basketball during those long hours in the gym and admitted the criticism weighed on him at times. \u201dI think sometimes you kind of get too deep into it where you listen to other people which should never be the thing you do unless they\u2019re giving you positive feedback or trying to help you get better because there\u2019s a lot of negativity out there,\u201d Simmons said, pointing to various social media platforms. \u201dIt\u2019s huge once you kind of block that out, you don\u2019t really care, you kinda go out there feeling free. You don\u2019t care if you miss a shot because everyone misses a shot so that\u2019s one of the things that I think this summer I got back to how I was as a player just playing and doing what I love at a high level.\u201d Despite being a lightning rod for criticism in Philadelphia, Simmons says he enjoys playing in front of a passionate fan base. \u201dI love being in Philadelphia. I wouldn\u2019t want to be anywhere else,\u201d he said. \u201dI think this is the perfect place for me. I just handle (criticism) how it comes.\u201d Simmons heard plenty of boos after a poor performance in Philadelphia\u2019s first-round series opener against Brooklyn in April. He had nine points, seven rebounds, and three assists and shot 1 for 5 from the free throw line in a loss. Afterward, Simmons said: \u201dIf you\u2019re gonna boo, then stay on that side.\u201d Simmons answered with his second career playoff triple-double in Game 2, finishing with 18 points, 12 assists and 10 rebounds as Philadelphia reeled off four straight wins. He looks back at it as a learning experience. \u201dI had a terrible first game and I loved it when people are tweeting me saying all these negative things because the next game I came out (and played better),\u201d Simmons said. \u201dIt kinda fires me up a little.\u201d Why does he even pay attention to the critics flexing their keyboard muscles? \u201dIt\u2019s hard to avoid. It\u2019s hard to not see,\u201d Simmons said. \u201dI\u2019ve done a better job of not watching certain things in terms of what people are saying but that was a good example of people not giving me positive feedback and I had to respond.\u201d The Sixers revamped their roster in the offseason, losing Jimmy Butler and JJ Redick and adding Al Horford and Josh Richardson and retaining Tobias Harris to play with Simmons and fellow All-Star Joel Embiid. \u201dWe\u2019re locked in. We\u2019re ready to play,\u201d Simmons said. \u201dWe\u2019ve been in the gym. We\u2019ve been there early.

(AP) \u2014 It was time for the last jump shot of Markelle Fultz\u2019s workout on the Orlando Magic practice court on Wednesday. He let a 3-pointer fly from the left corner, and spun around in celebration even before the ball swished through the net. After two years of problems, he\u2019s feeling good again. The shoulder injuries that kept him off the court for most of the two seasons since he was picked No. 1 in the 2017 draft are now being managed \u2013 he\u2019s hesitant to say healed \u2013 and Fultz is expected to be a full participant in practice when the Magic open training camp next week. It also will hold media day on Monday . It\u2019s a significant step forward, though the Magic also know they\u2019ll have to proceed with caution. > 30 Teams in 30 Days: Magic \u201cMan, I always have joy every time I step in here no matter what\u2019s going on,\u201d Fultz said after his workout. \u201cAs I learned quickly, you can\u2019t take it for granted. You never know when it\u2019s going to get stripped away from you.\u201d His shot is still a work in progress. Some of his jumpers Wednesday were perfect, some rimmed out and a few took an ugly trajectory to the front of the rim. His release doesn\u2019t appear to be the same as it was during his college season at Washington, part of the re-training he\u2019s done to deal with his shoulder issues. But he\u2019s on the floor. That\u2019s major progress. \u201cWe\u2019re going to remain patient,\u201d Magic President Jeff Weltman said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to put expectations or timelines on his development. He hasn\u2019t played basketball in a year. He\u2019s played 33 games total in his career. So it\u2019s going to unfold the way it unfolds.\u201d Fultz has played in 33 regular-season games in his two NBA seasons. His shoulder problems \u2013 first called a scapular muscle imbalance, a fancy way of saying the joints in the shoulder weren\u2019t working together properly \u2013 took him out of the lineup for the first time after just four games of his rookie season with Philadelphia. He missed 68 games that year before returning for the final few weeks. Last season was equally problematic. Fultz started Philadelphia\u2019s first 15 games before things went bad again. He double-clutched a free throw in a game at Miami and was widely mocked on social media afterward. Before long, he was diagnosed with a new problem \u2013 neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome, a condition where blood vessels or nerves around the collarbone and first rib are compressed. \u201cA lot of people, they would never go play with what I had and knowing they couldn\u2019t shoot the ball,\u201d Fultz said. By the time doctors figured out what was really ailing Fultz, he had played his last game for the 76ers. The Magic traded Jonathan Simmons and a package of draft picks to Philadelphia for him in February. He never played for the Magic last season, though the move last week to pick up his $12.3 million option for 2020-21 is a clear sign that Orlando believes in Fultz. \u201cIt was a no-brainer,\u201d Weltman said. Fultz said he\u2019s not motivated by silencing doubters. But if that was the case, it wouldn\u2019t surprise Mike Jones. He\u2019s the coach at DeMatha Catholic High in Hyattsville, Maryland, a perennial national powerhouse \u2013 the school where Fultz played. Jones also was the coach who didn\u2019t pick Fultz for varsity when he was a sophomore. \u201cHis whole career has been proving people wrong,\u201d Jones said. \u201cWhen he didn\u2019t make the varsity here, I truly believe that he spent the next two years here making sure I knew that was a mistake. And now, I think he wants people to keep doubting him \u2013 because he\u2019s going to show them.\u201d Lorenzo Romar, Fultz\u2019s college coach at Washington, feels the same way. Fultz spent some time with Romar, now the coach at Pepperdine, last season. They didn\u2019t talk much about his injury \u2013 \u201cthe elephant in the room\u201d is how Romar described the situation. But Romar coached Magic guard Terrence Ross in college, has followed Magic forward Aaron Gordon\u2019s career closely and knows the strides that Orlando took last year while getting to the playoffs for the first time since 2012. Adding Fultz to that mix, Romar said, is only going to make Orlando better. \u201cI know the pieces they have on that team,\u201d Romar said. \u201cWhen Markelle comes back and gets his rhythm back, he\u2019s as good a talented point guard as you will find. He\u2019s an athletic wizard. You put him out there with the rest of that group when he gets his rhythm, they could be special.\u201d Fultz doesn\u2019t disagree. He said he dreams of the day he can play 5-on-5 in a real game again. He raves about Magic coach Steve Clifford, raves about what the team\u2019s medical staff has done for him \u2013 taking tons of time last season to acquaint themselves with his injury, sending people to Los Angeles to work with him this offseason, then putting together the proper balance of on-court work, rest and rehab in Orlando. His game is coming back. His confidence is still there. \u201cI was the No. 1 pick for a reason,\u201d Fultz said. \u201cI knew that I work hard and what I can do on the basketball court. That\u2019s all that matters.\u201d"},{"id":46365,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/kyrie-irving-brooklyn-nets-left-side-facial-fracture","date":"2019-09-25","title":"Kyrie Irving day-to-day with facial fracture","content":" Kyrie Irving has been diagnosed with a left side facial fracture, the Brooklyn Nets announced on Wednesday.

General manager Sean Marks said Tuesday the Nets are planning this season without the injured All-Star. He added Durant will have a say in determining when he\u2019s ready. \u201cWith Kevin, I think what we\u2019re going to say is the expectations are that he\u2019ll be out for the year,\u201d Marks said. Durant is recovering from surgery to repair a ruptured Achilles tendon. He was injured while playing for the Golden State Warriors in the NBA Finals, then left the Warriors to sign with the Nets in July. At the time, the Nets left open the possibility that Durant could play this season. That\u2019s still possible, but Marks isn\u2019t banking on it. \u201cI\u2019ve been excited to see, I think we all have, how he\u2019s approached this rehab, which has been great, very refreshing and energizing for the whole group,\u201d Marks said. \u201cBut at the end of the day, this is a long-term plan here. This was never about this next season. This is about getting an elite athlete back to elite physical shape on the court, whatever that takes.\u201d Durant returned from an injured calf muscle he sustained in the postseason for Game 5 of the NBA Finals, but lasted only 12 minutes before leaving with a more severe injury. Marks said Durant hasn\u2019t given any indication that he plans to take things slowly. \u201cI think you\u2019re looking at one of the great competitors out there, so I think I would be remiss if I said no, he probably doesn\u2019t want to play,\u201d Marks said. \u201cI think it\u2019s obvious he wants to play, but I think there\u2019s more at stake here. \u201cThis is, again, a long-term approach. There are a lot of people with a lot of sweat equity in this from the rehab perspective and so forth. And so I think it\u2019ll be a group that makes the decision, and obviously Kevin included as to when and how that return is made.\u201d In the meantime, Marks thinks Durant will try to be around his new team, though can\u2019t predict how much. He isn\u2019t even sure yet whether Durant will accompany the Nets to China next month for their exhibition games against the Los Angeles Lakers. Durant is expected to speak Friday when the Nets hold their media day. He signed with Brooklyn along with fellow All-Star Kyrie Irving, who was hurt Tuesday when he was elbowed during a pickup game. Marks doesn\u2019t believe the injury was serious, although Irving went for an evaluation accompanied by coach Kenny Atkinson. When Durant and Irving join a team that won 42 games and made the playoffs last season, the Nets could turn into one of the top contenders in the Eastern Conference. They know it could take a season. \u201cI don\u2019t know that all the guys we signed in the offseason are coming here for mediocrity,\u201d Marks said. \u201cThat\u2019s not part of it. This is why we went in.\u201d"},{"id":31738,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/warriors-prepare-transition-new-era","date":"2019-09-24","title":"Warriors prepare for transition to new era","content":" Kevin Durant is gone. Ditto for Andre Iguodala, Shaun Livingston, DeMarcus Cousins, Quinn Cook, Jonas Jerebko and Jordan Bell. For all intents and purposes, the Warriors are considering Klay Thompson gone until the All-Star guard returns from a torn ACL suffered in the 2019 Finals. That\u2019s an avalanche of turnover for a former champion built and sustained on continuity. Warriors coach Steve Kerr knows this, and admitted to The Athletic that next week\u2019s training camp will be the \u201cmost important\u201d he has run since his rookie season (2014-15). Most of it will no doubt re-center around superstar guard Stephen Curry, whom The Ringer\u2019s Kevin O\u2019Connor believes should be favored to win his third Kia Most Valuable Player award. With Durant in Brooklyn and Thompson sidelined, Curry would appear primed to shoulder the kind of offensive season the league has not seen since 2015-16 . At least one major reinforcement arrived in the form of D\u2019Angelo Russell. The 23-year-old guard earned his first All-Star appearance last season in Brooklyn, and was acquired in the sign-and-trade deal that sent Durant to the Nets. Yet it is impossible to judge the new-look Warriors\u2019 ceiling until Thompson returns. The five-time All-Star is itching to join his fellow Splash Brother, even \u2014 perhaps especially \u2014 after the most significant setback of his career. Thompson suffered his knee injury in Game 6 against Toronto, an event that overshadowed the 30 points in 32 minutes that preceded it. \u201cI felt like the best version I\u2019ve ever felt of myself in that NBA Finals,\u201d Thompson told The Athletic . \u201cI kid you not.\u201d Yet Thompson\u2019s injury is no kidding matter.

An increase in fines for tampering, for entering into unauthorized agreements with players and even for talking about players under contract elsewhere passed unanimously, commissioner Adam Silver said, in a vote of the Board of Governors. Final figures still were to be determined, though reports have suggested the maximum fines could rise to $10 million for tampering, $6 million for improper deals and $5 million for comments enticing other teams\u2019 players.  Tougher penalties, however, only matter if the league\u2019s 30 franchises have the will to do what it takes to impose them. And the discipline not to do what triggers them. The meetings this week and Friday\u2019s vote didn\u2019t only give Silver a bigger stick to wield against such violations, they encouraged him to use it. The message of the Board? \u201cY ou need to do a better job enforcing the rules that are already on your books,\u201d Silver said, \u201cand do a better job ensuring that there is a culture around the league where people believe there are absolute consequences if you don\u2019t play by the rules.\u201d The frenzied free agent market this offseason, for instance, raised red flags about teams\u2019 compliance with rules dictating when front-office executives and players\u2019 representatives could begin negotiations. The number and enormity of deals that leaked out within minutes of the June 30 tipoff suggested that contract talks in many cases surely began before the designated period. Also, as free agent Kawhi Leonard pondered his decision to leave Toronto (eventually signing with the Clippers), there was speculation that his representative may have sought benefits outside the salary-cap provisions. Tampering is a transgression that\u2019s more troubling to some teams than others. While clubs such as Charlotte, Indiana and anyone who has a player Houston covets want rules to be strictly enforced, the Los Angeles Lakers \u2013 dinged in the recent past for talking publicly about Paul George and Giannis Antetokounmpo while they still were under contract \u2013 have fared well in flouting them. The Boston Celtics, meanwhile, might have found themselves on both side of the issue in losing guard Kyrie Irving to Brooklyn and forward Al Horford to Philadelphia, while luring guard Kemba Walker away from the Hornets. But the position of the league Friday was that all the organizations favor more integrity and less chicanery, whether to avoid being victimized or to not get outmaneuvered by some rival. \u201cThere was a strong view of every single person in the room that we need to ensure that we\u2019re creating a culture of compliance in this league,\u201d Silver said. \u201cOur teams want to know that they\u2019re competing on a level playing field, and frankly don\u2019t want to feel disadvantaged if they are adhering to our existing rules.\u201d \u201cCulture of compliance\u201d was mentioned repeatedly by Silver, who presides over a league that, like most others, needs teams to strike a balance between staying competitive and being cooperative. If zealous owners, presidents of basketball operations or general managers go too far in one direction, there\u2019s chaos. If they go too far in the other, they risk getting criticized and even slapped with a collusion lawsuit for not pursuing or bidding for players.  \u201cWe don\u2019t have that problem,\u201d one member of the Board said at the conclusion of Friday\u2019s session. Integrity and transparency have become buzzwords around the halls of Olympic Tower, the NBA\u2019s headquarters in New York, as they relate to traditional priorities such as fans\u2019 trust and new ones such as legal sports betting. For instance, the decision this week to have coaches submit their starting lineups earlier \u2013 from 10 minutes prior to tipoff to 30 minutes beginning this season \u2013 is widely seen as a nod to wagering, providing more time to know which key players will or won\u2019t be available for a given game. (Teams will be permitted to amend those lineups if a player sustains or aggravates an injury during pregame warmups.) Dialing up the dollar amounts was the big move Friday, but Silver has other \u201ctools\u201d in his box to penalize teams that might view fines as a cost of doing business if it helps them land a prized free agent. Remember, the Clippers were fined $50,000 in May after coach Doc Rivers compared Leonard to Michael Jordan in an ESPN interview; two months later, Leonard was on Rivers\u2019 roster. The league already had the authority to strip draft picks, suspend team personnel and void contracts for the most egregious violations. \u201cF ining authority unto itself may be one of the least effective tools,\u201d Silver said. \u201cAll of those [other] provisions are on the table.\u201d Enforcing the rules, beyond just imposing penalties after the fact, will require some serious policing by the NBA. Owners and top basketball executives will be required to certify that they will not engage in improper negotiations with players or their reps, giving the league more clout if they subsequently violate the rules. Five teams reportedly will be audited annually, with a framework on the extent of the league\u2019s reach still in the works.  Silver confirmed that he has the power to take people\u2019s cell phones, tablets and other devices, if necessary. While he\u2019s sensitive to privacy concerns, the commissioner added: \u201cIt\u2019s my job to create an appropriate amount of tension in that area. Obviously, if people felt that they were absolutely free and clear to communicate in certain ways, you wouldn\u2019t be addressing the consequences notion of improper activity.\u201d One area not addressed by the Board of Governors was the role of players in recruiting other teams\u2019 stars, not just in advance of any official free-agent negotiating period but while their friends still have years remaining on their contracts. Last season, New Orleans big man Anthony Davis undermined the Pelicans\u2019 and his individual season when \u2013 at what many believe to be the suggestion of agent Rich Paul\u2019s and \/ or fellow Paul client LeBron James \u2013 he asked to be traded to the Lakers halfway through his five-year extension with his team. The league fined Davis $50,000 for that disruption but, sure enough, Davis and the $55.8 million left on his contract were dealt to Los Angeles in July. Silver reminded his audience that some issues must be collectively bargained with the National Basketball Players Association. For example, moving the start of free agency up to begin before the Draft would be one of those. The league historically has not enforced tampering rules against player-to-player contact. None of the measures mentioned Friday addressed that. \u201cWhat\u2019s lost sometimes,\u201d Silver said, \u201cis that for the 450 players or so in the league, they want a competitive landscape as well. They don\u2019t necessarily want a system where there\u2019s a sense that certain teams have a competitive advantage over other teams, because then you\u2019re just benefiting the players that happen to be on those teams.\u201d Even as reports of tougher penalties and more thorough rules were being published this week, some team executives were speculating to media folks about ways they could be bent or circumvented. But Silver did not sound deterred. \u201cMy sense of the room was this was not just about \u2018league office vs. teams,\u2019 that what we are really seeking again is a cultural change,\u201d the commissioner said. \u201cIf someone is absolutely determined to cheat in any industry and people are willing to do anything to be successful, I guess you have rogue actors in every field and in every industry. \u201cWhat we\u2019re saying, though, [is] we think we\u2019re dramatically going to increase the likelihood that we\u2019re going to catch you. I don\u2019t want to suggest there\u2019s any perfect system. At some point you\u2019re relying, at least in part, on the good faith of partners working together and \u2026 that this is a culture in which people want to compete fairly.\u201d That\u2019s the challenge, at least.

Fines of up to $10 million are now possible in the most egregious situations, along with forfeiture of draft picks, suspensions of executives and voiding of contracts when rule breaking is found \u2014 significant enough threats, the league hopes, to end any notion of teams entering into deals with free agents before rules allow. \u201cWe need to ensure that we\u2019re creating a culture of compliance in this league,\u201d NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said after two days of meetings concluded in New York. \u201cOur teams want to know that they\u2019re competing on a level playing field and frankly don\u2019t want to feel disadvantaged if they are adhering to our existing rules.\u201d The rules aren\u2019t new, but Silver has been saying for months that it\u2019s pointless for the league to have policies that cannot be enforced. And while the new parameters aren\u2019t foolproof, an important change is that every franchise will have to annually certify that its executives did not to free agents or their representatives before league rules allow. But for years, the notion of waiting for the start of free agency to talk to available players has been largely ignored. This year, free agency was to officially begin at 6 p.m. Eastern on June 30, and many deals were known to be done within minutes. \u201cThere need to be consequences when rules are violated,\u201d Silver said. The league told teams last week that fines would be raised in part to reflect the 600% increase in league revenue and the 1,100% increase in franchise value since the maximum-fine ceilings were last touched in 1996. There are some elements of the new measures that still need to be worked out \u2014 specifically, the specifics behind the league\u2019s new mandate that five teams will be randomly selected for investigatory audits to see if there were any rule-compliance issues. The NBA wants teams to keep records of talks with players and agents for a year, and the league has the power to review a team\u2019s electronic communications devices. The privacy concerns, however, remain a sticking point, Silver said. \u201cNone of us want people looking into their personal communications,\u201d Silver said. \u201cBut I think people who operate in a public company environment or operate in a financial world who are used to compliance procedures understand that you have to find a balance between disclosure and privacy so you can ensure that people will understand that there will be consequences for inappropriate behavior.\u201d * * * In other matters before the Board of Governors: The issue of James Harden\u2019s stepback jumper \u2014 travel or not a travel? \u2014 may soon have some clarity. The NBA is revising rule-book language regarding traveling, and specifically defining a \u201cgather\u201d \u2014 plus clarifying how many steps a player may take. For players receiving a pass or picking up a loose ball, the gather is defined as when control of the ball is gained. Off the dribble, the definition is when a player has two hands on the ball, or brings it to a pause, or otherwise gains control. The league is expected to release a training video next week, and said correctly calling travels gather will be a point of emphasis this season. Daily fantasy players and bettors will now know who is expected to play in a certain game a bit earlier than usual. Teams now must submit starting lineups 30 minutes before the scheduled start time, instead of the previous rule of 10 minutes. Lineups can still change after the 30-minute mark, which gives teams flexibility if an injury occurs or is aggravated during warm-ups. Silver said there have been discussions about changing the dates of free agency, though noted that any change would have to be collectively bargained with the players. The Houston Rockets suggested last season that it would be a good idea to move free agency ahead of the NBA draft. \u201cMy sense is those conversations will continue,\u201d Silver said of the notion of changing the free-agency calendar. \u201cI don\u2019t have any expectation that anything is going to happen in the near term.\u201d"},{"id":31730,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/board-governors-clarification-traveling-official-release","date":"2019-09-20","title":"NBA Board of Governors approves clarification of rule governing traveling violations","content":" NEW YORK \u2014 The NBA Board of Governors today approved new language in the NBA rule book that governs traveling violations.

It\u2019s now nine-years-and-counting in the top spot for the U.S., which has held the No. 1 ranking since winning the 2010 world championship. World Cup champion Spain stayed No. 2, Australia leaped eight spots to No. 3, World Cup finalist Argentina rose one spot to No. 4 and World Cup bronze-medalist France fell two slots to No. 5. FIBA\u2019s rankings take results from the most recent eight years into account \u2014 which means the U.S. is still reaping point benefits from the 2012 and 2016 Olympic gold medals and the 2014 World Cup title. \u201cIn this day and age, basketball in other countries is not a secret,\u201d U.S. coach Gregg Popovich said after the Americans completed their run in the World Cup. \u201cSo it\u2019s not like there\u2019s an epiphany or a revelation to be made. There are wonderful teams and wonderful coaches all over the world. You go compete and the best teams win.\u201d It\u2019s now expected that the U.S. will retain the No. 1 ranking going into the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. Several top NBA players, including Stephen Curry, Draymond Green and Damian Lillard have said in recent days that they intend to play for the U.S. in Tokyo, where the Americans will try to win a fourth consecutive gold medal. Most top U.S. players declined to be part of the World Cup team. \u201cI\u2019m expecting them to be so strong next year,\u201d Spain coach Sergio Scariolo said. The new rankings confirmed that European champion Slovenia, which didn\u2019t earn a spot in the World Cup field after many of its top players couldn\u2019t take part in qualifying since those games conflicted with the NBA and Euroleague schedules, will still have a chance to compete in the Olympics \u2014 as will seven other teams that found out they\u2019re headed to playoffs next year.

The U.S., Argentina, Nigeria, Spain, France, Iran and Australia clinched Olympic spots at the World Cup by finishing as the best teams in their respective FIBA regions \u2014 the Americas, Africa, Europe, Asia and Oceania. That leaves four unclaimed Olympic berths, and 24 teams to compete for them in playoffs next year. There will be four six-team tournaments held from June 23-28, 2020 \u2014 winner-take-all, all in this case meaning an Olympic berth. Bidding for sites is expected to begin shortly, FIBA said. The other 16 playoff spots were awarded based on World Cup placing. They went to Serbia, Lithuania, Greece, Russia, Brazil, Italy, Puerto Rico, Turkey, the Dominican Republic, Venezuela, Germany, Canada, the Czech Republic, Poland, New Zealand and Tunisia. Belize was the top mover in the new rankings, climbing 50 spots to No. 118.

The same can be said for another All-Star guard in the Western Conference, the Portland Trail Blazers\u2019 Damian Lillard. Curry, in an interview with ESPN\u2019s Rachel Nichols , says he\u2019s committed to playing for the team next year. If he does so, it would mark the former two-time Kia MVP\u2019s first appearance on the Olympic basketball stage. \u201cThat is the plan, for sure,\u201d Curry said, per ESPN\u2019s Nick Friedell . \u201cYou know, obviously knock on wood, you don\u2019t want any injuries or things like that to interfere. \u201cDefinitely wanna go. I\u2019ve never been on the Olympic team. I\u2019ve been on two World Cup championship gold-medal teams. But the Olympics is the experience that I want. And next year will hopefully be it.\u201d Lillard spoke with James McKern of news.com.au in Australia during a trip to Sydney as Adidas\u2019 Global Ambassador. After Team USA\u2019s seventh-place finish at the 2019 FIBA World Cup, Lillard also made no bones about his plans next year : Curry has participated with Team USA as a member of the FIBA World Cup championship-winning teams in 2010 and \u201914 . Lillard has been in the USA Basketball mix since 2014, but has never participated in international play with the team. Team USA\u2019s showing in the latest World Cup assured it of the worst tournament showing in program history. Several key NBA stars \u2014 such as Lillard, Anthony Davis, James Harden, CJ McCollum, Bradley Beal, DeMar DeRozan and others \u2014 withdrew from the team either before or during this summer\u2019s training camp. In an interview with SI.com on Tuesday, USA Basketball managing director Jerry Colangelo said he felt \u201cdisappointment\u201d over the players who backed out. Colangelo also said he\u2019d \u201cremember\u201d the players who \u201cdidn\u2019t show up.\u201d But Curry\u2019s declaration that he intends to play in 2020 may open the gates for those players who didn\u2019t show up this summer to play again next summer. Davis, Lillard and Harden were late withdrawals from Team USA, but Colangelo said that may not hurt them in being a part of the U.S. National Team come the 2020. \u201cWe\u2019re still the best,\u201d Curry told ESPN. \u201cIf we get the guys that are supposed to be there, in terms of, you know, representing us in the Olympic stage and the commitment\u2019s been there, and I think it\u2019ll be there next year.\u201d Lillard, in his interview, also discussed the state of the Blazers and their place in the West hierarchy. Despite reaching their first conference finals since 2000, Lillard responded to the notion that Portland may not be a favorite to repeat that feat in 2019-20. The Blazers were busy in the offseason , picking up center Hassan Whiteside, guard Kent Bazemore and veteran forward Anthony Tolliver in various moves. \u201cFor us it\u2019s not really about what people are saying because we always come and show up. It\u2019s almost better that they\u2019re not expecting it to be us, that under the radar type of coming in and doing what we got to do,\u201d Lillard told McKern. \u201cA lot of the guys that we brought in they compliment what we do and what we have. Hassan Whiteside being a lob threat, we never really had a lob threat and never had a rim protector like him. We\u2019re going to have him for a full season and then we\u2019ll get [center Jusuf Nurkic] Nurk back later in the season. Kent Bazemore an experienced wing, put him out there with Rodney Hood, myself, CJ, Zach Collins, Anthony Tolliver. I mean we have so many pieces that go well together so I think it\u2019s definitely going to be an opportunity for us.\u201d Curry used his interview with ESPN to chime in on the Warriors\u2019 offseason, one in which a sign-and-trade deal brought D\u2019Angelo Russell aboard (from Brooklyn) and saw former Finals MVP Kevin Durant move on (to Brooklyn). Earlier this summer, Curry had spoken about Durant\u2019s move and the new future that faced Golden State and further expanded on that in his ESPN interview. \u201cAt the end of the day, we live in an age where choice at the forefront, and K, you know, made a decision for himself and you can\u2019t argue that,\u201d Curry told ESPN. \u201cI wish we could still play with K. He\u2019s an unbelievable talent, unbelievable person. We accomplished a lot together. But \u2014 you know, things have changed a little bit. So you obviously wish him the best, obviously with his recovery first and foremost and things on and off the court. But we\u2019re gonna have to battle down the road. So this should be a fun, new experience on that front, too.\u201d The Wall Street Journal had a lengthy profile on Durant , in which Durant said he felt he was never fully embraced as a member of the Warriors. Curry had his thoughts on that interview, explaining how he cherished playing alongside Durant in their three seasons together. \u201cI mean, that\u2019s tough,\u201d Curry told ESPN. \u201cThere\u2019s so many narratives that go on, especially when you\u2019re at the top of the league. No matter how, you know, the full transition happens to Brooklyn, him separating himself from the Warriors \u2014 that\u2019s gonna happen. I think he knows, you know, what we were about as teammates, what we were about as friends on and off the court. And again, nobody is gonna take away the accomplishments we had. But at the end of the day, whatever he, you know, needed to do to make that decision and however he wants to explain that \u2014 that\u2019s just what\u2019s gonna happen.\u201d"},{"id":31776,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/warriors-unveil-new-jersey-designs-2019-20","date":"2019-09-17","title":"Warriors unveil six new jersey designs for 2019-20 season","content":" SAN FRANCISCO \u2013 The Golden State Warriors today unveiled a slate of six jerseys for the 2019-20 NBA season, the team\u2019s inaugural campaign at Chase Center, the Warriors\u2019 state-of-the-art sports and entertainment complex in San Francisco\u2019s Mission Bay neighborhood . Photos of the Warriors 2019-20 jerseys can be viewed here . All six jerseys will be available for purchase at shop.warriors.com later this fall. All Warriors practice and game jerseys, both home and away, will continue to feature the Rakuten badge on the upper left corner. As part of the Warriors\u2019 re-brand earlier this summer, four of the six jerseys feature the team\u2019s new logos and custom font. The additional jerseys are the San Francisco Classic Edition, which pulls design and font influence from the team\u2019s first three seasons in the Bay Area, and The City Classic Edition jerseys first worn in 1966-67. The slate of six jerseys includes the following: * Association Edition: A staple in the Warriors uniform arsenal, the white jersey with the team\u2019s Global Logo is a simple, globally-recognized jersey that was first introduced prior to the 2010-11 season. The 2019-20 version of the Association Edition jersey features the team\u2019s refreshed Global Logo, highlighted by an updated, more accurate portrayal of the eastern span of the Bay Bridge. * Icon Edition: A blue alternative to the Association Edition, the Warriors\u2019 Icon Edition jersey features the Warriors\u2019 blue with the team\u2019s yellow Global Logo on the chest. * The Bay \u2013 Statement Edition: The Statement Edition uniform features the team\u2019s new The Bay logo, which portrays a landscape of seaside cliffs overlooking water accompanied by an overhead fog, a scene reminiscent of the Golden Gate prior to the construction of the Golden Gate Bridge. The Warriors have played full seasons in each of The Bay\u2019s three major cities: Oakland, San Francisco and San Jose. * The Town \u2013 City Edition: A tribute to Oakland first introduced during the 2017-18 season, The Town uniform features the logo for the city of Oakland in white set on a black jersey. The uniform celebrates the Oakland community and its support for the Warriors, who played 47 of the previous 48 seasons in The Town. * San Francisco \u2013 Classic Edition: A throwback to the Warriors\u2019 original Bay Area jersey worn upon the team\u2019s arrival to San Francisco from Philadelphia in 1962, the San Francisco Classic Edition jersey features the city\u2019s namesake across the chest of the white jersey in a color palate of navy, gold and red. A yellow version of the uniform was worn by the Warriors as a throwback during the 2009-10 season. * The City \u2013 Classic Edition: Designed by the team\u2019s larger-than-life owner Franklin Mieuli in 1966-67, The City Classic Edition includes a pair of iconic San Francisco symbols, featuring the Golden Gate Bridge on the front and a cable car on the back of the yellow jersey. The Warriors have worn the throwback several times since the team\u2019s last season in San Francisco in 1970-71, most recently donning the yellow jersey during the 2015-16 campaign.

That finish wasn\u2019t lost on USA Basketball managing director Jerry Colangelo, who has overseen the program since taking it over on April 27, 2005. In an interview with SI.com\u2019s Chris Mannix, Colangelo sounded determined to get Team USA back on track on the international stage. \u201cThere has not been any disappointment around USA Basketball in a while,\u201d Colangelo told SI.com . \u201cThis will bother me until the 2020 Olympics.\u201d Next summer, Colangelo will end his 14-year tenure atop USA Basketball and has seen it win gold in the 2008, \u201912 and \u201916 Olympics. Additionally, Team USA won the FIBA World Cup title in 2010 (the U.S. team\u2019s first there since 1994) and in \u201914. Despite the disappointing finish this year, Colangelo wasn\u2019t about to draw parallels between this team and the 2002 World Cup squad that is seen as one of the low points in Team USA history. \u201cYou can\u2019t compare the two years,\u201d Colangelo told SI.com. \u201cIt\u2019s apples and oranges.\u201d He did take some issue with the NBA superstars who opted to not play in the FIBA World Cup this year. Among the NBA standouts who opted out of playing were Anthony Davis, James Harden, Damian Lillard, CJ McCollum, Bradley Beal, DeMar DeRozan and others. \u201cThe disappointment I feel is not from the guys who said they wouldn\u2019t play,\u201d Colangelo told SI.com. \u201cIt\u2019s those that said they would, and then backed out.\u201d Davis, Lillard and Harden were late withdrawals from Team USA, but that may not hurt them in being a part of the U.S. National Team come the 2020 Olympics. \u201cWe\u2019ll deal with those cases individually,\u201d Colangelo said. \u201cIt\u2019s important to field as strong a team as possible.\u201d In each of the last five major international tournaments, the U.S. ranked No. 1 in offensive efficiency. Through its first six games of the 2019 FIBA World Cup, it ranked ninth offensively. Before breaking with a 12-for-25 performance against Poland on Saturday in the seventh-place game, the Americans had shot just 33.3 percent from 3-point range, well below the NBA league average (35.5 percent), even though the 3-point distance is shorter on the FIBA floor. Though the U.S. was one of the best defensive teams in the 2019 FIBA World Cup, it couldn\u2019t turn enough stops into transition opportunities. In each of the five major tournaments that the U.S. won from 2008 to 2016, it ranked first or second in pace. Through its first six games, this U.S. team ranked 13th of 32 World Cup teams in pace (an estimated 75 possessions per 40 minutes). After the win against Poland to close out FIBA play, coach Gregg Popovich defended his team while also sounding off on the notion Team USA is always a shoo-in for gold. \u201cIf you don\u2019t win, some people will play the blame game,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cThere\u2019s no blame to be placed anywhere. They play the shame game, like we should be ashamed because we didn\u2019t win a gold medal? That\u2019s a ridiculous attitude. It\u2019s immature. It\u2019s arrogant. And it shows that whoever thinks that doesn\u2019t respect all the other teams in the world and doesn\u2019t respect that these guys did the best they could.\u201d Popovich also said it\u2019s too early to think about what USA Basketball needs to do before getting ready for the Tokyo Games. But he warned \u2014 just as two-time gold medalist Kobe Bryant did last Friday \u2014 that the days of American romps to gold are done. \u201cThere are a lot of great teams in the world,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cIt\u2019s not written in stone that the United States is supposed to walk to a championship. That\u2019s pretty old-school thinking. Even the teams that have won in the past had a lot of close calls.\u201d Next year\u2019s Olympics are earlier in the summer, so that preparation time will likely be shorter than the four weeks that this team was together before the start of the World Cup. Without the same chemistry that their opponents have, more talent \u2014 guys that can get buckets on cue \u2014 is needed. \u201cIndividually, across the board, everybody gets a lot better by playing and going through this entire process,\u201d Joe Harris said this week . \u201cYou spent 39-plus days with one of the best coaches in the world, one of the best coaches in the game in Pop. \u201cJust being around them, learning their approach to the game, being around all these great players, competing with them night in and night out, whether it\u2019s practices or games, and competing at a high level every night against some of the best players in the world, this is the best offseason preparation you can have going into the season.\u201d Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":31763,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/orlando-magic-markelle-fultz-exercise-option","date":"2019-09-16","title":"Magic exercise Markelle Fultz's option for 2020-21 season","content":" The Orlando Magic have exercised the option in Markelle Fultz\u2019s contract for the 2020-21 season, the team announced on Monday .

Companies that make clothing and shoes for the National Basketball Association players are in the crosshairs of President Donald Trump\u2019s escalating China trade wars. So, the question is, will American fans of sports stars like Los Angeles Lakers\u2019 James be willing to pay higher prices for the gear? The stakes are high as U.S. sales from sports licensed merchandise including NBA items rang up $21 billion last year, according to Licensing International, a trade group. Sales on NBAStore.com rose 15% during the 12-month period through August, according to the league. And many of the sports brands ranging from Adidas to Puma rely on China for at least some of their sourcing. Moreover, experts worry China could impose penalties on Western brands who sell there at a time when business in that country is exploding. Some also believe U.S. fans might turn to counterfeit merchandise if they don\u2019t want to pay higher prices. * LeBron, Lakers top NBA merchandise list in 2018-19   \u201cWhen you raise prices on legitimate goods, you encourage the production of illegitimate goods,\u201d said Steve Lamar, executive vice president of The American Apparel and Footwear Association, a trade group. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely seeing pressure on brands. We\u2019re just waiting for the other basketball shoe to drop.\u201d Until now, consumers were largely spared from higher prices in Trump\u2019s previous round of import taxes. That has changed. Starting Sept. 1, the U .S. government began collecting 15 percent on $112 billion in Chinese imports, on a wide array of merchandise including basketball jerseys, basketball shoes, basketballs and even hoops. Higher tariffs are set to hit another batch of Chinese products \u2014 $160 billion worth on Dec. 15 and include other sports products, according to the American Apparel & Footwear Association. President Trump tweeted Wednesday that planned tariff increases on another $250 billion in Chinese imports, which would include sports bags, would be delayed until Oct. 15, from Oct. 1. Tariff increases are set to go from 25% to 30%. Many sporting goods companies, including Adidas, Under Armour and Spaulding declined to comment on how their business is being affected by the China trade wars. But like many companies, sport brands have been diversifying their sourcing away from China to factories in Vietnam and Bangladesh for the last several years even before escalating tensions between the U.S. and China. Under Armour has been working for several years to reduce sourcing in China. \u201cWith current tariffs, we actually are not being affected very much at all, \u201d Patrick Fisk, president and chief operating officer at Under Armour told CNBC last week. \u201cWe only have 10 percent of what comes into the U.S. from China. So the current state, we\u2019re OK.\u201d Puma announced earlier this year a new multi-year partnership that will make the international sports brand an official marketing partner of the NBA. \u201cOur sector in China has been very strong. We\u2019ve been growing 15% every quarter,\u201d says Puma U.S. CEO Bjoern Gulden, noting it\u2019s the fastest growing market ahead of the U.S. and Europe. But he added, \u201cTariffs and trade wars are not good for the market. It carries uncertainty.\u201d Puma has been moving its sourcing out of China over the past two years and now the country accounts for 20 percent of its overall production. Still, Gulden says costs are going up, and he\u2019s not sure whether the company will have to raise prices. Gulden and others believe that the top end of the market may be less vulnerable than the lower end. For customers who buy sneakers ranging from $150 to $250, an increase may not hurt sales, but that could be a different story for customers who buy shoes in the $60 to $70 range, he said. Still, he says no one \u201chas an appetite for higher prices.\u201d The tensions between the U.S. and China come as many sports brands have been digging deeper into China where basketball is a massive business and the NBA\u2019s fan base is exploding through social media. The good news is that American brands including Nike who sell there say business remains strong and they haven\u2019t seen consumers in China pull back because of the strain. \u201cWe have not seen any impact on our business to-date and we continue to see strong momentum as we enter fiscal year 2020, \u201d Mark G. Parker, chairman, CEO and president of Nike told analysts during a conference call following its fiscal fourth quarter earnings in June. It reported revenue growth in China up 21% this past fiscal year. Nike says it produces about a quarter of its product in China for the globe. However, its exposure in terms of product produced in China to North America is \u201crelatively modest.\u201d There\u2019s a silver lining for sportswear makers to Trump\u2019s trade war with China, however. Puma\u2019s Gulden says that the company is using the same factories in China that used to produce merchandise for the American market for the Chinese market. Previously, factories outside of China produced goods for China. Now, Puma can stay on top of trends faster. \u201cYou are much quicker. No duty. No freight, \u201d Gulden added."},{"id":31801,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nba-popularity-china-ap","date":"2019-09-16","title":"Popularity of NBA in China seems to create endless opportunities","content":" BEIJING (AP) \u2014 Kobe Bryant went to China for the first time in 1998, making the trip to Beijing to help operate an instructional basketball clinic for about a dozen kids. The local coaches working with him didn\u2019t know a lot about the game. Barely anyone noticed that an NBA player was in town. Basketball wasn\u2019t a big deal in China. And then everything changed very quickly. The footprint of the NBA has grown at an extremely rapid pace over the last two decades in China, where more than 500 million people watched games last season and where one new streaming deal alone will pump $1.5 billion into the league\u2019s coffers over the next five years. \u201cWhen I first came here, I never thought the game in China would get to be this big,\u201d Bryant said. \u201cBut it has. And it\u2019s not going to stop.\u201d The possibilities seem endless. Could there be an NBA team in China despite the travel that would be involved? Might there be two-way player contracts between the NBA and the Chinese Basketball Association? What about the NBA constructing a team to play in China or the Chinese sending a team for a full season in the U.S.? Farfetched as all that may sound, keep in mind that 20 years ago no one envisioned the NBA-China relationship to be this big \u2014 or that it would keep growing after Yao Ming\u2019s run with the Houston Rockets ended eight years ago. The NBA has academies in China now, and the Chinese national team returned to the NBA Summer League in Las Vegas this year. \u201cIt\u2019s a good question,\u201d Golden State coach Steve Kerr said. \u201cI think the next step will probably come when the next Yao Ming comes. That would take it to a new level, more Chinese players to reach the NBA and make an impact.\u201d The marriage between the NBA and the world\u2019s most populous country is stronger than ever. NBA officials say more than 300 million Chinese people play the game and 40 million are registered to play the 2K video game. Thousands showed up this summer just to watch the sons of Dwyane Wade and LeBron James play exhibitions with the rest of their high school teammates. A trade war is happening between the U.S. and China, political tensions are escalating between the countries and it could impact the products of the league\u2019s business partners. But the game itself continues to thrive. \u201cI think sports transcends politics and I hope the NBA can continue to connect fans globally,\u201d Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban said. \u201cI don\u2019t have any reason to think our relationship won\u2019t continue to be positive.\u201d Nothing seems to be able to derail the NBA\u2019s popularity. The team that the U.S. sent to the World Cup in China didn\u2019t feature the NBA\u2019s biggest stars, yet drew sellout crowds for each of its first six games. U.S. coach Gregg Popovich was begged for autographs and selfies everywhere he went. \u201cWe\u2019ve known for a long time how big basketball has become in China, of course, but all over the world,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cIt\u2019s an international deal now. There are so many great players in so many countries. It\u2019s not a secret.\u201d Stars like James, Stephen Curry, and James Harden have a trip to China on their annual schedules \u2014 and when Wade, the recently retired guard who has a lifetime contract with Chinese shoe company Li-Ning, visited this summer one of his events had to be halted after about 10 minutes because the mall where it was happening was overflowing with people. Donovan Mitchell of the Utah Jazz has been to China twice this summer, once to promote his brand, the second time for the World Cup with USA Basketball. He sees it becoming an annual stop for him, too \u2014 and believes there is no ceiling for the game globally. \u201cMan, I couldn\u2019t tell you,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be even bigger and it\u2019s not going to be just China. It\u2019s going to be many more countries. The (relationship) between the NBA and China has been huge since I was a kid and it can only take off from there \u2026 because the passion and love is so strong.\u201d It\u2019s not a one-sided relationship; China sees reason to invest in the NBA. Joe Tsai, the co-founder of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, agreed this summer to buy the remaining 51% that he didn\u2019t already own of the Brooklyn Nets and Barclays Center from Mikhail Prokhorov in deals worth about $3.4 billion. In 2016, Lizhang Jiang, a businessman from Shanghai, bought 5% of the Minnesota Timberwolves, a stake he sold earlier this year. China also takes immense pride in players like Klay Thompson wearing Chinese brands on the court. (Thompson has a 10-year deal with Chinese shoe company Anta for a reported $80 million.) And China sent its national team to NBA Summer League this past July primarily to get ready for the World Cup, but also for exposure on the NBA stage. \u201cI think it\u2019s good for our players and good for the team,\u201d China coach Li Nan said of playing in Las Vegas. \u201cI think it\u2019s good for everyone.\u201d The NBA has opened three basketball academies in China and has seen very quick success with academies in Asia and Africa. The international influence on the league was more present this past season than ever. The NBA MVP, Giannis Antetokounmpo, is from Greece. The rookie of the year, Luka Doncic, is from Slovenia. The most improved player, Pascal Siakam, is from Cameroon. The defensive player of the year, Rudy Gobert, is from France. The All-NBA center, Nikola Jokic, is from Serbia. \u201cThis past summer, an NBA Academy prospect from China signed a contract with a National Basketball League team in Australia, becoming the first male NBA Academy prospect from China to sign a contract with a professional team,\u201d NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said. \u201cAnd on the women\u2019s side, Han Xu from the New York Liberty, who trained at the NBA Academy in Shandong, China, became the first NBA Academy prospect to be drafted into the NBA or WNBA.\u201d It hasn\u2019t happened overnight. Former Commissioner David Stern struck a deal with Chinese television to show games on tape-delay three decades ago, and once toyed with the idea of some sort of NBA-sponsored or branded league in China. Teams embrace the chance to play the annual preseason games in China because he exposure is worth the jet lag. \u201cWhen I have 76ers gear on and I walk through Shanghai, walk through Shenzhen, if I had a nickel for every time somebody said \u2018Trust the process\u2019 in perfect English I wouldn\u2019t be standing here working,\u201d Philadelphia 76ers CEO Scott O\u2019Neil said, referencing the team\u2019s motto during its rebuilding phase of recent years. \u201cWe\u2019re very much a part of the fabric of China.\u201d None of this seemed possible 20 years ago or so, when Bryant made that first trip. Now fans can\u2019t get enough. \u201cWhen you come here, you feel it from the fans, their energy, people at the hotel, people just walking around,\u201d Kerr said in China during the World Cup. \u201cEverybody just seems very excited about basketball.\u201d Same goes for the game\u2019s future in China."},{"id":31767,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-nets-hiring-david-levy-ceo","date":"2019-09-16","title":"Report: Nets hiring former Turner president David Levy as CEO","content":" The Brooklyn Nets are continuing their offseason makeover with another change in the front office by reportedly hiring David Levy. Levy, the former president of Turner, will soon become the new CEO of the Nets, reports Adrian Wojnarowsk of ESPN . Levy\u2019s move to the Nets is expected to become official once Joseph Tsai\u2019s new majority ownership of the franchise is approved at the NBA\u2019s Board of Governors meeting this week. Levy left WarnerMedia , which operates NBA.com and NBA Digital , in March of this year after serving as president since 2013. He also worked for the company for nearly 33 years. In mid-August , the Nets confirmed that team owner Mikhail Prokhorov was selling his controlling interest in the team as well as in the Nets\u2019 arena, Barclays Center, to Tsai. Per the Nets, the transaction is expected to take place by the end of September and requires approval by the NBA\u2019s Board of Governors. In the interim, the Nets\u2019 current management team will continue to run Barclays Center and the team under new ownership. CEO of BSE Global Brett Yomark will oversee the transition to new ownership and then will depart from his role after that. Tsai, the co-founder of the China-based global internet company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., paid $1 billion for his 49% share last April. The deal allowed Tsai to acquire further shares of the team before the start of the 2021-22 season for an additional $1.35 billion. If Tsai signs off on the deal, he will be exercising his right to buy out Prokhorov two seasons early. Per Forbes, Tsai\u2019s estimated net worth is $9.3 billion . Prokhorov bought the Nets in 2010 and the Russian oversaw the Nets\u2019 move from New Jersey to Brooklyn. The sale of shares to Tsai in 2018 did not include the Barclays Center, which Prokhorov\u2019s company will continue to own. However, the New York Post reported in March that Tsai was in talks to buy Barclays as well as the new Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale, N.Y. This summer has been a massive one for the Nets, as they reeled two of the biggest names in free agency : forward Kevin Durant and guard Kyrie Irving. Those additions \u2014 plus other offseason moves by Brooklyn to shore up its depth \u2014 have the Nets looking like a favorite to rise quickly in the Eastern Conference. That comes after a 42-40 season and playoff appearance in 2018-19 that confounded most experts.

Old-school feel, modern-day prices. This one carries a southwest flavor, complete with silver-and-turquoise jewelry, horned animal skulls and plenty of well-oiled leather. Every now and then, however, a pair of visitors will take a certain turn into one of the mercifully shaded corridors. Amid a tiled hall that is home to local artists, something authentic can be found. Not by art-purveyors or tourists, but by those familiar with pre-glory days NBA basketball. Those without such knowledge will see only an elderly pair of all-but-indistinguishable twins. Both sport the same strong jawlines, parted white hair, and brown loafers. One of them (usually Tom) will look up and issue as friendly a greeting as you can imagine. \u201cCome on in!\u201d It is only when Tom or his brother, Dick, stand up, that the visitor(s) might begin to wonder if there is something more than the penciled and painted art that surrounds the pair of 6-foot-5 brothers. * * * Decades before the Gasol brothers arrived from Spain, before Rick Barry\u2019s sons blossomed in California, before Horace and Harvey Grant became Georgia\u2019s NBA pride, Dick and Tom Van Arsdale were doing what many school-age Indiana boys did: playing on a homemade hoop nailed to a tree in the backyard. It was best out of three \u2026 unless Dick won two. Then Tom would demand they play one more. Their \u201ccourt\u201d only added to the competition. Instead of hardwood, they dribbled on a cleared circle of dirt. The backboard was a pair of two-by-eights nailed together. The base of the tree was unyielding. Ball and body control were absolute musts in what became the young Van Arsdales\u2019 personal proving grounds. \u201cWe\u2019d play one-on-one against each other,\u201d Tom recalled. \u201cEvery day,\u201d Dick added seamlessly. \u201cWe\u2019d get into a fight every day,\u201d Tom confesses. \u201cWe\u2019d slug each other, but we\u2019d never hit each other in the face.\u201d Beating each other gave way to teaming up and beating their cousins, then their friends. \u201cDick and I never lost,\u201d Tom proudly laughed. \u201cWe had so much fun.\u201d Hoops and pride went hand in hand for the Indiana brothers, who devoured every televised second of Hoosier basketball and were only 10 years old when Branch McCracken coached Indiana to the 1953 NCAA title. They daydreamed of donning white and red in Bloomington, Ind. Even a recruiting letter from legendary UCLA coach John Wooden didn\u2019t sway them. Well before their senior year, two-point overtime loss in the state championship game, the Van Arsdales were committed Hoosiers. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have to be recruited,\u201d Tom said. \u201cWe knew we were going to Indiana.\u201d As they discuss their pre-Indiana days, an elderly couple enters the Van Arsdale art studio. Not until Tom greets them does the woman realize the identical twins are real people. \u201cOh my goodness, I thought you were works of art or something!\u201d Hoosier fans likely thought something similar as they watched Dick and Tom put up nearly identical stats over the next three seasons. Coming off a 19-5 junior season at Indiana (1964-65), the Van Arsdales weren\u2019t just Indiana poster boys. Their hard-nosed yet productive style had made them intriguing talents for an NBA gearing up for its first round of expansion. Harry Gallatin may have been a Knicks legend (and then-current coach), but the former seven-time NBA All-Star was a Midwesterner at heart. That may have played a role in his liking of Dick Van Arsdale, whom he and assistant coach Red Holzman treated to dinner before the 1965 NBA Draft . The meal must have confirmed New York\u2019s opinion. They called Dick after the Draft to let him know they had taken him 10th overall. Naturally, Detroit took Tom 11th. Just like that, the Van Arsdales were NBA-bound \u2014 but they would do so without each other until the very end of their NBA journey. The NBA consisted of just 10 teams when Dick and Tom debuted. That meant every team had multiple All-Star talents and, in most cases, a future Hall of Famer. No game felt like a gimme, which was just as well since neither Van Arsdale ever played like one. In Detroit, Tom had immediate respect for future Hall of Famer Dave DeBusschere, who was both his teammate and his coach. \u201cI think he was one of the toughest players I ever played with or against,\u201d Tom said. \u201cHe was good. \u201d When Detroit traded him to the Cincinnati Royals (now the Sacramento Kings franchise) two and a half seasons later, Tom Van Arsdale found himself starting alongside Oscar Robertson being coached by Bob Cousy. Dick Van Arsdale, meanwhile, enjoyed beginning his career with Walt Bellamy, Willis Reed and Walt Frazier in New York. \u201cThese guys just meant so much to us. They still do. I get goosebumps thinking about who we played with and against.\u201d Yet the guy that stands out most to them \u2014 and still does if you include modern-day legends \u2014 wore No. 6 in Boston. \u201cDick and I say that if we pick a team right now, we\u2019re both taking Bill Russell,\u201d Tom Van Arsdale said. \u201cWhen you played Boston, if you drove to the basket, Russell never let you go. He never let you go.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t really have any place to hang my hat with a team,\u201d Tom explained. \u201cI played longer with the Cincinnati Royals than anybody, but they\u2019re in Sacramento now. I benefit from everybody knowing Dick, here. I don\u2019t have that same home feeling about my team. My number\u2019s not hanging from anybody\u2019s rafters.\u201d Maybe it\u2019s not, but zoom out, and Dick and Tom are as even a match as you\u2019ll find in NBA history. As rookies, both of the Van Arsdales faced Russell\u2019s Celtics 11 times each in 1965-66. \u201cCan you imagine playing against Russell 11 times as a rookie?\u201d Tom Van Arsadale said, still aghast at the experience. \u201cHoly [expletive].\u201d Dick Van Arsdale\u2019s memory of Russell is much more specific and involved a sequence that sounds familiar to modern-day victims of LeBron James. \u201cI rebound the ball and I was going all the way. Russell was noplace near where I was. I went to the basket, boom. He was all over it. He took me out of the play like that .\u201d As jaw-dropping as their co-workers could be, the Van Arsdales began to carve out their own NBA reputations \u2014 and accolades. In Cincinnati, Tom Van Arsdale was on the receiving end of passes from Robertson and Tiny Archibald. He averaged more than 19 points per game from 1968-72, earning three All-Star nods in the process. After three seasons with the Knicks, Dick Van Arsdale went to the newly formed Phoenix Suns and was an All-Star from 1968-71 \u2014 two of which (1970, \u201971) overlapped with his brother. He did it while becoming just the fifth non-center to average more than 20 ppg and shoot better than 50% in a single season, joining Robertson, Terry Dischinger, Bailey Howell and Jerry West. \u201cI was the better shooter,\u201d Dick laughed. While that was true in their NBA careers, what Tom Van Arsdale really envied of his brother was his postseason experience. His various NBA stops \u2014 Detroit, Cincinnati, Philadelphia and Atlanta \u2014 never enjoyed playoff berths. Dick Van Arsdale, however, enjoyed two short trips to the playoffs with the Knicks before landing in the one place he wanted no part of. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to go to Phoenix,\u201d Dick Van Arsdale openly admits. In 1968, the doors opened for expansion teams in Milwaukee and Phoenix . Dick Van Arsdale, who was on the verge of a Knicks revival with Reed and Frazier, was left unprotected in the expansion draft. The Suns leaped at the chance to secure the 25-year-old Van Arsdale. After a 16-66 inaugural season, Phoenix struck gold by winning the rights to the formerly blackballed Connie Hawkins. Hawkins teamed up with Dick Van Arsdale and Gail Goodrich to lead Phoenix to its first playoff berth \u2014 and a clash with West, Wilt Chamberlain and Elgin Baylor\u2019s Los Angeles Lakers. The fledgling Suns took a 3-1 series lead, thanks in no small part to Van Arsdale\u2019s 25 points on 10-of-16 shooting in Game 4 . But then the Lakers flexed their star power and stormed back to win the series in Game 7. Dick Van Arsdale waited six seasons before returning to the playoffs, this time as the veteran sixth man for a younger Suns team led by Rookie of the Year Alvan Adams and future Hall of Famer Paul Westphal. It seemed like every time Van Arsdale had a good game, Phoenix scored a crucial playoff win. That included his 20-point game off the bench against the defending-champion Golden State Warriors in Game 4 of the Western Conference finals. On June 4, 1976 , the 33-year-old Dick Van Arsdale played 35 minutes in the famous triple-overtime Finals Game 5 against the Celtics. It was the closest either brother would come to an NBA title. The Van Arsdales are classic Midwesterners. They work hard, leave no stone unturned, have no regrets. That\u2019s why Tom Van Arsdale, who thought of retiring in 1976, answered the Suns\u2019 call to play for them immediately following their Finals appearance. Being reunited with his brother was all well and good, but what mattered to him was a chance at playoff success. It didn\u2019t happen. Injuries to key starters and an overall lack of scoring saw Phoenix miss the postseason in 1977. For Dick and Tom Van Arsdale, however, their NBA journeys had merely ended where they began: together. Another elderly couple enters the Van Arsdale\u2019s art studio and this time, the husband is the one who speaks up. \u201cYou\u2019re the ex-NBA players?\u201d \u201cYeah!\u201d Tom cheerfully replies. \u201cDid both of you play for Phoenix or just one of you?\u201d Though the answer is both, the question is understandable. Dick\u2019s nickname among locals is \u201cThe Original Sun.\u201d Much as he and his brother were as college kids in Indiana, Dick is a local source of pride in Phoenix. Their first player. Scored their first basket (a hard-driving righty layup). First All-Star. Member of their first playoff and Finals teams. The community nearly lost its living legend to a stroke in 2005. Doctors scanned his brain and declared half of it dead. For the next few years, he deferred speaking to his brother. In formal interview settings he still does, though he\u2019s quick to break his word if topics he loves \u2014 Russell, Hawkins, the 1976 Finals, etc. \u2014 come up in the conversation. His recovery is beyond what was expected. Still, it was a jarring setback for a man who spoke so candidly as a teammate, a coach, and a radio commentator. Art was his early escape on the road to recovery, and he hasn\u2019t let go since. Tom joined Dick in their late-blooming art creation, and is there for him as they ever have been for each other. When a word escapes Dick\u2019s muscle memory, his older-by-a-minute brother fills in the gaps. He doesn\u2019t need to nearly as often as he did just a few years ago, and even when he does, it\u2019s with the casual ease of a twin who has been on the same page with his brother for a lifetime. Yet now, with a local Phoenician expressing his pleasure at meeting \u201cThe Original Sun,\u201d Tom freely admits a gentle jealousy of his \u201clittle brother.\u201d All told, the Van Arsdale twins were probably the most individually and evenly accomplished brothers the league saw until the Marc and Pau Gasol. Tom and Dick, however, remember it much more simply than that. They remember, when double-headers in New York were the norm, they would grab a much-needed bite to eat whenever both their teams were in the Big Apple. They remember being shocked at discovering that Chamberlain would occasionally carry a raw steak in his suitcase, that Robertson and Hawkins were even better people than they were players. They remember when, in their final season in Phoenix, Adams would refer to them as triplets: Dick Van, Tom Van and Al-van. And on the occasions they\u2019re not actively remembering those moments, odds are someone will enter their studio and ask a question that spurs them back to recall. \u201cIt was a great ride,\u201d Tom said gratefully."},{"id":31849,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/world-cup-finale-spain-outlasts-field","date":"2019-09-15","title":"In wide-open World Cup, Spain rises above to erase memories of disappointing 2014","content":" BEIJING \u2014 This was supposed to happen five years ago. In 2014, Spain was hosting the FIBA Basketball World Cup. They had won silver at the Olympics two years prior, and they had a stacked roster, with a lot more continuity than that of the United States, and with 10 players who had played in the NBA at one point. They also had 2017 Euroleague MVP Sergio Llull, who could be in the NBA if he wanted. It was the best team in the history of Spanish basketball. But in the quarterfinals against France, Spain shot 32 percent and saw its tournament end two games too early. We never got the much anticipated, USA-Spain matchup in front of a raucous crowd at the Palacio de los Deportes de la Comunidad in Madrid. The headline in one newspaper the next morning was \u201cDesastre de Espa\u00f1a en su Mundial.\u201d Five years later, with a team that had just six players with NBA experience and with nothing close to the expectations of 2014, Spain has won its second world championship, defeating Argentina 75-55 in the gold medal game on Sunday. That Spain beat Argentina was not a huge surprise. That both of those teams outlasted Australia, France, Serbia and the United States certainly was. \u201cWhen you look at the rosters,\u201d France\u2019s Evan Fournier said after his team won the bronze medal earlier on Sunday, \u201cdo I really feel like the best two teams are Spain and Argentina? No, but they played better. They won, so they deserve everything they have. But that\u2019s FIBA basketball. It\u2019s just one game and if you make the adjustment, you start making shots, you can beat anyone. That\u2019s what\u2019s so beautiful about it, but also that\u2019s [why] it\u2019s so hard to win.\u201d This was definitely a World Cup where the \u201canything can happen on any given night\u201d clich\u00e9 was applicable, even more than in 2014, when the United States won its fourth of five straight major tournaments. Still, that it was Serbia, and not Spain, that the U.S. beat that year was a stunner, especially because Spain had cruised through its first six games, beating France and Serbia by a total of 40 points in pool play . \u201cI felt that we had the best team in 2014, but we had one bad game,\u201d Marc Gasol said after winning his second championship in a little over three months. \u201cThat\u2019s the kind of tournament it is. In the FIBA tournament, you have one bad game and you\u2019re out.\u201d This year, it was Serbia that looked like the most dominant team early on, winning its first four games by an average of 41 points. And then, after losing to Spain in the second round, the Serbs were upset by Argentina in the quarterfinals. Argentina\u2019s magic didn\u2019t run out there. In the semis, they beat the team \u2014 France \u2014 that knocked out the Americans. After dominating the U.S., France\u2019s Rudy Gobert was ineffective against a team that didn\u2019t have a single NBA player. Argentina had seemingly benefited from playing in a weak group in pool play, but then they made an anything-can-happen run all the way to a silver medal. \u201cIt\u2019s surreal to us to be in the final of the Worlds,\u201d Argentina\u2019s Patricio Garino said after his team\u2019s incredible run finally came to an end against Spain. \u201cWe believed in each other, but to be in this position is kind of crazy.\u201d That Turkey team that would have beat the United States had it not gone 0-for-4 from the free throw line in the closing seconds of overtime? It went on to lose to the Czech Republic and New Zealand, and its only wins were over Japan and Montenegro (by just five points), teams that finished the World Cup a combined 1-9. Australia, meanwhile, will look back and shake their heads. They were in control of their semifinal game against Spain for most of regulation, only to lose in double overtime. And in the bronze medal game, the Boomers blew a 15-point, second-half lead to France. Anything can happen in any given quarter, apparently. France\u2019s Nicolas Batum saw it coming, especially with the USA not bringing its best roster. \u201cI said before the tournament that it\u2019s going to be the weirdest and maybe the greatest FIBA tournament in a while,\u201d Batum said, \u201cbecause it was so open. And that\u2019s what happened. We got so many teams that can reach the final or get a medal or have a big goal. It was so open, and there were so many surprises in big games. That was fun to watch.\u201d On Aug. 17, Spain lost to the United States in an exhibition game in Los Angeles. Four weeks later, the Americans were already home unpacking their bags as the Spaniards were receiving their gold medals. \u201cI\u2019m not that surprised,\u201d Gasol said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to say that it was our main goal. But I believed that we could do it, because once I saw the U.S., once you started breaking down every single team \u2014 you don\u2019t do that until you\u2019re here \u2014 I\u2019m like, \u2018OK, well, I think we can beat anybody.\u2019 And then once you have that mindset, you get one game against the best teams and let\u2019s go.\u201d World Cup MVP Ricky Rubio, who averaged 16.4 points and 6.0 assists over the tournament (with 20 and seven on Sunday), wouldn\u2019t speak to his team\u2019s expectations in 2014 vs. those of this year, but said that he had a different mental state this time around. \u201cPersonally, it was totally different,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cHere I came with a mind set. The mind set was winning the gold medal, no matter what. I know that it was one of the hardest things to do, but I was telling Coach [Sergio] Scariolo that I was working out this summer just thinking about the gold medal, and I was ready to win it. In 2014, we had so many weapons. Sometimes, it doesn\u2019t work out our way.\u201d Sometimes, it does. And though anything can happen on any given night, one team is going to be the last one standing. This World Cup could have gone any number of ways, and ultimately, it went the way of Spain. \u201cWe weren\u2019t the most talented team,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t the biggest team. But we were the team that had the biggest heart. And we showed it tonight. We showed it the whole tournament. I couldn\u2019t be more proud to have the teammates and the coaching staff that we have. We feel like this is going to go down as a memory for us as a family. That\u2019s bigger than just winning the World Cup. It\u2019s a family for life.\u201d * * * John Schuhmann is a staff writer for NBA.com. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

They were ready to go home. They just weren\u2019t ready to go their separate ways. >> Team USA reflects on disappointing World Cup For USA Basketball, summer ended Saturday with an 87-74 win over Poland in the seventh-place game at the World Cup, the lowest finish ever by a U.S. team in a major international tournament. Donovan Mitchell finished with 16 points and 10 assists, Joe Harris scored 14 and the U.S. wrapped up its stay in China with a 6-2 record. And when it was over, as his players signed each other\u2019s jerseys in the locker room as souvenirs, U.S. coach Gregg Popovich insisted this team has nothing to be ashamed about. \u201cIf you don\u2019t win, some people will play the blame game,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cThere\u2019s no blame to be placed anywhere. They play the shame game, like we should be ashamed because we didn\u2019t win a gold medal? That\u2019s a ridiculous attitude. It\u2019s immature. It\u2019s arrogant. And it shows that whoever thinks that doesn\u2019t respect all the other teams in the world and doesn\u2019t respect that these guys did the best they could.\u201d Khris Middleton had 13 points, six rebounds and six assists for the Americans. Derrick White scored 12 and Harrison Barnes added 10 for the U.S., which led by 17 at the half but had to stave off a Poland rally in the final minutes. The mantra the Americans carried into Saturday was to finish the trip the right way, and they got it done. \u201cI\u2019m going to look back on it and have unbelievable memories,\u201d Harris said. \u201cThese are friendships that are very unique, where we\u2019ve formed a special bond going through what we just did together. \u2026 Some of these guys who I might not have had a chance to know otherwise are now some of my closest friends. It\u2019s unique in that way.\u201d There was little to play for except pride \u2014 and the Americans were playing with the realization that for some of them, it easily could be their last time wearing the red, white and blue uniforms with \u201cUSA\u201d across the chest. The roster for the U.S. trip to the Tokyo Olympics next summer is likely to look considerably different than this one. \u201cFor me, this is an amazing experience,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cEverybody likes to look at the end goal, but when you sit back and reflect, I played on Team USA. That\u2019s incredible for me. I think that in itself is amazing. So yes, it was definitely worth it.\u201d Poland coach Mike Taylor also found the World Cup most worthwhile \u2014 especially Saturday. He\u2019s an American, lives in Florida, is proud of how far he\u2019s taken Poland\u2019s program, knows many of the words to the Polish national anthem \u2014 but mouthed along with the words to \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d when it played pregame. \u201cI\u2019ve been coaching with national teams, four years with the Czech Republic and now six years with Poland,\u201d Taylor said, his voice cracking slightly. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of anthems you\u2019ve heard. And I never imagined in my life that I would hear the United States. It means a lot and it\u2019s not something you take for granted.\u201d Mateusz Ponitka scored 18 points, Adam Waczynski had 17 and Louisville-born A.J. Slaughter finished with 15 for Poland (4-4), which was in the World Cup for the first time since 1967. \u201cYou look down at the U.S. bench, you see one of the greatest coaches ever in Coach Pop, you see Steve Kerr, you see all those guys and you can\u2019t believe it,\u201d Slaughter said. \u201cIt was a lasting moment that I\u2019ll have for the rest of my life.\u201d Popovich said it\u2019s too early to think about what USA Basketball needs to do before getting ready for the Tokyo Games.

After Spain opened the game with a 14-2 lead, Argentina answered with an 11-0 run, but the Spanish took back control, led by as many as 17 early in the second quarter, and went up by 22 with a 12-0 run early in the third. Neither team shot particularly well from the perimeter, but Spain outscored Argentina, 44-30, in the paint.  Ricky Rubio led six Spanish players in double-figures with 20 points, shooting 6-for-11 from the field. Gasol shot just 2-for-9, but finished with 14 points, seven rebounds and seven assists. Gasol and Rudy Fernandez are the only players remaining from Spain\u2019s previous world championship, which came in 2006, with a win over Greece in the title game. He scored only two points in that game, but provided a valuable 17 minutes in place of his brother Pau, who broke his foot in the semifinals. The Toronto Raptors center becomes the second player to win an NBA title and a FIBA world gold medal in the same year, joining Lamar Odom \u2014 who did it for the Los Angeles Lakers and USA Basketball in 2010. Gasol is also the 19th to win either an NBA or WNBA crown along with a gold medal, either of the Olympic or World Cup variety, in the same year. And he\u2019s the first to accomplish that feat while representing a nation other than the U.S. Gasol was among the five players named to the FIBA World Cup 2019 All-Star 5, joining Rubio, Luis Scola (Argentina), Bogdan Bogdanovic (Serbia) and Evan Fournier (France). Rubio also earned MVP honors for his dominant tournament run. Argentina\u2019s Gabriel Deck led all scorers with 24 points. Scola, who averaged 19.3 points over his team\u2019s first seven games of the tournament, was held scoreless until draining a pair of free throws at the 3:29 mark of the third quarter. He finished with eight points, making just one of his 10 shots from the field. Earlier on Sunday, France came back from 15 points down in the third quarter to beat Australia, 67-59, for the bronze medal. Nando de Colo led all scorers with 19 points, back-up point guard Andrew Albicy hit a pair of big threes down the stretch, and Boston Celtics rookie Vincent Poirier provided quality minutes in the comeback. Seven teams \u2013 Argentina, Australia, France, Iran, Nigeria, Spain and the United States \u2013 qualified for the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo by finishing as the top (or second-best) teams in their regions at the World Cup. As the host nation, Japan has also qualified. The other four entrants will be determined by qualifying tournaments early in the summer of 2020. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

It was France\u2019s second straight bronze medal in the event and matches its best finish. Australia, which led for most of the game, failed again to win any medal in a major international basketball tournament. The Boomers are 0-4 in Olympic bronze-medal games, and now 0-1 in the World Cup \u2014 previously known as the world championship. Nando De Colo scored 19 to lead France with 16 from Evan Fournier. Joe Ingles had 17 for Australia with 15 from Patty Mills. Utah Jazz center Ruby Gobert, who scored 21 against the United States in a quarterfinal victory, scored only two points \u2014 but the French prevailed anyway, and will be the only medal-winning team from 2014 to win another this year. \u201cIt means everything,\u201d Gobert said of the bronze. \u201cObviously it\u2019s not the one we wanted. We all know that. But being able to come back \u2014 we\u2019re the only team that was on the podium five years ago and on the podium now. So it shows our heart, shows the commitment we have and we\u2019re only going to get better from that.\u201d Australia led for the entire game until France inched ahead 47-46 on two free throws with 9:01 left in the game. France continued to surge with Australia looking exhausted \u2014 much like its loss in the semifinals against Spain. France\u2019s poor shooting and Australia\u2019s defense meant a low-scoring first half, which Australia led 30-21. France shot only 25 percent from the floor, with many shots missed from inside. Australia built a 40-25 lead to open the third quarter. But then France finally awakened, and cut the lead to 46-42 after three quarters with Nando De Colo, Fournier and Vincent Poirier carrying the scoring load heading into the deciding final quarter. France held Andrew Bogut to five points and Matthew Dellavedova to four, another big reason for the win. \u201cIt feels good to finish on a good note,\u201d Fournier said. \u201cWhen you see Australia, the players, Bogut, Dellavedova, I know those guys and it\u2019s awful for them. But that\u2019s definitely what we didn\u2019t want, to finish the tournament feeling like (crap) like that. We finished third before and it felt great. This one is kind of different because we felt like we could have done better.\u201d France: Fournier took his medal off shortly after the award ceremony and handed it to his father as a gift. \u201cI already have one,\u201d the Orlando Magic guard said. \u2026 Nicolas Batum had six assists for the winners. Australia: Players walked off the court quickly and quietly when the game was over, no one saying a word to the assembled reporters waiting for them on the way to the locker room. Many had their heads bowed, clearly frustrated. \u2026 Ingles was 6 for 6 from 2-point range, 1 for 5 from 3-point range. Australia will have to agonize over another chance for its first World Cup or Olympic medal slipping away. The Boomers are now 0-5 in bronze-medal games on the sport\u2019s top international stages \u2014 with all four of the previous chances coming at the Olympics. They lost 89-88 to Spain in the 2016 bronze game at Rio, 89-71 to Lithuania at the 2000 Sydney Games, 80-74 to Lithuania at Atlanta in 1996 and 78-49 to the U.S. at Seoul in 1988. France took silver in the 1948 and 2000 Olympics. France was also the bronze medalist in the last World Championship (now World Cup) in 2014 and finished fourth in 1954. This was only the third meeting between Australia and France in a major event. Before Sunday, the teams split two matchups \u2014 both at the Olympics. Australia beat France 87-66 in the group stage at the Rio Games in 2016, and France prevailed over the then-host Aussies 76-52 in the semifinals of the 2000 Sydney Games.

It wasn\u2019t easy. Everything was very tough; the preparation, the qualification and the competition.\u201d There was no immediate indication who will take over one of Europe\u2019s \u2014 and international basketball\u2019s \u2014 most respected teams. Djordjevic, a former player, took over in 2013 and built success from the start. Serbia had won silver medals in the last three major international tournaments under Djordjevic, including the Rio de Janeiro Olympics three years ago. Serbia also won silver in the 2014 World Championship (now called the World Cup), and in the 2017 EuroBasket (the European championship). The losses in the final of the Olympics and the 2014 World Championship were against the United States. The EuroBasket defeat was against Slovenia. Serbia failed in this World Cup, not only to win enough, but to book a place in next year\u2019s Tokyo Olympics. Serbia will have to win an Olympic qualifying tournament next summer to advance. \u201cIt will be tough, definitely,\u201d said Bogdan Bogdanovic, the Sacramento Kings shooting guard who led Serbia on Saturday with 31 points. \u201cThere were many good teams upset at this tournament and I know they\u2019ll be pretty motivated for the Olympics.\u201d Serbia and the United States were probably the two favorites going into China \u2014 perhaps Serbia even more than the under-strength Americans whose seventh-place finish was the lowest ever by a U.S. team at a major international tournament.

Spain and Argentina will play for the championship on Sunday. Eight teams have already reached next year\u2019s Tokyo Olympics.

Other maximum-fine levels could be raised significantly as well, provided the league\u2019s board of governors approves the measures Sept. 20. The league sent a memo to teams on Friday detailing the proposed fines, according to the person who spoke on condition of anonymity because the details were not to be released publicly. The memo addresses what the league called a \u201cwidespread perception that many of the league\u2019s rules are being broken on a frequent basis\u201d when it comes to tampering, salary cap matters and the timing of free agency discussions. So the league wants to hit rule breakers where it hurts most \u2014 the checkbook, and possibly beyond. The league wants fines raised in part to reflect the 600% increase in league revenue and the 1,100% increase in franchise value since the fine ceilings were last touched in 1996. In addition, teams will have to require its governor, top basketball operations executive and negotiators to certify annually that they did not talk to free agents or their representatives before the league rules allow. And with every player contract signed, each team\u2019s governor will have to certify that no unauthorized benefits were offered and no rules were broken. \u201cIt\u2019s pointless, at the end of the day, to have rules that we can\u2019t enforce,\u201d NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said in July after the board of governors met and talked about ways to adjust that process in an effort to ensure fairness across the league. The Athletic first reported the memo\u2019s existence. Fines for tampering with players or team personnel could go as high as $10 million, double the current limit. If a team enters into an unauthorized deal with a player, it can be fined up to $6 million \u2014 and the player can get hit with a $250,000 fine as well. Statements or conduct detrimental to the NBA could come with a $5 million fine now, up from the previous ceiling of $1 million. And a rule violation with no specific penalty could merit a $10 million fine, up from $2.5 million \u2014 the amount that Silver fined former Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling while banning him for life from the NBA in 2014 after he was found to have made racist remarks. The league also has other penalties within its reach, such as forfeiture or transfer of draft picks, suspensions, voiding of contracts and prohibiting teams from hiring the person they tampered with. Silver said in July that changes have to be made to the free-agent process after several deals were clearly struck before the negotiating period started on June 30 at 6 p.m. EDT. In theory, teams couldn\u2019t talk to free agents before that time \u2014 which would mean that actually striking deals before then would be impossible. The NBA has been largely powerless to stop the practice, which has gone on for years and seemed to be particularly out of control this summer. In the first 90 minutes of free agency this summer, at least $1.4 billion in contracts were committed to across the league \u2014 and those were just the ones known about."},{"id":31850,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/fiba-world-cup-gold-medal-preview-argentina-spain","date":"2019-09-14","title":"Luis Scola, Marc Gasol behind surprise FIBA World Cup final","content":" BEIJING \u2014 After Argentina came up empty on its first two possessions of its 2019 FIBA World Cup semifinal against France on Friday, Luis Scola grabbed an Evan Fournier miss. Scola saw Rudy Gobert had chased the offensive board under the basket, and raced the other way. It wasn\u2019t the fastest of fast breaks, but it ended with the 39-year-old Scola taking both a bump and a hit on the arm from France guard Frank Ntilikina, finishing through the contact for an and-one that gave Argentina its first three points. On the next possession, Argentina\u2019s Marcos Delia blocked Gobert, and the ball ended up in Scola\u2019s hands. Again, he took off. And with the ball, he outpaced France\u2019s Amath M\u2019Baye, finishing over Fournier to give Argentina a 5-2 lead. \u201cThat was smooth, huh?\u201d quipped the ageless Scola. \u201cI was fast!\u201d * World Cup: Scola lifts Argentina to final * World Cup: Spain reaches final round For the second straight World Cup, France pulled off a major upset in the quarterfinals, only to lose in the semis. This time, it was because Scola \u2014 who first played for the Argentine senior national team in 1999, when Ntilikina was but 1 year old \u2014 and his teammates were a step ahead of Gobert and the French all night. Scola finished with 28 points and 13 rebounds; Gobert: Three points, 11 boards. Afterward, Argentine forward Patricio Garino was asked if Scola ever ceases to amaze him. \u201cNever,\u201d Garino answered. \u201cI\u2019m not the only one. The whole world is still amazed by what he\u2019s doing. After all these years, it\u2019s really impressive.\u201d And so Argentina (7-0) will meet Spain (7-0) for the World Cup title on Sunday (8 a.m. ET) in a bit of a throwback game, and one nobody could have predicted at the beginning of this tournament. Both teams have young contributors, but they\u2019re led by Scola and the 34-year-old Marc Gasol, respectively. For his part, Gasol first played for the Spanish national team in 2006, and posted a game-high 33 points in Spain\u2019s double-overtime, semifinal victory over Australia on Friday. Afterward, Spanish head coach Sergio Scariolo explained how the experience of his team\u2019s core \u2014 Gasol, Ricky Rubio, Sergio Llull, Rudy Fernandez and Victor Claver \u2014 paid off down the stretch against the Boomers. \u201cWinning feeds the ability to keep winning,\u201d Scariolo said. \u201cThe more quarterfinals, semifinals, finals you play, and the more you win, the more you know how to do it, how to manage it and how to win it.\u201d And because those veterans keep coming back to play for the national team, the younger players, like Juancho and Wily Hernangomez, benefit. \u201cSome of our players, the five that finished the game, have been in many of those games,\u201d Scariolo said. \u201cAnd they are great leaders for the rest of the players.\u201d Having played with the Toronto Raptors until late June and now entering a contract year, Gasol had more of an excuse to stay home than any of the dozens of American and Canadian NBA players who declined or withdrew from the squads that ultimately had disappointing results here in China. But dedication and duty to one\u2019s national team is just a different thing outside of North America. \u201cI\u2019m very fortunate,\u201d Gasol said about the opportunity to win two championships in the span of three months (which Scariolo \u2014 a Raptors assistant \u2014 has as well). \u201cI know that committing to the national team this summer would not be easy physically, because we were so lucky to stretch our season and [come] away with a championship. But it\u2019s completely worth it, and not because we\u2019re playing in the final game. \u201cIt\u2019s because of the responsibility of passing along that commitment, that loyalty to the team, those values that we were taught through so many years with older players. Now it\u2019s our turn to pass on that legacy to the next generation. That\u2019s not talent. That\u2019s just commitment, because when you come to the national team for 8, 10 weeks during the summer, it\u2019s not very practical, because you don\u2019t get to work on your game, you don\u2019t get to recover, you don\u2019t get to work on your body like you would if you had close to 20 weeks off. You\u2019re committing to a lot of time and to your teammates. And it\u2019s completely worth it.\u201d  Scola\u2019s season in China ended back in March, but he shares the same commitment, and the same passion for playing with his countrymen. Scola is still going, with the rest of Argentina\u2019s \u201cGolden Generation\u201d having retired. At the conclusion of Argentina\u2019s win over France, he turned toward the crowd and pointed to the \u201cArgentina\u201d on the front of his jersey before celebrating with his teammates. \u201cWe have fun out there,\u201d Garino explained. \u201cEverything pulses together when we all know each other and have that chemistry on the court. It\u2019s simple. It\u2019s fun. We have no pressure. We are here to win, obviously, but to have fun.\u201d Argentina isn\u2019t just a cohesive unit offensively, where it ranks 10th at the World Cup, having scored an estimated 112 points per 100 possessions. Through Friday\u2019s semifinals, Argentina has the tournament\u2019s No. 1 defense, having allowed an estimated 91 points per 100. Spain also ranks higher defensively (3rd; 92 allowed per 100) than it does offensively (13th; 109 scored per 100). With the United States\u2019 streak of five major tournament titles having come to an end, we\u2019re going to crown a new world champion, though both of these nations have won this event before. Spain won gold at the 2006 World Championship, beating the team (Greece) that beat the United States in the semifinals that year. Argentina won the inaugural World Championship, playing at home in 1950. And no, Scola did not play for that team. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

Once the United States Men\u2019s National Team beat Brazil in its final pool play game at the FIBA World Cup, it had qualified for the Olympics. Once it lost to France in the quarterfinals on Wednesday, its run of five straight major tournament titles had come to an end with no shot at a medal. And once it lost to Serbia on Thursday, it was doomed to the second worst tournament finish in USA Basketball history, with the only worse result coming when a team of junior college players went 0-4 at the 2001 FIBA Americas tournament. But the U.S. beat Poland 87-74 on Saturday to finish seventh at the World Cup and put an end to its first two-game losing streak since 2002. Only nine Americans played, with Kemba Walker (neck) joining Jayson Tatum and Marcus Smart on the sideline. Donovan Mitchell led the way with 16 points and 10 assists. Gregg Popovich said afterward that there\u2019s neither shame nor blame to be distributed following the Americans\u2019 worst finish in a tournament to which it sent NBA players. \u201cLike we should be ashamed because we didn\u2019t win the gold medal?,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cThat\u2019s a ridiculous attitude. It\u2019s immature. It\u2019s arrogant, and it shows that whoever thinks that doesn\u2019t respect all the other teams in the world and doesn\u2019t respect that these guys did the best they could.\u201d Falling short of their gold-medal goal still comes with pain, something the Americans have had to deal with since losing to France in the quarterfinals on Wednesday, and something that won\u2019t go away when they arrive back in the States on Sunday. \u201cThat\u2019s something,\u201d Myles Turner admitted, \u201cthat\u2019s going to stick with us for the rest of our lives.\u201d The sting could ultimately be worse for the players who will never again have the chance to play for the national team. That could be a significant portion of this roster, with higher profile Americans expected to play at next year\u2019s Olympics in Tokyo, and with the next World Cup four years away. A lack of top-flight talent is the easy answer for why this was the first American team of NBA players to lose since the 2006 World Championship. And it\u2019s not a wrong answer. Stephen Curry, Anthony Davis and James Harden would obviously have made a difference. But when asked about his country\u2019s failure to win gold this year, Kobe Bryant insisted that, no matter who is wearing the red, white and blue, losses will happen. \u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of the rest of the world catching up to the U.S.,\u201d Bryant said at a FIBA press conference on Friday. \u201cThe rest of the world has been caught up for quite some time. It\u2019s to the point now where us in the U.S., we\u2019re going to win some and we\u2019re going to lose some. That\u2019s just how it goes.\u201d Bryant brought up the 2008 Olympics, when one of the most talented teams ever assembled led Spain by just two points early in the fourth quarter of the gold medal game. At the World Championship two years later, a U.S. Team with four future NBA MVPs escaped with a two-point win over Brazil in pool play. \u201cPut the best players that you think are going to make the best team out there on the floor,\u201d Bryant said, \u201cwe are still going to have challenges. It\u2019s not going to be a cakewalk. The days of the \u201992 Barcelona Dream Team are gone. They\u2019re over.\u201d That doesn\u2019t mean that the United States couldn\u2019t have won this tournament with the players that it had, some of which had disappointing performances on the world stage. In each of the last five major international tournaments, the U.S. ranked No. 1 in offensive efficiency. Through its first six games in this tournament, it ranked ninth offensively. Before breaking with a 12-for-25 performance against Poland on Saturday, the Americans had shot just 33.3 percent from 3-point range, well below the NBA league average (35.5 percent), even though the 3-point distance is shorter on the FIBA floor. The general sentiment among the players was that the loss to France was an \u201canything can happen on any given night\u201d situation, but Harrison Barnes said that it was \u201cexecuting on the offensive end\u201d where the team fell short in a general sense. \u201cIf you look at a lot of these teams and how they played,\u201d Barnes continued, \u201cthey\u2019re able to fall back on their system. They\u2019re able to fall back on things that they know, things that they\u2019ve run, guys that have been playing together for five, six, seven years. For us, we had to put our hat on defense. That was what we kind of made our calling card. Offensively, we knew we weren\u2019t going to ever get to that place where, \u2018OK, here are two or three quick-hitters.\u2019 But we did the best that we could.\u201d Though the U.S. was one of the best defensive teams in the tournament, it couldn\u2019t turn enough stops into transition opportunities. In each of the five major tournaments that the U.S. won from 2008 to 2016, it ranked first or second in pace. Through its first six games, this U.S. team ranked 13th of 32 World Cup teams in pace (an estimated 75 possessions per 40 minutes). Fewer fast breaks led to more half-court offense, where the execution just wasn\u2019t there consistently enough. There\u2019s something to be said about ingrained teamwork and the difference between how American and international players are developed. But four weeks of preparation and five pool-play games isn\u2019t enough time to build the requisite chemistry when the Americans bring back an almost entirely new roster every time they compete in a major tournament. This team also had less practice time than previous editions of Team USA. From the day before its first game in China to the end of the tournament, the U.S. never practiced on days between games, choosing only to get in the gym for one-hour shootarounds in the morning on game days. Next year\u2019s Olympics are earlier in the summer, so that preparation time will likely be shorter than the four weeks that this team was together before the start of the World Cup. And without the same chemistry that their opponents have, more talent \u2014 guys that can get buckets on cue \u2014 is needed. That means more roster turnover. And if some of these players never put on the USA uniform again, they can at least hope that the work that they\u2019ve put in over the last six weeks will propel them to strong NBA seasons as a silver lining. \u201cIndividually, across the board, everybody gets a lot better by playing and going through this entire process,\u201d Joe Harris said this week. \u201cYou spent 39-plus days with one of the best coaches in the world, one of the best coaches in the game in Pop. \u201cJust being around them, learning their approach to the game, being around all these great players, competing with them night in and night out, whether it\u2019s practices or games, and competing at a high level every night against some of the best players in the world, this is the best offseason preparation you can have going into the season.\u201d There don\u2019t seem to be any misgivings among the players about spending the last four weeks on the other side of the world. There are no regrets from our group in terms of what we\u2019ve given, what we sacrificed, the commitment that everyone has made away from their families, teams, organizations, all of that.\u201d \u2014 Harrison Barnes \u201cWe made that pact that we were going to do whatever we could to win basketball games,\u201d Barnes said. \u201cTo go out there and try to win gold medals. On the flip side of that is that there\u2019s a chance that we may not win. And, I think there are no regrets from our group in terms of what we\u2019ve given, what we sacrificed, the commitment that everyone has made away from their families, teams, organizations, all of that.\u201d They all have an NBA season to prepare for now, and at least some of them would love a shot at redemption next summer. \u201cThere\u2019s no telling,\u201d Walker said about possibly playing next year. \u201cIt\u2019s not up to me. I would love to. It was really fun to be a part of. I would love to do it again.\u201d Hopefully with better results. * * * John Schuhmann is a staff writer for NBA.com.

It will face Argentina , which is making its first World Cup final appearance in 17 years, on Sunday. Toronto Raptors center Marc Gasol was the star in Spain\u2019s victory, scoring 33 points on 11-for-19 shooting while also posting six rebounds, four assists and two blocks. He sent the game into double-overtime by drawing a foul with four seconds left in the first OT and sinking a pair of free throws. Overall, Gasol carried Spain in the extra frames, scoring seven in the first OT and four more in double-OT. Spain trailed for much of the game but surged in the fourth quarter and took the lead 71-70 when Gasol hit two free throws with 8.7 seconds to play in regulation. The game was nearly decided when Australia\u2019s Patty Mills stepped to the line with 4 seconds left and his team trailing, 71-70. Mills, a standout for the San Antonio Spurs, made the first free throw before missing the second. His miss was rebounded by Spanish guard Ricky Rubio, who tossed up a desperation shot from halfcourt that rimmed out. Sergio Llull stepped up in double-OT as well, nailing a pair of critical 3-pointers (and scored 17 points overall) to help Spain prevail. He also played stellar defense on Mills when coach Sergio Scariolo went with box-and-one late in the game. Patty Mills scored 32 to lead Australia. Gasol won the NBA title a few months ago with the Raptors. And now he can do the double by winning with Spain, which won this title 13 years ago when it was called the world championship. What would gold mean? \u201cLet\u2019s talk about it Sunday,\u201d replied Gasol, who played on the 2006 team with his brother Pau and current team member Rudy Fernandez. \u201cLet\u2019s see how it goes. I don\u2019t want to lose a second thinking of what would be, what it would mean for us.\u201d He said his attention is on detail and preparing. Not celebrating. Not yet. \u201cWhenever the game is over, life will go on either way,\u201d he said. Australia will try again for a bronze medal in a major men\u2019s basketball championship. The Boomers are 0-4 in third-place games in the Olympics \u2014 including three years ago in Rio de Janeiro \u2014 and had never reached the semifinals of the World Cup. \u201cThe experience that we had in Rio \u2014 what it felt like to finish fourth. I have the confidence that this group will be able to be well and truly refocus,\u201d Australia coach Andrej Lemanis said. Rubio had a 19-point, 12-assist double-double, with seven rebounds and four steals to his name, also. According to FIBA, this was the seventh game that went into double overtime in World Cup (and its predecessor, the world championship) history. And it was the first to occur in a medal round. Germany, behind 47 points from Dallas Mavericks legend Dirk Nowitzki, beat Angola 108-103 in triple overtime in the 2006 world championship. Another five games before Friday went double overtime, most recently Germany\u2019s 82-81 win over Serbia in 2010. It was the first double OT game for either Spain or Australia in any World Cup. Australia will now face France in third-place game on Sunday.

The victory means Argentina is headed to the championship round \u2014 a place it has not been since 2002 \u2014 to face Spain ( which defeated Australia earlier on Friday). Former NBA player Luis Scola delivered once again for Argentina, notching 28 points and 13 rebounds, sealing the deal with 3-pointers on consecutive possessions down the stretch. Gabriel Deck scored 13 points and Facundo Campazzo added 12 for Argentina, a team with no active NBA players on its roster and still made its first gold-medal game in Olympic or World Cup play since the 2004 Athens Games. And when he made his way to the locker room, Scola was greeted by chants of \u201cM-V-P\u201d from teammates. He corrected them with a smile: \u201cMBP,\u201d he said. \u201cMost Beautiful Player.\u201d Indeed, on the court the 39-year-old\u2019s game is still very much a thing of beauty. Showing no signs of fatigue, he played 34 of the 40 minutes and saved his best for the very end. \u201cLuis told us before every game, including today, that we can win \u2014 that we are a tough, tough team to beat,\u201d Argentina center Tayavek Gallizzi said. \u201cJust focus on our game. It\u2019s incredible. At his age he is playing better than all the younger guys.\u201d France, which ousted the United States Men\u2019s National Team from medal-round play in the quarterfinals, struggled on offense all game. It shot just 39% overall and was particularly bad from 3-point range (7 for 31, 23%). Evan Fournier and Rudy Gobert, the two stars who powered France past Team USA two days earlier, struggled against Argentina as Fournier had 16 points (on 6 for 17 shooting) and Gobert was held to three points (although he added 11 rebounds). \u201cFrom the first to the last minute, it was complete domination,\u201d Gobert said, tipping his cap to Argentina. Both semifinal winners got two days off after their quarterfinal victories. Australia and France both played their quarterfinals on Wednesday, and France coach Vincent Collet said he thought that was a factor. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to find any excuse, but I think so,\u201d said Collet, who cancelled practice Thursday because of his team\u2019s travel demands. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s not fair that one team has two days to recover and prepare even if they don\u2019t know the first day who will be the opponent. They know it\u2019ll be one or the other, so they can prepare for both.\u201d  Argentina put together an early 10-0 run to take the lead, and kept it the rest of the way. A 15-point lead got cut to single digits for much of the fourth, when Scola\u2019s back-to-back 3s clinched the outcome. \u201cIt was a great game for us,\u201d Campazzo said. France and Argentina last met in the 2006 FIBA World Cup, which Argentina won 80-70. The loss gives France an 0-4 record against Argentina in World Cup play and keeps it from reaching its first-ever World Cup final. Argentina is looking to win the FIBA World Cup for the first time since 1950.

Hard to put into a caption all of the emotions it takes to try and accomplish your dreams. I wasn\u2019t supposed to be here. Anybody that has beat the odds understands the mental and emotional strain it takes to inspire yourself on an uphill war, let alone inspire others. \u201d \u2018The injury\u2019 gave me a chance to find and prove to myself (and the world) that I wouldn\u2019t be defined by my circumstances. With my time in the League what I will be most proud of is the fact that my character, values and faith were tested, and I persevered.\u201d In a statement, Warriors GM Bob Myers said the following : \u201cShaun Livingston\u2019s story is one of the most inspirational in the history of professional sports. What he accomplished after suffering so many trials and tribulations early in his career is a true testament to who he is as a person, which has always been characterized by tremendous class, grace and professionalism. He represents everything that you\u2019d want in a professional athlete and, most importantly, in a human being. We appreciate what he did for our team and organization over the last five years, becoming a three-time NBA champion and a key figure on one of the best teams in NBA history. We wish him well as he begins the next phase in his life.\u201d Livingston won three championships with the Warriors and played 15 seasons in the NBA after being the No. 4 overall pick of the 2004 draft by the LA Clippers. His career was marked by his valuable backup role with the Warriors as well as a gruesome knee injury he suffered in the 2006-07 season against the Charlotte Hornets. It took Livingston nearly two years to return to an NBA court, but he did, playing four games for the Miami Heat in the 2008-09 season. From there, he became a valuable backup guard, spending time with the Oklahoma City Thunder (2008-09), Washington Wizards (2009-10), Charlotte Bobcats (2010-11), Milwaukee Bucks (2011-12), Washington Wizards and Cleveland Cavaliers (2012-13) before signing with Golden State in the summer of 2014. He is just the second player in NBA history to complete a tenure of at least five seasons with a team having made an NBA Finals appearance in each season, joining Tom Heinsohn, who did so in all nine of his seasons with the Boston Celtics from 1956-65. In his career, Livingston averaged 6.3 points, 3 assists and 2.4 rebounds per game over 833 career games. He was waived by the Warriors in early July."},{"id":31819,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/kobe-bryant-chimes-state-team-usa","date":"2019-09-13","title":"Kobe Bryant: Easy days for USA Basketball are likely 'over'","content":"BEIJING (AP) \u2014 Kobe Bryant played on the Redeem Team in 2008 , the one that delivered a gold medal in Beijing after a series of USA Basketball disappointments in big tournaments. Back in Beijing this weekend, Bryant isn\u2019t sure another Redeem Team will be so easy to find for the U.S. The five-time NBA champion and two-time Olympic gold medalist is at the final weekend of the World Cup as an ambassador for FIBA. However, he won\u2019t be watching the U.S. in the medal round. The best the Americans can do at this tournament is seventh place, and Bryant says the days of automatic gold medals for the U.S. \u2014 regardless of who is on the roster \u2014 may be over. \u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of the rest of the world catching up to the U.S. It\u2019s that the rest of the world has been caught up for quite some time,\u201d Bryant said. \u201cIt\u2019s to the point now where the U.S., we\u2019re going to win some and we\u2019re going to lose some. That\u2019s just how it goes. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have our challenges for the next team, whether it\u2019s Redeem 2 or whatever you want to call it,\u201d Bryant continued. \u201cNo matter what team it is, it\u2019s not going to be easy.\u201d This U.S. World Cup team was not overly star-powered, after plenty of people who were under consideration for roster spots dropped out before the on-court selection process. The Americans won their first five games, but lost to France in the quarterfinals and then to Serbia in the consolation round \u2014 meaning their seventh- or eighth-place showing in China will be the program\u2019s worst ever in a major tournament.  The U.S. finishes its World Cup stay on Saturday against Poland. The next big tournament for the U.S. will be the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, where the Americans will seek a fourth consecutive gold medal. And some top NBA players, like Draymond Green, have already publicly said they would like to play next summer. \u201cI do hope to play,\u201d Green said Thursday during an appearance on CNBC. \u201cAnd I think a lot of guys will want to play.\u201d But winning gold wasn\u2019t even that easy for the Redeem Team, Bryant pointed out. That team with Bryant, LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, Carmelo Anthony, Chris Bosh, Chris Paul, Jason Kidd and more beat Spain 118-107 for the gold medal, but it took some heroics \u2014 a four-point play by Bryant with about 3 minutes left among them \u2014 to pull away in the final moments. \u201cWe needed a hell of a fourth quarter to beat Spain,\u201d Bryant said. \u201cAnd that was a hell of a team we had. We still needed a really late push to beat Spain. So I say that to say, put the best players that you think makes the best U.S. team out there on the floor and we are still going to have challenges.

The previous worst finish for a U.S. men\u2019s team in 45 tournament appearances was sixth at the 2002 world championships. \u201cWe\u2019ve committed to this from Day One,\u201d U.S. guard Joe Harris said. \u201cTo get all the way to this point and just kind of have it abruptly come up short, it really stings.\u201d Serbia advances to the fifth-place game on Saturday (8 a.m. ET), to face the Czech Republic, while the United States will play Poland in the seventh-place game that day, too (4 a.m. ET). The Czech Republic beat Poland 94-84 in Thursday\u2019s other consolation bracket game. The Americans \u2014 the top-ranked team in the world \u2014 will be seventh or eighth in China, depending on the outcome of their consolation finale Saturday. Sacramento Kings forward Harrison Barnes scored 22 for the U.S., which got 18 from Boston Celtics guard Kemba Walker and 16 off the bench from Milwaukee Bucks guard Khris Middleton. Bogdan Bogdanovic of the Kings scored 28 for Serbia, which bolted to a 25-point lead and handed the U.S. its second loss in two days. Vladimir Lucic scored 15 for Serbia, which will play for fifth place Saturday. Denver Nuggets big man Nikola Jokic showed off his usual all-around skills, finishing with nine points, three rebounds rebounds, seven assists and a pair of critical free throws with 20 seconds left to seal the win. \u201cIt\u2019s a really tough game to play against those guys,\u201d Bogdanovic said. \u201cI\u2019m sure both teams were really upset after losing in the quarterfinals and we were just trying to make people happy.\u201d After the loss, center Myles Turner took to Twitter and shared his thoughts on those questioning Team USA\u2019s talent during this FIBA World Cup run. \u201cFrom 1-12 top to bottom this team this roster has sacrificed so much for our nation,\u201d Turner wrote. \u201cOur summers, our bodies, our mental. We came up short can\u2019t nobodies more upset than us but I refuse to tolerate any slander for our play. You cannot question our heart, our character or our spirit. We layed it all out on the line each and every game. Don\u2019t disrespect us, this coaching staff or USA Basketball as a whole but respect the world basketball is an international game these countries are talented. \u201c\u2026 We\u2019re also the ones who stepped up to the plate when others stepped down. We qualified our nation for the Olympics we got some work to do to rebuild a legacy that was left before us were on the wrong side of history indeed. But that\u2019s gunna make the next medal that much sweeter!\u201d Serbia-U.S. game was widely expected to be one for gold this weekend. The prospects of that were hyped plenty going into the tournament \u2014 especially after Serbia coach Sasha Djordjevic called out the Americans in a television interview by saying \u201cif we meet, may God help them.\u201d But all that was on the line Thursday night were bragging rights and a few world ranking points. \u201cThere\u2019s no regrets from our group in terms of what we\u2019ve given, what we\u2019ve sacrificed, the commitment everyone\u2019s made to be away from their families, away from their teams, away from their organizations,\u201d Barnes said. \u201cThere\u2019s no regrets.\u201d Seemingly still smarting from a loss to France in the FIBA World Cup quarterfinals on Wednesday, Team USA was playing roughly 24 hours after that defeat. It showed early on as the Americans trailed 32-7 after the first quarter and shot 3 for 16 from the field (19%). Serbia, on the other hand, was simply sizzling, hitting 64% of its shots overall and went 8 for 9 on 3-pointers as well. Team USA warmed up considerably in the second quarter, cutting the lead to 36-26 off a dunk by Turner with 3:39 left and had it down to 44-40 by halftime. By the end of the third quarter, they had further trimmed the lead to 71-68 thanks to solid play from Middleton, Barnes, Walker and Utah Jazz guard Donovan Mitchell. U.S. coach Gregg Popovich lauded his team for making the comeback, basically 24 hours after seeing its medal hopes dashed by the quarterfinal loss to France. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how much I\u2019ve been impressed the whole time with their character, their stick-to-itiveness and their persistence as they\u2019re learning how to play together,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cTonight was a great example of that.\u201d The last time the U.S. dropped consecutive games at the World Cup level was \u201902 at the world championships in Indianapolis, losing to Argentina by seven and Yugoslavia by three. The only times the Americans lost three straight was at the 1970 world championships and at the 2005 FIBA Americas tournament. Vojtech Hruban scored 24 points, Tomas Satoransky added 22 and the Czech Republic rallied late to beat Poland 94-84 in a consolation game Thursday in Shanghai.

When Gobert got the ball, he took advantage of smaller defenders, scoring inside and getting to the line, where he shot 9-for-10 (he\u2019s just a 63% career foul shooter in the NBA). With Gobert on the floor, France scored 84 points on 64 possessions (1.31 per). With him off the floor, France scored just five points on 10 possessions. Defensively, he was the anchor that kept the Americans from getting to the basket and allowed his teammates to pressure the ball. \u201cIf he plays good defense,\u201d France\u2019s Nicolas Batum said afterward, \u201cwe know it\u2019s going to be easy for us, because we knew we have the big tower behind us. So we were trying to be aggressive.\u201d In the 28 years the United States has been bringing NBA players to international tournaments , they\u2019ve never faced an opponent that made such an impact on both ends of the floor. The U.S. outscored France, 18-5, in less than six minutes with Gobert on the bench. But they couldn\u2019t get him into foul trouble and he appropriately played a game-high 34:09, registering a plus-23. One shouldn\u2019t need extra motivation in a World Cup elimination game and Gobert said that he\u2019s been dreaming of a win over the United States for a long time. But Batum said that his teammate was motivated by some words from U.S. starting center Myles Turner. After the U.S. beat Brazil on Monday , Turner was asked about the matchup with Gobert. \u201cI look forward to it,\u201d Turner said then. \u201cHe\u2019s a good defensive player. I\u2019m a good defensive player. It\u2019s going to be a good game. He\u2019s the Defensive Player of the Year.\u201d \u201cHe saw the comments they made about him yesterday,\u201d Batum revealed. \u201cAgainst Australia [on Monday], we had the worst defensive game we could have this year. So we wanted to make a statement on defense. And when we saw that yesterday morning, we knew Rudy was going to be ready.\u201d Turner scored just two points in just 10 minutes of playing time. For most of the second half, the U.S. went to a small-ball look that had been working for them earlier in the tournament. That helped them seemingly take control of the game (with a seven-point lead) early in the fourth quarter. But after Gobert returned from a brief rest, the U.S. scored on just four of its final 16 possessions, as he blocked both Kemba Walker and Donovan Mitchell on drives while contesting a few other shots at the rim. \u201cI knew they were going to try to do that,\u201d Gobert said of the small-ball lineups, \u201ctry to take me out of the game, try to take me out of what I do.\u201d \u201cWhen they played small ball, we didn\u2019t adjust,\u201d Batum added. \u201cWe kept him on the court. We knew he was going to make a difference anyway. That\u2019s why he\u2019s our best player.\u201d While Antetokounmpo didn\u2019t get the help he needed against the U.S., Gobert certainly did. With their big man setting screens, Fournier and Nando De Colo were terrific in pick-and-rolls. And Frank Ntilikina hit two huge jumpers in the fourth quarter. \u201cThis is the best French team I\u2019ve seen,\u201d USA coach Gregg Popovich said, \u201cbecause they play at both ends of the court. It\u2019s not just an offensive team that executes well. It\u2019s not just a couple of guys on their own. \u201cAll the parts fit. They\u2019re deep. And I think they\u2019ve done an outstanding job. They were wonderful tonight.\u201d Although the United States didn\u2019t have a player that could impact the game like Gobert did (but Mitchell certainly tried to), there was much regret about the first American loss at a major tournament since the semifinals of the 2006 World Championship. \u201cEveryone knows what we wanted to do and we didn\u2019t do it,\u201d Jaylen Brown said. \u201cSo I guess you can imagine how we feel.\u201d The defense that ranked No. 1 at the World Cup entering the knockout rounds just wasn\u2019t good enough. \u201cWe just couldn\u2019t really get up in them the way we had [against] other teams with our pressure,\u201d Joe Harris said. \u201cI think that started from get-go. We didn\u2019t do a good enough job of applying pressure early on, and then it bit us in the ass at the end of the game.\u201d There were some costly turnovers and some painful missed free throws down the stretch. \u201cIt hurt bad,\u201d Walker said of missing two freebies with a chance to make it a one-possession game with 43 seconds to go. \u201cI really wanted to make those for my teammates, but sometimes, that\u2019s just the way the ball goes. Very, very unfortunate and it\u2019s nothing I can control.\u201d The Americans still have two more games to play. They will face Serbia in Dongguan on Thursday and then (depending on Thursday\u2019s result) play in a fifth or seventh-place game in Beijing on Saturday. While this was a unique situation with the three best players at an international tournament playing for non-U.S. teams, the Americans didn\u2019t want to hear about the players who chose not to participate . \u201cIf they didn\u2019t want to come here, that\u2019s on them,\u201d Mitchell said when asked a question he\u2019s been asked quite a bit over the last six weeks. \u201cWe have 11 other guys in this room that want to compete. On top of that, guys who didn\u2019t make it wanted to compete too. So I\u2019m going to ride for these guys. \u201cYou [media] guys are going to do your thing, but we have 12 guys who want to compete for America, just like every other country. It sucks that some of our country people don\u2019t feel that way about us, but we don\u2019t care. We wanted to compete and we did.\u201d Ultimately, they fell short in a game that will probably be remembered a lot longer in France than it will be in the United States. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean much if you don\u2019t win the gold,\u201d Gobert said, \u201cbut it\u2019s still something that will go down as one of the biggest wins of my career and the biggest win of French basketball, for sure.\u201d The U.S. now moves on to two games that don\u2019t mean much and France moves on to the semifinals \u2014 with the best player left in the tournament and maybe the best chance to win it. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

The defeat also brought an end to the Americans\u2019 streak of five straight major tournament titles. For the first time since 2006, the U.S. sent NBA players to a major international tournament and won\u2019t win gold. \u201cAny loss hurts,\u201d U.S. coach Gregg Popovich said. \u201cAnd in this situation, it hurts more. But life goes on. This is very important and we would have loved to have won \u2026 but we\u2019re all grown, we all have families and lives and life goes on.\u201d Rudy Gobert was a dominant force for France on both ends of the floor, scoring 21 points, grabbing 16 rebounds and blocking three shots, including two big rejections of Donovan Mitchell and Kemba Walker in the closing minutes.  \u201cWe came here to win gold,\u201d Gobert said. \u201cWe knew it wasn\u2019t going to be easy. A lot of people counted us out, but we got the win.\u201d Gobert said beating the Americans wasn\u2019t the goal \u2014 winning gold is. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean anything if you don\u2019t win in the end,\u201d Gobert said. After a first quarter in which both teams scored just 18 points on 19 possessions, France\u2019s offense came alive. Trailing 29-27, the French went on an 18-8 run to build an eight-point lead before Mitchell ended the half with a left-handed running hook. A four-point play from Nicolas Batum put France up 10 early in the third quarter, but a 23-10 USA run (with Mitchell scoring 12 of the 23 points) to end the third quarter put the Americans up 66-63. They led by as much as seven early in the fourth, but France came back with a 13-2 run to take a six-point lead with less than three minutes to go. The U.S. shot 4-for-11 from the free throw line in the fourth quarter, with Marcus Smart and Kemba Walker each missing two in the final three minutes. France converted on enough of their chances at the line, and the U.S. never had a chance to tie. Mitchell led the United States in scoring, finishing with 29 points on 12-for-23 from the field, but he didn\u2019t get enough help. Walker shot 2-for-9, committed four turnovers and didn\u2019t have a single assist. Evan Fournier led France with 22 points and was 4 for 8 on 3-pointers. \u201cJust got to take it like a man at this point,\u201d Walker said. \u201cWe lost. There\u2019s nothing we can do. We competed. We\u2019ve been competing since day one that we got to training camp. But we gave it everything we\u2019ve got. I know we\u2019re Team USA and things of that nature and they\u2019ve been winning for a lot of years, but you know, we didn\u2019t get a chance to pull it off.\u201d France had been 0-9 against the U.S. in major international play, most of those outcomes one-sided affairs. But the last meeting between the nations was only a 100-97 U.S. win at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics three years ago, and France returned three players \u2014 Nando De Colo, Gobert and Batum \u2014 who got minutes in that game. None of the U.S. players who played that afternoon in Rio are on this year\u2019s World Cup team. Jayson Tatum missed his fourth straight game for Team USA with a left ankle sprain. France advances to play Argentina in the semifinals on Friday in Beijing, while the U.S. will play Serbia on Thursday in Dongguan in the classification rounds. It can finish as high as fifth. \u201cAt the end of the day, you\u2019ve got to tip your cap to them,\u201d Team USA guard Joe Harris said. \u201cThey outplayed us. They deserved to win. We certainly didn\u2019t deserve to win that game.\u201d Information from The Associated Press was used in this report. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

For a lot of the men who\u2019ve been here, done that, the late-summer stop in Chicago is an obligation, even a nuisance, with training camps soon to open and a world of urgency bearing down on them. But Vogel missed out on the frivolity last season \u2013 in fact, he\u2019d been out of the club since April 2018, when the Orlando Magic fired him after two seasons in which the team won just 29 and 25 games, missing the playoffs for the fifth and sixth consecutive years. Vogel\u2019s time in Indiana \u2013 five playoff trips from 2011 to 2016, including two losses to Miami in the East finals, and a 250-181 record \u2013 was more successful, however. That\u2019s the experience he\u2019ll draw from most as he steps into his biggest spotlight so far: taking over as the Los Angeles Lakers\u2019 new coach. Vogel, 46, has been charged with blending the talents of LeBron James, Anthony Davis and the rest, while navigating their personalities and clout under one of the NBA\u2019s biggest microscopes. Tall task? Sure. Then again, this is a guy who was happy playing Division III hoops at Juniata College in Huntington, Pa., when he rolled the dice on a future in coaching, convincing Kentucky\u2019s Rick Pitino to let him be Wildcats student manager (and sponge as a fly on the wall) in 1996. From there, Vogel served as UK\u2019s video coordinator, then moved to the same role when Pitino was hired by the Boston Celtics. Then Vogel kept climbing. With the 2019-20 season on the horizon, Vogel also joked that a personal goal this year is to \u201cwin the Rudy Tomjanovich Award,\u201d mentioning the trophy for media affability presented each year by the Professional Basketball Writers Association. He got off to a fine start Monday when he sat down with NBA.com\u2019s Steve Aschburner for a conversation. * * * Steve Aschburner : Do you feel as refreshed as you look? Frank Vogel : I\u2019m pretty good. I haven\u2019t lost a game in more than a year. A year and a half, almost. SA : You\u2019ve probably never been able to say that since you became a coach. I know you didn\u2019t have much of a gap between Indiana and Orlando. FV : I had nine days between getting fired in Indy and hired in Orlando. SA : What did you do with your gap year? FV : It was necessary. It was a great year. I treated it like a sabbatical year, where you take a minute to exhale. And be with your family. That\u2019s hard for coaches to do, and I really enjoyed and embraced that opportunity. My family is getting older \u2013 [daughters Alexa and Arianna are] 15 and 13 now \u2013 so it was great to have that year to be around them. Full time, 24\/7. A sophomore and eighth grader now \u2013 [wife Jenifer and I] only have a few years left with them [at home]. So it was great to be a full-time dad. But it was also great from a professional standpoint and a standpoint of learning. I studied the game from a different lens, a different perspective. I watched games all season from home, without a horse in the race. And I visited with a lot of teams. A lot of practices. A lot of coaches meetings, both at the collegiate and the pro levels. You pick up a lot of things. You coach your own system for so many years, that\u2019s all you ever know. To be able to step inside and see how others do it was very beneficial. SA : Anything in particular stand out? FV : Everybody\u2019s kind of doing the same thing [3-point focus], but in many different ways. You know what I mean? A lot of it was surprising. Some of it I wouldn\u2019t do, but some of it, I\u2019d shift my approach. You pick up little nuggets here and there, a little terminology that can maybe strengthen your schemes or your offensive system. I think it will help me with this next step. SA : I would think the challenge is trusting the new stuff vs. leaning on the old stuff that has worked (or not). FV : It\u2019s more uncomfortable to do things differently than the way you\u2019ve always done \u2018em. But you have to be willing to do that, if you\u2019re going to improve who you are as a coach. There\u2019s also the fact that the game has changed so much in the last five years, too. There\u2019s an element of having to re-learn the style of play, from the way things were five, seven, eight years ago. SA : I feel bad for the guys like former Pacers center Roy Hibbert and Greg Monroe (NBA big man who\u2019ll be playing in China), the low-block bangers who\u2019ve been rendered all but obsolete in today\u2019s game. It\u2019s really become a dinosaur thing of adapt-or-die, hasn\u2019t it? FV : I still think there\u2019s a place for centers and big men in this league. The thing that\u2019s gone away more than anything are lineups with two bigs. The non-shooting power forwards. Those are the guys I feel have suffered even more than the centers. They have become \u201cfives\u201d \u2013 but in turn, sometimes they\u2019re just better basketball players than the [pure] fives. So that\u2019s kind of pushing things too. SA : So no more Kurt Rambis types? Tom Tolbert, Mark Landsberger? It\u2019s all stretch fours and 3-and-D players now. FV : The other guys can\u2019t keep up offensively. SA : We all know now that long 2-point shots are \u201cbad.\u201d Where you do you stand on long 3-pointers? Do the analytics support taking those shots? FV : I call them \u201c4-pointers.\u201d You have guys with 3-point range and guys with 4-point range. You used to have to chart when you were preparing for a team how a guy shoots at the arc and how a guy shoots from the corner. Now you have to chart corner, arc and how they shoot from 4-point range. Maybe you want to give some guys those shots. But some guys \u2013 Steph [Curry], Dame [Lillard] \u2013 shoot a very high percentage from that range, so you have to treat them like it\u2019s a corner three. SA : So you\u2019d rather have some opponents shooting from 16 feet than other guys launching from 32. You don\u2019t think the league will add literally a 4-point line, do you? FV : I hope not. I just found out they have the 4-point shot in the Big 3. I didn\u2019t realize that [laughs] SA : You faced big expectations before, especially in Indiana. But what you\u2019re looking at now in L.A. are enormous expectations, coming from tradition, from passion and maybe from an impatience that\u2019s unrealistic. Are you prepared for that? FV : We have the pieces to compete for a championship. To have expectations that it\u2019s all going to come together immediately might be reaching a little bit. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll have some bumps in the road. But hopefully as these guys jell \u2026 we have a number of guys with terrific resumes, but they have to learn each other. And they\u2019ll have to learn each other quickly. Then we\u2019ll be in the mix for the regular season and positioning ourselves for a playoff run. You just never know how quickly that process is going to play out. So hopefully, whatever the regular season looks like, by the time you get into the playoffs you\u2019re jelling at the right time and playing your best basketball. SA : Everyone is talking about more competitive balance in 2019-20. FV : I agree that it\u2019s more open. But I think people are sleeping on Golden State if they think they\u2019re still not going to be a great team. I definitely think that they are. But it does seem more balanced. There\u2019s a lot being written about Big Twos instead of the Big Three era. To me, there are more teams that seem to have a reasonable chance to win it all. SA : Is that a good thing? People used to talk about the value to a sport when, say, the Yankees are dominant or the Steelers are dominant, and your league has had the Warriors in that role. Even though fans of other franchises might not have appreciated it. FV : It\u2019s cyclical. I think those type of dynasties are good for the big picture. They\u2019re fascinating when they\u2019re taking place, and they\u2019re fascinating when they fall and it becomes open again. It breathes life into many markets that maybe didn\u2019t feel like they had a chance when the dynasty was in place. You can have the dynasty and then the No. 1 contender \u2013 that\u2019s always interesting too. SA : Well, you and Doc Rivers are the only two coaches who have to sort out who the No. 1 contender is in your own building. What do you expect out of Lakers-Clippers this season, two really good teams that want the same thing? FV : No doubt. They have a terrific team and a terrific coach, and their front office is doing really well. But we can\u2019t focus on their location. We still have to focus on ourselves and the task at hand. Not just worry about what\u2019s happening crosstown. There are a lot of teams capable of winning the West, so we\u2019ll be focused on our process. SA : How different are LeBron and AD from players you\u2019ve coached in the past? FV : Talent-wise, they\u2019re the two best players I\u2019ll ever have had the opportunity to coach. That brings a lot of fun, a lot of excitement to what we\u2019re able to do on the court. It brings a lot of challenges too. You have to make sure you\u2019re managing them the right way and putting them in the right positions to feel good about their roles and what\u2019s happening around them. There are challenges involved with that. So I\u2019m looking forward to how that all is going to play out. SA : LeBron and his coaches have been a storyline at each of his stops, and not always in a pleasant way. What do you anticipate? FV : I only know how he\u2019s been with me. That\u2019s the only measuring stick I\u2019m going to use. I\u2019m not going to look at how it\u2019s been with his past coaches. That really doesn\u2019t concern me. I want to shape my own opinion of him as a person and one of the greatest ever. I\u2019m going to take my approach and work together with him to hopefully do something special. SA : Denver\u2019s Mike Malone was an assistant in Cleveland when LeBron was there. He told me \u201cLeBron makes anybody a better coach. Trust me \u2013 LeBron is coming off the first year in a long time where he didn\u2019t make the playoffs. For Frank to be coaching a pissed-off LeBron James, that\u2019s pretty good timing.\u201d Do you expect LeBron to do the same sort of damage for you now that he did to your teams before? FV : For sure. That\u2019s going to be part of the excitement of this process. SA : This might be more of a training camp question, but is it important to determine whether Davis plays power forward or center? FV : It is, in this regard: To me, he\u2019s effective in both positions. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wise when your mindset is to be at your best going into the playoffs, to have him banging with centers for 82 games full-time. Does that mean he\u2019s never going to do it in the regular season? No, of course he\u2019s going to play some center in the regular season. But we want to make sure we keep the end goal in sight and getting him to April, for that playoff run, the right way. SA : So have you embedded the term \u201cload management\u201d in your vocabulary? FV : I know. Everybody\u2019s using it now. We\u2019re not sure what level we\u2019re going to use it with our guys. But it\u2019s part of today\u2019s culture, for sure. SA : Where is Dwight Howard at physically and mentally? Do you have a sense for what he wants to accomplish now and for his legacy with however much longer he hopes to play? FV : I think he\u2019s excited about this opportunity with the Lakers. It\u2019s very different from the first time he came through. Then, he was a mega-star coming in with two other mega-stars [Kobe Bryant, Steve Nash]. This time around, he\u2019s had a few teams where they haven\u2019t had great success. And he\u2019s at a different point, age-wise, in his career. So he\u2019s excited just to be part of something, in any way he can help. He knows it\u2019s going to be more of a role player type of role. SA : And that\u2019s acceptable to him? FV : It\u2019s definitely acceptable. He\u2019s excited about it. And he has the ability to be one of the best at it in the league. He\u2019s going to be concentrating on that. I\u2019ll be defining what we\u2019ll be expecting of him, in terms of defending and rebounding and screen-setting and lob-catching and all those things. He\u2019s willing to accept any role that I lay out in front of him. We\u2019ve had a great start to our relationship. He\u2019s in a great place mentally. SA : What do you like about your coaching staff? FV : Everything. We really have it all. We\u2019ve got great experience in Jason [Kidd] and Lionel [Hollins]. They had terrific head coaching stints. Both played at a high level and won championships. Jason obviously was a Hall of Fame player and his pass-first mindset carried over to his coaching. That will be a big part of what we do with our group. First we\u2019ve got to be a team, despite the great talent that we have. And then we\u2019ve got other guys with a wealth of credentials behind that. Phil Handy being in five straight Finals and having an established relationship with LeBron, to help me put him in the right positions to succeed. Mike Penberthy comes in as one of the best skills or shooting coaches, respected league-wide, and has a relationship with AD from the Pelicans the last couple years. He can help me put Anthony in great positions as well. Miles Simon has been great in terms of bridging the gap with this transition, and is a great young coach. And then we\u2019ve got my guy Quinton Crawford from Orlando who was my head video guy. He has an immense coaching talent \u2013 he cut his teeth the same way I did. SA : I was going to say, video guys grabbing that first rung on the coaching ladders must be a key position on your staff. FV : It really is. Not all of them are made for taking that jump.

It will play the winner of the Australia-Czech Republic game, which will take place on Wednesday at 9 a.m. ET. Charlotte Hornets big man Willy Hernang\u00f3mez scored 18 points and former Portland Trail Blazers swingman Rudy Fernandez added 16 as Spain (6-0) prevailed after suffering quarterfinal round losses in its last two World Cups \u2014 by France in 2014, and by Serbia in 2010 when the tournament was still called the world championship. A.J. Slaughter scored 19 points and Adam Waczynski finished with 15 for Poland (4-2), which is assured of finishing no worse than eighth at its first appearance at the World Cup since 1967. Poland got within 76-72 on a layup by Waczynski with 5:42 remaining, but Spain pulled away over the next three minutes.

Patricio Garino added 15 for Argentina (6-0), which will face either the U.S. or France in Friday\u2019s semifinals. Serbia was considered the pre-tournament favorite by many, and came in expecting to win gold after losing title games to the U.S. at the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympics. Argentina had other plans and Scola made a very loud statement after the game \u2014 this outcome, he insisted, was no fluke. \u201cIt just bothers me that people keep talking about miracle, keep talking about surprise, keep talking about nobody believing,\u201d Scola said. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you, there were 22 people that believed for the last two months that we were going to be here. That\u2019s all we need, just 22. We\u2019ve got them and this is far from a miracle.\u201d Bogdan Bogdanovic scored 21 points for Serbia (4-2). The team came into the tournament fully expecting to win gold \u2014 after losing title games to the U.S. at the 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Olympics, then rolling to wins in its first two games in China by a combined 105 points. Bogdanovic\u2019s 3-pointer with 1:20 left got Serbia within 91-85, capping a spurt that came with All-NBA center Nikola Jokic of the Denver Nuggets on the bench. But Campazzo\u2019s jumper on the next possession pushed the lead back to eight, Serbia threw the ball away seconds later and the blue-and-white-clad Argentine fans in the stands knew it was time to celebrate.  Scola was 26 the last time Argentina was in the Final Four of the World Cup, then called the world championship. A mere 13 years later, he\u2019s headed back to the medal round at FIBA\u2019s biggest event. Once known as team chock full of NBA players, Argentina was one of 15 countries in the FIBA World Cup to not have an active NBA player on its roster. Scola last played in an NBA game on Feb. 13, 2017 as a member of the Brooklyn Nets. Nemanja Bjelica scored 18 and Jokic finished with 16 points and 10 rebounds for Serbia. \u201cWe put a lot of work in this summer,\u201d Bjelica said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard. But it\u2019s basketball. There are more important things.\u201d Argentina led most of the way, lost the lead briefly on the first possession of the fourth quarter when Marko Guduric made a 3-pointer for Serbia \u2014 which the winners answered with a 19-6 run over the next 6 minutes. Center Boban Marjanovic had a short and eventful second-quarter stint for Serbia \u2014 picking up three fouls, one of them an unsportsmanlike, and committing a turnover in just over 2 minutes. Additionally, the Olympic berth Argentina claimed by being one of the top two World Cup finishers from the Americas region \u2014 the U.S. is the other \u2014 is its fifth straight and eighth overall.

Thirty-two teams were whittled down to eight for a single-elimination tournament in which a few teams have a legit chance of winning the whole thing. For evidence that anything can happen in a 40-minute game, witness Argentina\u2019s win over Serbia in Tuesday\u2019s quarterfinal. Come Wednesday at 7 a.m. ET, the U.S. will face a must-win situation for the first time in this tournament (much like Serbia did on Tuesday). Although they have yet to face elimination \u2014 and there will be no easing into this tournament \u2014 the Americans feel ready for the quarterfinals because they\u2019ve taken every game as critical. \u201cThat\u2019s sort of been our approach from the get-go,\u201d Joe Harris said after the conclusion of pool play on Monday. \u201c[USA coach Gregg Popovich] talked about this is June basketball. That\u2019s what our mentality\u2019s got to be like. Each time we prepare for a team and play, it has to be with that sense of urgency.\u201d France presents serious challenges on both ends of the floor. And though they\u2019re anchored by two-time reigning Kia Defensive Player of the Year Rudy Gobert, the French have had more success on offense. Through pool play, the French ranked second in the World Cup offensively, having scored an estimated 123 points per 100 possessions. The last time these two nations met on the international stage (in a non-elimination, pool play at the 2016 Olympics ), France shot 56 percent and the U.S. escaped with a three-point win. France has three main ball-handlers \u2014 Nicolas Batum, Nando De Colo and Evan Fournier \u2014 who can create offense. Fournier (31) and De Colo (26) combined for 57 points in France\u2019s loss to Australia on Monday. \u201cThey\u2019re sort of similar to us in that regard,\u201d Harris said, \u201cwhere they have guys that can beat you off the bounce, make plays for themselves and for other guys.\u201d In regard to ball movement, France (which has assisted on 64 percent of its field goals) is closer to the U.S. (61 percent) than it is to Australia (78 percent) or Spain (77 percent). The Americans rank 18th at the World Cup in 3-point percentage (32.7 percent) while France ranks first (47.4 percent), which makes containing the dribble and avoiding rotations all the more critical. France hasn\u2019t played any zone defense at World Cup, but that doesn\u2019t mean that they won\u2019t play any zone on Wednesday. Given their size (they start five guys 6-foot-6 or taller), the French would be able to extend that zone out high. The United States struggled against the zone in its overtime win against Turkey in its second World Cup game, but has improved its execution in its three games since. Whether the French are playing zone or man-to-man defense, getting all the way to the rim will be difficult for the Americans in their half-court offense. The 7-foot-1 Gobert would prefer to hang back in the paint on pick-and-rolls. That means Kemba Walker and Donovan Mitchell will have pull-up opportunities at the elbows, and the screener will have pick-and-pop looks from the perimeter. Australia\u2019s Aron Baynes shot 5-for-6 from 3-point range against France on Monday. Myles Turner has attempted just three 3-pointers in 98 minutes at the World Cup. Brook Lopez, meanwhile, has shot just 2-for-12 from beyond the arc. Turner will start Wednesday, but it will be interesting to see how quickly (and for how long) the U.S. goes to a small-ball lineup with Harrison Barnes at center. The U.S. has had better numbers, particularly on offense, playing small (plus-35 points per 100 possessions in 72 minutes) than its been with a center on the floor (plus-18), even though none of those small-ball minutes came in its 53-point win over Japan. Barnes has had some issues defending centers in the low post, but Gobert is not a post-up center. France also ranks 29th out of 32 teams at the World Cup in offensive rebounding percentage, so they wouldn\u2019t necessarily crush a smaller U.S. lineup on the glass. The matchup provides a unique opportunity for Mitchell, who will face Gobert (his Utah Jazz teammate) for the first time in international competition. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a lot of trash talk for sure,\u201d Mitchell said Monday. \u201cI think that makes this fun, being able to compete against your teammates in a setting outside of the NBA. For me, I\u2019ve heard so much about FIBA basketball, heard so much about the last time France played the USA, when they played Spain with Ricky [Rubio], when they played against Australia. \u201cI\u2019m excited. He\u2019s a hell of a player. He won Defensive Player of the Year for a reason. I think guys know that and I\u2019m going to try to give them as much info as possible.\u201d A return from Jayson Tatum, who has missed the last three games with a left ankle injury, would give the U.S. some more small-ball versatility, as well as another attacker off the dribble. As of Monday morning, Tatum didn\u2019t sound confident that he\u2019d be back for the quarterfinal. Collectively, the Americans sound more confident with each passing game. Of course, few of them have been in a international elimination game that goes down to the wire. \u201cThis is what we came here for,\u201d Khris Middleton said. \u201cThis is what we\u2019re playing on this team for, these type of games, these type of moments.\u201d * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

He was 67. The Cavaliers said McLeod died suddenly but did not elaborate. A popular play-by-play man because of his fervor and his rapport with commentator and former Cavs guard Austin Carr, McLeod did play-by play of the Cavs for 15 years following a long stint with the Pistons. McLeod grew up in the Cleveland area, the city\u2019s sports teams in his blood. After LeBron James and the Cavs stormed back from a 3-1 deficit to beat the Golden State Warriors for the title three years ago, McLeod called the game\u2019s final seconds and then broke down in tears. It was the first championship for a Cleveland team since 1964. James expressed his condolences on Twitter: \u201cMay you rest in Paradise my friend!\u201d The Cavs mourned the loss of a \u201cgreat friend and teammate.\u201d \u201cFred\u2019s deep love for Cleveland and the Cavaliers was clearly evident in everything he did in and around the community and on-air during his more than 1,000 Cavalier game broadcasts,\u201d the team said. \u201cHe was a true, heart-felt ambassador for the team, fans and entire greater Cleveland community.\u201d McLeod spent 22 seasons announcing Pistons games before joining the Cavs in 2006. He recently celebrated his 36th season in broadcasting. McLeod also served as a TV announcer for the Indians and Tigers. McLeod spent a few years working in San Francisco and was covering the California-Stanford game when the Golden Bears returned a kickoff on the game\u2019s final play, with one of their players weaving through Stanford band members over the final few yards into the end zone. In 2014, McLeod told Cavaliers.com that he instructed his cameraman to film the final seconds in case something strange happened. And it did \u2013 perhaps one of the most famous plays in college football history. \u201cUsually, the photographers would break down (equipment) and head down to the locker room,\u201d McLeod said. \u201cBut I said to the camera guy: `Let\u2019s just shoot it, we have time.\u2019 I always had to fight game traffic to get back to the studio, but I always like to live on the edge a little bit anyway, so I said: `Just continue to shoot because you never know what could happen.\u201d\u2018 McLeod is survived by his wife, Beth, a TV meteorologist in Cleveland, and three children, Sean, Jenna and Molly."},{"id":31913,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-grizzlies-expect-iguodala-camp","date":"2019-09-09","title":"Report: Grizzlies expect Iguodala in camp","content":" Andre Iguodala will remain with the Memphis Grizzlies for now, with the team declining to consider a buyout that would allow him to join a contender, The Athletic\u2019s Shams Charania reported Tuesday.

Sometimes, it\u2019s not. Only four of the nine rotation players for Turkey, the team that almost beat the U.S. in its second game here at the FIBA World Cup, were in the rotation for Turkey at Eurobasket two years ago . In comparison to this version of Team USA, which came together exactly five weeks ago Monday, yes, the opponent typically has more continuity from summer to summer. The \u201cthey\u2019ve been playing together for a long time\u201d thing has also been drilled into American players as they prepare for FIBA play. It comes out of their mouths pretty easily when they\u2019re asked about an opponent or why a game was tougher than it should have been in regard to the talent on the floor. Maybe it\u2019s an excuse. Maybe it\u2019s just reality. USA coach Gregg Popovich, in talking after his team\u2019s 89-73 victory over Brazil on Monday, said, \u201cThose guys have been together awhile\u201d about the opponent. But down the hall from where Popovich took the podium, there was something new. It was the opponent saying the following about the Americans : \u201cIt looks like they\u2019ve been playing together for a long time.\u201d The opponent was NBA veteran Anderson Varejao , who has seen multiple versions of the U.S. National Team. And after facing this one, he made note of the chemistry. \u201cThat\u2019s a great complement,\u201d Kemba Walker said when told about Varejao\u2019s appraisal. \u201cI think we\u2019re getting it.\u201d If there ever was a U.S. National Team where the whole needed to be greater than the sum of the parts, this is it. This team does not have the offensive superstars that past teams have had. In the gold medal game of the 2010 World Championship, Kevin Durant scored 28 points against Turkey. In the gold medal game of the 2012 Olympics , he dropped 30 on Spain. In 2014, Kyrie Irving and James Harden combined for 52 points against Serbia in the World Cup final. And in the 2016 Olympics , the U.S. took gold behind another 30 points from Durant against the Serbs. Through five games at this tournament, no U.S. player has scored more than 20 points in a game. And the only 20-point game came from Jaylen Brown against a team (Japan) that went 0-5 with the tournament\u2019s third worst defense, statistically. That doesn\u2019t mean that the U.S. can\u2019t be a good offensive team. It just has to be a more cohesive offensive team than American teams of the past. \u201cWe just need each other so bad,\u201d Walker said. \u201cAnd I think we\u2019re starting to realize that each and every game. These teams are so good. These teams are so tough. It\u2019s just taking everybody and everything we\u2019ve got to win these games. The chemistry is coming along really well.\u201d You could start to see it against Greece on Saturday , though the Americans shot just 36 percent and barely scored a point per possession (69 on 68). The ball movement was sharper than it had been previously and they got a lot of open shots that just didn\u2019t fall. Some of those shots started to fall on Monday, and the U.S. had its second-most efficient offensive game of the 10 its played (including exhibitions), scoring 89 points on 75 possessions (1.19 per). The only more efficient game its had was against the aforementioned, 30th-ranked Japan defense. In that Japan game, the U.S. never scored on more than five consecutive possessions. Prior to Monday at the World Cup, its longest stretch of consecutive scores was six straight against the Czech Republic in Game 1 . In that ugly win over Greece on Saturday, the U.S. never scored on more than three consecutive possessions, and only twice scored on three straight. But spanning the third and fourth quarters against Brazil on Monday, the U.S. scored 10 straight times. It was a 24-10 run that broke the game open and was fueled by an offense that\u2019s gaining more confidence and more cohesion, especially against zone defense, which was a real struggle just six days earlier. \u201cI think we\u2019re starting to get more familiar with one another,\u201d Joe Harris said. \u201cI think you see it every game where the ball really moves a lot offensively, and then you\u2019re sacrificing for one another defensively.\u201d There was some individual excellence in that run, but the final three points came when Myles Turner made a quick flash to the ball and an even quicker pass to Walker for a three from the top of the key against the zone. The U.S. had mostly been winning with a defense that ranks first in the World Cup (84 estimated points allowed per 100 possessions) through pool play. Defense will remain critical, because the offense of their opponent (France) in Wednesday\u2019s quarterfinal ranks second (123 estimated points scored per 100), behind only that of the potential opponent in the semifinals (Serbia, 129 per 100). Although this U.S. team doesn\u2019t have those elite bucket-getters, it will still need to get buckets \u2014 and it will need to get them via cohesion, quick actions and decisiveness (like Turner displayed on his assist to Walker). Sometimes, you can get by on talent. The U.S. is, once again, the only team in the tournament with 12 NBA players. But this team needs to get more out of its talent than teams of the past. The more games they play, the more the Americans know what they\u2019re doing collectively . They\u2019ve seemingly taken a big step forward over the last week. And in the eyes of Varejao, the U.S. is, for once, one of the teams that \u201chas been playing together for a long time.\u201d \u201cChemistry is built once you hit adversity together and you got to push through it,\u201d Jaylen Brown said, \u201cand we\u2019ve been challenged multiple times on this trip.\u201d The toughest challenge to date will come Wednesday against the best opponent the U.S. has faced in the first elimination game its played. But the Americans seem more ready, and more together, than ever. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

However, since margin of victory has tiebreaker implications at the FIBA World Cup, Greece will not be moving on. It needed to win by 12 points or move to surpass the Czechs in the standings. The victory by Greece did secure a quarterfinals spot for Team USA, which defeated Brazil to lock up the top seed in Group K. Even though they lost on Monday, the Czechs have reached quarterfinals and will face Australia on Wednesday thanks to Team USA defeating Brazil. Antetokounmpo finished with 12 points, nine rebounds, four assists and three steals while his brother, Thanasis, had 11 points and two rebounds. Former Memphis Grizzlies guard Nick Calathes was the top scorer for Greece, notching 27 points (on 5-for-9 3-point shooting), six rebounds, six assists and three steals. Chicago Bulls guard Tomas Satoransky flirted with a triple-double (13 points, eight assists, nine rebounds) in the win for the Czech Republic. Thanks to some clutch free throws from Matthew Dellavedova, a late defensive stand by Patty Mills and sharp shooting from Aron Baynes all game long, Australia remains perfect in FIBA World Cup play. Dellavedova drew a foul on Rudy Gobert, the star center for France and the Utah Jazz, with less than 20 seconds to play, which led to Gobert fouling out. Dellavedova drove the lane with under 5 seconds to play and drew a foul on Vincent Poirer, going 1-for-2 to give Australia a 99-98 advantage.  On the next possession, France\u2019s Andrew Albicy threw a bad inbounds pass that was picked off by the San Antonio Spurs\u2019 Mills, who quickly passed to Mitch Creek. Creek was fouled on a last-second heave, went 1-for-3 from the line and Australia had its win. The victory ensures that France will take on USA in the FIBA World Cup quarterfinals, while Australia will take on the Czech Republic. Both games will be held Wednesday. Baynes, a burly big man for the Phoenix Suns, was sizzling all night from 3-point range. Although he is a career 28.1% 3-point shooter in the NBA, Baynes went 5-for-6 on 3-pointers, including a clutch 3-pointer with 2:51 left that gave Australia a 90-89 lead. Mills led Australia with 30 points (on 10-for-18 shooting) while Jazz forward Joe Ingles was solid as well (23 points) in the win.  For France, Orlando Magic swingman Evan Fournier had 31 points, six rebounds and four assists to lead the way. Former NBA player Nando De Colo had 26 points off the bench while Charlotte Hornets forward Evan Fournier had 13 points. The United States Men\u2019s National Team clinched a spot in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics with a 89-73 win over Brazil at the FIBA World Cup on Monday. The U.S. now moves on to the quarterfinals of the FIBA World Cup (a berth the Americans clinched with Greece\u2019s win over the Czech Republic earlier in the day) as one of four teams with 5-0 records through pool play. The U.S. will play France (4-1) in the quarterfinals in Dongguan on Wednesday (7 a.m. ET). The winner of that game will face the winner of Tuesday\u2019s game between Argentina (5-0) and Serbia (4-1) in the semifinals. The Czech Republic (3-2) advanced to the other half of the bracket via a point-differential tiebreaker over Brazil (3-2) and Greece (3-2). Brazil\u2019s run in the FIBA World Cup has come to an end despite a 3-2 overall finish in FIBA World Cup play. The U.S. Team\u2019s win solidified the quarterfinal bracket, in which Argentina will meet Serbia and Spain will play Poland on Tuesday. Lithuania ended its run in the 2019 FIBA World Cup with a victory, defeating the Dominican Republic in resounding fashion. Memphis Grizzlies center Jonas Valanciunas was strong all game long, finishing with 19 points and 10 rebounds to power the victory. Former New York Knicks forward Mindaugas Kuzminskas was also solid in the win, notching 12 points and four rebounds.  Although the Dominican Republic cut Lithuania\u2019s halftime lead to seven (after trailing by as much as 14 points), it faltered and finished its FIBA World Cup run at 2-3. In classification round action, Germany pulled away from Canada in the fourth quarter to finish atop the Group P standings at 3-2. Canada finishes its FIBA World Cup run at 2-3 to cap off a disappointing showing at the FIBA tournament.  Oklahoma City Thunder guard Dennis Schroder had 21 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists to pace Germany\u2019s victory. Dallas Mavericks big man Maxi Kleber also was solid in the victory, adding 20 points and four rebounds. Canada was paced by Orlando Magic center Khem Birch (15 points, nine rebounds) and former Houston Rockets big man Kyle Wiltjer (18 points, five rebounds). In the classification round, New Zealand closed out its play in the 2019 FIBA World Cup with a thrilling finish. Isaac Fotu nailed a 2-foot hook shot with 30 seconds left to push New Zealand past Turkey, 102-101. The country finished 3-2 overall in World Cup play, including a 2-0 run through the classification round. For Turkey, Cleveland Cavaliers forward Cedi Osman had 32 points (12-for-21 shooting), six rebounds, four assists and three steals in the loss. Former Boston Celtics center Semih Erden had 12 points and two rebounds in the defeat for Turkey, which finished 2-3 in FIBA World Cup play.

The United States\u2019 win over Greece on Saturday came with execution of the defensive game plan , but also with a heavy dose of small-ball. The U.S. played more than half of the game (21.5 minutes) with none of its three centers on the floor. That was more than double the small-ball minutes that the U.S. had played in any of its previous eight games (exhibitions included). Greece had a pair of 7-1 guys \u2013 Ioannis Bourousis and Georgios Papagiannis in its rotation, but they combined to shoot 1-for-8. Playing small, with Harrison Barnes at center for almost all of those 21.5 minutes allowed the U.S. to be a little quicker in its rotations after shading toward Giannis Antetokounmpo and forcing him to give up the ball. In general, it also allows the U.S. to switch more screens and avoid even having to rotate. The benefits offensively didn\u2019t really show up on Saturday, but playing with five guards and forwards allows for a little more versatility, playmaking and shooting on that end of the floor, especially against a zone defense, which the U.S. has seen a lot of over the last few games. The U.S. has played small for just a little over 60 minutes total. But the numbers are strong on both ends of the floor, and they don\u2019t include any minutes against Japan. Minutes from that game would skew the overall numbers a bit, but the U.S. had at least one center on the floor for all 40 minutes in its easiest win so far (in part because it was missing two of its perimeter players). Of course, when he wants to play small, U.S. head coach Gregg Popovich is asking a lot of Barnes, who has taken some elbows to the chest and head as he\u2019s defended bigger guys in the post. \u201cPop likes positionless basketball,\u201d Barnes said when asked about playing the five. \u201cI\u2019ve definitely gotten used to it. It\u2019s something that I feel more and more comfortable doing.\u201d And we may see more of it going forward. Against Brazil on Monday (8:30 a.m. ET), the U.S. shouldn\u2019t be too afraid of Anderson Varejao or Cristiano Felicio inside, though Felicio has grabbed 5.8 offensive rebounds per 30 minutes at the World Cup. In a potential quarterfinals matchup against France, it would be very interesting to see the U.S. play small against Rudy Gobert, who has the ability to just remain in the paint defensively under FIBA rules. Australia is another potential opponent in the quarters, and the U.S. was solid defensively in more than 12 exhibition minutes playing small against the Boomers, even though the second of those exhibition games was, overall, the Americans\u2019 worst defensive performance by far. Serbia and Spain (potential opponents in the semifinals or final) bring similar offensive looks to Australia, playing off their centers in the high post. If they play either or both of those teams, the U.S. will have to decide if size or mobility is more important against Nikola Jokic or Marc Gasol. But playing small is clearly something that both Barnes and Popovich are getting more comfortable with. The United States is not only playing for a place in the quarterfinals on Monday. If it wins (or if we get the fourth or fifth scenario below), it will officially qualify for next year\u2019s Olympics in Tokyo. Two of the seven teams that will officially qualify for the Olympics out of the World Cup are the top two finishers from the Americas. Argentina has reached the quarters out of Group I, and the U.S. and Brazil are the only other possible quarterfinalists among teams from the Americas. So if one team makes it and the other doesn\u2019t, that team has qualified (along with Argentina) for the Olympics. The one scenario where both Brazil and the U.S. make it to the quarterfinals is the last one below. In that case, it would be three teams from the Americas still vying for the top two spots (with the World Cup having a loser\u2019s bracket once it reaches the quarters). Group K enters Monday\u2019s action with none of the four teams having clinched a spot in the quarter finals or having been eliminated. At 4-0, the United States is in the driver\u2019s seat, but still has some business to take care of to book its trip to either Dongguan (if it finishes first in Group K) or Shanghai (if it finishes second) for a quarterfinal game on Wednesday. The two teams that advance out of Group K will be placed on opposite sides of the bracket, but will each face a team from Group L. The two teams that have advanced from Group L are Australia and France, who will play each other on Monday (8 a.m. ET) for first place. First place in Group K (the U.S. if it beats Brazil) will play second place in Group L in the top half of the bracket , which also includes Argentina (first place in Group I) and Serbia (second place in Group J). Second place in Group K will play first place in Group L in the bottom half of the bracket, which also includes Spain (first place in Group J) and Poland (second place in Group I). Back to the last day of the second round \u2026 The Czech Republic will play Greece in the first game in Shenzhen on Monday (4:30 a.m. ET), with Greece needing to win by at least 12 points to stay alive. Here are the different scenarios in play: Czech Republic beats Greece, United States beats Brazil. Greece beats Czech Republic by less than 12, United States beats Brazil. Greece beats Czech Republic by 12 or more, United States beats Brazil. (We\u2019ll assume that Greece doesn\u2019t win by at least 44, which would move Brazil above the Czech Republic in the above scenario.) Czech Republic beats Greece, Brazil beats United States by less than 21. Czech Republic beats Greece, Brazil beats United States by 21. Czech Republic beats Greece, Brazil beats United States by 22. Czech Republic beats Greece, Brazil beats United States by 23 or more. Greece beats Czech Republic, Brazil beats United States. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

Marcus Smart was guarding him and no other U.S. defender was within 10 feet. But when Antetokounmpo spun toward the baseline, Derrick White raced over from the right elbow and cut off his path toward a reverse layup. Antetokounmpo picked up his dribble and spun back toward the middle, where he was met by Myles Turner. Caught in a crowd of three American defenders, he kicked the ball out to Nick Calathes, who Turner had been defending, on the left wing. Before Calathes could shoot, Jaylen Brown had rotated over from the foul line. Calathes rotated the ball to Kostas Papanikolaou at the top of the key, but Donovan Mitchell was closing out hard, so Papanikolaou swung the ball to Ioannis Bourousis on the right wing, where White was racing back. And as Bourousis made one more pass toward Ioannis Papapetrou in the right corner, the shot clock expired. The defense forced a turnover with a combination of execution and effort. Smart pumped his fist, while White clapped hard three times. Brown and Turner slapped five. Assistant coaches Steve Kerr and Lloyd Pierce got up off the bench, threw their fists in the air and screamed. \u201cThe reactions showed where our pride is at,\u201d Mitchell said afterward. \u201cWe\u2019ve had great offensive possessions. But the reaction from the bench, from the coaches, from the guys on the floor, the way we all reacted to that was huge, because that\u2019s where we hang our hat. That\u2019s what we want to do. \u201cThat was a big possession, being able to lock in and then rotate out of that. It\u2019s tough to do. It\u2019s not as easy as we made it look that play.\u201d That was the story of the game. Not the turnover part (Greece only committed 10), but the U.S. executing its game plan of showing Antetokounmpo a crowd and forcing other guys to beat them. Antetokounmpo shot 7-for-11, but after scoring five points in the first minute of the game, he finished with just 15. And because his teammates shot so poorly \u2013 Greek players that didn\u2019t win the NBA MVP award last season shot 25 percent \u2013 he didn\u2019t have a single assist. The last United States defeat at a major tournament was to Greece at the semifinals of the 2006 World Championship. And after that loss, USA head coach Mike Krzyzewski referred to Greek stars Theo Papaloukas and Vassilis Spanoulis as \u201cnumber four\u201d and \u201cnumber seven.\u201d After that, the U.S. improved its scouting and Krzyzewski made a point to learn (and pronounce) the names of every key player for every opponent. This year, the U.S. scouting staff, led by Jeff Van Gundy, will leave no stone unturned.  The game plan for Saturday went far beyond \u201cWe should focus on Giannis, because he\u2019s the best player.\u201d The Americans dug into the numbers and realized that only one of Antetokounmpo\u2019s teammates had shot well both for Greece this summer and in their previous professional season. That player was Papapetrou. \u201cHe was the lone guy that had shot pretty consistently in the tournament and in his previous season,\u201d Joe Harris explained. \u201cThe rest of the guys [were] not that consistent from three. So that\u2019s why we wanted to get into a close-out game, where we just loaded up on Giannis and then we\u2019re cognizant of Papapetrou, and then everybody else, it\u2019s almost like you\u2019re closing out short.\u201d The game plan was not executed so well on the first possession of the game when Antetokounmpo isolated on Harrison Barnes, drove toward the left block, and then spun to the middle. Neither weak-side defender \u2013 Kemba Walker or Mitchell \u2013 was there to meet the spin move and Antetokounmpo laid the ball in for the first two points of the game. He then hit a pull-up three over Barnes on the next possession. But the Americans didn\u2019t panic. \u201cAt the end of the day, he\u2019s an MVP,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cSo he\u2019s going to make plays, going to make shots. But the biggest thing for us is not to overreact.\u201d The Americans would go on to shoot just 36 percent themselves, but still win by 16, because they held Greece to just 53 points on 69 possessions (0.77 per). In fact, Greece scored less than a point per possession in all four quarters. Antetokounmpo didn\u2019t play at all in the fourth, but that was one of their better offensive quarters. Over the second and third, Greece scored just 20 points on 34 possessions. \u201cCollectively, everybody was so locked in,\u201d Harris said. \u201cEvery time you play against somebody like Giannis, you have to be really locked into the game plan. The rules allow for us to pack in, make it difficult for him driving the ball, try force him to try to beat you over the top. I thought for pretty much most of the evening, with the exception of the first play of the game, we did pretty good.\u201d Through Saturday, the U.S. has the World Cup\u2019s No. 1 defense, having allowed its opponents to score an estimated 82 points per 100 possessions.  \u201cWe all love playing defense,\u201d Smart said. \u201cWe knew coming in what we could do.\u201d The offense now ranks just 12th, having scored an estimated 110 points per 100. While the Americans have taken a tournament-high 46 percent of their shots from 3-point range, they\u2019ve shot just 32.8 percent (18th of 32 teams) from beyond the arc. Maybe that number gets better going forward, and maybe the defense has to keep getting better as the U.S. faces tougher opponents. Their two potential opponents in the quarterfinals (Australia and France) currently rank sixth and third in offensive efficiency, respectively. \u201cWhen you look at past USA teams, scoring has not been an issue,\u201d Barnes said. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of talent. But for us, we know that defense is how we\u2019re going stay in games, how we\u2019re going to be able to compete. I think we\u2019ve done a good job of focusing on that, and that\u2019s really what\u2019s carrying us.\u201d Four games down, four to go. The U.S. will play Brazil in its final pool-play game on Monday with quarterfinal positioning on the line. Then it\u2019s on to the knockout rounds, where the defense may have to be even better than its been so far. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

The USA was better. And the Antetokounmpo getting talked about most by the Americans when this much-anticipated World Cup matchup was over wasn\u2019t Giannis \u2014 but rather Thanasis, the younger brother, who sent U.S. forward Harrison Barnes sprawling with an ill-advised foul from behind on a fast break in the final moments. Barnes avoided injury, and the U.S. avoided defeat. Kemba Walker scored 15 points and handed out six assists, Donovan Mitchell scored 10 on his 23rd birthday and the U.S. beat Greece 69-53 to move on the cusp of qualifying for the quarterfinals. \u201cWe played well,\u201d Walker said. \u201cWe had a great game plan and we stuck to it and we were able to come out with a big win.\u201d Giannis Antetokounmpo, the NBA\u2019s MVP from the Milwaukee Bucks, scored 15 points but sat out the fourth quarter in a move Greek officials said was made to rest him for the team\u2019s last-ditch effort to make the quarterfinals on Monday. He didn\u2019t make himself available for postgame comment, telling officials that he was too upset. The U.S. national team has won 57 consecutive games in international tournaments with NBA players, starting with the 2006 world championships bronze-medal game and continuing through every FIBA Americas, world championships, World Cup and Olympic event since. The streak started after a 101-95 loss to Greece in 2006 \u2013 a defeat that forced the U.S. to change its program. The Americans haven\u2019t lost in the biggest tournaments since. \u201cIt was a good test for us,\u201d U.S. coach Gregg Popovich said. \u201cAnd it helped us get better. That\u2019s our goal, to get better in every one of these games.\u201d Barnes and Derrick White each scored nine for the U.S., which can clinch a quarterfinal berth Monday in multiple ways \u2013 the simplest being a win over Brazil. There also are ways for the U.S. to move on even if it loses Monday. It was the first time a reigning MVP faced the U.S. in a major tournament, and Giannis Antetokounmpo has made no secret of how much this event means to him. His eyes were closed as he mouthed along with the words of Greece\u2019s national anthem pregame, and when the ball went up he came out firing. He spun his way to a layup on the first possession, made a 3-pointer on Greece\u2019s second possession and got fouled on a baseline drive on the next trip down the floor. That was five points in the first 43 seconds for Antetokounmpo \u2013 but nothing came easy the rest of the way, as the U.S. used no fewer than five different defenders on him at times. Barnes drew the initial assignment, followed by the MVP\u2019s Milwaukee teammate Khris Middleton, Jaylen Brown, Marcus Smart and Myles Turner. \u201cWe just wanted to make it as hard as possible for him, and I think we did a good job,\u201d Smart said. Antetokounmpo had a steal and dunk late in the third, which got plenty of fans out of their seats and Greek fans waving flags. But his night ended soon afterward, although the drama was still going. His brother\u2019s foul from behind on Barnes came with 1:43 left in a 13-point game \u2013 Barnes jumped a pass for a steal near midcourt, had a clear path for a dunk and Thanasis Antetokounmpo sent him tumbling to the court with a hard hit that was ruled a common foul. Players from both teams engaged in words immediately after the play and again after the horn, and Barnes said he never got an apology. \u201cGame was over, so probably was a frustration play or something of that nature,\u201d Barnes said. TIP-INS U.S.: Mitchell\u2019s birthday came a day after Joe Harris turned 28. \u2026 Smart, who has twice missed time with leg injuries this summer, slipped and fell as he chased a loose ball out of bounds with 1:11 left in the first. He stayed in the game. \u2026 The U.S. shot only 36%. Greece: The outcome came five years to the day after the Greeks were ousted by Serbia in the Round of 16 at the 2014 World Cup. \u2026 Nick Calathes became the third Florida player to be part of a loss to the U.S. this summer; Andrew Nembhard played in the Americans\u2019 pre-World Cup win over Canada in Australia, and Scottie Wilbekin played for Turkey in its overtime loss to the U.S. in the group stage. HOLDING LEADS Through four games, the U.S. has trailed for all of 7 minutes, 48 seconds \u2013 out of a possible 165 minutes. The Americans have led for 147:02, and games have been tied for 10:10. CLAMPING DOWN The U.S. has held Japan and Greece to a combined 98 points in the last two games. That represents the fewest points the U.S. has allowed in consecutive games of a major international tournament since the 1988 Olympics, when the Americans gave up 92 in a two-game stretch against Egypt and Puerto Rico.

In addition to shooting a stellar 56 percent, the Czech Republic outrebounded Brazil 39-28 and held its opponent to just 40 percent shooting. But it was Satorasky who was the biggest difference-maker, going for 20 points, seven rebounds and nine assists. Satorasky is the only player in this tournament averaging more than 11 points, six rebounds and six assists. Ondrej Balv\u00edn added 15 points and 11 rebounds for the Czech Republic while Patrik Auda chipped in with 14. V\u00edtor Benite led Brazil with 12 points while former NBA player Leandro Barbosa added 11. Patty Mills delivered once again, this time pouring in 19 points and adding nine rebounds to guide Australia past the Dominican Republic and into the quarterfinals. Mills, who earned Player of the Game for the third time during the tournament, took control of the game late to help Australia fend off a tough test and improve to 4-0 in the World Cup. Mills has now scored 15 or more points in all four tournament games, eclipsing 20 twice.  Eloy Vargas had 16 points and seven rebounds while Victor Liz added 14 for the Dominican Republic. Behind Evan Fournier\u2019s game-high 24 points, France held off Lithuania to secure its spot in the quarterfinals. Nando De Colo came off the bench to add 21 while Nicolas Batum added 12. After leading for most of the game, France held off a late rally from Lithuania, which actually took a 72-70 lead with 3:10 left. But Fournier and De Colo proved to be too much down the stretch, guiding their squad into the next round. Jonas Valanciunas led the way for Lithuania with 18 points and eight rebounds, but it wasn\u2019t enough to prevent his squad from failing to advance to the next round. Lithuania kept the game close despite shooting just 38 percent from the field and 5-for-19 from beyond the arc. There was a bit of controversy near the end of the game, as Gobert knocked Valanciunas\u2019 last free throw off the rim that would\u2019ve tied the game, but no call was made The United States Men\u2019s National Team clinched a spot in the FIBA World Cup quarterfinals with a 69-53 win over Greece on Saturday. The U.S. (now 4-0) took control with a 9-0 run early in the second quarter, led by 13 at the half, and by 17 after the third quarter. Greece started to put together some offense in the fourth, but could never get the lead to within single digits.  The U.S. will play 3-1 Brazil on Monday. It\u2019s potential opponents in the quarterfinals (Wednesday) are Australia and France, who are both 4-0 in Group L. The U.S. now has a 57-game winning streak in (non-exhibition) games with a roster made up entirely of NBA players, going back to the bronze-medal game of the 2006 World Championship. In this Classification 17-32 game Saturday, New Zealand cruised past a Rui Hachimura-less Japan to secure its second win of the tournament. Corey Webster scored a team-high 27 points on 9-for-11 shooting while Isaac Fotu added 23 and 10 rebounds to help New Zealand, which shot a blistering 58 percent from the field and 54.5 from deep, roll to a 30-point victory. Nick Fazekas led Japan with a game-high 31 points and nine rebounds. Daiki Tanaka was the only other player to score in double figures, managing 10 points and five assists. In another Classification 17-32 game , Canada sank 24 3-pointers (24-for-44) in its convincing win over Jordan to shatter the FIBA World Cup single-game 3-point record, previously held by Team USA. The Americans had set the record for the highest number of threes made in a single game in the 1994 World Cup , hitting 19 shots from deep Kyle Wiltjer led the long-distance show, hitting 7-for-9 from beyond the arc for 29 points, while Cory Joseph and Phil Scrubb each nailed three treys. Canada also hit a milestone in terms of playmaking as its 37 assists tied the World Cup all-time single-game record set by Serbia earlier in the tournament. In another Classification 17-32 game , Montenegro had a tight grip on the game through the first three quarters, but four late turnovers in the fourth quarter flipped the script in this one as Turkey turned to a full-court press to secure the win. Cavaliers forward Cedi Osman led the way for Turkey with 19 points while Melih Mahmutoglu added 17 and Scott Wilbekin chipped in nine points and 13 assists. Montenegro fell to 0-4 in China while Turkey improved to 2-2 and is still on track to qualify for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.

It has yet to clinch a berth in the quarterfinals, but the only thing keeping it out would be a loss by at least 22 points to Brazil on Monday. The U.S. took control with a 9-0 run early in the second quarter, led by 13 at the half, and by 17 after the third quarter. Greece started to put together some offense in the fourth, but could never get the lead to within single digits. The U.S. shot just 36 percent from the field and 7-for-30 from 3-point range, but that was plenty good enough, because the Greece offense struggled even more, shooting just 32 percent from the field and just 7-for-27 from beyond the arc. With the loss, Greece needs a win by at least 12 points over the Czech Republic on Monday (along with a Brazil loss) to advance to the quarterfinals. Greece isolated Giannis Antetokounmpo against Harrison Barnes on its first two possessions of the game and he scored five straight points, spinning past Barnes for a layup on the first and draining a pull-up 3 on the second. But the Americans showed the MVP a crowd, and his teammates were unable to convert on their resulting opportunities. The U.S. also had a big advantage at the free-throw line, where it outscored Greece 14-4. Antetokounmpo finished with 15 points (on 7-for-11 shooting) and 13 rebounds. The U.S. had just two players in double-figures: Kemba Walker and Donovan Mitchell with 15 and 10 points, respectively. After missing his team\u2019s win over Japan on Thursday with a quad strain, Marcus Smart returned to action and defended Antetokounmpo for much of his 17 minutes on the floor. Jayson Tatum missed his second straight game with a left ankle sprain. The United States still may need to beat Brazil (3-1) on Monday to clinch first place in Group K . If Team USA reaches the quarterfinals, its potential opponents are Australia and France, who are both 4-0 in Group L.

The star power in the building for this event, as always, was blinding. But at one point during the two-hour Class of 2019 enshrinement ceremony , this group stood shoulder to shoulder across the width of the stage: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Bill Russell, Elgin Baylor, Larry Bird, Julius Erving, Isiah Thomas, Dominque Wilkins, Tom Heinsohn, Ray Allen and Harlem Globetrotters CEO Mannie Jackson. Multiple Mount Rushmores worth of basketball royalty, all there in the service of one inductee who averaged 6.7 points and 5.9 rebounds in six professional seasons. And one who died more than 35 years ago, at age 57, in February 1984. Charles Henry (Chuck) Cooper, selected by the Early African-American Pioneers Committee, might possibly have had the most impressive roster of presenters in the history of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. It\u2019s a tradition of the Hall that each new member gets ushered in on his or her big night by one or more already-enshrined legends. Most ask one or two inductees with whom they shared a particular connection. Former Milwaukee All-Star Sidney Moncrief, for example, had former Bucks coach Don Nelson and teammate Bob Lanier at his side. International pick Vlade Divac was presented by Jerry West, the man who brought Divac to the Los Angeles Lakers. WNBA star Teresa Weatherspoon, selected by the Women\u2019s Committee, was accompanied by peers (and rivals) Cynthia Cooper, Sheryl Swoopes and Tina Thompson. And so on. But Cooper, in his posthumous recognition, stirred enough respect from men whose careers famously and statistically dwarfed his because of what he achieved to help make so many of theirs possible. Cooper was the first black player drafted into the NBA, joining the Boston Celtics when they selected him in the second round in April 1950. He is credited with two others in integrating the league in that 1950-51 season. And Cooper was the last of the three to make it to the Springfield shrine, finally joining Nat \u201cSweetwater\u201d Clifton and Earl Lloyd. Clifton, who previously had played for the Globetrotters, is known for becoming the first African-American player to sign an NBA contract, signing a deal with the New York Knicks that offseason. Lloyd, a ninth-round pick in 1950, was actually the first black to play in an NBA game, thanks to Washington opening its schedule before either Boston or New York. None of them came to be as well-known as Jackie Robinson, who broke baseball\u2019s color barrier more than three years earlier and did so as a solo act with the Brooklyn Dodgers. Cooper, Clifton and Lloyd had each other, though that didn\u2019t help much with each playing and traveling with different teams. Each faced the same sort of discrimination as Robinson, from taunts of fans to being refused service at hotels and restaurants. \u201cEven though they were held to a higher standard, they never faltered,\u201d said Chuck Cooper III, accepting on his father\u2019s behalf. That \u2013 and the strides the NBA and basketball overall have taken off that trio\u2019s early steps \u2013 was what stirred the star-studded show of strong, silent support Friday. Presenters don\u2019t make acceptance speeches. At most, they\u2019re there to absorb some teasing if their inductee is fighting initial jitters. But the Who\u2019s Who symbolically backing Cooper didn\u2019t have to say a word. \u201cThat was serious,\u201d Hall of Famer Spencer Haywood said after the ceremony. \u201cThere was something special going on tonight. Something spiritual.\u201d Devout Christians Bobby Jones and Paul Westphal didn\u2019t shy away from talking about and crediting their faith. Weatherspoon was evangelical, too, in a speech that flipped what sounded like a joke about three frogs into an inspirational lesson in perseverance. Moncrief , Divac , Jack Sikma and others spent more time talking about character than crossovers. Sikma and representatives of the Wayland Baptist University women\u2019s teams from 1948-82 had the largest \u2014 or at least most vocal \u2014 fan-and-family contingents. Family members appeared on behalf of player Carl Braun , an early Knicks star also elected posthumously, and coach Bill Fitch , who did not travel due to health. Al Attles, 82, a Warriors\u2019 player, coach and executive for 60 years, attended but taped his speech in advance. So did Dick Barnett , also 82, the former Knicks guard who represented Tennessee A&I\u2019s consecutive NAIA title teams from 1957-59 before the Boston Celtics or UCLA Bruins ever thought of a \u201cthree-peat.\u201d Barnett spoke forcefully about the racial injustices he and his teammates encountered, barred as they were from participating in the NCAA. He talked of opening eyes and changing some minds, too. \u201cIt was teams like Tennessee A&I that made me appreciate the game,\u201d Abdul-Jabbar said in a video. The Class of 2019 slipped in between last year\u2019s group heavy on household names \u2013 notably, Grant Hill, Jason Kidd, Steve Nash and Allen \u2013 and a 2020 crew that is expected to feature icons Kobe Bryant, Tim Duncan and Kevin Garnett. It made for some newfound appreciation Friday for some performers and contributors who might have been missed the first time around or had their talents and achievements dusted off for a global television audience. No one fit that category more than Cooper, who waited longer for Hall recognition than Lloyd (2003) or Clifton (2014). Upon drafting the 6-foot-5 forward from Duquesne, Celtics founder Walter Brown reportedly said, \u201cI don\u2019t give a damn if he\u2019s striped, plaid or polka-dot.\u201d Brown\u2019s decision was credited years later by Lloyd for his team\u2019s willingness to take him seven rounds later. \u201cIf the Celtics did not draft Chuck in the second round, you could not tell me that the Washington Capitols in 1950 were going to make me the first black player to play in this league,\u201d Lloyd once told the Boston Globe. \u201cNo way. The Boston Celtics had a tremendous influence on my acceptance in the NBA.\u201d Cooper\u2019s immediate embrace by coach Red Auerbach, roommate Bob Cousy and teammate Heinsohn aided the integration of other teams that changed their outlooks or felt some pressure to stay competitive. Cousy, for instance, talked about Cooper last year in the book The Last Pass that focused heavily on his relationship with Russell, the NBA\u2019s first black star. The Celtics point guard recalled a night in Raleigh, North Carolina, after a neutral site game in February 1952, when Cooper wasn\u2019t permitted to stay with the team at a segregated hotel. He volunteered to take an overnight train to New York for their next game, and Cousy volunteered to join him. Waiting at the station, they were faced with \u201cwhites only\u201d and \u201ccolored only\u201d restrooms, a first for both men. Cousy suggested they walk to the end of the platform to relieve themselves in the darkness. Standing side by side, they did. \u201cThe Rosa Parks moment, we couldn\u2019t talk about,\u201d Cousy said years later. That helps explain why all those legends were on the stage Friday, standing shoulder to shoulder for Chuck Cooper. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Also honored at Springfield\u2019s Symphony Hall were the 1957-59 teams from Tennessee A&I, a historically black school that won three straight NAIA titles a decade before Texas Western fielded the first all-black starting five in the NCAA Tournament. The Hutcherson Flying Queens from Wayland Baptist \u2013 the first school to offer women\u2019s basketball scholarships \u2013 were also inducted. Sponsored by a local aircraft company, they won a record 131 consecutive games in the 1950s. Sikma had a large contingent to support him, and they broke into laughter when the video screens showed a picture of him with a blonde bowl cut shortly after he was drafted in 1977. A seven-time All-Star in nine seasons with the Sonics, he also played five years with the Milwaukee Bucks and remains the only center in league history to lead the league in free throw percentage for a season (.922 in 1987-88). Divac, who won an Olympic silver medal with Yugoslavia and another with Serbia after the country broke apart in a civil war, was one of the NBA\u2019s first European stars. Among those he thanked were his former Yugoslav teammate Toni Kukoc, who is Croatian. \u201dThe people of the Balkans are like a dysfunctional family.

The game has allowed me to see things I never thought I\u2019d see, meet people I never thought I\u2019d meet.\u201d Cooper, who died in 1984, was a Celtics forward who was the first African-American player drafted by the NBA. He made his debut in 1950 at the same time as Earl Lloyd and Nat \u201dSweetwater\u201d Clifton. \u201dThe NBA\u2019s color barrier was broken, and the game of basketball was forever changed,\u201d his son, Chuck Cooper III said.

That makes it somewhat less exclusive than the minting of a coin \u2013 which is part of this year\u2019s ceremony as well. The 2019 enshrinement ceremony at Symphony Hall Friday night was accompanied by the unveiling of a 2020 Hall of Fame commemorative coin, part of the U.S. Mint\u2019s official program. Designed to celebrate basketball and its players, the Naismith-themed coin is one of just two commemorative coins produced each year by the U.S. Mint. The curved and, in some versions, colorized coins were to make their debut during the enshrinement ceremony broadcast on NBA TV. Hall of Famers Rick Barry and Tina Thompson, the coin\u2019s two artists who were selected during the design competition, and David Ryder, director of the U.S. Mint, were scheduled to participate. The surcharges for the coins will be $35 for gold, $10 for silver and $5 for clad. The U.S. Mint will produce 50,000 gold coins, 400,000 silver and 750,000 clad versions and make them available for purchase next spring, with revenue going to the Hall to help fund its major renovation as well as ongoing expenses.  The Naismith coin is the result of three years of work and lobbying, passing it through Congress before President Trump signed it into law in December. Ryder said he envisions the coin appealing both to hoops fans and coin enthusiasts, not merely the subset of those who enjoy both. \u201cIf they sell \u2018em all out, it will raise about $9.2 million for the Hall of Fame,\u201d Ryder said. \u201cSports is a huge seller to a lot of our customers. With the marketing pull in sports organizations, it will draw that much more traffic.\u201d The 2019 program commemorating the Apollo 11 moon landing, Ryder said, generated nearly $55 million in sales. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

With the win, Spain has clinched a spot in the FIBA World Cup quarterfinals. The San Antonio Spurs\u2019 Marco Belinelli nailed a free throw with 3:58 left to give Italy a 56-52 lead. However, Spain woke up from that point on behind the play of Toronto Raptors center Marc Gasol, Rubio and Sergio Llull. Gasol came up with a big rebound and assisted on a Victor Claver dunk that tied the game at 56 with 3:18 left. Spain turned up its defense, recording three steals over the final minutes \u2014 two of which came by Rubio. He added to that with some critical assists and four made free throws over the game\u2019s final 20 seconds that clinched the win for Spain. Overall, Rubio finished with 15 points, two rebounds and two assists. Juancho Hernangomez of the Denver Nuggets had 16 points and four rebounds, while Llull had 11 points and three rebounds. For Italy, Oklahoma City Thunder forward Danilo Gallinari led the way with 15 points and five rebounds. The team got a solid performance from ex-NBAer Gigi Datome (12 points, three rebounds), but Belinelli struggled all game long (seven points on 3-for-16 shooting). Much like Poland \u2014 although much less surprisingly \u2014 Serbia remained undefeated in FIBA World Cup play as well on Friday. It breezed past Puerto Rico, 90-47, behind its stockade of NBA players. The win, coupled with Italy\u2019s loss to Spain later on Friday, assured Serbia of a spot in the FIBA World Cup quarterfinals. Sacramento Kings forward Nemanja Bjelica was the top scorer with 18 points, while Dallas Mavericks center Boban Marjanovic scored 16 \u2014 10 of which came in the game\u2019s first five minutes. Denver Nuggets star center Nikola Jokic needed just 17 minutes to amass 14 points and 10 rebounds. For the third time in China, Serbia dished out 30 or more assists, (30 now) led by Stefan Jovic (nine assists) and Vasilije Micic (eight). David Huertas scored 11 for Puerto Rico, which shot just 26.6% to Serbia\u2019s 55.7%. In one of the top matchups to watch this weekend, Spain will take on Serbia on Sunday. Puerto Rico also plays Sunday as it will take on Italy. Poland continues to impress on the FIBA World Cup stage, improving to 4-0 with a narrow win against Russia in the second round. Behind an 18-point game from Adam Waczynski and a 14-point, nine-rebound game from Mateusz Ponitka, Poland rallied in the fourth quarter to secure a 79-74 win. The victory, coupled with Argentina\u2019s win against Venezuela later on Friday, ensures Poland of a spot in the FIBA World Cup quarterfinals. Mikhail Kulagin scored 21 and Semen Antonov and Andrey Vorontsevich each added 11 points for Russia, which fell to 2-2 in FIBA World Cup play. Russia will continue its second-round play on Sunday against Venezuela, while Poland will look to move to 5-0 when it takes on Argentina on Sunday as well. Argentina is headed to the quarterfinals of the FIBA World Cup after drubbing Venezuela 87-67 behind a balanced scoring effort. Gabriel Deck put on a show against Venezuela, scoring 25 points on 9-of-12 shooting from the field while Facundo Campazzo had 12 points and nine assists. Former Houston Rockets star Luis Scola scored 15 points, Patricio Garino added 10 and Nicolas Laprovittola finished with nine points, seven assists and five rebounds off the bench. Michael Carrera scored 19 for Venezuela, which shot just 38.8% and was a frigid 6-for-21 (28.6%) on 3-pointers. Venezuela will play Russia on Sunday, while Argentina and undefeated Poland clash Sunday as well. Thanks to the play of Orlando Magic forward Al-Farouq Aminu, Nigeria has helped its chances of qualifying for the 2020 Olympics. Nigera topped Cote D\u2019Ivore 83-66 in Classification 17-32 in Group M play behind a strong second half performance. The win puts Nigeria in the pole position to qualify for the Olympics. In this Classification 17-32 game Friday, Nigeria proved too good with a strong second half showing. It puts them in pole position to qualify directly for the Olympics out of Africa. Aminu finished with 13 points and seven rebounds as Nigeria pulled away from Cote D\u2019Ivore in the third quarter. The win was also paved by two other factors: inside scoring and bench play. Nigeria outscored Cote D\u2019Ivore 44-20 in the paint and had a 39-27 advantage in bench scoring as well. Samad Nikkhah Bahrami shot the lights out with a 5-for-7 showing from 3-point range en route to 21 points in a 71-62 victory against Angola. The victory marked Iran\u2019s first win of the FIBA World Cup. Former Memphis Grizzlies big man Hamed Haddadi finished with nine points and five rebounds, while his backup, Aaron Geramipoor, was solid off the bench (11 points, seven rebounds) as well. In this Classification 17-32 game Friday, Tunisia got its second win of FIBA World Cup play to improve to 3-2 in Group N. Omar Abada led the way in the 86-67 romp against the Philippines, scoring 16 points. Mohamed Hadidane and Makram Ben Romdhane each scored 10 points, with Romdhane adding 10 rebounds as well. Michael Roll had 13 points and nailed a trio of 3-pointers as Tunisia shot 42.3% (11-for-26) from deep in the win. Former NBA player Andray Blatche led the Philippines with 24 points and 11 rebounds, but did not get much help. No other player on the Philippines\u2019 roster scored more than eight points in the defeat. In Classification 17-32 Group M action , China pulled away in the dying stages after surviving a fright from Korea. They are now in pole position to directly qualify for the Olympics from Asia. Former NBA player Yi Jianlian had eight points, nine rebounds, two assists and two blocks in the victory. Qi Zhou (13 points and 14 rebounds) powered China with a balanced game, while Guna Ra played all 40 minutes and led Korea with 21 points and 12 rebounds."},{"id":31944,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/hall-fame-presser-jack-sikma-pivot","date":"2019-09-06","title":"Hall of Fame: Jack Sikma's reverse pivot clears lane to induction","content":" SPRINGFIELD, Mass. \u2014 When Jack Sikma officially enters the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame Friday night, one of his presenters will be Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Which is a terrific example of game recognizing game. Or in this case, move recognizing move. Just as Abdul-Jabbar ranks as the NBA\u2019s most prolific scorer and arguably its greatest player ever, so does his signature sky hook loom as the league\u2019s most famous individual move. Most unstoppable, too, and for defenders, most deflating. Well, Sikma had a signature move of his own, one that helped elevate him from an NAIA program at Illinois Wesleyan to seven NBA All-Star appearances, a championship with the Seattle SuperSonics in 1979 and now to the brink of his craft\u2019s highest honor. It was the reverse pivot or inside pivot, which were its names when it was an arcane maneuver used by a small number of big men, taught mostly at the sport\u2019s lower levels. Once Sikma learned it in 1974, brought it with him to the NBA in 1977 and helped the Sonics reach The Finals as a rookie and win the championship a year later, though, it swiftly became known as his: The Sikma move. \u201cIt was just an experiment after my freshmen season,\u201d Sikma said Thursday at the Hall, after being introduced at a news conference as one of the Class of 2019\u2019s 12 honorees. Others being inducted this weekend: coach Bill Fitch; NBA stars Bobby Jones, Sidney Moncrief and Paul Westphal; as well as WNBA legend Teresa Weatherspoon. Longtime Warriors player, coach and executive Al Attles was elected as a contributor. NBA center and current Sacramento GM Vlade Divac was chosen by the international committee. Being honored posthumously are: guard Carl Braun, a star in the 1950s; and Chuck Cooper, the first black player drafted by an NBA team (Boston, 1950). Finally, there are two college team entries: the Wayland Baptist women\u2019s teams from 1948-82 and the Tennessee A&I teams from 1957-59. Divergent paths, compelling stories all. Including the one about the slender, blond kid from Kankakee, Illinois, whose offensive game needed a makeover. \u201cMy college coach [Dennie Bridges] and I sat down and he said, \u2018Jack, you\u2019ve just got to be more effective in the post if you want to take the next step.\u2019 I was a good shooter \u2013 I\u2019d learned the game as a wing and grew late, so I was comfortable facing the basket. \u201cHe had a friend who suggested, \u2018Hey, down in southern Illinois there are some coaches who do an inside pivot with their guys to face the hoop. It might create a little space for Jack.\u2019 I was really thin \u2013 I just wanted to get dislodged from the defender.\u201d Basically, Sikma choreographically held a mirror to the post-up moves of traditional centers of the time. Holding the ball with his back to the basket, rather than turning on his pivot foot to the outside and attacking over his shoulder, he would spin to the inside. That motion would set up him a few feet back, facing the hoop, allowing for a simple hop and shot. And then there\u2019s this priceless Hubie Brown interview, in which Sikma teaches the move: \u201cA lot of coaches would pooh-pooh it because you\u2019re catching the ball in one spot and then you\u2019re stepping three feet farther away from the basket,\u201d Sikma said. \u201cThat\u2019s not the concept of big-men play, right? But I\u2019ve got to hand it to Coach. He said, \u2018Jack, I think this is it.\u2019 And I said, \u2018I\u2019m not uncomfortable with the pivot.\u2019\u201d Sikma went from averaging 15.4 points as a freshman to 20.3 as a sophomore, with his shots increasing from 14.5 per game to 17.9. By his senior season, he averaged 27.0 points. As Sikma honed it in the NBA, at 6-foot-11, he would hold the ball above his head with a high release point that gave him the option of flipping up his shot or faking, then powering inside. In 14 seasons, by Sikma\u2019s count, he played against 15 Hall of Fame centers, including Abdul-Jabbar. So he wanted every edge he could get. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know which way he was going to go with it,\u201d said fellow inductee Bobby Jones, a Sikma contemporary known for his defensive prowess. \u201cMost of the time he would go back and shoot that shot, but sometimes he would go forward and draw the contact. I was just sitting there thinking, with all the other [inductees], if I ever blocked his shot. And I don\u2019t think I ever did.\u201d Jones, at 6-foot-9, matched up with him early in Sikma\u2019s career (when Sikma was cast as a power forward for Seattle). Later, Jones had to decide how much help to give the teammate guarding Sikma. \u201cThe only thing I could ever have done was maybe come from behind and get him,\u201d Jones said. \u201cBut he was a pretty good passer too. To ever leave your man that much, there\u2019s a danger there.\u201d Opponents weren\u2019t the only ones made uncomfortable by Sikma\u2019s unusual tactic. \u201cI know I surprised some of the officials because I got called for traveling a few times,\u201d Sikma said. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018Nope, I\u2019m not traveling. I\u2019ve got my foot up in the air, I plant it and then I pivot on it. By stepping out, that creates the space.\u2019 \u201cSo even though it was a long time ago, they had film. They checked it out and they realized it wasn\u2019t a walk. But I got called two or three times doing it.\u201d Sikma laughed, recalling chatty Sonics teammate Fred Brown pleading his case for him to some of the referees. \u201cI\u2019d get called and Fred was in the ref\u2019s face, \u2018That\u2019s his move! That\u2019s his move! It\u2019s not a travel,\u201d Sikma said. \u201cFred had seen it enough in practice and figured it out.\u201d Sikma had another facet to his game with which current NBA fans might be more familiar: he was a protypical \u201cstretch 5.\u201d Said Sidney Moncrief, another 2019 Hall newcomer who played for Milwaukee before and after Sikma was traded there for his final five seasons: \u201cPeople don\u2019t remember this about Jack Sikma, but Don Nelson was the first coach who started emphasizing 3-point shots for big men. He put Jack on the perimeter to take the big men out of the lane so we could make plays.\u201d Not unlike current Bucks center Brook Lopez, Sikma underwent a late-career transformation as a deep threat. In his first 11 seasons, Sikma took 68 3-pointers and made seven (10.3 percent). During his final three seasons \u2013 from age 33 to 35 \u2013 Sikma shot 550 times from behind the arc and made 196 (35.6 percent). Still, it\u2019s the quick inside step about 10 feet from the hoop that puts Sikma in a select subset of Hall of Famers already enshrined and those who will be. Call it the Alcove of Famous Moves. Hakeem Olajuwon\u2019s \u201cDream Shake,\u201d Kevin McHale\u2019s up-and-under, George Gervin\u2019s finger roll, Dominique Wilkins\u2019 double-pump reverse, Allen Iverson\u2019s crossover, Dirk Nowitzki\u2019s one-legged fadeaway and Abdul-Jabbar\u2019s sky hook will be joined, in time, by James Harden\u2019s step-back 3-pointer, Manu Ginobili\u2019s Euro-step, LeBron James\u2019 chase-down block and Steph Curry\u2019s long range pull-up 3. Each became or has become a signature move. But that only matters if the idea works. \u201cThey made it look good, so it was effective,\u201d Sikma said. \u201cIf I tried to do the sky hook, if I tried to do the up-and-under, you\u2019d probably think, \u2018Meh, that\u2019s not such a good move.\u2019 A lot of it has to do with how effective a person is doing it.\u201d The 2019 Enshrinement Ceremony at Springfield\u2019s Symphony Hall will air on NBA TV Friday beginning at 6:30 p.m. ET. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

A member of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, Barkley is one of the most beloved athletes ever to play in Philadelphia. Named one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History in 1996, Barkley spent the first eight seasons of his storied career with Philadelphia after the 76ers chose him with the No. 5 overall pick in the 1984 NBA Draft. Over the course of Barkley\u2019s eight years with the 76ers, he tallied 23.3 points, 11.6 rebounds, 3.7 assists and 1.7 steals in 37.3 minutes per game. The \u201cRound Mound of Rebound\u201d shot at least .540 from the field in each season, including a career-best .600 mark in 1989-90. During his tenure in Philadelphia, Barkley was named an All-Star in five straight seasons between 1987-92, as the team reached the playoffs six times, winning 50-plus games three times. He led the league in rebounding in 1986-87, with an average of 14.6 boards per game. One of the most accomplished 76ers off all-time, Barkley ranks in the top-10 in franchise history in offensive rebounds (first), defensive rebounds (first), field-goal percentage (second), total rebounds (third), free throws (fourth), steals (fifth), points (fifth), field goals (sixth) and minutes played (eighth). His .576 field-goal percentage as a 76er is second only to fellow Hall of Famer Wilt Chamberlain (.583). Following his rookie season, Barkley was selected to the 1984-85 All-Rookie First Team, which kicked off a streak of postseason honors lasting his entire Philadelphia career. He was named to the All-NBA Second Team three times and the All-NBA First Team on four occasions. All told for his NBA career, Barkley appeared in 1,073 games (1,012 starts) for Houston, Phoenix and Philadelphia, averaging 22.1 points, 11.7 rebounds, 3.9 assists and 1.5 steals in 36.7 minutes per contest. He was an 11-time All-Star, 11-time All-NBA selection and won the 1992-93 NBA MVP while leading the Suns to the NBA\u2019s best record and an NBA Finals appearance. Barkley, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Chamberlain, Karl Malone, Tim Duncan and Kevin Garnett are the only players in NBA history to post at least 20,000 points, 10,000 rebounds and 4,000 assists in their careers. Barkley\u2019s No. 34 was retired by the team in 2001, and this sculpture will now join fellow 76ers legends Billy Cunningham, Wilt Chamberlain, Maurice Cheeks, Julius Erving, Hal Greer and Bobby Jones along 76ers Legends Walk at the Philadelphia 76ers Training Complex."},{"id":32033,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/team-usa-tops-japan-readies-greece","date":"2019-09-05","title":"Team USA faces an MVP-sized challenge to start second round","content":" SHANGHAI \u2014 Once the United States Men\u2019s National Team went up 13-0 against Japan on Thursday, the more interesting development in regard to the Americans\u2019 path to the elimination rounds was taking place about 200 miles away in Nanjing, where Greece and New Zealand were playing for the final spot in the second round of the FIBA World Cup . It was just a five-point game midway through the fourth quarter, but Greece held on for a six-point win, setting up a matchup with the United States in Shenzhen on Saturday ( 8:30 a.m. ET ). That will be one of two games that the Americans play in second-round Group K , the other coming Monday against Brazil. The top two teams from each second round group advance to the quarterfinals, and first round records (and point differentials) carry over to the second round. So the game against Greece and reigning Kia MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo will not be a do-or-die situation for the U.S., which can probably lose one of its two games in Shenzhen and still advance to the knockout rounds. Greece, because it has already lost to Brazil, probably needs to win both of its games. No matter which side has more urgency, its a matchup that we\u2019ve been looking forward to since before this tournament started. It\u2019s the USA vs. the MVP, maybe the first time since prior to 1992 that the U.S. didn\u2019t have the best player on the floor in a game at the Olympics or World Cup. The Americans just don\u2019t see it as something special. * FIBA World Cup recap: Sept. 5 \u201cYou\u2019re excited about a challenge,\u201d Donovan Mitchell said. \u201cEvery matchup is great. But if we start to look at it as a bigger game than what it is, you lose sight of what we\u2019re focusing on. So we\u2019ll just approach it like a regular game and do what we do.\u201d \u201cWe know the MVP\u2019s on that team, of course,\u201d Kemba Walker added. \u201cBut we\u2019re just going to treat it as another game. We know it\u2019s going to be tough. We know how good of a player he is.\u201d Of course, a \u201cregular game\u201d at the World Cup is not like Game 54 of the NBA season. There can\u2019t be any let up, and the U.S. has to keep getting better each time it plays, because, frankly, it hasn\u2019t been the best team in this tournament to this point. A loss to Greece would put a ton of pressure on the U.S. in its game against Brazil (currently 3-0) on Monday. Their one-point, overtime victory over Turkey surely put a scare in the Americans. And though it\u2019s hard to compare that performance with Thursday\u2019s against an overmatched Japan squad , they clearly played with a little more focus and energy on the final night of the first round. \u201cObviously, you play with a sense of urgency,\u201d Joe Harris said. \u201cOur game the other night against Turkey was a realization that everybody can compete in this tournament. And then you watch their game today with [the Czech Republic] beating them. FIBA is a one-and-done type tournament. It\u2019s similar to March Madness, where there\u2019s upsets all the time. Teams are capable of knocking off one another. \u201c[Tonight\u2019s opponent] could have been Japan, it could have been Greece, it could have been Brazil. You have to have that respect and that appropriate fear for everybody you play against.\u201d Appropriate fear showed up on the defensive end of the floor, where Japan, which had an encouraging performance two days earlier against the Czech Republic, went scoreless on its first eight possessions of the game and scored just eight points on 21 possessions in the third quarter. \u201cI think this is the first game that we\u2019ve done 40 minutes of great defense, great offense,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cObviously, even when shots weren\u2019t falling, we were still getting back and communicating.\u201d With the blowout, the U.S. goes into the second round as the No. 1 defensive team at the World Cup, having allowed an estimated 83 points per 100 possessions. The No. 1 offense by a wide margin (140 points per 100 possessions) belongs to Serbia, which will play Italy on Friday and also face Spain in Group J. A 33-point halftime margin also allowed the Americans to try out their 2-3 zone defense for most of the second half. They probably won\u2019t ever use it in such a heavy dose again, but getting some reps in on Thursday could give coach Gregg Popovich the confidence to utilize it in a time of need (and to take an opponent out of rhythm) going forward. \u201cTeams do it to us,\u201d Mitchell said, \u201cand I think we got to be able to do it against other teams.\u201d Turkey did it to them on Tuesday, and that was a big reason the Americans blew a 15-point lead and probably should have lost. Japan came with a zone defense midway through the first quarter on Thursday, and initially, the U.S. struggled again, scoring just three times on their final 11 possessions of the period.  But that was mostly with a second-unit lineup that included both Brook Lopez and Mason Plumlee. With both Marcus Smart (left quad strain) and Jayson Tatum (left ankle sprain) out, the U.S. played two of its three centers together for the first time in its eight games (including exhibitions). The zone offense improved as the game went on, and it was clear that the Americans wanted to be sharper with their ball and player movement against the 2-3, which they weren\u2019t totally prepared for two nights earlier. \u201cObviously, it caught us by surprise a little bit against Turkey,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cBut we came in ready for it today.\u201d \u201cWe were trying some different stuff,\u201d Harris added, \u201csort of basic 1-3-1 sets, where we overload the zone. I think we just did a better job of kind of denting the zone, so we got into the paint, whether it was penetration, ball movement. We played with better pace. The ball was moving. I think against Turkey, we got a little stagnant, because it threw us off a little bit when they stretched out the zone.\u201d The zone offense, like everything with this team, continues to be a work in progress. Next stop, Shenzhen, where the Kia MVP will be ready with his own sense of urgency. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

While we closely track the U.S. Men\u2019s National Team, here\u2019s a quick look at all the action from FIBA World Cup play on Sept. 5. * * * San Antonio Spurs guard Patty Mills drilled a clutch 3-pointer with 32.9 seconds left over the outstretched arm of Memphis Grizzlies center Jonas Valanciunas to keep Australia undefeated in FIBA World Cup play. Mills\u2019 shot pushed Australia\u2019s lead to 83-78 in an eventual 87-82 victory that closed out first round play for both teams. Australia and Lithuania are both moving on to the Second Round, but Australia finished undefeated while Lithuania went 2-1. In Saturday\u2019s Second Round play, Lithuania will play France while Australia will take on the Dominican Republic. Both Lithuania and Australia boast a bevy of NBA players and several of them came through with standout performances in one of Thursday\u2019s best games. For the victorious Australians, Mills led the way with 23 points (on 8-for-16 shooting) and was boosted in the frontcourt by the play of big man Aron Baynes of the Phoenix Suns. Baynes finished with 21 points, nailed a trio of 3-pointers and had 13 rebounds. Starting point guard Matthew Dellavedova of the Cleveland Cavaliers was also solid (10 points, five assists).  Indiana Pacers big man Domantas Sabonis was one of Lithuania\u2019s top performers with 12 points, three rebounds and four assists while Valanciunas finished with seven points and seven rebounds. Reigning Kia MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo showed up in a big way in a game Greece needed to win to advance to Second Round play at the FIBA World Cup. In his best game to date in FIBA World Cup play, Antetokounmpo finished with 24 points, 10 rebounds, six assists and two steals to power Greece\u2019s 103-97 win against New Zealand that assured it of Second Round game against the United States on Saturday. After some quiet scoring performances to open FIBA play, Antetokounmpo was dominant all game long and had a clutch and-one sequence in the fourth quarter to help push Greece to its victory. Antetokounmpo\u2019s brother and new teammate on the Milwaukee Bucks, Thanasis Antetokounmpo, delivered 10 points and three rebounds. Former Memphis Grizzlies guard Nick Calathes operated the offense well, finishing with 14 points, four rebounds and five assists. Up next for Greece is Team USA, whom it will face on Saturday. New Zealand finished 1-2 in first round play and will not advance to the Second Round. Corey Webster was the top performer for New Zealand, finishing with 28 points (on 10-for-16 shooting) and four assists in the defeat. A red-hot Cristiano Felicio was too much for Montenegro to handle on Thursday. The Chicago Bulls big man was sizzling all game long, dropping in 14 points on perfect 7-for-7 shooting performances from the field and free throw line. He also added eight rebounds and two assists as Brazil stayed perfect in FIBA World Cup play, improving to 3-0. Brazil will face the Czech Republic on Saturday in Second Round play Former Los Angeles Lakers guard Marcelo Huertas was equally solid on Thursday, dropping in 16 points on 7-for-10 shooting along with six assists. Former NBA standouts Leandro Barbosa (eight points, four assists) and Anderson Varejao (nine points, four rebounds) were instrumental in Brazil holding a 43-31 edge in bench scoring vs. Montenegro. Orlando Magic big man Nikola Vucevic had a quiet game for Montenegro, scoring eight points and collecting six rebounds in 13 minutes of play. Derek Needham paced Montenegro with 16 points and 10 rebounds. The United States Men\u2019s National Team completed first round play at the FIBA World Cup with an easy, 98-45 win over Japan on Thursday. After surviving a major scare against Turkey two nights earlier, the U.S. (now 3-0) took care of business early against the winless Japanese. The Americans started the game with a 13-0 run by holding Japan scoreless on its first eight possessions. The U.S. led by 33 at the half and by as many as 62 late in the fourth quarter. Jaylen Brown led five Americans in double-figures with 20 points, featuring two highlight, fast-break dunks. Team USA now moves on to Shenzhen, where it will play 2-1 Greece (with NBA MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo) on Saturday and 3-0 Brazil on Monday in the second round. Behind a strong inside game and a solid fourth quarter, the Czech Republic is moving on to the Second Round at the FIBA World Cup for the first time ever. Forward Vojtech Hruban (18 points, four rebounds, four assists) and center Ondrej Balvin (17 points, 11 rebounds) set the tone for Czech Republic as they shot a combined 16-for-21 overall and 14-for-16 at the line to help seal the victory. Overall, Turkey was outscored 48-20 in the paint and while the game was close throughout, the Czech Republic pulled away in the fourth quarter by outscoring Turkey 25-16. Chicago Bulls guard Tomas Satoransky was solid at the controls for the Czech Republic, finishing with 11 points, seven rebounds and seven assists. The Czech Republic (2-1) joins USA from Group E in advancing to Second Round, where the Czech Republic will face undefeated Brazil (3-0) next. Cleveland Cavaliers forward Cedi Osman led Turkey with 24 points (on 8-for-14 shooting). Milwaukee Bucks big man Ersan Ilyasova had a particularly difficult game, finishing with just six points while going 0-for-9 from the field. Philadelphia 76ers swingman Furkan Korkmaz was solid off the bench for Turkey, finishing with 16 points, four rebounds and three steals. In another matchup of undefeated teams from the same FIBA World Cup group, it was France who remained undefeated with a robust drubbing of the Dominican Republic on Thursday. Both teams were 2-0 in Group G play, but France used a balanced attack of solid games from its NBA contingent to put away the Dominican Republic, 90-56. Rudy Gobert of the Utah Jazz finished with 13 points, eight rebounds and a block to pace a solid all-around effort for France. Evan Fournier of the Orlando Magic finished with 10 points and five assists. Former San Antonio Spurs guard Nando De Colo added 15 points off the bench while New York Knicks guard Frank Ntilikina finished with eight points and four assists in a starting role. On Saturday, France will take on Lithuania in Second Round play while the Dominican Republic will play against Australia as well. Victor Liz was the top performer for the Dominican Republic with 12 points. After faltering in its first two FIBA World Cup games, Canada finally got a win to stay alive for a spot in the FIBA Olympic Qualifying Tournament. Sacramento Kings guard Cory Joseph led the way for Canada with 24 points on 9-for-17 shooting and three assists. Maurice Ndour, who played 32 games for the New York Knicks in 2016-17, had one of the better performances for Senegal with nine points and 12 rebounds. Mouhammad Faye paced Senegal with 14 points, while Lamine Sambe chipped in with 10 points. The win marked Canada\u2019s first at the FIBA World Cup since 2002. However, even with the victory, Canada (1-3) can no longer qualify for the Second Round of the FIBA World Cup after an 0-2 start. Sengal (0-3) is also out of consideration for Second Round play, too. Oklahoma City Thunder guard Dennis Schroder came through with a strong performance to lift Germany to its lone win in the first round of FIBA World Cup play. Schroder finished with 10 points and 11 assists as Germany (1-2) kept Jordan winless in a game that was never in doubt.  After building a 28-17 lead in the first quarter, Germany outscored Jordan each quarter thereafter, including a 30-13 performance in the fourth quarter. Aside from Schroder, former Chicago Bulls guard Paul Zipser was solid in the win (12 points, three rebounds) and Dallas Mavericks big man Maxi Kleber dominated with 18 points on 7-for-11 shooting. (Zipser and Kleber also connected on a pretty sweet alley-oop in the win, too.) Ahmad Al Dwairi led Jordan with 17 points and eight rebounds. * * * > Day 7 schedule"},{"id":31996,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/fiba-world-cup-team-usa-defeats-japan-recap-highlights","date":"2019-09-05","title":"Team USA blows out Japan to stay perfect in FIBA World Cup play","content":"SHANGHAI \u2014 The United States Men\u2019s National Team completed first round play at the FIBA World Cup with an easy, 98-45 win over Japan on Thursday.

The veteran center hopes the Lakers fans \u2014 and a couple of retired Lakers superstars \u2014 who learned to loathe the old Dwight over the past six years will give him another chance. Howard called it \u201ca very big blessing\u201d Wednesday to re-sign with the Lakers, who chose him as the improbable replacement for injured center DeMarcus Cousins . The 33-year-old Howard spent the eventful 2012-13 season with the Lakers before abruptly leaving as a free agent. After six up-and-down seasons away from LA and a self-described difficult offseason in his personal life, Howard is energized by the chance to team up with LeBron James and Anthony Davis in a familiar jersey. \u201cNot too often in life do you get second chances,\u201d Howard said on a conference call in his first public comments about the reunion. \u201cThis is an awesome experience. I\u2019m just looking forward to being the best teammate, the best person in the community I can be. \u2026 Six years ago doesn\u2019t seem like a long time, but a lot of things have happened. I\u2019m just excited.\u201d Howard realizes that some Lakers fans may be less excited: He has been booed every time he stepped foot in Staples Center over the past six years \u2014 even by Clippers fans. He hopes everyone will recognize he\u2019s ready to repair his relationship with Los Angeles. \u201cI never had any ill will toward the fans in LA,\u201d Howard said. \u201cI loved this city from the moment I started playing here. \u2026 It was just a decision I made. I love this city. I loved playing in LA. None of that stuff even matters to me anymore. I think we all have a fresh start. I\u2019m big on new beginnings, and this is the time to start up a new time. I\u2019m just looking forward to having a fresh start with the fans and show them my only dedication is to put another banner up here in Los Angeles.\u201d Howard also said he is eager to go back to work after a rough 12 months in his personal life. He hasn\u2019t played a game since November after getting injured early in his only season with Washington, and he didn\u2019t go into detail about off-court problems he has previously described as \u201crock bottom.\u201d \u201cIt was just stuff in my personal life,\u201d Howard said. \u201cMentally, physically and spiritually. It had nothing to do with me as a basketball player or anything like that. It was just personal things that I had to deal with which made me stronger.\u201d Howard said he has repaired his mental state through meditation, reading and introspection. That might be why he didn\u2019t seem to be bothered by the criticism he received online last week from Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O\u2019Neal. The Lakers greats had a brief disagreement on social media before they united in publicly making fun of Howard , who clashed with the businesslike Bryant during their season together in LA. \u201cShaq and Kobe are some of the greatest players ever to play this game,\u201d Howard said. \u201cI have nothing but love and respect for those guys and what they\u2019ve been able to accomplish. \u2026 My job is to come here and help this team win. It\u2019s not to get into any fights or arguments with Shaq or Kobe or anybody. I won\u2019t let anything distract me from winning a championship.\u201d Howard wasn\u2019t the Lakers\u2019 first choice to play alongside JaVale McGee and Davis at center, but he won over both big men and team leader Rajon Rondo while trying out for the Lakers\u2019 top brass last month. Howard said he vowed to be a supportive teammate dedicated to team goals, but he realizes public declarations are cheap. \u201cI\u2019d rather show you guys than say it,\u201d Howard said. \u201cI\u2019d rather my actions be something that you guys can critique instead of my words. I\u2019ve always said a lot of words, but I\u2019d just rather show you guys.\u201d"},{"id":31999,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/rockets-eric-gordon-four-year-extension","date":"2019-09-04","title":"Rockets, Eric Gordon agree to four-year extension","content":" The Houston Rockets and shooting guard Eric Gordon have agreed to a multi-year contract extension, the team announced on Wednesday. Houston Chronicle \u2018s Jonathan Feigen first reported the agreement on Saturday, stating it\u2019s a four-year, $75.6 million max extension. The final year of the deal is non-guaranteed, per ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski , who added that it becomes guaranteed if Gordon makes an All-Star team or the Rockets win a championship. If neither happens, it\u2019s listed as a three-year, $54.5 million extension, reports Wojnarowski. Gordon, who arrived in Houston back in 2016, is entering the final season of his four-year, $53 million deal, per Spotrac . He seemingly alluded to the reported deal on social media Saturday afternoon, tweeting out \u201cSigned, sealed, delivered\u201d with multiple rocketship emoji. The 2016-17 Kia Sixth Man of the Year moved into the starting lineup last season, starting 53 of the 68 games he played in. He averaged 16.2 points on 40.9 shooting from the field and 36.0 shooting from long range. Despite the addition of Russell Westbrook, Gordon\u2019s lucrative contract suggests that his role won\u2019t be reduced much. The 30-year-old guard was often on the floor alongside James Harden and Chris Paul and has played at least 31 minutes a game throughout his lone three seasons in Houston."},{"id":31974,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/milwaukee-sterling-brown-settlement-offer","date":"2019-09-04","title":"Milwaukee city officials offer Sterling Brown $400K to settle police suit","content":" MILWAUKEE (AP) \u2014 Milwaukee city officials are offering Bucks guard Sterling Brown $400,000 to settle his lawsuit accusing police of using excessive force and targeting him because he\u2019s black when they confronted him over a parking violation.

This team does not have the superstar bucket-getters of past USA squads. As we saw in the Americans\u2019 overtime escape against Turkey on Tuesday, the margin for error is thin. And to keep winning against tougher competition, the players will need to help each other when it comes to identifying the opposing defense or who\u2019s defending whom on a pick and roll. Just like they do when it comes to identifying the Czech Republic on an unlabeled map of Europe. That has been one of the challenges that U.S. head coach Gregg Popovich has given his players along the journey to the World Cup knockout rounds. At the beginning of some of the team\u2019s meetings, Popovich has selected a player to answer a non-basketball question, a \u201cPop Quiz\u201d if you will. This group of Americans is probably more learned in pick-and-roll coverage than world geography. Fortunately, players, in the face of trying to distinguish the Czech Republic from Slovakia, are allowed to use a lifeline, like on \u201cWho Wants to Be a Millionaire?,\u201d with Popovich in the role of Regis Philbin. Need help? Your teammate is there for you. \u201cBeing willing to ask for help, willing to go to your teammate,\u201d Donovan Mitchell told NBA.com, \u201cthat\u2019s what, really, a lot of this is all about.\u201d It\u2019s not all geography. Stanford alum Brook Lopez aced a Pop Quiz by recalling the periodic symbol for silver (Ag). The key was a mnemonic device that Lopez had memorized years back. \u201cAhh gee, it\u2019s only silver,\u201d he said. \u201cAy you, give me that gold. \u201cI\u2019m amazed at the things I do remember and the things I don\u2019t remember from high school chemistry and high school world cultures.\u201d Harrison Barnes, former AP student , was cited as being the best Pop Quiz contestant. \u201cDerrick White\u2019s eliminated automatically,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cbecause he\u2019s used to it [playing for Popovich\u2019s San Antonio Spurs]. I would say the best has been Harrison Barnes. We haven\u2019t had too many guys go up yet. But we\u2019ve all chipped in.\u201d \u201cI think the only person who got one right was Harrison,\u201d Jayson Tatum added. \u201cEverybody else had to ask a friend.\u201d One player needed to call on Mitchell\u2019s help to identify China \u2014 the third largest country in the world and the one the players are spending almost three weeks in \u2014 on the map. Mitchell wouldn\u2019t divulge the identity of the teammate who called that lifeline, but said that it was only for confirmation. \u201cThey just didn\u2019t want to be wrong,\u201d he noted. \u201cThey wanted to be sure.\u201d The reward for getting a question right? Popovich transforms from Regis Philbin to Oprah Winfrey. \u201cPop\u2019s handing out cars,\u201d Lopez laughed. \u201cHe\u2019s giving people cars for getting right answers.\u201d Matchbox cars, sadly. The real rewards are intangible. \u201cIt builds camaraderie,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cIt\u2019s good to know that stuff, too.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of other stuff going on besides basketball,\u201d USA assistant coach Steve Kerr added. \u201cWhen you\u2019re playing in the World Cup, it takes on a different meaning, playing against teams from all over the world. It\u2019s good for these guys, for all of us, to learn more about the world and learn more about the teams we\u2019re playing. It keeps guys on their toes, but I think they enjoy it too.\u201d Pop Quizzes get the team engaged before the basketball work begins. There\u2019s no wiping the sleep out of your eyes upon entering the room. \u201cHe definitely challenges you mentally,\u201d Barnes said of Popovich. \u201cEvery day, he\u2019s got something different. He\u2019s got a history lesson with a quote from some general during the Civil War. Then he\u2019s got geography. He has a different way of trying to see where you are mentally.\u201d These players are only under Popovich\u2019s watch for six weeks. But even with a condensed timeline between the first day of training camp and a (likely) quarterfinal where the U.S. is facing elimination against a tough opponent, there\u2019s a need to mix things up a little. \u201cYou think back to who your favorite teachers were in your high school days,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cIt\u2019s always the ones that shook things up and made them more interesting, did things that you weren\u2019t expecting, rather than just droned on about the same thing every day. Pop\u2019s just a creative teacher, and I think guys really enjoy that dynamic.\u201d The U.S. players were not discouraged about needing Turkey to miss four straight free throws to win their first-round game on Tuesday. Similarly, Lopez takes a positive view towards the team\u2019s performance in the classroom. \u201cI think we\u2019ve fared pretty well,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve missed one or two countries as a team. But our team\u2019s general trivia, capitals, chemistry, and country knowledge is pretty formidable, I think.\u201d \u201cSince the first day that we did it,\u201d Kerr remarked, \u201cI think guys have been preparing a little bit better.\u201d Alas, there is no trivia competition at the World Cup. These guys will only be going head-to-head with other nations on the basketball court. But maybe the bonds built in the face of Pop Quizzes will pay off when the single-elimination rounds begin next week. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

Tatum will be reevaluated on Monday, Sept. 9, the day that the U.S. plays its second of two second-round games. After the Turkey win, Tatum lamented that going 2-for-3 at the line to tie (but not win) the game at the end of regulation eventually led to his injury. \u201cI\u2019m still pissed I missed the second one,\u201d he said before limping out of the arena. \u201cThen I wouldn\u2019t have got hurt.\u201d Here\u2019s how the U.S. schedule looks going forward\u2026 On Thursday, the U.S. will play its final, Group E, first round game against Japan in Shanghai. The Americans have already qualified for the second round, but the result of this game still counts in regard to qualifying for the quarterfinals out of the second round (where Groups E and F become Group K). The U.S. will play two second-round games (in Group K) against the top two teams from Group F on Saturday (Sept. 7) and Monday (Sept. 9) in Shenzhen. With its win over Greece on Tuesday, Brazil has already qualified for Group K. The second team from Group F will be the winner of Thursday\u2019s game between Greece and New Zealand. Joining from Group E with the U.S. will be the winner of Thursday\u2019s game between the Czech Republic and Turkey. The top two teams from Group K (combining results from the first and second rounds) will make the quarterfinals, playing next Wednesday (Sept. 11). The two Group K teams will be placed on opposite sides of the bracket, but they\u2019ll both face teams from Group L, which is already set in stone: Australia, the Dominican Republic, France and Lithuania. That is a very strong group, and one of Australia, France and Lithuania won\u2019t even qualify for the quarters. It\u2019s possible that the Americans would face a tougher opponent in the quarterfinals than they would in the semifinals. Serbia (silver at both the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympics) remains the favorite among teams outside the United States. If both Serbia (already qualified for second-round Group J) and the U.S. finish first in their second round groups, they would be placed on opposite sides of the bracket. If one finishes first in its group and the other finishes second in its group, they would be on the same side, with a potential meeting in the semifinals. The U.S. (playing every other day if they keep advancing) will hope to have Tatum back before then. He has shot just 7-for-22 (32 percent) in two games at the World Cup, but has been one of the team\u2019s best generators of offense off the dribble, and he came up with a pair of big plays down the stretch of Tuesday\u2019s victory. One of Joe Harris or Khris Middleton will likely start in Tatum\u2019s place on Thursday. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

The U.S. needed its opponent to miss four straight free throws with less than 10 seconds left in overtime to have a chance for the win with Khris Middleton\u2019s freebies with 2.1 on the clock. The team that escaped with the win did not look like a team that can win the gold medal in Beijing in less than two weeks. Heck, it didn\u2019t look like a team that will get out of a quarterfinal matchup with Australia, France or Lithuania. Turkey is a good team, a physical squad that executed well against the U.S. defense. But it\u2019s probably not as good as those three teams that the U.S. could face one week from Wednesday. And after just two games, we know that if the Americans reach the quarters, their opponent will be one of those three (unless the Dominican Republic somehow makes it out of the second round against that group). At least one of those three teams won\u2019t even reach the quarterfinals. But if there was any thoughts of the U.S. being in trouble going forward, it wasn\u2019t coming from the players. To them, they got a tough win against a tough opponent. Kemba Walker was asked if he came out of the game, obviously a less-than-stellar team performance, discouraged. \u201cDiscouraged? No,\u201d he replied. \u201cFar from discouraged. We won. No matter how it comes, no matter what. Much respect to Turkey. Those guys played great. It was a battle the whole game. But for us to come out with a win like that, that was incredible. I\u2019m not discouraged at all.\u201d Donovan Mitchell, meanwhile, believes that getting a win in a tough situation like that was a sign of a team that\u2019s mentally strong. \u201cI don\u2019t think we get through a win like this without being as connected and close as we are,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cWe\u2019ve done a great job of that and have only been together for a month or so. I\u2019m so proud of everybody on the team, man. I know it\u2019s one game. I know we got a lot more to go, but this really builds character and it shows what type of group that we have. Guys were really locked in. Jayson [Tatum] and Kemba and Khris, those three at the end, they really stepped up big.\u201d Tatum had similar thoughts. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to win every game by 30 or 40,\u201d he said. \u201cTurkey\u2019s a great team and they\u2019ve been playing together for a while. This was good for us. It was a tough game, tough battle. A lot of guys gave second, third and fourth efforts, and we learned a lot about ourselves tonight, especially in a tough environment like this. This was a big win. We\u2019ve got a lot to improve on.\u201d Indeed, the Americans made a plethora of big plays \u2026 Of course, the U.S. wouldn\u2019t have been in those situations if there weren\u2019t some issues.  Walker\u2019s thought\u2019s on his team\u2019s zone offense? \u201cOh, we gotta work on that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe gotta work on that.\u201d The U.S. led the game by 15 points (41-26) midway through the second quarter. Up to that point, Turkey was mostly playing man-to-man defense. And after that point, Turkey mostly played a 2-3 zone, with some zone pressure (both 2-2-1 and 1-3-1) to take some time off the clock. Simply put, the U.S. was not very good against the zone. After scoring 41 points (1.37 points per possession) on their first 30 possessions of the game, the Americans scored just 40 points (0.87 per) on their last 46 possessions of regulation. This wasn\u2019t even the toughest Turkey zone that the United States has seen over the years. In the 2010 World Championship gold medal game, Turkey had a zone that sometimes featured five guys 6-foot-8 or taller (with Hedo Turkoglu playing point guard). But this zone still extended out to the 3-point line with size on the wings. The Americans often seemed indecisive against the zone. There was some (ball and player) movement, but not enough. There was some attacking with the dribble, but not enough. There was too much holding onto the ball. \u201cWe definitely need to shore some stuff up,\u201d Harris said. \u201cI think our execution in the halfcourt wasn\u2019t great. We weren\u2019t running stuff to score against the zone. We kind of let them match up against us and take us out of our rhythm a little bit vs. running stuff hard regardless of being zone or man.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s about being poised,\u201d Mitchell added. \u201cA lot of it just took us by surprise. We have a zone offense. We have a really good one. I think for us just being able to understand that we just got to execute better. That\u2019s all it is.\u201d The good news is that they had this experience in Game 2 and now know what it feels like to play against a sizable zone defense. They could certainly work on it in practice (they haven\u2019t had an off-day practice since Friday and won\u2019t be practicing on Wednesday), but practice isn\u2019t necessarily a meaningful simulation. \u201cYou can\u2019t replicate the environment we were just in,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cYou got to go through it and experience it. We did and we\u2019ll watch film and get better at it. Obviously, it\u2019s not going to be perfect, but we can continue to build and get better.\u201d As noted above, Harris made some big plays with his effort, but he\u2019s got to be the guy that gets some open looks against the zone. And that just didn\u2019t happen enough on Tuesday. He did drain a 3 on the Americans\u2019 first possession of overtime, but that was a bit of a broken play, with Turkey getting caught out of position after Tatum had the ball knocked out of his hands on a drive. The only other catch-and-shoot 3-pointer that the U.S. made in the final 18 minutes (Mitchell in the left corner off a feed from Walker to put the U.S. up three with three minutes left in regulation) was in transition. \u201cWe\u2019re going to watch some film,\u201d Walker said about improving against the zone. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get better. There\u2019s so much room for improvement for us, and I\u2019m glad we were able to be a part of that game. And I\u2019m glad we were able to win.\u201d This was a physical game. Just how physical? Afterward, Mitchell got a text from former Utah Jazz teammate Ricky Rubio (who\u2019s playing for Spain in Group C). It read, \u201cWelcome to FIBA.\u201d And it was physical on both ends of the floor. On offense, the U.S. was met with multiple bodies (and arms) when it attacked the paint. On defense, the U.S. guards were flattened by several ball screens from the Turkish bigs. The U.S. attempted nine more free throws than Turkey (32-23), though the Americans were whistled for one more foul (27-26). \u201cWe have to learn how the game is officiated,\u201d Harrison Barnes said. \u201cThere are some plays that we\u2019re kind of used to how the NBA officiates things. So we get the no-call, but at the other end, it just looks like we\u2019re fouling every single time, whether it\u2019s post defense, whether it\u2019s coming off screens, whether it\u2019s just bumping a guy as they\u2019re driving. So there\u2019s a learning curve that I think we\u2019re getting better at, but tonight it was definitely evident.\u201d In regard to Turkey\u2019s screen-setting, Mitchell said that they have to find ways to avoid getting taken out of the play. \u201cI think we could have done a much better job on ball on defense,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we played the Czech Republic, we were into their guards a little bit more. As guys started to get tired, we started to lay back and give them shots that we really weren\u2019t letting them get at the beginning of the game. \u201cI think it\u2019s really on us as well, being able to take up space, that way we don\u2019t get hit on screens. I\u2019m getting hit, Kemba\u2019s getting hit, guys are getting hit that we normally don\u2019t. That just comes with knowing each other and games like this help you grow in that sense.\u201d Tatum turned his left ankle in the paint after dishing off to Middleton for what turned out to be the game-winning free throws. He was helped off the floor and was still limping as he left the arena after talking to reporters. But he said he felt \u201cbetter than when it first happened.\u201d Time will tell just how bad the injury is, of course. No matter what, it would seemingly be prudent for Tatum to sit out the Americans\u2019 game against Japan, the weakest team in Group E, on Thursday. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

Namely, fail. Flop. Mess up. Over 11 NBA seasons, 10 most successfully with the Milwaukee Bucks, Moncrief channeled his fear of failure and glass-half-empty outlook into five All-Star games, 10 selections to all-NBA or all-defensive teams, 11 playoff appearances and now membership in the Class of 2019 for the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. People attending or watching the ceremony figure to see Moncrief smile in one night more than he did on the court across his entire career. As a 6-foot-4, 180-pound shooting guard, Moncrief\u2019s all-around approach had him routinely slotted in from about 1980 through 1986 close behind Magic Johnson and Larry Bird among the league\u2019s best players. So lean you could see veins in his temples pulse as he worked, eyes focused like lasers, Moncrief worked relentlessly on both ends of the floor. He attacked the basket on drives and with post-up moves, developed an outside shot on the fly, perpetually moved both himself and the ball, and dared to crash the boards when dinosaurs still ruled the NBA paint. Defensively, Moncrief was even more tenacious . Coltish to the point of looking spindly, he ran run on his toes to catch and pester the men he guarded, knifing and wincing his way through screens if Milwaukee\u2019s innovative coach Don Nelson wasn\u2019t flexing an early version of today\u2019s switch-everything defense. Throughout, the new Hall of Famer stayed serious. As serious as he was working down his chores list each day before his mother, a hotel maid, got home from work. As serious as when he\u2019d hit the open gym at Parkview High in Little Rock, Ark., and follow a workout routine he\u2019d written down while other kids were just worried about \u201cNext!\u201d As serious as when Moncrief showed up to Bucks training camp for the first time and pushed back immediately against a time-honored NBA tradition. \u201cI was holding out so I wasn\u2019t there at the start,\u201d former teammate Marques Johnson said. \u201cBut once I got there, Junior Bridgeman, Quinn Buckner started telling me just how different of a cat he was. One thing they pointed to, they tried to do the rookie hazing thing to get him to carry the basketballs, and Sid refused to do it. His explanation was, he wasn\u2019t a rookie because he\u2019d been playing all his life. So they cut him some slack.\u201d Said Bridgeman, NBA swingman turned restaurant mogul: \u201cSidney considered himself a player, and the NBA \u2013 even though it was better competition \u2013 still was just basketball. I think that made him the kind of player he became. Mentally, if you feel like \u2018this all isn\u2019t new and it\u2019s just a game,\u2019 then you don\u2019t have the nervousness and the rookie jitters.\u201d Affable and modest off the court, Moncrief was and remains analytical about his playing days and the job that got him, finally, to Springfield. At no point, then or now, was it a joke. \u201cMaximum effort,\u201d he said of his best attributes. \u201cA commitment to being a professional, the way you performed, the way you carried out the game plan, the way you interacted with your teammates. When I watch tape of myself now, what really strikes me is how explosive I was and how many different ways I could score the basketball and play defense. Not being one-dimensional was important to me.\u201d Folks noticed. Only five guards (none since 1996) have been named NBA Defensive Player of the Year: Gary Payton (1996), Michael Jordan (1988), Michael Cooper (1987), Alvin Robertson (1986) and Moncrief. Only the Bucks start won it twice, in 1983 and 1984. Those were the first two times it was presented, as if Moncrief\u2019s game demanded the DPOY\u2019s invention. \u201cPeople forget with Nellie \u2013 and Sidney was the key to it \u2013 we were the best defensive team in the league,\u201d said Garry St. Jean, a Bucks assistant in the \u201880s. \u201cWe were one of the first teams to switch. Remember the double-teams we used? Nellie was ahead of his time defensively. He always studied the rules, and then he\u2019d find a way to break \u2018em. Moncrief was the cornerstone to all that.\u201d St. Jean, now a broadcast analyst of Golden State games, remarked in a Sports Illustrated article 34 years ago that an easy way to earn quick cash was to bet on Moncrief\u2019s squads in Milwaukee\u2019s daily scrimmages. \u201cHe never allowed you to have a bad practice,\u201d St. Jean said last week. \u201cHow many guys can you say that about? He was always, always prepared. He was in great physical shape. His mental state of mind. His toughness. His defensive acumen on and off the ball. \u201cHe had the respect of every player on the team. But he also had the opponents\u2019 respect, the other coaches, everybody. He wasn\u2019t a flamboyant player, but everybody from Billy Cunningham to [Maurice] Cheeks to Dennis Johnson and Danny Ainge and all those guys, thought he was amazing.\u201d Said Nelson by phone from his retirement retreat in Maui: \u201cYou just didn\u2019t want him off the floor because he played both ends all the time. He couldn\u2019t do it physically, of course, but you wanted him out there 48 minutes every night.\u201d Two years after Johnson\u2019s first holdout made him a late witness to Moncrief\u2019s game, his second in the fall of 1981 opened his eyes even wider. \u201cWhen you\u2019re holding out, you don\u2019t want your guys to fall on their faces, but you want them to kind of struggle to be around .500 while you\u2019re gone. Y\u2019know, show they miss you a little bit,\u201d said Johnson, a 2019 Naismith Hall finalist. \u201cBut the Bucks started out 7-2 that year. They weren\u2019t helping my leverage one bit, and Sidney Moncrief was the main culprit, having a fantastic start. I think they were 12-6 by the time I came back from that holdout. I was just glad to get back in the fold. Had Moncrief never played a minute in the NBA, he still had achieved hoops immortality for the photograph that graced Sports Illustrated \u2019s Feb. 13, 1978 edition . In the midst of Arkansas\u2019 32-4 season that would reach that spring\u2019s Final Four, Moncrief was captured soaring to the rim, the basketball cocked behind his head for a killer dunk, with a hammer headline of \u201cHigh on the Hogs,\u201d in reference to the Razorbacks\u2019 unofficial nickname. It is regarded as one of the sports weekly\u2019s most memorable covers, with a look on Moncrief\u2019s face of sheer \u2026 ferocity? Nope, try ouch!  \u201cWhen I took off to dunk that ball, I had started having my [left] knee issues,\u201d Moncrief said more than 41 years later. \u201cI remember my knee giving out a little bit when I planted. So if someone looks at the cover, they see my grimace and might think it\u2019s intensity. It\u2019s more pain.\u201d The toughness to play through that, to gut out 11 seasons after doctors predicted he\u2019d break down in seven or less, came early. Moncrief grew up as the second youngest of seven siblings, a brood spread across about 15 years. His father traveled, his mother worked cleaning houses, then hotel rooms, before assisting in class rooms by the time Sid reached high school. His parents divorced when he was in sixth grade \u2013 later, his stepfather worked fixing leaks for the gas company. Everybody, in their time, had chores. \u201cWe just didn\u2019t have people lying around doing nothing. Summertime, whatever, it didn\u2019t matter. You had to be busy,\u201d Moncrief said. That meant mopping floor, sewing his own clothes and ironing in junior high. He and the others tended to a family garden about 20 minutes from home around school and basketball practice. \u201cMostly vegetables,\u201d he said. \u201cAll the things I didn\u2019t want to eat, we grew.\u201d The discipline of that served the children well \u2013 Moncrief is proud of the adults his siblings are \u2013 and taught him what commitment is. The family at one point had moved into public housing in East Little Rock, by age which is where an overdue asphalt court caught Moncrief\u2019s eye at age 11 or so. Till then, he\u2019d been playing football.  \u201cThe rims had the chain \u2018nets.\u2019 That\u2019s when I started being interested in basketball,\u201d he said. \u201cI still hear the sound when people would make shots. \u201cBy seventh grade, we moved again and a neighbor had a goal \u2013 the worst goal you\u2019d ever want to see. \u2026 In eighth grade, I was just OK. But I was a starter and all-city on the ninth-grade team. That\u2019s when I started really developing as a player. I didn\u2019t know that\u2019s what I was doing, but I\u2019d be out there thinking, \u2018You need to make more layups,\u2019 so that\u2019s what I\u2019d do. I\u2019d dribble the ball more, all sorts of things like that, and I got better.\u201d Charles Ripley, the coach at Parkview, kept their gym open late, so Moncrief would travel there when his own school\u2019s, Hall High, was closed. He already had developed an impatience with wasting time, so kept his workouts and scrimmaging on tight schedules. He blossomed as a player at Hall under coach Oliver Elders, and learned more about character too. One morning in the cafeteria, Moncrief made the mistake of not calling him \u201cCoach Elders.\u201d \u201cI called him \u2018O.E.\u2019 I was a sophomore,\u201d Moncrief later recalled. \u201cHe looked at me and said, \u2018Son, you won\u2019t ever play for me being this disrespectful.\u2019\u201d Elders and Moncrief thrived together, nowhere more so than in the classroom when Moncrief hiked his GPA from slightly above 2.0 to a 3.8 as a senior to nail down his scholarship to Arkansas. That\u2019s where he learned defense and detail from coach Eddie Sutton, and where he teamed with Ron Brewer and Marvin Delph to form the Razorbacks\u2019 entertaining and lethal \u201cTriplets,\u201d as NCAA broadcaster Al McGuire dubbed them. Moncrief was named third team all-American as a junior, first team as a senior, and made 60 percent of his field goal attempts over four college seasons. Sutton spent 75 percent of Arkansas practice time drilling defense, which served his top NBA prospect \u2013 Moncrief is the first Razorbacks player inducted into the Hall of Fame and still ranks as the highest drafted \u2013 well as a pro. Even concerns about his left knee couldn\u2019t scuttle enthusiasm for Moncrief among the league\u2019s scouts. No, that was left to Nelson. The 1979 Draft was all about Magic Johnson, with no clear order for those who would be chosen after him. The Detroit Pistons were desperate to move up to snag Michigan State\u2019s second star, Greg Kelser \u2013 the Spartans had just beaten Larry Bird\u2019s Indiana State team for the NCAA title \u2013 and approached Milwaukee about a deal. \u201cThey gave me a million dollars to move,\u201d Nelson said, chuckling anew about the maneuver. \u201cWe had lost exactly $1 million with the team that year. So with one little move, I could put us in the black. [Note: Several reliable league sources recall the Pistons paying $50,000 rather than $1 million to flip picks, still a considerable sum in 1979.] \u201cTo do the deal, they had to tell me who they were going to take. I figured I could get Sid after that.\u201d Much has been made about Chicago losing the coin flip that year with the Lakers, which cost the Bulls Johnson but helped keep them scroungy enough to get Michael Jordan five years later. In an alternate 1979 reality, though, the Bulls could have opted for Moncrief at No. 2 instead of UCLA forward David Greenwood \u2013 and probably improved enough to miss out on Jordan that way, too. Brian Winters was a bearded, sharpshooting off guard, born and raised in New York, schooled in South Carolina and heading into his sixth NBA season. He\u2019d been an All-Star twice in his first four years with the Bucks. So it wasn\u2019t as if Milwaukee was drafting for need in 1979. \u201cBefore the Draft, Nellie called me and said, \u2018Y\u2019know, Brian, we\u2019re going to draft a guard. He plays your position.\u2019\u201d said Winters, 67, who scouts for the Indiana Pacers. \u201cAll I said to Nellie was, \u2018Is he good? Then draft him. Because I want to play with good players.\u2019 \u201cFairly quiet personality, not overt in his manner, but he fit right in. No problem with me. I felt we got along great. We played well together, competed against each other in practice every day. Never had a problem with it.\u201d Nelson knew where it was headed, but used Moncrief off the bench in 1979-80, even as the Bucks\u2019 victory total jumped from 38 to 49. It was their first of seven straight division titles and 10 consecutive playoff appearances during Moncrief\u2019s time in Milwaukee. \u201cYour teammates make you,\u201d said Moncrief, who will turn 62 in a few weeks. \u201cAnd not just on the court. Junior Bridgeman and Harvey Catchings were my mentors when I came in. They used to show me how to dress, how to work out, how you should approach the game, how to be a professional. They kept me safe on the road. \u201cThose early years in the NBA, if you don\u2019t have a stable person you can be around, it can get a little rocky. I had that with Milwaukee, guys who could keep me focused.\u201d From 1980 to 1984, Moncrief and Marques Johnson were as potent and talented a tandem of shooting guard and small forward as the NBA had. That changed when Nelson traded Johnson, Bridgeman and Catchings to the Clippers in September 1984, replenishing his roster with Terry Cummings, Ricky Pierce and Craig Hodges. \u201cIt broke my heart,\u201d Moncrief says. But success on the court continued, and these days they all choose to remember the good times. \u201cSidney was the first guy I played with who was an ardent, consistent weight lifter,\u201d said Johnson, now a Bucks TV analyst. \u201cHe convinced the Bucks to put a bench press into one of these little musty side rooms in the MECCA, and he\u2019d go in there for 15, 20 minutes. One day I asked him what was going on, and he showed me. So I started lifting with him. That was something that was taboo for me at the time, but he said, \u2018As long as we get up shots afterward, we\u2019ll be fine. We\u2019ll get our touch back.\u2019\u2019\u2019 Defensively, Johnson is convinced there were three or four Bucks victories that were clinched when Moncrief came up with steals to thwart any opposing heroics. \u201cHe was so good at coming up big defensively in big moments,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI always say Michael Jordan is the greatest two-way player I\u2019ve ever seen. Sidney Moncrief is second.\u201d Moncrief\u2019s position was loaded in the \u201880s with dangerous scorers and fine athletes: Dennis Johnson, Darrell Griffith, Andrew Toney, Otis Birdsong, David Thompson, Walter Davis, World B. Free, Rolando Blackman, George Gervin, Clyde Drexler and Jordan. His head-to-heads with Jordan started well enough, Milwaukee winning five of the first eight meetings and a 3-1 first-round playoff series at the end of Jordan\u2019s rookie season. Then it turned: Jordan\u2019s team went 12-2 over their final 14 clashes. In the 22 regular-season games overall, Jordan averaged 31.6 points to Moncrief\u2019s 14.6. Moncrief\u2019s effective strategy on defense \u2013 take away strengths, nudge them toward weaker moves \u2013 didn\u2019t pay off the same against the Bulls star. Their careers weren\u2019t in sync either, with Moncrief\u2019s knobby knees and other body parts limiting his availability and effectiveness starting in 1986-87, with Jordan\u2019s star fully ascending. He played the equivalent of two seasons over his final three in Milwaukee, averaging 11.6 points and 25.6 minutes. By the end of 1988-89, at age 31, Moncrief called it quits. A year away from the game did wonders for his physical well-being, so he put out feelers in the summer of 1990 and found a taker in Atlanta for a part-time reserve and resident \u201cold head.\u201d Now he calls that season, with Dominique Wilkins, Moses Malone, Doc Rivers and some raw young players, his \u201cmost rewarding year in basketball.\u201d After being a high pick and an All-Star, Moncrief welcomed a smaller role, including winning a roster spot and earning a non-guaranteed contract by averaging 4.7 points in 15.2 minutes. \u201cIt was all about basketball, and I enjoyed it,\u201d he said of his final season. Moncrief left Milwaukee as arguably the second greatest player in franchise history behind Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. And as disappointing as it was that his teams, despite winning nearly 64 percent of their games in his Milwaukee run, never broke through to the Finals, getting eliminated year after year by Boston or Philadelphia makes sense, in hindsight. The Bucks got bounced from the conference finals three times in four years (Sixers in \u201983, Celtics in \u201984 and 86). \u201cWe were good. We got everything out of those teams that we could to do as well as we did,\u201d Moncrief said. \u201cWe were just not the better team during that era.\u201d Conventional wisdom says that those Milwaukee teams, as a result, are underappreciated. Nelson, for instance, ranks the 1983 and 1984 squads as the best he ever coached. But the old Hall of Famer doesn\u2019t agree that the ring not won sticks to individual players.  \u201cYou don\u2019t have to win championships necessarily to have the respect of the Hall,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cI\u2019m a good example. I\u2019ve never won a championship as a coach, but I went into the Hall of Fame as a coach. It took me a while to get in, but that\u2019s fine.\u201d A common question for yesterday\u2019s legends is, how would his game translate to today\u2019s game? With Moncrief, as with so many of the era, it would be unfair to focus on his 3-point field goal percentage (.284). The weapon got to the NBA the same season he did and didn\u2019t merit practice time or game-planning. \u201cIf Sidney had worked on it the way they do know, he\u2019d have been a 36, 37, 38 percent shooter, because of how tough he was mentally,\u201d Marques Johnson said. A current comp, in demeanor if not in level of accomplishment? Johnson called Bucks guard George Hill a \u201cpoor man\u2019s Sid.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s nowhere near that superstar status, but he\u2019s a guy you\u2019d love playing with. A guy who plays at both ends, knocks down big shots. The main thing that reminds me of Sidney is George\u2019s stoic attitude. He just competes.\u201d Johnson added: \u201cHe was first-class athlete who jumped out of the gym and dunked on Robert Parish and 7-footers on a regular basis. Who led us in rebounding a couple of years. And he worked on his outside shooting so much, he became a better than average shooter. So he\u2019d translate really well to today\u2019s game. He\u2019d be about a $40 million a year player.\u201d Nelson recalled Moncrief playing big with a 35-inch vertical leap, but also his knack for playing small. \u201cHe had a way to make himself thin, to get through seams,\u201d the coach said. \u201cThere was a technique that he used that he taught to other guys on our team. He just had a way to physically force his way in and get so small, and not get picked off by the screens.\u201d As for Moncrief\u2019s demeanor, he never broke character when the ball went up. Yet teammates saw a side of Moncrief the public did not. \u201cLike in all of us, there are two different people,\u201d Bridgeman said. \u201cThe basketball person is exactly like you saw. He was serious when he played, when he was working out, before the games. The game \u2013 like all great players \u2013 was what was important to him. \u201cBut away from the game, it was a different Sidney. We\u2019d laugh. He went to the movies a lot. He told jokes. It was probably different from what people thought.\u201d Moncrief is more relaxed and outgoing these days as a businessman and entrepreneur, his latest incarnation after a dozen different post-playing pursuits. He coached for a few seasons, including with Nelson as a defensive guru in Dallas and Golden State and with the Bucks under Scott Skiles. He has invested in real estate, owned a Buick dealership, served on corporate boards and was thought to have a future in Arkansas politics. Currently, he and his wife of four years, Takisha, run Moncrief One Team, a corporate coaching and motivational program. He has written six books to that end, and resides in the Dallas area, where all but one of his four grown sons (Jon, Brett, Jason, Jeffrey) live. \u201cI\u2019m really introverted by nature,\u201d Moncrief said. \u201cBut my overall life experiences, success and failures, has certainly equipped me to give certain insight to schools and individuals. It\u2019s so natural for me to do what I\u2019m doing. And I love everything about my life right now. If someone can say that, that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

He knows his confidence has. It has been a hectic and nonexistent offseason for the soon-to-be Washington Wizards rookie \u2014 drafted No. 9 overall in June, played NBA summer league in July and has been with the Japanese national team since. Japan\u2019s 89-76 loss to the Czech Republic on Tuesday meant Hachimura and his team will likely finish no better than 17th at this 32-team World Cup, but he\u2019s still seeing plenty of upside to his summer. \u201cIt\u2019s been crazy,\u201d Hachimura said. \u201cI got drafted, went to D.C. and we had like a minicamp, then Summer League and now the World Cup. It\u2019s been a crazy summer but I\u2019ve been having fun with this experience, this process. I\u2019ve played a lot of games this summer, everywhere. I don\u2019t know how much I grew, but I have more confidence.\u201d Japan might be winless in its two World Cup games \u2014 and has a matchup against the U.S. looming Thursday \u2014 but the stage has not seemed too big for Hachimura. The 6-foot-9 forward has averaged 18 points so far on 50 percent shooting, while adding 6.5 rebounds, 3 assists and 1.5 steals per game. Wizards general manager Tommy Sheppard even made the trip to Asia to watch Hachimura in person, going to Japan first for the pre-tourney games and then following the team to China. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be a really nice player in the NBA,\u201d Sheppard said. \u201cHe\u2019s got a lot \u2014 a lot \u2014 of upside. He\u2019s got a lot of learning to do, but he\u2019s got excellent skill and excellent will. \u2026 It just takes time, and we have to develop that.\u201d Hachimura\u2019s talent was on obvious display in Las Vegas at Summer League, where he averaged 19.3 points on 50 percent shooting in three games. He scored 31 points in Japan\u2019s pre-World Cup win over Germany \u2014 a game attended by nearly 20,000 at the Saitama Super Arena last month \u2014 and already has captured his homeland\u2019s attention, as evidenced by the many Japanese fans who made the trip to China. \u201cRui\u2019s got a lot of talent,\u201d said Nick Fazekas, Japan\u2019s U.S.-born center. \u201cHe works hard, but he has a lot of fun.\u201d Basketball is growing in Japan for many reasons. The Tokyo Olympics are less than a year away, and the NBA \u2014 in a move that should build Olympic buzz \u2014 is sending Toronto and Houston to Japan for a pair of preseason games in October.

The U.S. trailed by two in the final seconds of regulation and by one in the final seconds of overtime. But it survived thanks to a pair of Jayson Tatum free throws to send the game to overtime and a pair of Khris Middleton free throws for the win. The U.S. opened up a 15-point lead midway through the second quarter, but Turkey responded with a 12-0 run to get back in the game. It stayed close and was tied midway through the fourth. Turkey had multiple chances to take the lead and finally did so with an Ersan Ilyasova tip-in over Joe Harris with 12.3 seconds to go. After Middleton missed an open 3 from the right wing, Donovan Mitchell got his hand on the rebound. Kemba Walker saved the ball back to Mitchell, who found Tatum at the top of the key. He pump-faked one defender out of the play and was fouled by Cedi Osman on a pull-up 3 just before the buzzer. The referees reviewed the play and gave Tatum three free throws with 0.1 seconds left on the clock. He made the first, missed the second, and made the third to give the U.S. a chance in overtime. Down one with 14.6 seconds left in OT, the U.S. inbounded the ball to Myles Turner, who couldn\u2019t find an open man and was stripped. Joe Harris then committed an unsportsmanlike foul (not going for the ball), giving Turkey two free throws and the ball. That could have shut the door, but Dogus Balbay and Osman proceeded to go 0-for-4 at the line. Tatum rebounded the final miss in traffic, drove down the floor and found Middleton cutting down the left side of the lane. He was fouled by Turkey\u2019s Bugrahan Tuncer and converted both free throws with 2.1 seconds left. During the fast break, Tatum sprained his left ankle. He will be re-evaluated on Wednesday. Turkey advanced the ball after Middleton\u2019s made free throws, but Ilyasova missed a step-back three for the win. The Americans struggled to find good shots against Turkey\u2019s 2-3 zone, scoring just 40 points on their final 46 possessions of regulation. They shot just 35 percent from the field and had twice as many turnovers (14) as they had in their win over the Czech Republic on Sunday. Middleton led the U.S. with 15 points. Kemba Walker added 14, including five straight in overtime that erased a five-point Turkey lead. Ilyasova led Turkey with 23 points and 14 rebounds. With the win, the U.S. has qualified for the second round of the World Cup. The winner of the game between Turkey and the Czech Republic on Thursday will be the second team to advance out of Group E. The Americans will close out Group E play with a game against Japan on Thursday. The U.S. has a 55-game winning streak in (non-exhibition) games with a roster made up entirely of NBA players, going back to the bronze-medal game of the 2006 World Championship. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

The United States Men\u2019s National Team\u2019s performance in its 88-67 win over the Czech Republic on Sunday wasn\u2019t spectacular. But it was solid, and the U.S. showed that it could work through some early offensive struggles and clamp down defensively when it needed to. Myles Turner summed it up: \u201cWe still got a lot of work to do. I think it was a good first game. We got the jitters out. Everybody was jacked up, amped to play. But on both sides of the ball, we still got a lot of film to analyze.\u201d The Czechs don\u2019t have the same level of talent as the toughest opponents the Americans will potentially face in the knockout rounds. But the offensive elements \u2014 pick-and-roll play, ball movement, back-door cuts \u2014 that will challenge the U.S. defense were there. So holding the opponent to just 67 points on 75 possessions (0.89 per) is a good sign. The Czech Republic shot just 41 percent from the field. They were 8-for-18 (44 percent) from 3-point range, but the 18 attempts is a indication that the U.S. defense was properly aggressive on the perimeter. The Czechs had a moment. It was a 9-0 run that put them up 11-7 midway through the first quarter. They had a couple of nice buckets off cuts in the paint, but the bigger issues for the U.S. were on the other end of the floor, where they went six straight possessions without a score. Turner missed a contested spin move in the post, Jaylen Brown stepped out of bounds on the break, Donovan Mitchell missed a step-back jumper, Khris Middleton missed a catch-and-shoot three, Mitchell missed a pull-up three, and Turner missed a pick-and-pop, foul-line jumper. The only look inside in that sequence was Turner\u2019s post-up. And as great as the Pacers\u2019 center has been for this team through six games, Turner in the post shouldn\u2019t be the only source of inside offense. \u201cI thought we were rushing a lot offensively, just playing really fast,\u201d Kemba Walker said about the early offensive struggles. \u201cMaybe the adrenaline was just pumping so much, the excitement of being here and it being our first game. I thought when we slowed down and played with our pace, that\u2019s when things went right.\u201d Turner\u2019s impact on the other end of the floor made up for his 2-for-7 shooting performance. He blocked a couple of shots early, and the U.S. ended the 9-0 Czech run with his pick-and-roll defense. He first forced Tomas Satoransky to pick up the ball on a drive, and then recovered back to the roll man, so that the airborne Sato had nowhere to go with the ball. The errant pass led to a Mitchell drive in transition. Harrison Barnes and Joe Harris got a couple of more buckets inside and the Americans completed a 10-0 run with another fast break (Kemba Walker feeding Derrick White for a dunk) off another live-ball turnover. With a clogged paint sometimes making it tough to generate offense, those live-ball turnovers are gold. Another one led to a Tatum three that capped a 10-2 run to start the second quarter. That was when the U.S. really took control. \u201cWe have to be a team that\u2019s going to pressure those guys on defense and play in transition,\u201d Walker said afterward. \u201cThat\u2019s who we want to be.\u201d After scoring just 17 points on 20 possessions (0.85 per) in the first quarter, the U.S. scored 71 points on 57 possessions (1.25 per) thereafter. There was another six-possession, scoreless stretch early in the third quarter, though. They can survive two of those against the Czech Republic, but maybe not against the better European teams. The Czech Republic tried early and often to post up their bigger guys (mostly Satoransky) on Walker. But Walker held his own. In fact, the Czechs scored just four points on the seven possessions in which they posted against Walker in the first half. He forced one turnover and Turner forced another when he helped inside. Afterward, the 6-1 Walker was asked if he wants his teammates to come with a double-team when he\u2019s being posted up. \u201cNo, I\u2019m good,\u201d he said. \u201cI tell \u2019em let me play. I\u2019m good down there. I can play some post defense. That\u2019s on them [if they double].\u201d Turkey will have some more big guards to defend on Tuesday. Serbia, meanwhile, doesn\u2019t have anybody shorter than 6-5 on their roster. After getting only 10 3-point attempts off in more than 95 exhibition minutes, Harris got three shots from deep in less than 20 minutes on Sunday. And he knocked the first two down. Whether he\u2019s shooting or not, his spacing is critical, but it\u2019s still good to get the NBA\u2019s leading 3-point shooter some 3-point shots. \u201cThe ball was moving a little bit more today,\u201d Harris said. \u201cThe last few games, we\u2019ve kind of been tinkering with stuff, here and there. Today, we kind of just got out, played aggressively, and tried to play in attack-mode from the get-go.\u201d Harris hasn\u2019t let his shooting define him, though. In almost every game so far, he\u2019s had a couple of big defensive rebounds in traffic. He hit the floor for one loose ball on Sunday. \u201cYou\u2019re playing in really quick minute bursts,\u201d Harris said. \u201cYou\u2019re not leaving anything in the tank. Everybody\u2019s playing very aggressive. You\u2019re doing what you can to help the team. And for me, I\u2019m out there trying to space the floor, knock down shots, and do the little stuff, get the 50-50 balls, crash the offensive glass, and crash the defensive glass.\u201d Speaking of those quick stints on the floor, Harris noted that U.S. head coach Gregg Popovich isn\u2019t exactly forthcoming with how the rotation is going to play out. Players know what their roles are when they\u2019re on the floor, they just don\u2019t know when they\u2019ll be on the floor. \u201cNobody really knows where their playing time is at,\u201d Harris said. \u201cWe just know that when you\u2019re in there, you\u2019re busting your ass.\u201d They won\u2019t be busting their ass on Monday, though. Popovich has decided not to practice on Labor Day, and the team will just hold a shootaround Tuesday morning in preparation for what should be their toughest game in Group E. They face Turkey Tuesday night (8:30 a.m. ET). Every team has played one game, and there weren\u2019t any real surprises over the weekend, though Germany hanging with France in a 78-74 defeat on Sunday is noteworthy in regard to the future of both teams. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

They converted the last of those into a Jayson Tatum transition 3-pointer that put them up 27-16, and the Czechs never got the lead back down to single digits. > Team USA Notebook: Good signs in win The U.S. took care of the ball themselves, committing only seven turnovers, a big improvement from the 19 they committed in their last exhibition game against Canada. They only got to the line six times, but shot 50 percent from the field and drained 10 3-pointers on 26 attempts. Donovan Mitchell led the U.S. with 16 points on 7-for-11 shooting, highlighted by a two-handed dunk midway through the fourth quarter. \u201cWe did a lot of good things,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cWe guarded it well.

The Czechs scored the first four points of the fourth quarter to get within 66-52, but the Americans weren\u2019t threatened. Walker made a 3-pointer to stop the mini-run, found Mitchell in the corner for another 3-pointer that made it 72-52 about a minute later and the outcome was academic from there. The Czechs had their highlight run early for a quick 11-7 lead, and the couple thousand of their fans in Shanghai \u2014 most of them wearing either white or blue team jerseys, with a few Wizards jerseys for Satoransky mixed in there \u2014 were roaring. It didn\u2019t last long. After a 9-0 run by the Czechs, order was quickly restored. The Americans scored the next 10 points, kick-starting what became a 29-9 run in all, and led by as many as 16 before going into the half with a 43-29 edge. And it was defense that carried the Americans. Over a 10-minute stretch of the half, the Czechs went 4 for 20 with seven turnovers. \u201cThe chemistry is building,\u201d Barnes said. \u201cLooking forward to it continuing to build.\u201d The Americans started a lineup of Walker, Mitchell, Tatum, Barnes and Myles Turner. But 11 of the 12 players saw the floor by early in the second quarter, and 11th man Derrick White was a spark in that early-second run that helped the U.S. take control. The U.S. has a 54-game winning streak in (non-exhibition) games with a roster made up entirely of NBA players, going back to the bronze-medal game of the 2006 World Championship.

It was Italy\u2019s first FIBA World Cup appearance in more than a decade. Former NBA player Andray Blatche and Jaymar Perez led the Philippines with 15 points each. Behind Michal Sokolowski\u2019s 16 points and nine rebounds on 7-for-9 shooting, Poland collected its first win on the world stage in 52 years. Pedro Chourio paced Venezuela with 15 points. Poland\u2019s last World Cup victory came on June 10, 1967 against Uruguay. Russia erased a late eight-point deficit to secure a big victory to start Group B play. Mikhail Kulagin led Russia with 16 points while Andrey Vorontsevich added 14. Timberwolves guard Josh Okogie paced Nigeria with 18 points. David Huertas scored a game-high 34 points and Gary Browne added 10 to help Puerto Rico edge Iran in Group C play.

Many of the world\u2019s top players \u2014 and a couple of the world\u2019s top national teams \u2014 are not in China for the FIBA World Cup, a 32-team extravaganza that begins Saturday. At stake over the next 16 days: The world championship, along with seven of the 11 remaining available berths in next summer\u2019s Tokyo Olympics. And several teams figure they can be the one to thwart the United States\u2019 bid for an unprecedented third straight crown. \u201cWe\u2019re here to go for gold,\u201d said Sasha Djordjevic, the coach of Serbia \u2014 a team that some consider the tournament\u2019s gold-medal favorite. \u201cEvery game that we play will be the biggest game for us.\u201d The first eight games of the tournament are Saturday, and things will move quite rapidly. The eight-game-a-day pace continues through Sept. 9, with quarterfinal games on Sept. 10 and 11, semifinals on Sept. 13 with the event capped by the gold- and bronze-medal games in Beijing on Sept. 15. All told, 92 games will be played in eight cities. \u201cWe have nothing to lose,\u201d said Japan guard Yuta Watanabe, whose team will face the U.S. in the group stage. FIBA changed much about the tournament for this edition. The event was moved back a year; the last World Cup was in 2014, and it was bumped to 2019 this time around to avoid going against the FIFA World Cup for men\u2019s soccer in the same years. The field was expanded from 24 to 32 and qualifying rules were vastly altered largely to keep NBA and other pro-league players from helping their countries reach the event. For some nations, that became a huge problem. European champion Slovenia, the world\u2019s seventh-ranked team, is not in the World Cup. Same goes for world No. 9-ranked Croatia, which lost eight of its 12 qualifying games. Yet for other nations, the changes sparked opportunity \u2014 Nigeria, Venezuela, Italy and Japan all qualified for the first time since 2006, and Poland made the field for the first time since 1967. \u201cThe World Cup is an unbelievable competition,\u201d said Canada coach Nick Nurse, who doubles as coach of the NBA champion Toronto Raptors. \u201cGreat teams and coaches and scouting and work and preparation that will make anyone better for going through that. So I\u2019m extremely honored and excited and humbled to be here.\u201d Most of the top Americans aren\u2019t in the World Cup, a few because of injuries, other candidates cited schedule concerns. Of the 35 leading scorers from this past NBA season who would have been eligible to play for the U.S. team, only two \u2014 Kemba Walker of the Boston Celtics and Donovan Mitchell of the Utah Jazz \u2013 are wearing the red, white and blue in China. \u201cI\u2019m more concerned with who is here than who isn\u2019t,\u201d U.S. coach Gregg Popovich said. For the international teams, though, there\u2019s minimal concern about big-name absences. Greece is led by NBA MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo of the Milwaukee Bucks, Serbia is led by All-NBA center Nikola Jokic of the Denver Nuggets and France features third-team All-NBA center Rudy Gobert. And the host Chinese are hoping to make a splash as well. \u201cIt\u2019s a rare opportunity for all of us,\u201d former NBA player Yi Jianlian, now the Chinese captain, said in Beijing earlier this week. \u201cYou can feel the special duty when you see the national flag on your chest.\u201d Some other things to know as the World Cup begins: FORMAT Teams were drawn into eight groups of four for the opening round, with the two top teams from each group making the round of 16 and the others going into classification games to determine 17th through 32nd place. Games are four 10-minute quarters, so regulation is eight minutes shorter than an NBA game. The 3-point line is a bit closer than in the NBA, especially from the top of the arc \u2013 that\u2019s 22 feet, 2 inches in FIBA play, or 19 inches closer than the NBA stripe. The top two teams from the Americas, top two from Europe and top regional finisher form Asia, Africa and Oceania will clinch spots to join Japan in the 2020 Olympics; the last four spots in the 12-team field for the Tokyo Games will come down to qualifying next July. BEST GROUP The so-called \u201cgroup of death\u201d would be Group H, with Australia (which just beat the U.S. in a friendly to snap a 78-game winning streak by the Americans), Lithuania and Canada. All three of those teams are likely good enough to advance, yet only two will get to the round of 16 with a shot at the quarterfinals. Senegal rounds out that group. U.S. RECORD The Americans have won 19 consecutive World Cup (formerly known as the world championship) games, and are 14-0 in games in China when using a roster composed of NBA players (8-0 in the 2008 Olympics and 6-0 in other games there in 2006 and 2008). Mason Plumlee is the only player on this year\u2019s U.S. World Cup team that was on the gold-medal-winning roster at this event in 2014. REFRESHER COURSE Seven of the eight quarterfinalists from the 2014 World Cup are in this year\u2019s field. The U.S. beat Lithuania and Serbia beat France in the semifinals, and the Americans rolled to a 129-92 win in the gold-medal game behind 26 points from Kyrie Irving. France rallied in the fourth quarter to beat Lithuania for bronze 95-93.

It turned out to be their final pre-competition practice, because head coach Gregg Popovich canceled their session for Saturday. Once the competition starts, the U.S. will be playing every other day, with three changes of location between the first round and the semifinals (should the Americans make it there). So practice time could be somewhat limited going forward. But the games, against new and unfamiliar opponents, are arguably better opportunities to get better than practices. The first few games should come without much pressure, and maybe it\u2019s a good thing that the Americans have already been through a pressure situation in their preparation for the World Cup. Of course, the U.S. lost that second exhibition game to Australia last Saturday. The Americans had issues on both ends of the floor, but really, it was their defense that really let them down, allowing 98 points on 84 Australia possessions (1.17 per). It was an exhibition, but it was the first loss by an all-NBA-player U.S. team since the semifinals of the 2006 World Championship. That\u2019s a long winning streak to see come to an end. \u201cObviously, it sucked in the moment,\u201d Brook Lopez said about the loss. \u201cBut it was definitely good for us, looking ahead to the World Cup.\u201d Defense is about effort and energy. And in a 40-minute game, consistent effort and energy is all the more important. \u201cWe can\u2019t take part of a game for granted and can\u2019t have our level of intensity ever drop,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cIf anything, it has to increase throughout each and every game. We relented as a group. After we beat Australia in the first game, they came out with everything they had. It showed us a little glimpse of the focus and concentration we have to have the entire time here in China.\u201d The following-day film session wasn\u2019t easy, but according to Kemba Walker, they didn\u2019t need it to figure out what went wrong. \u201cI think we knew before we even watched film,\u201d Walker said. \u201cIt was tough, and you know, Pop can be pretty tough. We knew, and I think that\u2019s why we came out against Canada [on Monday] the way we did. It was a very humbling loss. And hopefully that [feeling] is going to get us over that hump.\u201d The win over Canada was the U.S. Team\u2019s worst offensive performance of its exhibition slate, but the overmatched Canadians scored just once on their first 10 possessions of the game (and just nine points in the first quarter). The U.S. can smother some of these lesser talented teams (like the ones they\u2019ll face in Group E). But against the best teams in the tournament (like Australia, who they could face in the quarterfinals), there has to be both effort and cohesion defensively. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a very unselfish team that passes the ball very well,\u201d Lopez said. \u201c[Andrew] Bogut, especially, is such a huge hub for them.\u201d Bogut suffered an ankle injury in Australia\u2019s exhibition loss to Germany on Wednesday, but is reportedly \u201cprobable\u201d for their opener against Canada on Sunday .  Myles Turner was one of the United States\u2019 best players over their five-game exhibition slate. Not only did he put up boxscore numbers (averaging 15.2 points and 12.7 rebounds), but the U.S. was also at its best with him on the floor , outscoring its opponents by 48 points in his 83 minutes. That Turner emerged as the go-to center was somewhat of a relief to USA Basketball managing director Jerry Colangelo, who wasn\u2019t sure what he was going to get out of his group of big men. \u201cWe were looking for someone to come out of the pack of the bigs, and he has,\u201d Colangelo said Friday. \u201cHe\u2019s had a couple of major rebounding games. He\u2019s very active. If he keeps active, he\u2019s going to get rebounds and he\u2019s going to block some shots.\u201d Colangelo wasn\u2019t totally surprised by Turner\u2019s play, though. \u201cI had expectations that he could be [the starting center],\u201d he said, \u201cbecause I was told that he\u2019s had a great summer in terms of his personal work.\u201d Good news for the U.S., and maybe good news for the Indiana Pacers. Popovich was asked what he wants to do in his free time in China. Alas, free time is limited when you have games every other day. \u201cThere are things that I would like to do,\u201d Popovich said, \u201cthat I know that I will not have time to do, because the focus is on what we\u2019re doing here.\u201d What is it that he\u2019d really like to do? Well, the coach is an explorer. \u201cMostly to get out and walk,\u201d he said, \u201cto see neighborhoods and walk and be with nobody, not be able to speak the language, and feel like an idiot. \u201cJust walk around, walk into a place, see what happens and see what you see. It\u2019s more fun when you\u2019re in another country and you just take off. You don\u2019t assume anything and you don\u2019t have people tell you where to go. You just see where you end up. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to have the chance to do that, so I\u2019m going to go to restaurants at night.\u201d The U.S. plays its first game on Sunday, but the World Cup gets started on Saturday with games in Groups A, B, C and D . A couple of Saturday games \u2013 Poland vs. Venezuela in Group A and Nigeria vs. Russia in Group B \u2013 are between what look to be the second and third best teams in those groups. And because two teams from each group advance to the second round, those first-day matchups could end up determining which teams make it through. Saturday also brings the first action for Andray Blatche and the Philippines, who will face Italy (with Marco Belinelli and Danilo Gallinari) in Group D. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

The team announced Pachulia\u2019s hiring Thursday along with naming Steve Kerr\u2019s entire coaching staff and the promotion of ex-forward Mike Dunleavy Jr. to assistant general manager. Pachulia played for the back-to-back champion Warriors teams of 2017 and \u201918 before spending the final season of his 16-year playing career with Detroit. He is eager to be part of a new era beginning this season at San Francisco\u2019s Chase Center, which the Warriors have been showing off this week as opening nears next month. \u201cI\u2019m super excited and looking forward to it,\u201d Pachulia said in a text message. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a fun process.\u201d While Pachulia only appeared in seven games during the 2018 run with no starts after starting 15 postseason games the previous year, his veteran presence and team-first mindset meant so much to Kerr and the Warriors.

He played for the Warriors from 2002 through part of \u201907. Aaron Miles, who spent the past two seasons coaching the G-League Warriors in Santa Cruz and guided Golden State\u2019s summer league squad, earned himself a spot as a player development coach, and so did former Cal star Theo Robertson as he returns to the franchise and Luke Loucks and Seth Cooper, as well. Loucks had been the franchise\u2019s two-way coach also working with Santa Cruz. The remainder of the staff under Kerr remains intact with assistants Mike Brown, Jarron Collins, Bruce Fraser, Ron Adams and assistant coach and director of player development Chris DeMarco.

That means we\u2019ll get our first NBA action next month with the preseason slate beginning on the 30th. Training camps will be opening, media days will take place and before we know it, we\u2019ll be tipping off the 2019-20 season on Oct. 22. It feels like opening night is within arm\u2019s reach, right? Not quite. It\u2019s still August. And so, as the doldrums of the NBA offseason continue, we\u2019re looking back at the 10 best scorers in the fourth quarter \u2014 a moment not every player is built for \u2014 during the 2018-19 season. To be clear, this isn\u2019t an opinion piece. It\u2019s a factual list \u2014 courtesy of our extensive stats site \u2014 with some additional context. The ranking consists of players who averaged the most points in the fourth quarter ( minimum 41 games played , half the NBA season) . 1. LeBron James, 8.6 points  Being a dominant scorer over the course of a game \u2014 an average of 27.4 points \u2014 in season No. 16 is one thing. Maintaining that pace throughout the game\u2019s most important frame is another. LeBron\u2019s been a consistent force in the fourth quarter, ranking top 10 in points per game during each of the last seven seasons. His late-game numbers alone should dispel beliefs that he\u2019s slowed down or is coming off a mediocre (for him) campaign. Harden\u2019s historic season, which he described as \u201c one for the books ,\u201d included a career-high in fourth-quarter scoring. Harden unleashes every skill in his distinctive arsenal late in games, with his best fourth-quarter performance last season coming against the eventual 2019 champs. The 2018 Kia MVP also led the NBA in points scored during clutch time , the last five minutes (and overtime minutes) of games within five points. Walker earned the first All-NBA nod of his career last season, and his end-of-game performances helped achieve that. He shot 41.7 percent from the perimeter in the final period \u2014 a 6.1 percent uptick from his season average beyond the arc. From Isaiah Thomas to Kyrie Irving to now Walker, the members of Boston\u2019s point guard carousel have continued to have one thing in common: a propensity to deliver late. Much to Kemba\u2019s dismay, the reigning Kia MVP also carried his team late in games, including the fourth quarter of a Jan. 26 outing in which he outscored the entire Hornets roster. Giannis has showcased steady improvement in the late frame, raising his average from 5.5 points in 2016-17 to 6.8 points in 2017-18 and now 7.7 points in 2018-19. The cold-blooded sixth-man, who finished at the top of this list in 2017-18, knows when to put on a show. It\u2019s something about the final 12 minutes that seems to increase Williams\u2019 ability to pulverize defenses. The fourth quarter was his highest scoring period last season, and by a considerably large margin (3.2 ppg in first quarter, 5.1 ppg. in second, 4.3 in third). With Williams\u2019 immense contributions, the LA Clippers averaged the most fourth-quarter points per game (28.8) since the Denver Nuggets in the 1990-91 season (30.2), per Elias Sports Bureau. The Clippers added another upper-class closer to its rotation this summer. Fifth in total fourth-quarter points last season, George wore down defenses and scored at will when it mattered most. His timely baskets \u2014 just one element of his MVP-caliber season \u2014 were scored with remarkable 43.5\/40.0\/88.7 shooting splits. And for what it\u2019s worth: The Clippers also just added the No. 1 fourth-quarter scorer of last season\u2019s playoff run. Those final 12 minutes might feel like hours for LA\u2019s opponents. Booker, 22, is no doubt as fearless as they come, and while he\u2019s virtually the only true scorer on his team, many young players shy away from these moments. Or simply can\u2019t deliver. The Suns\u2019 sharpshooter has averaged at least six points in the fourth quarter throughout the last three seasons, well above average. Maybe teams will throw more late-game double teams at him in 2019-20? Davis\u2019 season of drama certainly overshadowed any of his on-court production. He only played in 42 fourth quarters, but averaged 6.8 points in those periods for the second consecutive season. The six-time All-Star simply knows how to create looks for himself down the stretch. Couple his late-game services with LeBron\u2019s closing capabilities, and the Lakers have some key qualities needed to win tight games in the West. In the first two seasons of Mitchell\u2019s nascent career, he\u2019s finished top-10 in this category. The poised guard shoulders a massive offensive load in Utah and carries that burden into the final period. He has 39 career games with at least 10 points in the fourth quarter alone. For context, LeBron posted 33 double-digit, fourth-quarter performances throughout his first two NBA seasons. Kobe did it 13 times, and Harden 11. Beal authored the highest-scoring season of his career with backcourt mate John Wall sidelined. Wall\u2019s injury also meant Beal would become the chief option for buckets in the fourth quarter. He answered the call, shooting at a healthy clip of 51.6 percent from the field and 40.0 percent from 3-point range in the last 12 minutes of games. Narrow it down to the last two minutes when the game is within five points and his efficiency is \u2014 impressively \u2014 just as productive (51.0, 38.1).

Nearly a half-century after his graduation from the U.S. Air Force Academy, it hasn\u2019t been uncommon in recent San Antonio Spurs offseasons for Popovich to return for workouts on the wooded trails of that campus in Colorado. He\u2019d be gasping thin air found at 7,700 feet above sea level, lungs heaving, mind racing. As a student, he\u2019d go there to think. As a graduate, he\u2019s done the same. \u201cWhat you learn there is to get over yourself,\u201d said Popovich, a five-time NBA champion coach with the Spurs. \u201cIt\u2019s not about you.\u201d That is why Popovich\u2019s first stint as coach of the U.S. men\u2019s basketball team \u2014 it starts in earnest this weekend, when the Americans open their quest for a third consecutive basketball World Cup championship \u2014 has not become some sort of comeuppance tour for infamous previous attempts at gold that went awry. As such, this World Cup isn\u2019t about avenging the disappointment that Popovich still carries over getting cut from the 1972 U.S. Olympic team as a player despite having a stellar few days at tryouts for the team that lost a controversial gold-medal game to Russia. It isn\u2019t about how the 2002 world championships team that he was an assistant on finished sixth, or how the 2004 Olympic team that he assisted managed only a bronze. The Air Force Academy taught Popovich to focus on the current mission. Right now, and that\u2019s guiding the U.S. to gold in the World Cup. \u201cPop is completely locked in on this one thing,\u201d USA Basketball managing director Jerry Colangelo said. \u201cHe understands what the goal is, what we\u2019re playing for here.\u201d The Americans arrived in Shanghai on Thursday, with Popovich one of the first to greet some fans who waited at the team hotel and sign a couple dozen autographs. He took his time with each, carefully scripting the cursive, telling those who camped out on a rainy morning that there was no need to rush. His team opens play Sunday against the Czech Republic, then faces Turkey and Japan later next week in the last two group-stage games. Getting out of group play shouldn\u2019t be difficult; two of those four teams will move on to the round of 16. But a loss in an exhibition at Australia last week suggested that this U.S. team could be more than a little vulnerable against the other World Cup contenders. Popovich has been telling his team that winning the World Cup will be tough. The loss only reaffirmed what he was saying. \u201cFor a number of reasons, but ultimately the way he talks about us having these three U-S-A letters across our chest, we know what this means to him,\u201d U.S. guard Joe Harris of the Brooklyn Nets said. \u201cHe obviously has a tremendous amount of pride and respect for his country and you can feel it in how he goes about his business. This isn\u2019t something he\u2019s just doing for the hell of it.\u201d Popovich\u2019s backstory, at least the parts he wants to open up about, is well-chronicled. His undergraduate degree was in Soviet Studies. He considered a spy career and has gone through intelligence training. He\u2019s not shy about bringing up his opinions on anything, and in recent years he hasn\u2019t held back on political criticism. Economic relations right now between the U.S. and China are thorny, at best. But when Popovich arrived Thursday, donning a blue jacket with the USA Basketball red, white and blue logo, the Chinese fans who came out to greet the Americans cheered him. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to speculate on what this means to him,\u201d said Will Voigt, Popovich\u2019s former video coordinator in San Antonio and now the coach of the Angolan team competing in this World Cup. \u201cHe is a man of principle. And especially in this day and age in our country, with everything going on, how Team USA represents the country is very important to him. Sometimes that gets lost.\u201d Popovich hasn\u2019t shared much about his 1972 experience with his current U.S. team. He was one of about 60 players under consideration for the Olympic team that summer and shot the ball better than anyone there \u2014 he made 58 percent of his attempts \u2014 but never had a chance at getting picked for the squad. A committee was put together, plenty of politicking was happening and Popovich didn\u2019t partake in the shenanigans. So he got picked for an AAU team instead that played a series of international exhibitions. It wasn\u2019t the same. \u201cThe thing I always wanted to do was be on the Olympic team and play,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cThat was always my dream.\u201d He\u2019s been to the World Cup and Olympics as an assistant, but he\u2019s now the man in charge. He\u2019s replacing the most successful coach in U.S. history, Mike Krzyzewski, the Duke guru who led the U.S. to the last two World Cup titles and the last three Olympic golds. Popovich took a few weeks to formally accept Colangelo\u2019s invitation in 2015 to replace Krzyzewski in this cycle as national team coach for the World Cup and next year\u2019s Olympics in Tokyo. The delay probably wasn\u2019t needed. From the outset, Popovich felt compelled to jump at the chance to serve again. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to separate it if you have been in the military,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cI\u2019ve had classmates that have fought in wars \u2014 I have not \u2014 and some of them are no longer with us. You get an appreciation for people who have sacrificed. So when you have an opportunity to do this for your country, it\u2019s impossible to say no. I love being part of it.\u201d"},{"id":32054,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/ap-kobe-nothing-new-rivalry-shaq","date":"2019-08-29","title":"Kobe: Nothing new to rivalry with Shaq","content":" NEW YORK \u2014 Kobe Bryant downplayed talk of a reignited feud with Shaquille O\u2019Neal, saying Thursday there is \u201cnothing new\u201d that has been said lately between the former teammates. Bryant had recently said that if O\u2019Neal had worked harder, they could have won 12 rings together with the Los Angeles Lakers. O\u2019Neal fired back on social media that they could have won more if Bryant had passed him the ball more often. But Bryant said during a visit to the U.S. Open tennis tournament that the comments don\u2019t mean they are fighting again. \u201cI think people are making it like we\u2019re going back and forth about it, but there\u2019s nothing to go back and forth about,\u201d Bryant said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing that has been said that hasn\u2019t been said before. It\u2019s nothing new.\u201d They did win three titles together from 2000-02, but their fractured relationship led the Lakers to trade O\u2019Neal to the Miami Heat in 2004.

They patched up their relationship later in their careers, sharing MVP honors as Western Conference teammates in the 2009 NBA All-Star Game. Bryant also won two gold medals playing for the U.S. Olympic team. The Americans are preparing to begin play in the Basketball World Cup with a squad that has far less star power than the teams Bryant was on in 2008 and 2012, but he believes they have enough talent to win. \u201cWe\u2019ve got great players. I think the team gets a little chippy about it because everybody\u2019s kind of writing them off because they don\u2019t have the marquee names,\u201d Bryant said. \u201cBut these young players that are playing on this team will be those marquee names in two or three years and they\u2019re great players in their own right.

Though they were undefeated throughout, finishing 42-0 across those five competitions, the U.S. has had some close calls. The 2019 FIBA World Cup could mark the toughest challenge for the United States since they finished third at the 2006 World Championship. Yet \u2013 wielding the most talent from 1-12 on any roster \u2013 the U.S. remains the favorite. But depth isn\u2019t as critical in a single-elimination scenario, nor in a game that\u2019s only 40 minutes long. The U.S. loss to Australia in an pre-tourney exhibition served as a reminder that there exists a thin line between victory and defeat, that before the Americans even compete for a medal, they could again face Australia, this time in the quarterfinals. \u201cWe were humbled a little bit,\u201d Myles Turner said. \u201cJust because you are Team USA doesn\u2019t mean you are going to win every game. Teams are looking to beat us, and we understand that now. We just have to bring it every night. There are no nights off.\u201d There are at least three rosters worth of American players who declined to play this summer or withdrew from consideration after an initial, 20-man, training-camp roster was announced in early June. In fact, after that, the U.S. added 11 more players for consideration. And to get from that group of 31 to a final, 12-man roster for the World Cup, it only had to cut two players. The other 17 either suffered injuries or withdrew. Almost four weeks into the process, after the team\u2019s first practice in Shanghai, the players were still being asked questions about the stars who decided they weren\u2019t going to play. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d said point guard Kemba Walker on Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s all about the guys who are here. We\u2019re the ones who are going to take on this challenge and do what we can to represent our country the best way we can.\u201d The \u201cguys who are here\u201d rank as solid players , but there\u2019s no question that the roster lacks star power. The U.S. Team has just two players \u2013 Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum \u2013 who were drafted in the top five; every other USA roster with NBA players since 1992 has had at least four top-five picks. Just one player \u2013 Kemba Walker \u2013 has ever made an All-NBA team; he placed on the Third Team last season. The only players with senior-level, national-team experience are Mason Plumlee and Harrison Barnes, who had minor roles on the 2014 and 2016 teams, respectively. But experience isn\u2019t as important as the ability to just get buckets when they\u2019re needed. The U.S. has Walker, Tatum and Donovan Mitchell for that task, but those guys are a step below Kevin Durant (who has scored at least 28 points in each of the three gold-medal games in which he\u2019s played), Kyrie Irving (26 in the 2014 gold-medal game) and James Harden (23 in that same 2014 game) in that regard. Though the Australia outcome belies it, the U.S. certainly has the ability to be the best defensive team in the tournament. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be our ticket,\u201d Walker said earlier in training. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be what gets us over the hump. Defensively, we just have to be monsters. We have to.\u201d The U.S. will begin play in Group E, playing games in Shanghai against the Czech Republic (Sept. 1), Turkey (Sept. 3) and Japan (Sept. 5). The top two teams from that pool will advance to the second round, where they will join with the top two teams from Group F (Brazil, Greece, Montenegro and New Zealand) to form Group K in Shenzhen. One of those four games (the two teams from Group E will play one game apiece against the two games from Group F) will very likely feature the U.S. facing NBA MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo and Greece. That probably won\u2019t be an elimination game, but only two teams from Group K will advance to the quarterfinals. Eight groups of four (A-H) turn into four groups of four (I-L), and from those four groups, we get eight teams for the single-elimination tournament that begins September 10 in Dongguan and Shanghai. The groups aren\u2019t all that balanced. You could argue that there are three teams in Group H (Australia, Canada and Lithuania) better than any team in Group A. Argentina isn\u2019t nearly the same team it was several years ago, but it\u2019s likely the best team in Groups A\/B\/I. The two teams that emerge from Group H, meanwhile, will have to compete with France out of Group G for two of the spots in the quarterfinals. Assuming that the U.S. advances out of Group K, its quarterfinal opponent will come from that Australia-France-Lithuania mix. So the Americans could have an elimination-game against a medal-worthy opponent right away. If the favorite isn\u2019t the United States, it\u2019s Serbia, which went 10-0 in its exhibition slate , beating France, Greece, Italy (twice), Lithuania (twice) and Turkey. The Serbs were the silver medalists at the 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Olympics, and they now have an improved and more mature Nikola Jokic (though the tournament won\u2019t be the same without the injured Milos Teodosic). Jokic is Exhibit A of how most of the top talent on other teams is on the frontline. France has Rudy Gobert, Australia has Aron Baynes and Andrew Bogut, Spain has Marc Gasol, and Lithuania has both Domantas Sabonis and Jonas Valanciunas. Seven teams from the World Cup will qualify for next year\u2019s Olympics in Tokyo, but they\u2019re not necessarily the top seven finishers. The teams that will qualify for the Olympics are: As the host, Japan is automatically qualified for the Olympics. The other four teams in the 12-team Olympic field will come from qualifying tournaments that take place early next summer. That\u2019s not too fair to Europe, which accounts for 12 of the 32 (and probably six of the top eight) teams in the World Cup field. But that\u2019s the way it works. So, even if the U.S. were to lose in the knockout rounds, it will almost surely qualify for the Olympics, because it probably won\u2019t finish lower than two other teams from the Americas. As noted above, Argentina has a very good chance of reaching the quarterfinals, but it will be difficult for any of the other five teams from the Americas \u2013 Brazil, Canada, the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico and Venezuela \u2013 to break through. The Americans aren\u2019t here just to qualify for the Olympics, though. Ten new players on the roster means 10 guys who have never won gold. A standard has been set and a loss, no matter how many players declined to be here, would be a huge disappointment. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

An all-night flight from Sydney to Shanghai that landed early Thursday brought the two-time defending World Cup champion Americans to China\u2019s most-populous city, where they\u2019ll play three first round games starting Sunday. It took more than 10 hours of flying time, then another two-plus hours for the team to clear customs and finally reach its hotel. From there, a few hours of relaxing awaited before an afternoon practice. \u201cThe challenges begin,\u201d U.S. coach Gregg Popovich said. A handful of fans waited outside the team hotel on a rainy morning, getting there a couple hours before the buses from the airport pulled in just with the hope of grabbing a few autographs. Some players obliged, as did Popovich \u2014 who used a gold marker to carefully sign his name on an array of photos, sneakers and basketballs. Players said finally getting to China brought a different feel. \u201cIt\u2019s kicked in,\u201d U.S. guard Kemba Walker of the Boston Celtics said after practice. \u201cThe next game we play, it\u2019s the real thing. We\u2019re focused, we\u2019re locked in and we\u2019re ready to play.\u201d It\u2019s not like there hasn\u2019t been challenges already. Just consider the travel itineraries for the U.S. to this point. The flights from Los Angeles to Melbourne, then Melbourne to Sydney and now Sydney to Shanghai add up to nearly 30 hours and 14,000 miles in the air. If the U.S. makes the medal round, there\u2019ll be about another 2,500 miles of travel within China. Add the return flight to the U.S. after the tournament, and the trip\u2019s total will easily exceed 22,000 miles \u2014 more than half a regular season\u2019s worth of travel for most NBA teams. All that flying comes in the span of basically a month. And that doesn\u2019t even count what it took for players to individually reach Las Vegas and Los Angeles, the site of the two training camp weeks, or the promotional trip to China that Donovan Mitchell made earlier this summer. \u201cI think we\u2019re good,\u201d said Mitchell, the Utah Jazz standout who has seen quite a following in China on his past trips to the basketball-crazed nation. \u201cI think we\u2019re doing well. We got here and guys\u2019 energy in practice was great, guys were sharp. When you start to worry about how much we\u2019ve been traveling, that\u2019s when it starts to become a mental thing.\u201d The Americans went 3-1 on their pre-World Cup tour, beating Spain in Anaheim, California , then splitting two games against Australia in Melbourne \u2014 the loss snapping a 78-game winning streak for the senior national team against major competition, dating back to 2006 \u2014 before topping Canada in the final tune-up . Up next on Sunday is the Czech Republic, an opponent that caught Popovich\u2019s eye for the way it battled Lithuania in a pre-World Cup friendly. \u201cWe don\u2019t take anybody lightly,\u201d Popovich said. Popovich noted that there hadn\u2019t been much time for sightseeing on the opening day in Shanghai, and it wouldn\u2019t seem that it\u2019ll be a priority over the next week either. There\u2019s more practices set for Friday and Saturday, then games starting every other day beginning with the matchup against the Czechs. \u201cWe have a great team of guys, very unselfish group,\u201d Bucks center Brook Lopez said before the team left Australia. \u201cWe all have the same goal in mind. A lot of young guys, so we have a lot of guys who are learning on the fly. We don\u2019t have a problem being a team. Our guys have come together really quick.\u201d And now, with the trip to the other side of the world finally complete, the games now count. \u201cThat\u2019s the way it is,\u201d Popovich said."},{"id":32141,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-joe-johnson-workout-sixers-pelicans","date":"2019-08-28","title":"Report: Joe Johnson earns free agent look from 76ers, Pelicans","content":" The Big 3 MVP is reportedly earning an NBA look.

The front of the black shell features CLEVELAND in an orange and black inline typeface that is slanted upwards across the chest. The neckline is a traditional scoop neck that reflects the style of uniform worn during the 1994-95 season. The Nike Swoosh logo is positioned on the upper right chest with the iconic Goodyear Wingfoot logo on the upper left. The player number is in white and offset beneath LAND in CLEVELAND.

The natural maple hardwood floor is framed with a two-toned powder blue and black perimeter and is accented by the wave pattern featured in the Classic Edition design. The lane is solid orange with black and white accents. The Cavs classic logo is also displayed at half court.

At 11 home and select away games this season, the Jazz will wear purple uniforms based on the road kits from 1996-2004, a period that included back-to-back trips to the NBA Finals in 1997 and 1998. The Classic Edition uniforms were first revealed by the Jazz via social media this morning in a special animated video where the jerseys visually link former Jazz players Jeff Hornacek, Karl Malone and John Stockton with current Jazzmen Mike Conley, Rudy Gobert and Donovan Mitchell.  Classic Edition jerseys are currently available for pre-sale online at jazzteamstore.com . Additional purple mountain-themed merchandise such as T-shirts and caps can be purchased now at Vivint Smart Home Arena in the Utah Jazz Team Store from 11 a.m.-6 p.m. weekdays. Additionally, when the team takes the floor at Vivint Smart Home Arena donning their Classic Edition uniforms this season, they will play on a replica of the Jazz basketball court from that period. \u201cI remember as a kid watching the Jazz when they wore these jerseys in the Finals. I\u2019m excited about them,\u201d said new Jazz guard Mike Conley, who participated in a Classic Edition uniform rollout video. \u201cI think it\u2019s great. You get so used to wearing the same two or three jerseys, and then you pull out a new one and it gets your juices flowing. We\u2019re all excited.\u201d The Classic Edition jersey features the prominent white-to-purple gradient mountain range and is trimmed in purple, teal, white and copper. The \u201990s Jazz wordmark is featured on the front chest, while white numerals trimmed in copper and teal sit underneath. The shorts feature the white mountain range on the left leg, the \u201cUJ\u201d secondary mark on the right leg and the tertiary snowflake basketball logo on the waistband. The uniform also includes the Nike logo on both the jersey and the shorts, as well as the 5 For The Fight partnership patch on the jersey \u2013 the only cause-related jersey patch in the NBA that supports cancer research.  \u201cOne of the most rewarding aspects of sports is sharing moments and memories with family and friends,\u201d said Bart Sharp, senior vice president of marketing for the Jazz. \u201cIt\u2019s our hope that these Classic Edition uniforms will serve as a bridge to unite generations of our fans in their love of Jazz basketball past and present.\u201d On the accompanying replica court, the classic primary logo sits prominently at midcourt and the key is filled by the color teal. Purple is accented in the free throw circle, while the baseline features the snowflake basketball logo flanked by \u201cUtah Jazz\u201d lettering in a western motif. As part of the Road to Tipoff presented by KUTV2 News, the Jazz will host a free Classic Edition event on Saturday, Oct. 19 at Vivint Smart Home Arena to provide a first look at the new court.

He didn\u2019t get much of one this year. There\u2019s a very good reason for that \u2014 a most unusual and, he thinks, worthwhile opportunity. After helping the Toronto Raptors win the NBA championship in June, Gasol is now looking to lead Spain to a World Cup title in September. And although the 7-foot-1 veteran center\u2019s body may have preferred some more downtime before the grind of another season begins, Gasol could not pass up this chance. \u201cIt\u2019s a special group of guys,\u201d Gasol said. \u201cIt\u2019s always special when you put on this jersey. And I couldn\u2019t leave them hanging. That\u2019s what my heart told me and that\u2019s what it keeps telling me.\u201d Gasol was on the team that won the World Cup \u2014 then called the world championship \u2014 for Spain in 2006, rolling past a Greece team that had just beaten the United States in the tournament semifinals. He helped Spain win silver medals at the 2008 and 2012 Olympics, losing both times in the title game to the U.S. He\u2019s the oldest player on a very seasoned team that will play for Spain in this World Cup. Out of the 12 on the final roster for coach Sergio Scariolo, eight have celebrated their 30th birthdays already. But it\u2019s also clear that Gasol, even on a roster featuring the likes of Phoenix\u2019s Ricky Rubio and Real Madrid standout Sergio Llull, is the leader of the bunch. \u201cIt was probably a key move for us, one of the important ones, the most important one,\u201d Scariolo said. \u201cWe need somebody to be the guy who you can give the ball in the tough moments, not necessarily for the shot but to make a good play \u2014 whether it\u2019s to create a shot for a teammate, to take a shot himself, to draw a foul and be a solid free throw shooter. He\u2019s extremely important and the rest of the players respect him a lot.\u201d That respect was there before Toronto topped Golden State in six games for the NBA title. But the ring Gasol will be getting on opening night certainly adds to his legacy. Among players born outside the United States, Gasol is one of only seven \u2014 a list that also includes his older brother Pau Gasol, who would have played in this World Cup had he not gotten injured last season \u2014 to have amassed more than 11,000 points, 6,000 rebounds and 2,700 assists at the NBA level. And when the Raptors added him in a trade last February, their entire makeup seemed to change. \u201cI think we started passing the ball, our assists started going way up, we became the No. 1 3-point shooting team in the league because of the extra passes and the contagious passing,\u201d said Raptors coach Nick Nurse, who is coaching Canada at the World Cup. \u201cAnd our team\u2019s sense of who they thought they could become went up.\u201d The same could ring true for Spain. The U.S. has won the last two World Cups, though a third consecutive gold in the event \u2014 something that no nation has ever accomplished \u2014 hardly seems guaranteed. Spain lost to the Americans by nine in an exhibition earlier this month in Anaheim, California, a game where neither side was exactly in tournament form. >> Every NBA Players In FIBA World Cup Spain should have little, if any, trouble getting through its group phase: It faces Iran, Tunisia and the Dominican Republic in its first three games at Guangzhou, China starting on Friday. The top two teams will advance to the second round. Those first three games will likely become mere tune-ups for Gasol and the Spainards, as they get ready for the bigger matchups later in the tournament. \u201cThe teams that are in the past, they\u2019re in the past,\u201d Gasol said. \u201cWhat matters is the guys who are playing today and their talent and their qualities.\u201d There has been minimal rest for Gasol this summer. The Raptors won the title, had a parade a few days later, and within a few days after that Gasol was simultaneously starting recovery and workouts for the FIBA challenge. Spain spent about a week in the U.S. for the game against the Americans, using that as a bonding trip of sorts. Then it was back to Spain for more games, before heading out to China. All worth it, Gasol said. \u201cI cherish every second of it, every practice, every trip, every lunch that we have together,\u201d Gasol said. \u201cI know how special it is. Obviously it\u2019s not ideal, but I think it was completely worth it to play all the way to June. \u2026 Whenever it is, 10 years from now, when I\u2019m sitting on the beach in Spain, I won\u2019t be able to reproduce this feeling.\u201d >> Facts To Know About FIBA World Cup"},{"id":32146,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/usa-lineup-notebook","date":"2019-08-27","title":"USA Lineup Notebook: Myles Turner shines in exhibition play","content":" The biggest challenge, at least internally, for the United States Men\u2019s National Team as it begins play at the FIBA World Cup will be chemistry. Exhibit A: 19 turnovers in the team\u2019s 84-68 exhibition win over Canada on Monday. When it opens the World Cup with a game against the Czech Republic on Sunday, the U.S. will have had just 15 practices and five exhibition games to prepare. And the final, 12-man roster has only been together and healthy for two of those games. With a roster that\u2019s light on stars yet heavy on good players from good teams, it takes time to figure out a rotation. Five games might not be enough, and it\u2019s clear that the entire exhibition slate has been an experiment in regard to lineups. Head coach Gregg Popovich used five different starting lineups in the five games, with 10 different players starting at least one game. With different starting lineups, there were different second units each night. As a result, only two five-man units played at least 10 minutes over the five games, and only five lineups played in more than one game together. In the exhibition finale (against Canada on Monday), the U.S. didn\u2019t use a single lineup that had played in any of the four previous games. So there\u2019s not much to be gleaned from the numbers for any five-man unit. It\u2019s all small sample sizes. Of course, small sample sizes are all you get with the national team. The U.S. will play just five more games before they reach the elimination rounds of the World Cup. And at that point, one bad stretch could end the United States\u2019 run atop the basketball world. The Americans have won five straight major tournaments, but a third straight World Championship may be the toughest task of that run. The loss to Australia didn\u2019t count, but was the first defeat for an American team comprised of all NBA players since the semifinals of the 2006 World Championship. While there\u2019s not much to be learned from the 103 different lineups that the Senior Team used over the five exhibition games (including one against the U.S. Select Team), the overall data could tell us a few things \u2026 Donovan Mitchell and Kemba Walker were the U.S. Team\u2019s second most-used two-man combination in the exhibition games, having played a little more than 69 minutes together. But De\u2019Aaron Fox\u2019s decision (prior to the team\u2019s departure for Australia) to withdraw has left the U.S. with just three primary ball-handlers, and the third of those \u2014 Derrick White \u2014 has been the 11th man in the rotation. The win over Canada featured Popovich\u2019s tightest rotation. The five starters were back on the floor just a minute and a half into the second quarter, White didn\u2019t play until late in the first half, and Brook Lopez didn\u2019t play until midway through the third quarter. But with Mitchell and Walker starting together, there were still some minutes with neither of them (nor White) on the floor. The second-unit backcourt was Marcus Smart and Joe Harris, neither of whom has nearly the same ability to break down a defense as Mitchell or Walker. And with Smart on the floor without Mitchell, Walker or White (over the last two exhibition games), the U.S. scored just 13 points on 18 possessions. The first 2:47 of the second quarter of the U.S. Team\u2019s loss to Australia on Saturday was particularly ugly. The Americans scored just two points on five possessions, with those two points coming when Australia fouled Smart on a late-clock, off-balance 3-pointer. That\u2019s a small sample size and the Smart-led offense could certainly improve going forward, but the U.S. might be better off staggering the minutes of Mitchell and Walker so that one of the two is on the floor at all times. The offense has actually been more efficient with only one *ball-handler on the floor than it has been with two. * Counting Fox, Mitchell, Walker and White as ball-handlers. If Kyle Kuzma didn\u2019t suffer an ankle injury before the loss to Australia, it would have been interesting to see if Popovich and USA Basketball managing director Jerry Colangelo kept all three centers on the roster. Either way, Myles Turner has clearly established himself as the starting center. Turner not only shot 71 percent over the five exhibition games, he grabbed a team-best 12.7 rebounds per 30 minutes, and led the team in both total plus-minus (plus-48) and on-court NetRtg, with the U.S. outscoring its opponents by 27.4 points per 100 possessions in his 83 minutes on the floor. Mason Plumlee has also been an integral part of the rotation. Though Plumlee took just four shots (and two free throws) in 49 total minutes over the five exhibition games, the U.S. scored 122 points per 100 possessions with him on the floor. That was the best on-court OffRtg mark among the players on the final roster. With Turner and Plumlee getting the bulk of the playing time at center, Brook Lopez has played just 17 minutes over the last three games. He averaged 7.9 3-point attempts per 36 minutes with the Bucks last season, but attempted just four 3s in 37 total minutes, and he was the only player on the final roster that had a negative plus-minus (minus-16) over the exhibition slate. The U.S. has also played a little less than 21 minutes with none of the three centers on the floor. In fact, Popovich went small for most of the fourth quarter of his team\u2019s loss to Australia on Saturday. The small-ball defense allowed 13 points on 11 possessions down the stretch in the loss, but has been strong otherwise. Take away that fourth quarter on Saturday and small-ball lineups allowed just 28 points in 34 possessions. Small ball, small sample. While Walker, Mitchell and Turner appear to be sure things to start, the starting forward spots could still be wide open. The U.S. started four different combinations at the three and four in the five exhibition games, with Harrison Barnes and Khris Middleton being the only pair of forwards that started more than one game together. Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum didn\u2019t start any games together, but played more minutes together (40) than any pair of forwards. And, within the group of four forwards, that was Tatum\u2019s most successful pairing. The U.S. outscored its opponents by 20 points per 100 possessions with the two young Celtics on the floor together, but was outscored by 16 per 100 in 49 total minutes with Tatum on the floor with either Barnes or Middleton. Joe Harris also got one start at the three and played 22 minutes total alongside both Walker and Mitchell. Harris was only able to get 10 3-pointers up in his 95 minutes (six of his teammates attempted more 3s per minute), but he rebounded well for his position and the U.S. allowed less than 95 points per 100 possessions with him on the floor. Without great chemistry or the one-on-one stars that can get buckets by themselves, defense is more important than its ever been. While there were some ugly offensive stretches in the loss to Australia, it was on defense where the numbers were far worse than they were in their four exhibition wins. * * * John Schuhmann is a staff writer for NBA.com.

The eight-time All-Star center and 15-year NBA veteran is the Lakers\u2019 improbable choice to fill the sudden roster vacancy created by DeMarcus Cousins\u2019 knee injury. Howard spent one memorable season with the Lakers in 2012-13 after joining the club with Steve Nash in Los Angeles\u2019 high-risk attempt to create an immediate championship contender. While he led the NBA in rebounding and valiantly played through injuries, Howard also clashed with Kobe Bryant and subsequently spurned Los Angeles as a free agent after the Lakers lost in the first round of the playoffs. He bounced to six franchises after his departure, while the Lakers haven\u2019t made the NBA postseason in those ensuing six seasons. Howard has been aggressively booed at Staples Center ever since he took significantly less money than the Lakers offered him and joined the Houston Rockets instead. Howard appeared in nine games last season after joining Washington, but he hasn\u2019t played since November after undergoing spinal surgery. When healthy with the Charlotte Hornets in 2017-18, Howard averaged 16.6 points and 12.5 rebounds per game. The 33-year-old Howard will take over the role expected to be filled by Cousins, who tore his knee ligament shortly after signing with the Lakers last month. Cousins could miss the entire upcoming season, so Howard will team with JaVale McGee and Anthony Davis to play center for Los Angeles. With career averages of 17.4 points, 12.7 rebounds and 2.0 blocked shots per game, Howard is undeniably one of the greatest big men of his generation. But he has been criticized throughout his career for his attitude and locker room presence, and he made few fans in Los Angeles. Howard\u2019s impending return to LA over the past week generated conflicting feelings among Lakers fans online, but Howard clearly persuaded the Lakers he can be a strong supporting player and a good teammate when he worked out for the club. The Lakers had locker room upheaval last season, but it was caused mostly by developments outside the room \u2014 particularly the front office\u2019s ultimately fruitless pursuit of Davis in a midseason trade. LeBron James and Rajon Rondo emerged as leaders in their first season with the club, and they\u2019ll again be in charge of a roster with several major changes. The Lakers waived forward Aric Holman to create a roster spot for Howard. The Athletic\u2019s Shams Charania reports that Howard will wear No. 39 this season. According to Bobby Marks of ESPN, Howard\u2019s contract with the Lakers is unique and will pay him $14,490 for every day he\u2019s on the roster, starting on Oct. 21. * * *"},{"id":32114,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/dwight-howard-signs-lakers-official-release","date":"2019-08-26","title":"Dwight Howard signs with lakers after clearing waivers","content":" El SEGUNDO, Calif. \u2013 The Los Angeles Lakers have signed center Dwight Howard, it was announced today by General Manager Rob Pelinka.

Entering his 16th NBA season, Howard owns career averages of 17.4 points, 12.6 rebounds and 2.0 blocks through 1,044 games (1,043 starts) with Orlando, Houston, Atlanta, Charlotte, Washington and the Lakers. He currently ranks fourth in all-time field goal percentage, converting 58.3 percent of his shots from the field (minimum 2,000 FGM). An eight-time NBA All-Star and the 2004 first overall draft pick, Howard appeared in nine games (all starts) with the Wizards last season, where he averaged 12.8 points and 9.2 rebounds in 25.6 minutes.

Its final exhibition game wrapped up this morning as USA defeated Canada, 84-68 at Qudos Bank Arena in Sydney, Australia. The U.S. team had little problem against Canada on Monday, using strong performances from Jaylen Brown (19 points) and Donovan Mitchell (12 points) to build a 20-9 first-quarter lead and 46-31 advantage by halftime. Mitchell delighted the crowd at Qudos Bank Arena in Sydney, Australia with a buzzer-beating alley-oop slam to close out the first half. * Live box score: USA vs. Canada In the second half, Brown got hot and helped the United States build a sizable lead on Canada with a variety of jump shots and driving dunks. Center Khem Birch and forward Kyle Wiltjer were the bright spots for Canada, with Birch logging 13 points and six rebounds and Wiltjer adding 21 points off the bench. In exhibition play, the USA defeated Spain 90-81 on Aug. 16 in Anaheim, California, and then at Marvel Stadium in Melbourne, beat Australia 102-86 on Aug. 22 before falling to the host team 98-94 on Aug. 24. That last loss was one of the more shocking in recent USA Basketball history as it marked the first time in 13 years the U.S. lost a major international tournament or exhibition game. American basketball fans most likely recognized Canada\u2019s Khem Birch  (Orlando Magic), Oshae Brissett  (Toronto Raptors), Andrew Nembhard  (University of Florida) and Duane Notice  (G-League Raptors 905), because they play in the United States, but the eight other Canadians that rounded out the roster were experienced, international professionals as well.

At the same arena where the Americans won Olympic gold at the Sydney 2000 Games the U.S. never trailed, leading 20-9 after the first quarter and 46-31 at halftime.

The U.S. is missing top NBA players such as LeBron James, James Harden, Paul George and Stephen Curry. It was a dour scoring game after the exciting Saturday result in Melbourne, with both teams committing numerous turnovers Monday. Jaylen Brown had 19 points to lead the Americans, who out-rebounded Canada 55-37. Donovan Mitchell added 12 points and four assists; Kemba Walker scored 12 points and Myles Turner finished with 10 points, 15 rebounds and two blocks.

Andrew Nembhard, who injured his knee last week, and Kaza Kajami-Keane (ankle) both returned for Canada, while Brady Heslip, a late arrival for the Canadians, played his first game in Australia. Canada was missing Oshae Brissett, who sat out with an injury. Perhaps the most entertaining moment of the game came in the final five minutes, with Team USA decidedly in control of the outcome. Fans at Qudos Bank Arena began boisterously chanting \u201cWe want Lopez!\u201d in an effort to get USA reserve center Brook Lopez back into the game. Their pleas eventually worked as USA coach Gregg Popovich had Lopez check back into the game with 1 minute, 13 seconds left. The last time the Americans \u2014 counting major international tournaments and exhibitions with NBA players on the floor \u2014 lost a game was the semifinals of the 2006 world championships. The American program has won gold in every competition since, including three straight in the Olympics and two consecutive World Cup titles. Canada has also been hit hard by missing NBA players, with Miami Heat\u2019s Kelly Olynyk the latest big-name player to pull out after sustaining a knee injury. He joined Andrew Wiggins, Jamal Murray, R.J. Barrett, Tristan Thompson, Dwight Powell, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Chris Boucher and Nickeil Alexander-Walker as other Canadians to miss the World Cup in China. A FIBA World Cup where Serbia has already made very clear it expects to win gold, where reigning Kia MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo will lead Greece, where France figures to have a medal shot and now with the Australians absolutely knowing they can beat the U.S., will begin next week with no shortage of realistic title hopefuls . USA Basketball is No. 1 in FIBA\u2019s world rankings, but so far in the run-up to this World Cup \u2014 with most of the top NBA stars deciding to not play this summer \u2014 the Americans have not looked like a lock for more gold.

The top two teams from each of the four second round groups earn a berth into the quarterfinals on Sept. 10 or 11. Canada: It was the third head-to-head meeting between Canada coach Nick Nurse and U.S. coach Gregg Popovich. They went 1-1 against each other in NBA play last season, Nurse\u2019s Toronto Raptors losing in San Antonio on Jan. 3 but beating Popovich\u2019s Spurs in Canada on Feb. 22. Canada finished 4-3 in its pre-World Cup exhibitions, starting with a split of a two-game series with Nigeria before five games in Australia. USA: The Americans finished their four-game World Cup warm-up tour 3-1 after beating Spain and splitting two games with Australia. The U.S. is planning to stay in Sydney until mid-week, then arrive in Shanghai early Thursday. Indiana center Myles Turner said the loss to Australia will humble the U.S. and serve as a wake-up call. \u201cTeams are looking to beat us, and we understand that now. We just have to bring it every night,\u201d Turner said. Nurse is getting the full tour of the other side of the world this year. The Canadians have been in Australia for a week or so, and now head to China for the World Cup. Then, Nurse will be in Japan when the world champion Raptors (albeit now without NBA Finals MVP Kawhi Leonard) play preseason games against Houston on Oct. 8 and Oct. 10. Popovich was disappointed that Los Angeles Lakers forward Kyle Kuzma\u2019s left ankle injury meant he wouldn\u2019t be able to compete in the World Cup. The Americans sent Kuzma home Saturday with the injury, a move that finalized the 12-man U.S. roster. They were in Australia with 13 finalists for 12 World Cup spots. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge disappointment, because he was a young, energetic guy who was really learning and could play a lot of positions for us,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cHopefully he\u2019ll heal quickly.\u201d Canada: Opens World Cup play Sept. 1 vs. Australia in Dongguan, China.

The game will be broadcast live on NBA TV and on Twitch at twitch.tv\/nba , and content will be available on Twitch to view on-demand. Thus far in exhibition play, the USA defeated Spain 90-81 on Aug. 16 in Anaheim, California, and then at Marvel Stadium in Melbourne, beat Australia 102-86 on Aug. 22 before falling to the host team 98-94 on Aug. 24. \u201cYou got to react to a loss,\u201d said USA head coach Gregg Popovich. \u201cYou react to a win. You can\u2019t take a win for granted. But, I think that it was a great learning situation for us, just about playing FIBA basketball \u2013 the physicality, the rules, how it\u2019s played, how it\u2019s refereed. All those sorts of things. So, it was a great learning experience to have those two games against a very good team.\u201d And while it was the first time Australia ever had beaten the U.S. men, there is no panic from the Americans. \u201cThis is a part of our journey,\u201d said Jaylen Brown. \u201cThis is part of our process as a team. We\u2019re playing for something bigger than ourselves. Having an understanding of that and a humility of that is something we all have to have. I think we could have showed that a little bit better against Australia. We got to do a better job of having the right mentality, whether it\u2019s an early game, whether it\u2019s a back-to-back, whatever it is. We got to come out and be the aggressors, rather than the one being seeked.\u201d Canada is the next team eyeing the USA, and coach Popovich pointed to the team\u2019s speed when asked what he expects in the game. \u201cThey\u2019re really a fast team,\u201d Popovich said of Canada. \u201cMore than anything, they are fast. (Head coach) Nick (Nurse) does a great job with them. They pass the ball. They move. They are hard to keep up with. So, it will be another really good test for us, for sure.\u201d American basketball fans are most likely to recognize Canada\u2019s Khem Birch  (Orlando Magic), Oshae Brissett  (Toronto Raptors), Andrew Nembhard  (University of Florida) and Duane Notice  (G-League Raptors 905), because they play in the United States, but the eight other Canadians that round out the roster are experienced, international professionals as well. \u201cI think when you look at international play, every team, they have been together for a long time, but they kind of have their calling card on what they fall back into \u2013 their system, their sets,\u201d said Harrison Barnes. \u201cFor us, we are still getting to that point. We have some comfortability with it, but just continue to get better at that through film, practice and, obviously, the next exhibition game. I think that will be huge for us.\u201d A USA national squad last faced Canada in an exhibition game prior to the 2008 Beijing Olympic Gamess, a contest the Americans won 120-65 on July 25 in Las Vegas. After a rest day on Aug. 27 and practice on Aug. 28, the USA will depart Sydney for Shanghai, China, where it will first play Czech Republic at 8:30 a.m. EDT on Sept. 1, followed by Turkey at 8:30 a.m. on Sept. 3 and Japan at 8:30 a.m. EDT on Sept. 5. Following three preliminary round games for each team, the top two teams from each group advance to second round groups and will play two more games. The top two teams from each of the four second round groups earn a berth into the quarterfinals on Sept. 10 or 11. \u201cFor us, the main thing we learned is that this is a dogfight,\u201d said Donovan Mitchell  after the USA\u2019s exhibition loss to Australia. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit different than NBA basketball. I think that\u2019s one thing we\u2019re getting used to. These teams have played with each other since they were much younger. We have about three or four weeks under our belt. So, we have to be able to match that chemistry, match that intensity as quickly as we possibly can.\u201d"},{"id":32118,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/fiba-world-cup-international-stars-giannis-jokic-gobert","date":"2019-08-25","title":"International stars set to shine at FIBA Basketball World Cup 2019","content":" The reigning Kia NBA MVP is headed to the basketball World Cup. So are three other members of this past season\u2019s All-NBA squad, and so is the starting center from the team that won the NBA championship a couple months ago. Most of those guys won\u2019t be playing for the United States. The majority of America\u2019s best players are sitting out the World Cup, while many of the best international players are not. Kia NBA MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo of Greece, fellow All-NBA players Nikola Jokic of Serbia and Rudy Gobert of France, and Marc Gasol of Spain \u2014 a significant part of Toronto\u2019s run to the NBA title \u2014 are among the headliners who won\u2019t be in U.S. colors when the tournament starts Saturday in China. \u201cWe\u2019re going to China with the goal of a medal,\u201d Jokic said. The Denver star isn\u2019t just looking for any medal. He\u2019s seeking gold. And the Serbians would seem to have as good a chance as anyone in a tournament that suddenly looks wide open. France and Australia \u2014 which is coming off a 98-94 victory over the United States on Saturday that ended the Americans\u2019 78-game winning streak in international play \u2014 are expected to have five NBA players on their rosters for the World Cup, and Serbia is likely to bring four. In all, more than 60 players with NBA experience are likely to participate in the tournament and only 12 of them are playing for the U.S. \u201cA lot of teams can be in the medal spots and it\u2019s going to be intense, very hard for every team to be in those spots,\u201d said France\u2019s Nicolas Batum \u2014 the only player from the last World Cup All-Tournament team in 2014 who is expected to compete in this year\u2019s event. \u201cBut every team, including ours, is going to fight for it, to play at its best level to try to come back home with a medal.\u201d The only U.S. World Cup player who was an All-NBA pick this past season is Kemba Walker, then of the Charlotte Hornets and now of the Boston Celtics. Look at the NBA stats from last season for World Cup-bound players and the leading scorer, the top three in assists per game and the top seven rebounders all are on international rosters. The world is getting better. That means the U.S. is no lock in this tournament. \u201cThere are a lot of contenders out there,\u201d U.S. coach Gregg Popovich said. The Americans are the only team with a roster composed entirely of NBA players, but that isn\u2019t stopping some from scoffing at the notion that the U.S. is vulnerable heading into this tournament because its World Cup roster doesn\u2019t have anything close to a Dream Team-esque level of star-studded names. Spain coach Sergio Scariolo bluntly dismisses that notion. Scariolo, a Toronto assistant coach when he\u2019s not leading Spain, is quick to point out that a glance at the NBA salaries of the U.S. players dwarfs the combined salaries of every other World Cup roster. When the Americans played Spain in an exhibition earlier this month, the U.S. sent out a starting five that will make roughly $105 million this season. So yes, in terms of earning power, no other team in the world comes close to the roster that the Americans are bringing to China this week. But as evidenced by how Australia battled the U.S. twice in a pair of exhibitions in Melbourne, and beat the Americans there on Saturday, at least some of the world\u2019s best teams aren\u2019t exactly fearful of the two-time defending World Cup champions. \u201cLet\u2019s let them play their basketball and we will play ours,\u201d Serbia coach Sasha Djordjevic now-famously said earlier this month. \u201cAnd if we meet, may God help them.\u201d Clearly, the tournament means quite a bit to Serbia. It means plenty to other nations as well. Antetokounmpo, the Milwaukee star who won NBA MVP this past season, even said earlier this month that he would give back the award if it could be exchanged for a World Cup gold medal for Greece. \u201cI believe him,\u201d U.S. center and Antetokounmpo\u2019s Bucks teammate Brook Lopez said. \u201cThat\u2019s how much he wants this.\u201d > Facts To Know About FIBA World Cup"},{"id":32110,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/team-usa-roster-fiba-announced","date":"2019-08-24","title":"Team USA World Cup roster finalized","content":" SYDNEY \u2014  The 12-man USA Men\u2019s World Cup Team roster was finalized Saturday after it was determined that Kyle Kuzma\u2019s (Los Angeles Lakers) left ankle injury would prevent him from participating in the upcoming competition.

Australia delivered that message to the world on Saturday. For the first time in nearly 13 years, a U.S. roster of NBA players played an international game \u2013 and lost. Patty Mills scored 30 points, and Australia rallied from a 10-point deficit in the second half to stun the Americans 98-94 and snap a 78-game U.S. winning streak that started with the bronze-medal game at the 2006 world championships. \u201cThey wanted it more than us tonight,\u201d U.S. guard Kemba Walker said. \u201cLesson learned for us.\u201d It was the first loss for the U.S. in a major international tournament or exhibition since the 2006 world championship semifinals against Greece. The Americans won the bronze there, then were unbeaten through the cycles for the 2007 FIBA Americas, 2008 Olympics, 2010 World Cup, 2012 Olympics, 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympics. Add all that up, along with wins over Spain and Australia with this team, and it was a 78-game winning streak for the U.S. \u2013 the longest in program history. And it\u2019s now over. \u201cIt was awesome,\u201d Mills said. Australia had never beaten the Americans, and the U.S. national team had been 30-0 all-time in Australia. \u201cSome of it is expected with a new group that\u2019s trying to learn about each other and learn a system,\u201d U.S. coach Gregg Popovich said. \u201cSo it\u2019s not surprising. But the Aussies gave us a great lesson as far as where we want to be and how you have to play in this kind of a competition.\u201d A World Cup where Serbia has already made very clear it expects to win gold, where NBA MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo will lead Greece, where France figures to have a medal shot and now with the Australians absolutely knowing they can beat the U.S., will begin next week with no shortage of realistic title hopefuls. USA Basketball is No. 1 in FIBA\u2019s world rankings, but so far in the run-up to this World Cup \u2013 with most of the top NBA stars deciding to not play this summer \u2013 the Americans have not looked like a lock for more gold. They beat Spain by nine in Anaheim, California on Aug. 16, needed a big second half to defeat Australia by 16 on Thursday, and then let a sizable second-half lead slip away Saturday. \u201cObviously, this was a great step for us,\u201d Australia guard Joe Ingles said. Mills plays for San Antonio, so ordinarily Popovich \u2013 the longtime Spurs coach \u2013 would enjoy seeing what the veteran guard did down the stretch. Mills scored Australia\u2019s last 10 points, doing it all from banking in 3-pointers to slicing through for a layup that put the hosts up by six with 1:50 remaining. \u201cAs I told you all after the last game, Patty\u2019s a pain,\u201d Popovich said. Walker scored 22 points for the U.S., and Harrison Barnes had 20. Donovan Mitchell\u2019s 3-pointer with 1:05 left got the U.S. within 97-94, the Americans forced a stop on the ensuing possession and had two chances to tie \u2013 but Mitchell\u2019s 3-pointer was off, Joe Harris missed a corner 3 a few seconds later and Mills iced the game with a free throw. Aron Baynes left the floor with his head back, screaming in celebration as he slapped hands with delirious countrymen. Ingles and Andrew Bogut grabbed their kids and brought them on the floor for a look. Bogut scored 16 points, Ingles had 15 and Baynes scored 13 for the Australians. Baynes powered in for a score that put Australia up 82-76 with 8:25 remaining, just before Barnes answered with a three-point play for the U.S. to start an 8-0 run that put the Americans back on top. There were four lead changes in the final quarter, the last coming when Ingles made a step-back 3 with 3:35 left for an 88-87 lead. Mills did the rest. He banked in a long 3 for a four-point lead, added a layup to put his country up six with 1:50 left and clinched it with the last free throw. The U.S. led by one at the half and went up 68-58 midway through the third on a dunk by Jayson Tatum, but the Australians got right back into the game. Mills scored eight points in 45 seconds, including a pair of 3-pointers, to get Australia within one with 2:40 left in the third. \u201cThat\u2019s a great team and they\u2019ve been together a long time,\u201d Barnes said. \u201cThey play a great style of basketball.\u201d TIP-INS United States: Barnes, Marcus Smart (who had been out with a calf strain), Khris Middleton, Mitchell and Myles Turner started for the Americans. The U.S. has now used different starting lineups in its three exhibitions, with only Mitchell opening all three contests. In all, the U.S. has given nine different players at least one start on the pre-World Cup tour. \u2026 Kyle Kuzma (left ankle soreness) did not play. Australia: Attendance was 52,079, the biggest crowd to watch a basketball game in Australia \u2013 breaking the record of 51,218 set Thursday. \u2026 The Australians went with the same starters for the second straight game, opening with Ingles, Matthew Dellavedova, Mills, Baynes and Jock Landale. \u2026 Ingles and Mitchell weren\u2019t the only Utah Jazz guards at Marvel Stadium \u2013 Dante Exum was in the stands. SHAKEN UP U.S. guard Derrick White of the San Antonio Spurs was tripped up as he dribbled downcourt midway through the fourth quarter, and hit his forehead on the court.

(AP) \u2014 The Sacramento Kings and the NBA have announced they are taking no action against Luke Walton after not finding enough evidence during an investigation into allegations that the coach sexually assaulted a woman. The team and league began a joint investigation in April following a lawsuit filed in Los Angeles by former sportscaster Kelli Tennant, who \u201celected not to participate in the investigation. Based on this and the available evidence, the investigators determined that there was not a sufficient basis to support the allegations made against coach Walton.\u201d The Kings and NBA said Friday the matter is considered closed barring further evidence emerging. Walton was hired by the Kings on April 13 just one day after being dismissed from his first head coaching job with the Lakers. \u201cLuke Walton is our head coach and we support him and his team as they continue to prepare for the upcoming season,\u201d the Kings said in a statement. Tennant said that Walton attacked her when he was an assistant coach for the Golden State Warriors, which was from 2014 to 2016. The woman said she confided in people at the time but never filed charges because she was scared. Her lawyer, Garo Mardirossian, said because years had passed, he believed it would be difficult now to file a police report and put together a criminal case. Tennant said Walton continued to harass her after he became coach of the Lakers and she was working as a broadcaster in Los Angeles for Spectrum SportsNet and SportsNet LA. \u201cI am 100 percent focused on coaching the Sacramento Kings, and energized to work with this incredible group of players and coaches as we start the preseason,\u201d Walton said in a statement. \u201cI will have no further comment.\u201d The Kings investigatory team was led by Sue Ann Van Dermyden, the founding partner of the Sacramento law firm Van Dermyden Maddux who specializes in employment law. Elizabeth Maringer, senior vice president and assistant general counsel of the NBA, led the league\u2019s investigation.

Maybe that is understandable. He is preparing to step into the point guard position Russell Westbrook held for 11 years for the Oklahoma City Thunder. Gilgeous-Alexander averaged 10.8 points and 3.3 assists as a rookie for the Los Angeles Clippers last season. He joined the Thunder in the deal that sent All-Star Paul George to the Clippers. He has a massive hole to help fill.

I just work hard, keep my head down and be true to who I am.\u201d Gilgeous-Alexander relishes the opportunity to be mentored by Paul, a nine-time All-Star who averaged 15.6 points and 8.2 assists last season. He has worked with Paul since joining the Thunder, but wouldn\u2019t share all that he has learned. \u201cSome of the things I like to keep a secret,\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cI\u2019ve learned a lot from him in terms of thinking the game, angles, things like that. He\u2019s obviously a really good player. He\u2019s been a really good player for a really long time, and a guy that I looked up to growing up. I\u2019ll continue to learn from him as long as I get to.\u201d The Thunder have a slew of draft picks for future years, and Gilgeous-Alexander, just 21, could be a key building block. \u201cI think where Shai is today is not close to where ultimately he\u2019s going to be,\u201d Presti said last month. \u201cBut we have to be really patient with that process. But he\u2019s got great tools, and he\u2019ll have to follow the same track that a lot of these other players have, but we think he has a bright future.\u201d Danilo Gallinari, a key piece who helped the Clippers reach the playoffs last season, also joined the Thunder in the Paul George deal.

The Bob Cousy Award, given to the country\u2019s best point guard in men\u2019s college basketball, is named for him. He is a member of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame and played a pivotal role in founding the NBA Player\u2019s Association. After hanging up his No. 14 jersey, the 13-time NBA All-Star went on to coach basketball at Boston College. \u201cThis acknowledgment allows me to complete my life circle,\u201d Cousy said during the Oval Office awards ceremony. \u201cI can stop chasing a bouncing ball. The Presidential Medal of Freedom allows me to reach a level of acceptance in our society I never once ever dreamed of.\u201d Trump spoke of Cousy\u2019s childhood during the Great Depression and discovering his talent for basketball at a young age.

Joe Manchin for suggesting the medal be given to Cousy. Cousy is the second Medal of Freedom recipient this year. Trump presented the award to golfer Tiger Woods in May. Cousy is the 10th honoree under Trump, who is Cousy\u2019s candidate of choice in the 2020 presidential election. In a recent interview with NBA.com , Cousy described himself as politically moderate.

But once the game started, Popovich thought it all seemed normal. And if it had been a movie, Popovich surely would have liked the ending. Kemba Walker scored 23 points, Myles Turner added 15 points and 14 rebounds, and the U.S. topped Australia 102-86 on Thursday before a crowd of 51,218 \u2014 billed as the largest crowd ever to watch a basketball game in Australia. \u201cWe have guys that are just starting to play with each other,\u201d said U.S. guard Donovan Mitchell, who had 13 points. \u201cWe got off to a little bit of a rough start in the first half, but the third quarter, we really picked it up defensively.\u201d * Box score: USA vs. Australia Patty Mills and Chris Goulding scored 19 points each for Australia, which stayed with the Americans for about 2\u00bd quarters before seeing chances slip away at Marvel Stadium \u2014 transformed into a make-shift basketball arena for two games against the Americans, tune-ups for both sides before the World Cup starts next week in China. \u201cIt was an awesome opportunity,\u201d Mills said. \u201cI think basketball in this country has been waiting for something like this.\u201d After Australia briefly took the lead at 45-44 early in the second half, the Americans scored 13 unanswered points, including three straight 3-pointers by Turner, Harrison Barnes and Mitchell, to go up 57-45. Walker was one the keys for the second-half resurgence for the Americans, scoring 21 of his 23 points after halftime. \u201cI\u2019m one of the leaders of this team, so it\u2019s important for me to set that tone,\u201d the Celtics guard said. The roof of Marvel Stadium was closed and the court was placed in the middle of the field surrounded by hundreds of white chairs, more than 20 rows deep, for fans who paid for floor seating. Despite the huge crowd, Australian media reported that some fans were issued refunds because they bought tickets based on promotional materials depicting Stephen Curry and LeBron James \u2014 who were part of the U.S. player pool when the deal was struck last year to play these games. Neither Curry nor James is on the U.S. roster for the World Cup. Australia was also without its biggest star, Ben Simmons, who has opted not to play in the World Cup. Still, the Boomers starting lineup included four NBA players: Mills, Aron Baynes, Joe Ingles and Matthew Dellavedova. And the Aussies gave their crowd some thrills \u2014 like a run just before halftime that cut the U.S. lead to 44-43 after back-to-back 3-pointers by Goulding and six straight points by Mills. The win was the 78th in a row in major international exhibitions and competition for the U.S. national team, a streak that started with the bronze medal game of the 2006 world championships. It encompasses gold-medal runs at the 2010 and 2014 World Cups, the Olympics in 2008, 2012 and 2016, and the FIBA Americas tournament in 2007. TIP-INS USA: Mitchell wrote \u201cEnd Gun Violence\u201d on his shoes before the game to remember the victims of the El Paso and Dayton mass shootings \u2026 Boston\u2019s Marcus Smart, who is still working his way back from a calf injury that popped up about two weeks ago during training camp in Las Vegas, did not play. \u2026 It was the first meeting between the national teams since the Americans won 98-88 at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics on their way to a gold medal. Australia: Actor Russell Crowe, who spends most of his time living in Australia, was part of the massive crowd. \u2026 In a sight that NBA fans are used to, Dellavedova dived on the floor for loose balls three times in the game\u2019s first three minutes \u2014 including on the opening tap. \u2026 Mills gave Popovich, his longtime coach in San Antonio, a massive hug courtside just before the game started.

But Walker, who last month joined Boston after eight seasons in Charlotte, said criticism of the U.S. team was spurring them on ahead of its title defense in China. \u201cWe don\u2019t care \u2014 we want to be here and are putting in the time to be here and we definitely take that as motivation,\u201d Walker said Wednesday. \u201cWe have a bunch of guys who don\u2019t mind being the underdogs.

Per ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski and the Los Angeles Times Tania Ganguli, the Lakers are planning individual workouts with centers Dwight Howard, Joakim Noah and Marreese Speights. Additionally, Wojnarowski reports the Lakers may also consider a workout with Marcin Gortat. Howard is currently under contract with the Memphis Grizzlies, but the team would gladly work on a buyout with him, Wojnarowski reports. Cousins suffered a torn ACL last week and is out indefinitely , which leaves the Lakers with Anthony Davis, JaVale McGee and LeBron James as the top frontcourt players in the rotation. The injury will almost certainly force Cousins to miss much \u2014 if not all \u2014 of the coming season. And his run of amazingly bad luck, costing him a lot of games and an enormous amount of money, would continue as well. Shams Charania of The Athletic reported on Sunday that the Lakers were expected to request permission to speak with Howard and that Noah was also on the Lakers\u2019 radar as well. Howard, 33, played in only nine games this past season with the Wizards due to a back injury which required surgery. He averaged 12.8 points and 9.2 rebounds while shooting 62.3 percent from the field. Should he land with the Lakers, this would mark Howard\u2019s second stint with the team. He played for them in the 2012-13 season via a blockbuster trade that moved him from the Orlando Magic. Howard posted solid overall numbers (17.1 ppg, 12.4 rpg, 1.4 apg, 2.4 bpg), but clashed at times with Lakers star Kobe Bryant. In the summer of 2013, Howard opted to sign with the Houston Rockets , beginning a run of seemingly regular team changes for Howard. Since the 2013-14 season, Howard has played for the Rockets (2013-16), Atlanta Hawks (2016-17), Charlotte Hornets (2017-18), Wizards (last season) and is currently with Memphis. Noah spent 42 games with Memphis last season, averaging 7.1 ppg, 5.7 rpg and 2.1 apg in 16.5 mpg as a reserve for the Grizzlies. He was signed by the team in early December after the New York Knicks cut him last October . During Knicks training camp, Noah had been away from the team since clashing with former coach Jeff Hornacek in 2017-18, when he appeared in just seven games. He was a valuable veteran presence for the Grizzlies last season and showed he can still provide solid off-the-bench minutes in the NBA. Speights was a key reserve player on the Golden State Warriors\u2019 championship team in 2015. He spent 10 seasons in the NBA, but was not in the league last season as he opted to play for the Guangzhou Long-Lions in China . In his last NBA season \u2014 the 2017-18 campaign \u2014 Speights averaged 7.7 ppg and 2.6 rpg for the Orlando Magic. Gortat was a former teammate of Howard\u2019s in Orlando from 2007-10 and spent part of last season with the LA Clippers. He averaged 5 ppg, 5.6 rpg and 1.4 apg in 47 games for the Clippers, but was waived by the team in early February. He has career averages of 9.9 ppg, 8 rpg and 1.1 bpg in 25.7 mpg in 12 seasons with the Magic, Wizards, Clippers and Phoenix Suns.

The shorts feature the classic Hornets logo on the waist and the same white, purple and teal trim as the original.  The original purple uniform was worn during some of the most memorable seasons in franchise history. In 1994-95, the Hornets won 50 games for the first time and had two All-Stars in the same season for the only time ever with Larry Johnson and Alonzo Mourning. Two years later, the 1996-97 Hornets had the best season in team history, going 54-28 as Glen Rice set a multitude of franchise single-season records. Along with being named MVP of the NBA All-Star Game, Rice (Second Team) and Anthony Mason (Third Team) gave the Hornets multiple All-NBA selections in a season for the only time. Like the rest of the team\u2019s uniforms, the purple Classic Edition features the logos of Nike\u2019s Jordan Brand on the right chest and partner LendingTree on the left chest. The Official Loan Shopping Partner of the Charlotte Hornets, LendingTree will have its logo on each of the team\u2019s jerseys for the third consecutive season. As part of a robust sponsorship package, the company is also the entitlement partner for the Hornets App and the Hornets Hoops youth basketball program.

So instead of two players being cut from the roster after Friday night\u2019s 90-81 exhibition win over Spain, Popovich said the entire group will move onto the games Down Under next week, which gives the new staff a little extra time to evaluate and the players more time to make their own cases for inclusion. \u201cIt was a good chance to jump in the fray and see what this is all about for us,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cIt was like a baptism for us with a new group, players, coaches and all that stuff, a real experience.\u201d Judging by the energy exhibited Friday night, it\u2019s obvious this is an experience none of the players still working want to miss out on. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be tough,\u201d Donovan Mitchell said after leading the U.S. with 13 points in the win. \u201cWe have guys who have become very close in these two weeks [of training camp] and that\u2019s a testament to Coach Pop and Mr. Colangelo for picking guys who were really willing to do this for one another and then on top of that, being ready and willing to compete.\u201d Khris Middleton is glad to see the entire group heading to the next phase. \u201cIt just means guys are doing their jobs and we\u2019re making it as tough as it can be,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s been that way all camp, guys are doing whatever it takes and giving their bodies. And that\u2019s a huge thing for everybody.\u201d It\u2019s also a healthy \u201cproblem\u201d the competition would love to have. Spanish coach Sergio Scariolo acknowledged after Friday night\u2019s game that this U.S. team remains the standard bearer for the rest of the world and is the measuring stick, physically, athletically and otherwise, for the entire field in China. \u201cOf course, they are the best team in the competition and the best team in the world,\u201d Scariolo said, \u201cbut I think we competed. We did a pretty good job. And we have some things to build off of.\u201d  Popovich is looking for some of the same things but doesn\u2019t have the years of data and previous results of his group working together at his disposal, not when the roster changes shape as much as the U.S. Team\u2019s has this summer. The defections from big-name players started rolling in early and has continued right through the two weeks of camp. Toss in injuries, like the ankle issues that forced P.J. Tucker, the oldest and most experienced player in camp, to be ruled out for China before Friday\u2019s game, and it\u2019s no wonder Popovich is opting for more time to study his options. What the U.S. team lacks in chemistry and familiarity with one another it makes up for with elite-level talent and quality depth, to go along with superior athleticism and in some case, individual breathtaking abilities. Popovich praised the Spaniards\u2019 \u201castounding\u201d array of offensive sets, no doubt the product of familiarity, but also praised his own team\u2019s collective rebounding effort and defensive intensity as two of the main reasons they were able to survive after piling up a mind-boggling 27 turnovers. \u201cThe way they execute, the way they read each other,\u201d Popovich said, \u201cwe hope to get to something like that offensively. It\u2019s going to be difficult in this short time. But it was a great example for us to see that. I was most pleased with us defensively. I thought we did a good job for a new group, communicating with each other and we rebounded well. And we haven\u2019t done that to date consistently. And I thought we had good effort from everybody on the boards tonight.\u201d The key word, of course being \u201ceverybody,\u201d which is how the U.S. team will proceed until further notice. * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

Donovan Mitchell led all U.S. scorers with 13 points, and Kemba Walker added 11 points, six rebounds and eight assists.

In 17 seasons in San Antonio, Parker helped the Silver and Black capture four NBA championships and was named the 2007 NBA Finals MVP, becoming the first European Finals MVP in history. The point guard from France was a four-time All-NBA performer (2009, 2012, 2013, 2014) and a six-time NBA All-Star (2006, 2007, 2009, 2012, 2013, 2014) with the Spurs.

Parker finished his career seventh in NBA history with 892 wins. Appearing in a total of 226 postseason contests with the Spurs, sixth most all-time, Parker averaged 17.9 points, 5.1 assists and 2.9 rebounds in 34.3 minutes. In NBA Playoffs history, Parker ranks fifth all-time in assists (1,143) and ninth in points (4,045). Parker and fellow Spurs jersey retirees Tim Duncan and Manu Ginobili recorded 126 postseason victories together, which are the most wins by any trio in NBA history.

Now, Tsai is taking full control of the team. The team confirmed Friday that Prokhorov is selling his controlling interest in the team as well as in the Nets\u2019 arena, Barclays Center, to Tsai in a deal. Per the Nets, the transaction is expected to take place by the end of September and requires approval by the NBA\u2019s Board of Governors.  In the interim, the Nets\u2019 current management team will continue to run Barclays Center and the team under new ownership. CEO of BSE Global Brett Yomark will oversee the transition to new ownership and then will depart from his role after that. Josh Kosman and Brian Lewis of the New York Post reported earlier this week Tsai was closing in on a deal to buy the remaining shares of the team from Prokhorov. News of the pending agreement was also reported by Tim Bontemps of ESPN . The deal is expected to cost $2.35 billion and would mark the highest amount ever paid for a sports franchise. Last year, hedge fund owner David Tepper paid $2.2 billion to buy the NFL\u2019s Carolina Panthers and in 2017, Tillman Fertitta paid $2.2 billion to buy the NBA\u2019s Houston Rockets. In a statement released by the team Friday, Prokhorov said : \u201cIt has been an honor and a joy to open Barclays Center, bring the Nets to Brooklyn, and watch them grow strong roots in the community while cultivating global appeal. The team is in a better place today than ever before and I know that Joe will build on that success, while continuing to deliver the guest experience at Barclays Center that our fans, employees, and colleagues in the industry enjoy. Without Brett\u2019s innovative foresight and leadership, we would not be where we are today with the Nets and Barclays Center.\u201d Tsai, the co-founder of the China-based global internet company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., paid $1 billion for his 49% share last April. The deal allowed Tsai to acquire further shares of the team before the start of the 2021-22 season for an additional $1.35 billion. If Tsai signs off on the deal, he will be exercising his right to buy out Prokhorov two seasons early. Per Forbes, Tsai\u2019s estimated net worth is $9.3 billion . Prokhorov bought the Nets in 2010 and the Russian oversaw the Nets\u2019 move from New Jersey to Brooklyn. The sale of shares to Tsai in 2018 did not include the Barclays Center, which Prokhorov\u2019s company will continue to own. However, the Post reported in March that Tsai was in talks to buy Barclays as well as the new Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale, N.Y. The Post reports that the NBA pushes its owners to also own their arenas, which is one of the reasons Tsai will also be acquiring the Barclays Center at some point. This summer has been a massive one for the Nets, as they reeled two of the biggest names in free agency : forward Kevin Durant and guard Kyrie Irving. Those additions \u2014 plus other offseason moves by Brooklyn to shore up its depth \u2014 have the Nets looking like a favorite to rise quickly in the Eastern Conference. That comes after a 42-40 season and playoff appearance in 2018-19 that confounded most experts."},{"id":32193,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-spurs-retire-tony-parker-jersey","date":"2019-08-16","title":"Report: Spurs to retire Tony Parker's jersey next season","content":" Another member of San Antonio\u2019s \u201cBig Three\u201d is reportedly headed for franchise immortality.

The Spurs have yet to make an official announcement about the retirement of Parker\u2019s jersey, but the Nov. 11 game vs. the Memphis Grizzlies ( 8:30 ET, NBA League Pass ) would mark the end of a three-game homestand for San Antonio. Parker retired from the NBA shortly after the season ended , telling Marc J. Spears of The Undefeated : \u201cA lot of different stuff ultimately led me to this decision. But, at the end of the day, I was like, if I can\u2019t be Tony Parker anymore and I can\u2019t play for a championship, I don\u2019t want to play basketball anymore.\u201d Once his number is retired, Parker will be 10th player in team history to have earned that honor, joining Bruce Bowen (No. 12), Duncan, Sean Elliott (No. 32), George Gervin (No. 44), Ginobili, Avery Johnson (No. 6), Johnny Moore (No. 00), David Robinson (No. 50) and James Silas (No. 13).

News of the injury was first reported by ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski. The big man suffered the injury while working out in Las Vegas on Monday. According to Wojnarowski and Shams Charania of The Athletic, Cousins was scheduled for additional tests on his knee today to diagnose the injury. The tests revealed a torn ACL, which will sideline Cousins indefinitely. According to Wojnarowski , Cousins suffered the injury after \u201cbumping knees\u201d with another player. Teammate Kyle Kuzma, who is working out with Team USA during its practices in Los Angeles, shared his thoughts on Cousins\u2019 injury after Thursday\u2019s practice. \u201cIt\u2019s no joke when you get injured,\u201d Kuzma said. \u201cThis is our livelihood and it\u2019s something that we love to do. It\u2019s super unfortunate for a guy like DeMarcus because you can just tell how much he loves basketball through all of these injuries \u2026 he\u2019s fought back and tried to get back as early as possible. That\u2019s kind of how the ball goes sometimes \u2026 he was going to be a big part of what we\u2019re going to do.\u201d The injury will almost certainly force Cousins to miss much \u2014 if not all \u2014 of the coming season. And his run of amazingly bad luck, costing him a lot of games and an enormous amount of money, would continue as well. He tore his Achilles in February 2018, a few months before he could have commanded a massive contract in free agency. He wound up signing with Golden State for the relatively low price of $5.3 million, sat out much of last season while rehabbing the Achilles, and then was sidelined again for much of the Warriors\u2019 playoff run after tearing a quad muscle. \u201cI\u2019ve told y\u2019all before I don\u2019t take any of this for granted,\u201d Cousins said in June, during the NBA Finals where he and the Warriors lost in six games to the Toronto Raptors. \u201cI\u2019ve seen how quick this game can be taken away from you. So every chance I get to go out there and play, I\u2019m going to leave it on the floor.\u201d Cousins returned to free agency this summer and settled for a $3.5 million, one-year deal with the Lakers \u2014 again, a bargain deal for someone with a resume like the one Cousins possesses. He was expected to be part of the Lakers\u2019 rotation, one that still has LeBron James plus added Anthony Davis and Danny Green this summer as part of a massive roster overhaul. Davis and Cousins were teammates in New Orleans. Cousins has averaged 21.2 points and 10.9 rebounds over parts of nine NBA seasons with Sacramento, New Orleans and Golden State. Cousins is one of only 11 players in NBA history to average that many points and rebounds per game in a career, a list that includes two other active players \u2014 Minnesota\u2019s Karl-Anthony Towns and Philadelphia\u2019s Joel Embiid. * * * Information from the Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":32236,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/team-usa-notebook-cousins-news-hits-hard","date":"2019-08-16","title":"Team USA Notebook: Players bemoan Cousins' injury; decision time looms for roster","content":" EL SEGUNDO, Calif. \u2014 The news that Los Angeles Lakers center DeMarcus Cousins will miss a significant portion of a third straight season with yet another severe injury hit the U.S. Men\u2019s Senior National Team training camp hard. Cousins is a member of the program. He won gold at the 2014 FIBA World Cup in Spain and at the 2016 Olympics in Rio. And with camp wrapping up Thursday afternoon at the Lakers\u2019 practice facility at the UCLA Health and Training Center, it was the topic all over the gym. Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr, an assistant to Gregg Popovich this summer, said the entire NBA community was deflated by the revelation that Cousins tore his left ACL, knowing all that he\u2019s already been through. \u201cI\u2019m devastated for DeMarcus,\u201d said Kerr, who coached Cousins last season with the Warriors. \u201cI read about it on the way to practice and it\u2019s been a couple years of hell for DeMarcus with the injury \u2014 first the Achilles and then last year in the playoffs with the quad. \u201c I was really hoping that this year for him upcoming with the Lakers would be a year for him to get healthy, get his rhythm and conditioning and really start his comeback, so we\u2019re all crushed for him. All these guys in this gym, fellow players and coaches. You know, this is a small community and everybody\u2019s been talking about it. We\u2019ve all reached out to him and you just feel terrible for him.\u201d Cousins played a big role in the two games the Warriors won in The Finals, something Kerr said he thought about as he processed the news that Cousins will be dealing with another arduous recovery.  \u201cThe two games that we won, it\u2019s no coincidence that DeMarcus played well,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cBoth of those games he helped us immeasurably, knocking down shots and scoring inside and rebounding. The tough part for DeMarcus and us is that he had just missed five weeks, so there was no way he was going to have the consistency over a five- to seven-game series. \u201cHe just didn\u2019t have his conditioning and rhythm. He gave us a lift in spots and gave us a hell of an effort but between the injury to Kevin [Durant] and Klay [Thompson], DeMarcus just didn\u2019t have enough. But he gave everything he had.\u201d P.J. Tucker has battled Cousins on the floor with the Houston Rockets and was looking forward to resuming those battles this season. Now he\u2019s flattened by the reality of what Cousins is dealing with. \u201cIt hurts my heart, man, because DeMarcus is such a good guy,\u201d Tucker said. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the best bigs I\u2019ve ever played against, ever. He\u2019s amazing. And to see somebody like that get hurt, fight come back and lose weight and do all that stuff and then get hurt again \u2026 man, it\u2019s heartbreaking obviously.\u201d Cousins signed a one-year deal with the Lakers last month and was slated to move into a starting lineup alongside LeBron James and Anthony Davis for a team expected to contend for a championship this season. It was supposed to be the next step in the reclamation process for the former All-NBA big man who played 30 regular season games for the Warriors last season while fighting his way back from an Achilles injury suffered two season ago alongside Davis when they both starred for the New Orleans Pelicans. Cousins appeared to be in some of the best shape of his career this summer, showing off his slim and trim physique while working out in preparation for the Lakers\u2019 upcoming campaign. Now he\u2019s facing another surgery and grueling rehabilitation process before he can resume his playing career. \u201cInjuries are a part of the game,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cBut when you\u2019re talking about a player who has dealt with the two most feared injuries for NBA players, the Achilles and the ACL, each basically knocking you out for an entire season, to deal with that over a two and half, three-year span is unheard of. \u201cSo I don\u2019t know, what a blow for him and the Lakers \u2026 He\u2019s going to have to process it all and start all over again. Not a whole lot to say other than to offer everybody\u2019s sympathy and hopefully, he can get back on the bike and start riding again nine months from now or whenever it is he gets back.\u201d http:\/\/decision http:\/\/decision http:\/\/decision Popovich is not looking forward to the roster decisions that have to be made after Friday night\u2019s exhibition game against Spain (NBA TV, 10 ET). The roster needs to be trimmed from 15 players to 12 as the group departs for Australia on Saturday. The competition was extremely tight throughout camp and with versatility at a premium, Popovich knows that a case could be made for every player who has participated in the process.  It\u2019s a part of the job that never gets any easier, Popovich said. \u201cEven when you cut people from your regular NBA team, it\u2019s difficult,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to do that [here] and it\u2019s going to be even more so, and I\u2019m dreading having to do that. But it\u2019s got to get done.\u201d Popovich has been on both sides of the process with an international team. He was one of 66 players who tried out for the 1972 Olympic team when the trials were held at his alma mater, the Air Force Academy. It was a team Popovich, and plenty of others, thought he should have been on. But he was cut. \u201cI got screwed,\u201d Popovich said, the topic striking an obvious nerve all these years later. \u201cI was devastated when I didn\u2019t make it, as anybody would be.\u201d Popovich was put on an alternate team that he said went on a tour to Brazil and Argentina and partied \u201ctheir [expletive] off.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t even know, we probably lost every game,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the truth. But I was young and foolish and it wasn\u2019t the real team and we were down there for kicks or whatever. And we did that.\u201d Back then a committee decided who made the team, a much more political process than what happens today. But the memories of that time, and particularly the infamous Gold medal game when the U.S. Team lost in a hugely controversial finish to the Soviet Union team, will never fade. \u201cIn addition to the ridiculous situation at the end of that game, I\u2019ll always remember Doug Collins,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cThe two most pressurized and important free throws I\u2019ve ever seen anybody shoot, and I don\u2019t care about NBA championships or anything else. To have to make those two free throws that he made, at his age, just incredible. It still gives me goose bumps every time I think about him having to have the courage to step up and do that. That\u2019s the big thing for me.\u201d http:\/\/draft De\u2019Aaron Fox said he takes pride in being one several members of the NBA\u2019s 2017 Draft class on display this summer on both the Senior Team and the Select Team that has worked out with and against the squad that will represent the program in China. \u201cI think it\u2019s great to have guys you come into the league with here as well,\u201d Fox said. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely something you\u2019ll talk about years now down the road. And I think it says the league is in good hands with so many hard-working guys here, not to mention other talented guys who could be here as well. It just speaks to how competitive the league is and how young it is right now.\u201d Fox, Jayson Tatum, Donovan Mitchell, Kyle Kuzma and Derrick White have all made it to the final phase of the selection process. They\u2019re all packed for China, though it won\u2019t be known until Friday night\u2019s game if they all will make the trip.  Either way, Tucker said, you can\u2019t help but he impressed with the array of young talent that has been on display. \u201cHonestly, all of these guys are better than I realized,\u201d Tucker said. \u201cPlaying against people twice a year or whatever is one thing. But when you get here and you\u2019re working out together every day and you see these guys work, all of these young guys. De\u2019Aaron Fox is amazing. He\u2019s way better than I thought he was, and not saying that I didn\u2019t think he was good. But he\u2019s really, really good. \u201cAnd I play Donovan all the time in Utah and I know he\u2019s really good. But out here he\u2019s been great. Jayson Tatum is great. All these guys, top to bottom, are really, really good, and they\u2019re going to be great in their individual careers.\u201d The big winner in a FIBA summer, according to Popovich, are the teams these players \u2014 and players from every country competing \u2014 go back to after the competition is over. It\u2019s a shot of energy to the global basketball ecosystem, he said, that certainly works for the NBA. \u201cBasketball has become so international, with so many great players everywhere, and everyone benefits,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cWhen they get back to their NBA teams, most everybody is probably a better player. They\u2019ve had more experiences and all the competitiveness they had to exhibit in the tournament carries over.\u201d * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

Aside from that, center DeMarcus Cousins (signed with Los Angeles Lakers), forward Andre Iguodala (traded to Memphis) and guard Shaun Livingston (waived) are no longer with the team. Despite all those changes, though, Warriors forward still sees his group as a playoff team. To him, any notion that Golden State will be anything less than that come 2019-20 is sheer crazy talk. \u201cI\u2019ve heard people say we\u2019re not gonna make the playoffs. That\u2019s crazy to me,\u201d Green said in an interview with Rachel Nichols on ESPN\u2019s \u201cThe Jump\u201d on Wednesday. \u201cI mean, that\u2019s just, like, that\u2019s total disrespect, but no different than the disrespect we\u2019ve all been getting for years.\u201d Las Vegas oddsmakers still have Golden State slated as a favorite to make the playoffs, but their odds to do so are decidedly lower than they were last year. To Green, that kind of doubt of his team is a fuel of sorts. \u201cI like it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, being the underdog. It\u2019s been a while since we been the underdog. But it brings that underdog chip back, and I miss that chip. I\u2019m pretty sure Steph [Curry] missed that chip, and some of the stuff Klay [Thompson] been texting me this summer, I\u2019m positive he misses the chip. \u201c\u2026 So to the oddsmakers, thanks. You got me where I am today. I look forward to where they take me again.\u201d Over the summer, the Warriors made sure Green did not leave for another team come next summer by inking him to a four-year extension worth nearly $100 million. Thompson signed a five-year, $190 million extension with the Warriors last month, and Stephen Curry is under contract through the 2021-22 season, so three major pieces of the Warriors\u2019 half-decade of success are now locked up for at least three more years. \u201cI think everybody thinks it\u2019s kind of the end of us,\u201d Green said in June, after the Warriors lost a six-game series to Toronto in the NBA Finals and saw their run of two straight titles come to an end. \u201cBut that\u2019s just not smart. We\u2019re not done yet. \u2026 But, yeah, I hear a lot of that noise, `It\u2019s the end of a run\u2019 and all that jazz. I don\u2019t see it happening though. We\u2019ll be back.\u201d The Warriors added All-Star guard D\u2019Angelo Russell this summer, while losing the two-time NBA Finals MVP Durant to Brooklyn as well as parting way with Iguodala, Cousins and Livingston. So in many ways it will be a different Golden State team this coming season, when the five-time defending Western Conference champion begins playing its home games in the new Chase Center in San Francisco after moving from Oakland\u2019s Oracle Arena. \u201cOur core \u2013 myself, Klay, Draymond, adding D\u2019Angelo and a lot of hungry, young guys trying to prove themselves in the league \u2013 it will look different in terms of the lineups and things like that,\u201d Curry said last month. \u201cBut the expectations of how we play and that championship-caliber basketball, that\u2019s going to be for us always be the motivation and the challenge.\u201d Over the past five seasons, the Warriors have won 77% of their games, including playoffs \u2013 a total of 399 wins, 100 more than any other NBA team in that span. Green has been an enormous part of that success. He is one of the league\u2019s elite defenders, a five-time All-NBA defensive team selection and the defensive player of the year in the 2016-17 season. Green, Curry and Thompson are the lone remaining Warriors players to have been on each of their last three NBA championship teams, in 2015, 2017 and 2018. Green averaged 7.4 points, 7.3 rebounds and 6.9 assists per game last season. Only four other NBA players \u2013 LeBron James, Ben Simmons, Nikola Jokic and Russell Westbrook \u2013 averaged at least that much in all of those stat categories.

The Select Team, a team including G League players that helped the U.S. qualify for the World Cup coached by Jeff Van Gundy, proved to be the sharper and more energized group. They reminded everyone in the building that the margin of error for the bunch headed to China is razor thin without the usual assortment of superstars in the mix this summer. Wednesday\u2019s work was a good lesson, according to USA Basketball Managing Director Jerry Colangelo. The Select Team is brought in to compete at the highest level, to prepare the Senior Team in the best way possible. After a strong start to camp in Las Vegas last week, including a big win by the Senior Team on Friday night, and Tuesday night\u2019s late workout, Colangelo said there was some noticeable fatigue during Wednesday\u2019s workout. But he was quick to praise the Select Team for handling their business the way they did. \u201cLook, there\u2019s not much difference between a lot of guys,\u201d Colangelo said. \u201cA good example is what you saw today. You saw some G League players play just now, and play very well. There wasn\u2019t much of a difference, okay.\u201d While many of the most high-profile players invited to training camp this summer weighed the pros and cons of participation, the league\u2019s reigning 3-point Contest champion didn\u2019t wrestle with his decision. Brooklyn Nets swingman Joe Harris was all in from the start. There were far more pros that cons, in his mind. But he did reach out to Nets coach Kenny Atkinson for advice on what to do and got an enthusiastic push to dive in without hesitation.  \u201cHis whole thing was \u2018I want you to be a sponge,\u2019\u201d Harris said. \u201cHe just reminded me that I was going to be with [U.S. coach Gregg Popovich] and his staff, [Golden State Warriors coach] Steve Kerr and [Atlanta Hawks coach] Lloyd [Pierce], [Villanova coach] Jay Wright. He said to ask as many questions as you can and it\u2019ll be great for you and great for us. And selfishly and individually, I\u2019d be able to pick up on a lot of different things and just learn as much as you can from all the knowledge in this gym\u201d. Atkinson was on hand for Wednesday\u2019s workout and confirmed that he encouraged Harris to make sure he was a part of the process, for all those reasons and more. \u201cMy theory is that guys get better playing FIBA,\u201d Atkinson said. \u201cIt\u2019s a different style and you have to adapt and get out of your comfort zone. So yeah, when he asked me what do you think? And I knew deep down he wanted to play, I said you\u2019ve got to go. And where Joe has come from, right, basically out of the game to potentially earning a spot on the U.S. National Team, that\u2019s just incredible. But he\u2019s a baller man. He loves the game.\u201d Given his extensive history with the San Antonio Spurs\u2019 longtime Western Conference rival Los Angeles Lakers, it might seem odd to some to see Popovich running his team through workouts at the Lakers\u2019 practice facility. Just don\u2019t count Popovich among the group. He has no issues working deep in the heart of Lakers country. \u201cIt\u2019s basketball and a gym with rims,\u201d Popovich said when asked if there was anything strange about his current predicament. * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

The NBA superstar is spending more than $1 million on various upgrades for the school. James and his high school buddies played a few of the kids in a quick game, and the four-time MVP dunked to break in one of the hoops.
