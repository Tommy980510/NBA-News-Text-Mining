Now, it\u2019s etched forever in the franchise\u2019s record books as well. The veteran big man amassed an all-time team record 30 rebounds in the Blazers\u2019 118-103 win over Detroit on Saturday, besting the previous mark of 27 rebounds set by Sidney Wicks in 1975. The effort is also a personal best for Kanter, who is averaging 12.0 rebounds \u2014 fourth-most in the league \u2014 in just 26.7 minutes per game this season. With his 24 points, Kanter also becomes just the third player in the last 20 years to register a 20-point, 30-rebound performance. The others were Dwight Howard with the Charlotte Hornets in 2018 and Kevin Love with the Minnesota Timberwolves in 2010. Kanter battled for 12 of his 30 rebounds on the offensive glass, where he ranks second in the league in offensive boards per contest. The third overall pick of the 2011 Draft, Kanter has helped Portland survive a multitude of injuries this season and stay well within the Western Conference playoff race . Saturday\u2019s victory pulled the Blazers to within 1.5 games of the fifth-place Los Angeles Lakers. The top six teams in each conference automatically qualify for the postseason, while teams placed seventh through 10th will participate in the Play-In Tournament to determine the final two playoff spots in each conference."},{"id":529918,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/warriors-rookie-wiseman-exits-early-vs-rockets-with-knee-injury","date":"2021-04-11","title":"Warriors rookie Wiseman exits early vs. Rockets with knee injury","content":"Warriors rookie James Wiseman injured his right knee landing after a transition layup attempt in the second quarter Saturday against the Rockets, and will not return.

This kid is still just 22 years old and has been showing why he was the top pick in the Draft two years ago. He\u2019s scored at least 31 FanDuel points in nine of his last 11 games while generating a 37-point average in that stretch. We love that against a Wizards team that ranks last in points allowed while playing at the fastest pace in the league. Dennis Schroder (LAL) $7,000: Dennis the Menace has been given a tough duty to run this Lakers offense, but he\u2019s doing a fine job. Since Anthony Davis and LeBron James went down, Schroder has at least 34 FD points in seven of his last nine games while averaging over 36 fantasy points per game in that span. Brooklyn is not a scary matchup either, sitting 25th in defensive efficiency. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope (LAL) $5,800: The Lakers need somebody to step up with all of these guys out, and KCP has been doing all he can. Over his last four games, Caldwell-Pope is averaging 28 FD points in 34 minutes a night. That minute total is all you can ask for from such an affordable player, and we certainly don\u2019t mind the matchup we just discussed. Malachi Flynn (TOR) $6,000: Toronto has had some injury issues of its own, playing without Kyle Lowry and Fred VanVleet. That leaves Flynn as the primary ball-handler, scoring at least 29 FD points in four straight fixtures while providing a 36-point average in that stretch. That shouldn\u2019t be hard to duplicate against a Cleveland team with a bottom-five defense since the opening month. Dwight Howard (PHI) $4,300: We\u2019re going to take an educated guess and say that Joel Embiid is rested here. If that\u2019s the case, Howard is an incredible value. In the 18 games that Joel has missed this season, Howard is averaging nearly 30 FD points per game. That\u2019s a stupendous total from such a cheap player, and he certainly shouldn\u2019t have any issues exploiting this G League Thunder roster, even if he gets limited minutes. Kenrich Williams (OKC) $6,100: We just made fun of this OKC roster, but it has allowed Williams to have a huge role. The Thunder are currently without Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Al Horford, Darius Bazley and Isaiah Roby, leaving Kenrich to feast. In the last two games without those guys, he\u2019s combined for 18 points, 16 rebounds, 18 assists, and five steals. Chris Boucher (TOR) $6,500: We already mentioned how Toronto is missing their two primary ball-handlers, and it\u2019s done big things for Boucher as well. Not only has it forced him into the starting lineup, but it has also allowed him to play more minutes. That\u2019s all we\u2019ve been asking for, with Boucher dropping 67 FD points across 36 minutes on Thursday. Andre Drummond (LAL) $6,100: Just like Boucher, Drummond always performs when he\u2019s given the playing time. While he was limited in his first game with the Lakers, Drum played 27 minutes and provided one of his patented double-doubles on Thursday. As long as this dude gets 30 minutes, he can easily accrue a double-double and has legit 20-20 upside with so much talent missing out of this rotation. James Wiseman (GSW) $4,800: Wiseman is averaging exactly a fantasy-point-per-minute for the season, and with his playing time on the uptick, we have to keep riding him at this price. The 20-year-old has started nine straight games and is playing nearly 26 minutes a night in that stretch. That means 25-30 fantasy points are definitely in play, especially against a Houston club that surrenders the fifth-most fantasy points to opposing centers. Isaiah Stewart (DET) $4,900: Detroit is clearly in full-on rebuild mode, and Stewart is certainly one of the guys they want to build around. He has actually started for Mason Plumlee twice this week, combining for 77 FD points in those two outings. That\u2019s hard to overlook at this price, especially with his elite per-minute production."},{"id":529559,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/tune-in-tidbits-abc-saturday-april-10-2021","date":"2021-04-10","title":"Tune-In Tidbits: ABC Saturday, April 10, 2021","content":"Lakers (32-20) at Nets (36-16)  8:30 p.m. ET, ABC \u2022 The Nets won the first meeting of the season with the Lakers, 109-98 on Feb. 18 , behind James Harden\u2019s 23 points and 11 assists, Joe Harris\u2019 21 points and 6-for-7 shooting on 3-pointers, and 16 points from Kyrie Irving.

Durant had 17 points on 5-for-5 shooting in 19 minutes off the bench in his first game in nearly two months on Thursday as the Nets beat the Pelicans. \u2022 This is a meeting of the team with the top-ranked offense (Brooklyn at 117.5) against the team with the top-ranked defense (Los Angeles at 105.6 allowed). The Lakers have been able to maintain their staunch defense even with James and Davis sidelined ( 104.3, 2nd ); however, their offense has fallen dramatically without the two All-Stars ( 101.1, 30th ). \u2022 The Nets rank second in the league in 3-point shooting (39.3%) as a team. They are led by Harris, who ranks third in the league in 3-point accuracy (48.4%) and sixth in total 3-pointers made (166) so far this season.

And then the Bucks lost their third straight, resting top players one night after closing a six-game trip with a 116-101 loss at Dallas. Jordan Nwora, a rookie second-round pick from Louisville, scored a career-high 24 points to lead the Bucks. Reigning two-time MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo missed a fourth straight game with a sore left knee that has kept him out of six of the Bucks\u2019 last 11 contests. The Bucks also were missing Jrue Holiday (bruised left knee), Donte DiVincenzo (bruised right hip), Brook Lopez (sore back), Khris Middleton (sore right knee) and reserve forward P.J.

Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer was unsure how soon they could return. \u201cWe\u2019ll see how they feel over the next day or two,\u201d Budenholzer said before the game. \u201cI think we\u2019re hopeful, with maybe P.J. being the exception, that these guys could all be on the shorter end of it. But Giannis has missed several games, so we\u2019ve got to see how he feels. These guys are a little banged up.\u201d Charlotte also wasn\u2019t close to full strength. The Hornets announced Saturday that Gordon Hayward would miss at least a month with a sprained right foot. Rookie of the Year candidate LaMelo Ball hasn\u2019t played since March 20 because of a fractured right wrist. Malik Monk has been out the last week with a sprained right ankle. \u201cWe always say it doesn\u2019t matter who\u2019s on the floor,\u201d said Graham, who shot 6 of 12 from 3-point range. \u201cThe expectations stay the same.\u201d Charlotte pulled ahead for good on a Bridges 3-pointer midway through the first quarter and led by as many as 21.

If I was to bet, Antetokounmpo will sit at least one more game, paving the way for someone like Donte DiVincenzo to garner more minutes again. DiVincenzo has surpassed 29+ minutes in each of his last five games and he\u2019s hit 5x value at his current price the past three games in which Antetokounmpo has been sidelined. Bobby Portis (MIL) $5,800 vs. CHA: Another member of the Milwaukee Bucks that could benefit from Antetokounmpo being ruled out again is Bobby Portis. Portis just carved up the Dallas Mavericks to the tune of 42.8 FD points and he draws an even better matchup on Friday. The Charlotte Hornets have given up a league-worst 48.97 FD points per game to power forwards, which bodes well for Portis if Antetokounmpo is indeed ruled out. Onyeka Okongwu (ATL) $4,700 vs. CHI: Clint Capela is questionable for the Atlanta Hawks and being that his ailment is affecting his Achilles, it wouldn\u2019t be a surprise to see Atlanta hold him out. In that case, Onyeka Okongwu becomes a viable value option at the center position. After going with Chris Boucher on Thursday \u2013 who exploded for 67.3 FD points versus the Chicago Bulls \u2013 why would we stop using centers against Chicago? Deni Avdija (WAS) $4,400 at GSW: The Washington Wizards have finally figured out that it\u2019s worth giving Deni Avdija more minutes in his rookie season. The rookie forward has logged 29+ minutes in all of his past six games and that shouldn\u2019t change on Friday. He\u2019s also hit 5x value in four out of his last six outings and he\u2019s turned the ball over just twice in his previous 11 games. If you\u2019re looking to find cheap pieces for the fast-paced Warriors\/Wizards showdown, look no further than Avdija Goga Bitadze (IND) $4,900 at ORL: The Indiana Pacers have injuries to multiple starters right now, including Malcolm Brogdon and Myles Turner. With Turner already ruled out for the Pacers, Goga Bitadze is slated to start at center for Indiana again on Friday. Bitadze just recorded 31.1 FD points on Wednesday versus the Minnesota Timberwolves in 25 minutes. Barring an unforeseen lineup change, Bitadze could see 25+ minutes again, putting him in a prime position to severely exceed his value at $4,900. Patrick Williams (CHI) $4,500 at ATL: As I mentioned yesterday, Patrick Williams has shown plenty of potential on the defensive end for the Chicago Bulls. Due to his ability to produce steals and blocks, he\u2019s a valuable player to use on FanDuel. Williams hit 5x value for the fifth time in his past seven games on Thursday night and FanDuel didn\u2019t alter his price on Friday, making him an intriguing salary-saving option at small forward against the Atlanta Hawks. Cole Anthony (ORL) $4,700 vs. IND: Everyone was curious to see how the Orlando Magic would deploy Cole Anthony in his first action in nearly two months on Wednesday. Despite his long layoff, Anthony would play 25 minutes and was a key member of the team off of the bench. The first-year point guard would notch 23.7 FD points and with Orlando looking to play their young players more, Anthony should continue seeing more run on Friday against an Indiana that plays at the seventh-fastest pace in the NBA. Jeremy Lamb (IND) $4,200 at ORL: On the other side of the court, as mentioned before, the Pacers are dealing with an assortment of injuries. If Brogdon is sidelined for another game on Friday, then Jeremy Lamb could be set up for a productive showing against the Magic. Orlando is the second-worst team to shooting guards this season and Lamb has accumulated 11 steals and blocks combined in his last two performances. Davis Bertans (WAS) $3,900 at GSW: There is going to be a bevy of shots being thrown up in the clash between the Warriors and the Wizards. Why not take a flier on a member of the Wizards that can put points in bunches from outside the arc? Davis Bertans has chucked up 27 three-point shots in the past three games, which has resulted in him averaging 23.9 FD points in that span. Not many guys under $4,000 bring the upside that Bertans does on Friday night. Isaiah Thomas (NOP) $3,900 vs. PHI: It is awesome to see Isaiah Thomas back in the NBA as the New Orleans Pelicans have given him a chance amid their injury woes recently. The veteran point guard has scored in double-digits in his first two games with the Pelicans and Lonzo Ball is questionable to suit up on Friday. If Ball is held out of Friday\u2019s contest against the Philadelphia 76ers, Thomas becomes a decent value play at the point guard position, especially if Kira Lewis is also ruled out."},{"id":528941,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nba-players-pay-tribute-to-dmx","date":"2021-04-09","title":"NBA players, teams pay tribute to DMX after rapper's death","content":"NBA players are paying their respects after Grammy-nominated hip-hop artist DMX, whose birth name was Earl Simmons, died at 50.

For Beal, he scores the majority of his points (55.9%) on 2-point shots, including 18.5% coming from mid-range (15th in NBA), only 21.5% on 3-pointers, and 22.6% at the free throw line (20th in NBA). \u2022 Curry has scored at least 30 points in each of his four games since returning from a tailbone contusion on March 29. It is the longest active streak of 30-point games in the league and tied for the second-longest of the season, trailing only six straight from Beal from Jan. 6-27. \u2022 While Beal holds the edge over Curry in scoring over the course of the season, the two are trending in different directions. Beal averaged a league-high 32.9 ppg in 32 games prior to the All-Star break , but his average has dropped to 25.7 ppg (13th in NBA) in 10 games since the break . Curry has been more consistent as he averaged 29.7 ppg (4th) in 35 games prior to the break, and 29.6 ppg in eight games since the break to lead all scorers post All-Star. \u2022 Russell Westbrook has recorded a triple-double in six of his last seven games and 10 of his 16 games since the All-Star break, bringing his season total to a league-high 20 and his career mark to 166 . He needs 16 more triple-doubles over Washington\u2019s 22 remaining games to break Oscar Robertson\u2019s record of 181 this season. \u2022 The Wizards (104.46) and Warriors (103.02) rank first and second in the league in pace this season. The Warriors rank 10th in fast break points (13.7 ppg), while the Wizards rank 24th (10.6 ppg)."},{"id":528843,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/kia-mvp-ladder-april-9-edition","date":"2021-04-09","title":"Kia MVP Ladder: Joel Embiid charges back into the mix","content":"Responding to Joel Embiid\u2019s pre-game declaration on Tuesday that he\u2019s back, Philadelphia 76ers coach Doc Rivers deadpanned: \u201cI noticed.\u201d We did, too, in welcoming back Embiid to the top five of this week\u2019s Kia Race to the MVP Ladder. Embiid checks in at No. 3, in part due to James Harden and Giannis Antetokounmpo missing time this week because of injuries. \u201cI\u2019ve still got a long way to go to get back to where I was before I got hurt,\u201d Embiid said, after dropping 35 points in dominating fashion to help the Sixers defeat the Boston Celtics 106-96 in just his second game back from a bone bruise in his left knee. \u201cI\u2019m not all the way there, but tonight was a big step.\u201d The victory over Boston lifted Philadelphia to a season-series sweep of the Celtics, the team that swept the 76ers in the first round of the 2020 playoffs. Embiid averaged 38.3 ppg and 9.0 rpg in the three matchups with Boston, and connected on 60.4% from the field, making him one of just three players around the league to accomplish that feat this season against the Celtics. Coincidentally, the other two \u2014 Nikola Jokic and Kyrie Irving \u2014 can also be found among the top 10 in this week\u2019s Kia Race to the MVP Ladder. Jokic retains the No. 1 spot, while Irving remains on the cusp of cracking the top five. He\u2019s tied at No. 6 with Luka Doncic, who helped Dallas bounce back from a rough loss at Houston with a win Thursday against Milwaukee. Harden falls back two spots to fifth, after missing three of his last four games with a strained right hamstring, and Antetokounmpo \u2014 having sat out of three consecutive contests with a sore knee \u2014 slips back a slot to No. 4. Damian Lillard narrowly clings to the No. 2 spot, but he might be on the way out of the top five after sputtering in three straight games. Still, it\u2019s a wide-open race now that Embiid\u2019s back in the mix, and as you can see here , there\u2019s still no real consensus on the favorite to win the Kia MVP, even among some of the league\u2019s all-time greats. LeBron James did issue a warning through a cryptic post on Instagram that suggests he\u2019ll soon be jumping back into the hunt, too, along with teammate Anthony Davis. And now, the Top 5 this week in the 2020-21 Kia Race to the MVP Ladder: Last week\u2019s ranking: No. 1 Season stats: 26.3 ppg, 10.9 rpg, 8.7 apg, 1.5 spg No Jamal Murray in the lineup on Wednesday, but that didn\u2019t stop Jokic and the Nuggets from capturing their seventh straight win , a 106-96 decision over the Spurs, as they rolled to 16-3 over their last 19 games. The most consistent player in the field of Kia MVP candidates, Jokic put together his 18th game this season with 25 points or more and 10-plus rebounds for a Denver squad that possesses arguably the most potent offensive trio (Jokic, Murray and Michael Porter Jr.) in the league. Despite Murray sitting out the last two games due to right knee soreness, Jokic continues to carry the Nuggets. Last week\u2019s ranking: No. 2 Season stats: 29.2 ppg, 4.3 rpg, 7.7 apg He\u2019s struggled for three consecutive games, with the Blazers losing two in a row. But attrition keeps Lillard in this spot, considering the missed time and injuries to Harden and Antetokounmpo, not to mention the fact he\u2019s gutted his way through various bumps and bruises, sitting out just two games the entire season. It\u2019s worth noting that Portland is now 1-8 against teams currently sitting in the top five of the Western Conference. Lillard has shot 16 of 50 from the field his last three games and finished with his second-lowest scoring total of the season (11 points) Tuesday in a loss to the Clippers . Last week\u2019s ranking: No. 7 Season stats: 29.9 ppg, 11.2 rpg, 3.2 apg, 1.4 bpg, 1.1 spg There\u2019s no doubt Philadelphia welcomed back Embiid with open arms, but as colleague Shaun Powell pointed out here : The Sixers had already proven adept at winning games without the star big man. Embiid certainly hasn\u2019t missed a beat since his return, averaging 29.5 points in his two games back. Embiid knocked down an incredible 16 free throws in a win Tuesday against Boston, which as a team took a total of just 18 attempts from the foul line. Embiid claims he\u2019s still trying to win the Kia Defensive Player of the Year , and that makes the man a terror on both ends of the floor. Last week\u2019s ranking: No. 4 Season stats: 28.8 ppg, 11.4 rpg, 6.2 apg, 1.3 bpg, 1.1 spg He missed his third-straight game Thursday due to left knee soreness, as the Bucks ruled out the two-time reigning Kia MVP approximately 90 minutes before tipoff in Dallas. Antetokounmpo has missed five of Milwaukee\u2019s last 10 contests , but he\u2019s scored 25 points or more in each of the last three games he\u2019s been able to play, including a 47-point effort on April 2 in a victory against Portland. Is Antetokounmpo\u2019s latest injury setback cause for concern? Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said, \u201cmy gut is it\u2019s not something that we\u2019re overly concerned about.\u201d So, we\u2019ll see. Last week\u2019s ranking: No. 3 Season stats: 25.2 ppg, 8.0 rpg, 10.9 apg, 1.2 spg Injuries immediately dropped LeBron James and Embiid down our list earlier this season. So, we\u2019ll be consistent with Harden, considering the Nets announced Tuesday the star would be out approximately 10 days due to a right hamstring strain. Brooklyn plans to re-evaluate Harden after the initial timeframe it announced. So, Harden could miss somewhere in the neighborhood of five outings over the next couple of weeks, including a matchup against the Lakers on Saturday and an April 14 clash at Philadelphia . The hamstring already kept Harden out of the two games prior to him tweaking it Monday against the Knicks. T-6. Luka Doncic, Dallas Mavericks T-6. Kyrie Irving, Brooklyn Nets 7.

Welts has been a member of the NBA for nearly five decades, including this most recent stint with the Warriors, which began in 2011. Currently in his 10th season with Golden State, Welts has spent 46 seasons overall in the NBA, including roles with three teams\u2014the Seattle SuperSonics, Phoenix Suns and the Warriors\u2014and the NBA league office. He was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2018, the crowning achievement in a career filled with numerous accolades. In 2011, Welts became the highest ranking executive in men\u2019s professional team sports to publicly acknowledge he was gay. Welts will remain associated with the organization as an Advisor. The Warriors are expected to name a new President within the next week. \u201cThis has been the ride of a lifetime,\u201d said Welts. \u201cTo have had a front row seat to the growth of the NBA from where it was in the late 1960s to its place today as one of the most respected and successful leagues in sports on a global stage has been an incredible privilege. The first day I met Joe Lacob and Peter Guber, I wanted to be a part of building what I knew could be a special organization. We have the most talented staff in the industry, and we are poised for even greater success in the future. Personally, I am excited for my own next chapter. \u201cWhen Joe, Peter and I agreed on the timing of this announcement two years ago, we didn\u2019t have a pandemic on our radar screen. As it turns out, now that we can look forward to welcoming fans back safely to Chase Center, and we have a realistic hope for a return to \u2018business as usual\u2019 for next season, this timing feels perfect.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll never forget the day we introduced Rick to the media as our President in 2011,\u201d said Joe Lacob, Warriors Co-Executive Chairman and CEO. \u201cOn that day, he noted the Warriors franchise was always viewed as a sleeping giant that could be very successful if it ever got into the right hands. Well, there were no better hands than those of Rick Welts, and his intuition proved to be spot-on as his leadership, vision, creativity and relationship-building enabled us to reach heights never seen before in the NBA on the business side. We thank him for his incredible contributions to our franchise and, more importantly, the class and character with which he represented our organization each day.\u201d \u201cMuch like a movie needs a well-placed and perfectly-aligned star to make it successful, you need to find the right person to lead an organization to prominence,\u201d said Peter Guber, Warriors Co-Executive Chairman. \u201cFortunately, we found that 10 years ago in Rick Welts. His hiring was one of the most important decisions Joe and I have made since purchasing the Warriors. The ability he demonstrated to navigate any situation with precision and grace\u2014from building a new arena to dealing with a pandemic\u2014is unparalleled. He wrote an incredible script and played the role to perfection. We will be indebted to him forever.\u201d \u201cSimply put, Rick Welts played a transformational role in creating the modern NBA during his more than 40 years as a pioneering league and team executive,\u201d said NBA Commissioner Adam Silver. \u201cHis extraordinary vision, leadership and humanity have defined his Hall of Fame career, which has set the standard of excellence in the sports industry. I had the tremendous good fortune to learn about the business of the NBA and its teams directly from Rick in my early years at the league office and have always appreciated his friendship and generosity. As he transitions into his next endeavor, I have no doubt that Rick will continue to leave his mark on the game and the greater sports business.\u201d Under Welts\u2019 direction, the Warriors established several franchise benchmarks from a business standpoint, as the team\u2019s brand grew in stature following five consecutive appearances in the NBA Finals and three NBA championships (2015, 2017, 2018). The organization earned numerous accolades across all facets of the business, including being named \u201cFranchise of the Decade\u201d among all professional sports teams by Sports Business Journal in 2019. Additionally, the Warriors became the first professional team to win Sports Business Journal\u2019s \u201cSports Team of the Year\u201d award on multiple occasions under Welts (2014 and 2016). During this time, Welts oversaw the completion of the Warriors\u2019 state-of-the-art new arena, Chase Center, in San Francisco\u2019s Mission Bay neighborhood, which opened its doors in September 2019. A year after its opening, Chase Center was named Sports Facility of the Year by Sports Business Journal and has received numerous distinctions and industry awards. Welts began his NBA career as a ballboy with the SuperSonics in 1969 at the age of 16 and, a decade later, was a part of the franchise\u2019s lone NBA championship in 1979 as its public relations director. During his 17 years with the NBA league office in New York (1982-99), he filled many vital roles and eventually rose to Executive Vice President, Chief Marketing Officer and President of NBA Properties. Welts\u2019 notable accomplishments with the league included the creation of NBA All-Star Weekend in 1984 and the marketing program for USA Basketball\u2019s Olympic \u201cDream Team\u201d in 1992. Along with Val Ackerman, he was named \u201cMarketer of the Year\u201d by Brandweek in 1998 for his role in launching the WNBA. A native of Seattle, Washington, Welts was selected to deliver the commencement address to his alma mater, the University of Washington, in 2019. He owns the rare distinction of being part of championship teams in the NBA (4), WNBA (2) and the NBA G League (1). Additionally, his teams made a total of seven NBA Finals appearances."},{"id":528145,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/power-rankings-notebook-defense-film-study","date":"2021-04-08","title":"Power Rankings Notebook: Suns' defense, Kawhi Leonard in the pick-and-roll and Nets' switching","content":"Each week during the season, NBA.com writer John Schuhmann surveys the league to compile stats and notes for his in-depth Power Rankings . Before the next rankings drop on Monday, here are some of the storylines he\u2019s keeping an eye on this weekend. When it comes to NBA defense, there\u2019s the scheme and there\u2019s the energy and communication within the scheme. These days, a lot of teams have the same basic principles defensively, hoping to force mid-range shots by having the ball-handler\u2019s defender go over the screen and the screener\u2019s defender drop back into the paint. But some on-ball defenders work harder than others to get over the screen. And some bigs are more active and engaged than others in their drop coverage. The level of effort and activity within the scheme can make all the difference. In their 117-113, overtime victory against the Utah Jazz on Wednesday, the Phoenix Suns showed why they\u2019re one of the best defensive teams in the league. Here are some examples of the work the Suns put in on Wednesday: 1. Get dirty An early example of awareness and sacrifice came from Devin Booker on the Jazz\u2019s fourth possession of the game. Donovan Mitchell beat Chris Paul off the dribble. Deandre Ayton rotated over to contest Mitchell\u2019s floater and Devin Booker rotated down to box out Rudy Gobert. It seems simple, but there are countless examples of where that next guy will rotate down without making the full effort to dislodge the opposing big man and keep him off the glass. Cam Johnson made a similar effort early in the second quarter. 2. Nothing easy Bojan Bogdanovic ended a nine-possession drought for the Jazz with a turnaround jumper over Booker midway through the first quarter, but the effort from Booker (pushing Bogdanovic away from the basket) and Mikal Bridges (pressuring the ball) to make the initial catch difficult was notable \u2026 3. Help and recover Ayton\u2019s defensive mobility has been and will continue to be under the microscope. Early in the third quarter, Booker was able to get over Gobert\u2019s initial screen for Mitchell, but got hit by the second one. Ayton was able to stifle the drive and then recover back to Gobert\u2019s roll, getting some help from Jae Crowder, who forced a jump ball \u2026 On the next possession, Ayton stayed in front of a Mike Conley dribble-handoff drive, didn\u2019t bite for an Ingles-esque pass fake, and blocked Conley\u2019s shot . 4. Forced to switch For the most part, the Suns do not want Ayton switching screens and being put on an island against an opposing guard. According to Synergy play-type tracking, Ayton has defended 121 isolation possessions, 36 more than any other player in the league . And the 1.08 points per possession he\u2019s allowed on those ranks 26th among 31 players who\u2019ve defended at least 50. There have been multiple occasions this season where he\u2019s been burned badly trying to defend guards or wings one-on-one late in games, and there was another in overtime on Wednesday. Instead of challenging Ayton at the rim, Conley dragged him back out to the perimeter and then drove right past him \u2026 Another downside of an Ayton switch is that it takes the Suns\u2019 rim protection away from the rim and can create a mismatch inside. Late in the third quarter, the Jazz got an open corner 3-pointer when Booker got caught in a screen, Ayton was forced to switch onto Conley, and Torrey Craig sunk in the paint to help Booker with Gobert \u2026 Midway through the fourth, Ayton switched a screen for Mitchell, but Paul didn\u2019t like that matchup (he has a Synergy account), so he scrambled back to the ball, leaving the Suns vulnerable behind the double-team \u2026 Paul\u2019s high hands on the double-team forced an imprecise pass from Mitchell. Joe Ingles didn\u2019t want to shoot the seemingly open corner 3-pointer off the low catch, but Bogdanovic hit another tough shot over Booker. Despite the isolation issues, the Suns have been riding with Ayton down the stretch of close games. Phoenix has played 126 total clutch minutes this season ( second most in the league ) and while Paul leads individuals with 115 clutch minutes played, Ayton is right behind him at 114. When it comes to late-game defense, other teams will sacrifice some rim protection for added foot speed and the ability to switch all screens. The Suns don\u2019t really have a switch-everything lineup they can turn to. While Dario Saric is a \u201csmall-ball five,\u201d that\u2019s more about his offensive skill than his defensive mobility. The Suns\u2019 execution down the stretch on Wednesday was a little better on offense (24 points on 19 clutch possessions) than defense (where the Jazz scored 20 on 17). But overall, the Suns have now accounted two of the Jazz\u2019s five least efficient games of the season, having held them to just 101 points per 100 possessions ( Utah\u2019s lowest mark vs. any opponent ) over two meetings. With the Suns now just a game behind the Jazz in the loss column for the top seed in the Western Conference, they\u2019ll meet again in Phoenix on April 30. The Jazz remain the only team in the top five in both offensive and defensive efficiency, but the Suns aren\u2019t far behind, ranking seventh and fifth . And it\u2019s on defense where they\u2019ve bigger improvement from last season. With the league average having seen a jump of 1.3 points per 100 possessions, only the Knicks (-4.8), Cavs (-2.8) and Warriors (-2.5) have seen a bigger drop in points allowed per 100 than the Suns (-2.4), who are set to rank in the top 10 defensively for the first time in 20 years ( since 2000-01 ). In the three seasons prior to coach Monty Williams\u2019 arrival in Phoenix, the Suns ranked 28th , 30th and 29th on defense, so this has been quite the two-year turnaround. The next challenge for Ayton and the Suns is the most efficient pick-and-roll scorer in the league, with the Suns in L.A. on Thursday, where they\u2019ll face the Clippers for the second half of their measuring-stick, national-TV back-to-back. Last season, Damian Lillard scored 1.15 points per possession on pick-and-roll ball-handler possessions, according to Synergy play-type tracking. It was the highest mark for any player who averaged at least five ball-handler possessions in the 16 years of Synergy tracking. This season, that mark is being topped, not by Lillard or one of the other guards who liberally launch long 3-pointers off the dribble, but by Kawhi Leonard. The Clippers\u2019 star has scored 1.16 points per possession as a pick-and-roll ball-handler, despite making fewer than one pull-up 3 per game . While teammate Paul George has been one of the league\u2019s best pull-up 3-point shooters this season, Leonard\u2019s 30-for-94 (32%) on pull-up 3-pointers ranks just 47th among 62 players who\u2019ve attempted at least 75. Leonard does most of his work inside the arc, and while he\u2019ll occasionally turn the corner with some burst \u2026 \u2026 his attack is usually more deliberate, slow and strong. Leonard\u2019s favorite spot on the floor is basically the same as that of Chris Paul, just inside the right elbow (2022 All-Star weekend should feature a shooting contest from that spot between the two of them, with a Lopez twin contesting from three feet away) \u2026 But he has been getting all the way to the basket more of late. With the departure of Montrezl Harrell, the Clippers have seen a big drop in the percentage of their shots that have come from the restricted area. Leonard had seen a drop himself, but after taking only 18% of his shots in the restricted area through his first 31 games, he\u2019s taken 29% of his shots there over his last 12. And again, it\u2019s not really about speed \u2026 While Leonard has been an efficient ball-handler, he hasn\u2019t been a high-usage one. His 6.0 ball-handler possessions per game are down from 8.4 last season and rank just 37th in the league , right behind Elfrid Payton (0.86 points per possession). The Clippers have been setting more ball screens for Leonard since the All-Star break (23.8 per game) than they were prior (19.0), but for comparison, the Blazers have set more than 45 ball screens per game for Lillard. The Clippers\u2019 stretch where they\u2019re playing six of seven games against the nine best teams in the league concludes with their game against the Suns on Thursday. They\u2019re 4-2 over that stretch so far , though one of the two losses came in the game (vs. Orlando) that wasn\u2019t against one of the good teams. After hosting the Suns, the Clippers still have two more games on their nine-game homestand, facing the Rockets on Friday and the Pistons on Sunday. An easy way to see which defenses are most or least aggressive in defending pick-and-rolls is by the percentage of their defensive possessions that are ball-handler possessions. A more aggressive defense has a lower percentage, because opposing ball-handlers are more likely to give up the ball. A defense that employs a soft \u201cdrop\u201d coverage typically has a higher percentage, with opposing ball-handlers more likely to step into an uncontested jumper. Last season, under then-coach Jim Boylen, only 12.3% of Bulls\u2019 opponent possessions were pick-and-roll ball-handler possessions. That was the league\u2019s lowest rate . Playing pick-and-rolls aggressively, the Bulls led the league (by a healthy margin) in opponent turnover rate , but also in the percentage of their opponents\u2019 shots that came in the restricted area. It was a feast-or-famine defense in that way. This season, under new coach Billy Donovan, the Bulls are at the other end of the list. In 2020-21, 22.9% of their opponents\u2019 possessions \u2014 the league\u2019s highest rate \u2014 pick-and-roll ball-handler possessions. Here\u2019s Nikola Vucevic dropping back as Kyrie Irving steps into a comfortable foul-line jumper \u2026 After the Bulls, the teams with the highest percentages (teams whose bigs hang back in the paint) are Utah, Oklahoma City, the Clippers and Milwaukee. The team where the Bulls were last year is the Charlotte Hornets, with only 10.6% of Charlotte opponent possessions having been pick-and-roll ball-handler possessions. That\u2019s actually the lowest percentage of the last seven seasons (since the Heat\u2019s 9.5% in LeBron James\u2019 last season in Miami). There are two reasons for the historically low mark. One, the Hornets have defended the fewest ball screens per 100 possessions, according to Second Spectrum tracking. That\u2019s in part because they\u2019ve played a lot more zone than any other team (13.7% of their defensive possessions, according to Synergy). Secondly, the Hornets have switched 38% of ball screens, the league\u2019s highest rate, according to Second Spectrum. After Charlotte, the teams with the lowest rates are Miami (Bam Adebayo liberally switches ball screens), Toronto, Denver and Indiana. The Hornets aren\u2019t the only team playing more zone this season. This is the third straight season in which there\u2019s been an increase in zone defense league-wide. There are a few teams that will play zone for multiple possessions in a row, and more that will mostly use it when the opponent is taking the ball out of bounds as a way to throw a wrench in whatever play the offense is trying to run. (We dug deep into zone defense and offense a year ago, with some coaches saying they want their team to run the play anyway.) That was the case in the fourth quarter in Boston on Tuesday, when the Sixers were inbounding the ball on the side. When the Celtics went to a 2-3 zone, the Sixers might not have recognized it, so they ran their play, and it turned out to work really well \u2026 When Tobias Harris and Joel Embiid set a staggered screen for Seth Curry, Jayson Tatum had to slide over from the left side of the floor to pick up the ball. With Danny Green left alone on the left wing, Semi Ojeleye rotated up from the left baseline position, leaving Ben Simmons in the \u201cdunker spot\u201d. Luke Kornet (middle baseline) slid over to cover Simmons and the middle of the paint was open for Embiid to roll into. If the Celtics were given another chance to defend the same play, they\u2019d probably have Jaylen Brown rotate into the middle of the paint to deny the pass to Embiid, so that the only uncovered Sixer was Harris, a long pass away from Green. After the Hornets, the team with the highest switch rate on ball screens is the Brooklyn Nets. As noted above, one negative to switching is the mismatches it can create, both inside and out. The Nets don\u2019t seem to mind if James Harden gets switched onto a big. Once again, Harden has good points-per-possession numbers when defending post-ups. But the Nets don\u2019t want Kyrie Irving defending the post (or having to box out an opposing center), so they\u2019ll often execute a \u201cscram\u201d switch, where, after a switch out high, a third defender will come rescue Irving from an interior mismatch and send him elsewhere. There were two back-to-back examples of this in the Nets\u2019 blowout win over New Orleans on Wednesday. On the first, Jeff Green switched a high screen, leaving Irving to guard Willy Hernangomez. But before Hernangomez could get into the paint, Kevin Durant slid off of James Johnson to scram Irving. Irving was a little slow to rotate to Johnson, but the Pels\u2019 forward had no interest in shooting an open 3-pointer and, when he drove, Irving poked the ball away \u2026 On the next possession, Lonzo Ball set a ball-screen for Zion Williamson. Irving didn\u2019t switch that, instead hedging the screen to allow Green to get back to Williamson \u2026 Green stayed in front of Williamson, who gave the ball back to Ball and set a screen himself, getting the Pelicans the switch they wanted. But as Williamson rolled into post-up position, Nicolas Claxton scrammed Irving out of that matchup. Durant rotated down to Jaxson Hayes and Irving rotated out to Johnson. He was slow getting there again, but Johnson missed an open 3-pointer \u2026 With the Nets\u2019 switching scheme, opponents will continue to look for matchups they can take advantage of. Irving guarding somebody big is one of those matchups and the Nets are well aware of that. Their ability to \u201cscram\u201d him off those matchups and his quickness in finding the abandoned opponent will be something to keep an eye on. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

Lakers coach Frank Vogel said on Thursday that Drummond \u2014 whom the Lakers added as a free agent on March 28 \u2014 will return to the lineup. Vogel said after the Lakers beat the Toronto Raptors on Tuesday that Drummond would start once he was cleared to play again. Drummond had an abbreviated debut on last Wednesday against Milwaukee, and the right big toe contusion he suffered delayed his ability to play since then. Drummond scored four points in 14 minutes before leaving the court early in the third quarter after trying to play without the toenail on his big right toe. He started for the Lakers in his first NBA game in 6 1\/2 weeks, but he wasn\u2019t on the floor to start the second half while getting treatment on his toe. He checked in and made it through just a few more possessions before taking himself out of the game in clear pain. The Lakers signed Drummond last weekend after 8 1\/2 NBA seasons in Detroit and Cleveland. Additionally, forward Kyle Kuzma (calf tightness) is listed as questionable against the Heat while new swingman Ben McLemore will be available to play against Miami. However, McLemore\u2019s minutes in tonight\u2019s game will depend on the availability of the Lakers\u2019 other wing players. The Lakers are 32-19 and fifth in the Western Conference and have been trying to stay afloat in the standings while superstars Anthony Davis and LeBron James recover from injury. Davis has not played since Feb. 14 because of an Achilles injury, while James (ankle) has been out since March 21.

While paying up for De\u2019Aaron Fox should be a popular choice, Harrison Barnes could be a nice mid-tier option at the power forward position. Barnes has reached 5x value in three out of his last four games (played 34+ minutes in each of those four contests), and for those that use game logs to determine which players to use, Barnes notched 50.1 FD points a few weeks ago against the Pistons. Chris Boucher (TOR) $6,000 vs. CHI The Toronto Raptors are shorthanded once again as Fred VanVleet has already been ruled out for Thursday\u2019s game against the Chicago Bulls. Kyle Lowry was ruled out 7-10 days over a week ago, but it would be a surprise to see him suit up on Thursday. Given the injuries, Chris Boucher is poised to see more run with the starters again. Boucher started Toronto\u2019s last game versus the Los Angeles Lakers and compiled 33.1 FD points. The Bulls have allowed a league-high 61.75 FD points per game to centers in their past 30 games. Malachi Flynn (TOR) $6,000 vs. CHI Another member of the Raptors that has seen an increased role amid the team\u2019s injury woes is Malachi Flynn. When VanVleet and Lowry are off the floor, Flynn averages a 20.7 percent usage percentage, and he averages 41.61 FD points per 36 minutes. He has seen 30+ minutes in his past three games, and he should easily hit 5x value at his $6,000 price tag as long as VanVleet and Lowry are both confirmed out again. Taurean Prince (CLE) $5,800 at OKC With the Cleveland Cavaliers near the bottom of the Eastern Conference, they are attempting to find which players fit their long-term plan (whatever that may be). While Larry Nance Jr. remains sidelined with an illness, Taurean Prince has seen increased run in recent games. Prince has taken Cedi Osman\u2018s spot in the rotation, playing in 25+ minutes in the past two games, where he scored 30+ FD points in both games. It is a pace-up game for the Cavaliers on Thursday, and Prince should continue to see a decent amount of playing time with Nance being ruled out already. Jordan Clarkson (UTA) $5,600 vs. POR The game that features the highest over-under on the slate is the late-night showdown between the Utah Jazz and the Portland Trail Blazers. For the Jazz, Jordan Clarkson is a way to get a piece of Utah\u2019s roster for a reasonable price. Clarkson operates as Utah\u2019s sixth man, and he can score points in bunches. Even though he\u2019s failed to reach 5x value in his last two games at his current price, Clarkson hit 5x value in three out of his last five before that. DeAndre\u2019 Bembry (TOR) $5,200 vs. CHI Once again, the Raptors are expected to be extremely shorthanded again on Thursday, which means there is value to be had. Besides Boucher and Flynn, DeAndre\u2019 Bembry has earned a large role during the team\u2019s recent stretch of games. Bembry only costs $5,200 on FanDuel and has played in 30+ minutes in back-to-back games. The veteran guard has also posted 34+ FD points in back-to-back games. Moses Brown (OKC) $5,100 vs. CLE Along with the Raptors, the Thunder are another team who could have a thin rotation available on Thursday. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is already ruled out, and Luguentz Dort, Aleksej Pokusevski, Darius Bazley and Isaiah Roby are all game-time decisions with various ailments. That could set up Moses Brown for a massive role on Thursday. If Brown gets more minutes against the Cavaliers, Cleveland has allowed the eighth-most (56.83) FD points per game to centers in their past seven games while Jarrett Allen has been out. Patrick Williams (CHI) $4,500 at TOR Patrick Williams has shown plenty of promise on the defensive end for the Bulls, and his offense is improving. Nevertheless, the rookie forward gets an opportunity to face a shorthanded Toronto squad on Thursday, which could pave the way for him to receive more minutes. Williams contributes in multiple areas in the box score, and at $4,500, he isn\u2019t much of a risk at a thin small forward position. The Florida State product has reached 5x value at his current price tag in three out of the past five games. Isaiah Hartenstein (CLE) $4,000 at OKC Due to Allen and Nance being out, the Cavaliers are left with Prince, Kevin Love, Dean Wade, and Isaiah Hartenstein in the frontcourt. Hartenstein is the tallest of the bunch and has been getting run at the center position while Allen recovers from a concussion. Luckily for us, Hartenstein is a power forward on FanDuel, and he gives us salary relief at $4,000, a spot in which he\u2019s hit 5x value three out of the past four contests. Svi Mykhailiuk (OKC) $3,800 vs. CLE When looking for a player sub-$3,000, Svi Mykhailiuk could be a notable option at the shooting guard position. Of course, it\u2019s hard to gauge who will get minutes for the Thunder right now, which makes Mykhailiuk a risky play on Thursday night. But if Mykhailiuk does happen to get a modest amount of minutes against Cleveland, then he\u2019s worth a flier if you\u2019re someone who is looking for a salary-saving piece in your lineup."},{"id":527301,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/kevin-durant-to-play-vs-pelicans","date":"2021-04-08","title":"Kevin Durant comes off bench, shoots perfect 5-for-5 in return","content":"The Brooklyn Nets got one of their All-Stars back in the mix even as another one rests. Kevin Durant came off the bench in Brooklyn\u2019s 139-111 win over the New Orleans Pelicans. The former two-time Finals MVP was greeting with cheers from the limited Nets crowd before hitting his first shot from mid-range. He shot a perfect 5-for-5 for the field, finishing with 17 points, seven rebounds, and five assists. Durant had not played since Feb. 13 because of a strained left hamstring. \u201cI expected to come out here and play the way I played,\u201d Durant said after Wednesday\u2019s game. \u201cI wasn\u2019t trying to ease into the game.\u201d Coach Steve Nash said bringing Durant off the bench was so the Nets could more easily control his minutes if the game was close down the stretch. It wasn\u2019t. \u201cWe got dominated at both ends of the floor. Totally dominated,\u201d Pelicans coach Stan Van Gundy said. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t get out to the 3-point line. Our defense was absurd. They totally dominated us.\u201d Durant got an ovation from the first home crowd he\u2019d played in front of with the Nets. Barclays Center only began allowing limited crowds on Feb. 23. Durant played as a reserve for only the second time in his career \u2014 both in his last two home games. He wasn\u2019t able to start on Feb. 5 against Toronto in what was his 867th game while the NBA reviewed an inconclusive coronavirus test result of someone Durant had interacted with that afternoon. He was later cleared to enter, then forced to leave again in the third quarter. In a video released by the team before Wednesday\u2019s game, Durant talked about his work to rehabilitate form his injury and being ready to play. \u201cThe last month or so, it\u2019s just been me working out every day, playing here and there with my teammates,\u201d Durant said. \u201cIt\u2019s good to get a few of those sessions in before I went and jump into an NBA game. It\u2019s been too long for me \u2026 I\u2019m just excited to get back out there.\u201d Entering Wednesday, the Nets have only had their star trio of Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving in the same lineup for seven games (5-2) this season, but are currently No. 1 in the Eastern Conference at 36-16. Durant is averaging 29.0 ppg, 7.3 rpg and 5.9 apg for the Nets this season. Harden will be reevaluated in approximately 10 days after an MRI revealed a strained right hamstring, the team announced on Tuesday. Harden originally sustained the injury on March 31 against the Houston Rockets but appeared to reaggravate the hamstring in his return against the New York Knicks on Monday. He lasted just four minutes before having to exit the contest.

He averaged 40.7 FanDuel points per game (FDPPG) through that stretch (5.6x value), and he\u2019ll take on the NBA\u2019s worst defense against centers this evening. Khem Birch\u2019s impending return may cap his upside, but I suspect that the Magic will trust the hot hand tonight. Malcolm Brogdon (IND) $6,700 Pay close attention to Indiana\u2019s injury report tonight. The Pacers held Brogdon out of last night\u2019s game because of a hip injury, but he was able to practice on Monday. I suspect that the Pacers were just being careful with their star point guard, and if he returns to the lineup tonight, he should easily hit 5x value against a salary this low. He averages 37.3 FDPPG (5.6x value), and the T\u2019Wolves give up the fourth-most FDPPG to point guards. Devonte\u2019 Graham (CHA) $6,500 The Hornets are now without LaMelo Ball, Malik Monk and Gordon Hayward. That leaves a lot of slack for their remaining starters to pick up, yet you can get most of them at quite affordable salaries. The Hornets have looked toward the end of this six-game road trip, but they\u2019ve had multiple days off to get some rest, and they\u2019ll take on a depleted Thunder team tonight. I prefer Graham to Terry Rozier ($7,400) simply because of the price differential. R.J. Barrett (NYK) $6,000 Why is Barrett this cheap? Sure, he\u2019ll play the Celtics in what should be a low-scoring game. But Barrett lit up Boston for 19 points, three assists and 11 rebounds back in January, so we can\u2019t write him off. He may not repeat that performance, but he should easily post enough points to hit value. He averages 29.8 FDPPG (5x value) on the year. Aleksej Pokusevski (OKC) $5,500 With Isaiah Roby, Luguentz Dort, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Darius Bazley all still out for the Thunder, the team\u2019s reserves will have to keep stepping up. Pokusevski will be a key contributor at power forward, especially since the Hornets surrender the most FDPPG to the position. He has averaged 27.4 FDPPG (5x value) over his last four outings. P.J. Washington (CHA) $5,200 Washington is my favorite player to target in Charlotte\u2019s offense. The Thunder give up the second-most FDPPG to power forwards, and Washington\u2019s salary reflects an overreaction to his road-trip slump. Also, the Thunder allow the second-most FDPPG to opposing power forwards. Look for him to rebound after some time off. Josh Richardson (DAL) $5,000 The Houston Rockets allow the most FDPPG to shooting guards, where Richardson spends 82% of his minutes despite his small forward designation. Richardson hit 5x value against this price in his last appearance, and this is the perfect opponent for him to start building some momentum. Joe Harris (BKN) $5,000 I\u2019ll admit that the logic behind this pick is very simple: made 3s. The Pelicans allow the most of them per game (15.1), and Harris averages 3.2 made 3s per game. Kevin Durant should make his return tonight, but since James Harden will have to miss time with a hamstring injury, Harris should still have plenty of chances to hit value. Goga Bitadze (IND) $3,900 Bitadze, Indiana\u2019s backup center, might be chalk if Turner gets ruled out. The second-year pro has averaged 7.8 points, 1.4 assists, 4.6 rebounds and 1.1 blocks per game over his last eight appearances. He played just 12.8 minutes per game through that stretch. At this price, Bitadze should easily surpass 5x value should Turner have to miss time. Ish Smith (WAS) $3,500 Smith is back! He played 20-plus minutes in his first two games back for the Wizards (of course, Bradley Beal has been out), but he should be in line for a stable rotational role behind even if they both play; he had been averaging 20.6 minutes per game before his injury. He should easily clear 5x value with an average share of minutes tonight, as the Magic give up the second-most FDPPG to point guards."},{"id":527397,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/1-player-tested-positive-in-latest-covid-19-results-4","date":"2021-04-07","title":"1 player tested positive in latest COVID-19 results","content":"NEW YORK \u2013 Of the 483 players tested for COVID-19 since March 31, one new player has returned a confirmed positive test.

It doesn\u2019t pack quite the punch of \u201csurvive and advance,\u201d a more urgent basketball phrase heard frequently at this time of year (generally attributed to late North Carolina State coach Jim Valvano for his 1983 Wolfpack\u2019s run to the NCAA title). But it\u2019s better than win or develop, the more common choice faced by NBA teams deep into a regular season that are trying to serve two often-conflicting masters. Such as the Golden State Warriors, more so maybe than most. The Warriors have been trying all season to establish themselves as a bonafide playoff team. That makes sense, given the pedigree of their recent past (five Finals from 2015 through 2019) and the ticking primes of cornerstone players Steph Curry and Draymond Green. (Klay Thompson\u2019s is ticking too in the rehab gym.) But grabbing raw and high-ceilinged big man James Wiseman with the No. 2 overall pick imposed development as a priority, and some midseason W-L hiccups had the Warriors adding Jordan Poole and Nico Mannion to the futures focus creeping into the present. Wiseman, of course, has been the key to Golden State\u2019s either\/or vs. both dilemma. The 7-footer who logged just three appearances in his brief stint of college ball at Memphis was precocious to start this season, averaging 12.2 points and 6.1 rebounds through January. But his numbers have dipped since \u2013 10.6, 5.7 \u2013 taking his confidence with them. Mix in a sprained wrist, a sitdown related to virus protocols and more recent up-down churning, and it\u2019s no wonder the questions about Wiseman\u2019s progress have turned into what Warriors coach Steve Kerr sarcastically refers to as \u201cthe James Wiseman report card\u201d each game night. All of it has to do with expectations. Wiseman was drafted ahead of Charlotte\u2019s LaMelo Ball, who almost instantly seized the favorite status as Kia NBA Rookie of the Year and top rung on this Rookie Ladder. So when Ball went down with a broken bone in his hand, Wiseman theoretically joined Minnesota\u2019s Anthony Edwards and Sacramento\u2019s Tyrese Haliburton as potential usurpers. Add in the Warriors\u2019 vaunted culture and peer mentoring, presumably shortening the young man\u2019s learning curve (he turned 20 last week), and many folks naturally focused on Wiseman. Prematurely, as it turns out. In a recent piece on Rookie of the Year winners, Monte Poole of NBA Sports Bay Area reminded readers of an NBA truism: It takes big men longer. He noted that of the eight centers who won the award over the past 50 years, six had more college experience than Wiseman and one (Pau Gasol) had been a pro for two years in Spain. It\u2019s up to the Warriors, who have designated him their starter in the middle since March 23, to synchronize \u2013 if they can \u2013 the desire to win with their veteran stars with hedging their bets for future seasons. \u201cNo matter how we look at it, James just needs time,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to need a summer league and a training camp next year. And he\u2019s going to grow, he\u2019s going to get better and better and he\u2019s going to be a great player. But we just can\u2019t force the issue.\u201d So sometimes it will be 11 points, 10 rebounds and active defense in a first half, as Wiseman posted against Milwaukee Tuesday, and other times four points, four rebounds, 1-of-5 shooting and five turnovers, like his work at Miami last week. As Kerr said: \u201cThere are moments when he looks like a future superstar. And there are moments he looks like a young rookie who is trying to figure things out. So I think that\u2019s perfectly natural at this point.\u201d The Top 5 this week on the 2020-21 Kia Rookie Ladder: (All stats through Monday, April 5) Season stats : 17.6 ppg, 4.4 rpg, 2.6 apg Since last Ladder: 23.0 ppg, 4.8 rpg, 3.0 apg  Last Ladder\u2019s rung : 2 His efficiency comes and goes, but Edwards is in there swinging. He continues to lead the rookies in scoring ( 17.6 ) and in shots per game ( 16.5 ). The No. 1 pick had a couple of plus nights in victories over New York and Sacramento. That included his 19-8-5 performance vs. the Kings in which he shot 5-for-15 with seven turnovers in a snapshot of his season. It\u2019s looking like it will take something dramatic for a new face to crack the Top 2 here, though Edwards and Haliburton could flip-flop repeatedly down the stretch.

That number won\u2019t change for at least 10 days as Harden is out with a hamstring strain, while Durant is available to play after suffering a hamstring injury of his own that kept him out seven weeks. This season, the Nets are 5-2 with the \u201cBig 3\u201d together, 16-3 with just Irving and Harden, 3-4 with just Durant and Irving, 2-0 with just Durant and Harden, 8-4 when just one of the Big 3 play, and 1-3 with none of the Big 3 plays. \u2022 Durant will be in the lineup for the first time since Feb. 13. In the 23 games that he\u2019s missed during that time, the Nets went an NBA-best 19-4 while averaging 115.8 ppg and outscoring teams by an average of 5.5 ppg. In Durant\u2019s absence, Kyrie Irving scored a team-best 28.4 points while adding 6.6 assists and 5.3 rebounds. Irving and James Harden were two of only eight players (and the only teammates) to average 25-5-5 during that time. \u2022 New Orleans is coming off a 123-107 loss to Atlanta on Tuesday; this season the Pelicans are 3-6 on the second night of a back-to-back. Zion Williamson has averaged 30.7 ppg on 62.6% shooting while appearing in seven of New Orleans\u2019 nine games on zero days rest. \u2022 With 34 points on 12-for-18 shooting (66.7%) in New Orleans\u2019 loss to Atlanta on Wednesday, Zion Williamson recorded his 25th straight game with at least 20 points while shooting 50% or better, tying Shaquille O\u2019Neal (in 2001) for the longest such streak in the shot-clock era (since 1954-55). \u2022 Brooklyn enters Wednesday ranked sixth in 3-pointers made (14.2 per game) and fourth in 3-point accuracy (39.1%). The Nets\u2019 team 3-point percentage gets a strong boost from Joe Harris, who ranks third in the league in 3-point shooting (48.4%) and fifth in total 3-pointers made (164). 10 p.m. ET, ESPN \u2022 With Utah\u2019s nine-game win streak snapped on Monday, the Suns are tied with Denver for the longest active win streak in the league (six straight). During this stretch, Devin Booker has averaged 30.8 points on 51.2%-46.3%-93% shooting splits. \u2022 With 11 dimes in Phoenix\u2019s win over Houston on Monday, Chris Paul became the fifth player in NBA history with 500 career games with double-digit assists, joining John Stockton (863), Magic Johnson (587), Jason Kidd (569), and Steve Nash (509). \u2022 The Jazz lead the NBA with 43.6% of their points coming from 3-pointers. Utah shoots 39.5% from 3-point range (2nd in the NBA) and averages a league-high 17 3-pointers made per game. The Jazz are on pace to average the most 3-pointers made of any team in league history, topping this season\u2019s Portland Trail Blazers (16.2 per game) and the 2018-19 Houston Rockets (16.1 per game). \u2022 While Utah is shooting 3-pointers at a historic pace, the Suns are one of the top teams in defending the 3-point shot . Phoenix holds teams to 34.8% shooting from beyond the arc (fourth-lowest percentage allowed) and just 32.6 3-point attempts per game (ninth-fewest in the league). Both the Suns and Jazz hold their opponents 1.6 percentage points below their normal shooting percentage on 3-point shots. \u2022 The Suns and Jazz are both 11-3 since the All-Star break, tied with Brooklyn and Denver for the top record in the league since the break. The Jazz (117.6) and Suns (117.1) rank second and third, respectively, in scoring in that time, while the Suns rank first in field goal percentage (50.5%), while the Jazz rank 13th (46.8%)."},{"id":527275,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/irving-proving-to-be-a-constant-for-nets","date":"2021-04-07","title":"Kyrie Irving a stable force even as Nets' lineups waver","content":"Kyrie Irving ran a beige pick through the back of his hair under a black dad cap, and eventually launched into a long-winded explanation regarding the culture the Brooklyn Nets are working to build. \u201cI don\u2019t know if anyone could have saw this vision a year ago or two years ago,\u201d Irving said last week , after Brooklyn\u2019s 111-89 win against the Charlotte Hornets. \u201cBut when we were looking at this thing, it was just a blank canvas, you know? You don\u2019t just build a team in a week or in two weeks. You\u2019ve got to make some major moves, and we made some major changes this year. And I just really want to say this, too: We don\u2019t take anything for granted, either, because there were days when we were on other teams trying to build a championship culture on our own. \u201cWe took on that role, and it just wasn\u2019t fitting with the guys, or whatever the case may be. We\u2019re literally dedicated to performing the craft of basketball at a very high level for one another because we want to see each other win.\u201d Irving embodied that last statement throughout March by tweaking his game, after virtually handing James Harden the keys to Brooklyn\u2019s offense to help the piecemeal Nets (without Kevin Durant in the lineup) roll to an 11-2 mark last month. Irving led the league in scoring (30.2 points per game) in March and, coincidentally, Harden racked up his highest assist average (11.5 apg) of the season over that span. The most consistent fixture of Brooklyn\u2019s Big Three, Irving \u2014 despite two earlier leaves of absence due to personal reasons \u2014 appears to have set his sights on the larger picture. The Nets are preparing to host New Orleans on Wednesday without Harden (hamstring), who is expected to miss at least 10 days, while Durant is available to play after he missed 23 consecutive contests. The adaptability Irving continues to flex should figure prominently when it comes to enhancing Brooklyn\u2019s prospects for reaching the ultimate goal of hoisting the Larry O\u2019Brien Trophy. Irving showcased much of that Monday with a brilliant 40-point performance that included seven assists and two turnovers in a 114-112 win against the New York Knicks that caught the attention of at least one of his NBA point-guard peers. \u201cHe\u2019s just an amazing basketball player, and he found a way to keep our team in it for big stretches,\u201d Nets coach Steve Nash said of Irving. Brooklyn is 3-1 this season when Irving scores 40 or more points. Against the Knicks in a battle featuring 15 lead changes, Irving drilled a step-back 3-pointer with 1 minute left after New York had closed the gap to two points. Keep in mind the Nets opened the contest without Durant, Tyler Johnson (right knee), Landry Shamet (right ankle) and Blake Griffin (left knee injury management), before losing Harden (who logged a little more than four minutes). Johnson suffered a non-contact injury in Sunday\u2019s loss at Chicago, and Shamet exited that same game in the fourth quarter in just his second contest back on the floor after missing five in a row with an injury to the same ankle. So, despite leading a shorthanded squad against a Knicks team that constantly sent double-teams his way, Irving racked up his seventh 40-point night as a Net, which ranks No. 3 in franchise history . \u201cI think we\u2019ve all won enough individually,\u201d Irving said last week. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a few champions on the team, but now we want to see others have that same championship-level mindset, mentality, and then exemplify it. It\u2019s one thing to just say it. Everybody has talks after the games, \u2018Let\u2019s do this.\u2019 But the culture that\u2019s being built is that accountability, holding each other to that standard. And it\u2019s not easy, bro. It\u2019s never easy.\u201d Irving just seems to consistently make it look that way in the midst of Brooklyn endlessly tinkering with its lineups \u2014 in part due to injuries \u2014 as it works to determine how to best deploy those groupings for the stretch run and playoffs. Harden had already missed his second consecutive game with the hamstring issue on Sunday, before reinjuring it against the Knicks. \u201cIt\u2019s really tough, especially when we\u2019re trying to get healthy, especially what happened in the last game (against Chicago) with TJ and Landry,\u201d said Nets forward Jeff Green. \u201cSo, now James. We have to just come together collectively and figure out ways to win.\u201d Added Irving: \u201cIt\u2019s tough to move onto the next thing after one of our guys goes down with an injury, an apparent injury where they have to go to the back.\u201d Yet that\u2019s what Irving and the Nets continue to do. Interestingly, the Nets have played just seven games with Irving, Harden and Durant all in the lineup. If you count Harden\u2019s brief appearance on Monday, the Nets are 16-3 this season when both guards play. Durant, meanwhile, hasn\u2019t played since Feb. 13. We haven\u2019t even yet explored the dynamic of Brooklyn trying to incorporate new additions Griffin and LaMarcus Aldridge. Nash inserted them both as starters for Sunday\u2019s loss at Chicago with mixed results. \u201cWell, shoot, I\u2019d rather not think about it,\u201d Irving said. \u201cI\u2019d rather go out there and have everybody out there playing. But, in due time. [I\u2019m] remaining patient. We all want to be healthy for when we make that run after May 16.\u201d He continued: \u201cThe most flexible teams in the league are usually the most successful at this point because you\u2019re able to just throw guys out there and still have a certain standard that you want to play at. So, I think we\u2019re exemplifying that every game.\u201d Much of the credit for that goes to Irving. * * * Michael C. Wright is a senior writer for NBA.com.

It became legit to wonder after Payton II, 28, was named last month as the 2020-21 G League Defensive Player of the Year for his work with the Raptors 905 squad in the Orlando bubble. The 6-foot-3, 195-pound Oregon State product averaged 2.54 steals to go with 10.8 points, 5.6 rebounds and 2.6 assists in 13 games in the pandemic-shortened season. He got seven of his 33 steals, as well as 11 defensive rebounds, on Feb. 13 against the Ignite elite team. So if the G League had a Defensive Player Ladder the way the NBA does, Payton II would hold the top rung. He\u2019s proud enough of the award he got. \u201cI\u2019ve been around that mindset my whole life, just from watching my dad,\u201d he said a few days ago in a phone interview. \u201cI think it\u2019s pride \u2013 it\u2019s fun for me to guard the best player [on the other team] and shut them down. I like to cause havoc on that side of the court, whether I\u2019m guarding a guard or a big. I think my natural instincts take over.\u201d That\u2019s where the issue of nature vs. nurture comes in. Payton the elder is the only point guard to win the NBA\u2019s Defensive Player of the Year award in its 39-year history. He did so in 1995-96, a runaway winner in the voting (56 first-place votes) over historic defensive candidates such as Scottie Pippen (15), Dikembe Mutombo (11), David Robinson (9), Hakeem Olajuwon (8), Michael Jordan (7) and Dennis Rodman (4). The award came in the midst of Payton\u2019s nine consecutive All-Defense first-team selections. In that 1995-96 season, playing coach George Karl\u2019s heavily (and rare at the time) switching style, Seattle controlled the Western Conference, finishing 64-18 with defensive and net ratings second only to the Bulls, and met Chicago in the Finals (losing in six games). Nicknamed \u201cThe Glove\u201d for how closely he stuck to his men, Payton finished sixth in MVP balloting that season, one of eight times he placed in the Top 10. Believe it or not, that\u2019s when Payton II said he believes his embrace of defense began. He was only 3 years old by the 1996 Finals, but claims he absorbed the lessons on display. \u201cIt started from there, everything that went on that season,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter that, there were a bunch of players I grew up around, coming to the gym, like [Jason] Kidd, Kevin Garnett and other friends of the family. I\u2019d pick their brains too, just try to take as much knowledge.\u201d It certainly is possible Payton II got his unwanted nickname around that time. That\u2019s right, \u201cThe Mitten.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve tried to stop it multiple times,\u201d he said, with a laugh. \u201cIt was automatic, I guess.\u201d The typical image of a great basketball player and his or her young child is for the parent to hoist the kid close to the rim so dropping the ball through is easy and fun. The Paytons apparently didn\u2019t do any of that, nor did they work on footwork or tenacity at the other end of the court. \u201cGrowing up, he was always competitive with us. I think that was him putting that in us,\u201d said Payton II, who has four non-playing siblings. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t like we went to the gym and worked on defensive drills. I just picked it up at a young age because I was around it. \u201cThen I remembered when I got older. My dad kind of let me do it on my own and figure it out. It\u2019s really just repetition. I do watch film on certain guys, and I try to be as disruptive as I can.\u201d The NBA\u2019s developmental league has been giving out its DPOY since 2002. The most successful winners, by games eventually played in the NBA, include Toronto\u2019s Chris Boucher and former role players DeAndre Liggins, Greg Stiemsma and Mikki Moore. Obviously it\u2019s an honor Payton II would rather not win back-to-back. He played 61 games in the NBA from 2016 to 2020 with the Bucks, the Lakers and the Wizards, and his goal is to get back. He believes defense can be his ticket. \u201cThis season, I guarded a lot of fours and fives,\u201d Payton II said. \u201cI can bang with the big fellas, I have no problem with that. I actually think I\u2019m more physical than the league likes. I always say, if I had a chance to play in the era my dad did in the \u201890s, I would love that because of the bumping and hitting they allowed. \u201cNow I use my mind more, trying to outthink the offensive player to find ways to make him uncomfortable. My main thing is finding a place where it\u2019s the right fit and the right time. And just trying to get one guaranteed year, when I can impress some people to maybe lock in for multiple years.\u201d Here are the Top 5 this week on the 2020-21 Defensive Player Ladder: (All stats through Monday, April 5) Last week\u2019s Ladder : 1 Don\u2019t look now, but Gobert isn\u2019t just a favorite to win his third Defensive Player of the Year award \u2013 he\u2019s also likely to get some MVP votes, given his impact on Utah at both ends, his efficiency and the injury situations of some otherwise natural candidates like Joel Embiid, LeBron James and Anthony Davis. Still, it\u2019s his results as a rim protector and helper \u2013 a 6.6 percentage point difference in opponents\u2019 FG%, the 19.5 DFGA he faces and his 0.168 defensive win shares \u2013 that fuel the Jazz\u2019s play overall. Last week\u2019s Ladder : 3 Philadelphia has stayed afloat in the defensive rankings during Joel Embiid\u2019s injury absence in part because of Simmons\u2019 equal or greater case for DPOY. He\u2019s averaging 1.5 steals, 3.5 deflections and 1.3 loose balls recovered nightly, while taking pride in shadowing opponents\u2019 most potent scoring threats as needed. He has been the league\u2019s top on-ball defender all season. Last week\u2019s Ladder : 2 The Pacers center still is your leader in blocks per game (3.5) and total blocks (156). And he swatted eight in Indiana\u2019s past three games. But Turner has been in the red each night for a cumulative minus-38, though the team was outscored by 16 in going 1-2. Last week\u2019s Ladder : 5 The mix-master of Milwaukee\u2019s defense has a 106.6 defensive rating. Opposing shooters make 41.7% of their shots against him. [ NBA.com\/Stats | Players Defense Dash Overall ] And in coach Mike Budenholzer\u2019s schemes the past three games, last year\u2019s DPOY and his mates have outscored teams by 10.1 points, limiting them to 42.1% shooting. Last week\u2019s Ladder : N\/A It\u2019s sometimes hard to separate the individual from the team entry on this Ladder. Utah has Gobert, Mike Conley and others. The Sixers have Simmons, Embiid (when healthy) and Matisse Thybulle. Milwaukee has Antetokounmpo, Jrue Holiday, Brook Lopez, and so on. Well, the Heat have Adebayo and Jimmy Butler, both of whom merit defensive acclaim. Adebayo gets the nod for logging more games, anchoring Miami\u2019s D full-time, and making a 7-point difference when he\u2019s on the floor vs. off.

It is Embiid\u2019s highest scoring average against any team he\u2019s faced more than once and his highest field goal percentage against any team he\u2019s faced this season. \u2022 The Sixers won their first game with Embiid back on Saturday against the Timberwolves 122-113, but lost to Memphis the following night (100-116) while Embiid sat the back-to-back. Without their Kia MVP candidate, the Sixers offensive rating drops from 118.2 to 105.9 and their effective field goal percentage drops from 57.8% to 51.3%. Sunday night was tied for the fifth-lowest scoring game the Sixers have had all season. \u2022 Shake Milton ranks sixth in scoring among eligible bench players, averaging 13.5 ppg in 23.8 mpg. As a team, the Sixers rank 15th in bench scoring (35.2 ppg), while the Celtics rank 26th (31.9 ppg). \u2022 With Daniel Theis being traded and Tristan Thompson out tonight due to health and safety protocols, the tall task of locking up Embiid will fall on Robert Williams III . He ranks sixth in the league in blocks (1.8 bpg) and holds opponents to 55% shooting within six feet of the basket, which is 5.8 percentage points lower than their normal average from that distance. \u2022 The Celtics are coming off home wins over Houston (+16) and Charlotte (+30) \u2014 two of their top seven biggest wins of the season. Tuesday\u2019s game against Philadelphia is the fifth game of a seven-game homestand for the Celtics, who are 15-9 at home this season compared to 10-16 on the road. The biggest difference for the Celtics at home comes on the defensive end as they allow 109.8 points per 100 possession at home ( 12th ) compared to 113.6 on the road ( 22nd ). 10 p.m. ET, TNT \u2022 The Bucks won the first meeting of the season with the Warriors, 138-99 on Christmas Day , behind Khris Middleton\u2019s 31 points in 26 minutes. Andrew Wiggins was the primary defender on Middleton for a team-high 3:08 (35.2% of Middleton\u2019s offensive matchup time) and held Middleton to two points on 0-for-3 from the field and 2-for-2 on free throws. Middleton scored 61.3% of his points over 22.4% of his offensive matchup time when being defended by either Eric Paschall (8 points, 3-for-4 FG, 2-3 3-pointers, 54 seconds matchup time) or Stephen Curry (11 points, 3-for-3 FG, 2-for-2 3-pointers, 3-for-3 free throws, 43 seconds). \u2022 During the Bucks\u2019 win on Christmas Day, they shot 20-36 (55.6%) from 3-point range as a team. There have been 17 games across the league this season in which a team has made at least 20 3-pointers while shooting 55% or better from beyond the arc \u2014 the Bucks lead the league with four such games; the Warriors have one. \u2022 The Bucks enter Tuesday ranked fifth in the league in offensive efficiency (116.4 points per 100 possessions) and second in effective field goal percentage (56.8%). They will face a Warriors team ranked ninth in defensive efficiency (110.3) and seventh in opponent effective field goal percentage (52.7%). \u2022 James Wiseman ranks fifth among eligible rookies in scoring (11.4 ppg), second in rebounds (5.8 rpg) and fourth in blocks (1.0 bpg) despite being 15th in minutes played (21.7 mpg). Wiseman scores two\/thirds (7.6 ppg) of his points in the paint , but will be facing a Bucks team that allows the third-fewest points in the paint at 42.9 per game. \u2022 This is the fifth game of a six-game road trip for the Bucks, which began on March 29 with a loss to the Clippers, followed by three straight wins against the Lakers, Kings and Blazers. The Bucks are 14-10 on the road this season, averaging 119.3 points per game (2nd) but allowing 115.1 (21st) to their opponents. Giannis Antetokounmpo averages 29.7 points and 12.0 rebounds on the road with 19 double-doubles in 23 road games. Denver\u2019s Nikola Jokic (20 in 25 games) is the only player with more road double-doubles than Giannis."},{"id":526654,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/fanduel-dfs-values-of-the-night-tuesday-apr-6","date":"2021-04-06","title":"FanDuel DFS Values Of The Night: Tuesday (Apr. 6)","content":"Zach LaVine (CHI): $7,200 at IND He hasn\u2019t delivered any monster performances as of late, but this pricing is criminal for LaVine, who\u2019s still averaged 24\/4\/4 across his last two contests. The All-Star guard is enjoying the best statistical season of his career, and it\u2019s only a matter of time until he erupts. I\u2019ll gladly take him at this depreciated price. James Johnson (NO): $5,800 at ATL With Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram out of action over the last three games, Johnson has averaged 37.1 FD points while starting all three contests. Both players are questionable tonight, and Johnson looks poised to return plenty of value once again. He\u2019s still underpriced at $5.8K. Enes Kanter (POR): $5,800 at LAC Jusuf Nurkic will miss this one, leaving Kanter to soak up minutes at center. In his last game out, Kanter went off for 12\/17\/4, and he\u2019ll look to build on that performance tonight. The big man has been highly productive for Portland this season with Nurkic on the shelf for most of the campaign. Hamidou Diallo (DET): $5,600 at DEN Across his last four games, Diallo has averaged 31.8 FD points, eclipsing the 30-point mark three times. His minutes have hovered in the mid-20s, but his ability to rebound and rack up defensive stats give him a high floor and ceiling. In the three games he went for 30 FD points, Diallo racked up at least seven boards and multiple combined blocks\/steals. Malachi Flynn (TOR): $5,100 vs. LAL Fresh off a hot performance Monday night, Flynn is back in action against the Lakers on the second of a back-to-back set. Across his last two games, he\u2019s logged at least 30 minutes in each contest while averaging 40 FD points. Last night, he went for 16\/6\/4 with three blocks and four steals, and with Kyle Lowry already ruled out and Fred VanVleet questionable, Flynn could see heavy usage again. Jaxson Hayes (NO): $4,800 at ATL Hayes has averaged 23.3 FD points across his last three contests (all without Brandon Ingram and Zion Williamson), and he should be in line for plenty of work if the pair are forced to miss tonight\u2019s game. New Orleans plays tomorrow night, so it\u2019s possible Ingram and Zion make their return then rather than playing both nights of a back-to-back. Grayson Allen (MEM): $4,700 at MIA Allen provided his second-highest FD point total of the season Sunday against Philly, and he\u2019ll look to keep the momentum going tonight in a friendly matchup with Miami. With De\u2019Anthony Melton ruled out, more minutes should be available for Allen who draws his value primarily from threes and steals. Willy Hernangomez (NO): $4,200 at ATL Hernangomez has averaged 26.4 FD points across 23 minutes in his last two games, and he should be in line for another start if Steven Adams remains out. If you\u2019re looking to pay down at center, there isn\u2019t a better bang for your buck than Hernangomez. Isaiah Stewart (DET): $3,700 at DEN With Mason Plumlee out for rest Monday, Steward delivered his best performance of the season with a 33.2 FD point effort. Plumlee should return Tuesday, but as Detroit continues to fall farther out of playoff contention, Stewart should continue to see additional run for the lottery-bound Pistons. I\u2019d be willing to take a chance in tournaments at this bottom-barrel price. Killian Hayes (DET): $3,500 at DEN In just his second game back from a lengthy absence, Hayes went off for 38.1 FD points in just 25 minutes Monday. He notably saw his playing time increase from the 19 minutes he got in his return the game prior, and he should continue to see his minutes trend up as the season goes along. Hayes is still priced at the bare minimum, and that\u2019s a salary to exploit."},{"id":526615,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/76ers-prove-they-can-stand-tall-even-without-joel-embiid","date":"2021-04-06","title":"76ers prove they can stand tall, even without big man Joel Embiid","content":"The fate of the Philadelphia 76ers took a sharp turn on March 12 when Joel Embiid fell to the floor and grabbed his bruised left knee, then again when the star center returned to the floor on April 3 and received a hearty welcome back. Or maybe the real truth was what happened in between, when Philadelphia held firm without him , bonded together and refused to allow the temporary absence of a Kia MVP candidate harpoon their season or their place in the Eastern Conference, not to mention their realistic and lofty aspirations to travel deep into summer. Yes, that 10-game stretch told us plenty about the Sixers, about Tobias Harris, about Ben Simmons and coach Doc Rivers. It also told us why Philly is still near the penthouse of the conference and warding off overthrow attempts from the Brooklyn Nets and Milwaukee Bucks. The Sixers went 7-3 without Embiid and showed the flex of a team that still must be taken seriously. \u201cWhen I got hurt, and was laying on the floor in Washington, honestly, I thought I was done,\u201d Embiid said. Maybe the same widespread belief was held about the Sixers\u2019 place in the pecking order, too. At such time, James Harden and Kyrie Irving were revving up the Nets, who tore through March despite missing their best player (Kevin Durant). Meanwhile, the Bucks \u2014 who finished with the NBA\u2019s best record the last two seasons \u2014 were aggressively seeking to reclaim a familiar spot. But as the Sixers prepare to visit the Celtics, not only did they fail to drop in the standings, but their confidence is understandably at a season-high. Plus, now Embiid is healthy and they know the rest of the rotation aced the season\u2019s biggest test so far. In the estimation of 76ers reserve center Dwight Howard, they played \u201clights out\u201d given the circumstances. Harris soared in a primary scoring role, with performances that elevated him as a premier player. Simmons showed why the Sixers refused to swap him for Harden months ago by playing admirably at both rims. Then there were those who helped \u2014 Howard, Shake Milton, Seth Curry \u2014 and had moments when their minutes, roles and importance increased minus Embiid. It was the kind of response a coach wants to see from a contender, to thrive in a moment of basketball adversity and demonstrate to their competition that they offer more than Embiid (who averaged 29.9 ppg, 11.5 rpg and 1.4 bpg in the 31 games before his injury). As Harris said: \u201cWe did a good job of holding the fort down without the big fella \u2026 I take that stuff personal when people believe we can\u2019t win [without him].\u201d Along the way were a few checkpoints where the Sixers mustered the grit and performances to pull them through, and other instances where they had good fortune. These were the most obvious: The schedule cooperates: The Sixers saw only four top-five teams in those 10 games without Embiid, and one of them was the Los Angeles Lakers without LeBron James and Anthony Davis. They lost three of those games \u2014 to the Bucks, Nuggets and LA Clippers \u2014 serving proof that they\u2019ll need Embiid to remain in title contention. There\u2019s no such thing as an ideal time to lose a player of his magnitude, but March was a month that showed mercy on the vulnerable Sixers in terms of scheduling. Tobias Harris\u2019 play: He averaged 22 ppg, 7.4 rpg and 4.3 apg in a well-rounded March and took over for Embiid as the primary scoring option, making an efficient 52.5% of his shots. That included games of 30 points against the New York Knicks (including a clutch jumper) and 29 each against the Clippers and Sacramento Kings . Harris appears to be on a redemptive journey, not only to demonstrate his worth without (and now alongside) Embiid, but because he wasn\u2019t selected as an All-Star, which didn\u2019t sit well with him. At the very least, he\u2019s a far different player than the one who struggled in the 2020 playoffs, and he\u2019ll be looking to avenge that performance, too. Ben Simmons\u2019 command: He\u2019ll never be the scorer that observers want him to be. Yet in this case, it doesn\u2019t matter, especially this year with the Sixers flush with shooters. Instead, Simmons leaned on his strengths after returning from his own absence due to health and safety protocols, and provided typically solid defense (opponents scored 101 points or less in six of the 10 games against Philly) along with the rebounding help the Sixers needed without Embiid. The 35-point wipeout win against the Spurs: Philly served notice right away by crushing San Antonio in its first game without Embiid. It was the kind of launch a team needed, at least from a psychological standpoint. Curry scored 21 in that blowout and the Sixers played with a noticeable swagger. Spurs guard Dejounte Murray remarked then: \u201cThey punched us in the face.\u201d Shake (and bake) Milton: In the 10th and final game without Embiid, Milton erupted for 27 points in 27 minutes against the Cleveland Cavaliers, displaying the firepower Philly wants from the sixth man. But he had other gems in that stretch, including 28 against the Kings and 21 against the Knicks, and March was one of his best months of 2020-21. Dwight Howard plugging the gap: Quite predictably, Howard saw an uptick in minutes at center and performed as well as could be expected, if not better in some spots. He had seven double-digit rebound games among the 10 without Embiid, including 15 against the Cavs . This was a reassuring performance for a player who helped the Lakers in a similar role last season. Once again, here in his twilight, Howard has landed a comfortable role with a team that needs him. A narrow OT loss to the Bucks: If there are silver linings in losses, the Sixers found one when they met the Bucks just two games after losing Embiid. And the Bucks needed a big finish by Giannis Antetokounmpo just to survive the 76ers in overtime . It was a meeting that easily could\u2019ve gone south for the Sixers, yet they showed plenty of spunk by sticking with the Bucks and forcing Milwaukee to pull its two-time MVP emergency cord. Finally, the Sixers won four of six in a recent road trip that preceded the return of Embiid. Rivers said \u201cthat was a heck of a trip for us\u201d and it served as the finishing touch for a team that survived Embiid\u2019s absence quite impressively. What happens from here for Philly? Well, more than the Bucks and more than the Nets, the Sixers need to grab the top playoff seed if only for confidence reasons. Rivers said as much the other day, even if there\u2019s no true home-court advantage, given the capacity-controls inside arenas. That means Embiid will fortify a team that will seek to finish strong while also attempting to reclaim his place in line for the MVP race. \u201cI know how well we play together as a team as a whole,\u201d Harris said. \u201cWe have a culture and a system here that works. When we trust it and do what is asked of us, we\u2019re a hell of a team.\u201d * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

Even as a miserable, COVID-19 displaced campaign unfolds for the Toronto Raptors in Tampa, they just \u2026 keep \u2026 hanging \u2026 on. Having traded scoring swingman Norman Powell to Portland on March 25 for Gary Trent Jr. and Rodney Hood, the Raptors lost four of five and seemed set to fall fully out of the playoff picture. And then, Trent capped a fourth-quarter rally with a game-winning buzzer-beater on Monday , and Toronto finds itself just a game out of 10th place \u2014 last to qualify for the Play-In Tournament and a chance to make some postseason noise. Don\u2019t forget most of this group still has championship experience. That counts for something. Exactly what, we\u2019ll find out by season\u2019s end. GAME SITUATION: The Wizards won each of the first three quarters, entering the fourth with an 11-point margin and Russell Westbrook well on his way to yet another triple-double (final line: 23 points, 14 rebounds, 11 assists). With the Wizards going cold from range \u2014 missing 13 straight 3-pointers at one point \u2014 the Raptors raced out at the beginning of the quarter, eventually snatching a 91-90 lead and creating a battle the rest of the way. Westbrook tied things at 98 with two minutes remaining, and then put the Wizards up one with a 3-pointer that left 41.1 seconds on the clock. Toronto turned it over on a Pascal Siakam charging call, the Wizards\u2019 Raul Neto missed a layup and Trent grabbed the rebound with 4.4 seconds on the clock and room to run. Initiate final sequence. DIFFICULTY: With a live rebound and no timeouts, Trent needed to cover ground to give Toronto a chance. One quick left-to-right crossover opened a lane to the top of the opposite end of the logo, and a hard right-to-left behind-the-back dribble (perhaps aided by a little nudge) cleared the room for a pullup 3-pointer as time expired. It swished clean. CELEBRATION: The ball dropped through the net into De\u2019Andre Bembry\u2019s hand, he immediately slammed the ball into the hardwood, sending it skyrocketing as the team rushed to embrace Trent near midcourt, where he was shouting into the stands. Chest bumps and pounds all around from there. Amped. GRADE: The race upcourt against the clock is never easy, and Trent didn\u2019t get \u2014 or need \u2014 any help to free space for the 3-pointer. If Toronto somehow salvages a postseason run, this single shot might loom large. 3.5 Horrys"},{"id":526266,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/james-harden-exits-vs-knicks-with-leg-injury","date":"2021-04-06","title":"James Harden exits vs. Knicks with leg injury","content":"In an inter-borough matchup between the Brooklyn Nets and the New York Knicks, the Nets were stripped of one of their superstars before halftime.

The 50-year-old Davis played for the Tar Heels under Dean Smith before a long NBA career, and he spent the past nine seasons working under Williams. The school announced the hiring Monday after an emergency meeting by its board of trustees. UNC is planning an introductory news conference for Davis on Tuesday. \u201cI love this university,\u201d Davis said in a statement. \u201cI played here, I earned my degree here, I fell in love with my wife here, I got married here, I moved here after I retired from the NBA and I have raised my family here. I am proud to lead this team, and I can\u2019t wait for all that comes next.\u201d Williams retired last week after 18 seasons at his alma mater in a career that also included 15 years at Kansas and 903 overall victories. All three of his NCAA championships came with the Tar Heels. The school has long had a history of turning to people with UNC ties to lead its program, which owns six NCAA championships and ranks among college basketball\u2019s all-time wins leaders. It has worked before, with longtime assistant Bill Guthridge taking over after Smith\u2019s 1997 retirement and leading the Tar Heels to two Final Fours, as well as Williams\u2019 return from Kansas in 2003. But it didn\u2019t work during the three-year tumultuous tenure of Matt Doherty \u2013 including an 8-20 season in 2002 \u2013 after Williams turned down the job following Guthridge\u2019s retirement in 2000. The Tar Heels are staying in the \u201cCarolina family\u201d again, this time by turning to a trusted former player who has never been a college head coach. His hiring also marks a groundbreaking moment as the first Black coach in the history of the program. \u201cI am honored and humbled to be given the opportunity to lead this program,\u201d Davis said. \u201cI would not be here without Coach Dean Smith, Coach Bill Guthridge and Coach Roy Williams; they taught me so much \u2013 and I\u2019m eager to walk their path in my shoes and with my personality.\u201d Davis had been on Williams\u2019 staff since 2012 as a bench coach, recruiter and scout, including a run to the 2016 NCAA title game and then the championship a year later. He had also served as head coach of the UNC junior varsity program and oversaw the program\u2019s charitable endeavors. Davis, the nephew of former UNC player and NBA All-Star Walter Davis, played for Smith from 1988-92 and still holds the program record for career 3-point percentage (.435). He was part of two Atlantic Coast Conference Tournament championships as a player as well as scoring 25 points in a 1991 Final Four loss against a Kansas team led by Williams. Davis went onto become a first-round NBA draft pick by the New York Knicks and spent a dozen seasons in the league. After his playing career, Davis spent seven years with ESPN as a college basketball analyst until Williams asked Davis to join his staff in 2012 \u2014 which Davis said at the time was \u201ca total surprise.\u201d Now it\u2019s up to Davis to keep the Tar Heels among the nation\u2019s elite programs.

Holiday pretty much knew he wanted to stay in Milwaukee for years to come once he spoke to team officials shortly after they paid a steep price to acquire him. General manager Jon Horst made it apparent how much the Bucks valued the veteran guard. \u201cI feel like you can tell when somebody\u2019s like super excited or happy about something, and you could hear it in his voice,\u201d Holiday said Monday, one day after agreeing to terms on a four-year extension that would be worth at least $134 million if he exercises his option for the final season. \u201cAt that point, I\u2019m like, \u2018Man, he really wanted me to be here.\u2019 \u201cI\u2019m really not the type to be wooed and all that. I don\u2019t need to be courted or whatever, but it felt good to be appreciated. It felt good to be wanted.\u201d \"I'm a Buck for life.\" \u2013 @jrue_holiday11  pic.twitter.com\/wTVog8z7fc \u2014 Milwaukee Bucks (@Bucks) April 4, 2021 Under the terms of his new deal, Holiday receives base salaries of $30.1 million next season, $32.4 million in 2022-23 and $34.7 million in 2023-24. He also holds a $37 million option for 2024-25. There are incentives that could push the total value of Holiday\u2019s deal to nearly $160 million. The 30-year-old said his teammates reinforced his desire to stay in Milwaukee. \u201cNot just on the court, but off the court, how my teammates, how they are, just great people,\u201d Holiday said. \u201cMade me feel like family. You want to be around them. You want to have that type of character around you and your family. They made it an easy decision.\u201d The Bucks acquired Holiday from the New Orleans Pelicans in November as part of a four-team trade. Milwaukee gave up guards Eric Bledsoe and George Hill, first-round draft choice R.J. Hampton and two future first-round draft picks. The Bucks also acquired Sam Merrill and gave New Orleans the right to swap two future first-round picks. The Bucks believe the 6-foot-3 Holiday has been worth the price. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can kind of appreciate the strength and physicality he brings to both ends of the court until you get to see it night in and night out,\u201d coach Mike Budenholzer said. \u201cWhat he does defensively, takes on different matchups, different-sized guys, you hear about it and everybody talks about it and everything, so you have this expectation, but once you\u2019re around it, it\u2019s even more impressive.\u201d Holiday is averaging 17 points, 5.4 assists, 4.6 rebounds and 1.8 steals this season. He was named the Eastern Conference player of the week Monday after averaging 26.8 points, 8.5 assists, 5.8 rebounds and 2.5 steals over his last four games, all on the road. The perfect way to cap a great week. pic.twitter.com\/0ecayuKa8C \u2014 Milwaukee Bucks (@Bucks) April 5, 2021 He\u2019s been an equally big contributor off the court. Holiday received an NBA Cares community assist award in January for his efforts to support people impacted by the pandemic. Holiday agreed to his deal less than four months after the Bucks signed two-time reigning MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo to a supermax extension. The franchise\u2019s investment in Holiday, Antetokounmpo and two-time All-Star Khris Middleton \u2014 even without incentives \u2014 adds up to $105 million in 2021-22 and $113 million in 2022-23. That figure would reach $120 million in 2023-24 if Middleton exercises an option he has for that season. Holiday believes that commitment should enable the Bucks to contend for years to come as they chase their first NBA title since 1971. As the Bucks prepared to play at Golden State on Tuesday, Holiday compared Milwaukee\u2019s situation to how the Warriors assembled their championship teams. \u201cThey built together for so long and they won together for so long that I feel like it kind of came to a point where they were just this well-oiled machine and knew each other and knew how things were going to go,\u201d Holiday said. \u201cYeah, I feel like that\u2019s what I want to be a part of.\u201d"},{"id":526190,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/dangelo-russell-set-to-return-vs-kings-after-missing-26-games","date":"2021-04-05","title":"D'Angelo Russell set to return vs. Kings after missing 26 games","content":"Minnesota Timberwolves guard D\u2019Angelo Russell will return to the floor against the Sacramento Kings on Monday, the team confirmed.

Not only is it the longest active streak in the league, it is Utah\u2019s third streak of at least nine straight wins this season. No other team has won more than eight in a row (Atlanta, Brooklyn, Milwaukee). During their current streak (which dates back to March 19), Donovan Mitchell has averaged 28.1 points on 53.1%-51.6%-95.3% shooting splits, while Rudy Gobert has averaged 15.7 ppg on 68.9% shooting, 12.0 rpg and 3.3 bpg. Utah has outscored its opponents by 166 points in Gobert\u2019s 267 minutes on court during the streak. On Monday, the Jazz face a Mavericks squad that has won four straight games for the fourth time this season, but is still searching for a five-game win streak. Dallas is also looking for its first win over Utah as the Jazz swept a two-game series in late January. Portland at LA Clippers  10 p.m. ET, NBA League Pass As Week 16 begins, we are in the final third of the 2020-21 regular season as 68.2% of the schedule has already been played. With the race to the playoffs in full swing, there is plenty to keep an eye on, from the battles among the top seeds for home-court advantage, to the race to get in the Play-In Tournament among the No. 7-10 seeds in each conference. If the playoffs began today , the third-ranked Clippers and sixth-ranked Blazers would meet in the first round. The Clippers won the first meeting of the season with the Blazers, 128-105 on Dec. 30 in LA, behind Kawhi Leonards 28-point effort. Tuesday is the second of three regular season games between these teams with a potential playoff matchup looming. While Damian Lillard ranks second in the league in scoring (29.6 ppg), he has been held in check by the Clippers over the past two seasons with Paul George and Leonard on the squad. In four games, Lillard has averaged 20 points on 36.0% (27-75) shooting from the field and 18.9% (7-37) from three as the Blazers have lost all four games. Is Dame ready for a breakout game against LA? New York at Boston  7:30 p.m. ET, NBA League Pass The Knicks and Celtics enter Week 16 at 25-25 and ranked seventh and eighth, respectively, in the Eastern Conference standings. The addition of the Play-In Tournament adds multiple races to watch. Not only do you have teams doing whatever they can do to finish in the top 10 in order to qualify for the tournament and keep their playoff hopes alive, you also have the teams in the No. 5-8 range looking to finish in the top six in order to guarantee their playoff berth and avoid having to survive the Play-In. The latter group is where the Knicks and Celtics currently live. If the season ended today, they would meet in the Play-In Tournament, but the East standings so crowded (currently there are only three games separating No. 4 and No. 9) there is an opportunity to climb the standings and lock up a playoff spot. With so many teams in this race, head-to-head games like Wednesday\u2019s game between the Celtics and Knicks take on the added importance of potential tiebreakers; New York leads the season series 1-0 with two more games yet to be played, including the final game of the regular season. Milwaukee at Dallas  9 p.m. ET, NBA League Pass The Bucks held Giannis Antetokounmpo (left knee soreness) out of the lineup against Sacramento on Saturday, but the Bucks still got the win thanks to a season-high 33 points (as well as 11 assists) from Jrue Holiday, who signed a four-year contract extension one day later. Giannis is not expected to miss extended time, so he should be available to join Holiday and the rest of the squad when they take on Luka Doncic and the Mavericks on Thursday. Giannis is 3-1 in head-to-head games with Doncic, including their first meeting this season on Jan. 15. Giannis finished with 31 points on 14-21 shooting and nine rebounds, while Doncic recorded one of nine triple-doubles this season with 28 points, 13 assists and 10 rebounds in the loss. Both teams enter Week 16 riding win streaks \u2014 three in a row for Milwaukee and four in a row for Dallas. Philadelphia at New Orleans  8 p.m. ET, NBA League Pass After missing 10 games due to a bone bruise in his left knee, Joel Embiid return to the Sixers on Saturday and finished with 24 points, eight rebounds and three blocks in 29 minutes in a win over Minnesota. Tobias Harris continued his strong play as he led the Sixers with 32 points on 13-17 (76.5%) shooting from the field, 66.7% (2-3) from 3-point range and 100% (4-4) from the free throw line. Harris needs to raise his free throw percentage by just 0.1% to be in the 50-40-90 shooting club . If he could finish the season hitting those marks he would join an exclusive club that includes only eight NBA players. Speaking of shooting efficiency, the Sixers will face Zion Williamson and the Pelicans on Friday. Williamson ranks sixth in the league in field goal percentage as he connects on 62.4% of his shots (444-712). Williamson is on pace to make over 500 field goals this season. If he does and maintains this level of efficiency, he would become only the third player to ever shoot at least 62% from the field while making 500 field goals in a season, joining Hall of Famers Artis Gilmore (four times) and Wilt Chamberlain (one time). Washington at Phoenix  10 p.m. ET, NBA League Pass The Suns enter Week 16 sitting 3 1\/2 games back of the top-seeded Jazz in the West. While the Suns have won five straight , they have been unable to make up any ground since the Jazz have won nine straight games. Phoenix has built a 2 1\/2 game cushion over the No. 3 Clippers as they look to solidify their playoff position. On the opposite side of the playoff spectrum are the Washington Wizards, who have dropped three straight games and find themselves on the outside looking in at the East Play-In. Bradley Beal has not played since March 27 with a right hip contusion and the Wizards have gone just 1-3 in his absence. He is questionable for Monday, but hopefully will be healthy come Saturday. Beal scored 34 points against Phoenix in their first meeting on Jan. 11 as the Wizards handed the Suns their second-biggest loss of the season (21 points). Beal edged out Devin Booker (33) in the individual scoring battle and the Wizards were able to get the win even with Russell Westbrook out of the lineup."},{"id":526124,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/kings-buddy-hield-fined-25000-by-nba","date":"2021-04-05","title":"Kings' Buddy Hield fined $25,000 by NBA","content":"NEW YORK \u2014 Sacramento Kings guard Buddy Hield has been fined $20,000 for directing inappropriate language toward game officials, it was announced today by Kiki VanDeWeghe, Executive Vice President, Basketball Operations.

The Celtics certainly lost a huge piece this offseason when Gordon Hayward went to Charlotte. The Heat lost Jae Crowder from last year\u2019s playoff rotation and dealt with injuries and COVID-related absences early in the season. The Raptors lost to more players from their championship core and had their own battle with COVID. But most of what made those teams great last season was still there. And the rest of the Eastern Conference wasn\u2019t exactly taking advantage of the struggles in Boston, Miami and Tampa. But here we are in April and those No. 4, 5 and 6 seeds are still very much up for grabs. The Heat have won four straight games to climb into fifth, and maybe this is them finding their rhythm. But they made this move a month ago before losing six straight. The Celtics haven\u2019t been as streaky, but have also teased with some quality wins. The Raptors, meanwhile, just can\u2019t win close games, now 19-30 with a positive point differential. The Atlanta Hawks (12-4 since March 1), Charlotte Hornets (seemingly bound for a slide with Gordon Hayward\u2019s foot injury ), and New York Knicks (with a difficult remaining schedule) are all in the mix, but not as proven as the teams that fought for the conference title last year.

But this of course is 2020-21, a break from the norm, where instead a Play-In Tournament will begin in a little more than month. In case you forgot, the NBA seized upon this novelty of last fall and made it a staple. Which means, before the intensity of the playoffs, the league will present the super-intensity of the Play-In Tournament on May 18-21, where four teams in each conference will either see their season go up in smoke, or toward the next step, in a matter of days. Here\u2019s a reminder about the Play-In Tournament \u2014 May Madness, if you will: The teams with the seventh- and eight-best records in the regular season will meet. The winner of that game is officially the seventh place finisher. The teams with the ninth- and 10th-best records will also meet. The loser is done for the year. The winner plays the loser of the No. 7 vs. No. 8 game, and the winner of that game claims the eighth and final playoff spot. Essentially, the key is finishing among the top six in the conference and avoiding such a tournament. Or at the very least, avoid falling to nine or 10 and needing to win twice to get a playoff spot. For the purpose of this analysis, we\u2019ll take stock of the teams holding at least 12th place at the moment. In the East, with the Nets, Bucks and 76ers sitting at considerable distance from everyone else, we\u2019ll examine several teams behind them, who are bunched together and separated by only a few games. In the West, there\u2019s a reasonable margin between sixth and seventh, so we\u2019ll sneak-preview teams 7 through 12. And this list is in no particular order: Miami Heat: There\u2019s no question who stands the most to lose by being forced into a Play-In, or worse, missing the playoffs altogether. Not only did the Heat reach The Finals last season and haven\u2019t suffered a major injury this season, but they just added Victor Oladipo on the cheap. It\u2019s hard to find an excuse should Miami fall into a late-season bind, or a reason for the Heat to even be in an elimination tourney. If a team with Oladipo, Bam Adebayo, Jimmy Butler, Tyler Herro, Duncan Robinson, Trevor Ariza, Andre Iguodala and Goran Dragic manages to fall short \u2014 in the East, no less \u2014 it\u2019d be a crime against basketball. It would also mark the first time an Erik Spoelstra team underachieved. New York Knicks: Gotham is giddy over the Knicks being in playoff contention this late into the season. Even if they fall into a Play-In situation, it would mean progress for a franchise looking to shake free of a lost decade. New York, more than most teams, is being compared to its recent past, so what it is showing now is positive. Julius Randle doesn\u2019t appear to be a one-hit wonder and RJ Barrett is emerging as a top second option. After that, whoever emerges from the rest of the rotation is anyone\u2019s guess, although their defense is keeping them in contention. The Knicks have a scary stretch run on the schedule \u2014 from May 5-16, they play the Nuggets, Suns, both LA teams, the Spurs, Hornets and Celtics. If they\u2019re at .500 or hauling a losing record before playing those games, that could mean big trouble. Dallas Mavericks: The probability of Dallas being in the Play-In tourney is high as it seems unlikely to rise to six or drop out of the picture. Assuming that\u2019s the case, the Mavs need to start loading up on the help around Luka Doncic. For starters, Kristaps Porzingis is searching for consistency and it would help if he shows better results near the rim at both ends of the floor. The lack of a great high-volume 3-point shooter hurts a team that leans so heavily on Doncic isolations (he\u2019s fifth in the NBA in total isolation plays). Tim Hardaway Jr. can be that player on some nights, but he\u2019s streaky. That means the Mavericks will go as far as Doncic takes them \u2014 which at this point looks like the seventh seed. Boston Celtics: Do you think the Celtics awaken some mornings in a cold sweat over a nightmare that had them sitting on the fence in the playoff picture, only to rub their eyes and realize it was no nightmare? No doubt, the Celtics are wondering why they\u2019re still in this position with several weeks left to play. But such is the somber reality for a team despite two All-Stars. The good news is they\u2019re one winning streak away from rising as high as fourth place and away from the desperate pack. Does Evan Fournier help them shake free of the slumber? They\u2019ll need him and better efficiency from Kemba Walker (39.7% shooting, his worst since 2014-15) and a quick study by Robert Williams to spare themselves the indignity of the Play-In. Everyone expects the Celtics to eventually figure it out. But, they\u2019ve been mediocre for a while now and the longer they stay trapped in this reality, the riskier it gets for their chances. San Antonio Spurs: They missed the playoffs last season for the first time in 23 seasons. Miss it again, and it\u2019s suddenly a different kind of streak. The Spurs are indeed a dangerous team because DeMar DeRozan (21.1 ppg, 7.2 apg) is hooping and the young core around him is maturing. Also, coach Gregg Popovich hasn\u2019t suddenly forgotten how to lead a team to the postseason. If Dejounte Murray, Derrick White and Lonnie Walker keep improving, the Spurs would be the team nobody wants to see in the Play-In. Atlanta Hawks: Atlanta suddenly became a healthier team once coach Lloyd Pierce was fired, which was bad for Pierce, good for the Hawks\u2019 chances of grabbing a top-six guaranteed playoff spot. It helps, too, that Trae Young seemingly is playing more under control under interim coach Nate McMillan. And of course, that John Collins is playing for money. With Young, Collins, Danilo Gallinari, Kevin Huerter, Bogdan Bogdanovic and the newly-arrived Lou Williams, the Hawks bring shooters every night. And, they have Clint Capela (15.1 ppg, 14.2 rpg) around to clean up their misses and provide rim protection (2.3 bpg). Although the Hawks won eight straight recently, their surge came courtesy of a soft schedule. And speaking of cushy, the Hawks\u2019 final 16 games includes playing the Pacers, Wizards and Magic twice and the Rockets once. Things are set up perfectly for Atlanta to avoid the Play-In or, at worst, grab the seventh seed. Indiana Pacers: It doesn\u2019t appear that TJ Warren is going to be around to bail them out, which means the Pacers must figure how to reverse a disappointing season on their own. Maybe they will, with Caris LeVert healthy and becoming more comfortable with his new surroundings. As much as Myles Turner has regressed offensively, he\u2019s making a legit run for the All-Defensive team, or maybe Kia Defensive Player of the Year , with his rim-protection. This is a team comprised mostly of role players \u2014 Justin Holiday, Doug McDermott, TJ McConnell \u2014 who do their jobs fairly well. However, it just isn\u2019t reflected in the standings. Time for Domantas Sabonis and Malcolm Brogdon to up their game, if possible, to put the Pacers in a better place. Memphis Grizzlies: They\u2019ve held it together all season while waiting for big man Jaren Jackson Jr. to heal from knee surgery. And now, Jackson is poised to make that long-awaited debut this month. Then we\u2019ll see how long it takes him to whip into game shape and resume the pace he set for himself as one of the league\u2019s bright young talents. If he starts quickly and looks comfortable, the Grizzlies can make a serious run up the standings. The ceiling for Jackson and Ja Morant is probably seventh place, and that would make for a solid finish. This is a team with some upside because of Jackson, and that makes the Grizzlies dangerous and probably a favorite in a Play-In. Chicago Bulls: They declared themselves all-in with the midseason trade for Nikola Vucevic \u2026 and then went into a tailspin and fell to 10th place. Hopefully for Chicago\u2019s sake, this is a temporary condition. There\u2019s nothing to be gained by missing the playoffs, and evidently the Bulls believe so, because that\u2019s why they added a second All-Star next to Zach LaVine. He and Vucevic seem compatible on the floor, so now it\u2019s up to the supporting cast to fall in line. The Bulls are encouraged by the improved results from Lauri Markkanen and rookie Patrick Williams, along with the steady play of veteran Thaddeus Young. Now that they\u2019ve pressed the accelerator with the trade, it would seem weird \u2014 and certainly disappointing \u2014 if the Bulls remain in 10th and be required to fight for their playoff lives. Charlotte Hornets: Until LaMelo Ball grabbed his wrist in pain, and a foot flared for Gordon Hayward, everything was swell \u2026 and then it was swollen. The Hornets didn\u2019t exactly fold when their entertaining rookie went down last month, but their position in the East did take a precarious turn when Hayward\u2019s injury doubled their trouble. And now, a playoff spot can\u2019t be taken for granted for a team that hasn\u2019t had one in five seasons. Assuming that Hayward recovers in time and Terry Rozier continues to play solid ball, the fate of the Hornets could fall to youngsters like Devonte\u2019 Graham and Malik Monk. Both are playing for contracts, and in the case of Graham, his play has gone up a tick since winter and he\u2019s easing the sting of losing Ball. It would be surprising if the Hornets fall into the Play-In Tournament, but all it\u2019ll take is an unfortunate losing streak. They\u2019re a lot closer to 10th place than third place. Golden State Warriors: OK, sure, when you lose by 53 to Toronto (as the Warriors did on April 2 ), you don\u2019t look like a playoff or Play-In Tournament team. But keep in mind, the Warriors still have Stephen Curry, and he\u2019s the most accomplished and decorated player of anyone whose team is outside of the top-six spots in the West. That means not only are the Warriors unlikely to fall beyond 10th place, but they\u2019d be very dangerous in a Play-In because of Curry. That said, even being in that position would be weird for a team not long removed from a championship dynasty. Yes, this was supposed to be a holding-pattern season while waiting on Klay Thompson to heal. But right now, by sitting on the edge of playoff contention, the Warriors find themselves in a worst-case scenario \u2014 and can only hope their next step won\u2019t be on a banana peel. Toronto Raptors: The Raptors were ready for the plug to be pulled when Kyle Lowry was dangled at the trade deadline, but the franchise icon was never dealt and so here they are. In order to be taken seriously, the Raptors will need to go all 2019 on everyone and rip off an eight-game winning streak. That\u2019s not to suggest a team with Pascal Siakam and Fred VanVleet and newcomer Gary Trent Jr. are incapable of doing so \u2026 it just would be so unlike them in 2020-21. They\u2019d better make their move soon, or else. Washington Wizards: The Wizards briefly showed a heartbeat when they won eight of 11 games in February, only to disappear again \u2014 perhaps for good. The Bradley Beal-Russell Westbrook tandem never gained traction in terms of making a difference in the standings, while Davis Bertans failed pay dividends after cashing in last offseason. Still, 10th place is within reach, and if they claim that spot, Beal and Westbrook could erupt and pull a surprise or two. Sacramento Kings: The Kings were ready to be buried, and then they awakened in mid-March to win seven of eight games and delay (if not cancel) the funeral. Harrison Barnes has elevated his game, and when you combine him with De\u2019Aaron Fox and Buddy Hield, it\u2019s not as if the Kings are lacking in scorers. They\u2019ll probably put up the good fight, maybe right until the end, even if they don\u2019t make a serious claim for the 10th spot. New Orleans Pelicans: New Orleans is actually outside the top 10 in April? Yes, such is the case despite a pair of young foundational forwards in Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram, who combine for roughly 50 ppg. To date, the Pelicans qualify as a disappointment and may finish the season with that distinction. But even in the West \u2014 where the competition is steep, even near the bottom \u2014 the Pelicans can\u2019t be counted out quickly because they have such vast firepower. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

The move represents the latest step in the Bucks\u2019 heavy investment in their trio of Holiday, two-time reigning MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo and two-time All-Star Khris Middleton as the franchise chases its first NBA title since 1971. \u201cJrue is one of the top guards in the NBA and we are thrilled to sign him to this extension,\u201d Bucks general manager Jon Horst said in a statement Sunday. \u201cAdding him to our team has made us better on both ends of the floor. He\u2019s an elite defender and an impactful offensive player with the ability to score, shoot and facilitate.\u201d Holiday had a $26.7 million player option remaining for the 2021-21 season as part of the five-year, $126 million contract he signed with the New Orleans Pelicans in July 2017. Under the terms of this deal, Holiday declines that option but receives base salaries of $30.1 million next season, $32.4 million in 2022-23 and $34.7 million in 2023-24. He also holds a $37 million option for 2024-25. There are incentives that could push the total value of Holiday\u2019s deal to nearly $160 million. The Bucks\u2019 investment in Holiday, Antetokounmpo and Middleton \u2014 even without incentives \u2014 totals $105 million in 2021-22, $113 million in 2022-23 and would be $120 million in 2023-24 if Middleton exercises a player option he has for that season. The 30-year-old Holiday is averaging 17 points, 5.4 assists, 4.6 rebounds and 1.8 steals this year in his first season with the Bucks. He ranks second in the league in steals per game. The only other NBA players averaging at least 16 points, five assists, four rebounds and 1.5 steals this season are Miami\u2019s Jimmy Butler, Denver\u2019s Nikola Joki\u0107 and Toronto\u2019s Fred VanVleet. Milwaukee paid a heavy price to acquire Holiday in the offseason as it attempted to strengthen the team in hopes of getting a long-term commitment from Antetokounmpo, who signed a five-year supermax extension worth a reported $228 million in December. The Bucks gave up guards Eric Bledsoe and George Hill, first-round draft choice R.J. Hampton and two future first-round draft picks as part of the four-team trade. They also acquired second-round pick Sam Merrill and gave New Orleans the right to swap two future first-round picks as part of the deal. This extension comes at a time when Holiday is playing his best basketball of the season. The 6-foot-3 guard has scored at least 22 points in each of his last four games. He had 33 points, 11 assists and seven rebounds Saturday as the Bucks won 129-128 at Sacramento without Antetokounmpo, who sat out with a sore left knee."},{"id":525406,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/tune-in-tidbits-abc-sunday-april-4-2021","date":"2021-04-04","title":"Tune-In Tidbits: ABC Sunday, April 4, 2021","content":"Lakers (31-18) at Clippers (32-18)  3:30 p.m. ET, ABC \u2022 The Clippers won the first meeting of the season with the Lakers, 116-109 on opening night after the Lakers received their 2019-20 championship rings.

If there was ever a matchup to kick start his offense, this would be it, as the Cavaliers are surrendering the third-most FanDuel points to opposing guards this season. Hamidou Diallo (DET) $6,100 Diallo is starting to find his groove in Detroit after being acquired earlier this month. He\u2019s averaged just under 40 FanDuel points over his last two games and should be good to go after being rested during Thursday\u2019s game against the Wizards. Mason Plumlee (DET) $6,100 Staying in Detroit for this one, Plumlee is coming off a near triple-double performance in Thursday\u2019s win over the Wizards, where he finished with 41.7 FanDuel points. While the Knicks have played inspiring defense this season, they have been awful against opposing big men, surrendering the fourth-most FanDuel points to centers. Rui Hachimura (WAS): $6,000 Hachimura has been amazing outside of Thursday\u2019s 10-point dud, and he\u2019s been one of the biggest beneficiaries in Bradley Beal\u2019s absence. If Beal is forced to sit once more on Saturday, Hachimura could be the focal point of the Wizards attack alongside Russell Westbrook against a Mavericks team playing on the road in the second night of a back-to-back set. Dallas also just so happens to allow the fifth-most FanDuel points per game to opposing small forwards this season. Buddy Hield (SAC) $5,800 Hield is nearly $700 lower than his season average, and Saturday\u2019s game against the Bucks is currently set at the highest over-under on the slate. He had a rough outing in Friday\u2019s loss to the Lakers, so he\u2019ll be looking to rebound in a big way on Saturday. T.J. McConnell (IND) $4,900 This call is solely tied to the status of Malcolm Brogdon, who was forced to miss Friday\u2019s loss to the Hornets. McConnell becomes a lock priced less than $5,000 if Brogdon is forced to sit again, as he\u2019s averaging 1.04 FanDuel points per minute in 628 minutes without Brogdon on the floor this season. Not to mention the Spurs are giving up the third-most FanDuel points per game to opposing point guards throughout the season. Jaden McDaniels (MIN) $4,900 McDaniels has been impressive over the last week, averaging 13.2 points, 4.0 rebounds and 1.4 blocks over his last five games. While Philadelphia has been a tough matchup for opposing power forwards this season, McDaniels is a fantastic upside play priced below $5,000. Dean Wade (CLE) $4,600 Wade has quietly been productive over the last two weeks, scoring at least 22 FanDuel points in six of his last seven games. He\u2019s coming off of a 31.6 point outing on Thursday and should continue to see more time with Larry Nance Jr. ruled out Saturday. Robin Lopez (WAS) $4,500 While Alex Len has been getting the starting nod, Lopez has been the better fantasy player over the last week. He\u2019s averaging just under 30 FanDuel points over his last two games and gets a Mavericks squad on the road in the second leg of a back-to-back set. Jordan McLaughlin (MIN) $3,600 McLaughlin was given the starting nod for the injured Ricky Rubio on Friday and played 33 minutes in the loss. If Rubio is forced to miss Saturday\u2019s game as well, McLaughlin should be a lock for 5x value priced at only $3,600. This call does come with some risk, but he presents a solid floor with room for upside."},{"id":524969,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/grant-hill-selected-as-managing-director-of-usa-basketball","date":"2021-04-03","title":"USA Basketball picks Grant Hill as Colangelo's replacement","content":"Grant Hill helped the U.S. win Olympic gold in 1996. He would have been on the team again in 2000 if not for injury. And he was among the college kids who famously beat the first \u201cDream Team\u201d in a scrimmage before the 1992 Olympics. Now, USA Basketball is bringing him back. Hill will become the men\u2019s national team managing director following the Tokyo Olympics, USA Basketball said Saturday. He\u2019ll replace the retiring Jerry Colangelo, in a move where one Basketball Hall of Famer takes over for another in the critical role of assembling teams that will compete for gold. \u201cIt\u2019s just an incredible opportunity, also an incredible challenge,\u201d Hill said Saturday. \u201cI had the good fortune of participating in international play \u2014 the Pan American Games, of course the Olympic team \u2014 and I have been a fan of Team USA going back to the 1984 Olympic team when I first started to fall in love with basketball. The more I thought about it, the more intrigued, excited and the more willing I was to roll up my sleeves and move forward with this awesome responsibility.\u201d Hill\u2019s resume is elite. He played 19 NBA seasons, was an All-Star seven times \u2014 likely would have been more if not for the ankle problems that derailed his career \u2014 and made five All-NBA teams. At Duke, he helped the Blue Devils win national championships in 1991 and 1992. Hill went into the Hall of Fame in 2018 and has worked as an NBA and college basketball analyst for Turner Sports for nearly a decade. And he\u2019s part of the broadcast team for the men\u2019s Final Four this weekend in Indianapolis, the sixth straight year he\u2019s been on that crew. He will remain in broadcasting after assuming his USA Basketball job. \u201cGrant is a proven leader of consequence and character who will continue to help us achieve on our twin goals of winning international competitions and representing our country with honor,\u201d USA Basketball Board of Directors chair and retired Gen. Martin Dempsey said. \u201cIn making this announcement, I also want to emphasize how much everyone associated with USA Basketball appreciates Jerry Colangelo for everything he did for USA Basketball over the past 15 years.\u201d And Colangelo did plenty. The managing director role was created for him in 2005, after the Americans lost three games in the 2004 Athens Olympics and returned with an extremely disappointing bronze medal. Colangelo has since overseen the process of selecting players and coaches, bringing in Duke\u2019s Mike Krzyzewski \u2014 who led the U.S. to Olympic golds in 2008, 2012 and 2016 \u2014 and now San Antonio\u2019s Gregg Popovich to serve as head coaches. In major competitions with Colangelo as managing director, the U.S. men have gone 97-4. Colangelo\u2019s departure was not unexpected; the 80-year-old made no secret of his plans to retire after the Tokyo Games, which were delayed one year to this summer because of the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cI intend to spend an incredible amount of time with Jerry, shadow him some this summer, and I think that experience will certainly help as we move forward,\u201d Hill said. \u201cHe\u2019s just an invaluable resource and has done a remarkable job, so you can\u2019t help but learn from someone like Jerry.\u201d No matter what happens in Tokyo, Hill will take over at a hectic time. The delay of these Olympics compresses everything; the next Basketball World Cup is only two years away and the Paris Games are just three years out. Hill knows the rest of the world is catching \u2014 or has caught \u2014 up to USA Basketball. He predicted that would happen in 1996, when he was part of Dream Team II that won the gold in Atlanta, and isn\u2019t alone in the belief that the game found a new gear internationally because of the success of the first Dream Team four years prior. Hill was a 19-year-old college sophomore when he was brought in along with Bobby Hurley, Chris Webber and others to scrimmage the U.S. team that featured Michael Jordan, Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, Patrick Ewing and more. The college kids won 62-54 in that first scrimmage; debate has raged since about whether U.S. coach Chuck Daly threw the game to make a point that no team was unbeatable, but there is no debate about how that day in California helped the NBA stars come together. \u201cWe had a good moment,\u201d Hill said. \u201cThat experience \u2014 having a chance to practice with, learn from, spend time with arguably the greatest team ever assembled \u2014 it wasn\u2019t a formal even with a medal ceremony and the like, but it certainly was a pivotal moment for me and my development and my growth as a player.\u201d Hill\u2019s job that day was to beat USA Basketball\u2019s best. His job going forward will be to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen. He\u2019s already starting to plan. \u201cThe brain is working,\u201d Hill said."},{"id":524945,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/space-jam-2-trailer-released","date":"2021-04-03","title":"LeBron James introduced in new trailer for 'Space Jam: A New Legacy'","content":"With the release date nearly two months away, the official trailer for \u201cSpace Jam: A New Legacy\u2033 is now available.

The junior guard is playing his best at just the right time, leading the Bruins into the Final Four for the first time since 2008. Juzang also has had a much broader impact, even if it\u2019s been unintentional. Projected to be the first Asian American NBA first-round pick, possibly in the lottery, he\u2019s become an inspiration for younger players at a time when hate crimes against Asian Americans are on the rise. \u201cIt\u2019s not something that\u2019s on the top of my mind or really think about. I\u2019m just Johnny,\u201d said Juzang, who\u2019s mother is Vietnamese. \u201cI will get messages or hear stories about how I inspire people, regardless of their heritage. Sometimes there are people of Asian decent. But just being able to inspire people is something that\u2019s touching and inspires me and something I don\u2019t take lightly.\u201d Juzang\u2019s older brother Christian played at Harvard and led the Saigon Heat to the 2020 championship in the Vietnamese Basketball Association. Christian was the top pick in the VBA draft, and the younger Juzang looks like he has an even brighter professional future. He has thrived on the court since transferring to Westwood. A former five-star recruit, the 6-foot-6 guard was a role player on a loaded Kentucky team, averaging 2.9 points and 1.9 assists in 28 games as a freshman. Not long after the coronavirus pandemic shut down the season, Juzang announced he was transferring and later picked UCLA to be closer to his family in Tarzana, California. Juzang missed the first four games of the 2020-21 season with a foot injury, but he is a big reason the Bruins were able to overcome senior Chris Smith\u2019s season-ending knee injury in early January. Juzang was the Bruins\u2019 leading scorer at 15.5 points per game while shooting 34% from the 3-point arc and seemed to get better as the season progressed. He scored at least 20 points three times in the NCAA Tournament, including 28 against Michigan to clinch a spot in the Final Four. And he\u2019s done it on an ankle that\u2019s been bothering him for weeks. \u201cHe\u2019s more of a scorer than a shooter and I think that\u2019s what he got labeled at Kentucky,\u201d UCLA coach Mick Cronin said. \u201cI wanted him to get rid of that mindset. We really worked hard on his mid-range and him going to the basket. He\u2019s grown immensely.\u201d Juzang\u2019s length and skill set have him projected as a possible lottery pick in next year\u2019s NBA draft. It will be history if he is. Jeremy Lin was a standout at Harvard before his Linsanity days in the NBA and lengthy professional career. Kihei Clark, who\u2019s Filipino American, made one of the biggest plays during Virginia\u2019s run to the 2019 championship and just completed his junior season. Arizona State\u2019s Remy Martin had a stellar four-year career in the desert and Jordan Clarkson, who is also Filipino American, has a steady NBA career going after playing at Tulsa and Missouri. Rui Hachimura of Gonzaga was a lottery pick, but he is a native of Japan. Yao Ming never played college basketball, going straight from the Chinese national team to the NBA. Juzang is a rarity as an Asian American in college basketball with clear NBA potential. \u201cI think it\u2019ll be a really significant moment and I think the more that it can just be felt where that is normal, I think is what can make it even more significant,\u201d Miami Heat coach Eric Spoelstra, who\u2019s mother is Filipino, said without talking specifically about Juzang. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what your race is or what your background is. As long as you can hoop, then people can see you in that way.\u201d A high draft pick or not, Juzang has been an inspiration for players, particularly young Asian Americans. Hate crimes against Asian Americans have spiked during the pandemic, as has the vitriol on social media and beyond toward people of Asian decent. Juzang\u2019s success and UCLA\u2019s run into the Final Four has drawn positive reactions from Vietnam and all over the world. \u201cThat\u2019s always a good feeling to hear from people, but I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s on the forefront of my mind,\u201d he said. Maybe not, but it\u2019s helping \u2014 at least a little."},{"id":524438,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/mavs-coach-rick-carlisle-tests-positive-for-covid-19-out-vs-knicks","date":"2021-04-03","title":"Rick Carlisle tests positive for COVID, misses Mavs-Knicks game","content":"Dallas Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle missed Friday\u2019s game at the New York Knicks after testing positive for COVID-19 the morning of the game.

(AP) \u2014 Auburn freshman point guard Sharife Cooper says he plans to enter the NBA draft and give up his remaining eligibility. Cooper announced his decision to enter the draft and hire an agent Friday after putting up big numbers as a freshman despite playing in only 12 games. Cooper averaged 20.2 points, 8.1 assists and 4.3 rebounds after being declared eligible by the NCAA. Fellow Auburn freshman JT Thor also has entered the draft, but left the door open for a return. Cooper is one of just seven players nationally to average 20 points and eight assists per game in the last 25 years, joining recent players such as Ja Morant (Murray State) and Trae Young (Oklahoma). \u201cIt was a tough decision, a hard decision, but with that being said, I would like to declare for the 2021 NBA Draft and hire an agent,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cI\u2019m forever grateful to be a part of the Auburn Family.

That makes him a great play. Mykhailiuk posted 34.8 FD points and 22 real-life points in his last on-court appearance. Phoenix is one of the toughest matchups in the league, but Svi should still see the floor for 30-plus minutes. Even if he regresses, I can see him hitting 7x value, making him a solid GPP or cash play. Jordan Clarkson (PG \u2013 UTA) $5,300  As the leading Sixth-Man of the Year candidate, Clarkson doesn\u2019t always play big minutes. But when he\u2019s on the floor, he\u2019s quite efficient. In just 26 minutes in his last outing, Clarkson posted 34.4 fantasy points, and he can reach 40. He tallied 27 FD points across just 23 minutes in his previous matchup with the Bulls. I see him as a safe play because he should see more run than 23 minutes against a mediocre Chicago defense in a pace-up spot. De\u2019Anthony Melton (SG \u2013 MEM) $4,100  Honestly, you can make an argument for any player facing the Timberwolves. Not only are they 27th ranked in defensive efficiency, but they also rank 23rd in FD points allowed to shooting guards. Melton has seen an uptick in points in his last couple of games, and he really went off against Houston with 33 FD points. While I will say Minnesota is a bit better than the Rockets, this is still a nice spot for the Memphis guard that should provide a lot of opportunities. Chris Boucher (C \u2013 TOR) $4,700  Despite his inconsistent minutes, Boucher is quite efficient on the floor, tallying 1.27 FPPM in his last five games and 1.21 FPPM this season. With Kyle Lowry and Rodney Hood out, the whole team should see an uptick in usage, Boucher included. Even if he plays just 25 minutes, the Raptors center can reach 6x value. I still see him as a GPP play since his minutes aren\u2019t concrete, but he has some serious upside. Keep an eye out for lineups as well. If Aron Baynes ($3,600) earns the start for Toronto, he could also make a sneaky play at the center spot. Patrick Williams (SF \u2013 CHI) $3,600  Williams has seen an improvement in his game of late, but his price has stayed stagnant, making him a fine play for tonight\u2019s slate. The rookie scored 26.1 FD points against a stingy Phoenix team last game and did even better against Golden State. He is almost guaranteed to get a steal and\/or block while grabbing three to five boards, and he can even score in double-figures. His ceiling is a bit limited, though, so I see him more as a cash play tonight. Tyrese Haliburton (SG \u2013 SAC) $5,600  The Sacramento rookie has been a 0.94 FPPM guy this season, and his usage has sat just shy of 24% in his last couple of games. Expecting him to earn the start again means he should garner 30-plus minutes. Haliburton can score 20 points while facilitating the ball to earn plenty of assists. However, I see him as more of a GPP. While he does have a high ceiling, he has also been known to post some dud games. OG Anunoby (SF \u2013 TOR) $6,600  As I mentioned before with Boucher, this entire Toronto team should see an uptick in usage because of their shorthandedness. In a plus matchup against an up-tempo Golden State team, don\u2019t be afraid to stack your Raptors. The Indiana product just had a stellar performance against the Thunder, and while I don\u2019t expect him to score 47.7 fantasy points again, he can reach 40-plus against Golden State. Anunoby is a stat-sheet stuffer, so don\u2019t be afraid to include him in cash or GPP lineups. Isaiah Roby (PF \u2013 OKC) $5,500  With nearly half the Thunder projected to sit this one out, we have a lot of value to work with. Roby should earn the start, and if he does, he can easily reach 6x-7x value. It\u2019s not as if Roby is the most efficient player, and the Phoenix matchup might scare some from rostering him. That said, power forward is a bit dry tonight, and Roby is a fine choice. He will have to see the floor for 33-36 minutes with all the injuries, and even if he plays below his season average of 0.91 FPPM, he\u2019ll still reach 5x. Jaden McDaniels (PF \u2013 MIN) $4,600  This price is too low for any starter on a team projected to score 105-plus points. The Minnesota rookie has seen some serious minutes in his last three games, reaching at least 35 in each of those outings. His fantasy output hasn\u2019t directly followed through with his playing time, but he can drop 40-plus fantasy points at will. In a pace-up spot against Memphis, McDaniels makes a fine GPP play. T.J. McConnell (PG \u2013 IND) $4,800  The Pacers\u2019 backup point guard has been pretty steady of late, scoring between 24-28 FanDuel points in each of his last three outings. I expect similar production from McConnell tonight, but he can also reach 30 fantasy points. Despite being a backup, McConnell has a consistent floor that makes him a worthy cash player tonight."},{"id":524300,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/isaiah-thomas-to-reportedly-sign-10-day-contract-with-pelicans","date":"2021-04-02","title":"Pelicans sign Isaiah Thomas to 10-day contract","content":"Isaiah Thomas has signed a 10-day contract with the New Orleans Pelicans, the team announced on Saturday.

But players such as Harden and Nikola Jokic continue to shine with competition heating up for the stretch run of the season. So, it\u2019s no surprise Jokic and Harden earned Kia NBA Player of the Month in their respective conferences for the month of March. Jokic retains the top spot in this week\u2019s Kia Race to the MVP Ladder, while Dallas Mavericks star guard Luka Doncic finally cracks the top five after averaging 29.4 points per game throughout March and hitting 43.3% from 3-point range in nearly 35 minutes per game. Gutsy Portland Trail Blazers guard Damian Lillard moves up a spot to No. 2, while Embiid and James finally fall out of the top five.

The big man might even be on the way to finishing the season in the elusive 50-40-90 club. Denver completed its first season sweep of Philadelphia since 2015-16 on Tuesday by dominating the 76ers inside with Jokic. The Nuggets won the rebounding battle against the Embiid-less 76ers 51-34 and outscored them in the paint 44-32. Then on Thursday, Jokic found ways to connect with new addition Aaron Gordon for buckets en route to a 101-94 win against the Clippers.

Lillard scorched the Detroit Pistons from deep on Wednesday, hitting 5 of 7 to finish with 33 points. What is scarier is Lillard believes the Trail Blazers, which have battled through a slew of injuries this season, are finally whole again and \u201ctrending upwards.\u201d Last week\u2019s ranking: No. 6 Season stats: 25.9 ppg, 8.2 rpg, 11.1 apg Harden missed just his third game since joining the Nets on Thursday \u2014 due to tightness in his right hamstring \u2014 after initially suffering the injury the night before in Brooklyn\u2019s comeback win against the Houston Rockets. Nets coach Steve Nash expressed optimism that Harden\u2019s injury won\u2019t keep him out for a significant amount of time. Brooklyn was 7-6 before acquiring Harden, but have since gone 26-7 in games he\u2019s played while finishing 1-2 in games he\u2019s missed. Harden\u2019s stellar play has been key in Brooklyn climbing atop the Eastern Conference standings for the first time since April of 2003. Last week\u2019s ranking: No. 2 Season stats: 28.3 ppg, 11.4 rpg, 6.3 apg, 1.3 bpg Antetokounmpo finished with a career-worst-tying minus-31 in 34 minutes Monday in a loss to the Clippers.

Even better, he finished March shooting 3-pointers with 10% better accuracy (39.4%) than the previous two months. Milwaukee goes into tonight\u2019s matchup against Lillard in Portland with a record of 12-10 on the road (3-5 road record against West teams).

He returned on March 29 and led the Mavericks to consecutive wins as they quietly creep up the West standings. Despite starting the season struggling with accuracy from deep (9.5% on 3-pointers in December), Doncic was hot in March, averaging 43.3% from long range, 52.7% overall and 29.4 ppg. \u201cIt\u2019s repetition, but it\u2019s also a lot of confidence,\u201d Doncic said Wednesday after racking up 36 points in Dallas\u2019 win against the Boston Celtics.

He started in his Heat debut Thursday night, helping Miami get over the .500 mark with a 116-109 win over the Golden State Warriors.  \u201cHe\u2019s a veteran guy, he\u2019s played in good programs on good teams, so he knows how to fit in,\u201d Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. \u201cI think defensively, it\u2019s extremely natural, the fit. And offensively, he gives us that downhill attack, another guy that can make plays, another guy that can put pressure on opposing defenses in the paint.\u201d It\u2019s a fit that has been a long time coming. Oladipo is close with Miami legend Dwayne Wade \u2014 Oladipo played at Indiana for Tom Crean, Wade\u2019s coach at Marquette \u2014 and that\u2019s just one of many hints that this pairing was inevitable. Oladipo trains in Miami, his name somehow always seems to get linked to the Heat in trade or free-agent talks, and above all else he sees himself as a fit for the Heat. The buzzword they use in Miami is \u201cculture.\u201d Spoelstra often says it\u2019s not for everybody. Oladipo has craved being a part of it. \u201cI come from high-cultural basketball: DeMatha Catholic High School, to Indiana University, and now being on the Heat,\u201d Oladipo said. \u201cIt\u2019s a culture. It\u2019s a way of life and it\u2019s playing for something bigger than yourself. It\u2019s sacrifice, it\u2019s winning at the ultimate level. That\u2019s what I\u2019m used to. That\u2019s what I flourish in. \u201cI feel like being a part of this and walking around that locker room every day and seeing those championships, and walking around and seeing what winning looks like, it\u2019s going to help me be a better player, be a better person, and help me help this team win at the highest level.\u201d That, and he\u2019s already had a taste of that culture from the workouts he used to share with Wade. The three-time NBA champion with the Heat thought nothing of sharing secrets and advice with Oladipo, who soaked up every word. Oladipo came to Miami at the trade deadline last week , the Heat adding him \u2014 a two-time All-Star, a 21-point-per-game scorer this season and someone only three years removed from All-NBA status \u2014 from Houston in exchange for Kelly Olynyk, Avery Bradley and a pick swap in 2022. \u201cIt gives them another presence defensively, gives them another scoring option,\u201d Golden State guard Stephen Curry said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good pickup for a good team. Obviously, they\u2019re the defending Eastern Conference champs and they got better and I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll enjoy his time here playing with the guys he gets to play with.\u201d Oladipo didn\u2019t enjoy playing against them last year, when he and the Indiana Pacers endured that first-round sweep. But even then, he knew the potential. And now that he\u2019s in Miami, he\u2019s eager to see if another deep Heat postseason run can happen. \u201cI felt how they clicked, what they were doing out there, I felt it,\u201d Oladipo said. \u201cI felt something special there. So, to be a part of this group now, it\u2019s truly a blessing.\u201d"},{"id":524052,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/florida-loses-another-as-scottie-lewis-opts-for-nba-draft","date":"2021-04-02","title":"Florida loses another as Scottie Lewis opts for NBA draft","content":"GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Guard Scottie Lewis became the sixth player to leave Florida\u2019s basketball program in a little more than a week when he declared for the NBA draft Thursday night. Lewis announced on Instagram that he will hire an agent and made it clear he has no plans on returning to school. \u201cI know that I will be moving on to a new place and if god is willing to a new team but please know that Gainesville and the Stephen O\u2019Connell arena will always have a special place in my heart!\u201d he wrote. A McDonald\u2019s All-American from Hazlet, New Jersey, Lewis started 31 of 51 games in two seasons at Florida. He averaged 8.2 points and 3.4 rebounds and was best known for his defense. He had 69 steals and 58 blocks. Although he flashed at times, he never came close to reaching the expectations that came with being coach Mike White\u2019s top recruit in six seasons. He was ESPN\u2019s ninth-rated high school prospect in 2018-19. He\u2019s the latest in growing list of departures in Gainesville and around the country, where teams everywhere are dealing with defections and rebuilds as players take advantage of lenient NCAA transfer rules and a portal that\u2019s ballooned to more than 1,200 guys seeking new places to play. Star point guard and leading scorer Tre Mann started the exodus last week by entering the NBA draft with plans of hiring an agent. Starting shooting guard Noah Locke, forward Omar Payne, backup point guard Ques Glover and reserve forward Osayi Osifo entered the portal in hopes of finding more playing time or a more prominent role elsewhere. The Gators shouldn\u2019t have much trouble replacing any of the four transfers. Locke was a slow-footed, one-dimensional shooter. Payne, Glover and Osifo were backups who rarely made the Gators better when they were on the floor. Lewis surely would have had a chance to become the centerpiece of Florida\u2019s retooled team next season. Instead, he will work to get drafted. \u201cFrom the moment my father placed a ball in my hands, I knew I wanted to strive for nothing but greatness,\u201d he wrote. \u201cPlaying in the NBA has always been my main priority in life. \u201cAnd with that being said, I am happy to announce that I have made the decision to take the next step in my career by signing with (an) agent and declaring for the NBA draft!\u201d An outspoken advocate for equality and ending racial injustice, Lewis also thanked his coaches, his parents and his teammates. He might not be the last to say goodbye. Forward Colin Castleton, the team\u2019s second-leading scorer, entered his name in the NBA draft to get feedback on his skills. But he did not hire an agent and is expected to return. Guard Niels Lane and forward Samson Ruzhentsev are still weighing their options, according to the team\u2019s official website. And it\u2019s unclear what the future holds for talented swingman Keyontae Johnson, who has not been cleared to practice or play since collapsing on the court during a game in December. The cause of his face-first fall and his current condition have not been released publicly. The Gators will be active in the transfer portal to rebuild their roster, especially since White signed just one recruit in the 2021 class: talented guard Kowacie Reeves."},{"id":524051,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blue-devils-freshman-dj-steward-declaring-for-nba-draft","date":"2021-04-02","title":"Blue Devils freshman DJ Steward declaring for NBA draft","content":"DURHAM, N.C.

Nets coach Steve Nash listed the former MVP as day-to-day and should return within the next few games. The Nets have also been without Kevin Durant (strained left hamstring) and his injury absence is expected to last at least another week. New addition LaMarcus Aldridge made his Nets debut against Charlotte and was more than solid, starting at center and finishing 11 points, nine rebounds and six assists, looking like a good fit for a Nets team that won for the 20th time in its last 23 games. They signed him last month after he reached a buyout agreement with San Antonio. Harden exited in the third quarter of Wednesday\u2019s 120-108 win against the Houston Rockets and did not return. He finished with 17 points, eight rebounds and six assists. After the game, Nash said he was confident Harden didn\u2019t suffer a long-term injury. A timetable for his return is currently unknown, but missing the second half of a back-to-back seemed likely for a player that is helping lead the No. 1 team in the East. Brooklyn is still without Kevin Durant, who has missed nearly seven weeks because of his own hamstring strain. The Nets will pay a visit to the Chicago Bulls on Sunday.

CLEVELAND (AP) \u2014 Cavaliers star center Kevin Love returned to the starting lineup and played in just his fifth game this season after being sidelined by a severe calf strain. Coach J.B. Bickerstaff said Love \u2014 and guard Matthew Dellavedova, who hasn\u2019t played in more than a year \u2014 were available Thursday night as the short-handed Cavs face the Philadelphia 76ers. It was Love\u2019s first action since March 14, when he came back after missing 32 games. Dellavedova made his season debut after being out with a concussion and appendectomy. Bickertstaff said Love and Dellavedova, the only players left from the Cavs\u2019 2016 NBA title team, were on a minutes restriction as they ease their way back into game shape. Love received a nice ovation when he was introduced before the game, and he promptly made his first three shots, two of them 3-pointers, to give the Cavs an early lead. Love finished with 13 points, three rebounds and two assists in the first quarter. Dellavedova had two assists after checking in with four minutes left in the first. Love played 45 total minutes in Cleveland\u2019s first two games before missing more than two months with the injury, which he initially sustained during the exhibition opener and was only supposed to keep him out for a month. The injury lingered, and the five-time All-Star struggled to gain enough confidence to play at less than 100%. The 32-year-old Love returned for his first game since Dec. 27 on March 12 and played 10 minutes against New Orleans. Two nights later, his calf didn\u2019t feel right against Atlanta and the Cavs decided to shut Love down and give the injury more time to heal. Dellavedova hadn\u2019t played since March 10, 2020, the final game before the Cavs\u2019 season was halted by the COVID-19 pandemic. He sustained a head injury during the preseason and was close to coming back when he felt ill and had his appendix removed in February. \u201cHe\u2019s extremely grateful to be able to play the game,\u201d Bickerstaff said. \u201cOur conversation, he just talked about how appreciative he was, how we\u2019ve dealt with this and been patient in giving him this opportunity. He loves the game of basketball, he throws his heart into it completely. \u201cSo you can imagine how frustrating and how difficult this process has been for a guy like that. But he\u2019s extremely appreciative and grateful and he\u2019s definitely excited about getting back on the court and joining his teammates.\u201d The Cavs need both Love and Dellavedova back with forwards Larry Nance Jr. (illness), Dylan Windler (knee soreness) and center Jarrett Allen (concussion) all out."},{"id":523779,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/andre-drummond-to-miss-lakers-game-vs-kings-with-toe-injury","date":"2021-04-02","title":"Andre Drummond to miss Lakers game vs. Kings with toe injury","content":"Lakers center Andre Drummond had an abbreviated debut on Wednesday against Milwaukee, and the right big toe contusion he suffered then will delay his second chance to impress the L.A. faithful.

Redick met his new teammates at practice in New York on Thursday, a day before the Mavericks play the Knicks on their season-long five-game road trip. Redick has joined the team presumably for good this season, but hasn\u2019t started practicing. There\u2019s no timetable for his Dallas debut. \u201cMy understanding is that things are going in a very good direction,\u201d coach Rick Carlisle said. \u201cWe obviously hope he can be back 100% sooner than later.\u201d The Mavericks, who are 17-8 since a six-game losing streak that dropped them a season-high five games under. 500, are seventh in the Western Conference with 25 games remaining. Dallas is 3\u00bd games out of a spot in the top six, which the club needs to avoid the play-in round of the playoffs. Redick made the playoffs each of his first 13 seasons in the league before the Pelicans failed to qualify during the NBA\u2019s coronavirus restart in Florida last year. The 36-year-old has played in 110 postseason games. \u201cHe\u2019s a guy situationally whose shooting is a difference-maker,\u201d Carlisle said. \u201cWe feel like he can help us on the floor. We feel he can help us with our day-to-day culture. He\u2019s a meticulous worker and a tireless preparation guy.\u201d Redick is shooting 36% from 3-point range, which would be a career low if he didn\u2019t play again in the regular season. But the most immediate question is how much better his opportunities will be playing with young Dallas sensation Luka Doncic, whose vast offensive skills are matched by his passing ability. \u201cLuka is as good as anybody in the league and creating his own shot and creating for other people,\u201d said Redick, who averaged 8.7 points in 31 games with the Pelicans, about four points off his career average. The day before his first virtual meeting with Dallas reporters since the trade, Redick said on his podcast he was \u201cjarred\u201d by the deal because he had asked to be traded to the East Coast or left out of any deals so he could control his destination through a buyout. It got close enough to the deadline last week that Redick turned off his phone thinking he was staying put, only to find out later he had been dealt. \u201cI reiterated this several times on the podcast, look, this is a great situation,\u201d said Redick, who hasn\u2019t won a title and reached the NBA Finals once, in 2009 when Orlando was swept by the Los Angeles Lakers. \u201cI\u2019m hoping that I can really help this team in a few ways and contribute to winning and contribute to hopefully a long playoff run.\u201d Redick\u2019s postseason experience leaves Carlisle with little worry about figuring out how to incorporate what could be the club\u2019s best 3-point threat into the lineup, presumably in late April and early May leading into the playoffs. \u201cFrom what I\u2019ve seen over the years, any time he\u2019s come back, he\u2019s been able to get back into it pretty quickly,\u201d Carlisle said. \u201cAt this stage of his career, a couple, three weeks off, whatever it\u2019s been, might actually be a good thing. We\u2019ll try to figure it out quickly.\u201d "},{"id":523777,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/durant-apologizes-for-profane-private-messages-to-rapaport","date":"2021-04-02","title":"Durant apologizes for profane private messages to Rapaport","content":"NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Kevin Durant apologized Thursday for threatening and profane comments he made to entertainer Michael Rapaport through social media. Rapaport released images of the private messages Tuesday on his Twitter account, and they included homophobic and misogynistic language from the Brooklyn Nets star. \u201cI\u2019m sorry that people seen the language that I used,\u201d Durant said. \u201cThat\u2019s not really what I want people to see and hear from me, but hopefully I can move past it and get back out on the floor.\u201d The NBA hasn\u2019t weighed in yet on Durant\u2019s comments and whether he would be fined. Brooklyn coach Steve Nash said the team has discussed the remarks but would keep the conversation internal. Durant is nearing a return from a left hamstring strain that has sidelined him since mid-February. He could be back sometime next week. He and the Nets thought the injury was minor when he missed his first game Feb. 15 in Sacramento. But a subsequent exam showed it to be more serious. \u201cSo, one of those things where I\u2019m not feeling a ton of pain, but it\u2019s just like you don\u2019t want to force one of these injuries, go out there and make it worse,\u201d Durant said. \u201cIn my mind I\u2019m just like, \u2018I can play,\u2019 but then it\u2019s also like you\u2019ve got to be smart and cautious with this type of injury. So just try to be patient with it all and just rehab as hard as I can, and I\u2019ve been through this situation before so I just try to take myself back to that place.\u201d Durant sat out the entire 2019-20 season, his first in Brooklyn, after rupturing his Achilles tendon playing for Golden State in the 2019 NBA Finals. He, Kyrie Irving and James Harden have been able to play just seven times together since the Nets acquired Harden in January, but the team has rolled to first place in the Eastern Conference while Durant sits. \u201cI was playing solid before I got injured and feel like we were just starting to figure each other out, James, Kyrie and myself, and different lineups out there on the floor,\u201d Durant said. \u201cI felt like we were starting to gain our rhythm and even though I was out a week before that with (health and safety) protocols, I felt like our team was gaining more chemistry then and that\u2019s more so what I care about.

Since Green doesn\u2019t contribute much in the scoring department, he\u2019s reliant on grabbing rebounds, dishing out assists, and getting you plus-three points for steals and blocks on FanDuel. While Green sees a slight uptick in rebounds when Curry is out, he sees a massive decline in assists (3.51 fewer assists) when Curry is sidelined. With Curry back in the lineup for the Golden State Warriors, Green should be able to hit 5x value at his price tag of $6,600. Rui Hachimura (WAS) $6,000 at DET Rui Hachimura could be finding his groove right now as he\u2019s earned 37+ FD points in three out of his past four games. The second-year forward has seen his role for the Washington Wizards expand recently as he\u2019s averaged 37.9 minutes per game since March 13th. If Beal is forced to miss another game for the Wizards on Thursday, Hachimura should continue being the second scorer on the team alongside Russell Westbrook, making him a decent value at $6,000 against the Detroit Pistons. Nickeil Alexander-Walker (NOP) $5,800 vs. ORL Along with the injury to Zion that could cause him to miss Thursday\u2019s game, the Pelicans have also been without Ball in recent games. Amid the absence of Ball, Stan Van Gundy has elected to give Nickeil Alexander-Walker more minutes, which he has taken advantage of. In the 240.9 minutes that Alexander-Walker has played without Williamson or Ball on the floor, he\u2019s seen a 26.5 percent usage for the Pelicans. If one of either Ball or Williamson is designated as out, Alexander-Walker has achieved 5x value at his current price in seven out of his last nine outings. Michael Carter-Williams (ORL) $5,300 at NOP Another player with a hyphen in his last name playing in Thursday\u2019s bout between the Pelicans and the Orlando Magic is Michael Carter-Williams. After a game where he was held scoreless versus the Los Angeles Lakers on March 28th, Carter-Williams exploded for 44.9 FD points against the Los Angeles Clippers on Tuesday. Even though Carter-Williams isn\u2019t a cerebral scorer, he should have no trouble \u2013 especially with an expanded workload \u2013 producing against a New Orleans team that allows the second-most FD points per game to point guards. Danilo Gallinari (ATL) $5,200 at SAS The Atlanta Hawks will be without Collins on Thursday, leaving them extremely thin in the frontcourt. Whenever Collins isn\u2019t on the floor, Danilo Gallinari has been one of the Hawks\u2019 main beneficiaries. Gallinari sees a solid 24 percent usage when Collins is on the sideline, which is the team\u2019s second-highest. Sitting at $5,200 on FanDuel, Gallinari seems like a pretty safe bet to hit 5x value versus the San Antonio Spurs, with Collins set to miss at least Thursday\u2019s contest. Terance Mann (LAC) $5,100 vs. DEN Paul George has been dealing with a nagging foot injury, forcing the Los Angeles Clippers to insert other players into the rotation. With George, Patrick Beverley, and Serge Ibaka missing time, Terance Mann has seen more run with the Clippers in recent games. Mann has surpassed 5x value in five out of his last six games, including the past two games that George has missed. It should be noted that playing Mann can be risky as the Denver Nuggets have surrendered the seventh-fewest FD points per game to shooting guards in the last 30 games. Saben Lee (DET) $5,000 vs. WAS The Pistons are in full rebuild mode and are giving extended minutes to most of their younger players. Saben Lee has been handed a starting role, but his minutes have been inconsistent in the past four games. If Lee can crack the starting lineup again against the Wizards, he\u2019ll get a chance to play in a pace-up game versus a Washington squad that has been the fourth-worst team against point guards in terms of FD points allowed per game in the past 15 games. Cody Zeller (CHA) $4,600 at BKN Attacking the Brooklyn Nets in the paint has proven to be one of the rare ways to cause fits for the second-seed in the Eastern Conference. While Cody Zeller isn\u2019t a dominant big man, by any means, he\u2019s more than capable of stuffing the stat sheet. Zeller played in 20+ minutes for the first time on Tuesday since returning from a two-game absence on March 24th. We need Zeller to exceed 20+ minutes again for him to give us massive value at the center position on Thursday. Isaiah Hartenstein (CLE) $4,000 vs. PHI Isaiah Hartenstein made his debut for the Cleveland Cavaliers on Monday versus the Utah Jazz, pouring in 34.3 FD points. While Hartenstein made only two of his eight shot attempts on Monday, he snagged 14 rebounds, and he recorded a team-high seven assists. Given that Nance, Allen, and Kevin Love are out for the Cavaliers again, Hartenstein is a free square at the power forward position. James Wiseman (GSW) $4,000 at MIA Just by hearing the Warriors speak about James Wiseman, they realize he\u2019s a 19-year-old rookie who\u2019s being thrown into the NBA amid an unusual season. Wiseman hasn\u2019t had the rookie campaign he envisioned having, but he\u2019s still playing a decent-sized role with the team. The first-year center has garnered 25+ minutes in four straight games, and if he can avoid foul trouble, he should be able to get 20+ FD points against the Miami Heat. If you\u2019re someone who prefers to pay down at center most nights, Zeller and Wiseman look to be viable \u2013 but risky \u2013 options."},{"id":523693,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/anthony-edwards-lamelo-ball-named-kia-nba-rookies-of-the-month","date":"2021-04-01","title":"Anthony Edwards, LaMelo Ball named Kia NBA Rookies of the Month","content":"Minnesota Timberwolves forward Anthony Edwards and Charlotte Hornets guard LaMelo Ball have been named the Kia NBA Rookies of the Month for games played in March.

Before the next rankings drop on Monday, here are some of the storylines he\u2019s keeping an eye on this weekend. In his second season, Zion Williamson has not extended his range. He\u2019s taken 82% of his shots in the restricted area, the third highest rate among 251 players with at least 200 field goal attempts and down just a tick from last season (85%). In 68 career games, Williamson has made 19 shots (on 56 attempts) from outside the paint. Four of those 19 came in his rookie debut. But his work in the paint, along with the seventh highest free throw rate (52 attempts per 100 shots from the field) among those 251 players, has Williamson ranking eighth in scoring at 26.4 points per game. Though he\u2019s made just eight 3-pointers, Williamson has the highest true shooting percentage (66.2%) among the 47 players with a usage rate of 25% or higher. Last season, Williamson scored 15.8 points per game in the restricted area , the highest mark in the 25 years for which we have shot-location data. This season, he\u2019s destroying his own record, averaging 17.9 restricted-area points per game . The goal for the Pelicans\u2019 offense in regard to the 20-year-old is the same as it was last season: Get him into the paint with enough runway for him to launch himself toward the rim, where he combines a deft touch with an uncanny ability to slice his wide body through however many defenders might be there (or just bounce off them). But the ways in which the Pelicans have achieved that goal have changed. According to Second Spectrum tracking, Williamson had the ball for 5% of the time he was on the floor last season. Through the Pelicans\u2019 first 23 games this season, that rate was up to a little less than 7% . And over the last 23 games, it\u2019s over 11% (and almost even with that of Brandon Ingram). According to Synergy tracking, Williamson has seen big jumps in the percentage of his ball-controlling types of possessions ( isolation and pick-and-roll ball-handler ): Zion Williamson play types via Synergy tracking Poss = Possessions per game Freq = Percentage of his total possessions PPP = Points per possession Transition and \u201ccut\u201d (non-roll-man catches in the paint, for the most part) play-types are still where Williamson is doing the highest volume of work. But it\u2019s been a more balanced diet and the continued development of his off-the-dribble game will be critical going forward. Opponents generally want to go under ball screens for Williamson. So the Pelicans will sometimes try to set those screens as low as possible, like at the dotted circle \u2026 A low screen can make it tougher for the defender to get under and give Williamson a runway \u2026 Switching the ball screen can keep Williamson from being able to get downhill, but it can also put him in a matchup he prefers \u2026 Williamson has also shown an ability to read his own defender. If he catches him leaning in the direction of the screen, he\u2019ll go the other way \u2026 And one reason for Williamson\u2019s effectiveness off the dribble is an improved handle, like a wicked in-and-out dribble \u2026 It\u2019s all about space. If Williamson doesn\u2019t have it, he can run into trouble \u2026 Williamson\u2019s 18.9 ppg in the restricted area are the most in the last 25 years, but his 67.4% shooting in the restricted area ranks just 17th among 47 players with at least 200 restricted-area attempts. He\u2019s had his shot blocked 94 times, 31 more than any other player in the league. Still, 67.4% (1.35 points per attempt) is a great rate of return. And the Pelicans\u2019 quest to get Williamson to the rim as much as possible will continue. The last five games have been the highest-scoring stretch (32.4 ppg) of Williamson\u2019s career. The Pelicans have won four of the five to climb within a game in the loss column of the ninth-place Warriors, with all three head-to-head matchups still to come. The Pelicans have beat the Nuggets, Lakers, Mavs and Celtics over the last 11 days, but L.A. was missing both LeBron James and Anthony Davis, while Dallas was missing both Luka Doncic and Kristaps Porzingis. The Pelicans have teased with wins over good teams before and still have a lot of work to do to secure a Play-In spot in the West. While they\u2019ve seen some defensive improvement (see below), the Pelicans still rank 28th on that end of the floor. Their win in Boston on Monday began a stretch where the Pels are playing 12 of 14 games against the Eastern Conference. That stretch continues with a back-to-back at home, where the Pels are hosting the Orlando on Thursday ( 8 ET, League Pass ) and Atlanta on Friday ( 9 ET, League Pass ). With every team having played at least 10 games since the All-Star break, here are the five teams that have seen the biggest jump in points scored per 100 possessions from before the break to after it: Biggest post-break jump, points scored per 100 possessions Some notes on those five teams: Here are the five teams that have seen the biggest drops in points allowed per 100 possessions since the break: Biggest post-break drop, points allowed per 100 possessions The Charlotte Hornets have surpassed expectations and are currently sitting in fourth place in the Eastern Conference at 24-22. One reason is their performance in close games. The Hornets are 16-6 in games that were within five points in the last five minutes and 8-16 otherwise. And much of that late-game success is due to their success from beyond the arc. For the second straight season, the Hornets have been the league\u2019s best 3-point shooting team in the clutch , 32-for-66 (48%) on clutch 3-pointers entering their game in Brooklyn on Thursday. Devonte\u2019 Graham has shot 10-for-18 (56%) on clutch 3-pointers, the second-best mark among 39 players who\u2019ve attempted at least 15. Terry Rozier\u2019s 12-for-23 (52%) is the best mark among 16 players with at least 20 attempts. In San Antonio last week, the Hornets drew up a play to get Rozier one of his clutch 3s. Rozier gave the ball to Gordon Hayward and faked like he was going to set a pin-down screen for P.J. Washington, but he quickly pivoted and curled off a cross-screen from Bismack Biyombo, who had slipped out of a ball-screen for Hayward \u2026 The Hornets actually lost a clutch game on Sunday, falling in overtime to Phoenix. All nine of their clutch shots were 3-point attempts and they made just two of the nine. They did hold off a Wizards comeback on Tuesday, with Rozier getting a couple of key 2-point buckets late. Jimmy Butler is a master at drawing fouls. He doesn\u2019t shoot well outside of 15 feet, but remains an efficient offensive player, because he ranks fifth in free throw rate (54 attempts per 100 shots from the field) among the 251 players with at least 200 field goal attempts. On the other end of the floor, Butler is great at avoiding the whistle. And this is set to be the seventh time in his career that Butler has had more steals ( 63 ) than personal fouls (47). Over the last 10 years, Kawhi Leonard (four times, including this season) and Tyus Jones (three times, including this season) are the only players who\u2019ve had more steals than personal fouls (with a minimum of 500 minutes played) more than twice. Last season, Butler (103 steals, 81 personal fouls) and Jones (59, 44) were the only two players that did it. This season, there are seven players (who\u2019ve played at least 500 minutes) in the Jimmy Butler Club: There are also two players with more blocks than personal fouls: Rudy Gobert (138, 112) and Jarrett Allen (74, 70). * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

They\u2019re a more confident and secure team today than two months ago because of a young player who\u2019s giving them a boost now, and an older player they hope will bring it later when the playoffs begin. In a sense, Terance Mann and Rajon Rondo are the bonuses the Clippers never saw coming, yet in quick time have become crucial pieces for a team with championship aspirations. They drafted Mann 48th overall in 2019 and, after spending much of his short career buried on the bench, he has rapidly and unexpectedly worked his way into a meaty role in the rotation. He has given the club a needed boost of youthful energy and promise. In the last few weeks Mann had scoring games of 16, 21 and 23 points and rebounding games of 10 and 12. Meanwhile, Rondo spurned the Clippers last fall during free agency, only to join them in a mutually beneficial marriage last week via a trade with the Atlanta Hawks . It\u2019s very possible that months from now, the Clippers could reflect back to the emergence of Mann and the arrival of Rondo as the turning point of a special season. Until then, there\u2019s work to be done, a season to finish and a strategy to be devised that gets the most out of both players and, by extension, the team itself. Mann actually made the Rondo trade possible. When he began to flourish and gain the confidence of coach Ty Lue and the respect of Kawhi Leonard and Paul George, it became apparent that Mann could be a replacement for Lou Williams. While the veteran guard was once again a sixth man fixture, he struggled early this season and Mann began to claim some of Williams\u2019 minutes off the bench. Therefore, when Rondo became available, the Clippers had someone to offer in a trade \u2026 and it wasn\u2019t Mann. Mann-type stories don\u2019t happen frequently, but serve as proof that the path to the NBA isn\u2019t always a straight line. He played four years in college, which these days is a detriment to big-league success, and was drafted late in the second round. He went to the Clippers, who had veterans at his position and were in win-now mode, and teams in those situations don\u2019t create opportunities for the young and unproven. Plus, Mann was a shooting guard at Florida State and was being asked to switch to the point \u2014 always a tricky transition. He spent 20 games with the Agua Caliente Clippers \u2014 the LA Clippers\u2019 NBA G League affiliate \u2014 and 41 games with the LA Clippers last season. But he worked hard in the team\u2019s player-development program, which actually ran dry after Landry Shamet and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander were traded. The Clippers suddenly became a team devoid of young talent except for Mann, and he wasn\u2019t considered an asset. When the Clippers added guard Luke Kennard last fall and gave him a rich four-year contract extension, Mann\u2019s role seemed tenuous. Then, the surprise: He jumped ahead of Kennard by simply being more aggressive, then became more consistent than Williams, and suddenly Lue didn\u2019t have a choice. After averaging 12.5 and 11.1 minutes per game in December and January, respectively, Mann\u2019s playing time soared to 24.4 mpg in March. With starter Pat Beverley dealing with knee issues, Mann\u2019s growth is crucial and welcome. George said: \u201cT-Mann (has) a will to want to get better and his determination is to get better. That\u2019s where it comes from \u2026 we\u2019re here to help him along the way, but T-Mann is special.\u201d Mann is obviously unproven in the playoffs. The NBA graveyard is filled with players who shine in the regular season, then fade under the pressure and urgency of the playoffs. And that\u2019s where Rondo\u2019s arrival is expected to fill that void. He is 35 and showed his age with the Hawks this season, but the Clippers are banking on \u201cPlayoff Rondo\u201d showing up when they\u2019ll need him most. Rondo won titles with the Boston Celtics and Los Angeles Lakers, the latter coming last season when he dialed back the basketball clock for some helpful stretches during the Lakers\u2019 deep run. Along the way, Rondo has become a better 3-point shooter \u2014 a career-best 37.8% this season after shooting 40% in the 2020 playoffs. This Rondo-Clippers combination is coming five months too late, in a sense. Rondo was a free agent last fall and the Clippers were in the running \u2026 until they weren\u2019t. Rather than stay in L.A. and join a contending team that needed his skills and experience, Rondo took a bit more money and signed with the Hawks. On the surface, then and now, it was an odd pairing that didn\u2019t seem to benefit either side. Players in similar situations, given their age and the fact they\u2019ve already made money, would take the winner over the developing team. And once he joined the Hawks, Rondo was a secondary player who saw roughly 15 minutes a night, and that\u2019s when he was healthy. It ended well, anyway: Rondo has a better team and his money. While the veteran Clippers aren\u2019t desperate for the leadership Rondo brings, his direction can still be helpful. His biggest asset is his ability to have the ball in the fourth quarter, when the Clippers all too often resort to George and Kawhi taking turns with isolation ball. With Rondo handling the ball, the Clippers can actually run a diagrammed play in those situations. Given the sudden surplus of guards, the Clippers can mix and match among Beverley, Mann, Kennard and Rondo and reap the benefits of what each can offer. The recipe seems to be: Start with the first three, then use Rondo as the closer. Lawrence Frank, the team\u2019s president, said the Rondo Affect should permeate the team: \u201cIt\u2019s because he dials it up and he becomes even more locked in and it has a very contagious effect. I don\u2019t think Rajon will just help Kawhi and Paul. I think he\u2019s going to elevate the whole group and everyone will rise to that level.\u201d That\u2019s the hope, anyway. The Clippers are top-four in the West and have realistic title dreams, but they\u2019ve also had too many gruesome losses that make you wonder: 51 points to the Mavericks, 28 to the Grizzlies, 20 to the Pelicans, and are coming off a Tuesday loss to whatever\u2019s left of the post-trade-deadline Magic. The real test is two months away, though. That\u2019s when the Clippers will bring someone old and someone new, with the goal of assuring this postseason run doesn\u2019t turn blue again. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

More than a year since his last regular-season NBA game, the Cavaliers\u2019 popular veteran guard could make his season debut Thursday night after being out with a concussion and appendectomy. Coach J.B. Bickerstaff said Dellavedova practiced Wednesday, and as long as he gets final medical clearance, the 30-year-old will play against the Philadelphia 76ers. \u201cMy expectation is hopeful that there will be a Delly sighting tomorrow,\u201d Bickerstaff said. Dellavedova, who along with Kevin Love is the only player remaining on the roster from Cleveland\u2019s 2016 NBA title team, hasn\u2019t played in a game since suffering a head injury in the club\u2019s exhibition opener in December. Dellavedova had suffered previous concussions, so his recovery took longer as he had to pass league protocols. He had made major progress toward a return in February, but was sidelined again after having his appendix removed. The Cavs have missed Dellavedova\u2019s experience, toughness and leadership. \u201cDefinitely seems like forever to think about how long he\u2019s been out and how many games he missed,\u201d said guard Collin Sexton. \u201cBut definitely excited to see him back out there in practice and going through the plays, it\u2019s amazing to see his full recovery. It\u2019s good.

And that\u2019s why Tyrese Haliburton has climbed to the top of the Kia Rookie Ladder this week. The top spot opened up two weeks ago when Charlotte guard LaMelo Ball suffered a broken wrist and got shut down for most or all of what\u2019s left to the 2020-21 season. Minnesota\u2019s Anthony Edwards grabbed it almost by default last week, though things were trending up for the Timberwolves newcomer. Then Edwards had a bumpy week. He continues to lead the Class of 2020 in scoring at 17.2 points per game, but since he\u2019s hoisting 16.4 shots nightly while making only 38.6%, he also leads the first-year guys in missed field goal attempts. He is a mixed bag of jaw-dropping highlights and wince-worthy mistakes night to night, sometimes minute to minute. Which is typical of the rookie experience. Meanwhile, Haliburton has chugged along like the tortoise vs. the hare. No one talks of the Sacramento guard as an athletic marvel, as so many rightfully do of Edwards. He has been precocious not in his ability to posterize individual defenders but in the way he seamlessly has blended into the Kings\u2019 strategies and style at both ends. And that\u2019s never been more evident than during the team\u2019s current hot stretch. Haliburton was coming off a calf injury to start March and was unhappy with his return to form \u2014 until coach Luke Walton moved him into the starting lineup in a three-guard formation to replace Marvin Bagley III (broken hand). Since then, the Kings have gone 7-1, outscoring rivals by 5.8 points and shooting 50.6% to their foes 48%. As for Haliburton, the No. 12 pick from Iowa State has averaged 15.8 ppg on 11.8 shots, hitting 51.1% overall and 42.5% of his 3-pointers. His 4.5 assists have come at the expense of only 1.6 turnovers. He even has been talking like a veteran in addressing Sacramento\u2019s improved play. \u201cWe\u2019re all here to help change the Kings culture,\u201d Haliburton said, \u201cget the Kings back to the playoffs, do special things here in Sacramento. Things that they haven\u2019t done in a long time.\u201d There\u2019s nothing wrong with being a valuable starter or rotation player from the day of one\u2019s arrival in the league. The list of past Rookie of the Year award winners includes a number of such guys, from Malcolm Brogdon in 2017, Michael Carter-Williams in 2014, and Emeka Okafor in 2005, back to Mike Miller 20 years ago. So for now, too much of the regular season remains to know which top rookie\u2019s portfolio will get the nod from ROY voters: Ball\u2019s tremendous half season, Edwards\u2019 spectacular moments and stats lines, or Haliburton\u2019s steady reliability. The Top 5 this week on the 2020-21 Kia Rookie Ladder: (All stats through Monday, March 29) Season stats : 13.2 ppg, 3.3 rpg, 5.0 apg Since last Ladder: 16.5 ppg, 2.8 rpg, 5.0 apg  Last Ladder\u2019s rung : 2 Haliburton has been helping Sacramento at both ends: His offensive rating of 111.9 ranks second among all rookies and his has an effective field-goal percentage of 59.4%. Meanwhile, he\u2019s averaging 1.3 steals and 2.2 deflections. Most of all, he is impacting winning, the rare rookie trait that Charlotte\u2019s Ball demonstrated early in staking his claim to the East\u2019s top rookie honors for January and February. Well, Haliburton was his West counterpart in winning those honors. Season stats : 17.2 ppg, 4.4 rpg, 2.5 apg Since last Ladder: 22.8 ppg, 6.3 rpg, 1.8 apg  Last Ladder\u2019s rung : 1 Don\u2019t think of this as a demotion, Edwards slipping down one rung from last week\u2019s Ladder. Think of it as an indication of how fluid the ROY race is with Ball out for an extended pit stop. Edwards\u2019 latest to-do list includes adapting to Malik Beasley\u2019s return, building trust with and from recently hired coach Chris Finch, gaining maturity with his offensive decisions and bringing effort consistently on defense. Season stats : 12.8 ppg, 2.3 rpg, 2.3 apg Since last Ladder: 13.7 ppg, 3.0 rpg, 3.0 apg  Last Ladder\u2019s rung: 3 Quickley\u2019s production as the No. 25 pick has provided cover for lottery-selection Obi Toppin\u2019s slow rookie season. The 6-foot-3 guard\u2019s production in limited minutes continues to impress, such as 12 points in 17 minutes vs. Miami. Pro-rated to 36 minutes, the Knicks rookie would be putting up 23.0 ppg, 4.1 rpg and 4.1 apg, along with 5.7 free throw attempts. Season stats : 10.6 ppg, 5.5 rpg, 1.8 apg Since last Ladder: 13.3 ppg, 6.8 rpg, 2.8 apg  Last Ladder\u2019s rung : 4 Minutes, scoring and rebounding all are up since the All-Star break. No 20-point games for the two-way forward through the Rockets\u2019 first 37 games, but three since then. Tate\u2019s 0.098 defensive win shares is tops among rookies, for a team that is 13-33. His confidence at both ends has made him a key piece in Houston\u2019s young core. Season stats : 10.9 ppg, 4.1 rpg, 1.3 apg Since last Ladder: 13.0 ppg, 4.7 rpg, 2.3 apg  Last Ladder\u2019s rung : 5 Only Jerami Grant (39) has more double-digit scoring games with the Pistons this season than Bey (28). He has knocked down 102 3-pointers just 44 games into his career, which ranks third all-time behind Luka Doncic (106) and Lauri Markkanen (103). The closest Pistons shooter ever? Brandon Knight (67). 6. LaMelo Ball, Charlotte Hornets Season stats : 15.9 ppg, 5.9 rpg, 6.1 apg Since last Ladder: DNP  Last Ladder\u2019s rung : 6 Hornets sensation in ROY green room pending return or ballot deadline. 7. James Wiseman, Golden State Warriors Season stats : 11.8 ppg, 5.9 rpg, 0.6 apg Since last Ladder: 12.0 ppg, 6.0 rpg, 0.0 apg  Last Ladder\u2019s rung : 7 Confidence has been issue for top rookie paint threat (7.8 ppg). 8. Desmond Bane, Memphis Grizzlies Season stats : 9.5 ppg, 2.9 rpg, 1.3 apg Since last Ladder: 7.5 ppg, 3.3 rpg, 1.5 apg  Last Ladder\u2019s rung : 8 Third-best rookie 3FG% (45.8) ever behind Morrow (46.7), Petrovic (45.9). 9. Patrick Williams, Chicago Bulls Season stats : 9.7 ppg, 4.9 rpg, 1.3 apg Since last Ladder: 8.3 ppg, 4.7 rpg, 2.0 apg  Last Ladder\u2019s rung : 9 He and Cavs\u2019 Okoro only rookies to start every game this season. 10. Isaiah Stewart, Detroit Pistons Season stats : 6.4 ppg, 5.8 rpg, 0.8 apg Since last Ladder: 9.5 ppg, 4.3 rpg, 1.0 apg  Last Ladder\u2019s rung : 10 Feisty, physical big earned first ejection vs. the Nets. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

The massive-salary era. The LeBron James era. It\u2019s also the triple-double era. If it seems like triple-doubles are happening more often than ever, that\u2019s because they are \u2014 by a huge margin. On average, the NBA has seen someone put up at least 10 of this, 10 of that and 10 of those in one out of every seven games this season. The rate of them happening is up 47% over last season, plus represents a staggering increase of nearly 700% over how often they occurred just nine years ago \u2014 when there were 18 in the entire 2011-12 season. They happen with amazing regularity now. That doesn\u2019t mean everyone is enthralled. \u201cI get it. They\u2019re nice, round numbers and people get into those things in sports,\u201d New Orleans coach Stan Van Gundy said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve never really been one who thought a whole lot of the whole triple-double thing.\u201d He\u2019s right. Some of them don\u2019t seem to have much of an impact on the game. Then there\u2019s what Russell Westbrook \u2014 the triple-double king \u2014 did Monday night. Westbrook had 35 points, 14 rebounds and 21 assists to lead Washington to a win. It was only the third time someone had that many points and that many assists in an NBA game; throw in the rebounds, and Westbrook\u2019s night was unprecedented. Westbrook kept momentum going Tuesday, making franchise history with the first 20-15-15 game. \u201cHe does things I\u2019ve never seen and I\u2019ve been in this league for 30 years,\u201d Washington coach Scott Brooks said. \u201cHe\u2019s a winner.\u201d If people are bored by the triple-double, it might be Westbrook\u2019s fault. He\u2019s been making them seem like nightly happenings for years. The reasons for the rise leaguewide in triple-doubles are many, but two of them are clear: the \u201cfreedom of movement\u201d emphasis in officiating favors the offensive player, so that means more points and more assists. So, too, does the increase pace of play, which also leads to more rebound opportunities. There are about eight more possessions and eight more shot attempts per team as compared to nine years ago, and every possession leads to a statistic of some sort. \u201cTo me, they\u2019re such arbitrary numbers,\u201d Van Gundy said. \u201cWhat, if you get 10, 10 and 10 that\u2019s better than 35, nine and nine? \u2026 There\u2019s a big difference between 15 points and 35 points. There\u2019s a big difference between 10 rebounds and 18 rebounds. And there\u2019s a big difference between 10 assists and 17 assists. So, to say a triple-double is a measure of a great game, I don\u2019t know.\u201d This is the fifth consecutive year that the NBA has seen players collect at least 100 triple-doubles; Westbrook got another one Tuesday night for No. 100, and in game No. 692, that\u2019s the fastest the league has ever gotten to the century mark. Westbrook\u2019s triple-double Tuesday was his league-best 17th . Denver\u2019s Nikola Jokic and Brooklyn\u2019s James Harden have 12 apiece , and were followed by Dallas\u2019 Luka Doncic with nine. Put another way, we\u2019ve seen practically as many triple-doubles in the last five years as in the 15 seasons before that combined. Even some players seem less-than-impressed by them these days. \u201cI could care less about a triple-double,\u201d Miami\u2019s Jimmy Butler said after he had one in last season\u2019s NBA Finals. \u201cWe play this game to win.\u201d Here\u2019s another example of how common the triple-double is getting: in the entirety of the 2011-12 season, only one player \u2014 Rajon Rondo, with six \u2014 had more than one of them. This season has already seen 14 players with multiple triple-doubles, a number that will almost certainly grow. The record for most in one season is 127. That will likely get shattered; the league is on pace to top 150 for the season. On March 13, five players had them on the same day, the first time that\u2019s happened in NBA history. The five: Harden, Westbrook, Julius Randle, Domantas Sabonis and Giannis Antetokounmpo. \u201cIt\u2019s not always about scoring,\u201d Antetokounmpo said. \u201cYou can manipulate the game in different ways: passing, finding your teammates, putting them in the right spot.\u201d TJ McConnell of the Indiana Pacers had a triple-double with steals back on March 3, just the 11th of those ever. There have clearly been nights where a player knows he\u2019s a rebound or an assist away from getting a triple-double and might become singularly focused on getting that one last stat; that\u2019s not so easy to do with steals, which made McConnell\u2019s one of the more impressive in a while. \u201cI just let the game come to me,\u201d McConnell said. They just come in bunches now. From 2009-10 through 2013-14, only Rondo and Andre Iguodala had back-to-back triple-doubles. This season alone, four players \u2014 Westbrook, Harden, Butler and Antetokounmpo \u2014 have had streaks of at least three in a row. And Westbrook \u2014 with 163 and counting, 18 away from Oscar Robertson\u2019s all-time record \u2014 is in position to average double-digits in points, rebounds and assists for the fourth time in the last five seasons. \u201cHe fills a stat sheet like nobody does in the history of this game,\u201d Brooks said. Yes, the triple-double is now ordinary. But as Westbrook showed Monday, they can still be extraordinary."},{"id":522526,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/jazz-charter-turns-back-after-striking-birds-on-takeoff","date":"2021-03-30","title":"Jazz charter turns back after striking birds on takeoff","content":"A Utah Jazz charter flight headed to Memphis had to return to Salt Lake City after the plane struck a flock of birds on takeoff.

Bacon\u2019s usage could take a hit, but I\u2019m not fading him tonight. He went for 26\/8 Sunday, and he\u2019s been a big part of Orlando\u2019s offense across his last two games. Bacon is a great tournament option who is likely to see his popularity wane with Ross back in the fold. Rui Hachimura (SF \u2013 WAS) $5,700  Hachimura has averaged 37.5 minutes across his last eight games, and he\u2019ll be needed for plenty of court time tonight with the Wizards so undermanned in the frontcourt. Daniel Gafford suffered a nasty injury last night, neither Alex Len nor Robin Lopez are huge playmakers on offense. Hachimura offers a ton of upside tonight. P.J. Washington (PF \u2013 CHA) $5,600  Washington\u2019s frontcourt is a mess, and Washington has a great opportunity to take full advantage. His price is friendly, and he should be all systems go against a seriously outmatched Wizards squad. Devonte\u2019 Graham (SG \u2013 CHA) $5,300  Malik Monk should return for this one, but Graham has averaged 28.3 FD points across his last three while averaging 31 minutes in the process. This game is projected to be high-scoring, and Graham should see enough usage to hit value and then some. Terance Mann (SG \u2013 LAC) $4,700  He\u2019s averaging 31 FD points in 31 minutes across his last three games. On the second night of a back-to-back, one or both of Paul George (who sat Monday) or Kawhi Leonard could sit, opening up additional opportunities for Mann. Even if both play, Mann should get enough run off the bench to be a worthy play. The Clippers are favored by 11.5, so a blowout could also be beneficial to his court time. Seth Curry (SG \u2013 LAC) $4,400  Since returning from a three-game absence, Curry has played 27 minutes in back-to-back contests, and while the returns haven\u2019t been phenomenal, the price and the playing time make him a worthwhile flier for tonight\u2019s slate. Alex Len (C \u2013 WAS) $3,900  Unfortunately for Washington, new addition Daniel Gafford left Capitol One Arena in a wheelchair after a scary ankle injury, so he\u2019s not likely to take the court. That leaves Len and Robin Lopez to handle center duties in an excellent matchup. Len\u2019s worth a look at just $3.9K. Bismack Biyombo (C \u2013 CHA) $3,800 Charlotte\u2019s frontcourt rotation is one of the most frustrating in the league, but for now, it appears Biyombo has a grip on starting duties or at least a 60\/40 minutes split with Cody Zeller. Biyombo isn\u2019t a guy to target in cash games, but if you want to pivot from some of the more expensive options in tournaments, he makes an interesting play against Washington\u2019s bottom-of-the-barrel frontcourt defense. Mike Scott (PF \u2013 PHI) $3,600 While Joel Embiid remains on the mend, Scott should be in line for quality minutes alongside Dwight Howard in Philly\u2019s frontcourt. The matchup is favorable, and Scott is worth a look at $3.6K after averaging 28.5 minutes across his last two contests. Chandler Hutchison (SF \u2013 WAS) $3,500  Hutchison went for 16\/5 in last night\u2019s debut for the Wizards, and he\u2019ll likely be needed to produce similarly in tonight\u2019s favorable matchup with the Hornets. With Daniel Gafford surely out, Washington playing on the second night of a back-to-back, and the squad seriously undermanned, Hutchison makes a fine value."},{"id":522484,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/defensive-player-ladder-myles-turner-rises","date":"2021-03-30","title":"Defensive Player Ladder: Myles Turner makes case for DPOY, climbs to No. 2","content":"These Defensive Player rankings have become as much a soapbox as a Ladder, given the impassioned self-promotion that has gone on here for the NBA\u2019s 2020-21 Defensive Player of the Year Award. Now it\u2019s Myles Turner\u2019s turn, touting his work for the Indiana Pacers. He now joins four other possible candidates in raising a hand for recognition at the less statistically dissectible art\/grind of defense. To this point, Philadelphia guard Ben Simmons has been the most vocal, stating in multiple interviews and even off-hand moments why he believes he is the league\u2019s best defensive player. He even has explained why , in his view, Utah center Rudy Gobert doesn\u2019t quite measure up at 7-foot-1. It\u2019s the versatility that Simmons takes pride in, his all-over-the-floor abilities to mess with opponents and their teams\u2019 offenses. Sixers teammate Joel Embiid was early in staking out his ambitions to be crowned DPOY this season, as well as NBA MVP. That\u2019s something Milwaukee\u2019s Giannis Antetokounmpo pulled off last season, with Michael Jordan and Hakeem Olajuwon as the only others to win both in the same season. That was all before Embiid suffered a knee injury to push his total of missed games to 15 and counting. More recently, Golden State\u2019s Draymond Green got carried away with absolutes, proclaiming himself possibly the NBA\u2019s best defensive player ever . That triggered a rush of counter-arguments on behalf of Bill Russell, Ben Wallace, Dennis Rodman and a host of others, with the bravado potentially working against Green\u2019s candidacy for the award. Through it all, Gobert offered his own views on his approach to defense and the team concept utilized by the Jazz, in essence staking his own claim to what would be his third DPOY. Now we have Turner, the Pacers center who has been doing league-leading and career-best work in the heart of coach Nate Bjorkgren\u2019s defense. He leads the league in both blocked shots ( 144 ) and blocks per game ( 3.5 ), while chipping in 1.1 steals per 36 minutes that also is the most in his six NBA seasons. Turner spoke up for himself after Indiana won at Dallas Friday. Back on familiar turf in Texas, the 6-foot-11 center swatted seven shots and help hold the Mavericks to 41% shooting, 22.9 from the arc, and just 94 points. \u201cI have the highest impact defensively in the league,\u201d Turner said on-air postgame. \u201cWhen I\u2019m out there, things change a lot. When I\u2019m not, it\u2019s obvious.\u201d  He isn\u2019t the Pacers\u2019 only Turner-as-DPOY salesman. Bjorkgren laid out some particulars to help his case. \u201cHe had some rundown blocks. In-pursuit blocks, where you think we might be giving up something at the rim,\u201d the coach said. \u201cHe flew out of nowhere a few times and got his hand on it. His presence alone down there, his activity, those were big.\u201d Then there was guard Malcolm Brogdon, who isn\u2019t about to let other big talkers dim Turner\u2019s bulb. \u201cI think that\u2019s what people don\u2019t talk about with our team is Myles and his impact,\u201d Brogdon said. \u201cHis impact is astronomical. He\u2019s the reason our defense is so good. His ability to block shots, it deters people from even driving to the rim so he\u2019s Defensive Player of the Year.\u201d Well, not quite, not yet. Turner\u2019s impact hasn\u2019t translated into anything more than a No. 20 spot for Indiana\u2019s defensive efficiency (113.4) and a 21-24 record. To be fair, Gobert\u2019s Utah club ranks No. 18 (112.7), though its net rating is eight points better than the Pacers\u2019 under-water minus-3.4. Then there is the Jazz\u2019s 35-11 record, tops in the NBA. But Turner has done enough to move up from his season-long spot on the Ladder\u2019s third rung to No. 2 this week. Here are the Top 5 this week on the 2020-21 Defensive Player Ladder: (All stats through Sunday, March 28) Last week\u2019s Ladder : 1 The DPOY is an individual award but as noted here in previous Ladders , elite defense is a team endeavor. Somebody like two-time winner Gobert anchors everything the Jazz do at that end of the floor, which explains their success and his continued presence on the top rung here. But Gobert knows he needs help, both in what he has (Royce O\u2019Neale, Mike Conley, Derrick Favors) and in what he could have. As in, Donovan Mitchell. In praising Mitchell after a recent spate of games in which he did strong work as a two-way player, Gobert pushed for more. \u201cI try to stay on his ass about defense, and the last four games, he\u2019s been defending at a high level,\u201d Utah\u2019s center said. \u201cWe need him to be a dominant defensive player for us to go where we want to go.\u201d Mitchell has some work to do: His net rating (-4.7) is worst among Jazz starters, and their defense gives up 110.2 points per 100 possessions when he\u2019s on the floor vs. 99.4 when he\u2019s off. Last week\u2019s Ladder : 3 It wasn\u2019t just the Dallas game, obviously. In Turner\u2019s five most recent performances, he has blocked 24 shots and helped Indiana go 4-1. The one game in which he didn\u2019t play, at Milwaukee last week, the Bucks torched the Pacers for 140 points, shot 56% overall and made 24-of-39 3-pointers \u2013 without using Giannis Antetokounmpo. Things kind of unraveled defensively, which is what happens when the anchor is missing. Last week\u2019s Ladder : 2 The Sixers\u2019 stretch of games while center Joel Embiid recovers from his bruised left knee has put more pressure on teammates left to cover in his absence. Taking a DPOY candidate out of the lineup even complicates things for the team\u2019s other DPOY candidate. Simmons still ranks high in many defensive categories, such as deflections ( 3.7, T3rd ) and loose balls recovered ( 1.3, T3rd ). But whereas Embiid has been a clear defensive plus when he\u2019s on the floor for Philly \u2013 105.9 points per 100 possessions with him, 106.6 without him \u2013 Simmons\u2019 numbers are upside down (yes, in part because he draws the toughest individual assignments): 107.0 vs. 105.3. As far as team defense, the Sixers are hopeful that the acquisition of veteran guard George Hill will alleviate some of the either\/or decisions about offense (Seth Curry) or defense (Matisse Thybulle) at pivotal times in the backcourt. Last week\u2019s Ladder : 5 The Pacers are worse at both ends when their backup point guard is sitting down. He continues to lead the league in steals ( 77 ), steals per game ( 1.8 ), deflections ( 3.9 ) and loose balls recovered ( 1.4 ), all while playing barely half of each game (25.2 minutes). Turner and McConnell are the long and short of Indiana\u2019s defense, on track to become the first pair of teammates to lead the NBA in blocks and steals since Theo Ratliff and Allen Iverson did it in 2001 (that Sixers team went to The Finals). No secret formula from his half of the equation. \u201cThe defensive end is just about effort,\u201d the 6-foot-1 guard said recently . \u201cThat\u2019s truly what it comes down to, and that\u2019s something I can control.\u201d Last week\u2019s Ladder : 4 Antetokounmpo had lots of defensive help last season and even more this season with Jrue Holiday, P.J. Tucker and Bobby Portis coming in to make up for Eric Bledsoe\u2019s and George Hill\u2019s departures. The lineups have been in flux and Milwaukee coach Mike Budenholzer has added switching to mix up what previously had been straight man-to-man and strict adherence to drop coverage. There have been some growing pains but the adjustments should serve the Bucks better in the postseason than what happened in 2019 and 2020. Meanwhile, Antetokounmpo is the cornerstone inside and out. He even averages more steals (1.2) and blocks (1.3) this year than he did in winning DPOY last year, and he\u2019s one of only 11 players holding opposing shooters at least 5 percentage points below their usual averages.

That said, the perception created from this particular trade can also be tricky and misleading, which leads to this interesting question: Does adding Aaron Gordon mean the Denver Nuggets are bringing a postseason difference-maker \u2026 or are they simply back to what they were last season? Gordon is athletic, can play either forward position, runs the floor easily, brings length and size as defensive weapons and doesn\u2019t need to dominate the ball to make an impact. He looks to be a solid fit with Nikola Jokic (which isn\u2019t hard to do) and Jamal Murray. That\u2019s plenty. That also describes Jerami Grant, who bailed on the Nuggets in free agency last fall and took the money and a bigger role in Detroit, where he\u2019s a candidate for Kia Most Improved Player even though his impressive stats (22.6 ppg, 4.9 rpg, 2.8 apg) are with a losing team. After losing their best wing defender and a reliable shooter, the Nuggets struggled somewhat this season. At one point they were 12-11 and collecting votes as the most disappointing team in the league. They reached the Western Conference finals last season with Grant, and the simple math says they need to play for an NBA title this season for Gordon to qualify as an upgrade, correct? In a conference laced with the Los Angeles Lakers, LA Clippers, Utah Jazz and Portland Trail Blazers \u2014 not to mention the rising Phoenix Suns \u2014 a case can be made the Nuggets might need more than Gordon to make it through the playoff minefield. Yes, it\u2019s true that matchups are crucial, and with 1 1\/2 months of the regular season remaining, injuries can shake up the scenario. The old rule of thumb doesn\u2019t change: Anything\u2019s possible for anyone. Still, that\u2019s what lies ahead for Denver. For now, the anticipation for the Gordon-fortified Nuggets is almost as steep as the jagged cliffs surrounding Denver. The team received a midseason confidence boost with this trade. He is everything they lacked this season, everything they missed about Grant. And the reviews after one game with Gordon in uniform were universally glowing. His coach and teammates are raving about the obvious physical skills, but also the mindset and adaptability of Gordon, which isn\u2019t uncommon for players who leave a hopeless situation \u2014 in his case, the Orlando Magic \u2014 and become recharged by a better one. \u201cHe knows why he came here,\u201d Jokic said. \u201cHe knows what he can do.\u201d It\u2019s possible Jokic will throw enough lobs and backdoor passes to Gordon to average a triple-double this season. Right now, Jokic is averaging 8.5 apg, though this could increase because Gordon is that good of a finisher. As a dunk contest bridesmaid \u2014 curiously, Gordon chose to wear No. 50 in Denver to mock his perfect scores in those contests \u2014 Gordon will be fun to watch in a system triggered by the one-armed passes and supreme court vision of Jokic. Gordon never saw anyone like this in his entire time in Orlando. When a finisher knows his hard work will be paid off by a pass, that player gets greedy and works even harder to spring free of defenders. Gordon is already bitten by that bug, thanks to Jokic. \u201cIt just makes the game so easy,\u201d he said. \u201cA ton of fun. Style of play is amazing.\u201d Gordon is a career 32.3% 3-point shooter, an area Grant was better at (34.7% career). But with Jokic, Murray and Michael Porter Jr. around, there\u2019s no pressure to force those shots. Plus, Gordon can feast on breakaway dunks because of his speed and Jokic\u2019s full-court outlet passes. With Jokic often playing the high post, Gordon can attack the rim for layups with the lanes cleared, or settle for mid-range jumpers. Another effect of adding Gordon is defensively, who, at 6-foot-8, is flexible enough to guard either forward spot. This will be crucial should the Nuggets meet LeBron James and Anthony Davis, both of whom ripped through the Nuggets in the West finals last summer. That\u2019s not to suggest Gordon, who never made an All-Defensive team, will be a Lakers stopper. But another layer of protection will be helpful. Any overall improvement for the Nuggets either in the standings or the all-important postseason journey depends on improvement by Gordon. His six-plus years in Orlando were recognized largely by cosmetics. He had plenty of highlight plays \u2026 yet never became an All-Star, averaged more than 16 ppg in a season only once (17.6 ppg in 2017-18) and is a career 69.5% free throw shooter (which is troubling for a player who has the size to draw contact). He scored 20 or more points just four times in 25 games this season with the Magic despite being a primary option. Essentially, in Orlando, Gordon constantly teased folks with his potential, but never really cashed in big. Yet a refreshing change in scenery could trigger the talent within. That\u2019s what the Nuggets are hoping for, and what Gordon himself believes will happen, now that he\u2019s with a legit contender and surrounded by better teammates. He has a sense of purpose and a renewed spirit. An argument can be made that he should\u2019ve kept that approach in Orlando even during tough times. But, understandably sensing a dead end with a Magic team that\u2019s next to last in the East, he asked for a trade, and here\u2019s where he is. \u201cI see no limits for this team. We have all the pieces we need. As long as we\u2019re all working together, there\u2019s no stopping us,\u201d Gordon said. Those words rarely, if ever, were spoken during his time with the Magic, who reached the playoffs only twice and never went beyond the first round with Gordon. A sudden shift in team fortune can flick a switch with players, particularly those who believe they\u2019re a significant step closer to a championship. Just observe the change in personality with James Harden with the Brooklyn Nets, and Blake Griffin as well. Rajon Rondo will feel this with the Clippers after leaving the Atlanta Hawks. The drive to practice seems quicker, the locker room jokes are funnier, the instructions from the coaches sound wiser, the postgame spread tastes better. Again, it\u2019s all about perception. In this case with Gordon and the Nuggets, it serves to help the new player and the new team. Best of all for the Nuggets is the trade didn\u2019t cost much. They didn\u2019t part with any crucial rotation players as Gary Harris was in decline, RJ Hampton was too young to contribute and the first-round pick Denver surrendered will likely fall in the mid-or late-20s. Meanwhile, Gordon is just 25 and signed through next season. The Nuggets should have enough to extend both him and Porter Jr. in the 2021-22 offseason. Denver had to make a move at the trade deadline if only to keep its place in line in the stacked West. With Jokic having a Kia MVP-quality season and Murray lately showing some of the performances that made him a breakout star in the bubble, the Nuggets craved another piece. Aaron Gordon is that piece. Soon, we\u2019ll know if he\u2019s another Grant \u2026 or something better. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

And GM Rafael Stone has no regrets. \u201cI feel good about it,\u201d he said to reporters on Monday via Zoom. \u201cI do feel good about it. You do every deal at the moment you do the deal. I would, for sure, 100% do that deal again. You guys don\u2019t have the advantages of knowing everything that I know. Literally no part of me that regrets doing that deal. I have not second guessed it for a moment.\u201d The Rockets\u2019 return in the four-team, seven-player deal included Victor Oladipo, Rodions Kurucs, three of Brooklyn\u2019s first-round picks (2022, \u201924, \u201926), one of Cleveland\u2019s (\u201922, via Milwaukee) and four first-round pick swaps (\u201921, \u201923, \u201925, \u201927) with Brooklyn. Oladipo was recently traded to the Heat for Avery Bradley, Kelly Olynyk and a 2022 pick swap. \u201cI think [a reporter] texted me the day after the [Harden] trade, and they said that they would evaluate me in 2027. And I said that was too early \u2014 they should do it in 2030. I think we felt at the time that we did the best job for the franchise possible. That\u2019s my job, so I did it. Particularly given the types of things that we got back, yeah, it feels like you can\u2019t possibly know how you did for multiple years \u2014 3, 5 something like that. \u201c[We think it helped] position us to maybe not have to be bad. There\u2019s some other things we\u2019ve done to help that too, but it\u2019s primarily that deal that\u2019s allowed us to say, \u2018Hey, we want to compete on a slightly quicker time frame.\u2019 We\u2019re not going to go down this path of intentionally trying to lose games for years on end.\u201d As for Oladipo, Stone said that the team realized it wasn\u2019t a fit, and once they did, they began exploring options to move on.

And on Monday night, in just his 38th game with the Washington Wizards, Westbrook overtook Darrell Walker for the franchise lead, logging triple-double No. 16 with Washington \u2014 and No. 162 overall \u2014 in spectacular fashion. (Also worth noting: Walker needed 283 career games with Washington to reach his mark.) \u201cHe does things that I\u2019ve never seen,\u201d Wizards coach Scott Brooks said of Westbrook, whom he also previously coached in Oklahoma City. \u201cHe\u2019s a winner, man. He fights. He\u2019s not perfect, and a lot of times the geniuses want to look at the things that he doesn\u2019t do well. But sometimes they forget about the other things that he does well.\u201d By final whistle, Westbrook had accumulated 35 points, 14 rebounds and a career-best 21 assists in the Wizards\u2019 132-124 victory over the Pacers. It marked just the third time in league history a player topped 30 points, 10 rebounds and 20 assists: Oscar Robertson (32-15-20) did so on Dec. 11, 1961 vs. Chicago; Magic Johnson (32-11-20) turned in the other on Nov. 28, 1988 at Philadelphia. The only Wizards player to achieve a 20-point, 20-assist triple-double was Rod Strickland (21-12-20) on Feb. 10, 1998. Westbrook hit the Wizards franchise mark on another notable stretch when he grabbed Brogdon\u2019s missed 3-pointer for his 10th rebound inside the final five seconds of the third quarter. Then he pushed up the floor and found Raul Neto for a buzzer-beating 3 that gave the Wizards a 95-92 lead and Westbrook his 18th assist. \u201cI don\u2019t deserve the credit, honestly,\u201d Westbrook said of the feat. \u201cI always give credit to the man above for blessing me with the ability to play, and along those lines, I have so many great coaches and teammates that make my job easy and help me out. Assists don\u2019t happen. I can\u2019t make the shots.\u201d Overall, Westbrook has now tied Oscar Robertson as the only players with five seasons of at least 15 triple-doubles.

Tonight\u2019s showdown with Washington provides a great spot for LeVert to get back on track. Kevin Porter (SF \u2013 HOU) $6,800  Victor Oladipo is gone, and Christian Wood could be out for a second straight game due to an illness, leaving plenty of opportunities for Kevin Porter on offense. KPJ led the Rockets in scoring in Saturday\u2019s win over the T-Wolves in his first game back from a three-game absence. He\u2019s got plenty of upside in tonight\u2019s tilt with the Grizz. Robert Williams (C \u2013 BOS) $6,500  The Time Lord breakout is upon us, and the Celtics\u2019 center should continue to see heavy run in the starting lineup with Daniel Theis shipped off to Chicago and Andre Drummond not signing with Boston. Across his last four games, Williams has scored at least 39.8 FD points in three of them. Moses Brown (C \u2013 OKC) $6,500 Brown went for 21 and 23 Saturday against the Celtics in a showing so impressive, the Thunder signed him to a multi-year deal Sunday. Brown has been huge as of late, and with Al Horford shut down for the season, the minutes and production show no signs of slowing down. Harrison Barnes (PF \u2013 SAC) $5,800 at SA Barnes continues to play heavy, heavy minutes, and while his scoring has taken a nosedive as of late, he\u2019s still crashing the boards with relish. He may be set to break out of his scoring funk after hitting a game-winner on a turnaround three in the Kings\u2019 win over Cleveland on Sunday. Nickeil Alexander-Walker (SG \u2013 NO) $5,800 NAW has averaged better than 30 points and 30 minutes across his last four games, and with Lonzo Ball questionable again Monday due to a hip injury, Alexander-Walker could be in for another high-usage night. Malik Beasley (SF \u2013 MIN) $5,600  Beasley went for 27.3 FD points across 29 minutes in his return from a 12-game suspension-related absence Saturday. Tonight\u2019s matchup with Brooklyn figures to be a track meet with little defense, putting Beasley in an excellent spot for such a discounted price. T.J. McConnell (PG \u2013 IND) $4,800  McConnell only needs 24 FD points to hit 5x value, and that\u2019s a mark he\u2019s hit in four of his last five games. One of those games includes a 16-point, 15-assist outing, and while McConnell\u2019s role has diminished since Caris LeVert entered the lineup, the propensity for dimes and swipes gives him plenty of upside with a sky-high ceiling in a favorable matchup. Cory Joseph (PG \u2013 DET) $4,000  Dennis Smith will miss his third straight with a back injury tonight, and CoJo figures to enjoy another solid helping of minutes. Joseph went for 8\/6\/4 with two steals in 29 minutes against Washington on Saturday, and he and Saben Lee ($3.7K) should split time in a favorable matchup with Toronto. Daniel Gafford (PF \u2013 WAS) $3,800  Gafford went for 13\/5 with three swats and a steal in his Wiz debut Saturday, outplaying Robin Lopez and Alex Len who played 20 and 15 minutes respectively. It\u2019s not hard to envision Gafford getting more playing time down the home stretch of the season for the lottery-bound Wizards, and he\u2019s worth a tournament flier for just $3.8K tonight."},{"id":521761,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/fantasy-basketball-waiver-wire-pickups-week-15","date":"2021-03-29","title":"Fantasy Basketball Waiver Wire Pickups: Week 15","content":"This weekly column will highlight players rostered in under 50% of Yahoo leagues who may help you ascertain fantasy glory.

This is the first meeting between the teams this season. In their last meeting on Jan. 14, 2020, Booker outscored Young 39-36, but it was Young (36 points, 10 assists) that emerged with the 123-110 win. One key difference from last season is that both the Suns and Hawks failed to make the playoffs in 2020, but are in strong position in 2021 \u2013 Phoenix is second in the West, while Atlanta is sixth in the East. Wednesday, March 31 Utah at Memphis  8 p.m. ET, NBA League Pass Speaking of playoffs, could this be a preview of a first-round playoff matchup between the Jazz and Grizzlies? Utah currently holds the No. 1 spot in the West (and the top record in the league at 34-11), while Memphis is currently in the No. 9 spot, which would put them in the Play-In for the second consecutive season. Utah leads the season series 2-0, with Donovan Mitchell averaging 35 points on 60% (24-40) shooting from the field, 71.4% (10-14) from 3-point range and 100% (12-12) at the free throw line. Ja Morant has led the Grizzlies against Utah with 22 points and 7.5 assists per game. Thursday, April 1 Golden State at Miami  8 p.m. ET, NBA League Pass While Stephen Curry is questionable for Monday, he should be back in the lineup by the time the Warriors meet the Heat in Miami on Thursday. In their first meeting this season on Feb. 17 , the Warriors rallied past the Heat to earn a 120-112 overtime win to snap a three-game losing streak to the Heat. Golden State had four players finish with at least 23 points in the win: Kelly Oubre Jr. (23), Andrew Wiggins (23), Curry (25) and Kent Bazemore (26). How rare is that feat? There have been only two other games this season when a team had four or more players score at least 23 points in the same game. And it has only happened nine times over the previous five seasons combined. Friday, April 2 Los Angeles at Sacramento  10 p.m. ET, NBA League Pass The Lakers-Kings rivalry dates back to the early 2000s when the teams had some epic playoff battles. But even as the roster change and teams have varying levels of success, when these two teams meet, the games are usually close. In fact, dating back to 2017, eight of the previous 14 meetings have been decided by five points or less \u2013 including their first meeting this season on March 3 as the Kings defeated the short-handed Lakers 123-120. The Kings enter Week 15 riding a four-game win streak as they look to climb into the Play-In field, while the Lakers have won two in a row to keep them in the top four in the West as their stars try to get healthy. Saturday, April 3 Dallas at Washington  7 p.m. ET, NBA League Pass Can I interest you in a matchup between two of the top four scorers in the league? Bradley Beal continues to lead the NBA in scoring at 31.3 points per game, while Luka Doncic ranks fourth at 28.6 ppg. How about a matchup between two of the top four players in triple-doubles ? Russell Westbrook leads the league at 15, while Doncic ranks fourth with nine. The Mavericks are currently No. 8 in the West and looking to climb out of the Play-In Tournament, but are four games back of No. 6 Portland. Meanwhile, the Wizards are trying to climb into the East Play-In as they currently sit at No. 13 in the East and are three games back of No. 10 Chicago."},{"id":521717,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/power-rankings-2020-21-week-15","date":"2021-03-29","title":"Power Rankings, Week 15: Jazz climb to No. 1 after NBA's active trade deadline","content":"The All-Star break and the trade deadline are both in the rearview mirror, but the season is still just 63% complete.

Now the most important question: how do I climb the leaderboard and win those cash prizes? 5 Winning Strategies for NBA In-Play: Fans have the opportunity to place bets on the next possession after free throws and timeouts, in addition to each player\u2019s quarter totals and the O\/U market. Take advantage! Fans can place 5, 10, 25, 50 or 100 coins on each outcome. Placing the maximum bet amount leads to a larger payout, which can catapult you on the leaderboard. With the Player Total and the Player Points O\/U markets available, fans can place correlated bets to maximize their earnings. For example, if a fan bets that LeBron James will score 7-9 points this quarter, they should also bet \u201cover\u201d 6.5 points for James this quarter. In order to be on top of the leaderboard, it is important for fans to be active. Place bets multiple times in a quarter to gain as many coins as possible. If LeBron James is on a cold streak, it might be time to bet on James. Often times when bets are not falling, that means it is time to bet on the player who has been \u201cunlucky.\u201d It is important for bettors to mix up their bets frequently so that many outcomes are accounted for."},{"id":521379,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/thunder-sign-moses-brown-to-multiyear-contract","date":"2021-03-28","title":"Thunder sign Moses Brown to multiyear contract","content":"OKLAHOMA CITY \u2013 The Oklahoma City Thunder have signed center Moses Brown to a multiyear contract, it was announced today by Executive Vice President and General Manager Sam Presti.

Welcome home, Coach Woodson. pic.twitter.com\/jrIeKcYawR \u2014 Indiana Basketball (@IndianaMBB) March 28, 2021 Woodson returned to the New York Knicks as an assistant this season after previously serving as New York\u2019s head coach for a little more than two seasons. He was expected to meet with his new players Sunday evening and will be introduced Monday. \u201cI have spoken with numerous individuals at the college and NBA levels, and they were unanimous in their support of and respect for Mike,\u201d athletic director Scott Dolson said. \u201cFrom his ability in terms of X\u2019s and O\u2019s to his skill at building relationships and developing players, his reputation is outstanding. As a coach, he\u2019s succeeded at the highest levels of the NBA, and he\u2019s mentored some of the game\u2019s all-time great players.\u201d The 63-year-old Indianapolis native was a college star, finishing his playing career as the second-leading scorer in Hoosiers history. After graduating in 1980, he went to play in the NBA and then spent his entire coaching career at the professional level. In nine seasons as coach, most of those with the Atlanta Hawks, Woodson went 315-365. \u201cWe know it is a very special opportunity for Mike to return to his alma mater as head coach and wish him the very best,\u201d Knicks president Leon Rose said in a statement posted on Twitter. \u201cWoody had a great impact on our team\u2019s play and culture this season and he will be missed.\u201d Woodson becomes the first Indiana alum hired as head coach since Lou Watson replaced Branch McCracken in 1965. Dan Dakich, who also played for Knight and is now a radio personality and color commentator on ESPN, was interim coach for seven games in 2008 after Kelvin Sampson was fired. Woodson is the second Black coach and third minority to lead the program, after Mike Davis, Knight\u2019s successor, and Sampson, who is Native American. He becomes one of 14 Black coaches in the Power Five and Big East conferences, a group that includes other NBA stalwarts in Juwan Howard (Michigan) and Patrick Ewing (Georgetown). Reaction to the hiring was positive from those closest to the program. \u201cI love it. Woody is a proven coach,\u201d former Indiana and New York Knicks star Jared Jeffries said. \u201cHe did an amazing job with our Knicks team. One of the nicest guys I\u2019ve ever met. Most of all, understands our school better than anyone.\u201d Dolson may have telegraphed the move when he announced March 15 that Archie Miller had been fired after four mediocre seasons. In explaining what he was seeking in a coach, Dolson told reporters he wanted an updated offense that appealed to recruits and college players who hoped to play in the NBA. Another attractive attribute is Woodson\u2019s history of mentoring top players. During his NBA career, he\u2019s worked with more than two dozen All-Stars. Fans have complained loudly about player development through most of the 21-year post-Knight era. Some who played for Woodson believe he could be successful immediately. \u201cOne of my favorite coaches to play for,\u201d Jamal Crawford said. An immediate concern for Woodson is that six Indiana players are currently in the transfer portal. His hiring could prompt at least some of those to reconsider. To help with the transition, Dolson has hired former Ohio State coach Thad Matta as an associate athletic director for basketball administration. Matta, who played at Butler and later served as head coach at Butler and Xavier, also reportedly interviewed for the coaching job. Woodson, who still ranks fifth all-time at Indiana with 2,061 points, was one of dozens of players who attended Knight\u2019s return to Assembly Hall in February 2020."},{"id":521367,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nets-irving-available-to-return-monday-vs-wolves","date":"2021-03-28","title":"Nets' Irving available to return Monday vs. Wolves","content":"Brooklyn guard Kyrie Irving will be available for Monday\u2019s game against the Timberwolves, coach Steve Nash said Sunday.

The Lakers announced the signing of the two-time All-Star center less than an hour before Sunday night\u2019s game against the Orlando Magic. Drummond announced his decision with a post on his Instagram account earlier in the day, writing \u201cBack to work\u201d underneath an illustration of himself in a Lakers uniform. \u201cAndre Drummond gives us powerful, anchor-point skills on both ends of the court,\u201d general manager Rob Pelinka said in a statement . \u201cWe feel extremely fortunate to add a player of his caliber and magnitude to our core group at this stage of our journey to defend the NBA title.\u201d Drummond agreed to a buyout Friday from the Cleveland Cavaliers, who acquired the four-time NBA rebounding champion last year after nearly eight seasons in Detroit. He had to clear waivers before he could join a team of his choosing, and Drummond chose to link up with LeBron James, Anthony Davis and the defending NBA champions. Drummond is almost certain to get his first significant NBA postseason playing time with the Lakers after appearing in only eight playoff games \u2014 and losing all eight \u2014 in two postseason trips with the Pistons. When Drummond gets up to playing speed after sitting out the past six weeks, the two-time All-Star Game selection should be a notable upgrade at center for Los Angeles, which won a competition with several contenders for his services over the weekend. Veteran Marc Gasol played inconsistently for the Lakers even before he returned recently from a 3 1\/2-week bout with coronavirus, while 6-foot-8 Montrezl Harrell is undersized for the biggest defensive assignments in the middle. Davis also plays center in many postseason matchups, but Drummond\u2019s rebounding and interior scoring should immediately boost the Lakers as they attempt to hang on to a top seed in the Western Conference without James and Davis. James is out indefinitely with a sprained right ankle, while Davis hasn\u2019t played since Feb. 14 due to a right calf injury. Drummond is averaging 17.5 points, 13.5 rebounds and 2.5 assists in 25 starts for the Cavs this season. He hasn\u2019t played since Feb. 12, when Cleveland benched him to give more playing time to youngster Jarrett Allen. Drummond would be second in the league in rebounds per game to Atlanta\u2019s Clint Capela if he had played enough games to qualify among the league leaders. His 4.0 offensive rebounds per game would be third in the NBA. The Lakers currently rank ninth in the NBA in rebounds per game (45.1), but just 17th in offensive rebounds (9.6). Coach Frank Vogel said he has had discussions with Gasol and Harrell about Drummond joining the roster, The 17-time champion franchise hasn\u2019t had a rebounder of Drummond\u2019s accomplishments for decades. The last Lakers player to top Drummond\u2019s career average of 13.8 rebounds per game in even one single season was Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in 1975-76, and Los Angeles has had just one league rebounding champ in those ensuing 45 years: Dwight Howard in 2012-13. \u201cSo much of the playoffs are about the paint, you know, and he\u2019s a physical force down there,\u201d Orlando coach Steve Clifford said about Drummond. \u201cHe\u2019s a great rim protector and one of the great offensive rebounders in our game. He could win one or two playoff games for you just for this physicality and size alone.\u201d Drummond\u2019s arrival in LA is the latest development in the NBA\u2019s annual super-team agglomerations around the trade deadline. Brooklyn added Blake Griffin and LaMarcus Aldridge this month, while Miami got Victor Oladipo and Denver landed Aaron Gordon and JaVale McGee."},{"id":521283,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/fanduel-dfs-values-of-the-night-sunday-mar-28","date":"2021-03-28","title":"FanDuel DFS Values Of The Night: Sunday (Mar. 28)","content":"Khem Birch (ORL) $5,800 Birch has filled-in for Nikola Vucevic in the past, and it appears he\u2019s going to be one of the focal points of the offense with Vooch being shipped off to Chicago. In the first game without him, Birch played 37 minutes and collected a career-best 53 fantasy points. While we\u2019re unlikely to see that again, we can\u2019t fade a sub-$5K player in a role like this! Kyle Lowry (TOR) $6,600 Now that Lowry doesn\u2019t have this trade stuff hanging over his head, look for him and the Raptors to play more freely. While he did struggle a bit in his last two games, we\u2019re still talking about a dude who\u2019s averaging 37 fantasy points per game. That\u2019s a great total from a $6,600 player, and we haven\u2019t even discussed this matchup. Portland currently ranks 29th in defensive efficiency while surrendering the most fantasy points to opposing point guards. Michael Carter-Williams (ORL) $5,300 Someone needs to run things in Orlando, and it looks like it will be MCW. It was one thing when he got the starting job for Markelle Fultz and Cole Anthony, but now that Vucevic, Aaron Gordon, and Evan Fournier are out of the picture, too, Carter-Williams should feast. He\u2019s been solid with all of them anyway, averaging 24 FanDuel points per game. Look for that to be his floor from now on, flirting with the impressive averages we saw in his Philly days. Robert Covington (POR) $6,400 RoCo has been a really dependable player for over a month now, and it\u2019s hard to understand why he remains so affordable. The defensive stud is averaging 33 FanDuel points per game across 36 minutes a night over his last 13 outings. That\u2019s a stellar total from someone in this price range, especially when you see that he faces a Toronto team that surrenders the third-most fantasy points to opposing power forwards. Montrezl Harrell (LAL) $7,200 With Anthony Davis and LeBron James out of the Lakers lineup, Harrell is their go-to guy. In fact, he leads the team with a 28 percent usage rate with those guys on the sidelines, providing 1.34 FD points per minute. That\u2019s a heck of a total, and it\u2019s led to him scoring at least 29 FD points in nine of his last 10 games while generating a 37-point average in that span. We certainly expect that to continue against a mangled Magic lineup too. Chuma Okeke (ORL) $5,300 It\u2019s unclear exactly who will receive minutes and usage in Orlando, but Okeke is as good of a bet as anyone. We say that because he had 22 points, six rebounds and four assists in the first game for this new-look roster, doing that damage in 37 minutes of play. He\u2019s easily one of the most talented youngsters on this roster, and they\u2019re going to play him big minutes to see what this first-round pick can do. Los Angeles\u2019 defense isn\u2019t as scary as you may think, posting one of the worst defensive ratings since James and Davis\u2019 injures. Dennis Schroder (LAL) $7,700: Schroder has been handling the ball a ton with James out of the lineup, generating a 27 percent usage rate with him off the floor. That huge bump to his role has led to the most productive stretch of his season, scoring at least 26 FD points in seven-straight games while averaging 36 fantasy points per game across his last six outings. The Magic have been killed by point guards all year, too, owning a 28th OPRK against them this season. Will Barton (DEN) $5,900 Barton has quietly turned his season around, and this price is not a good indication of how good he\u2019s been. In fact, Will the Thrill has scored at least 24 FD points in 12 of his last 14 games, averaging 28 fantasy points per game in that span. That form is nice, but we love this matchup against a 22nd-ranked Atlanta defense."},{"id":521101,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/horry-scale-barnes-drills-3-to-keep-kings-playoff-hopes-alive","date":"2021-03-28","title":"Horry Scale: Barnes drills 3 to keep Kings' playoff hopes alive","content":"A reminder on The Horry Scale: It breaks down a game-winning buzzer-beater (GWBB) in the categories of difficulty, game situation (was the team tied or behind at the time?), importance (playoff game or garden-variety night in November?) and celebration. Then we give it an overall grade on a scale of 1-5 Robert Horrys, named for the patron saint of last-second answered prayers. After presumably fielding offers leading up to this week\u2019s trade deadline, the Sacramento Kings decided it would be better to just hang on to Harrison Barnes. Good call. The veteran forward calmly drilled a turnaround 3-pointer as time expired to give Sacramento a dramatic 97-96 win over Cleveland. The shot gives the Kings their fourth consecutive win, with the Play-In Tournament suddenly well within reach. GAME SITUATION: Down two and out of timeouts, the Kings were forced to execute a full-court inbounds play with just 1.6 seconds left. Sacramento didn\u2019t have Grant Hill and Christian Laettner, but they decided De\u2019Aaron Fox and Barnes were the best candidates to pull off the impersonation for at least one night. DIFFICULTY: This is the rare occurrence where the pass is just as difficult as the shot. Fox\u2019s one-handed inbounds throw would have done any quarterback proud, landing right into Barnes\u2019 ready hands. Even so, to turn and shoot over a defender draped all over him \u2014 with a second closing in swiftly from behind \u2014 is no easy feat. Taken all together, the odds of the play being successfully executed within such a small window were minuscule at best. CELEBRATION: The best part might have been just before the rest of the Kings mobbed the hero of the night. Barnes, exultant after drilling the game-winner, gave Collin Sexton a hearty pat on the rear that seemed to say, \u201cGood game, I got you this time, young fella.\u201d After that, Barnes allowed himself to be jubilantly mobbed around the court by his Kings teammates. It was an unfiltered reminder of the youth of this team, and how significant moments like this can be in both the short and long-term. GRADE: Sacramento is suddenly just 1.5 games back of Golden State for the final Play-In spot. Their best young player (Fox) and most dependable veteran (Barnes) are the reasons why. The play itself and the lift it provides are enormous for a team hoping to snap the league\u2019s longest active playoff drought.

The win snapped a four-game skid for San Antonio Spurs, while pushing Popovich into elite company alongside Don Nelson (1,335 wins) and Lenny Wilkins (1,332). Given Popovich\u2019s fervor for the game, there\u2019s a decent chance he eventually topples Nelson and Wilkins to become the NBA\u2019s all-time leader in wins. \u201cI think at the base of it, the competitiveness in game situations is thrilling. That\u2019s always there,\u201d Popovich said earlier this season, when asked what keeps going after 24 seasons at the helm in San Antonio. \u201cIf that diminished or disappeared, then I wouldn\u2019t be doing this. Beyond that, watching a new generation of players that are 19,20, 21, 22 years old is both a challenge and it\u2019s extremely satisfying to watch them develop. Not just their basketball skills, but their awareness on the court, what\u2019s going in the world, what\u2019s going on off the court, learning about the world they live in beyond basketball. That still is a big satisfaction for me. I think I would miss that. Those two factors more than anything keep me in it.\u201d The longest-tenured coach with the same team among the 122 franchises in major professional sports, Popovich has led San Antonio to five NBA titles (1999, 2003, 2005, 2007 and 2014), and ranks as one of just five coaches in history to capture five or more championships alongside Phil Jackson, Red Auerbach, John Kundla, and Pat Riley. After a record-tying run of 22 consecutive postseason appearances, the Spurs missed the playoffs last season for the first time since 1997 despite an impressive run inside the NBA bubble, where Popovich and his assistants explored playing a new, more up-tempo style of basketball with the team\u2019s younger players. San Antonio carried that style into the 2020-21 season, and its most successful starting lineup (DeMar DeRozan, Keldon Johnson, Dejounte Murray, Jakob Poeltl and Derrick White) to date features a 31-year-old four-time NBA All-Star in DeRozan surrounded by four players age 26 or younger. \u201cWell, we just wanted to pick up from the way we played in the bubble in Orlando; a better recognition of team defense, a little bit more pride in individual defense, and then good pace, sharing the ball, good-to-great type of stuff,\u201d said Popovich, already the NBA\u2019s record-holder for road victories (552). The current roster features three players in their 30s in DeRozan (31), Rudy Gay (34) and Patty Mills, while the rest of the group consists of 11 players age 25 or younger and one 26-year-old in White. That youth showed up in a major way Saturday against the Bulls. San Antonio led by as many as 36 points in third quarter, only to watch its advantage disintegrate to single digits with 5:13 left to play, when new Bulls center Nikola Vucevic splashed a 26-footer that cut the Spurs\u2019 lead to nine points (107-98). San Antonio entered the final frame leading 96-73. Either way, the collective youth of this current team is somewhat of a departure from the experienced rosters San Antonio fielded during the Big Three days of now-retired stars Tim Duncan, Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili. Popovich currently leads the youngest Spurs roster of his tenure, as the club entered the season with an average age of 25.5. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously different to what I think he\u2019s used to; we\u2019re all used to,\u201d Mills explained earlier in the season. \u201cWhen I say: \u2018we all,\u2019 I mean the organization. Knowing just how many young guys and new people we have, as well as the vets, too, I think we\u2019re all adjusting to be able to figure out how to move forward, and how to succeed in doing so. It\u2019s definitely been an adjustment. For Pop, I think, and how everyone else has taken it has been day-by-day and game-by-game. The biggest thing for Pop is his patience that he\u2019s had for us to be professionals; to be able to learn on the fly, which has been the hardest thing. Especially with a season like we\u2019re having at the moment with the tightened schedule, the games, not [many] practices and all of that. It\u2019s time that, really for us, we\u2019ve got to lock down in film sessions and team meetings for us to get these things down. So, I think his patience has been a key thing for us.\u201d That approach appears to be paying off, too. San Antonio remains in the thick of the postseason hunt after a one-year hiatus. \u201cHe\u2019s been mixing in well, trusting us to keep the young guys motivated, keep them pushing, going the right way and picking and choosing when it\u2019s time to get on the young guys and on us to pick it up, to teach us, show us whenever we\u2019re making consistent mistakes how to fix that,\u201d DeRozan said. \u201cHis balance with both sides has been really good.\u201d San Antonio came into Saturday\u2019s game with a historical winning percentage of .618, which ranks as tops in the NBA. What\u2019s more is the Spurs own an all-time winning record against every team in the league, in large part due to the success achieved during the Popovich regime. Popovich remains the only NBA coach in history to spend 25 years or more with the same franchise, and he\u2019s one of just eight coaches in history of the four major sports (NBA, NFL, MLB, NHL) to have been with one team for 25 years. When the Spurs topped Minnesota in overtime on Jan. 9, the game marked Popovich\u2019s 1,900 th outing, making him the ninth coach in NBA history to coach that many games. Popovich joined a list that includes Wilkens, Nelson, Bill Fitch, Jerry Sloan, Larry Brown, George Karl, Dick Motta and Pat Riley. \u201cReaching this milestone is a testament to the drive, passion and intellect that define Gregg Popovich,\u201d Spurs CEO RC Buford told NBA.com. \u201cBoth his success and longevity are remarkable.\u201d    * * * Michael C.

Horford, 34, averaged 14.2 points and 6.7 rebounds this season. The five-time All-Star will remain with the team and train, but he will not travel. \u201cWhen I arrived, I understood the direction of the team, we had a great individual plan in place for me, and I feel like as a result I\u2019ve played really good basketball for the Thunder,\u201d Horford said in a statement. \u201cAt the same time, I know what it\u2019s like to be a young, aspiring player, and at this point in the season I understand how important playing meaningful minutes is for their careers and their development.\u201d Moses Brown, a 7-foot-1 two-way player who played 14 games in the G League this season, has shown promise with the Thunder. The second-year player from UCLA has averaged 11.4 points, 11.0 rebounds and 1.8 blocks the past eight games for Oklahoma City while shooting 58% from the field. Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said Horford has been a critical part of the development process for Brown and Isaiah Roby. Horford was impressed after Brown had 19 points and 12 rebounds against Memphis on Wednesday, \u201cVery special the way he\u2019s been able to step in and have an impact, because it\u2019s not so much about the numbers that he may be putting up,\u201d he said. \u201cThose are great. But just the impact that he\u2019s having on the game. Defensively, his presence is felt. Rebounding-wise his presence is felt. He continues to get better finishing around the basket.

LaMarcus Aldridge is next after signing with the Nets for the remainder of the season on Sunday. After reaching a buyout agreement with the San Antonio Spurs on Thursday, the veteran forward quickly became a coveted free agent for contending teams. The Nets announced the signing Sunday evening. ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski first reported Aldridge\u2019s intentions. Aldridge joins a Nets team that has current All-Stars Kevin Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving, and added a former one earlier this month when it signed Blake Griffin. Aldridge averaged 19.5 points and 8.0 rebounds in 5 1\/2 seasons for the Spurs, before they removed the 35-year-old from the rotation earlier this month while searching for a potential trade. None materialized before the deadline Thursday, so the Spurs bought out Aldridge\u2019s contract. An All-Star in three of his seasons in San Antonio, Aldridge fills one of the few holes for the potent Nets. He can play power forward or center, giving Brooklyn a reliable post-up presence to play with its collection of outside threats. Center Andre Drummond, waived by Cleveland, remains another top choice for teams seeking help from the buyout market. Aldridge was also an All-Star four times in Portland before joining the Spurs."},{"id":520672,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/bulls-nikola-vucevic-fights-back-tears","date":"2021-03-27","title":"Bulls' Nikola Vucevic fights back tears as he reflects on Magic tenure","content":"It\u2019s safe to say Nikola Vucevic will miss Orlando beyond the palm trees and warm weather. During his first virtual news conference as a Chicago Bull, Vucevic became deeply emotional as he reflected on his nine seasons with the Magic. \u201cTo me, the hardest part was just the people,\u201d Vucevic said, stammering and fighting back tears. \u201cOver nine years, you\u2019re going to meet a lot of great people. That was just the hardest for me, just leaving that place. Obviously, it meant a lot to me. Like I said, I came as a kid and left as a man. I guess you guys know the answer with my reaction. Leaving that place after so many years obviously was hard.\u201d As one of the pieces involved in the Dwight Howard trade, Vucevic became the organization\u2019s most productive player for nearly a decade. He established himself as one of the best centers in the league and earned a pair of All-Star selections in the process. The 30-year-old averaged 17.6 points and 10.8 rebounds per game throughout his Orlando tenure. Earlier this season, Vucevic fueled a Magic comeback victory with a career-high 43 points to go along with 19 rebounds.

The Kings have been middle of the pack when it comes to slowing down opposing point guards, but both teams rank bottom-10 in defensive efficiency, so there should be tons of points on the board in this one. In 363 minutes without Sexton on the floor this season, Garland has seen nearly a 27% usage rate. Harrison Barnes (PF \u2013 SAC) $5,900 Barnes is coming off a lackluster showing on Thursday but is in a terrific spot to bounce-back against the Cavaliers, who surrender the 7th most FanDuel points to opposing power forwards this season. Rui Hachimura (SF \u2013 WAS) $5,700 Hachimura has topped at least 30 FanDuel points in five of his last seven games and should be in for a bigger role if Bradley Beal ends up sitting due to foot soreness. The Pistons have been average against opposing small forwards this season, but this game currently boasts the highest over-under on the slate at 229.5. Robert Williams (C \u2013 BOS) $5,600 In a head-scratching move, Williams has seen his price tag drop $400 after being priced at $6,000 on Friday. All he did in Friday\u2019s win over the Bucks was produce seven points, nine rebounds, six assists, five blocks, and two steals en route to 47.8 FanDuel points. Boston\u2019s new starting center should be a fixture in DFS against the Thunder and is easily one of the best values on the slate. Marcus Smart (SG \u2013 BOS) $5,500 Smart has been terrific since returning from injury earlier this month and should see a boost in usage with Kemba Walker likely ruled out due to Boston playing on the second night of a back-to-back set. He\u2019s averaged 30.2 FanDuel points over his last six games and gets a cakewalk matchup against an ailing Thunder backcourt. Jae\u2019Sean Tate (PF \u2013 HOU) $5,400 Tate has averaged over 30 minutes per game for the Rockets in March and gets a Timberwolves team who gives up the fourth-most FanDuel points to opposing power forwards this season. He sees a boost in value with Danuel House Jr. missing time due to personal reasons. Moses Brown (C \u2013 OKC) $5,400 Veteran Al Horford is resting more often this season, and if he sits out on Saturday, Brown could feast. He\u2019s averaging 1.19 FanDuel points per minute during his time without Horford on the floor. Nickeil Alexander-Walker (SG \u2013 NOP) $5,300 Alexander-Walker has been stellar while filling in for the injured Lonzo Ball over the last couple of games. He\u2019s scored 30 or more FanDuel points in three of his last five games and should see 30+ minutes against the Mavericks with Ball ruled out in advance. Saddiq Bey (SF \u2013 DET) $5,200 Bey has produced nicely for Detroit in March and is seeing heavy minutes as a result. Over his last four games, the rookie has averaged 16.7 points on more than three treys per game and gets a Wizards squad surrendering the fifth-most FanDuel points to opposing small forwards this season. Jalen Brunson (PG \u2013 DAL) $4,800 This one is solely based on Luka Doncic\u2019s status as a back issue forced him to miss Friday\u2019s loss to the Pacers. You should all know the drill by now. Brunson is a fixture in DFS anytime Luka sits, and that won\u2019t change in Saturday\u2019s game against the Pelicans. He\u2019s seeing a 24% usage rate and averaging 1.0 FanDuel point per minute during his time without Doncic on the floor."},{"id":519901,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/female-officials-qa-part-2-womens-empowerment","date":"2021-03-27","title":"Female officials Q&A Part 2: Women\u2019s empowerment","content":"This season, there have been a record 7 female NBA referees who officiated at least one game. The second section of a two-part interview is focused on women\u2019s empowerment. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. In January, the NBA saw its first two-woman ref crew with Natalie Sago and Jenna Schroeder. How meaningful was this moment to you as a fellow female official?  Ashley Moyer-Gleich: Oh, my gosh. I was so happy and proud of them. \u2026 With breaking those barriers \u2014 to feel like you have a community that\u2019s supporting you, is what\u2019s going to give you the competence to go out and shine. That\u2019s what those two ladies did that night. They really were exemplary role models of what the NBA is pushing in terms of putting the best referees on a game doesn\u2019t matter what gender. Then, for them being able to take that kind of publicity and the pressure, I\u2019m sure that they felt it doing that game and doing it well and being excellent. I\u2019m just so proud of them. I\u2019m close friends with both of them, so I\u2019m honored to work with them and to be a part of their journey. That\u2019s going to go down in history now for them working that game. It just was really amazing to be able to support them during that time. Danica Mosher: Honestly, it was awesome. When I was growing up, my mom didn\u2019t really harp on my gender. She just said, if you want it, go get it. But now that I\u2019m older and social media is the thing you look at and you\u2019re like, dang, women, aren\u2019t getting as many opportunities. So when I saw two women on a game, I was like, \u2018Holy heck, this is history.\u2019 And I get to watch it. I don\u2019t normally watch basketball, I try to stay away from basketball when I\u2019m at home so I can focus on life [outside of the game]. But I tuned in at night just because it was just so inspiring to see them on the floor and like, wow, I can\u2019t believe this hasn\u2019t happened. It\u2019s awesome that they get to be the first ones to do it. You\u2019re happy in the moment \u2013 and then you\u2019re like, dang, I can\u2019t wait to see three females on the floor. Simone Jelks: Oh, it was great. It was awesome. I think I was probably more excited than they were. I was sending them all types of gifs and funny images. I was like, \u2018This is huge.\u2019 It\u2019s not just one of us out there. It\u2019s two of us, so we\u2019re not going anywhere. Get used to these faces. Get used to these ponytails. We\u2019re here. Danielle Scott: This was a huge moment \u2013 not only for our sport before our league. It was fun watching them out there doing their thing. I\u2019m certain that one day the NBA is going to have an all-female crew. I hope that at some point women officiating men\u2019s sports will become the norm at all levels. Lauren Holtkamp-Sterling: I was so excited for them. I was excited for them personally because they\u2019re my friends, and I was excited for them professionally because it was such an important moment in our profession and on a wider scale. I\u2019m excited about what it means for our profession moving forward. It was this really important moment that happened in the middle of a really difficult season as we\u2019re navigating COVID \u2013 [including] what it means to do this work and do it safely. It was a really good, bright spot in an otherwise challenging season. Natalie Sago: It was very meaningful [to work that game with Jenna Schroeder]. It\u2019s a big deal. We always say, hopefully, one day we\u2019ll get to the point where it\u2019s not as big of a deal. When you see three of us women out there on a game if that will just become the new normal, but it was super. It was an awesome day and it was super fun to be out there with Jenna. All of the congratulatory text messages and social media posts that we got from, not only our family and friends, but our colleagues and other stars out there in the world. I mean, Billie Jean King tweeted about us. Megan Rapinoe wrote on her Instagram about us. Other powerful women took notice, and it was something that was blown up on the social media platforms. It was just a really special day and evening with Jenna. Jenna Schroeder: It was definitely a wonderful experience. Looking back, it was, thus far, the highlight of my professional career. Just doing that with Natalie \u2013 [we] used to referee college basketball together. We\u2019ve known each other for a long time and we\u2019ve actually worked together before in the G League, WNBA, and obviously in college. It meant the world to me because I think seeing is believing. I could see Lauren [Holtkamp-Sterling] and I wanted to be that. I feel like other women around the world can see us. They might not think about being a referee, but, hopefully, it encourages other women and other industries to keep pushing the barriers. I hope that gives them the strength to keep going. It\u2019s such a positive thing for the NBA, too. It brought people watching that didn\u2019t watch before. The NBA platform is so huge and I didn\u2019t even realize how huge it was. [Games are broadcast] in over 200 countries. In the United States, we\u2019re tipping the iceberg of gender equality. But can you imagine these other countries where they don\u2019t even know what gender equality is? [For] a woman [in a country] where there is no such thing as gender equality can see two other women on the highest stage in basketball. Seeing is believing in it. I hope it empowers people.  Seven female officials have worked games so far this season, which is the most to work games in any season in league history. What does it mean to have the NBA\u2019s support in developing female officials? Sago: It\u2019s amazing. It shouldn\u2019t matter about our race, gender, ethnicity. It\u2019s really powerful that we work for a company that supports us and pushes us. Jenna always uses this little term \u2013 vision is everything, seeing is believing. Putting us out there on one of the biggest platforms in the world with the best athletes in the world is a really big thing. For younger girls and women to see that and to show them that, \u2018Hey, I could do this.\u2019 Just to show them that they can do anything that they want and get into a male-dominated business. They can do it. It\u2019s really cool to work for a company that is pushing females and that they really believe in us that we can do the job just like the men can. Holtkamp-Sterling: The NBA is a leader in so many ways with both social justice and recognizing that the league can use its position as a sports leader to help create equity for so many people that historically have been denied those opportunities. I feel really proud to be part of a league that is on the front end of so many social justice fights. Jelks: It\u2019s huge. We can\u2019t do what we do out there on the floor without the support, without them knowing that in the back rooms where the opinions matter the most with our bosses, that they support us 100 percent. It is huge to know that we are supported. Mosher: It\u2019s great to have that platform and [the league] provides that. When I first started, I wanted to work in men\u2019s basketball. The first college camp I went to, they said, \u2018No, you have to work women\u2019s college basketball.\u2019 I was like, wait, what? I can\u2019t go to the men\u2019s camps? So, it\u2019s great that professional basketball allows it to be equal and let you even have the opportunity to do it. Some people [in other industries] are a little far behind in that aspect. I\u2019m very grateful that the NBA lets us do that. Schroeder: I would not want to work for a company that didn\u2019t support me. The reasons I work for the NBA are because of my ideals with gender equality, racial equality, and sexual orientation equality. That\u2019s something that means a lot to me. If the NBA did not do that I would not work for them. Scott: It\u2019s amazing to be a part of an organization that\u2019s leading the way and giving women the opportunity to showcase our skills in a professional men\u2019s sport. I\u2019m grateful for the women who\u2019ve come before me and laid the foundation. We will continue their work for the women who come after us. What advice have you shared with girls or women who want to become officials? Sago: Don\u2019t let anybody tell you that you can\u2019t do something. If you have a goal and a dream, go tackle it because at this day and age, if you have the ability to do it, you should be able to be awarded that job opportunity and be able to do it. Holtkamp-Sterling: Oh, I say go for it. I think that they should follow their passion. They love the sport and are willing to put the work in, the time in and trust that they can develop the skills they can do it. I would say if anybody\u2019s even remotely interested in trying it to go for it because it\u2019s a really rewarding career. Moyer-Gleich : Oh, my biggest advice \u2014 that\u2019s a tough question. When I was going to the [G-League] try-out, George Tolliver had everyone in the room write down their goal in a notebook. My goal was to be a sponge. My goal was never to be a G League referee, even though that\u2019s what I wanted. My goal was never to be in the WNBA or my goal was never to be an NBA official. I just wanted to be the best referee that I could be. I wanted to be a sponge and just soak up all the knowledge and wisdom. Anything that anyone was willing to offer me I just wanted to be able to soak it up. That would probably be my biggest piece of advice. Whether you get cheers or accolades, a lot of it\u2019s out of your control. It\u2019s important to just remember to control what you can control. Go out there with that mindset of wanting to be the best referee, whatever is your journey. If you can enjoy the journey along the way, then it makes it all worth it at the end of the day. Jelks: Be yourself. This industry is really competitive. In male-dominated industries like this, it\u2019s easy to try to emulate other people. Try to think this is the way to make it to the top, but the only way to find success when you\u2019re at the top is to be truthful to who you are. Embrace who you are and that will shine in all of your work. Mosher: I have a few females that message me every so often. I just tell them to be you. Don\u2019t be afraid to pursue men\u2019s basketball. Who cares who you piss off in the process? If that\u2019s your goal, go and get it. If you\u2019re good, [the NBA] will find you, they\u2019ll let you work and you can do it. Pursue your passions really is what I tell them. Schroeder: Be yourself because everyone else is taken. I wouldn\u2019t want to work for a company who didn\u2019t want me for me, if I couldn\u2019t just be my genuine, authentic self and be who I am and they can\u2019t accept that. That\u2019s probably not a good fit for anybody. You need to keep it moving, and find something that is a good fit. I believe in gender equality and racial equality. If the company you work for appreciates that, then you\u2019re in the right spot. And if they don\u2019t, maybe you\u2019re not in the right spot. Scott: When I have these talks with the young ladies, I tell them to study their rules and mechanics because that\u2019ll give them confidence while they\u2019re out there on the floor. Work as many games as you can. Work on a couple of things each game. Find someone you can trust to send plays to and get advice from. And I stress the importance of finding that balance between officiating your personal life, just so you don\u2019t get burnt out and you stay fresh. What is the shared experience between you and the other female officials in the league? Sago: We have a great group. We text all the time \u2013 we\u2019re in a group chain. There\u2019s not many of us, so we need to have our girl talk sometimes, too. We really push each other and we just want everyone to be successful. It shouldn\u2019t be a competition. I want success for all these other women that are with me right now, and then the ones that are coming in after us. We have a great group of us girls. We do vacations together in the summer \u2014so we\u2019re really close and tight-knit. Holtkamp-Sterling: First and foremost, it\u2019s friendship. There\u2019s a bond for us about going through the training system and then being on the staff together. We support each other. We encourage each other. Knowing that we\u2019re in it together and can learn from each other\u2019s experience and lean on each other when we need it has been huge. Jelks: Our experience as women have brought us close together. It\u2019s more than just officiating between us women. It is a lifestyle that we have chosen that we have to have. We have to find strength and a lot more to keep us going and we provide that to each other. I\u2019m so happy that the women on this staff are in the business of empowering other women. Moyer-Gleich: It\u2019s kind of natural. You\u2019re going to gravitate towards a group of people who kind of have similar views and align with your personality, whether that\u2019s male or female, but I think all of us being women on the staff and because there are so few of us, I think it\u2019s just kind of natural for us to have an immediate connection just so that we can lean on each other. There are things that you can talk woman to woman that you can\u2019t really talk to a man about or how are you going to handle a certain situation that men don\u2019t really have to deal with. It\u2019s nice to have that support system and encouragement if one of us is down or sick. Two women have children, and if their children are sick or they\u2019re missing being at home with their kids, it\u2019s nice to have other women who can understand what you\u2019re going through. I think it\u2019s important for us to foster those relationships and stay tight-knit because, at the end of the day, we\u2019re going to be supportive and encouraging one another. Schroeder: We\u2019re actually all pretty close. We go on vacations together. \u2026 There are five full-time women and two non-staff. We should help each other out \u2013 that\u2019s what you\u2019re supposed to do. You\u2019re supposed to empower other women. We definitely need each other to lean on. We have different experiences than the men do. We have fans telling us to go back to the kitchen and saying crazy things to it. Men don\u2019t get that, so we need each other to lean on in those circumstances. Scott: It\u2019s really cool because we\u2019ve all kind of been on our separate journeys in our individual careers, and now we\u2019ve all come together within this association and we\u2019re making history this season. I am just super grateful for the memories that we\u2019ve made so far and all the moments still to come with this group of ladies. In celebrating Women\u2019s History Month, who is a woman that you most admire? Holtkamp-Sterling: My mother. [She] is just an incredible woman who finds a way to balance all of the things in her life that mean a lot to her. Sago: Just to stick with like officiating, Lauren [Holtkamp-Sterling] has been a big role model for me personally, and I know some of the other girls probably have that answer as well. Before I got hired, we were going to Summer League and I was in the WNBA. She texted a few of us and we started a little study group [on official rules]. She talked about her experiences and everything about being an NBA referee. I really commend Lauren for taking some of us under her wing and really showing us the ropes, because she was out there by herself for a few years before Ashley and I got hired together. I just thought that was really big of her. You can just see she loves what she does and she\u2019s such a great leader and I can\u2019t thank her enough for doing that and taking us under her wing and just wanting nothing but success for all of us. Jelks: Along with my mom, I would say our Vice President of the United States [Kamala Harris]. Moyer-Gleich: The woman I admire most is my mom. She is my rock and my role model. She is incredible. She\u2019s not only my mom, but she\u2019s my best friend. She\u2019s my confidant, who talks to me while I\u2019m stuck in the airport for our delays; who talks to me when I have to buy every single dinner in my hotel room because of COVID she sits and has dinner with me on FaceTime. She is definitely my biggest supporter and encourager, and she is everything that I want to be one day when I\u2019m a mom. Mosher : I\u2019m going to give the cliche answer, but I really think it\u2019s true: my mother. She raised two children in a very small town, low income by herself, and pushed me to strive for my goals. She\u2019s the one I look up to and what I do, I do it for her. It\u2019s cliche, but I give it to my mom. Schroeder: I gathered [admiration] straight from women who came before me. I think Women\u2019s History Month is a time where we have to appreciate the people who came before us. We have to encourage other women who are fighting this gender equality battle right now. Then, we have to empower women who are going to come behind us in the future to keep fighting this battle. Scott: I\u2019ve always loved Tamera Mowry-Housley and she\u2019s kind of been like someone, I looked up to my whole life. She\u2019s very caring and no matter what happens in her life, she always handles and gets through it gracefully. And she marches to the beat of her own drum and is a free spirit and I can really resonate with that because it\u2019s kind of like me. What progress have you seen in female representation around the game over the past few years? Holtkamp-Sterling: There\u2019s just been wonderful momentum. As the WNBA players have gotten more media exposure that they deserve, and into [the NBA] where you see women being hired in front office positions and coaching positions. You see that happening for us on the referee staff. I think across sports, there is just an incredible wave of momentum towards recognizing that women have been doing incredible work for a really long time. Jelks: I see it in a lot of different aspects. I\u2019m seeing more female broadcasters, and sideline reporters that are female. When I get to the game two hours earlier, I\u2019m seeing more female sports trainers. I\u2019m seeing more female sports psychologists that work for the teams. We\u2019re popping up everywhere. I see female security guards. I always get excited when I see a female, no matter what their role is in the arena. There\u2019s always this communal sense of like, \u2018I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here\u2019. Moyer-Gleich: Over the past few years, you\u2019ve seen Becky Hammon have opportunities. And on the coaching side, there\u2019ve been several women who\u2019ve been promoted in front-office positions like Alyson Feaster with the Boston Celtics and Kristi Toliver in an assistant coaching role with Washington. Coupled with Natalie and me, and then Jenna and Simone getting hired [in the NBA], you have [referee] Sarah Thomas with the NFL in her first Super Bowl. You have Maya [Chaka] who just got hired now as the second female [referee] to be in the NFL. The progression of women being on that big stage of professional sports. I heard a quote: If you can see it and you can be it. I think it\u2019s important that if little girls can turn on the television and see women doing NFL games and women officiating NBA games, then that gives them the hopes and dreams that they can be it. Mosher : It\u2019s crazy to see, but it\u2019s well-deserved like Becky [Hammon] and all the assistants that are coming up. Even in [the NFL] with Sarah Thomas being the first female Super Bowl official. You\u2019re seeing more and more because it\u2019s social media. Women are getting these opportunities, like Renee Montgomery o wning a WNBA team. All the social justice [initiatives] that the women are doing in the WNBA. It\u2019s just crazy to see, but social media is highlighting it. It\u2019s a domino effect and that will just keep going. It\u2019s empowering because when I was growing up you didn\u2019t know those things. Now you see it and you\u2019re like, wow, it is an opportunity for us. It\u2019s achievable, let\u2019s go get it. I hope to see more, but it\u2019s very empowering for lack of a better word. Scott: Since there\u2019ve been more women working[in the game], players and coaches see us more on a regular basis. It\u2019s allowed repoire to be developed between all sides. When you open up the lines of communication for everyone, that\u2019s always a positive thing. It\u2019s great to see how far it\u2019s progressed in the right direction.

In the first section of a two-part interview, each official shares their path to the NBA and the role that basketball has played in their respective lives. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. What role has basketball played in your life and how did it lead to a career as an official? Natalie Sago: Basketball\u2019s played a huge role in my life. My dad just retired from basketball officiating last season and he refereed for 35 years. I\u2019m 31 years old, so that\u2019s my entire life. I\u2019ve grown up in a gym. My brother and I both played basketball growing up and in high school. I played college softball at the Division II level. Then my dad, as I got older, he really wanted me to get into officiating and try it. All he and his buddies would say, \u2018You could be good at this. You grew up in the gym.\u2019 I rode with my dad to a lot of his games. My mom would drag me and my brother to his games when we were little. Once I got old enough to understand what was going on and what his role was, I was like, this was really interesting. I loved going and watching him and all of his buddies, and all of the friendships that I watched him build \u2013 the comradery with one another, the relationships with coaches and table crews. It goes as far as the janitors that get them into the locker rooms and get them everything that they need. After I got done playing college softball, I moved back home to St. Louis and finished my teaching degree. I finally was like, all right, let me just give this a shot. I tried it out and actually my first time doing it, I did not like it. There\u2019s so much pressure. I got grandma yelling up here in the third row. I got all these moms wanting to jump down my back. I was blowing my whistle, which is the first step, but I wasn\u2019t doing anything else. I wasn\u2019t pointing. I wasn\u2019t saying if there was a foul. This [referee experience] isn\u2019t the same for me. I grew up watching [my dad], but it\u2019s way different when you get out there and try to do [officiate a game]. I tried it again a few weeks later and something just clicked. I loved it. They couldn\u2019t get me out of the gym and I just went from there. I told my dad that I was serious about it and wanted to get my high school certification. I did [get high school certification] in the state of Missouri and I worked high school. Then, I just worked my way up college \u2013 D-III to D-II to D-I. I did a little bit of Division I, and that\u2019s when the [NBA] D League wanted me to try-out. I worked there for four years, worked in the WNBA for three years, and now I\u2019m in my third year as an NBA referee. Lauren Holtkamp-Sterling: I\u2019ve loved the sport of basketball since I can remember. I started playing as a kid and played up through high school. I played Division II college ball and then started officiating as soon as I was finished playing. Here I am 16 years later, still officiating from the time I started. Basketball has always been an important part of my life. Ashley Moyer-Gleich: I started playing basketball at a very young age. My dad played basketball. He really was that role model for me and taking on the love of the sport at a young age. I first started loving basketball probably before I could even walk and I was going around the playground with him. I was just a toddler on the sidelines watching him play. Basketball has always been in my blood. Played in high school, went to college, and played Division II. After I finished my undergrad studies, I went back to school and got my master\u2019s degree. I was the graduate assistant for the women\u2019s basketball team. I always thought when I got done playing, I would coach. Never thought that I would turn into being a referee or it was never an interest of mine growing up anyways. A family friend who was a referee suggested that I get into officiating. I was pretty apprehensive at first. I kind of turned them down one or two different times and I was like, no, no that\u2019s not what I want to do. He explained that even if I didn\u2019t get into refereeing, I could just take the test and it could be a resume builder when I did start applying for coaching jobs. I went into the test, which had some on-court training stuff with officiating, and I just fell in love with it immediately. At that point, I was 24 and had played basketball for at least 20, 22 years. I was learning the sport that I thought I knew all over again from a completely different lens that I absolutely loved. Being young and having a feel for the game, my progression in the officiating world \u2013 high school to college and then getting recognized in the G League program \u2013 happened pretty fast. That transition from playing my whole life into becoming a referee was very fluid and definitely fit. I felt very comfortable being out on the court and that\u2019s just a testament to having always played. Simone Jelks: Basketball played a very substantial role in my life. Basketball pretty much saved my adolescents because adolescents can be a very challenging time. Being on the basketball court was one of the few environments where I truly felt comfortable and actually felt accepted. I felt like it\u2019s OK to be different. My strength and resilience was just really defined [by basketball] at an early age. I have a lot to be grateful for when it comes to basketball. It\u2019s great. Dannica Mosher : I don\u2019t think you know the role until you start looking back at it. I look at growing up, playing YMCA, and then all through middle school and high school. When I got to college, [refereeing] kind of fell into my lap. I played intramurals and then somehow got into reffing for an extra $8 a game. You don\u2019t know what it did until you look back at it, but it\u2019s huge because I just love the sport. When I couldn\u2019t play in college and I was able to pick up reffing as a side gig \u2013 that was awesome. It\u2019s a huge role in retrospect, but at the time you\u2019re like, \u2018This is just a side gig.\u2019 Now, it\u2019s like, \u2018This is what I do.\u2019 You get to stay in the game you love. I\u2019ve played it. I\u2019ve loved it. I\u2019ve watched it. Now, I just get to work at it \u2013 that\u2019s great. Jenna Schroeder: I started playing when I was about 10 years old. I played in high school. I had a college scholarship to play basketball, so thankfully I didn\u2019t have to pay for schooling. While I was playing basketball in high school and college, I was refereeing on off days. I got into it, so that transformed into playing and refereeing. Once I graduated from college, I wasn\u2019t sure what I was going to do with my life. I graduated in 2009 during the financial crisis. I started bartending. I didn\u2019t really use my degree. I was slinging beers one night, refereeing the next night until I got to the point where I actually could make refereeing a career. From there, I was refereeing women\u2019s college [games] and I got into the NBA G League, then the WNBA, and then the NBA two years ago. Danielle Scott: Basketball has taught me a lot of lessons. It\u2019s important to enjoy all the ebbs and flows of your journey. You\u2019re going to make mistakes, but it\u2019s how you recover from those mistakes and your talk when no one is watching that truly matters. My parents were both referees, so I\u2019ve been around basketball my entire life. I\u2019ve probably been in every gym up and down the California coast, at least at one point. I knew that I wanted to start my own career. So, I started officiating my freshman year of college. What is the biggest challenge that you\u2019ve had to face in becoming an NBA official? Holtkamp-Sterling: I think that what is the biggest challenge to becoming an NBA official is also what is so rewarding about becoming an official. The training is just so extensive and it\u2019s intense on the front end. I was part of the D-League for six years and I refereed in the WNBA for four years and I\u2019m in my seventh season in the NBA. I think that because the game is always evolving, so is our training and that\u2019s both the challenge of it and what is so gratifying about the work. Sago: My path has been different. My path has been very fast because I\u2019ve only been refereeing for a total of seven years of my life from when I picked up that first whistle to referee that AAU game and I didn\u2019t like it. It\u2019s been very fast. The most challenging part, especially getting in the NBA, is showing those guys \u2013 the coaches, players, owners, and general managers \u2013 that we belong out here, no matter race, gender, whatever. It is the abilities. If we have the ability to do the job, just like our male counterparts, then we should be out there as well. Just showing them that we belong as females. That\u2019s probably been the toughest part, but I\u2019m in my third year now. I\u2019ve had great experiences so far, so it\u2019s been great. Moyer-Gleich: A lot of the people think the biggest challenge is the players or the coaches \u2013 that we\u2019re not going to be accepted. My personal experience is it\u2019s been quite the opposite. The players and the coaches when I came in \u2013 this is my third season now \u2013 they were literally welcoming Natalie [Sago] and me when we got hired together with open arms, and definitely seemed very supportive and encouraging. We\u2019re backing the NBA, really trying to push the boundaries in hiring women, gender equality, and making those opportunities available for women to become professional NBA referees. The biggest challenge for me, I think coming into this arena is believing in myself, because it\u2019s so new, you know? [Former NBA referees] Dee [Kanter] and Violet [Palmer], Lauren [Holtkamp-Sterling], Natalie, and myself, and now with Jenna [Schroeder] and Simone [Jelks] as full-time referees, we\u2019re breaking barriers and we\u2019re kind of crossing that threshold of what\u2019s the new normal. Sometimes when you\u2019re doing new challenges, it can create insecurities and self-doubt. Going out on a daily basis and doing this job with extremely powerful strong-willed men \u2013 players, coaches. Ninety percent of the rest of the staff are management \u2014 it\u2019s all male-dominated. Really being able to look in the mirror and tell myself I belong here, I deserve to be here and stepping out with that confidence. That\u2019s been the obstacle from when I first started three years ago to now I feel like I can walk out on the court and really feel like I do belong here, even though I\u2019m the minority and I\u2019m not, \u2018this is a female in a man\u2019s world\u2019, but I do genuinely think that I belong there as well, as well as my other counterpart female officials. Jelks: The biggest challenge is just constantly reminding yourself that you are enough \u2013 being a woman, being Black. It\u2019s a profession with constant criticism. This is a very thankless job, and so I think the biggest challenge is to every day realize your self-worth, remind yourself that you are enough and that you are capable. Mosher : It\u2019s just challenging to get to this level. I would say life was more of a challenge in deciding which path I want to take because I was focused on being a doctor at the time and then this fell into my lap. So, that was more of a challenge in life and deciding where I wanted to go. This decision became easy when it presented itself to me. As far as challenges on the floor, I haven\u2019t really gotten there cause I\u2019m kind of new, but basketball is just basketball. Life is the more complicated issue. Schroeder: I don\u2019t think people understand the work we do off the floor and actually what it takes to get into the NBA. I can just tell you my experience. From the time I got into the G League, I refereed the G League in the winter and I was still reffing women\u2019s college. Summertime, you ref the WNBA all year long, then you do it [all over] again. G league [games] and college [games] all winter, W [games] all summer, college all winter, W all summer. I did that for three years straight. I was literally on the road for three years straight. I live in Detroit and I was never there for three years traveling. It\u2019s such a grind, but you could taste [the opportunity to become an NBA referee]. You\u2019re so close and you can\u2019t be like, \u2018No, thanks.\u2019 I\u2019m not going to do that. You\u2019re like, \u2018All right, where do you want me to go next?\u2019 I\u2019m trying to get this job. Scott: I tend to be pretty hard on myself when I make mistakes. It\u2019s been an adjustment for me to give myself a little bit of grace because there\u2019s always a learning curve when you\u2019re entering into a new arena. Who inspired you to become an official? Sago: My dad. I\u2019ve been in the gym since I was born. My mom would take us in our car seats and we would sit there and watch. Then, I went everywhere. When I got old enough to go by myself with him and sit by myself in the stands, I did that. So, yeah, my dad has been a very big role model for me in this business. Holtkamp-Sterling: When I think back on my coaches as an early athlete, there were just some incredible coaches who are also women. Seeing their place in sport was really inspiring for me. I also knew that coaching was not what I was interested in. Knowing that I could have a career in sport in a way that they represented, their representation showed me that. Finding a path that I was more interested in than coaching, which was officiating. Early on, the opportunities to even get on the floor with a high school association came through the father of a teammate that I played with in college. He said, \u2018Hey, come to our meeting, let\u2019s see if you\u2019d like this \u2013 and I did, I loved it. I think back on both the early representation of women in sport, in my life, and coupled with the opportunity to show up and just try officiating at a time where there weren\u2019t a lot of women represented in the same way that we\u2019re seeing movement now towards that. That combination was magical for me. Jelks: Life events inspired me because it was never a dream of mine as a child [to become an official]. It was just the way things kind of worked out in my path \u2013 going from being an official as a high school part-time job to retiring from playing as an athlete to picking up officiating. I just think it was God\u2019s way of kind of guiding me to what he wanted me to do. Schroeder: I would probably say Lauren Holtkamp \u2013 she was it. When I got in the G League, Violet [Palmer] had retired and Lauren was the only woman in the NBA at the time. I\u2019m sure a few of the ladies feel the same way. She was doing what we all wanted to do. She was really great because she took a majority of us under her wing, showed us the way and was always there to help answer questions. That was really nice. Scott : Both of my parents inspired me tremendously just seeing them in their careers as officials and how they impacted not only myself, but a lot of other people was awesome. At a young age, I knew that it was something that I was super passionate about. I tell them that I\u2019m carrying the family torch now. What is your fondest NBA officiating memory? Mosher: This is my first year. At halftime [of one game], I was walking to the locker room and one player tapped me on the shoulder and said, \u2018Hell of a half.\u2019 I was like, wow. They notice when we do a good job \u2013 that was just awesome. Knowing that it was one of my first games that somebody noticed that I was doing OK. That was pretty cool. Sago: Having my parents and my brother and a bunch of my family and friends at my very first game in Memphis \u2014 I\u2019ll never forget that. It was pretty surreal to walk out there and see all of them, especially for my mom and dad and my brother because we\u2019re a very close family. I have one older brother and sports is our life. We eat, sleep, breathe it and talk about it all the time. So just to see all three of them up there in the crowd, it was really awesome. My dad has been my biggest role model as a referee, but my mom and brother have been right there along the way, too. I probably don\u2019t give them enough credit that I should because everybody always asks about my dad. My mom, she tailors my uniforms and makes me look good out there. And then my brother he\u2019s always pushed me growing up and just playing in the backyard with him and all of his buddies. I can\u2019t wait until they can travel again with me. Jelks: It wasn\u2019t a moment that happened on the court \u2013 it was actually a moment with my parents. My first NBA game was at Golden State. My parents and I happened to be connecting at the same airport on the same airline on the same flight. I ran into my parents coming off of the plane and just kind of looking at them en route to attend their daughter\u2019s first NBA game was very sentimental for me. Moyer-Gleich: My fondest NBA officiating memory is my first preseason game when I was non-staff. It was in Oklahoma City and a bunch of the girls \u2013 Natalie, Jenna, and several of the G League female referees \u2013 all came down to the game. I could hear them. I can remember walking out on the court and it almost brought tears to my eyes, seeing them in the stands and cheering for me. It was nice that we could hang out after the game and go for dinner, and just really get to celebrate. Having that memory of my first game and having those girls take time out of their busy schedules, away from their families to be there and support me, I\u2019ll never forget that it was really truly incredible. Schroeder: Obviously, the game with me and Natalie [officiating together] was the highlight of my professional career. Absolutely. There\u2019s no doubt about that. We knew we were going to work together when the schedule came out on Christmas Eve. \u2026 We were very surprised because we knew it had never been done before \u2013 then we just continue to work our [game] schedule. We have to focus. We\u2019re in the season and we\u2019re in a pandemic and it\u2019s a lot going on. I was in Orlando first because I had [to officiate] back-to-back [games]. I did my first game fine. Then, I wake up the morning of the game, do our game day meeting and all of a sudden social media just blows up. [ESPN reporter Adrian Wojnarowski] Woj got a hold of it and he [tweeted the news]. It was a wrap from there. It was just absolutely blowing up. That in itself was a really cool experience that I had never experienced. To be able to have somebody to share that with [in Natalie] \u2013 because I\u2019m sure it would have been daunting if it was just something about me. It was cool to share that experience with Natalie as well. Scott: It\u2019s definitely when I was invited to be on the floor and work games this season. My mom was with me when I got the call. I was able to share the moment with her and that just meant the world to me. I looked back at that moment and it was like a new chapter in my life. It\u2019s just been an absolute blast working with and learning from everyone. They\u2019ve been super welcoming to me and I appreciate that.

The Bucks have played in the second-fewest clutch games (16) and have gone 8-8 while outscoring opponents by 20 points over 61 clutch minutes.  Hawks (22-22) at Warriors (22-23)  10 p.m. ET, ESPN \u2022 Both the Hawks (on Wednesday) and the Warriors (on Thursday) are coming off losses to Sacramento. The Warriors fell 141-119 for their ninth loss of 20 or more points this season \u2014 tied with OKC for second-most in the league behind Cleveland\u2019s 10. The Warriors face the Hawks on the second night of a back-to-back; so far this season the Warriors are 3-6 on no days rest. \u2022 The Warriors were without both Stephen Curry (tailbone contusion) and Draymond Green (illness) in the loss to the Kings. This season, the Warriors have outscored their opponents by 99 points in the 907 minutes that Curry and Green have shared the court , have been outscored by 87 points in 704 minutes when they are both off court. They have been outscored by 52 points in 466 minutes with only one of them on court. \u2022 The Hawks rank second in second-chance points at 15.2 per game, with Clint Capela accounting for nearly a third of those points \u2014 his 4.7 second-chance points per game ranks third in the league. The Warriors allow the second-most second-chance points of any team in the league (14.7 per game). \u2022 This is the fourth game of an eight-game road trip for the Hawks. The Hawks are 1-2 on the trip and 11-13 on the road this season. At home, the Hawks have the fifth-best assist percentage in the league (64.2%), but they drop to 20th on the road (57.5%). Atlanta\u2019s defense falls from 12th at home (110.3) to 22nd on the road (113.3). \u2022 The Warriors average the sixth-most fast break points in the league (14.6 ppg) as they play at the second-fastest pace (103.37). The Hawks rank in the bottom third in both categories \u2014 27th in fast break points (10.0 ppg) and 22nd in pace (98.57)."},{"id":519875,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/fanduel-dfs-values-of-the-night-friday-mar-26","date":"2021-03-26","title":"FanDuel DFS Values Of The Night: Friday (Mar. 26)","content":"Bruce Brown (SG \u2013 BKN) $5,000 With seemingly half of the Brooklyn offense out with injury or for personal reasons, somebody has to step up offensively. On Wednesday vs. Utah, Brown played 34 minutes and posted 26.4 FanDuel points. If James Harden remains out, the Detroit Pistons offer a much better matchup for Brown to see a similar uptick in minutes, usage, and fantasy points. There\u2019s a solid chance Brown can reach north of 30+ points, and I see him as a solid cash and GPP play. Isaiah Stewart (PF \u2013 DET) $4,100 The Pistons rookie has played well of late and is slowly starting to see an uptick in minutes. He has consistently reached 20+ minutes, and last time out vs. the Nets, Stewart scored 32.6 fantasy points across just 19 minutes of play. While I don\u2019t expect him to be that efficient tonight, an increase in minutes could easily see Stewart reach the 30 point threshold again. He has a solid chance of returning a 6X-7X value in this game. I see him more as a GPP option, but can be sprinkled into cash lineups as well. Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot (SF \u2013 BKN) $3,500 I\u2019m going to be quite Brooklyn heavy with these value options in tonight\u2019s slate, but again that is assuming Harden is out. In his last two games, the Nets\u2019 small forward has played 27 minutes and 33 minutes, respectfully. While he hasn\u2019t been the most efficient fantasy player, his opportunities are there, as he garnered a 27.8% usage rate last game vs. the Jazz. At $3500, TLC is a steal. The Nets players may be chalky tonight, but the fact that it\u2019s part of an 11-game slate means their ownership shouldn\u2019t get too high to avoid using in GPP\u2019s or cash lineups. PJ Dozier (SG \u2013 DEN) $3,500 With Gary Harris and R.J. Hampton both gone, Dozier should step right into a nice increase in minutes tonight in New Orleans. It\u2019s not like he is the best player in the world, but the troubled Pelicans defense and a slight increase in the pace of play should grant Dozier plenty of opportunities to return 6X value. There should be a lot of points in this game, so Dozier has got to get his fill as well. Frank Jackson (PG \u2013 DET) $3,500 After a miraculous negative point outing last game vs. Indianapolis, I am going right back to the well with Jackson. With Killian Hayes out, and Dennis Smith Jr. questionable, Jackson could potentially see the floor for 30+ minutes. Brooklyn provides a sweet, sweet matchup to have a stellar outing, and he has shown that he can reach north of 25 FanDuel points. This is a bit riskier of a play, considering how inconsistent Jackson is, but I really like his GPP potential. Maxi Kleber (PF \u2013 DAL) $3,800 Despite playing second fiddle to Kristaps Porzingis, Kleber has still shown outbursts of 30 FanDuel point games. Five out of his last six games, he has reached north of 30 minutes played, and as a 0.7 FPPM guy, he can easily reach 5X-6X value if he plays around his normal 33-35 minutes. It\u2019s not the most enticing play in the world, and I don\u2019t love it for cash lineups, but throwing Kleber into a high entry GPP is a solid contrarian play in my books. Robert Williams (C \u2013 BOS) $6,000 There is a lot of news to watch for Boston, but Tristan Thomspon, Luke Kornet, and Moritz Wagner should all be out for this game. With Daniel Theis gone as well, Williams will need to shoulder the load at the center spot, which means he will probably see the floor for 30+ minutes. In his last ten games, Willians has played quite efficiently, scoring 1.5 FPPM. Even if he regresses to his season average of 1.3 FPPM and only sees the floor for 25 minutes, that still puts him north of 5X value. Pessimistically, I see the Celtics center reach 5X value means that he makes for a great GPP or cash play. Cedi Osman (SF \u2013 CLE) $3,700 Taurean Prince, Collin Sexton, and Kevin Love are all questionable for tonight\u2019s game, and even if they all play, I don\u2019t mind Osman in this spot. The Lakers are vulnerable right now, and not the team that ranks 10th in fantasy points allowed to small forwards. Osman doesn\u2019t exactly project to have a high ceiling, so he is more of a cash play to me. I project him to see the floor for over 20 minutes and return right around 6X value. Josh Jackson (SG \u2013 DET) $4,800 I mentioned in the opener that there is a lot of value offered from the Pistons and Nets players \u2013 Josh Jackson falls into that category. Especially if Dennis Smith Jr. is out, Jackson may not garner the start but should still see the floor around 25-27 minutes. Jackson has fallen just shy of 1.0 FPPM this season, so I expect him to return just shy of 6X value in a pace-up spot against a sub-par Brooklyn defense. Jarrett Allen (C \u2013 CLE) $6,700 In four of his last five games, Allen has played at least 32 minutes and has consistently reached 35 FanDuel points. He has seen a consistent usage rate of around 20%, and if Collin Sexton is out, that should increase. Allen had a stellar outing last time vs. Chicago, ending a rebound shy of a double-double. I am planning on him to ride the momentum into this game vs. an injured Lakers squad with a ceiling right around 50 points."},{"id":519839,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/developing-warriors-still-have-eyes-on-making-postseason-push","date":"2021-03-26","title":"Developing Warriors still have eyes on making postseason push","content":"\u201cWhen you come to a fork in the road, take it\u201d \u2013 Yogi Berra. Golden State very much is at a crossroads in this 2020-21 season, except it lately has rolled a little farther down one path than the other. With its dismal 141-119 loss to Sacramento Thursday night, it slipped below .500 (22-23) for the first time since the schedule\u2019s fifth game. After peaking a month ago at 19-15, good enough for fifth place in the Western Conference following a stretch of seven victories in 10 games, the Warriors have dropped eight of their past 11. They woke up Friday in 10 th place, just two games in front of the Kings that dismantled them the night before. Star Stephen Curry remains one of the most potent weapons in the NBA, averaging 29 points per game, leading the league in 3-pointers and, at age 33, still elusive and explosive enough to take over games by himself. The franchise\u2019s winning \u201cculture\u201d \u2013 second in self-promotion maybe only to Miami\u2019s, yet quite real \u2013 is strong despite the absence of key contributors such as Kevin Durant (free agency in 2019) and Klay Thompson (two season-zapping injuries). And even the Warriors\u2019 results at home, 13-8 compared to 9-15 on the road, suggested that they could be trouble if they could lock into a best-of-seven series as, say, the No. 6 seed vs. a No. 3 that might be flawed or hurting or overconfident. Open up Chase Center to a sizable number of Warriors fans, long among the league\u2019s savviest and most boisterous, and the experience might validate this challenging season for them all. Except that Curry has missed the past four games with an inflamed tailbone and is expected to miss at least two more . Golden State is 1-5 without him this season, including the current three-game skid. With each passing game, the Warriors look to be caught in the switches. They have been using the present season for future development, working in the deep end of the pool with young players such as center James Wiseman, wing Jordan Poole and point guard Nico Mannion. Yet veteran voices and the sheer competitiveness and muscle memory from the top down from owner Joe Lacob, president of basketball operations Bob Myers, coach Steve Kerr and the rest still have them pushing to snag a playoff spot. With fewer opportunities to actually do it. The Warriors rank ninth in defensive efficiency (109.6) but 22 nd in offensive (108.8). Even the return of live bodies in the stands of their gorgeous arena has been held up by San Francisco mandates and lockdown limitations. Two weeks ago, Thompson \u2013 stuck on the sideline in rehab after surgery on his right Achilles tendon \u2013 said he has high expectations, not just for after his return, but now. \u201cAlthough our record doesn\u2019t reflect how good I think we are, I think we will still make a run here and finish with a solid record and make a push in the playoffs,\u201d he said. His dad Mychal, a former champion and current broadcaster with the Lakers, had been equally optimistic shortly before that. \u201cIf they step up and be more consistent from 3 and Draymond [Green] keeps doing his Swiss [Army] knife job, doing everything for the team, the Warriors are going to be a threat,\u201d the senior Thompson said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be scary in the playoffs.\u201d Green echoed that view a couple weeks back, too, calculating that the young guys\u2019 learning would keep pace with the team\u2019s ability to win games. \u201cThe true mark of a young team, not executing down the stretch \u2026 as we continue to spend more and more time together, that gets better,\u201d the Warriors\u2019 defensive leader said. \u201cI think this team is poised to put a run together. \u201cAnd I think if we get into the playoffs, not many people are going to want to see us in the first round.\u201d A lot can happen in a couple weeks. \u201cGetting in\u201d from 10 th place via the Play-In mechanism is a far different reality, with one or two games on the road just to glimpse a best-of-seven opportunity. It\u2019s hard to imagine Golden State, after winning three NBA championships and representing the West in five consecutive Finals from 2015 through 2019, feeling much satisfaction over a Play-In berth. Then again, when a team is trying to serve two masters \u2013 the present and the future \u2013 some compromise usually is inevitable. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to win and develop our young players at the same time. It\u2019s our job to figure out what that means day to day,\u201d Kerr told reporters Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s not always simple and clear-cut what the obvious solution is. \u201cI do know that James Wiseman needs to play. He needs to play more. That\u2019s why we\u2019re gonna start him and commit to playing him as many minutes as we can over the [remaining] games. We think we can win within all that.\u201d Wiseman, an immensely talented but raw 7-footer, was Golden State\u2019s choice with the No. 2 pick in the November Draft (yes, one spot ahead of Charlotte rookie sensation LaMelo Ball). His early performances showed both his potential and his inexperience, sometimes on consecutive trips up the floor. But there was time, and patience, and a sense that he and the Warriors would move rather quickly along his learning curve. A sprained wrist and later a layoff due to COVID-19 health and safety protocols cost Wiseman 14 games since Feb. 1. Now the player that Kerr and his staff are feeding minutes is rusty, inconsistent, less sure of himself and exhibiting body language that doesn\u2019t scream playoff contributor. Through 31 appearances, he was averaging 11.6 points and 6.0 rebounds in 21.3 minutes, with little impact on the bottom line. The Warriors are 15-16 when he has played, 7-7 when he hasn\u2019t. Poole and Mannion are showing more progress from newfound opportunities, though it\u2019s still early to know if theirs and Wiseman\u2019s maturation as players will sync up with Curry\u2019s, Green\u2019s and Thompson\u2019s remaining prime. After the blowout loss Thursday, which some of Golden State\u2019s closest observers labeled a low point this season, the head coach tried to take a half-full view. \u201cI still really believe,\u201d Kerr said, \u201cthis team is going to make a run down the stretch.\u201d This week began with some Warriors controversy, with Kerr being asked about the difficulty of the title-run\u2019s end in 2018-19 vs. the freedom to learn-and-lose-a-lot in 2019-20. By the time the coach and his crew get to May, Kerr might have another tough one to fit into his rankings. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

(AP) \u2014 Hornets general manager Mitch Kupchak says he\u2019s not ruling out LaMelo Ball returning this season. Kupchak says the rookie point guard will be reevaluated in \u201cfour or five weeks\u201d after fracturing his right wrist on March 20. If Ball is reevaluated in five weeks on April 27 the Hornets would have about three weeks remaining before the end of the regular season on May 16. Charlotte is in the hunt for a playoff spot, so its season could stretch into late May and beyond. Kupchak confirmed that the Hornets initially thought Ball\u2019s injury was season-ending, but an MRI later revealed more details and created some optimism about a possible earlier return. \u201cWhat (the surgery) doesn\u2019t do is preclude him from coming back this season,\u201d Kupchak said. Nothing is definitive at this point, and for now the Hornets say they will remain patient. What is largely unclear is how quickly the wrist will heal and how long it would take for the No. 3 pick in the 2020 draft to return to basketball shape. \u201cWe have to wait,\u201d Kupchak said. \u201cHe\u2019s casted. We\u2019ll wait until five weeks. And we\u2019ll evaluate where we are as a team at that time.\u201d Kupchak made it clear the Hornets aren\u2019t going to rush him back if he\u2019s not ready. \u201cWhat we\u2019re not going to do is put his health in jeopardy,\u201d Kupchak said. Prior to the injury Ball was considered a frontrunner to win NBA rookie of the year honors. He is averaging 15.9 points, 5.9 rebounds, 6.1 assists and 1.59 steals. He stepped up his production after entering the starting lineup on Feb. 1 following an injury to Devonte Graham, averaging 19.5 points, 5.8 rebounds, 6.2 assists and 1.7 steals in 21 starts.

Then injuries shut down a highly anticipated showdown between two of the Kia MVP favorites in LeBron James and Joel Embiid. Both stars sat Thursday as Philadelphia beat the Los Angeles Lakers 109-101. Not to take away from Danny Green\u2019s big night, but we sure could\u2019ve used another dose of the drama that unfolded on Jan. 27 \u2014 the last time these teams met with their MVP candidates on the floor \u2014 because they won\u2019t face each other again for the rest of the regular season. The Kia Race to the MVP Ladder opens up quite a bit with the injuries to James and Embiid. Players such as Nikola Jokic continue to perform as he\u2019s dropped a triple-double in three of his last five games to retain the top spot. Reigning MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo inched up a slot, too, having led his team to a record of 13-1 since Feb. 19. \u2014 a stretch that including eight consecutive victories. James Harden continues to dazzle as the do-it-all player carrying Brooklyn to a record of 8-2 this month. \u201cThere\u2019s gonna be times they\u2019re gonna talk about us, there\u2019s gonna be times they\u2019re not gonna talk about us, but personally, I just like being under the radar,\u201d Antetokounmpo said Saturday after scoring 26 points to go with 15 assists in a win over the San Antonio Spurs. So much for that. And now, the Top 5 this week in the 2020-21 Kia Race to the MVP Ladder: Last week\u2019s ranking: No. 1 Season stats: 27.0 ppg, 11.3 rpg, 8.5 apg, 1.6 spg Produced triple-double No. 12 of the season on Tuesday in helping Denver take its fourth victory in the last six games, and the front office brought aboard reinforcements before Thursday\u2019s trade deadline , acquiring Aaron Gordon and JaVale McGee in anticipation of the Nuggets\u2019 playoff run. Denver heads into what should be a fun matchup tonight against New Orleans Pelicans sitting at fifth in the West. Given all the talent on the roster the team should be higher in the standings, but Jokic is doing his part, starting every game for Denver over the last three seasons. Season stats: 28.6 ppg, 11.6 rpg, 6.4 apg, 1.2 spg, 1.3 bpg Antetokounmpo sat out of Milwaukee\u2019s win over Indiana on Monday. However, he\u2019s played in 41 of the Bucks\u2019 43 outings, helping the squad to a record of 13-1 since Feb. 19 \u2014 including eight consecutive wins. Quietly creeping up the ranks in the Kia MVP conversation, Antetokounmpo prefers that Milwaukee flies \u201cunder the radar.\u201d But that\u2019s becoming increasingly difficult given the way two-time Kia MVP and the Bucks are playing. In March, Antetokounmpo has averaged nearly a triple-double (26.5 points, 10.9 rebounds, 8.6 assists) while shooting 57.8% from the field. Last week\u2019s ranking: No. 2 Season stats: 30.0 ppg, 4.3 rpg, 7.7 apg The NBA\u2019s second-leading scorer , Lillard drained three free throws with only one second left Thursday night to help Portland pull off another comeback victory in a game that featured 24 lead changes, including 12 in the fourth quarter. Lillard routinely strokes contested long-range jumpers like this one as if they\u2019re nothing. It\u2019s quite telling that the Trail Blazers are 7-11 when Lillard pours in fewer than 30 points. A six-time All-Star, Lillard continues to gut his way through a couple of nagging injuries, leading the Blazers to wins in four of their last six games as Thursday\u2019s victory snapped a two-game skid. Last week\u2019s ranking: No. 4 Season stats: 25.4 ppg, 7.9 rpg, 7.9 apg, 1.0 spg The Athletic\u2019s Shams Charania reported Thursday that James received a projected timeline of four to six weeks for recovery from the right ankle sprain that knocked him out of the team\u2019s March 20 loss to the Atlanta Hawks. Two teams \u2014 Denver and Portland \u2014 are breathing down the Lakers\u2019 neck in the Western Conference standings. They started off the season 21-7 and are 7-10 since Anthony Davis suffered his calf injury. The favorite to win the Kia MVP just weeks ago, James has now missed three consecutive games. Last week\u2019s ranking: No. 5 Season stats: 29.9 ppg, 11.5 rpg, 3.3 apg, 1.4 bpg, 1.2 spg We\u2019re now up to seven straight games missed for Embiid, who is out with a bone bruise in his left knee. Yet somehow, the 76ers continue to find ways to win. Earlier in the season, Philadelphia was 0-4 in games Embiid missed. They\u2019ve since won eight of the last 10 games that Embiid has sat out, including six of seven since the big man suffered his latest injury setback. Embiid\u2019s timetable for return remains uncertain, and the expectation is the 76ers will reevaluate him in the next day or two. 6. James Harden, Brooklyn Nets 7. Luka Doncic, Dallas Mavericks 8.

The 6-foot-8, 220-pound Champagnie plans to maintain his eligibility in case he decides to return to college for his junior year. The announcement Thursday by St. John\u2019s came two days after Champagnie\u2019s twin brother Justin, a star forward at Pittsburgh, revealed similar plans to explore his NBA prospects. \u201cAfter long thought and multiple discussions with our coaching staff and my family, I have decided that it would be in my best interest to test the NBA draft process,\u201d Julian Champagnie said in a statement. \u201cThe feedback that I will gain during this process will be very helpful in making my decision on returning to St. John\u2019s for my junior season. I really look forward to having this opportunity and developing into a better player either for St. John\u2019s or in the National Basketball Association. Playing at the next level has always been a dream of mine, so I am fully committed to getting better on and off the court each day.\u201d Champagnie averaged 19.8 points and 7.4 rebounds per game during a breakout season for the Red Storm, who finished 16-11. He was a first team All-Big East selection after making the league\u2019s All-Freshman team in 2019-20, when he averaged 9.9 points and a team-high 6.5 rebounds. Champagnie shot 43.3% from the field this season, including 38% on 3-pointers. He made a Big East-best 88.7% of his free throws and finished fourth in the conference in steals (1.4 per game) and ninth in blocks (1.0). \u201cI think this is without question the right move for Julian at this point in his career,\u201d St. John\u2019s coach Mike Anderson said. \u201cHe\u2019ll gain tremendous insight on what he needs to work on to become a threat at the next level, whether that\u2019s next year or in the future. Julian has our unwavering support as he begins this exciting next step on his basketball journey.\u201d Champagnie\u2019s departure would be a major blow to the 2021-22 Red Storm coming off an encouraging season. Picked ninth in the Big East preseason poll, St. John\u2019s finished fourth at 10-9 in league play and earned the No. 4 seed in the conference tournament \u2014 its highest since winning the event as the No. 3 seed in 2000. St. John\u2019s was eliminated in the quarterfinals with an overtime loss to Seton Hall. Last week, the Red Storm announced that Isaih Moore and Vince Cole are leaving the program after one season in Queens. Both juniors entered their name into the NCAA transfer portal. Moore and Cole, both from South Carolina, arrived this past season as junior college transfers and were significant contributors. Justin Champagnie, who is 6-6, earned All-Atlantic Coast Conference first-team honors this season after averaging 18 points and 11.1 rebounds for Pitt.

Unable to find a trade partner Thursday for the benched center, the Cavaliers were then trying to structure a contract buyout for the two-time All-Star, a person familiar with the negotiations told The Associated Press on Thursday. Drummond hasn\u2019t played since Feb. 12 and could wind up on a contending team after being pushed aside in Cleveland. The Celtics have emerged as a contender to sign Drummond, according to Marc Stein of The New York Times . The buyout will conclude an awkward situation for Drummond and the Cavs, who took him out of the lineup so they could give Jarrett Allen more playing time after acquiring the young center from Brooklyn in January. Although he wasn\u2019t playing, Drummond remained engaged with his teammates. Cavs coach J.B.

He\u2019s a competitor. He wants to play. He loves his teammates. His teammates love him. \u201cAnd he could have been a jerk and had an attitude and not been good with his teammates and said negative things. But he never did. He handled it professionally. But more so, Dre\u2019s a great dude. He can never stoop to that level and that\u2019s one of the things that we need to make sure that we focus on and remember, how gracefully he handled an extremely difficult situation.\u201d The Cavs were expected to be busy Thursday but only made one deal, sending veteran center JaVale McGeee to the Denver Nuggets for 22-year-old center Isaiah Hartenstein and two future second-round draft picks. Cleveland reportedly shopped forwards Cedi Osman and Taurean Prince but only made the deal involving McGee, who was kept out of Wednesday\u2019s win at Chicago as trade talks began to heat up. McGee was invaluable for the Cavs, providing quality minutes and serving as mentor to their young players. But while the three-time NBA champion will be missed in Cleveland, he\u2019s joining a Denver team with a legitimate shot at dethroning the Los Angeles Lakers out West. Bickerstaff said losing McGee is a blow. \u201cHe\u2019s the consummate pro and not just with the stuff he does on the court,\u201d he said. \u201cThe way he embraced the fan base. The way he embraced his teammates. For a guy coming from championship runs to our situation, it was unique that he was able to take that type of role and we appreciate it for sure.\u201d The Cavs have had an uneven season. They\u2019re 17-27, but only 2.5 games behind the Bulls for the 10th spot in the Eastern Conference and the final play-in spot. Cleveland continues its road trip at the Lakers on Friday night. Drummond, who has not spoken to the media since early February, can now leave Cleveland with a buyout and join a contender. He\u2019s been linked to several teams, including the champion Lakers, who could be in the market for some help with LeBron James and Anthony Davis currently sidelined with injuries. Bickerstaff is excited for Drummond, who came to the Cavs last season after eight seasons with the Detroit Pistons. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason not to root for him,\u201d Bickerstaff said. \u201cHe deserves it as a person. He deserves all the success he has that is coming his way. He puts the time in. He works his tail off. \u201cEarly in the season when we got to 10 wins, we wouldn\u2019t have had those 10 wins without him. We were ranked at the top of the league defensively. We wouldn\u2019t have been ranked if it wasn\u2019t for him. I got nothing but great things to say about my experience with Dre and I wish him the best moving forward.\u201d Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":519299,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/2021-nba-trade-deadline-notes-and-numbers","date":"2021-03-26","title":"2021 NBA Trade Deadline: Notes and Numbers","content":"The 2021 NBA trade deadline got busy real quick on Thursday, with a flurry of deals going down in the final hours. The Orlando Magic, sitting in 14th place in the Eastern Conference, were expected to see off both Aaron Gordon and Evan Fournier, but they began Thursday with a surprise, trading Nikola Vucevic (top three in franchise history in both points and rebounds) to the Chicago Bulls. The Toronto Raptors held onto franchise icon Kyle Lowry, but did sell high on Norman Powell, sending him to Portland for Gary Trent Jr. and Rodney Hood. The league\u2019s top contenders stayed mostly quiet, though the LA Clippers (Rajon Rondo) and Philadelphia 76ers (George Hill) did deal for a pair of veteran point guards. Here are some numbers to know regarding five teams that made upgrades at the deadline. All stats are through Wednesday, Mar. 24. Out: Jeff Teague, Daniel Theis, two 2nd round picks  In: Evan Fournier, Mo Wagner The Celtics have missed Gordon Hayward. But they were able to use the trade exception created from Hayward\u2019s departure to replace him. Fournier gives them somebody who can play on or off the ball and, most important, bumps a bunch of guys down one spot in the Celtics\u2019 rotation. Five numbers to know A bit of film: Fournier\u2019s 1.36 points per possession on handoffs rank second among 36 players with with at least 50 handoff possessions. Here he sets his defender up with a little juke before using the screen. Out: Wendell Carter Jr., Daniel Gafford, Chandler Hutchison, Luke Kornet, Otto Porter Jr., two 1st round picks  In: Al-Farouq Aminu, Troy Brown Jr., Daniel Theis, Nikola Vucevic The Bulls are fighting for a spot in the Play-In group in the Eastern Conference, but are only two games in the loss column behind the fifth-place Heat. They\u2019ve seen the league\u2019s seventh-biggest jump in offensive efficiency from last season, and they should take another step forward with the addition of Vucevic, the only 2021 All-Star dealt at the deadline. Five numbers to know A bit of film: The bulk of Vucevic\u2019s work is done in the the pick-and-pop, where he\u2019s terrific at simply finding whatever space the defense provides. Out: Gary Harris, RJ Hampton, Isaiah Hartenstein, 1st round pick, two 2nd round picks  In: Gary Clark, Aaron Gordon, JaVale McGee Gordon\u2019s best position is probably power forward, so he\u2019s not necessarily a great fit on a team that already has Michael Porter Jr., Paul Millsap and JaMychal Green. And by trading both Harris (who\u2019s played in just one game since January) and Hampton, the Nuggets lose some depth in the backcourt. The hope is that Gordon can help defensively, where the Nuggets rank 17th . He\u2019s is in his seventh season, but is still just 25 years old and joining a team whose two stars are 26 and 24. In that regard, he fits well. Five numbers to know A bit of film: Gordon\u2019s athleticism can also be of use off the ball. Out: Avery Bradley, Maurice Harkless, Kelly Olynyk, Chris Silva, Pick swap with Houston  In: Nemanja Bjelica, Victor Oladipo Oladipo is seemingly still working his way back from the devastating knee injury he suffered in January 2019. He has shown flashes of his former self, like when he scored 34 points against Atlanta on March 16. But he hasn\u2019t played in back-to-back games all season and he\u2019s been neither consistent nor efficient. The Heat didn\u2019t have to give up much to see what Oladipo can do for the next two months, though. Olynyk was starting, but hasn\u2019t shot well this season (see below). Neither has Bjelica (17-for-58 from 3-point range in a greatly reduced role for Sacramento), who\u2019s also not the passer that Olynyk is. Five numbers to know A bit of film: Given how often Adebayo switches ball-screens, Oladipo will be asked to defend in the post, which he can do. Out: Rodney Hood, Gary Trent Jr.  In: Norman Powell The Blazers and Raptors made an interesting swap of wings-set-to-be-free-agents this summer. The 22-year-old Trent (who will be a restricted free agent) has done well with a big increase in playing time this season, but Powell (28 in May, unrestricted free agent in July) has been the more dynamic scorer and the better 3-point shooter (43.9% this season). And while he wasn\u2019t the best defender in the Raptors\u2019 rotation, he gives the Blazers some added quickness and instincts on the end of the floor where they need the most help. Five numbers to know A bit of film: The Raptors had a favorite \u201chammer\u201d play to get Powell a corner 3, with a guard taking a handoff and driving to the right baseline while Powell got a back-screen from a big (whose man was helping on the drive) to the left corner. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

In exchange, the Magic receive veteran shooting guard Gary Harris, rookie R.J. Hampton and a first-round draft pick. Denver also is receiving forward Gary Clark as part of the trade package. It\u2019s the third deal of the day for Orlando \u2014 who first agreed to trade All-Star center Nikola Vucevic to Chicago and then dealt guard Evan Fournier to Boston \u2014 and the second for Denver. Earlier in the day, the Nuggets reportedly acquired backup center JaVale McGee from the Cleveland Cavaliers for Isaiah Hartenstein and two second-round picks. The 25-year-old Gordon averaged 14.6 points, 6.6 rebounds and 4.2 assists for the Magic this season. He was the fourth overall pick by Orlando in the 2014 draft. > Trade Deadline Buzz: March 25 Gordon could find himself in the running to be in Denver\u2019s starting rotation \u2014 possibly in place of veteran Paul Millsap. He would join a lineup that includes Michael Porter Jr., Jamal Murray, Will Barton and All-Star big man Nikola Jokic as the Nuggets chase after their first NBA title. The high-flying Gordon may be best remembered for his performances during NBA slam dunk contests. In 2020, he finished runner-up in a showdown for the ages with Derrick Jones Jr. Gordon even cleared 7-foot-5 Boston center Tacko Fall on a two-handed dunk attempt. In 2016, Gordon was runner-up in the dunk contest to Zach LaVine of Chicago. Gordon missed the playoffs last season due to a strained left hamstring. Clark appeared in 35 games for the Magic this season, with 11 starts. He averaged 3.4 points and 3.2 rebounds over 18.2 minutes per game. Harris has long been a favorite of Denver\u2019s coaching staff due to his defense. He\u2019s been plagued by injuries since being picked 19th overall in the 2014 draft. Playing time has been sporadic for Hampton, who is averaging 9.3 minutes per game. McGee\u2019s primary role figures to be giving a breather to Jokic, who has joined the MVP conversation by averaging 27 points, 11.3 rebounds and 8.5 assists. His 35.7 minutes per game are trending toward a career high for the 7-footer from Serbia. Jokic already has 12 triple-doubles this season.

Seriously: Kyle Lowry, Lonzo Ball and John Collins carried the most weight \u2026 and maybe that\u2019s why nobody could haul them away from the Raptors, Pelicans and Hawks. As usual in these situations, deals cannot happen unless somebody wants what you\u2019re selling bad enough to extend an offer you cannot refuse. Plenty of them died on the negotiating table Thursday. That\u2019s not to suggest nothing happened on 2021\u2019s NBA Trade Deadline Day, which was mildly interesting, could prove beneficial to a few teams come playoff time \u2014 and once again cannot be accurately judged in terms of \u201cwinners\u201d and \u201closers\u201d at this time because future first-round picks were involved in a handful of them. Here are 10 takeaways from the trade deadline \u2014 what happened and what didn\u2019t, and what it all means (\u2026 or might, anyway) for some of the buyers and sellers who struck deals: After a flurry of trades, the Magic are clearly going for it \u2026 in 2025. Once again, they\u2019re pushing the reset button and admitting their last rebuilding project didn\u2019t work. Just like the one before that. And the one before that. Actually, ever since Dwight Howard left in a huff, this franchise has spun its wheels, failing to make great Draft-day decisions, never building their assets enough to swing blockbuster trades, or making itself attractive enough to get the best free agents. Curiously, Nikola Vucevic came in the Howard trade and stood as the face of the franchise, and deservedly so; the two-time All-Star developed into a solid scorer. That said, he and Aaron Gordon and Evan Fournier weren\u2019t good enough to make the Magic a consistent playoff team. Why keep any of them around another season only to watch their value drop further? That philosophy made sense, and in due time we\u2019ll know if the execution did, too. None of the trades involving those three fetched a potential star in return. For the most part, Orlando\u2019s haul of young players and picks will only jump-start the next rebuilding process, which will center around Markelle Fultz, Jonathan Isaac and Wendell Carter Jr. Oh, and because they dumped their best players now, Orlando will surely fall near or at the bottom of the standings this season and get a high draft pick. So there\u2019s that, too. Initially, you may conclude Miami surrendered little to Houston in exchange for a scoring guard in his prime, and such a reaction sounds reasonable. But then, what, really, is the riddle known as Victor Oladipo? A few years ago he seemed on a verge of being special, but then came an injury and a gradual comeback, followed by a value that reportedly sank pretty quickly. Understand that this is his fifth team in his eight seasons \u2014 those who run NBA teams aren\u2019t perfect people, but they\u2019re not dummies, either. Some teams were scared off because the word through secondary channels is Oladipo wanted to be in Miami and, as an unrestricted free agent in a few months, probably would\u2019ve signed there anyway. Miami will soon learn if Oladipo is OK being a secondary option to Jimmy Butler \u2026 and Bam Adebayo (\u2026 and perhaps Tyler Herro) and price him accordingly this summer. Help us understand this: In the James Harden trade, why didn\u2019t the Rockets hold onto Caris LeVert, a good young player who\u2019s signed for three years at reasonable money, instead of rolling the dice on Oladipo, who was and is approaching unrestricted free agency? This was unfathomable then, and insane now, with LeVert hitting daggers in Indiana and Oladipo in Miami. Therefore, the Rockets have mostly future first-round picks (which may fall late in the round) to show for surrendering an all-time great in his prime. Again, those picks might produce an asset or two, but LeVert was not draft guesswork. He was in the flesh and just touching his potential. Again: Just weird on Houston\u2019s part. It\u2019s generally believed, with some historical proof to support this theory, that you cannot travel very far in the NBA postseason without at least two All-Stars. Well, the Bulls just gave Zach LaVine some starry company by adding Vucevic, and if nothing else it should be plenty of fun watching these efficient offensive players tag-team the opposition. This is a solid inside-outside combo designed to give the Bulls options and make them more balanced. What\u2019s also good for Chicago is Vooch is signed for two more seasons and an upgrade over Carter in terms of ability and experience. By getting him now, the Bulls are making a serious bid to be in playoff contention this season, rather than risk being involved in a Play-In Tournament scenario. And if all goes well they can make some first-round noise this spring. Either the asking price was too steep, or the asking price was too steep. Yes, that\u2019s redundant, but it\u2019s really the only reason Lowry is still a Raptor . The three most logical landing spots \u2014 Clippers, Sixers and Heat \u2014 either didn\u2019t want to part with young talent (Tyler Herro) or couldn\u2019t clear enough cap space to make it happen. Remember, since Lowry becomes an unrestricted free agent this summer, teams are willing to surrender only so much for a player who could be a three-month rental; they couldn\u2019t talk money until after the season. There\u2019s also the small possibility Toronto had a somewhat reasonable offer in place, but Lowry didn\u2019t want to play for that team \u2014 and given what he\u2019s meant to the franchise, Toronto probably afforded him that choice. And now he gets to ride it out on a team falling in the standings, while playing peacemaker between Nick Nurse and Pascal Siakam. There\u2019s no question Danny Ainge wanted Vucevic, and has to be annoyed Chicago\u2019s offer was considered better (a comparable one from Boston would be Robert Williams, Marcus Smart and a Draft pick). But the prize behind door No. 2 in Orlando isn\u2019t so shabby: Fournier is a proven scorer, a shooter off the dribble who can create for himself and passes reasonably well. In this situation, if Kemba Walker falls into a funk again, the Celtics can bring in someone who can pick up the slack. Also, much like Gordon in Denver, Fournier should be rejuvenated now that he\u2019s playing for a contender \u2014 assuming, of course, you believe the Celtics still fit that description. After gradual improvement in his first three seasons, there was reason to suspect Gordon would eventually be a star. Well, folks are still waiting on that, because Gordon\u2019s progress hasn\u2019t taken such a drastic turn. In some ways, he\u2019s still the same as before, a \u2018tweener forward who lacks the bully-ball attitude it takes to be a power player, and the consistent stroke needed to live on the perimeter. In that sense, the premier dunker has tantalized without capitalizing on potential, at least in Orlando. But now, he\u2019s in a more productive atmosphere, with more at stake, on a better team with championship dreams. Will that trigger a change from within? This appears to be a good deal for Denver in a few ways: Gordon has the size to match up defensively with big swingmen in the West (LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, etc.), and can be more of a finisher offensively with the Nuggets, especially with Nikola Jokic instantly becoming the best passing teammate he\u2019s ever had. The task of trying to strike gold in Damian Lillard\u2019s prime continues in earnest with the Blazers adding an upgrade for their three-guard rotation. Norman Powell is a good and aggressive scorer, yet not a reckless one. He should be a good fit with Lillard and CJ McCollum, more experienced \u2014 if not more reliable \u2014 than Gary Trent Jr. But there\u2019s a plus: Powell has the size and grit to help the Blazers defensively, where they need it most. He can get the toughest assignment, and he\u2019ll see plenty of those in the playoffs. It\u2019s too premature to say he\u2019ll be a difference maker, but give Portland credit for being aggressive. The only downside is he\u2019ll be an unrestricted free agent this summer and might turn out to be a rental. Last offseason, the biggest head-scratcher was Rondo signing with the Hawks. It just didn\u2019t make sense for either the player or the team: the Hawks already had Trae Young and later signed Kris Dunn, leaving Rondo few minutes at point guard. Yes, his leadership was a perceived plus, but word is some of the Hawks players felt he pushed that privilege too far. As for Rondo, why go to a developing team when there were better options, especially at his age when championships should be the main goal? The Clippers, who had a dire need for a playmaking point guard, didn\u2019t want to give Rondo a guaranteed second season last fall. So Rondo went for the money. Well, as it turned out, he now has the money and the fit. He\u2019ll be the point guard on the floor in the fourth quarter, when the Clippers lapse into hero-ball with Paul George and Kawhi Leonard taking turns going 1-on-1. Rondo will have the ball and decide who gets it. Also, the rapid development of Terance Mann made Lou Williams expendable. As expected, nobody wanted to offer enough to materialize a trade market for Andre Drummond or LaMarcus Aldridge. The former is strictly a half-court player who blocks the lane, the latter is somewhat injury prone and no longer a feared mid-range scorer. The Spurs already cut Aldridge a check and wished him luck; Drummond\u2019s set to be net. Drummond would work best with the Lakers, because Anthony Davis hates playing center and will be thrilled at a reduced role near the rim, especially defensively. Aldridge could return to Portland, or Boston, or Miami. But will either player be on the floor when the game\u2019s on the line, deep in the fourth quarter in the playoffs? Probably not. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here  and follow him on Twitter .

ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski reports that Raptors GM Masai Ujiri ultimately couldn\u2019t find a trade package that compelled him to move Lowry. Additionally, Ujiri had \u2014 per Wojnarowski \u2014 been fine with finishing out the season with Lowry in the fold. Questions swirled around Lowry all the way to the deadline, and there were signs that the Raptors were positioning themselves to make the move.

But neither the Heat nor Lakers would part with the players the Raptors most seemed to want: Tyler Herro from Miami and Talen Horton-Tucker from the Lakers. Keith Pompey of The Philadelphia Inquirer reports the Raptors reportedly wanted the 76ers to include prized second-year guard Matisse Thybulle and rookie Tyrese Maxey for Lowry, moves Philadelphia was apparently unwilling to make. In nine seasons with the Raptors, Lowry has helped Toronto become one of the league\u2019s most consistent franchises. He led them to an NBA title in 2019 and the Raptors have made the playoffs seven straight seasons, too. Lowry has played 592 games with the Raptors and is one of the most decorated players in team history. He is the team\u2019s all-time leader in regular-season assists, steals, 3-pointers made and 3-pointers attempted. He also ranks second in regular-season games played and points to DeMar DeRozan. Playoffs-wise, Lowry is Toronto\u2019s all-time leader in practically every major statistical category except for blocks, free throws made, offensive rebounds and 3-point percentage. Deals had to be agreed to and reported to the league by the 3 p.m. ET deadline. It may be several more hours after that deadline before things are finalized; the NBA holds what are known as \u201ctrade calls\u201d with the teams involved to ensure that all the financial matters fit within league rules, and there\u2019s often a backlog of those on trade-deadline day. The Heat remained in the mix for Lowry, reports Anthony Chiang of the Miami Herald as Lowry had interest in the Heat because of his friendship with Jimmy Butler. Miami\u2019s challenge in landing Lowry resided in his contract: $30.5 million for this season as a part of his expiring deal. To get him, the Heat would have to send out roughly $24 million in salary to make the financials of the trade work. Doing so would likely lead to Miami parting with several rotation players and, thus, altering the overall look of its roster. The Heat\u2019s three-highest salaries \u2014 not including All-Stars Bam Adebayo and Butler \u2014 are Goran Dragic, Andre Iguodala and Kelly Olynyk. Chiang writes the Heat would have to part with at least one of those players to make the deal work. And, that doesn\u2019t likely include Toronto\u2019s likely ask for a young player such as Tyler Herro, Duncan Robinson or rookie Precious Achiuwa in the deal. Miami was a major pursuer for Lowry, and now simply may try to add him again as a free agent later this year. But the reigning Eastern Conference champions pivoted in time to add Victor Oladipo \u2014 a two-time All-Star, a 21-point-per-game scorer this season and someone only three years removed from All-NBA status \u2014 from Houston, in exchange for Kelly Olynyk, Avery Bradley and a pick swap in 2022. \u201cThe actual day, there\u2019s usually a lot more hype and then a lot less action than what is speculated,\u201d Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. \u201cThat was probably true this year as well.\u201d Had Miami gotten Lowry, it would have held his Bird Rights and could re-sign him this offseason. But as has been previously reported, acquiring Lowry at the cost of some of Miami\u2019s key veteran players gave the Heat second thoughts on making that deal.

One of the biggest beneficiaries has been Andrew Wiggins, who has seen a 28.2 percent usage rate in the past four games. Some people may be hesitant to trust Wiggins after his dud against the Philadelphia 76ers on Tuesday. Still, he draws the league\u2019s worst defense \u2013 in terms of defensive efficiency \u2013 on Thursday, giving him a perfect chance to bounce back. R.J. Barrett (NYK) $6,500  R.J. Barrett is amid a nice groove right now for the Knicks as he\u2019s hit 5x value at his current price in five out of his last six games. The second-year player out of Duke had an opportunity to face the Wizards on Tuesday and delivered 38.5 FD points on a $6,200 salary (6.2x value). Luckily for Barrett, he gets another chance to face Washington on Thursday, allowing him to play against the fastest-paced team in the NBA. Buddy Hield (SAC) $6,400 While everyone gravitates the game between the Warriors and the Kings in their builds, Buddy Hield could be a popular choice \u2013 and for a good reason. Hield has played in 34+ minutes in 11 of his last 12 games, proving that he has a consistent role for Sacramento. The 3-point extraordinaire could easily hit 5x value as he squares off with Golden State, who is allowing the seventh-most FD points per game to shooting guards. Tyrese Haliburton is also in play for the Kings. Jordan Poole (GSW) $6,200  What a surprise, right? Another player from the impending fast-paced contest between the Warriors and the Kings. Besides Wiggins, Jordan Poole has seen his role in Golden State\u2019s offense drastically change with Curry out with a tailbone ailment. In the last four games, Poole has garnered a 25.1 usage percentage and has a true shooting percentage of 63.1. After a disappointing outing on Tuesday versus Philadelphia, Poole should compile enough statistics to hit 5x value on Thursday. Marcus Morris (LAC) $5,000 Marcus Morris fits the bill at the power forward position among the value picks on Thursday\u2019s five-game slate. With Serge Ibaka expected to miss a couple more games for the Los Angeles Clippers, Morris has seen his usage increase to a modest 20.1 percent in the five games that Ibaka has missed thus far. Morris has hit 5x value at his current price in three of his last five contests, and he\u2019ll have a rematch with the San Antonio Spurs after facing them on Wednesday. Even though Markieff is worth a dart throw in some lineups, Marcus is a safer choice at the power forward position. Mitchell Robinson (NYK) $6,200  Mitchell Robinson recently returned from a hand injury, and on Tuesday against the Wizards, he had one of his most productive showings of the season. He would contribute 16 points, 12 rebounds, and three blocks en route to scoring 40.4 FD points. While it remains to be seen if Tom Thibodeau limits his minutes as he returns from injury, Robinson could have another explosive performance against Washington, the team that allows the most FD points per game to opposing centers (59.53). Talen Horton-Tucker (LAL) $5,500 The Los Angeles Lakers are searching for answers on how they can survive without LeBron James and Anthony Davis in the lineup. So far, the Lakers have come up empty as they\u2019ve been blown out in back-to-back games. One player who expects to see an increased workload in the coming weeks is Talen Horton-Tucker. Horton-Tucker struggled earlier this week against the New Orleans Pelicans, but he\u2019s poised to bounce back against a Philadelphia 76ers squad that has surrendered 43.71 FD points per game to shooting guards (second-worst in the NBA). Alex Caruso (LAL) $3,800  As previously mentioned in this article, sometimes you have to take risks to differentiate your lineups from others on smaller slates. A way to do that is by using Alex Caruso in one of your point guard spots on Thursday. Los Angeles is desperate to find guys who can help them win games, and Caruso is a player who contributes a ton of peripherals in the box score. At a $3,800 price tag, Caruso could be worth a flier in tournaments, and he could allow you to spend up elsewhere. Nicolas Batum (LAC) $3,800 Along with Caruso, Nicolas Batum could be a viable salary-saving option on Thursday. Batum notched 28.8 FD points on Wednesday in the Clippers\u2019 lopsided win over the Spurs. Los Angeles will get another crack at San Antonio on Thursday, and Batum could see another bump in playing time, especially if either Paul George or Kawhi Leonard rests on the back-to-back. James Wiseman (GSW) $4,200  Throughout the entire season, it\u2019s been tough to pinpoint how Steve Kerr will utilize James Wiseman. The rookie center has performed inconsistently in his first year, and he\u2019s still trying to discover his role on the team. But on Thursday, if Wiseman gets 25+ minutes against the Kings, who are permitting 56.09 FD points per game to centers, then Wiseman could return a ton of value on Thursday at a thin position."},{"id":519173,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-lamarcus-aldridge-spurs-working-on-buyout-heat-emerge-as-frontrunner","date":"2021-03-25","title":"LaMarcus Aldridge bought out by Spurs; Heat emerge as 'frontrunner'","content":"Veteran forward LaMarcus Aldridge has completed his buyout process with the San Antonio Spurs and will enter free agency, the team announced.

Here\u2019s a recap of all the reported deals and rumblings that occurred before the end of in-season trading.  March 22 | March 23 | March 24 | March 25 Seven-time All-Star LaMarcus Aldridge has completed his buyout process with the San Antonio Spurs and will enter free agency, the team announced. According to Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN , the Miami Heat are the \u201cfrontrunner\u201d to land Aldridge, but the veteran forward reportedly plans to \u201ctalk with several teams\u201d before making his decision. \u2014 5:21 p.m. Toronto Raptors guard Kyle Lowry was perhaps the top potential prize on the trade market going into today\u2019s 3 p.m. ET deadline. And while there were plenty of teams in pursuit of him throughout the day, he\u2019ll ultimately finish the 2020-21 season right where he started: with the Raptors. ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski reports that Raptors GM Masai Ujiri ultimately couldn\u2019t find a trade package that compelled him to move Lowry. Additionally, Ujiri had \u2014 per Wojnarowski \u2014 been fine with finishing out the season with Lowry in the fold . \u2014 3:55 p.m. The New Orleans Pelicans are apparently parting with one of their guards and keeping another one in the fold. ESPN\u2019s Andrew Lopez reports the Pelicans are sending JJ Redick and big man Nicolo Melli to the Dallas Mavericks for forwards Wesley Iwundu, James Johnson and a 2021 second-round pick. Additionally, ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski reports guard Lonzo Ball will not be dealt at today\u2019s deadline. A career 41.5% 3-point shooter, Redick is in the final year of his contract and is one of the most consistent shooters in NBA history. However, he has struggled with his 3-point shot this season (36.4%) and is averaging 8.7 ppg \u2014 his lowest mark since 2008-09. Johnson is averaging 5.7 ppg and 3.0 rpg and is known for his defense and toughness, while Iwundu is averaging 2.1 ppg and 1.9 rpg but was known as a solid role player during his days with the Orlando Magic (2017-20). Ball is in the midst of a career-best season (14.2 ppg, 4.2 rpg, 5.6 apg, 1.3 spg) and had his name bandied about in trade talks. However, he will not be dealt, per Wojnarowski, and is an unrestricted free agent this summer. \u2014 3:35 p.m. Fourth-year center Daniel Theis is reportedly moving on to the Chicago Bulls, per Adrian Wojnarowski. The Celtics center is averaging 9.5 ppg, 5.2 rpg and 1.6 apg and will be swapped for Mo Wagner, whom the Bulls reportedly acquired earlier today in a trade with Washington. There could be more moves afoot for Boston, however, as Mark Murphy of the Boston Globe reports that guards Jeff Teague and Javonte Green could be on the move soon as well as a possible third team could get involved in the Celtics-Bulls trade. \u2014 3:29 p.m. The Golden State Warriors have reportedly made a pair of trades, sending Brad Wanamaker to the Charlotte Hornets and forward Marquese Chriss to the San Antonio Spurs. The complete details of both trades have yet to be reported. The 31-year-old Wanamaker is averaging 4.7 ppg and 2.5 apg during his third season in the NBA, while Chriss played in just two games this season (6.5 ppg, 6.5 rpg) before a broken leg sidelined him. \u2014 3:25 p.m. Former All-Star swingman Victor Oladipo is headed back to the Eastern Conference. Per multiple reports, the Houston Rockets have dealt Oladipo to the Miami Heat for Avery Bradley, Kelly Olynyk and a 2022 pick swap. Oladipo\u2019s name was mentioned in trade chatter leading up to the deadline and the Heat were, at times, linked to such talks. This season, Oladipo is averaging 20.8 ppg, 5.0 rpg, 4.7 apg and 1.2 spg with Houston and turned down a reported two-year extension with the Rockets back in late February. \u2014 3:10 p.m. The Toronto Raptors have dealt reserve guard Terence Davis to the Sacramento Kings for a future second-round pick, ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski reports . Davis is averaging 6.9 ppg and 1.9 rpg this season. \u2014 2:57 p.m. Guard Kyle Lowry is still a Raptor with less than 20 minutes to go on trade deadline day. It appears the Raptors have gotten an offer from the Miami Heat for him and are weighing it. Per ESPN\u2019s Brian Windhorst, the Heat were unwilling to include Tyler Herro in the trade, but were willing to include Duncan Robinson and possibly rookie Precious Achiuwa as well. \u2014 2:44 p.m. Veteran point guard Rajon Rondo is apparently on his way back to Los Angeles. Per Shams Charania of The Athletic and Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN, the LA Clippers are trading for Rondo in exchange for Lou Williams, two second-round picks and cash. A 14-year veteran, Rondo is averaging 3.9 ppg, 2.0 rpg and 3.5 apg for the Hawks this season as the backup to star guard Trae Young. Last season, Rondo played a backup role for the Los Angeles Lakers as they won the NBA title. He averaged 7.1 ppg, 3.0 rpg and 5.0 apg. Williams, a three-time Kia Sixth Man of the Year award winner, is averaging 12.1 ppg, 2.1 rpg and 3.4 apg this season. He will bolster Atlanta\u2019s bench as it looks to solidify its standing and make the playoffs for the first time since 2017. A native of Georgia, Williams played for the Hawks from 2012-2014. \u2014 2:24 p.m. The Utah Jazz have the NBA\u2019s best record and set roster continuity, so a major trade from them was not expected today. They lived up to that, but also did make a small deal with the Toronto Raptors, per Adrian Wojnarowski. The Raptors have dealt backup guard Matt Thomas to Utah for a Draft pick. Per Blake Murphy of The Athletic, the pick is Golden State\u2019s second-round pick in 2021. For Toronto, the deal opens up an additional roster spot should the team be able to trade star guard Kyle Lowry before the 3 p.m. deadline. Thomas is a career 45.7% 3-point shooter and his long-range accuracy will surely be welcomed by the 3-point happy Jazz this season. \u2014 2:09 p.m. The biggest fish in the trade deadline-day pond is Toronto Raptors guard and All-Star Kyle Lowry. The Philadelphia 76ers are likely out of the chase for him after they reportedly traded for Oklahoma City guard George Hill. Barry Jackson of the Miami Herald reports that while the 76ers are out of the mix for Lowry, the Miami Heat, Los Angeles Lakers and LA Clippers remain very much in the mix for him. \u2014 2:05 p.m. The Portland Trail Blazers have gotten one of the bigger fish at the trade deadline by working a trade for the Toronto Raptors\u2019 Norman Powell. In a trade first reported by ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski, the Raptors are trading Powell to Portland for Gary Trent Jr. and Rodney Hood. Powell, one of the top targets at the trade deadline, is averaging 19.6 ppg, 3.0 rpg and shooting a career-best 43.9% on 3-pointers. He is expected to decline the $11.6 million option on his deal this offseason and become an unrestricted free agent. \u2014 1:02 p.m. Whether or not the Philadelphia 76ers stay in the chase to land guard Kyle Lowry is yet to be seen. However, the Sixers will have a new guard in the backcourt as the Oklahoma City Thunder have reportedly agreed to trade George Hill there, per multiple reports. The three-team trade encompasses the 76ers, New York Knicks and Oklahoma City Thunder, reports Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN. The 76ers get Hill and Knicks forward Ignas Brazdeikis, the Knicks get 76ers swingman Terrance Ferguson and the Thunder get Knicks guard Austin Rivers, 76ers center Tony Bradley and second-round picks in 2025 and 2025 from Philadelphia.  The veteran Hill averaged 11.8 ppg, 2.1 rpg and 3.1 apg for OKC this season and has been a vital contributor to several playoff teams throughout his career. Bradley, a backup center, is averaging 5.5 ppg and 5.2 rpg \u2014 both career highs \u2014 while Rivers is averaging 7.3 ppg, 2.2 rpg and 2.0 apg this season. Ferguson (0.2 ppg, 13 games played) has seen his time severely diminish after figuring into the Thunder\u2019s rotation the last three seasons. \u2014 12:58 p.m. Miami is reportedly adding another versatile player to its frontline, reportedly finalizing a trade with Sacramento to acquire Nemanja Bjelica. ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski reports Bjelica will go to the Heat while the Kings will get forward Moe Harkless and forward Chris Silva. Nemanja Bjelica\u2019s production and role have taken a step back this season in Sacramento as his 7.2 ppg and 16.9 mpg are his lowest marks since 2017-18. As the Kings have looked to give Marvin Bagley III a bigger role, Bjelica\u2019s has shrunk. Per Jason Anderson of The Sacramento Bee , Bjelica seemed likely to get dealt and the timing of trading him was \u201ctrending toward deadline day\u201d as of Wednesday. \u2014 12:43 p.m. Orlando Magic forward Aaron Gordon has been on the trading block all week and the Boston Celtics were among the teams expected to vie for his services. But in a bit of a surprise, the Denver Nuggets have reportedly agreed to acquire Gordon, per ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski. In the trade the Magic will send Gordon and forward Gary Clark to Denver for guards Gary Harris and RJ Hampton and a 2025 first-round pick. The former No. 4 overall pick of the 2014 draft is averaging 14.6 ppg, 6.6 rpg and 4.2 apg for the Magic this season, but has been hampered by injuries in 2020-21. Overall, Gordon has played in 428 career NBA games, all of them with the Magic, and he ranks in the franchise\u2019s top 10 in rebounds, blocks and games played. \u2014 12:32 p.m. After upgrading their frontcourt by reportedly trading for All-Star center Nikola Vucevic from Orlando, the Chicago Bulls are making more moves before the deadline. ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski reports the Bulls are sending forward Chandler Hutchison to the Wizards for center Mo Wagner and forward Troy Brown. Hutchison has fallen out of the Bulls\u2019 rotation after a solid sophomore campaign in 2019-20 (7.8 ppg, 3.9 rpg), averaging 1.9 ppg and 2.9 rpg in 9.1 mpg. Brown is averaging 4.3 ppg and 2.9 rpg this season as a reserve while Wagner is at 7.1 ppg and 2.9 rpg. 12:26 p.m. The Boston Celtics have reportedly added some backcourt depth in short order as they are finalizing a deal with the Orlando Magic for Evan Fournier. Shams Charania of The Athletic reports the deal is done, which was first reported by ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski . In the deal, the Celtics acquire Fournier from Orlando for two second-round picks. Fournier is in his ninth NBA season and is averaging a career-best 19.7 ppg along with 2.9 rpg and 3.7 apg. He is shooting 45% overall and 38.8% on 3-pointers \u2014 both of which are down from last season\u2019s marks of 46.7% and 39.9% respectively. Boston ranks 14th in the NBA in 3-pointers made and 11th in 3-point percentage, so Fournier\u2019s shooting touch could help the Celtics improve in both areas. The pending trade means Orlando has moved its top two scorers \u2014 Fournier to Boston and center Nikola Vucevic to Chicago \u2014 in the span of about 30 minutes. That fact wasn\u2019t lost on Magic guard Terrence Ross, who tweeted a quick gif of his emotions regarding it all. \u2014 11:32 a.m. The Chicago Bulls have reportedly swung the first blockbuster trade of 2021\u2019s trade deadline day, acquiring All-Star center Nikola Vucevic from the Orlando Magic, per multiple reports . In the trade \u2014 which was first reported by ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski \u2014 Orlando will send Vucevic and forward Al-Farouq Aminu to Chicago for Wendell Carter Jr., Otto Porter and two first-round picks. Vucevic has been the Magic\u2019s best player for several seasons, garnering All-Star nods in two of the last three seasons. While Magic forward Aaron Gordon has been in trade talks all week, Wojnarowski reported earlier Thursday that the Magic were open to trade offers for Vucevic. This season, Vucevic is averaging a career-best 24.5 ppg to go along with 11.8 rpg, 3.8 apg and 1.0 spg. Carter Jr., the former No. 7 overall pick of the 2018 draft by Chicago, is averaging 10.9 ppg, 7.8 rpg and 2.2 apg but recently lost his starting job with the Bulls. Porter is a reserve for the Bulls averaging 9.9 ppg, 5.5 rpg and 2.0 apg and is known for his 3-point shooting (40.4% career from 3-point range) and defense. Porter is on the final year of his contract ($28.4 million) while Carter Jr. has a team option for 2021-22. \u2014 11:07 a.m. The Denver Nuggets are getting JaVale McGee from the Cleveland Cavaliers for Isaiah Hartenstein and two future protected second-round picks, reports ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski and Mike Singer of The Denver Post . Shams Charania of The Athletic was the first to report on the trade, and John Hollinger of The Athletic reports the second-round picks being traded are in 2023 and 2027 . McGee, who started his career with the Washington Wizards, played for the Nuggets from 2011-15 before stops with the Philadelphia 76ers, Dallas Mavericks, Golden State Warriors, Los Angeles Lakers and Cleveland. He is averaging 8.0 ppg, 5.2 rpg and 1.2 bpg in 33 games as a reserve for the Cavs this season. Hartenstein has appeared in 30 games for the Nuggets, averaging 3.5 ppg and 2.8 rpg in a reserve role. The Cavs are still trying to find a trade partner for former All-Star center Andre Drummond , who has not played since February. \u2014 10:13 a.m. Toronto Raptors guard Kyle Lowry is perhaps the top potential prize on the trade market going into today\u2019s 3 p.m. ET deadline, which means Wednesday\u2019s win against the Denver Nuggets might have been his last in a Toronto Raptors uniform. Where he ends up remains unknown, but the list of suitors for him seems to be ever-growing. The Philadelphia 76ers and Miami Heat, per multiple reports , seem to be leading the pack of teams pursuing him \u2014 with the Los Angeles Lakers and LA Clippers also in that mix. \u2014 8:07 a.m.  Andre Drummond has not played in a game for the Cleveland Cavaliers since Feb. 21, the date on which the team decided it would not be keeping him past this season. Since then, his name has come up in trade rumors regularly and that is only increasing as the 3 p.m. ET deadline today nears. Last night, the New York Knicks emerged as a potential destination for Andre Drummond, according to Kevin O\u2019Connor of The Ringer . But acquiring Drummond via trade may not be the only way he moves on . \u2014 7:21 a.m. It has been nearly a month since LaMarcus Aldridge last played a game, a result of he and the San Antonio Spurs mutually agreeing to work on finding him a new home . The trade deadline is here and Aldridge is still technically a Spur, but his hefty remaining contract ($24 million) may make him more of a post-trade deadline buyout candidate than a traded player, writes Jeff McDonald of the San Antonio Express-News . If the Spurs can trade Aldridge, McDonald reports that any return they\u2019d get for him would be a relief. Also worth noting: the Spurs haven\u2019t made a trade deadline-day deal since 2014. \u2014 7 a.m. From Karl-Anthony Towns\u2019 absence due to COVID-19 to a variety of injuries and other issues, the 2020-21 season for the Minnesota Timberwolves has been forgettable. Rookie Jaden McDaniels has been a bright spot from his stats (5.5 ppg, 3.4 rpg in 20.1 mpg) to his overall talent level. Chris Hine of the Star Tribune reports that Minnesota has kicked the tires on trades for Aaron Gordon and John Collins. However, Minnesota is not willing to part with McDaniels in potential trades, which may be hurting its ability to work a deal. \u2014 6:45 a.m."},{"id":519133,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/reports-pelicans-deal-jj-redick-to-mavericks","date":"2021-03-25","title":"Pelicans deal JJ Redick to Mavericks","content":"NEW ORLEANS (AP) \u2014 The Dallas Mavericks have acquired veteran shooting guard JJ Redick and Italian forward Nicolo Melli from New Orleans in a trade Thursday that sent power forward James Johnson, small forward Wesley Iwundu and a second-round draft choice to the Pelicans.

Since then, his name has come up in trade rumors regularly and that is only increasing as today\u2019s 3 p.m. ET trade deadline nears. Last night, the New York Knicks emerged as a potential destination for Andre Drummond, according to Kevin O\u2019Connor of The Ringer . But acquiring Drummond via trade may not be the only way he moves on. Drummond, who was averaging 17.5 points and 13.5 rebounds, is set to become an unrestricted free agent this offseason. Chris Fedor of Cleveland.com reports that, per multiple sources, a Drummond trade is a 50-50 proposition as of late Wednesday night. Fedor reported on Wednesday that Cleveland is also hoping to get at least a draft pick in return and is willing to wait all the way to the 3 p.m. deadline to get a deal done. While a trade remains one aspect of what could happen to Drummond, the other is the buyout market \u2014 which would allow the former All-Star big man to choose his team. Per Fedor, should the buyout take place, the Los Angeles Lakers and Brooklyn Nets would be the frontrunners for him and beat out the Dallas Mavericks, LA Clippers, Boston Celtics, New York Knicks, Miami Heat and others for Drummond. With the Lakers, Drummond would have an immediate starting gig, while landing with the Nets would add star power to a lineup that already includes Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving, James Harden and (the recently-added) Blake Griffin. Per Fedor, the other suitors come into play in this scenario because it would allow them to simply keep Drummond away from joining either squad. As for the Knicks\u2019 pursuit of Drummond, trading for him would work because they don\u2019t need to match his full salary ($28.7 million) \u2014 they\u2019d only need to send out about $14 million. If Drummond were bought out, since the Knicks are $15 million below the cap, they could offer him more to sign there than other teams. While the Cavs try to figure out what happens with Drummond, another veteran center on the team \u2014 JaVale McGee \u2014 could be in trade talks. Per Fedor, McGee was a healthy scratch in last night\u2019s win against the Chicago Bulls. Cavs coach J.B. Bickerstaff dodged questions about McGee\u2019s absence after the game, directing questions about that topic to GM Koby Altman. Additionally, power forward Larry Nance Jr. has generated some trade interest around the league. But per Fedor, the Cavs aren\u2019t interested in trading him and it would take a massive offer to change that position. \u201cGuys are nervous,\u201d Nance said after Wednesday\u2019s game, per Cleveland.com. \u201cGuys that haven\u2019t been through this, guys that are seeing their names involved in a lot of different things, yeah, it\u2019s nerve-racking. At the same time, worrying about it does no good because if they want to move you, they\u2019re gonna move you anyway. I really like this group. I hope we get to stay together.

The structure of the deal, which was first reported by ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski and confirmed by several others, is unknown in terms of which players could shift locales. In addition, Wojnarowski reports several other teams in the Eastern and Western Conferences have been in contact with Toronto\u2019s front office about acquiring the players. \u2014 8:04 a.m. The Orlando Magic lost to the Denver Nuggets on Tuesday , but the big topic after the game was Aaron Gordon\u2019s trade request. Word of it had made its way through the media this week and Gordon acknowledged he recently requested a trade from management. \u201cThere\u2019s been times where I just expressed my frustration to management and the frustration with the losses, the injuries, the way we\u2019ve been playing, how we\u2019ve been playing and how many losses have accumulated over the years,\u201d Gordon said. \u201cSo it\u2019s just my frustration kind of boiling over, I would say. I think a lot of people share that sentiment with me, a lot of frustration.\u201d \u2014 7:53 a.m. Yesterday, reports came to light that the Miami Heat and New York Knicks both have interest in Houston Rockets swingman Victor Oladipo \u2014 but may not be willing to pay the price to get him. Jonathan Feigen of the Houston Chronicle reports that this season and the trade deadline could prove to be a test of wills for the organization as it figures out what to do with Oladipo. However, talks around the league, per Feigen, are that Houston is expected to make a deal to move Oladipo. \u2014 7:32 a.m. Since the All-Star break, the Dallas Mavericks have traded wins and losses and have not had a winning streak since their four-game run from Feb. 27-March 10. Dallas has been linked in some trade chatter \u2014 particularly as it pertains to Orlando Magic\u2019s Evan Fournier and Aaron Gordon as well as the Atlanta Hawks\u2019 John Collins. Brad Townsend of The Dallas Morning News reports the Mavs\u2019 pursuit of those targets are trending out of reach. Dallas coach Rick Carlisle told reporters on Tuesday he\u2019s not expecting a major Mavs trade: \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens, but I\u2019m really just focused on what we\u2019re doing here day-to-day,\u201d Carlisle said. \u201cAnd as I always say, I\u2019m very doubtful that anything substantial [trade-wise] will happen.\u201d \u2014 7:26 a.m. The Utah Jazz remain, in terms of pure win-loss record, the class of the NBA.

(AP) \u2014 Florida point guard Tre Mann, the program\u2019s best one-on-one playmaker since Jason Williams more than two decades ago, is leaving school early and turning pro. Mann is expected to hire an agent and does not intend to return to college. The 6-foot-5 sophomore from Gainesville led the Gators with 16 points a game and 83 assists this season and was the team\u2019s second-leader rebounder, averaging 5.6 a game. He also shot 40.2% from 3-point range. He elevated his play down the stretch, averaging 20.9 points over Florida\u2019s final seven games. His four consecutive 20-plus-point games matched the longest streak by a Florida player over the past 25 years (Nick Calathes, Matt Walsh). \u201cI would like to thank Coach White and his staff at the University of Florida for believing in me and helping to shape me into the man and player I am today,\u201d Mann said Wednesday in a statement. \u201cThank you to all my teammates who shared the Gator uniform with me for the last two seasons. \u201cThank you to my family for always providing me with love and support. No words can ever describe how grateful I am to you.\u201d Mann tested the NBA waters after his freshman season, in which he averaged 5.3 points off the bench. He ended up returning to Florida and becoming the team\u2019s best player following Keyontae Johnson\u2019s collapse in early December. Coach Mike White revamped his offense following Johnson\u2019s still-unexplained crumple to the court and health condition, switching from a dribble-drive scheme designed to take advantage of Johnson\u2019s slashing strengths to a heavy dose of ball-screen action that proved to be a perfect fit for Mann. Mann\u2019s quickness, ball skill and range made him difficult, maybe even downright impossible, to guard. His step-back jumper became a go-to shot late this season. NBA scouts surely noticed, seeing a still-growing playmaker who looks ready for the next level. White seemingly saw it coming, too. \u201cYou want these guys to realize the dream,\u201d White said earlier this month. \u201cAll these guys want to play at the highest level, and if any one of these guys have a realistic shot in the spring and they\u2019re getting positive feedback from the NBA, I\u2019ll be the first one to tell them, \u2018Hey, man, if you feel like you get something and we can get something guaranteed, go.\u2019 \u201cI\u2019ll be the first one to open the door for you and, \u2018Hey, get out of here.\u2019\u201d Mann boosted his scoring average 10.7 points from Year 1 to Year 2, matching the biggest single-season jump by a Florida player (Joakim Noah) in the last 25 years. Noah was the ninth overall pick in the 2007 NBA draft. Mann is currently the No. 15 prospect in ESPN\u2019s draft rankings."},{"id":518288,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/tune-in-tidbits-espn-wednesday-march-24-2021","date":"2021-03-24","title":"Tune-In Tidbits: ESPN Wednesday, March 24, 2021","content":"Celtics (21-22) at Bucks (28-14)  7:30 p.m. ET, ESPN \u2022 Boston won the first meeting of the season 122-121 on Dec. 23 in the season opener for both teams, thanks to a 3-point bank shot with 0.4 second remaining by Jayson Tatum. Tatum is tied with Damian Lillard and Jamal Murray for the most field goals made (seven) in the final minute of a one-possession game (ahead or behind by three points or less). \u2022 The Bucks enter Wednesday riding a seven-game win streak, with an average margin of victory of 12.7 points. They have won close games (four decided by seven points or less) and blowouts (two decided by 27 points or more) during this streak. The Bucks lead the NBA with eight wins by 25 points or more this season; the Celtics have three such wins. \u2022 The Celtics are one of three teams along with Brooklyn and New Orleans with at least two players averaging 24 points or more \u2013 Jayson Tatum (24.9 ppg) and Jaylen Brown (24.7 ppg). The Celtics have been better when only one of either Tatum or Brown scores 24 or more points (13-11) compared to when they both score at least 24 in the same game (4-8). \u2022 Milwaukee ranks fourth in the league in both 3-point percentage (39.1%) and 3-pointers made (14.7 per game), despite the fact that none of their players rank in the top 50 in 3-pointers made per game. Khris Middleton leads the Bucks at 2.2 per game (53rd in NBA). To put that in perspective, the three teams ahead of Milwaukee in 3-pointers made (Utah, Portland, Toronto) all have at least three players averaging more than 2.2 3-pointers made per game. \u2022 The Celtics rank second to Portland in both pull-up shot attempts (28.1 per game) and points per game on pull-ups (26.2 per game). The Celtics and Nets are the only two teams that have three players that attempt at least seven pull-ups per game: Jaylen Brown (7.0 FGA, 48.4 eFG%), Kemba Walker (9.1 FGA, 46.1 eFG%) and Jayson Tatum (10.1 FGA, 48.0 eFG%). Nets (30-14) at Jazz (31-11)  10 p.m. ET, ESPN \u2022 This is a matchup of two of the three teams in the league with at least 30 wins so far this season. The Nets rank second in the East at 30-14 behind the Sixers (31-13), and the Jazz own the top record in the league at 31-11. Utah also owns the top point differential in the league (plus 347 total, 8.3 per game). \u2022 The Nets (39.7%) and Jazz (39.6%) rank second and third, respectively, in 3-point percentage this season. The Jazz lead the league with 16.9 3-pointers made per game, while the Nets rank fifth at 14.6 per game. Utah is among the top teams in defending the 3-point shot as they allow the fewest 3-pointers made (11.0) and attempted (30.8) and hold their opponents to the seventh-lowest 3-point percentage (35.5%). \u2022 While the Nets lead the league in offense , scoring 117.9 points per 100 possessions, the Jazz are the only team in the league to rank in the top five in both offensive efficiency (116.7, 4th) and defensive efficiency (108.7, 5th). \u2022 James Harden (who is listed as questionable for tonight) is coming off a 25-point, 17-assist performance as he led the shorthanded Nets (no Kevin Durant or Kyrie Irving) to a 116-112 win over the Blazers on Tuesday. There have been two games this season in which a player has reached at least 25 points and 17 assists \u2013 both by Harden, one with Houston and last night with Brooklyn. Harden has seven such games in his career \u2013 the most of any active player in the NBA. \u2022 Brooklyn ranks eighth in the NBA in points in the paint at 49.3 per game. They will need to contend with one of the league\u2019s top interior defenders in Rudy Gobert, who ranks second in the league in blocks (3.0 per game) and 10th in rim protection as he holds opponents to 52.7% shooting at the basket while he\u2019s defending."},{"id":518274,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/fanduel-dfs-values-of-the-night-wednesday-mar-24","date":"2021-03-24","title":"FanDuel DFS Values Of The Night: Wednesday (Mar. 24)","content":"De\u2019Aaron Fox (SAC) $8,900  The Kings and Hawks should put up a ton of points tonight. While their last matchup saw only 227 points, Fox accounted for 32 of them (30% of Sacramento\u2019s total). He dropped 49.4 FD points in the matchup (5.6x value against his current price) and should post similar numbers tonight. The Hawks give up the fifth-most FDPPG to point guards, too. Trae Young (ATL) $8,700  Atlanta\u2019s point guard should also pay off his lofty salary. He posted 28 points the last time these teams met (23.1% of Atlanta\u2019s total) and finished with 41.7 FD points (4.8x value against his current price). Look for him to have another strong showing tonight, especially if the Kings can keep this game closer. Also, Sacramento surrenders the fourth-most FDPPG to point guards. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (OKC) $7,000  This price is egregious. SGA\u2019s usage rate ranks 26th-best among all players with 100-plus minutes, and it sits above players like James Harden, Ja Morant, and Paul George. Yet he\u2019ll cost you much less than it takes to get any of those players, and he\u2019ll play in what should be a decently high-scoring game ( 222.5 ). SGA has played the Grizzlies twice this season, and he posted 33.6 FD points (4.8x value) in the first game 37.3 FD points (5.3x value) in the second. Jerami Grant (DET) $7,000  I try to avoid players in low-scoring matchups, but the Pacers have seriously struggled against power forwards this year. They give up the fifth-most FDPPG to the position. With Myles Turner questionable tonight, Grant could have an even easier task ahead of him, too. Harrison Barnes (SAC) $6,000  With Bagley out, Barnes should spend more of his time at power forward. The Hawks give up the 12th-most FDPPG to the position, which bodes well for Barnes, as does his recent workload. Since Bagley went down, Barnes has averaged 37.1 minutes per game. He has double-doubled twice. Look for him to easily pay off this low-end salary tonight. Devonte\u2019 Graham (CHA) $5,000  Ball\u2019s injury has thrust Graham back into Charlotte\u2019s starting lineup. He is a serious downgrade from Ball, of course, but the volume should be there for him to hit value against the Rockets. Houston surrenders the ninth-most FDPPG to point guards. Graham had been averaging 26.8 FDPPG (5.4x value) in the five games before the Feb. 5 injury that allowed Ball to take his starting job, and I suspect that he\u2019ll start hitting that average again soon. Ivica Zubac (LAC) $5,000  Zubac will remain a value play until Ibaka returns or FanDuel significantly adjusts his price. He has averaged 30.3 FDPPG (6.1x value) over his last four outings, and he hit 5x value against this price three times. The matchup against San Antonio isn\u2019t great, but it isn\u2019t a reason to avoid Zubac at this low of a price. Jordan Clarkson (UTH) $4,600  The Jazz and Nets should combine for quite a few points. Although FanDuel lists him as a point guard, Clarkson spends 86% of his minutes at shooting guard, and the Nets give up the ninth-most FDPPG to that position. Clarkson averages 27 FDPPG (5.9x value), so even a mediocre night for him should be enough for him to pay off. Patrick Williams (CHI) $4,000  The Bulls have put Lauri Markkanen on the trade block, and he has played less than 30 minutes in his last three games. That includes an 18-minute showing against the Utah Jazz. Meanwhile, Patrick Williams has gone for 30-plus minutes in two of his last three. This is a bit of a speculative play, but it\u2019s one I feel comfortable about since the Cavaliers surrender the seventh-most FDPPG to power forwards. Cameron Payne (PHO) $3,600  The Suns are on the wrong end of a back-to-back, and that could mean extra work for Payne. It helps that their opponents, the Orlando Magic, find themselves in the same situation. And since Orlando is trying to move some of their players before the deadline, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see the Suns blow them out \u2014 and for Payne to get plenty of garbage-time minutes."},{"id":518272,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/james-harden-questionable-blake-griffin-out-vs-jazz","date":"2021-03-24","title":"James Harden, Blake Griffin out vs. Jazz","content":"When the Brooklyn Nets face the Utah Jazz tonight, they won\u2019t have any of their Big Three or their newest addition. The Nets have announced star guard James Harden is out due to neck soreness and forward Blake Griffin \u2014 who made his Brooklyn debut on Monday \u2014 will also miss the game. Griffin and Harden both played in Tuesday\u2019s 116-112 win against the Portland Trail Blazers. Griffin will miss the game due to injury-management reasons for his left knee and so he doesn\u2019t play the second night of back-to-back games. He came off the bench vs. Portland, finishing with eight points, five rebounds and two steals. Harden finished with 25 points, seven rebounds and 17 assists. Harden said after the win against the Blazers that he nearly sat out that game because of a sore neck. But Harden, who has played more games than anyone in the NBA since entering the league in 2009 with 871, takes great pride in being available for his team. \u201dThat\u2019s just who I am, that\u2019s just how I\u2019m built,\u201d Harden said. \u201dIf this thing was done tomorrow, I know I gave everything I had. I know I didn\u2019t shortcut at any point. It will be over one day but me in the back of my mind knowing, I have peace knowing I did that. I can live with that.\u201d This season, Harden leads the Nets in scoring (25.4 ppg) and assists (11.5) while shooting 46.8% overall and 36.2% on 3-pointers. Brooklyn is already shorthanded as Kyrie Irving (who is missing the Nets\u2019 three-game road trip due to a personal matter) and Kevin Durant (recovering from a hamstring injury) are both out of the lineup. The Jazz have the NBA\u2019s best record at 31-11, but the Nets have been right on their tail \u2014 especially since Harden joined the Brooklyn\u2019s roster. Since Jan. 16 (when Harden made his Brooklyn debut), the Nets are 23-8 \u2014 a mark bested only by the Jazz\u2019s 23-7 record.

Given the way Charlotte rookie LaMelo Ball played through the 2020-21 season\u2019s first half, it routinely got attached to statements about him such as: \u201cBarring injury, Ball will be an easy choice as the league\u2019s Kia NBA Rookie of the Year this spring.\u201d Or even: \u201cBarring injury, Ball is putting together one of the most impressive rookie seasons in recent NBA history.\u201d Injury avoidance isn\u2019t something that can be spoken into existence, however, especially when it\u2019s something as fluky as Ball breaking a bone in his right wrist when he braced himself Saturday from a fall against the LA Clippers. The immediate fear, backed up soon thereafter by the prognosis, was that the versatile guard\u2019s first NBA season was over \u2014 ending with it his shot at the ROY trophy. Ultimately, the media panel of 100 voters will decide, and that decision will hinge on what Ball showed in the games he was able to play, and whether he played enough to merit the honor. For perspective, if Ball\u2019s season truly is over, he will have played in 56.9% of Charlotte\u2019s games (41 of 72). The lowest percentage ever by a Rookie winner was 61% by New York center Patrick Ewing in 1986 (50 of 82). So unless somehow Ball were able to mend, rehab and return for at least three games near the end of the Hornets\u2019 regular season, one of two things is going to happen: We\u2019re either going to have a new floor established for availability\/durability in ROY consideration. Or some other newcomer is going to get the award. This week\u2019s Kia Rookie Ladder reflects the ongoing competition for that, at least near the top. Ball has been slotted into the No. 6 spot as something of a holding pen, ready to move up if he returns (or other top contenders get hurt too, conceivably). It\u2019s also an acknowledgement of what he accomplished this season, individually and for his team. Drafted No. 3 behind Minnesota\u2019s Anthony Edwards and Golden State\u2019s James Wiseman, Ball seized minutes off the bench for Charlotte, earned his way into the starting lineup and soon enough became coach James Borrego\u2019s essential piece. He won the East\u2019s Rookie of the Month titles in January and February (Sacramento\u2019s Tyrese Haliburton did the same out West) and led all first-year players in most traditional statistical categories while he was healthy. Ball had Borrego testing a three-guard lineup with Terry Rozier and Devonte\u2019 Graham to cram all their talents on the floor together. And his combination of savvy play and highlight moments turned the Hornets into something of an NBA League Pass darling for TV viewers. It\u2019s possible ROY voters still will reward Ball for what he did in the games he could. In 1986, Ewing got the trophy while fellow future Hall of Famer Karl Malone, who played in 81 games for Utah, finished third. But more recently, Zion Williamson played in only 24 games for New Orleans, opening the award door for Memphis\u2019 Ja Morant. Williamson got just one of the 100 first-place votes cast, his rookie season deemed too limited to honor despite his obvious potential and All-Star-worthy play this season. Morant got the other 99. The Top 5 this week on the 2020-21 Kia Rookie Ladder: (All stats through Monday, March 22) Season stats : 16.7 ppg, 4.3 rpg, 2.6 apg Since last Ladder: 24.5 ppg, 5.8 rpg, 3.3 apg  Last Ladder\u2019s rung : 2 Now the Rookie of the Year favorite if voters decide Ball\u2019s sample size is too small to merit the award, Edwards will determine whether he seizes the opportunity or wins it as a consolation choice. Signs point to the former, given nights like his 42-point outburst at Phoenix when he became the third-youngest player in NBA history to score 40+ (only LeBron James and Kevin Durant did it younger). Edwards\u2019 efficiency isn\u2019t great \u2014 16.7 ppg on 16.0 FGA, while shooting 38.5% \u2014 but his free throw attempts are up in March (4.9 per game vs. 2.4 through February). Attacking the basket, meshing with teammate Karl-Anthony Towns, benefiting from suspended Malik Beasley\u2019s available minutes and learning under new coach Chris Finch all are boosting Edwards\u2019 play. Season stats : 12.8 ppg, 3.4 rpg, 5.0 apg Since last Ladder: 15.0 ppg, 2.3 rpg, 4.0 apg  Last Ladder\u2019s rung : 4 Moved into a three-guard starting lineup with Buddy Hield and De\u2019Aaron Fox with forward Marvin Bagley out, Haliburton responded and the Kings went 3-1. Off his minutes restriction after returning from a calf injury, he is less frustrated and scored a season-best 28 points vs. Cleveland. The No. 12 pick overall ranks third in scoring among rookies, second in assists, and is hitting 42% of his 3-pointers. His 3.32 assist\/turnover ratio is best among rookies who have played 30+ games, and his 60.3 true shooting percentage trails only Memphis\u2019 Desmond Bane. Season stats : 12.7 ppg, 2.2 rpg, 2.3 apg Since last Ladder: 11.5 ppg, 2.0 rpg, 1.5 apg  Last Ladder\u2019s rung : 3 Though only 18th in minutes among first-year players, Quickley leads the Class of 2020 in free throw attempts (3.2) while averaging 23.2 points per 36 minutes (Edwards is at 19.9) and a usage rate (26.8) that tops all rotation rookies. The 25th pick out of Kentucky has logged most of his minutes at point guard for the improved Knicks, staying afloat as a plus-player. Maybe folks will factor this all into coach Tom Thibodeau\u2019s reputation for favoring veterans and stifling young guys. Season stats : 10.4 ppg, 5.3 rpg, 1.8 apg Since last Ladder: 13.8 ppg, 5.8 rpg, 3.2 apg  Last Ladder\u2019s rung : 7 A contributor at both ends, Tate against Toronto Monday became the first Houston rookie with at least 20 points, five rebounds, five assists and two steals since Steve Francis in 1999-2000. He produces about the same wherever, whenever \u2014 wins vs. losses, home vs. road. So far, when Tate hasn\u2019t been on the court, the Rockets have been outscored by 9.6 points per 100 possessions, biggest deficit among their regulars. Season stats : 10.5 ppg, 4.1 rpg, 1.2 apg Since last Ladder: 17.0 ppg, 7.3 rpg, 2.0 apg  Last Ladder\u2019s rung : 6 An off-night against Chicago Sunday, but Bey had been a consistent contributor in the 18 games prior, averaging 14.5 points and 5.3 rebounds in 30 minutes while making 42% of his 3-pointers. \u201cHe\u2019s as strong as an ox,\u201d coach Dwane Casey said last week, \u201cand you can see what he\u2019s doing with his jump shot.

Per multiple reports, the Raptors are discussing potential deals for guard Kyle Lowry and forward Norman Powell. The structure of the deal, which was first reported by ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski and confirmed by several others, is unknown in terms of which players could shift locales. In addition, Wojnarowski reports several other teams in the Eastern and Western Conferences have been in contact with Toronto\u2019s front office about acquiring the players. This season, Lowry is averaging 17.6 points and 7.4 assists per game, while Powell is averaging 19.5 ppg, 3.0 rpg and shooting a career-best 43.4% on 3-pointers. Toronto has lost nine straight and is in danger of falling out of the playoff chase in the Eastern Conference. Powell, per Wojnarowski, is expected to decline the $11.6 million option on his deal this offseason and become an unrestricted free agent. Teams that are interested in him want to find a way to sign him to a new deal instead of give up assets to simply rent him for the rest of 2020-21. The Raptors have many options in Powell trades, Wojnarowski reports, and are exploring what those are. Lowry grew up in Philadelphia and starred at Villanova before beginning his NBA career. A trade to the 76ers would mark a return home, but Lowry \u2014 per Wojnarowski \u2014 has an open mind about a number of destinations. Keith Pompey of the Philadelphia Inquirer reports that Lowry wants an indication from the team that does land him that he\u2019d get a two-year extension at a minimum of $25 million a year. He is in the final year of his contrat and is making $30 million season. The Raptors would like to see Tyrese Maxey or Matisse Thybulle available in a package to acquire Lowry, but Pompey reports the Sixers are unlikely to include Thybulle in a deal because they value his defense. On the Heat side of things, Miami has interest in Lowry as well as Houston\u2019s Victor Oladipo and Brooklyn\u2019s Spencer Dinwiddie, reports Barry Jackson of the Miami Herald . If the Heat were to acquire one of those targets, it would help their plans for the summer as all three are impending free agents this offseason (Dinwiddie has a player option for 2021-22). Miami would have Bird Rights to any of them and could offer a max deal and retain every player on the roster who isn\u2019t traded, including guard Goran Dragic (who has a $19 million team option for 2021-22). If the Heat didn\u2019t trade for Lowry, Oladipo and\/or Dinwiddie and instead signed them in free agency this offseason, they wouldn\u2019t have the cap space to keep Dragic, too. Heat president Pat Riley, per Jackson, is leading the push to get Lowry and Riley was the one behind Miami\u2019s attempts to get James Harden earlier this season. Miami is not likely to include Tyler Herro in a Lowry deal, Jackson reports, but that thinking could change if Powell is also a part of the trade too. It would be interesting, no doubt, if Lowry and\/or Powell ended up with the 76ers considering the Raptors\u2019 recent playoff history with them. In 2018-19, the Raptors eliminated the 76ers in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference semifinals on a Kawhi Leonard buzzer-beater \u2014 a game Lowry played in but Powell did not. Both Powell and Lowry were key figures in Toronto\u2019s run to the NBA title in the 2018-19 season. Powell averaged 6.5 ppg and 2.2 rpg as a reserve and defensive stopper for the Raptors, while Lowry averaged 17.4 ppg, 4.3 rpg and 8.5 apg while shooting 50.3% overall and 44.4% on 3-pointers. Lowry, a six-time All-Star, is one of the most decorated players in Raptors history. He is the team\u2019s all-time leader in regular-season assists, steals, 3-pointers made and 3-pointers attempted. He also ranks second in regular-season games played and points to DeMar DeRozan.

The Heat announced plans Tuesday to open two sections in their lower bowl only for fully vaccinated fans starting with an April 1 game against Golden State. They are the first NBA team to reveal such a plan, though other clubs are believed to be working on similar measures. Masks will still be required, even for the vaccinated fans, but social distancing rules will be slightly relaxed in those areas. The NBA told teams last week that such sections would be allowed, under very specific conditions and in accordance with local and state health and safety guidelines. If any of the sections provided by teams include seats within 30 feet of the court, fans in those seats will have to take a PCR test two days prior to the game or an approved antigen test on game day. \u201cYou\u2019re already getting a sense that things are starting to change and go in a much more positive direction,\u201d Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. \u201cJust the environment in our building, I remember those first couple games we had at the beginning of the year when there was literally nobody here, that was an eerie experience.\u201d The Heat are devoting two sections for the fully vaccinated fans, where pods of groups will be separated by just one seat. Those fans will be admitted through a separate gate and required to show their Centers for Disease Control vaccination card, or proof thereof, along with valid identification. Fans would have to have been fully vaccinated for at least 14 days to be eligible to be in those sections. Miami has allowed a small number of fans to attend games for the past several weeks, plus has had virus-detecting dogs at entrances this season. The Heat are also one of three teams \u2014 New Orleans and Atlanta are the others \u2014 to publicly acknowledge in recent days that some players and staff members have started the vaccination process. \u201cThings are moving,\u201d Spoelstra said. \u201cAll of us can\u2019t wait until we get our building full again, and same thing for other arenas.\u201d By NBA rules for the vaccinated-only sections, children not yet eligible to receive the vaccine would not be permitted even if with parents or guardians who have been vaccinated. Teams are also being encouraged to have dedicated concession and restroom areas for the vaccinated fans, and make efforts to limit any chance for those fans to commingle with others inside the arena."},{"id":517805,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/lamelo-ball-wrist-to-be-reevaluated-in-4-weeks-after-successful-surgery","date":"2021-03-23","title":"LaMelo Ball (wrist) to be reevaluated in 4 weeks after successful surgery","content":"The Charlotte Hornets announced that guard LaMelo Ball underwent successful surgery to address a fracture in his right wrist.

By comparison, the Lakers posted a 115.3 offensive rating with both on court together, 110.9 with LeBron on and Davis off, and 109.0 with Davis on and LeBron off. \u2022 Zion Williamson enters Tuesday riding a 20-game streak of scoring at least 20 points and shooting at least 50% from the field. He is tied with Karl Malone for the second-longest streak since 1983-84 and trails only Shaquille O\u2019Neal\u2019s 25-game streak from Jan. 7 \u2013 March 15, 2001. Williamson is averaging 28.0 points per game and shooting 64.6% from the field over the past 20 games. \u2022 The Lakers won the first meeting of the season, 112-95 on Jan. 15 , behind a combined 38 points from Anthony Davis and LeBron James \u2014 who will both miss Tuesday\u2019s game due to injuries. Zion Williamson recorded one of his 10 double-doubles as he finished with 21 points and 12 rebounds in the loss. Davis was the primary defender on Zion for 45.5% of Zion\u2019s offensive matchup time and held him to four points on 2-5 shooting. \u2022 The Lakers have only two five-man lineups that do not include either LeBron James or Anthony Davis and have shared the court for at least 20 minutes. The lineup Wesley Matthews, Dennis Schroder, Montrezl Harrell, Kyle Kuzma and Talen Horton-Tucker is plus-7 in 30 minutes and the lineup of Marcus Morris, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Schroder, Harrell and Kuzma is plus-14 in 26 minutes together. \u2022 While the Lakers\u2019 lineup rotations are in flux, the Pelicans have the most-used five-man lineup in the NBA with the starting five of Eric Bledsoe, Steven Adams, Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball and Zion Williamson having shared the court for 525 minutes over 34 games this season. That group has an offensive rating of 118.0 and a net rating of plus-3.2.  \u2022 Over the past five games with Joel Embiid sidelined, Tobias Harris has averaged 24.2 points on 47.4% shooting from the field, 50% from 3-point range and 90.9% from the free throw line, while adding 7.8 rebounds and 5.0 assists. The Sixers have outscored their opponents by 62 points in Harris\u2019 177 minutes on the court during those games. \u2022 The Sixers have won eight of their last 10 games with four of those games decided in overtime. Philadelphia is tied with Indiana and Denver for the most overtime games played this season, and have gone 3-2 in overtime games. \u2022 Stephen Curry has missed the past two games since suffering a tailbone contusion against Houston last Wednesday. The Warriors earned a split in Memphis with Curry out, getting a season-high 40 points from Andrew Wiggins in their win on Friday. Over the past five games , Wiggins is averaging 24 points while shooting 53.2% from the field and 56.7% (17-30) from 3-point range. The Warriors are 8-3 this season when Wiggins scores at least 20 points; they are 14-18 when he scores below 20 points. \u2022 The Sixers score 48.5 points in the paint per game (12th in NBA), led by ninth-ranked Ben Simmons averaging 12.2 in the lane. However, the Warriors limit their opponents to 45.4 points in the paint, the seventh-fewest allowed by any team this season. \u2022 The Sixers rank second in the league in steals (8.9 per game) with three players ranked in the top 13 in the league \u2014 Matisse Thybulle (8th, 1.5 spg), Ben Simmons (9th, 1.5 spg) and Danny Green (13th, 1.4 spg).

But the Defensive Player of the Year Award didn\u2019t arrive until 1983, with the NBA already revving in its fourth decade. That\u2019s when Sidney Moncrief won it. And then won it again. Moncrief, the Milwaukee Bucks\u2019 Hall of Famer, might seem an unlikely choice to excel beyond all others in such a grueling role. He was spindly, coltish, all knees and elbows as he veered, at 6-foot-3 and 180 pounds, around and through attacks still anchored by dinosaur big men who thrashed in the paint. \u201cMoncrief does everything you\u2019re supposed to do on defense and doesn\u2019t take any shortcuts,\u201d Boston legend Larry Bird told Sports Illustrated in 1985. \u201cPlus he does it every night.\u201d Bird first dealt with Moncrief in 1979 in Indiana State\u2019s narrow escape against Arkansas in an NCAA regional final. Then he coped with him for years in the NBA\u2019s Eastern Conference. In assessing weekly the NBA\u2019s top current defensive performers, it seemed worthwhile to go back to the foundation of the DPOY. Edited from a longer conversation, here is a brief Q&A with Moncrief, who lives in Texas these days and spends his time as an author and professional development coach. NBA.com: What did you think at the time, winning an award that was brand new in 1983? Moncrief: I didn\u2019t know how to react. I thought, \u2018Maybe they didn\u2019t know what to look for and just gave it to Moncrief.\u2019 But when I got it the second time, I figured it must be something I\u2019m doing right. So your defense, and getting recognized, was a source of pride? Especially the fact I was a guard. Back then, most defensive acclaim went to big players who blocked shots. Or players who had a high number of steals. And I was neither. Where did your defensive focus come from? Oliver B. Elders [Moncrief\u2019s coach at Hall High in Little Rock, Ark.] pulled me aside one day \u2013 I was scoring a lot of points \u2013 and showed me film. I was horrible on defense. That got my attention. Then I played for coach Eddie Sutton, and we\u2019d practice for three hours, all defense. Made you tougher. Then when I got to the Bucks I had Don Nelson and [assistant] John Killilea and they taught me the NBA way. Most top defenders credit their teammates and their coaches\u2019 systems. But the award does go to an individual. What made you so good defensively? I had versatility, could guard one, two or three. I could anticipate pretty well. Quick feet, good hands, all those things came into play. And just making it a priority. Like Michael Jordan did when he decided to and won the award [in 1988] too. Like Jordan, your defense didn\u2019t seem to drain your offense. In the five seasons from 1981-82 through 1985-86 you were All-Defensive picks, you averaged 21.0 points, 5.8 rebounds, 4.7 assists, shot 50.3% and went to five All-Star games. Traditionally, a \u201cgreat basketball player\u201d has been a guy who can score points. That\u2019s usually how they define MVPs, how much money you\u2019re paid and so much more. In my mind, you could never be a great basketball player unless you played both ends. Whom do you recall as top defenders among your peers? Michael Cooper and Dennis Johnson were two extremely good ones. Dennis had good feet \u2013 not necessarily quick feet \u2013 long arms and he could anticipate. Cooper was tough, quick feet and could guard a number of positions. Joe Dumars played it so well using his body and his mind. Probably one of the best defenders in history was Dennis Rodman. He could guard [all positions], had extremely quick feet and was 6-7 with long arms. And I cannot forget Bobby Jones because of his length and size and quickness. How about today\u2019s best? I don\u2019t follow as much. But Giannis [Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee\u2019s 2020 DPOY winner] certainly stands out. He can guard the basketball and he actually rebounds and blocks shots, too. I look for the guys who do it every night, not just when they\u2019re matched up with a great offensive player. But it\u2019s so different now, because we don\u2019t really have players now who punish you inside. It\u2019s not just the MVP Ladder that\u2019s been shaken by multiple-week injuries to Joel Embiid and LeBron James. They previously held rungs here, too, before heading to the trainer\u2019s room. Meanwhile, here are the Top 5 this week on the 2020-21 Defensive Player Ladder: (All stats through Sunday, March 21) Last week\u2019s Ladder : 2 Gobert moves back into a familiar spot, climbing over Ben Simmons for his body of work this season but with a couple of specific boosts. First, he had a terrific response to Simmons chirping again (see below) about his own defensive prowess. \u201cTo me, it\u2019s about impact,\u201d Gobert told reporters Sunday . \u201cIt\u2019s not about being cute. It\u2019s not about looking good. It\u2019s not about narratives. It\u2019s not about having a big name. It\u2019s about coming out every single night, trying to grind defensively and have that impact on the game.\u201d Second, did you see what Gobert did Monday night? He blocked nine Chicago shots , to go with 21 points and 10 rebounds to narrowly miss a triple-double. The Bulls shot 41% overall, including 6-of-26 on 3-pointers. Last week\u2019s Ladder : 1 As an individual defender, with versatility to guard multiple positions, no one in the league is better this season. On that, we agree with Simmons when he said over the weekend : \u201c\u201cNo disrespect to Rudy at all, he is a great shot blocker, defender, but he\u2019s not guarding one through five, he is guarding fives and probably big fours. \u2026 You can\u2019t tell him to go guard Kawhi [Leonard] or Paul [George] or guard a point guard.\u201d Gobert\u2019s rebuttal appears above. It\u2019s worth noting too that matchup time doesn\u2019t necessarily mean winning time. When Simmons guarded Giannis Antetokounmpo for 8 minutes and 4 seconds Thursday, the Milwaukee star shot 2-of-8 with four turnovers and no assists. But what about the other 35 minutes Antetokounmpo played? He scored 32 points with 15 rebounds and shot 13-of-22 overall in the Bucks\u2019 overtime victory. Last week\u2019s Ladder : 3 Turner was active in Miami over the weekend, blocking five shots in each of Indiana\u2019s two victories there in barely 48 hours as the Heat shot a combined 42.3%. The NBA\u2019s blocked shot leader is averaging 4.26 swats in games Indiana wins, 2.65 in its losses. Other stats: The Pacers are five points better defensively (107.1 vs. 112.1) when Turner is on the court. And he makes opposing shooters\u2019 accuracy drop by 6.5% when he\u2019s the nearest defender. Last week\u2019s Ladder : N\/A You had to know it was only a matter of time before last season\u2019s Defensive Player of the Year and a three-time All-Defensive selection grabbed a rung here for the first time in 2020-21. Milwaukee ranked ninth in defensive efficiency (110.0) when its current 12-1 streak began; since then, it ranks second (105.8). This, even as the Bucks are testing new schemes and working in new personnel from Jrue Holiday to P.J. Tucker. Antetokounmpo and his team haven\u2019t been as good on the defensive end as they were in 2019-20 but there is this: Roll men are generating 0.91 points per possession vs. the Greek Freak compared to 1.02 against Embiid, 1.26 against Gobert and 1.29 against Turner. Last week\u2019s Ladder : N\/A Counting stats might have been eclipsed by advanced metrics for the slide-rule set, but when you lead the league both in steals per game (1.85) and total steals (72) and in deflections (3.9 per) and loose balls recovered (1.4, 1T), and you\u2019re doing it all off the bench in 25.4 minutes per game, that\u2019s good for a Defensive Player rung. Along with this from Indianapolis Star beat scribe J. Michael on the feisty reserve point guard: \u201cIf the NBA had an All-Madden Team, T.J. McConnell would be a lock. If it had the pound-for-pound rankings such as boxing \u2026 McConnell would be champ. He\u2019s significantly shorter than everyone else. He\u2019s paid significantly less, too. \u2026 There\u2019s what he does that is seen, such as his steals and assists, and then there\u2019s the unseen. McConnell injects energy into everyone\u2019s veins. Play up to his speed or get left behind.\u201d (In no particular order) Jakob Poeltl, San Antonio Spurs Mikal Bridges, Phoenix Suns Matisse Thybulle, Philadelphia 76ers Luguentz Dort, Oklahoma City Thunder Mike Conley, Utah Jazz * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Across his last seven games, Poole has splashed 3.3 3-pointers per game while averaging 21 points with some useful peripherals. He\u2019s worth every penny of his $6.5K price tag. Kyle Kuzma (LAL) $6,500 at NO Kuzma has benefited tremendously from Anthony Davis\u2018 extended absence, and he should get a further boost with LeBron James out of action indefinitely. In a favorable matchup, expect Kuzma to return plenty of value for fantasy managers at this price point. RJ Barrett (NYK) $6,500 vs. WAS Barrett has seen his share of struggles this season, particularly as a streaky shooter, but he\u2019s begun to find his rhythm as of late. Across his last 10 games, Barrett has averaged 21.1 points with 53\/72\/43 shooting splits to go with 5.9 rebounds. In a pace-up spot against a poor defense, Barrett should be in your DFS plans. Talen Horton-Tucker (LAL) $6,000 at NO Are we ready for THT to go TNT against New Orleans tonight? With LeBron James and Anthony Davis out, someone has to got to pick up the slack on offense, and the talented second-year man has averaged a healthy 14.4\/4.6\/4.6 across his last five outings. Nerlens Noel (NYK) $5,100 vs. WAS Mitchell Robinson returned to action Sunday but sprained his ankle in his limited time on the court. The Knicks will likely exercise caution with the big man, leaving the door open for Noel to keep seeing heavy playing time. Facing Washington\u2019s uber-generous frontcourt defense, Noel is a huge value tonight. Michael Carter-Williams (ORL) $4,700 vs. DEN MCW is still the de facto starter at PG with no competition for usage. He played just 22 minutes Sunday, but that was his first game back from an illness-related layoff. Expect his minutes to trend up tonight, making him a huge value at a sub-$5K price tag. Nicolas Claxton (BKN) $4,600 at POR Claxton has been huge for Brooklyn as of late, scoring no fewer than 20 FD points in any of his last five contests, while going for 9.6 points, 4.4 boards, and 2.0 swats. Brooklyn will at minimum be without two of its big three and potentially all of the trio if James Harden sits. There are plenty of opportunities for Claxton to get his, especially against an Enes Kanter-led Portland frontcourt. Alex Len (WAS) $4,200 at NYK Len has been on a roll for Washington as of late, averaging 11 points and seven boards across his last five contests (all starts). In that span, he has games of 20\/9 and 13\/12 but also games of 9\/6 and 3\/2. There\u2019s plenty of risk, but if you\u2019re looking for a cheap tournament option, Len is your man. Bruce Brown (BKN) $4,000 at POR This price seems downright silly, and I almost feel bad taking a free space on my lineup, but I\u2019m going to take advantage of the immense value. Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant are already out, and James Harden is a game-time decision. Brown will see increased run regardless of Harden\u2019s status, but he\u2019s the best play of the night if Harden ultimately sits. Jae Crowder (PHO) $3,900 at MIA Crowder\u2019s price has fallen precipitously low, but I can\u2019t understand it. He\u2019s started Phoenix\u2019s last four games and averaged 10.0 points and 5.3 boards across 30 minutes per tilt. He\u2019ll only need 19.5 FD points to hit 5x value \u2014 a mark he\u2019s hit in three of those four games."}]
