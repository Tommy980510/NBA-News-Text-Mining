It\u2019s that they started the season 4-6 against what should have been one of their easier stretches of schedule. Six of their first 10 games were at home and seven were against teams that (before the season started) weren\u2019t expected to make the playoffs this season. Now, some of those teams \u2013 Indiana, New York and Orlando \u2013 look better than expected, but the Cavs have played a part in that with their disinterested defense and not-so-three-happy offense. Is this just a team on cruise control until the games count? Last season taught us that there\u2019s a big difference between the regular-season Cavs and the postseason Cavs . But at this point last year, Cleveland was 9-2 and on its way to a 23-5 record through Christmas. Cruise control came after the All-Star break. A string of wins would have the Cavs quickly climbing the Eastern Conference standings . They got Week 4 started right with a win over the Milwaukee Bucks on Tuesday. But a four-game road trip begins at 8 p.m. ET in Houston on Thursday, the first game TNT\u2019s double-header. Pace : 101.1 (15th) OffRtg : 108.9 (2nd) DefRtg : 112.4 (30th) NetRtg : -3.5 (24th) Team:  Per game stats | Advanced splits | Lineups | Game log Players:  Per game stats | On-off court | Player shooting History:  Season by season results | Advanced stats | Franchise leaders The Cavs have allowed 4.4 more points per 100 possessions than they did last season . That\u2019s the biggest increase in the league. THE CONTEXT  Through Wednesday\u2019s games, the league average is *down 2.1 points per 100 possessions from last season. So, relative to the league average, the Cavs are 6.5 points per 100 possessions worse defensively. On average (over the last 10 seasons), the difference between the best defense and the worst defense in the league is 12 points allowed per 100 possessions. So 6.5 is a big deal. * Typically, league-wide efficiency rises as the season go on. Right now, league-average points scored per 100 possessions is higher than it was at this point last season, which turned out to be the most efficient offensive season of the last 40 years. And that\u2019s a drop-off from a defense that wasn\u2019t very good in the first place. Cleveland ranked 22nd defensively last season , the lowest rank (on either end of the floor) for any LeBron James team in his 14 full seasons in the league and the lowest *defensive rank for any team that made The Finals in the last 40 years. * One team in the last 40 years ranked lower than 22nd offensively and made The Finals: The 1998-99 New York Knicks, who ranked 26th in offensive efficiency (and third defensively) in a lockout-shortened season. Of course, it\u2019s early. The Cavs are just 11 games into an 82-game schedule. Still, the earlier you start building good defensive habits, the better. Where they ranked defensively didn\u2019t matter to last year\u2019s Cavs through the first three rounds of the playoffs, but some of their worst habits were on display as they allowed the Warriors to score 118 points per 100 possessions in The Finals. Only one below-average defensive team \u2013 the 19th-ranked 2000-01 Lakers \u2013 has won The Finals in the last 40 years. Unless things change dramatically, this will be the third time the Cavs have been a below-average defensive team in the four seasons since James returned to Cleveland. The exception was 2015-16, when they ranked 10th defensively \u2026 and won the franchise\u2019s only championship. Just 11 games into the season, a team\u2019s improvement or drop-off could be partially a result of the schedule they\u2019ve played. The Cavs have played four games against the league\u2019s top 10 offenses , one more than the average team has. But that hasn\u2019t been the problem, as they\u2019ve had the league\u2019s worst defense against teams that don\u2019t rank in the top 10 offensively, allowing 110.6 points per 100 possessions in those seven games (while no other team has allowed more than 107.5 against the bottom 20). This early, a team\u2019s improvement or drop-off could also be a result of luck, and that\u2019s where there is some good news. The Cavs\u2019 defensive drop-off has come almost entirely as a result of their opponents\u2019 shooting. They\u2019ve actually improved in regard to defensive rebounding percentage and forcing turnovers (though they still rank in the bottom five in opponent turnover percentage ). They\u2019ve held relatively steady in regard to opponent free throw rate. The big difference has been opponent effective field-goal percentage . Shooting \u2013 how well you shoot and how well you defend your opponents\u2019 shots \u2013 is the most important thing in basketball. But on defense, you don\u2019t control shooting as much as you do on offense. Cavs opponents haven\u2019t shot much better in the paint or from mid-range than they did last season. The difference has been from beyond the arc, and given the value of the shots, a drop in 3-point defense is more damaging than a drop in interior defense. Corner threes have been a particular problem. Cavs\u2019 opponents have shot an incredible 43-for-80 (54 percent) from the corners. And the two corners have been equally damaging, as their opponents have shot 22-for-41 from the left corner and 21-for-39 from the right . The good news is that those percentages will come down, no matter what the Cavs do. Opponent 3-point percentage in a small sample size is noisy data. But it must be noted that the two teams that currently lead the league in opponent 3-point percentage are the same two teams \u2013 Golden State and Boston \u2013 that have ranked in the top five each of the last four seasons. How their opponents shoot from beyond the arc isn\u2019t totally out of the Cavs\u2019 control, as some of those looks from the corners have been too easy. On this possession from Tuesday, Giannis Antetokounmpo gets the ball on the block after a pick-and-roll, and all five Cleveland defenders are ball-watching, with three open shooters on the perimeter. Antetokounmpo finds Tony Snell for an open, in-rhythm shot in the right corner before James, who was in no-man\u2019s land (not helping, not staying at home on his man) can recover. TWO MORE CAVS NOTES  1. The Cavs have taken 35.1 percent of their shots from 3-point range, down from 39.9 percent last season. Four seasons ago , 35.1 percent would have been the highest rate in the league. Two seasons ago , the Cavs ranked third at 35.2 percent. This season, with the league continuing to shot more from beyond the arc, 35.1 percent ranks 12th and the drop from 39.9 percent ranks as the league\u2019s biggest reduction from last season, with 20 of the 30 teams seeing an increase in the percentage of their shots that have come from 3-point range. Only once in their last 283 games (including playoffs) have the Cavs attempted fewer threes than they did in Tuesday\u2019s win over Milwaukee , when they were 9-for-18 from beyond the arc. Even with that 50-percent performance, the Cavs have also had the third biggest drop in 3-point percentage (from 38.4 percent to 34.4 percent) from last season. Combine that with the drop in attempts and the Cavs are scoring almost nine fewer points per game from beyond the arc. Another drop of note: 24 percent of their threes have come from the corners, down from 31 percent last season, when they set an NBA record with 353 corner threes. LeBron James leads the league on assists on corner threes, but has assisted on 1.4 per game, down from 2.2 last season. The drop in corner rate contributes to the drop in 3-point percentage, because the Cavs (like most teams) shoot corner threes better than above-the-break threes. You can pin the change on some of the Cavs\u2019 new personnel. Over the past three seasons, Jeff Green, Derrick Rose and Dwyane Wade have shot a combined 29 percent on threes, which have accounted for just 17 percent of their field goal attempts. None of them fit the Cavs\u2019 formula for offensive success over the last three years, which was to surround James with as much shooting as possible. In each of the last two seasons, the Cavs had eight players who have shot 35 percent or better on at least 750 career 3-point attempts. This season, they only have *five. * They gained Jose Calderon, but lost Kyrie Irving, James Jones, Richard Jefferson and Deron Williams. Through 11 games, the Cavs have shot better and more often from 3-point range with none of the Green-Rose-Wade trio on the floor than they have with one. And they\u2019ve shot better and more often from 3-point range with only one of those three guys on the floor than they have with two or three. Even with the drops in 3-point attempts and percentage, the Cavs still rank as the league\u2019s No. 2 offense. They\u2019ve scored 2.0 fewer points per 100 possessions than they did last season, but that\u2019s a smaller drop than the league average (2.1). They\u2019ve made up for the drop in threes (and an increase in turnover percentage ) with more shots and better shooting in the restricted area. They\u2019re still below the league average in regard to the percentage of their shots that have come from the restricted area, but have seen a small increase from 30 to 31 percent. With James leading the way and with Kevin Love much improved (55 percent last season , 74 percent this season), the Cavs have shot a league-best 71.6 percent in the restricted area . A decrease in perimeter shooting should have an adverse effect on the ability of James to get into the paint and finish, but that hasn\u2019t been the case. He has taken 49 percent of his shots , the highest rate of his career, from the restricted area. In his 15th season, he\u2019s registering career-high marks in both effective field goal percentage and true shooting percentage. It\u2019s a different Cavs offense, and it will evolve as the season goes along. After a slow start, J.R. Smith has shot 8-for-13 from 3-point range over the last three games, Cleveland\u2019s best offensive stretch of the season so far. But it will be interesting to see how Isaiah Thomas affects the shot chart when he returns from his hip injury and if any of the Green-Rose-Wade trio are on the floor when Cleveland needs to score late in a big game. 2. The Cavs have been outscored by 12.2 points per 100 possessions in the first quarter. . So far this season, you\u2019ve been able to determine early on whether or not the Cavs are engaged. Often, they haven\u2019t been. They\u2019ve lost five first quarters by nine or more points, and only three times have they had a lead at the end of the first. The Cavs have been much better in the second quarter ( plus-6.7 per 100 possessions ), with equal improvement on both offense and defense. But while they\u2019ve made some pseudo comebacks, the only team against which they\u2019ve been able to climb out of hole and win a game is the 2-7 Chicago Bulls. When the Cavs have been tied or ahead at the end of the first quarter, they\u2019re 4-0. When they\u2019ve trailed at the end of the first quarter, they\u2019re 1-6 .

The league also fined Westbrook, Paul George and coach Billy Donovan $15,000 apiece for their criticisms of the officials after the call against Anthony on Sunday. Both were unusual plays in that flagrant fouls are usually called against defensive players. Instead, Anthony and Westbrook were whistled for contact they created while attempting shots. Anthony drove to the basket and elbowed center Jusuf Nurkic in the face on a shot that went in during the Thunder\u2019s loss in Portland on Sunday. The basket was overturned after review and Anthony was hit with the automatic ejection. Crew chief Rodney Mott said after the game that referees ruled the contact was excessive and not a natural basketball move and the league agreed. \u201cWe reviewed it, the same as we review all plays of this nature, and agree with the on-court officials that the foul met the criteria of hard contact above the shoulders with high potential for injury,\u201d NBA spokesman Tim Frank said. \u201cWhile attempting to draw a foul, Anthony extended his elbow into his opponent\u2019s face, which is dangerous and reckless in nature.\u201d Westbrook was attempting a jump shot Tuesday against Sacramento when he and defender Bogdan Bogdanovic collided. Westbrook was issued a flagrant 1 foul, but that was downgraded. \u201cAfter review, we determined that the contact was part of Russell\u2019s downward shooting motion and the defender was moving forward into his shooting space,\u201d Frank said. A flagrant 1 is considered unnecessary contact. The flagrant 2 is deemed unnecessary and excessive \u2013 and a foul doesn\u2019t have to be considered intentional to be determined dangerous. The league reviews all flagrants and can upgrade, rescind or leave them as called on the floor.

But when you\u2019re rehabbing, when you\u2019re doing the same stuff over and over to build muscle, to build confidence, it sucks.\u201d Now, George was asked, imagine having to do it all again. Another lost year, the grind again, and all the uncertainty of what\u2019s next. \u201cThat would really suck.\u201d Jabari Parker knows all about it. He is living it, a Groundhog Day of a surgically repaired left anterior cruciate ligament. In the movie, Bill Murray at least mixed things up while stuck in the same place, messing with people, dialing up his risks, forcing some adventures. For Parker, about the only things that have changed are fresh scars that run parallel to his earlier set and the venue where he tackles his daily slogs. The first time, after blowing out his left knee in Phoenix in December 2015 , the Bucks made their practice home at a small college south of the city, close to Lake Michigan and equipped at a fairly basic level. Now, as the 6-foot-8 forward from Duke and product of Chicago\u2019s Simeon High grinds through the final months of that second ACL tear , he does so at a relative Taj Mahal of sweat and exertion. The Bucks\u2019 new practice facility is state of the art, offering nearly every apparatus and all the technology an athlete could need to ideally stay healthy but yes, to recover and rehab as well. But it\u2019s like cooking a familiar meal in a new high-tech kitchen \u2014 there are no shortcuts to the prep work, no hurrying through the baking time. ACLs need TLC, and a maddening level of monotony. \u201cThe only thing that\u2019s changed is really the environment,\u201d Parker said on Oct. 31. His teammates were in various stages of readying themselves to face the Thunder \u2014 glancing at the video breakdowns on the dressing room\u2019s big screen, taping and stretching and strapping while Parker tugged on the street sweats he\u2019d wear home. \u201cWork is work. It\u2019s the same equipment, actually,\u201d Parker said. \u201cIt\u2019s just better when you have a lot of bodies in the gym.\u201d Mostly Parker is around Suki Hobson, the team\u2019s strength and conditioning coach, and other members of the team\u2019s training and medical staffs. He brings a certain layman\u2019s expertise, too; remember, he spent 10 of the 26 months between his two knee blowouts doing virtually the same daily regimen. \u201cI don\u2019t find this very different,\u201d Parker said. \u201cJust things that I learned have been fundamental for me going forward. The only difference is that I know what I\u2019m going through. From there, second time\u2019s a charm.\u201d Parker, 22, has been healthy on his March 15 birthday just once in three NBA seasons and already has lost more games to injury than LeBron James has in 15 seasons . He occasionally will drop an aphorism into a conversation like a verbal crunch on which to lean: \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t kill me, it\u2019s just going to make me stronger.\u201d Or \u201cBad things happen for a good reason.\u201d But his true ability to cope comes from his devout Mormon faith, instilled by his mother Lola and exemplified by volunteer work Parker has done, the charities he supports and the social issues on which he\u2019s spoken. Only once since the second injury, he said, did he fall prey to the \u201cWhy me?\u201d question. That came and went fast, in the moments after he made a move to the basket against Miami Feb. 8 at the BMO Harris Bradley Center , felt the pop and the pain and knew what was wrong by the time he crumpled to the court. Otherwise, there\u2019s a calm about Parker, laced with optimism and even the serenity of flipping the keys to, and stress of, this to something greater. \u201cI\u2019m just a spiritual person, you know?\u201d he said, loud locker-room music pulsing beneath his words. \u201cI never forget what drives the vessel, what drives the ship. So if my spirit is good, anything is pretty much attainable. My dream is to come out of this, so I\u2019m just directing it accordingly.\u201d By the morning of Feb. 9 \u2014 if not sooner \u2014 Parker said he had steeled himself to the long rehab road ahead. \u201cI flipped a switch and said, \u2018Hey, you\u2019ve just got to get up. And work,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cMope? That\u2019s not going to do nothing for you, that\u2019s not going to do much for me. Just got to keep grinding. And never give up.\u201d At the time of the interview, Parker was said to be participating in about 70 percent of the Bucks\u2019 practice activities. He still was about three weeks from being cleared for real contact and 5-on-5, full-court scrimmaging, pushing that stage closer to Thanksgiving. He refuses to put a date on his return, lest he skip or rush through some steps, so Milwaukee is sticking to a vague February-ish timeline. After which, as Parker sees it, there still will be time to for 2017-18 to be productive. \u201cThis season is successful for me, personally, if I\u2019m able to play again,\u201d he said. \u201cGet better. Being efficient. Playing in the playoffs \u2014 I\u2019ve never done that, so that would be good to experience. And just make it through, take it day by day and game by game and see where it goes. \u201cThe basketball part comes naturally. There\u2019s only so much you can see from looking out, \u2018cuz I don\u2019t have, like, videos and they don\u2019t show me out there, right? It\u2019s just believing. That\u2019s the easy part. It\u2019s just trying to re-establish myself with the team again.\u201d Listening between the lines, there seems to be some strain or distance between Parker and the Bucks. Some of that\u2019s natural, given the questions that will linger over his ability to return a second time. Also, they couldn\u2019t negotiate the multimillion-dollar contract extension for which he and others in his 2014 first-round draft class were eligible this autumn. Parker grows terse, too, when asked if his coaches have given him any added duties to draw him close, the way Boston Celtics coach Brad Stevens has thrown video work at Gordon Hayward to keep him engaged through his ankle rehab. \u201cNext question,\u201d Parker said. Finding a valid comparison or role model for what Parker is trying to accomplish is difficult. Single ACL injuries are challenging enough in a sport built on jumping, running and applying extreme torque to lower extremities. One player who can relate, to a point, is Parker\u2019s fellow Simeon alum, Derrick Rose, who swears there was nothing in the drinking fountains of that school that led to their repeated injuries. \u201cYou have to be around the team. You have to do everything like you were playing,\u201d said Rose, the 2011 MVP who subsequently lost the equivalent of three seasons to knee, leg and other injuries. \u201cTravel with team, that type of stuff whenever you get the chance. You can\u2019t just stay home rehabbing, \u2018cuz you\u2019ll drive yourself crazy.  \u201cHaving faith and knowing that you can only control what you can control [helps]. Like, injuries happen. You can\u2019t sit there and moan or feel bad because of them, or you\u2019ll kill yourself on the inside. It\u2019s all about just getting over it the best way possible. Everybody\u2019s different. And having that family around so you have somebody to vent to, to talk to.\u201d Parker has leaned on his mother especially during this second rehab. And he visualizes not merely coming back but coming back better, which is what he did the last time. Averaging 20.1 points, 6.2. rebounds and 2.8 assists per game, Parker was stirring some All-Star reserve talk before he went down. He appeared to be in the best shape of his life, and he had stretched his shooting range to legitimate 3-point territory, making 36.5 percent on 178 attempts . In 101 previous NBA games, he had taken only 51 from deep. \u201cHe came back and he was killin\u2019,\u201d said Minnesota\u2019s Andrew Wiggins, who was drafted No. 1 to Parker\u2019s No. 2 three years ago. \u201cHe did real good. Some people say, when you get hurt, when you tear something, your leg is strong. He looked bouncy. He\u2019ll come back stronger. He\u2019s a hard worker.\u201d Said George, who contacted Parker after the February setback: \u201cHe was playing better than before. He was more athletic, more explosive. It was crazy. I think what sucks the most is, he\u2019s on the verge, he\u2019s right there in being a star in this league. He\u2019s in a great situation with a great organization. So, like, everybody\u2019s ready, everybody\u2019s waiting, for him to go over that hurdle. But he keeps getting bit by the injury bug.\u201d Instead, it\u2019s Parker having to wait for the Brinks truck \u2014 a five-year, $148 million extension \u2014 that backed up to Wiggins\u2019 account last month . George, Bucks coach Jason Kidd and Parker\u2019s teammate, Giannis Antetokounmpo (and the rest of the league), are waiting along with him. Parker sounds uniquely equipped to handle the unknowns in play, drawing on his first injury and return, relying on his faith and perhaps running Plan B through his head should the outcome this time be different. \u201cPeople look at this as a negative. They don\u2019t really look at it as a blessing,\u201d Parker said. \u201cBut what you do, you create your own story. Like, a lot of people walk around like they haven\u2019t been touched. And then when they face adversity, they don\u2019t know how to deal with it because it\u2019s the first time in their life. \u201cThere\u2019s basically nothing in my life that can make me quit, that can make me go under. It\u2019s the same with Derrick. Me and him just have a mental toughness where we\u2019ve dealt with everything before. So we just move forward. \u2026 We\u2019re able to show people that, if you dream big, those dreams can still stay alive if you stay positive. You can stay above water. \u201cReal people who have real issues will look at us. That\u2019s what makes me more humble.\u201d Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Through the first 158 games this season, teams were averaging 10.4 makes on 28.9 attempts \u2014 and that attempts number represents a 57 percent increase over what teams hoisted just six seasons ago (18.4). To me \u2014 and I suppose I\u2019m in the minority \u2013 this represents the death of the mid-range game, a significant loss in terms of creativity and individual expression on the court. Finger rolls, tear-drops, turnarounds, fadeaways, floaters, bank shots, sky hooks \u2014 those were part of the varied history of the NBA offensive game, offering a direct lineage to some of the league\u2019s greatest players. They gave kids signature moves to imitate in their driveways or at the playgrounds. Now we\u2019re working with a limited palette of layups, dunks and 3-pointers, and if young players are imitating anything, it\u2019s Steph Curry firing from 30 feet. Except there\u2019s precious little personality in anyone\u2019s 3-point attempt \u2014 if you\u2019ve seen one, you\u2019ve pretty much seen them all. This mournful rant already is too long, so I\u2019ll wrap by saying I look forward to the day the NBA moves the arc farther out, equalizes the risk\/reward factor and invites some old-school \u201ctwo\u2019s\u201d back into the game. Shaun Powell :  Andre Drummond shooting \u2026 get this \u2026 75 percent from the line? Bricklayers everywhere are rejoicing and now believers after seeing this career 38-percenter suddenly rolling like Rick Barry. I nominate his 14-for-16 effort against the Bucks as the day the earth stopped moving. Or maybe it was the backboard. John Schuhmann : The Lakers, who ranked last in defensive efficiency each of the last two seasons (and in the bottom three each of the last four) currently rank seventh defensively . I expected coach Luke Walton, coming from Golden State, to make an immediate impact on the Lakers\u2019 defense last season. It didn\u2019t happen right away, but L.A. appears to have figured things out in Year 2 under Walton, showing big improvement in opponent effective field goal percentage, defensive rebounding percentage, and opponent free throw rate. It\u2019s early and the Lakers have played seven of their 10 games at home, but it\u2019s hard to say that their defensive improvement ( they\u2019ve allowed 9.4 fewer points per 100 possessions than they did last season \u2014 only Boston has seen a bigger drop) is schedule-based. Five of their 10 games were against teams that currently rank in the top 10 in offensive efficiency and the three games that were against bottom-10 offensive teams (Phoenix, Utah and Brooklyn) were all the second game of a back-to-back for the Lakers.  Sekou Smith : It\u2019s hard to go bonkers over an early season statistical trend nine or 10 games into a season, but shout out to my main man John Schuhmann for finally completing his full analytics world takeover. Aaron Gordon ranking in the top five in the league among 3-point field goal percentage is a sign that good things do indeed come to those who wait. I know it\u2019s early and the nearly 60 percent clip he\u2019s shooting from deep right now won\u2019t last. But for Gordon to show this kind of improvement on his outside stroke is a testament to his dedication to his craft, the one things NBA players rarely get credit for when they are in the often arduous process of transforming themselves from prospects to true players. Gordon\u2019s diligence should be applauded. His work on his game, and his confidence that is apparent in his his attempts and willingness to take and make big shots from long range, is impressive. * * *"},{"id":43277,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-team-ready-rise-western-conference-jazz-pelicans-thunder-nuggets","date":"2017-11-08","title":"Blogtable: Which Western Conference team playing near .500 is poised to get hot soon?","content":" * * * The Lakers, Thunder, Nuggets, Jazz, Pelicans and Clippers are all hovering around .500. Which squad is best poised to heat up out West?  * * * Steve Aschburner : The Thunder has to be my answer, right, if I picked them to be the conference\u2019s third-best team by season\u2019s end? Their cockeyed performance at Sacramento Wednesday night, blowing an early 25-8 lead over the Kings, doesn\u2019t instill great confidence, but the talent is there in the \u201cOK3\u201d guys, Andre Roberson is a lockdown defender and Steven Adams is a terrific and entertaining two-way presence in the middle. Russell Westbrook has to get back to more of his \u201cdon\u2019t do they, do you\u201d ways (he\u2019s working hard to assimilate his new star teammates) and Paul George can\u2019t settle for becoming the Chris Bosh or Kevin Love of the trio, hoisting from the arc without more rim aggression. Shaun Powell :  My strong vote is for Oklahoma City, which still hasn\u2019t figured it out yet, much like the Miami Heat at first with LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh. Russell Westbrook is taking almost seven fewer shots a game to accommodate Melo and Paul George and sometimes this stew just needs to cook a little longer. The Lakers, Jazz and Pelicans have flaws (youth and chemistry mainly) that will prevent them from rising much higher, I\u2019m not sold on Blake Griffin bailing out the Clippers in many close games yet and Denver\u2019s got point guard issues that could last the season. John Schuhmann : The Thunder is the obvious answer. Not only do they have the most top-line talent, but they also have the league\u2019s biggest discrepancy between their record (4-6) and their point differential (that of a team that\u2019s 7-3). They should figure things out on offense ( where they currently rank 22nd ) and will also have better luck in late-game situations. After Tuesday\u2019s loss in Sacramento, OKC is 0-5 in games that were within five points in the last five minutes .  Sekou Smith :  The Pelicans have everything they need now to get it going. DeMarcus Cousins and Anthony Davis are doing what they do best and the supporting cast finally appears to be poised to supplement their efforts. The ceiling in Oklahoma City is higher. But the Pelicans have urgency on their side, or at least they should have that valuable component on their side. They need for their dip back into the \u201cTwin Tower\u201d era to work and now. Coach Alvin Gentry has to realize as much and surely has made that clear to his team. \u201cBoogie\u201d is having a monster season that can only be validated with a postseason trip. Same goes for Davis. Once they get a healthy Rajon Rondo added to the mix, it could be the addition needed to push this group to that next level. * * * * * *"},{"id":43276,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-milwaukee-bucks-status-after-trading-eric-bledsoe","date":"2017-11-08","title":"Blogtable: Will Eric Bledsoe trade help Milwaukee Bucks climb Eastern Conference ranks?","content":" * * * Eric Bledsoe is headed to the Bucks . Will this move help Milwaukee climb the Eastern Conference hierarchy and, if so, how?  * * * Steve Aschburner : Acquiring Bledsoe moves the Bucks into contention for one of the East\u2019s top four seeds, in my opinion. He\u2019s a potent, athletic scorer, a Top 50 talent in the league, and he\u2019s got something to prove after his clumsy (but ultimately effective) departure from Phoenix. Giannis Antetokounmpo and Khris Middleton need some help in Milwaukee\u2019s offense, more than just optimism about Jabari Parker\u2019s return. The backcourt depth presumably will make up for giving up helpful reserve Greg Monroe, and there will still be considerable minutes for last year\u2019s ROY Malcolm Brogdon. Shaun Powell :  Amazingly, this Bledsoe trade helps Giannis Antetokounmpo become a better player. Without the burden of having to run the offense \u2014 that\u2019ll be split by Bledsoe and Malcom Brogdon now \u2014 he can be turned loose to finish more plays and develop his catch-and-shoot skills, which is really the only area that can be classified as a mild weakness. Both Brogdon and Bledsoe can play off the ball and therefore Jason Kidd has multiple lineups and weapons to throw at the other bench. I\u2019m not ready to put Milwaukee in The NBA Finals yet, but if the Cavs don\u2019t get their act together (I suspect they will), the Bucks with Bledsoe (and a healthy Jabari Parker) will rattle the cage next spring. John Schuhmann : He probably can\u2019t hurt a team that\u2019s lost four straight and has slid to 29th in defensive efficiency . Bledsoe will give the Bucks some much-needed punch off the dribble, but more important is the other end of the floor, and the Bucks already have some good defenders in the backcourt. Regardless of personnel, Jason Kidd has to decide if he\u2019s going to stick with his aggressive defensive scheme that, despite the Bucks\u2019 collective length, more and more opponents are able to take advantage of for high rates of layups and corner threes. Better defense would result in more transition opportunities for Bledsoe and Giannis Antetokounmpo.  Sekou Smith : I think it will, in time, help the Bucks continue to climb the ladder in the Eastern Conference playoff chase. But if I\u2019ve learned anything during the early portion of this season, it\u2019s not to expect to see some immediate bump in the Bucks\u2019 fortunes. I\u2019m going to give this move some time. I\u2019m going to give Bledsoe some time to adjust to his new surroundings and I\u2019m certainly going to extend the same courtesy to his new teammates, who will have to rework their operation to account for a dynamic point guard like Bledsoe. Coach Jason Kidd\u2019s tutelage here will be crucial. After telling Giannis Antetokounmpo that the ball will be in his hands and it\u2019s his show, now you have to show him why having Bledsoe makes sense for his game as well as the greater good. But from a nuts and bolts standpoint, adding a 20-point, six-assist point guard with elite athleticism has to be a good thing \u2026 right? * * * * * *"},{"id":43279,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/jimmy-butler-working-get-andrew-wiggins-reach-full-potential","date":"2017-11-08","title":"Minnesota Timberwolves out to fuel Andrew Wiggins' rise to stardom","content":" * Tonight on ESPN:  Wolves at Warriors (10:30 ET) MINNEAPOLIS \u2014 It\u2019s not Andrew Wiggins\u2019 fault that he had the disadvantage of being drafted 29 spots higher than Jimmy Butler. Butler\u2019s story is the stuff of current NBA lore. Born and for a spell raised in the small Texas town of Tomball. Thrown out of the house at 13 by his single mother and sleeping on neighbors\u2019 and friends\u2019 sofas. Neglected by college recruiters, spinning a season at Tyler (Tex.) Community College into Buzz Williams\u2019 first scholarship at Marquette. Drafted with the last pick of the first round in 2011 , thrown scraps at the end of the Chicago Bulls\u2019 bench \u2026 Until he works and wills himself into a starter, the Kia Most Improved Player in 2015 , a five-year, $95 million contract , three All-Star appearances, one of the league\u2019s most complete two-way players and now the leader of a young and hungry Minnesota Timberwolves team. Wiggins is one of the cornerstone talents of that team, and his backstory hardly could be more different from Butler\u2019s. The son of elite athletes \u2014 his father, Mitchell Wiggins, played six seasons in the NBA and his mother, Marita Payne, was a Canadian Olympic sprinter \u2013 the Wolves\u2019 forward inherited a rare bundle of skills and capabilities. He was touted not just by his hometown but by an entire country, dubbed \u201cMaple Jordan\u201d as Canada\u2019s latest, greatest hoops hope. Butler spent a year in junior college just to earn a scholarship. Wiggins spent a year at NCAA powerhouse Kansas, eschewing his final three seasons to enter the NBA as the No. 1 overall pick in 2014 . He was coveted enough, without having played a minute in the league, to be traded for an All-Star when LeBron James made his surprise return to Cleveland that summer and tabbed Kevin Love to be part of a new Big Three with himself and Kyrie Irving. Thus, Wiggins joined a forlorn Minnesota organization 10 years into what has become a 13-year playoff drought. He cruised to the NBA\u2019s Kia Rookie of the Year award on a team that won just 16 games that season . The Wolves upped that to 29 and 31 victories the next two seasons, Wiggins boosting his scoring average to 20.7 points per game and 23.6 ppg while often failing to bust a gut or break a sweat. That, at least, was the reputation he developed, borne from his own admission in high school that he picked and chose the opponents and matchups against which he locked in. If only Wiggins played hard on both ends of the floor, they said. If only his motor revved high every night. If only he relied less on his talents and more on tenacity. If, if, if. Butler wants to change Wiggins\u2019 ifs to whens. And the way Butler is wired, when means now. \u201cMy job is to show him what it takes to win at both ends of the floor and how hard you have to play,\u201d Butler said over the weekend, four victories into what has grown to the five-game winning streak as Wolves face the defending-champion Golden State Warriors tonight. \u201cThe kid is so talented. Everything comes so easy for him. When he gets the mindset that, \u2018no matter how talented I am, I have to bring it on every single possession,\u2019 that\u2019s when you\u2019ve got to start talking how great can this kid be. That\u2019s what I want him to understand \u2013 you\u2019re one of the most talented players in the league. Don\u2019t take any possessions off.\u201d Butler is a plow horse who always lets you see him sweat, who got where he is today by dint of hard work. Wiggins is a thoroughbred to whom things seemingly have come easy, no straining necessary beyond the drills, workouts and games asked of any player. Neither characterization captures Butler or Wiggins in full, but both are close enough that the Wolves \u2014 and much of the NBA \u2014 are watching to see what how much of Butler rubs off on the younger man. \u201cI think I bring it every night,\u201d Wiggins said casually, not at all defensively, about the criticism he hears most frequently. \u201cThis year, we\u2019ve got a good team. So, if someone else is going, someone else is going. But I always bring my game.\u201d Actually, everything Wiggins has experienced or accrued so far has come from his potential. He was drafted for it, traded for it and most recently paid for it \u2014 a five-year, $148 million \u201cmax\u201d contract extension that starts in 2018. Team owner Glen Taylor took some grief for wanting to meet with Wiggins face-to-face before signing the deal, to make sure the budding star keeps growing his game. Now Taylor will notice Wiggins looking his way after hitting a tough shot or making a defensive stop, and smiling. Their contract is secure. Wiggins\u2019 on-court demeanor flows from his personality, a mostly quiet nature that can make him seem aloof. Close friends and teammates can draw him out when they catch him laughing, but that side rarely shows at Target Center or under the lights of the league\u2019s 28 other venues. \u201cWigs is just laid back off the court,\u201d said scorer Jamal Crawford, another veteran player and influence newly added by Minnesota coach and basketball boss Tom Thibodeau. \u201cHe\u2019s not one who craves attention. He just comes, does his job, goes home. He\u2019s really, really quiet in that regard. But he brings it \u2014 he has no problem making the big play or taking the big shot. He\u2019s not scared to fail, and that\u2019s a sign of an up-and-coming great player.\u201d Said Wiggins: \u201cThere are a lot of personalities on the court. Some people look like they\u2019re working hard but they\u2019re not. Some people who are working hard don\u2019t look like it.\u201d Butler trusts what he can see. As Minnesota\u2019s undisputed leader and updated version of Kevin Garnett as the Wolves\u2019 24\/7 jumper cables, he doesn\u2019t believe a player can modulate his performance against Golden State one night, Dallas the next, without getting bit. \u201cCan\u2019t have it,\u201d Butler said, the home dressing room otherwise empty after Saturday\u2019s victory over the Mavericks. \u201cEverybody in this league is an NBA player. That\u2019s where he has to grow. He\u2019s a terrific kid, human being, basketball player. But you\u2019ve got to have that killer instinct in this league. You\u2019ve got to have it, man. \u201cIt\u2019s not certain matchups, it\u2019s not against certain teams, it\u2019s not taking things personal. You take it to every team, every matchup. Where you match up to kill and to help this team at all costs.\u201d The more success the Wolves have, the more they crave. At 7-3, they\u2019re off to their best start through 10 games since 2001-02. Should they beat the Warriors, they would have the franchise\u2019s first six-game winning streak since late in the 2003-04 season \u2013 which also happens to be the last time Minnesota reached the playoffs. Wiggins, at 22, has shown signs of making every game an occasion to which he rises. During the winning streak, he has scored 20 points or more three times. Already, he ranks third on the Wolves\u2019 all-time list for scoring 20 or more with 143 such games, behind only Love (167) and Garnett (534). His game-winning, glass-assisted 3-pointer as time expired at OKC last month, sprung by Karl-Anthony Towns\u2019 dubious midcourt pick, might have been a fluke. But the work he put in against the Thunder five nights later was not; Wiggins startled his teammates and coaches by diving twice to the floor for loose balls, grunt work for a diva. Thibodeau and his staff preach and document \u201cfirst to the floor!\u201d but Wiggins only recently has become that guy. \u201cYou see Wigs diving on the floor, you\u2019re like, \u2018Oh man!\u2019 \u201d Crawford said. \u201cEverybody kicked it to another gear and it changed the complexion of that game.\u201d Against the Mavericks Saturday , Wiggins scored 23 points but worked diligently at guarding both Harrison Barnes (17 points) and Wesley Matthews (five) in a defensive tandem with Butler. Twenty-four hours later in blowing out Charlotte, he finished with 20 points on 8-of-12 shooting and nailed three consecutive jump shots in the third quarter. But he drew praise for hustling back on defense to thwart a 2-on-1 Hornets break, the Wolves already leading by 20. In Thibodeau\u2019s and Butler\u2019s world, Wiggins soon will match the former Bulls\u2019 defensive intensity, finally making good on the predictions when he was drafted in 2014 that he\u2019d be an instant defensive force. It has taken awhile, partly due to the culture of a losing operation, partly from what seemed intentional energy rationing by Wiggins. \u201cWhen he learns to use the angles and his athletic ability and his God-given length of his arms and his big hands,\u201d Butler said, \u201che\u2019s gonna be a helluva defender. Offense, he\u2019s got it all. Now we\u2019ve got to get him to think, \u2018I\u2019m gonna be as aggressive on defense as I am on offense.\u2019 That\u2019s when you\u2019re talkin.\u2019 \u201d Said Thibodeau: \u201cI see a progression. He\u2019s learned a lot from all his experiences. He worked incredibly hard all summer. He spent a lot of time here, in and out, and stayed focused on basketball. I think he\u2019s made a conscious effort to do more than just score. He\u2019s rebounding, he\u2019s playmaking, his defense has improved. And with the game on the line, he can make the play.\u201d Reflecting both Wiggins\u2019 development and Minnesota\u2019s makeover, the 6-foot-8 wing has a positive net rating for the first time in his career at 109.6\/108.3. He is averaging 19.9 points, 4.6 rebounds and 1.4 assists , though he sometimes still needs to have his switch flipped. \u201cHe still hasn\u2019t even scratched the surface,\u201d forward Taj Gibson said. \u201cHe can turn it on when he wants to turn it on. The [Oct. 30] game in Miami, I remember Jimmy telling him to just dunk the ball. And the very next play, he dunked it. And the play after that, he almost got poster-of-the-year for how high he jumped. He missed it on his own, that\u2019s how crazy it was.\u201d Wiggins is said to spend much of his free time playing video games or hanging with his dog Cassie . He doesn\u2019t pull back much of the curtain in interviews, perhaps as a way of tamping down requests. He\u2019s cordial, business-like and maddening to the Wolves media types who sift through his responses in search of sizzle. He defends the intensity of his defense since arriving in Minnesota, but without bristling. Questions about his tendency to fill the points column on score sheets, while sticking small numbers in the other columns, get deflected easily. Wiggins concurs when it\u2019s pointed out that Thibodeau is the first coach he\u2019s had for consecutive seasons since back in high school, but he offers only a shrug of a comment about it. \u201cMy first year here, I kind of established in my mind where I would fit on the court,\u201d Wiggins said. \u201cThe best areas for me on the court and recognizing how to get in those positions. Now I\u2019m just here.\u201d \u201cSometimes Andrew is misjudged,\u201d Thibodeau said. \u201cHe\u2019s a quiet sort of guy, but he\u2019s a very confident guy. It\u2019s easy to look at Jimmy and say \u2018He\u2019s this, this and this.\u2019 But you tend to forget where Jimmy was his first and second years, his third year, his fourth year. I think you can look at a lot of players in the league \u2013 a guy like Kawhi [Leonard], same thing. Every year they got a lot better but there were steps they had to take. And if you look at Andrew, every year he\u2019s made a big step. And he\u2019s still just 22 years old.\u201d Wiggins has been compared to some of the NBA\u2019s brightest lights, at least as far as his potential. Tracy McGrady is frequently mentioned. One Wolves team member, a little embarrassed, suggested Julius Erving. Crawford has been grasping for the perfect answer. \u201cWho does he play like? I\u2019ve been trying to figure it out, but I haven\u2019t thought of one yet,\u201d Crawford said. \u201cBut he\u2019s definitely one of those guys \u2013 I would go back to an early 2000\u2019s, late \u201890s type of guy. I\u2019m not sayin\u2019 McGrady but those type of guys, where the game comes really easy to \u2018em. I\u2019m thinking of a wing who can really create and make plays, and the game was so easy for him, and he did things so effortlessly.\u201d Doing difficult things effortlessly and making it appear so are two different things. That\u2019s why the education of Andrew Wiggins continues, with Butler committed to barking until his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 turns in reliably strong performances as a muzzle. \u201cYou tell him over and over and over again,\u201d Butler said, \u201cuntil he gets tired of hearing it coming out of your damn mouth and he buys into it and he does it. That\u2019s what I\u2019m doing. We\u2019re always smiling and joking around on the floor, because we love playing with one another. But at the end of the day, I think it\u2019s my job to make sure everybody shows up, every single night. \u201cYou hope he see where it takes this team, and how his level of play is going to [raise] everybody\u2019s level of play, and how it\u2019s contagious. That\u2019s the next step we have to have.\u201d Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980. You can e-mail him  here , find  his archive here  and  follow him on Twitter .

But it also registered with Shawn Vanzant and Matt Howard, Shelvin Mack and Ronald Nored. Because, you see, Stevens actually lost Hayward twice, most recently to a gruesome ankle fracture. The first time was when Hayward left Stevens and Butler for the NBA after his sophomore year. Both times, the coach connected with a shortchanged lineup and forged a belief in his players that the goal and philosophy remained unchanged. The Butler Bulldogs regrouped without Hayward and returned to the NCAA championship game, a feat that, on the shock meter, supplanted the previous year when the mid-major Cinderella school nearly sucker-punched Duke at the buzzer. The Celtics, at least here in the early season, are on track to duplicate that. It says plenty about Stevens and his unflappable nature and attention to detail. Perhaps he is the right coach, then, in this situation with the Celtics, given his experience with such things. Actually, you can go a step further: When Stevens took Butler to the title game the first time, he became a wanted man in college basketball; all the big schools with a coaching vacancy (and some without one) made their pitch. But when he returned to the title game without Hayward the next year, this time his wanted poster circulated around the NBA. That repeat run effectively was the swinging mallet that shattered the notion in NBA circles that college coaches couldn\u2019t make the jump, a belief that held a measure of legitimacy, given those who tried and failed badly. At least in this particular case, Celtics boss Danny Ainge followed his instincts and especially his eyes. How could a coach motivate a team, without its star, back to the title game the very next year? What else was there to see? Stevens is coaching the Celtics right now because of the way Stevens coached Butler in 2010-11. That was enough to dismiss major concerns about his age (he was 36 when hired by Boston two years later) and his unfamiliarity with the NBA culture and his nearly zero experience in coaching NBA-level players and their egos. That season without Hayward is arguably on the Mount Rushmore of college coaching performances. That season, he had Mack, who became a career NBA backup point guard; Howard, a career overseas player; and a bunch of future 9-to-5ers. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s who lined up against mighty Connecticut while a disbelieving basketball nation looked on.  \u201cIt was a goal, to get back to the championship game, and everybody thought we were crazy to think like that because we lost Gordon,\u201d said Shawn Vanzant, a senior guard on that team. \u201cWell, we knew we could.\u201d Butler had seasoned returnees from the 2009-2010 team but no All-American candidates, nothing like that. If anything, it was a surprise the Bulldogs still had Stevens, who was understandably the hot coaching prospect in the country that summer. But by turning down all offers he showed a level of loyalty rarely seen among mid-major coaches who haven\u2019t yet cashed a big paycheck. That next season Butler hit a speedbump, though, bottoming out during a frigid winter stretch where they lost four out of five, including three in a row to the likes of Wright State and UW-Milwaukee. A conference loss at Youngstown on Feb. 3 put their chances of making the NCAA tournament in question and lowered their record to 14-9. How could they return as giant slayers when they were struggling in the Horizon League? \u201cWhen that happened, it wasn\u2019t one of those rah-rah kind of things with him,\u201d said Micah Shrewsberry, a former Butler assistant who\u2019s now on Stevens\u2019 staff with the Celtics. \u201cThat\u2019s what Brad is really good at, staying level headed. \u201cThe message was to move on to the next game, just refocus as a group. He said we\u2019re playing too tense, not playing relaxed. We had pressure because of what happened to us the year before and he took that pressure off of us. We needed to live more day by day, minute by minute, possession by possession and he refocused us back to that. He told the players that it was all about each possession, that\u2019s all you need to worry about.\u201d Well, Butler didn\u2019t lose again until the title game to UConn two months later. \u201cI guess,\u201d said center Emerson Kampen, \u201cwe got the message that things had to change and they had to change quickly.\u201d Unlike this year\u2019s Celtics, who have Irving as a certified NBA lead singer, Butler lost its leading scorer and designated bail-out player with Hayward and there was nobody with those credentials in the lineup to take his place. That\u2019s with all due respect to Mack and Howard, both fine players. Stevens had his team thinking what it could do collectively to compensate and the players brought into the idea. \u201cHe got everybody understanding his value to the team, his role and that if we concentrated our abilities together we can still do it, we can still get done what we need to get done,\u201d said Kampen, now a Butler assistant coach. \u201cHe\u2019s an unbelievable communicator. I was a walk-on, and you feel your role is super important whether that\u2019s the best player or somebody who doesn\u2019t get into the game.\u201d Butler won three of its first four tournament games by a combined six points, breaking brackets everywhere and making folks believe in Stevens, in case some were still skeptical about the coach. \u201cHe never panicked and so we never panicked either,\u201d said Vanzant. \u201cNo matter if it was a big school and we were underdogs, he gave us confidence. It was, \u2018Go out and do what we\u2019ve been doing all year and it\u2019s going to be fun.\u2019 A lot of our players didn\u2019t care who we played and where we played the game.\u201d The in-game adjustments that have impressed Irving (who called Stevens \u201can intellectual\u201d) were polished during the second tournament run when Butler needed the right play at the right time. Matthew Graves was the associate head coach that year and said Stevens was masterful with the dry erase board. \u201cHe does such a great job of preparation,\u201d said Graves, now the head coach at South Alabama. \u201cOnce we got into the tourney we were prepared and also got some breaks along the way and before you know it we\u2019re in the championship game. He\u2019s so good at picking out the exact points where you need to exploit defensively or what you can do offensively to help put your team in the best frame of mind. He allows the players to play free and think clearly and that showed in the pressure moments.\u201d When Stevens lost Hayward the second time, and once everyone\u2019s jaws and hearts were picked up off the floor after that horrific injury, once again he didn\u2019t panic. He told Tatum, the Celtics\u2019 highly regarded rookie, to become an opportunist and maximize the extra minutes. He wanted more defensive doggedness from Brown, who agreed with the coach. And the blueprint from the preseason was hastily rewritten. \u201cWe had to tweak a little what we\u2019ve had to do offensively,\u201d said Stevens. \u201cDefensively we tried to stay with what we what we started from day one. We just wanted everyone to do what you do best.\u201d Did everyone need to do more without Hayward? \u201cWhen somebody goes out, the thought is they have to do more,\u201d said Stevens. \u201cActually, they just have to do their job better.\u201d The Celtics have done that and take a nine-game winning streak into the Garden on Wednesday against the Lakers. Shrewsberry said the players have bought into those ideas, saying: \u201cGordon is still a big part of it obviously but we can still do the things we want to do. Brad\u2019s influence is calming and I think that settled the guys down.\u201d Brown said: \u201cThere was two ways to go. We could sulk until the season\u2019s over, or we could step up and play some basketball.\u201d Stevens is keeping Hayward in the loop by inviting him into strategy meetings and going over assignments, and says this is part of the rehab process. It\u2019s an idea he got from Orlando coach Frank Vogel, who dealt with Paul George\u2019s broken leg two years ago with the Pacers. Vogel and Stevens became friends when both coached in Indianapolis, so Stevens reached out. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just about what Paul could help Gordon with, (given) what he was going through with the injury, but also how we could best brainstorm to keep him as engaged as possible,\u201d said Stevens. \u201cEngagement is really important. There is a physical aspect to recovery but there\u2019s also an emotional aspect to recovery and being a part of a team. You don\u2019t want to come back and not been engaged with everyone.\u201d Until the All-Star forward fully recovers, Stevens wants to keep the bond tight between Hayward, himself and the Celtics, and this is another well-timed strategy by the coach. This happens when you\u2019ve lost your basketball soulmate twice. You tend to get a bit protective.

It was, after all, Bledsoe\u2019s social media mic-drop \u2014 the \u201cI Don\u2019t wanna be here\u201d tweet as the Suns got off to their 0-3 start \u2014 that ultimately set this trade in motion. Phoenix almost immediately distanced itself from the 6-foot-1 guard \u2014 GM Ryan McDonough didn\u2019t buy Bledsoe\u2019s claim that he meant not the Suns but a hair salon he allegedly patronized \u2014 and went 4-4 without him until agreeing to the deal with the Bucks, reported by multiple outlets Tuesday morning. The winner of this deal? Bledsoe, obviously. He was in limbo and about to begin lonely, less-than-optimal solo workouts at the Suns\u2019 practice facility while awaiting a ticket out of Phoenix. He got that, at a cost of fewer than 140 characters and a $10,000 fine from the NBA, and will be joining a team with legitimate ambitions to contend in the Eastern Conference. The Bucks are runner-up winners because Bledsoe, 28, is an athletic point guard who brings scoring and playmaking skills. He can lessen some of the workload for All-Star forward Giannis Antetokounmpo and shooter Khris Middleton, while relieving some pressure at the point position on Malcolm Brogdon, the reigning Kia Rookie of the Year. Bledsoe, expected to meet the Bucks Wednesday in San Antonio, can slide nicely into a lineup and rotation without much disruption, with Brogdon and Matthew Dellavedova still around for significant minutes and Jabari Parker working his way back from another knee surgery (he\u2019s slated to return in February). Bledsoe is under contract for this season and next for a total of $29.5 million. In his three appearances for the Suns last month, Bledsoe averaged 15.7 points, 2.3 rebounds and three assists, while shooting 40 percent. But in 66 games last season, those numbers were 21.1 ppg, 4.8 rpg and 6.3 apg in 33.0 minutes. Milwaukee \u2014 which gave up big man Greg Monroe and protected first- and second-round picks, according to reports \u2014 becomes Bledsoe\u2019s third NBA team after he spent three seasons with the LA Clippers and the past four with the Suns. Many hailed the deal as a deft move for the Bucks: Phoenix, for its part, rids itself of a disgruntled player to complete a sudden, early-season makeover that included coach Earl Watson\u2019s firing and assistant Jay Triano moving up as interim coach. The picks, whether they convey in 2018, 2019 or beyond, will further the Suns\u2019 long-term development with added youth. And Monroe, despite limited use this season, has per-36 minute averages of 15.5 points and 11.4 rebounds. For Monroe, the deal is an unfortunate end to his time in Milwaukee. When he signed with the Bucks in the summer of 2015 , Monroe was considered the most notable free agent to choose that small-revenue franchise. After an inconsistent initial season in his relocation from Detroit, \u201cMoose\u201d became a reliable reserve at both ends and finished sixth in balloting for 2017 Kia Sixth Man of the Year. But he also served as an indicator of just how rapidly the league has changed, too, when he picked up his $17.8 million option for this season rather than take his chances in the open market. A below-the-rim banger, Monroe can score in his matchups against opponents\u2019 Clydesdale reserves, but does not thrive in today\u2019s breezier, 3-point-focused style of play. Given Antetokounmpo\u2019s romps to the rim, the last thing the Bucks want is someone clogging up the lane. Bledsoe and the newfound depth of the Bucks\u2019 backcourt and wing positions should help Milwaukee play at the current fashionable pace, while creating the necessary amount of space.

The talented guard is getting a fresh start with the Milwaukee Bucks, who have another proven scorer to take some pressure off All-Star Giannis Antetokounmpo. Bledsoe, who wanted out of Phoenix, was traded to the Bucks on Tuesday in exchange for big man Greg Monroe and two 2018 draft picks. The 27-year-old Bledsoe had not been with the Suns since Oct. 22, when he posted \u201cI Don\u2019t wanna be here\u201d on Twitter, the same day the Suns fired coach Earl Watson. He had been averaging 15.7 points per game, second behind Devin Booker, and was the team\u2019s on-court leader. He was sent home by the Suns after the tweet, reducing the team\u2019s leverage because everyone in the league knew Phoenix was trying to trade him. Bledsoe had asked to be traded before the season, Suns general manager Ryan McDonough has said. The NBA fined the eight-year NBA veteran $10,000 for the tweet. Adding Bledsoe will take some of the focus off Antetokounmpo, the Bucks\u2019 primary ball-handler. Milwaukee had lost four of its last five games before visiting the Cavaliers, but adding Bledsoe\u2019s scoring ability alongside Antetokounmpo and Khris Middleton on a team that also includes rising guard Malcolm Brogdon could help. \u201cWe\u2019re excited. Eric\u2019s excited,\u201d Bucks coach Jason Kidd said in Cleveland. Bledsoe will take his physical on Wednesday and is expected to join the Bucks in San Antonio in time for Thursday\u2019s game against the Spurs. Middleton can\u2019t wait to see what Bledsoe brings. \u201cHe\u2019ll be another great player for us, a guy who can create for others and create for himself on offense,\u201d Middleton said. \u201cI\u2019m excited to play with him. We can do a lot of things. We\u2019ll have more ball-handlers on the court at the same time. He\u2019s going to be a great for us.\u201d Already a dangerous and up-and-coming team, the Bucks could go to another level with Bledsoe. \u201cHe adds a veteran point guard, a guy who plays with pace and can get into the paint, can make the right play,\u201d Cavs coach Tyronn Lue said. \u201cHe\u2019s been on the cusp of being an All-Star the last three years. He brings a different dimension to their team. He can shoot the basketball, get in the paint, run pick-and-roll and he\u2019s a good defender also. \u201cIt\u2019s a good pickup for them.\u201d Bledsoe averaged more than 20 points and six assists per game in each of the last two seasons with the Suns, including career highs in points (21.1) and assists (6.3) last season. Bledsoe spent the past five seasons in Phoenix after his first three years with the Clippers. The 27-year-old Monroe, who joined the team as a free agent in 2015 after five years in Detroit, has been sidelined recently because of a left calf strain. Over three seasons with the Bucks, he averaged 13.3 points, 7.6 rebounds and 2.2 assists over 165 games. Without him, Milwaukee will likely consolidate the center position and look ahead to early next year, when the front line should get a boost with the return of injured forward Jabari Parker. The 6-foot-11 Monroe has an expiring contract, which means even more room for a Suns team with loads of cap space. They also could have as many as three first-round picks next season. \u201cMoose did everything we asked him to help us win, from being a starter to being asked to go to the bench and help us have a stronger bench,\u201d Kidd said. \u201cI wish him the best because he did everything we asked.\u201d Milwaukee\u2019s first-round pick will belong to the Suns in 2018 if in the range of 11-16 overall; in 2019 if in the range of 4-16; in 2020 if in the range of 8-30; and in 2021 it will be unprotected. The Suns get Milwaukee\u2019s second-round pick next year if in the range of 48-60 overall. Phoenix, rebuilding with an extremely young roster featuring Booker and T.J. Warren, has not made the playoffs in six years.  \u2014  AP Sports Writers Bob Baum in Phoenix and Tom Withers in Cleveland contributed to this report."},{"id":48575,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/new-partnership-brings-virtual-reality-nba-tnt","date":"2017-11-07","title":"New partnership brings virtual reality to NBA on TNT","content":" Virtual reality is becoming actual reality for the NBA on TNT.

And just maybe like one who can rescue the reeling Cavaliers. Thomas has been increasing the intensity of his workouts and is making strong progress in his recovery from a serious hip injury that ended his 2016 season in Boston and delayed his debut with Cleveland. As Cavs coach Tyronn Lue and a member of Cleveland\u2019s medical staff kept an eye on him from an adjacent floor at Cleveland Clinic Courts, Thomas broke a healthy sweat during a workout Monday under the guidance of assistant coach Phil Handy, who fired him passes and praise. Thomas worked on his 3-pointer , man-to-man defense, conditioning, ball handling and free throws as he nears a return that may be coming sooner than imagined. Although the team has not disclosed any change from its original timetable estimate of the end of December, it\u2019s apparent that Thomas is getting closer. At 4-6, and lacking a second scorer to complement LeBron James, the Cavs might be tempted to rush Thomas along. But Lue said it\u2019s imperative for the team to stick with its plan so as not to harm the 28-year-old. \u201cWe have to make sure he\u2019s 100 percent,\u201d Lue said Monday as the Cavs regrouped following an embarrassing loss to the Atlanta Hawks. \u201cWe have to worry about him as a player and a person. If he\u2019s not right, not healthy, we don\u2019t want to rush him back to set him back even more.\u201d Thomas isn\u2019t keeping his status any kind of secret. In the first few weeks of his rehab, he kept a lower profile as he worked out in the team\u2019s facility away from reporters and cameras. Lately, he\u2019s been front and center, giving everyone a glimpse of the strides he\u2019s made in coming back from a torn labrum. Lue credited Cleveland\u2019s training staff with a slow, steady approach in bringing along Thomas, who came to the Cavs in the blockbuster trade last summer that sent Kyrie Irving to the Boston Celtics. Irving and the Celtics have won nine straight and lead the Eastern Conference. Meanwhile, Cleveland has remained patient, although it\u2019s clear that Thomas can\u2019t wait to get back onto the floor in meaningful games. \u201cI just wanna HOOP!!!!!\u201d he tweeted Sunday night. https:\/\/twitter.com\/Isaiah_Thomas\/status\/927386838620409856 The Cavs need him. Without Irving, the Eastern Conference champions lack a proven scorer to take some pressure off James. Thomas won\u2019t help Cleveland\u2019s suspect defense. In fact, it might be a little worse with him on the court, but its offense would go to another level with Thomas. He can drive. He can shoot. He can get to the line. \u201cWe still have a 30-point scorer, All-Star point guard that\u2019s coming soon,\u201d James said recently. \u201cSo that\u2019s exciting.\u201d Once he returns, Thomas is expected to move into the starting lineup, with Derrick Rose coming off the bench and running the Cavs\u2019 second unit. It\u2019s been dreadful starts by the Cavs\u2019 first five that have been at the heart of their early struggles. Thomas could fix that, but until he\u2019s ready, the Cavs have to come out with more energy and a greater sense of urgency. Thomas should also help Cleveland\u2019s woeful 3-point shooting. The Cavs enter Tuesday night\u2019s game against Milwaukee 25th in the league in 3-point accuracy (33 percent) and tied for 16th in 3-pointers made per game. Thomas made a Celtics record 245 3-pointers last season and knocked down at least one in 57 straight games. Against the Hawks, the Cavs started 3 of 25 from behind the arc and finished 10 of 36 \u2013 thanks mostly to Kyle Korver heating up during a fourth-quarter comeback. \u201cWe have guys that can shoot the ball,\u201d said Kevin Love, who was taken to the hospital Sunday after falling ill. \u201cI don\u2019t know what it says on pace, but last year we really pushed the ball with \u2018Bron and Ky and really opened up the floor. But we\u2019re just not shooting the ball well from 3, and that has to change.\u201d There need to be other changes, and Lue said it\u2019s time for his team to begin making them. \u201cJust have to keep attacking it,\u201d he said. \u201cHave to keep showing film and continue to keep talking about it. I think guys are embarrassed and we should be embarrassed of how we\u2019re getting beat. Teams that we\u2019re playing, having guys out, key guys out and still not being able to win. We all have to continue to keep searching and continue to keep fighting and continue to play hard.\u201d And at some point, they might get some help."},{"id":43311,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/hassan-whiteside-benched-second-half-loss-golden-state-warriors","date":"2017-11-07","title":"Hassan Whiteside benched in second half of loss to Golden State Warriors","content":" The 4-6 Miami Heat have struggled to gain traction early in the season, alternating losses and wins in their last four games .

Perhaps the best center in the East starts a West Coast road trip on the bench. Something called \u201cload management.\u201d Oh, Sixers fans think the excuse to sit Embiid is a load of something, for sure. Embiid hasn\u2019t been hurt in months and has dominated so far, averaging team highs with 20.5 points and 10.1 rebounds. His big numbers on the stat sheet finally draw more headlines than his social media posts. Embiid can just about do it all \u2013 except shed the \u201chandle with care\u201d sticker the Sixers seemed to have stamped on his uniform. Yes, Embiid has a medical chart as thick as a playbook, but the Sixers have decided to rest him Tuesday against the Utah Jazz as they monitor his number of games and minutes. Embiid has averaged 27.6 minutes and played in eight of nine games. He\u2019ll miss the one four days after the Sixers beat Indiana. \u201cI follow the instruction of our medical people, and there is completely a thought-out plan why this plan has been recommended,\u201d coach Brett Brown said Monday at the Sixers\u2019 practice facility in Camden, New Jersey. \u201cIf it requires more information, they will be the ones to explain why they decided to make this recommendation.\u201d Translation: Brown says the decision to rest Embiid is out of his hands. Embiid\u2019s matchup against 7-foot-1 Jazz center Rudy Gobert would have been one reason for Sixers fans to stay up late on Tuesday. Without Embiid, Philadelphia will be challenged to keep its four-game winning streak alive. The Sixers (5-4) open a nine-day, five-game road with their first winning record in November since 2012 and first time overall since Nov. 13, 2003. Richaun Holmes, Amir Johnson and maybe even Jahlil Okafor will get minutes against the Jazz. Embiid and rookie Ben Simmons have made the Sixers an early season surprise, and their record is a boost for a franchise that underwent one of the more painful NBA rebuilding efforts in decades. The Sixers also play games at Sacramento, Golden State and the Los Angeles Clippers and Lakers. All teams on the trip except for the Kings have at least a .500 record. Embiid is expected to play against the Kings. The Sixers have won four straight games for the first time since January. \u201cThat means we\u2019re growing and we\u2019re learning,\u201d Embiid said. J.J. Redick scored 31 points and hit eight 3s in Philly\u2019s win over Indiana on Friday and suddenly seemed worth every bit of the $23 million the Sixers will pay him this season. The Sixers tied a team record against the Pacers with 18 3s. They will need more of that on the road from Redick \u2014 and there\u2019s little reason to expect Simmons won\u2019t continue to play like a top candidate for rookie of the year. Simmons had 14 points, 11 rebounds and 11 assists against the Pacers for his second triple-double of the season. He joined Hall of Famer Oscar Robertson as the only rookies with multiple triple-doubles in the first nine career games. Simmons also has five double-doubles. Embiid and Simmons are each averaging at least 18 points and nine rebounds per game and are two of nine NBA players with such averages. The only other pair of teammates on the list is the New Orleans Pelicans\u2019 DeMarcus Cousins and Anthony Davis. \u201cWhen everyone\u2019s scoring, doing their thing, I think it\u2019s hard to stop us,\u201d Simmons said. They\u2019re much harder to stop with Embiid in the lineup.

When something like that happens, I expect you to let the guys know about it.\u2019 And he said, \u2018I\u2019m on it.\u2019 \u201d It was one minute of one day of one week of the Los Angeles Lakers\u2019 road back to re-joining the NBA elite. It is not a road almost never traveled quickly, or without detours, divots and disappointments. It will not happen this season in Los Angeles, if it happens at all. But as Kobe Bryant finally fades into the franchise\u2019s lore, the Lakers have legitimate hope for a breakthrough sooner rather than later. They have set themselves up for the summer of 2018, as all of NBA world knows by now, to be significant free-agent players. But the present is worth contemplating, too. There is a lot more than Lonzo Ball \u2014 or Lavar Ball, for that matter \u2014 going on at Staples Center. The next year isn\u2019t going to be spent tanking. Not when Kyle Kuzma does things that the Lakers had no idea he\u2019d be able to do as a rookie. Or when Ingram starts to make those KD comparisons look less like pipe dreams. Or when Ball greets his dad\u2019s latest proclamation with a shrug. Or when Julius Randle brings the ruckus off the bench. Vets like Brook Lopez and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope are on-court stabilizers who have provided the spine of a halfcourt offense and respectable defense, and Corey Brewer, who came to town last season as part of the Lou Williams trade , is heralded by many for quiet leadership. But If the kids don\u2019t show that they\u2019re worthy of the league\u2019s best coming to town in free agency, none of the pomp and circumstance that team president Magic Johnson or GM Rob Pelinka dream up over the next nine months is going to matter. \u201cThe thing we talk about is our mentality,\u201d Pelinka said last week. \u201cThe way that Magic and Kobe brought it every night, those guys guide us in terms of the mentality, the way we want to play in every game \u2014 compete hard and play the right way. That\u2019s probably the word that\u2019s guiding us right now.\u201d After barely hanging on to beat the Memphis Grizzlies at Staples Sunday night \u2014 the Lakers blew a 22-point third-quarter lead \u2014 L.A. is .500. In the big picture, no great shakes, to be sure. But for a team that\u2019s won 27, 21, 17 and 26 games the last four seasons , 5-5 is significant progress. \u201cSome of the players have gotten older,\u201d Walton said. \u201cI think KCP coming over, just a hard-nosed player. He\u2019s been in that Eastern Conference, hard worker. He kind of helps set that tone. Brook\u2019s been a solid vet in this league for a long time. I think as BI grows as a player, he\u2019s a competitor. You watched him in college and he was the same way. It\u2019s just a group of guys that are bonding together and trying to figure this out together.\u201d Ball has the steepest curve \u2014 rookie point guard, for a boss who redefined the franchise and won five rings and is generally considered one of the top two or three ever to play the position. And who was as outgoing and boisterous as Ball is withdrawn in public. It doesn\u2019t matter if Ball talks a lot to the media. John Stockton and Oscar Robertson didn\u2019t have a lot to say while they were players, and they turned out to be fairly decent floor generals. What matters is if the 20-year-old Ball can inspire grown men who are playing for money \u2014 can tell them what to do, where to go, when they\u2019ll shoot and a hundred other things that a point guard must do nightly. The point guard isn\u2019t always popular, but he has to have the respect of the locker room. He has to lead. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m still working on,\u201d Ball said last week. \u201cUCLA helped me a little bit, with Coach (Steve) Alford being there, he helped me a lot with it. But I\u2019m still working on that. Because playing with grown men, you can\u2019t always be quiet. You have to get into them sometimes, especially in the locker room.\u201d Amidst the insanity that is Ball\u2019s daily life \u2014 the Facebook show and the Big Baller Brand and, well, dad \u2014 his numbers so far ( 8.8 points, 6.6 rebounds and 6.7 assists per game ) are fine for a rookie. His shot needs work, to be sure. But Ball never is off message or off balance. He answers questions quickly, but politely, with a kind of bemused detachment. \u201cA lot of the credit goes to him, honestly,\u201d Walton said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if his upbringing has prepared him for it, the insanity that comes with everyone always watching and judging everything that comes with being a star. But he just has this ability where it seems that it doesn\u2019t really get to him. He\u2019s calm. He doesn\u2019t seem like stress and pressure really affect him that much. \u201cHe\u2019s been a great teammate; the guys on the team love. It\u2019s impressive at 19 \u2014 well, he\u2019s 20 now \u2014 that he\u2019s able to handle the limelight like he is. I mean, he\u2019s on SportsCenter every single night. No matter what\u2019s happening, he\u2019s on there. Obviously a lot of people have a lot of different opinions, but he was raised properly. He handles himself, he handles situations, he handles his teammates with dignity and class.\u201d Ball does get ticked off, just not on the court. There are people that push his buttons. \u201cMy little brother for sure,\u201d Ball said. \u201cThe youngest one. They take pride in it.\u201d But on the court, Ball continues to never reveal himself. \u201cI was just taught, the team goes how the point guard goes,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I\u2019m mad or showing my frustration, the whole team\u2019s gonna be like that, techs, and people are going to go down. So I just try to keep the even keel. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t get too high or too low. I\u2019ve been playing like that my whole life. It\u2019s just natural for me.\u201d But there\u2019s low-key, and there\u2019s asleep. Ball barely looked at the basket during Thursday\u2019s loss in Portland, shooting just twice in 28 minutes and going scoreless in a three-point loss . It\u2019s part of the maturation process of a rookie point guard, but Ball has to at least be a threat on the court or teams will continue playing his passing lanes. Much is made of Ball\u2019s release on his jumper, but really, the Lakers are more concerned about his footwork than his shooting form. \u201cIt\u2019s like he\u2019s shooting a different shot every time,\u201d one Angeleno says. (Dennis Scott, our Turner Sports colleague who knows a thing or two about jumpers, says that as long as Ball\u2019s hands get square at the release point, where Ball starts his shooting motion doesn\u2019t matter that much.) But Ball has been working with assistant coaches Miles Simon and Brian Shaw to further diversify his offensive bag, shooting runners and floaters after practices and before games. Getting that shot down will be a key next step in his development and the Lakers expect he\u2019ll ultimately make enough 3-pointers to be credible. Ingram has shown that kind of jump in his second season. He was uncertain and disappeared for large chunks in 2016-17, when he shot just 36 percent for the first three-quarters of the season and was a nightly blow-by candidate on defense. But he got going in his last 21 games, all starts, after the All-Star break, when he raised his scoring average from eight points per game to 13.2, and his field goal percentage to 47.5 percent . He\u2019s carried that end over to this season\u2019s beginning, but he\u2019s also stronger (about 10 pounds) and is able to finish through contact. His handle is much improved, and he\u2019s now using his length to get to the rim in one or two long strides \u2014 much like Durant when the light when on for him in Oklahoma City around 2010 or so. Ten games into this season, he\u2019s averaging 14.8 ppg , including a game-tying putback in the final seconds of regulation against Washington that led to an overtime win. And, along with Larry Nance, Jr. (now out six weeks after breaking a bone in his left hand against Portland) and Lopez, Ingram was voted by the players as one of the team\u2019s captains. \u201cI think (it was) a little bit being into myself last year, not realizing how good I was until the last two months of that season,\u201d Ingram said. \u201cNow I\u2019m just trying to get back and relax, relax a little bit and trying to use my skill level and my ability. When I play my hardest, I feel like I\u2019m one of the best on the floor.\u201d Yet the revelation so far has been Kuzma, who came in the D\u2019Angelo Russell trade on Draft night . At the time, the supposed \u201cprize\u201d the Lakers got in the deal was moving Timofey Mozgov\u2019s remaining three years and $47.8 million from their books. Doing so would give them an unencumbered shot at a max free agent next summer and an outside shot at two if they could move another contract by next summer. But Kuzma has been a revelation. He never took more than 2.9 threes per game in three seasons at Utah , but he\u2019s taking four a night for the Lakers. He puts the ball on the deck like a 10-year vet who expects every shot to go in. He runs the floor and finishes. He talks on defense. He\u2019s averaging 15.4 ppg and shooting 56 percent from the floor \u2014 only Ben Simmons and Lauri Markkanen are scoring more per game among rookies . In his first start, for the injured Nance, Kuzma dropped 21 and 13 on the Nets , reminding them of the player they had for a few minutes. The Lakers had him on their short list before the Draft, along with Michigan\u2019s D.J. Wilson and Syracuse\u2019s Tyler Lydon. They thought each could be good in time, maybe a rotation player in a year or two. No one had this. Kuzma was a first-team all Pac 12 selection and a very good defensive player for Utah, but Oregon\u2019s Jordan Bell got the conference\u2019s Defensive Player of the Year award, and all the attention when the Ducks made the Final Four. Hitting on someone like Kuzma accelerates the calculus of a rebuilding team. You expect to get a star \u2014 a superstar \u2014 with the second pick. You do not expect that with the 27th pick, even if it\u2019s traded to you. That gets people\u2019s attention \u2014 people who may currently be on other teams. That can make a .500 team look better than a .500 team. That, you can sell. \u201cWe\u2019ve done kind of a good job keeping those (losing) thoughts at bay,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cWe realize the situation. But at the same time, we have a lot of young guys. We also have a lot of talented, and high BBIQ guys \u2014 very high basketball intelligence. That helps make the transition very easy.\u201d * * * MORE MORNING TIP:  DA\u2019s Top 15 Rankings | What\u2019s next for Okafor, Philly? | Your questions on Detroit\u2019s start, Cavs\u2019 woes | Q&A: C.J.

The East and West are about even (the West holds a 28-27 edge) in interconference games through Sunday\u2019s action. Last Monday (Oct. 30) was the first time since Jan. of 2010 that the East had six or more wins (it was 6-1) against the West on a single day. It\u2019s still very early and the Warriors have played just three games against the East thus far . The East has been able to get seven of its 30 games against the Spurs before Kawhi Leonard has played a minute, with two more coming this week. But the East also has a couple of teams that are surpassing expectations. The Detroit Pistons (4-1), Indiana Pacers (3-2) and Orlando Magic (3-0) are a combined 10-3 against the West , and seven of those 10 wins have been against West teams that have winning records. Detroit, with a 4-2 record against all teams that are currently above .500, seems particularly legit. Andre Drummond\u2019s eye-opening improvement from the free throw line has been a part of the league\u2019s third biggest improvement in offensive efficiency, through Detroit has played more games against top-10 offenses (five) than against top-10 defenses (one) thus far.

The third-year forward is clearly not a part of the Sixers\u2019 plans going forward. He\u2019s been in dry dock all season, having played in just one of Philly\u2019s first nine games . Sixers coach Brett Brown has made it clear that Okafor isn\u2019t going to be in the rotation \u2014 he\u2019s not only behind star center Joel Embiid on the depth chart, he also trails Richaun Holmes as well. And now that the Sixers have declined their fourth-year option on Okafor , making him an unrestricted free agent at season\u2019s end, the recriminations have begun in earnest. Yet a 30,000-foot view shows a 21-year-old whose career is still well in front of him, who\u2019ll get his chance soon enough to show for someone else the skills that made him a first-team all-America selection after his single college season at Duke, when he led the Blue Devils to the NCAA national championship. For now, though, an uncomfortable relationship with the team that took him third overall in the 2015 Draft remains. Okafor made it clear last week that he wants to be elsewhere \u2014 anywhere . But that won\u2019t be an easy lift. The Sixers are not going to let him go for nothing.  League sources indicate the Chicago Bulls and Atlanta Hawks are the most likely destinations for Okafor. But the Sixers are still holding out for at least a Draft pick, and could still opt to keep Okafor either as insurance against further injury to Embiid, or as a potential expiring contract to aggregate as the trade deadline nears. There\u2019s so much to unpack in the relationship between Okafor and the 76ers, who took him after Karl-Anthony Towns went to the Minnesota Timberwolves and the Los Angeles Lakers took D\u2019Angelo Russell second. You can start with that Draft night itself. The Sixers\u2019 instinct that night was not to go for Okafor, but to take a then-teenaged Latvian player who\u2019d played very well in the Spanish ACB League the previous two years. But the teenager, Kristaps Porzingis, refused to even meet with the Sixers , who were still in the throes of their rebuild (\u201cThe Process\u201d) and coming off of an 18-64 season. Porzingis\u2019 agent, Andy Miller, also had issues with the team and its then-GM Sam Hinkie. (The team\u2019s current GM, Bryan Colangelo, who\u2019s gotten a lot of the heat locally for how the 76ers have handled the Okafor situation of late, only said last week that the team would not fine Okafor for his comments about wanting out.) The 76ers could still have taken Porzingis. You don\u2019t have to have face-to-face meetings with a potential Draft pick to take someone. But teams are understandably reluctant to make a potential multi-million dollar investment into someone without having all available information in hand, from personal quirks and dislikes to up-to-date medical reports. So the Sixers passed on \u201cThe Unicorn\u201d and took Okafor (Porzingis went to New York with the next pick instead ). The problem for Philly was that it already had invested in its big man of the future, having taken Embiid third in the 2014 Draft . In addition, the Sixers\u2019 first rebuilding move was trading for the rights to center Nerlens Noel in 2013 from the New Orleans Pelicans . And they\u2019d also maneuvered to deal for the rights to power forward Dario Saric ( who was originally drafted by the Orlando Magic in 2014 ), who came over to the NBA last season. That gave Philly three young frontcourt players in which it had specific future plans on its roster before taking Okafor. There wasn\u2019t anywhere for him to play when he got to Philly. But Okafor has to own some of the dysfunction, too. He was not in shape his rookie season. In separate incidents his rookie season, he was involved in an assault outside a Boston nightclub , and was cited for speeding at 108 miles per hour across the Ben Franklin Bridge by local police. He did not exactly scream \u201cfundamental building block of the future\u201d with his off-court behavior. And yet, with Embiid still rehabbing from foot surgeries and out for the season, Okafor still averaged 17.5 points and 7 rebounds as a rookie , showing he was worthy offensively of a steady diet of post-ups. Defense was another matter entirely , but let\u2019s get real: individual defense, or the lack thereof, is no longer much of a consideration in today\u2019s NBA. Okafor may be bad defensively, but \u2026 compared to whom? The league has made it clear what it values with its all-offense all the time rules changes of the last generation. Golden State is a terrific defensive team, to be sure. But the Warriors became the Warriors because of, first, the \u201cSplash Brothers\u2019\u201d incredible shooting prowess. That tilted the board completely. Draymond Green is a great two-way player and Andre Iguodala made selflessness a hallmark in the Bay. But it all started with Stephen Curry and KlayThompson making shots at an historic rate . Add to that Kevin Durant in his mold-busting prime, and you have an unstoppable offensive force. Teams aren\u2019t trying to emulate the Warriors\u2019 defensive principles \u2014 they\u2019re trying to match their firepower. Anyway, back to Okafor. His days in Philly were numbered when Embiid finally got on the court last season. Any four who plays alongside \u201cThe Process\u201d best have some inside-outside to his game, and Okafor has shot exactly six 3-pointers in his first two-plus NBA seasons \u2014 and none since that rookie season. Because of that, understandably, Brown gave Saric a ton of minutes toward the end of last season, when Saric make a strong run at Kia Rookie of the Year. Okafor, on the other hand, didn\u2019t play in the Sixers\u2019 last 11 games of 2016-17 . The Sixers were close to a deal last February that would have sent Okafor to Portland . But sources indicated, then and now, that the Blazers changed their plans and went in instead on a deal with Denver that brought them Jusuf Nurkic in exchange for Mason Plumlee. Deals fall through all the time, but this looked especially bad because the 76ers told Okafor to stay home and not go on a road trip with them since they believed a deal was imminent. This year, the idea was to showcase Okafor during the preseason , and Brown did give him some burn off the bench \u2014 but not a ton. So, where can Philly send him? The Sixers are reluctant to just cut Okafor loose, knowing it will take Celtics boss Danny Ainge about 30 seconds to scarf him up and put him into the injured player exception Boston has for Gordon Hayward. (The two teams haven\u2019t been able to come together on a trade.) Okafor\u2019s knee is sound and he\u2019s in the best shape of his young career. Some have trotted out the usual suspects: Phoenix and New York and other rebuilding teams. But those teams have their own problems and their own young frontcourt players (Marquese Chriss and Dragan Bender for the Suns; Porzingis and Enes Kanter with the Knicks) who\u2019ll need all the minutes they can get to further develop. That is also, it says here, selling Okafor short \u2014 that all he can be is a stats hunter on a bad team. But the Sixers also don\u2019t want to add any salary to get Okafor off the books. They have every intention of extending forward Robert Covington as soon as they are able \u2014 Nov. 15 \u2014 and aren\u2019t going past that in new expenditures this season. But teams are asking Philly to take back more salary in exchange for Okafor\u2019s now expiring $4.9 million contract. And, if it doesn\u2019t work with Chicago or Atlanta, there aren\u2019t a lot of obvious other places the Sixers could send him. A lot of solid and\/or promising teams like Charlotte, New Orleans (which had interest in the past in Okafor) and Detroit are over the cap and perilously close to the tax threshold, and no one is going to go over it to take a chance that Okafor might be better than he showed in Philly. And good teams already paying the tax this season are obviously not in the mix. Jahlil Okafor will get a shot, somewhere, to play again. But he may have to wait, yet again. * * * MORE MORNING TIP:  Young Lakers see bright future | DA\u2019s Top 15 Rankings | Your questions on Detroit\u2019s start, Cavs\u2019 woes | Q&A: C.J.

McCollum","content":" The door was stuck, and C.J. McCollum had to go. There was a game to be played in less than 90 minutes, and pro players have their routines. But the door in one of the rooms near the Portland Trail Blazers\u2019 locker room at Moda Center was stuck, and the handle wouldn\u2019t move, either in the room or outside it, and McCollum had to go. Yet while someone fetched a key, the fifth-year guard chatted amiably with the strangers that had just interviewed him. It was in keeping with his character \u2014 a talented but humble kid from Canton, Ohio, that rose from unheralded and barely recruited out of high school to play at Lehigh University \u2014 an outstanding school, noted for its engineering program, in the Patriot League. Yet few engineers or Patriot League grads make in the NBA. McCollum, a journalism major (not many of those playing in the L, either), has made it, though. Averaging 22.1 points per game and shooting a seemingly unreal 54.7 percent on 3-pointers this season, McCollum and Damian Lillard are the unquestioned leaders of the Blazers and one of the top backcourts in the game, each capable of taking over at a moment\u2019s notice. They seek to raise the Blazers past the first round, where Portland\u2019s season has ended two of the last four seasons. With center Jusuf Nurkic around for a full season after last February\u2019s trade-deadline deal with Denver, the Portland has hopes they can be a top four seed. In the midst of the $106 million extension he got in 2016, McCollum also stepped out in the shoe game this summer, joining Dwyane Wade and his Portland teammate Evan Turner as an endorser with Li Ning, the Chinese shoe company, with a five-year deal. He continued preparing to take my job with his annual interview of Adam Silver . And, finally, someone managed to open the door. Me: Tell me how the season\u2019s gone so far. C.J. McCollum: I think we\u2019ve been up and down, honestly. Not finishing games at the end. The only convincing loss we\u2019ve had is that game with the Raptors, where it wasn\u2019t really close from the second quarter. But we had the buzzer beater with Blake (Griffin), and Giannis (Antetokounmpo) being Giannis, and the last game against the Utah Jazz, being up, what was it, up six with three minutes left , possession up five with two minutes left. Those are games we have to be able to win, but it\u2019s a good learning experience for us. In order to win games, you have to figure out how to get through them after you lose them. Me: The ball\u2019s in the right guys\u2019 hands at the end? CJM: Yeah. We\u2019ve got to be better. You\u2019re looking at the turnovers one game, then I miss a free throw (against the LA Clippers). It\u2019s uncharacteristic, but it can happen. You open the door up to great players, it\u2019s a league of very capable guys. And if they see they have a chance to win it, you never know what\u2019s going to happen. A guy may hit a three or just make a great shot down the stretch. Me: I know of coaches who literally walked the streets after losses, it was so hard on them. Do you stew after tough ones or do you have to flush them in order to be ready for the next one? CJM: It hurts. It hurts, especially when you\u2019re in position. I\u2019m a career, 80, 85 percent (free throw) shooter. Shot 91 last year. You go to the line, and you\u2019re thinking, this is cash, the game\u2019s over. You miss that first one, and literally after I missed it I said, man, they\u2019ve got a chance to hit a three here. You make the second free throw, and you\u2019re looking, you know Blake, you know Austin (Rivers), you know they\u2019re thinking \u2018no overtime; let\u2019s get this over with and go home.\u2019 And the three goes up, and all you\u2019re thinking is, one possession. Maybe you missed a shot; maybe you missed a defensive assignment. One possession is the difference in that game. Me: You and Dame, you\u2019ve taken possession of the team. So when you hit a little rough patch, do the two of you lead verbally, or is it just, let\u2019s both play better to get ourselves out of this? CJM: It\u2019s everything. We know independently, separate besides everything we do as a team, it\u2019s on us. The ball\u2019s in our hands the last five minutes. It\u2019s our decision to hit the pocket pass, hit the roll\/replace guy. It\u2019s a guard\u2019s game. Pick and roll-wise, you think about it, we\u2019re in every coverage offensively and defensively down the stretch, unless you\u2019re going against a team that\u2019s more post oriented. But for us, we\u2019ve just got to get better. We\u2019ve discussed how the season\u2019s going \u2026 it could be a lot worse. It could be a lot better. But it\u2019s good that this is happening now, get this out of the way. So when you get into November, December, and as the New Year comes around, you have all these learning experiences. And you have more play calls that you know can work down the stretch, and you\u2019re able to go to those. Me: You guys both recruited Carmelo hard in the summer . Did you ever think you had a real shot at any point? CJM: I mean, I figured why not? Why not recruit someone you think can help your team? I just told him the truth. I spend my summers in New York anyway \u2014 I\u2019m there with my girl, anyway \u2014 so seeing him work out in the same gym and having the same trainer, I didn\u2019t harp on it. I told him one time how he could help our team, and that was basically the end of it. I felt like when someone\u2019s a free agent and you know them and you\u2019re around them, you need to share how you think they can help you and how you think you can help them. They have the right to make their own decision, and I think he\u2019s happy where he\u2019s at, and I wish him the best except when they play us. ( Editor\u2019s Note: Anthony wasn\u2019t a free agent last summer, but he had approval power over any potential trades ) Me: So, they wound up keeping the team pretty intact from last year. Now, you can look at that two ways: they have confidence that our core group will continue to improve, or that we didn\u2019t do very much while other teams did, and we\u2019re further behind. Where do you fall? CJM: I think that we\u2019re getting better, collectively. You look at how we\u2019re performing \u2026 Our Defensive Rating is higher , and offensively, although we\u2019re not shooting the ball particularly well, we\u2019re still in the top 10 in offense. We\u2019re doing things the right way. We just have to close games out. Like I said before, the line between wins and losses is thin. It\u2019s one possession here, one possession there. We\u2019ve got to do a better job, especially at home. We\u2019ve played particularly well on the road, but those first halves, we\u2019ve had some slow starts. We\u2019ve got to get off to better start in these games. Me: It seems like a lot of teams are choppy. And I know it\u2019s that way usually at the beginning of the year. But do you think the fact that the preseason was shortened, and vets didn\u2019t get to go up and down the floor even for just a few minutes over five or six games like they used to has impacted that at all? CJM: I try not to make excuses. I feel like we know what the dates are ahead of time. You know when you need to be ready mentally and physically, and it\u2019s your job to do that \u2014 although I didn\u2019t play the first game (McCollum was suspended for the regular season opener after taking a couple of verrry small steps off the bench during a preseason game in October ). I was ready for the games after that, and I think the rest of the league (was) as well. You can look at it on the flip side and say that defenses should be worse. Guys shouldn\u2019t be in good shape defensively, and we should score more points. Because that means guys had less time to get together, a lot of new guys moving around different franchises and different teams. So we just have to do better collectively, and that\u2019s not just my team, all teams in general. I think you\u2019ll see the basketball and the level of play continue to rise as guys get more comfortable. Me: I wanted to ask you about your shoe deal with Li Ning, and how you researched that before you decided. What was important to you? CJM: A lot of things were important. I think the biggest thing is going somewhere where you\u2019re wanted and needed. I always say that mutual admiration. It\u2019s kind of how I chose Lehigh, and Lehigh chose me. It was a situation where we both felt like we could help each other, help one another, them being a big brand in a place like Asia, having that big influence and being able to help them branch out to the United States \u2014 more specifically, Portland, Oregon, and Canton, Ohio, and Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. Obviously those cities will become more familiar with the brand. Overall, I\u2019m thankful for the opportunity. As a kid growing up in Canton, Ohio, you never see yourself in a position to play in the NBA, much less have somebody pay you to wear shoes. It\u2019s a blessing in itself. I\u2019m just looking forward to the opportunity to represent a brand, and hopefully reach out and gain more information on them, and them gain more information on players in the United States, and little kids. Guys like DWade and ET (Evan Turner), guys who\u2019ve been in the brand before me, have been very helpful telling me about the brand, and informing me on ways to improve. Telling me about what China\u2019s going to be like, having gone there in the past. I\u2019m looking forward to it.  Me: I assume you talked with Errick about it as well? CJM: Yeah, I talked to my brother. He was in the CBA (Chinese Basketball Association) a few years ago, and with him being in the EuroLeague now with Efes (Pilson), I\u2019ve been very familiar with the CBA. Not only Li Ning, but Anta and the other brands as well. The research was in place, and I felt like the comfort was all that matters, being comfortable. I had my orthotics in place. I had shoes that were comfortable and to my liking. I always say, it\u2019s not the shoes; it\u2019s the player. If you can hoop, you can hoop. Me: That\u2019s true \u2014 but your feet are your career. CJM: They are. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important that you have the orthotics in place. I had another foot scan and I went through the process of having the molds in place, to where you need your feet, you need your orthotics. But having removable orthotics helps a lot, because you can take them out of different shoes. You just have to make sure they fit. Me: How big will it be having a full year of \u201cThe Beast\u201d (Nurkic) with you? CJM: We\u2019re looking forward to it. We\u2019ve gone through a full training camp now. He\u2019s more familiar with our play calling; more familiar with our culture and our chemistry. And the city in general. He\u2019s comfortable here. We\u2019re looking forward to doing something special \u2026 we\u2019ve got 74, 75 games left plus playoffs. We\u2019ll have to continue to either build on what we did at the end of last season, go forward, and when April comes around we\u2019ll be that much better. Me: Speaking of April: you\u2019ve been in the playoffs each of your first four seasons here, but you\u2019ve only gotten out of the first round once. How do you get over that hump? CJM: I think these close games we\u2019re losing right now, those are games we have to win to put ourselves in better position in the playoffs, be a better seed than the eighth seed. You don\u2019t want to be fighting in April, fighting for a spot. You want to have your spot solidified, so now you\u2019re working on rotations, everything\u2019s in place and you\u2019re trying to get healthy for the playoffs. That\u2019ll be the next step for us. We haven\u2019t been in that position in a few years where we\u2019re locked in early. You don\u2019t want to plan that last week out, and then be at the mercy of the schedule. So that\u2019s the goal. And then you go into the playoffs understanding that it\u2019s not going to be easy, that you have to win on the road and protect your home court. Me: So, what are you going to give me when AU beats Lehigh this year? CJM: I\u2019ll get you some Li Nings and a C.J. McCollum jersey. Me: Like that. And, in the unlikely, wholly unexpected event that Lehigh cheats and somehow beats AU, what would I have to get you? CJMcC: I see you got some Common Projects on . Give me some, and maybe a pocket square with some details. Me: Deal. And it\u2019s on tape. CJMcC: It\u2019s on tape. \u2014 Former 76ers GM Sam Hinkie ( @samhinkie ), Thursday, 12:23 p.m., referring to the Houston Astros\u2019 verrrry similar strategy to his own celebrated\/notorious \u201cProcess\u201d \u2014 using analytics combined with terrestrial information to maximize the odds of success in as short a time frame as possible.

From Quintin Reed: Most teams are approaching the one-eighth pole of the regular season. Let\u2019s not make playoff plans just yet in Detroit. Having said that, the Pistons do look better so far this season. Andre Drummond\u2019s significant improvement so far from the foul line \u2014 75 percent so far this season after shooting 38.6 percent from there last season \u2014 could be a game-changer if he sustains anything close to it over 82 games. Coach Stan Van Gundy could not play Drummond down the stretch last season, such was his understandable fear of Hack-a-Drummond in the last few minutes of games. If that\u2019s no longer going to be an effective game-ending strategy for Pistons\u2019 opponents, Detroit\u2019s chances in close games should improve dramatically. I\u2019d think you\u2019d want the guy ranked first last season in Defensive Rating on the floor when it matters. If, though, Detroit regress to the mean in the next few weeks, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s any secret the Pistons wouldn\u2019t be averse to moving Reggie Jackson for the right offer ( peep Schuhmann\u2019s preseason work on Detroit\u2019s deficits last season with Drummond and Jackson on the floor together. Whether that was, in Jackson\u2019s case, a reported discussion of a deal ( and denied by Van Gundy ) last week for Eric Bledsoe in Phoenix, is up for debate. Detroit seemed fine offensively at least for large chunks of last season with Ish Smith (3.1 win shares in 2016-17) running the point, but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re going to give Jackson away. Playing at a fast Clip. From Terry Tanis: If LeBron plays anywhere near like he did Friday night in D.C., and Isaiah Thomas gets back into fighting trim, the Cavs are still the team to beat in the Eastern Conference. As for as the Clippers, it\u2019s fair to be skeptical about their long-term prospects, but I do think they\u2019ll make the playoffs this season \u2014 as long as Blake Griffin stays healthy. His abilities as a scorer and playmaker are such that he can lift them to a top eight spot. But his history with injuries gives me pause to think he can remain in one piece for a full season; he hasn\u2019t made 80 games since the 2013-14 campaign. If he\u2019s out there on the regular, and Milos Teodosic returns from his foot injury in due course, L.A. has enough. A fair, rational request that will almost certainly never be granted. From Nicholas Gloumakoff: I wish, Nicholas. But in three decades I\u2019ve never seen a team that went from awful to great in rapid fashion lower the price of anything in its building as a \u201cthank you\u201d to its loyal fans. It\u2019s almost always been the exact opposite: ratchet up the prices as much as possible while we have a great product (scarcity) that people will pay top dollar to see. (The price point is almost always spot on, by the way.) And while the league shares best practices among its teams, I doubt it could or would want to mandate individual markets to give back. It is, still, a business.

(Last week\u2019s averages in parenthesis) 1) James Harden (36.3 ppg, 3.5 rpg, 10 apg, .524 FG, .814 FT): Sixth game with 50 or more points since joining Rockets following career-high 56-point effort in Sunday\u2019s win over Utah. 2) LeBron James (38.9 ppg, 7.3 rpg, 10 apg, .644 FG, .950 FT): Fastest player ever to 29,000 career points after dropping a Heinz 57 on the Wiz Friday. 3) Giannis Antetokounmpo (23.7 ppg, 8.3 rpg, 3.7 apg, .474 FG, .933 FT): Teams doing better at building a wall in front of the Freak to make him into more of a jump shooter. He\u2019ll adjust. The great ones always do. 4) DeMarcus Cousins (23 ppg, 13.5 rpg, 6 apg, .408 FG, .893 FT): Made a \u201cbusiness decision\u201d on Friday not to contest Dennis Smith\u2019s dunkage in Dallas . 5) Kevin Durant (22.7 ppg, 7.3 rpg, 5.3 apg, .595 FG, 1.000 FT): Smack down the Clips again, chill after with DeAndre . BY THE NUMBERS 13 \u2014 Consecutive times the Blazers have beaten the Lakers, a streak dating back to March 3, 2014, after Portland defeated L.A. in Portland on Thursday on Damian Lillard\u2019s last-second, tie-breaking three-pointer. 283 \u2014 Consecutive games, per ESPN Stats and Info, that the Clippers have lost when trailing by 20 or more points entering the fourth quarter. Los Angeles erased a 25-point fourth quarter deficit at home Sunday against the Heat and took a one-point lead in the final minute before falling 114-111. 1,156 \u2014  Career coaching victories for Gregg Popovich , who passed Phil Jackson Sunday for sixth place on the all-time victories list. Popovich is now 19 wins behind fifth-place George Karl and 54 behind fourth-place Pat Riley. 1) It was a pleasure to work Portland-Lakers Thursday and see two teams that, throughout the game, actually played through their big men and let them shoot and score in the post. Jusuf Nurkic scored 28 points for the Blazers; Brook Lopez had 27 for L.A. They scored on pick and roll dives, fadeaways, hooks and the occasional drop step. The world did not start spinning in the opposite direction. Cows did not begin singing opera. There were still 40 three-pointers taken in the game, including Damian Lillard\u2019s game-winner. It is possible, it seems, for centers to still contribute offensively in this league without having to go behind the arc. 2) Every once in a great while, things work out exactly how you thought they would. I thought Dwight Howard\u2019s remaining skills \u2014 rebounding, post defense, rim protection, screen setting and rolling \u2014 would be good ones in Charlotte, where Steve Clifford expects exertion on both ends of the floor. And so far, Howard has been outstanding for the Bugs, who are trying to weather injury to Nicolas Batum and work Michael Kidd-Gilchrist back into the lineup. 3) Good reads:  B\/R\u2019s Howard Beck on Nikola Jokic and BANG\u2019s Mark Medina on the story behind \u201cPopovich\/Kerr 2020\u201d . 4) The World Series was incredible theatre, incredible drama and incredible baseball. Kudos to both the champion Astros and the Dodgers for seven amazing games. 1) If you don\u2019t understand Draymond Green\u2019s issue with the word \u201cowner\u201d in the context of today\u2019s pro player protests, you\u2019re being willfully ignorant. No one begrudges Mark Cuban or anyone else whose intelligence, hard work and perseverance over a lifetime have left them in position to have enough capital to buy and then run a sports franchise. Nor does Green. To suggest that he and others uncomfortable with the word \u201cowner\u201d are doing so is unfair. How many times do you hear fans say \u2018well, he\/she owns the team; they can trade\/fire\/sign whoever they want?\u2019 I\u2019ve said that a few thousand times myself over the years. Yet I\u2019m also sensitive to the argument that the right of the franchise owner to make those decisions connotes control over the player\/person that is being signed\/traded\/fired, etc. And that has historic overtones in a nation where some still won\u2019t acknowledge the Civil War was fought over slavery. Recall what the late Dorothy Ewing, Patrick Ewing\u2019s mother, said to John Thompson, Jr., when the then-Hoyas coach was in the Ewing home to get the teenage boy\u2019s parents to sign the letter of intent that would commit Patrick Ewing to Georgetown. Thompson recalled in Sports Illustrated, years later: \u201cI asked her to sign. She looked at me and said, \u2018Mr. Thompson, you sign for land. You don\u2019t sign for people.\u2019 \u201d Everyone who works has a boss. You do, I do. ( My boss is named Tara . She\u2019s cool.) Now, how would you feel if someone said you have an owner instead of a boss? \u201cPete, this is Sam, your owner.\u201d That\u2019s a different relationship. And that\u2019s all that Green was trying to say. 2) I\u2019m so damned tired of your thoughts and prayers. It\u2019s time for those who have power and influence to do something about this mass murder madness! Don\u2019t give me \u201cwhat about Chicago?\u201d in response. Do something. Try something. Try anything. If it doesn\u2019t work, it doesn\u2019t work. Nothing is worth than your doing nothing, tragedy after tragedy. This is not \u201cthe cost of freedom.\u201d This is insanity. 3) So sad to read this , but hopefully, as Breanna Stewart hopes, someone else will be spared the horrific abuse she suffered as a result of her speaking out. 4) For all the caterwauling about lower NFL ratings, maybe the reason pro football\u2019s numbers are down this year is not because of backlash against player protests, but because so many high-profile stars \u2014 Aaron Rodgers, J.J. Watt, Odell Beckham, Jr., David Johnson, Andrew Luck and, last Thursday, Houston Texans rookie sensation quarterback Deshaun Watson \u2014 have suffered serious injuries and been out of action for large chunks of the season. * * * MORE MORNING TIP:  Young Lakers see bright future | DA\u2019s Top 15 Rankings | What\u2019s next for Okafor, Sixers? | Q&A: C.J.

No, me neither. 15) Orlando Magic (2-2) [14]: Elfrid Payton close to returning, which will provide coach Frank Vogel with a tough call: D.J.

The call baffled Anthony and Oklahoma City coach Billy Donovan. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen, in the history of the game, a guy gets an and-1 play and then get ejected from the game,\u201d Donovan said. Anthony left the game with 4:26 remaining in the third quarter. He had 15 points and six rebounds. The Blazers held off the Thunder 103-99 . Joe Borgia, NBA Senior Vice President of Replay & Referee Operations, joined the GameTime crew to break down why the officials ruled a Flagrant 2 foul. Crew chief Rodney Mott also explained his ruling via pool report: \u201cWe deemed that the contact was excessive and that it was not a natural basketball move where he seeks out Nurkic, hits him in the face with an elbow and goes back to the basket. So because it\u2019s unnatural and it\u2019s deemed excessive, therefore it is a (Flagrant 2).\u201d"},{"id":43332,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/james-harden-erupts-career-high-56-points-just-25-shots","date":"2017-11-06","title":"James Harden erupts for career-high 56 points with ruthless efficiency in Houston Rockets' victory","content":"James Harden turned in one of the most efficient performances in NBA history on Sunday, scoring 56 points on 25 shots as the Rockets rolled past the Jazz 137-110 .

The 22-year-old power forward is tied for third in the NBA in scoring (29.0) and has already posted six games with at least 30 points, most in the league. After a thrilling performance against Phoenix on Friday, Porzingis received huge praise from his opponent. Former Knicks center Tyson Chandler said the 7-foot-3 Latvian has a legitimate chance at being the top player in the game. \u201cPorzingis is special,\u201d the Suns veteran told Newsday . \u201cHe has a chance to be the best player in this league.

And that\u2019s something I\u2019m going to work towards,\u201d as quoted by the New York Post on Saturday. Porzingis\u2019 talent has been well known across the league since he began his young career, but has been in the spotlight early on this season after the departure of Carmelo Anthony. His athleticism, mobility and shot-making skills are part of an offensive package that not many players his size possess.

That\u2019s why this season, we\u2019re opening our doors to all those 32-year-old NBAers. So for 2017-18, chances are fairly good that our list will see a healthy dose of a King, a gritty point guard in Houston, a 7-foot Spaniard, a hoodie in OKC and an L-Train. As for the past kings of the mountain, does Dwyane Wade ( last season\u2019s champion ) or Pau Gasol ( champ in 2015-16 ) have enough in the tank to be legitimate threats? Let the season-long battle begin. 1. LeBron James (32), Cleveland Cavaliers Last weeks\u2019 stats: 7 games, 25.1 ppg, 6.0 rpg, 8.9 apg Season stats: 25.6 ppg, 7.0 rpg, 8.9 apg Admit it: you are truly surprised at who is holding down the top spot to begin the 2017-18 season, right? In all honesty, it could be a while before someone bumps James from this perch. In addition to the main stats listed above, LBJ added 1.3 steals, 58.8 shooting from the field and double-digit assists in three of seven games. Of course if we\u2019re nitpicking, he did have eight turnovers in two games. Last weeks\u2019 stats: 7 games, 23.4 ppg, 8.4 rpg, 1.6 apg Season stats: 23.6 ppg, 8.6 rpg, 1.9 apg With Kawhi Leonard injured to start the season, Aldridge has been forced to be more aggressive \u2014 and more offensive. So far, the results have been positive, with the big man going for 20-plus points in six of seven games. He\u2019s also showing range, connecting on six 3-pointers already after hitting just 23 all of last season. Last weeks\u2019 stats: 7 games, 21.3 ppg, 9.4 rpg, 2.6 apg Season stats: 20.4 ppg, 9.6 rpg, 2.8 apg Gasol has gotten off to a nice start at both ends of the court. Brushing aside Saturday\u2019s six-point showing in which he shot just 1-for-8, the 7-footer has gone over 20 points in five of the first seven while averaging 1.7 blocks. In fact, Gasol already has three games with 25-plus points and 10-plus rebounds. He only had two such games all of last season.  4. Carmelo Anthony (33), Oklahoma City Thunder Last weeks\u2019 stats: 6 games, 23.0 ppg, 5.0 rpg, 1.7 apg Season stats: 22.9 ppg, 4.4 rpg, 1.6 apg Anthony has taken to his new surroundings quite nicely, pouring in 20 or more points in six of his first seven games with the Thunder. He\u2019s also been remarkably consistent no matter the amount of rest: 22.0 points on 45.7 FG% in back-to-back games; 24.5 points on 48.8 FG% on one day of rest; 22.5 points on 48.4 FG% on two days of rest. Last weeks\u2019 stats: 7 games, 14.3 ppg, 7.4 rpg, 2.3 apg Season stats: 14.9 ppg, 7.3 rpg, 2.4 apg When it comes to Millsap, it\u2019s not about style points but rather solid production. The numbers don\u2019t make you look twice, but you know what you\u2019re getting from the four-time All-Star. One thing we have taken notice of is the improvement from beyond the arc, already connecting on 9-for-23 3s, putting him on pace for more than 80, which would be a career high. Last weeks\u2019 stats: 8 games, 12.3 ppg, 3.0 rpg, 4.4 apg Season stats: 12.3 ppg, 3.0 rpg, 4.4 apg The good: Barea has connected on three or more 3s in five of nine games while also eclipsing double-digit scoring in six contests. The bad: the veteran guard is shooting just 39.8 from the field. The ugly: Barea is averaging 2.2 turnovers, his highest since 2011-12. The cool: His 41.3 clip from deep would be a career best.  Last weeks\u2019 stats: 8 games, 11.5 ppg, 5.8 rpg, 2.1 apg Season stats: 11.3 ppg, 5.8 rpg, 1.9 apg What can we realistically expect this season from the big German? After all, he\u2019s no longer the go-to-guy in Dallas, averaging just 10.5 FGA through the first nine games. He has, however, hit at least two treys in five games and is shooting 44.8 from deep this season. We don\u2019t openly root for players, but we\u2019re pulling for Nowitzki to do enough this season to be a fixture on our list. Last weeks\u2019 stats: 7 games, 8.7 ppg, 6.7 rpg, 1.4 apg Season stats: 8.4 ppg, 6.4 rpg, 1.6 apg With the firepower surrounding him this season in Minnesota, Gibson won\u2019t be a big scoring threat. But that\u2019s never been his calling card. Averaging just under 30 minutes, Gibson shot 62.2 from the field and went for double-digit scoring and two steals in three games. He\u2019s also done something twice this season he didn\u2019t do once in 23 games after getting dealt to OKC in 2016-17: manage a double-double. Last weeks\u2019 stats: 7 games, 11.1 ppg, 2.3 rpg, 0.7 apg Season stats: 9.8 ppg, 2.0 rpg, 0.6 apg Like last season, and the season before that, we have a good idea what we\u2019re going to get with Korver. There will be good games in which his long-range stroke is on (i.e. 17 points in 19 minutes on Oct. 20) followed by ugly performances (i.e. two points on 1-for-5 shooting on Oct. 21). He followed that up four nights later with a 22-point outing. It should a roller-coaster ride all season. Last weeks\u2019 stats: 6 games, 10.8 ppg, 6.3 rpg, 1.2 apg Season stats: 10.8 ppg, 6.3 rpg, 1.2 apg The big 20-point, 15-rebound games are probably in the rear-view mirrow, but Z-Bo will still provide a handful of solid performances before the season comes to an end. In six games during the first two weeks, Randolph scored in double digits five times. He also managed to pull down five or more rebounds during that span. Just missed the cut: Marcin Gortat, Pau Gasol, JJ Redick, Jamal Crawford Will turn 32 this season:  Dwight Howard (Dec. 8), Gerald Green (Jan. 26), Rajon Rondo (Feb. 22), Corey Brewer (March 5), Kyle Lowry (March 25), Marco Belinelli (March 25).

There\u2019s really no excuse for us not to take that next step,\u201d Beal told ESPN . \u201cWe control our own destiny at this point.\u201d \u201cI feel like we\u2019re the best team [in the Eastern Conference],\u201d Beal added. Their 2017-18 litmus test came early in November, on a nationally televised game against the three-year Eastern Conference standard that is Cleveland. The Wizards do not fear the Cavaliers, nor their star forward who has owned the East for seven consecutive seasons. They insist the reverse is true. They believe Cleveland and LeBron James fear them. When asked by ESPN\u2019s Rachel Nichols whether he felt the Cavaliers purposefully lost games to avoid a second-round matchup with Washington, All-Star guard John Wall didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cI think if you look at last year, people might say they did or didn\u2019t, but I think they didn\u2019t want the number one seed for a reason because we would\u2019ve played them in the second round.\u201d \u201cI think we just give them the best matchup problems out of any team in the East,\u201d Wall added. Wall\u2019s comments were opportunistic. The Cavaliers entered Friday night\u2019s contest on a four-game losing streak, boasting one of the worst defenses in the league and an overall sense of apathy toward the regular season. James\u2019s nightly brilliance notwithstanding, the three-time defending conference champions looked old and uninterested. Until Friday, when James looked more than interested. He looked engaged. Maybe even enraged. On Friday night, James did the opposite of \u201cavoiding\u201d Washington. He attacked them. More specifically, he targeted the Wall again and again and again. He ran pick-and-rolls with whomever Wall was guarding. Once he got the 6-4 guard to switch on him, James put him through a beautiful torture chamber of post moves . He ran pell-mell on the fast break and dunked over space just vacated by Beal and others. By the time Cleveland finished Washington, 130-122 , James was polishing off a full-course meal of 57 points, 11 rebounds, seven assists, three steals and two blocks. It seemed too coincidental for James to have dominated in such a fashion without using the Wizards\u2019 comments as fuel. After all, the performance marked just the second time James attempted 34 shots or more in a regular season game since \u2014 wait for it \u2014 2006. Yet after the dust settled, the four-time MVP brushed off any insinuation that his motivation was more than wanting to wrench his team from a four-game losing streak. \u201cI really don\u2019t have a comment about [what they said],\u201d James told reporters. \u201cWe\u2019ve got seven new guys and I\u2019m trying to get these guys focused, get myself focused, get our team focused on what it takes for us to win every night.\u201d Believe him or not, James\u2019s performance at the very least should serve notice to those who thought the Cavaliers were showing signs of vulnerability. After the game, James said \u2014 in serious tones \u2014 that he was \u201calmost back to myself\u201d in terms of conditioning. That was after playing nearly 43 minutes, including all of the second half. When Cavs head coach Tyronn Lue asked if his star needed a second-half breather, James replied with a curt \u201cno\u201d before returning to the action. His unrelenting path of destruction obliterated several milestones along the way, including the 29,000 career points barrier and several mini-leaps up league leaderboards. Those marks serve well to remind the NBA of what James has done. On Friday, he reminded a young Wizards team of what he can still do."},{"id":43360,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/mark-cuban-thinks-draymond-green-owes-nba-apology","date":"2017-11-04","title":"Report: Mavs owner Mark Cuban wants Golden State Warriors' Draymond Green to apologize","content":"One week ago, Draymond Green made his feelings felt on Instagram following controversial comments by NFL team owner Bob McNair.

Giannis Antetokounmpo\u2019s blazing start to this, his fifth NBA season, rose from the glorious ashes of his breakout fourth season in a Milwaukee Bucks uniform . \u201cThe Greek Freak\u201d has been on a steady rise, he debuts at No. 1 on the first Kia Race to the MVP Ladder of this season, is calculated and rooted in his unwavering focus on the right here and right now. Middleton can attest to as much, having witnessed the meteoric rise from the inside. \u201cHe\u2019s working at it constantly, every second of every day,\u201d the Bucks\u2019 swingman said earlier this week from a corner in the visiting locker room before a Sunday matinee at Philips Arena. \u201cLook at him, he knows what\u2019s at stake right now, that he\u2019s gone to that next level. And he\u2019s hungry for more. We all see it. It\u2019s been going on for a while now, nonstop through the offseason, in camp and right into the season. It\u2019s crazy to see where he\u2019s at right now compared to where he was a couple years ago.\u201d Middleton spoke while Antetokounmpo went through a vigorous stretching routine just a few feet away, his eyes locked in on the flat screen showing highlights of a Hawks team that would become the victims of yet another one of his early-season barrages. While the rest of the locker room was relatively laid back 90 minutes before the game \u2014 a normal sight before an early Sunday game after a night off in Atlanta \u2014 Antetokounmpo was locked in. Thirty-eight minutes (and 33 points, 11 rebounds, six assists) later , it all made sense. \u201cFor me personally, I just wanted to set a good tone,\u201d Antetokounmpo said, \u201ccome out aggressive, play hard so everyone could see that and play hard and be aggressive.\u201d That\u2019s the way he started the season. Though the first three games, Antetokounmpo set a blistering pace, averaging 38.3 points on 67 percent shooting to go along with 9.6 rebounds, five assists and 2.6 steals, one block and a week\u2019s worth of highlights packed into each outing. He joined Shaquille O\u2019Neal and Wilt Chamberlain as the only players in NBA history to score 115 or more points and shoot better than 65 percent through the first three games of their team\u2019s season. After four games he was alone, the only player in league history to pile up as many points (147), rebounds (43) and assists (21) as he had. Antetokounmpo fired the first shot in this season\u2019s MVP chase while many of the usual suspects were trying to work out roster kinks or recover from a championship afterglow in an abbreviated training camp and preseason. Maybe the words of others has helped fuel his fire. Kobe Bryant issued his own MVP challenge during the summer . Front-office types around the league had nothing but praise for him in NBA.com\u2019s annual GM Survey . And, perhaps best of all, reigning Finals MVP Kevin Durant admitted that Antetokounmpo, 22, is his favorite player to watch and suggested he could be the the best to ever play . \u201cThe Greek Freak, I think, is a force. I\u2019ve never seen anything like him,\u201d Durant said. \u201cHis ceiling is probably \u2014 he could end up being the best player to ever play if he really wanted to. That\u2019s pretty scary to think about.\u201d Middleton, who has been there to see it all from the beginning, insists we\u2019d all be wise to believe the hype. Last season, after Antetokounmpo became just one of five players in NBA history to lead his team in points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocks for an entire season, there was no turning back. Now that his strength has improved to the point where he can\u2019t be so easily knocked off his spots offensively and he can score in so many different ways, without coming close to mastering his stroke beyond the 3-point line, he\u2019s basically unguardable. \u201cGiannis is truly a student of the game,\u201d Middleton said. \u201cHe listens to the coaches, they show him film and he\u2019s always in the gym working on his game and trying to find ways to get better. And right now, as you can see, it\u2019s paying off. You can see his growth and maturity day-by-day, and on the inside and it\u2019s crazy. So I can only imagine how crazy it must be to you guys on the outside looking at it. \u201cBut trust me, what you are seeing \u2026 it\u2019s real.\u201d * * * The top five in the first edition of the 2017-18 Kia Race to the MVP Ladder: Season stats:  31.3 points per game, 10.6 rebounds per game, 5.3 assists per game His MVP case:  Antetokounmpo and the Bucks needed a day off after two rough outings: a home loss on Halloween to the Oklahoma City Thunder and a tough loss in Charlotte a night later . His energy should be sky-high for tonight\u2019s Central Division road showdown against the Detroit Pistons ( 7 ET, NBA League Pass ). For a player as dialed-in as Antetokounmpo has been to start 2017-18, you can bet he\u2019s studied his first subpar shooting game of the season ( 14 points on 5-for-16 shooting vs. Charlotte ) and will have a response ready. After eight games, it\u2019s clear that no matter how good he is on his own \u2014 and he\u2019s been spectacular \u2014 the Bucks need to make sure Antetokounmpo is supported with more of what Khris Middleton gave them (43 points) against the Hornets. Season stats:  26.6 ppg, 4.8 rpg, 9.2 apg His MVP case:  Harden was supposed to have superstar help this season in the form of Chris Paul. But outside of Paul laboring through 33 minutes in the season-opening win over the Golden State Warriors with a bulky knee, Harden has had to do more of what he did last season. He\u2019s perfectly capable of leading the Rockets in every way imaginable. Houston\u2019s 6-3 record heading into tonight\u2019s road game against the Atlanta Hawks ( 7:30 ET, NBA League Pass ) is a testament to Harden\u2019s ability to lift the team up. We won\u2019t get to see he and Paul in action again until sometime later this month, at the earliest. Only then will we know exactly what Harden and these new-look Rockets are capable of. Season stats:  19.6 ppg, 9.9 rpg, 11.9 apg His MVP case:  Westbrook\u2019s triple-double pursuit fueled his Kia MVP campaign last season. With Paul George and Carmelo Anthony around to share the load this season in Oklahoma City, the theory was Westbrook wouldn\u2019t have to grind like he did in 2016-17. And yet he\u2019s already collected four triple-doubles and has come up one assist shy of a triple-double in two other games. He\u2019s leading the league in assists while still getting comfortable with his new crew. The only chase Westbrook is interested in these days is the hunt for that top seed in the Western Conference. If reaching that goal means piling up more assists ( he\u2019s leading the league in assists per game ) and rebounds while sacrificing some scoring, so be it. Season stats:  30.1 ppg, 13.0 rpg, 5.9 apg His MVP case: This is space usually reserved for New Orleans\u2019 superstar big man counterpart, Anthony Davis. He\u2019s off to a fine start this season as well. But it\u2019s \u201cBoogie\u201d Cousins who, save for Monday\u2019s rough outing in a home loss to Orlando , has been the most consistent force for the Pelicans. He followed up his historic 41-point, 23-rebound, six-assist performance in an Oct. 26 win against the Sacramento Kings with a triple-double (29-12-10) two days later in a 22-point home romp against LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers. The urgency of this season in New Orleans is clearly on his mind and not only is Cousins playing like it, he\u2019s raised the tenor of things for Davis and the rest of the Pelicans. The only way this ends properly is with the Pelicans fighting for a playoff spot. Season stats:  22.9 ppg, 8.1 rpg, 4.7 apg His MVP case: If you don\u2019t think the competitor in Griffin wasn\u2019t energized entering 2017-18, you haven\u2019t been paying attention. That\u2019s especially true after a summer in which the Clippers watched Chris Paul, J.J. Redick and Jamal Crawford all leave. Simply put, Griffin has started this season like a man on a mission. He\u2019s already nailed a game-winning 3-pointer at the buzzer to beat Portland , is shooting a career-best 43.2 percent from 3-point range . And, he\u2019s playing his point-forward role to perfection. Even with back-to-back losses to the Detroit Pistons and Golden State Warriors , Griffin woke up this morning as the ringleader on a Clippers team that sits atop the Western Conference standings. There is more fight in Griffin and these Clippers than anyone gave them credit for after Paul\u2019s departure. * * * Next five: 6. Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors 7. LeBron James, Cleveland Cavaliers 8. Kyrie Irving, Boston Celtics 9. Kevin Durant, Golden State Warriors 10. Andrew Wiggins, Minnesota Timberwolves And five more \u2026: Joel Embiid, Philadelphia 76ers Marc Gasol, Memphis Grizzlies Aaron Gordon, Orlando Magic Victor Oladipo, Indiana Pacers Kristaps Porzingis, New York Knicks * * * An Inside Look at Victor Oladipo (from an Eastern Conference advance scout): \u201cWhen the trade went down and Oladipo and (Domantas Sabonis) were sent to Indiana for Paul George, it took me a few days to pick my jaw up off the floor. There was no way you watch those guys in Oklahoma City last season and think the Pacers are getting anything close to value for a player like Paul, who is one of the handful of best two-way players in our league. But both Victor and the Sabonis kid have been outstanding for the Pacers so far. Things will change as teams get a chance to see them a bit more and figure out how to take away some of the things that they\u2019ve been rolling with early. That said, I can see Oladipo\u2019s confidence growing with every outing. \u201cHe\u2019s more comfortable when he\u2019s operating as the first option than when he\u2019s trying to figure out how to play off of someone else. He and Russ [Westbrook] never really fit well in Oklahoma City. Russ was never going to sacrifice his game for Victor the way he will for George and Carmelo [Anthony]. Give Nate [McMillan] credit, he\u2019s put the ball in Victor\u2019s hands and is allowing him to play with freedom that he never has had in his previous stops. Granted, it\u2019s a small sample size. We need to see more, much more. He\u2019s shooting the cover off the ball from deep, though, and that really does open up his entire game. He\u2019s going to get all of the shots he wants on this team. Sustaining this elevated level of play is the key. If he keeps it up, check back with me at Christmas, this could be a game changing season for him.\u201d * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

Every NBA team opened this season with a G League alum on its roster, some with many of them. The NBA says 38 percent of its players right now have at least some G League experience, and that number has been rising rapidly in recent years. In 2004-05, there were 15 G League graduates starting the season in the NBA; this season, there were 167. Detroit, Atlanta, Toronto, Chicago and Miami combined to have 48 G League alums on their rosters \u2013 more than the entire NBA had a decade ago. \u201cI absolutely think all are really realizing the high level of talent, the high level of competition that we have in the league,\u201d G League President Malcolm Turner said. \u201cWe are a league of opportunity and a league of aspiration. We can be a launch pad to help NBA dreams come true whether you\u2019re a player, coach, referee, on down the line and that\u2019s reflected in the style of play that you see. Our guys get after it, night in and night out.\u201d The league is now up to a record 26 teams; a 27th is coming next season and Turner hasn\u2019t ruled out the chance that the league\u2019s goal \u2013 30 teams, all single-affiliated with an NBA club \u2013 could become reality within a year or two at the most. It\u2019s also the first season with two-way contract opportunities for players, who can spend up to 45 days in the NBA on those more-lucrative deals while continuing to develop in the G League. The G League will also again be a laboratory of sorts for the NBA. To start this season, the G League is using four-person refereeing crews instead of the customary three, plus will be offering a coach\u2019s challenge and a 2-minute overtime. As has been the case with plenty of other experiments over the years, the NBA will study what happens and see if the results suggest it could help their game. But when it comes to the female referees, that\u2019s no experiment. Many worked summer league games this year, and Holtkamp \u2013 the only woman working NBA games as an official right now \u2013 is looking forward to the day when female refs might no longer be viewed as a novelty. \u201cI\u2019m invigorated knowing there are talented and determined women in the developmental program who have access to the best training in the world,\u201d Holtkamp said. \u201cI believe in their ability to do this work.\u201d"},{"id":43379,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nba-hold-lottery-chicago-next-spring","date":"2017-11-03","title":"NBA to hold lottery in Chicago next spring","content":" CHICAGO (AP) \u2014 The NBA says it will hold its draft lottery in Chicago next spring.

Forward Tristan Thompson could be out a month with a strained left calf. One of Cleveland\u2019s most dependable players over the past few years, Thompson was injured in the second quarter Wednesday night in a loss to the Indiana Pacers. Thompson, who has been moved out and in of the starting lineup by coach Tyronn Lue, left Quicken Loans Arena using crutches. The team said an MRI confirmed the strain and that he\u2019ll need as much as four weeks to recover before he plays again. Thompson\u2019s injury is the latest setback for the Cavs, who have dropped four straight and are 3-5, not where a team expected to make it to its fourth NBA Finals figured to be at this point. But injuries, new players, an older roster and defensive lapses have contributed to make the three-time defending Eastern Conference champions one of the early season\u2019s surprises \u2014 for the wrong reasons. Cleveland has lost the past four games by a combined 64 points, the most lopsided four-game span for James since he lost four in a row during his rookie season. But that\u2019s when he was virtually alone on a Cleveland team, not one with All-Stars like Kevin Love, Dwyane Wade and Derrick Rose. As the Cavs regrouped at practice before leaving to play the Washington Wizards on Friday, there were signs of concern or panic about the slow start from such an experienced team. Losses are going to happen. \u201cNo one in here is a rookie,\u201d Wade said. \u201cEveryone in here has been through it. Lots of guys have been through the highest of the highs and the lowest of the lows. It\u2019s frustrating when you\u2019re going through it. We have to continue to understand that we\u2019re going to get out of this together and this is going to be a distant memory at one point, but right now we\u2019re in it. We have to figure it out and I think we will.\u201d Wade said communication, or a lack of it, has been at the root of Cleveland\u2019s problems. With the league\u2019s oldest roster, it\u2019s not a surprise that the Cavs are struggling defensively against younger, and in some cases, more athletic teams. But what it alarming is that the Cavs have been slow to correct their mistakes and teams are shooting so well against them. Cleveland\u2019s opponents are making a league-high 42 percent of their 3-point attempts. Wade joked that it feels like teams are \u201cshooting like 90 percent on open shots and 70 percent on contested shots.\u201d \u201cWe have a long way to go defensively,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we was at our best defensively and they was tagging us like this, it\u2019d be red alert. Right now, as we said, we\u2019ve got to continue to get our coverages down, our communication down.\u201d Lue has been scrambling to come up with combinations that work, and his job has been made more difficult by injuries to Rose, Iman Shumpert and with James working himself into shape after missing most of the preseason with a sprained ankle. Also, the Cavs are still without All-Star guard Isaiah Thomas, who is still recovering from a hip injury. Wade, who signed a one-year deal for a chance to play alongside his close friend James again, likened the Cavs\u2019 current state to something he experienced a few years ago in Miami. After winning consecutive titles, the Heat started 4-3 before winning 10 straight games. They finished 54-28, won the conference title and made the Finals for the fourth straight year. Wade is still amazed it happened. \u201cI don\u2019t know how we made it,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a team, we were kind of like this. It was worse because it wasn\u2019t new guys. It was guys who had been around each other four years in a row. Your jokes weren\u2019t funny anymore to other guys, when you walked in it wasn\u2019t a big smile any more. Guys were just over you. It\u2019s like being in a bad marriage. But we somehow made it to the Finals. \u201cIndiana should have beat us that year. We had a mental edge over those guys and we were able to win. But we shouldn\u2019t have been there. So it\u2019s tough, definitely. That\u2019s why it hasn\u2019t been done a lot. For the guys here, you have to pull from something else to motivate you, to get you to feel that hunger again like you had that first year. That\u2019s sports, it\u2019s tough.\u201d"},{"id":43387,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/gordon-hayward-talks-injury-recovery","date":"2017-11-02","title":"Gordon Hayward talks leg injury, long road to recovery","content":"WALTHAM, Mass.

Another thing for them to get hurt on.\u201d Less than three weeks after breaking his left leg on the court less than six minutes into his Celtics career, Hawyard limped out onto the team\u2019s practice court with crutches to talk about the injury and his plans for the season. Unwilling to put a timetable on his return \u2013 his agent has said it won\u2019t be this year \u2013 Hayward will instead spend his time rehabbing, helping the coaching staff and \u201cchair-shooting,\u201d just to keep his eye sharp. * Hayward pens post on injury  \u201cI\u2019m on the road to recovery,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cIt feels good to talk in front of you guys and to get out of the house a little bit.\u201d An Indianapolis native who stayed home to play at Butler, Hayward played the first seven years of his NBA career with the Utah Jazz before agreeing to a four-year, $128 million deal to reunite with Bulldogs coach Brad Stevens in Boston. But in the first quarter of the season opener against Cleveland, Hayward landed awkwardly and crumpled to the court with his left leg bent at an unnatural angle. To fly back to Boston with the team that night, Hayward had to be carried up two flights of stairs onto the plane. It took four people, and Stevens insisted on helping. \u201cThere was probably 20 people there. But Brad wanted to make sure he was one of the people who carried me up the stairs,\u201d Hayward said. \u201cThat\u2019s just the type of person he is.\u201d The next night, while the Celtics played their home opener without him, Hayward had surgery to repair a broken tibia and dislocated ankle. His agent, Mark Bartelstein, said he is expected to make a full recovery but \u201cit\u2019s very unlikely he\u2019ll play this season.\u201d Hayward said he has heard from all around the NBA since the injury \u2013 including Oklahoma City forward Paul George, who had a similarly devastating injury while practicing for the U.S. Olympic team. Hayward was there when it happened. \u201cI know that he knows exactly what it\u2019s like,\u201d Hayward said, adding that one of the things George told him was that the recovery \u201cdoesn\u2019t go as fast as you want it to go.\u201d Hayward also received messages from other athletes, including Kobe Bryant and NFL players Odell Beckham Jr. and J.J. Watt. He also got an email from former President Barack Obama. All of the support has helped him keep his injury in perspective. \u201cI still have negative thoughts; it\u2019s hard not to, especially when you watch the games. I think I wouldn\u2019t be human if I didn\u2019t have those thoughts. But there\u2019s no reason to continue to sulk and have self-pity,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s a basketball injury and people are going through way, way worse.\u201d The Celtics finished with the No. 1 seed in the East last season, losing in the conference finals to the Cavaliers. During the summer, general manager Danny Ainge revamped the roster, signing Hayward as a free agent and then trading star point guard Isaiah Thomas to Cleveland for fellow all-star Kyrie Irving. Hayward, who agonized over leaving Utah, said he had high hopes for the season, and he \u201cwanted it to go differently.\u201d \u201cSo I was just devastated that I wouldn\u2019t be able to contribute, wouldn\u2019t be able to have the season I wanted to have,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be really important for me and my mental health to stay involved, to still be a part of the team, be around them as much as I can.\u201d At breakfast with Stevens on Thursday morning, the two discussed ways to keep Hayward involved. He will watch video and offer tips to his teammates while also doing everything he can to get back \u2013 if not for this season, then 2018-19. For now, he\u2019s even gotten back onto the court, even if it\u2019s only for \u201cchair-shooting.\u201d \u201cFor two weeks I was in a bed.

Hayward said he\u2019s received a wellspring of support, including emails from Kobe Bryant and Barack Obama. He said he\u2019s especially grateful for support from his new organization, which he joined after seven seasons with the Utah Jazz. \u201cThe Celtics organization has been just over the top in every aspect,\u201d he wrote, noting that Celtics coach Brad Stevens insisted on helping to carry him via stretcher onto the team charter from Cleveland and made several visits to the hospital around his busy schedule. \u201cThey know I will not be back on the court at all this season, but they have been making sure I have every resource I need and are making me feel like I am part of the team.\u201d Hayward said his biggest goal outside of making a full recovery is to figure out how to contribute to a young Celtics team that is sitting at 5-2 despite his absence. \u201cWhether it\u2019s breaking down film or just providing leadership and guidance, I can\u2019t wait to give back,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI\u2019ve already received so much.\u201d"},{"id":43399,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/one-team-one-stat-blazers-struggle-rim","date":"2017-11-02","title":"One Team, One Stat -- Portland Trail Blazers struggle to convert in restricted area","content":" * Tonight on TNT :  Lakers vs. Blazers (10:30 ET) The Portland Trail Blazers are trying to pick up where they left off at the end of the regular season in April. Thanks in part to the acquisition of Jusuf Nurkic, the Blazers were the most improved team after the All-Star break , 7.8 points per 100 possessions better than they were before the break. The Blazers had to trade Allen Crabbe this summer, but are hoping a full season of Nurkic with Damian Lillard and C.J. McCollum will help them break a string of three straight seasons where they lost more games than they did the season before. They started off the season right, beating the Phoenix Suns by 48 points. Since then, the results have been mixed, though the Blazers could be 7-1 if not for the late-game heroics of Giannis Antetokounmpo ( three big defensive plays in the final minute ) and Blake Griffin ( game-winning three at the buzzer ), as well as a 1-for-7 finish at the end of regulation in Utah on Wednesday. Through eight games, the Blazers\u2019 record (4-4) belies their point differential ( plus-56 ), which is that of a 6-2 team. Of course, the point differential is somewhat skewed by a 48-point win in Phoenix on opening night. Since then, the Blazers are 3-4 with a point differential (plus-8) of a team that\u2019s 4-3. Wednesday\u2019s overtime loss was the lone road game in an 11-game stretch that continues with the Blazers\u2019 longest homestand of the season, six games over the next two weeks. Portland will try to get back over .500 with a win over the 3-4 Los Angeles Lakers at 10:30 ET in the second game of TNT\u2019s Thursday double-header.

This isn\u2019t anything new. The Blazers ranked 28th in restricted-area field goal percentage last season and 16th (out of 16 teams) in the 2017 playoffs . Still, shooting less than 50 percent within a few feet of the basket is pretty brutal. The league average last season was 61 percent, giving restricted area shots the highest value (1.22 points per attempt) on the floor. There are six players who have shot less than 50 percent on at least 25 shots in the restricted area , and three of the six \u2013 Maurice Harkless (45 percent), Damian Lillard (47 percent) and Jusuf Nurkic (48 percent) are in Blazers\u2019 starting lineup. A fourth starter \u2013 C.J. McCollum (7-for-20) \u2013 has been the third worst shooter in the restricted area among 128 players with at least 20 attempts . The fifth starter \u2013 Al-Farouq Aminu (10-for-18) \u2013 is also below the league average. The Blazers get a good percentage of their shots in the restricted area, and part of that total is tip-in and put-back attempts. The Blazers are tied for second in offensive rebounding percentage and lead the league in the percentage of their possessions that are put-backs , according to Synergy play-type tracking. The quality of those shots can vary. Some tip-ins are more controlled than others. Even at 47 percent, the Blazers\u2019 restricted-area shots are worth more than their shots between the restricted area and the 3-point line, on which they\u2019ve shot a better-than-average 36 percent. McCollum has been one of the league\u2019s best shooters on non-restricted-area 2-point shots, but over the course of his career his layups (shot at 52 percent) have still been worth more than his other twos (46 percent). Still, an inability to get easy points at the rim puts more pressure on the Blazers to make jumpers. Since the start of last season, the Blazers are 33-17 when they\u2019ve had an *effective field goal percentage of 50 percent or better on shots from outside the paint, and 12-28 when they haven\u2019t. * Effective field goal percentage = (FGM + (0.5 * 3PM)) \/ FGA The Blazers have missed seven of their eight shots in the restricted area with the game within five points in the last five minutes. That makes for some frustrating moments. Through Wednesday, Portland ranks 26th in overall effective field goal percentage (48.5 percent), even though its ranks sixth from outside the paint (52.5 percent). The Blazers\u2019 restricted-area shooting should rise above 50 percent in the next few weeks, but their inability to finish will continue to haunt them from time to time. Below is a possession where Nurkic sets three screens. The final one frees Evan Turner for a foul-line jumper and draws Alex Len to the ball, which allows Nurkic to get rebounding position under the basket. But he misses the tip. Fairly simple, but also a prototypical Blazers miss in the restricted area. Another common theme among their misses is Lillard going with the high degree of difficulty (bonus missed tip-in from Harkless)\u2026 \u2022 NBA.com\/stats Video:  Watch the Blazers shoot 9-for-22 in the restricted area against the Clippers on Oct. 26 1. The Blazers have allowed 8.7 fewer points per 100 possessions than they did last season . That makes them the fourth most improved defensive team in the league through Wednesday. But if you throw away the opening-night win in Phoenix, the improvement isn\u2019t so drastic and they rank 12th defensively (102.8 points allowed per 100 possessions) instead of fifth (99.1) . Still, four of their eight games have been against teams \u2013 the Pacers, Bucks, Clippers and Raptors \u2013 that currently rank in the top 10 in offensive efficiency . Other teams have played easier schedules in that regard, and the Blazers held both Indiana and Toronto under their season-long marks for points scored per 100 possessions. Portland leads the league in opponent effective field goal percentage . For the second straight season, they lead the league in opponent field goal percentage in the restricted area. But a big chunk of their improvement has come in opponent 3-point percentage , which we shouldn\u2019t put much faith in at this point in the season. Also, it should be a little concerning that they\u2019ve had the league\u2019s seventh biggest increase in the percentage of opponent shots that come from the restricted area or 3-point range. You can better control what shots your opponents take, and the Blazers haven\u2019t been as good at forcing the less-efficient ones. But the Blazers have also seen a big improvement in defensive rebounding percentage, ranking in the top five after ranking 12th last season (and 10th after the All-Star break ). 2. The Blazers have been 17.4 points per 100 possessions better in the second half of games (plus-16.2) than they\u2019ve been in the first half (minus-1.1) . That\u2019s the biggest such differential in the league through Wednesday. The Blazers have yet to lose the second half, having won it in their first seven games and played even with the Jazz in the second half on Wednesday. The bigger difference (11.1 points per 100 possessions) between the first-half Blazers and the second-half Blazers has been on offense. Lillard and McCollum have a combined effective field goal percentage of 43 percent in the first half and 56 percent in the second half. Nurkic has also shot much better in the second half of games ( 49 percent vs. 38 percent ). 3. The Blazers have been almost 28 points per 100 possessions better with Aminu on the floor (plus-16.6) than with him on the bench (minus-11.2). It\u2019s early and the Phoenix game has to be taken into account with everything, but Aminu has been Portland\u2019s plus-minus man this season. And that may be about who\u2019s on the floor when Terry Stotts is staggering the minutes of Lillard and McCollum. Last season, when McCollum went to the bench midway through the first and third quarters, Harkless was more likely to stay on the floor with Lillard. And last season, Harkless had the better on-off numbers than Aminu, who played more minutes with McCollum than with Lillard. This season, Aminu has played more minutes with Lillard and Nurkic than with McCollum and the Blazers\u2019 back-up bigs. The Blazers\u2019 most-used two-man combination has been Aminu and Lillard, who have played 233 minutes together. * * * John Schuhmann is a staff writer for NBA.com.

Pretty much the entire NBA was surprised to see Watson sacked so quickly \u2014 faster, in fact, than all but two other dismissals in league history. That\u2019s what happens when you tumble out of the gates with two losses of 42 points or more and the NBA\u2019s worst net rating by a huge margin at minus 26.6 points per 100 possessions. (For reference, the Lakers led the NBA last season at a comparatively paltry minus 7.2 per 100.) But even more shocking than the Suns\u2019 shambolic start is their red-hot play under interim coach Jay Triano, whose record improved to 4-1 with an impressive 122-116 victory over the Wizards in which they rallied from 22 points down. T.J. Warren scored 28 of his career-high 40 points in the second half, and Devin Booker added 22 for the Suns, who scored 35 or more in each of the final three quarters to earn a victory that would have been unthinkable a week ago. \u201cIt shows we\u2019re mentally tough,\u201d Warren told AZCentral.com . \u201cWe\u2019re growing and getting better day by day.\u201d And they\u2019re doing it not only with a new coach but also without the gifted Eric Bledsoe, who was essentially suspended and will likely be traded after tweeting his dissatisfaction with the Suns\u2019 disastrous start. Much of the credit should go to Triano, a no-nonsense lifer who isn\u2019t afraid to bench players to get his message across. While still not great on defense, the Suns have improved their play on that end from 117.0 points allowed per 100 possessions under Watson to 102.0 under Triano \u2014 good for 13th in the NBA during that span. Per AZCentral.com, he\u2019s also gone back to basics on offense with a more standard starting lineup featuring Marquese Chriss, a true power forward, rather than 6-foot-8 rookie Josh Jackson alongside fellow small forward Warren. Beyond stats and strategy, the difference in basic effort is perhaps most noticeable of all. Terry Stotts, whose Blazers helped seal Watson\u2019s fate with a 48-point thrashing on Oct. 18, could scarcely believe they were facing the same Suns 10 days later in a game that went down to the wire .  \u201cI really am impressed with Phoenix,\u201d he said. \u201cThey really turned it around in a short amount of time.

Yes, quality point guards are a dime-a-dozen group now in the NBA. They\u2019re populating the league in such abundance that the Phoenix Suns didn\u2019t flinch when they told disgruntled starter Eric Bledsoe to stay home or the hair salon \u2014 whichever he preferred. It\u2019s hard to find a serious playoff contender that doesn\u2019t have one (and some have two). And then there are the Denver Nuggets and Milwaukee Bucks, who arguably have none. Partly by necessity and partly by choice, both teams are running their offenses through gifted big men and getting reasonably decent results. These two teams are building for a big run while also going against the NBA\u2019s trend \u2026 and, by no coincidence, are the two most logical landing spots for Bledsoe in a trade. Pump the brakes, though. Neither seems to be in a rush because they\u2019re weighing the merits of using young, non-traditional point guards as compliments to the centerpieces: Giannis Antetokoumnpo with the Bucks and Nikola Jokic with the Nuggets. Both are solid passers and act as triggers while their point guards orbit around them, defer to them and pick spots to command the ball. But when, if ever, will either team get cold feet and fall in line with the rest of the NBA? The Suns would like to know, but it could be a long wait if the Bucks get the right results from reigning Kia Rookie of the Year Malcolm Brogdon and the Nuggets likewise from Jamal Murray. Their teams are taking a wait-and-see approach with their development while leaning heavily on Antetokounmpo and Jokic\u2019s respective playmaking. Their coaches are saying all the right things: Jason Kidd of the Bucks: \u201cMalcolm knows how to play the right way. He\u2019s getting better. We\u2019re lucky to have him.\u201d Michael Malone of the Nuggets: \u201cI believe in him and (Murray) has to believe in himself.\u201d Yet both coaches are acutely aware that Murray and Brogdon, because of their size, can also play off the ball. Murray, for one, might be better suited as a game-finisher anyway. Both teams are in play for Bledsoe or perhaps a veteran addition either at the trade deadline or in free agency next summer. Brogdon surprised the NBA in winning Rookie of the Year while Ben Simmons missed last season and Joel Embiid played only 31 games. Still, that doesn\u2019t diminish what Brogdon delivered last season and his value to the Bucks now. He\u2019s wiser than most NBA sophomores because he stayed all four years in college and, as a second-round pick, his sense of urgency and hunger was greater than that of lottery picks. Brogdon is a self-made grinder, a consistent player who rarely screws up and is already one of the Bucks\u2019 better defenders. The Bucks know what they\u2019re getting from him on a nightly basis. \u201cI\u2019m a lot more confident,\u201d Brogdon said. \u201cWhen you have a year of experience and also the experience of playing in the playoffs, it just makes a world of difference. I know what my role is. I feel I\u2019ve found my niche with this team.\u201d Yet, Brogdon\u2019s four assists per game (in 32.1 minutes per game) ranks 38th among starting point guards mainly because of Antetokoumnpo, who handles the ball and runs the offense much like LeBron James does. Brogdon\u2019s ability and willingness to blend with Antetokounmpo is helpful to a system that plays off the young superstar\u2019s multiple skills. Giannis is off to an MVP-like start and the last thing the Bucks want to do is slow his roll. But Kidd also wants Brogdon to sharpen his point guard instincts as well. \u201cWe talked about it last year, understanding when it\u2019s time to score, being able to play-make, understanding how to get a teammate a shot, just being consistent when learning how to run the show,\u201d Kidd said. \u201cHe\u2019s been able to run the offense and be a leader. \u201cAnd really, it\u2019s all about that, and understanding who hasn\u2019t touched the ball. That\u2019s what makes a point guard special in this league. Figure out how to get the ball to the right people at the right time. That\u2019s the next step for Malcolm.\u201d The Nuggets waited until the eve of the season to name their starter at point guard, although it was clear last year that Murray had pole position. He assumed the role late in the season from Emmanuel Mudiay ( who started 55 games ) and Jameer Nelson ( 40 starts ) and kept the ball, starting seven games. That wasn\u2019t the plan when the Nuggets took him No. 7 overall in the 2016 Draft . Mudiay was their point guard of the future and Murray, who didn\u2019t play the position in college at Kentucky, was projected as a scoring guard. But Mudiay\u2019s erratic shooting, limited range and inconsistent playmaking opened up the job, which Murray won almost by default after the Nuggets waived Nelson . Malone admitted that Muray\u2019s edge on Mudiay, a superior athlete, was shooting. Malone wanted someone with deeper range next to Gary Harris to space the floor for Jokic and newcomer Paul Millsap. Problem is, Murray\u2019s shooting ( 37.1 percent ) has been Mudiay-like here in the early season. From Oct. 21-27, he missed 16 straight 3-pointers and is making just 18.2 percent of his 3-pointers (after shooting 33.4 percent in 2016-17). His defense remains an issue at times ( 100.6 Defensive Rating this season ) and part of the Nuggets\u2019 slow start could be pinpointed to Murray\u2019s growing pains. \u201cI think they drafted me for a reason,\u201d Murray said. \u201cI just go out there and play basketball. I\u2019m not worried about missing. I just got to be thinking about the next shot.\u201d Malone and the Nuggets are taking the long view and realize Murray, 20, is trying to master NBA point guard play on the fly. But if they\u2019re anxious to make a significant move in the tough West this season, the Nuggets\u2019 point guard position might need an upgrade at starter or backup. \u201cHe showed me he\u2019s not afraid of the moment,\u201d Malone said, who added that part of the learning experience for players such as Murray means to deal with the not-so-good days and \u201clet them play through it.\u201d The Nuggets and Bucks are hesitant to include Murray or Brogdon in trade talks for good reason: Both are on cheap rookie deals and are big parts of each team\u2019s future. Teams rarely move players this quickly unless there\u2019s a serious issue ( think Chris Webber after his rookie season in Golden State ) or a deal is too good to skip. It wouldn\u2019t be a surprise if the Nuggets are trying instead to unload Mudiay in a package to Phoenix and the Bucks are selling some combination of John Henson and Matthew Dellavedova. There\u2019s risk, too, in acquiring Bledsoe himself. He went rogue with the Suns and teams usually shy away from players with flapping red flags. If he came to Milwaukee or Denver and didn\u2019t mesh with Giannis or Jokic, it would be a disaster. Until further notice, the Bucks and Nuggets are good to go with the status quo. Teams can gawk all they want at their lack of a true point guard \u2026 and then deal with the sight of a 6-foot-11 Antetokounmpo reaching the rim in three steps, or with the sight of 6-foot-10 Jokic throwing Bill Walton-like backdoor passes from the key.

He entered play Wednesday third in the league in scoring with 29.3 points per game after the best beginning stretch ever for a New York Knicks player. He already was the first player in franchise history to score 30 in four of his first five games, then went for a career-best 38 in a victory over Denver on Monday. The Knicks made him the face of the franchise when they traded Carmelo Anthony, and he looks up for the challenge. \u201cI\u2019m never surprised by my own game,\u201d Porzingis said. \u201cI know what I can do on the basketball court. I always expect the most out of myself.\u201d He steadied the Knicks after a 0-3 start by leading them to three straight victories heading into their game Wednesday against Houston. The extra attention that defenses can pay him now that Anthony is gone hasn\u2019t helped them stop the 7-foot-3 forward. He spent the summer training in Latvia, leading his home country to a quarterfinal finish in the European championships. It appeared that he would return to New York as the No. 2 option, then he became the main man when the Knicks dealt Anthony to Oklahoma City on the eve of training camp. Now Porzingis is scoring in a way even beyond what Anthony did. \u201cI put in so much work and for me it\u2019s not a surprise that I\u2019m able to play at this level right now,\u201d Porzingis said. Porzingis knew he would need strength to get through the long NBA season after losing weight during it in his first two seasons. Searching for a way to keep the weight on, he began at the end of last season eating Zing Bars between meals, trying to meet his goal of eating around 5,000 calories a day. It\u2019s worked so far \u2013 Porzingis said he\u2019s around 243 pounds, about 20 up from his rookie season. And he became such a fan of the product that he decided to invest in the company and will be on its board of directors. \u201cI told them if I\u2019m in, I want to be involved 100 percent and I want to know also the business part of it, not just put my face on the bar and that\u2019s it,\u201d Porzingis said. Those kinds of opportunities will be more available to him now as the marquee player in the biggest market. He wanted to take advantage of them when he arrived as a rookie but quickly realized it took up too much of his time so he cut back, preferring to focus solely on just a few partnerships. He said that hasn\u2019t changed. \u201cThe rest of the stuff will come and it\u2019s already coming,\u201d Porzingis said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of stuff that we say no to just because we want to keep basketball as the main priority, and I need my rest days and I need time off and I can\u2019t be doing stuff every day off. So we really are just doing the stuff that I really want to be involved with.\u201d Porzingis seems well on his way to a first All-Star berth \u2013 though fans at Madison Square Garden were thinking beyond that when they showered him with \u201cMVP! MVP!\u201d chants on Monday, a night after he led the Knicks to a surprising victory in Cleveland. He may not continue scoring at this level, but he thinks he can keep playing that way. \u201cI believe so,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the goal. That\u2019s the goal for me to be consistent throughout the season and I\u2019m doing everything to prepare myself for every game, every practice.\u201d"},{"id":43407,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-taking-stock-cleveland-cavaliers-early-issues","date":"2017-11-01","title":"Blogtable: Should Cleveland Cavaliers fans be frightened by team's early struggles?","content":" * * * We\u2019ve seen this before, early season struggles for the Cavs. But are these the same Cavs? Or are these early struggles something Cavs fans should be frightened by?  * * * David Aldridge :  Call me in April. Seen this movie too many times to be moved by Cleveland\u2019s defensive indifference in October. The age of this year\u2019s top Cavs, combined with the shorter preseason, does lead one to believe that they\u2019re not in great shape yet, and players that use the season to try and improve their conditioning tend to be susceptible to injury. So we need to keep an eye on that. But the only long-term significant question for Cleveland is what Isaiah Thomas shows up on the floor when he returns from his hip injury. If it\u2019s Boston Isaiah \u2014 an elite scorer with devastating fourth-quarter closeout ability \u2014 the Cavs will be fine. That Isaiah is the perfect complement to LeBron and Kevin Love, and will make Cleveland impossible to stop in a seven-game series. But the limited Isaiah of the Eastern Conference finals last spring would be nothing but a target for whoever the Cavs play in June. Steve Aschburner : More concerned about than frightened by, I think. I was counting on all the new faces in Cleveland to grab the Cavaliers\u2019 attention this season in a way last year\u2019s returning crew never fully engaged with its first 82. Between adapting and adjusting to Derrick Rose, Dwyane Wade and Jae Crowder, then shifting gears again when Isaiah Thomas returns, I thought that \u2014 and an alleged MVP push by Kyrie-inspired LeBron James \u2014 would carry the Cavs through these six months. They remain my pick to reach The Finals but this lackluster start only emboldens challengers, from near-contenders in Boston, Washington and Toronto to early-round upstarts like Milwaukee or, given history and matchups, even Detroit. Golden State can get away with this in a way Cleveland cannot. Shaun Powell :  This start seems bizarre, and the wipeouts suffered by the likes of the Brooklyn Nets downright unreal. Usually the Cavs wait until March to become bored; maybe they\u2019re just getting it out of the way early this year. Of course, I tend to ignore pretty much anything weird that happens before Thanksgiving. Besides missing Isaiah Thomas, the Cavs don\u2019t feel the need to finish with the best record in the East \u2014 or the top two, for that matter. They need to stay healthy. If LeBron was hurt, then I\u2019d be frightened for Cavs fans. John Schuhmann : Last season taught us that the regular-season Cavs and the playoff Cavs are two very different teams. But this season\u2019s Cavs are different too, and while defensive malaise is to be expected, there\u2019s reason to be concerned about the offense. They\u2019ve added three guys \u2014 Jeff Green, Derrick Rose and Dwyane Wade \u2014 who have shot a combined 28 percent from 3-point range over the last three-plus seasons. That\u2019s not the best way to complement LeBron James. Floor spacing and 3-point shooting have been the Cavs\u2019 bread and butter over the last three seasons and both have been compromised with the changes they\u2019ve made. So far (small sample size alert), the Cavs have been better offensively with none of those guys on the floor (108 points scored per 100 possessions) than they\u2019ve been with one (105) or two (100). They have time to figure out a new way to succeed offensively, but it\u2019s certainly not a sure thing that they\u2019ll be as good as they were last season.  Sekou Smith : When the Cavaliers were younger, from top to bottom, their temporary struggles didn\u2019t bother me as much. You knew there was method to whatever madness a LeBron James-led team was going through and that he would get them through it. LeBron is still doing LeBron-like things \u2026 but he\u2019s working with a much older crew than normal. So there could be cause for concern, and Cavaliers coach Tyronn Lue has said as much. I don\u2019t frighten as easily, though, so I\u2019m in no rush to push the panic button on the Cavaliers. If they don\u2019t have these issue solved by Thanksgiving, then I\u2019ll be ready to take another look. Yes, the core of this team has played to the final game in each of the past three seasons \u2014 so there has to be some mental, physical and emotional wear-and-tear involved. That\u2019s no excuse. It\u2019s just a reality for any team trying to climb the mountain to The Finals for a fourth straight season. * * * * * *"},{"id":43403,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-dynamic-young-duos-jokic-murray-simmons-embiid-towns-wiggins-brown","date":"2017-11-01","title":"Blogtable: Which young (22 and under) duo is scariest in NBA today?","content":" * * * The scariest young duo (22 and under) in the NBA today: Joel Embiid\/Ben Simmons, Jaylen Brown\/Jayson Tatum, Nikola Jokic\/Jamal Murray, or Karl-Anthony Towns\/Andrew Wiggins?  * * * David Aldridge :  Embiid\/Simmons in a photo over Towns\/Wiggins.

But the reason I pick the Sixers\u2019 duo is that we\u2019ve still yet to see Towns and Wiggins get more personally involved at the defensive end for the Wolves. They\u2019re both too athletic and smart not to impact games more defensively. Minnesota just shouldn\u2019t be 30th in the league in Defensive Rating. No excuse for that. Philly\u2019s not shutting down people by any means, but middle of the pack is better than DFL. Steve Aschburner : Give me the Philly phenoms, who have the potential to be the league\u2019s two best players at the traditionally two most important positions. Embiid\u2019s skills are established; it\u2019s all about his durability. Simmons is looking like the most legit tall point guard since \u2026 well, since the prototype, Earvin (Magic) Johnson. So if all four of our couples max out, the Sixers win. The Celtics\u2019 pair, because of their role as forwards, is like having the best bishops in a game of chess. Denver\u2019s guys don\u2019t strike me as dominant, at their peak, as Embiid-Simmons can be, and Minnesota\u2019s twosome needs to get serious about the defensive end before they win this showdown. Shaun Powell :  I\u2019ll go with Embiid-Simmons with the understandable qualifier of \u201cif they stay healthy.\u201d Embiid can be just as good if not better than Karl-Anthony Towns, while Simmons is massively multi-dimensional and this gives him the edge on the others. The next step for everyone listed is to forge a kinship with each other and develop an understanding that winning trumps all, more than money or ego or buzz. That\u2019s what all dynamic duos in NBA history had, with the exception of Shaq-Kobe at the bitter end. John Schuhmann :  Embiid and Simmons have a combination of size and skill that\u2019s unmatched. Embiid is a seven footer who can do everything on the floor, while Simmons is a 6-foot-10 point guard with incredible vision. They still have some developing to do, but so do the other combinations listed. Wiggins and Towns are in the conversation and more polished offensively, but in their fourth and third seasons, are worse defenders than the Simmons and Embiid, with their 44 games of experience between them.  Sekou Smith :  Embiid and Simmons are downright frightening when you factor in the size for their position, raw talent and injury history for both of these young superstars in training. Towns and Wiggins are a close second, while Jokic and Murray rank third on my list. As talented as all of these young duos are, I just can\u2019t fathom drawing up a better pair of barely of age basketball players than Embiid and Simmons. They are like the perfect puzzle pieces in the \u201ctrust the process\u201d franchise-builder kit. Their versatility, ability to dominate inside and out (as well as in transition) coupled with their upside (I usually dread the word, but it fits here) means there\u2019s no telling where they go next. If their availability comes anywhere close to matching the rest of their respective talent profiles, Philly\u2019s jumbo crew could be the standard-bearing duo in the not-too-distant future for the Eastern Conference. * * * * * *"},{"id":43445,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-orlando-magic-detroit-pistons-fast-start-2017-18-season","date":"2017-11-01","title":"Blogtable: Do you believe in Orlando Magic or Detroit Pistons more?","content":" * * * Which team do you believe in more: the 5-2 Orlando Magic or the 5-3 Detroit Pistons?  * * * David Aldridge :  Despite their loss to the Lakers Tuesday, I\u2019m still more Team Detroit at present, for a couple of reasons. Last season, Orlando was 29th in the NBA in 3-point percentage (.328) and 29th in Offensive Rating (101.2). Through the first two weeks of this season, the Magic is first in 3-point percentage (.441) and second in Offensive Rating (110.9). I just don\u2019t think that kind of perimeter turnaround is sustainable over the course of an entire season. Big men Aaron Gordon and Nikola Vucevic look comfortable shooting 3-pointers so far, but it\u2019s a long season and big guys wear down. The Magic does have significant upside, to be sure (Gordon playing more at center? Sign me up!), and if there\u2019s one thing coach Frank Vogel can build, it\u2019s a defense-first team. But I just like Detroit\u2019s group. I\u2019m a big Avery Bradley guy; he\u2019s a winner and almost everything he does on the court leads to more winning. We\u2019ll see if Tobias Harris and Stanley Johnson can be the answers up front, but IMHO, there\u2019s no reason Harris can\u2019t continue to be a go-to guy. Plus, Andre Drummond looks poised for a big ol\u2019 season, and if he gets back to being disruptive defensively and a Hoover on the boards, Detroit can compete against anyone. It would help them if more people actually show up at Little Caesars Arena. Steve Aschburner : Gotta stick with the Pistons for now. Their loss to the Lakers Tuesday was a disappointment in the context of their back-to-back success over the LA Clippers and the Golden State Warriors, a potential sign of feeling too easily satisfied on the West Coast trip. Detroit has no business even knowing the definition of \u201ccomplacency.\u201d But I did see them bouncing back this season for a playoff spot in the East, which I didn\u2019t project for the Magic. Orlando has more offensive firepower and talent that\u2019s been due to mature, but let\u2019s see how they\u2019re doing a month from now \u2013 nine of their 15 November games are on the road, including a four-game swing out West \u2014 before buying in. Shaun Powell :  Wow \u2026 I\u2019ll give the edge to the Pistons only because their wins (at Clippers and Warriors) are of higher quality, but it\u2019s almost a push. It\u2019s possible that we\u2019re seeing Aaron Gordon finally turn the corner in Orlando, and right on time since it\u2019s a contract year. And likewise for Tobias Harris (interestingly, a Magic giveaway) in Detroit. Both teams made solid offseason pickups in Avery Bradley (Pistons) and Jonathon Simmons (Magic), too. Good to see these franchises are feeling frisky, even in the weak East, although you can\u2019t be totally sold on their staying power until they prove otherwise. John Schuhmann : The Magic have the much better point differential, but their five wins are against teams that are otherwise 15-15, while the Pistons\u2019 five wins (highlighted by back-to-back road wins over the Clippers and Warriors) are over teams that are otherwise 20-9. It\u2019s also clear that Orlando\u2019s numbers from 3-point range \u2014 they\u2019ve shot 44 percent and their opponents have shot 28 percent \u2014 are not sustainable. Aaron Gordon as a full-time four (instead of starting the season at small forward like he did last year) makes a big difference and Frank Vogel knows what he\u2019s doing, but Detroit has more experienced talent, with Reggie Jackson (Tuesday\u2019s game in L.A. notwithstanding) and Andre Drummond both looking much better than they did last season. Sekou Smith : Right now it\u2019s fun to see both of these teams we didn\u2019t necessarily expect to be playoff contenders come out of the gate as strong as they have. Sometimes you hope you are wrong when you pan a team ( like I did to the Magic in our season preview) . I believe the Pistons have more of what it takes to sustain a higher level of play this season, based mostly on personnel that fits the playoff profile. But I\u2019m anxious to see if the Magic, led by a couple of my favorite players (Aaron Gordon and Jonathan Simmons), can continue to defy the preseason expectations \u2014 or lack thereof. There\u2019s something about the \u201cno-one-believes-in-us\u201d attitude Orlando has that can fuel their fire in ways internal motivation simply cannot. * * * * * *"},{"id":43409,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nikola-mirotic-chicago-bulls-works-out-team-facility","date":"2017-11-01","title":"Nikola Mirotic works out at Chicago Bulls' practice facility","content":" The fallout from the Bobby Portis-Nikola Mirotic scuffle has yet to be fully realized for the Chicago Bulls.

Last season taught us to ignore (for the most part) the struggles of the regular-season Cleveland Cavaliers. But these Cavs are different than last season\u2019s Cavs, with three new rotation pieces \u2013 Derrick Rose, Dwyane Wade and Jeff Green \u2013 that don\u2019t necessarily fit well alongside LeBron James. It\u2019s fair to discount any losses the Cavs incur before April. It\u2019s also fair to wonder about Cleveland\u2019s ability to succeed while counting on those three guys. In the words of Sam Hinkie, every game is a data point. The Golden State Warriors have much more continuity than the Cavs, retaining the top eight guys from the team that went 16-1 in the postseason. So their three losses are easier to brush aside. But those three losses still make it impossible to put the champs at the top of the Power Rankings. The difficulty of putting the league\u2019s 30 teams in order goes well beyond that. Of the 30, 22 are no better than 4-2 and no worse than 2-4. Seven teams are 3-3, while one team\u2019s only win is another team\u2019s only loss. We\u2019ve got some serious parity early on and it might take some time before things out. Forgive us if these rankings look silly a month from now and, for now, focus on the team-by-team details, rather than the big picture. * * * Pace : Possessions per 48 minutes (League Rank) OffRtg : Points scored per 100 possessions (League Rank) DefRtg : Points allowed per 100 possessions (League Rank) NetRtg : Point differential per 100 possessions (League Rank) The league has averaged 101.2 possessions (per team) per 48 minutes and 103.4 points scored per 100 possessions this season. * * * NBA.com\u2019s Power Rankings, released every Monday during the season, are just one man\u2019s opinion.

My boys were smoking when we were kids and I never tried it. I was always so scared to try it. I felt like if I came home and I smelled like weed, my mother would kill me.\u201d But toward the end of a 16-year career that saw him go from \u201cBaby Al\u201d as a high school Draft pick (No. 25 overall) by Indiana in 1998 through seven NBA stops, Harrington was dealing with the same chronic knee and joint pain that follows just about every player who stays with it long enough. And he had a knee operation that led to a staph infection while playing for Denver in 2012 left Harrington in severe pain. The anti-inflammatories he\u2019d been taking regularly the previous seven and a half years weren\u2019t having much effect. Harrington then thought about trying medical marijuana. And, fortunately, he lived in a state that was one of the first to legalize use of marijuana for medicinal purposes. Colorado residents approved Amendment 20 in 2000 , which legalized medical marijuana use for patients who got explicit medical consent. Voters then passed Amendment 64 in November, 2012, which led to full legalization in 2014. Adults 21 and over could grow and possess limited amounts of marijuana for recreational use. \u201cI didn\u2019t have to do much research because I was in Denver when everything started to go legal,\u201d Harrington said. \u201cI\u2019m one of those guys that reads the paper the next day to see what they said about the team. And it was always in the paper, every single day. So I was always reading up on it, reading up on it.\u201d Harrington began using the medicinal form of the drugs, in creams that he rubbed on his knees, and drops. They didn\u2019t bring the high that smoking marijuana delivers. (Much more on that below.) But it brought Harrington relief. He says that after using anti-inflammatory pills for seven and a half years, he hasn\u2019t had to use one since. And it opened his eyes to the possibilities that medical marijuana could bring to people in pain. And after he retired in 2014 ( he did play in Ice Cube\u2019s Big3 league this past summer ), Harrington has gone into cannabis full-time, leading to the development of marijuana businesses in three states and a dream of being a major mogul in the still-burgeoning racket of legalized medical marijuana. His company is called Viola Extracts \u2014 Viola is Harrington\u2019s grandmother, and, as he describes it, his \u201cguinea pig\u201d in the struggle. When Viola Harrington\u2019s glaucoma was eased by using medical marijuana a couple of years ago, Al Harrington became a true believer. Now Viola Extracts is a one-stop grower, distributing and selling to more than 30 legal marijuana stores around the country. And Harrington now thinks medical marijuana should be available for use in another location \u2014 the NBA. And his view is now supported, publicly, by the unlikeliest of parties. \u201cI\u2019m now at the point where, personally, I think it probably should be removed from the banned list,\u201d former NBA Commissioner David Stern told Harrington in a segment for a piece on Harrington\u2019s new business that aired last week on Uninterrupted, the multimedia platform for athletes launched in 2015 by LeBron James. (Full disclosure: Turner Sports, which runs this website on which you\u2019ve stumbled, is an investor in Uninterrupted.) \u201cYou\u2019ve persuaded me,\u201d Stern told Harrington, after the two had met a couple of times earlier this year to discuss the pros and cons of medicinal marijuana. \u201c\u2026 If you told the fans that if the players rubbed it (marijuana creams) on their knees that they wouldn\u2019t take a night off, that would really send it over the top.\u201d Marijuana has been on the NBA\u2019s banned substances list since 1999 . A first positive test for marijuana requires enrollment in a treatment program, along with aftercare testing. A second positive test results in a $25,000 fine, and a third positive results in a five-game suspension, with each subsequent positive test thereafter adding five more games to the previous suspension; i.e., 10 games for a fourth positive test, 15 games for a fifth, etc. The NBA\u2019s Executive Vice President of Communications, Mike Bass, gave this statement to USA Today \u2019s Jeff Zilgitt last week: \u201cwhile (current NBA) commissioner (Adam) Silver has said that we are interested in better understanding the safety and efficacy of medical marijuana, our position remains unchanged regarding the use by current NBA players of marijuana for recreational purposes.\u201d Bass said last Thursday that this remains the NBA\u2019s official statement on Stern\u2019s comments. But Silver\u2019s position on medicinal marijuana is a little more nuanced. He said during a trip to Israel in August: \u201cI would say it\u2019s something we will look at. I\u2019m very interested in the science when it comes to medical marijuana. My personal view is that it should be regulated in the same way that other medications are if the plan is to use it for pain management. And it\u2019s something that needs to be discussed with our Players Association, but to the extent that science demonstrates that there are effective uses for medical reasons, we\u2019ll be open to it. Hopefully there\u2019s not as much pain involved in our sport as some others, so there\u2019s not as much need for it.\u201d Stern\u2019s shift dovetails with a decided move in public opinion toward increased legalization of marijuana. The NBA, after applying great public pressure, got the National Basketball Players Association to agree to add marijuana to the banned list in \u201999. Entering the post-Michael Jordan era (at least, that\u2019s what everyone thought at the time; Jordan had retired following the 1998 season, only to return to the court with the Wizards in 2001), the league had public perception and keeping its paying customers and sponsors happy on its mind. And after the arrests of several high-profile players for marijuana-related charges, the NBA made a marijuana ban a priority. There were also, sotto voce , players who were concerned about the prevalence of use among their brethren. But now, 29 states and the District of Columbia allow medical marijuana use . Those states are home to 18 of the NBA\u2019s 30 teams \u2014 the Phoenix Suns, Golden State Warriors, Los Angeles Lakers, LA Clippers, Sacramento Kings, Denver Nuggets, Miami Heat, Orlando Magic, Chicago Bulls, Boston Celtics, Detroit Pistons, Minnesota Timberwolves, New York Knicks, Brooklyn Nets, Cleveland Cavaliers, Portland Trail Blazers, Philadelphia 76ers and Washington Wizards. Eight states \u2014 Alaska, Colorado, California, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada, Oregon and Washington, along with D.C. \u2014 have legalized recreational use. And a Gallup Poll released just last week showed a record number of Americans \u2014 64 percent \u2014 now believe all marijuana use should be legal . That percentage is the highest in a Gallup survey since the company started polling on the issue in 1969. And the majority support cuts across party lines, with 72 percent of Democrats, 67 percent of Independents and 51 percent of Republicans supporting decriminalization. Warriors coach Steve Kerr said he tried medical marijuana last year to try and ease the chronic back pain he\u2019s suffered with for the past two years . Former Knicks president and Bulls coach Phil Jackson said on the CBS Sports Network program \u201cWe Need to Talk\u201d last year that he smoked marijuana in the 1970s while recovering from back surgery , but did not know if it had medicinal value or not. \u201cI think it was a distraction for me as much as a pain reliever,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve never thought of it as, ultimately, a pain medication for that type of situation. I know ocular things, stomach, digestive issues and other things, I think it\u2019s regarded quite highly.\u201d But it\u2019s high time (pun indented), Harrington believes, to get in on a business that generated an estimated $6.7 billion in revenue last year, and is projected to generate more than $20 billion in North America alone by 2021 . Harrington started in earnest in 2014, after providing plants for cancer patients and HIV patients in Colorado. By the time he applied for a license, he\u2019d discovered the Byzantine layers between states when it came to being a budding entrepreneur. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of different restrictions in each state,\u201d Harrington said. \u201cEach state is governed differently. Some have residency requirements. Some are trying to monopolize the whole process, where they talk about giving out only five licenses. Some states are equal opportunity. Every state is different and has different rules. But in Colorado, you had to be a resident. I was a resident because I was playing. But obviously I couldn\u2019t put it in my name because I didn\u2019t know how the NBA would even react to knowing I had a small piece of ownership in a marijuana company.\u201d Harrington\u2019s cousin, Dan, became the \u201cowner\u201d of the company, with Al Harrington the silent investor. Their company doesn\u2019t have much overhead. Though Harrington has hired a COO to get some of the day-to-day business off his plate, he and his cousin do a lot of the scut work throughout the process. \u201cWe\u2019re vertically integrated for the most part,\u201d he said. \u201cWe cultivate, manufacture, package, handle ourselves \u2026 I travel more than I did when I played in the league. I gambled on myself and I put everything on my own plate. I\u2019ve learned the industry. \u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of people that were interested in joining my operation and different things like that, but for me, being an entrepreneur and doing this for the first time, I wanted to learn everything on my own without other people influencing and different things like that. Even as far as raising money, I\u2019ve just gotten to the point in almost five years where I\u2019m comfortable raising money, because I know how exactly I can get everyone\u2019s money back. I know how to grow this business now.\u201d Harrington is not only a rarity in the medical marijuana because of his former day job, but because of his ethnicity. Though some states, including Michigan and Massachusetts, have tried to open up the marijuana marketplace for minority businesses , the vast majority of marijuana dispensaries in the United States are owned by whites . This is relevant for a simple reason: the overwhelming majority of people arrested for marijuana possession and\/or distribution are people of color , and have been for a generation . And, in most states, anyone who\u2019s ever been convicted of a drug felony is ineligible to work in marijuana stores or processing plants. Harrington had money, so he had access. But he knows that others have been shut out. He\u2019s a member of the Minority Cannabis Business Association , which seeks to increase minority representation among cannabis company owners, employees and investors, and educate minority populations about cannabis use. \u201cWhen you think of the social justice issues and the war on drugs, at the end of the day let\u2019s keep it all the way real \u2014 it\u2019s against black and brown,\u201d Harrington said. \u201cI tell people all the time, if you look at the black market, the black market, their biggest clientele is college campuses. And you never see no bust on college campuses. But you go to every project, every \u2018hood in America where there\u2019s black and brown, and you see all these busts. It\u2019s really messed up, because they block you out. If you have a felony, if you have a small felony charge as a kid, a dime bag of marijuana, you can\u2019t even work in the industry. If you have a felony, you can\u2019t get a job in the industry, let alone own a business. \u201cAnd then you look at some of the other things. At the end of the day, even with black people or minorities in general, we\u2019re very creative. I feel like we influence culture. What we do not have is access to capital. And these states are requiring you to, they\u2019re saying, okay, you can apply for a license, but as part of the licensing process, you have to show a million dollars of working capital in an account before we\u2019ll even look at your license or your application. It\u2019s just messed up. \u201cMy whole thing is, it should be an environment where you can allow them to apply for the application, then allow them the opportunity to go out and raise money, or give them some opportunities to be able to get some capital so they can take advantage of this opportunity. At the end of the day now this industry is being built on all the minorities\u2019 backs, and now this is a new industry. To keep it real, all the white people are trying to cash in on it.\u201d Harrington\u2019s company specializes in extraction, pulling the various parts of the marijuana plant out for use as waxes or oils. He believes in the part of the plant that produces the compound CBD \u2014 cannabidiol \u2014 which has anti-inflammatory benefits. Other cannabinoids with similar pain-relieving properties are CBN (cannabinol) and CBG (cannabigerol). \u201cTHC (tetrahydrocannabinol) is what gets everybody high,\u201d Harrington said. \u201cIt works with CBD. It\u2019s like a perfect combination where you can combine the two. But I also understand that some people don\u2019t want that high feeling. So when you use CBD, you don\u2019t feel anything when you take it; you just start to feel the relief of whatever you\u2019re dealing with.\u201d Harrington says he never tested positive for marijuana even though he was using both medical marijuana creams on his knees and taking between 25 and 50 milligrams of marijuana drops daily the last two years of his career. \u201cThe last year, when I was in Washington, I was almost hoping that I tested dirty because I wanted to be able to open it up to the program people and be like, look, this is what I\u2019m taking,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I took it all those times and I never tested dirty. I had even asked do they test for CBD and they said yes, and I promise you, I was taking it every single day, and I never tested dirty on one of my tests. And it didn\u2019t give me no advantages or anything like that; it just gave me the pain relief that I needed to be able to perform.\u201d Harrington says he\u2019s spoken with NBPA President Chris Paul on several occasions in recent months to see if the union is willing or ready to make a push toward easing the current substance ban to at least include medical marijuana use. But changing the current policy would not be that simple; potential Pandora\u2019s Boxes are strewn about. Even though the 29 states and D.C. have legalized medical marijuana use, it is still, technically, a violation of federal law \u2014 the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 , which does not differentiate between recreational and medical marijuana. The Drug Enforcement Administration still considers marijuana a \u201cSchedule 1\u201d drug, defined as such: So, even if the NBPA and league were to agree to allow medical marijuana use by players, no one knows for sure what would happen afterward. Could a player using medical marijuana that was approved by his team still be arrested under federal law? Would players thus be held to a higher standard than other people in those states? After cracking down on medical marijuana developers earlier in the Barack Obama presidency , the Obama Administration did an about face , saying in 2013 that it would not challenge laws legalizing marijuana in Colorado and Washington state, and generally wasn\u2019t interested in prosecuting people for simple possession. But the Trump Administration has taken a much harder line. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said last month that \u201cFederal law remains in effect\u201d with regard to marijuana use, and made clear that he is not a supporter of more progressive policies with regard to the drug. \u201cI\u2019ve never felt that we should legalize marijuana,\u201d Sessions said last month. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t strike me that the country would be better if it\u2019s being sold on every street corner. We do know that legalization results in greater use.\u201d There also isn\u2019t a monolithic point of view among players. There are, of course, many players who support its use, both recreationally and for medical purposes. Others don\u2019t support drug use under any circumstances (the \u201cmy body is my temple\u201d folks). Others wonder why the NBPA signed off on testing for marijuana while other sports league do not. And there are players who wonder why marijuana is banned in some states, yet legal in others. \u201cI think its fair to say we have to be mindful that given the current administration and Sessions\u2019 comments on his view, that it\u2019s a gateway drug, it wouldn\u2019t be prudent for any changes to be made until we know what the current DOJ has to say about this,\u201d NBPA Executive Director Michele Roberts said Sunday. \u201cThe other sports that aren\u2019t testing for marijuana like we are, I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re paying attention to today\u2019s DOJ. I want us to be aware of what the political agenda looks like.\u201d Harrington not only wants to grow and sell medical marijuana, he is an advocate of it as a \u201cclean\u201d drug compared with the painkillers developed in pharmaceutical labs. \u201cThere\u2019s clinical risk in every pain medication they give you,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they give you so much of it and (they\u2019re) so irresponsible. All these side effects. But when you look at marijuana, marijuana is a miracle drug. It heals \u2026 and I just want to get it out there. \u201cBecause like I said, I grew up with that mindset that it was just the worst thing in the world. But when you think about it, it came from God. It\u2019s a plant. There\u2019s no other drug that you can go outside, in your back yard, drop seeds and just let it grow. How is that a drug? Explain it to me. Why is that in the same classification as heroin and cocaine? That makes no sense to me.\u201d At the least, he\u2019d like to have it available for players who otherwise gobble anti-inflammatories by the handful. The shorthand has been well-known in NBA locker rooms for decades: Naprosyn, Celebrex, Vicodin, Orudis, Vioxx, Indocin and on and on. \u201cAll I\u2019m asking for is testing,\u201d Harrington said. \u201cCan we find out if this stuff really is as impactful, as a miracle drug, that most people, I feel, and most of the other patients feel about this? At this point, my mom is part of the Mother\u2019s Association. I\u2019m helping out like five, 10 moms right now with different things \u2014 knee replacements, things like that. And it\u2019s working.\u201d Stern \u2014 who was talking only about taking medical marijuana off the league\u2019s banned substances list, not making recreational use legal in the NBA \u2014 told Harrington in the Undefeated interview that he believed testing would begin in earnest once the world\u2019s major pharmaceutical companies figure out how they could monetize medical marijuana to their benefit. Harrington recalled a meeting a friend of his had with billionaire investor Warren Buffett; the friend wanted $850 million to start a movie studio. \u201cAnd Warren Buffett said, \u2018for our company, if it\u2019s not a $10 billion deal, we don\u2019t even look at it,\u2019 \u201d Harrington said. \u201cI think that\u2019s what\u2019s happening with Pharma. Pharma, of course, is going to take over \u2026 but it\u2019s not enough money (now) for them to waste their time. Once it gets to $50 billion, $100 billion, that\u2019s when they\u2019ll come in and buy all the established people. So that\u2019s why I firmly believe we have a five- or 10-year window to build our brand and build our businesses before Big Pharma comes in and the big money really starts coming in and they start buying people up.\u201d So Harrington has time to make his mark. He bought acres of land in Oregon in March, and just had his first harvest; his products will be on shelves out there by the end of this week. He\u2019s doing sales runs, meeting his sales teams and dispensary owners, and telling them his company\u2019s story. And he plans to keep working his former employer to change its mind. \u201cI think we\u2019re getting closer,\u201d Harrington said. \u201cWe are getting younger (NBA) owners. I personally feel a lot of those owners actually consumed, at different times, in different ways \u2014 edibles. I don\u2019t care. They can say what they want. I know what it is. Because we were NBA players, we\u2019re around a lot of bililionaires and some of the most successful people in the world, and when I talk to them about marijuana, the first thing they say is \u2018send me some.\u2019 \u201d * * * MORE MORNING TIP: DA\u2019s Top 15 rankings | Hawks embrace season of change | Morning Tip mailbag: How far can Pelicans go? * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

( And, hi, Olivia! Hi Kevin! ) \u201cWe\u2019re gonna try to squeeze it in there sometime soon,\u201d Kent Bazemore said Saturday. The Hawks\u2019 forward could go viral in the good old days \u2014 just two or three years ago \u2014 when Atlanta was a contender in the Eastern Conference, a feel-good collection of selfless players, coached to get better by Mike Budenholzer and his teaching-first staff. The ball moved and the 3-pointers were copious and the Hawks won 60 games in 2014-15, sending four of their five starters \u2014 Al Horford, Paul Millsap, Jeff Teague and Kyle Korver \u2014 to that year\u2019s All-Star Game. That was then. Now, the Hawks push cricket tacos.  The protein-rich delicacy is just one food offering this year\u2019s team is selling in Philips Arena, to try and keep fans happy while they watch a team that no longer has any of those All-Stars, restructured its front office last summer and has embraced a full rebuild under first-year General Manager Travis Schlenk \u2014 Schlenk taking over Budenholzer\u2019s duties at the request of Hawks\u2019 ownership. That new group, which bought the team at the height of its best play in \u201915 , watched the team\u2019s win total drop from 60 to 48 to 43 last season, which concluded with a first-round loss to the Washington Wizards . Barring an unexpected resurgence this season, Atlanta will be hard-pressed to get to 43 this season. Millsap is now with the Denver Nuggets. Horford is on the Boston Celtics. Teague, traded to Indiana in 2016, is now with the Minnesota Timberwolves and Korver is with the Cleveland Cavaliers. That leaves a handful of vets like Bazemore and point guard Dennis Schroeder, who were there for the good old days, and a bunch of kids learning on the job. Not too many Gazes are in the offing in the near future. \u201cFor me, I\u2019m a super fiery player,\u201d Bazemore said. \u201cI\u2019ve had to work on controlling my emotions. There\u2019s so many people watching, and thinking less of yourself in certain situations. Things are looking up. In every game we\u2019ve played this year in every form or fashion we\u2019ve given ourselves a chance. Beat Dallas, went down to Miami and had a chance to win there, Brooklyn the same, being up 18 on Charlotte on their opening night. \u201cWe\u2019ve shown glimpses of being a good team; it\u2019s not like we\u2019re going into these arenas and getting blown out by 50 every night.\u201d But, honestly, the losses are part of the plan this year. The worst thing you can be in the NBA is mediocre, and that\u2019s where the Hawks were. Majority owner Tony Ressler had to be convinced to let Millsap go, but he signed off on not re-signing Millsap, and then went all-in on Process South, replacing former GM Wes Wilcox in May \u2014 who remains with the franchise as a consultant \u2014 with Schlenk, who was the assistant GM with the Warriors the last five years. \u201cWell, we had two choices, the way I saw it,\u201d Ressler said Friday, in the new owners\u2019\/VIP digs, which are hard off the new Hawks Bar that is directly behind the baseline , steps off the floor \u2014 one of the many parts of the Philips renovation, which is scheduled to conclude next year.  \u201cWe never had the choice of being a contender. We weren\u2019t,\u201d Ressler said. \u201cI saw the team go from 60 wins to 48 to 43. And we didn\u2019t make many changes going from 60 to 48 to 43. We thought we made additions. Let\u2019s just say I concluded, with Travis\u2019 help, with Bud\u2019s help, I concluded that we were not going in the right direction. \u201cTruly, there are three options in the NBA, I would argue: being a contender, being a competitive team, and being young and fun. At least that would be my opinion. And we didn\u2019t have the option of being a contender. So we could be competitive, or more competitive, and maybe, shall we say, with a whole bunch of higher-priced vets that made us older and made our payroll less flexible, and made our future more cloudy.\u201d During an explosive summer of free agency and trades leaguewide, Schlenk worked along the margins, getting involved in deals that sent Dwight Howard to Charlotte for Miles Plumlee and Marco Belinelli ; working into the Danilo Gallinari trade with the Clippers and Nuggets by taking on Jamal Crawford from L.A. (the Hawks waived him shortly thereafter and he signed with the Wolves). But Schlenk also got a 2018 first-round pick from the Clippers in the deal, giving him three total in next year\u2019s Draft \u2014 Atlanta already has a Lottery-protected 2018 first-round pick from Minnesota \u2014 to add to the two 2019 first-rounders the Hawks have in hand. The Hawks gave former Spurs center Dewayne Dedmon a short deal (two years, $12 million, second year team option), but other than that, they\u2019re committed to building around their young guys: Schroeder, second-year wings Taurean Prince and DeAndre Bembry, and rookie big man John Collins. \u201cFor me, at least, I can\u2019t speak for other guys, but losing games, I just try to think we\u2019re playing with the best of the world every night,\u201d Collins said after the Hawks lost their sixth game in their first seven Sunday. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be easy. Nobody\u2019s going to give you anything.\u201d Collins carries the poker chips around for the team flights, and gets the Snickers on the late-night snack calls and tries to repeat the pattern of sudden improvement he showed from his freshman to his sophomore season at Wake Forest . Schlenk was, as he puts it, \u201cin NBA La-La Land\u201d at Golden State. Now, he can\u2019t just get lost going to games and getting ready for Drafts; he must sell the rebuilding vision in a city that was slow to warm to the Hawks, but embraced the \u201cTrue to Atlanta\u201d motto during the team\u2019s run to the Eastern Conference finals . \u201cThat\u2019s the hard part, with the fans,\u201d Schlenk said. \u201cI would say that 90 percent of the people I see in Atlanta, meet in Atlanta, say \u2018hey, love what you\u2019re doing, needs to be done.\u2019 There\u2019s another 10 percent of \u2018what are you doing?\u2019 But I think just as far as with Bud and the ownership group, it\u2019s just constantly reminding them, listen, it\u2019s painful right now. But there\u2019s light at the end of the tunnel. We have five Draft picks the next two years, first-round picks. It\u2019s my job to, hopefully, get four of those right.\u201d Budenholzer came to Atlanta from San Antonio in 2013 under former general manager Danny Ferry. After Ferry lost his job over racially insensitive remarks he made in a pre-Draft meeting in 2014 \u2014 with people subsequently taking sides all over the organization during what became an internal power struggle involving the team\u2019s previous majority owners \u2014 the power vacuum created led to Budenholzer gaining control over all the franchise\u2019s basketball decisions. But the devolving record and the new ownership group led by Ressler didn\u2019t give Budenholzer much chance to retain both jobs. \u201cI think Mike felt he was a great head coach,\u201d Ressler said. \u201cI tried to convince him and I think he realized fully that being the GM is a full-time job. So why does anyone on earth think they can do two extraordinarily difficult jobs? And I believe Bud saw that very clearly. And to this minute, I think what Bud wanted above everything else was a great GM who knew more about player personnel than he could or did. It\u2019s not a part-time job. And anyone who thinks it is, I think makes a big mistake. \u201cAnd being a great head coach that is extraordinary in player development, and where players literally \u2014 which is not that common \u2014 there are not that many ways to distinguish yourselves, to differentiate yourselves as a head coach in this league. But making players think they can come here to get better, I absolutely believe is one of those. But that\u2019s not a part-time (bleeping) job. That\u2019s a tough job. I think Bud, and I certainly had a strong view, as you might imagine, I said we need a great GM and we need a great head coach. I thought we had a great head coach. And I thought we had a GM that was not great, that was not experienced, who was not top dog. It\u2019s just two jobs.\u201d Budenholzer acknowledges it was \u201cnot easy\u201d to give up the VP job and its decision-making authority. But this is how the Hawks are organized now, and he\u2019s made his peace with it. \u201cIt\u2019s a change,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think that can be a positive, where either I have to think through things even more deeply and be more convicted or more capable of articulating why it is something is important to me and have everybody understand it. And there\u2019s going to be people who say \u2018I completely, totally disagree, and we\u2019re not going to do that.\u2019 And I\u2019ll grow from it, and hopefully the organization grows from it. But when you\u2019ve kind of been in that position and you do have passion and you do have vision, hopefully all for good, it\u2019s certainly going to be different. But it\u2019s a good different. It\u2019s a good change.\u201d Schlenk tread lightly the first few weeks after taking the GM job. He couldn\u2019t go my way or the highway. This was a proud group of guys who\u2019d done great work in making the Hawks a legit exciting team to watch for the first time in a long time. \u201cWe sat down, probably the first day I got the job here, we went to dinner \u2014 (Chief Executive Officer Steve) Koonin, (Chief Operating Officer) Thad Sheely and Bud and I all went to dinner,\u201d Schlenk said. \u201cAnd then the next day Bud and I sat down for three or four hours and just talked about different things. And really, I kind of knew in my mind what I wanted to do with this. \u201cAny time you come in, you kind of want to put your stamp on it. But he had been here and it was his stamp and he had emotional connections to all of these guys that I didn\u2019t have. So it took, I got hired first of June, end of May, But I would say it took two or three weeks of, I wasn\u2019t assertive at all. I would just sit back and have conversations. But we kind of channeled the conversations in the direction I wanted to. And he knew.\u201d A week before the Draft, Budenholzer went to Schlenk\u2019s office and told him he was all in. But, because coaches are still judged on their won-loss record, it was no shock that Budenholzer still argued for keeping Millsap, the Hawks\u2019 remaining All-Star and his best all-around player last season. \u201cAnd Tony (also) wants to win,\u201d Schlenk said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to go through this. But I would just constantly say, \u2018listen. You guys won (43) games. You want to win (43) games again?\u2019 I get this will be painful. Believe me, the first four games, I\u2019m sitting up there miserable.\u201d It leaves Budenholzer to focus on what has been the team\u2019s strength since he got there \u2014 a strength that gave former Hawks\u2019 assistant coach Kenny Atkinson a shot at the top job in Brooklyn \u2014 player development. It is a mantra of the coaches in Atlanta that everyone, no matter how long they\u2019ve been in the league, can get better. The proof, ironically, is in the deals that many former Hawks have gotten from other teams, from Millsap\u2019s big contract with Denver to Tim Hardaway, Jr.\u2019s $72 million deal with the New York Knicks. \u201cOrganizationally, this is the way we\u2019re organized now, and this gives us the best chance going forward to have a chance in Atlanta to have success,\u201d Budenholzer said. \u201cI\u2019m passionate about coaching. I love coaching. But I\u2019m passionate about everything. And I think, I believe in our ownership, I believe in all the changes we\u2019ve made and what we\u2019re doing going forward.\u201d The Hawks opened their new practice facility, the Emory Sports Medicine Complex , last week. The $50 million complex, about 15 minutes northeast of downtown, will house the front offices and medical staff, with space for a P3 facility in the building . Several players trained at the original P3 in California over the past few offseasons. The team is also building an arena in nearby College Park that will open in 2019-20 for its new G League team . For now, that team \u2013 the Erie Bayhawks \u2013 is playing in Pennsylvania this season and next.  Meanwhile, the $192.5 million renovation of Philips Arena will continue through the season. The lower concourse is being broken up, with the single wall of suites on one side of the building now being broken up. The 15 \u201cbunker suites\u201d and other seating that were state of the art when the building opened in 1999 have fallen victim to the times and the current state of the team. The Hawks plan to create \u201cfuture seating\u201d in their building \u2014 theatre seats, loge seats \u2014 they went to Las Vegas and found that pool events at casino hotels are now driving up to 20 percent of revenues there. There won\u2019t be pools at Philips. It\u2019s the thinking outside of the traditional game-presentation box that the Hawks hope will make games more than just about winning and losing. \u201cThis is entertainment,\u201d Koonin said. \u201cThe line between entertainment and sports is more blurred than it\u2019s ever been before. So we\u2019ve got Run the Jewels playing at halftime . We\u2019ve got every minute programmed, no different than HBO or TNT \u2026 and we\u2019re young. People understand. This is a town that understands, and craves a championship, and that there\u2019s a price to winning a championship. And sometimes you have to take a step back. We\u2019ve been in the playoffs for 10 years. We\u2019ve had a lot of success. We have not gotten our goal yet.\u201d A renovated Philips will be part of a renovated complex \u2014 \u201cit\u2019s not often that you have a 35-acre hole in the ground in downtown Atlanta,\u201d Ressler said that includes Philips Arena and the Falcons\u2019 new stadium, Mercedes-Benz Stadium \u2014 and will, everyone in the city seems to hope, sometime soon include \u201cThe Gulch,\u201d an undeveloped parcel of land that is chopped up by railroad tracks and looks as bad as the name sounds. But renovations, to be done well, must be done right the first time \u2014 measure twice, cut once, and all that. Ressler \u2014 in Riyadh and Abu Dhabi Thursday, Atlanta on Friday \u2014 has learned he must slow his own roll and accept the down year or two that awaits. \u201cWinning a championship, winning 60 games, would be great \u2014 and, actually, preferable,\u201d Ressler said. \u201cBut, to us, it\u2019s a package. The idea of building a practice facility and refurbishing the arena and sending a message to your fan base that you\u2019re trying to go in the right directions, I personally believe all are required. It\u2019s not one of the three. Frankly, what we\u2019ve learned is, if you just try to show people oh, we\u2019re redoing the arena and we\u2019re building the practice facility, and we\u2019re bringing the G League team in, but we\u2019re not focusing on both our payroll and the team on the court, you lose. \u201cSo, to me, you\u2019ve got to send a clear message: we\u2019re all of the above. And, we are \u2026 my wife (actress Jami Gertz) likes to say \u2018don\u2019t be so competitive.\u2019 Everything\u2019s competitive \u2026 but our view is, you\u2019ve got to send a message that the franchise is going in the right direction.\u201d * * * MORE MORNING TIP: Harrington finds new career in medical marijuana | DA\u2019s Top 15 rankings | Morning Tip mailbag: How far can Pelicans go?  * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

From Rumar Spencer : If you\u2019ve come to your conclusions honestly, Rumar, you\u2019re entitled to them. I do not believe that there is \u201cequal hate\u201d by black people toward white people; I think we\u2019re hated and discriminated against a lot more, and just about any metric you can name shows that. But, to your point: police officer deaths are indeed up this year over last year, and they were higher in 2016 than they were in 2015, according to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund. But the deaths from 2015-17 were lower than they were in 2010 and 2011, according to those same numbers . And FBI data shows that the number of police officers killed has actually dropped dramatically since 1970 \u2014 and that\u2019s while there are 250,000 more police officers on duty today than in 1980. Any death of a police officer in the line of duty is a tragedy and they shouldn\u2019t be reduced to numbers; they have families and friends and loved ones. Their deaths are awful and horrifying. But so is the death of an unarmed motorist , or a motorist who tells the police officer he has a gun in order to de-escalate the situation , or a kid playing by himself in a park , or a guy selling cigarettes on the street . We are all God\u2019s people. He doesn\u2019t want any of us to kill each other, whether we\u2019re civilians or wearing a uniform. Cory is perturbed. From Cory Morton: Pretty sure we can round up a few dozen folks in Vegas who\u2019d disagree with your conference finals prediction, Cory. But love the passion. Boogie and the Brow have been great together, though, and credit to Alvin Gentry and his staff for figuring out ways the two of them can play off of each other by allowing both guys to embrace the three and let it fly. Did they ever figure out who killed that Palmer girl? From Simon Dingwall: A heck of a question, Simon. Thanks for it. I wish I had time to construct a histogram for this year; maybe one of our great readers with some time could put it together. My guess \u2014 and it\u2019s a guess, Simon; I\u2019m no expert on histograms or how to construct them \u2014 is that if it was a twin peaks chart as shown here , the peaks would not be rookie deals\/max deals, but rookie deals\/veteran minimum deals. I say that because while almost every player who enters the NBA does so on a rookie contract \u2014 creating the single, isolated peak \u2014 only few players by comparison get a max or near max. The most max or near-max deals you\u2019ll ever see on one team at one time is three \u2014 think Miami in 2010 with LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh \u2014 or Washington this season with John Wall, Bradley Beal and Otto Porter Jr.. And many teams only have two. By contrast, most every team has at least 2-4 vets on minimum deals them in a given season, and at least a couple of teams a year have half or near half of their squad playing for the minimum.

(Last week\u2019s averages in parenthesis) 1) Giannis Antetokounmpo (33 ppg, 11.7 rpg, 6 apg, .587 FG, .762 FT): Just watching him gobble up space in transition is\u2026indescribable. Or at least not describable adequately. 2) James Harden (24 ppg, 5.5 rpg, 10 apg, .427 FG, .786 FT): The Trade was five years ago last week. 3) LeBron James (27 ppg, 5 rpg, 11.3 apg, .608 FG, .684 FT): Became the franchise\u2019s all-time leader in games played Wednesday with his 772nd appearance for the Cavs, passing Zydrunas Ilgauskas for number one on Cleveland\u2019s list. 4) DeMarcus Cousins (34.3 ppg, 16 rpg, 6.3 apg, .544 FG, .794 FT): Per Elias, Cousins joined Wilt, Oscar and Elgin Baylor as the only players in NBA history to follow up a 40-point, 20-rebound game with a triple double in his next game. Cousins posted his seventh career triple double (23, 12 and 10) in the Pelicans\u2019 rout of Cleveland Saturday. 5) Kevin Durant (28.3 ppg, 7.3 rpg, 4.3 apg, .565 FG, .840 FT):  We\u2019ve all been there, KD. \u2018Preciate it. Dropped out: Anthony Davis, John Wall 280 \u2014 Consecutive sellouts at Staples Center by the Clippers, a streak that ended last Tuesday in L.A.\u2019s game against Utah. To be fair, the game was played while Game 1 of the World Series in Los Angeles, just up the 101 at Dodger Stadium, was in progress. 7 \u2014 Consecutive wins by the Pelicans at home against Cleveland, dating back to March, 2010, after New Orleans routed the Cavs Saturday night behind DeMarcus Cousins\u2019s triple double \u2014 making the current score Beignets, French Quarter and Emeril\u2019s 3,498,072-road team du jour 31. 2 \u2014 Previous times in the last five seasons that the Magic has won more than three games in a row. Orlando had a chance at a fourth straight win Sunday but lost to Charlotte. Nonetheless, at 4-2, the Magic is off to its best start since beginning the 2011-12 season with a 4-1 mark. 1) Watched Joel Embiid\u2019s drop step in the last minute of a tight game on the road with the Mavericks Saturday night. Sometimes, you see a guy do something \u2014 like Bird following up his own miss on the baseline, or Jordan going between his legs before pulling up en route to 63 in the Garden in the playoffs \u2014 and you know that the guy is going to be something different and someone special. Had that feeling Saturday night. 2) We are two weeks into the season, and the Bulls are not going to be good \u2014 and they have all kinds of off-court drama that doesn\u2019t seem to ever end. But, hopefully, people now see that the Chicago didn\u2019t get robbed when they traded Jimmy Butler to the Wolves for a package of players and picks; that deal netted them the rights to rookie Lauri Markkanen, who is showing that he has the potential to be a very capable scorer and decent rebounder down the road. 3) I love that Malika Andrews, the brilliant young reporter\/writer for the New York Times, was talking to Alvin Gentry for her Pelicans piece just when Gentry\u2019s phone rang with a call from Jameer Nelson , whom New Orleans wound up signing last week. Great detail. 4) Okay, now you\u2019re just showing off . But, you should be showing off. That\u2019s incredibly cool. 1) Of course Cleveland will play better defense in May and June. Doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s enjoyable to watch the Cavs not guarding anyone now. 2) I don\u2019t like hearing \u201cout indefinitely\u201d  with anyone associated with DeMatha Catholic High School . 3) We\u2019ll miss you, Brother Fox . Good luck wherever the winds take you! 4) From the people who brought you New Coke! 5) Yuli Gurriel got suspended five games to start next season by Major League Baseball for his racist gesture toward Dodgers pitcher Yu Darvish. Yuli Gurriel should have been suspended for Game 4 of the World Series by his own team, the Astros. Houston had a chance to send an unmistakable message: winning can\u2019t come at the expense of integrity, no matter when we\u2019re playing. It chose to let MLB carry the water, and MLB chose to kick the can down the road. Weak. \u2014 DeAndre Jordan ( @DeAndre ), Friday, 2:51 p.m., responding to the apology of Houston Texans owner Bob McNair for comments he made during an NFL owners meeting earlier this month that \u201cwe can\u2019t have the inmates running the prison\u201d \u2014 in reference to NFL players who have knelt during the playing of the national anthem before games to protest police brutality. Hassan Whiteside Retweeted Joel Embiid \u201cHe said he was at a hair salon \u2026 I didn\u2019t believe that to be true.\u201d \u2014 Suns GM Ryan McDonough , to local reporters , explaining why the Suns sent disgruntled guard Eric Bledsoe home while they tried to work out a trade for him. Bledsoe tweeted on Oct. 22 \u2018I Don\u2019t wanna be here\u2019 just before Phoenix announced it was firing former coach Earl Watson. Later, Bledsoe claimed he was at a hair salon and the \u201chere\u201d referred to that, setting him up for some meme love . \u201c You know what, hey, people talk about his dad all the time. Hey, I mean, my father left me at two. I would love to have my father around like [LaVar] is around and talk to him and pump me up with confidence. To me, that\u2019s every son\u2019s dream. And for some reason he gets criticized. No question, he\u2019s a little ambitious at times [with] what he says. But he\u2019s around his son. I have no problem with that. And maybe he could temper it a little bit, but I would\u2019ve loved to have my father do that.\u201d \u2014 Wizards coach Scott Brooks , to Candace Buckner of The Washington Post , on what he thinks of LaVar Ball and his advocacy on behalf of his son, Lonzo, the Lakers\u2019 rookie point guard. \u201cListen, we\u2019re all men. Stop me from dunking. We\u2019re not trying to hurt nobody. Trying to play hard until the final buzzer. Would it have been OK if he had laid the ball up? Get mad because he threw it off the glass and caught it? Would he have been mad if he threw it off the glass and missed it? There wouldn\u2019t have been no conversation. So, you play the game until it\u2019s over. Yeah he threw it off the glass, dunked it, so what?\u201d \u2014 LeBron James , talking about Warriors rookie Jordan Bell\u2019s alley-oop to himself off the glass late in Golden State\u2019s rout over Dallas Monday \u2014 viewed by some as rubbing it in the Mavericks\u2019 faces long after the game had been decided. * * * MORE MORNING TIP: Harrington finds new career in medical marijuana | DA\u2019s Top 15 rankings | Hawks embrace season of change * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

Just ask mid-90s Magic fans, turn-of-the-century Kings faithful, or witnesses of Seven Seconds or Less in Phoenix. You can lump Grizzlies fans of the 2010s into that group, because it\u2019s hard to find a stronger local connection than the one that exists between Memphis and its NBA franchise of recent years. The team and its city take pride in \u201cGrit and Grind,\u201d a brand of basketball that wasn\u2019t always pretty, but effective enough to earn seven straight postseason trips and a trio of 50-win seasons. They rallied behind an underrated cast headlined by a non-All-Star point guard ( Mike Conley ), castoff forward (Zach Randolph) and late-blooming center ( Marc Gasol ). That era appeared to be in danger after the 2017 offseason , when the Grizzlies bid farewell to Randolph. It was hard to imagine \u201cGrit and Grind\u201d without the fan favorite forward, who bulldozed his way to 16.8 points and 1.0 2 rebounds per game in his eight seasons with Memphis. Ditto for the loss of Tony Allen, a limited-but-beloved guard who made life miserable for elite scorers. Fast forward to Day 12 of the 2017-18 regular season, and the Grizzlies are sitting pretty at 5-1. It\u2019s their best start to a season since 2014-15 \u2014 the same year Memphis advanced all the way to the Western Conference finals. The faces have changed. The identity has not. Memphis\u2019s stubborn refusal to fade was on full display against Houston on Saturday night. Facing the ultimate example of run-and-gun basketball, the Grizzlies doubled down on their own style and showed why they still have a place at the Western Conference table. They limited the Rockets to 89 points on 37.7-percent shooting, well below their early-season marks of 106.3 points per game at a 45.1-percent clip. After their 103-98 victory , the supposedly endangered Grizzlies now sport the best record (5-1) in the league. The cast of characters is different, but the formula remains the same. Entering Saturday night\u2019s game, Memphis ranked eighth in defensive rating at 98.3 points allowed per 100 possessions, which would be their best mark since 2012-13. They have compensated for Randolph\u2019s absence partly through Gasol (25.0 ppg, 10.8 rpg) and partly through a committee of energetic role players. Tyreke Evans will never fulfill the promise he showed in his Kia Rookie of the Year campaign, but he gives the Grizzlies an extra playmaker who rebounds extremely well for a perimeter player. James Ennis III and Jarell Martin provide energy and more rebounding at the forward spots. Mario Chalmers adds a much-needed dash of passing and shooting. They might be even better if Chandler Parsons can build on his long awaited coming-out party on Saturday. The seventh-year forward, who played just 34 games last season, poured in 24 points on 9-of-11 shooting in 19 minutes. Without that, the Grizzlies likely don\u2019t survive a rare off-night from both Gasol and Conley (14 points, 5-of-18 FG combined). When healthy, Parsons gives Memphis the third scorer it needs to complement the Gasol-Conley duo. Without him, Gasol\u2019s admirably crafted 3-point stroke (43.5 percent) is the lone outside threat opponents consistently respect. Even so, the Grizzlies aren\u2019t fretting about offensive flaws when its strengths \u2014 defense and execution \u2014 can carry the day if everyone buys in. So far, they are. Memphis is yielding the fewest points off turnovers per game (12.6) and the second-fewest points in the paint (37.6). In short, the Grizzlies are gritting and grinding their way to wins \u2014 just like they always have."},{"id":43475,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/utah-jazz-rookie-donovan-mitchell-throws-down-epic-putback-dunk","date":"2017-10-29","title":"Utah Jazz rookie Donovan Mitchell soars over Los Angeles Lakers' Lonzo Ball for epic putback slam","content":"This is what Jazz fans were hoping for when Utah drafted Donovan Mitchell with the 13th pick in the 2017 NBA Draft.

Again, it\u2019s still ridiculously early \u2014 just two weeks into the season, at a point in the calendar when the NBA is typically just starting. But through five games, the Magic have served emphatic notice that they could be much greater than the sum of their individual parts. They\u2019ve been particularly impressive on the offensive end, ranking among the league leaders in an array of categories entering Friday\u2019s game including points per 100 possessions ( second ), 3-point shooting ( first ), assist ratio ( second ) and pace ( fourth ).  \u201cWe\u2019re starting to play offensively consistently the right way in terms of not settling and understanding that we want to attack early and the ball is really hopping,\u201d Orlando coach Frank Vogel told Magic.com last week. \u201cWe\u2019re scoring the ball well and shooting the ball well as a result of the ball movement and the quality of our shots.\u201d If those words sounds strange coming from a coach who emphasized defense and physicality in his previous stint with the Pacers, they shouldn\u2019t. Vogel expressed a \u201cgreat desire\u201d to play up-tempo basketball on his first day on the job in 2016. It took them a season to get there, but the Magic are making up for lost time. They shredded the Spurs\u2019 fourth-ranked defense on Friday, shooting 57.1 percent with 11 3s. The key players in their early season success \u2014 Evan Fournier, Aaron Gordon and Nikola Vucevic \u2014 combined for 56 points on 23-for-32 shooting, and Jonathon Simmons scored 17 in 23 minutes off the bench against his old team. All told, it was the kind of clinic the Spurs have been conducting for years.  \u201cIt\u2019s too early to make any big judgments,\u201d Vogel said after the Magic\u2019s third game, and it still applies following their fifth. \u201cBut it\u2019s an early positive sign for us. Everybody is playing basketball the right way, thinking extra pass and playing for each other. That\u2019s how chemistry is established.\u201d And perhaps, a few months down the road, an end to Orlando\u2019s lengthy postseason drought.

The franchise is being valued at $2.3 billion under terms of the agreement, the person told The Associated Press. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because there were no public comments about the sale, which must be approved by the NBA\u2019s Board of Governors. Tsai is the co-founder and executive vice president of the Alibaba Group, a Chinese e-commerce company. Born in Taiwan, he is a graduate of Yale. He also owns the San Diego entry in the National Lacrosse League. He\u2019s the latest to pay a huge price for an NBA team. Tilman Fertitta paid a record $2.2 billion last month to purchase the Houston Rockets, surpassing the $2 billion that Steve Ballmer paid for the Los Angeles Clippers. The deal was first reported by ESPN. Prokhorov bought the team in 2010 and oversaw its move from New Jersey to Brooklyn. The Russian billionaire has been an infrequent spectator in recent years as the Nets tumbled from playoff team to worst record in the league, and he has for a while been open to selling a minority share. Instead, he will eventually become the minority owner, retaining 20 percent of the franchise after Tsai takes control in 2021. The deal is for the franchise only and not Barclays Center, the $1 billion arena that opened in 2012.

By exercising their options, all players will be under contract with the Bulls for the 2018-19 season. The Bulls acquired Dunn in a Draft-night trade with the Minnesota Timberwolves last offseason in which Dunn, Zach LaVine and the rights to Lauri Markkanen were exchanged for Jimmy Butler and the draft rights to Justin Patton. In his rookie year with the Timberwolves, Dunn played in 78 games (7 starts) and averaged 3.8 points, 2.1 rebounds and 2.4 assists. He ranked sixth among rookies in assists, second in steals and fourth in blocks. Dunn has missed the start of the 2017-18 season while rehabbing the dislocation of his left index finger. Valentine was selected 14th overall by Chicago in the 2016 NBA Draft. The Michigan State product saw time in 57 games and averaged 5.1 points, 2.6 rebounds and 1.1 assists per game his rookie year. Valentine hit at least one 3-pointer in 15 consecutive games from March 8 to April 4, and hit multiple 3-pointers in seven games in a row from March 8 to 18, both of which were the longest such streaks on the team last season. He scored a career-high 19 points with five 3-pointers made at Washington on Jan. 10. This season, Valentine is averaging 10.0 points, 5.0 rebounds and 1.3 assists through four games. Grant has played in 67 games for the Bulls after completing his rookie year with the New York Knicks (76 games). He was acquired by the Bulls, along with Jose Calderon and Robin Lopez, in a trade for Derrick Rose, Justin Holiday and a 2017 second-round pick on June 22, 2016. Grant has career averages of 5.9 points, 1.9 rebounds and 2.3 rebounds per game, but through four games (4 starts) this season is averaging 10.8 points, 4.0 rebounds and 7.3 assists. He has posted his first two career double-doubles in his last six regular season games: April 10, 2017, and Oct. 24, 2017. Payne was traded to Chicago on Feb. 23, 2017, along with Joffrey Lauvergne and Anthony Morrow, for Taj Gibson, Doug McDermott and a 2018 second round draft pick. The former Mr. Basketball in Tennessee has career averages of 5.0 points, 1.5 rebounds and 1.9 assists through 88 games. He only appeared in 31 games in 2016-17, missing time due to a right foot injury, but in the 10 games he played with the Bulls, Payne averaged 4.9 points, 1.5 rebounds and 1.4 assists in 12.9 minutes. He has not played in 2017-18 while recovering from offseason surgery on his right foot. Selected by the Bulls 22nd-overall in the 2015 NBA Draft, Portis has appeared in 126 games (17 starts) with career averages of 6.9 points and 5.0 rebounds. He was the 25th player in Bulls history to have a double-digit scoring career debut (10 points in 10 minutes at Charlotte on Nov. 3), and was the first Bull to post a double-double with 20 points and 11 boards in one of his first five career games since Elton Brand in 1999 (at New York on Dec. 19).

There\u2019s the macro purpose of winning games, entertaining fans and making the playoffs. Then there\u2019s the micro purpose that actually might wind up being more instrumental to the Bucks\u2019 long-term fortunes and ambitions. That is, the ongoing development of Giannis Antetokounmpo as Milwaukee\u2019s cornerstone player and the NBA\u2019s Unicorn Flavor of the Month. Antetokounmpo is the real deal and has been for a while. When the franchise\u2019s sparkling new facility opens next fall \u2014 two blocks and a world away from the old Milwaukee Arena they dusted off for their throwback Thursday game against the Celtics \u2014 it rightly will begin its useful life as the House That Giannis Built. Antetokounmpo\u2019s remarkable start to the 2017-18 schedule has people chronicling his achievements and taking his pulse after every game. Yes, he leads the Bucks in minutes, points, rebounds, assists, steals, player efficiency rating (an astounding 37.3) and usage rate (34.8 percent). And yes, no Milwaukee player ever has scored more through the first five games of a season; Antetokounmpo\u2019s 175 points moved him past Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who opened 1970-71 with 171 through five performances (before adding 81 more in the next two games). It\u2019s a tough way to go through a season, though, with folks monitoring his every move and running the math every time Antetokounmpo posts his crooked numbers. At some point he will fall off his record-setting pace for this, that or the other thing. The Bucks will have doubled or tripled the sample size \u2014 five games represents a mere 6.1 percent of their schedule \u2014 and everyone can get busy with the short check list that really will define his and his team\u2019s success. 1. Did Milwaukee win? 2. Did Antetokounmpo finish the game healthy? 3. How did this opponent defend against and\/or attack him? Antetokounmpo knows that his status as an All-Star, Kia MVP candidate or future Mt. Rushmore figure depends first and foremost on No. 1. He\u2019ll only max out his individual potential if he can make sure the Bucks max out theirs. No. 2 is essential, too, particularly for a team that has dealt with multiple injuries in recent seasons, most notably Khris Middleton\u2019s torn hamstring a year ago and Jabari Parker\u2019s serial ACL blowouts . Hardly anyone gets out of The Association unscathed, but let\u2019s hope for our own curious and selfish sake that the \u201cGreek Freak\u201d stays closer to LeBron James-and Kevin Garnett-healthy for most of his career.As for No. 3, that\u2019s straight basketball business and it was on display against Boston Thursday . The Celtics already had suffered at Antetokounmpo\u2019s hand in their home opener last week when he notched 37 points and 13 rebounds in Milwaukee\u2019s 108-100 victory . But then, that was the tail end of a back-to-back after they started in Cleveland 24 hours earlier \u2014 and Boston still was rattled from the sudden loss of free agent All-Star Gordon Hayward\u2019s services for the season. This time, the Celtics had time and focus to prep, and coach Brad Stevens changed up one specific matchup: Instead of having forward Jaylen Brown guard Antetokounmpo, he gave that chore to big man Al Horford. With the 6-foot-10, 240-pound Horford crowding Antetokounmpo and with various Boston helpers bumping or running at him, the Bucks\u2019 young star had a far more disjointed experience on his way to 28 points, 10 rebounds and seven assists. Horford met Antetokounmpo on the stats sheet, too, with 27 points, nine boards and four assists \u2014 and stayed close while teammates filled the lane to take away Antetokounmpo\u2019s space. \u201cTeams know he wants to get to the paint, teams know that\u2019s where he\u2019s most effective,\u201d Milwaukee point guard Malcolm Brogdon said. \u201cWhether it\u2019s finishing or finding guys, he touches the paint first. So they\u2019re bringing five guys in and forcing him to pass it or forcing him to take contested shots.\u201d Compared to the Bucks\u2019 first game against Boston, when they got to the foul line 30 times, they earned only 14 this time. As specific to Thursday\u2019s game as this might seem a day later, it really serves as an example of what Antetokounmpo and his guys will face over the next 77 games. In this era of three (or more) All-Star caliber teammates on the top contenders, the \u201cGreek Freak\u201d is the proverbial head-of-the-snake type for Milwaukee. He has had only limited help through the season\u2019s first two weeks. Middleton, the Bucks\u2019 best shooter and second-most talented player, is an inexplicable 3-for-19 on 3-pointers. Besides him (15.2 ppg), Brogdon (15.8) and Tony Snell (11.0), no one else is averaging more than 6.8 points, five rebounds or 3.2 field goal attempts. \u201cYou could tell night to night the other defenders pay more attention to me,\u201d Antetokoumpo said. \u201cYou can see from the start that everybody loads and they close gaps so I don\u2019t have a lot of room to go. I know moving forward that\u2019s going to happen. I just got to stay disciplined and trust our offense, try to move the ball and I know the ball is going to find me back.\u201d Antetokounmpo and Brogdon agreed that the other Bucks can help him most by hitting shots when the point forward\u2019s passes find them. There\u2019s no better way to drag defenders off him. The other imperative for Milwaukee is to lighten Antetokounmpo\u2019s load overall. It\u2019s not just his overall court time \u2014 a league high 39.2 minutes nightly \u2014 but the grind in each of those minutes. Gutting out five games is one thing; pushing through the next 77 or so at his current level is asking for burnout. \u201cWe have to make sure he doesn\u2019t have to work that hard to get his shots,\u201d Brogdon said Thursday night. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t need to drive inside every time. We need to drive inside for him sometimes to get him easy shots. \u201cHe\u2019s worked hard. That\u2019s sort of his style of play. But as the season goes on, there are going to be games where he\u2019s a little bit tired. Those are the games where we\u2019ll need to work hard to get him the easy shots.\u201d No one has seen Antetokounmpo tucker out yet. Before exiting the cramped, home-locker-room-for-a-night at the MECCA, he chugged some sort of healthy energy drink, wrinkled up his face at the taste, then looked fresh heading into the Milwaukee chill. Then again, there\u2019s only one Energizer bunny in the NBA and he still plays in Oklahoma City. \u201cI think Giannis is next in line in terms of guys who have that type of motor,\u201d Brogdon said, \u201cbut it\u2019s tough to play that way every night.\u201d Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Although Cousins was never able to lead Sacramento to the postseason, he surely reminded them of the talent that made them believe he might do so one day, dropping in 41 points, 23 rebounds and six assists in 44 minutes . The performance was Cousins\u2019 first 40-point, 20-rebound game and a needed one as his All-Star teammate, Anthony Davis, missed the game with a left knee injury . That left Cousins lifting double-duty against the team he had tried to lift on his own back for the first six-and-a-half seasons of his career. Did the dramatic setting of his return to Sacramento, along with the weight he would carry without Davis, make him emotional? \u201cI tried to tune everything out, honestly,\u201d Cousins told reporters after the game. \u201cI was good after the jump ball. Before that, I just wanted to hurry up and get the process over.\u201d More important than Cousins\u2019 triumphant return was the win that it produced, pushing the Pelicans to 2-3. New Orleans hasn\u2019t started a season that well since 2014-15 \u2014 the last time the Pelicans made the playoffs. NBA fans, executives and observers are fascinated to see if the Davis-Cousins pairing can work. They want to see if Cousins can be a key piece on a winning team. They may only have this season to find out, as Cousins is an unrestricted free agent next summer. Odds are good at least one team will open up its wallet to the max to obtain (or keep) Cousins\u2019 immense talent, regardless of the lack of victories that have accompanied it. For now, however, the polarizing big man seems at peace with the here and now, which included a historic night and a much-needed win for his current team. \u201cWe\u2019re a team with no excuses,\u201d Cousins said. \u201cWe think we can battle with the best of them.\u201d"},{"id":48711,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/horry-scale-blake-griffins-3-pointer-buries-blazers","date":"2017-10-27","title":"Horry Scale: Blake Griffin's 3-pointer buries Blazers","content":"A reminder on The Horry Scale: It breaks down a game-winning buzzer-beater (GWBB) in the categories of difficulty, game situation (was the team tied or behind at the time?), importance (playoff game or garden-variety night in November?) and celebration. Then we give it an overall grade on a scale of 1-5 Robert Horrys, named for the patron saint of last-second answered prayers. * * * There are two undefeated teams remaining 10 days into the regular season. One is the Kawhi Leonard-less San Antonio Spurs. The other is the remodeled LA Clippers, thanks to Blake Griffin\u2019s buzzer-beating heroics on Thursday night. The eighth-year forward sank a 3-pointer from the left side as time expired to bump the Clippers to 4-0 to start 2017-18 . The dramatic victory came at the expense of the Portland Trail Blazers, who were 3-1 entering last night\u2019s game. C.J. McCollum appeared to have given his team the final edge with a go-ahead jumper and a free throw in the final minute, but Griffin trumped that with the 3-pointer that proved to be the difference. DIFFICULTY: Griffin said the final play was designed for him to attack the basket, but that Portland\u2019s defense negated that option. Instead, he was forced to navigate all the way around teammate Patrick Beverley, using him as a casual screen to create space for the sliver of time he needed. Even then, Griffin felt compelled to give a pump fake, but Al-Farouq Aminu still contested the shot well from Griffin\u2019s right side. Shooting from distance after a momentum-killing pump fake is not easy, but Griffin\u2019s shot was pure proof of how much work the former Slam Dunk Contest champion has put into his outside shot. GAME SITUATION: The Clippers faced quite the letdown after leading by as many as 10 points in the second half. Griffin was the reason Los Angeles survived Portland\u2019s comeback attempt, as he scored 16 of his game-high 25 points in the fourth quarter . Still, McCollum\u2019s final three points had the Blazers poised for a two-point victory, which would have been especially frustrating after how hotly contested the final few possessions were. Clippers guard Austin Rivers dislocated his finger on the previous possession and earned an offensive foul in the process, forcing Los Angeles to foul McCollum. Luckily for the Clippers, the 92-percent free throw shooter missed one of his two free throws, leaving Griffin the chance to put the game away in regulation. CELEBRATION: Griffin defiantly ran the opposite direction and into his jubilant teammates, who mock-restrained him as he marched about in the now-silenced Moda Center. If there was ever a scene that depicted Griffin\u2019s place as the undisputed star of the LA Clippers, this was it. GRADE: Every win is big in the Western Conference, where good teams run the risk of not being good enough. Thanks to Griffin, the Clippers have an early lead in that race. Many wondered how Los Angeles would perform after trading Chris Paul to Houston. Griffin\u2019s emphatic answer on Thursday night: pretty darn good. Three-and-a-half Horrys.

Warriors spokesman Raymond Ridder said Thursday that the beloved Attles, who turns 81 on Nov. 7, is doing fine and will return to Oracle Arena as soon as he can in the near future. Details of his condition were not disclosed, the team said. The Warriors will continue with their plans to honor him during Friday\u2019s home game against the Washington Wizards. Attles bobblehead dolls will be a giveaway and players will wear shooting shirts featuring his likeness. He is a longtime staple at games with a regular seat on press row high above the court in Oracle Arena, though Attles missed a stretch of time last season when he was not well. He returned to see Golden State win the franchise\u2019s second championship in three years against Cleveland. Attles is in his 58th year with the Warriors, having played in Wilt Chamberlain\u2019s 100-point game on March 2, 1962 . He coached the Warriors to the 1975 title, then watched as Stephen Curry and Co. won 40 years later in 2015. Attles scored 17 points on 8-for-8 shooting for the Philadelphia Warriors during Chamberlain\u2019s 100-point performance. Attles coached Rick Barry the day he scored 64 against Portland on March 26, 1974. He then loved witnessing Klay Thompson score a career-best 60 points in three quarters in a 142-106 victory over Indiana last December \u2013 the highest Warriors scoring performance since Barry\u2019s.

Except in place of the aging basketball stars of yesteryear, this one will feature the chilly drafts, creaking hinges and narrow concourses of a long-retired NBA arena spiffed up for one last game. And one lasting stroll down memory lane. When the Milwaukee Bucks play host to the Boston Celtics on Thursday, they\u2019ll take #TBT to a whole new level. Rather than staging the game at their usual venue, the BMO Harris Bradley Center, the Bucks will clash with their fellow Eastern Conference wannabes at the old Milwaukee Arena, which later became known nationally (for a colorful reason to be explored below) as \u201cthe MECCA.\u201d The Bucks played in that building for 20 years, from their inception in 1968-69 through the 1987-88 season. A $10 million, barrel-roofed state-of-the-art facility when it opened in 1950, where the Milwaukee Hawks (before moving to St. Louis and eventually Atlanta) were the first NBA tenants for four seasons through 1954-55, the Arena over the past three decades became the home of the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee Panthers and the Milwaukee Admirals of the American Hockey League . But because Milwaukee seems to only add downtown sports facilities without subtracting any \u2013 the Arena sits immediately to the south of the Bradley Center , which sits immediately to the south of the new, $524 million facility set to open for the Bucks\u2019 2018-19 season \u2013 this one was available when ideas got tossed around for commemorating the current franchise\u2019s 50th season. \u201cWe started talking about the possibility of doing a game there probably three or four years ago,\u201d said Dustin Godsey, the Bucks\u2019 chief marketing officer. \u201cWe\u2019d heard repeatedly as we started looking at a new building so much from fans about what it was like to see a game there. \u201cWe were digging into opportunities to celebrate and this became kind of a no-brainer to us to see if it was possible.\u201d The NBA had to sign off on the idea, of course, because this isn\u2019t 1968 or even \u201888. The Celtics hardly are a mundane opponent, but the Bucks\u2019 season-ticket base of approximately 7,500 meant that the team\u2019s most valued customers could be accommodated in the old arena. It boasts a capacity now of 12,700 compared to the familiar 10,938 figure that meant \u201csellout\u201d when the Bucks and the Marquette University Golden Eagles (then known as the Warriors) called MECCA it home. * Photo gallery:  Iconic MECCA court returns to Milwaukee Arena But there\u2019s still no upper bowl of seating. Locker rooms and concession stands have been updated since the \u201880s, yet it undeniably is an old arena, with all the expected limitations and charm. \u201cIt\u2019s fun for me \u2014 I\u2019m not originally from Milwaukee \u2014 just to see thee fans get excited and relive those great teams and memories,\u201d Godsey said. \u201cThere are so many people who heard from their parents about going to games at MECCA or were kids 30 years ago. For them now to be able to say, \u2018My dad took me and these were the seats we sat in,\u2019 and to be able to take their kids, that\u2019s going to be really special.\u201d Bob Pettit, the Hall of Fame power forward , played his Rookie of the Year season at the Milwaukee Arena in 1954-55 before moving with the Hawks to St. Louis and winning MVPs in \u201856 and \u201859. From 1955-68, the building\u2019s chief basketball tenant was Marquette. Al McGuire colorfully coached future NBA players such as George Thompson, Dean Meminger, Jim Chones, Larry McNeil, Maurice Lucas, Earl Tatum and Lloyd Walton, and led the school to two Finals Fours and the NCAA title in 1977. Despite the 13-year gap between NBA teams, though, the pro game\u2019s most illustrious names passed through the Arena\u2019s doors. Tom Enlund, longtime Bucks beat writer for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel , did the research and found that 48 of the league\u2019s 50 Greatest Players had played there. The two exceptions: David Robinson and Shaquille O\u2019Neal, who got to the NBA in 1989 and 1992 respectively, after the Bucks had moved into Bradley Center. Guess who else played there: Elvis Presley, The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Doors, The Who, Led Zeppelin, Jethro Tull and Jimi Hendrix. As well as Frank Sinatra, Ray Charles, Neil Diamond and Luciano Pavarotti. In addition to Stevie Ray Vaughn, George Thorogood, Frank Zappa, Green Day, Stone Temple Pilots, Matchbox Twenty, Maroon 5 and Lil\u2019 Wayne. Every President from Truman through Obama has appeared there, as did former Minnesota governor Jesse (The Body) Ventura in his pro wrestling days, along with untold circus performers and roller-derby queens. So, for that matter, did Wayne Embry. \u201cWhere are they playing?\u201d Embry said by phone this week. \u201cOh my goodness. I\u2019ll be damned.\u201d Embry, most famous as the first black general manager of a major U.S. professional sports team when he was promoted to that post by the Bucks in 1972, got his first glimpse of the Arena while in college. His school, Miami of Ohio, had faced Marquette there. He returned in his 11th and final NBA season after being picked from Boston in the 1968 expansion draft. On Oct. 16 of that year, Embry scored 15 points in the Bucks\u2019 debut game , a loss to the Chicago Bulls in front of 8,467 fans at the Arena. \u201cIt was ideal for us starting out, because we had a lot of full houses and that made it feel big,\u201d said Embry, 80, who is now a senior advisor to the Toronto Raptors. A year later, with the good fortune of a coin flip and the resulting arrival of Lew Alcindor (later Kareem Abdul-Jabbar), the Bucks got big. They jumped from 27 to 56 victories with the dominant rookie and lost in the East finals to the eventual-champion New York Knicks. The next season, once Embry persuaded his old Cincinnati roommate, Oscar Robertson, to accept a trade there , Milwaukee won 66 games and its only NBA championship . The Bucks got into The Finals again in 1974, losing Game 7 at the Arena to the Celtics . Abdul-Jabbar leveraged his way out of Milwaukee to the Lakers after the 1974-75 season, taking his sky-hook success with him (they were 342-150 in six seasons). But an even bigger star arrived two years later. The floor. With Milwaukee\u2019s power brokers eager to promote the city and bolster civic pride, they hit upon an unlikely option: They commissioned pop artist Robert Indiana, a cohort of Andy Warhol most famous for his 1965 \u201cLOVE\u201d design , to create a basketball floor unlike any other. Indiana\u2019s design cost $27,500, was hailed as the \u201conly court that has paint covering the entire surface\u201d and, with its eye-popping use of yellow, orange, red, blue and green, was deemed by Marquette officials as \u201caesthetically distasteful.\u201d Featuring two massive \u201cM\u2019s\u201d embedded in the design, with \u201cMECCA\u201d (for Milwaukee Exposition, Convention Center and Arena) prominently featured at center court, others\u2019 reviews were mixed. Don Nelson, in his first full season as Bucks coach, said: \u201cAt first I thought we had to wear sunglasses because it was so bright.\u201d Doc Rivers, the L.A. Clippers coach who played on that floor while at Marquette and later as a Bucks opponent, said in 2014 for an ESPN documentary on the design: \u201cAs I got away from it, I learned about the history of it and the art of it. That it was an art piece. I was like, \u2018Wow, I never knew that. I thought I was just playing on a confusing floor.\u2019 \u201d * Photo gallery:  Bucks practice on MECCA court Said Marques Johnson, a four-time All-Star with Milwaukee and now a TV analyst with the team: \u201cPeople were all excited, that they were going to have the largest piece of pop artwork in the world. As a player, you\u2019re not overly enamored with that \u2014 you\u2019re like, \u2018I\u2019m just out here to play. As long as you can get some good liftoff and landing spots\u2019 \u2014 but it added to the allure. It brightened up a drab and dusty old arena and put a nice touch on a place that maybe wasn\u2019t that appealing at the time.\u201d The buzz in Milwaukee was exceeded by the floor\u2019s reception nationally, as viewers absorbed it again and again on telecasts. \u201cIt accomplished its goal,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt became a talking point, whether it was \u2018the crazy floor,\u2019 \u2018the colorful floor.\u2019 A lot of guys back in those days from opposing teams would say, \u2018What\u2019s it like to play on this psychedelic floor?\u2019 \u201d The original floor still exists and the Bucks initially pitched the NBA on the idea of using it for the game against Boston. Said Godsey: \u201cBut from the standpoint of it being a 60-year-old floor \u2014 that floor predated the Bucks even \u2014 with its dead spots and player-safety issues, they wouldn\u2019t give us the green light for that. So we went to work on [a replica provided by the team\u2019s floor contractor], getting permission from the people who assigned rights for Robert Indiana\u2019s artwork. \u201cIt sort of came down to the wire \u2014 we didn\u2019t know we\u2019d get it done and we had some contingency plans, but this was our hope from the beginning.\u201d Without the replica floor, much of the nostalgia of this #TBT game would be lost on the TNT audience. But its iconic status was elevated in part by the teams that played on it for most of its 11 years of usage at the Arena. From 1979-87, Nelson\u2019s Bucks averaged 54 victories, won their division seven times in eight seasons and made the playoffs each year in a streak of 12 consecutive postseason appearances. Milwaukee\u2019s all-time regular season record in the building was 582-209 (.736), thanks to some key players obtained in the Abdul-Jabbar trade with the Lakers \u2014 Brian Winters, Junior Bridgeman \u2014 and drafting or acquiring others such as Johnson, Sidney Moncrief, Bob Lanier, Terry Cummings, Paul Pressey and Ricky Pierce. \u201cThat\u2019s why I always joke with Lanier, if we could have gotten him maybe two years earlier, it would have made a profound difference,\u201d Johnson said of the Hall of Fame center, who joined the Bucks via a February 1980 trade . \u201cHe still was good, don\u2019t get me wrong, but instead of a 25-point, 12-rebound guy, he was more of a 17-point, eight-rebound player.\u201d As successful as those \u201880s Bucks teams were \u2014 Nelson was named Coach of the Year in \u201883 and \u201885 \u2014 they annually ran into powerhouses from Boston or Philadelphia and never reached The Finals. \u201cAt the time it was frustrating as hell, losing to Boston, losing to Philly, not being able to advance,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cAlways ending up just short. Sweep the Celtics, then run into Moses Malone. But looking back on it, we just lost to better teams. There really wasn\u2019t anything to hold your head down about, when you\u2019re talking Julius [Erving], Moses, Maurice Cheeks and Bobby Jones, or Larry Bird, Robert Parish, Kevin McHale and Dennis Johnson. Those were some good teams.\u201d Johnson laughed as he reflected. He spoke of the small forwards then who served as rivals: Erving, Bird, Bernard King, Walter Davis, Dominique Wilkins. Then he shared this about the only Milwaukee arena in which he played: \u201cThe most personal memory I have is, it was an old school arena so you\u2019ve got the organist, Frank Charles, sitting up in the rafters,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cEvery time I would dunk or catch a lob pass and do some body control or whatever, he would break into \u2018 Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze. \u2019 \u201cIf I got a chance, I\u2019d look up at him and give him kind of a wave and he\u2019d give me a nod. That was one of my favorite moments.\u201d Here are some other things you might not know or recall about this storied arena: * The Bucks clobbered Baltimore 151-99 on Jan. 10, 1971, but the final score wasn\u2019t the most memorable moment. That came in the fourth quarter, when Bullets forward Gus Johnson \u2014 long before Darryl Dawkins or Shaquille O\u2019Neal \u2014 shattered one backboard with a monstrous slam dunk. It took 30 minutes to position a replacement hoop. * Not quite a year later, on Jan. 9, 1972 , the defending champion Bucks snapped the Lakers\u2019 still-record NBA winning streak at 33 games as Abdul-Jabbar had 39 points and 20 boards. Milwaukee finished 63-19 to the Lakers\u2019 69-13 that season and lost to Wilt Chamberlain, Jerry West and the rest in the West finals. * Celtics coach Brad Stevens worked in the building once before. He led Butler past UWM in the Horizon League tournament championship game in March 2011. * There was no parking lot for the players, so they parked across State St. on the north side of the arena \u2014 at the McDonald\u2019s franchise owned by Embry. That store got bought out and steamrolled to make room for the Bradley Center. * The location of a garage door on the loading dock allowed Milwaukee\u2019s frigid winter winds to whip through the building and across the court. As a result, Bucks players often practiced in hoodies and sweat pants. Said Johnson: \u201cI was good friends with a lot of the Laker guys, and they would come in in the middle of January. It might be 30-below with the wind chill factor and they\u2019re coming in with their little polyester coats.\u201d * The 1977 All-Star Game was played at the Arena , the league\u2019s first after the NBA\/ABA merger. Five of the 10 starters had come over from the ABA, including the game\u2019s MVP, Erving. That event produced its own iconic pop art courtesy of LeRoy Neiman for its program cover and poster. * The Bucks\u2019 10th season opened with a bang when Abdul-Jabbar, back with the Lakers, punched Milwaukee rookie Kent Benson in the face just minutes into the game . His coaches reportedly had worked Benson into a lather in his first NBA game to play physically against the legendary big man, and Abdul-Jabbar did not take kindly to Benson\u2019s elbow to his midsection. Kareem broke his hand and missed two months, while Benson\u2019s facial fracture was cited as one reason for his career\u2019s mediocre trajectory. * On Dec. 9, 1978, the Chicago Hustle beat the Milwaukee Does 92-87 in what was billed as the first women\u2019s professional game ever. The Does played two seasons in the soon-defunct Women\u2019s Professional Basketball League. Inaugural Bucks coach Larry Costello coached the team in its second season. * Bucks owner Jim Fitzgerald infuriated the Celtics when he lit up a victory cigar \u2014 a dig at the legendary (and still active) Red Auerbach \u2014 after Game 4 of Milwaukee\u2019s sweep in the 1983 Eastern Conference semifinals. Lanier grabbed a courtside microphone to the PA system after the final horn to lead the fans in a \u201cSweep!\u201d chant. * Milwaukee\u2019s first-round triumph over Philadelphia in the 1987 playoffs meant that the great Erving played the final game of his Hall of Fame career at the MECCA. His line: 10-of-24 for 24 points with four rebounds, two assists and three steals in 40 minutes. * In October 1987, in the first McDonald\u2019s Open, the Bucks faced and beat Tracer Milan (featuring star Mike D\u2019Antoni) and the Soviet National Team in an early NBA brush with international competition. Milwaukee forward Terry Cummings was named tournament MVP. Meanwhile, Bucks coach Del Harris said: \u201c[We] left no doubt that if you want to beat somebody from the NBA, you\u2019d better pick on somebody other than the Bucks.\u201d * Payback can bite, as Bird made painfully clear to the Bucks in \u201886 when he led the Celtics to a sweep of Milwaukee in the Eastern Conference finals. It was said that Boston remembered Milwaukee\u2019s sweep antics from \u201883, and Bird was merciless to the end this time. He averaged 25.3 ppg, 9.5 rpg, 8.0 apg and 1.8 spg, scored 17 of his 30 points in the fourth quarter of the May 18 finale \u2014 and from the left corner, sank a 3-pointer as time expired in what became a 13-point victory, walking off the brightly colored even as the basketball swished through . \u201cI hope the other Celtics,\u201d Nelson said, \u201crealize what a privilege it is to play with Larry Bird.\u201d May the folks in Milwaukee realize, so many years later, what a privilege it is to see one more game at their city\u2019s storied and beloved arena.

In an eventual 107-102 home loss to the Denver Nuggets, Davis poured in 50 points \u2014 marking the second-highest scoring effort in his career. He added 15 rebounds, seven steals, four blocks and five assists in one of the best individual stat lines of the 2016-17 season.

The new explosiveness was showcased by Jaylen Brown, who celebrated his 21st birthday Tuesday with an opening-quarter slam against the winless Knicks. Brown (23 points on 16 shots) and rookie Jayson Tatum (22 on 15) became the Celtics\u2019 first duo to score at least 20 points in the same game before their 22nd birthday. \u201cThey are young guys,\u201d said Celtics coach Brad Stevens, \u201cbut to us, with the situation we\u2019re in, they\u2019re guys. Like, we need them to be guys. We need them to play well on Thursday.\u201d On Thursday, the Celtics (2-2 after their 110-89 clobbering of New York ) will be on the road for a rematch with the Bucks (3-1), who beat them 108-100 in Boston\u2019s home opener last week. Brown (18.8 points) and Tatum (14.8) rank No. 2 and 3, respectively, in points and minutes, while helping to fill in for All-Star Gordon Hayward, who appears to be out for the season after suffering a gruesome ankle on opening night in Cleveland. \u201cWe\u2019re in a situation right now where we\u2019re going to expect a lot out of those guys and we need them to be great, we need them to be able to respond to adversity, and we need to be able to respond to pats on the back just the same,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cWe have high expectations for them; they should have high expectations for themselves, and they\u2019re getting a great opportunity. So, we need them to continue to be good, and there\u2019s a lot of fun in that, I think.\u201d As much as they miss Hayward and wish he were here, the Celtics remain a team of upside. Apart from Al Horford (31) and Aron Baynes (30), everyone on the roster is 25 or younger. At this early-season moment, the Celtics are defined more by Brown and Tatum than they are by Kyrie Irving, their All-NBA point guard who was acquired from the Cavaliers last summer. \u201cIt\u2019s very obvious,\u201d said Horford of the Celtics\u2019 inexperience. \u201cWe feel it, we see it out there. Even though we have a lot of younger guys, they\u2019re mature beyond their years. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re dealing with the rookie headaches and things like that. But you can really tell it\u2019s game four of the year and we still have a ways to go.\u201d Hayward\u2019s abrupt absence has changed the point of view without altering the ultimate goal. The Celtics still want to contend for championships. In the absence of Hayward, however, they can\u2019t afford to reach for that outcome in the here and now \u2014 not with so much to be learned and proved. Will they be a defense-first team? An up-tempo, share-the-ball team? Those have been traits of Stevens\u2019 preceding four seasons in Boston. But it\u2019s too early to predict the future for this developing roster.  Irving is averaging 20 points and shooting 37.5 percent as he adapts to his new surroundings. He is going to be judged by whether he can take pressure off his young teammates even as he pushes them to thrive ahead of schedule \u2014 a passive-aggressive tack that LeBron James utilized while leading Irving and his fellow Cavaliers to The 2015 NBA Finals in their first season together. The young Celtic most likely to flourish is Brown, the second-year swingman ( and No. 3 pick of the 2016 Draft ) who generated 25 points on opening night while overcoming the shock of Hayward\u2019s gruesome injury. Brown has high hopes for himself across the board \u2014 his long-term goals include serving as president of the NBA Players Association \u2014 but Horford doesn\u2019t want to see him trying to take on too much too soon. \u201cWe just need him to do what he\u2019s been doing,\u201d Horford said. \u201cHe has that capability to be a great defender but also impact the offensive end. We want him to keep developing, to keep growing and improving, and make sure that we\u2019re staying after him and he starts understanding how we want him to play. He\u2019s been doing a good job of that.\u201d Though he has quickly become Boston\u2019s No. 2 scoring option, the Celtics are encouraging Brown to look beyond the numbers. \u201cIt should happen naturally,\u201d said Horford of Brown\u2019s statistical growth. \u201cThere\u2019ll be some nights that he\u2019ll have high-scoring games. There\u2019ll be other nights that he\u2019ll be doing more defensive work. I think it\u2019s impressive because there\u2019s not a lot of guys like him that are able to play defense and offense. He\u2019s usually guarding one of the better guys defensively, and at the same time we\u2019re expecting him to score the ball.\u201d  Tatum, the No. 3 pick last June, has been encouraged by teammates and coaches to hoist up shots. \u201cThat\u2019s the toughest part, me being a rookie and being out there with Al and Kyrie \u2013 instinctively I think, just give them the ball, even though I may be open,\u201d said 19-year-old Tatum, who has also emerged as Boston\u2019s No. 3 rebounder (7.8). \u201cBut it\u2019s good for our team, when somebody\u2019s open, to shoot their shot.\u201d The Celtics opened the second quarter Tuesday with a second-unit lineup meant to force-feed Tatum. Over the next 4:25 he sandwiched a pair of 3-pointers around a fade away, a transition assist, and a block that he turned into a full-sprint alley-oop as Boston stretched its lead out to 20 points. Tatum, who was 1-for-5 from the arc through his first three games, hit 4 of 6 on Tuesday. In the first half alone, he and Brown combined for 30 points \u2013 three fewer than the Knicks. \u201cWe don\u2019t need them to do anything they don\u2019t do well,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cWe just need them to be good at what they do well.\u201d As Brown continues to invest in the details of his development \u2013 extra shooting, weightlifting, individual skills workouts and the like \u2013 he serves as an inspiring role model for Tatum. \u201cIn Jaylen\u2019s case last year, he played really well, and he did what he did really well and he kept going \u2014 (but) there were times when he didn\u2019t,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cAnd I thought the best thing about him was how he just responded regardless. He was great working to get better the next day, regardless of whether the game before had gone well or not. That\u2019s the one thing we can take from that experience that Jayson needs to copy.\u201d They\u2019re not the only Celtics hoping for big steps. Fourth-year guard Marcus Smart has been sidelined the last two games by a sprained ankle, but after losing 20 pounds over the summer there is promise of him fulfilling his potential as a hardcore defender while achieving consistency at the other end \u2014 just in time for him to cash in as a restricted free agent next summer. Forward Marcus Morris, recovering from knee soreness, may make his Boston debut by Halloween, while backup point guard Terry Rozier has already shown that he can fit into a variety of lineups. \u201cWith Gordon\u2019s loss, our help is going to come from our bench and our depth \u2014 from guys like (rookie forward) Semi Ojeyele and once Marcus Morris gets back,\u201d Horford said. \u201cGuys like that are going to be able to step in and help us fill that void, which is hard to do when you have one of your best players out.\u201d Hayward\u2019s injury forced Stevens to simplify the offense. He was investing in cohesion by keeping his starters together on the court until 4:20 remained in their blowout win against the Knicks. \u201cWe just need to do what we\u2019re doing better,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cOur defense is going to have to be really, really good as we grow and learn how to score the ball together.\u201d The defensive principles haven\u2019t changed. \u201cIt\u2019s very similar to last year,\u201d said Horford. \u201cI\u2019m really conscious of talking to the (new) guys and making sure they understand where they need to be, and that they feel comfortable with what we need to do.\u201d When Brown came out with 2:41 left, a group of fans behind the basket shouted happy birthday to him. He waved to them from the sideline. It\u2019s early in his career, but he was already feeling at home. Ian Thomsen has covered the NBA since 2000.

Then we give it an overall grade on a scale of 1-5 Robert Horrys, named for the patron saint of last-second answered prayers. * * * The Philadelphia 76ers will have to chalk this one up as a learning experience. After trailing for most of the game, the Houston Rockets pulled off a late rally \u2013 closing the game on a 9-0 run \u2014 to stun the young Sixers 105-104 on Eric Gordon\u2019s corner 3-pointer. With 6.9 seconds left and the Rockets down by two, Gordon inbounded the ball to Ryan Anderson, who handed off to James Harden going to his left. When the double-team came from Robert Covington and Joel Embiid, Harden stumbled to the floor, dishing the ball to Gordon, who had faded to the corner. With Embiid lunging toward him, Gordon gave the center a pump-fake, took one dribble to his right and launched over the outstretched arm of Covington and silenced the crowd in Philadelphia with the made triple. DIFFICULTY: Gordon took 16 3-pointers (hitting five) on the night, but none was bigger or more difficult than his last. With two long-armed defenders in Embiid (7-0) and Covington (6-foot-9) and little room in the corner, Gordon had to think quickly and launch without hesitation. Gordon is having the best scoring year of his 10-year career, averaging 24.6 points through five games, but is still hitting just 26.8 percent of his 3-point attempts. Gordon didn\u2019t hesitate and there was little doubt this one was going in, though, considering the way the Sixers mishandled the end of the game. GAME SITUATION: Both teams played without key members. The Sixers were without No. 1 pick Markelle Fultz, who is out with a sore right shoulder, and Houston was without starters Chris Paul and Trevor Ariza, placing even more emphasis on the backcourt duo of Gordon and Harden. Gordon (29) and Harden (27) combined for 56 points, but the Rockets found themselves down 104-96 with 3:05 left after a layup from Philly rookie Ben Simmons that had the big Philly crowd of 20,682 fans ecstatic sensing a big win over an elite Western Conference team. But Philly couldn\u2019t convert down the stretch, with J.J. Redick (who finished with a team-high 22 points) missing a pair of 3s and Jerryd Bayless being forced into a terrible shot after Simmons dribbled down the clock on Philly\u2019s final possession. Those miscues led to Houston\u2019s final opportunity, and it only felt fitting that the Rockets would pull this one out. CELEBRATION: As Gordon\u2019s shot dropped in, James Harden, who had fallen to the floor on the play, flopped onto his back and raised both arms in celebration while Gordon raced down court with a single finger raised in the air before being mugged by his teammates at midcourt. The Sixers crowd, which had been energized all game, was left in a stunned silence as the Rockets raced off the floor. GRADE: The winner was nice, but you almost got the feeling that it was coming, even though Gordon was 4-for-15 on 3s before the game-winner, considering the two teams involved and the way Philly faltered down the stretch. Gordon\u2019s shot was nice, and it took some quick thinking and a quick release to get the shot off, but the level of difficulty wasn\u2019t too high. Embiid and Covington did a good job defending the play, taking the ball out of Harden\u2019s hands, but Gordon and the Rockets couldn\u2019t be denied on this night. Three Horrys .

But former commissioner David Stern thinks it\u2019s time for a change. Stern sat down with former player Al Harrington, who played 16 years in the league and has since become an advocate and entrepeneur in the medical marijuana business, in a recent documentary on UNINTERRUPTED . Harrington talked to Stern about his tenure as commissioner, his handling of the drug\u2019s use among players and how his perception has changed. \u201cI\u2019m now at the point where personally I think it should be removed from the banned list,\u201d Stern told Harrington. \u201cYou\u2019ve persuaded me.\u201d Stern was commissioner from 1984 to 2014 and helped enforce more strident rules during his tenure. \u201cIt was generally known at some point, until we tightened the rules, that a lot of our players were smoking a lot of marijuana,\u201d Stern said in the interview. \u201cIn fact, some of our players came to us and said, \u2018Some of these guys are high coming into the game.\u2019 But we began tightening it up, and at that time people accepted the generally held wisdom that marijuana was a gateway drug and that if you start smoking, you\u2019re liable to go on to bigger and better stuff.\u201d Stern said in the interview that sports leagues could play a vital role \u2014 working with players\u2019 associations \u2014 in pushing for better understanding of cannabis\u2019 medical benefits. \u201cI think we have to change the Collective Bargaining Agreement and let you do what\u2019s legal in your state,\u201d Stern said. \u201cIf marijuana is now in the process of being legalized, I would think you should be allowed to do what is legal in your state. Now I think it\u2019s up to the sports leagues to anticipate where this is going and maybe lead the way.\u201d In a statement, NBA spokesman Mike Bass says the league\u2019s position remains unchanged. \u201cWhile Commissioner Silver has said that we are interested in better understanding the safety and efficacy of medical marijuana, our position remains unchanged regarding the use by current NBA players of marijuana for recreational purposes.\u201d"}]
