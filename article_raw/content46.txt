Public health conditions prevented the Pacers, the NBA All-Star Host Committee and the NBA from appropriately planning and executing fan-focused All-Star activities in Indianapolis that were envisioned for this February. The 2024 NBA All-Star Game will take place at Bankers Life Fieldhouse, home of the Pacers, on Sunday, Feb. 18, 2024. Plans for a revised NBA All-Star 2021 will be announced at a later date. \u201cWhile we are disappointed that the NBA All-Star Game will not take place in Indianapolis in 2021, we are looking forward to the Pacers and the city hosting the game and surrounding events in 2024,\u201d said NBA Commissioner Adam Silver. \u201cI want to thank Herb Simon, Steve Simon, Rick Fuson and the entire Pacers organization as well as the NBA All-Star 2021 Host Committee and the community of Indianapolis for working with us to reschedule our All-Star activities.\u201d \u201cWe are excited about the opportunity to bring Indiana the very best All-Star experience in 2024,\u201d said Pacers owner Herb Simon. \u201cThe efforts of so many Hoosiers to prepare for NBA All-Star 2021 put us ahead of the game for the hard work to come, and we are so grateful to the NBA for once again recognizing Indianapolis as a city that delivers world-class events.\u201d NBA All-Star 2024 in Indianapolis will follow Cleveland in 2022 and Salt Lake City in 2023 as All-Star host. The 2024 game will mark the second NBA All-Star in Indianapolis, which hosted the midseason classic in 1985 . NBA ALL-STAR HISTORY IN INDIANAPOLIS Indianapolis previously hosted NBA All-Star in 1985, when the Western Conference defeated the Eastern Conference 140-129 in the 35th All-Star Game. The crowd of 43,146 at the Hoosier Dome was the largest to attend an NBA game at the time. All-Star Game MVP Ralph Sampson of the Houston Rockets finished with a game-high 24 points and a team-high 10 rebounds for the West, while Los Angeles Lakers guard Magic Johnson added 21 points and 15 assists. Detroit Pistons guard Isiah Thomas (22 points) and Boston Celtics forward Larry Bird (21 points) led the East. Rookies Michael Jordan of the Chicago Bulls and Hakeem Olajuwon of the Rockets made their All-Star debuts. NBA All-Star 1985 also featured a memorable Slam Dunk Contest, won by Atlanta Hawks forward Dominique Wilkins after a final-round duel with Jordan. Established in 1967, the Pacers spent their first nine seasons in the American Basketball Association (ABA). During that time, Indianapolis hosted two ABA All-Star Games, at Hinkle Fieldhouse (1968) and the Fairgrounds Coliseum (1970). The Pacers won three ABA championships before joining the NBA in 1976. In 1953, the NBA\u2019s third All-Star Game was played at the Memorial Coliseum in Fort Wayne, Ind., the current home of the Pacers\u2019 NBA G League affiliate, the Fort Wayne Mad Ants."},{"id":42797,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/paul-george-indiana-return-reception-fans","date":"2017-12-13","title":"Paul George expecting boos from Indiana Pacers fans","content":"OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) \u2014 Paul George knows the crowd at Bankers Life Fieldhouse well enough to expect a rude reception when he returns for the first time. George spent seven seasons with the Indiana Pacers, and the four-time All-Star helped them reach the Eastern Conference Finals twice. After last season, George\u2019s camp made it clear Indiana didn\u2019t figure into his long-term plans, so the disappointed Pacers traded him to Oklahoma City for Victor Oladipo and Domantas Sabonis rather than risk getting nothing in return for him. Indiana fans value loyalty \u2013 the player they hold in the highest regard, Reggie Miller, stayed with the Pacers for 18 years. They had their hearts broken back in 2005-06 when Ron Artest demanded a trade, the first step in the dismantling of a nucleus the Pacers expected to compete for NBA titles for years to come. George, also a one-time centerpiece to Indiana\u2019s title hopes, is gone, too. He figures boos will rain down as a result. \u201cI honestly wouldn\u2019t think it would be any other way,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Pacers fans outweigh the Paul George fans, so that\u2019s what I\u2019m looking forward to. I\u2019m going to embrace that. I\u2019m going to thrive on that. It\u2019s going to give me the energy to play better.\u201d Thunder forward Carmelo Anthony will be in a similar situation when the Thunder visit the New York Knicks on Saturday. Anthony was sent to Oklahoma City in the offseason after he waived a no-trade clause. \u201cWhen he gets booed, we get booed,\u201d Anthony said. \u201cWe\u2019re in this together. We understand the situation. I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s going to embrace that situation, and we\u2019re going to help him embrace that situation, and as a team, we\u2019re going to help him embrace that situation.\u201d George\u2019s transition has been a bit bumpy. He is playing outstanding defense, yet still getting comfortable on offense alongside Anthony and Russell Westbrook. He\u2019s averaging 20.6 points on 42 percent shooting overall and 41 percent shooting from 3-point range and leads the league with 2.4 steals per game. The team has struggled to a 12-14 record. \u201cWe\u2019re not enjoying these losses but we\u2019re enjoying the grind,\u201d George said. \u201cWe\u2019re enjoying the battles, we\u2019re enjoying the targets on our backs. We\u2019re enjoying everything that brought this team together.\u201d The trade seems to be just what Oladipo needed. After Monday\u2019s games, he ranked 10th in the league with 24.5 points per game, and the Pacers were No. 5 in the Eastern Conference with a 16-11 record. \u201cI think he\u2019s just in attack mode,\u201d George said. \u201cHe\u2019s aggressive. He\u2019s confident. You can tell he\u2019s worked extremely hard over this past summer, and Indy has given him the keys. You\u2019ve got a young team around, a fresh locker room. It\u2019s a lot of positive energy over there. They are playing well. They are playing good basketball.\u201d Oladipo downplayed Wednesday\u2019s game in his typical low-key manner. He said he still is friends with his former Thunder teammates and the game simply is about handling business. \u201cI look forward to every game, every game I play,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is just another game, just another game that we\u2019ve got to win. Obviously, you guys and the fans want to blow it up, which is fine. But we have to go out and play Pacers basketball.\u201d Anthony preferred to stir the pot. He believes the expected hostile environment in Indianapolis will provide an opportunity to build team unity. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to be ready for that because it\u2019s us against the whole (state of) Indiana,\u201d Anthony said. \u201cNot just the Pacers, but the whole Indiana. I think Paul is ready for it. As a professional, as a competitor, it\u2019s kind of bittersweet because you spent so much time and you want a different reaction from the people you put a lot of work in for, you fought for and you competed for. But then again, you want to go in there and have a good game. You want to win.\u201d"},{"id":42801,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/indiana-pacers-victor-oladipo-domantas-sabonis-find-success-new-team","date":"2017-12-13","title":"Victor Oladipo takes on go-to guy role, helps Indiana Pacers get over who's gone","content":" INDIANAPOLIS \u2013 Victor Oladipo has a fever and the only prescription is \u2026 no, not more cowbell. Cowbell might make sense, if you factor in Oladipo\u2019s love of and commitment to music ( his debut R&B album has been available since Oct. 6 ). But the fever currently afflicting Oladipo, shooting guard for the Indiana Pacers, has nothing to do with extracurriculars and everything to do with the odes and anthems he\u2019s been performing within the confines of 94 feet by 50 feet. If the fifth-year guard out of Indiana University, by way of the Orlando Magic and Oklahoma City Thunder, looks comfortable in his new star turn for the Pacers, well, just remember that\u2019s your word. Not his. \u201cYou could say I\u2019m comfortable with the people here,\u201d says Oladipo, who spent three seasons with the Hoosiers before becoming the No. 2 pick in the 2013 NBA Draft . \u201cI played in front of these fans, they mean a lot to me and I gave a lot to them just like they gave a lot to me while I was in college. \u201cBut I\u2019m never comfortable in any situation I\u2019m in. I will never be comfortable. That\u2019s what kind of makes me get up and work every day. It\u2019s like, never be satisfied. Because for some reason, ever since I was a little kid, I always wanted more.\u201d Oladipo\u2019s eyes just about glow after a weekend practice as he delves into his unflagging intensity. He doesn\u2019t undercut it with a smile or a token laugh. This is real heat. \u201cMaximize my talent and exhaust my potential,\u201d he says. \u201cIn order to do that, I\u2019ve got to come to work every day. That\u2019s my thought process. Wake up each day and be great that day.\u201d Each day would include tonight, when Oladipo will share center stage at Bankers Life Fieldhouse with the more decorated and once-beloved star who preceded him in the Pacers lineup. Paul George, a four-time All-Star and Olympic gold medalist during his seven seasons in Indiana, was due to face his old team for the first time since being traded to Oklahoma City in July . It was a parting necessitated by George, who had made clear his desire to sign a maximum-salary contract with the Los Angeles Lakers in the summer of 2018. But the trade was orchestrated by Kevin Pritchard, the Pacers\u2019 president of basketball operations, and Chad Buchanan, their general manager, who surprised the NBA by swapping George to OKC for Oladipo and big man Domantas Sabonis. You want intense? The initial reaction to that deal was intensely negative, quickly reaching hysterical proportions. The Pacers immediately were mocked for having traded George for nickels on the dollar. Reports out of Boston characterized Indiana\u2019s POBO as more of a bobo for allegedly spurning a Celtics\u2019 offer of multiple players and draft picks. Former Thunder star Kevin Durant called the move \u201cshocking\u201d and of George said \u201cIndiana just gave him away.\u201d Among much of the media that covers the league, there was a general feeling of \u201crubes\u201d afoot \u2014 that the Pacers had been snookered in taking back an overpaid ($21 million annually through 2020-21) second-tier talent and an overbilled guy who had disappeared in OKC\u2019s postseason. And now? Not so much on any of those fronts. George\u2019s stats are down in the \u201cOK3\u201d core he\u2019s formed with reigning Kia MVP Russell Westbrook and aging Carmelo Anthony. The Thunder (12-13) are the NBA\u2019s consensus disappointment, team category, with nearly a third of their season in the books. * Blogtable:  State of George-to-OKC now? Sabonis has boosted the Pacers off the bench in a half dozen ways. And Oladipo has all but earned himself a spot on the Eastern Conference All-Star team while speeding his new team\u2019s fans past their heartbreak over George\u2019s jilting. Generally, the best trades in sports are win-win, but for Indiana right now, a bit of win-lose has made the start of 2017-18 downright sublime. \u201cWe happened to really like Sabonis in the draft,\u201d former Pacers president and ongoing consultant Donnie Walsh said last week. \u201cWe wanted more of everything in the trade too. But when it came down to it, we had this offer with Oladipo, who we also liked. They\u2019ve come in here and the more they\u2019ve been here, the more we like \u2018em. We\u2019re happy.\u201d The Pacers also are 16-11, two weeks ahead in the victory column over their 42-40 finish last season that was good for a playoff berth. Oladipo is the biggest reason why, averaging more points per game (24.5) than George ever has. The 6-foot-4 guard who attended famous DeMatha High in Hyattsville, Md., spent much of last season being beaten up for his contract and negligible impact in Oklahoma City. He had taken grief earlier for his status as the second pick in 2013, a lofty status not of his doing. And here he was again in the summer, hearing it all over again for a transaction he didn\u2019t design. \u201cHe came in with a chip [on his shoulder],\u201d Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. \u201cI thought he should come in with a chip.\u201d Some would have flinched from the pressure. A few might have curled up, full blown fetal. Oladipo has gone entirely the other way. \u201cHis confidence is at an all-time high,\u201d backup point guard Cory Joseph said. \u201cHe knows how good he is.\u201d As Joseph spoke after the Pacers\u2019 upset of Cleveland Friday, a game in which Oladipo scored 20 of his game-high 33 points in the third quarter, a lilting voice drifted from behind the scenes in the home dressing room. \u201cLook at it right now, he\u2019s singing in the shower,\u201d Joseph said, tilting his head and laughing. \u201cHe\u2019s confident. You guys are all in here, he\u2019s just singing. He\u2019s a confident guy. Everybody in this locker room, everybody in this organization definitely welcomes that.\u201d Don\u2019t misunderstand. The critics still are out for Oladipo. \u201cMy mom told me yesterday I need to work on my free throws,\u201d he said with an eye roll after practice Saturday. She had noticed, during her son\u2019s run of big games in December \u2014 36 points at Toronto , 27 vs. Chicago , 33 against the Cavs the night before her chiding text \u2014 that he had missed 18 of 31 foul shots. This, by a career 80 percent shooter from the line. \u201cI\u2019m over that,\u201d Oladipo said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to miss no more. I\u2019ll make \u2018em next time. And if I miss \u2018em, I\u2019ll make \u2018em the next . If that\u2019s my problem right now, I think I can fix it.\u201d Twenty-four hours later, Oladipo took 13 free throws against Denver and made 11. He scored 47 points in all , hitting 15 of 28 shots and half of his 12 3-pointers. The comeback victory in OT got the Pacers to 4-for-4 on their six-game homestand and continued to shrink whatever chip it was that the 25-year-old was shouldering. \u201cIn the beginning of the year, I said, \u2018I don\u2019t have a chip. I have a brick house on my back,\u2019 \u201d Oladipo said. But not anymore, right, now that some folks are referring to it as \u201cthe Victor Oladipo trade\u201d rather than \u201cthe Paul George trade?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s what I feel like every morning, no matter what\u2019s going on,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t even think about the trade, honestly. It\u2019s in the past for me. People\u2019s opinions are going to be there whether you like it or not. From the outside looking in, I guess you could say [then] that was a great trade for OKC. That\u2019s what they believed. But it wasn\u2019t going to change the way I worked. It wasn\u2019t going to change my approach.\u201d This step up in status is considered perhaps the most difficult an NBA player can make. Suddenly, opposing coaches are X&O-ing him to death. The player dogging him up and down the court is the other guys\u2019 best defender. Often, they\u2019ll send double-teams to get the ball into one of his teammates\u2019 hands. \u201cHe hadn\u2019t had that,\u201d McMillan said. \u201cWhen he was in OKC, the game plan was focused on Westbrook. When he was in Orlando, he was just a young player. Now he is seeing the defenders like a LeBron [James], like a [DeMar] DeRozan, what these stars are seeing. He\u2019s seeing the best defenders and he\u2019s seeing teams game-plan to take him out. \u201cLearning how to play and be consistent every night with that challenge is something he\u2019s going through.\u201d Oladipo\u2019s quick success with the Pacers has kept any crowd critics at bay. They were pre-disposed to like him just as their rebound date after George, but had he underperformed, Oladipo\u2019s service time in Bloomington wouldn\u2019t have protected him for long from criticism. But now, it\u2019s George who likely will get the harsh reception. Oladipo, overtly after each of the recent victories, has made it clear to the home fans via some emphatic pointing and body language that the Fieldhouse happens to be his house. \u201cI don\u2019t say it, they say it,\u201d he said. \u201cI just do the gesture and they do the rest of the work for me. I let them do all the talking. We feed off them \u2014 when they\u2019re into it, we play better. I don\u2019t know why, that\u2019s just how basketball\u2019s always been. They\u2019re our sixth man and we need \u2018em every night.\u201d Oladipo\u2019s breakout season has been bolstered, too, by the Pacers\u2019 second-through-15th men. Those who already were in Indy knew how valuable George was at both ends. Those who, like Oladipo and Sabonis, were new this season were within their rights to be as skeptical as the national headlines of the guys coming in trade. OKC was a specific challenge, Oladipo having to learn on the fly how to fit his own darting, ball-heavy style to only the second man in NBA history to average a triple-double . Westbrook\u2019s usage was off the charts, rendering the other Thunder players to supporting cast whether suited to that role or not. Just like that, Oladipo had to catch and shoot as someone to get Westbrook into double digits in assists. It wasn\u2019t his nature and it made for an individually forgettable season. \u201cI had a role. I tried to play that role to the best of my ability. And I improved certain areas of my game in that role,\u201d was all he\u2019d say Saturday, stiffly, about the OKC experience. Said Walsh: \u201cI felt like he was going to get a different opportunity here. \u2026 When he got to Oklahoma City, he was playing wih a guy who was averaging a triple-double. And he liked Russell Westbrook. But he comes here, he\u2019s got an opportunity to be \u2018our guy.\u2019 \u201cI think he might have been looking for that. I never asked him. He\u2019s a really cool guy. He knows what he wants to be, I think.\u201d Oladipo needed this and the Pacers needed him to need it. With George gone, they were like a smile missing a front tooth. The other teeth weren\u2019t just going to move up in the pecking order \u2014 no matter how good young big man Myles Turner is \u2014 and replace the one they\u2019d lost. If they were going to have any success this season, if McMillan was going to be able to coach and adjust in his second year taking over for Frank Vogel, the players needed to fill their roles and welcome this new addition. That\u2019s why this tale of Oladipo\u2019s growing success is about what the Pacers have done for him, as much as it is what he\u2019s done for them. \u201cWe didn\u2019t really present it like that,\u201d McMillan said, \u201cbecause we were still trying to develop who our \u2018go-to guy\u2019 was. He has been slowly taking on that role through the things he\u2019s done. I haven\u2019t had to say anything. He\u2019s making good decisions with the ball. And the guys are getting a feel for what we\u2019re doing down the stretch because we\u2019ve had some success, and we\u2019ve had it with Victor having the ball.\u201d There might be NBA teams with chemistry as solid as the Pacers\u2019 right now, but it\u2019s hard to imagine there are any with better. It\u2019s more than mere relief that someone has stepped up, easing their own loads a bit. It is a genuine eagerness for Oladipo to max out, for each of the rest of them to do the same in whatever lane they\u2019re riding. \u201cVic\u2019s been everything at this point,\u201d Turner said. \u201cHe\u2019s done a great job of stepping up and being that guy, being that dude. It\u2019s amazing to have that when you\u2019re going through a situation where it\u2019s a brand-new team. We\u2019re still learning each other and he\u2019s showing that he\u2019s ready.\u201d Did Turner know this would happen and, if so, when? \u201cFirst couple days he started texting me in the summertime,\u201d the big man said. \u201cI saw what his mindset was, and I loved it from the jump. He carried that right in when we started playing pickup this summer.  \u201cVic\u2019s been traded, what, [two] times? He finally comes back home and he has a team that\u2019s telling him to go, telling him to be him. I don\u2019t think he had that with his former teams. Now that he\u2019s here and he\u2019s doing that, I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s [enjoying it].\u201d Said Joseph: \u201cHe\u2019s been a beast for us and he\u2019s going to continue to be a beast for us. \u2026 He\u2019s been running with that opportunity and opening eyes around the world.\u201d Even strong-willed, uber-confident Lance Stephenson, has backed up for Oladipo. \u201cThere\u2019s no hate, know what I mean?\u201d he said over the weekend. \u201cSome guys get mad about somebody doing good. This team wants its teammates to do good. That\u2019s what\u2019s going to make us even better.\u201d Oladipo keeps referring to the other Pacers in a legit lubricating of the \u201cno I in Indy\u201d process. \u201cHonestly I think it\u2019s the personalities and the men that we have in this locker room,\u201d he said. \u201cMy teammates are phenomenal people \u2014 not just basketball players, phenomenal people. When you surround yourself with great people, people who sincerely care about you and your team, the chemistry just comes naturally.\u201d The other guy in the trade, Sabonis, has developed more organically, his maturation seemingly inevitable regardless of locale when you tote up his youth, his work ethic and his bloodlines ( son of Hall of Famer Arvydas Sabonis ). He has gone from that rookie who logged just six minutes in the Thunder\u2019s five 2017 playoff games against Houston to an essential piece in McMillan\u2019s rotation. \u201cOnce I got traded, I knew this was a great opportunity for me to show people what I can really do,\u201d said Sabonis, the No. 11 pick in 2016 . \u201cI was a rookie last year. Everything was new. Here, I\u2019m being used more at the 5. That\u2019s more the position I\u2019ve been used to playing my whole life.\u201d Sabonis\u2019 minutes are up from 20.1 in OKC to 24.6 off Indiana\u2019s bench. His scoring has doubled from 5.9 ppg to 12.1. And his PIE rating has soared from 4.9 last season to 12.6 , a sign of the versatility the skilled big man possesses. \u201cI love Sabonis,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cHis father was one of the greatest players in the world, so I don\u2019t like that comparison \u2014 it kills him. He [Domantas] is just more of everything you think he is. He\u2019s stronger than you think. He can shoot the ball better. He\u2019s got good hands, he can catch the ball. I\u2019ve seen him make moves in game that I\u2019ve never seen him make in practice.\u201d Said Turner: \u201cI played against Domas in college \u2014 I knew what kind of player he was. I was excited when we got him. He\u2019s gotten bigger and stronger since then, obviously, and he just didn\u2019t have a chance to show himself last year. But he\u2019s been big for us now, especially when I was out with the concussion. He stepped up huge in that role and we\u2019ve played well since then.\u201d The Pacers are playing faster this season, up from 18th in pace last season to 10th now , part of their improvement from 15th in offensive rating (106.2) to 6th (108.3) . They\u2019re doing better, too, in contesting shots and throttling opponents\u2019 field-goal accuracy. The biggest reason why has been Oladipo\u2019s blossoming. Whether due to the sunshine of new, happier surroundings or from that darker, more intense place, to prove cynics wrong. No one can now talk of the Pacers\u2019 bungling of what, after all, was a deal to rent George, not to have him long-term. Fans at Bankers Life figure to boo George on his first visit back, with an inventory they haven\u2019t needed or used on Oladipo. Some might see that as ingratitude, others as respect.

This barstool debate will likely go on forever, but who do you think is the greatest Laker of all time? * * * David Aldridge :  Not trying to split hairs, but are we talking guys who played for the Lakers at any point in their careers, or someone who was a Laker Lifer? If the former, I\u2019d have to take Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who is on my NBA Mount Rushmore. But he did play his first six seasons in Milwaukee, during which time he was Rookie of the Year, Finals MVP and won three of his six league MVP awards, before playing his last 14 years in L.A. If the latter, I have to take Magic Johnson over Jerry West. The ledger: five NBA titles \u2014 the first as a rookie, which included Magic\u2019s seminal 42-point\/15-rebound\/seven-assist effort in the deciding Game 6 of the 1980 Finals in Philly , playing center for an injured Kareem. Three Finals MVP awards. Three league MVP awards. The best nickname ever. Steve Aschburner :  Bully for Kobe Bryant, though the retiring of two jersey numbers for one guy is silly, excessive and so coddling as to seem fit for a millennial. Pick one, c\u2019mon! Especially since the greatest Laker of all time remains Earvin (Magic) Johnson. I\u2019m not counting rings or toting stats for a visceral, subjective verdict such as this. I\u2019m simply of a certain age that got to see Magic in all his glory on the court. And feel and hear the added buzz, home or away, when he and his Showtime pals were in the building. Chamberlain happens to be my favorite Laker of all time, and I can come up with hard criteria why most of them fall short \u2014 not any (Baylor) or enough (West) rings, splitting time with other franchises (Wilt, Kareem). But it\u2019s really not about that in my view. It\u2019s about the way Magic revived Abdul-Jabbar\u2019s career, it\u2019s about the way he and Larry Bird revived the NBA and most of all, it\u2019s about the smile that invited everybody in. Shaun Powell :  A quick \u201cno\u201d to Wilt and Kareem; both spent part of their careers elsewhere, although admittedly Kareem had massive seasons with the Lakers. But these \u201cwho\u2019s greater\u201d arguments must be conducted in context. I never saw Elgin play, or West, and that\u2019s punishment for being born too late. Therefore, the vote is Magic over Kobe , partly because of what Magic did for the league. But there\u2019s no wrong answer here, is there? John Schuhmann :  In regard to being the best player on championship teams, transforming the culture, being a leader, and making the players around him better, it\u2019s Magic Johnson . But Jerry West makes a strong case when you consider his work as the team\u2019s general manager and the architect of championship teams beyond his years as a player.  Sekou Smith :  I\u2019ve always been partial to Magic Johnson. And there is nothing that Kobe or anyone else has done to change my mind. As far as impact, accomplishments, transcendent greatness and lasting legacy in Los Angeles and beyond, I\u2019d think it would be hard to argue for anyone above Magic. Granted, I realize your opinion rests largely on what generation you are a part of and how you weight the titles won, and in what era, for each player. But without Magic\u2019s arrival and the \u201cShowtime\u201d Lakers era, the history of the franchise is so dramatically different that Kobe and anyone else who came after Magic would not have had a standard to chase. West, Wilt and Kareem all worked wonders in purple and gold, but no one had the impact in that Lakers uniform that Magic did. And I don\u2019t care how many times Magic claims that Kobe is the greatest Laker of them all!"},{"id":42796,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-joel-embiid-philadelphia-76ers-best-center-nba","date":"2017-12-13","title":"Blogtable: Is Joel Embiid the NBA's best big man?","content":"* * * Joel Embiid says he is the best big man in the NBA. What say you?  * * * David Aldridge :  I say he may be right. Who\u2019s better? We all see what Karl-Anthony Towns can do on the block and wings offensively, but until very recently, he\u2019s been a terrible defender. Embiid has been, if not a stopper, a very good defender, both on the ball and helpside. You can make a case for Anthony Davis, sure, but he seems to have as much trouble staying on the floor as Embiid has had. Rudy Gobert is an elite defender, but Embiid is clearly superior offensively. Marc Gasol is 32 and has fallen off defensively. And while I love DeMarcus Cousins\u2019s game, Embiid has it all over him on Twitter. I\u2019m Trusting The Process on this one. Steve Aschburner : I say, he\u2019s generally right but it\u2019s always best to let others say it for you, big guy. In Embiid\u2019s case, the skill set, the production and the personality are all present and accounted for. The question remains, is he durable enough? If he can minimize his absences, playing 70 games or so a year, and stay on the floor as needed like he did in Minnesota Wednesday \u2013 39 minutes in the Sixers\u2019 OT victory, leading with 28 points, 12 rebounds and eight assists head-to-head with Karl-Anthony Towns \u2013 then I\u2019m right there with Embiid in his assessment. But if he breaks down again or has to be restricted to, oh, 60 games or fewer going forward, then I\u2019d stick with Towns, DeMarcus Cousins or Marc Gasol as best big for the short-term. Shaun Powell :  Slow down, young man. Perhaps in due time most of us might agree with Embiid, but for now he\u2019s just throwing shade at other big men who are his equal if not better. DeMarcus Cousins is at the head of the list, and Karl-Anthony Towns isn\u2019t far behind. Here\u2019s what I want to see from Embiid before I throw rose petals at his feet (carefully, that is): A full season and an All-NBA selection. Without those, I\u2019m looking elsewhere. John Schuhmann :  In the context of the team he plays on, Draymond Green is the best big in the league, because both ends of the floor are equally important. Green is the league\u2019s best defender, a versatile big who can protect the rim and defend guards on switches. He\u2019s not as polished offensively as DeMarcus Cousins or Joel Embiid, but (this is where context comes into play) he\u2019s a terrific complement to the Warriors\u2019 perimeter All-Stars, a smart screener and passer who\u2019s a critical cog in the best offense in NBA history. In a vacuum, Embiid has a case as an impact player on both ends of the floor. And sooner than later, the title of \u201cbest big in the league\u201d will surely belong to him. But right now, it belongs to the only big who played more than 15 minutes per game for the team that went 16-1 in the playoffs.  Sekou Smith : Joel Embiid says lots of interesting things that other players with his limited amount of time on the floor in actual games might keep quiet about. But part of Embiid\u2019s appeal and aura is his unabashed belief in himself and the fact that he is indeed the best big man in the NBA. He\u2019s not there just yet. I\u2019d argue DeMarcus Cousins has a thicker body of work to make that claim right now. But Embiid is certainly on the short list and definitely a guy who has the entire skill set to earn that distinction and carry that best big man flag for years to come. He\u2019ll have to battle other young stars like Karl-Anthony Towns and Nikola Jokic for the title in the future, which should be entertaining, but you can\u2019t wear the crown before your time."},{"id":48272,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-who-should-be-happier-how-paul-george-indiana-pacers-trade","date":"2017-12-13","title":"Blogtable: Should Indiana Pacers or Paul George be happier with how trade turned out?","content":"* * * As Paul George returns to Indiana tonight for the first time since he was traded by the Pacers, who should be happier with how things have turned out: Pacers fans, or Paul George? * * * * Tonight on ESPN:  Thunder vs. Pacers (7 ET) David Aldridge :  Uh, Pacers fans. This isn\u2019t close right now, is it? PG-13 is miserable in OKC, which inexplicably hasn\u2019t been able to figure out how to win regularly yet with three All-Stars, each of whom should be considerably motivated to make it work with the other two guys. George may well have the last laugh if he walks to the Lakers next June, as most still suspect will happen. They have a young core that\u2019s promising, and he\u2019ll be back home. But Indy isn\u2019t a laughingstock, as I and most people thought it would be. Victor Oladipo (One DeMatha!) is having an All-Star season, and Domantas Sabonis looks like a 10-year guy at the the four. I was wrong about how bad the Pacers would be. Way wrong. Loud wrong. Stupid wrong. For now. Let\u2019s see where we are in March. Steve Aschburner : Paul George should be happier, even in the muck of the Thunder\u2019s season so far. He\u2019s on his way to what he really wants, which is a key role for the Los Angeles Lakers. Once his perfectly legitimate ambition became publicly known, his days as the Pacers\u2019 best player and leader were over. So much so that I wrote at the time, the best move for all considered \u2014 for George, for the Lakers, for the NBA \u2014 would have been for Magic Johnson and Rob Pelinka to have done a deal in the summer. It\u2019s not healthy for the league to have a star and a team pining away for each other from afar. But Indiana\u2019s Kevin Pritchard pulled the trigger on the trade with OKC and that was OK. More than OK, given the play so far of Victor Oladipo and Domantas Sabonis. But let\u2019s not forget the fine years of service George gave to the folks in Indianapolis, and his desire to please extended to sometimes being too candid in interviews. It\u2019s just too bad his journey home to California has to be a two-step process. Shaun Powell :  The longer I watch the Thunder, I\u2019m not sure what Paul George can be happy about. And of course, Pacers fans are elated with their team in the playoff mix (OK, it\u2019s early) and actually looking entertaining some nights. Victor Oladipo has turned out better than expected and has the floor to do what he wants, now that he doesn\u2019t answer to Russell Westbrook anymore. We should wait until summer to check the happy-meter of George, who could be moving on to another place in search of joy. John Schuhmann :  I won\u2019t pretend to know how George feels. Maybe the Thunder\u2019s struggles, if they continue, will make it easier for him to choose a new team next summer. But he can\u2019t be happy with the results or the lack of chemistry in Oklahoma City. Pacers fans should surely be happy with how things have turned out. The Pacers have been a better team than the Thunder, Victor Oladipo and Domantas Sabonis (who were both clearly misused in OKC) have been terrific, there\u2019s more stability in Indiana, and there\u2019s still room for improvement. Myles Turner isn\u2019t yet the player he can be and Glenn Robinson III hasn\u2019t played all season. Of the 16 teams in playoff position, the Pacers are the biggest surprise.  Sekou Smith :  With the way Victor Oladipo is playing, Pacers fans have every reason to feel like happy heading into the Christmas holiday. The trade that looked so lopsided early in the summer looks like a smashing success for Kevin Pritchard and the rest of the franchise braintrust. It\u2019s not just Oladipo playing like an All-Star, though that\u2019s a huge part of it. It\u2019s Domantas Sabonis playing as solid as he has and the splendid chemistry this group has shown in coach Nate McMillan\u2019s second season at the helm. The Thunder haven\u2019t had an easy time transitioning George and Carmelo Anthony into a cohesive Big Three. But I\u2019d caution Pacers fans to refrain from gloating too much tonight. There is still plenty of time left in this season. Be careful of celebrating prematurely. If the Pacers make the playoffs and Oladipo continues on his current trajectory, there will be plenty of time to rub in the faces of everyone who doubted things would turn out well in Indianapolis."},{"id":48279,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/michael-carter-williams-difficult-start-career-2013-nba-draft","date":"2017-12-13","title":"Michael Carter-Williams remains optimistic after uneven start to career","content":"* Tonight on ESPN:  Hornets vs. Rockets, (9:30 ET) CHARLOTTE, N.C. \u2014 The 2013-14 home opener of the Philadelphia 76ers drew a large and hyper crowd for a game against LeBron James and the Miami Heat , not necessarily because of who was playing; actually, the object of the affection was someone who wasn\u2019t. There he stood in baggy jeans, a jacket one size too big, a do-rag defiantly wrapped around his head and showing puppy eyes that lied about his image and age. Allen Iverson was approaching his 40s and uncomfortably retired. Based on his outfit, he couldn\u2019t let go of yesterday. Nor could nostalgic Philly fans who applauded and shouted during a ceremony to honor the iconic former Sixer, who playfully cupped his ear with his hand to encourage the love. Then, something unexpected happened: Philly honored a second Sixers point guard that same night. Much like Iverson well before him, Michael Carter-Williams buzzed around the floor, getting buckets, attacking the rim, finding the open man and cutting off Miami passing lanes. If he couldn\u2019t upstage Iverson, he certainly outdid LeBron by scoring 22 points with 12 assists, seven rebounds and nine steals in a Sixers\u2019 upset win . It was his first game as a pro, with his misty-eyed family in the stands, with Iverson pumping a fist, with LeBron feeling flat, and the night felt surreal, dreamy, galactic. How could he or anyone not see that this was the beginning of something special? \u201cA great night,\u201d Carter-Williams recalled the other day. \u201cI always wanted to play that way, against guys like LeBron James and Dwyane Wade. After I had, like, seven points, my mom told someone that she\u2019d be happy if the game ended right now.\u201d That smash opening act led to the Kia Rookie of the Year award , which of course then led to a series of injuries, trades, bad fits, false starts, airballs, benchings and a failure to secure the kind of blockbuster contract that allows you to live XXL. Four years and four teams later, Carter-Williams is the backup point guard for the Charlotte Hornets with a career creeping down the path of the unknown, already sitting at the crossroads at age 26. This wasn\u2019t a totally self-created spiral. His body betrayed him as much as his jump shot. He found himself trapped in situations that ranged from weird to woeful. He had the timing of a fake Rolex. An award-winning rookie was put through the NBA wringer and fell through the cracks and has now landed a few seats down the bench from Michael Jordan, although symbolically, he\u2019s worlds away from the Hornets owner. Bitter? Angry? Confused? Yeah, just a bit. \u201cIt was tough, given the situations I\u2019ve been in,\u201d he said, \u201cand the backlash I received wasn\u2019t worthy or fair to what I\u2019d been going through. I was in tough situations with injuries and being traded and it affected my performance on the floor. I got real low, with everybody asking, `What happened to him?\u2019 It wasn\u2019t right.\u201d He\u2019s on a one-year deal with the Hornets, which he hopes to leverage into security next summer in free agency, though the big-paycheck prospects are hardly encouraging so far. Still searching for durability with his body and respectability for his game, Carter-Williams is averaging 17.3 minutes in role-playing duty . And he\u2019s once again haunted by his faulty shooting, now dragging at 27 percent, deadly for a guard. It\u2019s a cautionary tale about fate and the curvy nature of pro sports, and about the 2013 NBA Draft , headlined by the one and only Anthony Bennett. From almost every conceivable measuring tool and metric, that class lurks as perhaps the quietest in NBA history. The only All-Star is Giannis Antetokounmpo, who went 15th , and he, Rudy Gobert and CJ McCollum are the only franchise cornerstones. Half of the top 10 are already on different teams. Another way to apply context is with money. Only Giannis, McCollum, Gobert, Otto Porter Jr. and Steven Adams received max contracts, and half of the top 10 didn\u2019t see multi-year extensions. Several players sat on the free-agent market last summer for weeks and even months, collecting cobwebs as they nervously stared at a market that turned chilly a year after doling out millions. They begrudgingly settled for qualifying offers that amounted to pocket change: one year and $4 million for Nerlens Noel (the No. 6 pick), one year and $4.2 million for Alex Len (No. 5). The No. 9 pick and consensus college player of the year, Trey Burke , is playing for the Knicks. The Westchester Knicks of the G League. As a whole, that class was astonishingly light at the top, lacked any second-round surprises (besides Allen Crabbe) and quickly became a wash. And of course, the No. 1 pick is already out of the league. Bennett wasn\u2019t even the consensus top choice prior to the Draft among NBA talent scouts , some of whom had Noel rated higher, even though Noel was coming off knee surgery. That said plenty about the class and also Bennett, who leveraged a decent stretch at UNLV to hear his name called first by Cleveland. That joy didn\u2019t last long; Bennett was a hopeless \u2018tweener at forward in his pitstop NBA career and instantly exposed for his lack of shooting and low-post grit. He quickly became a throw-in for the Kevin Love trade but couldn\u2019t salvage his career in Minnesota, Toronto or Brooklyn. He currently plays for the Northern Arizona Suns in the G League. It\u2019s a fate that the most celebrated rookie of that class hopes to avoid, and praying he isn\u2019t running out of chances. Carter-Williams, the 11th pick, was consistent and steady that first season. A 6-foot-6 guard who caused matchup problems and brought good vision and defensive instincts, he averaged 16.7 points, 6.2 rebounds, 6.3 assists and 1.9 steals . He led all rookies in points, rebounds, assists and steals. Only Magic Johnson and Oscar Robertson did that, although for the sake of context, Magic\u2019s competition in his first year was fellow Hall of Famer Larry Bird, and Oscar came in with Hall of Famers Jerry West and Lenny Wilkens. Carter-Williams became the lowest-drafted player to win Rookie of the Year since Mark Jackson in 1987. But coming from that 2013 Draft, it was like winning a sack race without using a sack. After that, he was no longer blessed by the basketball gods; he still hasn\u2019t matched the numbers or impact he had as a rookie. The Sixers were in the early stages of a crash-and-burn rebuilding philosophy managed by former GM Sam Hinkie. Rather than having the chance one day to throw lobs to Joel Embiid, who was drafted a year later but sat with a foot injury, Carter-Williams was dealt midway through his second season by Hinkie . Carter-Williams was exchanged right before the 2015 trade deadline for a package that included three picks (a first-rounder belonging to the Lakers is now property of the Celtics and unprotected for 2018). \u201cBeing traded was hard for me,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t see that coming. To this day, I still don\u2019t understand it. I never got any answers and never went to ask for any. Of course I felt pretty bad but I was fine with it once I realized the situation I was going into \u2014 or thought I was going into.\u201d He was in Milwaukee to be coached and tutored by Jason Kidd, one of the all-time great point guards. Carter-Williams gave Milwaukee a big backcourt with Khris Middleton and the Bucks had a long and lean starting five. He scored 30 against the Cavs and another 30 in his first game back in Philly, and in the playoffs went for 22 points and nine assists in a game against the Bulls. The next season he looked forward once again to feeding passes to Giannis, until Kidd had another idea: Giannis would take Carter-Williams\u2019 position and do the feeding to others. Suddenly and once again, an ideal situation turned sour quickly for Carter-Williams, who couldn\u2019t believe the sharp turn his career took. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to describe it,\u201d he said about his relationship with Kidd. \u201cWe didn\u2019t see eye to eye on different things. He was a great player but he hadn\u2019t been coaching for that long and he was still learning. I learned from him but my expectations going there were high and it wasn\u2019t the situation I thought I was going to be in.\u201d On one hand, Kidd and Milwaukee put Carter-Williams out of his misery by trading him; on the other, Carter-Williams went to the struggling, chaotic Chicago Bulls , who were in the process of being stripped to the bone, at the start of the 2016-17 season. Once again, Carter-Williams was swept up by the winds of change and spit out. Not only did his teams change, so did the league, which gravitated to players and especially guards who brought shooting range and consistency. Then and now, that\u2019s his biggest flaw. He\u2019s a career 25-percent shooter from deep (just 40 percent overall), and in a 3-point league, that\u2019s a deal breaker. Also, injuries didn\u2019t help. The last three years he has played only 165 out of 246 games due to shoulder, ankle and hip conditions. He needed platelet-rich injections in both knees last summer to quicken the healing process of his patella tendons. \u201cHe\u2019s had some difficult injuries and it has clearly hampered his development,\u201d said Jim Boeheim, his college coach at Syracuse. \u201cLet me tell you, he knows how to play. He\u2019s always been a good passer and defender. But the injuries, especially with the shoulder, have held him back in his shooting development. I told him to keep playing and hope the ball goes in.\u201d Those circumstances both within and beyond his control have prevented Carter-Williams from cashing in. He was the first Rookie of the Year in NBA history to fail to have his rookie contract extended and is on a one-year deal with the Hornets for $2.7 million. \u201cYou know what? I\u2019m in a good place now,\u201d he said. \u201cIt took me a while to regroup and restart and resurface and get healthy, which I\u2019m still trying to do. I\u2019m still young and my game is still growing. I haven\u2019t reached my potential. I still believe I\u2019m a starter in this league. I\u2019ll play a role right now, because that\u2019s what my team needs to win, but I want to lead a team. \u201cEach game I go out and play with a chip on my shoulder. I probably lost some respect from some guys in the league. But ultimately my goal is to make all the teams that gave up on me say, `We had him once.\u2019 I\u2019m going forward.\u201d He\u2019ll always have that opening night with Iverson leading the cheers, that near triple-double against LeBron, and that Rookie of the Year hardware. But that\u2019s the thing, you see. After that launch, Michael Carter-Williams expected more. For one year, he was the king of that 2013 draft. Four years later, he\u2019d rather not become a symbol of what that draft became. Veteran NBA writer Shaun Powell has worked for newspapers and other publications for more than 25 years.

Chicago Bulls bristle at the notion","content":" CHICAGO \u2013 Break up the Bulls? A three-game winning streak doesn\u2019t seem like much by the Celtics\u2019 or Cavaliers\u2019 standards \u2013 or for that matter, by the standards of most of the 29 other teams around the NBA. But these are the Chicago Bulls, a team whose avowed mission is to land the highest possible Draft pick in June by cramming the lottery hopper full of chances in May. That means losing, and lots of it. Big or little, early or late, just as long as it\u2019s often. This season began as intended, with just three victories in 23 games across 50 days, a solid start for what was supposed to be a basketball Bataan death march. But now? All of a sudden it\u2019s three victories in four nights. Stuffing the wrong side of the W-L ledger by winning at Charlotte in overtime Friday, heading home to beat the Knicks Saturday and then thumping the Celtics Monday night at United Center. For two consecutive home games, the big building on Madison had a buzz to it, and noise, and smiles at the end over Big Macs and baby steps. Afterward, you half-expected management to call an impromptu press conference and announce a contract extension for coach Fred Hoiberg. Of course, you also half-expected the Bulls\u2019 visionaries to stage that news conference to explain that Hoiberg had been fired for straying from the bleak blueprint. The macro of a season down the sink is at odds right now with the micro of 82 games, some of them \u2013 like it or not \u2013 quite winnable. The Bulls, after all, aren\u2019t the only lottery-minded team. There\u2019s a crowd of them, still in single digits as far as victories, still more committed to college freshmen than to current players or ticket buyers on any given night. So how has Hoiberg and his staff built and maintained a firewall between the team\u2019s nightly ambitions and the front office\u2019s diametrically opposed overarching goal? \u201cWe\u2019ve tried to shut everything out about that,\u201d the Bulls coach said. \u201cWe come in every day and talk about win or lose, taking steps in the right direction. After some early games where we played well, we had a couple setbacks, we had a couple low-effort games that can\u2019t happen. Whether we win or lose, you go in after the game and say \u2018We were the harder playing team.\u2019 And we\u2019ve done that for the majority, really, of the last 10, 12 games. We played with great passion, with great energy. \u201cWe\u2019re not thinking that way. I can promise you that.\u201d With a handful of inexperienced but willing perimeter shooters on a roster long on question marks and role players, Hoiberg at least has been able to coach more as he intended when hired in 2014. Through Chicago\u2019s first 25 games, it had made 261 3-point shots \u2013 65 more than any previous Bulls team at the same point. They hit 12 of 29 against the Celtics, including 7-of-8 by backups in a dominating 65-30 bench performance. But \u201cHoiball\u201d isn\u2019t fully out of its cocoon, simply because the rebuild still is so raw. Running before flying? Walking before running? Nah, this still is in the crawling stage. Which means keeping the players focused on the imperative of today while the bosses bask in the low-pressure zone of next spring. So far, it seems to be working. \u201cI don\u2019t know what tanking is,\u201d said forward Bobby Portis, who scored 23 points in 23 minutes in reserve. \u201cWe want to win. We don\u2019t want to be looked at as if, \u2018Aw, they\u2019re just going out there, tanking,\u2019 whatever. We want to be guys who go out there and compete and earn our keep too.\u201d Portis did more than earn his keep Monday. He was part of several subplots to Chicago\u2019s plucky little winning steak. Subplot No. 1: In the giddiness over the Bulls\u2019 victory, some forgot that they beat only the semi-Celtics. No Kyrie Irving (left quad bruise), no Marcus Morris (left knee maintenance), Al Horford at less than 100 percent (right knee bruise) and of course no Gordon Hayward. Moving Marcus Smart into Irving\u2019s spot obviously thinned Boston\u2019s bench. But Irving isn\u2019t known for his individual defense, and Chicago managed to drop 108 points on the NBA\u2019s No. 1 defense (99.4 points allowed per 100 possessions coming in). Boston coach Brad Stevens gave credit where it was due. \u201cThey played harder than we did,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cThey played with more presence than we did. They played more competitive than we did. They played with more authority than we did. \u2026 We were playing a team that feels really good. And they stayed the course.\u201d All of which was true. But odds are good this game will be Exhibit A in arguging for Irving as an MVP candidate. Lost to Chicago by 23 in a game he missed? Man, that\u2019s valuable. Subplot No. 2: Chicago\u2019s best two players were Portis and Nikola Mirotic, the battling Bulls of opening week notoriety. Portis, agitated by Mirotic in one of the final practices before their Oct. 19 opener, punched his fellow power forward , fracturing a couple of bones in Mirotic\u2019s face and sidelining him until Friday\u2019s game in Charlotte. But the Bulls are 3-0 since Mirotic\u2019s return and the two still-wary teammates directed all their aggression at the visitors. Mirotic started in place of rookie Lauri Markkanen (back spasms), what he considered his rightful place before the punch, and scored 24 points on 9-of-14 shooting with eight rebounds. They didn\u2019t lavish each other with praise, but they kept it professional and got impressive results. It\u2019s a far cry from the him-or-me ultimatum that leaked out of Mirotic\u2019s \u201ccamp\u201d during his recovery and during Portis\u2019 eight-game team suspension. \u201cThose guys are playing off each other,\u201d Hoiberg said. \u201cWhen we got switches, they were hitting each other in the high-low. Finding each other. I just love the chemistry that those two guys are playing with right now.\u201d Subplot No. 3: A season committed to \u2013 spent on, might be more accurate \u2013 winning by losing now might be at risk of losing by winning. That\u2019s the fear of some Bulls fans, that they\u2019ll settle for small satisfaction and lose sight of the big picture. So let\u2019s offer some perspective: Of the teams that finished with the NBA\u2019s worst overall record in each of the past 10 seasons, four got there in spite of one (and precisely one) winning streak of three games or more. The 82-game schedule provides plenty of opportunities to outweigh one hot week. Then again, of those 10 bottom-feeding teams, only two wound up selecting No. 1 overall in the Draft. Having the worst record doesn\u2019t assure a team of the top pick as much as it assures its fans of a long, laborious season. The Bulls have just shortened theirs up a bit the past few nights.

Okafor was the consensus No. 1 high school player in his class, won a national championship at Duke, and averaged 17.5 points and seven rebounds in his rookie campaign for the Philadelphia 76ers. Then things changed drastically. Okafor struggled with injuries and a logjam at his position in his second season. \u201cWhen I first got drafted there, we already had Nerlens (Noel) there, Joel (Embiid) was there, so we\u2019re trying to have three starting centers on the same team,\u201d Okafor said Monday at his introductory news conference with his new team, the Brooklyn Nets. \u201cIt just never really was the right fit.\u201d The 76ers traded Okafor along with seldom-used guard Nik Stauskas and two draft picks to the Nets on Thursday. Philadelphia got forward Trevor Booker from Brooklyn. Okafor also had off-court problems during his time in Philadelphia. He got a speeding ticket for driving 108 miles per hour and was suspended by the 76ers for two games after in an altercation outside of a Boston nightclub with a heckler. \u201cSpeeding obviously is illegal,\u201d Okafor said. \u201cI know that\u2019s not what you\u2019re supposed to do.

He was criticized for recording a video of former Lakers teammate Nick Young that aired sordid details about Young\u2019s private life. The Lakers gave up on Russell and drafted Lonzo Ball as his replacement. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re similar in that we have a lot to prove,\u201d Okafor said. \u201cI know he\u2019s working his (butt) off as well.

We\u2019re definitely similar in that regard.\u201d Okafor understands he has areas to improve, mainly defense and rebounding. \u201cI\u2019m not a perfect player,\u201d Okafor said. \u201cI\u2019m 21.

Thompson practiced Monday, and as long as he recovers as expected, the Cavs will have their most tenacious rebounder and one of their best defenders back on the floor \u2013 but not as a starter. Cavs coach Tyronn Lue said Thompson will come off the bench, and Kevin Love will remain the starting center . The Cavs have won 14 of 15 and Lue doesn\u2019t want to disrupt the chemistry. That\u2019s cool with Thompson. \u201cIf I don\u2019t play, that\u2019s fine as long as we\u2019re winning I\u2019m going to cheer my teammates on,\u201d he said following Monday\u2019s workout at Cleveland Clinic Courts. \u201cIf I play two minutes, three minutes, 20 minutes, it don\u2019t matter to me. As long as we win.\u201d Since he\u2019s been out, the Cavs went 16-3 and have moved past some early-season growing pains with a dramatic improvement on defense. Lue has tinkered with his rotation, and Cleveland now has a second unit featuring Dwyane Wade, Kyle Korver and Channing Frye that helped the Cavs reel off 13 straight wins. Lue indicated Frye will continue to play, so it remains unclear how he will use Thompson, who has been one of Cleveland\u2019s most dependable players the past few years. \u201cTristan is a big part of what we do, so we gotta figure out how we got to use him,\u201d said Lue, who wouldn\u2019t divulge Thompson\u2019s new role. \u201cWe gotta do that so I have a plan in place and we\u2019ll see how it works.\u201d When Thompson was injured last month, the Cavs said they expected him to be out for a month with a strained left calf. Thompson quickly pointed out that not only was the team\u2019s public timetable inaccurate, but so was their medical diagnosis. \u201cThey told you guys three to four weeks,\u201d Thompson said to reporters. \u201cThat was never the case. The first week I was on crutches for a week so there was no chance. I don\u2019t know who told you three to four weeks. I feel bad. I\u2019m sorry. You all should have just asked me or DM\u2019d me. I would have told y\u2019all the truth.\u201d Thompson said his injury was \u201cworse\u201d than a strain, but he didn\u2019t want to elaborate. Thompson\u2019s straightforward approach has endeared him to Cleveland fans for seven seasons. A tireless worker at both ends of the court, Thompson played in 447 consecutive regular-season games before sitting out last April with a sprained thumb. He\u2019s averaged 9.8 points and 8.6 rebounds, but it\u2019s also been the little things that have made him invaluable for the three-time defending Eastern Conference champions. Being injured was tough on Thompson, who had never been out as long at any level. He missed the little things. Now that he\u2019s back, Thompson promised he\u2019ll do what he always has. \u201cJust play my game,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing special. Just be myself. Being myself has worked out pretty well for me I think.\u201d While Thompson has returned, the Cavs still don\u2019t have a clear date for point guard Isaiah Thomas to play after being sidelined all season with a hip injury. He took part in 3-on-3 drills Monday. The Cavs have roughly targeted his debut by the end of the month, but Lue said nothing is certain. \u201cI don\u2019t know when he\u2019s coming back,\u201d Lue said. \u201cI wish I did so you could quit asking me. I really do. I really wish I knew so I could share it. I\u2019m not hiding it.\u201d"},{"id":48302,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/boston-celtics-kyrie-irving-out-al-horford-questionable-vs-chicago-bulls","date":"2017-12-11","title":"Boston Celtics' Kyrie Irving out, Al Horford questionable; Chicago Bulls' Lauri Markkanen out","content":" The Boston Celtics will be without star point guard Kyrie Irving tonight against the Chicago Bulls ( 8 ET, NBA League Pass ) as he deals with a contusion on his left quadriceps.

Six teams, three in the East and three in the West, have won at least 70 percent of their games. They\u2019ve taken different paths to get here and, interestingly, all but one (the Toronto Raptors) have dealt with significant injuries along the way. Three of them (Boston, Cleveland and San Antonio) have been missing an All-Star all season, and two of those guys (Kawhi Leonard and Isaiah Thomas) were in the top five in MVP voting last season. Other teams could be knocking on the door. The Milwaukee Bucks are 11-4 with Eric Bledsoe and the Indiana Pacers have four wins over the top six. The Washington Wizards, meanwhile, are one of just five teams (Boston, Cleveland, Golden State and Houston are the others) that has a winning record (they\u2019re 7-4) in games played between teams that are currently over .500. And maybe the Oklahoma City Thunder will get on the same page one of these days. Since the Cavs got past their early struggles, each of the big six has generally taken care of business against lesser opponents. But we\u2019ve had just 11 games between the top six so far, with just one (the Spurs\u2019 win over the Celtics on Wednesday) in the last 24 days. (Each of the six teams has least one win and one loss in those 11 games.) We\u2019ll get No. 12 on Friday, when the Spurs (with Kawhi Leonard expected to have made his season debut) visit Houston for their first of four meetings with the Rockets. * * * Pace : Possessions per 48 minutes (League Rank) OffRtg : Points scored per 100 possessions (League Rank) DefRtg : Points allowed per 100 possessions (League Rank) NetRtg : Point differential per 100 possessions (League Rank) The league has averaged 99.9 possessions (per team) per 48 minutes and 105.1 points scored per 100 possessions this season. * * * NBA.com\u2019s Power Rankings, released every Monday during the season, are just one man\u2019s opinion.

The conceit was for Joel Embiid to look into the camera and praise his 76ers teammate Ben Simmons \u2014 at the expense of Shaquille O\u2019Neal \u2014 by affirming that Simmons was the best player to come out of LSU in the last 25 years. Of course, we all know that that distinction goes to \u201cThe Diesel.\u201d This is the point of the gag. But Embiid can\u2019t do it. \u201cShaq\u2019s my man,\u201d he says. And this is part of the 23-year-old Embiid\u2019s goofy charm; while he loudtalks his contemporaries, both in person and on Twitter, he\u2019s nothing but respectful to his big man elders, whether it\u2019s Shaq, Hakeem Olajuwon or David Robinson. Having that knowledge of past greats is also part of why Embiid is poised to join their ranks in due course, as long as he can stay healthy going forward. Injuries are the only reason he didn\u2019t go first overall in the 2014 Draft after his one season at Kansas. He slide to third and was scarfed up by then-Sixers GM Sam Hinkie, who felt Embiid fit in perfectly with Hinkie\u2019s notion of getting the most talent possible on his roster, no matter its current shape, and patiently waiting for that talent to explode. Embiid has, after fits and starts and surgeries delayed his NBA debut by two years. He was so dominant in 31 games last season \u2014 another injury-shortened campaign \u2014 that there was serious consideration by serious people to give him the Kia Rookie of the Year award anyway . Philly did that one better; despite the setbacks and worries about Embiid\u2019s future health, the Sixers didn\u2019t hesitate in putting a $148 million max deal on the table for Embiid in October. With his back account swole, Embiid has happily returned to displaying his breathtaking array of skills on the court \u2014 23.5 points, 11.1 rebounds, 3.2 assists, two blocks per game \u2014 that has Philly fans chanting \u201cTrust the Process\u201d every time Embiid touches the ball. No big has every displayed all of the above \u2014 low-post dominance, a feathery jumper that extends well past the 3-point line, the occasional Eurostep and lightning quickness on defense \u2014 that Embiid has in his bag. And, like Shaq, Embiid does all of that while dominating social media as well \u2014 courting Rihanna, picking Twitter fights with fellow bigs Andre Drummond and Hassan Whiteside, running \u201cRocky\u201d-style through the streets of Philly. Even DeMarcus Cousins likes him . And Embiid has the 76ers off to their best start in years, with the fans and buzz returning to Wells Fargo Center. Considering that Embiid, a native of Cameroon, started playing basketball just seven years ago, all of this is remarkable. With Ben Simmons looking like a lock for Kia Rookie of the Year, and 2017 first overall pick Markelle Fultz not even on the floor at full strength yet, the Sixers look to be a force for years to come. Which is right with Embiid\u2019s timeline. A decade or so should allow him to make his case for what he genuinely believes: he can be the best big man ever. Even better than Shaq. Me: Who did you want to meet at the SI Awards that you got to meet? Joel Embiid: Obviously, there was (Jose) Altuve. I went to the baseball game, the World Series, in Houston, so I got to witness, actually, when they won Game 5. That was a pretty good game. And I\u2019m a big fan of J.J. Watt, too. And Beyonce was there, so it was great. That was the first time seeing her in person. I met Jay-Z like the week before that. So that was great. Me: You and I spoke a couple of weeks ago, and I meant to ask then: how rewarding is it to be at the end of the The Process? JE: Well, The Process is never going to end. It\u2019s an ongoing thing. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ever going to stop. As I have explained before, it\u2019s a process for making it to the playoffs, it\u2019s another one to make the conference finals, another one to actually go to The Finals and win the championship. And when you actually win it, you\u2019ve got to come back the following year and do it all over again. So I don\u2019t think The Process is ever going to end. But at this point of The Process, it\u2019s rewarding. We\u2019ve been winning lately. We\u2019ve been playing well. We still have a long way to go, but I\u2019m excited about the future. Me: When you played the Lakers the first time, you had an historic game \u2014 46 points, 15 rebounds, seven assists, seven blocks . What was that like, being in a game where everything is working? JE: I was just playing basketball. I was making plays, my teammates were finding me. They were feeding me, I looked unstoppable, and I feel like I\u2019m unstoppable. So I kept going at it, and they tried to make adjustments, but I felt like it was too late. It was exciting in my head. The Lakers fans, they were talking (bleep) in the stands, and I love that. That got me going. So it was just, I don\u2019t know the feeling, but that was kind of like my first time going through that. Just bucket after bucket. It was different. Me: Why does trash talk motivate you so much? JE: \u2018Cause trash talk, I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s just in my nature. I love competing. I mean, if you ask anybody around me, my coaches, they know I love competing. I hate losing. So because I love competing and I hate losing, it just, I don\u2019t know, for somebody to actually trash talk with me, it\u2019s all about my game. Because I know I\u2019m unguardable. It just takes my game to the next level, and I feel like most nights I need it, or it\u2019s just going to be a lazy night, or sleepy night. So I actually kind of need it. Me: You seem to have a particular desire to go after your fellow bigs. And I wonder if that\u2019s calculated or not? JE: It\u2019s not calculated. It depends. If I play against you the first time, or it doesn\u2019t even have to be the first time, and you want to be all physical and just talk, or talking trash or whatever, it just gets me going. It makes me want to kick your ass so I can go on social media and literally trash you on there. So I want to trash you on the court and on social media. If you want to go down that road, good luck to you, because I don\u2019t stop, and I never stop. Me:  But you went after Drummond hard . You said he can\u2019t shoot. JE: Well, like I said, a lot of people don\u2019t know what actually goes into the game. The first matchup (with Detroit), I think I had 38 against him. He was all physical. He was talking a little bit. I don\u2019t think people see that. I made the statement that I made at the end of that game, that he couldn\u2019t play defense. Before the last game I played against him, they asked me if I was worried about what he was going to do offensively, and I just let them know how it is. And I\u2019m sure everybody knows that he couldn\u2019t shoot. He gets a lot of putback dunks. That\u2019s his game. Everybody knows this. So I just stated the truth. I don\u2019t know what else to say. Me: Do you have the sense that the medical team here has kind of taken the shackles off of you in terms of minutes and back to backs, or is there still a daily back and forth with them? JE: It\u2019s definitely has gotten a lot better. I\u2019m able to play a full game now. My only restriction is probably back to backs. I think the last month, month and a half, I\u2019ve been playing more than 30 minutes every night. So it\u2019s definitely getting better. I think the next step is obviously back to backs. I\u2019m just excited. Me: So when you hear the phrase \u2018load management,\u2019 what goes through your head? JE: Load management. I mean, there\u2019s a lot of meanings to that. (Laughs) In basketball, I guess, it\u2019s just making sure they\u2019re thinking about the future, too. They want me to play 20 years, so I get that, too. And I\u2019m really thankful to be in this type of position. I can get mad all I want, but at the end of the day, they care about me, and I respect that. Me: Sam Hinkie drafted you. Do you keep in touch with him, call, text? JE: Yeah, we text sometimes. We talk to each other sometimes. I mean, that\u2019s the guy that drafted me, and he made sure he put everything in place so I could get healthy. And I got healthy and I got back on the court. And I feel like he basically kind of lost his job because of me, because I missed two years. So I feel like I owe him a lot. Yeah, we talk. We talk sometimes. Me: What\u2019s the vibe like with you and Ben, on and off the court? JE: I mean, it\u2019s great. We\u2019re just learning, on the court, we\u2019re just learning to play with each other. Off the floor, we\u2019re just learning how to be leaders. Still, this is his first year. He\u2019s got a long way to go. I\u2019ve been in the league, this is my fourth year, and I think like I\u2019m the oldest on the team (in years with the franchise). Kind of being here a while, I\u2019ve seen all The Process, all the losing, and then now, we\u2019re winning. I\u2019ve seen everything here in Philly. We\u2019re still both really young, and we keep learning to play with each other. Me: You have said over and over that while you respect and revere Hakeem\u2019s game, you want to be the first Embiid and not the second Olajuwon. What does that specifically mean to you? JE: It just means, I think I\u2019m a different player than all those guys. Like I\u2019ve explained before, I\u2019m sure Hakeem could have shot the three a lot if he wanted to. But he didn\u2019t. But for me, my game is more about, more complete. He was a great defender, he\u2019s definitely better than me defensively. And offensively, the post moves he had, I\u2019ve got a long way to go to reach that level. But as far as, just like an overall game, I want to [have] one of the most, if not the most complete player ever. Defensively, offensively, just be a playmaker when I want to, score when I want to. Just a leader and defensively, be the best defensively player in the world. I\u2019m a big fan (of Olajuwon), and he knows that, too. But it\u2019s kind of like, it\u2019s different. He was really good. He was smooth. But I feel like I\u2019ve got everything, as far as the shot, post moves, defense. And he had that, too. Being physical, he was really athletic, too. There\u2019s a lot. But I\u2019ve got a long way to go. I\u2019m not there yet. I\u2019m not close to it. Me: When Fultz gets back on the floor and it\u2019s the three of you out there, what do you think you\u2019ll do? JE: I don\u2019t know. I know we started the year and he was coming off the bench. But I think he\u2019s going to be really good. I\u2019ve watched him, I\u2019ve been around him. He\u2019s kind of going through the same thing that I did, and that Ben did \u2014 people forgetting about you. And then, when you come back, boom \u2014 people are like, \u2018damn, what happened?\u2019 So I feel like he\u2019s in that boat, and I think he\u2019s going to be really good. But I think he\u2019s also, and Coach will figure it out, how to play with each other. And we also have to put in a lot of work to learn how to play with each other. Me: When they said \u2018we\u2019re going to give you the extension,\u2019 what went through your head? JE: First thing, I won\u2019t lie. I was like, I\u2019ve only played 31 games in three years. I think during those 31 games, I showed that I was, or I could be at that level. It was a weird situation, but that\u2019s not a situation you say no to. Because I\u2019m blessed to be in this position. For someone like me, who started playing basketball six years ago, missed two years because of injuries, I was just thankful for all those people, like the owners and the whole organization. It was, I was definitely shocked. \u2014 Bucks forward John Henson ( @Johnhenson31 ), Saturday, 11:38 a.m., after the news broke that the Miami Marlins \u2014 of whom Jeter is now CEO after his soon to be Hall of Fame playing career with the Yankees \u2014 had brokered a trade to send slugger Giancarlo Stanton to New York. \u201cMan, I don\u2019t care about \u2014 not to be rude \u2014 I don\u2019t care about no (bleeping) money. It\u2019s not about that. I\u2019ve saved up enough money. It\u2019s not about that. If I wanted to leave, I would have left. Like I said, coming back here, starting with rehab, that\u2019s my first step.\u201d \u2014 Derrick Rose , upon his return last week to the Cavaliers after being away from the team while he dealt with bone spurs in his ankle. Rose was asked if his shoe deal money, which he might have to forfeit if he retired, was a factor in his decision to come back to the team . \u201cNot in the second half, because we started thinking about ourselves too much. \u2018Oh, this guy missed me, or this guy didn\u2019t pass me the ball, or this guy didn\u2019t help me.\u2019 We started making too many excuses. And then we got a little bit lazy, we didn\u2019t have no urgency. I don\u2019t understand, when you lost, what was it, 12 out of 13 games, how guys can\u2019t have urgency. That to me is mind-boggling.\u201d \u2014 Marc Gasol , asked if his team played with effort in the Grizzlies\u2019 loss to Toronto Friday . After blowing a 20-point lead in another loss Saturday, to Oklahoma City, Memphis has dropped 14 of its last 15 and six of seven since firing former coach David Fizdale two weeks ago. \u201cIt\u2019s the most realistic basketball game you could ever play. I mix and match a lot of lineup changes to see how we can be really good. I\u2019ve done that.\u201d \u2014 LeBron James, detailing how he\u2019s learning Isaiah Thomas\u2019 game even though Thomas remains out as he rehabs his injured hip, by playing NBA2K18 .

From Vitor Camargo:  Man, y\u2019all are harsh on J-Kidd. Second week in a row I\u2019ve gotten a letter from an unsatisfied Bucks customer. Frankly, I don\u2019t get it, and especially now; Milwaukee\u2019s won seven of its last 10 and is in fourth place in the Eastern Conference, which I think is impressive. The Land of 10,000 Lakes, and a couple of holes on the pine. From Jeff Pryor: Well, Noel would have certainly been an option before he tore a ligament in his left thumb and needed surgery last Friday; he\u2019s expected to be out two months. He is nonetheless eligible to be traded as of this coming Friday, when many of the players who signed deals this summer are free to be dealt by their incumbent teams. Muhammad is also eligible to be traded as of Friday, and it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if Minnesota inquired about moving him for that very bench piece you think they need. I\u2019d be surprised if the Wolves were serious suitors for Jordan, given they\u2019ve taken on the rest of Jimmy Butler\u2019s max deal, just maxed Andrew Wiggins themselves and will soon have to do the same with Karl-Anthony Towns. I\u2019d think they\u2019d go for a less-expensive option. For example and not based on information, a Willie Reed-type of big (Reed signed a one-year minimum deal with the LA Clippers, and given that Reed was a client of now-shuttered agent Andy Miller, Reed is no doubt looking for a higher-profile gig off the bench than the Clippers provide). Maybe Ersan Ilyasova from the Atlanta Hawks; he\u2019s had a couple of huge offensive games of late for the Hawks, and we know he certainly isn\u2019t averse to taking charges ; that\u2019s right up Thibs\u2019s alley. The Sixth Vleet is ashore. From Jimmy Chow: Fred\u2019s having a solid season, Jimmy, and the big jump clearly is in offensive rating, which is nine points better than it was last season. (His overall field goal percentage is up, even while his 3-point percentage is down so far compared to last season.) It would be hard for me to give him Sixth Man just off of Net Rating, though you make a good case for it. It will also be hard to overcome the penchant for giving the award to scorers off the bench \u2014 not that that has to be the only way to judge how effective a reserve player is.

(Last week\u2019s averages in parenthesis) 1) James Harden (38.5 ppg, 6.5 rpg, 3 apg, .500 FG, .913 FT): Saturday\u2019s 48-piece at Portland was, amazingly, Harden\u2019s 40th game since being traded to the Rockets in 2012 with 40 or more points. 2) LeBron James (28.5 ppg, 10.3 rpg, 9 apg, .538 FG, .741 FT): Collected his 58th career triple-double in Saturday\u2019s win over Philadelphia, leaving him one short of Larry Bird for sixth place on the NBA\u2019s all-time list. 3) Giannis Antetokounmpo (32.3 ppg, 10.8 rpg, 4.5 apg, .543 FG, .830 FT): The most unheralded part of the Freak\u2019s game: he gets to the foul line in bunches: 47 attempts in four games this week. 4) Kevin Durant (30 ppg, 9.3 rpg, 7.3 apg, .458 FG, .895 FT): With 46 blocked shots in his first 22 games this season, Durant is on pace to obliterate his previous single-season high of 105 blocks, set in 2012-13 with Oklahoma City. 5) Kyrie Irving (26.8 ppg, 2.5 rpg, 2.5 apg, .533 FG, .938 FT): If he keeps sticking the three as he has of late, it\u2019s a wrap. Really, it\u2019s a wrap, anyway; there\u2019s no stopping him from where he wants to go with the ball. 3 \u2014 Home wins this season for the Hawks, who got their third win in 12 games so far at Philips Arena Saturday, over Orlando. Atlanta hasn\u2019t had a home campaign under .500 since the 2006-07 season, when it was 18-23 at Philips. That was also the last time the Hawks didn\u2019t make the playoffs. 4 \u2014 Number of teams \u2014 Indiana, Washington, Orlando and Memphis \u2014 that have yet to post a single double-figure win streak in a season. By contrast, Cleveland\u2019s 13-game win streak, which ended with a loss at the Pacers Wednesday, was the 11th win streak of 10 games or more in Cavaliers\u2019 history. 9 \u2014 Consecutive victories at Staples Center by the Clippers over the Wizards, including last Saturday\u2019s bizarre ending where Lou Williams hit a go-ahead three with 1.2 seconds left. After a timeout\/advance, the clock started inadvertently before Bradley Beal shot what would have been a game-winner at the buzzer, but after a video review, the time was restored (even though it shouldn\u2019t have been). But the Clips survived anyway. The Wizards\u2019 last road win over the Clips was on Jan. 31, 2009. 1 ) Victor Oladipo and the Pacers have made a lot of people, starting with me, who thought they\u2019d fall off the face of the earth after trading Paul George look foolish so far this season. 2) Good for the Sixers to finally pull the trigger and end Jahlil Okafor\u2019s penance. It surely wasn\u2019t the deal they\u2019d hoped for, but Trevor Booker is a solid, professional big man who\u2019ll give you an honest night\u2019s work on the floor and not a scintilla of trouble off of it \u2014 another good vet for the Sixers\u2019 locker room. And Okafor, along with Nik Stauskas, will finally get some real playing time in Brooklyn and a chance to regain the form that made him a first team all-America at Duke. 3) Kenny J. Israel, Esq. Opening Friday at a theatre near you. 4) Great reporting and writing from Scott Cacciola of The New York Times  on the Warriors\u2019 unsung hero . 1) I thought the Thunder would figure things out quickly, and that it wouldn\u2019t take much time for Russell Westbrook, Paul George and Carmelo Anthony to get on the same page. I was wrong. 2) RIP, Roland \u201cFatty\u201d Taylor, an outstanding defensive point guard for really good ABA teams \u2014 he is the ABA\u2019s all-time leader in steals, at 803 \u2014 in the \u201870s, including the Virginia Squires and Denver Nuggets. (He also has been given credit for giving George Gervin, his Squires teammate, the nickname \u201cThe Iceman.\u201d) Another in the long line of great Washington, D.C. ballers, Taylor played at La Salle before going to the pros. 3) Happy that police finally found a suspect in Lorenzen Wright\u2019s murder , but this just reminds you how tragic his death was in the first place. 4) Add Devin Booker and Aaron Gordon to this year\u2019s butcher\u2019s block of high-profile injuries. Just an awful season so far when it comes to long-term pains. * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

Short answer: probably not. But it isn\u2019t a step backward either. The NHL confirmed what had been rumored for months at its Board of Governors meeting \u2014 Seattle is a definite target for hockey, which has 31 teams and needs a 32nd to balance out both its conferences and its schedules. The NHL will allow members of the Oak View Group, which successfully lobbied the Seattle City Council to approve its plan to spend $660 million to renovate both the Arena and the nearby Seattle Center, to begin a season ticket drive for the potential expansion team. Hockey\u2019s timetable for expansion is thus clearly and substantially ahead of the NBA\u2019s. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean we have granted an expansion team,\u201d NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman told NHL.com following the Board of Governors meeting. \u201cWe have agreed as a league to take and consider an expansion application and to let them run in the next few months a season-ticket drive.\u201d Though NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said earlier this year that he believes expansion is \u201cinevitable,\u201d there is no indication among league owners and other sources that there\u2019s any current appetite among NBA owners to add one or two new teams. The obvious reason why is there is no appetite among them to further split the $24 billion from the new national TV deal, which runs through 2024. (As ever, in the interests of full disclosure: Turner Sports, one of the NBA\u2019s national television partners along with ESPN\/ABC, runs NBA.com.) \u201cI don\u2019t see expansion,\u201d one owner said this weekend. \u201cA move is the only way.\u201d  However, longtime Seattle sport columnist Art Thiel wrote last week that a source \u201cwith knowledge of the league\u2019s long-range thinking\u201d believes the NBA could expand when the current TV deal expires, meaning 2025 at the absolute earliest. Several owners told me a few weeks ago : that while there is strong support for Seattle, there\u2019s just no desire to expand. * Aldridge:  Seattle has solid shot at NBA return, just not anytime soon Thiel\u2019s source said that Seattle and Mexico City were the two current favorites among owners, and the league has done nothing to dissuade the idea that it\u2019s zeroed in on Mexico City as a potential expansion target . But another said Sunday that talk of adding anyone to the current 30-team mix is premature. Owners remain unenthusiastic when there are still several teams who are losing money in their current markets, even with significant increases in revenues, a new Collective Bargaining Agreement that ensures labor peace through at least 2023 (2024 if neither the players nor owners opt out) and enhanced revenue sharing. \u201cWe haven\u2019t discussed expansion,\u201d the owner said. \u201cHowever, Seattle is a market that I believe the majority of owners would want to be in.\u201d The Seattle City Council voted 7-1 last Monday to approve a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that will give the Oak View Group the go-ahead to spend $660 million to renovate both Key Arena and the Seattle Center, the historic, 74-acre former fairgrounds of the 1962 World\u2019s Fair that encompasses Key Arena and the city\u2019s iconic Space Needle and monorail, and includes dozens of cultural, artistic and scientific venues and restaurants. About $40 million of that money would be used to try and develop plans to alleviate what was already extremely tight parking in and around Key when the Sonics played there, and which has only gotten worse as the Queen Anne neighborhood has expanded since the team left. The behemoth Amazon is headquartered about a mile from Key Arena . https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v A renovated Key Arena would open in 2020 and seat 18,350 for NBA games, 17,100 for NHL games and more than 19,000 for concerts. Oak View was created by former AEG executive Tim Leiweke, who was central to the construction of Staples Center and other modern NBA buildings, and music and entertainment mogul Irving Azoff. The two have access to billions in capital and know the major players in both the NBA and NHL, with Leiweke\u2019s most recent foray into both coming when he headed Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment until 2013. That has allowed Oak View to overtake billionaire hedge fund manager Chris Hansen and his group\u2019s plans to build an arena in the South Downtown (SoDo) section of town. Oak View also beat out Leiweke\u2019s old company, AEG, which made an arena proposal in Seattle as well. Hansen\u2019s group includes members of the retail store Nordstrom\u2019s family, as well as Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson. Hansen had an MOU with the city dating back to his efforts to buy and move the Sacramento Kings in 2014. But the NBA opted to keep the Kings in Sacramento , getting behind a public-private arena initiative pushed by then-mayor and former NBA player Kevin Johnson. That led to the construction of what is now Golden 1 Center in downtown Sacramento. The NBA then pushed through a sale of the Kings to a group led by billionaire Vivek Ranadive. Hansen continued to buy land in SoDo and worked toward getting Council approval for construction of a $550 million arena that would be completely financed privately. But his hopes were dealt a major blow when the Council voted 5-4 against him last April to allow a vacation of a crucial city block that Hansen needs to begin construction. Hansen\u2019s MOU with the city expired earlier this month; Oak View\u2019s MOU was then quickly approved. Hansen\u2019s group is nonetheless still trying to get the vacation approved and have both buildings go up, arguing that a) construction on their arena would not begin until the NBA officially approved a franchise for Seattle, and b) a Key renovation that led to an NHL team getting in first would make a potential NBA team a lesser tenant there. (Seattle\u2019s new mayor, Jenny Durkan, said as she signed the MOU with Oak View last week that the Key deal did not preclude the construction of another arena in the city. ) Before the NHL made its announcement regarding potential expansion, Leiweke reiterated that a refurbished Key Arena would be compatible both for NBA and NHL teams. \u201cThis particular building will, not only from a design standpoint, from a space standpoint, from an economic standpoint, it is build for both the NBA and the NHL,\u201d Leiweke told longtime Seattle TV reporter Chris Daniels last week on Daniel\u2019s \u201cNext Best Podcast\u201d with co-host Chris Cashman . \u201cIt will meet, and beat, all standards for both the NBA and the NHL \u2014 for broadcasting, for seating manifest, for suites, and for our building to generate revenue,\u201d Leiweke told Daniels. \u201cIn fact, we\u2019ve gone out of our way to design the building such so that there are very specific areas in the building, including the club seats \u2014 there\u2019s 2200 club seats for hockey, and more for basketball. And that was literally designed to make sure we protect the economics of both the NBA and the NHL.\u201d But Leiweke also went to great pains to say he didn\u2019t want \u201cto get ahead of the Commissioners\u201d in either the NHL or the NBA in speculating about his group\u2019s chances of getting a franchise in either sport. \u201cYou don\u2019t hear about the NBA (as a potential tenant) because they\u2019re not expanding,\u201d Leiweke told Daniels. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019ve lost interest or we\u2019re not focused, or we\u2019re not talking to the Commissioner. But, again, we follow his lead. And Adam Silver\u2019s made it very clear that right now, expansion\u2019s not a conversation. When it is, we\u2019ll be first in line.\u201d That\u2019s basically what a third NBA owner said as well: a new Key Arena \u201cwill make it a viable destination if and when we do look at expansion,\u201d the owner said. There is some thought that owners may be more inclined to look at expansion if the next TV deal isn\u2019t quite as lucrative as the current one. With cord-cutting continuing to impact the number of cable TV subscribers, there may be a need to find new revenue streams in seven or eight years that wouldn\u2019t seem necessary now. It wasn\u2019t that long ago that a worldwide recession impacted the profit margins of a lot of NBA owners. It\u2019s crazy to think a similar economic turndown isn\u2019t possible. Yet no one is ready to put any kind of time frame on expansion. So Seattle is left with looking \u2014 potentially \u2014 at either New Orleans or Memphis, the only two NBA cities that have even a sliver of daylight that could lead to a move in the next decade. And both of those would be very difficult lifts. Memphis is in the midst of an ownership showdown between the Grizzlies current majority owner, Robert Pera, and minority owners Steve Kaplan and Daniel Straus. Kaplan and\/or Straus exercised a \u201cbuy\/sell\u201d option last month that allows them to set a potential sale price for the Grizzlies, who sold to a group headed by Pera for $377 million. (Pera owns about 25 percent of the team; Kaplan and Straus each own about 14 percent.) Under the buy\/sell, either man could set a price for the team, leaving Pera with two options: either buy them out at their percentage of ownership of the price, or sell them his share at his percentage of ownership of the price. If the price for the team was set at $1.2 billion, Pera would have to buy them out at their stake \u2014 14 percent apiece \u2014 of $1.2 billion, or sell them his stake in the team \u2014 25 percent of $1.2 billion. That process will take between two and three months. But even if Kaplan were to buy the team outright from Pera, the team can\u2019t leave FedEx Forum under terms of the lease with the city until at least 2021. And the other minority owners, almost all local, would still have the right to buy the team from anyone who petitioned the league to move the Grizzlies out of town before 2027. (Several stories detailing the players and potential transactions here , here and here . The New Orleans Pelicans\u2019 current lease with the state of Louisiana binds them to the Smoothie King Center until 2024. And while the front office has made moves like bringing in DeMarcus Cousins, Rajon Rondo and Tony Allen in the last few months, leading to improved play on the court, the Pelicans still are struggling to draw crowds \u2014 they\u2019re currently 24th in the league this year in attendance (16,251), just ahead of \u2026 the Grizzlies . The Pelicans\u2019 marketing folks are trying all they can think of to goose attendance , but it remains an uphill climb, with the NFL\u2019s New Orleans Saints always looming as the big sport in town. Neither the Grizzlies nor Pelicans are leaving their respective cities any time soon, though. Nor is the NBA expanding any time soon. But any step toward a building actually being built in Seattle is a step toward the return of the NBA there. It\u2019s a tiny one. But it\u2019s better than nothing. * * * MORE MORNING TIP:  Adventures of a fired coach | DA\u2019s Top 15 Rankings | Q&A: Joel Embiid * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

Not all coaches adhere to it, but it\u2019s common for a key player who\u2019s gotten hurt in the line of duty to be ushered back into his usual role regardless of how well a replacement has played. But can a team offer the same assurance to a star and his spotlight? OK, so maybe that\u2019s a bit melodramatic, but the way Bradley Beal has played lately for the Washington Wizards, the sooner-rather-than-later return of All-Star point guard John Wall from left knee issues is a potential issue of ball and scoring sharing. Given the 110 points Beal has poured in over Washington\u2019s past three games, no one associated with the Wizards wants to see the shooting guard suddenly go cold or get shy. Least of all Wall, writes Candace Buckner of The Washington Post : Being handed the keys to Washington\u2019s offense in Wall\u2019s absence, and playing with aggression, have been vital to Beal\u2019s hot stretch.

When I hung up, my wife said to me, \u2018Hon, you\u2019re getting fired. I heard you talking to Mr. Davidson about decisions that had been made. You just can\u2019t do that. You can\u2019t talk to an owner like that.\u2019 Sure enough, the next morning, while I was getting ready to go in and coach against Dr. J and the Philadelphia 76ers, my administrative assistant, Madelon Hazy, called. She said \u2018Before you go to practice, Bill Davidson is going to come to your house.\u2019 \u201cI\u2019m going to go around the block until the limousine leaves,\u201d Lorraine said to me, \u201cbut I\u2019m telling you now, prepare yourself. You\u2019re getting fired.\u201d I replied, \u201cNo way. Everybody knows we\u2019ve got a team full of young kids. We\u2019re rebuilding. But we\u2019re creating some excitement and we\u2019re getting good fan interest.\u201d Come on, guys, we should all listen to our wives. Davidson came into the house, and in a low-key way, he said, \u2018Dick, I just made a coaching change.\u2019 \u201cExcuse me,\u201d I wondered aloud, \u201ca coaching change?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve been fired.\u201d I couldn\u2019t get over it. I\u2019d had such a skyrocketing career, going from teaching sixth grade all the way to coaching the Pistons. And then it was all pulled away from me. It was tough, man \u2026 People always say that I\u2019m the head of the coaches\u2019 fraternity, always singing their praises. Well, let me tell you why. If you\u2019re fired from the NBA or fired from a major college job, it is just incredibly difficult to get back to that same level. If you were to keep track of the number of guys who got fired, then made it back to the top, the number is very small. And I\u2019m not one of them. \u2014 Dick Vitale, \u201cLiving a Dream\u201d * * * The clich\u00e9 is so old and hoary, no one seems to know for sure who said it first. But it was true when it was first uttered, and remains so: coaches are hired to be fired. That doesn\u2019t make that meeting, that ending, any easier. Most of us who\u2019ve ever held a job have been fired from one of them or another over the course of a lifetime. I\u2019ve been fired; you probably have been, too. But almost all of us were dismissed in anonymity, with only a handful of people knowing, and we quickly moved on to the next job \u2014 which might be in an altogether different discipline or industry. That is not what happens to a coach, and an NBA coach in particular. The gig is one of the most public jobs in the world. When one is eminently successful at it, for whatever reason \u2014 great players, great ownership, great job motivating and teaching \u2014 they can wind up in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. But when one is not successful, for whatever reason \u2014 bad or young players, poor ownership, regressing as a teacher and\/or motivator \u2014 there\u2019s nowhere to hide. And when it ends, the years of grinding and buidling, of pleading, cajoling, arguing, of being in an emotional bunker for months at a time are hard to suppress.  \u201cThe first stage is the anger stage, and the justification stage,\u201d says Mike Fratello, one of the NBA\u2019s most successful coaches of the last 30 years, with 667 wins over 17 seasons. \u201cYou\u2019re looking at the job you did and saying \u2018hey, I didn\u2019t have my best (bleeping) player all year,\u2019\u201d he said, referring to his last job, in Memphis, where he was fired in 2006 \u2014 without his All-Star forward, Pau Gasol. \u201cI was on my mother\u2019s couch at 3 in the morning watching the World Championships (in August, 2006, about a month before NBA camps opened), and he\u2019s playing for Spain, and he grabs his foot, and I say, \u2018he just broke his foot,\u2019\u201d Fratello said. \u201cWe had played him during the season before, and he had, like, this black line on his foot, but he finished out the rest of the season.\u201d Without Gasol, the Grizzlies, who\u2019d won 49 games the season before, started 6-24 . And Fratello, a former NBA Coach of the Year with the Hawks, lost his job. \u201cThe taste is bitter in your mouth when it first happens, depending on what the circumstances are,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of guys have places they go to, a place in Florida or a place in California. They\u2019ll just go and get away. Sometimes they get away from their families; sometimes they get away by themselves. They return the calls of the people they need to talk to, People want to call and say \u2018I\u2019m sorry.\u2019 But you can\u2019t call everybody back. You find comfort in your friends, your really close friends. Sometimes you spill your guts to the one or two people you know can keep it to themselves.\u201d  Indeed, another now former Grizzlies coach, David Fizdale, fired last month by Memphis , went home to decompress in his native California \u2014 where he hadn\u2019t lived in more than 20 years. The shock to the system after getting fired is immense. \u201cYou go from a schedule that is all-consuming and really, you\u2019re talking about 12-to 14-hour days, to basically not doing anything,\u201d says Dallas Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle, the president of the National Basketball Coaches Association. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a challenge. That\u2019s a big challenge. Carlisle, like almost everyone in his line of work, also survived being fired. In Detroit, he posted back to back 50-win seasons in two seasons, was NBA Coach of the Year in his first season (2001-02) and made the Eastern Conference finals his second, yet was fired after the second. In Indiana, his Pacers won 61 games in his first season , but were devastated by age, injuries and the aftermath of the brawl at Auburn Hills in 2004 . \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re there,\u201d Carlisle said of the coaches\u2019 union. \u201cI\u2019ve been through it. We\u2019ve had a lot of guys through the years that have been through these situations. The person involved has to take a deep breath, and he has to have the proper support and guidance. We all get into this knowing there\u2019s a high level of expectation. It\u2019s a very binary and high stakes business, and termination is one of the risks of a dynamic business.\u201d Coaches know that almost none of them get to leave on their terms.  \u201cYou understand that\u2019s part of the equation,\u201d said Lionel Hollins. He had two coaching stints with the Grizzlies (1999-2000; 2008-13) and one with the Brooklyn Nets (\u201814-16) that ended in termination. His second Memphis firing came after he\u2019d won 56 regular-season games and taken the Grizzlies to their first Western Conference finals . \u201cI\u2019ve been fired as an assistant coach, or not brought back; your contract runs out and they already know they\u2019re still going to fire you and not bring you back, so they say they\u2019re not going to renew your contract,\u201d Hollins said. \u201cThat happened to me twice, both in Vancouver and when I was with the Suns. I was fired in Vancouver after being the interim coach for 60 games. In those situations, it wasn\u2019t hard to take \u2026 \u201cThe only time when it\u2019s tough is \u2026 there\u2019s two reasons it\u2019s tough. One is when you think you\u2019ve done a good enough job, and the second part is when a lot of negative news is circulated to justify the move. I can take firing; it\u2019s not a problem to me. But when there\u2019s stuff written every day, and leaked every day, to paint you as being a bad person or a bad coach or however they paint it, then that bothers me. But as a coach, you have to deal with all of this, and you have to be secure in who you are. You have to do what you think is right.\u201d Hollins, too, was uncertain in the initial days following his dismissal in Memphis. \u201cIt takes you a while to come to grips with the reality, and also get your life on track doing something other than what you\u2019ve been doing every day,\u201d he said. \u201cYou get up, you have meetings, you go to work, you have meetings, you work out, you get with the team, you have practice, you have more meetings, you watch film, you\u2019re doing all of that. And one day you wake up and you don\u2019t have to do any of that. It is a shock to your system \u2014 your psyche, your body, everything. It takes you a while to adjust to not doing anything. I stayed in my bed for three or four days and stayed in the house and (didn\u2019t) go out \u2014 not because I was embarrassed, but because I didn\u2019t know what to do.\u201d By contrast, after former Raptors and Timberwolves coach Sam Mitchell\u2019s stints ended in Toronto (2009) and Minnesota (2016), he went traveling with his family, did things that he wouldn\u2019t have been able to do had he still been grinding at the job. \u201cFirst of all, you feel a little embarrassed,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cBasically, someone is saying that you weren\u2019t good enough, or you didn\u2019t do your job good enough. And then, if you get fired during the season (as Mitchell was, 17 games into the 2008-09 season by the Raptors ), the weird thing is, your staff stays. Your staff\u2019s intact, and you\u2019re the one that\u2019s getting fired, so you\u2019re the one going into your office cleaning out your desk. It bothers you. It really does. And then you have to take a minute and sit back, and you try to figure out why.\u201d Mitchell believes his season at the helm in Minnesota helped pave the future for this year\u2019s Timberwolves. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for some of the things we did in Minnesota, there wouldn\u2019t be a Jimmy Butler\u201d there, he says. \u201cBecause if we wouldn\u2019t have played Zach LaVine, and given him an opportunity to grow and develop, Chicago wouldn\u2019t have traded for him. They wouldn\u2019t have traded an established All-Star for a guy who hadn\u2019t shown his potential. So you just have to look at it from the standpoint that you\u2019ve dome your job, and you hope that other people around the league realize that you did your job \u2014 even to the detriment of you.\u201d After he was fired by the Nets in 2016, Hollins sought internal answers rather than external ones. He was marketing his e-commerce business, I Train Fundamentals , at the Final Four in Phoenix last March when he was introduced to Peak Performance, a company designed for self-improvement in multiple areas. \u201cWe covered almost every situation I was in,\u201d Hollins said, \u201cin terms of, what did you do here, and did you do the same thing over here? And what was successful over here, and what was not successful over here? So you\u2019re taking every situation, and you\u2019re highlighting all that you can remember in your mind that was good, and you\u2019re taking all that was bad. And there\u2019s some things that were good that, when you go to another situation, you have to do differently, and make the adjustment.\u201d The year-plus lull in NBA coaching firings \u2014 there were none in the 2016-17 season, the first time that had happened since 1971 \u2014 was abruptly ended when Phoenix fired Earl Watson on October 22 just three games into the season . Fizdale\u2019s ouster came with Memphis at 7-12, coming off bad home losses to the lowly Mavericks and Nets. While Fizdale\u2019s deteriorating relationship with Marc Gasol was cited as a chief reason for his dismissal, the Grizzlies didn\u2019t spend a lot of time discussing the matter internally, either with the players or with the team\u2019s interim coach, J.B. Bickerstaff \u2014 which is part of the dilemma for coaches: often, they don\u2019t know exactly what went wrong. \u201cI didn\u2019t go into any great explanation,\u201d Grizzlies General Manager Chris Wallace said after the firing. \u201cI just said change has been made and J.B. has our full support. We can get the season back. Whenever there\u2019s a change situation, I stole this line from my old boss Pat Riley \u2014 when change rears its inevitable head, embrace it and run with it.\u201d The NBCA gets right to work when a coach is let go. Two full-time in-house lawyers meet with the fired coach and their representatives within 24 hours, to go over what the terms of their contracts entitle them. Most teams, for example, put \u201coffset\u201d language into the standard coach contract; if a coach signs a contract with a new team, the new team pays part of the remaining money the coach is owed by his old team. And the union works with the coach and his or her agent\/attorney to help them work out whatever statement they want to make to the media. That\u2019s generally the preferred method for coaches these days, a far cry from when Fratello resigned from the Hawks in 1990 , under pressure after not making the playoffs for the first time in five years. \u201cI had a lengthy press conference the morning I got fired with Stan Kasten, who was the general manager,\u201d Fratello said. \u201cHe\u2019s sitting there, saying about me, \u2018he\u2019s been here four years as a head coach, seven as an assistant before that.\u2019 He\u2019s crying; I\u2019m crying, we\u2019re crying together. In Memphis, and in Cleveland, I handled it differently. I put out a statement thanking the players and the ownership; I didn\u2019t want to put myself out there answering all those questions. Because nothing was changing.\u201d After the legalese is worked out between the coach, their representatives and the team, the reconstruction begins. While the phrase \u201cout of sight, out of mind\u201d terrifies a lot of coaches after they\u2019re fired, many take extended time off, not only to recharge their batteries physically, but to clear their minds to new ideas. If you look around NBA training camps, you often find a former head coach there. \u201cFor most of the coaches, I think a little bit of time off is usually good,\u201d says David Fogel, the Executive Director of the NBCA. \u201cNot necessarily being away from the game, but maybe just being away from the coaching spotlight. I know with Rick, I believe he took a sabbatical and sort of went around the league, and learned from other coaches, what worked for some of the greats, and how he can incorporate that to make himself a better coach. But for others, whether it\u2019s Kevin McHale or Sam Mitchell or Jeff Van Gundy, they find homes in broadcasting and sort of being around the game, which tends to be a great springboard when you\u2019re trying to get back in to another really good opportunity later on.\u201d  Indeed, Fratello became known as the \u201cCzar of the Telestrator\u201d during his high-profile years with Marv Albert on NBC\u2019s broadcasts of NBA games in the early 1990s. It introduced him to a new audience, and kept his name out there with GMs and other decision makers. And, it was all a happy accident. \u201cNBC winds up outbidding CBS for the rights to the NBA,\u201d Fratello said. \u201cIt was the first time NBC was going to do basketball. They had never done it before and they were hiring everybody who had done it before. So the voice of the broadcast was going to be Marv Albert, and the color guys on the A and B teams were going to be Pat Riley and Chuck Daly. They called my agent and asked if I\u2019d like to audition for the sideline job. That\u2019s it. Nothing else. Sideline reporter. I go in and do the interview. I\u2019m interviewed in the middle of the newsroom of NBC on the edge of a chair, and the guy interviewing me is Bob Costas.\u201d But while Fratello was waiting to hear about the sideline gig, Daly dropped out over money, and Riley said he didn\u2019t want to do color on games; he wanted to work in the studio. So Fratello\u2019s agent called him. \u201cHe said, \u2018you\u2019ll never guess who their top choice is for the number one analyst job,\u2019 \u201d Fratello recalled. \u201cI said, \u2018who?\u2019 He said, \u2018you.\u2019 \u201d After working from 1990-93 on NBC\u2019s top crew, Fratello called Cleveland GM Wayne Embry. Lenny Wilkens had just resigned as coach of the Cavaliers, who were still a contender in the Eastern Conference. \u201cWayne said, \u2018I was going to call you tomorrow morning,\u2019 \u201d Fratello said. The Cavaliers hired him a few weeks later; he won 248 games there in six seasons, including the lockout-shortened 1999-2000 season. Carlisle\u2019s year off helped him immensely when he took the Mavericks job in 2008 . \u201cIt\u2019s valuable on multiple levels,\u201d he said. \u201cNumber one, you\u2019re staying active and you are learning. Number two, you\u2019re in a situation where you\u2019re not in the foxhole. You can take more of a broad view of things. One of the challenges with NBA coaching is it\u2019s such a crucible, keeping your eye on the big picture is very challenging \u2026 the worst thing to do if you\u2019re let go is to disappear and just go sit in a hole. That\u2019s not healthy. It\u2019s good to decompress and take a little bit of time. But ultimately, staying active and staying in a growth pattern is very important.\u201d And, the head coach is often not the only person who loses their job. \u201cThe head coaches typically have great agents and great attorneys,\u201d Fogel said. \u201cFor the assistants, these could be much younger coaches in their early 30s that might not necessarily have the kind of financial security or support that most of the head coaches do. That\u2019s really where we at the Coaches Association are needed the most. On that level, if there\u2019s a young assistant coach, that\u2019s where we might take a more formal approach. I\u2019ll usually connect them with Rick and have them talk and see what their next best move might be.\u201d The union is addressing the idea of continuing education for coaches between jobs by developing a series of short form digital teaching vignettes, a virtual, ongoing digital curriculum and continuing education \u2014 \u201cnot only Xs and Os, or defensive strategies, but also coaching philosophies,\u201d Fogel said, \u201chow each and every one of these head coaches got to their position, who helped them out along the way, who their coaching trees are.\u201d The head coach also has to take solace in the fact that leading a team to a championship may not have ever been in his job description. \u201cWe almost doubled the win total (in Minnesota). My young players got better,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cWe improved offensively and defensively. When something like that happens, it knocks the wind out of you a little bit, and then, after a few days, you just have to sit back and say \u2018this is the business I chose. I understand that coaching is not one of the most secure jobs, especially you\u2019re coaching professional basketball or any professional sport. And then you just have to put it in perspective. The thing that I felt good about, in both situations \u2014 I did my job. We wasn\u2019t going to make the playoffs in Minnesota. My job was to get these young guys ready to play.\u201d And if Dick Vitale never got another chance at running an NBA team, that is not how most fired coaches think they\u2019re going out. As painful as getting fired is, there isn\u2019t a former head coach who doesn\u2019t burn for another chance. \u201cIf you think it\u2019s tough being that consumed with that level of responsibility,\u201d Carlisle said, \u201cwait \u2018till you see how it is not having it.\u201d * * * MORE MORNING TIP:  DA\u2019s Top 15 Rankings | Seattle\u2019s hopes for NBA return brighten a bit | Q&A: Joel Embiid * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

Clippers beat Washington Wizards in wild finish with clock error","content":"LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 The way things have been going for the struggling Clippers, it figures a wild finish involving an arcane clock rule would be the way they\u2019d finally win again. Lou Williams hit a go-ahead pull-up 3-pointer with 1.2 seconds remaining, lifting Los Angeles to a 113-112 victory over the Washington Wizards on Saturday to end a four-game skid. \u201cNothing has been easy,\u201d coach Doc Rivers said. With Bradley Beal guarding him, Williams unleashed the winner from the top of the key, capping a wild final 12 seconds in which both teams traded leads on clutch plays. \u201cI made a move and Bradley bit on it,\u201d Williams said. \u201cI was able to pull up with one dribble. If I go left, I like my chances.\u201d After Williams\u2019 basket, the Wizards called a timeout. They inbounded the ball on the sideline with 1.2 seconds left and Beal hit the potential winning baseline jumper, which was waived off because the game clock started a couple tenths of a second too soon. After a video review, the referees decided to give Washington possession for a replay, except the Wizards inbounded in the left corner with 1.1 seconds on the clock. Marcin Gortat\u2019s jumper bounced off the rim as time expired. Crew chief Bill Spooner told a pool reporter after the game that the referees incorrectly reset the shot clock to 1.1 seconds instead of 0.1. Spooner said the location of the inbounds changed to the point of interruption where Beal caught the ball. \u201cWe had a clock malfunction, early start,\u201d Spooner said in a statement. \u201cThe time that they lost was 1.1. With an inbounds at 1.2 that leaves, mathematically, 0.1 and that should have been where we reset it. We actually made the mistake in their favor if you will, and reset it at 1.1.\u201d Wizards coach Scott Brooks wasn\u2019t upset about the mistake. \u201cI never complain about tough decisions and tough plays at the end of the game that referees have to make,\u201d he said. Beal called it \u201ca freak rule\u201d and said it didn\u2019t make sense because the Wizards had his basket taken away. \u201cWe had a great play, now that you take that away that gives the defense a chance to set up now to change some things,\u201d he said. \u201cNow we\u2019ve got to go back and try to change into a different play with the ball in the corner. He said we get the same amount of time, but we didn\u2019t get the same amount of time. Then the ball was placed in the corner. So I don\u2019t really understand it.\u201d Rivers said he wasn\u2019t sure what triggered the review. \u201cI just wanted it to go in our favor and it did,\u201d he said. \u201cWe showed a lot of heart.\u201d Williams scored 35 points to lead a dominant bench effort for the Clippers. Their reserves outscored Washington\u2019s 59-47. Beal scored 20 of his 25 points in the second half. Otto Porter Jr. had 27 points and 11 rebounds, and Mike Scott had 22 points off the bench for the Southeast Division-leading Wizards. \u201cThis is one of those games that you can\u2019t be 100 percent mad because there was so much freak stuff going on at the end of the game it could have played out any way,\u201d Beal said. Austin Rivers hit a 3-pointer from the right wing, putting the Clippers ahead 110-109 with 12 seconds left after he missed a 3 in the right corner and Los Angeles controlled the rebound. \u201cI thought that was going to be the one that won it,\u201d Williams said. Beal completed a three-point play with 8 seconds remaining to put the Wizards back in front, 112-110. That set up Williams\u2019 winning shot after the Clippers had blown a 14-point lead in the third quarter. Both teams were missing injured stars: John Wall for the Wizards and Blake Griffin for the Clippers. Neither team led by more than four points in the fourth. Beal got loose for 16 points in the third. He made four 3-pointers before Porter pulled the Wizards into a 75-all tie on a free throw. The last 1 1\/2 minutes turned into a 3-point shootout between Williams and Scott. Each of them hit two 3s and Williams added another basket to give the Clippers an 85-81 lead going into the fourth."},{"id":48308,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/cleveland-cavaliers-kevin-love-out-sore-left-hip-against-philadelphia-sixers","date":"2017-12-10","title":"Cavaliers' Kevin Love out with sore left hip against Philadelphia","content":"CLEVELAND (AP) \u2014 Cavaliers center Kevin Love is out against the Philadelphia 76ers because of a sore left hip.

Last season\u2019s Hornets had the conference\u2019s seventh best point differential , and better late-game luck, along with continuity and improved defense (with the addition of Dwight Howard), should have had them back in the 42-45 win range this season. Charlotte has played one of the league\u2019s toughest schedules, with 15 of its 24 games having been against teams that currently have winning records. After missing Nicolas Batum for the first 12 games, the Hornets are now dealing with injuries to Frank Kaminsky, Jeremy Lamb and Cody Zeller, as well as the absence of head coach Steve Clifford. But it\u2019s getting late early for this team, now 9-15 after losing to the 4-20 Chicago Bulls for the second time this season on Friday .

They have lost four of their last five games and for the last few days the players and coaching staff have been exploring the city and tasting local cuisine. A 117-105 loss at San Antonio on Wednesday left the team with an 11-13 record. Miami traveled to Mexico ahead of Saturday\u2019s game against the Brooklyn Nets to spend time together. Coach Erik Spoelstra thinks such trips bring his players closer. Last year, the Heat spent five day in the Bahamas before the season. \u201cI think it helps,\u201d he said. \u201cI have no statistics or analytics than can substantiate that. But I like it when you team gets to experience something different than a normal road trip because you get to come down here and spend a lot of time sightseeing on the bus together, we had a team meal yesterday and tonight and NBA event.\u201d In Mexico City, the team had a video session Thursday. The players and coaches then took the day off. Spoelstra, visiting Mexico for the first time, said he went to as many restaurants as possible while guard Goran Dragic said he went looking for some guacamole. \u201cWhen you go on one of these trips, you don\u2019t want to sit in your hotel room,\u201d Spoelstra said. \u201cYou want to get out there and see as much as you can, I\u2019m glad we had an extra day.\u201d The rest of the players also tried the local food and went shopping and sightseeing near the team\u2019s hotel in Polanco, an upscale part of the city. Kelly Olynyk, who\u2019s visiting the city for the fourth time, says it\u2019s good to be together and away from all the \u201csounds and the distractions\u201d of home. \u201cHopefully we can translate that to the game and we can get back on track and keep on rolling,\u201d he said. Olynyk, a Canadian center, was here before for the Basketball Without Borders program. He also played for his country in the qualifying tournament for the Rio Olympics and was with the Boston Celtics for a regular-season game against Sacramento. To no surprise, his teammates are using him as their private tour guide. \u201cThey are asking me all kind of questions\u201d, Olynyk said. \u201cFor me it*s great to be back here, the culture, the food and the fans are great. We haven\u2019t done anything crazy, just experience the city and walk around because the weather is nice, just like Miami.\u201d The Heat practiced for the first time in Mexico on Friday at a local school. After that they stopped by Bosque de Chapultepec, one of the largest city parks in the Western Hemisphere, before returning to the hotel. \u201cAnytime you are away from home and in a situation like this with a different culture and a different language you tend to gravitate more to people. We are all walking together and building relationships,\u201d Udonis Haslem said. \u201cYesterday I went shopping and tried good food. The people are nice, but today I\u2019m going to take care of myself. It\u2019s time to lock in. We had some time off but we have a job to do.\u201d Haslem has a point. Miami is second place in the Southeast Division, trailing the Washington Wizards (14-11). After playing the Nets on Saturday they will travel to Memphis to play there on Monday on the first of the four games in six days. \u201cIf you\u2019ve been in the NBA for several seasons you take trips for granted, and when you do something different and it\u2019s fun, it can help you grow as a team,\u201d Spoelstra said. \u201cWe could have stayed in San Antonio, but we\u2019ve been to San Antonio before. We wanted to be here and do something different.\u201d"},{"id":42846,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/portland-trail-blazers-say-jusuf-nurkic-out-saturdays-game-against-houston","date":"2017-12-09","title":"Portland Trail Blazers say Jusuf Nurkic out of Saturday's game against Houston Rockets","content":"PORTLAND, Ore.

He has been dealing with a sprained left ankle for much of his first season with Cleveland, but is doing rehab work with the team now. On Friday, Rose spoke to the media for the first time since his departure. In that conversation, he revealed his left ankle issues are due to a bone spur that may require him having a procedure if the rehab work he is doing doesn\u2019t help it. Rose had been in contact with coach Tyronn Lue and general manager Koby Altman in recent days. The conversations were described as \u201cpositive,\u201d and the team said he will report to its Cleveland Clinic Courts training facility. There is no timetable on when he\u2019ll play. Rose, whose career has been dogged by serious knee injuries, initially hurt his ankle on Oct. 20 in Milwaukee. He\u2019s made seven starts and is averaging 14.3 points and 26.9 minutes with the Cavs, who signed him to a one-year, $2.1 million free-agent contract this summer.

He\u2019s someone who, last season, made first-team All-NBA, had a seat at the MVP roundtable and nearly chopped down the champion Golden State Warriors in a playoff game ( before being chopped down himself ). And this will be good for the San Antonio Spurs, most would agree. What\u2019s less certain is what Kawhi Leonard\u2019s return from an achy quadricep means for LaMarcus Aldridge, who looks comfortable playing the lead right now without his co-star, yet squirmed to find peace when he had to ride shotgun. The Spurs star could make his season debut on Tuesday against the Mavericks. The Spurs\u2019 season rides on a happy balance between the two and a way to once again lurk as the team that gives the Warriors a severe case of the creeps, more than any other in the West. Despite all the fuss made over Chris Paul joining James Harden in Houston, and the star-infused Thunder in Oklahoma City, it\u2019s the same-old Spurs who spooked Golden State in Game 1 before losing the Western Conference finals . They were also the last non-Warriors team to reach the NBA Finals . And look who\u2019s sitting a bounce pass from the top of the West, despite missing Kawhi all season? That opening playoff game last May against Golden State was a flash point for San Antonio. The series of events that followed managed to put Leonard in a bad place physically, saw Aldridge melt epically the rest of that series and generate trade talk in the off-season, forced a major sit-down\/showdown between coach Gregg Popovich and Aldridge and then, out of seemingly nowhere and somewhat surprisingly, a peaceful resolution was reached and wins followed. \u201cAs you can see, based on the evidence,\u201d said Aldridge the other day, \u201ceverything\u2019s good.\u201d Yes, it appears so. With Kawhi out of the lineup, the Spurs are doing what they usually do, using disciplined basketball to stamp themselves as a contender. Some nights, Aldridge has been a force, ripping double-doubles and looming large in close games. The ball is finding him in a greedy groove; Aldridge is taking almost 17 1\/2 shots a game and the Spurs\u2019 No. 2 shooter, Rudy Gay, is getting nine. As a result, his scoring average is up from a year ago, from 17.3 points per game to 22.6 ppg , matching his best production during his peak with the Portland Trail Blazers. Now in his third season with the Spurs, Aldridge has never felt this frisky and once again is leaning on his money maker: the floating 18-foot jumper. Most important, the Spurs are winning because of him, and Popovich is gloating over him. \u201cAre you kidding?\u201d Popovich said. \u201cWe\u2019d be in the toilet if it wasn\u2019t for L.A. He\u2019s been a complete basketball player at both ends of the floor, great rebounding, defensively, running the floor, scoring. What\u2019s really been great is his leadership. And him bringing it every night.\u201d It\u2019s a short sample size after 25 games, but Popovich and the Spurs are cautiously encouraged by this. The Spurs veered from their usual draft-and-develop ways when they signed Aldridge to a big free-agent contract three summers ago . Because of that, Aldridge was considered an outsider, someone who wasn\u2019t a true Spur, but who was needed by a team that craved proven talent to remain a contender in the post-Tim Duncan era. But it\u2019s been a learning process for Aldridge, Popovich and the Spurs. He came from the Blazers anxious to break free of a team that began to orbit around Damian Lillard, but wouldn\u2019t you know it, Leonard turned into a superstar almost overnight after Aldridge arrived. The timing was good for the Spurs \u2026 and awkward for Aldridge, who was forced to adjust his game with prodding from Popovich. Aldridge bit his tongue last season when he averaged his lowest point total since his rookie season. When Leonard suffered his ankle sprain against the Warriors, Aldridge suddenly had the burden of carrying the load, and he failed spectacularly for the rest of that series. He averaged just 11.3 points in the final three games and became low hanging fruit for critics. Popovich was asked the other day if Aldridge had to atone for that this season and the coach came to his player\u2019s defense. \u201cI don\u2019t know if the word \u2018atone\u2019 is accurate,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cIf your leading scorer and also your point guard (Tony Parker, who was also out against the Warriors) isn\u2019t there, then it falls on someone else. If you take away the two top players from any playoff team, it\u2019s probably going to be tough to move on. I don\u2019t think he has anything to atone for.\u201d Still, something wasn\u2019t right; anyone could see that. Aldridge requested a summertime meeting with Popovich and came with demands . On the surface, that might seem a risky strategy, given the coach\u2019s credentials vs. someone without a single title, and Aldridge knew he was walking on eggshells. \u201cI didn\u2019t know how it would go because he\u2019s Gregg Popovich. I didn\u2019t know how he\u2019d take me saying things. I didn\u2019t know what to expect, with me coming at a person a different way but I was very honest and I think he could tell this was maybe different from what he was used to. But I was not disrespectful. I was trying to express how I was feeling and he was very receptive to it. We kept talking and things got better. I was pleasantly surprised.\u201d For anyone who thought one of the game\u2019s greatest coaches didn\u2019t have a humble side, guess again.  Popovich said: \u201cWe broke bread a few times, talked about it, laughed about it, discussed what we thought needed to happen, and frankly 95 percent of it fell on me because I made an error in trying to change him too much. That might sound odd, but he\u2019d been in the league nine years and there\u2019s one way he plays on the offensive end and feels comfortable with. I tried to turn him into Jack Sikma, told him I was going to teach you how to play on the elbow, go on the wing, face up. It was confusing for him. It really didn\u2019t fit his style of play. I was guilty of over coaching in a sense. \u201cWe came to an agreement on what had to happen. Well, on defense, I told him \u2018I\u2019m going to get on you like I do everyone else. But on offense, I don\u2019t even want to talk to you. When they double you, kick it. Other than that, you be LaMarcus Aldridge.\u2019 You see the result right now. He\u2019s happy, confident and kicking everybody\u2019s butt.\u201d Every star player\u2019s ego needs a degree of pampering, and Popovich did admit that dealing with Aldridge was different than any player he\u2019s ever had, yet says there\u2019s a reason for that. \u201cWhen guys like Kawhi and Tony Parker and others came to me, they were young kids. When a guy\u2019s been in a league nine years and is used to doing something and I try to take it away, that\u2019s not right. That wasn\u2019t very wise on my part.\u201d Popovich didn\u2019t pull rank in the meeting with Aldridge and if anything, he put his ego in check, something you see from coaches who haven\u2019t accomplished one-fourth of what he\u2019s done. But Pop has never strayed from the first rule in coaching players, especially the good ones: Keep them happy by any means necessary. \u201cYou gotta look at things and make it better as a coach,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s your responsibility. This was mostly me.\u201d Here\u2019s Aldridge this season so far: Back-to-back 33- and-41-point games a few weeks ago, sharper court awareness, better rebounding and passing than a year ago. Aldridge: \u201cI was frustrated. I just wanted to help more and I think he understood that. Now I feel as confident as I was in Portland. I\u2019m definitely being myself and playing my game and not overthinking and not worried about what\u2019s going to happen if I don\u2019t play well. I\u2019m not a face-up guy. I like to have my back to the basket more. Pop\u2019s given me the freedom to be myself again and that has shown itself on the court.\u201d The issue, both say, wasn\u2019t necessary the number of shots, though that was certainly one of the issues. It also was about the spot on the floor, when those shots needed to be taken. Aldridge said he has no problem with Leonard as the core \u2014 he called Kawhi \u201cour main guy\u201d \u2014 but wanted the same amount of comforts within the system. \u201cHe\u2019s a go-to guy also,\u201d said Aldridge. \u201cThe plan is to have him be the guy he is, and I be who I am now.\u201d And there\u2019s the key word: now. Leonard was bothered by the quad all last season and it didn\u2019t respond quickly to offseason treatment. But now he\u2019s nearly 100 percent and hopes a quick return to the level of last season when he jacked his scoring and finished third in the MVP voting , one spot ahead of LeBron James. Count Parker among the teammates who\u2019ve said the obvious about Aldridge and how the power forward, in Leonard\u2019s absence, has looked All-Star quality. \u201cEverything\u2019s going through him right now and he\u2019s doing a better job knowing when to score and when to pass,\u201d Parker said, \u201calong with reading double teams and playing good defense.\u201d But then Parker, the most senior Spur after Manu Ginobili, stressed that everyone, including Aldridge, must sacrifice for Leonard and not vice-versa, for the sake of the system and ultimately, wins. \u201cWhen you play for the Spurs you don\u2019t get a lot of big stats,\u201d Parker said. \u201cNow that Kawhi is out, he obviously has the ball more and he\u2019s going to shoot more shots.\u201d Then he added the kicker: \u201cWhen Kawhi comes back we will share\u201d \u2014 Parker said while smiling \u2014 \u201clike we always do here.\u201d Veteran NBA writer Shaun Powell has worked for newspapers and other publications for more than 25 years.

He is a talent tasked with leading the franchise back to the elite level their die-hards believe is their right. Knicks coach Jeff Hornacek praised his star for the way he prepared himself for the opportunity and his breakout start to the season, making clear that his improvement is about more than just increased opportunities with Anthony out of the picture. Porzingis is averaging 7.3 points more per game than he did last season while taking five more shots per game and nearly three more free throws per game \u2014 all while playing basically the same number of minutes (32). He\u2019s averaging career bests in points (25.4), field goal percentage (.465), 3-point percentage (.411) and free throw percentage (.841). \u201cJust because you get more opportunities it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re going to be perform,\u201d Hornacek said. \u201cThe hard work he put in this summer, working on his strength, working on his game, working on being the main guy on a team like he did in EuroBasket, all that stuff lends itself to confidence, being comfortable out there when you are taking more shots. Not getting tired, we\u2019re asking him to play bigger minutes, and you have to have that energy for all 34 or 35 minutes or whatever he plays. And that\u2019s a credit to him that he worked really hard in the offseason to get to that point.\u201d That said, the future is exactly where the focus should be right now for Porzingis, who made his return from a two-game injury absence (ankle) with 18 points in a win over Memphis Wednesday . Sure, he looked like he was ready to storm to the top of the Kia Race to the MVP Ladder in the first month of the season. He was in the midst of the best scoring start to a season in franchise history and the praise and hyperbole was flowing in from every direction, from current and past players in awe of a 22-year-old with so much game and still so much room to improve. When former Knicks center and 2011-12 Kia Defensive Player of the Year Tyson Chandler suggested that Porzingis had the goods to be the best player in the game, just eight games into this season, the Latvian giant agreed. \u201cI believe so, too,\u201d Porzingis said to reporters, his confidence matching his super-sized ambition, \u201cand that\u2019s something I\u2019m going to work towards.\u201d It won\u2019t happen this season, not with favorites like James Harden, LeBron James, Durant, Kyrie Irving, and Stephen Curry (as well as fellow young stars like Giannis Antentokounmpo and Joel Embiid) all in the primes of their careers. And not with Porzingis coming back to earth a bit after that magnificent start to the season. After averaging 30 points through his first 10 games this season, Porzingis is averaging 18.9 on .395 shooting in his last seven. The dream, it turns out, takes more than just flashes of the spectacular. But his point guard, Jack, is convinced that Porzingis is in the formative stages of a career that will see him make annual runs at that top spot for years to come. \u201cHe\u2019s got way more skills than I realized,\u201d Jack said. \u201cFrom afar, I thought he was like the pick and pop four man, the kind we\u2019ve gotten used to seeing in recent years. But he has so many more intangibles to his game, being able to play in these little tight areas. It\u2019s not just paint points or 3-pointers, his in-between game is what\u2019s really, really impressed me. And then just remembering that he\u2019s 7-3 and possess those perimeter ball skills and those athletic moments, you\u2019re kind of just taken aback when you remember he\u2019s what 22 or whatever, come on man \u2026 that\u2019s craziness. \u201cThis guy is going to be around for a long time. He\u2019s going to be an All-Star, a MVP candidate and all that stuff. There\u2019s no doubt in my mind. He\u2019s got everything you need to be all that and more.\u201d * * * The top five in the Week 8 edition of the 2017-18 Kia Race to the MVP Ladder: Last week\u2019s ranking:  No. 1 Season stats:  31.6 points, 9.4 assists, 5.1 rebounds Who knew that the addition of another ball-dominant point guard would bring out the best in both Harden and Chris Paul, who has been absolutely magnificent since returning to the lineup? Rockets GM Daryl Morey and coach Mike D\u2019Antoni can go ahead and stand up. Because the Rockets are an absolute machine right now, winners of a Western Conference-best eight straight games after prevailing in Utah Thursday night . Harden (29 points, five rebounds and three assists against the Jazz) has to feel good knowing that whatever he doesn\u2019t handle on a given night, Paul (18 points, 13 assists and nine rebounds) will be there to pick him up. It\u2019s a luxury he simply has not had during his time in Houston. If this nine-game sample of the two of them in action is any indication, the Rockets might be better prepared to challenge the Golden State Warriors for Western Conference supremacy than initially thought. Last week\u2019s ranking:  No. 2 Season stats:  28.2 points, 8.6 assists, 8.0 rebounds Yes, it\u2019s easy to take LeBron for granted after all these years of watching him operate at a level few others have been able to during his 15 seasons (and counting) in the league. But that\u2019s not what is going on right now \u2014 not while his Cavaliers refuse to lose behind to his exhausting efforts on the regular. If anything, the appreciation for his brilliance are shining brighter than ever, especially when examining outings like the one he had against the Memphis Grizzlies ( 34 points and 12 assists ) and Sacramento Kings ( 32 points, 11 rebounds, nine assists ) that pushed the Cavaliers\u2019 win streak to 13 games. LeBron has shattered enough dreams around the league to know that he\u2019s appreciated by the ticket-buying public that turns out everywhere he goes. Sure, he\u2019ll catch a healthy dose of hate tonight at Bankers Life Fieldhouse in Indianapolis ( 7 ET, NBA League Pass ) when the Cavaliers try to set the franchise record for consecutive wins against the Pacers. But that\u2019s a sign of respect from yet another franchise and city that hasn\u2019t been able to get around him the past decade. Last week\u2019s ranking:  No. 3 Season stats:  23.5 points, 5.0 assists, 3.1 rebounds Kyrie\u2019s MVP buzz has subsided a bit since the Celtics\u2019 win streak came to an end and his old team and teammate (LeBron James) snatched that momentum. But his MVP-caliber season is rolling along. He continues to turn in one masterful performance after another, giving the Celtics what they need when they need it to keep their lead in the standings. He\u2019s averaging 28.3 points on 57.6 percent shooting over his last 10 games as Boston finished its recent home stand 4-1 record. They face the Spurs tonight in San Antonio ( 9:30 ET, ESPN ), missing Kawhi Leonard\u2019s season debut for the Spurs by a few nights . It\u2019s the first game of a three-game road trip that will see them visit Detroit (Sunday) and Chicago (Monday) before returning home to host Denver and Utah next week. Last week\u2019s ranking:  No. 6 Season stats:  29.6 points, 10.2 rebounds, 4.5 assists Antetokounmpo celebrated his 23rd birthday in style, dropping 25 points, 11 rebounds, four assists and two blocks in a win over the Detroit Pistons. And that came on the heels of a 40-point, nine-rebound, four-assist effort in a loss to Boston . Antetokounmpo is averaging 30 points on 52.7 percent shooting over his past five games and the Bucks have won four of those five. In other words, \u201cThe Greek Freak\u201d is back to doing things only he and perhaps one or two other players in the league can do on a consistent basis. And he\u2019s the only 23-year-old doing them. The Bucks have shoved their way back up the ranks in the Eastern Conference playoff chase, too, shaking off a couple of rough patches from last month where they lost four straight during one stretch and three of four in another. Antetokounmpo and the Bucks could use a nice holiday rush to end the calendar year. Last week\u2019s ranking:  No. 7 Season stats:  25.1 points, 6.6 rebounds, 5.2 assists KD collected his third career 30-point triple-double \u2014 and his first in a Warriors uniform \u2014 in Wednesday\u2019s win in Charlotte . It\u2019s symbolic that in came in Stephen Curry\u2019s hometown in the first game of several Curry will miss with that sore ankle he sprained against New Orleans Monday (Draymond Green was missing from the lineup as well). How Durant performs in Curry\u2019s absence will no doubt stoke the the conversation about where both players would fit in the overall landscape if they weren\u2019t playing together, even if it makes little sense to ponder such things since they\u2019re sticking together for the foreseeable future. And if you needed a refresher course in what made Durant the reigning Finals MVP, then you need a timeout anyway. Now if Steve Kerr can just get Durant and Co. to keep their cool and avoid any more ejections \u2026 The next five: 6. Joel Embiid, Philadelphia 76ers 7. Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors 8. DeMar DeRozan, Toronto Raptors 9. LaMarcus Aldridge, San Antonio Spurs 10. Russell Westbrook, Oklahoma City Thunder And five more \u2026: DeMarcus Cousins, New Orleans Pelicans; Andre Drummond, Detroit Pistons; Damian Lillard, Portland Trail Blazers; Kristaps Porzingis, New York Knicks; Karl-Anthony Towns, Minnesota Timberwolves An Inside Look at Jimmy Butler from a Western Conference scout: \u201cThe Timberwolves are a hard team to figure out right now. They\u2019ve been up and down and struggled down the stretch of some close games, which is something that Jimmy was supposed help fix. But I don\u2019t put it all on him. In fact, he\u2019s had the biggest adjustment to make of those three guys (Karl-Anthony Towns and Andrew Wiggins) and he\u2019s done a nice job. His comfort with Thibs [coach Tom Thibodeau] and the way he runs his show certainly helps. But for those three guys to try and sort out who gets their touches when and where they like them is rough. It\u2019s something that players have to work through themselves. \u201cWhere Jimmy has really stepped up, from what I\u2019ve seen, is on the defensive end. He\u2019s taking the challenge night after night to be the guy that steps in there and battles the best perimeter player on the other side. That requires an energy and focus a lot of guys who have reached his level of success either don\u2019t have the energy for or simply won\u2019t do. But he\u2019s always been more of a blue-collar star as opposed to one of these guys who came into the league anointed or feeling like he was entitled to be where he is now. So when I see him trying to make the right play at the end of the game, as opposed to taking hero shots, is a good thing. He\u2019s leading by example and showing those young guys what kind of sacrifices have to be made for the greater good, which I know is something he got crushed for not doing in Chicago. It\u2019s going to be interesting to see if and how things change come All-Star time when I guarantee you all three of those guys believe they are worthy of a spot, but we all know it\u2019s going to be extremely difficult to see that happen. It\u2019s a different pecking order with Butler, Towns and Wiggins compared to what they dealt with when Zach LaVine was the third guy in that mix. It\u2019s worth keeping an eye on.\u201d * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

He moved about dressed in a suit and smiled while answering questions about his injury. \u201cI\u2019m already walking.

The injury is new territory for Booker, the face of the Suns in his third season.

Okafor got his wish when the Philadelphia 76ers finally traded the No. 3 overall pick of the 2015 draft to the Brooklyn Nets. The deal ends the stalemate that had kept Okafor on the bench for all but two games this season. Once a prized piece of The Process, Okafor rapidly fell out of favor with the rise of star center Joel Embiid. \u201cLove you. New beginnings,\u201d Embiid said he texted Okafor. \u201cGood luck. And I made sure to let him know I was going to kick his (rear).\u201d Team president Bryan Colangelo said he reached a deal with a team he declined to name to trade Okafor last season until it fell apart at the last minute. That led to an awkward situation where Okafor didn\u2019t even travel with the team during the trade deadline. Okafor led the Sixers in scoring as a rookie with Embiid out with injuries. Okafor played 55 games last season and never really meshed with the franchise center. Okafor started piling up DNP-CDs and those stretched into this season, where the Sixers will chase a playoff berth without him. \u201cHe can go play basketball again,\u201d coach Brett Brown said. The Sixers also sent seldom-used guard Nik Stauskas, the No. 8 overall pick in the 2014 draft, and a 2019 second-round pick to the Nets for forward Trevor Booker. Booker, the 23rd overall pick of the 2010 draft by Washington, averaged 10.1 points with the Nets. \u201cThere is a level of toughness and versatility that interests me,\u201d Brown said. \u201cHe\u2019s shown that he can play, handle not play and be good people and handle himself like a pro.\u201d Okafor gave the Sixers plenty of headaches in his rookie season out of Duke with his off-court conduct, which included his role in Boston street fight that earned him TMZ scrutiny and a two-game suspension. He was widely mocked last year for a lackadaisical defensive effort where he stood still and failed to contest shots in a game against Miami. \u201cI think like anybody that comes into our organization, we need to defend the basketball,\u201d Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. \u201cI think that will be a challenge for both of them. We need those guys to be two-way players.\u201d Under former general manager Sam Hinkie, the Sixers orchestrated a plan to strip the roster of talent to gobble draft picks that could turn into future rotation players. Accused of tanking, the Sixers went 18-64 in 2014-15 and earned the No. 3 pick. They landed a flop instead of a future star. Okafor not only dropped behind Embiid on the depth chart, but this year was demoted behind Richaun Holmes and Amir Johnson. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to take a guy that was drafted third in the draft, after all the pain and strife that this organization and fan base went through, to just move away,\u201d Colangelo said. Colangelo had no ties to Okafor and there was no secret of his desire to move him. Okafor played in 105 games (81 starts) with the Sixers and averaged 14.6 points, 5.9 rebounds, 1.2 assists and 26.2 minutes while shooting 51.0 percent from the field. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say there\u2019s regrets. I\u2019d say there\u2019s human disappointment,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWe went through a lot together while he was here.\u201d The Nets also requested waivers on guard Sean Kilpatrick. Atkinson said he was ready to help the two former first-rounders find success with the rebuilding Nets. \u201cI think they\u2019re coming into a strong locker room,\u201d Atkinson said. \u201cThis trade provides us with a good opportunity to bring in two young players who were high picks in recent drafts and give them a chance to succeed in our system,\u201d Nets general manager Sean Marks said.

Three years after he was drafted, Joel Embiid is finally a full-time player (or pretty darn close to it). Ben Simmons is clearly the favorite to be the Rookie of the Year. Robert Covington has evolved from an undrafted guy they took a flyer on in 2014 to one of the league\u2019s best 3-and-D role players. Two more draft picks \u2014 Dario Saric and Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot \u2014 are developing and veterans have been brought in to provide both leadership and production. The Process has become a lot of fun to watch. But it\u2019s more than that, because the Sixers are actually pretty good. They have winning record (6-5) on the road and a top-10 defense . They\u2019ve taken more than one step forward in the last couple of years. There are more steps to be taken. This year\u2019s No. 1 pick, Markelle Fultz, has yet to show us what he can do. Embiid and Simmons have incredibly high ceilings and are still just finding their NBA legs. The Sixers host the Los Angeles Lakers on Thursday at 8 p.m. ET . It\u2019s the first game of TNT\u2019s doubleheader and the last game of a stretch where Philly has been playing nine of 10 games at home.

THE CONTEXT  No kidding, right? The hardest part of \u201cThe Process\u201d is over, Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons are healthy, and the Sixers have gone from bad to good. But The Process actually made quite a bit of progress last season, when the Sixers went from awful to just bad. From 2015-16 to \u201916-17, the Sixers made a jump of 4.3 points per 100 possessions, the second biggest in the league. They actually made the biggest jump in winning percentage, which they\u2019ve done again this season. Of course, when you go 10-72 (as the \u201915-16 Sixers did), there\u2019s nowhere to go but up. An infusion of talent at multiple positions can make a big difference and the Sixers have had quite an infusion of talent over the last two seasons, both from new players and the development of ones they\u2019ve had. (Hello, Robert Covington.) The bigger improvement over the last two seasons has come on offense, where the Sixers are 7.5 points per 100 possessions better than they were two seasons ago. An improvement of 4.1 points per 100 possessions last season wasn\u2019t enough to climb out of 30th in offensive efficiency (where they ranked for the fourth straight season), but another jump of 3.5 has them up to 19th this season. Shooting, on both ends of the floor, is the most important thing in basketball. Over the last two seasons, the Sixers have climbed from 27th to 21st to 16th in *effective field goal percentage and from 18th to 16th to 4th in opponent effective field goal percentage. In regard to shooting, they\u2019ve made a bigger jump on defense. From last season, they\u2019ve improved from 15th to first in opponent 3-point percentage and they\u2019ve had the league\u2019s biggest drop in the percentage of opponent shots that have come from the restricted area. * Effective field goal percentage = (FGM + (0.5 * 3PM)) \/ FGA But interestingly, the area where the Sixers have improved most on both ends of the floor is rebounding. Two seasons ago, they were in the bottom five in both offensive and defensive rebounding percentage. This season, they rank second and eighth , respectively. Four of the top six players in minutes on last season\u2019s Sixers were Nik Stauskas (6-6), T.J. McConnell (6-2), Gerald Henderson (6-5) and Sergio Rodriguez (6-3). This year\u2019s Sixers are big. They start a 6-foot-10 point guard and J.J. Redick (6-foot-4) is their only starter shorter than 6-foot-9. Big players generally grab more rebounds and the Sixers\u2019 starting lineup has grabbed 57 percent of available boards, the highest mark among lineups that have played at least 100 minutes together . Two seasons ago, the Sixers were outscored by 3.0 points per game on second chances . This season, they\u2019re a plus-1.9 on second-chance points. A difference of 4.9 points per game is huge, worth about 15 wins over the course of a full season. The Sixers\u2019 last two wins \u2013 over Washington and Detroit last week \u2013 were both by five points . In those games, they were a plus-15 and a plus-10 on second chance points . Detroit\u2019s Andre Drummond ranks second in the league in offensive rebounding percentage , but grabbed just one offensive rebound ( a season low ) in Philly on Saturday. Five different Sixers had more. League-wide, offensive rebounding percentage is at an all-time low of 22.3 percent, having decreased each of the last six seasons. Teams are prioritizing transition defense and sending fewer players to the offensive boards. But there are still points to be had and points to be prevented by improving on the glass, which the Sixers have done dramatically over the last two seasons. 1. According to Second Spectrum player tracking, the Sixers average 11.4 miles traveled per 24 minutes of possession . This is the second straight season that Philly has led the league in player movement. And it\u2019s the fourth time in Brett Brown\u2019s five seasons as coach that they\u2019ve ranked in the top three (they ranked eighth in 2015-16). They\u2019ve also ranked in the top seven in pace in each of Brown\u2019s five seasons on the bench. It seems counterintuitive to play fast when you have a talent deficit. The more possessions you play, the more chances your opponent has to use its advantage. But shot clock data tells us the best shots come early in the clock. League-wide effective field goal percentage is about 60 percent in the first six seconds of the shot clock, 51 percent with 7-18 seconds left on the clock, and 43 percent in the last six seconds. If you can get into your offense quickly, space the floor, *move the ball and move bodies, the league\u2019s not-so-good defenses will have a difficult time keeping up. A team that plays slow and stands around on offense makes things easier on the defense and more difficult on itself. * The Sixers lead the league in passes per game , but, once you take pace into account, they rank lower in passes per possession. With pace and space, it becomes a matter of execution. If you can take care of the ball, set good screens, and make the open shots that your system produces, you can have a solid offense. Yes, the Sixers probably lost some games by playing too fast over the last four years. But they set a standard for the way they want to play. The Brooklyn Nets are trying to do the same thing as they go through their own kind of rebuilding. With more talent comes better execution and the habits that have been built over the years begin to bear fruit. \u201cIt\u2019s really not like we\u2019ve changed our structure,\u201d Brown said last week about the evolution of his team\u2019s offense. \u201cWe just have different people in the structure.\u201d 2. For the fourth time in the last five seasons, the Sixers have the league\u2019s highest turnover rate . This is the execution issue that still lingers in Year 5 of The Process. The only time over the last five seasons when the Sixers haven\u2019t ranked last in turnovers per 100 possessions was \u201915-16, when they ranked 29th . The good news is that only 49 percent of their turnovers have been live-balls (recorded as opponent steals). That\u2019s the third lowest rate in the league and down from 52 percent last season (and 54 percent in \u201914-15). The Sixers have replaced some sloppy passing with *travels and illegal screens. * With more travels being called this season, the percentage of league-wide turnovers that have been live balls is down, from 55 percent last season to 52 percent (the lowest rate since 2010-11). On the other end of the floor, the Sixers rank 25th in opponent turnover rate, but 59 percent of their opponent turnovers (the highest rate in the league) have been live balls. So they average almost as many opportunities per game off live-ball turnovers ( 8.4 ) as their opponents do ( 8.5 ). Those dead-ball turnovers are still lost opportunities to score. And for the Sixers to take the next step, they have to do a better job of minimizing mistakes. 3. The Sixers have played the league\u2019s toughest schedule through Wednesday. As noted above, the Sixers have played eight of their last nine games at home. Prior to that, they were on the road for 10 of their first 14. So they\u2019re almost even in regard to home vs. away. But in regard to opponent strength, the Sixers have played the league\u2019s toughest schedule, as their opponents thus far have had a cumulative winning percentage of 0.561. Of the Sixers\u2019 23 games so far, 16 have been against the other 15 teams that currently have winning records . That includes a league-high six games against the teams \u2013 Boston, Houston and Golden State \u2013 with the three best records in the league, plus single games against two of the other three teams (Cleveland and Toronto) that have won at least two thirds of their games. The Sixers are done with the Rockets and Warriors and play the 8-15 Lakers on Thursday, but then have a three-game trip with all three games against teams with winning records. Then, after games against Oklahoma City, Chicago and Sacramento, they\u2019ll have a month-long stretch (from Dec. 21 \u2013 Jan. 20) where 10 of 12 games area against teams that currently have winning records. After that, the schedule will ease up. For now, the Sixers should be feel pretty good about where they\u2019re at. And if they\u2019re still in the top six or seven in the East on Jan. 21, they\u2019re in great shape. John Schuhmann is a staff writer for NBA.com.

But not Russell Westbrook and the Oklahoma City Thunder. The NBA MVP and the Thunder arrived on Wednesday night South of the Border to face the Brooklyn Nets in the NBA\u2019s 25th game in Mexico more concerned about dinner than the altitude. \u201cI don\u2019t know nothing about the altitude, to be honest, I just play,\u201d Westbrook said at the team\u2019s hotel in an upscale part of town. \u201cIf you are in shape then you are in shape and if you are not then you are not.\u201d Sitting at 7,350 feet above sea level, Mexico\u2019s capital is at a far higher elevation than Denver \u2013 the NBA\u2019s highest venue at 5,280 feet. Professional teams try different approaches to avoid the effects of the altitude on the body and usually, arriving as close to a game as possible is regarded as the way to go. The NFL champions New England Patriots did just that and arrived a few hours prior to a game against the Oakland Raiders on Nov. 19 and got a convincing win. \u201cYou have to be ready to go, it\u2019s kind of the equivalent to playing on the second game of a back-to-back in my opinion,\u201d Andre Robertson said. \u201cWe\u2019ll try to adjust but I think it will be fine, we are all in the same category, we are going to be tired and they are going to be tired.\u201d Thunder coach Billy Donovan said that he\u2019s not planning to alter their substitutions pattern to adjust better to the altitude and that the team will visit the Arena Ciudad de Mexico on Thursday morning to try to get acclimated. \u201cWe played a lot of games in Denver, I don\u2019t think this will be much different,\u201d Donovan said. \u201cI have a lot of respect for the players, one for the way they take care of themselves physically, mentally and emotionally, and two, for the way they prepare every day because every 48 hours it\u2019s a new team, a new situation and a new environment.\u201d For the Thunder, the game will be their fourth so far in December and the fifth in eight days. They played at Orlando on Nov. 29 and then beat Minnesota, San Antonio and Utah at home. \u201cIt\u2019s part of the job and it\u2019s something that we love to do, and you can\u2019t complain,\u201d Westbrook said. \u201cI love playing basketball, I love traveling it\u2019s something that we are blessed to do.\u201d Westbrook said that this it\u2019s his first trip to Mexico City and that he has been to Los Cabos before so he knows that dinner may involve some tacos. \u201cFor sure, I think it\u2019s definitively a possibility,\u201d said Westbrook about trying the Mexican cuisine. \u201cI don\u2019t know where, but definitively.\u201d"},{"id":42875,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/global-games-brooklyn-nets-players-and-coaches-are-focused-oklahoma-city-thunder","date":"2017-12-07","title":"Global Games: Brooklyn Nets focused on the Oklahoma City Thunder","content":" *Thursday on League Pass:  Thunder vs. Nets, 10 (ET) MEXICO CITY \u2014 No earthquakes or volcanos are on the back of the mind of the Brooklyn Nets players and coaches ahead of their regular-season game Thursday night against the Oklahoma City Thunder in Mexico City. At least publicly. The game will be the 25th in NBA history South of the Border, the most for any country besides the United States and Canada. It also is the first since a 7.1 earthquake on Sept. 19 killed over 300 people, most of them in the nation\u2019s capital. \u201cWe talked about it and we talked about precautions with the NBA security on what we should do it happens\u201d, Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. \u201cWe are affected by it because it was big news in the U.S. and we saw the pain and suffering and sympathize with the victims. It was very moving to see those images, I can\u2019t imagine going through something like that\u201d. The quake was the deadliest in Mexico since the one on 1985 on the same date killed thousands and it came less than two weeks after another powerful quake caused 90 deaths in the country\u2019s south. New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick expressed relief to leave the country after a regular-season game against the Oakland Raiders played in at Azteca stadium. \u201cI think we\u2019re fortunate there was no volcano eruptions or earthquakes, or anything else while we were down there. You have two NFL franchises in an area that I don\u2019t know how stable the geological plates that were below us, but nothing happened, so that was good\u201d, Belichick said. The Patriots coach was talking about the Popocatepetl volcano located just 45 miles southeast of the capital which remains active and occasionally sends clouds of ash on surrounding communities. \u201cYou can\u2019t control natural disasters \u2026 the same thing happened in Houston with the flood and all over the place you can control what happens, you just respond to them,\u201d, Nets forward Quincy Acy said. Unlike the Patriots, who arrived to Mexico on a Saturday night and left the country 24 hours later, the Nets will be in the city for a longer period of time. They will play the Thunder on Thursday night and then against the Miami Heat on Saturday. \u201cOne thing I know about the NBA is that they are never going to put us in a position where something harmful is going to happen to us, they did all their research and everybody was happy to come over here\u201d, forward DeMarre Carroll said. Since the quake, the Formula One held a race at the Hermanos Rodriguez racetrack and the Patriots and Raiders played at Azteca on Nov. 19. Carroll and the rest of the Nets look comfortable in Mexico. After a light practice at Arena Ciudad de Mexico they traveled a few miles to give a basketball clinic and helped paint walls on the Miguel Quintana elementary school in the capital."},{"id":42868,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/dallas-mavericks-nerlens-noel-have-thumb-surgery","date":"2017-12-06","title":"Dallas Mavericks' Nerlens Noel to have thumb surgery, expected to be out several weeks","content":"BOSTON (AP) \u2014 Dallas Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle says forward Nerlens Noel will have surgery for a torn ligament in his left thumb.

(AP) \u2014 Warriors coach Steve Kerr says that while Stephen Curry\u2019s sprained ankle is not ideal, it may actually help his team in the long run. Curry is expected to miss about two weeks with a sprained right ankle, including Wednesday night\u2019s game against his hometown team, the Charlotte Hornets. \u201cIn a weird way, it\u2019s a good thing for our team,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cObviously I want all of our players healthy. \u2026 I think big picture-wise over the next couple weeks it\u2019s an opportunity for our team to get better because we have to. We have no choice.\u201d Curry, wearing a blue Warriors hoodie, took in the latter part of the Warriors\u2019 morning shoot around from the tunnel next to the court, but declined interview requests through the team\u2019s public relations department. He was on crutches and had his right ankle in a protective boot. The two-time league MVP Curry landed awkwardly on the E\u2019Twaun Moore\u2019s foot while going for a late steal in a 125-115 comeback win Monday night at New Orleans. He scored 31 points before the injury and is averaging 26.3 points, 6.6 assists and 5.1 rebounds per game this season. Curry said after the game it was a \u201cdumb play. I got caught on E\u2019Twaun\u2019s shoe as I went by him and couldn\u2019t catch myself.\u201d Kerr confirmed Wednesday that Curry\u2019s ankle is structurally intact. \u201cAll things considered it was good news,\u201d Kerr said of the MRI results. \u201cHopefully it will be a couple, or a few weeks, and he will be back. It\u2019s not anything that\u2019s too serious.\u201d Kerr said Patrick McCaw will miss the Hornets game with a nose contusion and Draymond Green is listed as doubtful with a shoulder injury. Kerr would not say who\u2019ll start for Curry, but it\u2019s possible Shaun Livingston will take his place in the lineup. The team also recalled point guard Quinn Cook from the G-League to join the roster. \u201cA team like ours, I think we will respond well without Steph because you feel threatened when all of a sudden you are without one of your best guys and you realize you are vulnerable,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cWhen you are vulnerable you tend to have your guard up a little bit. I anticipate that will happen.\u201d While the Warriors have another league MVP they can turn to in Kevin Durant to carry the load, Kerr made it clear that Curry is the \u201cguy who makes us go.\u201d \u201cWe have great players but Steph is the engineer, Everything revolves around him so we are going to have adapt and execute better,\u201d Kerr said. Kerr points to last year when Durant got hurt and the Warriors got better as a team, which he said helped the team in the playoffs. \u201cWe have to take the same approach with Steph out,\u201d Kerr said. Durant knows it\u2019s his time to step up. \u201cWe will have to play a little different,\u201d Durant said. \u201cThe way shoots off the dribble and shoots off the catch, it can\u2019t be duplicated by anyone who has ever played the game. So we have to figure out how to plug in what we are missing from Steph. But if we do it as a group collectively everyone will gain confidence.\u201d Curry enjoys playing in Charlotte, where he grew up watching his father Dell play for the Hornets. He attended nearby Davidson College and when he returns home to play it has the feel of a home game for the Warriors."},{"id":42870,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/isaiah-thomas-scrimmage-cleveland-cavaliers-practice","date":"2017-12-06","title":"Isaiah Thomas plays 4-on-4 at Cleveland Cavaliers' practice","content":" INDEPENDENCE, Ohio (AP) \u2014 Cavaliers All-Star point guard Isaiah Thomas played 4-on-4 on Wednesday, a significant step in his recovery from a hip injury. Thomas, who has yet to make his debut with Cleveland, scrimmaged along with injured forward Tristan Thompson, rookies Cedi Osman and Ante Zizic, and members of the coaching staff. With coach Tyronn Lue and members of the team\u2019s front office watching intently from behind the basket, Thomas moved freely and didn\u2019t appear to have any restrictions during the half-court workout that took place following the team\u2019s morning shootaround. Lue reported that Thomas \u201clooked good\u201d and absorbed some contact. It was the second straight day Thomas scrimmaged. However, Lue did not provide any update on when Thomas might play in a game. Lue planned to check with the team\u2019s medical staff to find out the next step in Thomas\u2019 recovery program, which the 28-year-old has described as his \u201cslow grind.\u201d Because of Cleveland\u2019s schedule, there aren\u2019t many practice days for Thomas to get in work with his teammates. Lue said it\u2019s possible he\u2019ll practice with members of the Canton Charge, the Cavs\u2019 D-League affiliate. Thomas has been making steady progress and nearing his return to action and helping the Cavs, who acquired him during the summer in the blockbuster trade that sent Kyrie Irving to the Boston Celtics. Since training camp opened, the Cavs have said they expect Thomas to play in games by the end of 2017, and that projection could be moved up. Thomas has been building up his workouts steadily as he recovers from a torn labrum in his right hip. It\u2019s possible Thomas could play in one of Cleveland\u2019s four home games this month before the team finishes December with three road games, including a Christmas Day matchup with the defending NBA champion Golden State Warriors. The Cavs would need to how Thomas recovers after taking contact during practice before he would be cleared to play. \u201cAt the end of the day it\u2019s all about the next day,\u201d LeBron James said as he kept an eye on his teammates from the opposite corner of Cleveland Clinics Courts. \u201cWhen they say they feel good the next day after a workout session, that\u2019s great to know.\u201d Thompson has been sidelined since Nov. 1 with a strained left calf, but could return this week. \u201cHopefully, yeah,\u201d Lue said. \u201cNot sure how he\u2019s going to feel after today when he got done working out, so just trying to get a gauge on how he feels today, if there\u2019s any soreness or pain or anything and go from there.\u201d James said the Cavaliers\u2019 12-game winning streak has no bearing on when would be a good time for Thomas and Thompson to come back. \u201cThat\u2019s not how we do it around here,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen guys are healthy and are ready to get back in the lineup, then they\u2019ll be there, but there\u2019s never been no urgency for anyone.\u201d The return of two rotational players will be a major challenge for Lue, who has spent much of the season juggling lineups because of injuries and trying to find the right combinations. The Cavs have never played with Thomas, who averaged 28.9 points per game with Boston last year, but James said he has already visualized the impact the playmaker will have with Cleveland. \u201cI play a lot of NBA 2K,\u201d James said, referring to the video game. \u201cIt\u2019s the most realistic basketball game you could ever play. I mix and match a lot of lineup changes and things of that nature to see how we can be really good. I\u2019ve done that.\u201d And how do the Cavs look with Thomas? \u201cLooks pretty good,\u201d he said. \u201cLooks pretty good.\u201d"},{"id":48322,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/marc-gasol-memphis-grizzlies-fined-profane-language","date":"2017-12-06","title":"Memphis Grizzlies center Marc Gasol fined $15K","content":" NEW YORK \u2013 Memphis Grizzlies center Marc Gasol has been fined $15,000 for using profane language during a live television interview, it was announced today by Kiki VanDeWeghe, Executive Vice President, Basketball Operations.

He\u2019s having a great year in Detroit \u2014 19 points, 5 boards a game, and shooting 46 percent on 3s for a winning team. He\u2019s put up numbers in big games, too: 31 at Boston last week , 34 against Andrew Wiggins and the Wolves , 27 at Philly . LeBron, Giannis, Porzingis, Embiid and Love are likely frontcourt locks in the East, and I won\u2019t be surprised if the coaches take one of Al Horford or Jayson Tatum from Boston. And Aaron Gordon will have supporters, too. So Harris is certainly not a gimme. The Pistons will have to keep winning to keep his candidacy alive. Steve Aschburner : There are so many possibilities, from Kristaps Porzingis and Devin Booker to Bradley Beal and Victor Oladipo. But since the All-Star Game is neither the first nor the second of back-to-back games, I\u2019ll go with Philadelphia\u2019s Joel Embiid , whose talent and production should earn him a spot and whose personality and entertainment value are perfect for the star-spangled Weekend. Shaun Powell : I so, so badly wanted to answer \u201cMike Conley\u201d who might be the best veteran without a trip to the Game, but injuries happened. Therefore, you can toss in a handful of the young candidates: Joel Embiid, Devin Booker, Karl-Anthony Towns, Kristaps Porzingis. Let\u2019s go with Embiid because All-Star Weekend needs his presence and personality. Ask me this question in a month and maybe the answer is Tobias Harris, because the Pistons are winning and he\u2019s breaking out. John Schuhmann : Joel Embiid is a lock. His boxscore numbers ( 23.0 points, 11.3 rebounds and 1.8 blocks ) are fantastic. The Sixers are a playoff team and have been much better, both offensively and defensively , with him on the floor than they\u2019ve been with him on the bench. And this year, we don\u2019t have to scrutinize how much he\u2019s been playing. He\u2019s averaging 30 minutes per contest and has missed only three of the Sixers\u2019 23 games. Sekou Smith : Devin Booker is putting together a spectacular case , even though it\u2019ll be virtually impossible for him to get his due in a Western Conference stacked with outstanding backcourt players. The Suns have struggled in ways that don\u2019t suggest anyone on that roster could squeeze into the All-Star mix. But Booker\u2019s play this season has been more than just an occasional blip on the jaw-dropper radar (see his demolition of the Philadelphia 76ers for video evidence). He\u2019s a next-level scorer and a better overall player than he gets credit for being. If the Suns were in the playoff mix, he\u2019d be locked into that All-Star debate heading into the new year. * * *"},{"id":48326,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-surprised-success-san-antonio-spurs","date":"2017-12-06","title":"Blogtable: Surprised by how season is playing out for shorthanded San Antonio Spurs?","content":" * * * The Spurs have played the entire season without Kawhi Leonard, and most of the season without Tony Parker.

This is what they\u2019d do : If an NBA team ever had the NFL\u2019s \u201cNext Man Up\u201d mentality, it\u2019s San Antonio.

Those guys care, about how they play, and about each other. And you can tell by the way they come out and compete. They don\u2019t always play well, but they almost always play hard, and that\u2019s from 1-15, so there\u2019s almost never any drop-off in intensity no matter who Gregg Popovich plugs in. Steve Aschburner : Unless you\u2019re new to the NBA and its ways, you cannot claim to be surprised by any level of San Antonio Spurs overachievement. That team, under that coach, has demonstrated a resiliency and resourcefulness for so long, it\u2019s become the norm. No Leonard, yet San Antonio ranks second in defensive rating. Parker missing at point guard, yet the Spurs rank fourth in assists percentage and fifth in assists ratio . What would be surprising at this point would be to see the Spurs with that record flipped, 8-16, on the floor and moaning over what it doesn\u2019t have rather than maxing out with what it does. Shaun Powell : Well, we all should be surprised, until you realize Gregg Popovich did not retire, and the players on hand still believe in his system and move the ball and D-up. The only thing I\u2019m somewhat surprised about is LaMarcus Aldridge and how he\u2019s playing top-10 basketball. Remember, he didn\u2019t have Kawhi and Parker last spring in the West finals and completely melted down. Now? He\u2019s a beast some nights. Dare we say, after two-plus years in San Antonio he finally looks \u2026 like a Spur. John Schuhmann : No. The Spurs were 14-4 over the previous two regular seasons without Leonard. They\u2019ve had, statistically, the league\u2019s best bench in each of the two previous seasons . It also helps that they\u2019ve had one of the easiest schedules in the West thus far. Kawhi Leonard is great, but so is the Spurs\u2019 depth, defense and coaching. The one surprising thing is the improvement of LaMarcus Aldridge , who, at the age of 32, is registering career highs in effective field goal percentage and true shooting percentage with a higher usage rate than he had in his first two seasons with the Spurs. He\u2019s cut down on his mid-range shots a bit and has been one of the league\u2019s best finishers at the basket . The Spurs are 8-1 in games he\u2019s scored 25 or more points , something he did only eight times all of last season . Sekou Smith : Surprised? By the Spurs? Never. I\u2019ve learned my lesson where Gregg Popovich and his team are concerned. They are the surest thing in the league and they\u2019ve been doing what they\u2019re doing now longer than LeBron James has been guaranteed to make The Finals. When you have a true culture, framework that players can thrive in no matter what last name is spread across the back of their jersey, you can survive without a talent like Kawhi Leonard for the first couple months of a season. It was brilliant work, as usual, from Pop. He rebuilt his relationship with LaMarcus Aldridge in the offseason and then put the burden of carrying the team on Aldridge\u2019s shoulders until Kawhi and Tony Parker come back. There\u2019s a reason the rest of the league has raided the Spurs organization over the past two decades hoping to find someone with a little of that magic on them. It\u2019s the best blueprint for championship-level success in sports. No surprises at all. * * *"},{"id":48332,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-concern-warriors","date":"2017-12-06","title":"Blogtable: Should we be concerned about Golden State Warriors' big deficits?","content":"* * * The Warriors have three wins this season after trailing by 24, 21, and 18 points. Cause for concern, or is this just the Warriors lumbering through the regular season? * * * David Aldridge : That doesn\u2019t bother me. That\u2019s boredom. What bothers is me is them playing this tough guy role all of a sudden \u2013technicals, ejections and the like. Y\u2019all aren\u2019t hard like that. Nobody wants or expects you to play the villain. (Maybe Draymond.) The Dubs are the team everyone loves, even though they\u2019re defending champs and suck all the oxygen out of every building. And that\u2019s not fake; that\u2019s who they are. You can compete and be a good guy. Steve Kerr is a good guy. Steph Curry is a good guy. Kevin Durant is a good guy. Shaun Livingston is a good guy. Stop woofing at the refs and acting like you want to fight people. Steve Aschburner : Volatility in their scores isn\u2019t enough reason to be concerned, not in November and December. But adding some of the layers we\u2019ve seen lately \u2014 the technical fouls, the ejections, the flashes of temper or crankiness and now a dose of injury \u2014 might generate enough cause, if not for concern, at least to refocus and control better the things the Warriors can control. Come on, they\u2019ve been to The Finals three straight years and are the heavy favorites to win their third NBA title since 2015. Life is good. They might want to calm down and go back to Draymond Green as their Chief Emotional Officer. Shaun Powell : We haven\u2019t reached Christmas, when the season unofficially opens, nor late January, when the pack starts to separate, so I can\u2019t get too worked up about a team loaded with All-Stars and who are all in their prime and whether, say, the Rockets are scarier. Doesn\u2019t much matter how the Warriors look one-fourth through the season. Only signs of concern, of course, are health (Steph Curry\u2019s ankles?) and the rash of ejections. Maybe they\u2019re just bored and want to get the season out of the way. I understand. John Schuhmann : Steve Kerr has admitted that the champs don\u2019t have the same edge this year. And yeah, there\u2019s some concern with slow starts. The Warriors rank just 12th in NetRtg (point differential per 100 possessions) in the first quarter , their worst quarter both offensively and defensively . But they could also have easily let go of the rope after falling into such big holes. Coming back from 20-plus is pretty darn impressive in itself. Only four teams won two or more games that they trailed by 20-plus all of last season, and the Warriors have already done it in their first 25 games. Also, it should be noted that, as a whole, the league is coming back from 20-point deficits a little easier than it has in the past. With teams shooting more 3s than ever and league-wide pace at its highest mark since the 1990-91 season, scoring, from period to period, can be more volatile. We\u2019re on pace for 31 games where a team wins after trailing by 20 plus, having had no more than 16 in any of the last nine seasons. Sekou Smith : I\u2019d love to be concerned but the Warriors have tricked me before, only to show themselves to be immune to the nonsense when the season is one the line. I\u2019m more intrigued (not concerned \u2026 at least not yet) by their sudden penchant for getting sent to the showers early. All of the ejections and the inability to rise above the pettiness of a particular game has been a bit of a shock for a team that you would think operates with supreme confidence. Like Steve Kerr, I expect more of a championship team. But perhaps that\u2019s what makes them go, keeping their skin as thin as possible so they don\u2019t get too comfortable with themselves as they try and finish off a fourth straight season in The Finals. * * *"},{"id":48329,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/charlotte-hornets-coach-steve-clifford-away-team","date":"2017-12-06","title":"Charlotte Hornets coach Steve Clifford out indefinitely with 'health issue'","content":" CHARLOTTE, N.C.

(AP) \u2014 Authorities charged a man Tuesday in connection with the slaying of former NBA player Lorenzen Wright, more than seven years after Wright\u2019s bullet-riddled body was found decomposing in a Tennessee suburb. Billy Turner, 46, was indicted on a charge of first-degree murder, and was being held on $1 million bond, said Shelby County District Attorney General Amy Weirich. Court records did not list a lawyer for him or a date for a court hearing. Weirich and Police Director Michael Rallings declined to discuss any details of the arrest or investigation. Wright\u2019s body was found in suburban Memphis on July 28, 2010, 10 days after the 34-year-old was reported missing. He was shot multiple times. The seven-year investigation into his death has been one of the Memphis Police Department\u2019s most high-profile unsolved cases. Wright\u2019s mother, Deborah Marion, had told news outlets recently that she was not giving up hope as the search for her son\u2019s killer dragged on. Police said last month that they had found a gun used in the killing in a lake near Walnut, Mississippi, about 75 miles (120 kilometers) east of Memphis. The 6-foot-11 (210-centimeter) Wright played for the Memphis Grizzlies and four other NBA teams as a forward and center over 13 seasons before retiring in 2009. He averaged 8 points per game and more than 6 rebounds per game during his career. Born and raised in Memphis, he was a fan favorite thanks to his charity work with youth and his father\u2019s involvement as a coach in summer leagues. Former NBA players and friends including Anfernee Hardaway and Elliot Perry attended a memorial service for Wright in the days after his body was found. The father of six was last seen on July 18, 2010, as he left the home of his ex-wife, Sherra Wright. According to an affidavit, Sherra Wright told police she saw him leave her home carrying money and a box of drugs. Before he left, Sherra Wright said she overheard her ex-husband on the telephone telling someone that he was going to \u201cflip something for $110,000,\u201d the document said. Sherra Wright said Lorenzen Wright left her home in a car with a person she could not identify. The affidavit said Sherra Wright gave the statements to police in the Memphis suburb of Collierville, where she lives, on July 27 \u2013 nine days after he left her house for the last time. In the early morning of July 19, a police dispatcher in the suburb of Germantown received a call from Wright\u2019s cellphone. Dispatchers acknowledged they heard noises like gunshots before the call was dropped. Dispatchers said they didn\u2019t alert patrol officers or commanders because they couldn\u2019t confirm it came from their jurisdiction. They didn\u2019t send a patrol officer or relay the information to Memphis police until days later. Wright\u2019s mother filed a missing-person report with Collierville police on July 22, 2010. Authorities in Collierville were accused of dragging their feet in the days after the report was filed, and an apparent lack of communication kept authorities from linking the 911 call to the missing-person report. Wright\u2019s body was found in a field near some woods in the height of summer, complicating the investigation because evidence had likely deteriorated in the heat. An autopsy report showed bullet fragments were lodged in Wright\u2019s skull, chest and right forearm. The corpse was badly decomposed, weighing 57 pounds (25 kilograms).Wright\u2019s playing weight was around 225 pounds (100 kilograms)."},{"id":42883,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/week-history-kobe-bryant-antawn-jamison-51-point-games-2000","date":"2017-12-05","title":"Legendary Moments in NBA History: Kobe Bryant, Antawn Jamison score 51 apiece in same game","content":"Kobe Bryant ended his career as one of the NBA\u2019s all-time great scorers.

He\u2019s made seven starts and is averaging 14.3 points and 26.9 minutes with the Cavs, who signed him to a one-year, $2.1 million free-agent contract this summer. The three-time defending Eastern Conference champions anticipated using Rose as a backup to Isaiah Thomas. However, with Thomas continuing to recover from a hip injury, Rose was thrust into the starting lineup to start the season and showed flashes of his All-Star form while dealing with the sore ankle. \u201cEveryone\u2019s happy that he is back,\u201d Lue said. \u201cAll the players are happy and excited that he\u2019s back, as well as the coaches and the front office. We\u2019re just glad that he\u2019s in a good place right now. We\u2019re just happy to have him back. No hard feelings.\u201d Rose\u2019s minutes could be affected going forward. Thomas is expected to return in the next few weeks and Dwyane Wade has been playing well running the point for Cleveland\u2019s second unit. The Cavs have won 11 straight heading into their game Monday night in Chicago. Rose spent seven seasons with the Bulls. The 28-year-old has averaged 19.4 points, 5.9 assists and 3.7 rebounds since being taken as the No. 1 overall pick in 2008. \u201cEverybody goes through good or bad times,\u201d guard Jose Calderon said. \u201cIt\u2019s perfectly understandable. All we want is him to be happy and be back and that\u2019s great news for us and for him.

No, things were not good in Memphis when the Grizzlies fired David Fizdale as coach . They still aren\u2019t. The Grizzlies have lost 11 straight games entering tonight\u2019s matchup with the Minnesota Timberwolves ( 8 ET, NBA League Pass ), the franchise\u2019s longest losing streak since 2009. At 7-15, Memphis is only ahead of the Sacramento Kings and Dallas Mavericks in the loaded Western Conference, and while it\u2019s still young in the regular season, playoff talk is muted in Bluff City. This is Big Boy Sports. A coach owns his team\u2019s record, for better or worse, and Fizdale must wear 7-12, his team\u2019s record when he was fired. No first-time coach has all the answers, or doesn\u2019t make mistakes, and Fizdale is no different. But much of what plagues the Grizzlies today is also management\u2019s fault, and ownership\u2019s, and the players\u2019 \u2014 including, but not limited to, Marc Gasol. The 32-year-old cornerstone of the franchise did not get along with Fizdale , and in the end, the team chose the big man over the young man, the veteran over the new guy. Fizdale had tried to bring the successful teaching and motivational skills he\u2019d learned in with the Miami Heat, as one of the league\u2019s top young assistant coaches, to Memphis. He had endeared himself to the fan base with his infamous, fact-filled, passionate defense of his team after Game 2 of the Grizzlies\u2019 first-round playoff series with San Antonio last spring. Gasol has earned a certain level of respect and deference. It\u2019s not a stretch to say that he\u2019s surpassed his brother, Pau, as the most important player in franchise history. And it\u2019s not coincidence that his arc as a player mirrors the success of the franchise. He\u2019s the franchise\u2019s all-time leader in blocks and is second in rebounds and points . Nonetheless, the optics of dismissing Fizdale after just 19 games this season were, and are, awful. People around the league are still scratching their heads about who\u2019s running the franchise \u2014 especially considering this is the Grizzlies\u2019 third coaching change since 2013. That 2013 firing didn\u2019t make much sense, either, with Lionel Hollins getting sacked after winning 56 games in the regular season and leading the Grizzlies to the Western Conference finals for the first (and, so far, only) time in franchise history. Gasol, who has a close relationship with majority owner Robert Pera, said last week that he did not demand Fizdale be fired, after Fizdale benched him for the fourth quarter of last Sunday\u2019s bad home loss to Brooklyn , when Gasol had a plus-minus of -17. It turned out to be Fizdale\u2019s final game as coach. But Gasol clearly did not object. Even privately, among the players themselves, Gasol hasn\u2019t said anything while his teammates fumed about Fizdale\u2019s ouster. Yet the Grizzlies are adamant that the franchise isn\u2019t in turmoil, and that firing Fizdale was the right thing to do, even though he didn\u2019t have his best player, guard Mike Conley, for the last two weeks of his tenure because of a sore left Achilles . Other players like Wayne Selden (right quad), who was penciled in to start this season at guard, and Chandler Parsons (knee), were among many players in Fizdale\u2019s rotation that were on minutes restrictions at the beginning of the season as they returned from injuries, further hampering his ability to find a regular rotation. \u201cI can see where people of the outside could question that a little bit,\u201d Grizzlies General Manager Chris Wallace said Sunday. \u201cBut we had just not played well and all of the signs had not been trending well since our (5-1) start \u2026 we\u2019d been going down before Mike was hurt. We didn\u2019t have JaMychal (Green) and Seldon and (Ben) McLemore when we built the record up early. We as an organization have had success holding on when we had significant injuries in the past.\u201d True. But many of those years came with Gasol at or near his peak years \u2014 think 2012-13, when he was the Kia Defensive Player of the Year , or the following season, when he was first in the league among centers in Real Defense Plus-Minus (5.23). Gasol\u2019s offensive numbers are still strong and he made his third All-Star Game last year . He\u2019s still a load when he\u2019s on his game. But he\u2019s dropped off considerably at the defensive end from his best seasons. So far this season, per NBA.com\/Stats, Gasol ranks 25th in Defensive Rating among centers who play 20 or more minutes per game (106.8 points allowed per 100 possessions). \u201cHe\u2019s gone from Defensive Player of the Year level to starter level,\u201d said one veteran pro scout, who thinks Gasol is a good team defender who can protect the paint, but who was helped by the slower pace of play favored by former Grizzlies coach Dave Joerger, and who was aided by having an elite wing defender in Tony Allen on the floor with him. \u201cAs (Gasol) has gotten older, he is slower and has to guard quicker players out on the floor as (the) game has become more perimeter based, (and) he has to go out on the floor away from the rim,\u201d the scout said. Yet Memphis still believes that Gasol is an elite player \u2014 or at least one worth backing over the coach. The Grizzlies could have moved Gasol in the last couple of seasons, gone the Boston Celtics\u2019 route of trading experienced talent to teams looking to make a push in exchange for Draft picks. (In fact, they probably could have done such a deal with Boston, at least before the Celtics signed Al Horford in 2016.) The \u201cCore Four\u201d of Gasol, Conley, Zach Randolph and Allen carried the Grizzlies through their most successful era in franchise history \u2014 seven straight postseasons dating back to 2011, and the \u201cGrit-N-Grind\u201d style of play that was so synonymous with the city\u2019s toughness. But they also covered up numerous drafting whiffs during that same stretch, spanning different top managers. Since 2010, Memphis has used first-round picks on Xavier Henry ( taken 12th overall ), Dominique Jones ( 25th overall in 2010 , traded to Dallas), Greivis Vasquez ( 28th overall in 2010 ), Tony Wroten ( 25th overall in 2012 ), Jordan Adams ( 22nd overall in 2014 ), Jarell Martin ( 25th overall in 2015 ) and Wade Baldwin ( 17th overall in 2016 ). Of all those players, only Martin has played more than two seasons with the franchise. The Grizzlies have already waived both Baldwin and their second-round pick from \u201916, forward Rade Zagorac. There is hope for Martin, as well as Green, who re-signed with Memphis late in the summer , and forward James Ennis, who came to the Grizzlies with guard Mario Chalmers in a 2015 trade. Memphis folk bristle at the notion that Fizdale changed the culture of their organization, giving Hollins the lion\u2019s share of the credit for making the Grizzlies into a tougher, more focused group mentally. But Fizdale did change a lot of things in his short stint there. Grizzlies\u2019 practices were regimented and timed to the minute, with players split among several stations \u2014 film, lifting, agility and shooting. They were graded daily on attitude and work ethic. Nothing was left to chance or taken for granted, and players across the board \u2014 including Gasol (19.5 points per game last season), Conley (20.5) and Green (10.8) \u2014 had the best offensive seasons of their careers under Fizdale and his staff . The Miami culture of \u201cplug-and-play\u201d \u2014 developing young guys to transform themselves physically and taking on bigger roles \u2014 was said to be perfect for Memphis. Fizdale was charged with making the Grizz into a more modern offense. They were 29th in 3-point shooting (.331) and 27th in pace (95.65) the season before Fizdale was hired (2015-16). They wanted to play faster. That wasn\u2019t just a talking point, either. The feeling was it was hard enough to attract free agents to Memphis without playing a sleepwalking offensive style. Fizdale benched Randolph in order to help space out the starting lineup. (This in and of itself is telling; Z-Bo never publicly complained about Fizdale changing his role.) And he challenged Gasol to lose weight and come to camp in better shape, to expand his range to include more 3-pointers. Gasol did so, shooting 268 3-pointers last season after shooting just 66 total in his previous eight seasons . The hope was that Parsons, signed in 2016 for four years and a whopping $94 million max deal, would step in at the four and stretch the floor further, allowing Conley to more opportunities to attack earlier in the shot clock and more space to operate. Parsons was slowed by injuries again, but Memphis was nonetheless much better offensively last season, rising to 17th in 3-point percentage and shooting almost 10 more 3-pointers per game than in 2015-16. (The Grizz actually dropped to 28th in pace last season , at 94.74.) The Grizzlies weren\u2019t a juggernaut, but they were going in the right direction in terms of offensive diversity. They were excited about Selden, the former Kansas star. And they crossed the Rubicon, so to speak, when they didn\u2019t opt to re-sign either Allen  or Randolph this summer \u2014 the defensive and offensive embodiments, respectively, of the \u201cgrit-and-grind\u201d era \u2014 and let Vince Carter walk, too . There\u2019s no doubt that the city got its jollies from watching its team snuff out opposing offenses \u2014 \u201cit\u2019s a fan base that gets more excited about a shot clock violation than a dunk,\u201d one insider notes. But Randolph connected with the fans during his eight seasons in Memphis as much as any player. He not only made two All-Star teams there, famously battling Blake Griffin and the LA Clippers seemingly every year in the playoffs. He was also the one bludgeoning the Spurs in the Grizzlies\u2019 first-round upset of San Antonio in 2011 . But, he also was active in ingratiating himself into the community. There were coat drives and food drives and the like, but also unique touches \u2014 donating $20,000 a year for local families who couldn\u2019t pay their utility bills in winter . They loved him; he loved them. Moving on wouldn\u2019t be easy, but the franchise made the painful choice to do so. And yet, a month into the season, they cashiered the guy who brought about so many of those changes. No one in Memphis denies that the deteriorating relationship between Fizdale and Gasol was a significant factor in the decision to let Fizdale go. (Okay: Wallace calls it a \u201ccontributing factor.\u201d) But they insist that wasn\u2019t the only reason. There were the eight straight home losses at FedEx Forum, where the team had had a significant home court edge, and the Grizzlies\u2019 7-14 finish to the regular season last year. ( The 4-2 loss to the Spurs in the first round , in which Memphis gave San Antonio fits, is not part of this narrative.) \u201cWhat happens is when you\u2019ve been through this a while, you just get a sense when you look at the objective, and the eye test, the performance on the floor, and you just get the feeling that we\u2019re going to have to make a change,\u201d Wallace said. Fizdale and Gasol began drifting apart last year, less than two months into the season. A particularly rough patch came after Memphis had lost three straight home games in December, when Fizdale went hard at Gasol in a subsequent film session. Fizdale noted that Allen, who\u2019d won a ring with the Celtics in 2008, was the only player on the team who had won a championship, and that everyone else \u2014 including Gasol \u2014 needed to understand exactly what was required from players to win at that ultimate level. Gasol responded in the next game, at Detroit, with one of his best performances of the season, scoring 38 points against the Pistons on 14 of 17 shooting from the floor in a Grizzlies win. But it was a marker. Gasol was up and down all season. He had a -1.1 plus-minus rating in January , a +1.6 plus-minus in February and a -2.6 plus-minus in March . (By contrast, during that same stretch last season, Conley was +4.9 in January , +3.9 in February and +1.7 in March .) But after playing for Spain in EuroBasket in September , Gasol came to the Grizzlies\u2019 camp in great shape, at just seven percent body fat. Yet he\u2019s one of many who\u2019ve nonetheless struggled to get themselves going this season, shooting just 42.1 percent from the floor . (Only Tyreke Evans, having a career rebirth in Memphis as the Grizzlies\u2019 sixth man, has played well all season, averaging 17.9 points per game off the bench and shooting 43 percent on 3-pointers.) The on-court problems have not been helped by the off-court drama surrounding the team\u2019s ownership. Pera is almost never in Memphis for games, leaving many uncertain of his day-to-day stewardship of the franchise. Pera owns roughly a quarter of the team, which he bought in 2012 for $377 million from the late Michael Heisley. But Pera had to quickly bring in minority investors shortly after buying the team, including venture capitalist Steve Kaplan and Daniel Straus , an owner of several health care businesses. Kaplan and Straus each bought about 14 percent of the team when they came aboard. They also were given what is called a \u201cbuy-sell\u201d provision , allowing each, five years after the sale and every three years thereafter, a window in which either can attempt to buy controlling interest in the team. During the window, they can set a price for the team, after which Pera must either buy their shares at that valuation price or sell his share of the team to one or both of them. The Athletic reported last week that the buy-sell window was activated, though it is not clear whether it was Kaplan or Straus who did so. The process is expected to drag out during the entirety of the two-month window, with no decision imminent. (History also teaches that before anything involving ownership of a franchise gets too squirrely, the league usually, quietly, intervenes, and finds a single buyer with the scratch to write a single, gargantuan check to settle the matter.) In the interim, the Grizzlies gave the interim job to J.B. Bickerstaff, who unfortunately (a) is one of Fizdale\u2019s best friends; the two have known each other for two decades, and (b) has experience in this type of situation, having had to take over for Kevin McHale in Houston in 2015 after the Rockets fired McHale just 11 games into the 2015-16 season. \u201cJust a couple of years ago, he basically did the same assignment,\u201d Wallace said. \u201cHe came in with a team that got off to a slow start. He coached 70-plus games with that team, with real high visibility, veteran players, and got them in the playoffs, basically provided stability, and the team turned around. To have someone who\u2019s been through this has been a huge benefit for us.\u201d Wallace says Bickerstaff will get a real and fair shot at keeping the job permanently, and that\u2019s probably true, especially considering the Grizzlies are still on the hook to Fizdale for $3 million. The hope is that Conley will be back sooner rather than later , and that Memphis can take a run at a playoff spot in the second half of the season. Bickerstaff is trying to incorporate the faster pace and increased movement and 3-point shooting that Fizdale incorporated, while also making sure Gasol is fed. Saturday, Gasol scored 27 points on 12 of 23 shooting in the Grizzlies\u2019 116-111 loss to the Cavs \u2014 a better performance all-around, to be sure. But, still, it was another loss. \u201cMarc is still one of the elite big men in the league, and you can make the case, the most versatile,\u201d Wallace said. \u201cHe had a hell of an offseason with the Spanish national team, got in great shape, has come back from the injury two years ago and not looked back. We think his window is very much open.\u201d They have bet a lot on their big man, their biggest and best man, along with Conley, in whom they invested $150 million in 2016. If there is to be a \u201cgrit-and-grind\u201d 2.0, a hybrid of what came before and what Fizdale was trying to incorporate for the future, Gasol and Conley are the ones who\u2019ll have to fight both Father Time and a still-ravenous West to make it so. * * * MORE MORNING TIP: DA\u2019s Top 15 Rankings | Continuity pays off for Pistons | Your questions on Wizards & more * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

The Detroit Pistons misfired (sorry) in 2016-17. The team that won 44 games and looked like it was set to be a mainstay in the Eastern Conference for years \u2014 all its key players had been, by design, given long-term contracts, the franchise of the belief it would be difficult to lure free agents to Detroit \u2014 regressed last season, falling to 37-45 and falling to 10th in the East . There were rumblings that the Pistons were shopping center Andre Drummond, whose free throw calamities made it impossible for coach Stan Van Gundy to play him down the stretch of games, and they wanted to move point guard Reggie Jackson. But they couldn\u2019t find any takers. Maybe it wasn\u2019t by choice. Maybe there wasn\u2019t a deal that made sense. But the Pistons didn\u2019t move either man. They decided they could improve best from within. They opted to stay the course \u2014 with some key additions \u2014 and come back with most of their core group from last season. So far, their collective bet on their guys has paid off. Detroit has been the league\u2019s biggest surprise so far this season. And in doing so, they bet on their guys getting better. \u201cIn the business world, and in this business, too, that\u2019s what it usually comes down to: (if) things aren\u2019t going right, then change is of the essence,\u201d said forward Tobias Harris, having an All-Star caliber season. \u201cAs a player, you don\u2019t want to get traded. I\u2019ve been traded . I\u2019ve gone to good situations, but you still don\u2019t want to go through that process. I think everybody had that mentality in the locker room. That kind of molded us together even more. When we were in L.A. (working out together before training camp), we went to dinner and we said, the season we had, if you call it straight, if you looked at us like a stock, everybody\u2019s stock was down. Because we didn\u2019t win.\u201d A tough four-game road swing this weekend started with losses at Washington and Philadelphia. But the Pistons are still in fourth place in the East this morning at 14-8, with a starting unit that\u2019s been as productive as any in basketball. Van Gundy has revamped Detroit\u2019s offense. Gone are the endless elbow pick and rolls between Jackson and Drummond, which led to a lot of stagnation \u2014 last season, the Pistons were 25th in Offensive Rating , 24th in Pace , 27th in Effective Field Goal percentage and 30th \u2014 DFL \u2014 in True Shooting percentage . In their place is almost a five-out, zero-in motion offense, with Drummond facing the basket most possessions. He\u2019s facilitating through a series of dribble handoffs and off-ball cuts by guards like Avery Bradley ( acquired from Boston in a July trade for Marcus Morris ). The DHOs get guards like Jackson going downhill, make Drummond more impactful offensively as a rim runner, and clear out space for Detroit\u2019s vastly improved perimeter shooters \u2014 Harris, free-agent pickup Anthony Tolliver ( 36.5 percent on 3-pointers ) and first-round pick Luke Kennard ( 41.5 percent on 3-pointers ). Through Dec. 4, Detroit is 10th in Offensive Rating , 19th in Pace , ninth in Effective Field Goal percentage and 13th in True Shooting percentage . \u201cMy entire coaching staff felt like that, that we needed to get more movement,\u201d Van Gundy said Friday. \u201cI had my brother (Jeff, the former Knicks coach and current ABC\/ESPN analyst) do a lot of work on us. And he watches every game now and gives us a report. And he\u2019s been extremely strong on me, even through the preseason and early season games, when he thought I went away from it at times. Like, \u2018you\u2019ve got to be committed to the movement,\u2019 and everything else. And we\u2019ve developed more and more simple stuff, but more and more different alignments and looks with it. He\u2019s pushed me hard on all of that. Pretty smart guy.\u201d The Pistons have not puffed up their record with cupcake wins. They\u2019ve beaten both the Golden State Warriors and Boston Celtics on the road , with Drummond dominating the Celtics with 26 points and 22 rebounds last Monday. They\u2019ve beaten the Minnesota Timberwolves and Oklahoma City Thunder . \u201cWe thought we had to add 3-point shooting, ball movement, get back to a toughness factor with the group. Because we didn\u2019t think the way we finished was really who they were,\u201d General Manager Jeff Bower said. \u201cA lot of it was we looked at how they had played the year before as a group, and we looked at what was different last year compared to that. And it was a different group. The health of Reggie Jackson changed the group a lot. His ability to win games in the fourth quarter the year before , when he was one of the leading scorers in clutch minutes in the fourth quarter , that had a big part of us winning 44 games.\u201d Jackson only played 52 games last season, suffering from left knee tendinitis that required PRP injections but never allowed him to be at his best. Eventually, the Pistons shut him down for the season in March . And Jackson\u2019s absence wore down top reserve guard Ish Smith. Now, Jackson\u2019s back. NBAMiner.com ranks him 7th in the league this season in clutch points (defined as points in the last five minutes of a game in which neither team is ahead by more than five points) with 37, ahead of the likes of Russell Westbrook, Steph Curry, Kevin Durant and Jimmy Butler. With defenses forced to devote men and materiel to Jackson, there\u2019s all kinds of room for Drummond and others to operate. Among starting forwards, Harris ranks in the top 40 in Offensive Rating (109.1) and Effective Field Goal percentage (.575) and 14th in True Shooting percentage (.601). He had 31 points in the win in Boston, making five of six 3-pointers. \u201cA lot of that is determined just by the way we\u2019re playing offensively,\u201d Harris said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like, at times, you\u2019re going to have to choose who you want to give up, really. There\u2019s some games where I can see it more often, but there\u2019s other games where I feel like that teams are focusing in. I just kind of tell Reggie, bring it over to my side off of Andre and let\u2019s just see what they do.\u201d Harris has flashed throughout his career, both with the Milwaukee Bucks and Orlando Magic, and was a key part of the Pistons\u2019 grand experiment after they got him from the Magic in 2016 . Orlando had given Harris a four-year, $64 million deal the year before , which was part of his appeal to the Pistons; they didn\u2019t think they\u2019d be able to get someone that young and with that kind of potential in free agency. Harris started strong last season but, like almost everyone else in Detroit, faded at the end. At Van Gundy\u2019s urging, Harris has expanded his range, and taking six 3-pointers a game this season, by far the most in his career . \u201cWe wanted him to work on his 3-point shooting, and then early in the year, preseason, he wasn\u2019t shooting a lot of them,\u201d Van Gundy said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to step in, you\u2019ve got to take that shot. He\u2019s been doing that. And lately, I told him I didn\u2019t think he was running hard in transition, so he started doing that, and had the huge transition bucket down the stretch in Boston, where he outran people for a layup. So I think his ability to work, adjust and try to get better is really what stands out to me. So whatever issues he runs into will improve.\u201d No one has improved more than Drummond, though, and that\u2019s what makes the Pistons\u2019 future intriguing. Still just 24, the center remained a conundrum last year: a behemoth on the boards since coming out of college, he\u2019s led the league in offensive rebounds each  of the  last four  seasons and total rebounds  the last two . But he was invisible offensively for long stretches, and not as dominant on defense as he should have been, given his length and quickness. The offensive piece was easy to understand: Drummond shot just 38.6 percent from the foul line last season, and guys who struggle with free throws tend not to be very aggressive, lest they get fouled \u2014 and it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s done intentionally or not. But the rest of it was still a mystery. Everyone agreed, though, that the status quo was unacceptable going forward. The Pistons left it up to Drummond; they didn\u2019t crowd him or demand he work with their assistant coaches all summer. He said he\u2019d come to training camp better, and they trusted him. Drummond spent the summer working with trainer Idan Ravin and Miami-based trainer Stan Remy. Improving his mechanics was just one piece. Drummond needed to have fun again. \u201cI think for me, I went every summer for the past five years listening to so many people and working with so many different people, and doing the same thing over and over again, that it got stagnant,\u201d Drummond said. \u201cAnd it wasn\u2019t working. I work hard. I work very hard. But there\u2019s something that just wasn\u2019t clicking, and I felt I wasn\u2019t having fun anymore. So I took it back to my roots. I worked out with Stanley and Idan my first year in the league, before the Draft. And when I started working out with them, I felt myself starting to love basketball again. I found myself trying to enjoy waking up at 7 a.m. to work out. \u201cI used to dread getting up and go to the gym \u2014 \u2018ah, I\u2019ve got to get up and work out. I\u2019ve got to do a million jump hooks and run all over the place.\u2019 When I found that joy again, my whole game started changing. I found a new-found confidence.\u201d Drummond shot threes this summer. He dribbled at the top of the key. He tried Eurosteps. He did everything you wouldn\u2019t expect a seven-footer to do. But he lost 30 pounds, and regained his smile. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to ask for change, and to have agreement for change,\u201d Bower said. \u201cBut it\u2019s hard to see the effects of it, across the board. That takes conscious, and daily, intentional actions \u2014 that maybe weren\u2019t natural or instinctive. But he\u2019s worked hard at it, and he\u2019s seeing now the results of all of that work. A lot of this was internally driven in Andre. He wanted to improve; he wanted to help lead this team. And that\u2019s when it\u2019s most effective.\u201d And, at the foul line, Drummond\u2019s found a form that works for him. He starts hunched over at a deep bend of the waist, like he dropped a quarter and is just starting to pick it up . From there, he shoots. The ball doesn\u2019t have a ton of arc, but so far, it\u2019s working much better for him. Through his first 22 games this season, he\u2019s shooting 65 percent (68 of 105) from the line. No, Rick Barry is not likely impressed. But for Drummond, that\u2019s major improvement. \u201cAt the line, I didn\u2019t do anything,\u201d Drummond said. \u201cAll I did was build my confidence. I\u2019ve always been able to shoot the same shot, but it was just believing I\u2019d make the shot. So it was having that confidence boost, and believing that every shot would go in is a great feeling.\u201d Drummond now laughs his way through evenings like Saturday\u2019s with Philly\u2019s Joel Embiid, with whom he\u2019s had a big man\u2019s war of words all season . Embiid scored 30 on Drummond and the Pistons in the teams\u2019 first meeting this season, and said afterward that Drummond\u2019s trash talking got him going. Drummond replied via Twitter: \u201csee you Dec. 2.\u201d Embiid then poked at him Saturday morning, saying Drummond \u201ccan\u2019t shoot\u201d and wasn\u2019t someone that he had to concentrate on defensively. No matter what Embiid thinks, Drummond is now a big part of Detroit\u2019s offense, whether or not he\u2019s taking jumpers. \u201cI think he was always better where he was away from the basket and then rolling to the basket,\u201d Van Gundy said of Drummond. \u201cWe knew he was certainly an above average ballhandler and passer for a big, so you put those two things together. And, low post play, just in general in the league has proven to be pretty low percentage, with very few exceptions. So changing our approach, making him absolutely more involved in the offense, but a lot less in the low post, it all just seemed to make sense for us. You go into it not having really played that way extensively. We\u2019d seen flashes of it. We\u2019d do it five or six times a game. But you don\u2019t know how it will be long term. I\u2019m sure people will adjust and we\u2019ll have to make tweaks. But through 20 games, it\u2019s been pretty good for him and pretty good for us.\u201d Bradley replaced Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, who signed a one-year deal with the Lakers. (The Pistons, hard-capped, could not offer anything near what KCP wanted, and let him leave.) There was risk and reward with getting Bradley \u2014 his defensive impact may be debated by some analytics folks, but his willingness to take on the opponents\u2019 top backcourt scorer every night brings unquantifiable benefits. Offensively, Bradley has also spaced the floor \u2013 41.2 percent on 3-pointers \u2014 and has become a favorite of Drummond\u2019s on dribble handoffs, leading to unencumbered drives to the rack. But Bradley is just as productive when he doesn\u2019t shoot at all, but moves and cuts, drawing defenders with him. Two guys can run the same amount of miles in a given game, but if one is always getting open and the other isn\u2019t, those miles aren\u2019t the same. \u201cThe speed he plays with off the ball, it\u2019s the equivalent to a guy having the basketball,\u201d Harris said. \u201cHe\u2019s been able to open up the floor a lot for us as a team, and Andre\u2019s been able to make some great plays for him. Even in transition, him getting out and running. Off the ball, he\u2019s one of the best players in the NBA, if not the best. It\u2019s a huge aspect of the game that doesn\u2019t show up in the box score.\u201d The Pistons may know more about themselves after their next five games: at San Antonio and Milwaukee, followed by home games against Golden State, Boston and surging Denver. A poor stretch in those games won\u2019t define Detroit\u2019s season; Van Gundy knows the league will adjust to what they\u2019re doing, and there are rough patches to come as there are for every team. The hope is his team is better equipped to now handle them. Less, so far, has been more. \u201cThe biggest thing is, we didn\u2019t feel anything would make us a better team,\u201d Bower said. \u201cThat\u2019s really the driving force. With Stan, he never loses sight of the fact that this is a competitive project. We have to play games. We\u2019re not just trying to win a transaction. The driving force is, will this make us a better team when we have to go out and play? And that helps. That helps keep it crystallized into what we\u2019re really charged with doing.\u201d * * * MORE MORNING TIP:  Grizzlies face rocky future | DA\u2019s Top 15 Rankings | Your questions on Wizards & more * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

The answer is blowin\u2019 all the leads. From Stephen Powers: Washington\u2019s a disappointment so far, to be sure, Stephen, but I don\u2019t fault Brooks because his team can\u2019t hold onto double-digit leads \u2014 five blown ones so far this season. Everybody coughs up a game now and then, but that\u2019s way too many for a veteran team. These aren\u2019t rookies and kids; they\u2019ve been in a million playoff games the last four years and they should know how to stop an opponent\u2019s run. If the Wizards take care of business and secure just three of those five losses, they\u2019d be 15-8 and we wouldn\u2019t be having this conversation. My only issue with Brooks\u2019 rotation is that he keeps saying he needs to find time for Jason Smith, who provides energy and spaces the floor, but Smith never gets on the court. Perhaps an afternoon in the stockade will learn ya, Javie. From Sean Eldridge: I would not want to work where you work, Sean. As to your main point, believe me, most players share it. But, referees are occasionally fined and\/or suspended by the league for egregious violations of conduct. The difference is, of course, that the NBA takes those actions privately. The league maintains that the Last Two Minutes reports point out , dispassionately, when referees make errors at the ends of games, and that referee assignments for the playoffs tell you without making it overt which officials have done the best job over the course of a season. Whether or not any of us agree, the NBA feels the above is public admonition enough. Word Police on Line 3, sir. They sound agitated. Or, perhaps, unsettled. Or, stressed. Or \u2026 From Theadora Pollack: For goodness sake, I wasn\u2019t being critical of Wilt by referring to his numbers as \u201ccartoonish.\u201d That adjective points out how outsided and incredible Wilt\u2019s averages were compared to everyone else who ever played the game. It meant: these numbers are so much bigger than everyone else\u2019s, they don\u2019t seem real. Emphasis on \u201cseem.\u201d It was a compliment of his amazing stats, not a disparagement of them.

Or at least with the lights out. The last 15 minutes or so of the Warriors\u2019 game-day shootaround practice in Miami on Sunday went on despite all the lights in the arena\u2019s bowl being out. Some of the lights on the concourse were visible, but the floor was dark. Undeterred, the Warriors kept shooting. And because they\u2019re the Warriors, they made plenty. \u201cThat is a first,\u201d Warriors guard Stephen Curry said. \u201cNice little, I guess, test of muscle memory. You can somewhat see the rim, know where you are on the floor, but it\u2019s kind of a different experience because you don\u2019t get it every day. So that\u2019s pretty cool.\u201d The lights went out toward the end of the session, when coach Steve Kerr was addressing reporters and the Warriors were doing shooting drills mainly from the 3-point line. Some of the Warriors yelled in mock anger. There was at least one stretch where a group on one end of the court made eight 3-pointers in a row despite the challenged visibility. The power didn\u2019t fail: The Warriors\u2019 sound system kept working, blaring Miami-centric tunes like Gloria Estefan\u2019s \u201cConga\u201d and Trick Daddy\u2019s \u201cTake It To Da House.\u201d \u201cYou need your eyes to be able to get a sense of perception,\u201d Curry said. \u201cBut you don\u2019t necessarily need to see the rim in HD, full, spotlight-type situation to knock it down.\u201d A couple of players were done by the time the lights went out, including Kevin Durant. \u201cLuckily, the lights cut off right after I got done, so I was good,\u201d Durant said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve shot in the dark plenty of times before.\u201d The start of a Heat-Pacers game at Miami in 2016 was delayed 27 minutes because the lights were not working. It wasn\u2019t immediately known why the lights went out Sunday, and the Warriors didn\u2019t seem to think anything peculiar or some sort of gamesmanship was happening. Heat players went through their shootaround earlier Sunday in the upstairs practice facility, not on the game floor that visiting teams typically use on game days in Miami. They didn\u2019t know the Warriors were working out in the dark until afterward. \u201cThe way they shoot, I don\u2019t think it matters,\u201d Heat veteran Udonis Haslem said."},{"id":42908,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/jarrett-jack-key-new-york-knicks-turnaround-season","date":"2017-12-03","title":"Veteran point guard Jarrett Jack key to New York Knicks' turnaround season","content":" * Today on NBA League Pass: Magic vs. Knicks (3:30 ET) As brilliant as Kristaps Porzingis has been at times early this season, the \u201cUnicorn\u201d isn\u2019t the sole reason the Knicks have experienced a turnaround in their fortunes in the first year A.C.

The former was a victim of bad health, the other a casualty of the pace-and-space era. Embiid was drafted third overall in 2014, and he only dropped that low because of a stress fracture in his back and a broken right foot. More injuries piled up before he even made his NBA debut. Entering the fourth and final year of his rookie contract, the seven-foot center had played in just 31 out of a possible 246 career games. Sixers fans were implored to \u201cTrust the Process,\u201d a mantra Embiid embraced to point of assuming it as his pseudo-nickname. So far this season, he has been worth every second of the wait. The Cameroon-born big man is averaging 22.9 pionts, 11.3 rebounds and 1.8 blocks per contest, numbers equaled or bettered only by New Orleans twin towers Anthony Davis and DeMarcus Cousins. Embiid\u2019s success might only be matched by his confidence, which already knew no bounds when he was sidelined for nearly three seasons. He is an avid trash-talker, both during games and via social media. He has used both fronts to wage war on another Eastern Conference big man who is surging into relevancy: Andre Drummond. The Pistons big man is Embiid\u2019s opposite in nearly every way. Detroit fans were able to see him immediately after he was drafted ninth overall in 2012. He has missed just three games total over the last four seasons. Unlike Embiid, Drummond is not a revolutionary specimen of versatility. He does not shoot 3-pointers, nor does he like to dribble beyond one power move that takes him directly to the rim. He is a traditional center, one who enjoys blocking shots on one end and dunking on the other. In today\u2019s NBA, which punishes teams that lack versatile scoring everywhere on the floor, that type of one-dimensional big man is nearly extinct. Drummond appeared in danger of that evolution, especially after the Piston\u2019s underwhelming performance last season. He found himself unable to remain on the floor during crunch time given his league-worst 38.6-percent mark from the free throw line. His talent was undeniable. His fit in the modern game was under scrutiny. Not anymore. The sixth-year center has improved the worst parts of his game (free throw shooting, passing) while maintaining the best. Already a prolific rebounder, Drummond is averaging a career-best 15.2 boards per contest. Meanwhile, his free throw shooting has turned heads, making an absurd jump up to 63.9 percent (entering Friday night). He has also become a prime-time playmaker , averaging the fifth-most assists (3.9 per game) among all NBA centers. It is impossible to applaud their respective returns to relevance enough \u2026 unless each is talking about the other. So far this season, that conversation has produced nothing but insults and challenges between two young big men who have an inside track to Eastern Conference All-Star honors in February. It began in October, with Embiid dropping 30 points on the Pistons and proclaiming afterwards that Drummond \u201cdoesn\u2019t play any defense.\u201d The Pistons center caught wind of the insult and promptly responded with a Tweet that said \u201cSee you Dec 2nd.\u201d He followed up that challenge with further words on NBA TV. \u201cYou\u2019ve gotta respect the man\u2019s game. He\u2019s a hell of a player,\u201d Drummond said, \u201cbut he\u2019s gotta see me three or four more times for the rest of the season, so it\u2019s not gonna happen more than once.\u201d Drummond upped the ante before Friday\u2019s rematch, belittling Embiid\u2019s health-monitored playing time in an interview with Fox Sports Detroit. \u201cYou can\u2019t really have a conversation with a man who can\u2019t play a back-to-back \u2026 when he can play a whole season without taking a rest, he can come talk to me.\u201d Round 2 of Embiid-Drummond arrived, and it did not disappoint. After Embiid led Philadelphia to a 63-47 halftime lead, Drummond spearheaded a Pistons rally, ultimately finishing with 14 points, 11 rebounds, six assists and five steals. The Sixers held on for the win, however, behind Embiid\u2019s 25 points and 10 rebounds. Each enjoyed highlights at the other\u2019s expense. The scene of the night occurred when Embiid drew Drummond\u2019s sixth personal foul, disqualifying the Pistons big man from a three-point game with 2:35 remaining. The Sixers center added a goodbye wave to his fouled-out foe , inserting yet another barb into what is quickly becoming one of the more visible one-on-one rivalries in the league. Both parties will have something to crow about. Drummond backers will boast that Embiid needed 21 shots (on which he shot 33 percent) to get his numbers. Embiid supporters will claim the numbers anyway and add two straight victories into the argument for good measure. If their respective teams were struggling as they have in years past, their tiff would probably receive more of a shoulder shrug. They aren\u2019t. If the season ended today, the Pistons and Sixers would face each other in the first round of the playoffs as the fourth and fifth seeds, respectively. These games matter. The players, especially in a conference diluted of star power, matter. For the first time since the mid-2000s, their teams matter. Further challenges between Embiid and Drummond carry risk and rewards that could come into play come April.

But because the 82-game schedule is a marathon and not a sprint, there was no need to start sweating over a team that has James (just as there\u2019s no reason to count out an Oklahoma City team with Russell Westbrook, for anyone pushing OKC to the edge before Christmas).

Here\u2019s how Dave McMenamin of ESPN is calling it :"},{"id":42930,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/utah-jazz-rookie-donovan-mitchell-makes-statement","date":"2017-12-02","title":"Utah Jazz rookie Donovan Mitchell makes statement with 41-point performance","content":"Over the past six years, Utah invested four lottery picks into backcourt talent. The need was real. The Jazz had already set its foundation in the frontcourt, even if that foundation morphed from Al Jefferson and Paul Millsap to Derrick Favors and Rudy Gobert. Those draft picks, however, never panned out as hoped. Three of them \u2014 Alec Burks, Dante Exum and Rodney Hood \u2014 are still with the team, but injuries have severely crippled their progress and impact. Entering this season, the trio had missed a combined 331 regular season games out of a possible 968. That\u2019s more than one third of their on-court impact down the drain. The fourth guard \u2014 Trey Burke, taken 10th overall in 2013 \u2014 was traded after three seasons and is now trying to earn an NBA return in the G League. In 2015, Utah decided to draft forward Trey Lyles instead, but that choice looked iffy at best now that the guard taken one pick later (Devin Booker) is putting up more than 20 points per game for a second consecutive season. Lyles, meanwhile, struggled to thrive in Utah\u2019s loaded frontcourt, and ultimately fell out of the rotation. The lack of backcourt staying power left the Jazz especially vulnerable last summer, when All-Star swingman Gordon Hayward departed via free agency for the Boston Celtics. His absence created an immediate void of perimeter scoring for Utah, a problem that intensified when Exum suffered a separated shoulder during a preseason game. The fourth-year guard could be out for the entire season. One bad stroke of luck, however, wound up working for Utah\u2019s benefit. The Jazz found Lyles a new home in Denver and received the 13th overall pick of this year\u2019s draft for their troubles. With it, they selected Donovan Mitchell , who faced questions about whether his size (6-3, 190 pounds) matched his position (shooting guard). Six weeks into his rookie season, Mitchell is providing more than enough answers. After a cold shooting start to the year, the former Louisville standout is enjoying the most explosively efficient week of his young career, punctuated by a franchise rookie best 41 points against New Orleans on Friday night. The performance caps off an impressive four-game stretch in which Mitchell is averaging 26.3 points on 52.2-percent shooting, including a sizzling 19-of-37 from 3-point range. In Thursday night\u2019s victory over the Clippers, the 6-3 guard invaded highlight reels with a change-of-hands alley-oop and a tomahawk slam in transition. Friday was even better. Mitchell scored 17 of his 41 in the fourth quarter, helping Utah erase a 16-point deficit and secure its fifth consecutive victory. Everything was on display, from long-distance bombs to driving forays complete with wizardry around the rim. It was the best scoring performance by an NBA rookie since Blake Griffin in 2011, and only six other active players can claim 40-point games from their respective rookie seasons: Carmelo Anthony, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Eric Gordon, Blake Griffin and LeBron James. Mitchell\u2019s rise could not be better timed for the Jazz, who are trying to remain afloat in the Western Conference standings despite a knee injury to Gobert . Rather than buckle under the lack of star power, the Jazz are somehow thriving thanks in no small part to their confident rookie. It may still prove too much to ask him to fill the scoring vacuum left behind by Hayward. Then again, Mitchell\u2019s career-high is already one point better than his predecessor\u2019s."},{"id":42939,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/old-school-power-rankings-2017-18-weeks-5-6","date":"2017-12-02","title":"Old School Power Rankings 2017-18: Weeks 5-6","content":"Is it time to consider putting the King in a group all by himself? After all, as our colleague Sekou Smith points out, the man seems to be defying Father Time. Even as a certain big man in the River City turns up his game in a big way, no ground is gained. Such is life when you live in his kingdom. Meanwhile, there\u2019s a gritty point guard in Houston getting up to speed after missing the last 14 games with a knee bruise. Give him another two weeks before he becomes a serious factor in the OSPR chase. Notes: Season statistics are through games of Nov. 30 Any player who turns 32 during regular season can be added to rankings. Check out previous rankings 1. LeBron James (32), Cleveland Cavaliers Previous rank: 1 Last weeks\u2019 stats: 7 games, 27.4 ppg, 10.0 rpg, 8.0 apg Season stats: 28.0 ppg, 8.1 rpg, 8.5 apg Another two-week stint, another three games with 30 or more points. James seems to be boring us with his impressive play in Year 15. In fact, James has been held under 20 points just twice over the last 15 games. Want more? The four-time MVP continues to shoot at career-high numbers: 58.4 from the field and 42.5 from beyond the arc. 2. LaMarcus Aldridge (32), San Antonio Spurs Previous rank: 3 Last weeks\u2019 stats: 6 games, 25.8 ppg, 7.8 rpg, 2.0 apg Season stats: 23.1 ppg, 8.2 rpg, 2.3 apg With Monday\u2019s 33-point effort against the Mavericks and Wednesday\u2019s 41 points vs. Memphis, Aldridge notched back-to-back 30-point games for first time since March 25-28, 2016. Wednesday\u2019s monster performance also gave us a first from the big man: three made 3-pointers in one game, going a perfect 3-for-3. 3. Marc Gasol (32), Memphis Grizzlies Previous rank: 2 Last weeks\u2019 stats: 6 games, 15.2 ppg, 8.0 rpg, 6.2 apg Season stats: 18.6 ppg, 8.9 rpg, 4.3 apg To say it was an interesting week for Gasol would be an understatement. First there was this, quickly followed by this. Gasol, like the Grizzlies, is struggling, shooting just 35.5 FG% and 27.3 3PT% over the last six games. In fact, over that span, Gasol\u2019s best shooting performance was last Friday\u2019s 5-for-13 (38.5). 4. Carmelo Anthony (33), Oklahoma City Thunder Previous rank: 4 Last weeks\u2019 stats: 6 games, 18.8 ppg, 6.3 rpg, 1.8 apg Season stats: 19.7 ppg, 6.2 rpg, 1.6 apg Anthony is reeling, and now there\u2019s chatter of whether moving him to the bench is the answer. Shooting at what would be a career-low 41.9, Anthony has been unspectacular yet consistent, scoring no more than 22 and no less than 16 in seven straight. This after he started the season with six straight games of 20 or more. 5. Taj Gibson (32), Minnesota Timberwolves Previous rank: 5 Last weeks\u2019 stats: 8 games, 11.9 ppg, 9.4 rpg, 2.0 apg Season stats: 10.8 ppg, 8.3 rpg, 1.5 apg Gibson continues to be a double-double machine, managing in three straight and nine so far this season. Remember, he had 11 all of last season. Of course the Wolves saw the best from Gibson when they won. In four wins, he averaged 15 points, 11 rebounds and 62.9 FG%. In four losses, Gibson went for 8.8 points, 7.8 rebounds and 50 FG%. 6. Chris Paul (32), Houston Rockets Previous rank: NA Last weeks\u2019 stats: 5 games, 12.6 ppg, 3.6 rpg, 10.4 apg Season stats: 11.1 ppg, 4.3 rpg, 10.3 apg Look who joins the fun. And we\u2019re not going out on a limb when we predict he\u2019ll be somewhere on this list the rest of the season \u2026 as long as he stays healthy. Having been sidelined since the season opener, Paul\u2019s shooting is still a bit rusty (44.9 FG%), but he also reeled off three straight games of 12 or more assists. 7. Courtney Lee (32), New York Knicks Previous rank: 9 Last weeks\u2019 stats: 7 games, 14.6 ppg, 3.9 rpg, 3.4 apg Season stats: 12.6 ppg, 3.8 rpg, 3.0 apg Why are Lee\u2019s offensive numbers up across the board this season. \u201cWe\u2019re not running the triangle,\u201d he recently told the Daily News. It\u2019s hard to argue with the results so far. Lee\u2019s scored in double figures in six straight, shooting a blistering 61.7 from the field and 52.9 from deep. For good measure, he chipped in 1.6 steals over that span. 8. Zach Randolph (36), Sacramento Kings Previous rank: 8 Last weeks\u2019 stats: 7 games, 12.7 ppg, 5.7 rpg, 2.4 apg Season stats: 12.9 ppg, 5.9 rpg, 2.0 apg The two-week period couldn\u2019t have started any uglier for Randolph, who notched a goose egg on Nov. 17 (zero points on 0-for-4 shooting in 14 minutes). But the veteran rebounded fairly nicely with six consecutive double-digit scoring games, shooting better than 50 percent in five of those to go along with five or more boards in all six. 9. Pau Gasol (37), San Antonio Spurs Previous rank: Just missed Last weeks\u2019 stats: 6 games, 13.8 ppg, 7.2 rpg, 2.2 apg Season stats: 11.4 ppg, 7.9 rpg, 3.3 apg It looks like it\u2019s going to be a roller-coaster ride all season with Gasol. After a six-point showing Monday, the 7-footer went for 17, 17 and 25 in the next three. He followed that up with an ugly four-point performance on 2-for-6 shooting. But we have been impressed with the long-range game, hitting eight 3-pointers in the last three games and 44.9 3PT% for the season. 10. J.J. Redick (33), Philadelphia 76ers Previous rank: 10 Last weeks\u2019 stats: 7 games, 16.6 ppg, 2.6 rpg, 2.7 apg Season stats: 15.4 ppg, 2.9 rpg, 3.6 apg Redick keeps his spot by the slimmest of margins. If not for last Saturday\u2019s effort (29 points on 10-for-18 shooting including 8-for-12 3-pointers), he would\u2019ve fallen off. Like Gasol, it appears Redick is going to be up and down all season. After going for 20 in back-to-back games, Redick turned in an 11-point showing. He then bounced back with the aforementioned 29. Just missed the cut: Dwyane Wade, J.J. Barea, Dirk Nowitzki, Marcin Gortat, Trevor Ariza Will turn 32 this season: Dwight Howard (Dec. 8), Gerald Green (Jan. 26), Rajon Rondo (Feb. 22), Corey Brewer (March 5), Kyle Lowry (March 25), Marco Belinelli (March 25).

The Detroit Pistons have road wins over the Celtics and Golden State Warriors. And the Cleveland Cavaliers enter December on a 10-game winning streak. The Toronto Raptors , sitting in fourth place in the Eastern Conference at 13-7 , have flown a little bit under the radar. But as we turn the calendar, the Raptors are the only East team that ranks in the top 10 in both offensive and defensive efficiency. And given their December schedule , the Raptors should remain in the top 10 on both ends of the floor for a while. Though they\u2019ll be on the road for much of the month, the Raptors have the league\u2019s easiest December schedule, with only three of their games (two at home) against teams (Indiana and Philadelphia) that currently have winning records . The other 11 games are against the 13 teams that are currently below .500 . Through November, Toronto is the league\u2019s only undefeated team (they\u2019re 5-0) against that group. The Raps head west for a four-game trip, but the four opponents on that trip \u2013 the Grizzlies, Kings, Clippers and Suns \u2013 have a cumulative record of 29-55. Through Thursday, there are five teams that rank in the bottom 10 on both ends of the floor , and the Raptors play six games against four of those five teams, facing the Suns and Kings twice. The toughest December game for the Raptors\u2019 defense will be its first one. They host the Pacers\u2019 No. 6 offense on Friday, Dec. 1. After that, their remaining December games are against offenses that currently rank 18th or worse , or are the 10th-ranked Clippers without Blake Griffin. After the Indiana game, the Raptors won\u2019t face a team that currently has a top-10 offense until Jan. 11, when they host the Cavs. They actually have the easiest December schedule in regard to both opposing offenses and opposing defenses. The Raptors will have three back-to-backs in December, and the second game of each of those will be against an opponent that didn\u2019t play the day before. But they will also have three games in which they have a rest advantage, where their opponent is playing the second game of a back-to-back and the Raptors are not. With Toronto, we always have to wait and see what happens in the playoffs. But these Raptors are playing a little different \u2013 they\u2019ve had the league\u2019s biggest increase in assist percentage and its second biggest increase in the percentage of its shots that have come from 3-point range \u2013 and there\u2019s nothing wrong with playing well in the regular season. This month is when Toronto can do the work that secures a higher playoff position and, maybe, home-court advantage through more than one round. More Eastern Conference notes\u2026 Over the last 40 years, five teams have ranked last in defensive efficiency in consecutive seasons. The Los Angeles Lakers of the last two seasons were the latest. And then the Lakers ranked fourth defensively through their first 18 games this season , allowing 10.3 fewer points per 100 possessions than they did last season. Nothing that happened in the first month of the season was more surprising. But in their last three games, the Lakers have allowed 113 points per 100 possessions , dropping them from fourth to eighth in defensive efficiency for the season. They still rank as the league\u2019s most improved defensive team from last season, but some slippage is showing \u2026 and more slippage may be coming. Nine of the Lakers\u2019 14 December games will be against teams that currently rank in the top 10 in offensive efficiency (no other team plays more than seven December games against that group). That includes two games against the No. 1 ranked Warriors and three against the No. 2 ranked Rockets. Only two of the Lakers\u2019 December games \u2013 Dec. 23 vs. Portland and Dec. 27 vs. Memphis \u2013 are against bottom-10 offensive teams. The Lakers have the league\u2019s toughest December schedule, with eight of their 14 games (including seven of the first nine) on the road and 11 of the 14 against teams that currently have winning records. Their January schedule is much easier, but it may be tough for the Lakers to recover from what happens over the next 31 days.

The Hall of Famer has had a front row seat as an analyst for the Atlanta Hawks for the third act of the LeBron James Show that is currently playing at an NBA arena near you. Wilkins marveled at the young LeBron who dazzled during his first stint in Cleveland . His appreciation for LeBron\u2019s game grew when James took his talents to South Beach and won titles with the Miami Heat . But Wilkins, who has a statue of his own out front of the building LeBron owned Thursday night when the Cavaliers polished off the Hawks for their 10th straight win , believes the LeBron we\u2019re seeing now, in his 15th season, might be the best version yet. Given the knowledge, skill and still startling athleticism and physicality the league\u2019s best player puts on display every night, it\u2019s hard to argue. LeBron has guided the Cavaliers out of an early 5-7 funk with a November to remember. One spellbinding effort after another are fueling his rise up the Kia Race to the MVP Ladder, where he sits behind only James Harden this week. \u201cRemarkable,\u201d Wilkins said of the things James is doing in his 15th season, \u201cAbsolutely remarkable. Knowing what it takes to perform at that level for as long as he has, it\u2019s hard to wrap your head around the way he\u2019s dominating this league right now. But he\u2019s put in the work. He\u2019s done all the hard work, taken care of his body and studied his craft like a true genius. This isn\u2019t an accident or some fluke. Give him credit. He worked for this. And like I said \u2026 remarkable.\u201d Expected is more like it. LeBron\u2019s meticulous nature about everything he does has no doubt contributed to his beating back of Father Time. His elite-level contemporaries (Dwyane Wade, Carmelo Anthony, Chris Paul and perhaps a few others) haven\u2019t held up physically to the test of time the way he has. He also sticks out among his fellow all-time greats of any era with the staying power of his overall game, which has aged superbly. \u201cThere\u2019s never been a player in his 15th season who was unquestionably the best player in the league,\u201d NBA TV and TNT analyst Greg Anthony said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just that [LeBron] is really good in his 15th year. He\u2019s the best player.\u201d It comes as no surprise to anyone who\u2019s had to compete against him throughout the years. Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer has dealt with LeBron his entire career, first from the other side of the conference divide while an assistant in San Antonio, and more recently in the direct line of fire as an Eastern Conference rival. Seeing the continued evolution of LeBron\u2019s game up close and personal drives home the point for Budenholzer, who witnessed Tim Duncan\u2019s dominance from the inside. \u201cIt\u2019s my fifth year in the East and I\u2019ve just come to expect the best from LeBron,\u201d Budenholzer said. \u201cHe\u2019s a phenomenal player and I think he takes a lot of pride in being the best. So if that means shooting better, defending better, rebounding better or passing more, he just has a knack for having the determination to be that guy. So at the end of the day, no it doesn\u2019t surprise me.\u201d That\u2019s why it wasn\u2019t at all shocking to see LeBron work over the Hawks in the second half Thursday night by focusing his energy on playing the role of lockdown defender on speedy point Dennis Schr\u00f6der, who was two steps faster than anyone the Cavaliers put in front of him in the first half. With LeBron guarding him and running the show, as usual, on the other end, the outcome was in little doubt by the end of the third quarter. \u201cI just wanted to try to take the challenge against Schr\u00f6der,\u201d LeBron said. \u201cHe is one of the fastest guys that we\u2019ve got in our league. Once he gets a head full of steam down, he can finish at the rim and he was kicking our butts in the first half. So, I tried to use my intelligence against him. With the help of teammates, I tried to do a good job on him. I felt like if I could turn his water down some, then it would have an effect on the rest of those guys, and also an effect on us offensively, and it was just that \u2014 exactly what happened. \u201cI take a lot of pride in my defensive abilities. No matter if I\u2019m guarding the point guard, no matter if I\u2019m guarding the power forward or the center or the shooting guard or small forward, I take the challenge. My teammates asked me to take the challenge. I wanted the challenge and, I was just there for it. But more importantly, my teammates were there for me on the other end. They started knocking down shots, especially in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter. It allowed me to focus on my defense.\u201d That sort of versatility, that kind of attention to detail on whatever the task at hand might be, it\u2019s all a part of what continues to separate LeBron from the crowd, even at this stage of his career. It\u2019s more of what Wilkins insists makes him so \u2026 remarkable. * * * The top five in the Week 7 edition of the 2017-18  Kia Race to the MVP Ladder : Last week\u2019s ranking: No. 1 Season stats:  31.5 points, 9.8 assists, 5.2 rebounds No one hated flipping that calendar this morning more than Harden, whose epic November came up just shy of being historic. Harden averaged 34.9 points and 10.1 assists in 13 games, missing out on joining Oscar Robertson and Tiny Archibald as the only players to average 35 points and 10 games in a calendar month (minimum 10 games). Harden benefited from the healthy and effective return of Chris Paul, but was burning up the competition both before and after Paul made it back to the lineup. The best part, for Rockets fans and certainly coach Mike D\u2019Antoni, is Harden being unimpressed with his work so far. He insists the Rockets have a ways to go before they really hit their mark; never mind that 17-4 record leads the Western Conference and their 9-1 mark in their last 10 games is best mark behind Cleveland\u2019s 10-0 run. Last week\u2019s ranking:  No. 3 Season stats:  28.0 points, 8.5 assists, 8.1 rebounds LeBron ignored the whispers when the Cavaliers were 5-7 and looking like a shell of the team that has conquered the Eastern Conference in each of the past three seasons. Now, chest-deep into the Cavaliers\u2019 10-game win streak, he looks as comfortable as ever with his new supporting cast. And the entire league knows that a dialed-in LeBron, especially this early in the regular season, means trouble for everyone. LeBron\u2019s focus, on both ends of the floor, remains as good as it gets. He\u2019s been spectacular during the streak. And he had a brilliant November (averaging 29.6 points on .583 shooting from the floor, .430 from beyond the 3-point line, to go along with 8.6 rebounds, 8.5 assists, 1.5 steals and 1.2 blocks), showing no signs of slowing down with his 33rd birthday 29 days away. Last week\u2019s ranking:  No. 2 Season stats:  23.4 points, 5.2 assists, 3.3 rebounds The Celtics\u2019 19-4 record, the top mark in the league, remains the most remarkable digits associated with Kyrie\u2019s season. It turns out he won\u2019t need to chase a scoring title to stay involved in the MVP conversation this season, not as long as the Celtics continue to defy the odds and exceed all expectations after losing Gordon Hayward five minutes into the season opener and dropping their first two games. But just in case anyone forgot, he had his shot-making arsenal on full display in Thursday\u2019s win over the upstart Philadelphia 76ers , finishing the Joel Embiid-less Sixers with a wicked 36-point effort that saw him knock down 12 of his 21 shots from the floor, 5-of-8 from beyond the 3-point line and 7-of-8 from the free throw line. It was his fifth 30-point game of the month and the season. Surely he has more of those type of performances in him and the Celtics will need them to keep up their current pace. Last week\u2019s ranking: No. 4 Season stats:  26.1 points, 6.4 assists, 5.2 rebounds That bruised hand Curry has been nursing, the one that kept him out of Monday\u2019s loss to Sacramento, didn\u2019t keep him from shining in Wednesday\u2019s matchup against Lakers rookie Lonzo Ball in Los Angeles. Every bit of Curry\u2019s 28 points, seven assists and five rebounds were needed to help the Warriors subdue the Lakers in overtime. Curry\u2019s listed as \u201cprobable\u201d for tonight\u2019s game against the Magic ( 7 ET, NBA League Pass ) in Orlando, where the Warriors will face a much-improved team with another young point guard in Elfrid Payton, who is eager to get a shot at the two-time Kia MVP. Curry and the Warriors are used to it, taking everyone\u2019s best shot, particularly on the road. And that might be the best place for Curry this season, since his shooting averages away from Oracle Arena (.492 from the floor, .422 from deep) are significantly better than they are at home (.433 and .307). Last week\u2019s ranking:  No. 5 Season stats:  22.9 points, 11.3 rebounds, 3.3 assists Embiid sat out Thursday\u2019s game against Boston, the second game of a back-to-back set, for rest (or whatever fancy phrase they\u2019re using for it these days in Philadelphia). That means he should be well rested for what could be one of the more entertaining matchups of this early season when Andre Drummond and the surging Detroit Pistons make their way to Wells Fargo Center Saturday night ( 7:30 ET, NBA League Pass ). Embiid\u2019s choice words for Drummond after he roasted the Pistons\u2019 big man for 30 points and nine rebounds in the Sixers\u2019 Oct. 23 win in Detroit are sure to come up a time or two between now and tip off. Embiid loves playing to the crowd, be it at home or basically anywhere, so there should be no shortage of fireworks, even with Drummond, one of the few men in the league with the size, agility and athleticism to match Embiid, and the Pistons working on the second of a back-to-back set that has them in Washington tonight. The next five: 6. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks 7. Kevin Durant, Golden State Warriors 8. DeMar DeRozan, Toronto Raptors 9. LaMarcus Aldridge, San Antonio Spurs 10. Russell Westbrook, Oklahoma City Thunder And five more \u2026: DeMarcus Cousins, New Orleans Pelicans; Andre Drummond, Detroit Pistons; Damian Lillard, Portland Trail Blazers; Kristaps Porzingis, New York Knicks; Karl-Anthony Towns, Minnesota Timberwolves * * * A behind-the-scenes look at Andre Drummond from an Eastern Conference scout: \u201cHe might be the most confusing player to evaluate for me in the entire league, seriously. He\u2019s so gifted, he\u2019s such a physical specimen and he clearly cares about being a great player \u2014 you don\u2019t improve your free throw shooting the way he has and not give a damn about it. And yet there are still those moments, those instances where it seems like he\u2019s coasting or he\u2019s not engaged to the fullest, in a way that would see him dominate on an every night basis. It\u2019s what keeps him out of the conversation about the best big man in the league. I mean, he\u2019s on the list, when you talk about the best centers. But if we\u2019re talking Boogie [DeMarcus Cousins), Joel Embiid, Anthony Davis and those guys, he\u2019s not on that same level. And I know he\u2019s been an All-Star, which he earned. He earned that. But he should be dominant every night. I know it sounds crazy to say it like this, but if Drummond had Zach Randolph\u2019s attitude, with that size, body and athleticism, he\u2019d be a guy you talked about being one of the best players in the game, regardless of his position. That\u2019s why I think Stan [Van Gundy] has been so good for him, whether he realizes it or not. He needs a coach that is going to push him, to do whatever it takes to drag his best out of him. For example, the way they\u2019re involving him as a facilitator in their high-post offense this season is ideal. It forces him to stay locked in even when he\u2019s not just cleaning up around the rim. He can be devastating when he\u2019s playing the right way. It\u2019s good to see. Because he\u2019s got everything you need to be among the best of the very best.\u201d * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

For now, and until LaVine suits up this season and beyond, his value to Chicago is strictly to be determined. The two-time NBA Slam Dunk champ is back in the practice gym in his recovery from left knee (anterior cruciate ligament) surgery. Playing 1-on-1 with teammates, working out with the G-League Windy City Bulls in Chicago\u2019s northwest suburbs and improving his timing and his conditioning, LaVine is penciled in to make his season debut before the end of 2017. Meanwhile, though, the Bulls have two other pieces to show from the Butler deal: stretch-four forward Lauri Markkanen and point guard Kris Dunn. Both have offered glimpses of what they can do and how they might fit into the team\u2019s long-term vision that someday won\u2019t prioritize losing. Markkanen, the lanky Finn by way of the University of Arizona, is averaging 13.8 points, 7.6 rebounds and in 30 minutes. He\u2019s putting up 7.2 3-point shots per game and hitting 31.7 percent. His 140 attempts from the arc ranked 14th in the NBA \u2013 more than Bradley Beal (126), more than Carmelo Anthony (125) \u2013 and Markkanen\u2019s 48 makes are the most by any player in his first 20 games. Dunn, whose disappointing 2016-17 rookie season with Minnesota essentially has gotten a reset, was at 12 ppg, 4.8 rpg and 4.2 apg after having 19 points, five rebounds and five assists in Thursday night\u2019s loss at Denver. The 23-year-old from Providence is shooting 43.2 percent on 3-pointers (43.2 percent) and his steal percentage of 3.8 \u2013 an estimate of the percent of opponents\u2019 possessions ending in Dunn steals \u2013 ranked No. 1 in the NBA. Their trajectories have been somewhat different so far in 2017-18: Markkanen has been consistent while fighting through a flu bug and some road weariness, while Dunn has played his best most recently. But they\u2019ve both contributed in ways that, aside from the Bulls\u2019 relentless losing, suggests brighter days and in time a positive verdict on that headline-grabbing, bit-spitting trade.  It\u2019s fair to say that the Bulls, when they acquired Markkanen as the No. 7 selection in the Draft last June, got a sleeper. No, literally. That\u2019s about all the 20-year-old native of Vantaa, Finland was able to do after a hectic spring leading up to the draft followed by a tortuous summer at the Las Vegas Summer League and a key role for his home country\u2019s national team in the FIBA Eurobasket 2017 tournament. Markkanen\u2019s single season at Arizona not only acclimated him to the American game, it earned him all-American status and a taste of the NCAA tournament before the Wildcats lost to Xavier. In the Euro competition, he averaged 19.5 points and 5.7 rebounds before heading to Chicago for an early jump on training camp. \u201cWhen he came over here, he was exhausted,\u201d Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg said. \u201cThe week before training camp was completely lost time \u2013 he needed to recharge his batteries. So, we really didn\u2019t know what we had. He was still tired when we started camp. We didn\u2019t throw him out there for all the drills, just as part of the process in getting his body back. \u201cBut then every time he stepped on the floor, he showed a little more.\u201d First Markkanen demonstrated he would crack the rotation. Then \u2013 when forwards Nikola Mirotic (facial injuries) and Bobby Portis (suspension for the punch that caused them) r endered themselves unavailable two days before the season opener \u2013 Markkanen was thrust into the starting lineup. Butterflies? Rookie mistakes? Not so much. Markkanen looked almost unflappable in averaging 17.2 points and 9.3 rebounds through his first six appearances, with a high of 25 points at Miami and double-doubles against San Antonio and Atlanta. \u201cWe had to adjust our offense,\u201d Hoiberg said, \u201cand put in some new things to try to get him the ball in different spots on the floor, because of his versatility to score.\u201d Justin Holiday was one of the teammates who learned quickly to get the ball more often to the tall blond guy. \u201cHe\u2019s playing consistent, and that\u2019s a very mature thing to do in this league,\u201d Holiday said. \u201cWhat\u2019s maybe surprising is his confidence in shooting the ball. He\u2019s not afraid to shoot it.\u201d Said Markkanen, whose father Pekka lettered at Kansas before returning home to play professionally: \u201cI\u2019m expecting big things from myself. I think that\u2019s what motivates me every day. Whatever I do, I\u2019m not satisfied. So, I try to set higher goals every time I step on the court. Try to do things better. \u201cIt\u2019s going to get harder, I know that. I\u2019m trying to face it like any other job. Just go at it positively, fight through it, put the work in, and I think it will work itself out.\u201d At 20 games and counting, Markkanen will soon blow by the 37 he played in college, and the workload probably has something to do with his recent production; in his five most recent games before Thursday, he shot 25.4 percent, including 11-of-39 from the arc. He says he has adjusted from one game to the next \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t want to give my scouting report, but I try to add something new and figure out what they\u2019re going to throw at me,\u201d he said. He even drew praise from the great LeBron James after hitting four 3-pointers in the fourth quarter of a preseason game against the Cavaliers. Markkanen hasn\u2019t been fooled by Chicago\u2019s relatively balmy late-autumn weather and has to be one of the few NBA players to welcome winter\u2019s chill (\u201cI\u2019m actually looking forward to snow\u201d). He isn\u2019t flinching from the Bulls\u2019 task at hand, either, which looks longer and more laborious with each lopsided defeat. \u201cI understand this part of a process,\u201d said Markkanen, who would appear to be on his way to the Rising Stars Challenge game at All-Star Weekend in Los Angeles. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a young group. We\u2019re having tough times. \u2026 It\u2019s about sticking together and having everyone know that. We can\u2019t afford to not trust or not be a good teammate.\u201d  Dunn\u2019s young career was looking a little snakebit. He suffered a concussion in the first game he played for Minnesota in the 2016 Las Vegas Summer League. This time, he had to leave the Bulls\u2019 Vegas entry early to attend to family matters. Then the point guard got hurt in a preseason game against Milwaukee Oct. 7, winding up with an \u201copen dislocation\u201d of his left index finger. All those setbacks cost Dunn valuable learning time, as far as running first the Wolves\u2019 and then the Bulls\u2019 attacks. He never fully recovered from it last season, sputtering through a rookie season that fell far short of his and others\u2019 expectations. His fellow Class of 2016 draftees had voted him the most likely to snag the Rookie of the Year award, but it went instead to Milwaukee\u2019s Malcolm Brogdon, who\u2019d been chosen in the second round 31 spots after Dunn. This time, Dunn was out of action until Chicago\u2019s fifth regular season game. And the delay showed in his performances: 9.8 points per game, 4.5 rebounds, 3.4 assists, and 38.6 percent shooting in his first eight games. One Bulls insider said Dunn \u201chad a lot going on in his head\u201d from last season\u2019s failures, even as he tried to get traction in Chicago. Said Holiday, 28, who went undrafted and bounced through five organizations in barely three years from 2013 to 2016: \u201cWhen you\u2019re young, man, everybody\u2019s pushing. Who knows what was going on his head? He might have been trying to be perfect. Sometimes it takes time. It\u2019s a big role. \u201cBut he has the confidence to do it, where last year maybe he didn\u2019t have as much confidence. All you can really do is go out and play hard, and if it works out, it works out.\u201d Over Dunn\u2019s past seven games before Thursday, he was a more effective, more efficient player: 13.6 ppg, 4.9 rpg, 5.0 apg, while averaging 2.1 steals and 27.7 minutes. He had made nine of 15 3-pointers, compared to 6 of 21 to start the season. Already in the five weeks he\u2019s been active, he has played about 30 percent of the total minutes he got in 78 appearances for Minnesota\u2019s Tom Thibodeau. The Bulls have been 3.6 points better when he\u2019s been on the floor, too. That\u2019s not enough to tip outcomes, but keep in mind the Wolves were 2.6 points worse a year ago with Dunn in the game. He played probably his best NBA game Tuesday against Phoenix, scoring 24 points on 10 of 16 shooting with eight assists, four rebounds and four steals. If not for a couple of egregious turnovers among his four, he might have agreed with Hoiberg\u2019s \u201cterrific\u201d assessment. That performance came 48 hours after Dunn had scored two points and missed all six of his field-goal attempts against Miami. Hoiberg sought him out and demanded that the second-year guard play more aggressively, and Dunn proved his coach right. \u201cHe called me out,\u201d Dunn said. \u201cWhen a coach calls you out, you try to play as hard as you can. I had to get through my mind, \u2018Go out and play the way I used to play. With that aggression. On defense, on offense. Try to stay down in errors as much as I can and get everybody involved.\u2019 \u201cI want to be an elite point guard one day and I understand, the best point guards don\u2019t make those killer turnovers. If I want to reach my goal, I have to get better each and every day in practice, watch film and, y\u2019know, think a little smarter when you\u2019re playing.\u201d Some have suggested Boston\u2019s Marcus Smart as a legitimate comparison for Dunn, given their defensive aptitudes and challenges both face when shooting from range. Dunn is a huge fan of Smart, but believes he can be a full-service, top-notch playmaker. Mostly, he finally looks comfortable with this reset to his NBA experience. \u201cIndividually for me, it is a reset,\u201d Dunn said. \u201cI say this is my first year because I didn\u2019t get too many minutes and I didn\u2019t play the right position in Minnesota. I was a two, a three, sometimes a one. But this is my first year of [regularly] playing the point guard. As a team, we don\u2019t have Jimmy, we don\u2019t have [Rajon] Rondo, we don\u2019t have Dwyane Wade, so we\u2019re all trying to figure it out.

Granted, there\u2019s ample evidence to the contrary, what with players signing contracts to team up with buddies or logging onto social media to volunteer opinions on how their pals employed elsewhere are coached or managed. What has been a long tradition of professional respect for rivals has morphed into fraternal bonding and beyond. Almost any night, at every final horn or buzzer, it\u2019s man-hugs and chitchat all around. Still, it is permitted to dislike an opponent. It\u2019s even OK not to hang out, break bread or Facebook-friend with the occasional teammate. So, Nikola Mirotic and Bobby Portis should get to work, defuse further drama, avoid at all costs any more confrontations and help the Chicago Bulls achieve \u2026 whatever it is the Bulls are trying to achieve this season. Mirotic, Chicago\u2019s fourth-year stretch big, spoke to the media Wednesday for the first time since being punched by teammate Bobby Portis Oct. 17 and sent to the hospital and into rehab with to facial fractures and a concussion. While it seemed clear that Mirotic was eager to put the incident behind them, he stopped short several times of declaring or indicating a full-blown, unconditional, \u201cKumbaya\u201d resolution. \u201cI\u2019ve been playing this game nine years professionally. I was always a good teammate, always professional to everybody, and I\u2019m going to continue to do that,\u201d Mirotic said, deflecting one question about their relationship going forward. \u201cIf I\u2019m here, it\u2019s because I want to support the team. He\u2019s a part of the team. I\u2019m going to support him too. Obviously, I\u2019m going to give him hands like he\u2019s going to give me hands too.\u201d He meant fist-bumps, not bare knuckles. Portis apologized publicly one week after the skirmish on the practice floor mere days before the Bulls\u2019 season opener. Then he sat out an eight-game suspension that even NBA commissioner Adam Silver got asked about \u2013 Silver deemed the penalty appropriate and allowed the Bulls to handle the matter internally. After telling reporters Wednesday that he accepted Portis\u2019 up-and-over-the-transom apology, Mirotic was asked if Portis knew that. It led to more up-and-over communication. \u201cI guess he will know now,\u201d the 6-foot-10 native of Montenegro said. The continuing need for media middlemen quickly got this Mirotic-Portis detente portrayed as tenuous or, as one outlet termed it, \u201cprecarious.\u201d Which, while true, shouldn\u2019t matter. No one\u2019s asking these two Bulls bigs to be Butch & Sundance, just so long as they\u2019re not Mayweather-McGregor. Until the two had tangled \u2013 with Portis delivering the headline-maker but Mirotic reportedly instigating the altercation with verbiage and body language \u2013 Chicago had hoped to operate a nice, unobtrusive, below-the-radar tank job as the cornerstone of their avowed rebuilding plan. The skirmish and the severity of Mirotic\u2019s injuries flushed the Bulls and their intentionally uncompetitive intentions into the bright lights. Reporters had to monitor each increment of his recovery, physically but more so emotionally, and count the games until Portis\u2019 return. Now it\u2019s all about a team\u2019s ability to harbor players who don\u2019t get along. \u201cThat\u2019s something a lot of people have encountered in the league,\u201d Chicago Bulls center Robin Lopez told reporters Monday as Mirotic prepped for his first full practice since the smackdown. Asked for a personal example of teammate dislike, the Bulls\u2019 big man was ready. \u201cBrook Lopez,\u201d he said, mentioning his twin brother, currently in the employ of the Los Angeles Lakers. A little sibling-like rivalry might do the 3-16 Bulls some good as Mirotic\u2019s return to game action next week or soon thereafter approaches. He averaged 10.8 points and made 35 percent of his 3-point shots in his first three seasons in Chicago. Coach Fred Hoiberg talked Wednesday of Mirotic\u2019s value in spacing the floor and, contrary to his reputation primarily as an offensive player, said he ranked second on the squad last season to Jimmy Butler in defensive efficiency. \u201cNiko is a guy who has a lot of experience,\u201d Hoiberg said, \u201cnot only in this league but he\u2019s been playing professional going back all the way to when he was 16 years old, when he started playing in the Spanish league. \u201cHe\u2019s been in really good spirits. He\u2019s been good with the guys. Then it\u2019s about getting in the best shape possible, getting ready to play.\u201d Said Mirotic: \u201cI just know that right now the only goal \u2014 Bulls\u2019 goal and my goal \u2014 is to make me get back with the team and practice together and get my strength back and as soon as I can, play with the team.\u201d There is a question of minutes. Mirotic\u2019s layoff and Portis\u2019 suspension cleared the way for rookie Lauri Markkanen to start at power forward. Markkanen, averaging 14.3 points and 8.2 rebounds while shooting 34.3 percent from the arc, will continue in that role. Mirotic set a ground rule before taking any questions, saying he would not talk about the incident itself. He shrugged off the report soon after in one Chicago newspaper that claimed he and his representatives gave the Bulls management an ultimatum that he or Portis be traded. By league rules, in the wake of his summer re-upping with the Bulls as a restricted free agent, Mirotic cannot be traded until Jan. 15. So, either the team trades Portis or the onus is on Hoiberg and the coaches to make this work. Finding playing time for five big men \u2013 Mirotic, Portis, Markkanen, Lopez and reserve center Cristiano Felicio \u2013 won\u2019t be easy. But it will go more smoothly if Mirotic and Portis manage to peacefully co-exist. Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

In a video posted on Uninterrupted, the Cleveland Cavaliers\u2019 star provided a tongue-in-cheek response to his ejection last night vs. the Miami Heat . The majority of the video, though, was James praising his new Cavaliers teammates for their resiliency and teamwork as Cleveland has amassed a nine-game win streak. \u201cI think the reason that we won last night is because I\u2019ve been a huge distraction to the team and that\u2019s why me getting ejected was best for the team. I got ejected and we still was able to win a game,\u201d James said with a smile. \u201cBut in all seriousness, I think that we\u2019re just playing really good ball right now.\u201d The Cavs added seven new players in the offseason as the team underwent a roster overhaul. Early on, Cleveland struggled to find cohesion and got off to a 3-5 start. However, the defense has tightened up of late and James can see teamwork and trust going among the Cavs now. \u201cThe rotations are unbelievable that the coaches are making, the gameplan they\u2019re giving us is unbelievable,\u201d James said. \u201cThe players are just getting more and more comfortable with each other. Adding seven new guys to a new team is difficult and early on, we saw that. We didn\u2019t know each other both on the floor or off the floor. The trust wasn\u2019t there but I think we\u2019ve just been getting better and better and better with every road trip, every game.\u201d In particular, James went out of his way to praise the Cavs\u2019 bench crew \u2014 from Dwyane Wade to little-used guard Jose Calderon. \u201cWe\u2019ve been really consistent defensively with our gameplan, we\u2019ve been sharing the ball offensively. Our bench has been unbelieveable \u2014 D-Wade, Channing [Frye], Kyle [Korver], Jeff Green, Jae [Crowder], Shump [Iman Shumpert] \u2014 everybody who\u2019s come off the bench has given us a huge spark.

Now, Mirotic is hoping to move on from the incident and find his way back into the mix for the Bulls as the season marches on. Mirotic on Wednesday addressed the media for the first time since the incident and said he wants to keep what happened with Portis on that Oct. 17 post-practice scuffle in the past. Four days after the fight, Portis offered up an apology to Mirotic , which Mirotic said he has accepted. As to whether or not Portis knows that, Mirotic said \u201cI guess he will know now.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m very happy to be back with the team.

He and injured guard Zach LaVine are expected to practice this week with Chicago\u2019s G League affiliate, the Windy City Bulls , to continue their rehab work. While Mirotic was on the mend, talk of his representatives issuing a trade request of sorts to Chicago\u2019s front office bubbled up . That was something Mirotic would neither confirm nor deny today as he reiterated that he is simply glad to be back with the team. \u201cI was watching all of the games from home and asking myself how I can help the team when I come back,\u201d Mirotic said. Overall, Mirotic wanted it to be clear that his goal is to support the team as well as his teammate Portis. \u201cI\u2019ve been playing this game nine years professionally. I was always a good teammate, always professional with everybody. I\u2019m going to continue to do that. If I\u2019m here, it\u2019s because I want to support the team. He\u2019s a part of the team.

He was waived on July 4 , weeks after he and the team came to a final agreement on how to part ways and more than a year since his last NBA appearance because of blood-clot issues. His departure gave the Heat access to $26.8 million in salary-cap space for next season. Bosh, who is expected to have his No. 1 retired by the Heat at some point, was on NBA TV\u2019s Players Only last night and made it clear he wants to stay around the game in some form. \u201cI\u2019m always going to be around the game of basketball,\u201d Bosh said. \u201cI plan to keep my options open as a player moving forward, but that\u2019s not coaching. Maybe front office work, working with teams and spreading the game, maybe teaching the game to young people, that\u2019s something that\u2019s a very big passion.\u201d Bosh has a desire to pass along how to play without the ball and would ideally like to work with players who may not be the top option on their team. \u201cI would want to work with guys that maybe aren\u2019t starters, guys that are the fourth or fifth option,\u201d Bosh said. \u201cTo be honest, I\u2019m looking at today\u2019s game and I put myself in that position and how I would benefit from the faster basketball, more threes, catch-and-go opportunities, attacking the paint with more space, that\u2019s what kind of gets me juiced up and riled up when I watch today\u2019s game. I would really want to teach someone how to function without having to have plays called for you.\u201d Back in 2014, Bosh signed a five-year deal to stay with the Heat \u2014 shortly after LeBron James left Miami for a return to Cleveland. James, Bosh and Dwyane Wade went to the NBA Finals in all four of their seasons together in Miami, winning titles in 2012 and 2013. Bosh\u2019s last Miami deal was worth $118 million. For that, he was only able to play in 97 games. He appeared in 44 games in 2014-15, his season ending at the All-Star break when the first known clot episode started. A year later, he played in 53 games and \u2013 in an eerie similarity \u2013 his season again ended at All-Star weekend, when another clot was found shortly after he landed in Toronto for the 2016 All-Star Game. Bosh hasn\u2019t played since, missing Miami\u2019s last 125 games. Overall, he played 13 NBA seasons, seven with Toronto and then six with Miami. He was part of Miami\u2019s massive free-agent haul in 2010, where the Heat not only kept Wade but landed James to form something that team president Pat Riley felt could turn into something dynastic. He averaged 19.2 points and 8.5 rebounds in his career.

Bickerstaff, what\u2019s the first thing you would do to get the Memphis Grizzlies back on track this season?  * * * Steve Aschburner : We\u2019ll assume that firing the owner is above Bickerstaff\u2019s pay grade. And J.B. doesn\u2019t even play a doctor on TV, so there\u2019s not much he can do about Mike Conley\u2019s health or Chandler Parsons\u2019 fragility. He can try to be the anti-David Fizdale to ingratiate himself at least with Marc Gasol, but that bears risks, too \u2014 you don\u2019t want to pull a 180 from a coach as well-regarded as Memphis\u2019 former bench boss is. So maybe Bickerstaff should just pin down the Grizzlies\u2019 front office to accurately define what \u201con track this season\u201d actually means. I don\u2019t recall picking Memphis to even qualify for the postseason, given the departures from last season. A new track altogether \u2013 trading Gasol, joining the ever-popular race to the bottom in search of lottery balls \u2013 might be the Grizzlies\u2019 best bet. Bickerstaff can thus join some of the league\u2019s other loyal soldiers like Brett Brown, Luke Walton and Fred Hoiberg in putting the organization\u2019s long-term vision ahead of his personal W-L record. Not that he might have much choice, from the looks of things. Shaun Powell :  First thing: Squash any and all temptation to bench Marc Gasol.  Once that\u2019s done, he must follow his instincts about putting the right lineup on the floor even if that means benching anyone besides Gasol. The Grizzlies lack an identity and they\u2019re still searching for steady point guard play with Mike Conley hurting. Shuffle the lineup and find the right combination and perhaps more emphasis on Tyreke Evans and Dillon Brooks. John Schuhmann : I would have a sit-down with Marc Gasol, and not just because it\u2019s apparent that Gasol\u2019s relationship with David Fizdale had something to do with the coach getting fired. Gasol just hasn\u2019t been as good as he was last season and the Grizz have been at their best ( plus-8.1 points per 100 possessions ) with him off the floor, a data point that Fizdale was probably aware of when Gasol sat the entire fourth quarter on Sunday. There are other issues (like Mike Conley\u2019s health and the lack of shooting), but those are mostly out of the coach\u2019s control at this point. Sekou Smith :  Pray to the NBA health higher powers to heal Mike Conley, sooner rather than later. I know Marc Gasol\u2019s numbers suggest otherwise, but Conley is the guy that makes the Grizzlies go. When he\u2019s at his best (and due to injuries that hasn\u2019t been nearly often enough), they go to another level. So getting Conley back in the lineup and keeping him there is the best path out of this current mess. There is no magic button for Bickerstaff or anyone else to push to fix what\u2019s ailing this team. There needs to be a sober examination of what this roster is capable of and perhaps then everyone in Memphis will get on the same page. In the meantime, a healthy starting point guard would be enough."},{"id":48408,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-comparing-2017-18-rookies-nba-stars-today","date":"2017-11-29","title":"Blogtable: What superstar's game do you see glimpses of in a rookie?","content":" * * * Ben Simmons has drawn some LeBron James comparisons. What superstar\u2019s game do you see glimpses of in a rookie this season?  * * * Steve Aschburner : My first instinct was to compare Chicago\u2019s Lauri Markkanen to the Knicks\u2019 Kristaps Porzingis  for their length, their international backgrounds and their 3-point proficiency. But then I wondered if Porzingis qualified as a superstar and recalled an unfortunate moment 25 years ago when Christian Laettner chided a reporter (not me!) who asked him about similarities to Larry Bird. Laettner thought the comment was Caucasian-driven and said, \u201cThat\u2019s pathetic.\u201d So let\u2019s go with Dallas\u2019 Dennis Smith Jr. and 2011 Kia MVP Derrick Rose  for their shared athleticism and abandon in attacking the rim. Neither had\/has much shooting range as rookies, both were given heavy responsibility with rebuilding teams, both come from strong family backgrounds, and so on. Presumably Smith will stay healthier because, well, who doesn\u2019t? Shaun Powell :  I\u2019m not getting into comparisons between a rookie and a once-in-a-generation player just yet. Seems a tad pit premature. However, what Simmons does have in common with LeBron and other greats is his composure. Let\u2019s start there. Simmons feels like he belongs and it shows in his movement, his gait, his lack of sweat during crunch time and his confidence. He carries himself like a guy who wants the responsibility and the burden, even if he\u2019s having a sub-par game. That\u2019s what you want, and need, from a franchise player. John Schuhmann :  There are lots of comparisons to be made. Jayson Tatum and Kyle Kuzma both have elements of Paul Pierce\u2019s game, not explosive, but a variety of offensive skills. Dennis Smith Jr. has hints of Russell Westbrook with his explosiveness at the rim, while De\u2019Aaron Fox could be a lefty John Wall with his end-to-end speed. John Collins has the bounciness and finishing ability of a DeAndre Jordan or Dwight Howard, while Jarrett Allen could be a Rudy Gobert-esque rim protector. It\u2019s been a fun rookie class to watch. Sekou Smith : Haven\u2019t we learned our lesson with these comparisons after all the Lonzo Ball-Jason Kidd talk? It\u2019s not fair to try and put Simmons in the LeBron James box out of the gate. I have been trying to come up with a player comparison for Lakers rookie Kyle Kuzma, who has shown me something since summer league. I\u2019ve seen glimpses of a young Carmelo Anthony in Kuzma\u2019s game (you asked for glimpses, right?). He\u2019s got the confidence I love to see in a rookie and he\u2019s certainly outplaying his draft position early on here. After all my bellyaching about unfair comparisons for rookies, I\u2019ve just done my part to keep it going. But \u2014 my apologies to \u2018Melo and Kuzma.

Really, it would have been more surprising to me if they had clicked early and naturally, given how ball dominant Russell Westbrook, Paul George and Carmelo Anthony had been in their careers prior to joining forces. This is the 2007-08 Boston Celtics, where Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen slipped easily into defined roles by virtues of somewhat different skill sets and inclinations. It was inevitable, I thought, that \u201cthe OK3\u201d would have to sort out redundancies, turn-taking and concerns about stepping on each other\u2019s toes. Anthony needs to spend more time in the post, in my opinion. I thought George was lingering too often on the perimeter. It\u2019s a lot to sort out and finding some rhythm by the season\u2019s midpoint would be a success, in my view. Shaun Powell :  It\u2019s simple: The answer is \u201ctime.\u201d This is uniting three scorers who are accustomed to getting shots and being the focal point late in games and OKC simply needs time so Russell Westbrook, Carmelo Anthony and Paul George can find a shared comfort zone. No need to sound any alarms now; check back if things are still slippery come January. John Schuhmann : The Thunder offense has very little flow.  No team has isolated more often and the isolations haven\u2019t resulted in attacks of the basket often enough. They rank 27th in drives and first in pull-up, 2-point jump shots (the worst shots on the floor) per game. The lack of ball movement (the Thunder rank 29th in passes per possession) has been compounded by a lack of player movement (they rank 26th in distance traveled per minute of possession), so instead of off-ball screens and cuts, there\u2019s a lot of standing around, which makes them easier to defend than they should be, given the talent of their four best players. If they moved and passed more, their scorers would have more opportunities to work against a rotating defense, which would result in better shots. Instead, the result is a team that ranks 22nd offensively , with their numbers with all three All-Stars on the floor ( 103.7 points scored per 100 possessions ) still below the league average (104.4). With that kind of talent, that all-three-on-the-floor number should be much higher, but these guys simply haven\u2019t brought out the best in each other.  Sekou Smith : I don\u2019t know that 19 games is enough time to figure out how to get around a new city (for Carmelo Anthony and Paul George), let alone figure out your chemistry if you\u2019re \u201cthe OK3\u201d. We need to take a step back and let this thing marinate a little bit more before making any lasting declarations about this crew. They don\u2019t look disjointed to me at all. I think they fit as a group. They just need more time to get their timing down and to figure out who has to sacrifice what for the greater good. It\u2019ll come.

But after a loss to the Houston Rockets that dropped their record to 5-7 on Nov. 9, the Cavaliers were on pace to have one of the worst defenses ever  at 113.1 points allowed per 100 possessions . Cavs coach Tyronn Lue\u2019s optimism notwithstanding \u2014 \u201cIf we play like that,\u201d he said after the 117-113 loss , \u201cwe\u2019ll be a lot better\u201d \u2014 the alarm bells were ringing as loud as ever at that point, especially with the rival Boston Celtics rolling through what would be a 16-game winning streak that lifted them to the top of the Eastern Conference. They remain there through Tuesday\u2019s action, 3 1\/2 games up on both the Detroit Pistons and the Cavaliers. But with nine straight wins, the Cavs have not only turned their season around, they\u2019ve done so by addressing their biggest weakness. The Cavaliers have been positively ferocious on defense during their surge, limiting opponents to just 100.5 points per 100 possessions \u2014 good for fourth in the league over that span. They\u2019ve seen their biggest improvement at the 3-point line, where opponents are making 4.2 fewer shots and shooting roughly 10 percentage points worse than they did in the first 12 games. Part of that can be attributed to their schedule, with only two of nine opponents ranked in the top 10 in offense and five of nine sitting below .500. But after a horrendous start in which they were shredded for 112 points or more in each of the 10 games preceding their streak, the Cavaliers will gladly take success however they can get it. As chronicled by Cleveland.com\u2019s Chris Fedor, the Cavs have done so in large part by \u201cblitzing,\u201d i.e. switching everything on the perimeter 1 through 4, and aggressively trapping ball handlers when the opportunity presents. It\u2019s a risky style that the Cavaliers haven\u2019t always had success with. Indeed, it was a focal point in training camp, and still a large part of their tactics during their poor start. The difference now? An easier schedule, improved chemistry through familiarity and \u2014 with Tristan Thompson injured \u2014 full commitment to the smaller lineups (often with Kevin Love at center) that thrive at pressuring opponents. That\u2019s exactly what the Cavaliers did last Friday to Charlotte Hornets All-Star Kemba Walker, holding him to 6-for-21 shooting \u2014 including 2-for-11 on 3s \u2014 in their 100-99 victory . It was a rare instance where they were able to clamp down on their foe instead of overpowering them with their high-octane offense. Make no mistake: With James, the ageless wonder, playing pretty much as well as ever in his 15th season, and a dearth of individual stoppers, the Cavaliers will always be an offensive-minded team. But the past three weeks have at least restored hope that they can defend well enough to hold off the surprising Pistons and hard-charging Celtics and maintain their supremacy in the East. \u201cWe knew something had to change,\u201d Love told Cleveland.com after the triumph over Charlotte . \u201cWe\u2019re still not where we need to be, and you can see that.

(AP) \u2014 Grizzlies general manager Chris Wallace says the overall product is why Memphis fired coach David Fizdale, not the decision to bench star center Marc Gasol for an entire quarter of the team\u2019s eighth straight loss. Wallace also defended Gasol against criticism saying the center is a \u201ccoach killer.\u201d * Gasol says he didn\u2019t ask for Fizdale to be fired \u201cThere were bigger trends than just the relationship between the two of them,\u201d Wallace said Tuesday. \u201cIt just hasn\u2019t been going well for us after a good start. And there was no indication that it was going to change magically any time soon.\u201d The Grizzlies unexpectedly fired Fizdale on Monday , the coach hired away from his assistant\u2019s job with the Miami Heat with great fanfare in May 2016. But the Grizzlies are mired in their longest skid since 2009 and 7-12 overall after starting the season 5-1. The timing of the firing raised questions about Gasol\u2019s role coming a day after the center was benched during the fourth quarter Sunday of a 98-88 loss to the Brooklyn Nets. The 7-foot center is the team\u2019s leader in scoring, assists and rebounding, and Gasol expressed confusion and anger over the late-game benching. But the Grizzlies are 14-26 since March 1 of last season, and questions swirled over Memphis\u2019 desire and level of play. Memphis has suffered through injuries, most notably point guard Mike Conley missing the last seven games with a sore left Achilles. Free agent signee Ben McLemore is just getting back into the rotation after missing the first 11 games rehabbing an injury. Starting forward JaMychal Green has returned after spraining his ankle in the opening game of the season. Still, the Grizzlies seemed to regress more than expected for a franchise that has reached the postseason each of the past seven seasons. The losing skid has featured poor performances in a quarter or two of games. \u201cUnfortunately, we are underperforming, (by) even the lowest of preseason expectations\u201d Wallace said. \u201cWe are an organization of high expectations for our team, so a change had to be made.\u201d Now Bickerstaff is taking over as interim head coach, and Wallace said Bickerstaff would hold the job the rest of the season. Bickerstaff, who had been the Grizzlies associate coach, takes over hoping to reverse their struggles. Bickerstaff experienced a similar situation when he took over as interim coach of the Houston Rockets after Kevin McHale was fired shortly after the start of the 2015-16 season. He went 37-34 with the Rockets. This promotion is much tougher personally for Bickerstaff. He and Fizdale are close friends. Bickerstaff said he has known Fizdale since he was 17. Fizdale was in Bickerstaff\u2019s wedding, and the interim coach came to Memphis to help Fizdale succeed. Bickerstaff called Monday a very difficult day personally because of that relationship, but now he has work to do. \u201cThrough the emotions, you have to come up with a plan and hopefully that plan rights the ship a little bit,\u201d Bickerstaff said."},{"id":42976,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/chicago-bulls-nikola-mirotic-zach-lavine-practice-g-league-team","date":"2017-11-28","title":"Zach LaVine, Nikola Mirotic to practice with G League affiliate","content":"Chicago Bulls forward Nikola Mirotic and guard Zach LaVine are each working their way back from injury.

Griffin immediately collapsed to the floor and held the injured leg, which forced him to exit the game with just under four minutes remaining. It is the same leg on which Griffin underwent surgery for a broken left kneecap that held him out the 2009-10 season . The five-time All-Star was averaging 23.4 points, 7.7 rebounds and 5.0 assists per contest entering Monday night\u2019s contest, which the Clippers won 120-115. The team is already struggling with injuries to Danilo Gallinari (glute) and Patrick Beverley (knee), though they have now won three games in a row following a nine-game skid.  * Rivers: Griffin\u2019s injury \u2018didn\u2019t look good\u2019 Griffin has dealt with injuries during his eight NBA seasons and over the past three seasons, he has played in 67, 35 and 61 games, respectively. He missed the Clippers\u2019 first-round playoff series vs. the Utah Jazz when he hurt the plantar of his right big toe in Game 3 of that series .

At 20 games, much of what an NBA team is \u2014 and much of what it will become \u2014 is mostly well-established. Fourteen, 16, even 18 games into an 82-game schedule, it might be easy to understate and\/or overstate a season. That round number of 20, though \u2014 the closest a team can get in whole games to 25 percent of the regular season (24.39, actually) \u2014 resonates. As our man John Schuhmann notes annually in his Power Rankings , what qualifies as one-fourth of the season carries a certain heft, in terms of who\u2019s good, who\u2019s not and who\u2019s headed where over the remaining 60-62 games. The teams that are likely to be in the playoffs largely are known by now \u2014 14 of the 16 qualifiers in 2016-17 were above the lottery cutoff by Dec. 5, last season\u2019s quarter mark \u2014 as are those that are racing toward the bottom or merely churning about. Twenty games is no joke, in other words, which is why numerous NBA teams do some serious evaluating at this point each season. Those at or near the top (and those committed to the cellar) may not make course-altering decisions. The teams in the yawning middle might be particularly engaged right about now \u2014 all 30 teams will have played at least 20 games by Friday morning \u2014 in either fishing or cutting bait. The Miami Heat, at 10-9, will hit 20 at Cleveland tonight. They\u2019re especially known for the so-called Rule of 20 owing to team president Pat Riley\u2019s ways dating back to his New York and Los Angeles days. The thinking is, 82 games is too vast and ill-defined, splayed across six months or so, to allow for clear, concise judgments along the way. By the time you get a feel for where your team is headed, you\u2019ve either already gotten there or been sidetracked. At 20 games \u2014 and then again at 40 and 60 \u2014 there\u2019s an opportunity to correct one\u2019s course or adjust one\u2019s objectives. Lock into a starting lineup, pursue a trade, fire a coach, opt for Plan B or hitch up the shorts for a stretch drive, it\u2019s only doable if the right markers are heeded. Some coaches will talk about \u201ccontinuous improvement\u201d as their overriding mission, but there are so many tiny variables from one game to the next: travel, schedule quirks, minor ailments. Better to go with a block of games. And to know when you can\u2019t.  \u201cYou have a pretty good idea of your general feel and context of your team,\u201d Miami coach Erik Spoelstra said. \u201cBut that\u2019s not always in cement. Just look at us last year. We didn\u2019t really understand where we were. But you have an idea of what direction, usually, that your team is going in.\u201d The Heat in 2016-17 had one of the most unusual seasons in league annals, going 11-30 after a Jan. 13 loss to the Milwaukee Bucks and then 30-11 in to finish the season . They were 7-13 after 20 games, then wound up barely missing a playoff berth on the season\u2019s final night. This time around, the Heat seem to be a blend of last season\u2019s good and bad, and their mediocre mark shows it. Spoelstra has rolled back a lot of the work between games to fundamentals and essentials, with the focus on building good habits. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a ways to go,\u201d he said. \u2018We\u2019re building habits. We\u2019re building better behavior, all the little things that lead to winning, so hopefully we\u2019ll be a much different team every 20-game block from here on out.\u201d (Some even think 20 games is too many, too diffused and vague for the short attention spans players almost necessarily have to have when uploading mass quantities of opponent research for a homestand\u2019s worth of foes. Hall of Fame coach Hubie Brown preferred to mentally break the season into eight-game chunks. Go 5-3 in enough of those, you\u2019re almost assured of being a playoff team.) Twenty games in is a fragile time for coaches, as far as job security, as the Memphis Grizzlies\u2019 David Fizdale found out Monday . At 7-12, he and the Grizzlies had been given enough rope that management obviously felt a determination could be made. Memphis\u2019 quick start, winning five of its first six, didn\u2019t resonate nearly as much as its eight consecutive losses did. Not every franchise hits 20, 40 or 60 games on the nose before doing something dramatic. Phoenix Suns GM Ryan McDonough felt he needed to see only three games to fire coach Earl Watson . In 2015-16, the Houston Rockets pulled the plug on Kevin McHale after 11 games . But the last time Miami made a coaching change in season, Riley sent home Stan Van Gundy at 11-10 in 2005-06 and took over for the final 61 games. The Cleveland Cavaliers fired David Blatt 41 games into the 2015-16 season . And the last time each of these organizations \u2014 Washington, Toronto, San Antonio, Minnesota, Golden State, Philadelphia, Sacramento and Chicago \u2014 made coaching changes during the season, they did so after 17, 17, 18, 19, 23, 23, 24 and 25 games respectively. What have we learned about the league this season, with 20 games coming sooner than usual? * Boston\u2019s acquisition of Kyrie Irving , its young starting forwards and a more tenacious defense than expected have more than made up for Gordon Hayward\u2019s loss. * The day Philadelphia coach Brett Brown longed for finally has arrived. * Detroit, Indiana and New York might manage to overachieve their way into lower-seed possibilities. Washington\u2019s window is closing before its eyes, and Milwaukee has flaws at both ends that won\u2019t be solved if and when Jabari Parker returns. * Houston\u2019s James Harden might snag the Kia MVP trophy many thought he deserved last spring. * Minnesota, Denver and Portland are for real in the West, while it\u2019s getting late early in Oklahoma City. Carmelo Anthony was supposed to have left his sub-.500 records back with the Knicks. * The next man Memphis owner Robert Pera offers a full-time coaching position is going to speed-dial Lionel Hollins, Dave Joerger and Fizdale in some order. * A strong field of Kia Rookie of the Year candidates at least six deep from the Draft class of 2017 all might wind up slotting in behind the Sixers\u2019 Ben Simmons. * The drama of the draft lottery might be greater than that of the playoffs decided several weeks later. * LeBron James still moves the Earth and the league when he firmly puts his foot down. Then there\u2019s the best thing about the NBA season at 20 games: That means 62 more to go. Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

After the game concluded around 10 p.m., McCutchen returned to his hotel to file his game report. Once that was done around 1:30 a.m., he finally went to sleep before there was the 4 a.m. wake-up call Saturday to catch a 6 a.m. flight back to Ashville, N.C., to enjoy two days off with his family before hitting the road once again. But before he flies out to Orlando on Tuesday morning, he has one more stop to make. His Dodge truck is loaded with all of his gear and he\u2019s ready to hit the road for an 80-minute drive to a place he came across months ago and had earmarked as a place he wanted to photograph when the opportunity presented itself. That opening came on Monday, smack dab in the middle of refereeing games in Los Angeles and Orlando early in the 2017-18 NBA season \u2014 his 25th as an NBA referee. McCutchen isn\u2019t looking to take a quick photo with his cell phone to post on Instagram. He\u2019s not using a DSLR that many recreational photographers use to capture high quality digital images. He\u2019s not even using the type of high-end cameras he sees along the baseline of every NBA game he officiates. \u201cI\u2019ve chosen a different path in my photography,\u201d he said in an interview with NBA.com right before heading out to his destination. \u201cInstead of digital, I\u2019ve chosen new cameras but they are old in their soul.\u201d McCutchen is using a view camera that weighs 60 pounds and shoots images up to 20-by-24 inches in size. While he\u2019s choosing to use film today, McCutchen is also experienced in wet plate collodion photography, which he describes as \u201chow Abraham Lincoln would have had his picture taken \u2026 for lack of a better description it would probably be a 15 to 20 minute Polaroid.\u201d  On this day, McCutchen is shooting with film in the hope of printing out the image in platinum and palladium, which are hand-applied salts used to develop the picture from the negative rather than using standard silver. While many photographers use digital cameras to create digital negatives to print in platinum and palladium, McCutchen is choosing to go the old school route by using film instead of digital. There is risk involved with this choice. There is a much larger margin for error when shooting digital; if the photographer isn\u2019t pleased with the image, they can simply shoot as many shots as they want until they capture the image they are looking for. Shooting in film is akin to a theater performer speaking in front of a live audience. If they forget their line, everybody sees it. \u201cWhen you use big cameras, I have four sheets of film loaded today; I\u2019m going to drive an hour and 20 minutes to take four shots,\u201d McCutchen said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be very purposeful and I like the lack of speed, the slowness of that. \u201cThe decisions that go into what to include and what not to include in the frame; those are things that are peculiar to me in terms of the satisfaction that you get from that is very personal. I sell very few of my photographs, I don\u2019t pursue sales very much. The process, I think, is just as important as the product.\u201d He also sees a clear connection between his skills as an NBA referee and his skills as a photographer.  \u201cOne of the reasons I think photography appeals to me so is that as a referee you are trying to capture moments and interpret them correctly based on a solid base of innate knowledge of the rules, up against the league\u2019s and competition committee\u2019s desire for the enforcement of those rules, and you\u2019re trying to capture those moments in meaningful ways that represent that rule book, that environment that officiating is supposed to create so the talent [of the players] can be exposed,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd capturing those individual moments through the process of seeing plays correctly is very analogous to capturing moments as a photographer and I like that connection, I really do.\u201d McCutchen\u2019s love of photography \u2014 which dates back to 2003 when he took his first lessons in both the collodion and the platinum and palladium techniques \u2014 helps provide a balance in his life compared to the fast-paced world of the NBA. \u201cThat\u2019s more than fair to say, that hits it exactly on the nail,\u201d he said. \u201cThe pressure and the scrutiny that NBA referees are under are warranted. Our decisions impact other people\u2019s lives \u2026 we understand that our jobs and our skill level at our jobs impacts other people. And there\u2019s a real responsibility knowing that your work impacts other people\u2019s work and there\u2019s a sense of wanting to honor that. \u201cWith that scrutiny and with the pressure that comes with that responsibility, there\u2019s a need to separate from that and to understand that there are other things in a life that are important \u2013 family being of course the most important in all of our lives. And how we assign the time of our lives to those balances is very important.\u201d McCutchen is married and has two children \u2014 a 17-year-old daughter (who is a rock climber) and a 15-year-old son (who runs cross country and plays basketball). His children have always played a pivotal role in his off the court activities, beginning even before his daughter was born. When his wife was pregnant with their first child, McCutchen joined his wife and mother-in-law in a quilt store where \u2014 in his estimation \u2014 they were taking far too long to come to a decision on which fabrics to choose for a joint project they were working on. \u201cI was mumbling and grumbling like most impatient people and my wife more or less threw down the gauntlet that I should shut up and pick out some fabrics and do a quilt for myself,\u201d he recalled with a laugh. \u201cShe said it more as a taunt and I said, \u2018Well then maybe I will just do that.\u2019 And that turned into a contest between her and I about who could make queen sized quilt for our daughter.\u201d After three years, both had finished a quilt for their daughter and the debates over who won the contest became part of the McCutchen family folklore. After hearing these stories over the years and seeing his older sister with two quilts while he had none, McCutchen\u2019s son started asking for a quilt of his own. McCutchen agreed to do it, but took on a much more ambitious quilt than he did for his daughter.  \u201cI knew I didn\u2019t have much talent as a quilter but I figured tedium was a talent, so I picked the smallest little squares I could come up with so that if I put in enough time there might be some payoff at the end of the rainbow. And that\u2019s exactly how it turned out,\u201d he said. The quilt features 10,816 one-inch squares and took eight years to complete. He took the quilt with him on NBA road trips and worked on it on airplanes and in hotel rooms. He also got teased by his fellow referees asking when he was going to retire because he was already making quilts. \u201cTo do that for your son, there\u2019s something oddly satisfying in terms of doing something that surprises even yourself at my age,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m 51 and to take on something that takes eight years to do and to stick with it enough, the wax and the wane of it all. I\u2019d get tired of it and put it down for a month and it would lurk over there in the corner calling me out because I hadn\u2019t finished it.\u201d Taking on new tasks is something McCutchen has done throughout his adult life to continue to challenge himself, to continue to learn and continue to achieve the balance that comes between home life and work life. \u201cI see it as taking on challenges that excite the soul for lack of a better term,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve taken on three things in my life outside of the refereeing. One of them is the quilt. One of them has been photography and I\u2019m trying to learn trumpet. \u201cMusic is something that I don\u2019t have a talent for; I\u2019m not very rhythmic, I most certainly can\u2019t sing, but I wanted music in the last chapter of my life. I wanted to be able to, at family gatherings, play an instrument. And to be able to enjoy the pursuit of that is singular in the sense that even though I\u2019m not very good at it, every day when I practice that trumpet, I really enjoy that hour.\u201d  The desire to constantly learn new things is something McCutchen has done throughout his life. He earned a degree in English Literature and Speech Communication from the University of Texas at Arlington, but shortly after graduating headed to Los Angeles to pursue refereeing. He then took on quilting as a dare, then photography as a hobby and has now introduced the trumpet to his arsenal of talents. It is a lesson that he imparts on his children as well as they get ready to reach adulthood and begin to pursue their own life adventures. \u201cOne of the things I try to articulate to my children is that it doesn\u2019t matter where you go to high school, where you go to college, the point is are you going to quit learning when you get done with your school or are you going to continue to grow?\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe there\u2019s some formal ways, through extension classes and what not that we grow, but most of that is self driven if we\u2019re doing it right. And I personally hope I don\u2019t stop doing those things that allow me grow. That\u2019s the best part of life.\u201d With so many varied interests outside of the game, McCutchen has a vision for his future when it is time for life after basketball. He says that most referees retire around 60 and he plans to do the same so he can move on to the next chapter in his life. \u201cIn terms of envisioning a future, I clearly have a vision for that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I have no desire to sit around as a 60-year-old man and talk about the glory days. That just has zero appeal to me. \u201cI really enjoy working with the people in the NBA. I think we have phenomenal men \u2014 and women \u2014 leading our team as coaches and assistant coaches. I really believe that. We have phenomenal people in those positions and we have phenomenal people, human beings as our players. I truly believe that. I enjoy working with them, but that doesn\u2019t mean I want to sit around having my identity based on having worked with them later in life. And it\u2019s something I\u2019ll continually remain proud of, that I worked with good people all this time.\u201d The life-after-basketball chapter of the McCutchen story goes back to the destination he was heading to on Monday to take those four photographs. He came across the place accidentally while he was driving to pick up some items for an 18-acre property his family now owns in Ashville. After using the past few years to clean up the property after it had been vacant for decades, the McCutchen family plans to open a small farm this coming spring following the NBA season. \u201cMy son and I have been jonesing for a little herd of milk goats \u2014 8 or 10 milk goats,\u201d he said. \u201cIn retirement I\u2019ll definitely run this little farm and have a lot of joy taking on a new challenge of making goat cheese and interesting stuff like that; run me a little herd of chickens that will wreak havoc over all of our lives.\u201d McCutchen cites an article he recently read by Atul Gawande, a doctor and author out of Boston, when discussing his idea of retirement. \u201cHe wrote an article where he\u2019s asking his patients and his friends what does a good day look like. And for me in retirement, a good day looks like messing with my animals in the morning while my wife is blowing glass [in her studio], we come in for lunch and share lunch together; I do some photography in the afternoon; I break the trumpet out and play a little music at night. That\u2019s a good envisioned future for my retirement, simple though it may be for me.\u201d But retirement is still a decade away for McCutchen. The veteran official entered his 25th NBA season having officiated 1,408 regular-season games, 169 playoff games and 16 NBA Finals games. And there are plenty more games to add to that resume. As he continues to work the sidelines in NBA arenas across the country, McCutchen will continue to strive to find the balance between his fast-paced on-court life and a slower-pace, more methodical life off the court with his various hobbies and endeavors.  \u201cFor me that time has been spent in ways to provide a balance to the work, so that when you come back to the work at hand that is important to your life \u2013 refereeing basketball \u2013 that you have a renewed spirit about it, that you have a renewed energy that says \u2018Yes this is important to get good at.\u2019 \u201cAnd for me the photography and the music and the quilting has been a good way for me to separate, recharge, have a different perspective on things, to understand that other people too have outside interests, that the game doesn\u2019t define them wholly. And when you start to understand that other people are well dimensioned, then their perspective to your work \u2013 i.e. the give-and-take of an NBA game \u2013 isn\u2019t just about what they are seeing right there. It opens up your viewpoint that they are multidimensional varied human beings just as you are. \u201cAnd that they have a perspective that you should not be shutting down just because you\u2019re in a position of authority for this moment, that you should be listening, that this is a collaborative effort that we\u2019re all trying to get to so that a game is what it should be at its best.\u201d"},{"id":48415,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/lebron-james-public-school-akron","date":"2017-11-28","title":"Board approves plan for LeBron James' 'I Promise' school in Akron","content":"AKRON, Ohio (AP) \u2014 The school board in LeBron James\u2019 Ohio hometown has approved the plan for a public school being created in partnership with the NBA star\u2019s foundation.

General manager Chris Wallace announced the move. Associate head coach J.B. Bickerstaff has been named interim head coach. \u201cAfter a thorough evaluation, I decided a change in course was necessary to move forward and provide the team and organization its best chance at success this season and beyond,\u201d Wallace said in a statement. In a statement released Tuesday morning, Fizdale said the following about his departure : \u201cI would like to thank the Memphis Grizzlies organization for allowing me the opportunity to lead this proud franchise and represent the city of Memphis. To Robert Pera, Joe Abadi, Chris Wallace, Ed Stefanski, John Hollinger and all the players, coaches, administration and support staff \u2013 I appreciate your belief in me. It was a great honor and experience to serve as your Head Coach and be part of the Memphis community. The city of Memphis is a special place and embodies a spirit that is second to none. I wish the organization and the players the best moving forward and hope they bring the fans the championship they so richly deserve. Go Grizz!\u201d Gasol, given a maximum deal by the Grizzlies in July 2015, sat throughout the fourth quarter of a 98-88 loss to the Brooklyn Nets on Sunday. Gasol leads the Grizzlies in points, rebounds and assists, and he was an All-Star in Fizdale\u2019s inaugural season. But the center spent plenty of time after the game making it clear to reporters how upset he was at sitting out a full quarter . \u201cIt\u2019s a first for me, trust me, and I don\u2019t like it one bit,\u201d Gasol said. \u201cI\u2019m more (ticked) than I can show and frustrated.\u201d When asked Tuesday if Gasol had effectively gotten Fizdale fired, Wallace told Ronald Tillery of the Commercial-Appeal : \u201cThere was tension between the two. This is a factor but its not the overriding factor. We talked to Marc in real time about the same time we talked to coach Fizdale.\u201d Fizdale explained his decision before Gasol spoke in the locker room and said he simply was trying to win a game while sticking with his reserves. Fizdale said taking a risk as head coach means sometimes upsetting a player or two. \u201cIf I\u2019m not on the floor, I\u2019m not valued,\u201d Gasol said. \u201cI\u2019m sure (the coaching staff) knew that would hurt me the most.\u201d * NBA players react to Fizdale\u2019s firing The move caught the NBA by surprise. Dwyane Wade, who played with the Miami Heat when Fizdale was an assistant coach, wrote on Twitter that he needed answers . LeBron James retweeted a comment on Twitter calling the firing so stunning that the writer triple-checked the original ESPN report to make sure he wasn\u2019t being duped by a fake account. \u201cI need some answers. Feels like my man was a fall guy,\u201d James wrote. Portland coach Terry Stotts called Fizdale\u2019s firing very disappointing. \u201cLosing in this league and not meeting expectations in this league takes its toll on everybody,\u201d Stotts said before a game in New York. \u201cOwners, general managers, coaches, players, and handling that is a strain on relationships, and it\u2019s disappointing. It\u2019s probably the most difficult part of being in the NBA, is managing that part of the season.\u201d Fizdale became the franchise\u2019s 13th head coach on May 29, 2016, and he went 50-51. The Grizzlies reached the postseason for a seventh straight time in Fizdale\u2019s first season, when they lost to the San Antonio Spurs. Fizdale was fined $30,000 by the NBA for a rant over officiating after a loss in Game 2. Memphis let Zach Randolph, Vince Carter and Tony Allen all leave as free agents and signed Ben McLemore, Tyreke Evans and Mario Chalmers to retool the roster around Gasol and point guard Mike Conley and give Fizdale a faster lineup. The moves appeared to be working when Memphis started this season an NBA-best 5-1. The Grizzlies stood atop the Western Conference with a win over the Golden State Warriors and two over Southwest Division rival Houston. But Conley has been out since Nov. 17, resting an aching left Achilles tendon . Then the team lost its eighth straight on Sunday, matching the longest skid for this franchise since Feb. 11-March 3, 2009. This will be the second time as an interim coach for Bickerstaff, who will start Wednesday night in San Antonio against the Spurs. He joined the Grizzlies in June 2016 after five seasons with the Houston Rockets, including an interim coach stint that lasted most of 2015-16. Bickerstaff went 37-34 in that role, which included a playoff berth. He also was an assistant coach with Minnesota and in Charlotte under his father, Bernie Bickerstaff.

Long ago, Taj Gibson forged his role as a hard-charging, defense-first power forward on the Chicago Bulls. Since his NBA debut in 2009-10, Gibson has kept that on-court persona in tact from the Bulls to a mid-season trade to the Oklahoma City Thunder to joining the Minnesota Timberwolves in free agency last summer. The Timberwolves\u2019 defense still leaves much to be desired ( they\u2019re 25th in Defensive Rating as of this writing ). Gibson, though, continues to bring his hard-hat mentality to the frontline and is averaging a career-best 31.8 minutes a game for Minnesota.

Others around the league are taking notice of how Wade is helping the Cavs \u2014 most recently Heat coach Erik Spoelstra (who coached Wade in Miami from 2008-16).

(AP) \u2014 Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant were sidelined with injuries for Monday night\u2019s game against Sacramento, while key backup Andre Iguodala was available to play after earlier in the day being listed as doubtful with a sore left knee. Curry has a bruised right hand while NBA Finals MVP Durant was set to miss his third straight game and fourth game in the last five because of a sprained left ankle. He played in a loss to the Thunder last Wednesday at his old Oklahoma City stomping grounds though coach Steve Kerr said afterward Durant should have sat out that one, too. \u201cKD it\u2019s just been lingering a little bit,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a huge level of concern.

Kerr doesn\u2019t want to take any chances with his stars. After hosting the Kings, defending champion Golden State goes on a six-game road trip spanning 10 days. The Warriors, with a deep rotation Kerr trusts, endured without Durant for 19 games late last season as he nursed a left knee injury. \u201cIt\u2019s great for the fans because they get to see how talented our team really is,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cObviously, some guys can be an afterthought when you\u2019ve got such talented players like Steph and Kevin always out there performing. \u2026 Everybody gets to show what they can do.

Mirotic ran through some pre-practice sets with Zach LaVine and Jerian Grant and took some \u201clight contact\u201d, too . How the Portis-Mirotic dynamic resolves itself while the two are teammates remains to be seen. Cowley reports that veteran center Robin Lopez noted that he\u2019s had teammates in the past he did not like, but simply communicated with on a basketball-only level and things worked out fine. The Bulls\u2019 next game is tomorrow night vs. the Phoenix Suns ( 8 ET, NBA League Pass ) before they travel to Denver on Thursday ( 9 ET, NBA League Pass ) to face the Nuggets. K.C.
