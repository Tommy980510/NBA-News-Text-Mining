According to Turner Sports\u2019 David Aldridge , the 28-year old forward will get $13.7 million for the deal. Young, who averaged 11.8 points and 6.4 rebounds per game last season, avoided entering the free-agent market. According to ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski, the Pacers could be big players in free agency this summer : The Pacers\u2019 future looks far brighter now than it did 12 months ago after they were swept out of the playoffs by LeBron James and the Cavaliers. Back then, there questions about Paul George\u2019s future in Indiana loomed heavily over the franchise. By late June, new general manager Kevin Pritchard was forced into a difficult choice when George\u2019s camp made his plans public: Take one more shot at winning a title with George and risk losing him in free agency or start rebuilding immediately. Pritchard opted for a widely panned trade that netted Victor Oladipo and Domantas Sabonis. It all turned out just fine for Pritchard and the Pacers. Oladipo emerged as the leader of this young group, earned his first All-Star trip, won the league\u2019s steals title and eventually figured out how to deal with constant double teams, a familiar treatment for superstars. Sabonis, a lottery pick in 2016, became a key contributor off the bench. Point guard Darren Collison was the NBA\u2019s most accurate 3-point shooter, and Young and Bojan Bogdanovic thrived in their roles, too. The key may be the continued development of Myles Turner, Indiana\u2019s 22-year-old center and one of the league\u2019s leaders in blocks. The Pacers need him to get stronger and become a better rebounder. At times this season, he showed just how dominant he could be. Now, the Pacers are asking him to stay healthy, become a more consistent scorer and help Oladipo lead this team to greater successes. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t trade this year or the men in that locker room for anyone. It\u2019s been phenomenal,\u201d Oladipo said after the season. \u201cIt\u2019s the best locker room I\u2019ve been a part of. It\u2019s been an honor playing with those men and I look forward to growing with them in the future.\u201d Information from The Associated Press was used in this report. * * * East Player Movement | West Player Movement | Free Agent Tracker"},{"id":39732,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/sixth-annual-nba-canada-series","date":"2018-06-28","title":"Toronto's DeMar DeRozan, Kyle Lowry along with Portland's Damian Lillard, CJ McCollum highlight NBA Canada series","content":"TORONTO  \u2013  The National Basketball Association (NBA) today announced that the sixth NBA Canada Series presented by Bell will feature two 2018-19 preseason games in Vancouver and Montreal. 2018 NBA All-Stars DeMar DeRozan, Kyle Lowry and the Toronto Raptors will take on three-time NBA All-Star Damian Lillard, CJ McCollum and the Portland Trail Blazers at Rogers Arena in Vancouver on Saturday, September 29.

He chose to stay in L.A. following a saga that took the league by storm. Clippers coach Doc Rivers, then-teammates Chris Paul and Blake Griffin each traveled to the center\u2019s home , staying there until he re-signed with the Clippers. Three years later, Jordan once again has a chance to end up in Texas. He is a native of the state and starred at Texas A&M before being drafted by the Clippers with the 35th pick in the 2008 Draft . The 29-year-old averaged 12.0 points and a career-high 15.2 rebounds last season. On Tuesday, the Clippers traded guard Austin Rivers to the Washington Wizards for center Marcin Gortat .

ESPN\u2019s Ramona Shelburne, Adrian Wojnarowski and Brian Windhorst reported that despite the Spurs\u2019 attempts to make peace with their disgruntled star, an overwhelming offer from the Lakers could spark a deal. Both teams also believe a Leonard trade would \u201clikely clinch\u201d a commitment from LeBron James to join the Lakers as a free agent, per ESPN. James has until Friday at 11:59 ET to decline his player option with the Cleveland Cavaliers to become an unrestricted free agent. Via Twitter, Marc Stein of The New York Times reports that league sources say the Spurs are \u201cready\u201d to move on from Leonard : It had been reported by ESPN that the Lakers were feeling pressure to quickly land Leonard in an effort to lure James, who is reportedly hesitant to join the team without another star in place. Here\u2019s more from ESPN\u2019s report: As for the discussions held Wednesday, Los Angeles Times\u2019 Tania Ganguli said a source described the call as \u201cproductive.\u201d Here\u2019s more from Ganguli on Leonard and the Lakers : Aside from the Leonard chatter, the Lakers gave young forward Julius Randle a qualifying offer yesterday , ensuring he will be a restricted free agent this summer. That move, too, could play into what happens next for the Lakers in free agency, writes Ganguli: The Boston Celtics have been reported to have an interest in Leonard, too. However, Steve Bulpett of the Boston Herald reports the likelihood of the Celtics landing Leonard seems slim at best: : Leonard played in just nine games for San Antonio in the 2017-18 campaign due to a quad injury he initially suffered in Game 1 of the 2017 Western Conference finals . The two-time Kia Defensive Player of the Year\u2019s absence was especially notable late in the season, when he went to New York to continue rehab and chose not to be with the team during its playoff run. San Antonio was defeated 4-1 in the first round of the playoffs by eventual-champion Golden State. The two-time All-Star Leonard can enter unrestricted free agency in 2019 if he does not sign a contract extension with the Spurs this summer. Leonard is due just over $20 million next season. The tension surrounding the situation between Leonard and the Spurs intensified when, after opting to not be with the team for rehab reasons, Leonard was spotted three weeks later attending a Dodgers game in Los Angeles. San Antonio is hoping to regain the usual good footing it holds with its stars in order to maintain the standard of excellence they have maintained since drafting Tim Duncan No. 1 overall in 1997. The Spurs had won at least 50 games in every season until 2017-18, when they went 47-35 and finished seventh in the Western Conference.

A lot of teams are still paying for the orgy of their spending in the summer of 2016 on players who \u2026 well, they weren\u2019t worth what they got. As a result, only a handful of teams will have significant cap room this summer, leaving a glut of available talent with not enough cap room to go around. LeBron James, Paul George and Chris Paul and other superstars that are or can be free this summer will go where they want. The other 96 percent or so of free agents won\u2019t have that kind of freedom. The other 96 percent or so, though, are the lifeblood of the NBA, players who make up the quality depth that allows a team to go seven or eight deep in its best efforts to keep up with the Golden States of the world. Proven value throughout a team\u2019s rotation is the only chance most teams will have going forward to compete; everyone \u2014 almost no one \u2014 is going to amass and then pay to maintain three true superstars. The Houston Rockets showed the way last summer by signing P.J. Tucker and Luc Mbah a Moute, creating a defensive vise with Clint Capela that allowed the Rockets to become a top-three defense with multiple switching options. It was on display in the Western Conference finals , jamming up the Warriors\u2019 weakside cuts and actions that destroy most defenses. (Of course, Houston is going to try to get James this summer, which may cost it much of that depth.)  The list below is 25 of the most intriguing free agents that will be available starting Sunday. These aren\u2019t the big-name unrestricted free agents that will have multiple suitors \u2014 think the New Orleans Pelicans\u2019 DeMarcus Cousins, the Utah Jazz\u2019s Derrick Favors, the Denver Nuggets\u2019 Will Barton or the Memphis Grizzlies\u2019 Tyreke Evans \u2014 or restricted free agents that are likely to get offer sheets, like Capela, the Milwaukee Bucks\u2019 Jabari Parker and the Los Angeles Lakers\u2019 Julius Randle. (The incumbent teams can match any offer for a restricted free agent and keep their services.) The names here probably won\u2019t be on the various TV tickers on July 1, 2 or 3 if that\u2019s when they reach deals. But someone smart will grab one or two of them as soon as possible: they\u2019re smart and tough, experienced and capable. And they could be a difference for your squad next spring between winning a playoff series and going fishing. Status: Unrestricted free agent ( UPDATE, July 1:  Reportedly agreed to 1-year deal with Phoenix Suns ) 2018 Opening Night age: 33 2017-18 stats:  11.7 ppg | 4.4 rpg | .368 3pt pct | 112.1 Offensive Rtg | 104.3 Defensive Rtg | .542 EFG pct | .567 TS pct Ariza picked an especially unfortunate time to have the worst shooting game of his career \u2014 0-for-12 from the floor, including 0-for-9 on 3s \u2014 in Game 7 of the Western Conference finals against Golden State. But that shouldn\u2019t be a deterrent for teams looking for a veteran wing defender who was pretty good most of the season behind the arc. The Rockets certainly would be more likely than not to re-sign Ariza, though he likely will be looking for a 3-and-D payout along the lines of what the Toronto Raptors gave DeMarre Carroll in 2015 (four years\/$58 million).  Status: Unrestricted free agent ( UPDATE, July 1:  Reportedly agreed to 2-year deal with Celtics ) 2018 Opening Night age: 31 2017-18 stats : 6.0 ppg | 5.4 rpg | .471 FG pct | 103.9 Offensive Rtg | 97 Defensive Rtg | .474 EFG pct | .502 TS pct Baynes was huge for Boston in the middle, showing durability and flexibility \u2014 he shot more threes (though he didn\u2019t make a ton) and he more than held his own defensively in a career-high 18 minutes per game. The Celtics have to re-sign Marcus Smart, but that shouldn\u2019t prohibit them from re-inking Baynes, who obviously wants to come back \u2014 unless someone with need and cap room were to bust Boston\u2019s budget with a huge offer.  Status: Unrestricted free agent 2018 Opening Night age: 29 2017-18 stats : 13.2 ppg | 5.6 rpg| .507 FG pct | 105.3 Offensive Rtg | 110.8 Defensive Rtg | .528 EFG pct | .556 TS pct We all know the deal with Beasley \u2014 he puts the ball in the basket. You want lockdown defense, you\u2019ve got the wrong guy. But Beasley can score with the best of them, and he\u2019ll stick his nose in there and grab a rebound every now and again. He shot almost 40 percent behind the arc last season for the Knicks, appearing in 74 games \u2014 the most for him in a season since 2012-13. In the small-ball NBA, there should be a whole bunch of teams in the bottom 10 of scoring last season that should be interested in Beasley as a sixth or seventh man type and\/or stretch five who you can count on every night for double-figure scoring. Status: Unrestricted free agent ( UPDATE, July 1:  Reportedly agreed to 2-year deal with San Antonio Spurs ) 2018 Opening Night age: 32 2017-18 stats : 12.1 ppg | 1.9 rpg | .377 3pt pct | 105.3 Offensive Rtg | 107.2 Defensive Rtg | .539 EFG pct | .581 TS pct Belinelli picked Philly when he became a free agent, so you\u2019d imagine he wants to stay there and get a full season in with the emerging Sixers. But that may well depend on how successful the 76ers are in their pursuit of Paul George or Kawhi Leonard. A max deal for either, combined with an expected re-sign of J.J. Redick (well short of the $23 million he made this year, but at a fair market price), along with Joel Embiid\u2019s max extension kicking in , may squeeze Philly at the back end of its payroll (which is where Belinelli and Ersan Ilyasova sit). As Ilyasova continues to earn his keep as a rebounder\/premier drawer of charges, he may be ahead of Belinelli on the Sixers\u2019 priority list. But whether in Philly or elsewhere, Belinelli will be in demand after the first wave. Status: Unrestricted free agent 2018 Opening Night age: 30 2017-18 stats : 6.3 ppg | 4.7 rpg | .516 FG pct | 106.2 Offensive Rtg | 106.6 Defensive Rtg | .528 EFG pct | .557 TS pct Booker inexplicably bounced around last season (Brooklyn, Philly, Indiana). He\u2019s proven himself as a durable, rugged rebounder and post defender over the years. As he was for the Jazz for two years, Booker should be a more permanent member of someone\u2019s rotation. The Pacers have to make decisions on how much to pay Thaddeus Young and whether to bring back Al Jefferson at $10 million next season. But after getting clarity on those two, re-signing Booker on a reasonable deal should be a priority.  Status: Unrestricted free agent 2018 Opening Night age: 27 2017-18 stats : 14.3 ppg | 2.5 rpg | .369 3pt pct | 103.2 Offensive Rtg | 107 Defensive Rtg | .474 EFG pct | .496 TS pct His numbers took a precipitous turn downward across the board in Detroit and L.A. last season. No doubt the Pistons and Clippers weren\u2019t as good as the Celtics, where Bradley had started the previous five seasons. But that begs the question of whether Bradley\u2019s best days there were tied to his teammates and Celtics coach Brad Stevens\u2019 dynamics, or whether they can be replicated elsewhere. The Clippers got Jerome Robinson and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander in the Draft , but Bradley is much better than either of them \u2014 even coming off a season-ending injury \u2014 at the defensive end. Still, with L.A. determined to be a player in 2019\u2019s free-agent class, it\u2019s hard to see the Clips putting big dollars on the table for Bradley and gumming up their cap space, and it\u2019s hard to see there being a robust market for him elsewhere.  Status: Unrestricted free agent 2018 Opening Night age: 25 2017-18 stats : 13.4 ppg | 5.2 rpg | .383 3pt pct | 105 Offensive Rtg | 106 Defensive Rtg | .526 EFG pct | .561 TS pct KCP had to settle for a one-year deal with the Lakers, and acquitted himself well on a rebuilding L.A. team. (He does get hot fast when his shot\u2019s falling.) No doubt the Lakers would like to bring him back, but with their other, uh priorities, KCP could be in demand elsewhere and difficult for them to re-sign. Any contender could use him, but his presence would be especially important in the West, where teams need as many defenders as they can put on the floor to deal with the Warriors and Rockets. Status:  Unrestricted free agent 2018 Opening Night age: 28 2017-18 stats : DNP (stress fracture) The market this summer may not be lucrative for Curry, who likely will have to sign a short deal after missing all of last season. But he did average almost 13 a game for Dallas in 2016-17 , playing almost 30 minutes a night. He\u2019s been back on the court for six weeks and has been cleared for all basketball related activities. He can obviously shoot it and he fared well in his one season as a starter (\u201916-17 with the Mavs). That job is obviously no longer available and Curry does not likely have a future anywhere as a starting one. But he can play. Status: Unrestricted free agent ( UPDATE, July 1:  Reportedly agreed to 2-year deal with Brooklyn Nets ) 2018 Opening Night age: 29 2017-18 stats : 5.3 ppg | 7.4 rpg | .582 FG pct | 107 Offensive Rtg | 103.9 Defensive Rtg | .582 EFG pct | .607 TS pct Davis will provide a fascinating window into what constitutes value in today\u2019s NBA. He should be one of the top bigs in demand this summer. All he does is grab boards and defend and accept his role off the bench. He is loved in the Blazers\u2019 locker room, and Paul Allen will never lose anyone because of money. But Davis isn\u2019t a starter. He isn\u2019t a three-point shooter, so he\u2019s not especially utile as a small ball five. So what is a player with that kind of skill set worth these days? I know what I would pay for a guy like Davis \u2014 who was also top 20 in the league in screen assists per game (3.7) despite not starting \u2014 per NBA.com\/Stats, only Charlotte\u2019s Cody Zeller and Phoenix\u2019s Alex Len averaged more among non-starting bigs. But I\u2019m not a GM with analytic-dominant front office types who\u2019d likely argue otherwise. Status: Unrestricted free agent 2018 Opening Night age: 30 2017-18 stats : 11.2 ppg | 2.8 rpg| .392 3pt pct | 106.4 Offensive Rtg | 103.9 Defensive Rtg | .569 EFG pct | .588 TS pct Ellington has been an elite perimeter shooter for Miami the last two seasons and there should be a pretty substantial payday out there for him. Not for nothing, a team like, for example, the Minnesota Timberwolves \u2014 who drafted him in the first round in 2009 \u2014 that is currently much in need for quality 3-point shooting\/floor spacing off the bench with Jamal Crawford reportedly opting out of his deal would seem to be right in line for a guy like Ellington. Status: Unrestricted free agent (player option) ( UPDATE, July 1:  Reportedly agreed to deal to remain with Spurs ) 2018 Opening Night age: 32 2017-18 stats : 11.5 ppg | 5.1 rpg | .314 3pt pct | 105.6 Offensive Rtg | 103.9 Defensive Rtg | .506 EFG pct | .545 TS pct Gay reportedly opted out of the final year of his two-year deal with the Spurs to test free agency. It is a gamble. He did a lot of good things in San Antonio last season, especially considering he was coming off an Achilles\u2019 injury. And the Spurs, desperate for someone who could create his own shot, put him in the starting lineup throughout their first-round series loss to the Warriors. But Gay is still a volume shooter with limited range. A team that signs Gay would likely want him to be a stretch four, but he\u2019d be a different kind of stretch four \u2014 one that doesn\u2019t actually stretch the D. What he does do, though, is get to the foul line. Among non-starting power forwards, per basketball-reference.com, only Cleveland\u2019s Jeff Green averaged more free throws per 100 possessions than Gay\u2019s six per game. There\u2019s a place for that skills, even in today\u2019s 3-point-dominant NBA. The question is what will teams pay for it. Status: Unrestricted free agent ( UPDATE, July 1:  Reportedly agreed to deal to remain with Thunder ) 2018 Opening Night age: 24 2017-18 stats : 8.4 ppg | 3.9 rpg | .535 FG pct | 105.8 Offensive Rtg | 105 Defensive Rtg | .570 EFG pct | .607 TS pct Grant may surprise people with a big contract early in free agency, but it won\u2019t shock people who are paying attention. He was terrific off the bench for OKC, providing physical play and explosiveness around the rim, and defended guards just fine on switches. And given the Thunder\u2019s existing payroll (thanks, Carmelo Anthony) and overarching desire to re-sign George, it\u2019s very difficult to see a scenario where OKC could re-up with Grant. Is he ready for starter\u2019s minutes and money? Some may say no. At the least, though, he should be in line for the kind of deal that the Denver Nuggets gave Mason Plumlee, another non-starting big (3\/$41 million), last year. Status: Unrestricted free agent 2018 Opening Night age: 32 2017-18 stats: 10.8 ppg | 3.2 rpg | .477 FG pct | 109.5 Offensive Rtg | 105.4 Defensive Rtg | .520 EFG pct | .587 TS pct Jeff Green is Jeff Green is Jeff Green is Jeff Green. He\u2019s a human metronome; you can set your watch by him. He will have 10-15 games a year when he plays out of his mind and looks like an All-Star and the Lottery pick he was more than a decade ago. And, he\u2019ll have 10 duds per year when he looks lost \u2026 and 50-60 solid if unspectacular nights.

Otherwise, he could be a very smart on the low pickup for an up-and-coming team looking for lights-out shooting.

He is 100 percent, according to a source, and has been cleared to return to action for weeks. Anyone who invests in him will get a veteran with real toughness (despite the deteriorating condition in his hip, he played 224 games in the three seasons before having the operation, the last 72 with Philly in 2016-17) who brings an edge to any team he\u2019s on when he\u2019s on the floor, and who\u2019s more than credible from outside (.353 on threes each of his previous two seasons). A veteran team looking for a veteran wing defender could do way, way worse. Philly is such a team, yes? Maybe Henderson still has his old place.

But it\u2019s not likely the Lakers will bring him back. Any team that brings him in, though, knows what an inspiration and solid player they\u2019ll be getting.

The Dubs didn\u2019t pick up their team option for him for 2018-19, so their former first-rounder is unrestricted. He should get a lot of interest; 22-year-olds with two rings don\u2019t usually come on the market that often. And Looney could well be a solid starter for years to come for someone else; that would never be the case in the Bay. He got in great shape last year and showed he could defend multiple positions while making himself available offensively on rim runs and lobs. He doesn\u2019t shoot threes (just five total in more than 900 minutes last season), but it\u2019s not outside the realm of possibility that he could regain the perimeter form that made him a 41 percent three-point shooter in his one year of college at UCLA. Assuming his next stop is elsewhere, he\u2019ll have to extend his range somewhat, unless he goes to another spot with four All-Stars on the floor with him.

Mbah a Moute was central to the Rockets\u2019 switching defense all season, affording Houston the luxury of having three wing defenders (Trevor Ariza and P.J. Tucker the others) who could all hand off scorers to one another with little dropoff. And Mbah a Moute\u2019s proficient on corner 3-pointers kept the floor stretched and created room for Harden and\/or Paul. The Rockets are all-in for a title now, so they may be willing to go well into the tax to re-sign Mbah a Moute when\/if they get that additional dynamic player to go with Harden, Paul and Capela. Smart teams should make them do so by coming after Mbah a Moute hard.

He\u2019ll almost certainly have to take a short deal for short money to prove he can be a legit rotation guy again for a good team.

A playoff team like Utah that is still under the cap and that could create more room by waiving any of its multiple vets on non-guaranteed deals (Thabo Sefolosha, Jonas Jerebko, Ekpe Udoh) could certainly bring in a talented reserve like Scott with next to no impact on the current rotation.

Thomas\u2019 time there was as bad as you could imagine and he was shipped to the Lakers at the trade deadline . After that nightmare of a season, Thomas has to re-establish himself as an All-Star\/MVP level \u2014 but there aren\u2019t that many teams without a starting point guard and minutes\/shots available for same.

The move, which was reported by ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski, will make George an unrestricted free agent. He had until 11:59 p.m. ET on June 29 to decide whether or not to opt in. Here\u2019s more from Wojnarowski on the move and what it means for George, the Thunder and free agency at large : This summer, George can sign a five-year, $176 million extension with OKC, Wojnarowski reports, or he could do a \u201cone-plus one\u201d deal and return to free agency next summer. George\u2019s decision is not wholly surprising, given that he has been one of the top free-agent targets for many teams all season long. On Tuesday night, the first of a three-part ESPN series called \u201cPaul George: My Journey\u201d aired. In it, George discussed his career path to date and the potential free agency that awaits him in mere days. The final episode of the series will air after George makes his decision in free agency. In that special, George said that if he did opt out, he would be both overwhelmed by and looking forward to that free agency experience.  \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of things that go into it \u2014 trying to find the right fit, what\u2019s the best place for me to raise my kids,\u201d George said. \u201cA lot is playing into this, so it\u2019s a bit overwhelming.\u201d In the special, George said he wants to pick the front office that gives him the best chance to win. \u201cI hope I make the majority of the people happy,\u201d George says. \u201cBut ultimately it\u2019s my decision and I want to be the happiest I can be with that decision. And I\u2019m excited. I\u2019m excited to go through this journey.\u201d In 79 games last season, George averaged 21.9 points, 5.7 rebounds, 3.3 assists and two steals per game in 36.6 minutes per game. Shortly after the Thunder lost in the first round of the playoffs to the Utah Jazz, George had a scope of his left knee performed . He is expected to miss six to eight weeks as he recovers from the injury. Days ago, Thunder forward Carmelo Anthony reportedly opted into his deal with OKC for next season . The Thunder traded for Anthony and George to join Russell Westbrook before last season, moves that gave them high hopes of challenging Golden State in the West. It didn\u2019t work out as planned. The 34-year-old Anthony had been the headliner his entire career \u2013 he\u2019s 19th in NBA history with 25,417 points \u2013 but he was more of a catch-and-shoot scorer last season instead of the isolation specialist he had always been. He averaged 16.2 points per game, but struggled at times in his new role. His playing time dwindled in the playoffs and he wasn\u2019t happy. In Game 6 of the first-round playoff series against Utah that ended Oklahoma City\u2019s season, he played fewer minutes than backup Jerami Grant. After the playoff loss, George said all the right things when asked if he\u2019d consider staying with the Oklahoma City Thunder instead of leaving in free agency this summer. \u201cThey honestly check the boxes where I needed those boxes to be checked from what a player wants and needs out of a front office, out of a medical group, out of teammates, out of a coaching staff,\u201d George said on April 28. \u201cI mean, honestly, I can\u2019t say it any more than that. They checked the boxes on what needs to be checked.\u201d Information from The Associated Press was used in this report. * * * East Player Movement | West Player Movement | Free Agent Tracker"},{"id":39750,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/phoenix-suns-wont-re-sign-len-payton","date":"2018-06-28","title":"Report: Phoenix Suns won\u2019t re-sign Alex Len, Elfrid Payton; free $10 million","content":"PHOENIX (AP) \u2014 A person with knowledge of the situation says the Phoenix Suns have decided not to re-sign center Alex Len and point guard Elfrid Payton, clearing some $10 million in salary cap space as the team prepares to make a run at free agents.

He adapted to changes as they occurred and took on a new role each season. Those experiences helped Allen get ready for whatever role is required of him as he embarks on his rookie season with the Utah Jazz. \u201cI\u2019ve never been just a single focal point of an offense since I\u2019ve been in college,\u201d Allen said during his introductory news conference Wednesday. \u201cI know how to play with other talented guys. I know how to play with other really good guys and that\u2019s what you\u2019re going to have to do in the NBA, especially coming in as a rookie and coming into a team who\u2019s already a playoff team.\u201d Allen had to adapt his game over four seasons with the Blue Devils as he adjusted to the influx of one-and-done prospects. Nine different teammates were first round NBA draft picks and four others were second-rounders. The turnover opened the door for Allen to go from being a drive-and-shoot scorer who averaged 21.6 points as a sophomore to a capable defender, playmaker and ball handler as a senior. His goal is to improve in each of those areas as an NBA rookie, a goal shared by Jazz coaches and management. Allen was quick to note that his assist rate improved to a career-high 4.6 per game by his senior season. He also offered a spark as an outside shooter who could hit contested 3s, finishing with a 37 percent average from the perimeter in his final year. Utah\u2019s playing style appeals to him because of the trajectory his own game has taken. \u201cThey play basketball the right way,\u201d Allen said. \u201cI can\u2019t say that enough. I said it right after I got drafted, but watching them play even more games, I see it more and more. They make the right pass. They pass up good shots for great shots. They move the ball. It doesn\u2019t stick in anyone\u2019s hands.\u201d Allen also likes his odds of climbing the development ladder simply because he gets an opportunity to play with Donovan Mitchell. Mitchell was the runner-up to Ben Simmons for NBA Rookie of the Year after averaging 20.5 points, 3.7 rebounds and 3.7 assists in his debut season. Mitchell and Allen were rivals at one time during their college days, but now Allen is embracing Mitchell as a mentor and role model for his own NBA journey. \u201cOne of the big things I\u2019m looking forward to in development is I have Donovan to go up against every day in practice,\u201d Allen said. \u201cHe\u2019s a guy who had an incredible rookie year. If I can just measure up against him each day in practice, and go against him, that\u2019s great for me.\u201d Allen will make his NBA debut Monday, the opening day of the Utah Jazz Summer League."},{"id":39764,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-cavaliers-pick-kendrick-perkins-option","date":"2018-06-28","title":"Report: Cleveland Cavaliers to pick up Kendrick Perkins' option","content":" Cleveland Cavaliers center Kendrick Perkins will have his 2018-19 contract option picked up by the team, per ESPN\u2019s Dave McMenamin .

No, not that one. While waiting to see if they\u2019re in LeBron James\u2019 plans, the Cavaliers intend to extend a $3.4 million qualifying offer to Rodney Hood, making him a restricted free agent and protecting the club if he receives any offers. The team will make the offer to Hood before Friday\u2019s deadline, said a person who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity Wednesday because the club is not publicly discussing its plans ahead of free agency starting Sunday. Cleveland.com first reported the Cavaliers\u2019 intentions with Hood. Also, the Cavs intend to pick up center Kendrick Perkins\u2019 $2.5 million non-guaranteed contract for next season, the person said. The move with Perkins, who signed at the end of the regular season but did not appear in any playoff games, is so the team can potentially use his salary slot in a trade. Perkins has had two stints with Cleveland. Meanwhile, James has until 11:59 p.m. Friday to pick up his $35.6 million contract option for next season or he will become a free agent. The 33-year-old is expected to decline the option, but it\u2019s also possible he could exercise it and be traded if Cleveland works out a deal in order to acquire assets for the three-time champion. The Cavs have not yet heard from James. At this point, days away from free agency officially beginning, anything seems possible. The 25-year-old Hood had an interesting few months with Cleveland, which acquired him from Utah in that flurry of trades executed at the Feb. 8 deadline by general manager Koby Altman. Hood struggled to blend into Cleveland\u2019s rotation, but he\u2019s young and inexpensive and the team believes the 6-foot-8 forward can help it stay competitive \u2013 with or without James. Hood started Cleveland\u2019s first playoff game before losing coach Tyronn Lue\u2019s trust and falling out of the rotation. He re-emerged in the NBA Finals and scored 15 points in the Game 3 loss to Golden State. He averaged 10.8 points in 21 regular-season games with the Cavs. * * * East Player Movement | West Player Movement | Free Agent Tracker"},{"id":39748,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/adam-silver-contract-extension-official-release","date":"2018-06-27","title":"NBA Commissioner Adam Silver's contract extended through 2023-24 season","content":" NEW YORK \u2014 NBA Board of Governors Chairman and Toronto Raptors Governor Larry Tanenbaum announced today that Commissioner Adam Silver\u2019s contract has been extended through the 2023-24 NBA season.

When Indians outfielder Rajai Davis connected off Chicago Cubs reliever Aroldis Chapman for a tying home run in the eighth inning of Game 7 of the 2016 World Series, James came unglued and reacted the way he might after a monstrous dunk or back-breaking 3-pointer in the NBA Finals. And while his fanatical response said a lot about James and his allegiance to the Indians, so did the tight, black T-shirt he wore on that unseasonably warm November night. It said: \u201cCleveland Or Nowhere.\u201d * Report: LeBron doesn\u2019t want intricate free-agency pitch As the sports world waits to see where the three-time champion intends to play next season and beyond, there remains the real possibility that James could choose to stay in Cleveland, his hoops home for 11 of the past 15 years and where this Northeast Ohio son shares a unique and profound connection with fans who have followed him since his teens. James has other options: Los Angeles (salary-cap space for another star, Magic Johnson in charge), Houston (a chance to play on a super team with MVP James Harden), Philadelphia (young stars Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid), and maybe more. But, as has always been the case for James, home will pull at his heart. For the longest time, the perception was that once James ended Cleveland\u2019s 52-year title drought in 2016, he would leave again as soon as he could. That doesn\u2019t seem to be a slam dunk any longer. By Friday, James is expected to make his first move and likely decline a $35.6 million contract option for next season with the Cavs, who are hoping their past loyalties to the 33-year-old and his own sentimental attachments \u2013 family, legacy \u2013 will keep him in Cleveland. Unlike his free-agency forays in 2010 and 2014, James will not meet with prospective teams. He\u2019s letting agent Rich Paul and his other representatives handle the business side of things as he vacations with family and makes up his mind. Months ago, James\u2019 connection with the Cavs seemed broken, hopeless. Last summer\u2019s shocking trade of All-Star Kyrie Irving , the team\u2019s failed attempt to integrate guard Isaiah Thomas, a lack of playmakers, assorted injuries and coach Tyronn Lue\u2019s medical issues contributed to James appearing ready to pull up stakes again and pursue championships elsewhere. But a funny thing happened on the way to the NBA Finals. James was boosted by general manager Koby Altman\u2019s drastic-and-dramatic roster overhaul at the trading deadline, and despite a lack of cohesion and Vegas odds makers labeling the Cavs as underdogs, Cleveland advanced to a fourth straight summer showdown with Golden State, surviving two Game 7s and sweeping the top-seeded Toronto Raptors along the way. Of course, James did all the heavy lifting. He played in all 82 regular-season games and had perhaps his best postseason, averaging 34 points, 9.1 rebounds and 9.0 assists while making a pair of buzzer-beating shots and doing all he could in a Finals sweep that could have been much different if Cleveland had not lost Game 1 in overtime. \u201cHe gave his heart and soul, die-hard energy, commitment to this team, to this franchise, to the city, to Northeast Ohio,\u201d Altman said last week after the Cavs drafted Alabama guard Collin Sexton, who quickly raised some eyebrows by choosing to wear No. 2 , Irving\u2019s number for six seasons with Cleveland. \u201cIt was an historical year and probably one of the best postseason runs of all time. We\u2019re very, very fortunate to have him here and what he gave to this franchise this year was nothing short of remarkable. \u201cWe don\u2019t take that for granted at all.\u201d And it\u2019s why the Cavs haven\u2019t surrendered from the fight to keep him. Owner Dan Gilbert, whose relationship with James remains tricky if not rocky, has displayed a willingness to spend whatever\u2019s necessary to keep his team championship competitive. That\u2019s unlikely to change whether James extends his second stint with Cleveland. In a recent Business Insider podcast, Gilbert referred to James as a \u201cpartner,\u201d an acknowledgment by the billionaire to what the superstar he once criticized means to his franchise. The appeal for James to stay home is different now than it was eight years ago when he bolted for Miami. He\u2019s more mature, with three children and a burgeoning business empire. His priorities, responsibilities and goals are different. After the Warriors finished their Finals sweep of the Cavs, James revealed an injured right hand but an unchanged view of the next phase of his career. \u201cI will still continue to be in championship mode,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I decide what I\u2019m going to do with my future, my family and the folks that have been with me for the last 20 years will have a say-so. Then it ultimately will come down to me.\u201d"},{"id":39783,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/oklahoma-city-thunder-paul-george-excited-free-agency","date":"2018-06-27","title":"Paul George says in ESPN special he is 'excited' for free agency","content":" Short of LeBron James, few players on the prospective free-agent market this summer will be as talked about as Oklahoma City Thunder star guard Paul George. Like James, George has until June 29 to decide to exercise his player option for the 2018-19 season. If George does opt out and test the free-agent waters, he says he will be both overwhelmed by and looking forward to that free agency experience. Last night, the first of a three-part ESPN series called \u201cPaul George: My Journey\u201d aired and, in it, George discussed his career path to date and the potential free agency that awaits him in mere days. The final episode of the series will air after George makes his decision in free agency. Brett Dawson of The Oklahoman has more from the special and what George had to say in it : In 79 games last season, George averaged 21.9 points, 5.7 rebounds, 3.3 assists and two steals per game in 36.6 minutes per game. Shortly after the Thunder lost in the first round of the playoffs to the Utah Jazz, George had a scope of his left knee performed . He is expected to miss six to eight weeks as he recovers from the injury. Days ago, Thunder forward Carmelo Anthony reportedly opted into his deal with OKC for next season . The Thunder traded for Anthony and George to join Russell Westbrook before last season, moves that gave them high hopes of challenging Golden State in the West. It didn\u2019t work out as planned. The 34-year-old Anthony had been the headliner his entire career \u2013 he\u2019s 19th in NBA history with 25,417 points \u2013 but he was more of a catch-and-shoot scorer last season instead of the isolation specialist he had always been. He averaged 16.2 points per game, but struggled at times in his new role. His playing time dwindled in the playoffs and he wasn\u2019t happy. In Game 6 of the first-round playoff series against Utah that ended Oklahoma City\u2019s season, he played fewer minutes than backup Jerami Grant. After the playoff loss, George said all the right things when asked if he\u2019d consider staying with the Oklahoma City Thunder instead of leaving in free agency this summer. \u201cThey honestly check the boxes where I needed those boxes to be checked from what a player wants and needs out of a front office, out of a medical group, out of teammates, out of a coaching staff,\u201d George said on April 28. \u201cI mean, honestly, I can\u2019t say it any more than that. They checked the boxes on what needs to be checked.\u201d George\u2019s camp showed interest in the Los Angeles Lakers last year before the Thunder made the deal with the Indiana Pacers to get him; Los Angeles is near his hometown. George said going home would be enticing, but that wouldn\u2019t be the determining factor. He said he\u2019d talk to Presti, Westbrook and coach Billy Donovan before making a decision. \u201cIt will definitely be the opportunity on knowing, you know, team, personnel, and ultimately like what team will be assembled,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the only thing that it will come down to.\u201d It wasn\u2019t entirely clear after the season that Anthony would opt in. At that point, he said he preferred to play with the ball in his hands more and said coming off the bench is \u201dout of the question.\u201d Despite his confidence, the 10-time All-Star posted career lows in scoring average and field goal percentage last season. Thunder general manager Sam Presti said at the end of the season that he doesn\u2019t expect Anthony\u2019s role to change. \u201dI give him an enormous amount of credit for the fact that he put both feet in,\u201d Presti said. \u201dI personally think he did an excellent job in his first year transitioning his game, working to becoming more of an off-the-ballplayer, being more reliant on other people to generate his offense, and sacrificing a lot. At the same time, I think every player is entitled to take a step back after the season, reflect on the year they had, and in his case have to make a determination about whether or not this is a role that he wants to continue to be functioning in.\u201d Information from The Associated Press was used in this report. * * * East Player Movement | West Player Movement | Free Agent Tracker"},{"id":39758,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/boston-celtics-gordon-hayward-planning-resume-regular-rehab-work-soon","date":"2018-06-27","title":"Gordon Hayward planning to resume injury rehab work soon","content":" Boston Celtics forward Gordon Hayward writes in a new post on his blog that he will be \u201cresuming rehab soon\u201d and has his sights set on \u201cbeing back to my usual self\u201d by the start of the 2018-19 season.

Hayward writes that he is hoping to return to playing full-court, five-on-five basketball by the end of next month. On May 31, the Celtics were minutes away from their first Finals berth in eight years. However, they lost in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference finals to the Cleveland Cavaliers \u2014 a remarkable feat considering they reached that game without injured stars Hayward and Kyrie Irving. Irving missed the final 15 games of the 2017-18 season and the entire playoffs to repair his left knee. Roughly a week ago, Celtics coach Brad Stevens told reporters he is hopeful that Irving could return to the court sometime in August .  All of that points to the Celtics having high hopes for 2018-19, something Hayward also addressed in his blog post.

Now they will. The Wizards traded Gortat, their starting center, to the Los Angeles Clippers for guard Austin Rivers on Tuesday night. Both players are entering the final season of their contracts and are set to earn similar salaries, making a straight-up exchange work under NBA rules. The 34-year-old Gortat is a durable, screen-setting big man who has played 12 years in the league, the past five with Washington.

Get my biceps definition a bit better. You can\u2019t improve 3-point shooting. You can\u2019t improve your shot, specifically for me. I truly believe I\u2019m a solid, good shooter up to 15, 17 feet. But I\u2019m not going to shoot 3s. No, I\u2019m not going to do that. I want to go into the paint. Body people. Be physical. Get scratches. Bleed.\u201d Gortat also discussed the widely held perception that he and All-Star point guard John Wall did not get along. \u201cWe are good. Are we best friends? And, like, the greatest friends? Brothers? Probably not. But I\u2019m not best friends with probably half of the team over there,\u201d Gortat said in April after Washington was eliminated. \u201cSo I have a few good friends, but the rest of them are just my colleagues and teammates.

Rivers, who turns 26 in August, averaged a career-best 15.1 points and four assists last season while playing for his father, Doc, the Clippers\u2019 coach. \u201cHe is coming off a career year and his ability to create offense for himself and others will help our second unit and allow us to play a variety of lineups throughout the season,\u201d Wizards President Ernie Grunfeld said in a statement announcing the trade."},{"id":39800,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/six-nba-teams-host-five-nbl-teams-2018-nba-preseason-official-release","date":"2018-06-27","title":"Six NBA teams to host five Australian NBL teams in 2018 NBA preseason","content":" MELBOURNE AND NEW YORK \u2014 The National Basketball Association (NBA) and the National Basketball League (NBL) announced Tuesday that for the second consecutive year, NBL teams will travel to the U.S. to participate in the NBA preseason.

They are one of a handful of teams with salary cap room to spare and a young roster that could, perhaps, entice a marquee free agent. Team president Magic Johnson isn\u2019t about to put undue pressure on himself, though, to accomplish all his roster goals this offseason. As the team introduced rookies Moe Wagner and Sviat Mykhailiuk to the media on Tuesday, Johnson made it clear he has a long-term view (and a deadline for himself) when it comes to rebuilding the Lakers\u2019 roster. Johnson told reporters that he feels he has two summers to try and sign some elite free agents to the Lakers. If he can\u2019t, he sees his time as team president being short-lived. \u201cNext summer, if nobody comes and I\u2019m still sitting here like this, then it\u2019s a failure,\u201d Johnson said Tuesday. Johnson was put in charge of the Lakers\u2019 front office by owner Jeanie Buss in February 2017, and the former superstar point guard immediately announced his plans to revive the struggling franchise by enticing the game\u2019s best players to join as free agents. With Paul George and potentially LeBron James headlining the market this summer, Johnson is leading the Lakers\u2019 efforts to land both players this weekend. If they sign elsewhere, Johnson and the Lakers will pursue the large crop of 2019 free agents. And if he strikes out with every big name, Johnson said he will quit. \u201cLike I told you when I took the job, it\u2019s going to be a two-summer thing for the Lakers,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThis summer, and next summer, and that\u2019s it. And if I can\u2019t deliver, I\u2019m going to step down myself. She won\u2019t have to fire me. I\u2019ll step away from it. Because then, I can\u2019t do this job. But so far, so good.\u201d When asked if he felt pressure to remake the Lakers\u2019 roster this summer, Johnson played off that question with a degree of the calmness that marked his playing days . \u201cI\u2019m Magic Johnson,\u201d he said with his ubiquitous smile. \u201cYou know how many Finals I\u2019ve been in? So you think I\u2019m worried about this? I played against Larry Bird in The Finals. I played in nine Finals.\u201d Johnson is the second straight basketball decision-maker for the Lakers to create a self-imposed deadline for success. In 2014, co-owner Jim Buss told the Los Angeles Times that the Lakers had to be a contender within three to four years, or \u201cI will step down, because that means I have failed.\u201d The Lakers badly missed that deadline, and Buss\u2019 sister fired him and general manager Mitch Kupchak in February 2017. Johnson and Pelinka are spending this week honing and fine-tuning their free-agent pitches. They\u2019ll show their plans to Jeanie Buss later in the week, along with numerous contingency plans for the short-term and long-term future. \u201cIf we can sign somebody this summer, we\u2019ll do that,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t happen, we\u2019ve got to turn to next summer.\u201d Aside from rebuilding the current roster, Johnson also addressed second-year guard Lonzo Ball. A variety of injuries limited Ball to 52 games as he averaged 10.2 points, 6.9 rebounds, 7.2 assists and 1.7 steals per game and was an All-Rookie Second Team pick . Bresnahan reports (via Twitter) that Johnson has been impressed with Ball\u2019s offseason work to date : Rookies Ball, Kyle Kuzma and Josh Hart all showed clear NBA ability, while youngsters Brandon Ingram and Julius Randle continued their development into above-average pros. Los Angeles\u2019 35-47 record and 11th-place conference finish in the just-completed season are its best performances by a considerable margin during this woeful five-year stretch. Randle played in all 82 games, averaging 16.1 points and 8.0 rebounds and emerging as a dependable two-way player. He is a free agent this summer after the Lakers decided not to lock him down with a contract extension last year. The Lakers\u2019 desire for plenty of cap room this summer means they\u2019ve got four talented veterans with expiring contracts: Brook Lopez, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Isaiah Thomas and Channing Frye. Lopez had a strong debut season with his hometown team, which won\u2019t be able to afford him unless it comes up empty with the top-shelf free agents. Caldwell-Pope also seems likely to leave, while the market for Thomas\u2019 skills is unpredictable after his injury-plagued year ended with hip surgery. If Thomas doesn\u2019t attract a big offer, he seems amenable to a return to LA \u2014 as does Frye, a dependable veteran backup.

The league earned an A+ for racial hiring practices and a B for gender hiring practices for an overall grade of an A. That keeps the NBA \u201csignificantly above\u201d other professional sports, according to the report\u2019s author Richard Lapchick, the director of The Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport. \u201cThe NBA remains the industry leader among men\u2019s sports for racial and gender hiring practices even with the increased grading scales introduced last season,\u201d Lapchck said. The report states that the NBA league office has the best record for people of color in men\u2019s professional sports at a 36.4 percent employment rate. The league, which was first to have three team owners who are people of color, now has seven women who served as team presidents\/CEOs during the 2017-2018 season \u2013 the highest among men\u2019s professional sports. The report states there are also more NBA general managers and head coaches of color than in the past. The general managers who are people of color doubled from last season from 10 percent to 20 percent overall, which puts the NBA well ahead of other men\u2019s sports leagues. That\u2019s a big positive, Lapchick said. As for head coaches, there were 30 percent of all NBA head coaches were people of color last season. But following the coaching changes at the end of this past season one-third of all NBA head coach are now people of color. The same trend has trickled down to the assistant coach level, where the percentage of people of color increased from 45.4 percent in the 2016-2017 to 45.7 percent this past season. Likewise, there was an increase in the percentage of people of color as vice presidents at the team level too, increasing to 25.4 percent this past season, up nearly six percent from the previous season. Lapchick also said that in two of the other categories that were reclassified \u2013 team management and team professional staff \u2013 the percentage of people of color increased significantly from 23.4 percent to 31.2 percent and from 32.6 percent to 39.5 percent, respectively. Lapchick had some concerns when it comes to gender hiring at the team level, a category which dropped for the third straight year. The percentage of women decreased for team vice presidents and team professional staff. Women who held team vice president positions made up 23.5 percent, a slight decrease from last year\u2019s study. The percentage of women in team professional staff positions decreased by 2.9 percentage points from 40.1 in to 37.2 percent. \u201cIt\u2019s something we are keeping an eye on,\u201d Lapchick said. \u201cIn men\u2019s sports in general gender hiring is a major concern.\u201d However, Lapchick said the NBA still outpaces other leagues in gender hiring. Despite those slight drop-offs in gender hiring, Lapchick called Commissioner Adam Silver and the NBA the \u201cindustry leaders\u201d among all men\u2019s professional sports leagues in overall racial and gender hiring practices."},{"id":39795,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nba-announces-partnership-gatorade-jr-nba-world-championship-official-release","date":"2018-06-26","title":"NBA announces partnership with Gatorade for Jr. NBA World Championship","content":" The NBA and Gatorade are partnering for the Jr. NBA World Championship, a first-of-its kind global youth basketball tournament for the top 13- and 14-year-old boys and girls teams from around the world. The inaugural event will take place at the state-of-the-art ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex at Walt Disney World Resort near Orlando, Fla. from Aug. 7-12. The road to the Jr. NBA World Championship is underway as six of the eight U.S. regional tournaments are complete, which means 12 of the 16 U.S. teams that will compete at the world championship event in Orlando are set. The last two regional tournaments \u2013 the Northeast Regional in Ardsley, N.Y. and the Northwest Regional in Salem, Ore. \u2013 will take place this weekend (June 29 \u2013 July 1) to determine the remaining U.S.-based boys and girls teams that will receive an all-expenses-paid-trip to compete in Orlando against the top eight boys and eight girls teams from around the world. As part of the partnership, Gatorade will be along every step of the way \u2013 from the eight regional tournaments around the country to the culminating event in August.  In Orlando, Gatorade will support the event\u2019s off-court programming, including Gatorade Sports Science Institute athlete testing as well as heat safety and hydration sessions with professional athlete speakers, in addition to having a variety of products for the participants to use and signage at each regional competition as well as the global event. While the Jr. NBA World Championship will feature great competition on the court, the mission behind the youth basketball event goes beyond that. The regional competitions to-date have featured life skills sessions led by current and former NBA and WNBA players including, Spencer Dinwiddie, Cherokee Parks, Sam Perkins, Derrick Coleman, Tamika Catchings and Alvin Williams. The remaining regional tournaments will feature similar activities to educate the youth both on and off the court. In addition to promoting the core values of the game \u2013 Teamwork, Respect, Determination and Community \u2013 the Jr. NBA World Championship also aligns with the NBA and USA Basketball Youth Guidelines that aim to improve the way children, parents and coaches experience the game. This includes an emphasis on promoting player health and wellness and age-appropriate rules and standards. The NBA\u2019s relationship with Gatorade dates back to 1984 when it became the league\u2019s official sports drink partner. Gatorade is also an official partner of the WNBA and the entitlement partner of the NBA G League. Having the NBA\u2019s longest-standing partner come aboard for its new global youth basketball tournament is fitting as both the league and Gatorade look toward setting a new standard in youth sports."},{"id":39798,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/new-york-knicks-enes-kanter-still-weighing-option-excited-about-david-fizdale","date":"2018-06-26","title":"Enes Kanter still weighing 2018-19 option, is excited about new coach David Fizdale","content":" One of the few bright spots for the New York Knicks last season was the play of center Enes Kanter. Not only did he have a solid overall season (14.1 points per game, 11 rebounds per game, 59.2 percent shooting), he served as a vocal leader at times for the Knicks and someone who had his teammates\u2019 backs throughout 2017-18 . Kanter has until Friday to decide whether or not to opt out of his contract and enter unrestricted free agency. As he mulls that decision, he told the New York Post \u2018s Marc Berman last night he is excited about the Knicks\u2019 new direction. In particular, Kanter cited new coach David Fizdale and a conversation he had with him at the NBA Draft Combine in Chicago in May. Here\u2019s more from Berman on Kanter, who says he still is unsure about opting in or not with the Knicks : The Knicks were 29-53 last season, missing the postseason for the fifth straight season, and have posted four winning seasons since 2000 . Kanter was acquired by the Knicks with Doug McDermott in a trade last summer that sent Carmelo Anthony to the Oklahoma City Thunder . Kanter has established himself as one of the better scoring big men in the league, holding career averages of 11.7 ppg and 7.3 rpg in 516 career NBA games. He was taken third overall in the 2011 draft by the Utah Jazz and then dealt to OKC in 2015 as part of a three-team deal with the Thunder and Detroit Pistons. Fizdale had spent eight seasons before going to the Memphis Grizzlies in Miami, where the Heat reached four straight NBA Finals. He is the 11th Knicks coach since Jeff Van Gundy resigned in the 2001-02 season. Fizdale went 50-51 with the Grizzlies, leading them to the postseason in his only full season before getting fired early last year after clashing with star Marc Gasol. He becomes the 29th coach in franchise history, hoping to lead the Knicks out of what is now a five-year postseason drought. He replaced Jeff Hornacek, who lasted two seasons in New York before getting fired hours after the 2017-18 season finale. Fizdale said he couldn\u2019t pass up the chance to coach at Madison Square Garden, even though he was a candidate for jobs where there is more stability. \u201cThe risk\/reward thing was, I just said to hell with it,\u201d Fizdale said. \u201cIt\u2019s the Knicks, what are we talking about here?\u201d Information from The Associated Press was used in this report. * * *"},{"id":39797,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/kia-nba-awards-winners-release","date":"2018-06-26","title":"Winners from 2018 NBA Awards on TNT presented by Kia","content":"SANTA MONICA, Calif. \u2014 Turner and the NBA on Monday night held the 2018 NBA Awards on TNT presented by Kia at Barker Hangar in Santa Monica, Calif.

Harden joined Michael Jordan as the only players to average at least 20 points, eight assists, five rebounds and 1.7 steals in a season. He led the league in scoring, 3-pointers and 50-point games with four while helping the Rockets to an NBA-leading 65 wins. \u201cThe last four years have been like knocking on the door, knocking on the door.

He has until Friday to tell the Cavaliers if he will pick up his $35.6 million option for next season or opt for free agency. Harden, who is from Los Angeles, led his mother on stage before he accepted the trophy from Commissioner Adam Silver. \u201cI\u2019m not going to get emotional,\u201d he said from behind dark sunglasses. \u201cShe\u2019s my backbone in good times and bad times.\u201d Harden received a total of 965 points and 86 first-place votes. James finished second with 738 points and 15 first-place votes, while Davis was third with 445 points and no first-place votes. Harden didn\u2019t prepare a speech. \u201cI felt like last year I should have won as well, so I didn\u2019t see a difference between last year and this year,\u201d he said backstage. \u201cIf I won it, then I was going to go off the top and try to show my appreciation to everybody helping me along the way.\u201d Harden\u2019s teammate, Chris Paul, popped up among reporters backstage and asked Harden how many bottles of liquor Rockets CEO Tad Brown would have to buy at the next location. \u201cCouple cases,\u201d Harden said, grinning. The Rockets had another winner in Daryl Morey, who was honored as Executive of the Year. In other awards, Ben Simmons of the Philadelphia 76ers won Rookie of the Year. The guard averaged 15 points, eight rebounds and eight assists, joining Hall of Famer Oscar Robertson as the only rookies to post those numbers in a season. Simmons helped Philadelphia to a 52-30 record, including ending the season with a 16-game winning streak. He beat out finalists Donovan Mitchell of Utah and Jayson Tatum of Boston. Guard Victor Oladipo of the Indiana Pacers earned Most Improved Player. He averaged 23.1 points in his first season with the Pacers while nabbing his first All-Star berth. He also led the league in steals for the first time. The Defensive Player of the Year went to center Rudy Gobert of the Utah Jazz. He was the leading vote-getter for the league\u2019s All-Defensive first team while anchoring a Jazz defense that ranked second in the NBA in defensive rating. Lou Williams of the Los Angeles Clippers took Sixth Man honors. The guard became the first player to average at least 20 points for the first time in his 13th season or later. He led the league in fourth-quarter points and scoring average. Williams kissed his two young daughters on his way to the stage after becoming the Clippers\u2019 third winner in the last five years. Dwane Casey was chosen Coach of the Year for his work with the Toronto Raptors, who fired him last month. He has since become coach of the Detroit Pistons. \u201cCan\u2019t look in the rear view mirror,\u201d Casey said backstage. \u201cWinston Churchill said success is measured by failure, failure, and then come back with enthusiasm, and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve done.\u201d Casey led the Raptors to the No. 1 seed in the East for the first time in franchise history after winning a team-record 59 games. Casey coached the East in the All-Star Game for the first time. Casey won over Quin Snyder of Utah and Brad Stevens of Boston. Robertson received the Lifetime Achievement Award from presenters Charles Barkley and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Robertson is the career leader in triple-doubles and was the first player to average one for a season. His antitrust case against the NBA also ushered in free agency for players, which Robertson said was his most important assist. Backstage, Robertson commended the activism of today\u2019s players, although he wondered why more white athletes aren\u2019t speaking out. \u201cThe only thing that really bothers me is where are the white athletes when this is happening?\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not a black athlete problem. You see injustice in the world. It\u2019s all around.\u201d Robertson went on to say he hopes \u201cthe whites and the blacks get together, even with the football,\u201d a reference to NFL players who have taken a knee or sat in silence during the national anthem to protest police brutality and racial inequality. Former NBA player Dikembe Mutombo received the Sager Strong Award, named for the late Turner Sports broadcaster. He donned a garish sports coat similar to what Craig Sager always wore.

The team will not pick up the team option next season, Pacers President of Basketball Operations Kevin Pritchard said Monday. \u201dThis was a very difficult decision, but as free agency begins on July 1, we want to have flexibility so that we can prepare for all of our available options,\u201d he said. A year ago, Pritchard decided to trade star Paul George before almost surely losing him in free agency and got Victor Oladipo and Domantas Sabonis from Oklahoma City in a deal that turned out remarkably well for Indiana. Oladipo emerged as a leader, earned his first All-Star trip and won the league\u2019s steals title. Sabonis, a lottery pick in 2016, became a key contributor off the bench. Point guard Darren Collison was the NBA\u2019s most accurate 3-point shooter, and Thaddeus Young and Bojan Bogdanovic thrived in their roles, too. Myles Turner, Indiana\u2019s 22-year-old center, was one of the league\u2019s leaders in blocks. Four of the starting five and Sabonis are already under contract for next season, with Young being the lone exception. He and backup point guard Cory Joseph have player options. Stephenson brought grit off the bench for a team that won 48 games, fell just short of finishing in the top four in the Eastern Conference and was within four points late in a first-round, Game 7 loss to Cleveland. Stephenson, an eight-year veteran, finished the season averaging 9.2 points, 5.2 rebounds and 2.9 assists per game. The decision was no doubt wrenching for a team that bonded in finishing strong: Six players approached Pritchard before the trade deadline and pleaded with the GM not to make any moves because they wanted to close out the season together. Pritchard said it a first for him, and kept the team intact."},{"id":39802,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/legendary-moments-history-houston-rockets-draft-yao-ming-2002","date":"2018-06-25","title":"Legendary Moments In NBA History: Houston Rockets draft Yao Ming with No. 1 pick","content":"Standout big men such as Elvin Hayes, Hakeem Olajuwon and Moses Malone helped the Houston Rockets make their mark on the NBA at large.

The New York Knicks, Miami Heat, Chicago Bulls, New Jersey Nets, LA Clippers and the Cavs all flew delegations to meet with him and sell him on their respective franchises. James ultimately ended up announcing via an ESPN-televised special that he was choosing the Heat in free agency. * Cavs GM: \u2018Good dialogue\u2019 with LeBron\u2019s camp  When he returned to the Cavaliers in the summer of 2014, he did so via a letter published by Sports Illustrated . In the past few offseasons, many teams around the NBA have prepared elaborate free-agency pitches for that summer\u2019s big names in free agency \u2014 whether it was LaMarcus Aldridge, Carmelo Anthony, Gordon Hayward or other All-Star players on the open market. The results of those have been mixed, with stars not always picking the team that put on the best show . * * *"},{"id":39796,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-la-clippers-milos-teodosic-opts-deandre-jordan-future-unknown","date":"2018-06-25","title":"Report: Milos Teodosic opts in with LA Clippers; DeAndre Jordan's future unknown","content":" One of the more dazzling players on the LA Clippers\u2019 roster last season is apparently set to stay with the team for 2018-19. As for the team\u2019s stalwart center, his future remains unknown. According to Broderick Turner of the Los Angeles Times , rookie guard Milos Teodosic is opting in for next season with the Clippers. He dazzled with his court vision last season and averaged 9.5 points, 4.6 assists and 2.8 rebounds per game, playing in 45 games. His season was slowed, though, by a pesky plantar fascia injury. Center DeAndre Jordan, however, has yet to make a decision. Jordan \u2014 who was second in the NBA in rebounds per game (15.2) and field goal percentage (64.5 percent) last season \u2014 is still mulling his options, Turner reports : Jordan and the team have yet to agree on an extension, as talks were on and off throughout last season. \u201cI want to be where I\u2019m wanted,\u201d Jordan said at season\u2019s end. \u201cI want to have a chance to contend. That\u2019s really what I\u2019m looking at.\u201d He averaged 12 points and 15.2 rebounds, but just 0.9 blocks \u2014 his lowest since the 2009-10 season. Jordan has spent his entire 10-year career with the Clippers and he turns 30 in July.

For me, assigning winners and losers tags 12 hours after a Draft is just as ridiculous as the mock drafts that precede it. I defy you to take any collection of 18-to 20-year-olds doing anything, and predict with any level of correctness which one or two of them will become great at it in five to seven years. That\u2019s the whole reason the Draft is a crapshoot; kids, being kids, develop \u2014 or, don\u2019t \u2014 at their own pace. Some develop their abilities immediately; others, not at all. Others gain or enhance what they already have through diligent work and study; others waste the talents they have. Still others are waylaid by bad decisions and\/or bad luck. None of this is known to any of us 12 hours after a Draft. That isn\u2019t to say people can\u2019t have opinions about who they think will do well as pros. But having them with certainly is ridiculous. Words matter. It is important to choose the right ones. In reviewing the Draft, we should be instructed by the words of some who used them as art and science, who informed as well as educated and entertained, and who are and were among the best ever at the craft of writing. In such ways we can begin to take a stab at opining on what choices may pan out and become stars, which players have a chance to be solid contributors, and those who have some work to do to reach their potential. * * * Everyone knew who resided there, too, although their actual status was never put into words. Not only that, everyone knew the name of the individual who ranked foremost in the Olympus, the ace of all the aces, as it were, among the true brothers of the right stuff. \u2014 Tom Wolfe, \u201cThe Right Stuff\u201d * * * \u2022 Luka Doncic, Dallas Mavericks: Dallas gambled, and it isn\u2019t an insignificant one, sending its 2019 first-round pick \u2014 protected 1-5 next year, but a rebuilding team never should give up on a Lottery pick, even a late Lottery one \u2014 along with swapping first-rounders this year to be able to take the 18-year-old Doncic out of the ACB League. But when you have a chance to get a potentially great talent, you do it, and the Mavs did it. Doncic will get tested (exposed?) at the defensive end and he will have to get in better shape at the next level \u2014 our NBA TV colleague David Griffin used the soon-to-be immortal term \u201cfleshy\u201d in describing Doncic at present. But no one has ever done what he did in EuroLeague at that age. He is not afraid of big moments with the ball in his hands. You still wonder how Doncic and Dennis Smith Jr. will share the ballhandling load as each needs the rock in his hands to be most effective. But in today\u2019s NBA you have to have multiple playmakers on the floor, and this gives Dallas two good young ones. Coming back in the second round with a nails person like Jalen Brunson \u2014 the consensus player of the year in college basketball last season for the national-champion Villanova Wildcats \u2014 and arranging to take a flier with the last pick in the Draft on Dayton\u2019s Kostas Antetokounmpo \u2014 completed a strong night for GM Donnie Nelson and the Mavs\u2019 braintrust. \u2022 Wendell Carter, Jr., Chicago Bulls: There\u2019s just something about a kid whose finalists for college were Duke and Harvard. And there\u2019s a reason so many NBA scouts and other personnel types compared Carter to Boston Celtics All-Star center Al Horford \u2014 there\u2019s a calm and a quiet toughness to Carter, who won big in high school and helped lead Duke to the Elite Eight (along with fellow first-rounders Marvin Bagley III and Grayson Allen). The Bulls have historically revered their centers as \u201cthe man in the middle\u201d since the days of Tom Boerwinkle. Carter will be the next man for the next decade. \u2022 Collin Sexton, Cleveland Cavaliers: Sexton\u2019s pro potential is the subject of some debate among those who traffic in such things in the blogosphere, but here it says the Alabama guard has a chance to be an impact player both in the short and long term. Cleveland was enamored with him from jump; he crushed his interviews with the team both in Chicago and during his individual workout for the Cavs. No matter what LeBron James decides , Cleveland needed to get younger and more dynamic, and start bringing in people who have some defensive DNA in their makeup. * * * People in their right minds never take pride in their talents. \u2014 Harper Lee, \u201cTo Kill A Mockingbird \u201d * * * \u2022 Marvin Bagley III, Sacramento Kings: So many LukaStans in Sacramento \u2014 who knew? I heard from many of them after I deigned to praise the selection of Bagley III at No. 2 overall. He only averaged a double-double ( 21 points and 11.1 rebounds per game ) as a freshman in the ACC while becoming just the second freshman in ACC history to be named Player of the Year. You are entitled to think Doncic will be a better pro; he may well be. But you are not entitled to call the Kings idiotic for preferring Bagley III, a ridiculously springy four prospect. Perhaps you did not notice Sacramento was 28th in the league last season in rebounds per game. And, as with Jabari Parker in Milwaukee a couple of years ago, it counts more than a little that Bagley III was enthusiastic about coming to Sacramento. He visited and worked out for the Kings before the Draft when others did not. (Doncic, at least, had a credible reason; he was still playing overseas in the ACB playoffs.) There are no guarantees, of course; Bagley III may well not turn out to be worth the second pick. But it will stun if he\u2019s not at least a plus, 10-year guy in this league. \u2022 Michael Porter, Denver Nuggets: We all get that this has nothing to do with Porter\u2019s talent. A year ago, he was the clear-cut choice to go No. 1 in this Draft coming out of high school. But his back injury and subsequent surgery , which limited him to one game after five months\u2019 recovery, scared a lot of teams off. Teams like their own doctors to get their hands on Draft prospects, and other than one physical examination by the Bulls\u2019 doctors that was disseminated to teams around the league, nobody else\u2019s team physicians did. (It is a level of the respect that teams around the league have for Mark Bartelstein, Porter\u2019s agent, that everyone accepted this arrangement.) Both Porter and the Nuggets say he\u2019s fine physically, but Denver also stressed patience after taking him. There\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with Porter taking a redshirt year to fully strengthen and rehab his back. If he gets back to form he\u2019ll be better than anyone \u2014 save, perhaps, a player or two \u2014 that will be in the 2019 Draft. \u2022 Anfernee Simons, Portand Trail Blazers: The now 19-year-old went the Thon Maker route, opting to spend a post-grad year at a basketball factory after graduating from high school in Florida rather than taking the one-and-done path in college. After his year at IMG Academy in Bradenton, Fla. , Simons was eligible for the NBA Draft. And, like Maker \u2014 who was taken 10th overall in 2016 by Milwaukee after a post year in Canada \u2014 Simons\u2019 decision paid off, with a first-round selection this year by Portland. Simons is as raw as they come into the pros, but the Blazers have both the patience (no one\u2019s taking significant minutes from the Damian Lillard\/C.J. McCollum backcourt any time soon) and the coaching staff to get Simons up to speed. Bottom line: Simons gambled on himself, and won. * * * He was interested in my potential, I could tell from things he would say. And I worshiped him. \u2014 Malcolm X, \u201cThe Autobiography of Malcolm X\u201d * * * \u2022 Jaren Jackson, Jr., Memphis Grizzlies: Jackson was the youngest U.S.-born player in the Draft, but he was the absolute right choice for Memphis. The Grizzlies needed to give their fans some hope that a re-imaging of the Grit-N-Grind era was possible. (The Grizz doubled down on that by taking the Draft\u2019s most ornery pit bull, West Virginia guard Jevon Carter, in the second round.) I\u2019m not buying for a minute that Jackson had some change of heart about Memphis at the 11th hour , but he came to understand the realities of life in the NBA \u2014 you don\u2019t always get to your first choice, but you have to make it work wherever you are. So Jackson will display his significant talents in the 901, playing alongside All-Star center Marc Gasol up front. But he will be so young for a few years. Memphis will have to be patient. \u2022 Trae Young, Atlanta Hawks: No one doubts Young can shoot with incredible accuracy and distance, and in today\u2019s NBA, that means he can be an impact player immediately. He will be impossible to check with a single defender with his quickness and ability to create off the dribble. Which is why he\u2019s going to have to show he can make defenses pay when he gets trapped or doubled, which will happen early and often off screen-and-rolls. Despite leading the nation in assists at Oklahoma, Young occasionally had trouble finding open teammates against college defenses. That challenge will grow exponentially in the pros. Young measured 6-foot-1 \u00be at the 2018 Chicago Draft Combine yet remains so quick he\u2019ll still be able to be effective against most defenders. Steve Nash and Stephen Curry \u2014 the players often compared to Young \u2014 were each 6-3, and that inch and a half or so could make a big difference. Defensively, Young has to show much more in the NBA than he did in college. What he did there won\u2019t be near good enough at the next level, where almost every NBA team has an All-Star at point guard. \u2022 Mohamed Bamba, Orlando Magic: With his quickness and shot blocking, the Texas center will be a force defensively immediately, and will be on the floor early for new coach Steve Clifford. But he will have to show he can consistently be trusted with the ball at the other end. The last great Magic center, Dwight Howard, could not only rim-run at his peak, but got very efficient with a jump hook and drop step in the post. The game\u2019s different now, so Bamba will have to become proficient behind the arc. After pre-Draft work with player development guru Drew Hanlen, Bamba\u2019s shot improved noticeably. Hanlen lowered Bamba\u2019s shot pocket on jumpers \u2014 \u201che shot it way behind his head,\u201d Hanlen said \u2014 and changed Bamba\u2019s finger placement on the ball. He also eliminated a hitch in Bamba\u2019s shot so that the ball comes out earlier, before defenders can recover. But Bamba is far from a finished product, He will have to show he can work at a pro level both on and off the floor. * * * What else do I want, I ask. I think you know, she says. I do? I think you do. I think I do, I say. But there\u2019s one thing I still don\u2019t know., There is? I don\u2019t quite know how to get it \u2014 what I want. You don\u2019t? Not quite. Not quite? I really don\u2019t. Her smile, so arch and delicately contained, now broadens, and she says, Just reach. Reach? Just reach, she says. \u2014 Scott Turow, \u201cPresumed Innocent\u201d * * * \u2022 Troy Brown, Washington Wizards: I don\u2019t dislike Brown, an 18-year-old from Oregon who has both positional size and smarts. (The 29 percent he shot on 3-pointers last season would scare the snark out of me, but everyone around the Wizards swears he\u2019s got good mechanics and should improve there.) What I do dislike is taking two kids who\u2019ll take years to get online at the NBA level in the Draft \u2014 Washington took 18-year-old point guard Issuf Sanan in the second round, but he\u2019ll stay overseas for at least a couple of years \u2014 when the window for John Wall, Bradley Beal and Otto Porter Jr. to contend in the Eastern Conference is rapidly closing. The Celtics are already way past the Wizards. The Philadelphia 76ers are on the verge of going to hyperspeed, while the Toronto Raptors are also better, the Indiana Pacers have caught up to them and the Milwaukee Bucks aren\u2019t going to be stuck in neutral much longer. Plus there\u2019s a 9-trillion pound leviathan named LeBron James whose team will remain the favorite if he stays in Cleveland. Brown\u2019s arrival date will have to be speedy for this pick to make sense. \u2022 Lonnie Walker IV, San Antonio Spurs: Walker was projected to go higher \u2014 late Lottery at the worst \u2014 in the days leading up to the Draft, such was the interest in Walker\u2019s prodigious athletic gifts . But some hits on his medicals \u2014 nothing career-threatening, but more than insignificant \u2014 along with some odd statements made during some of his pre-Draft interviews (you want to cause eyebrows to rise up in confusion and alarm, say the word \u201cHitler\u201d and then stand back ) may have contributed to his slight fall to No. 18. That it was the Spurs who caught him would be, most years, prophetic that Walker will turn into a multi-time All-Star. The Spurs don\u2019t normally draft 18th, but they need more young talent. Walker fits that bill and San Antonio has a need for a young two to go with Dejounte Murray. \u2022 Robert Williams, Boston Celtics: The sophomore center should have gone much higher than 27th, but concerns about makeup and work ethic sent him down toward the bottom of the first. The Celtics were the beneficiaries; Williams will be able to play to his strengths for an elite team in limited minutes, where his motor issues in college won\u2019t be as big an issue. * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

You. Go. Doncic Does Dallas. From Brent Luckey: As I noted in my Draft review , Brent, I think Luka has a real chance to be a superstar and the Mavs have a chance to return soon to a position of relevance in the Western Conference. More important, though, is the 100-day plan that the team undertook after reports of a toxic workplace culture on the business side of the organization surfaced in Sports Illustrated last February should be nearing completion. No one doubts the serious and sincerity of CEO Cynthia Marshall, hired after the scandal broke. She will make strong and smart recommendations, and the external investigation the Mavericks have initiated into their shop by hiring two high-profile prosecutors should connect some of the dots that remain unclear. But Mavs owner Mark Cuban needs to do more than accept responsibility for what happened before on his watch. He has to be aggressive going forward, and proactive in accepting and implementing innovations that empower women and make them feel like full partners on the business side. To my big brother George \u2014 the richest man in town! From Colin Iheanacho: Ressler was clear that he didn\u2019t think former coach Budenholzer could handle both the coach and GM jobs, leading to the Hawks stripping Budenholzer of his head of basketball ops job and picking Schlenk as GM last year . The organization made a mistake with Horford, in my view, but didn\u2019t get the offers it wanted for Millsap before he left. That\u2019s a decision, one of a hundred a team makes every day. If you put a few hundred million \u2014 or, increasingly, a billion or more \u2014 into a franchise, you get some say in the matter, Colin. Schlenk knows this, as does every GM in the league these days. Schlenk acknowledged there was a Doncic-Young split within the organization (though my understanding is that the basketball people, including Schlenk, were for Doncic,  but liked Young enough that getting the 2019 first from Dallas was worth making the deal with the Mavericks) . It doesn\u2019t make Atlanta dysfunctional that there was disagreement; every organization worth its salt does. In the end, after some debate, Ressler and the Hawks\u2019 owners relented to the wishes of the basketball people, which is all that should be important to you as a fan of the team. You can\u2019t spell \u201cboorishness\u201d without \u201cboo.\u201d From Travon Neal: Travon, you\u2019ve written a cogent, well-thought out, persuasive e-mail. It has no place in sports. What can Brown do for you? From Sam Soufi: I\u2019m pretty sure the Wizards wanted Jerome Robinson from Boston College, Sam. But he went two picks ahead of them, to the LA Clippers. Washington, as I reported Thursday, would not have taken Michael Porter, Jr,, even if he hadn\u2019t gone to Denver at 14. And, I\u2019m told, they weren\u2019t inclined for different reasons to take either Williams or Walker. They could have gone for Donte DiVincenzo or Kevin Huerter there, but they liked the size and smarts of Brown more. The issue more for me with Brown is the timeline \u2014 how long will it take for him to become a contributor , with John Wall and Bradley Beal in their prime? But I do think he will be one in time. We\u2019re gonna need those hats back, fellas. From Derek Morris: I hated the 30 minutes between when the Sixers picked Bridges and when they traded him more than the trade itself. Bridges is ready-made to play now and it was a great (if brief) story of the local kid who made good coming home. But while Smith is far from a sure thing, he has some serious upside as a two-way player and is athletic as hell. You can see what Philly saw in him \u2014 and the unprotected 2021 first the Sixers got from the Suns (which came from Miami in the Goran Dragic deal) to swap picks could be a huge chip in three years. But you just wish, if there was any inkling that he could be traded, that the Sixers had pulled Bridges and his mother aside and gotten them off the interview circuit. I know Draft night trades often come together quickly and there may have been nothing the team could have done. But it was a terrible look nonetheless. On a greenback, greenback dollar bill\/Just a little piece of paper, coated with chlorophyll. From Kat Wilkinson: Your opinion is shared by many, Kat. But James and many max-level players who played on rookie-scale contracts at a significant discount for a good chunk of their early careers (and, in James\u2019 case, took less than the max to put the SuperFriends together in Miami) feel they\u2019ve sacrificed enough. To them, it\u2019s up to management to put a team around them good enough to compete at the highest level. It requires a special kind of financial gymnastics, of course, and some good fortune (the Golden State Warriors signed Stephen Curry to a four-year, $44 million extension in 2012 just as he found a long-term solution to his ankle problems and entered his MVP caliber prime). It\u2019s part of the power that NBA players increasingly wield. Not only do you have to pay them every dollar possible, you have to be able to show them how you can do that and still give them a chance at a ring.

The Blue Devils\u2019 streak continued this year with Marvin Bagley III (second, to Sacramento), Wendell Carter, Jr. (seventh, to Chicago) and Grayson Allen (21st, to Utah) going in the first. Duke\u2019s first-round streak dates to 2009 , when Gerald Henderson went 12th overall to Charlotte; the year before , no Blue Devils player was taken in either round. Since \u201909, including Bagley, Carter and Allen, 19 Duke players have gone in the first round. 9 \u2014 Consecutive years in which at least one player from the University of Kentucky has been taken in the first round of the NBA Draft. The Wildcats\u2019 streak also continued this year with the selection of Kevin Knox (ninth, to New York) and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (11th, to Charlotte, then traded to the Clippers). The last year no Wildcat went in the first round was 2009 , when the only Kentucky player taken was guard Jodie Meeks, in the second round, by Milwaukee. Since then, including Knox and Gilgeous-Alexander, 27 Wildcats have gone in the first round. $100,322 \u2014 Price paid by an unknown bidder for LeBron James\u2019s jersey that he wore in Game 1 of this year\u2019s Finals, when he scored 51 points in the Cavs\u2019 infamous overtime loss to the Warriors. 1) We will finally find out the heretofore unknowable secret of who won the 2018 Kia MVP award and other superlatives tonight at the NBA Awards ceremony in California ( 9 ET on TNT ). I will be particularly pleased to see Oscar Robertson receive the NBA\u2019s Lifetime Achievement Award . Every modern day player has two people that he should thank every time he steps on the floor \u2014 Robertson and Spencer Haywood. 2) Marc Eversley, the Sixers\u2019 vice president of player personnel, is the logical and obvious choice to replace Brian Colangelo in Philadelphia as general manager. He\u2019s paid his dues with stops at Washington and Toronto before coming to Philly; he has outside experience making big decisions as a former Nike executive and he\u2019s well-regarded around the league. It may be too close to the start of free agency to make an official announcement, but one should be forthcoming soon. 3) That it is no longer a big deal that the NBA, starting with Adam Silver, is a prominent part of the New York Pride Parade is indicative of how doing the right thing over and over makes what seems controversial at first accepted behavior soon after. And kudos to Detroit Pistons forward Reggie Bullock, whose transgender sister Mia Henderson was murdered in Baltimore in 2014, for taking part and for honoring his sister as he continues to raise awareness of violence and abuse against transgender people. 4) File this under \u201c things I never thought would ever intersect with one another for $200, Alex \u201d . Very cool and appreciated. https:\/\/twitter.com\/nlbmprez\/status\/1010721551992451072\/photo\/1 1) It\u2019s odd to comment on something that we still don\u2019t know for sure happened. But let\u2019s say for the sake of argument that my Turner colleague Kevin McHale did attend a rally for President Trump last week in Minnesota. Again: Kevin has not said a word about whether the person on the screen cap is him (if it isn\u2019t, no more calls, please, we have a doppelganger winner). But if it is \u2026 so very what? What Kevin McHale does with his free time, as long as it isn\u2019t illegal or harming others, is of no concern to me, and it should be of no concern to you. Among the many things that are being fought for these days are the rights of American citizens to express their beliefs freely \u2014 again, as long as they aren\u2019t done in a threatening\/dangerous manner to others (Nazis marching in the streets of Charlottesville with tiki torches, followed by one of their supporters killing a counterprotester by running her over with his car, would qualify here as \u201cthreatening\/dangerous\u201d). If Kevin supports President Trump and his policies, well, go with God. Obviously, I don\u2019t. But I don\u2019t talk about politics with Kevin when we work together; we talk about basketball, and he is one of the premier experts on that subject currently roaming Earth. And, he\u2019s funny and self-deprecating and I enjoy working with him, and will continue to enjoy it. 2) Best wishes for a speedy recovery to Tiny Archibald , who received a heart transplant last week , per fellow Hall of Famer Rick Barry. 3) This seems petty , people of Houston. Do better. 4) No Tip next Monday, because I will be hip deep in free agent calling\/texting with folks, and you will want to know everything that\u2019s going on in that world rather than other NBA news.

He is under contract for another year. Our goal is to keep him as part of our program for a long time.\u201d \u2014 Spurs General Manager R.C. Buford , to local reporters , in a post-Draft press conference, on the current status of Kawhi Leonard\u2019s relationship with the team. \u201cIt\u2019s not like teams are saying \u2018oh, I\u2019m not going to do a deal with the Lakers,\u2019 but I do think when you have 16 banners, there\u2019s going to be a natural envy from your competitors.\u201d \u2014 Lakers General Manager Rob Pelinka , to local reporters after last week\u2019s Draft , on the perception that other teams are not willing to trade with his team \u2014 a perception reinforced by reports that the Spurs are not willing to do any Kawhi Leonard trade with Los Angeles. \u201cI raise my hand as a part of the problem. When the Miami Heat decided to bring the big three together \u2014 myself, LeBron James, Chris Bosh \u2014 in 2009, the game changed. Players understand their power.

No one is certain what LeBron will do and therefore the Cavaliers are in a holding pattern in regards to their future plans, save for one future building block. When they selected Alabama point guard Collin Sexton with the eighth pick in Thursday\u2019s draft , they committed to the growth and development of the player who could serve as the franchise\u2019s point guard of the future. Making that commitment without knowing what LeBron will do in free agency is a departure from the way the Cavaliers have operated the last four years. Sexton represents Cleveland\u2019s (and more specifically rookie GM Koby Altman\u2019s) first opportunity to show off their player development component since Kyrie Irving served as the face of the franchise on his own, before LeBron came home from Miami four years ago.

The New York Times first reported the 34-year-old Anthony\u2019s decision to bypass the chance to become a free agent. A person with knowledge of details confirmed Anthony\u2019s choice to The Associated Press on Friday night. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the situation publicly. The Thunder traded for Anthony and Paul George to join Russell Westbrook before last season, moves that gave them high hopes of challenging Golden State in the West. It didn\u2019t work out as planned. The 34-year-old Anthony had been the headliner his entire career \u2013 he\u2019s 19th in NBA history with 25,417 points \u2013 but he was more of a catch-and-shoot scorer last season instead of the isolation specialist he had always been. He averaged 16.2 points per game, but struggled at times in his new role. His playing time dwindled in the playoffs and he wasn\u2019t happy. In Game 6 of the first-round playoff series against Utah that ended Oklahoma City\u2019s season, he played fewer minutes than backup Jerami Grant. It wasn\u2019t entirely clear if Anthony would opt in. After the season, he said he prefers to play with the ball in his hands more and said coming off the bench is \u201dout of the question.\u201d \u201dSo it\u2019s something I really have to think about, if I really want to be this type of player, finish out my career as this type of player, knowing that I have so much left in the tank and I bring so much to the game of basketball,\u201d he said. Despite his confidence, the 10-time All-Star posted career lows in scoring average and field goal percentage last season. Thunder general manager Sam Presti said at the end of the season that he doesn\u2019t expect Anthony\u2019s role to change. \u201dI give him an enormous amount of credit for the fact that he put both feet in,\u201d Presti said. \u201dI personally think he did an excellent job in his first year transitioning his game, working to becoming more of an off-the-ballplayer, being more reliant on other people to generate his offense, and sacrificing a lot. At the same time, I think every player is entitled to take a step back after the season, reflect on the year they had, and in his case have to make a determination about whether or not this is a role that he wants to continue to be functioning in.\u201d \u2014 AP Basketball Writer Brian Mahoney contributed to this report."},{"id":39839,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/deandre-ayton-arrives-symbol-phoenix-suns-are-rise","date":"2018-06-23","title":"Deandre Ayton arrives as symbol that Phoenix Suns are on the rise","content":"PHOENIX (AP) \u2014 Since the heady days of Steve Nash came to an end, there have been few signs of joy from a dwindling fan base that watched the Phoenix Suns tumble to the bottom of the NBA standings and miss the playoffs for the eighth year in a row. Then came the announcement that Deandre Ayton would go to the Suns with the first overall pick. A huge cheer went up from the several thousand fans at Talking Stick Resort Arena on Thursday night for the draft party. General manager Ryan McDonough, owner Robert Sarver and coach Igor Kokoskov came out of their meeting room to watch and bask in that rare moment of sheer joy from the fans. \u201dIt was a pretty special moment for our franchise,\u201d McDonough said. Not only that, but McDonough engineered a last-minute trade for swingman Mikal Bridges of Villanova, the 10th pick. It was a spendy move because Philadelphia demanded and got Miami\u2019s unprotected 2021 first-round pick. But the Suns are weary of stockpiling assets. It\u2019s time to cash in, they figured, and did it with that trade. \u201dWe weighed the pros and cons of trading it heavily and carefully,\u201d McDonough said. \u201dWe were only going to put it in play if we had a chance to get a special player and that\u2019s how we feel about McKell.\u201d All four of the Suns\u2019 picks showed up on a crowded dais in Phoenix on Friday \u2013 Ayton, Bridges, French point guard Elie Okobo (chosen 31st) and forward George King of Colorado (the 59th selection). The 7-foot-1 Ayton towered over the others, in a white unbuttoned collared shirt and a sharp blue suit, but he looked and sounded a bit weary from the whirlwind of being the No. 1 draft pick. His only sleep lately, he said, was a couple of hours on the plane ride from New York on Tuesday. \u201dI\u2019m just excited to finally get a jersey on and be able to play five-on-five again,\u201d Ayton said. Ayton had been the frontrunner for the No. 1 pick ever since the draft lottery and any doubts were erased when he went through an individual workout with the Suns, the only team which he did so. McDonough said that Ayton\u2019s workout \u201din and of itself was as impressive as I\u2019ve ever seen in my 16 drafts in the NBA.\u201d Ayton is seen as strictly a center, so how does he fit in the modern style of the NBA, when center plays is diminished and players are essentially interchangeable, is a question. Ayton replied that he\u2019s no ordinary center. \u201dI don\u2019t like it when people think I\u2019m just a guy down low,\u201d he said. \u201dThey haven\u2019t watched me shoot the basketball.\u201d Ayton and Bridges say they got to know each other well at the college awards ceremony in Los Angeles but never figured they\u2019d be on the same team. \u201dIt\u2019s like I\u2019ve known him my whole life,\u201d Bridges said. Now comes the hard work, molding a team with Ayton, Devin Booker and Josh Jackson. A billboard of those three already has been erected downtown. The Suns, so bad for so long, seem on the brink of being relevant. \u201dWe\u2019re very hungry,\u201d Ayton said. \u201dI think the great team chemistry and the work ethic that we have, especially us guys coming in, we\u2019re going to bring it to the next level. We\u2019ve got young legs. We can run all day. \u2026 We can really start a winning legacy.\u201d And Ayton is the reason for the sudden leap in optimism, even though he won\u2019t turn 20 until next month. \u201dI embrace it a lot,\u201d he said of the expectations placed upon him. \u201dThrough my career I\u2019ve always had that on my shoulder, the expectations. I represent a whole nation (Bahamas) I just do that the best that I can and just help this community start over and be the best player I can possibly be. I just want to be the best great player.\u201d Kokoskov says Ayton possesses \u201da unique talent for the decades.\u201d Ayton said he wants \u201dto be the best person on and off the court.\u201d Now the Suns move on to the next phase. Free agency starts July 1 and McDonough wants some veteran players to add to this very young core. He said the team should have $15 million to $20 million to spend. \u201dWe were aggressive last night with the picks and the trade up to get Mikal,\u201d McDonough said. \u201dWe\u2019re going to continue to be aggressive for the next couple of weeks in free agency. We\u2019ve got some money to spend and we\u2019re looking to spend it on the best players we can get.\u201d"},{"id":39838,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/dirk-doncic-dallas-mavericks-tap-brakes-inevitable-comparisons","date":"2018-06-23","title":"Dirk to Doncic: Dallas Mavericks tap brakes on inevitable comparisons","content":"DALLAS (AP) \u2014 Luka Doncic didn\u2019t get compared to Larry Bird when he was introduced a day after the Dallas Mavericks traded up to get the third overall pick in the NBA draft . For president of basketball operations Donnie Nelson, that\u2019s progress based on his last experience of getting a tender-aged European in hopes of lifting the Mavericks out of the doldrums. Twenty years later, Dirk Nowitzki is the highest-scoring foreign-born player in league history. Back then, the big German wasn\u2019t remotely comparable to Larry Legend \u2013 and his rough first two years proved it. So ask Nelson about a player the Mavericks clearly coveted heading into the draft in Doncic, and he\u2019ll choose his words carefully regarding the 19-year-old from Slovenia. Doncic won\u2019t turn 20 until after the All-Star break of his rookie season, which is expected to be Nowitzki\u2019s record 21st with one franchise. \u201dDirk and I had a long talk coming in,\u201d Nelson said about the player Dallas drafted days after his 20th birthday in 1998. \u201dWe\u2019re obviously very excited to have (Doncic) but he\u2019s got a very tough road ahead of him. Dirk wasn\u2019t done any favors in his first two years. We are going to steer away from any of those comparisons. Luka is his own guy. He\u2019s got his own challenges.\u201d Coach Rick Carlisle dropped a few international names in trying to describe the versatility Dallas thinks is offered by the 6-foot-7 Doncic, who won Euroleague MVP and Final Four MVP honors while helping Real Madrid win the title just days before the draft. After offering comparisons to the late Drazen Petrovic, three-time champion Toni Kukoc and longtime San Antonio star Manu Ginobili, Carlisle stopped. \u201dI really feel it\u2019s important that we shouldn\u2019t try to compare this guy to anybody,\u201d Carlisle said Friday during an introductory news conference that included Doncic and second-round pick Jalen Brunson, who won two NCAA titles in three years at Villanova. \u201dLet him be himself. Let his game takes its own form.\u201d Doncic figures to shape the future of the Mavericks in some form with Dallas coming off consecutive losing seasons for the first time since the second of Nowitzki\u2019s two difficult years at the start of his career. Those 1990s-era Mavericks had 10 straight losing seasons. Combine the drafting of Doncic with last year\u2019s ninth overall pick in point guard Dennis Smith Jr. and a still-young leading scorer in Harrison Barnes, and Carlisle expects the losing to stop soon, if not this coming season. \u201dLast night was symbolic to me that it was kind of a defining moment in this rebuild,\u201d said Carlisle, who had just one losing season as a coach before the current Dallas slide. \u201dWe\u2019re going propel forward with the idea that we\u2019ve got to start winning games.\u201d Just as he did last year with Smith, Carlisle is declaring Doncic a starter, which means the opening night lineup will have a teenager for the second straight year. Youth partly explains a two-year record of 57-107, including the 24-58 mark last season that landed Dallas the fifth pick before the draft-night trade with Atlanta on Thursday. Another explanation was an unusually large number of undrafted players, including a young German in Maxi Kleber who grew up watching his countryman become the 2007 MVP and 2011 NBA Finals MVP. The Mavericks haven\u2019t won a playoff series since taking their only title in 2011, and have missed the postseason three of the past six seasons coming off a 12-year playoff streak. Doncic might only get one chance to get Dallas back on track with Nowitzki, the 13-time All-Star who has hinted that 40 is a nice round number as a retirement age. If this is it for Nowitzki, Nelson sees a trio in Barnes, Smith and Doncic that reminds him of Michael Finley mentoring Nowitzki and point guard Steve Nash and helping the Mavericks end a 10-year playoff drought in 2001. \u201dMichael Finley was our Harrison Barnes back in the day,\u201d Nelson said. \u201dWe feel like we\u2019ve got that here in a different form. There\u2019s just some really cool elements to this that take me back and remind me about what it was like 20 years ago when we were watching these young guys.\u201d Just don\u2019t remind Nelson about the Nowitzki-Bird comparisons."},{"id":39835,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-dallas-mavericks-likely-will-hold-luka-doncic-out-summer-league","date":"2018-06-22","title":"Report: Dallas Mavericks expected to hold Luka Doncic out of Las Vegas Summer League","content":"Many of the players selected in Thursday night\u2019s Draft will be on display next month in NBA Summer League .

(AP) \u2014 General manager Mitch Kupchak wants point guard Kemba Walker to end his NBA career right where it started \u2013 with the Charlotte Hornets. Kupchak said Friday that Walker is \u201crevered\u201d in the Charlotte community, and that he and owner Michael Jordan look at the two-time All-Star as \u201cthe focal point of this franchise going forward.\u201d The 28-year-old Walker has been the subject of possible NBA trade talks as he prepares to enter the final year of his contract with the Hornets. That speculation has amped up recently because it is a practical impossibility for Charlotte to sign Walker to an extension before he becomes a free agent in July of 2019 since the Hornets are so tight under the salary cap. \u201cI think everybody is aware of the situation, if you follow basketball a little bit, it is unique that he is on an extension that may make it a challenge going forward to figure out before he becomes a free agent,\u201d Kupchak said. At $12 million per year, Walker is well underpaid when compared to the other top point guards in the league. But that doesn\u2019t mean Kupchak is giving up hope the team can keep Walker in Charlotte. \u201cI don\u2019t think it is anybody\u2019s goal to lose him in free agency,\u201d Kupchak said. \u201cBut going forward, in the community, in the franchise, this is a player that we hope is with us \u2013 not only for the next couple of years, but ends his career here.\u201d The Hornets don\u2019t have much experience behind Walker at point guard.

His jersey number showed them something else: He\u2019s fearless. Sexton made quite a first impression by deciding to take No. 2, his college number but also the one previously worn in Cleveland by All-Star point guard Kyrie Irving. After showing off his jersey at a news conference Friday, Sexton said he doesn\u2019t feel pressure to live up to Irving\u2019s high standards. \u201cNot at all,\u201d he said. \u201cComing in, I\u2019m going to set goals for myself and then as well there\u2019s going to be team goals set. But I feel like I\u2019m not going to have to live up to anybody\u2019s shoes, but I\u2019m going to come in and learn and be the best player I can be on the court as well as off the court.\u201d Some Cleveland fans feel No. 2 should be retired. After all, Irving made the biggest shot in franchise history in Game 7 of the 2016 Finals before asking to be traded last summer to escape the daunting shadow cast by LeBron James. Maybe one day No. 2 will hang in the rafters. For now, it belongs to Sexton. With an eye toward rebuilding \u2013 and maybe persuading James to re-sign this summer \u2013 the Cavs selected Sexton, the lightning-quick Alabama point guard, on Thursday night with the No. 8 overall pick. As a freshman, the 19-year-old Sexton carried the Crimson Tide to the NCAA Tournament, for a brief time giving the school\u2019s rabid football fans a late-winter diversion before coach Nick Saban blew his whistle in spring practice. The Cavs believe Sexton, who earned his \u201cYoung Bull\u201d nickname in high school for his charge-ahead playing style, can help them finally offset the loss of Irving. Without him, Cleveland lacked a dependable second-scoring option for James; the club spent the entire season with a virtual revolving door at the position as coach Tyronn Lue started eight point guards. Irving\u2019s absence was never felt more than in the Finals as the Golden State Warriors only had to concentrate on James. The Cavs didn\u2019t have another player capable of breaking down their defense. Sexton gives Cleveland a new weapon. He\u2019s in good hands. At Alabama, Sexton played for former NBA guard Avery Johnson, and he\u2019s being passed to Cavs coach Tyronn Lue, a 14-year pro looking forward to developing the youngster. \u201cI\u2019ve watched him play,\u201d Lue said. \u201cI understand who he is as a player and as a person, talked to his parents a lot throughout the course of his college selection, so I know them very well. I\u2019m just excited, man. To be able to have a young talent that I can help mold and build and make better and teach him what suit to wear, what shoes to wear with a suit, how to tie a tie, when you go to dinner, things like that that Bryan Shaw and Robert Horry and Ron Harper and those guys taught me, so I\u2019m very excited about that.\u201d Sexton wowed the Cavs during his personal workout, which came one day after Cleveland was swept by the Warriors. He attended Game 4, and as he witnessed James, Kevin Durant and others competing at the highest level the game offers, Sexton could imagine one day being part of the action. \u201cLike the seats were shaking,\u201d he said. \u201cFans were screaming. Just I feel like I\u2019ll be ready to play in something like that when it\u2019s my time.\u201d Sexton smiled throughout his introductory news conference, which came following a nearly sleepless night in New York. And while he came across as easygoing and affable, there\u2019s a darker side to Sexton. On the floor, he\u2019s ferocious. \u201cWhen you get between those lines, there\u2019s no friends,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you get between those lines it\u2019s us against them, and we\u2019re trying to win.

After doing so, GM Koby Altman \u2014 the man tasked with keeping James in Cleveland this summer \u2014 says he had a \u201cgood dialogue\u201d with LeBron and his camp. James has until June 29 to exercise his $35.6 million contract option for next season or decline it and become an unrestricted free agent, officially making him the planet\u2019s best and most coveted player. The Cavs chose Alabama guard Collin Sexton with the No. 8 pick last night, who immediately made a pitch of sorts to try and get LeBron to stay. As for Altman, he told reporters after the 2018 Draft that James has more than earned the right to play out his free-agency decision how he chooses. ESPN\u2019s Dave McMenamin has more from Altman, who briefly discussed his conversation with James : Following Game 4 in The Finals, James said he\u2019ll factor in his family\u2019s well-being along with his thirst to win more titles into a decision that once again has Cleveland edgy. James has remained off social media since the playoffs began in April, and his self-imposed blackout has continued since the Finals ended. If James doesn\u2019t stay in Cleveland, there\u2019s a strong chance he\u2019ll look to join the Los Angeles Lakers, who have salary-cap room to sign two maximum contract players. James already owns two homes and a film production company in Southern California. Moments after the team selected Sexton last night, the Alabama playmaker made his appeal for LeBron James to resign with Cleveland. \u201dMan, LeBron, let\u2019s do it,\u201d Sexton said during ESPN\u2019s telecast from the draft in Brooklyn. \u201dLet\u2019s do it. I\u2019ve you needed a few extra pieces this past season, and let\u2019s do it. Let\u2019s go back to the Finals.\u201d Sexton averaged 19.2 points and 3.6 assists as a freshman for the Crimson Tide, and the 19-year-old also led the school to the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2012. The confident 6-foot-3, 190-pounder is a proven scorer and he addresses a major need for the Cavs, who traded All-Star point guard Kyrie Irving to Boston last year and spent all season trying to replace him. Cleveland coach Tyronn Lue started eight different point guards during the regular season. Sexton said he had one of his better workouts with the Cavs, and that while he was in Cleveland he attended Game 4 of the Finals. The Cavs passed on a chance to take Missouri forward Michael Porter Jr., whose back issues have caused him to drop in the draft. Porter was selected No. 14 by Denver. * * * Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":39857,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/after-falling-draft-michael-porter-jr-eager-prove-value","date":"2018-06-22","title":"After falling to No. 14 in Draft, Michael Porter Jr. eager to prove value","content":" BROOKLYN \u2013 Pick after pick, Michael Porter Jr. sat and waited \u2013 and waited \u2013 as other players\u2019 names got called in the 2018 NBA Draft Thursday night at Barclays Center. Teams are given five minutes to make their selections in the first round, and as one after another sent NBA commissioner Adam Silver out to the lectern to announce their decision, those intervals got longer and longer for Porter. The applause he offered up for each of his peers, as their dreams came true while his just laid there, shortened to a few claps. The smiles he had for their good fortune flattened out ever so slightly. An evening meant to be celebrated stretched on and, if it wasn\u2019t exactly a root canal, it got uncomfortable as Porter grew ever more self-conscious. Remarkably skilled and worthy \u2013 if healthy \u2013 of being taken with the No. 1 pick overall, the 6-foot-10 Porter slid all the way to No. 14, the final lottery slot, before landing with the Denver Nuggets. For Deandre Ayton, the Arizona center who seemingly is NBA ready and actually was the first player selected, the night went almost as if scripted, delivering him close to home to the Phoenix Suns. For fellows such as Duke\u2019s Marvin Bagley III, young EuroLeague star Luka Doncic, Oklahoma scorer Trae Young and so many of the other talented prospects in the Class of 2018, it was a basketball graduation ceremony of sorts and the start of some notable careers. For Porter, though, it was a wild, frustrating, emotional thrill ride he wanted to stop. His value had been driven down by back surgery that wiped out most of his lone college season at Missouri, followed by an abruptly cancelled workout last week and rumors of a freshly ominous doctor\u2019s report. The risk vs. reward scale tipped against Porter in the final few days before the Draft. And so he sat. \u201cI\u2019m not going to lie to you \u2013 I was stressed out,\u201d Porter said after Denver ended his ordeal. \u201cAll that stress was overcome by joy the moment I got called, no matter what the number was. \u201cAt the end of the day, the draft is a number and I wasn\u2019t going to let an ego get in the way of my joy.\u201d Joy is what the Draft typically is about. It\u2019s a talent distribution system for the league\u2019s 30 teams, first and foremost. It\u2019s a rite of passage into pro basketball life for the young players. Full NBA Draft Coverage |  Draft Board: Picks 1-60  It\u2019s also an opportunity for those guys to recognize and thank the families, friends, amateur coaches and close allies who helped them get so far. The NBA even made a point this year, before the ESPN telecast began, of introducing each prospect with his parents or relatives in tow on the stage. It\u2019s not supposed to be an endurance test or a medical diagnosis conducted in the public square, though that\u2019s how it went for Porter. \u201cHonestly, through those dark times I\u2019ve had \u2013 I don\u2019t want to say \u2018dark,\u2019 those harder times for me to stay positive \u2013 it\u2019s been my family, my agent who keep making me believe the right things,\u201d he said. \u201cThey all know I\u2019m going to do great in this league and I\u2019m going to have a long, successful career. Their whole message to me was, you want to be with the organization that believes that as well. That happens to be the Denver Nuggets.\u201d Porter\u2019s agent, Mark Bartelstein, had to pat his client on the back a couple times and, more than once, reassure him. Turns out, Porter did talk by phone to a Nuggets representative Thursday afternoon, so he had some confidence he would not slide beyond No. 14. Getting there was the unpleasant part. Porter, who will turn 20 on June 29, suffered a back injury two minutes into his University of Missouri debut and underwent a microdiscectomy procedure on two spinal disks. He played limited minutes in only three games, too small a sample size for some teams to take a gamble. He had one solid \u201cpro\u201d day, working out for scouts this spring. But he abruptly cancelled a second workout day last week, citing a sore hip. That scared off more of the top pick-holders. \u201cObviously it was difficult,\u201d Bartelstein said. \u201cHere\u2019s a kid who, in our opinion, probably was the most talented player in the draft. \u2026 We understand the concerns teams have. But we\u2019re confident he\u2019s going to have an unbelievable career. The doctors we\u2019ve talked to have given him an excellent prognosis. \u201cThe Nuggets got themselves the steal of the draft.\u201d In a perfect world, that\u2019s how every franchise and fan base would feel \u2013 or 28 anyway, with Toronto and Miami not holding picks this year. Certainly the expectations were high for those choosing earliest, synched up with a talent crop that some insiders felt went six, seven or eight players deep before a noticeable step down. Ayton, the 7-foot-1 center picked by Phoenix, was a near-consensus choice to go first after averaging 20.1 points on 61.2 percent shooting, with 11.6 rebounds and 1.9 blocked shots for the Wildcats. He represented a first and a second in draft history: the Suns never had picked No. 1 in their 50-year history, and he joined Mychal Thompson (1978) as the only Bahamian players selected first overall. Ayton, 19, never played basketball until he was 12 years old. Sacramento picked Bagley at No. 2, choosing a relatively known commodity who averaged 21 points and 11.1 rebounds at Duke and earned raves for his finesse and footwork. That served up Slovenian star Doncic for Atlanta at No. 3. The youngest MVP ever in the EuroLeague while playing for Real Madrid (Spain) last season, Doncic is considered a wing with point guard skills but more of a project. With that in mind, the Hawks subsequently shipped Doncic\u2019s rights to Dallas in return for a future first-rounder and the rights to Young, selected at No. 5. Young, the first player in NCAA Division I history to lead the nation in both scoring (27.4 ppg) and assists (8.7 apg), gives the Hawks a player with formidable offensive capabilities and considerable defensive liabilities. In between Doncic and Young, Memphis \u2013 despite multiple rumors that the Grizzlies preferred to deal the No. 4 pick \u2013 used it on Michigan State center Jaren Jackson, Jr. In a Draft class with a half-dozen solid big men, Jackson is rated as perhaps the best two-way player among them. Mo Bamba, the Texas big man who had charmed every team and media gaggle with whom he met this spring, was taken with the No. 6 pick by Orlando. Bamba\u2019s outrageous 7-foot-1 wingspan and raw potential was an understandable draw for Magic GM John Hammond, the man who drafted Giannis Antetokounmpo to Milwaukee in 2013 . Orlando\u2019s new coach, Steve Clifford, has a strong reputation for developing top big men, too. Big man Wendell Carter Jr., who teamed with Bagley at Duke, went to Chicago with the No. 7 pick. Next was Alabama guard Collin Sexton, to Cleveland at No. 8 as the last vestige of value from the Cavaliers\u2019 reluctant trade last summer of All-Star guard Kyrie Irving. Silver\u2019s announcement of Sexton brought a roar from the New York Knicks fans in the crowd and a funny\/awkward moment for Porter and his guests at their table near the stage. Delighted to see a potential star still on the board at No. 9, the fans began their chant: \u201cMic-hael Por-ter!\u201d [clap, clap, clap-clap-clap] \u201cMic-hael Por-ter!\u201d Only the Knicks opted for Kentucky combo forward Kevin Knox. Instantly, the fans who had been excitedly chanting, cut loose with a chorus of boos. Even Porter, his parents Michael Sr. and Lisa; his brother Jontay and the others smiled and clapped at that head-snapping shift in moods. At No. 10, Philadelphia took Villanova forward Mikal Bridges, whose party was seated one table over from Porter\u2019s. At No. 11, Charlotte grabbed Kentucky point guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (trading his rights to the L.A. Clippers moments later for two future second-rounders and the rights to the No. 12 picks, Michigan State\u2019s Miles Bridges. That\u2019s when Bartelstein leaned over, patted Porter on the back and offered some encouragement. The Clippers still were in play at No. 13, their second lottery pick. Silver announced that pick and, again, it wasn\u2019t Porter. They chose Boston College guard Jerome Robinson, a lottery longshot whose party was seated at a table adjacent to Porter\u2019s. That\u2019s when a pair of video cameras descended on Porter\u2019s group, one leaving after about a minute but the other lingering through the whole five minutes before Denver picked at No. 14. This time, finally, the news was good. Bartelstein knew what was up even before the commissioner emerged from backstage. The silver script lapel pin on Michael Porter Sr.\u2019s suit coat \u2013 \u201cFaith\u201d \u2013 came through. \u201cI was never anxious,\u201d said the elder Porter, an assistant coach at Missouri. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t define who you are as a player. What defines you is what you do once you get there.\u201d Bartelstein neither confirmed nor dismissed reports floating around Thursday that Porter might \u201credshirt\u201d his first NBA season as a precaution to allow his back \u2013 and anything else \u2013 to completely heal before facing the rigors of an 82-game season. \u201cWe\u2019re not thinking about that right now,\u201d the agent said. \u201cWe just want to get him completely healthy and eliminate the issues that have been there. He\u2019s 19 years old and his body responds very quickly.\u201d Porter\u2019s father has the same long view: \u201cWe don\u2019t have any expectation other than, at some point, he\u2019s going to be healthy and he\u2019s going to show who he is as a player.\u201d At which point it will have been worth the wait. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Other first round picks (much to the chagrin of the Bridges family of Philadelphia) exchanged hands in deals at the 2018 NBA Draft. But in regard to players already under contract, it was a quiet night. A year ago, we saw the Minnesota Timberwolves trade for Jimmy Butler and the Brooklyn Nets trade for D\u2019Angelo Russell on Draft night , with Dwight Howard going from the Atlanta Hawks to the Charlotte Hornets two days prior. Two years ago, Draft night included the trade that sent Victor Oladipo from the Orlando Magic to the Oklahoma City Thunder , with Derrick Rose going from the Chicago Bulls to the New York Knicks the day before. Three years ago, it was Nicolas Batum to Charlotte . Four years ago, Even Fournier was sent from the Denver Nuggets to the Magic . And of course, in 2013, it was on Draft night that we learned of the Celtics-Nets trade that would (officially go through in early July and) set Boston up for the future with a bevy of Brooklyn picks. This year, we had the Nets and Hornets agree to a deal on Wednesday . But that deal was about the salaries of Howard and Timofey Mozgov a lot more than it was about what those guys do on the floor. Charlotte wanted to duck the luxury tax next season, while Brooklyn wanted to shed the extra year in Mozgov\u2019s contract. In fact, the Nets are reportedly set to waive Howard after the trade goes through after the July moratorium. On Thursday? Nothing. There wasn\u2019t a single deal consummated (or even reported) that involved a player already under contract. No salary dumps. No proven commodities for promise and potential. No bad contract and a good pick for a slightly better contract and a slightly worse pick. The Hawks and Mavs reportedly discussed adding Kent Bazemore and Wesley Matthews to the deal involving the third and fifth picks, but Dallas apparently didn\u2019t like the extra year on Bazemore\u2019s deal. This is set up to be a wild summer. LeBron James can opt out of his contract and become a free agent. Paul George can leave Oklahoma City if he chooses. And Kawhi Leonard reportedly wants out of San Antonio . It\u2019s a huge summer in L.A., where the Lakers have tons of cap space and assets to pursue players that aren\u2019t free agents (like Leonard, obviously). It\u2019s a huge summer in Philadelphia, the Sixers\u2019 last chance to spend big money on free agents to complement their young stars. And it could be a big summer in Boston, where the Celtics can stand pat with a roster favored to win the Eastern Conference next year or swing for the fences by trading one of their young stars for a top-five player (like Leonard, obviously). There are some good (but not great) teams that would love to shake things up (see Wizards, Washington) and there are still some contracts that teams would love to shed (see Schroder, Dennis). Both objectives are easier said than done these days, but if Mozgov\u2019s contract can be traded twice in 12 months, anything can happen. There are some intriguing free agents beyond James and George. Will DeMarcus Cousins and Isaiah Thomas get the money they\u2019re looking for, despite their injuries? Eventually, Howard will find his seventh team in the last seven years. But we\u2019ll have to wait. Players with contract options for next season have a week to decide on what they\u2019re doing. James will make his decision on his time and the Spurs aren\u2019t going to rush into a Leonard deal. If they do trade him, they control where he goes and when he goes there. That could be before or after the big free agents make their decisions. Will a Leonard trade affect the decisions of James and George or vice versa? We could see some activity between now and July 1, when teams can start talking to free agents. Trades will be discussed and options will be exercised or declined. But James, Leonard and George remain the biggest dominoes. And the activity around Thursday\u2019s Draft didn\u2019t alter the landscape one bit. * * * John Schuhmann is a staff writer for NBA.com.

Buford expressed his hope that the Spurs will be able to do just that, telling reporters their goal is to keep the two-time All-Star in San Antonio \u201cfor a long time\u201d despite his reported desire to play elsewhere . Leonard has requested a trade from San Antonio because he is unhappy after missing most of last season with a right quadriceps injury.

Leonard sought an outside opinion after the Spurs cleared him to play, working with his own medical team in New York in an attempt to return to the court. The 6-foot-7 forward reportedly grew upset that the Spurs had questioned his rehabilitation process. The Spurs listed him as out on their injury reports for much of the year citing \u201cinjury management.\u201d While San Antonio was in the playoffs, losing in the first round to eventual repeat champion Golden State, Leonard was rehabbing in New York \u2014 which meant that Spurs coach Gregg Popovich, when asked about the situation, deferred all comment to \u201cKawhi and his group.\u201d \u201cI think all of us would wish that things would have gone differently,\u201d Buford said.

Popovich reportedly met with Leonard in California earlier this week in the hopes of clearing the air.

Young is best known for his 3-point shooting. The Hawks selected Maryland\u2019s Kevin Huerter, a shooting guard, at No. 19 overall. Atlanta\u2019s third first-round pick was power forward Omari Spellman of Villanova, at No. 30 overall. Atlanta\u2019s second-round pick, point guard Devonte Graham, averaged 17.3 points and 7.2 assists last season at Kansas. Full NBA Draft Coverage |  Draft Board: Picks 1-60 | Doncic goes to Dallas The Hawks drafted guard Luka Doncic of Slovenia with the No. 3 overall pick and then traded rights to Doncic to Dallas for rights to Young, the No. 5 overall pick, and a 2019 first-round pick. The trade was announced at the draft. Hawks general manager Travis Schlenk focused on outside shooters in the draft. Young led the nation with his averages of 27.4 points and 8.7 assists for Oklahoma. He is the first player to lead the nation in scoring and assists in the same season. Huerter made 42 percent of his 3-point shots as a sophomore last season at Maryland while averaging 14.8 points per game. Spellman (6-9, 255) was considered one of the best shooters among big men in the draft. He made 43 percent of his 3s last season while averaging 10.9 points as a freshman starter on Villanova\u2019s national championship team. Young worked out for the Hawks on June 12. He said the trade to Atlanta wasn\u2019t a surprise. \u201dI got a feeling past few days that would happen, that was a possibility, but you never really know until your name is called,\u201d Young said in a telephone interview. The 6-foot-2 Young scored at least 40 points in four games and tied a Division I record by recording 22 assists in a game. Young\u2019s deep 3-pointers earned him comparisons with Golden State\u2019s Stephen Curry, but Hawks general manager Travis Schlenk said he was won over by Young\u2019s floor leadership. \u201dWe love his ability to pass the ball, to make other players better with his court vision,\u201d said Schlenk, a former assistant GM with the Warriors. \u201dObviously he gets a lot of notoriety for his long-range shooting, but I think his ability to pass the ball is what we really liked about him.\u201d Schlenk\u2019s review impressed Young. \u201dIt means a lot because a lot of people in my opinion are so focused on my ability to shoot, which is a really big thing, especially in the NBA, but my ability to pass I feel is really underrated,\u201d Young said. Hawks veteran point guard Dennis Schroder\u2019s future in Atlanta is uncertain. This is not the first time the Hawks have quickly traded the No. 3 overall pick. In 2001, the Hawks made Pau Gasol the No. 3 overall pick and then traded his draft rights to the Memphis Grizzlies for Shareef Abdur-Rahim. Doncic was Atlanta\u2019s highest draft pick since 2007, when center Al Horford was the No. 3 pick. The trade for Young gives first-year coach Lloyd Pierce a new scoring weapon. \u201dObviously his ability to shoot the ball in today\u2019s NBA, the 3-point shot, is very important,\u201d Schlenk said. \u201dWhat really separates him with his shooting is his ability to shoot off the dribble. You don\u2019t see that in a lot of guys and he possesses that.\u201d The Hawks finished last in the Eastern Conference last season, when they began to rely heavily on young players. Forward-center John Collins showed promise as a rookie last season, and forward Taurean Prince is another young piece of the rebuilding effort.

Moments after the team selected Collin Sexton with the No. 8 pick in the NBA draft Thursday night, the Alabama playmaker made his appeal for LeBron James to resign with Cleveland. \u201dMan, LeBron, let\u2019s do it,\u201d Sexton said during ESPN\u2019s telecast from the draft in Brooklyn. \u201dLet\u2019s do it. I\u2019ve you needed a few extra pieces this past season, and let\u2019s do it. Let\u2019s go back to the Finals.\u201d The Cavs are hoping Sexton \u2013 and perhaps a few more tweaks to their roster \u2013 will help convinces James that there is no reason for him to leave home for the second time in his career. * GM Altman: \u2018Good dialogue\u2019 with LeBron\u2019s camp Sexton averaged 19.2 points and 3.6 assists as a freshman for the Crimson Tide, and the 19-year-old also led the school to the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2012. The confident 6-foot-3, 190-pounder is a proven scorer and he addresses a major need for the Cavs, who traded All-Star point guard Kyrie Irving to Boston last year and spent all season trying to replace him. Cleveland coach Tyronn Lue started eight different point guards during the regular season. Despite their issues at guard, James led the Cavs to their fourth straight Finals, but they sorely missed Irving and didn\u2019t have nearly enough firepower to hang with the Golden State Warriors, who swept them and won their third title in four years. Cleveland used the pick to draft Sexton \u2013 previously owned by Brooklyn \u2013 that it received from the Celtics in the Irving trade. The Cavs\u2019 front office led by general manager Koby Altman entered the draft in the dark on James\u2019 plans. The three-time champion must notify the team by June 29 on whether he intends to opt out of his $35.6 million contract for next season \u2013 a move he is expected to make. Sexton has been on Cleveland\u2019s radar for some time. The day after the Cavs lost Game 4 in the Finals, Sexton worked out at the team\u2019s facility and owner Dan Gilbert referred to him as a \u201dvery intriguing draft prospect\u201d on Twitter. While Sexton certainly improves the Cavs\u2019 backcourt and adds a young player capable of breaking down defenders, there is no guarantee it will do anything to impact what James will do. In the meantime, Sexton has his fingers crossed that he and James will soon be teammates. \u201dHe\u2019s one of the best players to ever play basketball,\u201d Sexton said. \u201dJust being able to come in and learn from him, it\u2019ll be big for me and big for my growth.\u201d James will factor family and his quest to win more championships into his decision. The 33-year-old has been unusually quiet on social media since the Finals ended and he has given no hints about his future. If James doesn\u2019t stay in Cleveland, there\u2019s a strong chance he\u2019ll look to join the Los Angeles Lakers, who have salary-cap room to sign two maximum contract players. James already owns two homes and a film production company in Southern California. Based on his wardrobe for the draft, Sexton may have had an inkling Cleveland was going to take him. He wore a crimson-and-black tuxedo jacket that perfectly complemented the wine-colored Cavs cap he was given before taking the stage to shake hands with Commissioner Adam Silver. Sexton burst on the national scene last season with several strong performances, including a 40-point game against Minnesota when Alabama had to play 10 minutes with just three players because of disqualifications. He went on to be named the SEC\u2019s top newcomer and a first-team all-conference selection. \u201dIt just shows all my hard work paid off,\u201d Sexton said. \u201dI just grinded, started from the bottom and came back up to the top. That was the biggest thing, just show people what I can do.\u201d Sexton said he had one of his better workouts with the Cavs, and that while he was in Cleveland he attended Game 4 of the Finals. The Cavs passed on a chance to take Missouri forward Michael Porter Jr., whose back issues have caused him to drop in the draft.

(AP) \u2014 The Charlotte Hornets wound up with small forward Miles Bridges from Michigan State in the first round of the NBA draft after a trade with the Los Angeles Clippers. Charlotte initially selected point guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander from Kentucky with the 11th overall pick, but promptly traded the pick to the Clippers for the 12th overall pick and two future second round picks. Full NBA Draft Coverage |  Draft Board: Picks 1-60 The Clippers then selected Bridges for the Hornets with the next pick. The 6-foot-7 Bridges was a unanimous All Big 10 first team choice after averaging 17 points and seven rebounds last season for the Spartans. Bridges ranked sixth in the Big Ten in scoring last season, 11th in rebounding and fourth in free throw percentage (85.3 percent). He potentially gives the Hornets a better offensive option at small forward than starter Kidd-Gilchrist, whose strength is on the defensive end. At 225 pounds, he has an NBA ready body and is one of the most explosive leapers in the NBA draft. He scored frequently on perimeter spot ups and off screens while with the Spartans as well as on pick and roll opportunities. The Hornets chose Bridges over Michael Porter Jr., who fell to the Denver Nuggets. Mitch Kupchak is off to a busy start as Hornets general manager. Kupchak\u2019s decision trade down comes one day after new agreeing to trade eight-time All-Star center Dwight Howard to the Brooklyn Nets for center Timofey Mozgov and two second-round draft picks, a person familiar with the situation told The Associated Press. The person spoke to the AP on Wednesday on condition of anonymity because the league cannot approve the deal until the trade moratorium ends on July 6. The 32-year-old Howard was due to make $23.8 million in the final year of his contract next season. The Hornets went 36-46 last season and have failed to make the playoffs three of the past four seasons, causing owner Michael Jordan to fire general manager Rich Cho and coach Steve Clifford. \u2014 AP Basketball Writer Tim Reynolds contributed to this report."},{"id":39860,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/dallas-mavericks-acquire-luka-doncic-atlanta-hawks-trae-young-pick","date":"2018-06-22","title":"Dallas Mavericks acquire Luka Doncic from Atlanta Hawks for Trae Young, pick","content":"DALLAS \u2014 The Dallas Mavericks announced that they have acquired the draft rights to third overall pick Luka Doncic from the Atlanta Hawks in exchange for the draft rights to fifth overall pick Trae Young and a protected 2019 first round draft pick.

Dallas moved up two spots in the NBA draft Thursday night to get Slovenian guard Luka Doncic, who was selected by Atlanta at No. 3 while the Mavericks picked former Oklahoma scoring sensation Trae Young for the Hawks at No. 5 as part of the deal. The Mavericks are also sending a lottery-protected first-round pick in 2019 to Atlanta. Full NBA Draft Coverage |  Draft Board: Picks 1-60 | Hawks get Young The Mavericks are coming off consecutive losing seasons for the first time in nearly 20 years, back when Nowitzki ended up being the centerpiece of a rebuilding project that led to 12 straight trips to the playoffs and the franchise\u2019s only championship in 2011. The big German is the highest-scoring foreign-born player in NBA history and one of seven overall with at least 30,000 points. The Mavericks acquired Nowitzki during the 1998 draft, trading down to get the 7-footer who was taken ninth overall by Milwaukee. The 19-year-old Doncic will be his teammate, with Nowitzki expected to become the first player in league history to spend all 21 seasons with the same franchise. Nowitzki, who was in the draft room with the Mavericks two nights after celebrating his 40th birthday, quickly greeted his fellow European on Twitter, and Doncic replied in kind. \u201dHe\u2019s a great leader, a great person,\u201d Doncic said of the 2007 MVP and 2011 NBA Finals MVP. \u201dI\u2019m just really happy to be part of his career. I just want to learn so much about him.\u201d Doncic arrived in New York on Wednesday after helping Spain\u2019s Real Madrid win its league championship after he won Euroleague MVP and Final Four MVP honors when they won that title this year. His lengthy European season kept him from working out for teams but he knew the Mavericks were interested. \u201dI\u2019ve been talking to Dallas a lot,\u201d Doncic said. \u201dThey were very nice to me, and I think we had a very good relationship.\u201d At 6-foot-7 and 220 pounds, Doncic averaged about 15 points, five rebounds and five assists during Real Madrid\u2019s championship season. As with Nowitzki 20 years ago, the question is how his game will translate to the NBA. \u201dThis kid has won everything there is to win in European and international basketball and he\u2019s done it at an age that\u2019s unprecedented,\u201d coach Rick Carlisle said. \u201dI\u2019m not sure what position he is. I think his position is on the floor, making plays and making people better.\u201d Doncic signed with Real Madrid at age 13 and made his debut as a 16-year-old. He teamed with Miami\u2019s Goran Dragic to lead Slovenia to a surprising gold medal at FIBA EuroBasket 2017. His father, Sasa Doncic, played professionally for 15 years. The Mavericks made the move for Doncic a year after drafting point guard Dennis Smith Jr. with the ninth overall pick, giving Dallas a chance to have one of the NBA\u2019s youngest backcourts depending on where Doncic lands in the rotation. Carlisle said he sees Doncic as a starter. \u201dHe\u2019s the kind of player that is going to be able to play with virtually anybody,\u201d Carlisle said. \u201dHe just has the skill set and an understanding and a feel for the game. He\u2019s a great shooter, so he creates space for other players, which is really going to help Dennis.\u201d The Mavericks took another guard with the 33rd overall pick in the second round, getting Jalen Brunson from two-time NCAA champion Villanova. Dallas also had the 54th overall pick in the second round. The Hawks\u2019 decision to acquire Young likely means veteran guard Dennis Schroder\u2019s future with the team could be short-lived. This is not the first time the Hawks have quickly traded the No. 3 overall pick. In 2001, the Hawks made Pau Gasol the No. 3 overall pick and then traded his draft rights to the Memphis Grizzlies for Shareef Abdur-Rahim."},{"id":39882,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/phoenix-suns-select-deandre-ayton-no-1-pick-2018-nba-draft","date":"2018-06-21","title":"Phoenix Suns select Deandre Ayton with No. 1 pick in NBA Draft","content":"NEW YORK \u2014 The Phoenix Suns stayed close to home for their first No. 1 pick. The Dallas Mavericks looked all the way to Slovenia for the player they hope can be their next European superstar. Shortly after the Suns took Deandre Ayton to start the NBA draft Thursday night, the Mavericks traded up two spots for the rights to Luka Doncic. The Atlanta Hawks swapped the rights to Doncic, the No. 3 pick who has spent the last year winning championships all over Europe, to Atlanta for Trae Young, the No. 5 selection from Oklahoma. The Mavericks also gave up a future first-round pick to draft Doncic, who only arrived in New York on Wednesday after helping Spain\u2019s Real Madrid win its league championship after he won Euroleague MVP and Final Four MVP honors when they won that title this year. His lengthy European season kept him from working out for teams but he knew the Mavericks were interested in having him on their team for what\u2019s expected to be Dirk Nowitzki\u2019s final NBA season. \u2022 NBA Draft Coverage | Draft Board | Trade Tracker \u201cI\u2019ve been talking to Dallas a lot. They really wanted me, and they were very, very nice,\u201d the 19-year-old said. \u201cThey were very nice to me, and I think we had a very good relationship.\u201d The Hawks will get perhaps the most exciting player in college basketball last season in Young, the first player to lead the nation in scoring and assists in the same season. \u201cWhatever city I went to, I was going to be able to be comfortable in,\u201d said Young, who wore suit shorts with his burgundy-colored jacket. \u201cI was just really excited to get to Atlanta.\u201d After that, it was a mostly straightforward draft with little fireworks, but plenty of national champion Villanova Wildcats. The top of it was dominated by big men, starting with a pair of former high school teammates. The Suns made the 7-foot-1 Ayton the first No. 1 pick in franchise history. The center from Arizona averaged 20.1 points and 11.6 rebounds in his lone season in Tucson, tying for the national lead with 24 double-doubles in 35 games. He joined Mychal Thompson \u2014 father of Golden State All-Star Klay Thompson \u2014 in 1978 as the only players from the Bahamas to be the No. 1 pick in the NBA draft. \u201cHaving my name called to be the first pick for the Phoenix Suns was mind-blowing,\u201d Ayton said. \u201cHaving all that confidence and leading up to that point when I saw Adam Silver came out, I was just waiting for my name, and when he called it, my mind went blank.\u201d The Sacramento Kings followed by taking Marvin Bagley III, the Duke big man who played with Ayton at Hillcrest Prep Academy in Phoenix in 2015-16. With Michigan State\u2019s Jaren Jackson Jr. going fourth to Memphis, Texas center Mo Bamba going No. 6 to Orlando and Wendell Carter Jr. following to Chicago, it was an early run of big men in what\u2019s increasingly become a perimeter-based league. Then it was another guard with Alabama\u2019s Collin Sexton going at No. 8 to Cleveland, triggering chants of Michael Porter Jr.\u2019s name by Knicks fans who hoped they would take him with the No. 9 pick. But they ended up disappointed as New York went with Kentucky\u2019s Kevin Knox. \u201cThey booed [Kristaps] Porzingis [on draft night] and look where he is now. That\u2019s the same mindset I\u2019m going to have,\u201d Knox said. \u201cThey can chant Michael Porter all they want. But they got Kevin Knox, and I\u2019m willing to work and I\u2019m willing to get better.\u201d With concerns over back problems that limited him to only three games at Missouri last season, followed by a recent hip injury that he believe scared off teams, Porter ended up falling all the way to Denver at No. 14, the last lottery position. There were a couple other trades involving lottery picks. Mikal Bridges, the No. 10 pick from Villanova who thought he was staying in Philadelphia with the 76ers \u2014 who employ his mother \u2014 but was dealt to Phoenix for the rights to No. 16 pick Zhaire Smith of Texas Tech and a 2012 first-round pick from the Miami Heat. The Charlotte Hornets sent the rights to No. 11 pick Shai Gilgeous-Alexander \u2014 whose floral-patterned suit stood out among the selections \u2014 to the Clippers for No. 12 pick Miles Bridges and two future second-round picks. After Bridges, Final Four Most Outstanding Player Donte DiVincenzo went to Milwaukee at No. 17 and Omari Spellman to Atlanta at No. 30, giving Villanova three first-round picks for the first time. National player of the year Jalen Brunson then was picked by Dallas with the third pick of the second round. The Holiday brothers had an NBA reunion when Aaron Holiday was taken at No. 23 by Indiana. Brothers Jrue and Justin already play in the league. Speaking of brothers, Kostas Antetokounmpo of Dayton, brother of Bucks All-Star Giannis Antetokounmpo, was the 60th and final pick by Philadelphia. That marked the first time three international siblings were drafted into the NBA, as Thanasis Antetokounmpo was the No. 51 pick in 2014."},{"id":39858,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/los-angeles-lakers-contact-san-antonio-spurs-about-kawhi-leonard","date":"2018-06-21","title":"Report: Lakers rebuffed in talks with Spurs about Kawhi Leonard","content":" The Lakers reached out to the Spurs recently to gauge the possibility of acquiring Kawhi Leonard in a trade, but immediately felt San Antonio had no intention of engaging in any dialogue, according to ESPN\u2019s Ramona Shelburne .

According to ESPN\u2019s Chris Haynes and Yahoo Sports\u2019 Shams Charania, the Brooklyn Nets and Howard are expected to finalize a buyout agreement that will put Howard into the free-agent pool for 2018. Here\u2019s what Charania reports : On Wednesday, the Charlotte Hornets reportedly agreed to trade Howard to the Nets two future second-round picks, cash and center Timofey Mozgov. In an interview with ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski on Thursday, Howard said he is looking for a new opportunity and a chance to win again in the NBA : A year ago yesterday, the Atlanta Hawks traded Howard to the Hornets for Miles Plumlee, Marco Belinelli and a swap of second-round picks \u2014 a trade that took place two days before the 2017 Draft . The trade the teams agreed to yesterday happened one day before the 2018 Draft. Wednesday\u2019s move allowed the Hornets to unload Howard\u2019s contract and save about $7 million under this year\u2019s salary cap, it is a bit of a gamble because Mozgov has two years remaining on his current contract at $16 million per year. The Nets landed Mozgov last summer as a part of their trade for the Los Angeles\u2019 Lakers D\u2019Angelo Russell . In that deal, the Lakers sent Mozgov to Brooklyn for Brook Lopez and the rights to rookie Kyle Kuzma. Howard\u2019s most impressive game of the 2017-18 season came on March 21 (ironically enough, vs. Brooklyn), when he finished with 32 points and a career-high 30 rebounds in a comeback win against the Nets. Last season, he ranked third in the NBA in rebounds per game (12.5), fourth in double-doubles (53), ninth in blocks (1.6) and 11th in field-goal percentage (55.5 percent). However, Howard struggled to mesh with Charlotte\u2019s guards, and the Hornets failed to make the playoffs despite what former coach Steve Clifford considered the team\u2019s most talented roster in half a decade. Atlanta Hawks guard Kent Bazemore told Wojnarowski that he enjoyed playing with Howard during the 2016-17 season in Atlanta. After spending the first eight seasons of his career in Orlando, Howard has played for the Los Angeles Lakers (2012-13), the Houston Rockets (2013-16), the Hawks (2016-17) and the Hornets (2017-18) since then. In the 2011-12 season, reports surfaced that Howard sought a trade to the Nets to play alongside All-Star Deron Williams and the rest of Brooklyn\u2019s then-youthful crew. But that deal never materialized.

In fact, on the very day that the top prospects for the 2018 Draft were made available to the media \u2014 a talent pool particularly long on length this year \u2014 Howard was on the move again, in a reported deal from the Charlotte Hornets to the Brooklyn Nets that will land the eight-time All-Star with his fourth team in four seasons. That bit of news \u2014 of an old-school NBA big man being shuffled off again into what looks to be basketball irrelevancy \u2014 served as a counterpoint to the young giants just starting out. There will be plenty of guards and forwards selected in the first round Thursday at Barclays Center in Brooklyn, including Michael Porter Jr. , Trae Young , Collin Sexton , Shai Gilgeous-Alexander , Mikal Bridges , Kevin Knox and Lonnie Walker . But the lottery will be top-heavy with big men, with Deandre Ayton , Marvin Bagley III , Mo Bamba , Jaren Jackson Jr. , Wendell Carter Jr. , and Robert Williams all hearing their names called. All six are listed at 6-foot-10 or taller, though they\u2019ll bear little resemblance in style or production to the Hall of Famers cited above or even to Howard. The last time last time six players that size were drafted in the top 10 was 2007 , when Greg Oden, Al Horford, Yi Jianlian, Brandan Wright, Joakim Noah and Spencer Hawes all went early. Much has changed in 11 years. These young guys represent basketball\u2019s new-age pivot men \u2026 which means we\u2019d better drop the \u201cpivot men\u201d nomenclature. Rather, the word that got tossed around most often Wednesday during conversations about these guys\u2019 fit \u2013 with specific teams and in the league generally \u2013 was modern. Modern centers for a modern NBA. \u201cModern-day 5,\u201d is how Bamba put it. \u201cDefend multiple positions, can shoot it, handle it a little. Can do a little bit of everything.\u201d Said Jaren Jackson, Jr.: \u201cAt times, I\u2019ve heard that I\u2019m right on time for the way the game is going. A lot of bigs can handle the ball and be versatile and they\u2019re able to make plays.\u201d If you want to feel old, consider the NBA\u2019s prevailing definition of \u201cmodern.\u201d Major League Baseball\u2019s \u201cmodern era\u201d historically is thought to have begun in the year 1900. The NBA\u2019s modern era dates back to about a week ago last Tuesday. That\u2019s how quickly the view about centers has changed. After ruling the NBA landscape for most of the league\u2019s first 50 years, traditional big men looked at now as dinosaurs, both in form and function. Plodding isn\u2019t allowed. Posting up, back to the basket, and backing into the paint seems as dated in this league as helmetless players in the NHL. There have been noticeable markers along the way. In the \u201890s, players who naturally would have been trained and used as centers \u2013 Tim Duncan, Kevin Garnett, Rasheed Wallace, Amare Stoudemire, Antonio McDyess \u2013 demanded to face the basket and be referred to as power forwards. Then in 2012, the league joined them, eradicating \u201ccenter\u201d from its All-Star ballot and opting for \u201cfrontcourt\u201d as a catch-all category for everyone from wings to 7-foot shot swatters. This latest era dates back just a few years, if you go by a few key analytics. A recent ESPN.com story tracked the minutes played by 7-footers in the playoffs, compared to the regular season, and identified the tipping point as the 2016 postseason. Even if you back it up by a year to include Golden State\u2019s heavy use of small ball in winning its championship in 2015, that\u2019s still barely more than a heartbeat. But the full embrace of the 3-point shot and the type of pace favored by a majority of current NBA coaches has put a premium on centers who are mobile, can switch defensively, challenge perimeter shooters, do some of that shooting of their own and still crash the boards and protect the rim. The next Shaq or Kareem? Now the model is the Houston Rockets\u2019 Clint Capela, the Boston Celtics\u2019 Al Horford or the Minnesota Timberwolves\u2019 Karl-Anthony Towns. Big guys such as DeMarcus Cousins and Anthony Davis have added range to their shots. Some \u2013 Andre Drummond, Jonas Valanciunas, a few more \u2013 have status or contracts that assure them of minutes. Other old-style bigs are either out of the league (Roy Hibbert, Andrew Bogut) or logging long stretches on the bench (Greg Monroe, Al Jefferson, Hassan Whiteside). Just two years ago, Jahlil Okafor was the No. 3 pick in the 2016 Draft . These days, he\u2019s an afterthought with little market value. So the challenge for a fellow such as Ayton, projected to be the near-consensus No. 1 pick this year , is to make sure no one confuses him or his game with DeAndre Jordan. Asked about the trend Wednesday, Ayton at one point sounded a little defiant. \u201cI\u2019m not changing my way of play in the NBA,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cI\u2019m still an inside-out type of player. I\u2019m going to start inside and establish myself down low until I have to stretch the floor.\u201d It helps, of course, to have that option. Ayton already is built like an NBA veteran, but he has sufficient quickness to cover ground defensively and to keep up with a faster offensive pace. And for those who haven\u2019t been paying attention to him since the NCAA season ended, Ayton has a surprise: a more reliable 3-pointer he\u2019s willing to unleash. \u201cThe NBA 3-ball is way farther than the college 3-ball,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve really put on some range and put on some muscle. When I\u2019m fatigued in games, I really can [still] get my shot off in a perfect arc.\u201d Bagley, depending where he lands, might end up playing more out on the floor than the other bigs in this draft. That\u2019s his experience, having had Carter Jr. next to him at Duke to handle the basics. Williams will likely benefit from shifting in the opposite direction. He played a lot at power forward for Texas A&M but is rated highly for how his game translates to, you guessed it, modern center play. Bamba has drawn comparisons to Philadelphia 76ers star Joel Embiid, as much for his charisma as for any play similarities. He allegedly has overhauled his shot this spring, and also was eager to tout his 3-point range Wednesday. Then there is Jackson, who has been rated as the best two-way player of the bunch. That includes not just his defense against fellow bigs but his ability to guard nearly any position. Jackson seemed to speak for all the future big men in New York Wednesday. Unlike a previous generation of centers \u2014 many of whom got caught in the NBA\u2019s transition to a smaller, faster, position-less style \u2014 these Jackson Jr. and the rest grew up watching it. And preparing for it. Nothing frustrating about it, Jackson said, though it\u2019s a far cry from the league in which his father, Jaren Sr., (1989-2002) played . \u201cNo. Whatever helps each team do their best is what lineup they\u2019re going to put out,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to put the best players on the floor every time. You look at a team like the Warriors, they switch everything. They can play all different positions. That\u2019s what they\u2019re good at.\u201d That\u2019s what these guys, given their size, are remarkably good at too. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

The Pistons introduced Casey as their new coach Wednesday, over a week after hiring him to replace Stan Van Gundy. Casey inherits a team built around Blake Griffin, Andre Drummond and Reggie Jackson, but the roster has little flexibility and the team gave up its first-round draft pick this year to acquire Griffin. In other words, Detroit\u2019s performance in 2018-19 may depend largely on what Casey can get out of a group that fell short under Van Gundy. \u201dI\u2019m telling the guys now: We\u2019re not developing, we\u2019re not two or three years away,\u201d Casey said. \u201dWe want to win right now.\u201d Casey took the Detroit job after being fired by the Toronto Raptors. He\u2019s a finalist for NBA coach of the year after leading the Raptors to a team-record 59 wins this past season, but he lost his job after Toronto was swept in the playoffs by Cleveland. \u201dI can hold my head high for what we built in Toronto,\u201d Casey said. \u201dThat\u2019s part of the journey. This is a new chapter.\u201d The Pistons made the playoffs only once in four seasons under Van Gundy, who was also president of basketball operations. Detroit hired Casey to replace Van Gundy as coach, but it\u2019s still unclear what the front office will look like going forward. Ed Stefanski was brought in as a senior executive reporting to owner Tom Gores. His job was to help with both the coaching search and the effort to reshape the team\u2019s basketball operations. \u201dWe\u2019re going through a process here. We\u2019re thinking about, do we want to go a GM route? Do we want to get some younger guys in there and I can mentor them kind of thing? It\u2019s fluid,\u201d Stefanski said. \u201dI\u2019m going to be very influential in the front office.\u201d The Pistons went 39-43 last season. They got off to a promising start before Jackson, their point guard, went down with an injury in late December. About a month later, Detroit acquired Griffin in a blockbuster trade, giving up the first-round pick and taking on the star forward\u2019s big contract. That wasn\u2019t enough to push the team into the postseason, and it seems unlikely the Pistons will be able to make any major changes to their roster in the short term. \u201dI don\u2019t see us making a huge deal right now,\u201d Stefanski said. If the personnel stays mostly the same, the Pistons will have to hope for better health \u2013 and Casey will have to look for areas for improvement. The Pistons were fifth in the league in 3-point percentage last season, but they were only 16th in attempts from beyond the arc. \u201dWe have to get up more 3s. We\u2019ve got to play more of an analytical game,\u201d Casey said. \u201dTom teases me all the time about being a modern man. No, it\u2019s about wanting to win, more than anything else, and you have to adapt.\u201d"},{"id":39883,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nba-london-game-2019-official-release","date":"2018-06-20","title":"NBA London Game 2019 to feature regular season game between Washington Wizards and New York Knicks","content":"LONDON \u2014 The National Basketball Association (NBA) and Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG) announced today that the NBA London Game 2019 will feature a regular-season game between the Washington Wizards and the New York Knicks at The O2 on Thursday, Jan. 17 .

The news was also confirmed by Rick Bonnell of the Charlotte Observer . In the deal, the Nets will send two future second-round picks, cash and center Timofey Mozgov to the Hornets for Howard. Here\u2019s Charania on the deal itself ( via Twitter ): And here\u2019s more from Wojnarowski on the particulars of the trade : One year ago today, the Atlanta Hawks traded Howard to the Hornets for Miles Plumlee, Marco Belinelli and a swap of second-round picks \u2014 a trade that took place two days before the 2017 Draft . This time around, he is reportedly being traded one day before the 2018 Draft. While the move allows the Hornets to unload Howard\u2019s contract and save about $7 million under this year\u2019s salary cap, it is a bit of a gamble because Mozgov has two years remaining on his current contract at $16 million per year. The Nets landed Mozgov last summer as a part of their trade for the Los Angeles\u2019 Lakers D\u2019Angelo Russell . In that deal, the Lakers sent Mozgov to Brooklyn for Brook Lopez and the rights to rookie Kyle Kuzma. Howard\u2019s most impressive game of the 2017-18 season came on March 21 (ironically enough, vs. Brooklyn), when he finished with 32 points and a career-high 30 rebounds in a comeback win against the Nets. Last season, he ranked third in the NBA in rebounds per game (12.5), fourth in double-doubles (53), ninth in blocks (1.6) and 11th in field-goal percentage (55.5 percent). However, Howard struggled to mesh with Charlotte\u2019s guards, and the Hornets failed to make the playoffs despite what former coach Steve Clifford considered the team\u2019s most talented roster in half a decade. Mozgov appeared in 31 games last season, averaging 4.2 ppg, 3.2 rpg while shooting 55.9 percent in 31 games. He has not played a full 82-game season since 2013 and has averaged in double figures only once during his eight-year NBA career. (By contrast, Howard has averaged 17.4 points, 12.7 rebound and two blocks per game since joining the league in 2004.) The Lakers signed the veteran Mozgov in the summer of 2016, but he struggled to fit him into their system in the 2016-17 season, leading to his trade to Brooklyn. This is a reunion of sorts for Mozgov as Kupchak signed Mozgov to a four-year, $64 million deal in 2016 when both were with the Lakers. Kupchak was GM of the Lakers when L.A. acquired Howard in a then-blockbuster trade with the Orlando Magic before the 2012-13 season. After spending the first eight seasons of his career in Orlando, Howard has played for the Lakers (2012-13), the Houston Rockets (2013-16), the Hawks (2016-17) and the Hornets (2017-18) with the Nets up next. In the 2011-12 season, reports surfaced that Howard sought a trade to the Nets to play alongside All-Star Deron Williams and the rest of Brooklyn\u2019s then-youthful crew. But that deal never materialized. Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":39914,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-atlanta-hawks-leaning-toward-luka-doncic-third-pick","date":"2018-06-20","title":"Report: Atlanta Hawks leaning toward Luka Doncic with third pick","content":"The Atlanta Hawks are leaning toward Slovenian teen sensation Luka Doncic with the third pick in Thursday\u2019s draft , according to ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski and DraftExpress.com\u2019s Jonathan Givony. Here\u2019s more from Wojnarowski on the Hawks\u2019 interest in Doncic, who many Draft experts believe is the best playmaker in the 2018 Draft : Atlanta has three first-round picks: Nos. 3, 19 and 30. Per Wojnarowski, league sources say the 19th and 30th picks have been included in talks to move up and select another player in the lottery. Additionally, here\u2019s what Givony reports via Twitter as well about Atlanta\u2019s interest in Doncic \u2026 Doncic\u2019s stock had seemingly dropped slightly during the pre-Draft process despite one of the most impressive individual seasons in recent European seasons with Spanish power Real Madrid. At just 19, the 6-foot-7 combo guard became the youngest player to win the Liga ACB MVP, the EuroLeague MVP and the EuroLeague Final Four MVP. He also won the EuroLeague Rising Star and Liga ACB Best Young Player awards for the second straight season. In doing so he averaged 14.5 points, 5.2 rebounds, 4.6 assists in 25 minutes over 61 total games. Not a great shooter or defender, Doncic stands out most for his impressive playmaking skills. As an NBA scout told NBA.com\u2019s David Aldridge: \u201cIf they use him the right way, it\u2019s going to be real hard for him to fail. You put him in a ball screen, middle of the floor, with a good roller, it\u2019s a really tough cover. Just the consensus I get is that people really like Doncic.

Despite being cleared to return by the Spurs \u2014 notoriously cautious with injuries \u2014 Leonard continued to rehab and seek outside opinions. The saga reached its apex last week as multiple outlets reported that Leonard had indicated to the Spurs that he prefers to be traded rather than continue playing for the team that traded for him during the 2011 Draft and hoped to build around him in the wake of Tim Duncan\u2019s retirement in 2016. Leonard, a two-time All-Star and two-time Kia Defensive Player of the Year, averaged 16.2 points in those nine appearances as the Spurs failed to win 50 or more games for the first time since the abbreviated 1998-99 season. It was a disappointing follow-up to his career season in 2016-17, in which he averaged 25.5 points to establish himself as arguably the best two-way player in the NBA. Leonard is under contract for two more seasons but can exercise a player option to become an unrestricted free agent next summer.

Brown\u2019s attorney Mark Thomsen filed the lawsuit in federal court. Brown had been talking with officers while waiting for a citation for illegally parking in a disabled spot outside a Walgreens on Jan. 26, when officers took him down because he didn\u2019t immediately remove his hands from his pockets as ordered. Police Chief Alfonso Morales apologized to Brown last month when body-camera video of the arrest was released. Brown wasn\u2019t charged with anything and three officers were disciplined, with suspensions ranging from two to 15 days. Eight other officers were ordered to undergo remedial training in professional communications. Video of the confrontation shows an officer approached Brown around 2 a.m. When their conversation becomes tense, the officer calls more squad cars for help and eventually eight officers are standing around Brown. One asks him to take his hands out of his pockets and a second or two later the scuffle begins. Almost immediately, an officer yells: \u201cTaser! Taser! Taser!\u201d According to the lawsuit, one of the officers later took to Twitter to mock Brown, saying, \u201cNice meeting Sterling Brown of the Milwaukee Bucks at work this morning! Lol(hash)FearTheDeer Police only released the body camera video of the first officer who contacted Brown. But additional body camera and squad car videos, obtained by WISN-TV, showed the moments after officers used a stun gun on Brown. In one, Brown is on the ground and handcuffed when an officer puts one of his boots on Brown\u2019s ankle, holding it there. Brown doesn\u2019t mention being in any discomfort but he questions the officer\u2019s actions. \u201cC\u2019mon man, you\u2019re stepping on my ankle for what?\u201d Brown said. In response, the officer said he was trying to prevent Brown from kicking anyone. Other videos obtained by WISN-TV showed an officer talking with two colleagues seating in a squad car.

At least not directly. With the trajectory of their franchise riding on where he decides to play next season and beyond, the Cleveland Cavaliers will enter this year\u2019s draft not knowing if they\u2019re choosing a player to help them \u2014 and James \u2014 contend for another championship, develop a prospect for the future or potentially take a player to trade. It\u2019s a guessing game. James has until June 29 to exercise his $35.6 million contract option for next season or decline it and become an unrestricted free agent, officially making him the planet\u2019s best and most coveted player. The 33-year-old is not expected to reveal his intentions until after the draft. By that time, the Cavs, still stinging from a Finals sweep at the hands of the Golden State Warriors, hope to have chosen a player that makes them more appealing to the three-time champion, who is mulling whether to leave them \u2014 and his Northeast Ohio home \u2014 for the second time in his career. Anything seems possible at this point. James and his representatives have kept an air-tight lid on their plans. The Cavs, too, have been secretive while general manager Koby Altman prepares for his first draft by consulting with his staff on what to do with the No. 8 overall pick, the one they received last summer in the seismic trade that sent All-Star point guard Kyrie Irving to the Boston Celtics. It\u2019s quite a quandary for Cleveland, and James isn\u2019t helping the Cavs by keeping them in suspense. It\u2019s also possible that James hasn\u2019t made up his mind. Following Game 4 in the Finals, James said he\u2019ll factor in his family\u2019s well-being along with his thirst to win more titles into a decision that once again has Cleveland edgy. \u201cI still want to be in championship mode,\u201d he said. \u201cI think I\u2019ve shown this year why I will still continue to be in championship mode.\u201d And while there are numerous unknowns, there is one indisputable fact: the Cavs must upgrade their roster to have any chance of keeping James and continuing a relationship that was resurrected in 2014. After yielding to Irving\u2019s request and trading him, the Cavs spent all last season trying to replace him. They never came close, and without a dependable second scoring option or a guard, James was forced to shoulder a heavier load than ever. He succeeded in getting to his eighth straight Finals, but was then overmatched by the deeper Warriors. To remain viable contenders and keep James happy and healthy, the Cavs must address their backcourt issue this summer, either in the draft, through free agency or a trade. With this year\u2019s draft top loaded with quality big men, there\u2019s a strong possibility the Cavs will have their pick of one of the elite guards, perhaps Oklahoma\u2019s Trae Young or Alabama\u2019s Collin Sexton \u2014 two players James has praised in the past. Young was college basketball\u2019s most electrifying player last season, averaging 27.4 points and 8.7 assists even while teams designed defenses specifically to stop him. James kept an eye on the 6-foot-2 scoring phenom from afar and is intrigued by not only his ability to break down teams but his unselfishness. Young could be gone by the time the Cavs are on the clock, but Sexton would be a nice backup plan. The 6-foot-3 guard averaged 19.2 points and 3.6 assists as a freshman and showed he\u2019s got a big-game gene, carrying the Crimson Tide on a run in the SEC tournament that secured the school\u2019s first NCAA berth since 2012. Sexton worked out for the Cavs at their training facility and owner Dan Gilbert referred to the 19-year-old as \u201ca very interesting draft prospect\u201d on Twitter. There\u2019s also a chance that Cleveland could select a guard to use to entice a major trade. The Cavs have long been interested in Charlotte\u2019s Kemba Walker, who will be a free agent after next season, and landing a player of that caliber would send a resounding message to James that they intend to keep chasing championships. Walker might not be enough to keep James here, but he would give the Cavs a new star to build around. James has remained off social media since the playoffs began in April, and his self-imposed blackout has continued since the Finals ended. He\u2019s been quiet, but there\u2019s no doubt he\u2019s watching. Every move.

Jimmy Butler was traded to Minnesota, taking with him any pretense that the Bulls were a legitimate playoff team. In that moment, Chicago committed to a rebuild, which is to say, a dive into the draft lottery where coach Fred Hoiberg and his team presumably would be rewarded not for how many games they won but how many they lost. By whatever means necessary. Soon after Butler was moved to the Timberwolves, veteran point guard Rajon Rondo was waived. A few months later, Dwyane Wade was cut loose (via a handsome buyout) to bounce through Cleveland to Miami. The Bulls moved forward with three young pieces courtesy of the Wolves \u2014 wing Zach LaVine, guard Kris Dunn and the No. 7 pick in 2017, rookie forward Lauri Markkanen \u2014 and a general acceptance that getting from there to here was going to bring a lot of pain. Some of that was literal: Bobby Portis slugged teammate Nikola Mirotic in a preseason practice, breaking two facial bones and putting Mirotic on the shelf for 23 games. Some of it was figurative: the frustration of a season that began as a 3-20 mess and ended in a 10-28 slog. In between, though, the Bulls somehow put together a 14-7 stretch that offered a glimpse of what 2018-19 might be. It also cost them precious lottery balls, eventually leaving them with the No. 7 pick (and No. 22, after dealing Mirotic in February to New Orleans) in Thursday\u2019s Draft. Hoiberg, who went from an alleged coaching \u201chot seat\u201d during two .500 seasons, wound up with more job security as a coach headed toward 50 defeats and beyond. He spoke with NBA.com about his and the Bulls\u2019, er, challenging season. This is edited from a pair of longer conversations, one at the end of the regular season, the other within the past week. NBA.com: So you go through everything that was 2017-18, dutifully lose 55 games and wind up at No. 7 instead of in the top three for the Draft. The inevitable question is, was it worth it? Fred Hoiberg: Obviously you\u2019re disappointed. You were hoping to move up. But we\u2019re confident we\u2019re going to get a good player with the No. 7 pick and we\u2019re confident we\u2019ll get a good player with the 22nd pick. NBA.com: C\u2019mon, this isn\u2019t our first rodeo. I get that people don\u2019t like to use the word \u201ctanking,\u201d but the Bulls\u2019 marching orders last season were pretty clear.  FH: I don\u2019t think you can look at it that way in the midst of your season. The players are competitive, your staff is competitive. You want to play as well as you can and put yourself in a position to win. When you look at the successful stretch that we had in December and January, you think about carrying those things forward and then adding, based on who we get, to the roster. There was some real frustration that we didn\u2019t get a lot of wins at the end. But we developed some younger players and saw what we had with some of our guys. NBA.com: When you guys had that run before the season\u2019s midpoint, winning seven in a row (first team in NBA history with such a long winning streak immediately after a losing streak of 10 in a row) and 10 of 12, did you and the front office ever consider a Plan B? As in, maybe, show potential free agents how good your supporting cast could be, in hopes of luring big-name help this summer? FH: I think we did. What we showed was a really good foundation and a young core that we can build around. When I look back at it, I just wish we could have had more opportunity to work with it and see what it would have looked like. When Zach LaVine came back [Jan. 13 from ACL knee surgery], the plan was for him to play about 20 minutes a night. Then his third game, Kris Dunn fell against Golden State and had that concussion [that cost him 11 games, before missing the final 14 with a toe injury]. It\u2019s too bad we didn\u2019t get the full look. But players like Cam Payne, Denzel [Valentine], Bobby, Robin [Lopez], Justin Holiday all had career years.  NBA.com: You had a lot of injuries down the stretch. Not to suggest that they weren\u2019t all legit, but were you instructed at any point by VP John Paxson or GM Gar Forman to dial it back after that 14-7 success? FH: No, we weren\u2019t. And the big thing from the very beginning of last season, the two things we wanted to see, was competing at a high level every night and the development of our players. I think we accomplished that. NBA.com: What \u2014 in your background as a player, coach, competitor, you name it \u2014 prepared you for this past season? FH: Part of what prepared me for this was, I had been through this as a player. I went from four really competitive teams in Indiana, playing with someone as driven and helpful as Reggie Miller, taking me under his wing. There were other great veteran players who helped me just to survive and taught me a lot. Larry Brown was the coach, then Larry Bird my last two years.  Then when I came to Chicago, I knew it would be an opportunity to play. But it was a rebuild. Eventually I got thrust into the role of captain, as the oldest player on team at 28. It really helped me with what we\u2019re going through now. I learned how important it is to keep guys\u2019 morale up and be positive through the ups and downs. I give our guys all the credit in the world for remaining so positive, keeping up a great work ethic and still being sponges in wanting to learn. NBA.com: What were the takeaways from the best and healthiest part of last season? FH: W e got a pretty good feel for what Kris Dunn can be. He really evolved into being a closer for our team. Lauri was closing games for us, taking big shots as a 20-year-old kid. Zach had the game against Minnesota. What people fail to remember about Zach, he averaged over 22 points a game in February and really got into a pretty good rhythm. Then he had some knee soreness and wound up sitting for the rest of the year. But we had some flashes of what this can turn into. NBA.com: Niko paid for his role in sparking that hot streak. FH: Niko was great. He missed those first 23, and I thought our team handled that adverse situation about as well as anybody could, not letting it affect us in a negative way. We were able to move past it. You even saw the chemistry that Niko and Bobby played with when they were out there together. NBA.com: How hard was it personally downshifting from a team that had gone to the playoffs to one that didn\u2019t put a priority on winning? FH: When the move was made on draft night, when those three kids came in, right away there was an excitement. Everyone had seen what Zach had done. He was a highlight reel and had those slam dunk championships. He plays the game with ease on the offensive end. His athletic tools and ability to get up and down the floor. Kris, everybody absolutely loved coming out of the draft [in 2016]. Then he had an up-and-down rookie season. Helping him to get that swagger back that he had coming out of Providence took some work, but he was aching to put that work in. Markkanen, I know the guys upstairs knew how good he was but I had no idea. I didn\u2019t study him because we had the 15th pick. He comes over after a grueling summer \u2014 summer league, Eurobasket with all that pressure in front of his home fans \u2014 and he was exhausted. But then you saw every day, \u201cMan, this kid is really good.\u201d You\u2019re thinking, we could probably put the ball in this kid\u2019s hands. Then he goes up and dunks over a whole team and you say, \u201cMy God, this kid\u2019s more athletic than we thought. He uses his feet, he\u2019s got anticipation, he\u2019s got toughness.\u201d He showed a little more every day. NBA.com: Was it difficult asking a proud veteran like Robin Lopez to put it in idle over the final 25 games? FH: I think he understood. He\u2019s been a part of a lot of different situations. He was great. He continued to lead. He continued to practice hard. He talked to the bigs as they came off the floor. NBA.com: Was your own health challenged at all by the stress of this season? Your past issues related to your heart are widely known, and coaching an NBA team even in the best of times is a demanding job. FH: After two open-heart surgeries, I do have to sometimes check myself. There are so many things you can over-concern yourself with in this business. Then you look back a week or two later and say, \u201cMy God, why did I put so much effort into that one stupid thing that happened?\u201d You have to let go sometimes. My family is so important for me with that. You get some normalcy in your life. [At night, lying in bed, Hoiberg can hear a valve in his heart every time it beats. He let a visitor listen, too, and sure enough\u2026 ] If this ever affected me to the point where I had to throttle back, I would move on to something else. When I had my first surgery and they removed the diseased tissue from the aorta that had an aneurysm in it, they got rid of the problem. The valve deteriorated after they put a new valve in and they had to go in again, but the diseased tissue no longer was there. If it was a risk, I\u2019d be doing something else. But it\u2019s a constant reminder. You think you\u2019re going to get used to it, but you never really do. My wife will be lying next to me and she hears it. NBA.com: When you look back on 2017-18, is it like \u201cCasablanca\u201d for you guys? As in, you\u2019ll always have December? FH: It was fun to see how much the work paid off. Everyone was putting so much into it to get out of that slump. You can say, we had something to build on there. But whenever I talked to our team, before or after, it was all about competing on a nightly basis. Being consistent with their effort. I couldn\u2019t be more proud of how they handled it. They were on time. They kept trying to get better. They worried about what they could control. I didn\u2019t have to have even one of those conversations where I sat a guy down and said, \u201cYou\u2019re not playing hard enough.\u201d I did have a few conversations where I said, \u201cYou need to move the ball more.\u201d [laughs] NBA.com: Big difference, coaching relative kids after the so-called \u201cthree alphas\u201d of Butler, Wade and Rondo? Jimmy seemed eager to stay here to win. FH: Jimmy did so many things for this team. He was great to coach. You knew every night you were going to get an unbelievable effort. A guy who never backed down. Who never shied away from the big shot. And was going to defend at a high level every time he stepped on the floor. So Jimmy was missed in a lot of ways. But when you look at the young guys\u2019 abilities, it\u2019s exciting. NBA.com: What do you make of having better job security now that the losses are mounting, compared to those .500 seasons? FH: I don\u2019t think any one of the 30 guys in our position pay attention to that. You can\u2019t do your job if you do. You go in and try to improve as an individual, as a staff, as a team. Our first year, Derrick Rose suffered an orbital fracture in the first workout. We had 10 rotation players who missed double-digit games. Two starters missed 50 or more [Mike Dunleavy, Joakim Noah]. Niko had that botched appendix surgery. The next year was a completely different team. Nobody predicted we\u2019d be a playoff team but we were and had a good chance to beat Boston before Rondo got hurt. NBA.com: When you\u2019re not coaching veterans, is it a purer form, as far as installing \u201cyour\u201d system vs. tailoring things to them? FH: You always look for the best system, the best approach. The basics don\u2019t change, but [in 2016-17] we had a lot more isolation players, so we ran more of those types of actions. This [past] year, more ball movement, player movement fit this group better. We had longer, harder practices as opposed to a veteran group as the year went on. NBA.com: Since the end of the season, how much time have you put in on developmental activities and draft preparation? FH: We\u2019ve had a lot of guys in and gotten a lot of work in, in the early part of the offseason. We\u2019re looking forward to working again after the draft with some new young players as part of the roster. It\u2019s all about moving forward. NBA.com: As you look back over the past year, with the script flipping to the point where the Bulls wanted to win by losing and maybe lost \u2014 some draft position, anyway \u2014 by winning, what goes through your mind? FH: What was Donovan Mitchell [the Rookie of the Year finalist chosen by Utah]? The 13th pick? You just never know with the draft. You play hard, you get the culture established the way you want it and things take care of themselves. What really would have been devastating would have been ending the season with negativity, with your team not playing hard, with your team disinterested. That\u2019s something that would be a real cause for concern going into an offseason. But our guys felt good about themselves. Some were sacrificing in a big way and pulling for younger guys. They were playing hard, they were cheering for each other. Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980. You can e-mail him  here , find  his archive here  and  follow him on Twitter .

The indictment followed an investigation of Mehmet Kanter, and prosecutors planned to seek his conviction and a prison term of five to 10 years at trial, Anadolu Agency said. It\u2019s unclear when the trial in western Tekirdag province would begin. Enes Kanter, who plays for the New York Knicks, is a follower of a U.S.-based Turkish cleric who the government accuses of masterminding a failed military coup in 2016. Cleric Fethullah Gulen has denied the allegation, but tens of thousands of people suspected of ties to his network have been arrested or fired. The elder Kanter, a professor, was purged from public service after the coup attempt and detained for five days last summer. Anadolu said the indictment alleges he contacted some 120 suspects with alleged links to Gulen, including dozens who were said to have communicated through an encrypted messaging application. Enes Kanter, a center for the New York Knicks, has been a vocal critic of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. His Turkish passport was canceled last year. Prosecutors charged him in December with insulting the president in a series of tweets. They want to try him in absentia and have him sentenced to more than four years in prison, if he is convicted. \u201cKeep my family, innocent people in your prayers,\u201d the basketball player tweeted Monday with the hashtag \u201cDictatorErdogan.\u201d His Twitter account is withheld in Turkey.

Then the NBA Combine happened. It was in Chicago last month the 6-foot-7 Huerter \u2014who completed his sophomore season in March\u2014put on a shooting display that created an immediate buzz that swept through the camp. It began in an individual drill with a swished 3-pointer from the left corner. It ended 14 3-point attempts later, all of them makes. NBA coaches, general managers and scouts who observed Huerter\u2019s handiwork were slack jawed. Huerter\u2019s plans were to test his NBA Draft stock without hiring an agent. He was looking to make a clear-cut decision, armed with feedback that either advised him to go back to school or made it obvious he was ready for the next level. Those 15 3-pointers made his decision easy. Los Angeles Lakers coach Luke Walton was one of the witnesses to Huerter\u2019s shooting drill, and several draft analysts have reported speculation that the Lakers, second-to-last in the NBA in 3-point shooting this season, have promised to pick him in the first round. The fact Huerter had to pull out of the second day of Combine scrimmages and cut short his workout tour\u2014appearing for only the Lakers, Hawks, Nets and Celtics\u2014because a hand injury sustained during the season flared up and eventually required surgery isn\u2019t expected to affect his draft stock. Huerter suffered ligament damage to his right (shooting hand) pinkie in a game against Northwestern in February. He gutted out the rest of the season, hoping to avoid surgery. He finally relented to going under the knife, and is supposed to be sidelined the next two months. Huerter made just two of the final nine 3-pointers he hoisted in his Maryland career, but the injury didn\u2019t affect him during that life-altering shooting drill in Chicago. And besides, teams that scouted Maryland all season know he\u2019s much more than a good shooter. \u201cHe\u2019s pretty special,\u201d Turgeon told the Baltimore Sun during the season. \u201cHe really sees things. He\u2019ll see mismatch things that a lot of kids don\u2019t see, and he sees it quickly. He helps me. He sees a lot of things on the floor, and I trust him because he\u2019s smart.\u201d As much as Turgeon hates to see Huerter go, he realizes the time has come. \u201cWith the NBA, it takes just one team to like you, and then the other guys start to jump on board, and that\u2019s kind of what happened with Kevin,\u201d Turgeon said. \u201cAnd the whole thing is whether they like him or not, is he ready? And he\u2019s ready. He asked me, and I said, \u2018Kevin, you\u2019re mature, you\u2019re ready for the jump.\u2019 After we did our homework we just really felt confident for the jump, and that this was the best thing for Kevin to do.\u201d In an era of position-less basketball, Huerter\u2019s size and skills will make him a perfect fit. It\u2019s ironic, but Maryland assistant coach Matt Brady thinks Huerter\u2019s old-school game perfectly suits him for new-age basketball. \u201cHe\u2019s an absolute throwback,\u201d Brady says. \u201cHe plays the right way. He\u2019s never trying to do one thing. Notably scoring. He can score, but he doesn\u2019t really force the issue. In that regard, he\u2019s a throwback. Young guys, they all feel like they have to score in order for validation. Kevin doesn\u2019t feel that way. He\u2019s got a really beautiful game. \u201cHe passes, he cuts, he defends, he rebounds. You watch a lot of players now, they\u2019re all trying to be something that\u2019s not natural or normal. Most are trying to be great scorers. Kevin\u2019s always had winning first. For that reason, he makes the right play all the time, and that why he\u2019s a good player.\u201d Versatility aside, Brady, a noted shooting instructor, is nevertheless impressed with Huerter\u2019s offensive game. \u201cHe always shoots the same shot,\u201d Brady said. \u201cThe same way, every time. Everything in sports is about eliminating [excess] movement and motion. Kevin eliminates all needless motion, with his arms, his hands, his body. He never fades. He has a straight-up-and-down, cookie-cutter shot. His head doesn\u2019t tilt. \u201cIn that regard, he reminds me of Klay Thompson. Klay shoots the same shot every time, no matter whether it\u2019s on the move, or when somebody\u2019s closing out on him. Wherever Kevin learned that from, it wasn\u2019t me. He was taught well at a young age, and he\u2019s never deviated. That\u2019s the singular reason great shooters are great.\u201d The Lakers own the No. 25 pick in the draft. Will Huerter last that long? Brady thinks whatever team takes Huerter will be glad it did. \u201cI think he\u2019s going to be a really, really good NBA player,\u201d Brady said. \u201cHe\u2019s got terrific size, terrific athletic ability. He doesn\u2019t need the ball to impact the game. He\u2019s a great student of the game, and he\u2019s got great character. He\u2019ll always try to outwork his competition, and he\u2019s going to listen to his coaches. And then he\u2019s got that skill that every team wants and needs. He can really shoot it.\u201d Chris Dortch is the editor of the  Blue Ribbon College Basketball Yearbook .

Several lottery teams of the 2018 NBA Draft have been on the clock at the exact same spot they now find themselves. Sometimes, they made the right call. On other occasions, the pick didn\u2019t pay out nearly as well as they hoped. Here\u2019s a look at the lottery teams who have picked at their respective slots earlier in their franchise histories. Excluded are teams that have not held these picks before (Phoenix, Dallas, Denver) as well as teams whose only experience with their pick is too recent to judge (Orlando). \u2014 No. 2 overall picks: Archie Dees (1958), Maurice Stokes (1955), Otis Birdsong (1977), Phil Ford (1978) Success: The Kings haven\u2019t picked second overall since their Kansas City days. Overall, they\u2019ve had four cracks at No. 2, with three of them yielding game-changing talent. Their most dominant selection was also the franchise\u2019s most heartbreaking. Maurice Stokes appeared destined to give Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain all they could handle, averaging 16.4 points, 17.3 rebounds and 5.3 assists per contest in his first three seasons. Tragically, his career was cut short after a head injury that ultimately left him paralyzed. His stellar college career, combined with three NBA All-Star nods, three All-NBA honors, a rebounding title and Rookie of the Year award were still enough to earn him a place in the Hall of Fame. Do-Over: Dees was the only No. 2 overall pick in franchise history to not pan out, playing just one season with the then-Cincinnati Royals before bouncing to three other teams in his four-year career. No. 3 overall picks: Zelmo Beaty (1962), Pete Maravich (1970), Marvin Webster (1975), Pau Gasol (2001), Al Horford (2007) Success: Third overall has been kind to the Hawks for the most part. Four of the five players they\u2019ve taken at that spot wound up being All-Stars, including two already in the Hall of Fame (Beaty and Maravich). Beaty was the enforcer behind one of the Hawks\u2019 consistently contending teams of the 1960s. He averaged 17.4 points and 11.2 rebounds per contest in seven seasons with the franchise, numbers which earned him two All-Star nods and the Hawks their first division title in the post-Bob-Pettit era. Beaty\u2019s Hawks reached the Western Division Finals five times, with three of those series going the full seven games. His best game on that stage: a 36-point, 14-rebound gem against the Jerry West-led Lakers in Game 2 of the 1966 division final. Do-Over: By 2001, the end of the Mutombo-Smith-Blaylock era produced back-to-back lottery seasons, a blow to the once perennial playoff participants. Atlanta decided to jumpstart its rebuild by trading the rights to Gasol to Memphis in exchange for All-Star and Olympian forward Shareef Abdur-Rahim. The move didn\u2019t pan out for the Hawks, who missed the postseason in both of Abdur-Rahim\u2019s full seasons in Atlanta before trading him in 2004. Gasol, meanwhile, went on to become the league\u2019s Rookie of the Year, earn six All-Star appearances and win two championship rings. No. 4 overall picks: Antonio Daniels (1997), Drew Gooden (2002), Mike Conley (2007) Success: Entering the 2007 NBA Draft, Conley was considered the riskier of the two Ohio State products vying to be selected among the first few picks. In the end, Conley\u2019s career wound up being far more productive than No. 1 overall pick and college teammate Greg Oden. The 6-foot-1 point guard has played his entire career in Memphis, helping lead the franchise to its most successful and beloved \u201cGrit and Grind\u201d era. Conley\u2019s name dots the Grizzlies\u2019 recordbooks, where he is No. 1 in all-time games played, 3-pointers made, assists and steals. Do-Over: The 2002 NBA Draft was chock-full of power forward talent. And while Gooden wound up producing solidly over the course of his career, he never quite made the impact of an Amar\u2019e Stoudemire or Nene Hilario. No. 7 overall picks: Quintin Dailey (1982), Chris Mihm (2000), Kirk Hinrich (2003) Success: Forgotten between the MVP eras of Michael Jordan and Derrick Rose is the fact that Hinrich was the floor leader of the first post-Jordan playoff teams in Chicago. The Bulls accurately pinpointed him as a talent worth snagging outside the top five and came away with one of the grittier point guards of the mid-to-late 2000s. Hinrich averaged 11.4 points, 5.1 assists and 1.1 steals in 11 seasons with Chicago, a stretch which included an All-Defensive Second Team nod and a roster spot on the 2006 USA Men\u2019s Basketball team. Do-Over: Character matters, and the Bulls may have undervalued that characteristic with Dailey in 1982. The former University of San Francisco standout entered the NBA fresh off an arrest and charges of attempted assault, leading to Chicagoans picketing and protesting his presence on the Bulls roster. His off-court issues were compounded with drug addiction, which ultimately led to Chicago letting him walk just four years after being drafted. Dailey was taken four picks before Fat Lever and six selections before Sleepy Floyd. No. 8 overall picks: Campy Russell (1974), Ron Harper (1986), Andre Miller (1999), Jamal Crawford (2000), DeSagana Diop (2001) Success: Four years into their existence, the Cavaliers were still searching for their first playoff berth. Enter Russell, a dominant scoring forward out of Michigan who tiptoed into NBA waters before making a full-blown splash in his second season. The 6-foot-8 youngster was second on the team in scoring during what became known as The Miracle of Richfield season, when the well-balanced Cavs won the Central Division and advanced all the way to the Eastern Conference Finals before before bowing out to Boston in six games. Russell played seven seasons for Cleveland and earned an All-Star berth while averaging 21.9 points, 6.8 rebounds, 4.7 assists and 1.3 steals per contest in the 1978-79 campaign. Do-Over: If the Cavs select a big man this week, it will hopefully work out better than Diop or Chris Mihm, whom they acquired in exchange for Crawford (a three-time Sixth Man Award winner) and cash. Diop, meanwhile, was taken two spots before seven-time All-Star Joe Johnson. No. 9 overall picks: John Rudometkin (1962), Jerry Harkness (1963), Gene Short (1975), Larry Demic (1979), Mike Sweetney (2003) Do-Over: None of the five players taken by the Knicks at No. 9 panned out, but the most egregious of them might be Sweetney in 2003. Not only was he taken immediately before several capable role players (Mickael Pietrus, Nick Collison and Luke Ridnour), but also lumped him into one of their worst trades of the century. Sweetney was dealt to Chicago along with Jermaine Jackson, Tim Thomas and two first-round picks (which became LaMarcus Aldridge and Joakim Noah) in exchange for Eddy Curry, Antonio Davis and a first-round pick. No. 10 overall picks: Leon Wood (1984), Elfrid Payton (2014) Success: The Process was built on patience, and Philadelphia laid down a huge cornerstone by drafting Payton and then trading him to Orlando for 12th overall selection Dario Saric, a first-round pick and a second-round pick. Despite not coming over from Europe until 2016, Saric has since become a key point of attack for the rapidly rising 76ers, averaging 13.7 points and 6.5 rebounds over his first two seasons with the franchise. Do-Over: Though Wood has since become one of the most respected officials in recent NBA history, the former college All-American wound up playing less than 5,000 career minutes for six different teams. The 76ers, who were looking for backcourt help after taking Charles Barkley just six picks earlier, might have been better served taking Jay Humphries (13th) or John Stockton (16th). No. 12 overall picks: Melvin Ely (2002), Yaroslav Korolev (2005) Do-over: Not much to choose from, but it\u2019s hard to fault the Clippers for taking a stab at Ely in when the next pick to make a significant impact was No. 23 (Tayshaun Prince) Korolev, however, was a 17-year-old project who played all of 168 NBA minutes; third-fewest among first-round picks that year. Though the Clippers did improve to a playoff team the following season, that leap might have been even greater had they taken Danny Granger (No. 17) instead. No. 13 overall picks: Joe Wolf (1987), Loy Vaught (1990), Terry Dehere (1993) Success: Considering where they were picking and the options available, Vaught was a win. The former Michigan standout developed steadily before rounding into one of the more reliable power forwards in the league for a four-year stretch (1993-97). He was also part of the franchise\u2019s only three playoff appearances between 1977 and 2005. Injuries cut Vaught\u2019s career short, but that didn\u2019t stop him from twice finishing among the league\u2019s top 10 rebounders. Do-Over: Though neither Wolf nor Dehere were taken immediately before superior talents, their overall careers paled in comparison to players taken much later in the first round of their respective drafts. Wolf went five picks ahead of Rookie of the Year Mark Jackson, while Dehere was taken before Chris Mills, Ervin Johnson and Sam Cassell went off the board at 22, 23 and 24, respectively. * * *"},{"id":39907,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-jamal-crawford-exercises-player-option-join-free-agent-pool","date":"2018-06-18","title":"Report: Jamal Crawford exercises player option with Minnesota Timberwolves, joins free agent pool","content":" Minnesota guard Jamal Crawford has reportedly opted out of his player option with the team and will enter free agency, according to Yahoo!

(Narrator: He hadn\u2019t.) A few years had gone by since the last public embarrassment\u2014a mock draft, the single biggest waste of time since a long-now-since-fired marketing whiz green-lighted New Coke in the early \u201880s. Regular readers know the reasoning behind my reluctance to do mock drafts. (I was happy, on Tony Kornheiser\u2019s old radio show, to do the \u201cDoc Draft,\u201d where we picked our favorite doctors, real and\/or fictional in a one-round draft. I had the number one pick and, it being the late \u201890s, took Dr. Susan Lewis from \u201cER,\u201d in whom I saw great, uh, potential , and explained why and how she would dominate the ER in my best Mel Kiper, Jr., voice.)  One, between now and the middle of July, almost everyone in the NBA is lying about their true intentions, which means they\u2019re lying to me about the players they like and would pick if they get the chance. (Honk if you\u2019ve ever heard a GM or coach, on Draft night, say \u2018well, Joe wasn\u2019t really our first choice; unfortunately, the Blazers took Andrew two picks ahead of us. That\u2019s the guy we really wanted.\u2019) You will hear a half dozen rumors between now and Thursday night about some prospect\u2019s terrible medicals, or his terrible relationship with his mother, or his terrible whatever it is\u2014none of which is true, and is put out there by other teams\/agents who either want him to fall down to them (if they\u2019re a team with a middling pick) or want him to fall period (if they\u2019re not represented by the agent who spreads the rumors). Two, trades that are not disclosed before the Draft, or trades that don\u2019t come together until after the Draft begins, aren\u2019t known to me when I start making these imaginary picks. Three, the success rate on these things is extremely low, which doesn\u2019t put the mocker in the best light. The last time I did one of these things, out of 30 picks, I got\u2026zero correct. Zero. Nada. Zippo. Goose eggs. (Technically, I did get T.J. Warren going to Phoenix correct, but I had him going there with the second of the Suns\u2019 two first-round picks that year; they took him with their first.) Which leads to fans asking afterward a) how could you be so uninformed\/stupid, and b) how do you keep your job when you\u2019re so bad at this? The answers: a) this is not my idea, and b) this is not my idea!!! I do this because you\u2014the dear readers\/watchers, love mock drafts and want as many of them as possible. Theoretically, it\u2019s understandable; what\u2019s the harm? But to me, this is the equivalent of asking someone to predict what tomorrow\u2019s lottery number will be. There are, as ever, just a few variables. We have no idea whether Michael Porter, Jr.\u2019s back\/hip will hold up for a year, or 10 years, or not at all, and what each team actually thinks about the medicals it has on him, and predict accordingly where he\u2019ll go. * DA Big Boards:  Bigs | Wings | Guards We have no idea what the Spurs are going to now do about Kawhi Leonard, now that all 7.6 billion people currently on earth ( that\u2019s rising , by the way) know he wants out of San Antonio. Will they be able to change his mind in the next few weeks? Do they keep him through his contract, which has a year to run? Do they trade him at the deadline next February? Do they trade him Draft night? And if they do, what do they want back, and who will they trade with\u2014the Lakers? The Sixers? The Celtics? Someone completely off the radar? Remember, no one, starting with us \u201cexperts,\u201d had any idea that Oklahoma City was in the mix for Paul George. We have no idea which of Atlanta\u2019s three first-round picks it will keep, or which of Philly\u2019s four second-rounders it will keep, each being potential bait for a team currently without a first-rounder or someone looking to sell a late first\u2014any of which would significantly alter who goes where in the Draft. Well, at least I only have to do one. As ever, the ground rules, which you are required to commit to memory: 1. I will totally sell out someone at NBA.com when these picks come crashing down to earth, and say he\/she ghost picked for me, and that it\u2019s their fault I got zero right out of 30 again this season; 2. If I stumble into anything approaching prescience and get anything approaching half of these picks right, I will proclaim myself the seer of seers, and dine out on these wild guesses for years to come! NEEDS: Point guard, center THE PICK: C Deandre Ayton , Arizona If you had a chance to take Joel Embiid without the back problems, you\u2019d do it, right? Phoenix does with the 19-year-old Ayton, and barring the end of days before Thursday they should make the Arizona freshman the first great big man prospect\u2014with apologies to Alex Len, Robin Lopez and Marcin Gortat\u2014for the franchise since Amare Stoudemire went ninth overall in 2002 . Ayton has explosive offensive upside, which has been enhanced in pre-Draft training; he\u2019s up to 265 pounds or so now, up 12 from his Wildcats weight, while maintaining eight percent body fat. He has worked on improving his passing and can now comfortably shoot out to the NBA three-point line after tweaking his footwork and mechanics. The questions on Ayton start at the defensive end, where he didn\u2019t engage nearly as consistently as you\u2019d like. Part of the issue was Ayton was playing out of position at the four through long stretches for Arizona, but every big coming into the league is going to have to at least display some ability to defend guards off of pick and roll switches. Ayton\u2019s improving in that area. And he has a great personality that will show itself with time. The Suns need to hit a home run here after years of floundering. NEEDS: Playmaking\/finishing wing THE PICK: G\/F Luka Doncic , Real Madrid The Kangz need not to Kangz and overthink this. Either Doncic or Marvin Bagley would be a legit (and safe) pick here; anyone else at two would be a reach. Like everyone else, Sacramento has two years worth of intel on Doncic and shouldn\u2019t go wobbly at the 11th hour. He\u2019s legit, and if Vivek Ranadive really will let VP of Basketball Operations Vlade Divac make the call here, it\u2019ll be the 19-year-old Doncic, who\u2019s been a star playing against grown men in the ACB League, EuroLeague and international competition since he was 16. (This was Sunday, in the ACB final against Baskonia .) He\u2019s a huge offensive talent who can be plugged in right away play next to De\u2019Aaron Fox, last year\u2019s first round pick, and give the Kings another ballhandler, either at the two or three depending on matchups. They want and need someone who can take some of that responsibility off of Fox, and who can run with and finish alongside him. You could take Bagley here and you hear that Vivek Ranadive is leaning in that direction. But, for me, Doncic makes more sense for the Kings. Will Doncic struggle on D? Yes. Are the Kings the \u201985 Bears? No. So don\u2019t worry about that now and take the offensive talent, which is ready to make the move across the pond. And, don\u2019t insult him. Write this on your IPad 1,000 times: \u201che is not Darko.\u201d \u201che is not Darko.\u201d \u201che is not Darko.\u201d NEEDS: Frontcourt scoring, defense THE PICK: F Marvin Bagley III , Duke The Hawks are in the best possible position in this year\u2019s Draft (if they stay here); they\u2019re certain to get one of the top three players on the board without lifting a finger. Bagley should be able to score and rebound immediately (Atlanta checked in 25th in rebounds per game this past season ) and help John Collins and Taurean Prince up front. The Hawks are strong favorite to move one or both of their other firsts ( 19th and 30th ) and could move all over the board, so it\u2019s not outside the realm of possibility that they could move down a couple of spots from three and garner another future first or young player if someone else wants this pick bad enough. But the Hawks are in no hurry. To move out of three would have to bring back a young player with upside and a potential Lottery pick in 2019. Eliminate all that tsuris and go for the 6-9 Bagley. NEEDS: Scoring\/shooting THE PICK: G Trae Young , Oklahoma Yes, Memphis is listening to offers for this pick, if you\u2019ll take Chandler Parsons off their hands (which would give the Grizzlies the ability to go above mid-level to re-sign free agent Tyreke Evans). But the Grizzlies also insist they don\u2019t need to rebuild and can get right back among the west\u2019s elite with just a couple of roster tweaks and a return to health for Mike Conley, Jr., and Marc Gasol. If that\u2019s true, Memphis has to improve its offense immediately and can\u2019t wait for a prospect: the Grizz were 29th in the Association this past season in scoring (99.3\/game) , 27th in Offensive Rating ( 101.8 ) and True Shooting Percentage ( .539 ), 28th in Effective Field Goal Percentage ( .500 ) and 25th in three-point percentage ( .352 ). And if more offense is the issue, Young is the guy, whether he\u2019s at the one or the two. He\u2019s an elite scorer, leading the nation in scoring and assists in his one season in Norman, while also getting to the foul line at a prodigious rate (236 attempts, second in the country). With Conley back, J.B. Bickerstaff can bring Young in off the bench, or go small ball and play them together if Evans goes off to greener pastures; Young will struggle on D, but Conley can help alleviate that some by picking up the opposition\u2019s more lethal backcourt scorer on cross matches. NEEDS: Post defense, shooting THE PICK: F\/C Jaren Jackson, Jr. , Michigan State One senses the chatter of late about the Mavs being interested in Porter here is stagecraft designed to goose potential offers for the pick from other teams that are indeed interested in the Missouri freshman. Can\u2019t see Dallas walking away from some very talented big man prospects here, so Mo Bamba is definitely in play as well. But of the young bigs left in this scenario, Jackson would be a boon for the Mavs. He has way too much two-way potential to walk away from, he\u2019s just 18 and he was well schooled in the Tom Izzo School of NBA Prep at East Lansing. Spartans have a pretty solid track record at the next level; Jackson should be the next. And if Dallas is truly interested in signing free agent DeMarcus Cousins in July, Jackson could play off of him effectively at the four. NEEDS: Point guard THE PICK: G Collin Sexton , Alabama Need, meet player. Sexton has been very impressive both in pre-Draft workouts and in his interviews with prospective teams. The Magic\u2019s decade-plus chasm at the point has to end. Sexton can score with the best of them, and while his playmaking is a work in progress, he\u2019ll likely get better at finding open guys with detailed coaching and being with better players. Defensively, there\u2019s a reason he\u2019s been compared with Patrick Beverley; Sexton\u2019s give a bleep meter is high. If Young were still on the board here Orlando would have a choice to make, and maybe they\u2019d go for Young. But if he\u2019s off the board already, there is no choice. Take Sexton. NEEDS: Perimeter scoring, defense THE PICK: C\/F Mohamed Bamba , Texas As noted above, Bamba could go much higher than this; his window opens with Dallas at five. It\u2019s hard to see him slipping past Chicago here, even though the Bulls have been linked with Porter during the last few weeks (they have a long and strong relationship with Porter\u2019s agent, Chicago-based Mark Bartelstein, and their doctors were the ones that examined Porter in Chicago. They don\u2019t know any more about Porter\u2019s back than other teams as a result, but the arrangement speaks to the trust the two sides have with one another). But Bamba\u2019s defensive chops\u2014second in the country in blocked shots per game (3.7), fourth nationally in total blocks (111), 12th in rebounds per game and Defensive Rating\u2014are just too good for a Bulls team that hemorrhaged points last season ( their Defensive Rating of 109.1 was 28th in the league ) and was next to invisible protecting the front of the rim ( DFL in blocks per game, 3.5 ). TEAM NEEDS: Perimeter defense THE PICK: C\/F Wendell Carter, Jr. , Duke The Cavs, of course, could move this pick if it helps their chances of keeping LeBron James. But if they think they have any chance of keeping James\u2014which they won\u2019t likely know for sure on Draft night\u2014and keep the pick, it would make sense to take Carter, who anchored the back of Duke\u2019s zone defense as a freshman. There\u2019s no guarantee he\u2019ll be able to guard in space or on switches. But there\u2019s a reason he\u2019s been compared by many to Al Horford; he has a real knack for big plays at big moments, he was a rock playing next to a more flamboyant teammate (Joakim Noah 10 years ago with Horford at Florida; Bagley with Carter at Duke) and he\u2019s tougher than people realize. Carter\u2019s game could play next to Tristan Thompson\u2019s and he should rebound immediately at the next level. Cleveland was wowed by Sexton as well, and they could use a young, dynamic point guard\u2014so nothing, including the Cavs moving up to make sure they get one, would surprise. TEAM NEEDS: Wing length\/defense, shooting THE PICK: F Michael Porter, Jr. , Missouri At nine, this is a more than reasonable gamble for the Knicks; failing someone wowing the Knicks with an offer of a young player and a pick, or taking Noah\u2019s salary off their hands, expect them to stay here at nine. Porter has too much talent and potential to pass up; he was number one on most mock draft boards at this time last year before his back injury, which led to surgery and kept him out of action almost all season at Missouri. The Knicks could, and likely would, give Porter all the time he needs to fully recover, as they no doubt will with Kristaps Porzingis, coming off that ACL tear last February ; so what if they\u2019re in the Lottery again next year? The potential one-two of P-squared (Porter and Porzingis; don\u2019t bother, I\u2019ve already copyrighted it) down the road is worth the wait. You don\u2019t hear any more from Philly fans about the long, long wait for Joel Embiid (and I\u2019m not saying Porter will be Embiid; I\u2019m talking about talent blossoming after a guy finally gets healthy and strong and confident). TEAM NEEDS: Young two guard\/frontcourt depth THE PICK: F Mikal Bridges , Villanova Bridges was rock solid for the national champion Wildcats and would step right in for the hometown Sixers as a rotation guy off the bench; with Robert Covington ahead of him on the depth chart, there\u2019s no rush. Bridges is a high character two-way player who defends multiple positions and showed he could fit in with other high-level talents at Villanova, while shooting a crazy 43.5 percent on threes last season. After the last few weeks, Philly could use a drama-free press conference introducing a winner who grew up less than an hour away in Malvern. TEAM NEEDS: Perimeter playmaking\/scoring, power forward THE PICK: F Kevin Knox , Kentucky The Hornets haven\u2019t gotten a ton of wing production the last couple of years; Knox, who didn\u2019t shoot it great at Kentucky in his one season there but who was a big-time scorer in high school, has the arc of someone who should knock down more open shots at the next level. And his size, wingspan and vertical are intriguing mixes if Charlotte were to play small next season under first-year coach James Borrego. GM Mitch Kupchak\u2019s MO with the Lakers was taking Power Six conference players in the Draft; Kentucky certainly applies. TEAM NEEDS: Shooting, athletic length THE PICK: G\/F Lonnie Walker , Miami The Clippers could use some depth at the two, with Austin Rivers entering the final year of his deal and with Avery Bradley an unrestricted free agent who\u2019ll be looking for a big payday. Walker has significant support among many NBA types, some of whom think he\u2019s the best two in the Draft. The expectation is that his so-so shooting numbers in his one year of college (41.5 percent FG\/34.6 percent on threes) will improve significantly at the next level, playing off of better talent. The rebuilding Clippers provide opportunity and potential minutes. THE PICK: G Shai Gilgeous-Alexander , Kentucky Starting point guard Patrick Beverley will be 30 on opening night and is coming off microfracture surgery; backup Milos Teodosic had a promising first NBA season for the Clips, but is 31 and has a player option for 2018-19. Picking Gilgeous-Alexander here would thus be practical and prudent, and would give Los Angeles a promising multi-positional guard who really came on for the Wildcats the second half of the season. SGA\u2019s length is tantalizing (his 6\u2019-11.5\u201d wingspan at the Chicago combine was easily the longest among point guards) and he averaged almost six assists a game for Kentucky once he was put in the starting lineup for good in early January. And did we mention he has three percent body fat? Three. The fingers typing this have 12.2 percent body fat. TEAM NEEDS: Defense; small forward THE PICK: F Miles Bridges , Michigan State The Nuggets have existing and\/or emerging answers on their roster everywhere but the three. Bridges fixes that; when you\u2019re first team all Big 10, second team all-America and a finalist for the Julius Erving Small Forward of the Year award, your chops speak for themselves. Bridges could well toggle between forward spots in the pros\u2014he might struggle initially guarding threes in space\u2014but he\u2019s another tough kid from Flint who got even tougher playing for Tom Izzo. And, he got better\u2014Bridges went from a 69 percent free throw shooter as a freshman at Michigan State to an 85 percent shooter as a sophomore. He\u2019ll fit right in with the run and gun Nuggets and give Mike Malone even more flexibility with lineups, which will come in handy if Denver can\u2019t re-sign Will Barton. TEAM NEEDS: Young size, perimeter shooting THE PICK: C Robert Williams , Texas A&M John Wall wasn\u2019t lying when he said the Wizards needed to get a young, athletic big into their shop. The 20-year-old Williams, who was co-SEC Defensive Player of the Year as a sophomore after winning the award outright as a freshman, applies. Consistency of effort\/production was an issue for Williams in the regular season, but after he helped lead the Aggies to a Sweet 16 run in the NCAAs, his bona fides were back on display. Presumably, he skipped the combine for a reason; guys don\u2019t normally do that unless they\u2019re assured they\u2019re going in the first round of the Draft, and presumably the top half. Fifteen is exactly the end of the top half of the Draft. Picking Williams would be a tell that the Wizards think they can find another home for Marcin Gortat, who\u2019ll be entering the final year of his contract and with whom Wall has been fussin\u2019 with for a while. Williams should also be more impactful offensively playing with better shooters; A&M was an abysmal 283rd in the country in three-point shooting (.329) last season. The Wizards, as we all should know by now, are very good shooting threes; they just need to shoot more of them. THE PICK: F Keita Bates-Diop , Ohio State This pick could certainly be moved\/sold by Phoenix to one of the teams without a first-rounder looking to get into the mix. But if the Suns keep it, Bates-Diop would make a lot of sense here. KBD is viewed as a jack of all trades but master of none by many NBA types. That may be true. But he\u2019s a long one; his 7\u2019-3.25\u201d wingspan was easily tops among all guards and forwards at the combine. He made a huge leap his junior season for the Buckeyes, winning Big 10 Player of the Year honors, punishing conference opponents left and right , and learned extensively about playing at the next level from assistant coach Chris Jent, the longtime Cavaliers assistant who is now on Lloyd Pierce\u2019s staff in Atlanta. In the multi-positional modern NBA, Bates-Diop will be a boon to any team with his potential as a switcher on pick and rolls. KBD also comes from a rock-solid family; he\u2019d fit right in as the Suns continue to re-establish a winning culture, and give new coach Igor Kokoskov his own multi-positional switching group to throw at the likes of the Dubs and Rockets, with Bates-Diop joining Josh Jackson and T.J. Warren\u2014presumably, with Ayton\u2014trapping and funneling everything and everyone to the big man. TEAM NEEDS: Post defense, point guard THE PICK: G Aaron Holiday , UCLA Mike Budenholzer will give Eric Bledsoe a chance to show he\u2019s the long-term answer for Milwaukee at the point. But with Bled entering the last year of his contract, it\u2019s only prudent for the Bucks to give themselves some insurance at the position. Most important, though, Milwaukee needs shooting, and Aaron Holiday, the younger brother of Jrue (New Orleans) and Justin (Chicago), can fill it up\u2014he was top 25 nationally in three-point shooting as a junior for the Bruins (.429 behind the college line). Yes, Malcolm Brogdon and Matthew Dellavedova are still on the roster, but a) you can never have enough point guards, and b) in this day and age point guards with reasonable deals are eminently tradeable quantities. Holiday, all-Pac 12 First Team and all-Pac 12 Defensive Team, is a talent who could help the Bucks right away. TEAM NEEDS: Youth, wings THE PICK: G Kevin Huerter , Maryland This would complete a meteoric rise up the Draft board for Huerter, who was nowhere to be found on most mocks anywhere near the first round before Chicago. But a great combine has him solidly here now, even though he\u2019ll be out two months after surgery this week on his right hand. The Spurs have a definite long-term need at the two with Danny Green on a player option for 2018-19 at $10 million and no obvious replacement for him in sight (no, we are not counting Manu Ginobili, no matter how strong his age 40 season was last year). San Antonio has cap room and could go after the likes of Avery Bradley in free agency, but until the Spurs know for sure they can sign a vet, hedging their bets with a shooter like Huerter (41 percent on threes for the Terps last season) would make sense. THE PICK: G Zhaire Smith , Texas Tech Caveat Emptor: the Hawks could obviously move this pick as well as their other first-rounder, 30th overall, for the right package of picks\/players. But if they keep it, Smith is a freak athlete who tested off the charts in Chicago (second among all participants in the three-quarter run; fourth in standing vertical jump; fifth in max vertical) that melded promising basketball with those physical gifts this season. An all-Big 12 Defensive Team selection, Smith shot 45 percent in a somewhat limited sample size (just 40 attempts) in his one college season in helping get the Red Raiders to the Elite Eight. The Hawks need a long-term solution at the two going forward, and would be in no hurry as the 19-year-old Smith went through his growing pains at the next level. TEAM NEEDS: Wing shooting THE PICK: G Khyri Thomas , Creighton You think Thibs could get behind a guy who was Defensive Player of the Year in the Big East this season after being co-DOPY as a sophomore? Thomas is a fierce, next play competitor at the two who stayed at around 40 percent on threes as a junior, while tripling the number of attempts he shot from his freshman season. The Wolves could definitely use some firepower coming off the bench with Jamal Crawford expected to opt out of the last year of his deal and explore free agency. Thomas could handle that and likely more early in his career. TEAM NEEDS: Shooting, frontcourt depth THE PICK: F Moritz Wagner , Michigan The Wolverines\u2019 junior played himself into first-round consideration with an excellent season and NCAA Tournament, leading Michigan to the national championship game. He\u2019s a tailor-made modern day big, who\u2019s been a dynamic three-point shooter the last two years (39 percent as a sophomore and a junior) while also being able to put the ball on the deck and get to the rim. Wagner stuck his nose inside as well for Michigan last season, leading the team in rebounding at 7.1 per game. Wagner would be a very different kind of big than Derrick Favors, but he\u2019d be a solid insurance policy for Utah with Favors one of the few quality bigs available in free agency this summer. THE PICK: F Chandler Hutchison , Boise State The whiff of a promise from the Bulls here doesn\u2019t mean that Hutchison isn\u2019t worthy; he played himself into the first round after an outstanding senior season for the Broncos, earning first team all Mountain West honors and looking like a rarity\u2014a 22-year-old senior that still has a lot of upside in the pros. He\u2019s not an elite athlete but he\u2019s good enough, and the Bulls need some more wings who can help Lauri Markkanen put the ball in the basket. Hutchison will have to make his shot behind the arc more of a consistent weapon; when he\u2019s hot, he makes them in bunches. TEAM NEEDS: Frontcourt depth THE PICK: G Elie Okobo , Pau Orthez While the Pacers could use a young big to play behind Myles Turner and\/or Domantas Sabonis, they also don\u2019t have a long-term answer at the point after this season; both incumbent Darren Collison and Cory Joseph are up after 2018-19. The 20-year-old Okobo emerged for Pau in the French Pro A League last year, leading the team in scoring and assists, and gave his calling card in last month\u2019s French League playoffs, dropping 44 points against Monaco , one point short of the all-time record. He is not a finished product by any means but a year of interning behind Collison and Joseph would help him make the transition to the NBA quickly, and give Indiana a potential backcourt mate for Victor Oladipo for the next few years. TEAM NEEDS: Backcourt depth\/perimeter shooting THE PICK: G Donte DiVincenzo , Villanova The junior guard wasn\u2019t on anyone\u2019s radar as a potential first-rounder two months ago. The idea was DiVincenzo would play his role as an energy guy off Villanova\u2019s bench behind the Wildcats\u2019 more experienced players, then take a star turn next season with most of them gone that would give him a chance to shine. Instead, the guy my dude Gus Johnson gave the great nickname \u201cThe Big Ragu\u201d (you have to be my age to get it) exploded in the national championship game against Michigan, setting an NCAA record for most points coming off the bench in a title game (31) and winning Most Outstanding Player honors. He followed that up by finishing first at the Combine in both standing and max vertical jumps\u2014and after that, there was no turning back. DiVincenzo\u2019s crazy hops and swag will make him a fan favorite wherever he goes, and if he goes to the Blazers he\u2019ll fit right in playing behind Damian Lillard and C.J. McCollum. TEAM NEEDS: Frontcourt defense\/rebounding THE PICK: C Mitchell Robinson , Chalmette (LA) HS Robinson is an enigma to many, having fallen off the radar nationally after de-committing from Western Kentucky last year and never playing any college ball before declaring for the Draft. But he has had some eye-raising workouts\u2014one for the Lakers\u2014in the last few weeks, displaying the raw ability that made him a McDonald\u2019s all-American in high school. He can run and block shots seemingly at will. There is definitely significant talent there. But Robinson will need to display some stability wherever he goes. He\u2019s bounced around schools, agents and workout people the past couple of years and needs to have real structure around him if he\u2019s going to blossom. The City of the Angels is not known for providing structure to young, wealthy men; to them, it\u2019s known for instant entr\u00e9e into the newest, swankiest clubs and bottles of Moet Imperial on demand. That will not help Robinson. If the Lakers go this route they\u2019ll have to invest in a support system for the 20-year-old that will be well-served saying \u201cno\u201d to him in unison, early and often. THE PICK: G Troy Brown , Oregon This pick is a definite candidate to be sold to one of the current six teams\u2014Detroit, New Orleans, Miami, Oklahoma City, Houston and Toronto\u2014that don\u2019t have first-rounders. Hard to see the Sixers interested in committing guaranteed money here for a player who might not get into their rotation any time soon when they\u2019re all in for a board-tilting free agent. But whether Philly makes this pick for itself or someone else, Brown is a talent with upside. The 29 percent he shot on threes at Oregon is a red flag, but guys tend to improve their shooting with diligence and good coaching, and the 76ers have shown they can take young talent and improve it (see Robert Covington and T.J. McConnell). At 6-7, Brown can handle in transition and pass with any two guard coming out of school. Though he\u2019s shown flashes, and he\u2019s smart, he\u2019s not a great defender yet, but did we mention he\u2019s 18 and 6-7? TEAM NEEDS: Center THE PICK: F Omari Spellman , Villanova Spellman may be more suited to play the four in the pros than five, but the positions are pretty interchangeable in Brad Stevens\u2019 system. Boston has a seemingly endless supply of long guards and wings, and more ballhandlers than you can imagine, but the Cs are, relatively, thin behind Al Horford when it comes to bigs. Aron Baynes is due a nice payday this summer after giving Stevens quality minutes this season and could well price himself out of Boston\u2019s budget. Thus, Spellman, another high-character kid from the Wildcats\u2019 championship team. He worked diligently to improve his body and his shot in his one season on the Main Line, and both were on display during Villanova\u2019s run to the title. Spellman shot 43 percent on threes and was Big East Freshman of the Year. Yes, this is all Boston needs on its roster\u2014another teenager with massive upside. TEAM NEEDS: Frontcourt depth THE PICK: G Gary Trent, Jr., Duke Steve Kerr and Bob Myers have both said that the Warriors need this pick to play next season\u2014there will be no stashing or selling. Given that, Trent, Jr. would be a good value here with some upside, rather than reaching on a young big that will need more time to develop. (It\u2019s almost a given by now that the Warriors will buy a second-round pick from someone, anyway, which would allow them to take a flier on a young four or five.) Trent fits the Golden State profile\u2014a prolific shooter (40 percent on threes for the Blue Devils) who has the capability of guarding multiple positions on defense. We say \u201ccapability\u201d here because Trent did not exactly shut down opponents at Duke as a weak side defender in the Blue Devils\u2019 zone, and he doesn\u2019t have ideal length as a wing defender in the pros. But he has the family toughness gene\u2014his father, Gary, Sr., was known as the \u201cShaq of the MAC\u201d when he played in college at Ohio University, and ground out nine NBA seasons as an undersized power forward. Trent, Jr. should be able, in the small ball NBA, to play the two and three, at least, and with at least one and probably two All-Stars on the floor with him most of the time, he\u2019ll get great looks that he should knock down. If he can be credible in space defensively, he\u2019d have an even better chance to get on the floor for the Dubs immediately. TEAM NEEDS: Shooting guard, power forward THE PICK: G Landry Shamet , Wichita State Under Kenny Atkinson, the Nets emphasize the three\u2014only Houston had a higher percentage of both three-point shots and points off of threes last season, per NBA.com\/Stats. With Joe Harris (second on the team last season with 150 threes) an unrestricted free agent and someone who\u2019ll be in demand, Brooklyn may need to shore itself up with another backcourt gunner. Shamet is a point guard, who led the AAC in assists , and the Nets already have D\u2019Angelo Russell and Spencer Dinwiddie at that position. But at 6-4, Shamet should be able to play off the ball as well in the pros. He shot 44 percent on threes last season for the Shockers, 13th-best in the country, and Wichita State\u2019s track record of late in producing NBA-ready guards (Fred Van Vleet and Ron Baker have both stuck despite not being first-rounders) is a plus for Shamet. The Nets have other positions where they need help, but they still need to amass more talent, and Shamet is a talent. THE PICK: F Dzanan Musa , Cedevita The likelihood is that the Hawks flip this pick for something\/someone else, as they\u2019ve expressed a willingness to take on salaries for 2018-19 to help facilitate trades. Whoever winds up with this pick could obviously use it as a stash selection. But on the off chance the Hawks hold onto it, Musa would fit into the talent\/needs time to develop portfolio Atlanta is currently selling. The 19-year-old can score, but needs a couple of years at least to get stronger and durable physically. Player development will be a priority for new coach Lloyd Pierce and the Hawks\u2019 coaching\/athletic training staff, which worked hand in hand under Mike Budenholzer and will continue that practice under GM Travis Schlenk and Pierce. Musa fits the profile. * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

He insists it\u2019ll pay off. There is an element of danger involved with every NBA draft pick, in that nothing is guaranteed. There isn\u2019t a player that epitomizes the risk versus reward thinking in this draft more than Porter Jr., who could get taken as high as No. 2 by Sacramento or go several picks lower because of uncertainty surrounding his health. Back problems that necessitated surgery limited his lone college season to three games at Missouri, and a scheduled Friday workout was called off because of hip spasms. There\u2019s still a chance he will do a workout before draft night and teams have gotten access to new medical information that would seem to suggest he\u2019s ready for the NBA \u2014 but still, skepticism may be understandable. \u201cI\u2019m feeling great,\u201d Porter Jr. said. Find out Thursday night which team believes him the most. He\u2019s 6-foot-10 and is usually categorized as a power forward, though in an NBA that\u2019s now largely positionless, Porter Jr. could wear a lot of hats. He\u2019s already shown a complete skillset \u2014 passing, dribbling, shooting \u2014 that would translate to playing basically anywhere except center. He weighed 211 pounds last month at the Draft Combine, meaning there\u2019s still plenty of room on his frame to add strength. His college highlights are basically nonexistent: Porter Jr. scored 30 points in 53 minutes of action with the Tigers. Porter Jr.\u2019s reputation is largely built on what he did as a high schooler when he was considered the best prospect in the country, and there was a workout earlier this month arranged by agent Mark Bartelstein earlier this month where he got rave reviews. \u201cHe showed that he\u2019s alive and well and moving,\u201d said Memphis general manager Chris Wallace, whose team has the No. 4 pick \u2014 and has been linked to Porter Jr. by many prognosticators. \u201cI would say (he) passed that first test.\u201d Alive, well and moving would seem to be the absolute basic prerequisites for a team to be satisfied about when preparing to use a lottery pick on someone, but Porter Jr. vows that whichever team grabs him won\u2019t be disappointed. \u201cI just feel like in today\u2019s game, there\u2019s guys that can do anything on the floor,\u201d Porter Jr. said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s how I kind of view myself.\u201d Porter Jr. played two minutes in his college debut in November, then underwent back surgery \u2014 a microdiscectomy of the L3 and L4 spinal discs \u2014 about a week and a half later. He returned for an SEC Tournament game against Georgia, then put up 16 points and 10 rebounds in Missouri\u2019s loss to Florida State in the NCAA Tournament. The injury went back to Porter Jr.\u2019s sophomore year of high school, when he got hurt while getting hit on a dunk attempt. \u201cHe\u2019s a very versatile player,\u201d former Georgia coach Mark Fox said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m thankful that the kid\u2019s gotten healthy because he was a terrific talent. \u2026 He\u2019ll be a top-five selection. I remember watching him in high school, and he\u2019s as complete of a player as there was at that level.\u201d That\u2019s what Porter Jr. wants NBA teams to remember before making their selection. He believes he\u2019s the best player. But with every indication that Deandre Ayton will go No. 1 to Phoenix, the intrigue starts at No. 2 and Porter is surely getting a real long look from the franchises that have the other top-10 spots, those being in order Sacramento, Atlanta, Memphis, Dallas, Orlando, Chicago, Cleveland, New York and Philadelphia. \u201cIt\u2019s about getting in the right situation,\u201d Porter Jr. said. \u201cI don\u2019t need to go No. 1. I don\u2019t feel like I have an ego that makes me want to go No. 1. I just want the right situation for me.\u201d"},{"id":39917,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/legendary-moments-paul-pierce-boston-celtics-2008-finals-mvp","date":"2018-06-17","title":"Legendary Moments In NBA History: Boston Celtics defeat Los Angeles Lakers for 2008 championship","content":"On June 17, 2008, the Boston Celtics powered past the Los Angeles Lakers in Game 6 of the 2008 NBA Finals to win their 17th NBA title in franchise history.

Scott Bordow of AZCentral.com, however, refuted the notion that Phoenix would be willing to deal the first No. 1 overall pick in franchise history for Leonard. \u201cThere\u2019s no truth to the report,\u201d Bordow wrote on Saturday. \u201cIn fact, the Suns have no interest in dealing the top pick \u2013 which likely will be University of Arizona center Deandre Ayton \u2013 in exchange for Leonard, who reportedly wants to be traded.\u201d Ayton, a 7-foot-1 center out of the University of Arizona, was considered the favorite to go first overall even before declaring earlier this month, \u201cI know I\u2019m going No. 1\u201d following his workout with the Suns . McDonough, however, entered the offseason with publicly stated intentions of speeding up the Suns\u2019 timeline in an attempt to enter playoff contention as early as next season. If healthy, Leonard would likely help the Suns achieve that goal sooner than the 19-year-old Ayton. Bordow, however, was adamant that Phoenix would not agree to such a deal, especially given that Leonard could leave the Suns as early as next summer. \u201cFrom the Suns\u2019 standpoint, the trade makes little sense,\u201d Bordow wrote. \u201cLeonard will be a free agent after the 2018-19 season.

(AP) \u2014 Authorities say Sacramento Kings forward Zach Randolph\u2019s brother was shot and killed early Saturday outside of a bar in the Indiana city where the two grew up. Police said that an officer heard gunfire at around 5 a.m. and found Roger Randolph bleeding between two cars outside of Hop\u2019s Blues Room in Marion, which is about 60 miles (97 kilometers) northeast of Indianapolis. They said investigators don\u2019t know the circumstances surrounding the shooting, but they don\u2019t think it was a random attack. Roger Randolph, who was 35 years old, had several brushes with the law, including for a 2004 shooting at a nightclub that wounded three people and landed him in prison. Roger Randolph was sentenced to three years in prison in 2005 for his role in the nightclub shooting in Anderson, which is about 30 miles (48 kilometers) south of Marion and is where court records say he had been living when he was killed. The shooting apparently stemmed from an argument on the dance floor. Zach Randolph was at the club that night and was questioned, but he wasn\u2019t charged. Roger Randolph was charged last year with OWI, the Indiana equivalent of driving under the influence. There was a hearing last week in that case, which was unresolved. Zach Randolph led Marion High School to a state championship in 2000 before heading to Michigan State University and then the NBA. In addition to the Kings, he has played for the Portland Trail Blazers, New York Knicks, Los Angeles Clippers and Memphis Grizzlies. He is a two-time NBA All Star.

According to multiple reports, the 2014 NBA Finals MVP is looking to leave the franchise via trade. Multiple outlets say Leonard is seeking a trade from the only NBA team he has ever known. Per ESPN\u2019s Chris Haynes, Leonard wants to be traded to Los Angeles, preferably the Lakers. He has reportedly grown dissatisfied with how the organization handled his quad injury and feels the franchise turned on him once Leonard sought a second opinion : The Spurs may not give into Leonard\u2019s preferred destination if you look at how the Indiana Pacers dealt with Paul George\u2019s request last year, according to Wojnarowski. Leonard and coach Gregg Popovich were reportedly set to meet in the coming weeks to attempt to iron out their differences. Leonard\u2019s focus has since changed, though, reports Jabari Young of the San Antonio Express-News : Leonard played in just nine games for San Antonio in the 2017-18 campaign due to a quad injury he initially suffered in Game 1 of the 2017 Western Conference finals . The two-time Kia Defensive Player of the Year\u2019s absence was especially notable late in the season, when he went to New York to continue rehab and chose not to be with the team during its playoff run. San Antonio was defeated 4-1 in the first round of the playoffs by eventual-champion Golden State. The two-time All-Star Leonard can enter unrestricted free agency in 2019 if he does not sign a contract extension with the Spurs this summer. Leonard is due just over $20 million next season. The Lakers may not be the only team in the mix as the LA Clippers may pursue him too , reports Wojnarowski (via Twitter): Yahoo Sports\u2019 Chris Mannix reports via Twitter that the Sacramento Kings may be a team that could get into the Leonard trade mix, too : Kevin O\u2019Connor of The Ringer reports four teams \u2014 the Sixers, Celtics, Lakers and Clippers \u2014 should be the main teams in the hunt for Leonard : Of course, the Spurs are under no obligation to grant Leonard\u2019s desire to be traded to a \u201cpreferred\u201d team , as TNT analyst David Aldridge points out via Twitter : Additionally, league sources told Yahoo Sports\u2019 Shams Charania that Leonard has become uncomfortable with any future with the Spurs and is looking to move on immediately . The tension surrounding the situation between Leonard and the Spurs intensified when, after opting to not be with the team for rehab reasons, Leonard was spotted three weeks later attending a Dodgers game in Los Angeles. San Antonio is hoping to regain the usual good footing it holds with its stars in order to maintain the standard of excellence they have maintained since drafting Tim Duncan No. 1 overall in 1997. The Spurs had won at least 50 games in every season until 2017-18, when they went 47-35 and finished seventh in the Western Conference. An offseason like no other seems to lie ahead for the Spurs. Popovich himself has endured plenty at season\u2019s end, as he grieved the death of his wife, Erin, who died in April after battling a prolonged illness . He did not coach in Games 3, 4 or 5 ( Spurs assistant coach Ettore Messina handled those duties ) vs. Golden State. Popovich has coached the team since 1997-98 and is the longest-tenured coach in the NBA. He will also be coaching Team USA before the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo. Then there is point guard Tony Parker, who is a free agent this summer. He said last summer he hoped to make it an even 20 seasons with the Spurs , which would require the team to re-sign him for three years. Parker willingly gave up his starting role to youngster Dejounte Murray this season and remains open to returning to San Antonio. * DA\u2019s Mailbag:  Could Sixers trade for Leonard?

TNT will televise the second annual NBA Awards , hosted by Anthony Anderson, live on Monday, June 25 at 9 p.m. ET from Barker Hangar in Los Angeles. Robertson (\u201cBig O\u201d) forever changed the game of basketball both on and off the court. On the court, Robertson was the first player in NBA history to average a triple-double (double figures in points, rebounds and assists) for an entire season (1961-1962), and he remains the league\u2019s all-time leader in triple-doubles with 181. As the first big guard to play \u201cpositionless basketball\u201d who could rebound, play defense, distribute the ball and score from the inside and outside, Robertson is widely recognized as one of the best all-around players in the history of the game. Named among the NBA\u2019s 50 greatest players of all time , Robertson\u2019s other career-making individual accomplishments include the NBA Rookie of the Year (1961), NBA MVP (1964), three NBA All-Star Game MVPs and nine All-NBA First Team honors. He and the Milwaukee Bucks won their only NBA championship in 1971 amid 10 combined playoff appearances with the Cincinnati Royals and the Bucks. Among other historic firsts in his career, Robertson led the Crispus Attucks High School basketball team to two consecutive Indiana state championships, becoming the first all African-American  team in the nation to win a state title. Robertson was the first three-time national College Player of the Year while at the University of Cincinnati and a three-time First Team All-American. In 1998, the U.S. Basketball Writers Association renamed its college player of the year award, the Oscar Robertson Trophy\u00ae. He co-captained the undefeated 1960 U.S. Men\u2019s Olympic Basketball team and was part of the first team of NBA players to tour abroad for the U.S. State Department under the Johnson Administration in Poland, Romania, Yugoslavia and Egypt. Off the court, Robertson\u2019s impact on basketball was even more significant. As the first African-American president of any national sports or entertainment labor union, Robertson was the longest-serving president of the National Basketball Players Association from 1965-1974. His anti-trust lawsuit against the NBA in part sought changes in the NBA Draft and players\u2019 movement. The 1976 settlement \u2013 known as the Oscar Robertson Rule \u2013 changed the balance of power in professional sports and ushered in free agency in the NBA and other professional sports. Robertson also co-founded the National Basketball Retired Players Association and served as its first president from 1992-1998, dedicated to improving pension benefits and medical care for an earlier generation of players. For his achievements in both college and professional basketball, Robertson was named \u201cPlayer of the Century\u201d by the National Association of Basketball Coaches in 2000. Last year, 11-time NBA champion, five-time NBA MVP and Hall of Famer Bill Russell received the inaugural Lifetime Achievement Award at the NBA Awards.  He received a Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2011.

In the one-and-done era, the lottery portion of the NBA Draft has been filled with players who logged a single season of college basketball. Lottery picks who redshirted are rare \u2014 Kris Dunn of Providence, who sat out a season because of a shoulder injury, was the last one (the Minnesota Timberwolves took him at No. 5 in the 2016 Draft). Rarer still is a lottery pick who redshirted willingly, who chose to take an unconventional career path, who, in this era of instant gratification, chose to be patient . That\u2019s why Bridges, a 6-foot-7 swingman from Villanova who is projected as a top 10 pick in virtually every mock draft, stands out. When he showed up on campus in 2014, he weighed less than 180 pounds. His jump-shot mechanics needed adjusting. And the competition ahead of him on the Wildcats\u2019 roster was stout \u2014 future NBA players Darrun Hilliard and Josh Hart. None of that seemed to bother Bridges. \u201cI was raised to be patient,\u201d Bridges said. \u201cWhen the coaches brought up the idea [of redshirting], I just knew it was the right thing to do. My body wasn\u2019t ready. I tried to think about my future. I thought the future was more important than the present.\u201d Little did Bridges know how smart that decision would be. Fitting in perfectly with the small-ball system Villanova coach Jay Wright made fashionable, Bridges helped the Wildcats win an NCAA national championship as a freshman and again last March. In 2017, he was the Big East Conference\u2019s co-defensive player of the year as Villanova won the league championship and reached the Sweet 16. In his final season, Bridges won the Julius Erving Award, given to the nation\u2019s best small forward, was a third-team All-American, the Big East tournament MVP and earned a spot on the All-Final Four team. Bridges attributes his ascension and development to Wright and his assistants. \u201c[Wright] never makes you feel comfortable, or like you can relax,\u201d he said. \u201cHe pushes you to be the best player you can be, to be mentally tough.\u201d While all that\u2019s true, the Villanova staff gives just as much credit to Bridges. He saw the need to redshirt, he used his time on the sidelines to improve, and, lastly, continued improving by turning weaknesses into strengths. Additionally, he added size and strength (more than 30 pounds over his career) and accepted coaching, too. \u201cHe got to this point by acquiring a superior work ethic,\u201d said former Villanova assistant Ashley Howard, now the coach at La Salle. \u201cHe developed his shot first. He was a good shooter when he came, but he wasn\u2019t the shooter he was when he left. \u201cHe also added explosiveness and physicality on drives, the ability to play through contact and finish. Now he\u2019s a guy that can drill shots or go through the lane and dunk on people. That was a big part of his physical development.\u201d Though Bridges agreed with the decision to redshirt, the Villanova staff made sure he always knew why. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t an indictment on his game,\u201d said Villanova assistant coach Kyle Neptune. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like he wasn\u2019t good enough. He definitely got his butt kicked sometimes in practice, but he made it tough for other guys at times also. \u201cThrough it all, his confidence never wavered. That\u2019s something very unique about him. He always has the utmost belief in himself. But it\u2019s a silent confidence. \u2026 He\u2019s just always been confident in himself, and secure \u2014 on and off the floor.\u201d The NBA team that drafts Bridges will get a perfect modern-day player with prototypical height and length for a wing position. Plus, he has the ability to space the floor or make defenses pay for over-respecting his jumper, and \u2014 this is a Villanova staple \u2014 a willingness to defend multiple positions. \u201cI think he can guard the one, two or three at the next level,\u201d Neptune said. \u201cHe\u2019s a great anticipator for steals. He can recover and block guys\u2019 shots. He\u2019ll know everything his man\u2019s doing, all his tendencies, because he\u2019ll have studied the scouting report. He picks it up quickly, he retains it, and he knows it.\u201d Bridges has been a bit taken aback by his ascension up the Draft boards. But as Villanova dominated yet another NCAA Tournament, it provided the showcase for not just Bridges, but point guard Jalen Brunson, big man Omari Spellman and shooting guard Donte DiVincenzo. All of these players left for the Draft with eligibility remaining and are projected by many analysts as first-round picks. \u201cLast summer, I wasn\u2019t gearing to be a lottery pick,\u201d Bridges said. \u201cI was just trying to become NBA ready. I was confident, and I worked out as if I was a pro, but I never thought I\u2019d be in this situation. Looking back on that redshirt season, it was the best thing for me. I just had to be patient and put in the work.\u201d * * * Chris Dortch is the editor of the Blue Ribbon College Basketball Yearbook .

On April 5, 2012, then-Orlando Magic coach Stan Van Gundy confirmed a report that had circulated a day earlier that then-Magic star center Dwight Howard wanted him fired . As he stood before the assembled media in Orlando, Van Gundy said he was \u201cuncomfortable with BS\u201d and that he knew Howard had requested to team management that Van Gundy be fired. \u201cWhen it comes out that one of the highest-profile guys in the league has asked his coach to be fired, it\u2019s going to be a story,\u201d Van Gundy said that day in 2012. Moments later, Howard sidled up next to Van Gundy and said: \u201cYeah Stan, we\u2019re not worried about that, right?\u201d Howard says. \u201cThat\u2019s what I just said,\u201d Van Gundy said, taking a sip from the soda he was holding. \u201cWe got to be worried about winning games.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s our main concern right now?\u201d Howard said, after which he wrapped his right arm around Van Gundy. \u201cWe have to stop Carmelo Anthony and the New York Knicks tonight\u201d Van Gundy says before Howard repeats, saying: \u201cAnd the New York Knicks.\u201d https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v In an interview with ESPN\u2019s \u201cThe Jump\u201d yesterday, Howard recalled that day in 2012 and said it was the \u201cworst day of my life.\u201d The Magic ended up losing 96-80 in that April 5 game against the Knicks, marking Orlando\u2019s fifth straight loss. Howard played 39 minutes, scoring eight points (on 4-for-8 shooting), grabbing eight rebounds and blocking three shots. From there, the Magic would close out the 2011-12 season 5-6 and lost 4-1 to the Indiana Pacers in the first round of the playoffs. Van Gundy was fired by the Magic on May 21 (as was then-GM Otis Smith) as Orlando began its process of rebuilding the franchise. On August 21, 2012, Howard was traded to the Los Angeles Lakers in a blockbuster deal also involving the Denver Nuggets, Minnesota Timberwolves and Philadelphia 76ers. After Van Gundy was fired, Magic CEO Alex Martins told the team\u2019s website that Howard never asked him to fire Van Gundy or Smith. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s any surprise that there were challenges in the relationship between Dwight and Stan. But let me say in no uncertain terms that Dwight did not want to be a part of this decision, did not want to make this decision and he never asked me to make this decision,\u201d Martins said then. \u201cYes, their relationship was a challenge, but Dwight Howard never asked me to fire Stan Van Gundy. Over the time that I\u2019ve dealt with Dwight Howard, particularly over this last year, he never asked me to fire Stan Van Gundy.\u201d Van Gundy took two years off from coaching after his firing, but was then named the Detroit Pistons\u2019 coach and president of basketball operations. He was let go from that position last month, going 152-176 over four seasons as Detroit\u2019s coach . In his coaching career, Van Gundy is 523-384 (.577 winning percentage) and led the Magic to The Finals in 2009 . Since the start of the 2012-13 season, the Magic are 157-335 and have had four coaches (Jacque Vaughn, James Borrego, Scott Skiles, Frank Vogel) at the helm.

He just wrapped up his 15th season with the Heat, after he signed a one-year deal to stay in Miami last season . However, Haslem\u2019s role for Miami has steadily diminished over the last three seasons and in 2017-18, he logged career lows in minutes (5.1 per game), points (0.6), rebounds (0.7) and field goal percentage (20.0). Haslem is a free agent this summer and told reporters in Miami he\u2019s not thinking of retiring, but is looking to play somewhere that will afford him a bigger on-court role. Manny Navarro of the Miami Herald has more from Haslem on his future : Haslem said watching a veteran like David West of the Golden State Warriors contribute to that team\u2019s back-to-back championship runs has him thinking he could perhaps do likewise. Dwyane Wade, who is also a Heat stalwart and a free agent this summer, is still weighing whether or not to play a 16th NBA season as well. He recently said he wants to stay with the Heat if he does come back next season. Haslem told Navarro he plans to talk with Wade about what they may do next. Additionally, Haslem said he, Wade and former Heat and current Cleveland Cavaliers star LeBron James spent time together before the start of the 2018 NBA Finals. A potential James return \u2014 he can opt out and become an unrestricted free agent this summer, too \u2014 was not part of the conversation (yet) Haslem said.

It was 1995 and Ujiri, now president of the Toronto Raptors, was playing for the Derby Storm of the British Basketball League. Nurse was coach of the rival Birmingham Bullets. Not yet 30, Nurse had already been on the bench for six years, quickly establishing himself as a coach on the rise. \u201cHis teams were tough,\u201d Ujiri said Thursday as the Raptors officially introduced Nurse as their coach. \u201cThere was always something about the Birmingham team that was different from the whole league. People talked about them that way.\u201d More than two decades on from that initial introduction, Ujiri is hoping Nurse has what it takes to turn Toronto into the talk of the NBA. The ninth head coach in Raptors history, Nurse replaces his former boss, Dwane Casey \u2013 under whom he spent the past five seasons as a Toronto assistant. Casey was fired after the Raptors were swept out of the second round of this year\u2019s playoffs by Cleveland, their third straight playoff defeat at the hands of LeBron James and the Cavs. Ujiri called Nurse \u201ceverything you want in a candidate\u201d and said his new coach, the first he has hired as an NBA executive, is someone who \u201cthinks the game differently.\u201d \u201cHe was outstanding,\u201d Ujiri said. \u201cHe really came out on top. Trying new stuff, being innovative, is who Nick is. You can tell he\u2019s a tactician who really thinks the game.\u201d Nurse called it \u201ca long month\u201d of waiting for a decision following Casey\u2019s dismissal but said he understood why Ujiri needed to take his time. \u201cEven though I\u2019ve been across the gym from him for five years, there\u2019s a lot of detail to go through,\u201d Nurse said. Nurse also gave credit to Casey, who was hired as Detroit\u2019s head coach this week. \u201cWe shared a lot of winning together,\u201d Nurse said. \u201cHe\u2019s a competitive guy, a great professional. I learned a lot from him. You can\u2019t take away the five years we shared.\u201d Toronto went 59-23 this season, the best record in the Eastern Conference and second-best in the NBA behind Houston. Nurse was in charge of the offense, led by All-Star guards DeMar DeRozan and Kyle Lowry. He also engineered a successful overhaul of the game plan before last season as Toronto put increased emphasis on ball movement and 3-point shooting. For the coming season, Nurse said he wants to inject more defensive creativity \u201cso we can try to be ready for more things in the playoffs.\u201d Rex Kalamian, a Raptors assistant alongside Nurse last season, is expected to join the Los Angeles Clippers, leaving Nurse multiple spots to fill on his staff. Nurse said Thursday he has a good idea of what he\u2019s looking for. \u201cI think it\u2019s really important that we get an experienced staff,\u201d he said. \u201cGuys that have been head coaches at some level is important to me. It\u2019s good to know what it\u2019s like to be the decision maker.\u201d There\u2019s also the possibility of new players, with Ujiri acknowledging Toronto has \u201cwork to do\u201d with its roster. Nurse graduated from Northern Iowa and got his first head coaching position at Grand View College when he was only 23. He spent more than a decade in Europe and was an assistant coach for Britain at the 2012 London Olympics. A past G League coach of the year, he\u2019s the only coach to lead two teams to an NBA G League Championship, winning with Iowa in 2011 and Rio Grande in 2013. Nurse\u2019s career has seen its share of stops and opponents, but he still recalls facing Ujiri while with Birmingham. \u201cI remember,\u201d Nurse said, smiling. \u201cHe played really hard.\u201d * * *"},{"id":39955,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/reports-michael-porter-jr-cancels-second-pro-day-due-hip-injury-concerns","date":"2018-06-14","title":"Reports: Michael Porter Jr. (hip) cleared for second pro day","content":" Former Missouri standout Michael Porter Jr. has been cleared for his second pro day in Chicago despite a strained hip, according to Yahoo Sports\u2019 Shams Charania. Porter Jr. was suffering hip spasms so severe Thursday morning that he could not get out of bed. MRI results were clean, however, and he recovered enough that teams were notified they could still evaluate him for medical purposes on Friday. After initially canceling the workout, Porter Jr. received good news as an MRI on his hip came back clean, writes Charania: NBA teams had been invited to bring their own trainers and doctors to evaluate Porter Jr. before the start of the now-cancelled workout, reports Givony : Porter Jr. injured the L-3 and L-4 discs in his spine in his first collegiate game at Missouri and needed a surgery that wiped out most of his only collegiate season. That led to a limited body of work with which to judge Porter Jr. on prior to the Draft: 19 points in 23 minutes of the Nike Hoop Summit in 2017 and three games at Missouri (10 points and 6.7 rebounds per game in 17.7 minutes per game). Despite the change in Porter Jr.\u2019s pro day schedule, his camp seems comfortable with what he has shown NBA executives, writes Givony : Porter, one of the top high school recruits in 2017, says NBA teams will ultimately see a position-less player who dealt with the adversity of a major injury and got himself ready to become an NBA star. \u201cIt\u2019s been challenging, for sure, but I\u2019m at 100 percent,\u2019\u2019 Porter told reporters recently. \u201cI feel better than ever, actually. That injury actually happened a couple of years ago and it got worse. I feel pain-free and better than I have in a long time. \u201cIt was a very minimally invasive surgery. They just had to fix the discs, take about 10 percent off that nerve and they said, after I got an MRI, that it has healed fully,\u2019\u2019 he added. \u201cI just have to keep up with my (leg) extensions, my core exercises and stretching. I have a great physical therapist and team working with me through the draft, and they\u2019re making me feel better every day. The recent MRI was to see how it had fully healed.

Two years ago, the combo guard was the Big East co-defensive player of the year. In 2017-18, he won the honor outright. That means something, because the award is voted on by league\u2019s coaches, the ones who watch countless hours of film. Thomas is such an impactful defender, that aspect of his game almost overshadows the fact he\u2019s every bit as good on the other end of the floor. Statistics, both advanced and conventional, tell the tale. His effective field-goal percentage, which takes into account 2- and 3-point shots, was 62.9, 38th in the country. And his true shooting percentage, which adds the third component of free-throw shooting, was 65.0, 39th in the country. In his final season, Thomas was fourth in the Big East in field-goal percentage (.538), 11th in 3-point percentage (.411) and also shot nearly 80 percent from the free-throw line. A player shoots that well, there\u2019s little doubt he possesses great, or at least repeatable, mechanics, and Thomas does. But equally important was his shot selection. \u201cI can probably count on one hand the number of questionable shots he took the whole year,\u201d Creighton coach Greg McDermott says. \u201cAt times, I wish he would have taken a couple more chances. He had the ability to make guarded shots. But to his credit, he played within our system. If one of his teammates had a great shot, he\u2019d turn down a good shot to make sure they were able to get that better opportunity.\u201d Thomas\u2019 ability to get the ball in the basket wasn\u2019t a secret by any means, but it might have been overshadowed a bit, especially on a team that included guard Marcus Foster, who averaged 19.8 points (to Thomas\u2019 15.8), finished fifth in the Big East in scoring and was second in shot attempts among the league\u2019s top 30 scorers. \u201cI think his defense got everybody\u2019s attention,\u201d McDermott says. \u201cBut once you start to dig into the numbers a little and watch a little bit of film, you begin to see how he\u2019s getting his points and how efficient he is. I think that\u2019s part of the reason he\u2019s a hot name in the draft right now.\u201d Creighton assistant coach Preston Murphy agrees. \u201cWhen you play for coach McDermott, he gives you a lot of freedom,\u201d Murphy says. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t put restraints on you. Normally a player of Khryi\u2019s caliber, coach gives him the freedom to shoot the basketball. But his [prudent] shot selection, his ability to find teammates, that mindset is very unique in this day and age.\u201d Scouts might nitpick Thomas because of his size\u20146-2.5 without shoes\u2014but his near 6-11 wingspan is a great equalizer on defense. So is his anticipation. \u201cThose are some of the things he has that you can\u2019t teach,\u201d Murphy says. \u201cHe\u2019s got really quick hands. He can beat guys to spots while making split-second decisions. He\u2019s tremendous at it.\u201d There are numbers to prove that, too. Several of the Big East\u2019s leading scorers didn\u2019t have a lot of fun when they played Creighton, because, whether they were a point guard or a power forward, they were defended by Thomas and held below their season scoring averages. \u201cAgainst a Villanova, you could put him on [national player of the year point guard] Jalen Brunson or [Julius Erving Award winner small forward] Mikal Bridges, who\u2019s 6-8, or anybody in between,\u201d McDermott said. \u201cHe would chase [St. John\u2019s guard] Shamorie Ponds, who had the ball in his hands all the time, or guard [Butler\u2019s] Kelan martin or [Xavier\u2019s] Trevon Bluiett, who they\u2019d run off a million screens. \u201cBesides having the versatility to defend several positions, Khyri\u2019s got the versatility to defend a lot of different actions. Sometimes, it\u2019s as simple as keeping the ball in front of you. Other times, it\u2019s being there on the catch, or dealing with a lot of screening action. That takes vision, and it takes anticipation, and Khryi prepared himself for all of it by watching tons of film. The more you know what\u2019s possibly coming, the better you\u2019re prepared for it.\u201d Another thing Thomas is prepared for is how he\u2019ll be utilized at the next level. As well as he shoots, he\u2019s not likely to be a team\u2019s No. 1 scoring option. He\u2019ll serve a utility function, playing more than one position, and, especially, guarding more than one. That\u2019s why Thomas\u2019 name has turned up as a first round pick in numerous mock drafts. \u201cMost kids don\u2019t understand that most guys that go into the NBA are going to be role players,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cThat\u2019s not Khyri. He\u2019s played a role at Creighton ever since he\u2019s been here. It started with defense. He understands the concept of team and has a great understanding of who he is and what his role is. That\u2019s what makes him very attractive to the NBA.\u201d Chris Dortch is the editor of the  Blue Ribbon College Basketball Yearbook .

He expects perfection from everyone, but especially his better ones. That\u2019s why Landry Shamet earned the nickname \u201cOne a Day\u201d early in his career. It\u2019s also why he\u2019s about to become a first-round pick in next week\u2019s NBA Draft . Shamet came to Wichita State in 2015 as a 6-foot-4 scoring guard, the highest-rated recruit in Marshall\u2019s then nine years as coach. Shamet arrived with every intention to play with the Shockers\u2019 future NBA backcourt of Fred VanVleet and Ron Baker. * Synergy Stats: Landry Shamet scouting report But a stress fracture suffered three games into his freshman season forced Shamet to take a medical redshirt. If Shamet couldn\u2019t play with VanVleet and Baker, at least took notes on their every move in their final season. \u201cI went there to play with those two guys and to contribute to a great team,\u201d Shamet said. \u201cWho knows what would have happened if I\u2019d played? But sitting on the bench [after his injury], I had a different perspective. As a freshman, you get to play through your mistakes. Once I had that aspect taken away from me, I had to adjust.  \u201cThe amount of information I gained from just watching Fred and Ron was incredible. How they approached every day. How they handled situations. One game I focused on Ron\u2019s on-ball defense and how he fought through every screen. Another game I watched how Fred went through his progressions and how he made decisions. But the biggest thing I learned was pace. Nobody ever sped Fred up. Ron was the same way.\u201d Armed with those observations, Shamet \u2014 who in his redshirt freshman season became one of the country\u2019s best 3-point shooters \u2014 was ready when Marshall asked him to switch to point guard in 2017. The WSU staff had recruited Shamet with every expectation he could handle the point. \u201cInitially you had to really like his size and his ability to handle the ball and be a legitimate scoring point guard,\u201d says former assistant coach Steve Forbes, now East Tennessee State\u2019s coach. Forbes recruited Shamet, but never coached him. \u201cThere are not very many 6-4 guys out there that can play the one and score the ball like he could. Those things jumped out at us, along with his athleticism. Once you got to know him, you learned he was very focused at a young age. He had tremendous work ethic. He wanted to be a great player.\u201d Shamet\u2019s thick skin allowed him to accept being coached hard. That came in handy playing for Marshall, who didn\u2019t want Shamet switching to the point at the expense of his offense. \u201cWe just harped,\u201d Marshall says. \u201cWe still need you to score. Any time you have an open jumper, you better burn it. We need you to be aggressive off the bounce. Only now, you\u2019re also our facilitator. Lucky for us, he\u2019s very cerebral, and he already knew [the point guard position] like the back of his hand. But there were adjustments he had to make. \u201cEarly on, he\u2019d have a beautiful floor game, but there always seemed to be one mistake that didn\u2019t fit.\u201d https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v Former WSU assistant Greg Heiar remembers those mistakes. \u201cThere\u2019d be a pass he\u2019d throw five rows up into the stands,\u201d says Heiar, now an LSU assistant coach. \u201cAnd then the next day, we\u2019d go into film, where coach Marshall would point it out. \u2018There\u2019s your one mistake.\u2019 \u201d Shamet laughs at the recollection of those film sessions. \u201cThey\u2019d call me \u2018One a Day\u2019\u201d Shamet said. \u201cLike the vitamin. That was my nickname. Whether it was practice or a game, we\u2019d be in film, and coach Marshall would say, \u201cit\u2019s like you\u2019re a vitamin. You\u2019ve got to make one stupid or bad play a day.\u2019 But that was one of coach Marshall\u2019s best qualities. \u201cHe expected as perfect a game as you could play. We could beat a team by 20 and the next day in film, he\u2019d say to us, \u2018you think you\u2019re an [NCAA] tournament team? Well, you\u2019re not.\u2019 We were never comfortable. We could never get complacent at Wichita State.\u201d  In his first season, Shamet made the All-Missouri Valley Conference first team and was the league\u2019s freshman of the year. Marshall\u2019s daily highlights of Shamet\u2019s miscues had a positive effect \u2014 Shamet finished 13th in the country in assist-to-turnover ratio (3.00) and third among freshmen, just behind UCLA\u2019s Lonzo Ball (3.08). Just as important \u2014 and as Marshall demanded \u2014 Shamet\u2019s offense didn\u2019t suffer. He shot .439 from 3-point range and set a team freshman record for 3-poiners in a season (72). A switch to the tougher American Athletic Conference last season didn\u2019t slow down Shamet. Nor did another stress fracture that required surgery to repair and cost him an offseason\u2019s worth of workouts. Shamet led the AAC in assists (5.2) and assist-to-turnover ratio (2.5) while ranking 13th in the NCAA in 3-point percentage (.442). Defenders found it hard to check him because, with his elite athleticism, Shamet was just as likely to attack the rim as shoot a 3-pointer. His true shooting percentage was 65.5 percent, 30th in the nation (per kenpom.com). It wasn\u2019t any surprise that after the season, Shamet thought he was ready to enter the Draft. Marshall couldn\u2019t disagree. \u201cFred and Ron, those two jokers are as tough and cerebral and big-time winners as you can find,\u201d Marshall says. \u201cLandry\u2019s not far behind them in those categories. Right now, he might not be as tough and strong. But he\u2019s more bouncy and longer, probably faster. \u201cHe came here as a jump shooter. That\u2019s what he does best. But he developed into a lead guard, a guy who can run a team and distribute the ball. In terms of the kind of person he is, he\u2019s a very smart and personable kid. You just can\u2019t find a better person and representative for your program. He\u2019s going to do all the right things.\u201d Little wonder that, when asked to provide an NBA comparison of himself, Shamet doesn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cIdeally, I\u2019d like to be like [former Virginia star and 2016-17 Kia Rookie of the Year] Malcolm Brogdon,\u201d he says. \u201cAs far as being a two-way threat, offensively and defensively, being an intelligent, cerebral player. That\u2019s what I\u2019d like to be. \u201cI think a strength of mine will be walking in the door being able to play the one or the two, and someone who\u2019s going to give you effort on a consistent basis.\u201d After seeing a higher level of athlete this season, Heiar thinks Shamet could have done the same things in the SEC he did in the AAC or MVC. And, he\u2019s certain Shamet\u2019s versatility will lead to a lengthy NBA career. \u201cI think he\u2019s a multi-position player,\u201d Heiar said. \u201cHe can play both guard spots at the next level. He\u2019s a better defender than people give him credit for, and he\u2019s going to continue to get stronger and stronger because of the resources he\u2019s about to have. \u201cBut, and this is also huge, he\u2019s been coached. He\u2019s been coached right. He\u2019s been coached how to win, and he\u2019s been coached on both ends of the court. That\u2019s one of the biggest bonuses playing for coach Marshall. You don\u2019t pick up short cuts or bad habits when you\u2019ve been under him for three years, like Landry was. He\u2019s a kid that\u2019s ready to do good things at the next level.\u201d * * * Chris Dortch is the editor of the Blue Ribbon College Basketball Yearbook .

The Raptors\u2019 hiring of Nurse was also reported by Ryan Wolstat of the Toronto Sun . Nurse, 50, joined the franchise five years ago and was a longtime assistant under former Raptors coach Dwane Casey. Nurse spent a decade coaching in Europe and won to championships and a coach of the year award in the British Basketball League. He also won a pair of titles in the G League with two different teams and was coach of the year there, too. Nurse was tasked with overseeing the team\u2019s offense alongside Casey and played a key role in Toronto\u2019s overhaul last season.

The Celtics guard on Tuesday deferred when asked about the prospect of the team pursuing James this summer. The 33-year-old James has a player option to remain in Cleveland next season but could opt for free agency. \u201cIn this business, I\u2019ve kind of experienced it all and I\u2019ve seen a lot, so we\u2019ll see what management decides,\u201d Irving said when asked if he would be open to playing alongside James again. Irving was drafted No. 1 overall by the Cavaliers in 2011 and played three seasons with James, from 2014-17. The duo made three straight trips to the NBA Finals, winning a championship in 2016. \u201cObviously, it\u2019s a business at the end of the day,\u201d Irving said. \u201cOwnership and management, they\u2019re going to feel what\u2019s best for our future and I\u2019m fully supportive of (them). We\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d Irving was traded to Boston last August and averaged 24.4 points and 5.1 assists over 60 games in his first season with the Celtics. The five-time All-Star missed the last 15 games of the regular season and the entirety of the playoffs after undergoing left knee surgery. \u201cTo kind of have something like that unexpected, it was hurtful, because just a lot of what I wanted to accomplish with our guys and individually as one of the leaders of the team,\u201d Irving said. Irving also had a separate surgery in May to repair a deviated septum, a procedure that kept him away from the sidelines for Game 7 of the Celtics\u2019 Eastern Conference Finals series against James and the Cavaliers. \u201cObviously, it wasn\u2019t going to feel the same (not being there), but I was just so proud of our guys and what they did,\u201d Irving said. \u201cThey passed a lot of expectations, and I couldn\u2019t be more proud of them.\u201d Cleveland beat Boston 87-79 in Game 7 to send James to his eighth consecutive Finals series. The Cavaliers were swept by the Golden State Warriors, dropping James\u2019 personal Finals record to 3-6. The Celtics expect Irving to be completely recovered by the start of training camp in the fall. \u201cI\u2019m feeling good,\u201d Irving said. \u201cIt was going to be a process coming back, just making sure I\u2019m healthy enough for September. Just trying not to push it too hard.\u201d"},{"id":39990,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/2018-summer-league-schedule-official-release","date":"2018-06-12","title":"ESPN and NBA TV to bring fans all 82 games from MGM Resorts NBA Summer League 2018","content":"NEW YORK \u2014 The matchup between the potential top two picks in NBA Draft 2018 presented by State Farm highlights the 12-day, 82-game schedule for MGM Resorts NBA Summer League 2018 in Las Vegas .

(AP) \u2014 For the second straight year, throngs of Golden State Warriors fans turned out for a victory parade to celebrate a team some are calling an NBA dynasty and got a treat when several players got off their buses to mingle with the crowd. Hundreds of thousands of fans in gold and blue and holding signs that read \u201cDynasty\u201d and \u201cBack to Back Champions\u201d waved from behind barriers set up along the route in downtown Oakland, California, as the Warriors rode by in an open, double-decker bus. Stephen Curry, NBA Finals MVP Kevin Durant and the rest of the Warriors, who won their third title in four years last week, took turns raising the Larry O\u2019Brien Trophy for the roaring crowd, which officials said could reach up to 1 million fans. Officials had promised an \u201cinteractive\u201d parade with some fans able to ask the players questions and giant TV screens for the crowd to see them and hear their answers as the moved along the route. But there were no screens and when Klay Thompson used a megaphone to say hello, his greeting was drowned out by the cheering crowd. Curry was able to connect in a different way when he opened a bottle of champagne, shook it and sprayed the crowd with it. He briefly got off the bus and walked up to fans, throwing T-shirts, bracelets and other souvenirs to them and then holding the trophy up as dozens of cameras surrounded him. Curry wore a large sun hat and under it a \u201cRUN TMC\u201d baseball cap in honor of Tim Hardaway, Mitch Richmond and Chris Mullin, the namesakes for the Don Nelson-coached Warriors teams during the 1989-90 and 1990-91 seasons. \u201cWe never really imagined that we would be having one parade, let alone two and now three,\u201d Curry said during a short live interview before the parade started. \u201cBut this is for you guys! We are going to try and get greedy and go get some more.\u201d JaVale McGee, Nick Young and Jordan Bell posed for photographs and also mingled with fans, even hugging some of them, energizing the pumped up crowd. Even coach Steve Kerr joined in on the fun and walked up to fans to sign autographs. \u201cI\u2019m just excited to be here with these guys\u201d McGee, who was wearing only shorts, told KGO-TV. \u201cOur fans are amazing! All the love that they show is just beautiful.\u201d Young, also just in shorts during a very warm afternoon, ran up and down the street, giving fans high-fives. He then took a broom from a fan and posed for photographs as dozens of people took pictures with their phones. The NBA champions have gone back-to-back, beating LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers 108-85 last week to finish off a four-game sweep of The NBA Finals in the fourth consecutive meeting between these clubs.  Melissa Marzan, 25, of Santa Cruz said she doesn\u2019t take the Warriors\u2019 winning streak for granted. \u201cWe all know it\u2019s not going to happen forever, so for now we\u2019re just going to enjoy it,\u201d she said. Oakland resident Jasmine Culp, 36, painted her lips blue and dressed in a sparkling golden sequined dress, sash, and blue-gold feather accessories to attend the parade with her three children, Jonavon, Jewel, and Cypher. \u201cIt\u2019s our new family tradition,\u201d she said. \u201cWe love to kick off the summer here and we love to dress up.\u201d Culp acknowledges it could be the family\u2019s last parade in Oakland, since the Warriors plan to move to San Francisco next year. \u201cIt\u2019s sad to see a big part of our city move away,\u201d she said. \u201cNot going to want to travel over the bridge to see them, but we will.\u201d Adriana Carnecer of San Francisco said she is a lifelong Warriors fan and is excited the team will be closer to home.

(AP) \u2014 Warriors general manager Bob Myers expects swift negotiations to re-sign two-time reigning NBA Finals MVP Kevin Durant and coach Steve Kerr. Durant could sign for as long as four years and about $160 million, and Myers is prepared to give him \u201cwhatever he wants.\u201d Durant has said all along he wants to stay put, especially after winning a pair of championships in his first two seasons with Golden State. \u201cSometimes you don\u2019t negotiate. I\u2019d love to have him for 10 years. Kevin Durant, look what he did for us last year, he did us a great service,\u201d Myers said. \u201cHe\u2019s earned the right to sign whatever deal he wants. I just want him to sign a deal. But want him to be happy and want him to know that we want him as long as he wants to be here. He\u2019s earned that, to kind of lay out the terms. He can do whatever he wants. That shouldn\u2019t be a long negotiation. Our goal, to be honest, is to try to keep the whole thing together, so that\u2019s the pieces of the puzzle we\u2019ve got to try to figure out.\u201d Kerr has one year remaining on his original five-year contract, so he would receive a multiyear extension \u2013 and Kerr wants to coach Golden State for the long haul, perhaps for another decade if he can. He doesn\u2019t expect any difficulties in getting a deal worked out. \u201cWe\u2019ll get that done pretty quick, I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be much to it,\u201d Kerr said. Myers wants to keep as much of the core of the two-time defending champions intact while also realizing the Warriors will be a younger team without the same veteran presence as the group that just swept LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers to finish the finals Friday. Working to try to extend the contracts of Draymond Green and Klay Thompson could be discussed as well. \u201cSure, guys have proven they can win so you want to keep that group together,\u201d Myers said. \u201cI have no idea how that\u2019ll play out. It\u2019s a lot of different conversations that have to take place and if that\u2019s something that we want to look into I\u2019m sure we could have those \u2013 Klay\u2019s got another year, Draymond\u2019s got two more. Kevin\u2019s really the free agent we have to focus on.\u201d After a regular season that was anything but steady, with Stephen Curry limited by injuries to 51 regular-season games, losing seven of 10 late, all four All-Stars out at the same time for health reasons, the Warriors on Tuesday will again host that victory parade in downtown Oakland they planned for all along \u2013 their third in four years. Kerr stayed healthy and on the bench while continuing to deal with symptoms stemming from a pair of back surgeries following the 2015 title. \u201cI\u2019m sure if you\u2019re around our players and talk to them, they make no bones about it, they love playing for him and they love going through this journey with him,\u201d Myers said of Kerr. Key reserve David West is contemplating retirement, telling Kerr and Myers during exit interviews he will take some time to decide. West said after the title clincher that the team went through things behind the scenes that would be surprising if revealed. \u201cI don\u2019t know if anything would really blow your mind but it was a difficult season and there were lots of moments where it became more difficult,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was anything unusual given the state of our team, what we\u2019ve been through and the length of this journey. Nothing to me was that, like, shocking but yeah we went through some stuff. \u2026 For sure this was the toughest of the four (years).\u201d Myers also downplayed any tension or turmoil that took place privately. \u201cCertain challenges, some were apparent, some not,\u201d Myers said. Kerr plans to take it easy for the next several months and not work much as Myers handles the contracts and money, while leaving summer league coaching duties to Willie Green. It\u2019s still sinking in for Kerr just how much success the Warriors have had during this four-year stretch since he became coach ahead of the 2014-15 season. \u201cI never could have envisioned this. I know when I took this job I thought we could be really good,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cI could never have dreamt of three titles in four years.

Durant could sign for as long as four years and about $160 million, and Myers is prepared to give him \u201dwhatever he wants.\u201d Durant has said all along he wants to stay put, especially after winning a pair of championships in his first two seasons with Golden State. \u201dSometimes you don\u2019t negotiate. I\u2019d love to have him for 10 years. Kevin Durant, look what he did for us last year, he did us a great service,\u201d Myers said. \u201dHe\u2019s earned the right to sign whatever deal he wants. I just want him to sign a deal. But want him to be happy and want him to know that we want him as long as he wants to be here. He\u2019s earned that, to kind of lay out the terms. He can do whatever he wants. That shouldn\u2019t be a long negotiation. Our goal, to be honest, is to try to keep the whole thing together, so that\u2019s the pieces of the puzzle we\u2019ve got to try to figure out.\u201d Kerr has one year remaining on his original five-year contract, so he would receive a multiyear extension \u2013 and Kerr wants to coach Golden State for the long haul, perhaps for another decade if he can. He doesn\u2019t expect any difficulties in getting a deal worked out. \u201dWe\u2019ll get that done pretty quick, I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be much to it,\u201d Kerr said. Myers wants to keep as much of the core of the two-time defending champions intact while also realizing the Warriors will be a younger team without the same veteran presence as the group that just swept LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers to finish the finals Friday. Working to try to extend the contracts of Draymond Green and Klay Thompson could be discussed as well. \u201dSure, guys have proven they can win so you want to keep that group together,\u201d Myers said. \u201dI have no idea how that\u2019ll play out. It\u2019s a lot of different conversations that have to take place and if that\u2019s something that we want to look into I\u2019m sure we could have those \u2013 Klay\u2019s got another year, Draymond\u2019s got two more. Kevin\u2019s really the free agent we have to focus on.\u201d After a regular season that was anything but steady, with Stephen Curry limited by injuries to 51 regular-season games, losing seven of 10 late, all four All-Stars out at the same time for health reasons, the Warriors on Tuesday will again host that victory parade in downtown Oakland they planned for all along \u2013 their third in four years. Kerr stayed healthy and on the bench while continuing to deal with symptoms stemming from a pair of back surgeries following the 2015 title. \u201dI\u2019m sure if you\u2019re around our players and talk to them, they make no bones about it, they love playing for him and they love going through this journey with him,\u201d Myers said of Kerr. Key reserve David West is contemplating retirement, telling Kerr and Myers during exit interviews he will take some time to decide. West said after the title clincher that the team went through things behind the scenes that would be surprising if revealed. \u201dI don\u2019t know if anything would really blow your mind but it was a difficult season and there were lots of moments where it became more difficult,\u201d Kerr said. \u201dI didn\u2019t think it was anything unusual given the state of our team, what we\u2019ve been through and the length of this journey. Nothing to me was that, like, shocking but yeah we went through some stuff. \u2026 For sure this was the toughest of the four (years).\u201d Myers also downplayed any tension or turmoil that took place privately. \u201dCertain challenges, some were apparent, some not,\u201d Myers said. Kerr plans to take it easy for the next several months and not work much as Myers handles the contracts and money, while leaving summer league coaching duties to Willie Green. It\u2019s still sinking in for Kerr just how much success the Warriors have had during this four-year stretch since he became coach ahead of the 2014-15 season. \u201dI never could have envisioned this. I know when I took this job I thought we could be really good,\u201d Kerr said. \u201dI could never have dreamt of three titles in four years. It\u2019s pretty incredible to be a part of the group and the organization.\u201d"},{"id":39975,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-gregg-popovich-kawhi-leonard-trying-meet","date":"2018-06-12","title":"Report: Gregg Popovich, Kawhi Leonard trying to meet","content":" A resolution could take place between the Spurs and their estranged superstar as early as this week. According to Jabari Young of the San Antonio Express-News , Spurs coach Gregg Popovich and All-Star forward Kawhi Leonard are attempting to arrange a meeting in hopes of repairing the issues that may exist between the former NBA Finals MVP and the only franchise for which he has played. Leonard played in just nine games for San Antonio in the 2017-18 campaign due to a quad injury he initially suffered in Game 1 of the 2017 Western Conference finals . The two-time Kia Defensive Player of the Year\u2019s absence was especially notable late in the season, when he went to New York to continue rehab and chose not to be with the team during its playoff run. San Antonio was defeated 4-1 in the first round of the playoffs by eventual-champion Golden State. The tension surrounding the situation intensified when, after opting to not be with the team for rehab reasons, Leonard was spotted three weeks later attending a Dodgers game in Los Angeles. San Antonio is hoping to regain the usual good footing it holds with its stars in order to maintain the standard of excellence they have maintained since drafting Tim Duncan No. 1 overall in 1997. The Spurs had won at least 50 games in every season until 2017-18, when they went 47-35 and finished seventh in the Western Conference. Of further concern is Leonard\u2019s contract status. The two-time All-Star can enter unrestricted free agency in 2019 if he does not sign a contract extension with the Spurs this summer. * * *"},{"id":39980,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/detroit-pistons-dwane-casey-head-coach-release","date":"2018-06-11","title":"Detroit Pistons name Dwane Casey as head coach","content":"DETROIT, Mich. \u2014 The Detroit Pistons announced Monday an agreement with Dwane Casey to join the organization as Head Coach.

We\u2019re getting to work right away on the things that will make us all successful.\u201d Casey, 61, has served as a head coach, associate head coach or assistant coach in the NBA for 23 of the past 24 years. He has coached in two NBA Finals (1996 and 2011) and three NBA All-Star games (1996, 1998 and 2018). Casey most recently served as head coach of the Toronto Raptors from 2011-2018 where he compiled a 320-238 (.573) regular-season record and led the Raptors to a franchise-record five consecutive playoff appearances, including a trip to the 2016 Eastern Conference Finals. The all-time winningest coach in Raptors history, Casey led Toronto to the franchise\u2019s first 50-win season in 2015-16, recorded 50-plus wins in each of the last three seasons and posted a franchise-record 59 wins and the top seed in the Eastern Conference in 2017-18. Toronto won four Atlantic Division titles during Casey\u2019s tenure. He was named Eastern Conference Coach of the Month five times, and last February, became the first coach in Raptors history to be selected to coach in the NBA All-Star game. Prior to his appointment with Toronto, he served as head coach of the Minnesota Timberwolves from 2005-07. Casey\u2019s 2005-06 squad finished in the NBA\u2019s top 10 in fewest average points per game and lowest opponent field goal percentage. Casey began his NBA career as an assistant coach with the Seattle Supersonics where he served from 1994-2005 under NBA head coaches George Karl, Paul Westphal and Nate McMillan. Promoted to associate head coach in November 2000, nine of his teams in Seattle finished above .500 with five winning 50 or more games. The 1996 squad won the Western Conference Championship after finishing the regular season with a franchise record 64 victories. He also spent three seasons (2008-11) as an assistant with Dallas under Rick Carlisle where he directed the club\u2019s defense and helped lead the Mavericks to the 2011 NBA Championship. Dallas posted a 162-84 (.659) mark during that span, winning 50 or more games in each of his three seasons with the team. His defensive unit held opponents to 96.0 points per game (6th in the NBA) and .450 percent shooting from the field (8th in the NBA) during the 2010-11 regular season. In 14 seasons as an NBA assistant, Casey\u2019s teams registered a 689-427 (.617) mark with eight campaigns of 50 or more wins. His teams qualified for the playoffs in 11 of those 14 seasons. Prior to the NBA, Casey spent five seasons as a head coach in the Japanese Basketball League and worked with the Japanese national team. In the summer of 1998, he helped to guide Japan to its first appearance in the FIBA World Championship, which marked a first for Japan in over 30 years. A native of Morganfield, KY, Casey played collegiately at the University of Kentucky. During his junior season, the Wildcats amassed 30-2 record and captured the 1978 NCAA Championship. As a senior, he was named team captain and won Kentucky\u2019s all-academic award. Casey earned a degree in business administration in 1979. He and his wife, Brenda, have a daughter, Justine and a son, Zachary.

In Detroit, it would be an accomplishment if Casey can simply get the Pistons into the playoffs. The Pistons hired the NBA coach of the year finalist Monday, hoping he can help the three-time NBA championship franchise regularly reach the postseason and eventually compete again for titles. \u201cDwane is one of the most successful and highly respected coaches in our league,\u201d Pistons owner Tom Gores said. \u201cHe\u2019s a great communicator and a leader who will connect with our players and accelerate their growth. Having spent many hours with Dwane over the last few weeks, I\u2019m confident he is the right person to get us to the next level.\u201d A month after being fired by the Raptors , Casey agreed to a five-year deal to become head coach of the Pistons, two people familiar with the situation told The Associated Press on Monday. The people spoke on condition of anonymity because the team had not announced the move, which was first reported by ESPN. Casey led Toronto to a team-record 59 wins this year and helped the franchise earn the top seed in the Eastern Conference for the first time, a performance that won him coach of the year honors from his peers at the National Basketball Coaches Association. He had one year remaining on a three-year, $18 million dollar extension when he was fired shortly after Toronto was swept by the Cleveland Cavaliers. He was 320-238 in seven seasons and is Toronto\u2019s winningest coach. The Pistons said Casey has already started work, including meetings with players, and will be introduced at a news conference next week. Detroit had been looking for a coach for more than month since firing Stan Van Gundy , who was also its president of basketball operations. Michigan coach John Beilein was a finalist for the job before withdrawing his name from consideration last week and San Antonio Spurs assistant Ime Udoka also was a candidate. \u201cI\u2019m confident that this team has the pieces in place to compete at a very high level,\u201d Casey said. \u201cThere is a lot of talent, a solid core and some exciting young players eager to get better. We\u2019re getting to work right away on the things that will make us all successful.\u201d Casey certainly has work to do. The Pistons have made the playoffs only once in nine years after advancing at least to the Eastern Conference finals six straight years, winning the 2004 NBA title and falling a victory short of repeating as champions in 2005. They do not appear to have much flexibility to make significant changes this offseason. Detroit acquired Blake Griffin in a blockbuster trade this past season and that wasn\u2019t enough to push Detroit into the playoffs. An injury to point guard Reggie Jackson derailed what looked like a promising season. If healthy, the Pistons do potentially have an intriguing nucleus with Griffin, Jackson and Andre Drummond. \u201cIn our meetings he displayed great insight into what this roster can accomplish, and great passion about our city and the team\u2019s role in bringing people together,\u201d Gores said. \u201cHe\u2019s an outstanding man with impressive character. He embodies our culture and will be a great representative for our franchise.\u201d The 61-year-old Casey is getting his third shot to lead an NBA team. He coached the Minnesota Timberwolves for a little more than one season, going 53-69. He also has experience in the league as an assistant with Dallas and Seattle. Casey, who is from Morganfield, Ky., played for the Wildcats and helped them win the 1978 NCAA title and began his coaching career the next year as a graduate assistant under Joe B. Hall. He later back to campus to work as an assistant for Eddie Sutton. He has five years of coaching experience in Japan and has spent time around the game in Europe. Under Casey, the Raptors won four Atlantic Division titles and advanced to the playoffs in five consecutive seasons. But Toronto couldn\u2019t get past Cleveland, losing to LeBron James and the Cavs in each of the past three playoffs, getting swept this year and last year. Detroit moved into a new downtown arena last season, but with the exception of some brief success after trading for Griffin, the team didn\u2019t create much buzz. The Pistons are still looking to hire someone to head basketball operation. They did bring in Ed Stefanski as a senior executive."},{"id":39994,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/morning-tip-lebron-james-future-cleveland-cavaliers-not-out-question","date":"2018-06-11","title":"Tall task of keeping LeBron James, improving roster awaits Cleveland Cavaliers","content":" The Month of LeBron is under way. (As long as it\u2019s just a month. I\u2019d like to go to Martha\u2019s Vineyard in August. Never been. Hear it\u2019s great.) Hopefully, a month from now, we\u2019ll know what Decision 3.0 turned out to be. Will LeBron James stay in Cleveland, or again seek greener pastures?  Having been turned into cole slaw by the Golden State Warriors in The Finals , and with the Boston Celtics and Philadelphia 76ers coming on like freight trains in the Eastern Conference, the Cavaliers don\u2019t look like a good bet going forward. Their 4-0 Finals loss to Golden State followed a regular season in which James expended as much energy as he has at any point during his championship window, with a team that had to be re-imagined at the trade deadline just to make the playoffs. Does anyone doubt that this was the least talented of the eight consecutive Eastern Conference teams that James has led to The Finals? This may have been the least talented team he\u2019s been on since the one he carried to his first Finals appearance \u2014 which also got swept in Cleveland, that time by the San Antonio Spurs in 2007 . * Aschburner:  What might LeBron do next? James, of course, is a lightning rod no matter what he does. If he sidesteps a question, he\u2019s disingenuous. If he answers honestly, as he did when he said that the Warriors had more talent than his Cavs, he\u2019s accused of throwing teammates under the bus. But the challenge for Cavs GM Koby Altman is obvious: he must remake the roster yet again, without any assurance that James will stay even if he does. The usual suspects have been lined up, starting with the Houston Rockets, featuring his longtime close friend Chris Paul. The Rockets had the Warriors dead to rights before Paul pulled his hamstring near the end of Game 5 of the Western Conference finals. Paul had just taken over down the stretch of both Game 4 and Game 5 to deliver wins. There\u2019s not much doubt here that if he hadn\u2019t gotten hurt, the Rockets would have dethroned the Warriors , and we\u2019d all be writing \u201chow could the Warriors not have won with all that talent?\u201d pieces. The Los Angeles Lakers, of course, are always in the discussion. And now, they have both salary cap room and a front office \u2014 in team president Magic Johnson and GM Rob Pelinka \u2014 that was hand-picked by owner Jeanie Buss to be able to close the deal with free agents of James\u2019 magnitude. The 76ers are in the unenviable and unexpected position of having to conduct a GM search less than two weeks before the Draft and three weeks before the start of free agency . But they have All-Star Joel Embiid and phenom Ben Simmons, a lot of terrific role players and a respected coach in Brett Brown. They should still be in the mix for James or anyone else. There are, also, your assorted Spurs and Celtics scenarios for a James Acquisition, along with the fever dreams of the New York Knicks\u2019 Enes Kanter . But, there is another possibility \u2014 one that never seems to gain much traction when it comes to James and his future. Is there something in the immutable laws of the universe to keep James from recruiting people to come to play with him in Cleveland to keep the party going? Despite Boston\u2019s formidable roster \u2014 which will only get stronger next season with the returns of Kyrie Irving and Gordon Hayward to the core group that lost to the Cavs in Game 7 of the East finals \u2014 and Philly\u2019s obvious promise, the East still provides an easier path to June than the Western Conference does. None of the Toronto Raptors, Washinton Wizards and even Indiana Pacers \u2014 who gave the Cavs all they wanted in the first round \u2014 is fear-inducing. Compare this with the West, which starts with the leviathan in the Bay and a fiercely competitive Rockets team that is obsessed with taking the Warriors down. That\u2019s followed, in no particular order, by the Utah Jazz, which has an electric superstar in the making in rookie Donovan Mitchell, a one-man shutdown defense in Rudy Gobert, role players galore and a first-rate coaching staff and front office. San Antonio is there, too, and must figure out the Kawhi Leonard mess, to be sure, but hasn\u2019t forgotten how to build a championship contender. The New Orleans Pelicans took a big step up behind Anthony Davis this season despite losing All-Star DeMarcus Cousins to injury midway through the 2017-18 campaign. James is due $35.6 million next season \u2014 the final year of his current two-year contract \u2014 but has always been expected to opt out of it so he can get another 1+1 max deal. Which is certainly his right. James feels as a matter of principle that the biggest stars in the game should be paid commensurate with their productivity on the floor and their financial impact off of it, because they never get what they\u2019re actually worth under the constraints of the salary cap. And, he\u2019s right. What is LeBron actually \u201cworth\u201d to the Cavs \u2014 and, by extension, the NBA, its TV\/digital partners and everyone else who benefits from his presence \u2014 per year? Fifty million? Seventy-five? But the SuperFriends only came together in Miami in 2010 because James, Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade each took a little less than the max so they could all play together. The same principle applies today. Math is still math. Don\u2019t misunderstand: even if James agreed to take the minimum, Cleveland will have no cap room. But James agreeing to a little less than the max, as Kevin Durant did in Golden State last year , would ease the luxury tax payment that Cavs owner Dan Gilbert will have to dole out. Let\u2019s be clear: James and Gilbert have no relationship, at least not one that normal people have with one another. ( See \u201cfish handshake\u201d , et.al.) But they don\u2019t have to. They have a business partnership, one that helps each become even richer than they already are. (Would it shock me if, soon after LeBron retires, whenever that is, we\u2019ll find out he has an option to buy a piece of the Cavs? No, it would not.) If LeBron were to stay in Cleveland \u2014 hard by his hometown of Akron \u2014 it would be a marriage of convenience. It would also be because of family \u2014 for one, James\u2019 son is starting high school next year. Like every father, he wants and needs to be around his teenage boy during these most formative and important years, before he\u2019s off to college and life. All that matters between James and Gilbert is Gilbert has shown he\u2019s willing to spend on the Cavs, including well into the luxury tax when it matters \u2014 and, given that he seems to own a significant chunk of downtown Detroit , it doesn\u2019t appear he\u2019s in any imminent danger of a significant financial reversal. The issue, then, is on whom to spend Gilbert\u2019s money. In previous years, James got friends like James Jones and Mike Miller to join his squads for minimum bucks for the ride. All I\u2019m suggesting is he should be able to do the same for players who are a little younger, a little better and who can help him and the Cavs immediately. Superstars demand superstar money. We all get that; James isn\u2019t getting Durant or Paul George to come to Cleveland for the mid-level. What I think he can do, though, is reach out to smart, tough vets who\u2019ll defend and make open 3-pointers, and who value winning more than chasing every available buck \u2014 which is the role Shane Battier played so well in Miami with James as the Heat won back-to-back titles. It won\u2019t be easy. The existing economic system in the league makes it almost impossible to re-create what the Warriors have built, given the reality that there isn\u2019t an owner born who\u2019s going to pay luxury tax indefinitely. (Books and \u201c30 For 30s\u201d will be developed about the Summer of 2016 , and all that transpired that first week of July. Its implications are likely to last a decade.) Cleveland has limited means to acquire players, but it does have a few. As a luxury tax payer again this season, the Cavaliers have access to the taxpayer mid-level exception for next season. Assuming a flat cap of around $101 million for 2018-19, as has been predicted, the TMLE should again start at around $5.2 million next year. It can be used by a taxpaying team to sign a free agent for up to three years. Cleveland also has a $5.8 million traded player exception that it acquired in the Kyrie Irving deal . The exception is good until August and can be used to take a player into that space via trade. The Cavaliers also have that 2018 first-round pick, eighth overall , that came in the Irving deal.  Who could James lobby? Ironically, one name that pops to mind is Houston\u2019s Luc Mbah a Moute. Here, obviously, one would want to know James\u2019 intentions where Houston is concerned \u2014 as in, if he\u2019s going to the Rockets, he\u2019ll want to keep Mbah a Moute there. But if staying in Cleveland is a possibility for James, Mbah a Moute is just the kind of wing defender the Cavs desperately need. At 31, Mbah a Moute remains among the league\u2019s best on-ball defenders, who consistently takes on the opposition\u2019s best twos, threes and fours. Per NBA.com\/Stats, his Defensive Rating this season of 101.2 ranked behind only Utah\u2019s Royce O\u2019Neale, Philly\u2019s Robert Covington, Boston\u2019s Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown, the Warriors\u2019 Andre Iguodala and Boston\u2019s Al Horford among forwards who played 15 or more minutes in 60 or more games this season. And Mbah a Moute has worked extremely hard to become credible behind the 3-point line, shooting 36.4 percent this year after a career-best 39.1 percent on 3-pointers for the LA Clippers in 2016-17. Per former Sixers executive Ben Falk\u2019s excellent Cleaning the Glass website, Mbah a Moute\u2019s Effective Field Goal Percentage this year (.583) put him in the 92nd percentile this season among forwards. Almost all of his shots for Hosuton were corner 3-pointers and layups. The Rockets have \u201cnon-Bird\u201d rights to Mbah a Moute, meaning they can only give him a deal going forward that starts at 120 percent raise over the veteran minimum salary this season \u2014 around $2.8 million. Or, they can use some or all of their own TMLE. The point is, Houston can\u2019t outspend Cleveland for Mbah a Moute\u2019s services. So if everything\u2019s equal, could James make a difference here to convince someone like Mbah a Moute to come to Cleveland? If James believes the Cavs need more offensive punch, a prodigious talent like the Denver Nuggets\u2019 Will Barton could give Cleveland a huge lift next season. It would be a long shot, because Barton has already turned down a four-year, $42 million extension from the Nuggets , and the Cavs don\u2019t have anything near that to offer. But Cleveland can offer Barton a potential starting job at the two \u2014 the 27-year-old, a sixth man in Denver, told ESPN\u2019s Chris Haynes earlier this year that he wants to \u201chave a bigger role\u201d going forward, wherever he plays \u2014 and a chance to win big playing next to James. But James will also have to trust in Altman, who is just finishing his first season at the helm, having come in out of the bullpen to replace former GM David Griffin last summer . Altman had to hit the ground running and salvage something after Irving\u2019s trade request went public in late June . \u2022 At the end of 2018 business, here\u2019s what Altman sent out: Irving Derrick Rose Iman Shumpert Channing Frye Cavaliers 2018 first-round pick (25th overall) \u2022 and here\u2019s what he got in return: George Hill Rodney Hood Jordan Clarkson Larry Nance, Jr. Ante Zizic Nets\u2019 2018 first-round pick (via Boston) This includes Altman having used Isaiah Thomas ( picked up from Boston in the Irving deal ) and Cleveland\u2019s own 2018 first-round pick to get Clarkson and Nance from the Lakers. He also used Jae Crowder ( also acquired from Boston in the Irving deal ) along with Shumpert to get Hood from Utah and Hill from Sacramento. All three deals were consummated in a flurry at the trade deadline in February . In doing so, Altman proved to be willing to gamble and able to keep things quiet, as he remade the Cavs in a day. Those are important qualities going forward, and James was impressed with his new GM\u2019s resourcefulness. But there\u2019s a difference between that and trusting him with the remaining years of James\u2019 career. Can James believe in Altman the way he trusted Griffin \u2014 without the resources Griffin had in 2014 \u2014 to pull off a deal that will bring difference-making talent to Cleveland? The one player that could bring someone of value back is Kevin Love. He made his fifth All-Star team this season and averaged a double-double for a second straight postseason. Still just 29, Love has one year ($24.1 million) plus a player option ($25.5 million) for 2019-20.  The Cavaliers need someone who can create his own shot the way Irving did. One player who can do that is the Portland Trail Blazers\u2019 C.J. McCollum, who averaged 21.4 ppg for the Blazers this season . He just happened to grow up an hour south of Cleveland in Canton, while Love grew up 11 miles from downtown Portland in Lake Oswego, Ore. The Blazers need a big who can score and stretch the floor to give both All-NBA first team guard Damian Lillard room to drive and big man Jusuf Nurkic room to thump inside. Love shot almost 42 percent on 3-pointers this season. Could Altman even approach Portland with such an offer without having to sacrifice the No. 8 pick as a sweetener? * Consensus Mock Draft:  Who is on Cavs\u2019 radar? If the Cavs keep the pick, they\u2019ll likely be in position to take one of Alabama point guard Collin Sexton , who they worked out this weekend, or Villanova wing Mikal Bridges . Either could step in right away and contribute. Is that promise enough to at least pique James\u2019 interest, or would he want that pick to bring in a veteran with more playoff stripes? No one\u2019s saying it\u2019s easy to play with James. It isn\u2019t. He controls the ball like a point guard \u2026 yet also scores \u2026 and also makes many of the decisions about where the ball goes. He\u2019s that good. But it does mean teammates have to excel at spot-up shooting, and can go minutes at a time without touching the rock. Bosh wasn\u2019t lying . It\u2019s a major adjustment, especially for a star player. But James is still the best player in the league. He\u2019s proven \u2014 indisputably \u2014 he only requires minimum help to get his team out of the East. To beat Golden State, though, he\u2019ll need more than the minimum going forward, even as he keeps making the maximum. Maybe a Banana Boat reunion with Paul in Houston, or a partnership with George in L.A., will be too enticing to pass up. But there is another way. A long time ago, James famously said he wanted to be the first billionaire baller. He\u2019s well on his way to doing so because he\u2019s great at closing deals. If he can get multi-billion dollar companies to come to him, getting a couple of free agents that can help to come to Cleveland shouldn\u2019t be that heavy a lift. * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

From Dylan Wesson: I do not understand the argument against watching excellence at work, Dylan. I would have jumped at the chance to go to a Prince concert every week. I never get tired of watching Meryl Streep act, or get tired of listening McCoy Tyner play the piano. And it\u2019s not boring to me to watch the Warriors dominate opponents. Now, I have no rooting interest, as fans do. The \u201cboredom\u201d that many express \u2014 I\u2019m not saying you are here, but many do \u2014 is, more accurately, frustration and\/or jealousy that their team can\u2019t beat the Warriors. People always ask me who my favorite team is, and I always give the same answer, because it\u2019s true: I\u2019m a fan of the game, and I love seeing it played at a high, intelligent level. The great thing about basketball is that the individual and the team have to operate as one to win championships. For all his individual feats, and he was the most dominant individual to ever play, Wilt Chamberlain couldn\u2019t beat the Celtics by himself. The Warriors struggled plenty against Houston because the Rockets\u2019 defense was able to take away so much of the movement and weakside action that Golden State loves to run, and made the Warriors frequently go to iso ball with Kevin Durant. And it damn near worked. I know I\u2019m easily dismissed because I cover the NBA for a living, but I love to watch the Warriors move the ball, pass after pass, until someone has a wide open 3-pointer or a layup\/dunk. Their synergy of getting Durant the ball but also never letting up in their demands that he move without it and create shots for his teammates is the essence of the pro game. It is up to the other 29 teams to put a team together that\u2019s good enough to beat them. Every team in the league had a chance to sign Durant in 2016. They should have had a better team to entice him. As for the \u201880s, the Lakers and Celtics were must-see TV throughout their rivalry; I don\u2019t recall many being bored with seeing Magic Johnson and Larry Bird go at each other three times in The Finals. And, it was only three times. Which reinforces what I said above. The Detroit Pistons and Chicago Bulls didn\u2019t whine about how hard it was to beat Boston in the Eastern Conference. They put teams together that challenged, and finally vanquished, the Celtics. I\u2019d tell today\u2019s teams as well as their fans: stop whining about how unfair it is that Golden State\u2019s so loaded. Get to work. Here comes the Sun(s). From Devin Naganoolil: The Suns have said they\u2019ll be aggressive in free agency, so there\u2019s no reason not to take them at their word. In that case, Paul George would be a great fit next to Ayton and Devin Booker; George could certainly provide a young Phoenix core with leadership, and go a long way toward beginning to fix what was a horrific defense last season. But if they can\u2019t get the marquee guys like PG-13, I\u2019d go after someone like Marcus Smart, who\u2019s a restricted free agent. Boston loves him and wants to keep him, but the Celtics have major loot tied up in Kyrie Irving, Gordon Hayward and Al Horford, will have to commit nine figures to Irving next summer and now have to pay Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum big bucks in just a couple of years. They can\u2019t pay everybody. If I were Phoenix, I\u2019d put my best cap guys to work coming up with an offer sheet that would as difficult as possible for Boston to match \u2014 think back loading so that the big paydays for Smart come in years three and four of the deal, just when Boston will be hip deep in its biggest payouts. A Smart-Josh Jackson-Ayton trio would have the makings of a potentially formidable defensive skeleton for Phoenix to build on. But even if the Suns got someone like Smart, I\u2019d still pump the brakes on the playoff talk. It\u2019s going to take Phoenix a minute. Vegas, baby: Vegas! From Ezra Pate: I don\u2019t think the NBA is the NHL, Ezra. It would be next to impossible to field a team in the NBA with enough talent\/offensive firepower to win 35-40 games \u2014 the minimum you\u2019d have to win to have a shot at the postseason \u2014 in its inaugural season. But I like the academic bent of the question. The normal expansion draft method is that an existing team can protect a certain amount of players on its roster from being taken by the expansion team, and once a player is taken from an existing team, it can\u2019t lose any additional players to the expansion team. In last year\u2019s NHL expansion draft for the Golden Knights, existing teams had the option of either protecting seven forwards, three defensemen and one goaltender, or eight skaters of any combination and one goaltender. Importantly, rising unrestricted free agents were treated by the NHL as still belonging to their existing teams, and thus could be protected under one of the two scenarios above.  If that was extended to a theoretical NBA expansion team (let\u2019s call them the Sevens), that means guys like LeBron James, Kevin Durant and Paul George would be able to be protected by the Cleveland Cavaliers, Golden State Warriors and Oklahoma City Thunder even though their contracts with those teams would expire if they, as expected, opt out of the last year of their current deals. Vegas, needing to field a roster of up to 23 players per NHL rules, took one player from each of the other 30 teams . In the case of an NBA expansion team, you\u2019d only need to take 13-15 players, depending on the number of Draft picks the Sevens had in their inaugural season. (For the sake of argument, let\u2019s say they get one first and one second, neither ahead of any Lottery team from the previous season. That would mean the Sevens would pick no higher than 15 in each round.) Let\u2019s also say the NBA allowed its existing 30 teams to each protect 10 players on their current official 15-man rosters, which would also cover some (though not all) players on two-way contracts. I\u2019d look to teams like the Utah Jazz, Brooklyn Nets and the Thunder, who all put a premium on player development, and see if I could poach a young guy from them that they might have to leave exposed. Maybe a Josh Huestis from OKC, an Isaiah Whitehead from Brooklyn, a Raul Neto from Utah. Guys like that. I don\u2019t think you could put a playoff team together in one season, but the good news is you\u2019d have an awful lot of really good young assistants around the league from which to build a formidable staff. And would I look hard at San Antonio Spurs assistant coach Becky Hammon as my coach? Damn right I would.

(Last week\u2019s averages in parenthesis) 1) Kevin Durant (31.5 ppg, 12.5 rpg, 8.5 apg, .550 FG, 1.000 FT): Even KD\u2019s own people were a little surprised he got Finals MVP, but his Game 3 carried the day, and further cemented his standing as one of the best of his generation. 2) LeBron James (28.5 ppg, 8.5 rpg, 9.5 apg, .488 FG, .833 FT): Probably should have come out without the soft cast on after Game 4, even if you thought everyone already knew about your hand injury. You know how we are. 3) Stephen Curry (24 ppg, 5.5 rpg, 5 apg, .349 FG, 1.000 FT): It is amazing that Curry, still, does not get enough credit for allowing Durant to come to his team \u2014 his team \u2014 without a minute\u2019s complaint about what it would mean to him, a two-time Kia MVP winner when this all went down in 2016, how it would affect his shots or his standing or his station how it could hurt his endorsements or Q rating. Nothing. Just, \u201cwe want you, KD.\u201d If Curry had said no, or hinted no, it would have never happened. 4) James Harden: Season complete. 5) Anthony Davis: Season complete. $200,000,000 \u2014 Estimated amount of the Bucks\u2019 new local television deal with Fox Sports Wisconsin, per the Sports Business Journal , a significant increase over the team\u2019s current deal. SBJ reports that the Bucks\u2019 local ratings this past season rose almost six percent, and were the team\u2019s highest in 12 years. 477 \u2014 Career coaching victories, including playoffs, for the Pelicans\u2019 Alvin Gentry, who received a two-year extension from New Orleans last week that runs through the 2020 season. 5 \u2014 Players with more than two Finals MVPs \u2014 Michael Jordan (6), and Tim Duncan, LeBron James, Magic Johnson and Shaquille O\u2019Neal (3 each). Per basketball-reference.com, Kevin Durant became just the 11th player in league history to win at least two, joining Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Larry Bird, Hakeem Olajuwon, Kobe Bryant and Willis Reed with his second. 1) It\u2019s never going to be a bad thing for me that Warriors fans , among the most loyal and long-suffering in all of pro sports, have a dynasty to celebrate and enjoy. They\u2019re a great team to watch, and they\u2019re the NBA\u2019s gold standard until further notice. 2) Saw Donovan Mitchell in Cleveland; he was there to observe Game 3 as a pro after going to the Finals last year as a fan. He is such an impressive young man in all ways. The Jazz have an elite talent and elite person who should only get better in the coming years. 3) I don\u2019t like the Nuggets\u2019 new sets of uniforms , including the \u201cMile High City\u201d blue alternates. I love the Nuggets\u2019 new uniforms. Dope. Fire. Fresh. However the kids describe such things these days. 4) Watching Alexander Ovechkin of the Washington Capitals win his first Stanley Cup championship Thursday night, it was hard not to think about Dirk Nowitzki, and his run to the NBA title with the Mavericks in 2011. The parallels between Ovechkin and Nowitzki are striking. They both became franchise players for U.S. teams who came from other countries, a rarity in the States that brings its own unique set of issues. Both were castigated for more than a decade for not being good\/diverse enough to lead their teams to championships \u2014 Dirk for not rebounding\/posting up; Ovechkin for not backchecking and blocking shots. Neither, as far as we know, ever seriously considered ever leaving the team that drafted them. And both, finally, broke through and won it all in their 13th pro seasons. 1) There was just way too much glee around the basketball world \u2014 some out in the open, some sotto voce \u2014 at the demise of Bryan Colangelo in Philadelphia . I know the story was just too juicy for some not to go for cheap yuks, and that there are Hinkie Stans who couldn\u2019t wait for Colangelo to get his comeuppance, having replaced Hinkie as the Sixers GM in a move the Stans viewed as a coup. But Bryan Colangelo was, and is, a quality executive, who built a title contender in Phoenix with Mike D\u2019Antoni and good teams in Toronto. Transparency, though, requires the following be said: \u2022 1. The Sixers made the right move. There was just too much damage done to Colangelo\u2019s present effectiveness as an exec for him to be allowed to go further, especially with free agency looming next month and the Sixers needing to have everyone pulling in the same direction as they go after the blue chippers. \u2022 2. I\u2019ve known Bryan\u2019s wife, Barbara, since she worked in the league office in the early \u201890s, and I like her, a lot. She\u2019s been nothing but pleasant and decent to me during two-plus decades, as has Bryan, who worked with me for a time at NBA TV before he was hired in Philly. And I hate to see people I actually know a little reduced to caricature by people who don\u2019t them at all. \u2022 3. The statement Bryan Colangelo put out after his resignation was announced was not a good one. whatever the truth of Barbara Colangelo\u2019s role in the burner accounts that caused all this, the statement blamed her way too harshly and publicly. At any rate, the Colangelos will need some time to themselves as a family to figure out exactly what happened here, and that\u2019s what bothers me most: so many are forgetting that a family, with children, was impacted terribly by what transpired, and please spare me the false equivalency of \u2018what about the damage done to the team?\u2019 takes. It\u2019s not the same. Don\u2019t even let those words leave your mouth. Your entertainment is not the same as a family\u2019s internal pain, and it\u2019s not a plaything for you to bat around until you get bored with it and go to the next shiny object on the internet. 2) Wish we would have had a better Finals, but what are you gonna do? 3) Oy. This is not good. 4) You know, the machines are gonna take over eventually, anyway.  Why are we helping them become self-aware quicker? * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

During his speech, he told the undergrads how he\u2019d evolved as a manager of people over the years. \u201c Early in my career, I used to think of players as assets, statistics on a spreadsheet I could use to project future performance and measure precisely how much they would impact our team on the field,\u201d he said. \u201cI used to think of teams as portfolios, diversified collections of player assets paid to produce up to their projections to ensure the organization\u2019s success. My head had been down. That narrow approach worked for a while, but it certainly had its limits. I grew and my team- building philosophy grew as well. The truth \u2014 as our team proved (in the 2016 World Series) in Cleveland \u2014 is that a player\u2019s character matters. The heartbeat matters. Fears and aspirations matter. The player\u2019s impact on others matters. The tone he sets matters. The willingness to connect matters. Breaking down cliques and overcoming stereotypes in the clubhouse matters. Who you are, how you live among others \u2014 that all matters.\u201d If that was a lesson Epstein had to learn, it appears more innate in Bob Myers. The Golden State Warriors\u2019 general manager is universally regarded as a genuinely decent person, not a small feat for a former high-powered agent who crossed over into management. A former walk-on at UCLA, Myers worked for uber-agent Arn Tellem and Casey Wasserman before a recommendation from Boston Celtics president Danny Ainge to Warriors co-owner Joe Lacob \u2014 Lacob had been a minority owner in Boston before buying the Warriors \u2014 got Myers an interview with Lacob when he was thinking about changing careers and going into management. Myers has been directly involved in the entire being of Golden State\u2019s construction as the NBA\u2019s best team \u2014 and this isn\u2019t about the players, because many of them were brought in before Myers took over full-time as GM in 2012. Former GM Larry Riley drafted Stephen Curry in 2009 , Klay Thompson in 2011 and Draymond Green in 2012 and traded for center Andrew Bogut . But Myers, along with coach Steve Kerr, has been central to the creation of the Warriors\u2019 culture during this championship run. Golden State doesn\u2019t just play; it plays with joy, with an esprit de corps in which none of its stars cares who gets the credit or attention. Neither does Myers, who navigated the acquisition of Andre Iguodala and was present at the creation of the Hamptons Five in 2016 , when the Warriors\u2019 contingent went to New York to woo Kevin Durant. His ability to forge relationships with just about everyone in basketball and have them think highly of the encounter has come in handy as he handles his players\u2019 disparate personalities \u2014 Green\u2019s fire, Thompson\u2019s stoicism, Curry\u2019s hidden ultra competitiveness. Myers and Kerr have become more than GM\/Coach; their friendship is deep and meaningful, allowing them to view both the team and people the same way. There is no separation between them. And that allows for the best of an organization to flourish. And so the Warriors flourished again this year, even as they fought boredom and injuries in the regular season, and the hard-charging Houston Rockets in the Western Conference finals , and LeBron James in The Finals . And Myers was present in Cleveland last week, at the creation of the NBA\u2019s latest dynasty, as the Warriors won back-to-back titles and their third in four seasons, again soaking the carpet in the visitors\u2019 locker room at Quicken Loans Arena with champagne and joy. Me: I know it doesn\u2019t get old, but is winning a championship still as much about avoiding losing as much as it is winning? Bob Myers: I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s hard to find out what these things mean. I mean, the first one, it\u2019s mythical. It\u2019s the Holy Grail. For me, it was just too much, surreal, all these words that you use. \u2018Cause I just didn\u2019t think that was possible when we won it here three years ago. I\u2019m not the guy that thought I\u2019d take the job and win a championship. It\u2019s hard to compare to that. And then , losing (after being up) 3-1 \u2014 it\u2019s, I\u2019m answering your question, \u2018cause it\u2019s kind of a holistic thing. You put it all together, when you\u2019re winning these things \u2014 you look at the whole thing, \u2018cause there was no break in it, even though we lost. The 3-1 one, that was the toughest emotionally, because \u2014 I told somebody the other day, for three (games), they probably had champagne in our room. Which is kind of crazy. And I remember driving to that game thinking, man. And somebody said \u2018what do you think about the game?\u2019 And I said \u2018it\u2019s a coin flip.\u2019 And it was a coin flip. To me, it was a coin flip. And we lost that one. And the next one, with Kevin, it felt like, people judged 73-9 as , I heard the word \u2018failure.\u2019 And I said, that doesn\u2019t have to be my word, or our word. But that\u2019s how we judge. You have to do the whole thing, and we didn\u2019t do it. So I felt like that whole year was, it legitimized the first one in some respects. \u2018Cause people even called the first one lucky, which, I don\u2019t know if you remember, people were saying, well, they got lucky \u2014 Me:  Doc (Rivers) . BM: That we got lucky. And then, it legitimized, and then to see Kevin kind of see what he went through, and to see it culminate in an MVP (at The Finals) and a championship. And then, this year, this regular season was tough. And the playoffs were tough. I mean, Houston was fantastic, there were some great opponents. But this one feels more exhausting. And maybe it\u2019s because it was the fourth marathon. I told somebody, I said, for runners, for any monumental (physical) task, climbing mountains, usually you come back down, and you rest. But in this business, I mean, we started in September. We were in China in early October. It\u2019s almost the equivalent of climbing Mount Everest together, and we come down, and I go \u2018David, ready to go back up?\u2019 And you go \u2018we just got down, man; what are you talking about?\u2019 And that\u2019s what this feels like. It\u2019s awesome, it\u2019s exactly what you want to do. I don\u2019t mean to demean it at all. But there is a fatigue to it. The thing I\u2019m feeling right now would be a gratification. The first one was exhilaration. I\u2019d say the last year, the fact that I can even talk about three of these things is hard to even fathom. But last year was more relief. This year is gratification, for a difficult year and ending how everybody wants it to end. Me: Was there a time you thought you would lose the Houston series? BM: Oh, yeah. Game 6 \u2014 well, when we lost Game 4 , I feel like you can never give away a playoff game, especially at home. You just, then you feel like you have to beat the team five times, and that\u2019s hard to do against a really good team. So, for us to lose our composure \u2014 and Houston had a lot to do with that, in Game 4 \u2014 and lose that game being up 10 going into the fourth quarter, I thought, maybe this isn\u2019t it. And then to be down in Game 6 10 at that half \u2014 and not just being down, but being down and not showing the fight. I said to somebody, I said \u2018we\u2019re going to find out, right now.\u2019 And that was halftime of Game 6. And we brought it, we came back and won. And then being down in Game 7 on the road, I didn\u2019t know if we had another one in there. But, that\u2019s where our guys, I mean, whatever words you want to use, the championship pedigree, the trust, the ability, the faith, the character, that\u2019s what gets you to nights like tonight. Me: Maybe the culture? BM: Yeah. But culture is the people. You can use the word culture, but you\u2019ve been in cultures, you think of who lives in that culture. And for me it\u2019s Steve Kerr, our owner has his passion, it\u2019s our players, it\u2019s people I work with, it\u2019s our fans. I told Steve after the game, I said, obviously you\u2019re overjoyed. I said \u2018my favorite moments are my conversations with you on a Tuesday night at 11 o\u2019clock, and it\u2019s Game 25 of the season.\u2019 It\u2019s just the day-to-day journey with people you respect that make it worthwhile. Me: You said last week that you know that this isn\u2019t to last, that this is going to end . And then Joe, of course, two days later, says \u2018it\u2019s not going to end; it\u2019s going on for 20 years\u2019. BM: Steph Curry will be 45, 50 years old, shooting threes. Me: Exactly. BM: Yeah, it\u2019s obvious. Me: So how do you bridge those two worlds? BM: (Laughing) There is no bridge. You know, if you want to see where that divergence lies, it\u2019s really, when I said that, I think a lot of people thought I was referring to, it ends now. I don\u2019t think it ends (immediately). But everything ends. Teams end. They all do. But that\u2019s okay; it makes you appreciate the moment you\u2019re in. I think he was referring to, why can\u2019t we be something akin to the Spurs, like the Patriots. And it\u2019s 20 years. But I don\u2019t know that in that 20 years \u2026 there\u2019s a choppiness to that, too. I mean, you don\u2019t go to The Finals (every year). I think the Spurs, between 2007 and \u201914, their fourth and fifth championships, that\u2019s seven years. So runs don\u2019t mean a Finals every year. They don\u2019t mean that. They meant it for us the last four. But I think he was referring to, it doesn\u2019t have to. I was referring to this specific group. I don\u2019t know. Me: I know you can\u2019t begin to process what happens next with this particular group \u2014 BM: I go to Morton\u2019s and have a beer. Me: Exactly. BM: I know you weren\u2019t asking that. Me: Yeah, the next thing. You have Klay and Draymond down the road, and KD this summer. But do you feel like the argument \u2014 the fact \u2014 that this group has gone to four straight Finals is kind of a trump card over any possible object that anyone might have? BM: Winning is the only time you don\u2019t have to answer questions. It\u2019s the only time. Twenty-nine other GMs, you have to answer, \u2018what if?\u2019 \u2018why didn\u2019t you?\u2019 Every coach, every player. You only get to have this emotion once, and it means you have to win. It doesn\u2019t mean, though, that you have a perfect team or that you have a perfect life by any stretch. But for me, it means that you appreciate these guys, you try to keep it together, you thank the people \u2014 for me, my family, my wife, the people that went on the journey with you. The sacrifice, the things that nobody knows about. That\u2019s the part you try to keep your eye on. And as far as the group, you value the guys that helped you do it, the players, the coaching staff, people I work with in the front office. I don\u2019t know. I think you treasure each moment with these people. Like I said, I mean, you\u2019ve worked with a ton of people. They change. People come and go, for whatever reason \u2014 some good, some bad. It doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s life. Me: So, how do you avoid burnout? This has been a long run. BM: I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s a real question \u2026 it seems to be, more. Each year is more, if that makes sense. Not because we\u2019re in The Finals. The game is growing, which is fantastic. It\u2019s a global phenomenon. Everybody\u2019s wanting to watch. The scrutiny grows the better you do. How do you live in that? And I don\u2019t know how to do that the right way yet. But that\u2019s the challenge, right? Me: You\u2019ve been talking about that for a while. And you still don\u2019t have the right balance? BM: No. I mean, you don\u2019t ever, I think it\u2019s one of those things that never ends. All you can do is try. I\u2019ve got, we just had a baby, and I have three daughters that I\u2019m trying to raise, and doing that in our society is a challenge. I don\u2019t know. Talking about it, thinking about it is what you do, surround yourself with good people. Maybe you\u2019ve got some advice. Me: All I know is you\u2019ve got the Draft in two weeks. BM: That\u2019s not what I\u2019m talking about (laughs). Me: So, I asked Andre (Iguodala) this. He talked about the journey being better than the result, which I understand. But how do you keep the journey from becoming stale for this group going forward? BM: You\u2019ve got to like each other. You\u2019ve got to really like each other. You\u2019ve got to respect each other. You\u2019ve got to understand that some days, you don\u2019t have it. And your teammates need to pick you up. It\u2019s the houseguest that stays too long. Sometimes you just need space. And it\u2019s nobody\u2019s fault. You need to yell at each other; you have to tell each other how you\u2019re feeling. There\u2019s acrimony, there\u2019s division, there\u2019s everything. But as long as you don\u2019t break. You have to view it almost as like a family \u2014 that no matter what happens, we\u2019re blood, and we\u2019re going to see it through. But that\u2019s a challenge, because you\u2019re really not blood, but you\u2019re as you can get, \u2018cause you\u2019re with each other all the time. Sometimes you see people more than you do your own family. So you try to find people that are decent people in the worst moments, is all you can do. Because the worst moments come. For us, the scrutiny on our team is heightened, and that\u2019s fine. So when you slip up, it\u2019s documented. So who are you going to be when you make those mistakes? How are you going to react to them? And I think that that is the testament to our group. Like I said, we bend. And we really did bend this year. But we didn\u2019t break. Me: So, do you have the ringtone with Draymond on it? BM: I never even had that! It\u2019s funny; they said that on the show. I keep my phone on silent. No buzzers, nothing. My life\u2019s crazy enough. That\u2019s the people. I\u2019m excited to get up from here and see the people. The joy I get is celebrating with these people. I\u2019m so happy for their accomplishments. That\u2019s what\u2019s so rewarding. Me: So you will not take any credit for this, will you? BM: I don\u2019t play. I mean, I help them try to get a team that can win. So that\u2019s for them. I don\u2019t, I mean, the joy I get is I\u2019ll go home tomorrow and somebody on the street will honk their horn. And they\u2019ll say \u2018thank you.\u2019 And I don\u2019t know who they are. But I\u2019ll say \u2018you\u2019re welcome.\u2019 And who gets to have a job like that? \u2014 Giannis Antetokounmpo ( @Giannis_An34 ), Monday, 10:33 p.m., getting to the heart of what makes America America \u2014 lard-laden fried foods readily available to the masses \u2014 during his fast food tasting tour last week . \u2014 Nick Young , as only Nick Young can, summarizing his journey from the young and troubled Lakers a year ago to his first NBA championship coming along for the ride with the Warriors this season. \u201cI\u2019m always flattered and shocked by any kind of direct comparisons to Dirk because that\u2019s my MJ, you know?

Now, with Wade at age 36, not so much. He\u2019s been there and done that, as far as leaving and returning to Miami, and he clearly is heading into the sunset of his Hall of Fame-worthy career. For the most part, Wade is again a free agent but is weighing whether or not to play a 16th season or not. If he does make that return, though, Wade sounds set on staying in South Florida. Wade shared his view on his future and other topics during an interview with FOX Sports radio on Sunday, talking with former teammate Caron Butler and Yahoo.com\u2019s Chris Mannix. His comments were transcribed and framed by Manny Navarro of the Miami Herald: He also offered up insight on what James, his former Big Three running mate in Miami, might do when it comes to picking a team for next season and presumably beyond. Last season, Wade averaged 16.3 points on 44.3 percent shooting in the Heat\u2019s first-round playoff elimination by the Philadelphia 76ers , scoring 28 points in Game 2 and 25 in Game 4.

Everyone in the Scottrade Center in St. Louis\u2014every fan, player, coach, writer and broadcaster, knew the deal. Those scant few seconds, 94 feet of court, and one more basket stood between the Crimson Tide and an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament. Just as evident was how Alabama was going to try and negotiate the length of the court, score that basket and steal away with a victory. The in-bounds pass was going to Collin Sexton, the 6-3 freshman his coach, former NBA player and coach Avery Johnson, calls \u201cthe fastest guy I\u2019ve ever seen with the basketball, going from one end to the other.\u201d Sexton took the inbounds pass at about the SEC logo, just inside Texas A&M\u2019s free-throw line, and quickly raced up the sideline, in front of the scorer\u2019s table. With 2.4 seconds left, he abruptly changed course and headed for the center of the court. Sexton reached his own free-throw line with 1.2 seconds to play and quickly launched a high-arching scoop shot that eluded Aggie defenders and dropped into the net as the final buzzer sounded. Alabama 71, Texas A&M 70. Sexton quickly disappeared as his teammates mobbed him. The Young Bull had done it again. A day later, Sexton scored 31 points as Alabama dispatched archrival Auburn in the quarterfinals, further cementing that NCAA bid. Alabama\u2019s SEC tournament run ended in the semifinals as Kentucky won handily, but Sexton accounted for 21 points. His three-game handiwork saved the Tide\u2019s upcoming NCAA tournament opponents the trouble of pouring through a season\u2019s worth of game film. If they wanted to see what Alabama was all about, and how Sexton fit into the equation, the SEC tournament summed it up in a nice little package. Little wonder Virginia Tech coach Buzz Williams, whose team would play and lose to Alabama in the NCAA first round, said Sexton\u2019s \u201ctalent is semi other-worldly,\u201d or that Villanova coach Jay Wright, in previewing a second-round matchup against the Tide, said Sexton \u201ccould be the most dynamic guard we\u2019ve played all year.\u201d In a few days, Sexton, a certain lottery pick , will be taking his talents to the NBA. Alabama assistant coach Yasir Rosemond, who started recruiting Georgia native Sexton when he was an assistant at the University of Georgia and knows him as well as anyone, thinks he has a read on how Sexton will fare at the next level. \u201cLow end, and this is no disrespect, he can be an Eric Bledsoe type, because he has that kind of speed and athleticism,\u201d Rosemond says. \u201cHis ceiling? I think his ceiling could be a Russell Westbrook.\u201d Rosemond isn\u2019t suggesting Sexton will become a triple-double machine like the Oklahoma City superstar. But with his insider\u2019s knowledge of Sexton\u2019s game, he can envision how it will progress in the NBA. \u201cEarly on, he\u2019ll be a better defender than some people think,\u201d Rosemond says. \u201cHe\u2019ll be a better passer than a lot of people think. He can really pass the ball. We put him in situations because we needed him to score. But he likes to pass. He\u2019s a really determined scorer, and that was great for us. But it made people wonder, \u2018can he play point guard?\u2019 I\u2019m saying he can. You look at the NBA. How many point guards up there can\u2019t score?\u201d Sexton has other attributes that will set him apart. Start with his intelligence. He made just one B in high school\u2014the rest were A\u2019s\u2014and in his first semester of college, his grade point average was 4.0 and he earned a spot on Alabama\u2019s President\u2019s List. Despite having to travel the workout circuit in the run-up to the draft, he enrolled in what Alabama calls the May-mester, so he could keep working on earning his degree. Then there\u2019s Sexton\u2019s toughness. He demonstrated that in spectacular fashion the night last November that Alabama, its roster reduced by ejections, foul disqualifications and an injury, had to play the final 10:41 against Minnesota with three players. With 1:32 to play, Alabama trailed the Golden Gophers, then ranked No. 14 in the nation, 83-80. That\u2019s because Sexton wouldn\u2019t give up. He finished the game with 40 points and earned some admirers. \u201cCollin Sexton could be a single team just by himself,\u201d Minnesota coach Richard Pitino said. \u201cHe\u2019s that good.\u201d Dwayne Wade took to Twitter to enthuse, \u201cNothing but heart. I love the way he attacks the game.\u201d Sexton stays stuck in attack mode, thus his nickname the Young Bull. \u201cI coached Aaron Brooks at Oregon,\u201d Rosemond says. \u201cAaron was fast, very fast. But Collin, in the open floor, his speed is ridiculous. He gets to where he needs to go fast. And he\u2019s a strong, powerful guy. I would never put that kind of pressure on him, but he\u2019s got some Westbrook-type ability.\u201d Johnson seconded that opinion in an interview on TNT. Asked to compare Sexton to a current NBA player, Johnson couldn\u2019t single out just one. Nor could he contain his comparison to the present-day NBA. He\u2019s a combination of guys,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cFrom a basketball IQ side, [Rajon] Rondo. He\u2019s got that speed and athleticism that Kevin Johnson or Westbrook has in the lane. Isiah Thomas\u2014I\u2019m talking about the Detroit Pistons\u2019 Isiah Thomas\u2014that grit, midrange, shoots the 3. He\u2019s got the tricks inside the paint. And the toughness. \u201cIf he plays against Westbrook and Chris Paul on back-to-back nights, there\u2019s not really going to be any fear. He\u2019s really going to think he\u2019s the best player on the floor.\u201d * * * Chris Dortch is the editor of the  Blue Ribbon College Basketball Yearbook .

Still, most mock drafts have Arizona big man Deandre Ayton as the consensus No. 1 pick, based largely on the age-old theory that a potentially transcendent big man cannot be passed up on draft night. The only problem with that theory is that it doesn\u2019t ring true in an NBA where all indications are you do not need an elite big man to win and win big (see the Golden State Warriors, Cleveland Cavaliers and every other legitimate title contender in basketball right now).

The towering 7-footer from Harlem , who played his one collegiate season at Texas, worked out individually with Phoenix on Saturday, the third player to do so this week as the Suns weigh their options with the No. 1 overall pick this month in the NBA draft . Deandre Ayton worked out Wednesday and Marvin Bagley III on Friday. \u201dMo had a really good workout,\u201d Suns general manager Ryan McDonough said. \u201dHis wingspan, his standing reach, is off the charts. His ability to protect the rim I think will be elite at the NBA level, in addition to his ability to rebound the ball. Another thing that stood out to us in his workout today is we can tell he\u2019s been working on his shooting.\u201d Bamba has been working with noted shooting coach Drew Hanlen and has made significant changes to his form. McDonough described Bamba\u2019s old form as \u201da slingshot\u201d approach with the ball released far behind the shooter\u2019s head. Bamba said the changes have \u201dmade like a night-and-day difference in just my mechanics, getting the ball off smoother and having softer landing on the rim.\u201d \u201dMy makes are all net and my misses are landing very soft and long instead of short,\u201d he said. Bamba has a 7-foot-10 wingspan, the largest ever recorded at the NBA combine. McDonough said Bamba\u2019s highest vertical jump was 12 1-2 feet, \u201dwhich is crazy.\u201d As for the comparison with Gobert, the shot-blocking center of the Utah Jazz, McDonough said \u201dhonestly I think at 20 years old he\u2019s ahead of where Rudy was.\u201d \u201dNow Rudy\u2019s made tremendous strides over the last three or four years,\u201d McDonough said. \u201dThe question for Mo is can he fill out his body the way Rudy has. But in terms of measurements, they\u2019re similar. In terms of the willingness and desire to anchor a defense and protect the rim, they\u2019re similar. I think Mo probably is a little more mobile at the same age and Rudy is probably stronger, more physically developed at the same age.\u201d Bamba loves the comparison. \u201dHe just changed the geometry of the game,\u201d Bamba said. \u201dWhen he\u2019s not blocking the shot, he\u2019s in the back of your mind.\u201d McDonough calls Bamba \u201da super-bright guy, one of the smarter guys I\u2019ve seen in the last 10 or 15 years come through the pre-draft process.\u201d Bamba believes that intelligence will serve him well in the NBA. \u201dI have the natural ability to pick things up a lot faster than I think most people would,\u201d he said, \u201dand I think I\u2019ve shown that in the workout that we did today. \u2026 IQ is really big. It\u2019s something that you really want to have on and off the court and it takes your game to the next level for sure.\u201d Bamba weighs 234 pounds. \u201dHe\u2019s super-long but he\u2019s thin so he needs to add some length to his body, especially the lower body,\u201d McDonough said. \u201dBut I think from day one he\u2019ll be able to step on the court and impact games defensively, block shots, rebound and then be an over-the-top lob threat and then build the rest of his game out from there.\u201d Bamba said he is working out for other teams but didn\u2019t want to identify them.

Imagine the crowning of a new monarch where the royal subjects couldn\u2019t stop chattering about the freshly deposed or deceased predecessor. Where the traditional cry of continuity and succession, \u201cThe king is dead! Long live the king!\u201d got flipped, with what was overshadowing what is. That\u2019s pretty much how it went Friday night at Quicken Loans Arena, with the Golden State Warriors\u2019 latest NBA championship having to share the stage with speculation, instantly revved up, about LeBron James and the choice he\u2019ll soon make about his next employer. The Warriors are the kings, claiming pro basketball\u2019s throne yet again by completing a sweep of James\u2019 Cleveland Cavaliers in the 2018 Finals. But of course, James is the King, and as so many of us learned in sophomore English \u2013 thanks, CliffsNotes! \u2013 \u201cUneasy lies the head (of those who fret and obsess about the future whereabouts of the NBA superstar) that wears a crown.\u201d Long live the kings! The King is \u2026 gone? There was so much energy before, during and after Game 4 Friday poured into the last game\/next game conjecture about James, the Cavaliers and seismic shifts in the league\u2019s 2018-19 landscape that even the player\u2019s surprise reveal near the end of the night \u2013 a bruised and bandaged right hand \u2013 couldn\u2019t derail it. Turns out, as James \u2018fessed up, the sore shooting paw was an injury he had been playing with ever since Game 1 in Oakland eight days earlier. He had \u201cself-inflicted\u201d it in a fit of pique when he smacked a whiteboard in the visitors\u2019 dressing room at Oracle Arena after Cleveland\u2019s overtime loss in the series-setter, an outcome driven at least in part by some teammates\u2019 mistakes and an arcane wrinkle in the NBA\u2019s replay rules regarding block\/charge fouls. Despite the hordes of media people chronicling every waking detail of the Finals, James had kept the injury on the down-low (along with the possibility that J.R. Smith\u2019s nickname amongst his Cavs teammates might be \u201cwhiteboard\u201d). The cameras zoomed in and clicked in a paparazzi frenzy of motor drives every time James raised the hand, wrapped in black tape, above the table during his postgame podium remarks. Whether a legit Page-2-the-rest-of-the-story factor in the championship series or a too-late alibi, the contused hand wound up as a sidebar to where James plans to be using it when training camps open in a few months. As of Friday, it had been 95 months since \u201cThe Decision,\u201d the 2010 announcement that James made in a tone-deaf vanity TV production that he was taking his talents from Cleveland to South Beach. Nearly 47 months had passed since he broke the news of his return in a Sports Illustrated ghost-written essay, envisioning much of what actually has unfolded in the four years since. Now savvy insiders and casual observers alike presume James will be on the move again, pushed to leave the franchise he has defined in an urgent search for more and better talent with which he can compete. As in, y\u2019know, some horses, some horses, his kingdom for some horses. James\u2019 free-agency process next month (he can opt out of a $35.6 million deal in the final season of his current contract) is expected to dictate the market of player movement this summer like an oversized domino. It easily could swing the balance of power, if not quite at Golden State\u2019s lofty level then immediately below it. Dr. Frankenstein eventually was done in by his macabre creation, and it can similarly be argued that James has no one but himself to blame for the predicament in which he again finds himself. He set in motion the machinery of the super team, after all, when he chose to join forces with Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh in Miami eight years ago. Oh sure, the Boston Celtics in 2007-08 got there first by luring Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen to join Paul Pierce, but that was about knitting together three stars, all age 30 or older, for what would be their last best chance to win in an extremely limited run. That group won one title, went to two Finals in three seasons and was done, Allen leaving to join James & Co. with the Heat while Garnett and Pierce morphed into trade chips for Boston POBO Danny Ainge. When James, Wade and Bosh teamed up, they were in their basketball primes and their initial giddy boasts of \u201cnot four, not five, not six\u201d championships turned off fans league-wide as much for its portent as its pretension. That crew went 4-for-4 in Finals, winning two rings before James, nudged by staleness and chafing as well as his grand plan for northeast Ohio, went home. From there, a line can be drawn through the ill-conceived 2012-13 L.A. Lakers of Kobe Bryant, Steve Nash, Dwight Howard and Pau Gasol all the way to this season\u2019s Houston Rockets of James Harden and Chris Paul and the talent-gorged Golden State roster. James was the centerpiece as Cleveland replicated the Big Three concept around him with Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love, two younger, playoff-stymied All-Stars. The new-look Cavaliers went to the Finals in their first season together and clambered atop the basketball world to win the franchise\u2019s first NBA title by the end of the second, becoming the first team in league history to do so after digging a 1-3 hole in the best-of-seven series. In that moment, regardless of the two Finals trips that followed, James\u2019 bill was stamped: Paid In Full. Misguided fans might burn his jersey if he leaves again, but James burned the mortgage after that Game 7 in Oakland in 2016 as far as any remaining obligation to fulfill. \u201cI came back because I felt like I had some unfinished business,\u201d he said after elimination Friday. \u201cTo be able to be a part of a championship team two years ago with the team that we had and in the fashion that we had is something I will always remember. Honestly, I think we\u2019ll all remember that. It ended a drought for Cleveland of 50-plus years, so I think we\u2019ll all remember that in sports history.\u201d James added: \u201cWhen you have a goal and you\u2019re able to accomplish that goal, it actually \u2013 for me personally \u2013 made me even more hungry to continue to try to win championships. And I still want to be in championship mode. I think I\u2019ve shown this year why I will still continue to be in championship mode.\u201d In other words, James intends to sustain his high level of performance. He expects to win. And he presumably will do whatever \u2013 and go wherever \u2013 is necessary to achieve that. So what does that mean for the NBA\u2019s best player (never mind what the annual MVP balloting says in any given season)? It means this: compromise. There is no ideal situation, certainly no easy answer to the guesswork surrounding James\u2019 looming free agency. He could transform any of the 30 teams, but not without some trade-offs for him, for them or for both. Most of them won\u2019t be in play. Teams in markets such as Indianapolis, Milwaukee, Portland, Sacramento, the Twin Cities and so on can\u2019t scratch James\u2019 itches for either championship-worthy depth chart or spotlight. New York and Chicago, among the biggies, are out of synch with his timeline. Toronto? No way James is resettling his brand north of the border, and given his stated desire for teammates who have not just sufficient basketball skills but also mental toughness, well, the Raptors teams he and the Cavs have dominated do not qualify. The Boston club that stretched Cleveland to seven games in the Eastern Conference finals is built for the long haul and would have to surrender much of that to adjust to James\u2019 career calendar. There\u2019s a little Kyrie problem lurking there and, truth be told, the Celtics look to be on their way and are doing just fine without the 33-year-old heading, one of these years, toward decline. At some point in each of the 2018 Finals\u2019 final three days, James spoke admiringly of the Warriors and the San Antonio Spurs title teams that blocked his path whether in Miami or Cleveland. He was at it again even as the Warriors were dousing the opponent\u2019s locker room at The Q with Moet champagne. \u201cI made the move in 2010 to be able to play with talented players, cerebral players that you could see things that happen before they happened on the floor,\u201d James said. \u201cWhen you feel like you\u2019re really good at your craft, I think it\u2019s always great to be able to be around other great minds as well and other great ballplayers. \u201cThat\u2019s never changed. Even when I came here in \u201914, I wanted to try to surround myself and surround this franchise with great minds and guys that actually think outside the box of the game and not just go out and play it.\u201d Where might James find that now or recruit that swiftly? Hard to say. There are asterisks and \u201cbuts\u201d everywhere: * If he were to sign with the Houston Rockets , James would be hitching his star to Chris Paul, a buddy with an injury history that\u2019s about the mirror opposite of his own. He would be teaming up with an elite coach in Mike D\u2019Antoni, something he\u2019s never had (though Miami\u2019s Erik Spoelstra was just young and unproven, on his way to big things). But it also would require another big ask of James Harden, who had to adapt last summer to Paul\u2019s arrival and need for the ball. * If James chooses the Lakers , he has the chance to hit reset with the league\u2019s glitziest franchise, in a market that can meet his every off-court wish and where he and his family already own one or more ultra-comfortable homes. The Lakers have young talent to help James transition into a lower-usage veteran\u2019s role, favored status as a destination team for other top free agents and the salary-cap space to get it done this summer with the likes of Paul George or his pal Paul. But that roster might not be capable of insta-contending, which could burn a season or two when James\u2019 clock most definitely is clicking. * If it\u2019s San Antonio , James could link up with the elite coach in Gregg Popovich, where the winning culture is in the DNA rather than some acquired taste. The Spurs have talent, particularly if Kawhi Leonard finds happiness again there. But they might not have enough to rattle the Warriors\u2019 cage. And for all their professed admiration, James and Popovich might both fare better by keeping their relationship long-distance vs. the 82-game grind. * If it\u2019s Golden State ? Perish the thought. The NBA might have to board up itself if competitive balance were capsized to that extent. And as Draymond Green shrewdly noted on Thursday, if James climbed aboard, it likely would require him and several other Golden State teammates to be dispatched to parts unknown. * If James prefers to stay East, where the winning comes easier, he could pick Philadelphia . The Sixers have two foundational young stars at positions that matter most, center Joel Embiid and point guard Ben Simmons. But Simmons is a non-shooter at the moment, the antithesis of what makes a great complementary LeBron teammate. As for Embiid, James never has had to play off of and service a top center. And Philly might feel like a basketball-only move, with the hungriest and most demanding of any new fan base he would embrace. * If it\u2019s Miami \u2013 wait, could it be Miami? Could he go second-home again? The Heat always strive to be competitive and offer a talent base deep enough for the East and lots of familiarity. But they also have players such as Hassan Whiteside and Dion Waiters whose mental approaches don\u2019t seem to fit the model James was cooing about in Golden State and with the Tim Duncan-era Spurs. * That brings us to Cleveland , where it\u2019s possible James might choose to remain. Staying with the Cavaliers, after leading them to four Finals and that heady 2016 title, would be the easiest choice as far as pressure to win. He owes these fans nothing anymore \u2013 in fact, had the bargain been offered to them in 2010 (\u201cLeBron will leave and win elsewhere for four years, but will come back and deliver a championship and four Finals trips\u201d), most would have grabbed it. Here, James and the fans who have watched him even through the interruption develop from ridiculously touted high schooler to one of the world\u2019s most famous athletes could grow older together. Then he could partner up and buy the team from owner Dan Gilbert for a long-term future. Certainly, staying has a certain place in his and the rest of the James clan\u2019s hearts. \u201cT he one thing that I\u2019ve always done is considered, obviously, my family,\u201d he said at series end Friday. \u201cUnderstanding especially where my boys are at this point in their age. They were a lot younger the last time I made a decision like this four years ago. I\u2019ve got a teenage boy, a pre-teen and a little girl that wasn\u2019t around as well. So sitting down and considering everything, my family is a huge part of whatever I\u2019ll decide to do in my career, and it will continue to be that.\u201d It\u2019s worth noting that as James contemplates his options as a modern pursuer of championship excellence, the prospect of him moving again qualifies at some level as a failure. Not just by the support system in Cleveland, where he and Gilbert have their friction and James gets snidely mentioned as the team\u2019s unofficial GM and head coach, but by him too. He\u2019s the one who went off to seek his \u201ccollege education\u201d in south Florida in what it takes to win, whether on the court, in the front office or in and around the seams 365 days a year, straight out of the Pat Riley handbook. The teams about which James talks so glowingly in Oakland now and in San Antonio then have cultures he covets, stability up and down the flowchart he craves. In Cleveland, for a variety of reasons, his team has been incapable of establishing and maintaining that to a lasting degree. He is part of that missed opportunity and he has to own it, no matter if he goes or stays. James is inseparable from the dynamic of the Cavaliers\u2019 ever-changing and often melodramatic roster maneuvers. Spending big, swapping out draft picks to import current stars and supporting players, and overvaluing secondary guys like Smith and Tristan Thompson are risks the Warriors and the Spurs largely avoided thanks to shrew drafting and laudable continuity. The Cavs\u2019 scrap heap, by contrast, is high with traded picks, scuttled plans, panic deals, short-term patches and folks such as former coach David Blatt and former GM David Griffin. And maybe James could have nurtured a little better relationship with All-Star point guard and 2016 title sidekick Kyrie Irving, enough to have kept Irving from bailing on them all with his trade demand last summer. Now he\u2019s on the verge of casting about again, prioritizing what matters most for however long he continues to play. James is more at peace with it than he was before, particularly in 2010, and surely can enjoy the leverage he wields and the riches it delivers. But there is a burden there as well, one that could be seen as completing a circle. So many of the NBA\u2019s greatest stars have been stuck playing and living in the Age of LeBron, right? Their paths to the Finals blocked, on one whole side of the league, by him and his? Well, LeBron James is stuck now in the Era of the Warriors, freshly swept and anxious to close the gap. What goes around comes around, though the key more pressing of the big W\u2019s now is, where? * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Very, very smart defensively. He knows pretty much every set. He kind of flies around and dictates their defense, either on the perimeter or protecting the rim as well.\u201d Here\u2019s the thing: LeBron James could be as good a defender as Draymond Green. Even better. James certainly has the basketball I.Q. \u201cHe\u2019s probably one of the smartest guys to ever play the game,\u201d Green said about James not long after the compliments went in the other direction. And James, of course, is both bigger and quicker than Green. He can \u201cfly around\u201d on the perimeter and protect the rim as well as any non-center in this league. Two years ago, the U.S. National Team allowed 117 points per 100 possessions over their last three pool play games at the 2016 Olympics. The Americans were undefeated, but their defense had been porous, to say the least. And as they were prepping for the elimination rounds, one staffer noted that it was on defense \u201cwhere we really miss LeBron.\u201d James had played in each of the last three Olympics, but skipped 2016. Before the U.S. figured things out defensively in the elimination rounds in \u201916, the staffer pointed out that James\u2019 defensive instincts and athleticism erased a lot of his teammates mistakes on that end of the floor. The Cleveland Cavaliers made a lot of defensive mistakes this season. They ranked 29th out of 30 teams in defensive efficiency, and that shouldn\u2019t be a surprise to those who watched them throughout the season. The defensive breakdowns were commonplace from night to night. The Cavs ranked in the bottom six in both opponent field goal percentage in the paint and opponent effective field goal percentage from outside the paint. They ranked 26th in regard to both forcing turnovers and forcing the least efficient shots on the floor (those between the restricted area and 3-point range). In James\u2019 four seasons in Miami, the Heat ranked no worse than 11th defensively. In the four seasons prior to that, the Cavs (under head coach Mike Brown) ranked no worse than 11th as well. Since his return to Cleveland, the Cavs have ranked 20th, 10th, 22nd and 29th defensively. The year they ranked 10th is the year they won the championship. And the 2017-18 Cavs, having allowed 3.4 more points per 100 possessions than the league average, were, by far, the worst defensive team that James has been on in his 15 seasons in the league.  James certainly wasn\u2019t an innocent bystander in regard to the Cavs\u2019 defensive issues. He was at the center of many of their breakdowns and was often the last guy back in transition. In Game 3 of The Finals, James was probably too eager to pass the Kevin Durant defensive assignment off to a teammate. A huge performance from Durant in a back-and-fourth game was calling for the Cavs\u2019 best defender to take on the challenge of slowing him down. But on a couple of possessions late in the fourth quarter, Andre Iguodala didn\u2019t have to set much of a screen to get James switched off of Durant, who, because James wasn\u2019t fighting through the softest of screens, got his choice of defender on every possession. James played 82 regular-season games for the first time in his career. Including postseason, he played 650 more minutes than any other player this season. Since he was drafted in 2003, he\u2019s played more than 10,000 more minutes than anybody else. There is only so much gas in the tank and most of this season\u2019s gas was spent carrying an offense that clearly missed Kyrie Irving in the most critical moments. With more defenses that switch every screen, players who can create in one-on-one situations are more valuable. With Irving in Boston and with Isaiah Thomas ineffective in his five months with the Cavs, James has been the only one on his team with the ability to punish opposing defenses off the dribble. In The Finals, the Warriors didn\u2019t help off James\u2019 teammates until he got into the paint, making it imperative for him do get there as often as possible, both for his own scoring opportunities and for his teammates to get open shots. That takes a ton of energy. And not enough was left for continuous effort on defense, in the regular season or in the playoffs. But, between Games 3 and 4, James wouldn\u2019t admit that the load he\u2019s had to carry on one end of the floor affected his effort on the other end. \u201cThe load that I have to carry offensively, it\u2019s been what the season has asked for,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously, we haven\u2019t had many playmakers throughout the course of the season. We had some early on, and we made the trades and things of that nature. But it\u2019s been what the season has called for, and I\u2019ve taken that responsibility to be able to have to make plays for myself and make plays for my teammates as well. \u201cDefensively, we\u2019ve surrounded ourselves with some more wing defenders this year that allowed me to not have to exert so much energy defensively. But whenever the number has been called for me to defend, I\u2019ve been always taking that responsibility. So I don\u2019t think that\u2019s changed.\u201d James was probably too generous in regard to the capabilities of the Cavs\u2019 other perimeter defenders. In his 28th game against the Warriors over the last four years, J.R. Smith was still getting confused on off-ball switches, leaving Stephen Curry\u2019s screener free for layups far too often. In regard to per-game point differential, the Cavs were the worst team to reach The Finals in the last 27 years. Over 104 games (regular season and playoffs), they outscored their opponents by a total of just 39 points. The Warriors finished a plus-700. Despite the departure of Irving, the Cavs\u2019 offense remained in the top five this season. And it had its moments in the playoffs, torching the Toronto Raptors (a top-five defensive team) in the conference semis. But the defense was mostly terrible, worse than that of the Sacramento Kings in the regular season. And the bad habits that built up over 82 games were on full display as the Warriors picked it apart in The Finals, scoring 120 points per 100 possessions over the four games. That the Cavs became the first team since the league started counting turnovers 41 years ago to rank in the bottom three in defensive efficiency and win a playoff series is a tribute to James\u2019 brilliance on offense. That they reached The Finals a fourth straight year makes it clear that he\u2019s still the best player in the world at 33 years old. But we can\u2019t call him the league\u2019s best defender or anything close to it \u2026 until he plays for a team that allows him be. * * * John Schuhmann is a staff writer for NBA.com.

That title they coughed up in 2016 after leading the Cleveland Cavaliers 3-1 is long gone now. Whatever the Warriors\u2019 star-studded core group will do in the future has yet to be determined. What they are now, however, after demolishing the Cavaliers 108-85 Friday night at Quicken Loans Arena, is exactly who and what we thought they would be this season: the most dominant team in basketball for the second straight season. The Warriors defended their title, smashing the Cavaliers on their way to the first sweep in The Finals since the San Antonio Spurs did the same to a young LeBron James-led crew on this floor in 2007 . They looked as decisive, as dominant and as devastating as they have all season on this final night, running circles around the Cavaliers after halftime in a runaway affair. It was the ninth sweep in Finals history and the largest margin of victory (+60) in a sweep. The Warriors wore the bullseye the rest of the league chased all season, the one the angry fans of other teams griped about all season and wore it well as the once lovable team people suddenly love to hate. \u201cThat\u2019s how you know we\u2019re a great team is when everybody\u2019s coming after us,\u201d Durant said. \u201cWhether it\u2019s opponents, whether it\u2019s different coaches panning for us, whether it\u2019s the fans, the media that hate us, it feels good when you\u2019re the team that everybody\u2019s gunning for. It makes us better. It makes us come to work and try to play at that championship level every single day, and that\u2019s the hardest part. \u201cBut, you know, I\u2019m glad we were able to lock in, especially in the playoffs, and do what we were supposed to do to win this thing.\u201d The fourth straight time against a clearly overmatched James and this latest iteration of the Cavaliers, was over early in the Warriors\u2019 favorite third quarter, that spot all season where they\u2019ve separated themselves from the competition. Kevin Durant won his second straight Finals MVP and finished with a 20-point, 12-rebound, 10-assist triple-double. He\u2019s gone from a superstar in search of a ring just two summers ago to a man with one for each ring finger. Stephen Curry, the two-time Kia MVP who missed the first six games of the postseason recovering from a knee injury, capped this series off with a game-high 37 points, saving some of his very best work from distance for what might be the last twist with a LeBron-led Cavaliers team. James heads off into free agency July 1 wearing a cast on his right arm , courtesy of a self-inflicted injury after the Cavaliers late-game meltdown in the opener. His future destination as uncertain right now as it was four years ago when he left Miami to return home. There is no such uncertainty surrounding these Warriors. They have now shoved their way into the conversation about the best teams ever assembled. You don\u2019t storm to three titles in four years, set the regular-season wins record at 73 two years ago, and not gain entry into that elite club. The fact that their core group of Curry, Durant and All-Stars Draymond Green and Klay Thompson are all 30 or younger and in the primes of their respective careers, is the most frightening part for the rest of the league. They\u2019re this good, this dominant now \u2014 James went to the bench for good with just over four minutes to play and the Warriors leading 102-77 \u2014 and could keep improving. The Warriors are stacked for the foreseeable future and so long as they are reasonably healthy, they\u2019ll continue to be a roadblock for any other team in the NBA with championship ambitions, including whatever team LeBron plays on. LeBron has ruled the Eastern Conference for eight straight years, the first four in Miami and the last four here in his native Northeast Ohio. He played all 82 games for the first time in his career, 15 years deep into his storied career. He delivered the Cavaliers from the brink of elimination in the first round against Indiana , swept top-seeded Toronto in the conference semifinals and then rescued the Cavaliers from the brink of elimination in the Eastern Conference finals against Boston, leading his team to a Game 7 win on the road to make it back here. \u201cTo be the best player in the world and to give everything you\u2019ve got in your 15th season, play all 82 games, probably one of the greatest playoff runs that we\u2019ll ever see from an individual, to carry this team the way he did all season and leading by example, it\u2019s just a testament to his character and who he is as a person and as a player,\u201d said Cavaliers coach Tyronn Lue. \u201cHe had a lot of opportunities where he could have sat out of games and was going through a tough stretch and wasn\u2019t playing well, but he didn\u2019t want to do that. And a lot of guys would have folded under those circumstances, but he didn\u2019t. He\u2019s a bad boy, and I love having him on our team. He fights and competes to the end. \u201cSometimes you can give everything you\u2019ve got and still come up short. I thought that\u2019s what our group of guys did in this series. That\u2019s about it.\u201d Whatever James decides to do in free agency , whether that\u2019s depart for a new opportunity elsewhere or remain here and try to mount yet another Finals run in wine and gold, the Warriors will still be waiting at the end of the line. Because the thirst for more of this remains for Durant, Curry, Green, Thompson and the rest of the Warriors, who won their first title on this floor in 2015 . They\u2019ve grown accustomed to celebrating these moments away from home. They were on the brink of elimination in the Western Conference finals two weeks ago, down 3-2 to the Houston Rockets and without home court advantage against their new rivals, who added Chris Paul via trade last summer to a James-Harden-led cast specifically designed to take them down. But with Paul out with a hamstring injury the final two games, the Warriors woke up and rebounded for a Game 6 win at Oracle Arena and a Game 7 romp at Toyota Center to lock down he fourth straight date with the Cavaliers in The Finals. They survived Game 1 , needing a George Hill missed free throw and a J.R. Smith gaffe at the end of regulation, to provide the space for their overtime win. Curry went nuclear with a Finals record nine made 3-pointers to spark their Game 2 win in Oakland. And Durant did the honors here in Wednesday\u2019s Game 3, roasting the Cavaliers for 43 points, including a decisive 3-pointer in what was a one-point game in the final minute, 13 rebounds and seven assists to set up Friday night\u2019s clincher. Warriors coach Steve Kerr talked all season long of this fourth campaign being the toughest. The Rockets passed them up in the standings during the regular season. \u201cExtremely difficult. Not just the playoff run, this entire season,\u201d Green said of the heavy lifting it required to win it all again. \u201cYou\u2019re coming off a championship and you\u2019re expected to get back to that level for Game 1 of 82. Like it\u2019s tough. You know, he had time where he missed. Kevin, myself, Klay, Steph, Jordan Bell, like you name it, guys missed time. All the injuries we went through while going through that grind of trying to get back to this position was extremely tough. \u201cHowever, we pride ourselves on our depth, and at different times in the season, our depth stepped up. You know, even throughout the playoffs, Andre going down, Steph starting the playoffs out, like other guys stepped up, and that\u2019s what\u2019s important.\u201d And they looked mortal early on in the playoffs without Curry, after winning their first 15 playoff games with Durant en route to last season\u2019s title. The grind of playing to the final night of the season for a fourth straight year, the wear and tear accrued and the exhausting physical and emotional toll uninterrupted championship contention takes on any group can be overwhelming. But not for this group. \u201cI remember sitting in this room three years ago, it seemed like a dream.,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cThis feels more like reality. And I hope that doesn\u2019t sound arrogant. It\u2019s just that\u2019s the talent we have, and that\u2019s the experience we\u2019ve gained. But it\u2019s a very different feeling. It\u2019s still euphoric, but three years ago was I can\u2019t believe this happened, and now it\u2019s I can definitely believe this happened, but it was hard, and it gets more and more difficult as you go through. \u201cNext year will be even tougher. I may not show up until All-Star break because they\u2019re not going to listen to me anyway. Thank you.\u201d Kerr was in a playful mood after the game and it was well-earned. The Warriors basked in the glow of this latest triumph. Durant dancing with both the Larry O\u2019Brien and Bill Russell trophies during the post-game celebration in the middle of the court, while Curry, Green, Thompson, 2015 Finals MVP Andre Iguodala and the rest of the crew followed suit as they posed for pictures. \u201cGet used to it,\u201d Thompson said, \u201cbecause we\u2019re just getting started.\u201d * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

This time, the Warriors took care of business in Game 4 of The Finals , finishing the 2017-18 season off with a 108-85 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers. Stephen Curry (37 points) and Kevin Durant (20 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists) led the way, and the Warriors\u2019 defense was terrific, holding the Cavs to just 34 percent shooting. Durant was named Finals MVP for the second straight year. One stat stood out from the rest as the Warriors won their second straight championship and their third in the last four years. 100.5 \u2014  Points allowed per 100 possessions by the Warriors in the postseason . What makes the Warriors as good as they are is that, at their best, they are both the league\u2019s best offensive team and its best defensive team. The champs have never relied on just their talent to get by. Well, maybe a little bit in the regular season after three straight trips to The Finals. After ranking in the top four defensively in each of the previous four seasons, the Warriors fell to ninth in defensive efficiency this year . It was the product of fatigue and disinterest, and it frustrated the coaching staff. But in the postseason, the Warriors flipped the switch defensively. They were the No. 1 defensive team in each round of the playoffs, holding all four opponents to at least five fewer points per 100 possessions than they scored in the regular season. The 100.5 points per 100 possessions they allowed were both 2.5 fewer than any other team allowed in this postseason and 3.7 fewer than the Warriors allowed in the regular season, making them the most improved defensive team from the regular season to the playoffs. The Warriors\u2019 defense was at its best with their season on the line. In winning games 6 and 7 of the conference finals , they held the Houston Rockets (one of the best offenses in NBA history) to just 92 points per 100 possessions . And they did that without one of their best defensive players, Andre Iguodala, who missed the last four games of that series and the first two games of The Finals . Of course, the Warriors\u2019 most impactful defender remains Draymond Green, who led the postseason with 41 steals and 79 deflections , while ranking second with 31 blocked shots . The Warriors were more than five points per 100 possessions better defensively with Green on the floor (allowing 99.5) than they were with him off the floor (104.6). The Warriors\u2019 talent is a problem for the rest of the league. That the Warriors\u2019 talent plays great defense is an even bigger problem.

The cause: He punched something after Game 1 of the finals , his frustration having obviously boiled way over when the Cleveland Cavaliers let the series opener against the Golden State Warriors get away amid late-game miscues and one overturned call that left him seething. The injury was never disclosed, and James played basically every minute for the rest of the series and put up great numbers. James didn\u2019t get the only reward he still seeks from the game of basketball. There will be no parade for him this year, no ring, no banner ceremony. All James has now is a few weeks to think, a few weeks to ponder his next move. With that, the watch is on. What will LeBron James do next? \u201dI have no idea at this point,\u201d James said. This ending \u2013 a loss \u2013 was inevitable: For as good as James was this season, his Cavaliers were not good enough. No one gave them a chance to beat the Golden State Warriors, for obvious reasons. And the ending was a sweep, the second of James\u2019 career in the NBA Finals and perhaps a most unceremonious end to his time in Cleveland. The final on Friday night was Golden State 108, Cleveland 85 . The Cavaliers probably should have won Game 1 and had a great chance to win Game 3, but there\u2019s no doubting who the better team is. The Warriors are better. James knows that. The Warriors are smarter. James knows that, too. He scored 23 points in Game 4, by far his lowest-output game of the series. The Cavs led briefly in the first half, but it was over shortly after halftime. James was subbed out for Cedi Osman with 4:03 remaining, shook hands with a few of the Warriors players on his way to the bench, and walked off the court shortly after time expired. \u201dHe\u2019s a bad boy, and I love having him on our team,\u201d Cavaliers coach Tyronn Lue said. \u201dHe fights and competes to the end. Sometimes you can give everything you\u2019ve got and still come up short. I thought that\u2019s what our group of guys did in this series.\u201d It\u2019s entirely possible that James left the floor Friday night knowing he was wearing a Cavaliers uniform for the last time. But it\u2019s hard to envision a scenario where James knows where he\u2019s going \u2013 if anywhere. Houston and the Los Angeles Lakers are oft-mentioned as possible James destinations \u2013 but since they\u2019re in the Western Conference that would mean potentially dealing with the Warriors earlier in the playoffs. He could go to Philadelphia and join an up-and-coming team, albeit one now dealing with front-office questions after the resignation of Bryan Colangelo in a Twitter-use scandal. He could return to Miami, a place he still loves. Thing is, there\u2019s no obvious choice. His decision will be based on what his family wants and where he can win. \u201dMy family is a huge part of whatever I\u2019ll decide,\u201d James said. Even if the Lakers landed James and another top-flight player like a Paul George this summer, it\u2019s still hard to see them being ready to overtake the Rockets and Warriors out West. Philadelphia might be on the cusp of contending in the East, but doesn\u2019t seem like a championship club yet. Houston may seem like the move, though it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess how a James-Chris Paul-James Harden trio would work. All that\u2019s clear is this: Cleveland isn\u2019t winning another NBA title anytime soon with a roster that looks like the one it had in this series. And James wants more rings. That\u2019s why he spends well over $1 million a year to tweak and hone his body. That\u2019s why, in his 15th NBA season, he was as dominant as ever. He is showing no signs of fading \u2013 yet. But he\u2019s 33. Father Time is undefeated. James\u2019 window of greatness will close, someday. \u201dI think maybe the greatest testament to LeBron is that five years ago he was one of the top five players of all time,\u201d Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. \u201dFrom five years ago until now, it seems like he\u2019s 10 times better, because he\u2019s added so much skill to his game.\u201d James can leave without owing Northeast Ohio anything. He came back. He brought Cleveland an NBA title. He has given the city so much. Still, James will never forget the infamous letter that Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert penned when he left for Miami in 2010. Whether he stays or goes, it\u2019s now the summer of LeBron again. Many free-agent moves around the league after July 1 will be held up while teams wait to see what James does. His decision, whatever it is, could mean Kevin Love gets traded. His decision, whatever it is, could decide whether Lue returns as coach. His decision, whatever it is, will dictate if Cleveland is a contender next season or a tanker. There really isn\u2019t any in-between. It\u2019s all up to James. How the league looks a year from now hinges in so many ways on what he decides a few weeks from now. \u201dWe\u2019ll see what happens,\u201d James said. With that, he was gone. Cleveland can only hope he comes back."},{"id":40043,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/kevin-durant-earns-nba-finals-mvp","date":"2018-06-09","title":"Golden State Warriors forward Kevin Durant claims second Finals MVP","content":"CLEVELAND \u2014 Kevin Durant went back-to-back, twice.

He\u2019s jet-setting from one NBA city to another, working out in front of curious coaches and inquisitive general managers. He\u2019s more at ease now that he\u2019s gotten past the big draft decision, and the 6-foot-4 guard finds it a little more challenging to go out, too. It\u2019s all part of his new, professional world. \u201dI\u2019m a lot more recognizable now,\u201d DiVincenzo joked Friday in Indianapolis. \u201dI used to be able to go to the mall or the movies. Now I can\u2019t really do that because people come up to me all the time. But it\u2019s a good problem to have.\u201d Yes, success sometimes comes with a price. He also knows it could be much worse. Not many 21-year-olds are introduced as a two-time NCAA champion and DiVincenzo is the only one who actually holds the title of the Final Four\u2019s reigning Most Outstanding Player. The tough guy who grew up in Delaware and stole the hearts of the Philadelphia fans with his gritty play, relentless effort and sensational shooting at Villanova must now prove himself all over again in front of some of the sport\u2019s biggest names. His audience Friday included two former decision-makers for the Indiana Pacers- Donnie Walsh and Larry Bird. Both still work for the team, though Kevin Pritchard is the team\u2019s president of basketball operations. Coach Nate McMillan and his assistants also monitored the workouts, which included Ohio State\u2019s Keita Bates-Diop, Cincinnati\u2019s Gary Clark and Central Florida\u2019s A.J. Davis, the son of former Pacers player Antonio Davis. But DiVincenzo was the feature attraction. He dazzled the small audience with another strong shooting performance, rekindling visions of the 31-point game he had on championship night as the Wildcats blew past Michigan for their second championship in three years. And he thought he answered some of the questions league executives have been asking. \u201dBefore the combine, there were a lot of questions about whether I could guard multiple positions,\u201d he said. \u201dI think they can put me anywhere on the floor. I pride myself on defending and rebounding.\u201d The combine also convinced DiVincenzo it was time to leave school early. After receiving one of 60 invitations to work out in Chicago, DiVincenzo was almost certain he should go. But there was one more step, meeting with Villanova coach Jay Wright, as the pressure mounted to make his decision official before the May 31 deadline. \u201dPersonally, I knew before the deadline. I knew I was ready, but I didn\u2019t want to make an irrational decision,\u201d DiVincenzo said. \u201dIf I wouldn\u2019t have gotten an invite, it might have sent a message to me.\u201d Now he\u2019s in, working out and hoping to improve his draft stock. As for his plans on draft night, June 21, they haven\u2019t been finalized. But a big blowout just isn\u2019t DiVincenzo\u2019s style. \u201dI might just have a small draft party in Philly,\u201d he said."},{"id":40059,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/marvin-bagley-labels-deandre-ayton-no-1-talk-disrespectful","date":"2018-06-08","title":"Marvin Bagley on Deandre Ayton saying he knows he'll be No. 1 pick: 'Disrespectful'","content":"PHOENIX (AP) \u2014 Marvin Bagley III has heard just about enough about how Deandre Ayton is the favorite to become the Phoenix Suns\u2019 choice as the No. 1 pick in this month\u2019s NBA draft. Bagley thinks he, not Ayton, deserves to be at the top of the draft and got a chance to make his case in an individual workout with the Suns on Friday. \u201cI definitely believe I\u2019m the No. 1 pick,\u201d Bagley said, \u201cand if the Suns take me I\u2019ll definitely show them why.\u201d Ayton took it a step further when he worked out for the Suns on Wednesday, saying \u201cI know I\u2019m going No. 1.\u201d He said that Phoenix would be his only pre-draft workout. Bagley, on the other hand, said he will work out for the Sacramento Kings and Atlanta Hawks, the teams with the No. 2 and No. 3 picks, respectively. \u201cDeandre, he\u2019s going to do what he\u2019s going to do. That\u2019s his plan,\u201d Bagley said. \u201cAll I can do is control what I can control and do what I love to do and just show different teams what I\u2019m capable of doing. I can\u2019t really worry about what other people are doing at this point. This is an important time in my life right now, something I\u2019ve been working toward my whole basketball career.\u201d Bagley hears all the speculation that Ayton will go No. 1 and said he uses it as motivation. \u201cIt\u2019s disrespectful and I use it as drive every single day,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the end of the day, this is all talk right now. Eventually we\u2019ll have to go on the court and we\u2019ll have to play. That\u2019s where all the talking ends.\u201d Asked if he would have a \u201clife-long\u201d chip on his shoulder against the Suns if Phoenix didn\u2019t pick him, Bagley answered, \u201cI\u2019m a competitive person. You never want to come in last. You always put the work in to be great and to get to that next level. That\u2019s just the type of player that I am. So, to answer the question, yes.\u201d Fans in Phoenix have known about Bagley for years. He grew up in suburban Chandler, leading his high school to the state championship as a ninth grader. From there, Bagley shifted to other basketball-oriented schools. He and Ayton were even teammates for a season at Hillcrest Prep in Phoenix. Bagley finished his prep career at Sierra Canyon in Chatsworth, California, before his one outstanding season at Duke. He and Ayton are 19 years old and very big but with different games. Ayton, 7-foot-1 and 260 pounds, is seen as strictly a center by the Suns. Bagley, 6-11 and 234 pounds, is a power forward who might someday play some at center in the NBA, Suns general manager Ryan McDonough said. So their individual workouts were different. \u201cWe probably had Marvin do a little more ball-handling and a little more perimeter shooting and a little bit less around the basket than Deandre did,\u201d McDonough said. The Suns plan more workouts with No. 1 candidates this weekend. McDonough didn\u2019t say who would work out when but he mentioned Mohamed Bamba of Texas and Jaren Jackson Jr. of Michigan State as players being considered for the top spot. Another is European sensation Luka Doncic, who is playing professionally in Spain. \u201cIt seems like there are multiple guys who are worthy,\u201d McDonough said. \u201cSome years, to be honest with you, probably don\u2019t have any guys who deserve it but somebody has to go one.\u201d Bagley certainly has the credentials. He was the SEC player of the year, averaging 21 points and 11.1 rebounds per game. He believes he is best in an up-and-down, open-court game. \u201cBeing able to get the ball and go off of rebounds and pushing,\u201d Bagley said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more space now than there is in college. Just being able to play in open space and getting out and running. I think that\u2019s where my best is when we\u2019re running and everybody\u2019s not thinking and having fun.\u201d He said he wants to show NBA teams \u201cthat I\u2019m an overall player.\u201d \u201cI can do a lot inside and out, offensively and defensively,\u201d Bagley said. \u201cI just want to be able to have that mindset of coming in and showing everybody a full game, a full package.\u201d"},{"id":46779,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/commission-seeks-audit-sterling-brown-milwaukee-bucks-arrest","date":"2018-06-08","title":"Milwaukee commission seeks audit of Sterling Brown's arrest","content":"MILWAUKEE (AP) \u2014 The Milwaukee Fire and Police Commission is calling for an audit of the stun gun arrest of Milwaukee Bucks guard Sterling Brown .

That OKC team featured household names in All-Stars Paul George and Russell Westbrook and was expected before 2017-18 began to have a chance at a deep playoff run. George can opt out of his contract this summer and become a free agent, and if he does, several teams will be in pursuit of his services. Jazz rookie Donovan Mitchell \u2014 who keyed Utah\u2019s ousting of OKC \u2014 says he plans to try and sell George on signing with his squad if he does enter free agency. In a podcast with ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski , Mitchell says he \u201cdefinitely\u201d plans to talk with George come the open of free agency on July 1. Here\u2019s more from The Salt Lake Tribune \u2018s Aaron Falk on Mitchell\u2019s comments: Mitchell also said in the ESPN podcast that in the coaching of Quin Snyder, the defensive prowess of center Rudy Gobert and more, the Jazz have plenty to offer marquee free agents. In his exit interview with the Thunder shortly after their Game 6 loss to the Jazz, George sounded open to staying with OKC this summer. \u201cI think the biggest thing is just trying to keep a relationship with Sam (Presti, general manager of the Thunder), continue to talk with Sam. Continue to talk with Billy, with Russ, and figure out the direction we want to go as a group, more so than anything,\u201d George said. \u201cThat\u2019s always been, I feel with players, they want that option,\u201d George said then about his free agency. \u201cBut then you go into an organization where they kind of check the boxes on all the things that you want out of an organization, then immediately they become a candidate to where you want to play long-term.\u201d * * *"},{"id":40094,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/finals-film-study-stephen-curry-golden-state-warriors-cleveland-cavaliers","date":"2018-06-08","title":"Finals Film Study: Despite poor shooting, Stephen Curry draws attention in Game 3","content":"* Tonight on ABC:  Warriors vs. Cavs, Game 4 (9 ET) CLEVELAND \u2014 Stephen Curry has played in 89 postseason games, and in none of the previous 88 had he shot as poorly as he did in Game 3 of the 2018 Finals . Of course, the Golden State Warriors won Game 3 with an efficient offensive performance despite Curry shooting 3-for-16, including 1-for-10 on 3-pointers. One reason is that Kevin Durant had himself a night , scoring 43 points, with 28 of them coming on an incredible 11-for-15 from outside the paint . Another reason is that the Warriors scored 48 points in the restricted area , tying their high for the postseason. They didn\u2019t shoot as well in the restricted area as they did in Games 1 and 2 ( 82 percent ), but their 37 attempts there were five more than they\u2019ve had in any other game in these playoffs. It\u2019s been written here before (including between Games 2 and 3 ) how the Warriors leverage their 3-point shooting (along with the Cleveland Cavaliers\u2019 defensive issues) to get better shots (layups and dunks). But the attention paid to Curry in Game 3 was particularly important in getting shots at the basket, and adds some context to that 3-for-16 performance. On the Warriors\u2019 first possession of the game, Curry fed Draymond Green at the high post. Green proceeded to fake a hand-off to Curry\u2026 Appropriately, J.R. Smith made his first defensive mistake of Game 3 just 20 seconds in, initially staying with Curry as Tristan Thompson switched onto the shooter. Green went right to the basket and Smith was forced to foul. On the Warriors\u2019 next possession, JaVale McGee set an off-ball screen for Curry beyond the 3-point line\u2026 Once again, the big (Kevin Love this time) switched onto Curry. And once again, Smith stayed with Curry too. This time McGee was free to roll to the basket, where Green found him for a dunk. The Warriors may be the most difficult team to defend in NBA history, but it\u2019s kind of amazing that, in his 27th game against the Warriors over the last four seasons, Smith is making the same mistakes over and over again. Smith scored five points in the first minute and a half of Game 3, but he gave four right back to the defending champs. After Game 3 and again after practice on Thursday, LeBron James put an emphasis on having \u201ccerebral\u201d players in this league. \u201cNot only do you have to have the talent,\u201d James said Thursday, \u201cyou have to have the minds as well. \u201cWe\u2019re all NBA players. Everybody knows how to put the ball in the hoop. But who can think throughout the course of the game?\u201d After having their switches punished too often in Games 1 and 2, the Cavs chose to trap Curry in Game 3. And that just freed up the Warriors\u2019 bigs for more dunks and layups. Midway through the second quarter, Jordan Bell set a screen for Curry on the left side of the floor, triggering a trap from Smith and Love\u2026 Curry quickly got off the ball. Green was his release valve and the Warriors had a 4-on-3 situation. Rather than settle for a jumper, Green attacked Tristan Thompson and found Bell rolling to the basket before Love could recover. Bell drew a foul on almost the exact same play on the Warriors\u2019 next possession and again on a direct feed from Curry early in the fourth . To start the third quarter, McGee was the roll man taking the feed from Green in a slightly different spot on the floor . Midway through the fourth, Durant was the roll man, slipping the screen, taking the feed from Curry, and finding Andre Iguodala for a layup after weak-side help from Love . And the Warriors\u2019 final layup of Game 3 came when Curry slipped a screen, drew attention on the left wing, and found Green on the baseline . \u201cI thought we did a good job of taking the ball out of Steph\u2019s hands,\u201d Cavs coach Tyronn Lue said Thursday. \u201cThe first two games, I thought with the switches, he really hurt us. So we went to the blitzes and tried to get the ball out of his hands. When that happens, you\u2019re going to give up some easy shots for (JaVale) McGee and (Jordan) Bell and those guys.\u201d The best job in the Warriors\u2019 offense may be setting pin-down screens for Curry and Klay Thompson, because it can get you free layups a few times a night. A few minutes into the third quarter, Durant didn\u2019t set a textbook pin-down for Curry, but Curry came up from the baseline and the two exchanged places on the right wing, with James initially defending Durant and Smith initially on Curry. Once again, Smith stayed with Curry, while James chose to switch\u2026 Durant got a clean roll to the basket for a layup and James could do nothing but shake his head. On the Warriors\u2019 first possession of the fourth quarter, they ran an after-timeout play that started as a weave into a pick-and-roll with Bell setting a screen for Shaun Livingston. But that was just a decoy action to set up a back-screen set by Curry on Larry Nance Jr., who was guarding Bell. Rather than switching onto Bell, Jeff Green stayed with Curry, leaving Bell open under the basket. The Cavs defended Curry in Game 3 better than they did in Games 1 and 2. But the extra attention he got freed up some other things in the Warriors\u2019 offense, which has had its most efficient series (121 points scored per 100 possessions) of the playoffs . Curry finished with six assists, including a particularly gorgeous dime to Andre Iguodala in the first quarter when Smith left Iguodala under the basket to help on Curry\u2019s isolation on Love. Even in shooting 3-for-16, Curry was a valuable part of the Warriors\u2019 offense on Wednesday. And maybe he still deserves series consideration for Finals MVP should the Warriors win Game 4. * * * John Schuhmann is a staff writer for NBA.com.

He\u2019s already a champion and is playing on an All-Star studded Golden State Warriors team. Yet here he sits, four quarters away from back-to-back titles and membership in a historical club he never imagined possible earlier in his journeyman career. But playing with stars like two-time Kia MVP Stephen Curry, former Kia MVP and reigning Finals MVP Kevin Durant and All-Stars Klay Thompson and Draymond Green is a game-changer \u2014 not only for Warriors\u2019 stars, but also for the role players going along for the ride. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can comprehend what we\u2019re doing right now until it\u2019s over,\u201d McGee said, \u201cuntil five, 10 years later when you sit back and realize, \u2018wow, we really did our thing.\u2019 Because when you\u2019re in it, I\u2019m telling you, it\u2019s a whole different experience. Me coming from different teams and different organizations, I know how it really is. It\u2019s low-key depressing when you\u2019re not winning. So the things we get to do here, that we\u2019re doing here, it\u2019s amazing.  \u201cI know how glamorous it looks but I don\u2019t think people understand the humble nature of these superstars. I feel like people think they just wake up, show up to the games and hit 30-footers and do amazing things without a realizing that is preparation, that\u2019s dedication before and after practice and countless other times when the bright lights aren\u2019t on you, those rare times when no one is watching. It\u2019s serious.\u201d The Warriors are just as serious about chasing their opportunity to solidify their place in NBA history with a rare sweep in Game 4 of The Finals on Friday night against the Cleveland Cavaliers at Quicken Loans Arena. Only eight times in NBA history has there been a four-game wipeout to finish the season, the last time coming in 2007 when the Tim Duncan-led San Antonio Spurs did the honors here against LeBron James and Cavs during his first stint ( and first career Finals run ) with the franchise. Avoiding that nasty bit of his history for a second time will require yeoman\u2019s work from James and his current crew against a Warriors team that ranks among the NBA\u2019s best and most accomplished championship squads ever. Win a third title in four years and they have to be mentioned with the greatest teams of the modern era \u2026 the \u201cShowtime\u201d Los Angeles Lakers , the original \u201cBig 3\u201d Boston Celtics , \u201cThe Bad Boy\u201d Detroit Pistons , Michael Jordan\u2019s Chicago Bulls , the \u201cClutch City\u201d Houston Rockets , the Shaquille O\u2019Neal-Kobe Bryant Lakers , the Duncan-era Spurs and the \u201cMiami Heatles\u201d (led by James, Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade). The Warriors are that good, that accomplished. Save for a Green miscue two years ago, they could be four quarters away from completing an unprecedented four-peat. It took Cleveland\u2019s historic comeback from a 3-1 deficit in 2016 to interrupt the Warriors\u2019 current run of greatness. No team in league history has rebounded from a 3-0 deficit in a best-of-seven series \u2014 131 teams have tried and 131 have failed. And none of those previous teams have had to deal with a group like these Warriors. They were champions in 2015 with their organic group led by Curry, Thompson, Green and Iguodala. In 2015-16, they came close to repeating after setting the NBA record for the best regular season in history with 73 wins . They\u2019ve been out of this world since Durant joined them, going 16-1 in the 2017 playoffs and were undefeated at Oracle Arena en route to this group\u2019s second title . And now here they are, on the cusp of defending that title and establishing themselves as the signature team of this era and one of the truly great groups of all-time. James has dealt with them four straight years and knows them better than anyone. He\u2019s got an appreciation for what it means to battle them, win or lose, for the ultimate prize. \u201cObviously, from a talent perspective, if you\u2019re looking at Golden State from their top five best players to our top five players, you would say they\u2019re stacked better than us,\u201d James said. \u201cLet\u2019s just speak truth. Kevin Durant. You\u2019ve got two guys with MVPs on their team. And then you\u2019ve got a guy in Klay who could easily be on a team and carry a team, score 40 in a quarter before. And then you have Draymond, who is arguably one of the best defenders and minds we have in our game. So you have that crew. \u201cThen you add on a Finals MVP coming off the bench, a number one pick in Livingston and an All-Star in David West and whatever the case may be. So they have a lot of talent. We have a lot of talent as well. We\u2019ve been in a position where we could win two out of these three games \u2026 when you\u2019re playing [them], like I stated last night, the room for error versus a team like this is slim to none. And I think I said last night it\u2019s like playing the Patriots. It\u2019s like playing San Antonio. The room for error is slim to none. When you make mistakes they make you pay, because they\u2019re already more talented than you are but they also have the minds behind it, too, and they also have the championship DNA. The collective basketball IQ, an underrated mental and physical toughness and determination along with rock-solid chemistry among the core group has allowed for additions and subtractions without any disturbance of the collective peace. Durant\u2019s fit was seamless, an unfair advantage if you ask anyone not bathed in Warriors\u2019 blue and gold, for a team that didn\u2019t need the boost. \u201c I think No. 1, you really learn where a guy \u2019 s IQ is , \u201d  Green, the fire-breathing, emotional leader of this bunch said of how this crew has managed the egos of a new core that fuels this machine. \u201c And then you kind of adjust to that. IQ isn \u2019 t gonna be everyone \u2019 s strength. You look at LeBron, he \u2019 s probably one of the smartest players to ever play the game. You can \u2019 t say that about the rest of the Cavs team. He \u2019 s special in that aspect. But it \u2019 s on him to make sure what he does rubs off on them, and he puts them in the right spots. And he do that. \u201c As far as we go, when you look at guys having a high IQ on our team, it \u2019 s our job to make sure we \u2019 re doing whatever we can to help other guys who may not be as strong in that area, \u201d  Green continued.  \u201c I think that all comes from the system we play in. The culture that we \u2019 ve built. You don \u2019 t want to be the short thumb sticking out.  I think it \u2019 s one of the most underrated things when you \u2019 re talking about the success that we \u2019 ve had. Because you can \u2019 t really measure it. \u201d Kerr has done his best to refrain from putting his team in a box. Why confine them to a predetermined space now, while they are in the midst of crafting their own narrative and carving out their own place among the game\u2019 s greatest teams? Playing on a championship teams with both the Bulls and Spurs gives Kerr a perspective few people on the planet have of teams of this ilk. So when he speaks glowingly of his team, their accomplishments and the era they are dominating, it\u2019 s not just obligatory praise. The reverent tone is genuine and appreciative of the sacrifice and struggle required to get here. \u201cIt really is shocking when you see the talent, \u201d  Kerr said.  \u201c I was telling our staff after the game last night: I played in five Finals; I don\u2019t think I ever saw anybody make a 30-foot shot in the middle of the game, much less four of them, which K.D. did last night, I believe, and which Steph did multiple times the game before, which LeBron did multiple times in Game 1. \u201cThe talent level right now I think is at an all-time high in the league. It\u2019s very different. You don\u2019t have the aircraft carriers, you don\u2019t have Shaq and Patrick Ewing and Hakeem [Olajuwon]. But the skill level on the perimeter is so shocking. Sometimes I try to picture myself playing in The Finals now. Twenty years ago, I survived. It was tough, but I survived. I could find guys to guard. I can only imagine right now. LeBron would be pointing right at me saying, Come on up. We\u2019re going to set a screen with you. \u201cIt\u2019s gotten so tough. You have to have so much versatility and size and speed and strength to be able to survive on the floor because of this incredible skill level. Because these guys can make shots from 30, 35 feet without blinking. Now you\u2019ve got to go out there and pick them up. Now they\u2019re driving by you. And they\u2019ve got four three-point shooters in many cases, but usually at least two three- point shooters. Sometimes three or four surrounding them. So guarding and playing defense today is the most difficult it\u2019s ever been. \u201d That might be what makes this season so sweet for the players. Knowing what they had to grind through to get here, the regular-season fatigue, the challenge from Houston, the 3-2 deficit in the conference finals and that Game 7 on the Rockets\u2019  home floor . You go through all of that and you are right back here, knocking on the door of history being in The Finals for a fourth straight year. \u201cAt the end of every season and run that we\u2019ve had, there is always an appreciation for things you learn, things you\u2019ve gone through,\u201d Curry said. \u201cGoing into this season, I don\u2019t think anybody could have guessed or predicted the ups and downs and the roller coaster we\u2019ve been on. \u201cSo, definitely a different year, just overall, personally with injuries, as a team with dealing with injuries, dealing with the kind of expectations that have been placed on us from the outside and the noise around us as a team. Trying to understand that throughout the regular season we had to continue to get better, whether that was a slow process or not, and understand when the playoffs came around that probably wouldn\u2019t go 16-1 to win a championship. It\u2019s probably going to be a lot harder because teams are keying in on us and shifting their lineups and stuff like that. That\u2019s been how it\u2019s been. \u201cI think for us to do what we did in the Conference Finals and win a Game 7 on the road, we had never done that before. And now to be one game away, it\u2019s been a crazy ride. So now we\u2019ve just got to finish the job. I think we\u2019re all excited about that opportunity.\u201d * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

Consider: Of the 57 3-point attempts in Game 3 of the Finals Wednesday night at Quicken Loans Arena, 32 of them \u2013 56 percent \u2013 were hoisted from at least 26 feet out. That\u2019s more than two feet beyond what\u2019s required at any point around the arc. Eleven of those came from 30 feet or farther, with Kevin Durant (four) and Stephen Curry (one) combining to make five, for 45.4 percent. \u201cA lot of guys can shoot two, three, four, five, six, seven, 10 feet behind the 3-point line,\u201d said Korver, one of the most accomplished marksmen in NBA history. \u201cA lot of people can do it. It\u2019s just when is it going to be considered a good shot? When are coaches going to encourage you to shoot that shot? \u201cIt\u2019s just going to keep going. The NBA, we\u2019re going to keep trying to make this more exciting. In 10 years, there\u2019s going to be a 4-point line. For sure, right?\u201d Could be, if long distance scoring is determined to be a driver of ratings and revenue. For now, though, Korver is interested in navigating 3-pointers and 2-pointers in the ways in which he, and we, have been accustomed. A 43.1 percent shooter from distance in his NBA career, Korver has hit 2,213 3-pointers in the regular season over 15 seasons ( fourth all-time ) and another 237 in the playoffs . But he has made only one of his six 3-point attempts in the 2018 Finals so far and is shooting 1-of-10 overall. Very un-Korver-like. In fact, the 37-year-old Cavaliers wing admitted that the 32-footer he launched early in the second quarter of Game 3 was his attempt to shoot one beyond the reach of Golden State\u2019s clingy defense. The Warriors began this championship series determined not to let Korver \u2013 a proven threat for big plays and momentum swings \u2013 do major damage, and so far they have excelled. \u201cIt\u2019s been a high priority, taking Korver out of the series,\u201d said Draymond Green, the versatile head of Golden State\u2019s defensive snake. \u201cWe know, when he gets going, it\u2019s really big for them. They feed off his threes, Kyle feeds off his threes. Coming in we knew, to take him out would be very important. Especially because they need them 12 to 15 points he can possibly bring.\u201d Korver\u2019s two 3-point attempts Wednesday were uncontested, in this case bullets dodged by the defense. \u201cHe missed \u2018em both, thank God,\u201d Green said. \u201cBut I think that\u2019s also a direct impact of the force that he\u2019s felt throughout this entire series. \u201cAll of a sudden, you\u2019re not in rhythm and those shots you\u2019re normally gonna make, they don\u2019t feel as good.\u201d Korver doesn\u2019t feel very good, period, based on his struggles over the past week. Here\u2019s a breakdown, series by series, of his 2018 postseason: KORVER\u2019S 2018 PLAYOFFS Round | Opponent | PPG | Minutes | 3-FGs First round  | Indiana | 8.3 | 23.0 | 16-of-40 East semifinals | Toronto | 14.5 | 31.5 mpg | 14-of-25 East finals  | Boston | 8.6 | 21.8 | 14-of-33 The Finals | Golden State | 1.3 | 14.7 | 1-of-6 \u201cThey\u2019ve done a good job of switching on the wide pindowns on Kyle and denying him the ball,\u201d Cleveland teammate Tristan Thompson said, \u201cbecause they know if Kyle gets going we\u2019re a totally different team and it opens up the court for us. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to find ways to get him open. Whether it\u2019s setting multiple picks or just getting him moving, we\u2019ve got to find ways to make his job easier. If they are switching, we\u2019ve got to score on the block to make them second-guess. Do they really want to switch out on Kyle or take their chances with the threes?\u201d The urgency in any Finals game means a shooter such as Korver doesn\u2019t have the luxury to stay on the court through four or five misses, confident he\u2019ll eventually warm up. Coach Tyronn Lue is like any of his peers, quick to shuffle his deck for answers as time slips off the clock. \u201cYou know you\u2019ve got to play at a high level as a group,\u201d Korver said after the Cavaliers\u2019 workout Thursday. \u201cYou can\u2019t make it about you. You have to buy into what the team is doing and get lost in that process. When you make it about yourself, that\u2019s when you can start to press a little bit.\u201d Korver learned long ago that attentive defenders are manageable, as long as his team is successful. \u201cIf the team is scoring and I\u2019m on the court, that\u2019s as good as me scoring,\u201d he said. \u201cA big part of my role here has been, \u2018I\u2019m in the spot where they don\u2019t want to help from, so our guys can do what they want to do.\u2019\u201d Being a decoy is one thing. Being shut down is quite another, if the team needs your production. A year ago, Korver averaged a mere 4.4 points in The Finals, making only three of 12 3-pointers as the Warriors grabbed 3-0 control. After the Cavaliers got bounced, the summer was rough. \u201cOff seasons hurt when you lose the last game,\u201d he told NBA.com last month. Korver and his teammates are staring into that abyss again, one game shy of toppling. The trick now is to play Game 4 as if they aren\u2019t, to play more like they did in the first three rounds. Some of the problems are due to Golden State\u2019s superior defensive schemes and execution. Some, though, are on the Cavs, Korver included. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been running around quite as much,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not setting as many screens. I\u2019m not complaining about this at all. [But] I\u2019m not darting around quite as much as I\u2019d been in previous series. It\u2019s because they\u2019re switching [assignments]. It\u2019s about us winning, so we\u2019re trying to attack certain things.\u201d Cleveland, in other words, hasn\u2019t made Korver the priority that Golden State has. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Gentry agreed on Thursday to an extension covering two additional years, running through the 2020-21 season. \u201cHe did a tremendous job last season,\u201d Pelicans general manager Dell Demps said. \u201cWhen we faced adversity, Alvin and his staff continually discovered ways to place the team in situations where we could be successful.\u201d Gentry has gone 117-138 in three seasons, including this season\u2019s playoffs, when the Pelicans swept Portland before losing a second-round series 4-1 to defending champion Golden State. New Orleans missed the playoffs in Gentry\u2019s first two seasons, during which the team dealt with a rash of injuries to key players. During this past season, Gentry had to help the Pelicans adapt to the loss of Cousins, who played a central role in a system that revolved around him and fellow All-Star big man Anthony Davis. Cousins tore his left Achilles in the 48th game of the season. Without him, New Orleans still managed to go 21-13 and finish sixth in the highly competitive Western Conference. The Pelicans\u2019 late-season success stemmed in part from Gentry\u2019s integration of Nikola Mirotic into the starting rotation after a Feb. 1 trade that brought the fourth-year forward to New Orleans from Chicago. The vote of confidence in Gentry comes as the Pelicans ponder their approach to retaining two key free agents: Cousins and veteran point guard Rajon Rondo. Both players thrived last season under Gentry, and Rondo during the playoffs spoke highly of the way Gentry respects his players by giving them the latitude to play to their strengths and be who they are. Cousins was averaging 25.2 points and 12.9 rebounds before his injury. Rondo enjoyed his best production with New Orleans during the playoffs, when he averaged 10.3 points, 12.2 assists and 7.6 rebounds. Gentry sounded confident that the Pelicans were prepared to move aggressively to build on what they accomplished this season, even if the price is high. Ownership and management \u201chave provided us with the necessary resources to compete at the highest level,\u201d Gentry said Thursday, specifically mentioning Gayle Benson, who is now the sole owner of the Pelicans and NFL\u2019s Saints following the death of her husband, Tom, in March. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be happier to work for such an exceptional owner.

If James ever were to do that, not only would his team get pummeled on the scoreboard, he would be raked over by critics \u2026 maybe forever. That\u2019s precisely the stats line turned in by Curry, along with his 0 plus\/minus. He\u2019s a multi-MVP winner who gets away with it because, of course, he has Durant around to do the heavy lifting when all else fails. As Wednesday\u2019s postgame interviews ground on, the luxury Curry enjoys \u2014 and the limitations James faces with Cleveland \u2014 took on a more existential feel. Curry \u2014 and, for that matter, Durant and Draymond Green \u2014 revels in all the uber-qualified help he has on nights such as Game 3. James, meanwhile, goes through his NBA life without a LeBron in it. Not another LeBron. Any LeBron. Since James is doing what he does in real time and responding moment by pressure-packed moment, he doesn\u2019t get the opportunity to gauge this clash between the league\u2019s best team vs. the world\u2019s best player. In his world, he is an NBA superstar with a bunch of teammates who \u2014 not to spoof them as \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d did \u2014 are simply more ordinary than the guys Curry or Durant have at their disposal. Any one of the Warriors\u2019 four All-Stars always is playing alongside three All-Stars, right? James is playing alongside one, sometimes, in Kevin Love. You see the easy camaraderie and the lightness of being a Warrior, secure in the knowledge every night that two or three others can carry the load. You see James, his bearded jaw set, fully aware that no one else among the Cavaliers can carry his load. Then you hear James talk about both Golden State you understand if he does leave Cleveland again, what it is that might have him looking for an exit. \u201cI can take you back kind of to the battles I had with the Spurs when I was in Miami,\u201d James said after Game 3. He had been asked about the stress of facing a team whose many threats demand constant concentration across 48 minutes, and how exhausting that must be. \u201cYou just knew that they wouldn\u2019t beat themselves,\u201d James said of those Spurs and these Warriors. \u201cYou just knew that like every possession we were playing San Antonio when I was in Miami, you just knew if you made a mistake, Manu [Ginobili], Tim [Duncan], Tony [Parker], Pop [coach Gregg Popovich] will make you pay. At times they did make us pay, and then you sprinkle in what Gary Neal did to us one game, what Danny Green did to us one game. Then Kawhi [Leonard], you just couldn\u2019t \u2014 you could never relax. \u201cWhen you have great basketball players but also that can also think the game and be very cerebral about the game, that\u2019s what adds the level of stress \u2026 Now Draymond and Klay [Thompson], Steph and KD, and then you sprinkle in [Andre] Iguodala and [Shaun] Livingston and all those guys as well, it adds a level of stress. Because you know that you can never relax. You know if you relax, they make you pay, and making you pay could cost you a game.\u201d Or a Finals. Or another building block toward a legacy. James sounded very much like a fellow who wished he had a Curry or a Durant on his squad, or better yet, a LeBron. He sounded, after Game 3 made the outcome of this series inevitable, like someone who would dedicate the freedom and leverage he has this summer to finding one or several. After falling out of the Cavs\u2019 playoff rotation as the playoffs wore on, Rodney Hood bounced back in Game 3. He logged 25 minutes off the bench, scoring 15 points that were as appreciated by James, by their coaches and by the fans as they were timely. Hood was a team-worst minus-12 in Game 3, which means while he was shooting 7-of-11 and creating offense out of nothing, the Warriors were shooting something-of-something to render his 15 points almost moot. That\u2019s these Cavaliers in a nutshell: They must try to outscore opponents because their defense is so porous. Meanwhile, the grab at Hood as a matchup and rotation tweak looks as late as it does desperate. Some of that is on the circumstances \u2013 seven-game series against Indiana and Boston didn\u2019t allow for much experimentation or on-the-job learning for Hood. Some of it\u2019s on Hood, who buried himself on coach Tyronn Lue\u2019s bench by balking at garbage-time minutes. Some of this, too, is fluke \u2014 it\u2019s possible that Game 3 was an adrenaline performance by Hood or a function of the Warriors\u2019 inattention to him. But a sizable chunk of responsibility for getting too little, too late from the 6-foot-8 Meridian, Miss., product is on the Cavs. They essentially bought a new jack and spare tire for the start of a long trip in February, yet never bothered to learn how to use them. Until they were broken down on the side of the road, in darkness, in trouble. Before Durant climbed aboard the Warriors\u2019 bandwagon, back when Curry was a new MVP and unproven as a Finals performer, there was Andre Iguodala. Iguodala is the veteran wing who, time after time in these four Finals runs, has been the primary James \u201cslower-downer\u201d (we won\u2019t say \u201cstopper\u201d). In the 2015 Finals, Iguodala was named Finals MVP after his impressive defense on James in the series. The 34-year-old didn\u2019t enter the fray this time until Wednesday, and while the outcome wasn\u2019t different from the first two games, the way in which the Warriors got there \u2014 with Iguodala vital to the effort \u2014 was. \u201cAndre was really good,\u201d Golden State coach Steve Kerr said. \u201cHe gave us much-needed minutes. I didn\u2019t expect to play him 22 minutes. One thing with Andre is that he\u2019s not like most players in terms of needing rhythm and needing minutes to get his conditioning back. He just never gets tired, even when he\u2019s been out two and a half weeks and hasn\u2019t really been running much at all.\u201d Iguodala played 22 mintues, took four shots, scored eight points \u2026 and was a plus-14. That put his contribution up there with Durant\u2019s or Curry\u2019s (but done in about half the time). Said Kerr: \u201cTypical Andre line. \u2026 He gives us another guy to guard LeBron, and he gives us another guy to settle us down and keep us on the right path.\u201d A tale from before this series began about Iguodala bears repeating. James \u2014 who never has met a talented opponent he hasn\u2019t coveted as a teammate \u2014 apparently was on the Iguodala train early. As in 2004 early, when James was just 19 and Iguodala (then 20) was about to turn pro. \u201cWhen he got drafted, we were one pick away from drafting him before Philly took him [with the ninth pick]. Then we selected Luke Jackson from Oregon. I had loved [Iguodala] at Arizona and was hoping that he slid to us with that pick.\u201d Jackson played 73 games for four teams in four seasons. Iguodala has been a two-way force and the NBA\u2019s version of a starting pitcher converted into a closer across 14 seasons and 1,163 regular and postseason games. What makes him so good? Let LeBron count the ways: \u201cF irst of all, he has very, very quick hands. That doesn\u2019t get talked about a lot,\u201d James said. \u201cHis ability to react to the ball either in the flight or while you\u2019re dribbling or while you pick the ball up. But at the end of the day, his athleticism allows him to play some of the premier perimeter players in our league. \u201cHe\u2019s been like that since he was at Arizona. He\u2019s just added to his game every single season he\u2019s been in the NBA.\u201d Assassins are known for their stealth, their marksmanship and the ice water that runs through their veins. Yet after Durant\u2019s classic performance in Game 3 \u2014 43 points on 15-of-23 shots, including 6-of-9 from 3-point range \u2014 we\u2019re supposed to believe that he\u2019s first and foremost a blue-collar grunt cleaning the glass for the Warriors. His conscientious job of rebounding \u2014 13 in Game 3, to go with the 18 before that in The Finals \u2014 demonstrated Durant\u2019s value at both ends. It also provided an early sign he would have a big game offensively. \u201cThat\u2019s always a good indicator when he\u2019s active defensively and on the glass,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cHis overall game was, I mean, ridiculous.\u201d Durant had a moment of some embarrassment in Game 1 that got overlooked because of all that happened immediately after it \u2014 he was the Warriors player beaten to the ball by J.R. Smith when George Hill missed his second free throw with 4.7 seconds left. If not for Smith\u2019s Game 1 error after that , this whole series might be completely different. Durant denied that he was motivated to make up for that misplay. But he corralled nine rebounds in Game 2 and 13 in Game 3. \u201cI didn\u2019t beat myself up about that one [in Game 1]. But \u2026 a lot of teams jus try to beat us up on the glass and get more possessions than us,\u201d Durant said. \u201cAfter Game 1, I had nine rebounds but they were just like a soft nine rebounds, just ball falling in my hand or I\u2019m in the right spot or uncontested rebounds. \u201cSo I knew coming in that should be my focus because these guys are so great at getting extra possessions.\u201d When Hollywood dives back into a cash trough for a highly derivative, by-the-number sequel, it generally waits two or three years between projects. This Warriors-Cavaliers series of Finals clashes, by contrast, is coming hard with the similarities between 2017 and 2018 a mere 12 months apart. A 2-0 Golden State lead after a pair of games in Oakland? Check. A pivotal Game 3 on Cleveland\u2019s home court that could have swung momentum but didn\u2019t? Check. Kevin Durant launching and hitting a dagger 3-pointer from the left wing in the final minute? Check. So does the pattern of last year\u2019s Finals hold, with the proud Cavaliers forcing everyone back to the Bay Area for a decisive Game 5? Kevin Love thinks maybe yes. \u201cWe came out and I think \u2013 who was telling me \u2013 that we hit 24 threes last year in Game 4,\u201d Love said, \u201cand didn\u2019t accept defeat. So that\u2019s something this team needs to do and continue to be resilient and come out Friday, shoot our shot, play our game and give ourselves a chance, and move on to the next one.\u201d Unless the Warriors decide to write a different ending this time, asserting and locking in their superiority by completing the sweep. That will be the primary plot line for Game 4, with the subplot of James potentially playing his final home game \u2013 or game, period \u2013 as a member of the Cavs. Considering NBA teams that have grabbed 3-0 leads in best-of-seven playoff series have gone 131-0 through the years, the outcome of the 2018 Finals probably isn\u2019t in doubt but the manner in which both teams get there over the final 48 minutes (or 96 or 144) surely is. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

And when his wife used those details to criticize his own players or rival colleagues, Colangelo and the Philadelphia 76ers knew he could no longer remain their top basketball executive. Colangelo resigned Thursday as president of basketball operations for the 76ers in the wake of what an investigation found was \u201dcareless and in some instances reckless\u201d sharing of sensitive team information. The independent review by a law firm did not determine that Colangelo operated or was even aware of Twitter accounts that anonymously trashed some of his own players and fellow executives, and defended him against criticism from fans and the sports media. Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP said evidence supported the conclusion that Colangelo\u2019s wife, Barbara Bottini, operated the four accounts it investigated, and she admitted to doing so \u2013 though also said she deleted contents of her iPhone with a factory reset of the device prior to surrendering it for forensic review, limiting the investigation. \u201dOur investigation revealed substantial evidence that Mr. Colangelo was the source of sensitive, non-public, club-related information contained in certain posts to the Twitter accounts,\u201d the report said. \u201dWe believe that Mr. Colangelo was careless and in some instances reckless in failing to properly safeguard sensitive, non-public, club-related information in communications with individuals outside the 76ers organization.\u201d As for Colangelo, there was no evidence he knew of the accounts before a May 22 inquiry from the sports website The Ringer for a story it reported linking him to five Twitter accounts that took aim at Philadelphia players Joel Embiid and Markelle Fultz, former Sixers general manager Sam Hinkie, Toronto Raptors executive Masai Ujiri and former Sixers players Jahlil Okafor and Nerlens Noel. Colangelo released a statement disputing that his conduct was reckless. \u201dAt no point did I ever purposefully or directly share any sensitive, non-public, club-related information with her,\u201d he said. \u201dHer actions were a seriously misguided effort to publicly defend and support me, and while I recognize how inappropriate these actions were, she acted independently and without my knowledge or consent. Further, the content she shared was filled with inaccuracies and conjecture which in no way represent my own views or opinions.\u201d Evidence found that Bottini established and operated four of the accounts \u2013 Eric jr, Still Balling, Enoughunkownsources, and HonestAbe \u2013 but it seemed some of the information being posted, such as details of trade discussions or medical reports, was coming from Colangelo himself. As such, the team said it had \u201dbecome clear Bryan\u2019s relationship with our team and his ability to lead the 76ers moving forward has been compromised\u201d and that it had accepted his resignation. \u201dWe find the situation to be disappointing for our entire organization,\u201d 76ers managing partner Josh Harris said. \u201dWe are determined to continue the tremendous progress we have made over the last two seasons in our quest to win an NBA championship.\u201d It\u2019s a stunning fall for Colangelo, a former two-time Executive of the Year who was expected to lead the improving 76ers into an important summer when they are hoping to pursue LeBron James or another All-Star player to add to a young core that includes Embiid and Ben Simmons. Instead that role will be led for now by coach Brett Brown. The 76ers said he would oversee basketball operations on an interim basis and that the search for a new general manager would begin immediately. \u201dYou never want to see someone\u2019s job end through an unfortunate circumstance like this. I certainly understand from the 76ers\u2019 standpoint that that bond has been broken,\u201d NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said. \u201dIt\u2019s not even necessary to assign fault, just the reality of where they all find themselves. I think Bryan recognizes like that as well, that these teams are like families and it can get to a point where it becomes dysfunctional and I think that\u2019s where they found themselves right now.\u201d Colangelo, the son of longtime sports executive Jerry Colangelo, was hired as president of basketball operations in 2016 after Hinkie abruptly resigned. Hinkie was the architect behind what has been called \u201dThe Process\u201d \u2013 the long-term tearing down and rebuilding of the Sixers. Colangelo previously served as Raptors general manager, adding the 2007 Executive of the Year award to the one he won two years earlier in Phoenix. But he lost his job there after Toronto missed the playoffs for the fifth consecutive season, and Ujiri took over basketball operations. \u201dOver the last two years, I have worked hard to help build a foundation for what I hope will soon be many championship seasons for the 76ers,\u201d Colangelo said. \u201dI am grateful to team owners Josh Harris and David Blitzer for the opportunity they gave me to be part of such a great organization. I am saddened to have to leave under these circumstances.\u201d \u2014 AP Basketball Writer Tim Reynolds in Cleveland contributed to this report."},{"id":40083,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/hang-time-podcast-2018-nba-finals-instant-analysis","date":"2018-06-07","title":"Hang Time Podcast: NBA Finals Instant Analysis","content":"Sekou Smith and John Schuhmann break down all of the action from the Warriors\u2019 108-85 title-clinching win over the Cavaliers in Game 4.

No, none of that was the lasting image of Kevin Durant that became a permanent tattoo on Game 3 , maybe even this championship series . It was this: the \u201cdeath stare\u201d. The cold expression on his face after drilling that 3 with 49 seconds left. The searing eyes, wrinkled nose and sinister frown. Maybe others in that situation would\u2019ve let loose and shaken a fist, whooped it up, or at least cracked a smile. Because that was a big shot meant to be celebrated. And Draymond Green was jumping and screaming joyously in his face. But not Durant. That stare was a laser straight to the Cavaliers\u2019 heart. The \u201cdeath stare\u201d now goes right into the NBA postseason reaction vault, sharing space with Mario Elie\u2019s two-fingered \u201ckiss of death\u201d in 1995 , Michael Jordan\u2019s \u201cshrug\u201d in the 1992 Finals and Shaquille O\u2019Neal\u2019s \u201cdouble-point\u201d to the Lakers\u2019 bench in the 2000 West finals. All of those reactions \u2014 more or less \u2014 signaled the end of a series. And although the 2018 NBA Finals still needs another Golden State Warriors win to make it official, the \u201cdeath stare\u201d felt like a silent scream that said: That\u2019s a wrap. Durant says he was just playing it safe with his emotions, which made him the chillest guy on the court. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, every time I make a (big) shot in the NBA I get excited,\u201d he said. \u201cI just internalize a little bit as I get older \u2026 I knew the game wasn\u2019t over. I\u2019ve seen some crazy stuff happen in my years playing basketball, so anything can happen. I just try to wait until the buzzer goes off to even think about something else.\u201d Durant was solid on a night when the rest of the Warriors weren\u2019t. He outscored the other four starters combined. He bailed out Stephen Curry, who missed nine straight 3-pointers just a game after setting The Finals record by making nine of them. Durant kept the Warriors in a game they never controlled until the last few suspenseful minutes. It\u2019s now 3-0 Warriors after winning 110-102 , and if the Cavaliers aren\u2019t battling enough, history says nobody has rallied from 0-3 in the postseason. The sweep is now in play, something that hasn\u2019t happened since 2007 when, coincidently, LeBron James dragged a similarly nondescript group to the Finals \u2014 only to meet a quick doom against Tim Duncan, Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili, all in their prime. If a sweep happens, it could almost certainly send LeBron out of town on a bullet train this summer as a free agent, in search of the help he\u2019ll need if he ever plans to sip champagne in June again. Because, this is what he\u2019s up against. One game, Curry goes nuts and sprays threes . Next game, Curry plunges into a deep 3-for-16 shooting freeze, Klay Thompson scores only 10 points \u2026 and Durant rips off 43. What can one man do, even if he\u2019s LeBron, and especially considering he turns 34 next season? \u201cThis is the beauty of this team and the luxury of having multiple big-time scorers,\u201d said Warriors coach Steve Kerr. \u201cThere are going to be nights like that for all of them. We\u2019ve got a lot of guys who can score and fill it up, and they lift each other up if one of them is having a tough night. It\u2019s pretty nice, a pretty nice luxury.\u201d LeBron said: \u201cThat\u2019s why they retooled this team, went out and got KD \u2026 if one of them has a bad game they have three or four guys who can pick up the load.\u201d Time is running out on James and Co., who again couldn\u2019t find the necessary answers in a tight game. They labored well for 45 minutes, led by 13, enjoyed a rare moment when Curry couldn\u2019t hit baskets \u2014 only to crumble when it counted. The Cavs have only one closer, while the Warriors have at least three of them. If Durant didn\u2019t sign with the Warriors two summers ago, are they winning this game with Curry and Thompson laying bricks? Are they even in The Finals? Durant was amazingly efficient, making 15 of 23 shots. But there was more to his game. The Warriors were repeatedly plastered on the boards all night by the Cavs, yet Durant prevented it from being worse and finished with 13 rebounds. He also had seven assists and therefore had his fingerprints on roughly half of Golden State\u2019s 110 points. He threw a rope to Andre Iguodala for a dunk during the frantic final two minutes. \u201cThat was amazing what he did out there,\u201d said Kerr. \u201cSome of those shots \u2026 I don\u2019t think anybody in the world can hit those but him.\u201d The 3-pointer was taken from almost the exact spot on the floor, in the same building, in the same game (Game 3) as last year. That shot also put the Warriors up 3-0, and it is immortalized inside the Warriors\u2019 training facility in Oakland. The play is depicted in a massive photographic blow-up plastered on a wall in the lobby that greets visitors as they step off the elevator. \u201cThe one he made tonight was about four or five feet behind what he made last year,\u201d said LeBron. \u201cLast year he was up two, tonight they\u2019re up three. But you tip your hat. I mean, that\u2019s what he does. He\u2019s a scorer. He\u2019s an assassin and that was one of those assassin plays right there.\u201d Durant is shooting 68 percent in the last two games, a contrast from the series opener when he seemed out of sorts. He had a few lapses in the Western Conference finals, too. He didn\u2019t let that rattle him and waited for his moment to place his stamp on this series \u2014 and it finally arrived. \u201cWe all feed off one another,\u201d Curry said. \u201cTonight was not my night. It was his night. For the last two years I\u2019ve been playing alongside Kevin Durant and he\u2019s an amazing talent, amazing player. When you have belief in yourself, the moment is never too big for you. Supreme self-confidence.\u201d The Cavs are running out of ideas, counterpunches and adjustments. LeBron scored 33 points but shot 3-for-7 in the fourth quarter while showing signs of wear. He\u2019ll have one day of rest before Game 4 and has a twisted ankle suffered early in Game 3. Kevin Love finished with 20, but only five after halftime . The Cavs received a 15-point boost from Rodney Hood, who saw his first minutes of the series. But they\u2019re still getting next to nothing from Kyle Korver (zero points) and just morsels from elsewhere. The last shred of an advantage for the Cavs was their home postseason dominance (8-1 entering Game 3), which just popped. Plus, Iguodala is back \u2014 giving the Warriors a full roster again \u2014 and there are those four All-Stars standing in LeBron\u2019s way, too. \u201cThe margin for error is very low,\u201d James said. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s almost like playing against the Patriots. You can\u2019t have mistakes. They\u2019re not going to beat themselves. They rise to the occasion. That\u2019s what Golden State has done the last four years.\u201d Well, three out of the last four years, anyway. When Curry can suffer from deep as he did for three-and-a-half quarters and then have the confidence to take and make his first 3-pointer \u2014 a crucial one with three minutes left \u2014 what more can the Warriors ask for? It\u2019s an embarrassment of riches when one player can grab pole position for Finals MVP only to have one of his teammates snatch it away. It\u2019s Curry\u2019s team. No, it\u2019s Durant\u2019s. Back and forth, back and forth. So the current flavor of the series is Durant because it was his turn. He was everything Wednesday that the Warriors knew and hoped he\u2019d be when he joined an already stacked team. He seized Game 3, delivered a career game (all things considered) and put the Cavaliers in an impossible situation. Durant is the reason why the Warriors are on the verge of winning their third title in four years, as good a run as any since Bill Russell\u2019s Celtics. But one of his teammates might be the player who eventually clinches it. And Kevin Durant will display more enjoyment for that moment than he did for his. \u201cHe was so stoned-face that somebody had to yell and show some emotion,\u201d said Curry. \u201cSo me and Draymond took care of that.\u201d The \u201cdeath stare\u201d will not, evidently, catch on. But the habit of winning championships remains very much in play for the Warriors. * * * Veteran NBA writer Shaun Powell has worked for newspapers and other publications for more than 25 years.

In Game 3 of the 2017 Finals, Kevin Durant hit the biggest shot of the series , pulling up from 3-point range to give the Golden State Warriors a 114-113 lead with 45.3 seconds left. In Game 3 of the 2018 Finals , Durant again hit the biggest shot of the series, pulling up from almost the exact same spot to give the Warriors a 106-102 lead with 49.8 seconds left. The defending champs are one win away from their second straight championship after their 110-102 victory at Quicken Loans Arena on Wednesday. Durant led he way with 43 points, 13 rebounds and seven assists, helping the Warriors overcome a 3-for-16 shooting performance from Stephen Curry and LeBron James\u2019 23rd career postseason triple-double . One stat stood out from the rest as the Warriors took a 3-0 series lead, with a chance to close out in Game 4 on Friday. 11-for-15 \u2014 Durant\u2019s shooting from outside the paint in Game 3. The rest of the Warriors (the best shooting team in NBA history) shot 4-for-22 from outside the paint. Durant essentially carried his team, in the style of James, to this win. Curry had the worst shooting game of his postseason career . Klay Thompson had a relatively quiet night. The Warriors got Andre Iguodala back and he made an impact, but was afraid to shoot from the outside. Durant\u2019s jumper, meanwhile, was all kinds of wet. He entered Game 3 as the only player who had shot better than 50 percent on at least 50 mid-range field goal attempts in the playoffs , having attempted 28 more mid-range shots than anybody else . After shooting 5-for-6 from between the paint and the 3-point line on Wednesday, he\u2019s at 54.5 percent from mid-range for the postseason. The rest of the league? 38.1 percent. James had been shooting almost as well from mid-range, but didn\u2019t attempt a single mid-range shot on Wednesday. And he was just 1-for-6 from beyond the arc. He still managed to finish with 33 points, 10 rebounds and 11 assists, his NBA Finals record 10th triple-double. Durant made six of his nine threes, 2-for-3 on catch-and-shoot attempts and 4-for-6 off the dribble. The six threes were his most in 126 career playoff games . He kept his team in the game when the Cavs came out hot early, and he closed the deal with the last-minute dagger. Durant not only led all scorers with 43 points. He was also a game-high plus-15 in his 43-plus minutes, meaning that the Warriors were outscored by seven points in his 4:45 on the bench.

The only way they get the Warriors out of their comfort zone in this series is to make things more physical. Doing so plays to the strengths of some of their role players (and, of course, LeBron himself). 8 \u2014 Sure, it\u2019s a somewhat primitive approach in this day and age of analytics and pace-and-space basketball. But what if LeBron decided to go Shaq on the league and attack the rim at all times? Who could stop him? Literally \u2026 who in the world could stop him without totally compromising their defensive principles? 7 \u2014 Kevin Durant with the cold-blooded step into it 3-pointer in the final seconds of the second quarter kept the Warriors within striking distance, 58-52, heading into the locker room. Durant\u2019s first half was sick (24 points on 7-for-10 shooting, 3-for-4 from distance, eight rebounds and two assists). He outscored the rest of the starting lineup (17 points combined) by himself to keep the Warriors in it. What was that people were saying about him struggling a couple games back? 6 \u2014 From the bizarre department: the NBPA announced their fourth annual Players\u2019 Voice Awards at 10:46 p.m. ET. That means it was during the third quarter of Game 3 of The Finals \u2026 a fantastic game, by the way. James Harden is their MVP and LeBron is the \u201cPeople\u2019s Champ.\u201d Why this couldn\u2019t wait until morning is beyond my comprehension. I\u2019m willing to listen to reasonable explanations. I do love the premise, by the way. And I wholeheartedly endorse P.J. Tucker as the Sneaker Champ Award (best shoe game). 5 \u2014 We see it now, Cavaliers fans. Makes total sense after seeing Rodney Hood on the floor in this series. 4 \u2014 Andre Iguodala might be \u201cpain free\u201d but he sure looks like he\u2019s laboring dragging that knee around the court down the stretch. He\u2019s still making plays and the Warriors clearly need him to finish what they\u2019ve started in this series without him. 3 \u2014 You know you are caught up in it when you look at the monitor and realize Stephen Curry is 1-for-14 from the floor, 0-for-9 from deep and the Warriors have a lead (96-95) with 3:19 to play. 2 \u2014 Kevin Durant = Savage! Just 43 points, 13 rebounds and seven assists for the reigning Finals MVP \u2026 and a flashback to his 2016 Finals dagger after he hit one tonight with 49.5 to play . 1 \u2014 LeBron had a 33-point, 11-assist, 10-rebound triple-double \u2026 and he got help from all over the place tonight \u2026 and it still wasn\u2019t enough. The Warriors rallied and took Game 3, 110-102. Not sure what else the man can do other than tip his cap. That\u2019s 3-0 Warriors.

The 7-foot-1, 250-pound center went through what he said would be his only pre-draft workout and expressed supreme confidence that the Suns will use the No. 1 overall pick to select him. \u201cI know I\u2019m going No. 1,\u201d he told reporters. Not that the Suns have assured him of that, he\u2019s just that confident that the team won\u2019t pass on his combination of size, strength, athleticism and shooting touch. \u201cNobody told me,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s just me. I think I deserve that. I\u2019ve worked hard.\u201d It would be a comfortable fit for Ayton, who was born in the Bahamas and moved to the Phoenix area during high school. He said most of his family now lives here. Ayton played his one year of college basketball a couple of hours down Interstate 10 at the University of Arizona. \u201cEverybody knows us now,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is our second home so we just feel welcome, and it would be a blessing if I become the No. 1 pick and stay here and make this home.\u201d  Ayton said teaming with young Suns star Devin Booker would be \u201cShaq and Kobe 2-point-0.\u201d \u201cWe could really make something happen in Phoenix,\u201d he said. \u201cWe could really have a spark and start a winning legacy.\u201d There hasn\u2019t been much winning in Phoenix lately. The Suns have missed the playoffs eight years in a row and had the NBA\u2019s worst record last season at 21-61, second-worst in franchise history. But there is a young core of talent and most of those players, including Booker and Josh Jackson, watched what Ayton described as \u201ca pretty intense\u201d individual workout. For nearly an hour, Suns coach Igor Kokoskov and his staff put Ayton through a series of game situations, as much as possible given the fact no other players were on the floor. \u201cIt was everything that we expected form Deandre,\u201d general manager Ryan McDonough said. \u201cObviously we\u2019ve watched him closely at Arizona and we\u2019ve scouted him heavily in person in games, at practice and on film. He showed us what we expected to see.\u201d McDonough said \u201cit\u2019s pretty rare\u201d to find such a player. \u201cI think this is my 16th draft in the NBA,\u201d McDonough said, \u201cand you can probably count on one hand the number of guys with his size, athleticism, footwork, balance, touch. It\u2019s a unique package.\u201d He was particularly impressed with Ayton\u2019s outside shooting touch. \u201cWe knew he was big and strong and athletic and moved well at that size, had good length, had great hands,\u201d McDonough said, \u201cbut to see him make shot after shot in a workout in different scenarios.\u201d And he\u2019s just 19 years old. The Suns plan other workouts with candidates for the No. 1 pick later this week. The group won\u2019t include Luka Doncic, who is still playing in Europe. Phoenix is not tipping its hand, but Ayton will be hard to pass up. \u201cThe strength of our team right now are young perimeter players, led by Devin Booker, Josh Jackson and T.J. Warren,\u201d McDonough said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been looking for a center to kind of anchor our team offensively and defensively. We think Deandre has that kind of potential. \u2026 He\u2019s certainly a unique player and a unique talent that I think would fit in great with the rest of our roster.\u201d Ayton averaged 20.1 points and 11.6 rebounds in his one season at Arizona. He brushed aside questions about his defense. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a weakness,\u201d he said. \u201cI haven\u2019t had the opportunity to really guard any bigs in college. I was always on the perimeter with the guards.\u201d Still, he pointed out, he averaged 2.3 blocked shots per game. On offense, Ayton said, \u201cI can score inside and out.\u201d \u201cThere will be a lot of mismatches because if I guard them they have to guard me at the end of the day,\u201d he said. \u201cI can score, I can pick and pop, I can pick and roll, I can put the ball on the ground, rebound, push the ball. It\u2019s an open floor now. Nobody is really double-teaming or triple-teaming.\u201d He said there is no current player on which he patterns his game. But he mentioned two pretty good ones from the past. \u201cKevin Garnett, his intensity on both ends of the floor, how he changes the game, rebounding. From offense to defense, him starting the pick and roll, stuff like that,\u201d Ayton said, \u201chow he\u2019s so vocal with his teammates. And Hakeem Olajuwon, with his footwork down low, I try to really pick up a lot of stuff with those guys.\u201d Ayton called himself the most competitive player in the draft. He said there\u2019s none of the laid-back attitude that\u2019s a trademark of his homeland. \u201cI left at age 12, so I got a little Americanized with the competitive level,\u201d he said. Ayton planned to get together with Booker and other Suns players to watch Game 3 of the NBA Finals on Wednesday night."},{"id":40126,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/golden-state-warriors-steve-kerr-good-chance-andre-iguodala-plays-game-3","date":"2018-06-06","title":"Golden State Warriors forward Andre Iguodala will play in Game 3 of The Finals","content":" * Tonight on ABC:  Warriors vs. Cavs (9 ET) Roughly an hour before Game 3 of The Finals, the word was out: Andre Iguodala is back in the mix for the Golden State Warriors.

Based on the latest reports, Colangelo\u2019s future with the team could be decided as soon as today. ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski reports the Sixers\u2019 ownership group, including team CEO Scott O\u2019Neill, met to discuss the findings of their recent probe into Colangelo\u2019s social media activity necessitates Colangelo being fired : TNT analyst David Aldridge reported earlier this week that a mid-week deadline seemed to be in the cards for the Sixers , who have been investigating the Twitter saga since news of it broke last week. The Sixers are gearing up for what could be a busy offseason for them as they have significant salary cap space that they could use to woo marquee free agents this summer. * Aldridge:  Twitter saga puts Colangelo\u2019s job in uncertain state Wojnarowski reports that league sources have told ESPN that regardless of what happens to Colangelo, the Sixers plan to put coach Brett Brown front and center in the July free-agent presentations. Others in the Sixers\u2019 front office could have bigger roles in free agency, too, write Wojnarowski: Even if Colangelo is cleared and remains in his post, T.J. Furman of Philly.com reports the Twitter saga may still affect Philadelphia\u2019s summer and beyond : Per Aldridge, many prominent agents contacted by NBA.com in the past few days asked to have all the facts come in before determining if they\u2019d be comfortable working with Colangelo in the future. \u201cI like Bryan very much and am hoping there is a logical explanation,\u201d a prominent player agent texted late last week. \u201cIf true, would be tough to confide in him, however.\u201d Another prominent agent said that while he would have no problem going forward working with Colangelo, players might be a different story. \u201cHe\u2019s always been fair and honest with me,\u201d the agent said. \u201cI hope it\u2019s not true. I think players will have a hard time trusting him though if it is. \u2026 I would tell (the agent\u2019s clients) about my personal dealings with him but this issue would certainly be one of the many factors to weigh. At the end of the day, though, the players usually (but not always) choose their destinations based on the best money offer and role.\u201d Another prominent agent, though, pointed out that Colangelo would hardly be the only front-office person engaged in, shall we say, curious behavior. \u201cThere are so few competent GMs and so few execs who don\u2019t lie,\u201d the agent said. \u201cIf those were (the) criteria we\u2019d have six GMs in the league.\u201d NBA commissioner Adam Silver responded the Colangelo\/Sixers issue at his Finals news conference Thursday, saying the investigation will be get done, but not by cutting corners. \u201cWell, for the league there is always that balance of speed and doing things in a deliberate and appropriate way,\u201d Silver said. \u201cSo I have talked to management at the 76ers, and the notion here was let\u2019s find out what\u2019s going on. \u201cSo, of course, from the league standpoint, here we are, Game 1 of The Finals, it\u2019s not necessarily something we want to be talking about, but it\u2019s the reality of this league,\u201d Silver added. \u201cSo I have no information beyond that other than that investigation is underway.\u201d The Sixers started their investigation into tweets linked in a report to Colangelo that criticized Sixers players Joel Embiid and Markelle Fultz, among other NBA figures. The burner accounts also took aim at former Sixers general manager Sam Hinkie, Toronto Raptors executive Masai Ujiri and former Sixers players Jahlil Okafor and Nerlens Noel, according to a report by The Ringer website . \u201cThe allegations are serious and we have commenced an independent investigation into the matter,\u201d the Sixers said Wednesday in a statement. \u201cWe will report the results of that investigation as soon as it is concluded.\u201d The website asked the team about five Twitter accounts it suspected Colangelo was operating. He said in a statement that he used one of the accounts to monitor the NBA industry and other current events, but that he was \u201cnot familiar with any of the other accounts\u201d brought to his attention and that he didn\u2019t know who was \u201cbehind them or what their motives may be in using them.\u201d Embiid, the 24-year-old All-Star center, tweeted that he didn\u2019t believe the report . \u201cI don\u2019t believe the story. That would just be insane,\u201d he wrote. Colangelo was hired as president of basketball operations for Philadelphia in April 2016. He served as Toronto\u2019s general manager from 2006-2013. Colangelo, the son of longtime sports executive Jerry Colangelo, stepped in with the Sixers after Hinkie resigned. He lost his GM job in Toronto after the Raptors missed the playoffs for the fifth consecutive season, and Ujiri took over basketball operations.

But they\u2019re just 6-6 (2-2 in the regular season, 4-4 in The Finals) against the Golden State Warriors at Quicken Loans Arena over the last four years. In these Finals , the crowd and the arena will not win Games 3 and 4 for the Cavs. They must play better, on both ends of the floor, than they did in Games 1 and 2. Here are two things to look for in Game 3 on Wednesday ( 9 p.m. ET, ABC ). The Cavs should get a boost by returning home for Game 3, but the Warriors could also get a boost with the return of Andre Iguodala, who has missed the last six games after suffering a bone bruise in his left knee in Game 3 of the Western Conference finals. Iguodala is listed as \u201cquestionable\u201d for Game 3 by the Warriors. The Warriors have been at their best in this postseason, outscoring their opponents by 13.6 points per 100 possessions , with Iguodala on the floor. Though it hasn\u2019t played together in more than two weeks, the Warriors\u2019 lineup of Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Iguodala, Kevin Durant and Draymond Green has the best raw plus-minus in the postseason , having outscored opponents by 57 points in its 110 minutes. The return of Iguodala could mean the return of the Death Lineup (or \u201cHamptons Five\u201d or whatever you want to call it). Even if Iguodala doesn\u2019t return on Wednesday, the Warriors could use their next-best-thing lineup more than they have thus far. The lineup with Shaun Livingston and the Warriors\u2019 four All-Stars didn\u2019t play at all in regulation of Game 1, but was on the floor for all but the last three seconds of overtime, scoring 15 points on Golden State\u2019s first six possessions of the extra period to make Cleveland pay for its late-fourth-quarter mistakes. In the fourth quarter of Game 2, Warriors coach Steve Kerr went back to the Livingston lineup \u2026 for just 32 seconds. The lineup has played just 24 minutes in the entire postseason , all in the six games since Iguodala\u2019s injury. Including that 4:57 of overtime in Game 1, the Warriors have played only nine minutes with Green at center (with no other bigs on the floor) over the first two games. They\u2019re a plus-15 in those minutes, plus-8 in a little less than five minutes with Kevin Love at center for Cleveland and plus-7 in a little more than four minutes with Tristan Thompson at center for Cleveland. One adjustment the Cavs made in Game 2 was setting screens for LeBron James before he crossed the mid-court line. We first saw it on their fifth possession of the game, with Thompson screening Durant in the backcourt\u2026 The goal is to get James going downhill against Thompson\u2019s defender. Green picked up James after that screen above, but the Cavs\u2019 primary target with these screens is JaVale McGee. And it worked on one second quarter possession where McGee couldn\u2019t contain James and tripped him . McGee survived the attack (after James lost control of his dribble) a few minutes later and the results were mixed in Game 2, though the Cavs set less than 10 of these early screens for James on Sunday. Expect to see more in Game 3. Ideally, the Warriors would prefer Durant to avoid the screen and get back in front of James, so McGee isn\u2019t put in a tough spot. McGee gives the Warriors some important verticality on offense, but he might not be able to contain James on the other end of the floor. It was in this series last year when McGee\u2019s defensive issues kept him from playing in Game 5. * * * John Schuhmann is a staff writer for NBA.com.

They\u2019re not just trying to stay in this series. They\u2019re trying to convince LeBron James to stay in Cleveland. Yes, the elephant in the room gets larger and heavier and more uncomfortable with every Golden State Warriors victory. The defending champions\u2019 advantage in The Finals is clear, like a Stephen Curry green light to shoot. Golden State is bringing four All-Stars in their prime while the Cavs are bringing \u2026 exactly what, beyond LeBron James? At this rate, will LeBron ever have the satisfaction of refusing a trip to Donald Trump\u2019s White House? Here in his middle-aged years, LeBron is 33 and perhaps never better, as evident by the last few months. During that stretch, LeBron has had more epic games than many players will enjoy in a lifetime. Still, he\u2019s on an island with the Cavs, who are outmatched in this series in every other way. His 51 points in Game 1 of The Finals was proof of Cleveland\u2019s struggles. \u201cWe look forward to the challenge, (but) it\u2019s a very tall task,\u201d he admitted. \u201cA very tough challenge, going against this team. But we have an opportunity to seize the opportunity so I look forward to that.\u201d His ties to Northern Ohio are understandable: Born and raised and worshipped in Akron; applauded, reviled and then forgiven in Cleveland. On the court and off, LeBron is a civic treasure, the rebuttal whenever the locals endure cruel jokes and put-downs about Cleveland from anyone outside the 216. Therefore, if he\u2019s too attached to leave a second time, then all is good. But if he wants to win more championships and make his legacy bullet-proof before he\u2019s done, those chances will be greater in other places. And if his mind isn\u2019t made up by now, this series could nudge him in a direction that Cavs fans would rather not see. If he loses, he\u2019ll have twice as many championships lost than championships won. In the big picture, no big deal as the number of players with nine trips to The Finals can fit comfortably in a Fiat. But why would anyone on his level want to do anything else in their mid-30s but win titles? Only LeBron knows the priorities that will define his decision when free agency hits July 1 (James has a player option this summer, in case you forgot). Yet he\u2019s not revealing anything about his future before the season is officially over. For clues, you can follow the trail: * He\u2019s riding with role players in Cleveland , for now and possibly the near future. The next most accomplished player on the Cavs, Kevin Love, has possibly peaked. Solid when healthy, Love was an All-Star this season, but his stats are starting to flatline. After that, there\u2019s Tristan Thompson, J.R. Smith, Kyle Korver and others. The Cavs will get an infusion of youth with the No. 9 pick in the June draft , yet rookies often need a few years to mature. LeBron\u2019s not getting younger, so how much time can he wait on that? In addition, the Cavs are deep in the luxury tax, partly because LeBron campaigned for Thompson and Smith, who are represented by his agency, to receive rich contract extensions. That makes it tricky \u2014 though not impossible \u2014 to add proven help this summer. * The number of contenders is starting to swell. Yes, the competition only gets tougher from here. There are developing threats in Philadelphia and Boston in the East and perhaps Utah and New Orleans in the West. Meanwhile, the Warriors and Houston Rockets (assuming they remain intact for next season) are in win-now mode. * The Michael Jordan factor is real. Jordan went 6-0 in championships. If LeBron cares about barbershop talk and greatest-ever debates, then the only way he can diffuse his Finals record is by improving it before he retires. Assuming he only plays four more years, at which point he\u2019ll be 37, time is precious. For James, staying in Cleveland makes sense for family and community reasons. Leaving makes the most sense for championship and legacy reasons. Almost any team he signs with will instantly move toward the front of the title-contender line. He can stay in the East, where the competition is lighter and the Sixers have Ben Simmons, Joel Embiid and cap room. He could go West and work for Lakers boss Magic Johnson and possibly play alongside Paul George (who can also opt out of his deal). Of course, the Rockets could move mountains to make it work with James Harden and Chris Paul. If it\u2019s not about money and all about championships, then the Warriors might make room. If that happens the basketball world will stop spinning. Essentially, it must get exhausting for LeBron to do all the heavy lifting \u2026 and stare across the floor at Curry, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson. Keep in mind, as remarkable as LeBron is at 33, Father Time will wax him, too. Those are examinations that\u2019ll take place in a few weeks. In the meantime, he and the Cavs will lean on the comforts of home, where they\u2019re 8-1 in the postseason and have used their arena to rescue them against the Pacers ( Game 7 ) and Celtics ( Game 6 ) \u2014 neither of whom are the Warriors. \u201cThis is a completely different team than what we\u2019ve faced in this situation,\u201d cautioned Smith, \u201cso we\u2019ve got to bring it.\u201d Everything would change for the better for Cleveland if LeBron\u2019s help can cause damage. They have been inconsistent so far and, save for a few brief bursts from Love, scoring has been a problem. LeBron is averaging 40 points per game in The Finals \u2014 and No. 2 is Love at 21.5 ppg on 42.9 percent shooting. Smith is at 26.3 percent, while the Warriors have locked up Korver, who is shooting a frigid 16.5 percent and has made just one 3-pointer in The Finals. \u201cLeBron\u2019s doing a great job of putting us on his back and leading us,\u201d said George Hill. \u201cSo we\u2019ve got to feed off that. We\u2019ve got to knock down shots for him and make easy opportunities so we can give him a rest. I think he\u2019s playing a lot of minutes and got the ball in his hands a lot. We need to take the ball a little bit so he can sit down and catch a break.\u201d The Cavs were down 2-0 to the Celtics, came home, found a rhythm and shook up the rest of the East finals. The Warriors Game 3s in the 2015 and 2016 Finals before winning last year only because Durant\u2019s late 3-pointer was the biggest shot of his life . The Cavs promise to take a more physical approach in this Game 3. Plus, LeBron has had three days\u2019 rest. That\u2019s all good and in his favor. That doesn\u2019t drastically change LeBron\u2019s odds of making a stunning rally against a dominant Warriors team, or reloading in the offseason in Cleveland and getting the upgrades he so obviously needs. There\u2019s probably not much else LeBron can do here in The Finals that he hasn\u2019t done already. But this summer, he can do plenty. If the Cavs get swept, their franchise foundation would have every reason to leave before it closes. And so, the goal for the Cavs is to make it hard for the Warriors in this series and easy for LeBron in July.

They have not changed their minds this year. No matter whose team wins the NBA championship, neither superstar will be at the White House anytime soon. On the day when the Philadelphia Eagles were supposed to be there to commemorate winning the Super Bowl \u2013 a visit that was canceled by President Donald Trump and had the White House accusing players who weren\u2019t planning on attending of abandoning their fans \u2013 Curry and James were among those speaking out at the NBA Finals in support of the Eagles. \u201cI\u2019m not surprised. It\u2019s typical of him,\u201d James, the Cleveland star, said Tuesday of Trump\u2019s decision to cancel. \u201cI know no matter who wins this series, no one wants the invite anyway. So it won\u2019t be Golden State or Cleveland going.\u201d On the eve of Game 3 of the Warriors-Cavaliers series, politics dominated the conversation. Curry raised Trump\u2019s ire last year when he said he wouldn\u2019t go to the White House, prompting the President to disinvite him and the champion Golden State Warriors. Curry said Tuesday that he spoke with a current Eagles player about the team\u2019s decision-making process and how it went deeper than disagreeing with Trump policies and the ongoing issue of some NFL players choosing not to stand for the pregame playing of \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s an important conversation, but you can\u2019t control what other people try to do, or try to control the narrative or things like that,\u201d Curry said. Curry said the team has been on the same page after his comments last year and Trump\u2019s subsequent revoking of the Warriors\u2019 invitation. \u201cAnd every team that\u2019s won a championship since then has gone through that.\u201d There has been clear tension between many star athletes and the current administration throughout the Trump presidency. Trump has often blasted the NFL players who have kneeled for the national anthem, a protest that started in 2016 when San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick did so to protest racism and more specifically the killing of black men by police. Trump said the Eagles\u2019 event was called off because some of their players \u201cdisagree with their President because he insists that they proudly stand for the National Anthem, hand on heart, in honor of the great men and women of our military and the people of our country.\u201d No Eagles players kneeled during the anthem last season. \u201cInstead the decision was made to lie, and paint the picture that these players are anti-America, anti-flag and anti-military,\u201d the Eagles\u2019 Malcolm Jenkins wrote in a statement posted to social media Tuesday . The WNBA champion Minnesota Lynx haven\u2019t been invited to celebrate their most recent title, something James called \u201claughable.\u201d Villanova, the reigning NCAA men\u2019s champion, has not revealed if an invitation was sent. Many members of the U.S. Olympic Team that competed earlier this year in South Korea did not attend a White House reception. Hockey\u2019s Pittsburgh Penguins and baseball\u2019s Houston Astros have accepted invitations to the White House for the traditional meeting with the President in recent months, as have several college teams. When the New England Patriots went last year, half the team chose not to attend. The Warriors, in lieu of going to the White House, spent that day taking a group of children to the National Museum of African American History and Culture a few miles away. \u201cI think the President has made it pretty clear he\u2019s going to try to divide us, all of us in this country, for political gain,\u201d said Golden State coach Steve Kerr, who has often criticized Trump and his policies. \u201cSo it\u2019s just the way it is. I think we all look forward to the day when we can go back to just having a celebration of athletic achievement and celebrate Americans for their achievement, their good deeds.\u201d Kerr also lauded the Eagles for being what he called \u201cfantastic citizens in their own community.\u201d \u201cIt will be nice when we can just get back to normal in three years,\u201d Kerr said. The overwhelming issue surrounding the Eagles\u2019 planned visit was that most of the team was not going to attend, and that was a major factor in Trump deciding to pull the invitation. \u201cWhat else do you expect Trump to do?\u201d Golden State\u2019s Kevin Durant said. \u201cWhen somebody says they don\u2019t want to come to the White House, he disinvites them. So the photo op don\u2019t look bad. We get it at this point. But it\u2019s good that guys are sticking to what they believe in and what they want to do. Like guys said before me, I\u2019m sure whoever wins this series won\u2019t be going.\u201d"},{"id":40121,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-toronto-raptors-interview-sarunas-jasikevicius-coaching-job","date":"2018-06-05","title":"Report: Toronto Raptors interview Sarunas Jasikevicius for coaching vacancy","content":" Toronto is still without a coach after the Raptors parted ways with Dwane Casey shortly after the team was swept in the 2018 Eastern Conference semifinals .

In the 2015-16 season, they did it with two of the 12 best 3-point shooters in NBA history . Then they added the *third best mid-range shooter of the last five years. * Best mid-range FG% over the last five seasons (minimum 1,000 attempts): Chris Paul (48.3 percent), J.J. Redick (48.3 percent), Kevin Durant (47.6 percent). Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson have shot a combined 22-for-46 (48 percent) from 3-point range through the first two games of The Finals . Kevin Durant, meanwhile, is still shooting better than 50 percent from mid-range in the postseason , having attempted 28 more mid-range shots than any other player . The Warriors can kill you with jumpers. But they\u2019re aren\u2019t completely dependent on them. And when they\u2019re at their best, they\u2019re leveraging their perimeter shooting to get even better shots. Jumpers, when taken by the Warriors are good. Layups and dunks are better. And the Warriors don\u2019t merely just shoot well from the outside. In both the regular season (68.3 percent) and the playoffs (71.2 percent), the Warriors have ranked second in field goal percentage in the restricted area. Through the first two games of The Finals, Golden State has shot 41-for-50 (82 percent) in the restricted area . The Warriors have guys who can finish. The 12 Warriors who took the most shots in the restricted area in the regular season all shot better than the league average (63.1 percent) there. But they also finish well because they get lots of clean looks at the basket. In Game 2, the Warriors shot well from pretty much everywhere, registering their highest postseason effective field goal percentage (66.5 percent) since 2013. Curry set a Finals record with nine 3-pointers, but the Warriors\u2019 ability to get layups and dunks (they were 20-for-25 in the restricted area) was critical. And it was about both their offensive execution and the Cleveland Cavaliers\u2019 defensive mistakes. On the first possession of the game, JaVale McGee appeared to be setting a screen for Curry, which the Cavs were going to switch\u2026 But before McGee actually set the screen, he slipped into the paint, with J.R. Smith unable to get between he and the basket. Curry found McGee for an easy dunk. Late in the first quarter, Shaun Livingston was the slip man in transition, acting like he was setting a screen for Curry on the left sideline. James was ready to switch the screen, but George Hill wasn\u2019t, because he never felt the screen. And because James was looking to prevent a transition three from Curry, Livingston easily got on the other side of the defense and Curry knew to throw the pass before his teammate even had separation. There was no weak-side help, in part because a Jordan Bell was setting a screen for Thompson, keeping both of their defenders occupied. In the fourth quarter, it was Livingston again, this time slipping an off-ball screen for Curry, with Jeff Green caught leaning toward the switch and Hill caught on the wrong side of the roll to the rim\u2026 The Warriors didn\u2019t slip screens too often in Game 2. One of McGee\u2019s dunks (plus a Hill foul) came after he set a solid screen in transition early in the third quarter and rolled to the basket with no weak-side help from the Cavs. But slipping was a clear point of emphasis to take advantage of the Cavs\u2019 switches. The Warriors are one of the best offensive teams in NBA history, because of their shooting and because of their collective IQ on plays like the ones above. But much of the damage to the Cavs\u2019 defense was self-inflicted, with Cleveland unable to contain the ball or just out of position away from it. On the Warriors\u2019 second possession of the game, Smith made the necessary adjustment to stay between McGee and the basket after the big man did the same thing he did on the first possession\u2026 But when the ball was swung to Durant on the right wing, LeBron James was unable to contain the dribble, Smith was forced to help, and Durant found McGee under the basket for another dunk. The Warriors are hard to guard, but the Cavs are not necessarily hard to score against. And the Warriors\u2019 third restricted-area bucket was, in part a result, of some lazy and\/or inattentive Cleveland defense. A Curry-Durant exchange on the weak side of the floor got Durant isolated on Smith \u2026 If that was James isolated at the high post, the Warriors\u2019 defender (or the Celtics\u2019 defender in the conference finals) in either Kevin Love\u2019s or Tristan Thompson\u2019s position would be sagging off his man, doing the \u201c2.9 dance,\u201d where he has his feet planted in the paint for 2.9 seconds, quickly shuffles outside the paint to avoid a defensive 3-second violation, and then gets back into the paint to \u201czone up\u201d on James. The other one (Love or Thompson) would be responsible for both McGee and Draymond Green. Since neither can shoot very well, that\u2019s OK. Green set a flare screen for Klay Thompson, keeping Tristan Thompson somewhat occupied, but Love never leaves McGee. Maybe Love doesn\u2019t believe there would be a teammate behind him ready to rotate to McGee, so if he helps, the result would be another drive-and-dish assist for Durant. In any case, Love remained 10 feet from the basket defending a guy who has made 15 shots from outside of 10 feet this season. Durant beat Smith off the dribble and got a layup. Each of the two restricted-area buckets above could have been avoided with better one-on-one defense from the Cavs. Same with the next one. On the Warriors\u2019 fifth possession of the game, Curry gave the ball up early, but quickly got a switch onto Love, thanks to a screen from McGee (who may have initially been trying to set a ball screen). On the catch, Curry gave Love a subtle pump fake, drawing him out past the 3-point line, with absolutely no help in the paint, because again, the Cavs were defending the Warriors\u2019 non-shooters (McGee and Green) tightly on the perimeter. With a live dribble, Curry went right past Love for a layup. James might have been able to help from the weak-side baseline, but didn\u2019t make the effort, maybe thinking that no one would help him if the ball was kicked out to his man (Durant) in the corner. Restricted-area bucket No. 5 was a result of the Cavs (mostly James) complaining about a call. While Cleveland was still out of sorts over the Warriors getting the ball under their own basket, Curry inbounded to Thompson for an easy layup. Restricted-area bucket No. 6? A Green dunk in transition , with the Cavs out of position after James\u2019 pass was deflected with one second left on the shot clock. The Cavs trailed by nine less than four minutes into Game 2 (they would never tie or take the lead) and the deficit was largely avoidable. Later in the first quarter, the Warriors got creative. After Draymond Green set a screen for Durant (prompting a Jeff Green switch onto Draymond Green), Curry set a back-screen for Green\u2026 Smith did not switch and Green was unguarded on his roll to the basket\u2026 Love came to help from the weak side, but had no help behind him, where Jordan Bell caught Green\u2019s lob for a dunk. The Cavs were back within two three possessions later, but another botched switch between Smith and Jeff Green resulted in another Curry layup . The Cavs\u2019 defense wasn\u2019t thoroughly dreadful in Game 2. They had enough solid possessions to stick around in the second and third quarters, and the Warriors made a handful of shots that no team could defend. Still, the Cavs may have to rethink their \u201cswitch everything\u201d game plan on defense, because \u2026 Even if the Cavs initially stay in front of the Warriors, layups can still be had, because\u2026 It\u2019s a good time for a reminder that the Cavs ranked 29th defensively in the regular season . They\u2019re the first bottom-three defensive team to make The Finals in the 41 years since the league started counting turnovers, but getting here doesn\u2019t erase who they\u2019ve been all season. The margin for error is thin against the Warriors, who could get an additional playmaker \u2014 Andre Iguodala \u2014 back for Game 3 on Wednesday ( 9 p.m. ET, ABC ). To have a chance in this series, the Cavs\u2019 defense needs to figure out how to make fewer errors, both in effort and execution. * * * John Schuhmann is a staff writer for NBA.com.

James can opt out of his contract this summer and test free agency \u2014 a move many consider to be a foregone conclusion. NBA 2K19\u2019s first released images of James on the cover do not feature him in a Cavs uniform.

A new era is afoot for the team as it aims to fill those jobs and three current and former coaches are set to talk again with the team about the vacancy. Former Toronto Raptors coach Dwane Casey, current San Antonio Spurs assistant coach Ime Udoka and current University of Michigan coach John Beilein are set to meet with team ownership soon, reports Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN.com : Wojnarowski also reports that Casey, who was fired after guiding Toronto to a 59-win season in 2017-18 , is owed $6.5 million for the final year of his deal with Toronto. He posted a 320-238 (.573) in seven seasons with the Raptors, including the only three 50-win seasons in team history. Under him, the Raptors won four Atlantic Division titles and advanced to the postseason in a franchise-record five consecutive seasons. Udoka interviewed for coaching openings with the Raptors, Charlotte Hornets and Orlando Magic and has served as a Spurs assistant since 2012 . He is considered by many to be one of the top up-and-coming coaching candidates in the NBA. Beilein is the winningest coach in school history and has three years left on his deal with Michigan. Since being named coach of the Wolverines before the 2007-08 season, Michigan has won 20 or more games eight times, collected two Big Ten titles and reached two NCAA Tournament title games (but lost in both appearances). Rod Beard of The Detroit News reports that while Beilein is enjoying his stay at Michigan, the coach may be seeking new challenges : Bower, the GM under former president and coach Stan Van Gundy, spent four years in the Pistons front office. He helped orchestrate trades for Reggie Jackson and Blake Griffin, while drafting Stanley Johnson (2015) and Luke Kennard (2017). The move was anticipated once the Pistons dismissed head coach\/president of basketball operations Stan Van Gundy last month. Bower was hired by Van Gundy in 2014. The Pistons hired Ed Stefanski in late May as senior adviser to owner Tom Gores . Stefanski is leading the search a new GM and head coach. According to the Detroit Free Press , Memphis Grizzlies executive and former Pistons forward Tayshaun Prince, Turner Sports analyst Brent Barry, Brooklyn Nets assistant general manager Trajan Langdon and Atlanta Hawks front office executive Malik Rose are among some of the candidates for the front office job."},{"id":40127,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/andre-iguodala-golden-state-warriors-knee-pain-free-game-3-nba-finals","date":"2018-06-05","title":"Report: Andre Iguodala (knee) expects to return soon","content":" * Complete NBA Finals coverage The Golden State Warriors have played without forward Andre Iguodala since he injured his left knee during Game 3 of the Western Conference finals.

The body camera and squad car videos, obtained by WISN-TV and posted online Sunday, show the moments after Milwaukee police officers swarmed Brown in January when he didn\u2019t immediately take his hands out of his pockets as ordered. Brown had been standing and talking with a group of officers as he waited for a citation for illegally parking on a disabled spot outside a Walgreens. Brown wasn\u2019t charged with anything and three officers involved in the arrest were disciplined, with suspensions ranging from two to 15 days. Eight others will undergo remedial training in professional communications. Brown has said he plans to sue the department. In one of the videos, Brown is on the ground and handcuffed when an officer puts one of his boots on Brown\u2019s ankle, holding it there and at one point pressing down. Brown doesn\u2019t mention being in any discomfort but he questions the officer about why he\u2019s stepping on him. \u201cC\u2019mon man, you\u2019re stepping on my ankle for what?\u201d Brown said. In response, the officer said he was trying to prevent Brown from kicking anyone. Other videos obtained by WISN-TV show an officer talking with two others who are seated in a squad car as they explained they were trying to protect themselves during the arrest. They also talk about how they could be perceived as racist for arresting a black Bucks player, with one saying if anything goes wrong, it \u201cis going to be, `Ooh, the Milwaukee Police Department is all racist, blah, blah, blah.\u201d\u2018 Another video shows an officer in his squad car, calling to let a supervisor know he\u2019ll need to be on overtime before singing, \u201cMoney, money, money, money, money.\u201d In a statement Monday, Chris Ott, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Wisconsin, said his organization was \u201coutraged\u201d that the officers \u201cwere focused on planning damage control for their excessive use of force, instead of treating Mr. Brown with the dignity and professionalism that everyone \u2014 whether a Bucks player or not \u2014 deserves from the police.\u201d Milwaukee police Chief Alfonso Morales has apologized to Brown and on May 23 released body camera footage of the officer who initially contacted the basketball player outside the store. The incident happened a month before Morales was appointed chief, following the retirement of Edward Flynn. Since becoming chief, Morales has pledged to improve the Police Department\u2019s relationship with minorities and to be more transparent with cases of officer misconduct. Morales said Monday that raw video footage from all body cameras was released solely to Brown\u2019s attorneys last week. Additional videos will be released to those filing public records requests once statutory requirements have been reached, Morales said in a statement."},{"id":40090,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/legendary-moments-history-patrick-ewing-new-york-knicks-finals-1994","date":"2018-06-04","title":"Legendary Moments In NBA History: New York Knicks return to NBA Finals at last","content":"During a two-decade long stretch in the 20th century, fans of the New York Knicks waited season after season for their team to return to The Finals stage after they won it all in 1974. Many seasons of heartbreak, disappointment and unfulfilled dreams spanned that 20-year stretch until June 5, 1994. It was on that date that Patrick Ewing and the Knicks returned to The Finals stage, albeit in thrilling fashion. New York powered past the Indiana Pacers 94-90 in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference finals to reach its first Finals since 1974. Ewing put the Knicks on his back, scoring 24 points and hauling in 22 rebounds in the win. The Knicks had to claw back into the game, using an 18-9 run to open the fourth quarter. The victory was sealed when Ewing delivered a put-back dunk off John Starks\u2019 missed layup with 26.9 seconds left. \u201cIf we were going to go down, I wanted it to be in my hands.

He\u2019s that kind of talent. He\u2019s not as good a low-block player as Hakeem, but the similarity is that, if he catches it eight feet from the basket, he\u2019s gonna score. There\u2019s nothing you can do about it. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have Hakeem\u2019s shimmy moves, but facing the basket, he\u2019s certainly better than Hakeem was at the same stage of his career. This kid\u2019s got good footwork, agility, the ability to run the floor, explosiveness, intelligence and skill. He\u2019s special.\u201d When Boyle shook Ayton\u2019s hand after the third time his Buffaloes played the Wildcats, in the quarterfinals of the Pac-12 Tournament, he told the big man he was happy to see him move on to the NBA, where the Phoenix Suns, having won the lottery, will most likely make him the No. 1 pick in the Draft. Lest the Suns decide they might get better value dealing the pick, well, Boyle can\u2019t imagine that happening. \u201cThis kid\u2019s just scary,\u201d Boyle said. \u201cYou see him on tape and how he finishes dunks. It\u2019s like he\u2019s playing with a Nerf ball in the basement. Then you see him in person. If you were going to build the perfect basketball player on a computer screen, you\u2019d want someone who\u2019s 7 feet and cut, who can run and jump and make perimeter shots. You\u2019d build Deandre Ayton.\u201d Colorado managed to win one game of the three it played against Arizona. That was the first one, where Ayton scored 26 points, grabbed five rebounds and blocked two shots. The Buffs lost the next two, but they whittled down Ayton\u2019s contributions each time. By the third game, Ayton contributed just 10 points, six boards and three blocks. Boyle\u2019s plan was to front Ayton and try to prevent him from catching the ball anywhere close to the basket. A second defender was always nearby to help and try to turn Ayton into a passer, a skill Boyle thinks Ayton hasn\u2019t mastered \u2014 yet. \u201cI played with Danny Manning,\u201d Boyle said. \u201cDanny was such a good passer. If you brought [a second defender] at him, he\u2019d find somebody on the floor or skip it. Deandre isn\u2019t at that level yet, but I think he\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d  With Ayton, Colorado decided to pick its poison. The consensus first-team All-American, Pac-12 Player of the Year and Karl Malone Award winner shot a solid 34 percent from 3-point range, albeit in limited attempts, and, per Hoop-Math.com , he also made 43 percent of his face-up 2-pointers during the season, solid considering those made up 44 percent of his total attempts. \u201cWe decided if he wanted to pick and pop and beat us with 15-foot jump shots, go right ahead,\u201d Boyle said. \u201cWe had to keep him away from the 10- to 15-toot foot area, where if he catches it, he just overpowers you or goes around you. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s not capable of making that 15- to 17-foot jump shot. That\u2019s just what you have to live with.\u201d Colorado\u2019s strategy of containing Ayton led to one of the biggest upsets in the 2018 NCAA Tournament. Arizona drew Buffalo in the first round. Bulls coach Nate Oats replaced Bobby Hurley when the latter moved on to Arizona State and spoke to his old boss as soon as the NCAA bracket was announced. Ayton was a primary topic of the conversation. \u201cBobby didn\u2019t think you could front him,\u201d Oats said. \u201cBut I said we\u2019re going to front him. Colorado was the only team in the Pac-12 that I saw that actually fronted him. Everybody else played zone, which I could understand because they had another 7-footer in the lineup [Dusan Ristic]. But Ayton\u2019s got great basketball feel. You can\u2019t keep a body on him in the zone. You can\u2019t pressure the ball in the zone. \u201cWe sat Ristic\u2019s man right behind Ayton. Offensively, we didn\u2019t think their spacing was that great. They had two pros, both 7 feet, and you\u2019ve gotta play them. But that also limits how you space the floor.\u201d Buffalo\u2019s plan worked. Ayton still managed to deliver 14 points and 13 boards, but Arizona shot 11 percent (2 of 18) from 3. The Wildcats couldn\u2019t take advantage when the Bulls sprang the double team on Ayton, who passed for just one assist. \u201cLimiting his touches and keeping it congested around him,\u201d Oats said. \u201cDaring them to skip the ball to a shooter on the back side. That was our plan.\u201d At least Boyle and Oats had some time to prepare for Ayton. When SMU played the Wildcats in the Battle 4 Atlantis last November, coach Tim Jankovich and his staff had just a few hours to get ready. \u201cOur preparation was by the seat of our pants,\u201d Jankovich said. \u201cWe went to bed late that night. But we figured out we were going to front him and trap. We double teamed him, but a different way than we\u2019d been doing.\u201d Jankovich wouldn\u2019t elaborate. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a trade secret,\u201d he said, laughing. SMU\u2019s double team worked. The Mustangs won. Ayton still piled up 17 points and 15 rebounds, but he took only 11 shots and six free throws. And the Wildcats shot 25 percent (5 of 20) from 3. Boyle, Oats and Jankovich all figured out a way to deal with Ayton, but their message to his future opponents in the NBA was essentially the same. Good luck. \u201cI think he\u2019s going to be a better pro than he was a college player, and he was a great college player,\u201d Oats said. \u201cSean [Miller] is an unbelievable coach and did a great job with the kid. But in the NBA, the spacing\u2019s better. You can\u2019t double that easily.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t fathom him not being impactful, and right away, too,\u201d Jankovich said. \u201cHe\u2019s one of those rare players that you can\u2019t help but keep your eye on during the game, because he\u2019s so different than most. Your eye always goes to him. That\u2019s all great players. You don\u2019t mean to focus on him, but when you can\u2019t help but do it, you\u2019re always worried, every possession.\u201d * * * Chris Dortch is the editor of the Blue Ribbon College Basketball Yearbook .

But Golden State\u2019s defense, top 10-ranked during the season , has been essential to its success through these Finals runs and was on display Sunday. * The Wrap:  Complete Game 2 coverage The Warriors dialed up their intensity and initial resistance against LeBron James, sending an extra man early to force decisions on the Cavs\u2019 superstar. The Warriors\u2019 versatile and enveloping Draymond Green was the point of the spear but he had lots of help. \u201cWe at least made him somewhat uncomfortable at times,\u201d Golden State coach Steve Kerr said. \u201cI mean, you\u2019ve got to do your best. You\u2019ve got to pressure him. You\u2019ve got to know he\u2019s going to end up with 30 points and a triple-double and all that stuff because he\u2019s that good. But we just made things a little more difficult for him tonight.\u201d The \u201cwe\u201d included a strong defensive performance from Kevin Durant, who\u2019s normally lauded more for his scoring prowess. But Durant was a cul-de-sac for Cleveland as far as second chances, glomming onto nine rebounds, all defensive. \u201cJust activity,\u201d Kerr said of Durant. \u201cHe was getting after it. Game 1, I didn\u2019t think he played his best defensive game. Kevin is going to probably have 26 points whether he plays well or not. That\u2019s how talented he is. So he\u2019s always going to score. It\u2019s not about scoring, it\u2019s about the defensive intensity, it\u2019s about his work on the glass. I thought he set a really good tone for us with his defense early in the game.\u201d Said Durant, who also hit 10 of his 14 shots and passed for seven assists: \u201c We\u2019re doing a good job with making second and third efforts. We did a better job of boxing out. I think the offensive rebounds that they grabbed this game weren\u2019t back-breaking like last game.\u201d There was a comic moment in the middle of the Klay Thompson-Curry postgame podium interview when Thompson shared a light-bulb moment with his audience. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize how much you use your ankle until you hurt it,\u201d he said, \u201cbut\u2026\u201d Interrupting, Curry said: \u201cYou should have asked me.\u201d The Golden State point guard had four ankle injuries this season, and his early years were marked by some serious ones . Thompson on Saturday was moving as gingerly as an octogenarian. But Sunday, after spending what he said felt like the three entire off days between games on the trainers\u2019 table, he barely gave an indication of the high left ankle sprain suffered early in Game 1, and scored 20 points in nearly 34 minutes. Said teammate Draymond Green: \u201cI thought there was no chance he was playing tonight. I mean, I saw him walking in yesterday and saw his ankle and I was like, yeah, there\u2019s no chance he\u2019s playing. \u2026 But he came out there and gutted through it. That\u2019s just a microcosm of who he is, one of the toughest guys if not the toughest guy I\u2019ve ever played with.\u201d Now that he has one eye all bloodied up , enough even to creep out his daughter when he Facetimed a call home, James more than ever has that Terminator look to him . But he most definitely is human and it showed in specific stretches and in his overall stats line, which reached triple-double awesomeness without denting the record book as in Game 1. In the second quarter, for instance, James missed five of his seven shots and was a minus-9, racking up half of his overall minus-18 for the night. \u201cI mean, he definitely had a more than decent game,\u201d Green said. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got to make things as tough as you can on him. He\u2019s already a great player, and then you give him the easy things and he\u2019s just getting into a rhythm and he\u2019s dialing everything up. At that point there is really nothing you can do. From the start of [this] game we played with more force.\u201d James looked fatigued at times, though he only copped to that once. \u201cThey doubled me a few times when I caught the ball in the post, something they didn\u2019t do in Game 1,\u201d James said. \u201cSo I got off the ball, trusted my teammates. But as far as working harder, I think I got tired once.\u201d That was a storyline coming into The Finals, because Cleveland has a bunch of relatively new mismatched toys and Golden State is missing injured Andre Iguodala while leaning on a few unproven pieces (hello, Nick Young). And yet, former knucklehead JaVale McGee \u2014 whose reputation has been rehabbed since he joined the Warriors \u2014 started, played 18 minutes and helped his team put pace into the game. He finished with 12 points on 6-for-6 shooting. Veteran backup Shaun Livingston took five shots and made \u2018em all, continuing to pester Cleveland from mid-range. Then there was wily vet David West, a big man by trade who hit his first corner 3-pointer since, er, November. \u201cDavid West\u2019s three was probably the biggest three of the game,\u201d Green said. \u201cThey were kind of making a run, and they wouldn\u2019t go away and then he hit that three from the corner right in front of their bench. It was a gut punch. He said, \u2018Man, [assistant coach] Mike Brown has been telling me to shoot it.\u2019 So shout out to Mike Brown.\u201d Every time these teams have met in The Finals, Cleveland has had to start on the road. That\u2019s part of the reason for the holes the Cavaliers dig each spring, only one of which they managed to dig out from in the first three Finals series. It\u2019s probably not fair to expect Cleveland to have won 67 games as the Warriors did heading to their 2015 and \u201817 clashes. And, of course, 73 was off the charts in \u201816 \u2014 and didn\u2019t protect Golden State that year after all. But the defending champs only pushed to 58 victories this season, a number that the Cavaliers could have reached if not for all their regular-season hiccups. Winning Game 7 at Oracle in 2016 might have given them the wrong kind of message about homecourt advantage. And they happen to be 8-1 at Quicken Loans Arena in these playoffs . Oh well, that\u2019s over and done with now. What\u2019s left is for Cleveland to protect home court and try to stretch this into a best-of-three series. \u201cWe want to continue to be uncomfortable,\u201d James said. \u201cJust because we\u2019re going home doesn\u2019t mean we can relax. This is the last team in the world you want to relax against. \u201cI will continue to stay uncomfortable, and I hope our guys continue to stay uncomfortable no matter with us going back home.\u201d Anything James can draw from three consecutive years of falling behind 0-2? The Cavs star didn\u2019t mince words: \u201cNo.\u201d * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

Sometimes \u2026 well, you can\u2019t explain why you do things you do. * * * When I was 13 or 14, I can\u2019t remember exactly, I had a summer job with some kids I knew from school and the neighborhood. Basically, the job was to sing in a choir. It was a gospel choir that went to senior homes in the area and performed for the residents. We learned about singing in harmony, of course, but also about the values of practice, teamwork and camaraderie \u2014 and, breathing exercises. Decades later, I can still remember how to exhale in short bursts while pulling on my diaphragm \u2014 that muscle in your stomach being key to holding long notes. So, we were a pretty close-knit group by the end of the summer. One day, after practice, we were walking back toward home on an ungodly hot day. One of our members recognized a house \u2014 the home of one of their good and close friends. We went up, about four or five of us, and knocked on the door to see if the friend was there. No answer. Did I mention it was unbearably hot and humid? Someone lamented that it was a shame no one was home, because we could all use a drink of water or lemonade or tea or whatever cold beverage was available. You know, the person who was friends with the person that wasn\u2019t home said, they leave their windows open. She\u2019s my friend. I\u2019m sure they wouldn\u2019t mind if we just went in and got something to drink. At this point, in retrospect, I can only surmise that my cerebral cortex temporarily disconnected from the thalamus and basal ganglia in my head and just lay there, its various functions \u2014 most notably, common sense \u2014 momentarily rendered useless. I said nothing. I did nothing. I just stood there on the porch of someone\u2019s house that I did not know, and watched my friend go through the window of the house, go into the house, and open the door of the house. What was left of my teenage brain must have gurgled, \u201cCool. Problem solved. Let\u2019s get some water.\u201d The police later called it \u201cbreaking and entering.\u201d Fortunately, the owner of the house, once it was determined our collective motivation was extreme vapidity and not larceny, did not feel it worth the time, effort or cost to press charges against us. My father was angry with me, of course, but moreso, he was just stupefied, as anyone with a functioning cerebral cortex would have been. I was among the scholars at my school, a reader, someone with potential. I was neither a breaker nor an enterer. None of us were. Our choir was comprised of the geeks, the brains, the nerds, the kids you didn\u2019t have to worry about. What the hell were you thinking? * * * So, many years later, a part of me is sympathetic toward Bryan Colangelo, the president of basketball operations of the Philadelphia 76ers, whose job reportedly hangs in the balance this morning as the owners of the team decide how to resolve this \u2026 well, what do you call this, exactly? Colangelo, the scion of one of pro basketball\u2019s most prestigious families, remains accused through strong inference if not outright evidence of being behind several burner Twitter accounts which have, ever since he was named president of the 76ers in 2016, served to make him and his decisions look good while taking shots at just about everyone else that\u2019s been in his universe during that time \u2014 a list including, but not limited to, his predecessor as GM in Philly, Sam Hinkie, former Sixer Jahlil Okafor, current players Joel Embiid and Markelle Fultz and Masai Ujiri, the Raptors\u2019 general manager. A story in on TheRinger.com \u2014 Bill Simmons\u2019 outfit \u2014 last week connected dots supplied by an anonymous source (back to that in a minute) which tied Colangelo to five Twitter accounts with anonymous owners. One of them did not tweet at all; the other four did. Within hours of The Ringer asking the 76ers and Colangelo to try and explain this, three of the accounts went from public to private, meaning they were no longer accessible unless the owner of the account granted access. And, the team, through Colangelo, acknowledged that he did indeed run one of the accounts \u2014 the one that never sent a Tweet. Colangelo said he did so to monitor social media activities in \u201cour industry,\u201d but said he had never sent any tweets and didn\u2019t know who had sent the tweets from the other accounts. Subsequently, other Twitter sleuths deduced that three of the accounts had a phone number contact whose last two digits matched the last two digits of a phone number belonging to Colangelo\u2019s wife, Barbara Colangelo. Again, the inference \u2014 not fact \u2014 is that Barbara Colangelo could have been the one sending the tweets that just happened to defend and promote her husband\u2019s decisions, while lambasting other people. There are \u2014 at least potentially \u2014 legal hurdles that such disclosures as those alleged to have been sent or otherwise connected to Colangelo could create for the 76ers, and thus make it easier for the team to fire him for cause. (Sources indicate the 76ers\u2019 internal investigation into Colangelo and the accounts is likely to be completed by this Wednesday. SI.com\u2019s outstanding legal expert Michael McCann breaks down the various possibilities here .) The fallout was immediate, the implications obvious. LeBron James can opt out and become a free agent and is someone of interest to the 76ers this summer. He was asked during the media availability session at The Finals Saturday if he\u2019d seen the tweets from Cavs owner Dan Gilbert before Game 1 of The Finals. In those tweets, Gilbert credited both James\u2019 performance during the season and the trades last summer that sent Kyrie Irving to Boston and at the deadline last February that brought four new players in, as catalysts for Cleveland\u2019s postseason run. James paused a beat for maximum comic timing. \u201cIt was his account, right?,\u201d James said, laughing. Sure that went over great with 76ers majority owner Josh Harris and the others in his circle of influence that will decide Colangelo\u2019s fate. The next 48 hours \u2014 this should be done, one way or another, by midweek \u2014 will tell the tale. Even if Colangelo broke no laws, he has a lot \u2014 a lot \u2014 of explaining to do. The biggest problem isn\u2019t with other teams \u2014 people will do what they deem in their clubs\u2019 best interest no matter who they must work with. They\u2019d trade with North Korea if Kim Jong Un had an extra first-round pick or a 7-footer on an expiring contract. Please keep in mind that a good chunk of the anonymous league execs you see tut-tutting about Colangelo\u2019s alleged misdeeds would saw their cars in half with a rusty knife if they could take his job. Their tuts have to be viewed within that context. Then there is the matter of the source of The Ringer\u2019s report. I don\u2019t know the reporter and have no reason to doubt his word that he was approached by an anonymous person who had determined that Colangelo operated the five separate Twitter accounts. But it\u2019s fair to question who that person is\/was, and what their motivations were. I do not believe that this was some benign naif who just stumbled upon the similarities in the accounts by accident or happenstance algorithm. What are the odds that somebody just fishing found this by accident? The writer himself acknowledged that he was a frequent critic of Colangelo\u2019s and thus would likely be viewed as a sympathetic media person to whom such information could be given with an expectation of follow through\/publishing. So, again \u2026 who would stand to benefit from such a disclosure? No, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s Hinkie. But a lot of people \u2014 thousands of people \u2014 believed in Hinkie\u2019s Process, almost religiously. Some were Sixers fans; others worked with him in Philly and left when he did or soon after; still others worked for other teams, media outlets and within the league office. I just don\u2019t believe in coincidences. If Colangelo were to land James or, say, San Antonio Spurs forward Kawhi Leonard this summer, the Sixers would be set as a powerhouse for years to come and Colangelo\u2019s status as an elite level GM would be cemented as the conference finals and\/or Finals appearances flowed. This was the optimal \u2014 and, maybe, the last \u2014 chance to take him down. It doesn\u2019t mean what is alleged didn\u2019t happen. It does mean that someone may have had an axe to grind, and as such, the information they provided needs to be vetted even more thoroughly than it would be normally. The only salient issue will be within the Sixers\u2019 building, and with the player agents outside it who wield the real power in this league. Bryan Colangelo helped build great teams with the Phoenix Suns and good ones with the Toronto Raptors, for which he\u2019s twice been named NBA Executive of the Year ( in 2005 and in \u201807 ). That helped him land the Philly job, which came open after Hinkie\u2019s resignation in 2016 \u2013 which in itself was forced, though everyone denies it now, by ownership\u2019s frustration with the slow slog of the Process. Jerry Colangelo, an eminence grise if there ever was one in league history, was recommended\/installed as the Sixers\u2019 Chairman of Basketball Operations months before Hinkie\u2019s resignation. He brought in his son to run things after Hinkie\u2019s departure and over the last two years, Bryan Colangelo put his stamp on the franchise. Embiid was already in place, but Bryan Colangelo drafted Ben Simmons first overall in the 2016 Draft , even though there were questions about whether Simmons could play point guard in the pros. He signed shooting guard J.J. Redick last summer in free agency, and added veterans Marco Bellinelli and Ersan llyasova for the stretch run . But, he also made some moves that didn\u2019t work out. Trading up with the Boston Celtics to get the first pick in last year\u2019s Draft to take Fultz, while the Celtics got both Jayson Tatum and another first-rounder, looks like an L after the first year. Giving veteran Jerryd Bayless a three-year, $27 million deal isn\u2019t helping this coming summer. Bayless wasn\u2019t in the rotation during the playoffs but will pull down $8.5 million next season. That\u2019s the life of a GM. Win some, lose some. But most don\u2019t try to then win in the court of public opinion behind burner Twitter accounts. The tweets detail disagreement, for example, with some of Coach Brett Brown\u2019s decisions. The issue isn\u2019t that Colangelo may have disagreed with his coach; that happens every day. The issue is if he then aired their dirty laundry in public. That will make it extremely difficult for the two of them going forward \u2014 and Brown, who just got a three-year extension after taking Philly to the second round, is as strong within the organization as he\u2019s ever been. Then there is Embiid. With all due respect to Simmons, Embiid is the bell cow of the franchise. As such, he has all the juice. If he believes Colangelo really said some of the things linked to him in the tweets, Colangelo is toast. If he believes Colangelo, as he indicated in his initial reaction, Colangelo could \u2014 could \u2014 survive. But \u2026 the agents. Agents are the ultimate accelerant to or brake on their clients\u2019 dreams. Yes, the agent works for the player. But they wield an enormous amount of influence \u2014 on the player, on his family. And if they make it clear to Sixers\u2019 ownership that they can no longer trust Colangelo or his word, there will be a change. There would have to be, when Philly has so much cap space and can make a legit bid on anyone it wants to go after this summer. Their view is currently guarded. Many prominent agents contacted by NBA.com in the past few days asked to have all the facts come in before determining if they\u2019d be comfortable working with Colangelo in the future. What he does have going for him is a body of work over the years in which he has been viewed as a tough but fair negotiator, and is liked by much of the agent community with whom he\u2019s had regular dealings. \u201cI like Bryan very much and am hoping there is a logical explanation,\u201d a prominent player agent texted late last week. \u201cIf true, would be tough to confide in him, however.\u201d Another prominent agent said that while he would have no problem going forward working with Colangelo, players might be a different story. \u201cHe\u2019s always been fair and honest with me,\u201d the agent said. \u201cI hope it\u2019s not true. I think players will have a hard time trusting him though if it is. \u2026 I would tell (the agent\u2019s clients) about my personal dealings with him but this issue would certainly be one of the many factors to weigh. At the end of the day, though, the players usually (but not always) choose their destinations based on the best money offer and role.\u201d Another prominent agent, though, pointed out that Colangelo would hardly be the only front-office person engaged in, shall we say, curious behavior. \u201cThere are so few competent GMs and so few execs who don\u2019t lie,\u201d the agent said. \u201cIf those were (the) criteria we\u2019d have six GMs in the league.\u201d But leaking medical information, directly or indirectly, to a reporter, a spouse or to your Twitter followers, raises antennae \u2014 even those of agents, the most cynical creatures known to man or beast. Colangelo will be hard-pressed to survive if it is proven he either wrote or disseminated the claim that Okafor failed a physical that scotched a potential trade ( as I wrote back in \u201917 and believe now , Philly had a deal to send Okafor to Portland that fell through at the last minute \u2014 and a failed physical would certainly fit as the reason). \u201cI think it would be difficult if it\u2019s true\u201d to do business with Philly, another big-time agent said last week, \u201cjust because I think his players would have to speak up on it.\u201d Colangelo has some intangibles in his favor, though. This is an enormous offseason for the Sixers. They showed they\u2019re ready to become a power in the Eastern Conference with their run at the end of the regular season and with their playoff showing (even though their season ended in less-than-ideal fashion to Boston ). They\u2019ve prepped to be a player this summer, either through trades or in free agency. Everyone is going to take a serious look at the 76ers, whether they\u2019re an unrestricted free agent or a disgruntled talent under contract looking for a fresh start. Colangelo and his group did all the leg work \u2014 with other teams and with the agents of the key players. If Philly blows him or his team out, it will be starting from scratch with less than a month to go before free agency begins. That would be a huge gamble even if the Sixers identified someone either internally or externally to take over. Things that look disqualifying from 30,000 feet tend to get smoothed over up close, in the light and heat of real hardball, I\u2019ve found over time. Dan Gilbert\u2019s Comic Sans screed against James in 2010 didn\u2019t keep LeBron from coming back to Gilbert and Cleveland in 2014 , for example. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m excusing what Colangelo allegedly did, or at least knew was being done in his name. It\u2019s just that you know that\u2019s hardly the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the shady side of the NBA. There\u2019s so much dirt, dishonesty and secret alliances \u2014 between teams, between agents, between players, among media \u2014 that a Twitter burner account\/accounts doesn\u2019t produce the level of bile around the league that one might expect. What it was, like going into someone\u2019s house without their permission, was stupid. If Colangelo survives, it will be by the skin of his teeth. If he doesn\u2019t \u2026 the current talent bookers at what is now \u201cThe Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\u201d are Elie O\u2019Sullivan, Ashley Olivia and Katelyn Maziekien.

We\u2019re just two-plus weeks away from Draft night. There will be a thousand machinations between now and then, and a trade or two or three. In addition, regular readers know how we feel about mock drafts. What follows is not that. It\u2019s a framework \u2014 an exoskeleton \u2014 of possibilities for teams if they remain in their current Draft positions. First-round picks: No. 1 and No. 16 Needs: Point guard, center Potential Player Group (for No. 1 pick): C DeAndre Ayton, Arizona; G Luka Doncic, Real Madrid (For No. 16 pick): Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Kentucky; F Kevin Knox, Kentucky; G Lonnie Walker IV, Miami  At No. 1, you take the best player and you don\u2019t worry about need. Phoenix will have to decide between two mouth-watering 19-year-olds: the 7-foot-1 Ayton, with his massive frame and dynamic offensive potential, or the 6-foot-6 Doncic, whose mature skill set has dazzled in Europe and in international competition. If Phoenix keeps 16, it needs to address the point. The Suns were 29th in the league this season in assists per game , and while that could be alleviated somewhat next season with the return of Brandon Knight from a torn ACL, Phoenix needs a big jump at that position \u2014 something that neither Knight nor rising RFA Elfrid Payton is likely to provide. Gilgeous-Alexander came on for the Wildcats and has the size and length to potentially be impactful early in the pros. If he\u2019s off the board, Knox or Walker would give the Suns another long and athletic wing to add to Josh Jackson, Marquese Chriss and Dragan Bender. First-round pick: No. 2 Needs: Playmaking\/finishing wing Potential Player Group:  Doncic; F Marvin Bagley, Jr., Duke  The Kings want and need someone who can run with De\u2019Aaron Fox for the next decade. Doncic, with his ability to see the floor and make plays with either hand, either for himself or teammates (just look at the diversity and sophistication of his game in this highlight reel ), would be insanely good for Sacramento, helping Fox push tempo and create open looks for the likes of Bogdan Bogdanovic and Buddy Hield. Sacramento was quite good at making 3-pointers, finishing tied for third in the league with Washington in 3-point percentage (.375). But, like the Wizards, the Kings were quite bad at getting up enough deep looks; the Kings were 28th in the league in 3-point attempt rate \u2014 only 27.8 percent of their field goal attempts last season were 3-pointers (compare that to the Houston Rockets, who led the league at 50.2 percent 3PAr). It will be a shock if the Kings don\u2019t scarf up Doncic if he\u2019s on the board, but if Sacramento goes all monkey wrench on everybody, Duke\u2019s Bagley is a legit No. 2 pick. He can score, he can handle, he can shoot and he can rebound \u2014 all at a high rate. It\u2019s a mighty tempting package. First-round picks: No. 3, No. 19 and No. 30 Needs: Frontcourt scoring, defense Potential Player Group (for No. 3 pick) : Doncic, Bagley; F\/C Jaren Jackson, Jr., Michigan State (For No. 19 pick): G Khyri Thomas, Creighton; G Troy Brown, Oregon; F Keita Bates-Diop, Ohio State (For No. 30 pick): G Landry Shamet, Wichita State; G Jalen Brunson, Villanova; G Josh Okogie, Georgia Tech  There are scenarios where Doncic falls to three \u2014 if the Suns take Ayton first and the Kings go for Bagley at two. If that happens, the Hawks will have an interesting choice to make. Doncic\u2019s talents are obvious and the Hawks need to add as much talent as they can, especially at the top of the Draft. Bagley would obviously be a no-brainer here if Ayton and Doncic go 1-2. But the Hawks do need defensive help as well, as they were bottom 10 in points allowed ( 108.8 ) and Defensive Rating ( 108.2 ) this season. John Collins, Atlanta\u2019s first-rounder last year, was a good start, but the Hawks could use more help, and Jackson \u2014 the Big 10\u2019s Defensive Player of the Year as a freshman \u2014 has all kinds of defensive pedigree. There would probably be some spacing issues and overlap at the start if you played Jackson and Collins together, but in time, many scouts think Jackson will be more than credible as a stretch four. And for a team that\u2019s thinking long-term rebuild, the 18-year-old Jackson makes all kinds of sense; he should be entering his prime while still in his early 20s, perfect for the Hawks\u2019 timeline. If Atlanta keeps its two other first-round picks it\u2019s hard to see the Hawks not going for even more wing length to complete Taurean Prince and DeAndre\u2019 Bembry, or a two who can put the ball in the basket. Creighton\u2019s Thomas showed he could score and defend multiple positions in college; Oregon\u2019s Brown has length; Bates-Diop got better and better in three seasons in Columbus. * Complete 2018 Draft coverage But it would surprise if Atlanta holds onto all of its firsts this year. The Hawks have two more first-round picks coming in 2019 and they have enormous cap space and flexibility. They could use No. 19 and 30 in combination to move up in this year\u2019s Draft, package them for another potential first next year or sell them off piecemeal to teams without 2018 firsts (a list that currently includes Houston, Toronto, New Orleans, Oklahoma City, Detroit and Miami). First-round pick: No. 4 Needs: Scoring\/shooting Potential Player Group:  Doncic, Bagley, Jackson; G Trae Young, Oklahoma  When it involves anything having to do with putting the ball in the basket, Memphis needs help. The Grizzlies are currently awful across the board \u2014 in 3-point shooting ( 25th this season, .352 ), two-point shooting (28th, .486), points per game (29th, 99.3), Offensive Rating ( 27th, 101.8 ), pace ( 28th, 97.3 ) and on and on. They cannot score. So while Jackson would be a perfectly good pick at four, he won\u2019t \u2014 at least not right away \u2014 be a guy who can contribute significantly at that end. That\u2019s why Young makes the list. He\u2019s electric with the ball. He shoots it, he passes it, he creates shots for others. His size is problematic if you\u2019re playing him off the ball; he measured 6\u20191.75\u201d at Chicago . By contrast, Stephen Curry, with whom Young is always compared because of their shared ability to splash from distance, is a legit 6-foot-3. But in the small-ball era, it\u2019s not as big a potential liability as it used to be. There are rumblings that Doncic could possibly slip to this spot in the Draft. If so, he\u2019d be a no-brainer for the Grizzlies here, as would Bagley. First-round pick: No. 5 Needs: Post defense, shooting Potential Player Group:  Jackson, Young; C\/F Mo Bamba, Texas; F\/C Wendell Carter, Duke  The Mavs have exactly one tantalizing piece for the future \u2014 point guard Dennis Smith, Jr. And they need a big. So either of Bamba or Carter would make the most sense here, depending on preference. Bamba has crazy upside in the mold of the modern shot-blocking, switchable big man; Carter is rock-solid across the board, better offensively coming in than Bamba though not quite as intriguing at the defensive end. Either would step right in at the five in Dallas, though. The Mavs\u2019 woes shooting the ball in 2017-18 mean you can\u2019t completely ignore the possibility of an all-world floor stretcher like Young. But, it doesn\u2019t look at first glance that he\u2019d be a great fit playing alongside Smith. First-round pick: No. 6 Needs: Point guard Potential Player Group:  Young, G Collin Sexton, Alabama Yes, we all know that team president Jeff Weltman and GM John Hammond famously love length and athletic ability. But don\u2019t bury the lead here: it\u2019s not a stretch (no pun intended) to say that Orlando hasn\u2019t had a dynamic lead guard since Penny Hardaway in the mid-90s. (Tracy McGrady had the ball during his four seasons [2000-04] in Orlando, but he was looking to put the ball in the basket, not dish it.) The Magic must alleviate that this time around. Either Young or Sexton would make for a solid choice. They both got to the foul line at a prodigious rate as college freshmen. Sexton isn\u2019t the scorer Young is, but he\u2019s worlds better defensively and his compete gland maxes out just about every time on the floor. A franchise desperate to regain buzz and sell tickets might be more inclined to go for the offensive pyrotechnics Young can provide right away, though. First-round picks: No. 7 and No. 22 Needs: Perimeter scoring, defense Potential Player Group (for No. 7 pick): Young, Bamba, Carter; F Michael Porter, Jr., Missouri; F Mikal Bridges, Villanova (For No. 22 pick): G Grayson Allen, Duke; G Kevin Huerter, Maryland  The Bulls desperately need wing help. There\u2019s just not enough thump from its current small forward combo of Bobby Portis and Denzel Valentine. They are solid role players and good rotation guys, but don\u2019t bring enough offensive firepower to adjust opponent scouting reports. And even if Chicago decides to invest long-term in free agent Zach LaVine at the two, his wild inconsistency on defense traveled with him from Minnesota. If the medicals check out on Porter\u2019s back after surgery kept him out almost all of last season, he\u2019d be a worthwhile pick here to play alongside Lauri Markkanen. If there\u2019s any doubt about Porter physically, Bridges filled a lot of roles for the Wildcats en route to their national championship and would be a safe pick. If Carter\u2019s still on the board, there would be nothing wrong with grabbing the heir apparent to Robin Lopez in the middle, either. With its second first-round pick, Chicago could potentially go Draft-and-stash as it did years ago with Nikola Mirotic. First-round pick: No. 8 Needs: Perimeter defense Potential Player Group: Mikal Bridges, Porter, Sexton; F Miles Bridges, Michigan State  It\u2019s difficult to project what the Cavs do here \u2014 even if the Cavs are drafting here \u2014 with the 40,000-pound elephant that is Decision 3.0 with James looming. Cleveland is just as likely to move this pick if it can get a veteran that could help James immediately as it is to hold onto it, the remaining jewel from the Kyrie Irving trade last summer . It\u2019s hard to see James being excited about any of the Draft possibilities that would, under normal circumstances, be viewed as adding needed youth and depth to a championship roster \u2014 the word \u201croster\u201d here defined as any team that LeBron is on in a given season. One could see any of playoff-caliber teams in the teens circling this pick as the one they could move up to snag in exchange for a vet who could help James right now. Any of the Denver Nuggets (picking 14th at present), Wizards (15th) or Milwaukee Bucks (17th) could make a plausible offer. But if the Cavs keep the pick, you\u2019d think they\u2019d go for a two-way wing. Cleveland was awful all season keeping the ball out of the paint or getting to shooters \u2014 opponents shot a league-best 44.6 percent this season against the Cavs on corner 3-pointers. Either Bridges would make sense as a result, as would Porter; he\u2019s not the defensive presence that either Bridges is, but he\u2019s got good length ( his wingspan at the Combine measured more than 7 feet ) and his offensive skills would compliment James. If James is still there. Sexton would give Cleveland a legit young point guard whether James stays or not. First-round pick: No. 9 Needs: Wing length\/defense, shooting Potential Player Group: Porter, Mikal Bridges, Miles Bridges The Knicks like their point guard group and think one of Frank Ntilikna or Emmanuel Mudiay will ultimately take hold of the job, with Trey Burke looking like he\u2019s found a niche in New York as a backup. So even if Sexton is available, it\u2019s likely New York will pass on him and go for the best perimeter guy left on the board. Either of the two Bridgeses or Porter could step in at the three right away, though each may have to play some four as well, at least at the start of the season, while Kristaps Porzingis continues to rehab his torn ACL . First-round picks: No. 10 and No. 26 Needs: Young two guard\/frontcourt depth Potential Player Group (for No. 10 pick): Mikal Bridges, Miles Bridges, Walker (For No. 26 pick): G Donte DiVincenzo, Villanova; G\/F Jacob Evans, Cincinnati  The Sixers are, uh, in a transition period of sorts this morning, as we all wait to see what happens with GM Bryan Colangelo. In the interim, Philly\u2019s hold on this pick is not ironclad, given that the Sixers could clear more than $3.5 million \u2014 the first-round guarantee for the 10th pick \u2014 by dealing it altogether. Every potential cent this summer for a marquee free agent is precious, after all. But if Philly holds onto the pick, getting a young shooting guard to apprentice under J.J. Redick and\/or Marco Bellinelli would be ideal. (It would be a shock if Redick, an unrestricted free agent in a month, wasn\u2019t re-signed, but at a rate far less than the $23 million he got this past season.) Mikal Bridges would be a popular local pick, obviously. But if he\u2019s gone, a talent like Miami\u2019s Walker, who can shoot and has two-way potential, could fit right in. If the Sixers keep the No. 26 pick, it may be hard not to take local hero . His explosion into a possible first-round selection was fueled by his record-setting performance in the Wildcats\u2019 national championship victory over Michigan (his 31 points off the bench were the most ever by a non-starter in a title game). Plus, he had impressive measurables at the Chicago pre-Draft Combine, boasting the highest standing vertical leap of all participants and tied Georgia Tech\u2019s Okogie for the highest max vertical leap \u2014 42 inches ). First-round pick: No. 11 Needs: Perimeter playmaking\/scoring, power forward Potential Player Group: Mikal Bridges, Miles Bridges, Walker; F\/C Robert Williams, Texas A&M The Hornets have underwhelmed at the 2-4 spots in recent seasons, having spent a lot of money and Draft picks on players that have not played anywhere near elite status (Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, Nicolas Batum, Marvin Williams, Frank Kaminsky, Malik Monk). Upgrades are likely. New GM Mitch Kupchak\u2019s Draft history with the Lakers was going for Power 5 players in the first round (among the few exceptions was when the Lakers went for high schooler Andrew Bynum with the 10th pick overall in 2005 ), so Michigan State\u2019s Bridges wouldn\u2019t be a shock here. If the Hornets surprise and take a point guard prospect like Shai Gilgeous-Alexander here, that would be a strong indication they\u2019re likely to move All-Star Kemba Walker. First-round picks: No. 12 and No. 13 Needs: Shooting, athletic length Potential Player Group: Walker, Brown, Gilgeous-Alexander, Knox, Williams With Patrick Beverley expected back at the point next season, a two would seem to be in order for the Clips out of the gate. Avery Bradley is an unrestricted free agent whose future in town is up in the air and Austin Rivers entering the last year deal of his deal. That would likely point toward Walker or Brown depending on availability. Knox could play some four in the NBA, though he\u2019s thin coming into the league. You keep heaving that DeAndre Jordan wants to stay in L.A. through the Clips\u2019 rebuild; if true, that wouldn\u2019t preclude taking a young big like Williams just in case Jordan changes his mind (he\u2019s never done that, right?). First-round pick: No. 14 Needs: Defense; small forward Potential Player Group:  Knox, Thomas, Williams; F\/G Zhaire Smith, Texas Tech; F Chandler Hutchison, Boise State The Nuggets were a sieve defensively this season, ranking DFL in opponents\u2019 3-point percentage ( .378 ) and 26th in the league in Defensive Rating ( 108.8 ). Thomas\u2019 wingspan is longer than Smith\u2019s, but Smith is taller; either could help as a backup to incumbent two Gary Harris or as a potential small-ball three. Williams would be able to play alongside Nikola Jokic (I am assuming the Nuggets and \u201cThe Joker\u201d figure out a long-term deal at some point in the next calendar year). He would help immediately as a rim-protector and second-unit big who could allow Denver\u2019s reserves to engage in pushing tempo just as severely in the Mile High as the Nuggets\u2019 starters. First-round pick: No. 15 Needs: Young size, perimeter shooting Potential Player Group: Williams, Walker, Brown, Knox, Hutchison With incumbent Marcin Gortat not long for the roster (entering the final year of his contract, and a strong possibility to be dealt anyway), the Wizards need to find a young big who can help get them back to what made them formidable a couple of years ago \u2014 turning opponents over and getting John Wall and company out in transition. If that\u2019s not available then a 3-and-D wing that could play alongside Otto Porter Jr. would make sense. That would give Washington some flexibility if it needed, potentially, to move Kelly Oubre Jr. as part of a package to acquire said young big man mentioned above. First-round pick: No. 17 Needs: Post defense, point guard Potential Player Group: Gilgeous-Alexander, Thomas; G Aaron Holiday, UCLA The Bucks definitely need a young big with rim protection on the resume. Per basketball-reference.com, Milwaukee gave up the highest percentage of opponent field goal attempts this season from three feet in and closer \u2014 almost a third (.328). But if there\u2019s not an obvious choice there, it wouldn\u2019t shock if Milwaukee moved back in the Draft and counted on new coach Mike Budenholzer and his incoming staff to get more D out of the existing bigs on the roster (most notably Thon Maker). The Bucks also have a decision to make on incumbent point Eric Bledsoe, who\u2019ll be entering the final year of his contract next season. There should be any number of young, quality point guards available where Milwaukee is picking that won\u2019t be nearly as expensive to retain in the next 3-5 years as Bledsoe is likely to be. First-round pick: No. 18 Needs: Youth, wings Potential Player Group: Hutchison, Brown, Bates-Diop, Allen The Spurs haven\u2019t had a Draft pick this high since \u2026 taking Tim Duncan first overall in 1997 . Let that sink in with your Cheerios. But, of course, there\u2019s a lot of \u201cthis hasn\u2019t happened in a long time in San Antonio\u201d going on these days. Everything obviously rests on what happens first with Kawhi Leonard. If there\u2019s an amicable resolution between San Antonio and Leonard and he\u2019s full speed ahead going forward, the Spurs can be more selective with the pick. If they\u2019re still uncertain about Leonard\u2019s intentions on Draft night, they\u2019ll have to expand their potential universe of players. First-round pick: No. 20 Needs: Wing shooting Potential Player Group: Hutchison, Allen, Huerter The Wolves have to give Karl-Anthony Towns more room to operate. Incumbents Jimmy Butler and Andrew Wiggins weren\u2019t near scary enough from 3-point range ( 35 and 33 percent, respectively ) to make defenses not load up in the paint. And with Jamal Crawford likely to opt out of the second year of his deal, there are no proven floor-spacers on the bench. So, Minnesota is likely to go for need here and take the best guy left on the board. Allen adds playmaking ability that could help Butler and Jeff Teague. Huerter\u2019s had a meteoric rise up Draft boards in the last month, shining at the Combine, and kept his name in the Draft once it became clear he was likely to go in the first round. First-round pick: No. 21 Needs: Shooting, frontcourt depth Potential Player Group: Bates-Diop, Huerter; F Dzanan Musa, Cedevita; F Melvin Frazier, Tulane With Utah\u2019s entire starting five under contract for next season and only Ricky Rubio up after next year (and likely to re-sign), there\u2019s no huge need for the Jazz at present. Utah will need to get a big if Derrick Favors leaves in free agency, but there will likely be several veteran free agents on the market and in Utah\u2019s price range. Another wing who can fill it up is the way to go. Given that the Jazz maneuvered to Rudy Gobert via trade (he was the 27th pick overall in the first round in 2014 ), got Joe Ingles off waivers and traded for Donovan Mitchell (13th overall) in last year\u2019s Draft , do you have any doubt that GM Dennis Lindsey is going to find someone good here? First-round pick: No. 23 Needs: Frontcourt depth Potential Player Group: F Mo Wagner, Indiana; F Omari Spellman, Villanova; C\/F Mitchell Robinson, Chalmette (LA) HS The Pacers will likely be in insurance mode with starting four Thaddeus Young entering the last year of his deal \u2014 though Domantas Sabonis certainly appears to be the heir apparent there \u2014 or in case they don\u2019t pick up Al Jefferson\u2019s 2018-19 option ($10 million). With a playoff team looking to go further next year, the least drama-causing young big available will thus be the Pacers\u2019 aim. Either Wagner or Spellman, who faced off against one another in the 2018 NCAA title game, would be fine here. Indy could take a flier on Robinson, the talented but mercurial talent who was supposed to play at Western Kentucky, but didn\u2019t, and who was supposed to be at the Combine, but withdrew. He\u2019s talented, but \u2026 geesh. First-round pick: No. 24 Needs: Backcourt depth\/perimeter shooting Potential Player Group: Holiday, Shamet, Brunson, Frazier One guesses that the Blazers won\u2019t be in possession of this pick by Draft time, given their current cap situation \u2014 already more than $110 million, and needing to get Jusuf Nurkic signed to a long-term deal (he\u2019s got one non-guaranteed year left on his deal) along with re-upping unrestricted free agent Ed Davis. We\u2019re figuring Portland doesn\u2019t hold onto this pick or uses it to move down into the second round. If by chance that doesn\u2019t happen, there should be several quality guards from which to pick who could give either Damian Lillard or C.J. McCollum some rest. First-round pick: No. 25 Needs: Everything outside of point guard Potential Player Group: Spellman, Thomas, Huerter, DiVincenzo The Lakers will do their most important work 10 days after the Draft, as we all know, when the free-agent negotiating period officially begins. But this late first-round pick will be important in adding to the team\u2019s talent base before it makes its various official pitches. A big to help score and rebound if sixth man Julius Randle leaves via free agency wouldn\u2019t hurt, nor would a two that can knock down jumpers and get to the cup playing off of \u2026 well, someone of stature. First-round pick: No. 27 Needs: Center Potential Player Group: Robinson, Spellman; C Brandon McCoy, UNLV The Celtics are two deep at just about every position going forward other than center. Aron Baynes \u2014 who backs up Al Horford \u2014 is an unrestricted free agent this summer and fellow big man Greg Monroe is unlikely to be re-signed. So if the Celtics don\u2019t use the pick for a Draft-and-stash guy or sell it outright, they\u2019ll probably be in the market for a young big. McCoy, the Mountain West Freshman of the Year, had more than 100 NBA types at Joe Abunassar\u2019s impact Sports in Vegas last week for his pre-Draft workout. He was wildly inconsistent in his one college season. He\u2019s also 7-foot-1 and talented. So \u2026 you do the math. First-round pick: No. 28 Needs: Frontcourt depth Potential Player Group: Spellman, McCoy; C Udoka Azubuike, Kansas; F\/C Chimezie Metu, USC The Warriors wound up shorthanded in these playoffs with a center-heavy roster whose backup big men couldn\u2019t play against small ball opponents. So it\u2019s more likely the Warriors will try and find minimum-salaried veterans who can wait for their moment and produce than bring in another kid who needs seasoning. But \u2026 you never know. Golden State found a diamond in the rough last year by trading on Draft night for Bulls 2017 second-round pick Jordan Bell . First-round pick: No. 29 Needs: Shooting guard, power forward Potential Player Group: Shamet, DiVincenzo, De\u2019Anthony Melton, USC The Nets have done an admirable job finding ways to add young talent without having a lot of quality picks, and they\u2019ll get fully out of cap jail next year. Adding a quality scoring guard to complement all of Brooklyn\u2019s young points \u2014 Joe Harris ( 41.9 percent on 3-pointers last season ) is an unrestricted free agent this summer and might be out of the Nets\u2019 price range \u2014 will help firm up Brooklyn\u2019s roster. * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

Smith, Billy Donovan and more","content":" Me, I ain\u2019t so much touched a burner for a year now. From Dave Singleton: Oh, man: what a great (and dangerous) question for me to try and answer ! It\u2019s hard to project the behaviors and self-indulgence of today\u2019s social media consumers (of which I\u2019m one, unfortunately) with the more genteel time in which pre-Twitter NBA lived. And \u2026 you said \u201cget caught.\u201d This would assume incompetence\/sloppiness, and that could only get me in trouble. A guy like the late Jerry Krause, the architect of the Bulls\u2019 championship teams in the \u201890s, who craved secrecy and information, might well use any means to get info. But he wouldn\u2019t have been caught, IMHO. I don\u2019t know \u2026 maybe Dennis Rodman? Yes, definitely Rodman. I blame you each and every day\/It\u2019s your fault that I\u2019m completely blown away.  From Yitshak Merin: In that situation \u2014 tie score, with your guy on the foul line \u2014 I don\u2019t think a coach would say \u2018in case our guy misses, and we get the rebound, call timeout.\u2019 First, you wouldn\u2019t want to put a negative thought like that in your team\u2019s head \u2014 \u2018if our guy misses the free throw.\u2019 Second, you wouldn\u2019t normally want to call timeout in that situation, because it would allow the opposing team\u2019s defense to get set up out of the timeout. If the other team was shooting a free throw in a tie game, you would give that instruction, because if you get the now defensive rebound, and call timeout, you can advance the ball to midcourt. But in Lue\u2019s\/Cleveland\u2019s situation, I\u2019d rather not call time. I\u2019d try to get as good a shot as possible in those 4.7 seconds. The play Smith obviously should have made was to just get the ball back to LeBron, who was wide open about 25-27 feet from the basket just right of the top of the key, with no defender within 4-5 feet of him. He could have easily taken a couple of dribbles and pulled up from somewhere just inside or outside of the 3-point line with an unencumbered look at the basket. Or, Smith could have gotten a shot off himself with plenty of time to spare. It would have likely been contested, but Smith is one of the best bad-shot makers in the game. It was his mental lapse, and I can\u2019t\/don\u2019t blame Lue on that one. Billy, Don\u2019t Be a Hero\/Don\u2019t be a Fool with Your Life. From Frank Forster: Some of your points are fair ones, Frank. But I don\u2019t blame Donovan for everything that went wrong for them this season. It\u2019s hard to coach OKC. Westbrook is so good and so willful, it\u2019s tempting to just give him the ball and clear a side every possession. And until Roberson got hurt, the Thunder was really rolling and looked like a threat in the West. Send your questions, comments and better deterrents for that friend who, no matter how strongly you object, just won\u2019t stop helping themselves to your plate to daldridgetnt@gmail.com . If your e-mail is funny, thought-provoking or snarky, we just might publish it! (Last week\u2019s averages in parenthesis) 1) James Harden (32 ppg, 6 rpg, 6 apg, .414 FG, .750 FT): Season complete. I have little doubt he\u2019ll win league MVP at the end of the month. I have equally little doubt he\u2019ll enjoy it much. 2) LeBron James (40 ppg, 8.5 rpg, 10.5 apg, .558 FG, .850 FT): Never seen him as down as he was after Game 1 Thursday, and I\u2019ve seen him after Finals-clinching losses. 3) Anthony Davis: Season complete. 4) Kevin Durant (28.7 ppg, 7.7 rpg, 6 apg, .509 FG, .833 FT): Looked better Sunday in Game 2 of The Finals than he had since early in the New Orleans series. 5) Russell Westbrook: Season complete. 89 \u2014 Consecutive playoff games with at least one 3-pointer by Stephen Curry, an NBA record. 100 \u2014 Early entry candidates for this month\u2019s Draft that withdrew by last week\u2019s deadline for college underclassmen . Among those who are going back to school next season are twins Caleb and Cody Martin from Nevada, who led the Wolfpack to the Sweet 16 in the NCAA Tournament; Syracuse guard Tyus Battle; Missouri freshman big Jontay Porter; North Carolina forward Luke Maye; Wisconsin junior forward Ethan Happ; Kentucky freshman P.J. Washington and Maryland big man Bruno Fernando. 100 \u2014 Postseason games, per the Warriors, for Klay Thompson, making him the first player in franchise history to reach the century mark in playoff appearances. 1) You have to be able to laugh at yourself . 2) Good to see the Players\u2019 Association officially announcing a Director of Mental Health and Wellness, Dr. William Parham, who will work with the NBA as the league and union continue to develop their joint mental wellness program. The program will allow players to seek help for mental health issues outside the purview of their individual teams , and will work alongside Keyon Dooling, who has been working with players seeking help as a Player Wellness Counselor, and who will report to Parham. Parham, currently a professor at Loyola Marymount University, started his career working extensively with student-athletes at UCLA before becoming a consulting psychologist for the Lakers. He\u2019s also worked in the NBA\u2019s and NFL\u2019s respective Rookie Transition Programs. 3) Exactly.  4) I think Steve Clifford will get the Magic to play better defense. But, I thought Frank Vogel would get the Magic to play better defense. And I thought Scott Skiles would get the Magic to play better defense. So maybe I\u2019m not the person to ask about who can get the Magic to play better defense.  1) We all want to use replay to get the call right. I get that. But block\/charge is so difficult to get right, such a subjective call, so explosively divisive depending on your point of view\/team for which you\u2019re rooting, that using replay to adjudicate it does nothing but inflame passions further. We saw this exemplified in Game 1 of the Finals, when the refs and the Replay Center ultimately got the call right, it says here, on LeBron James\u2019s blocking foul against Kevin Durant. But even though everyone did the right thing according to the rule book, the dissatisfaction with using replay to reverse the initial call at such a critical juncture is real. In this one instance \u2014 block\/charge \u2014 I think it\u2019s best to just live with whatever the refs call on the floor in real time. 2) Some day, someone will explain a suit jacket and shorts. I will not listen to the explanation. 3) I have no opinion on this. It\u2019s just incredibly sad. \u2014 Cleveland Browns defensive back Damarious Randall ( @RandallTime ), Monday, 11:58 p.m., soon after the Warriors advanced to the NBA Finals with their Game 7 Western Conference finals win over Houston. As of midnight Sunday, Randall\u2019s Tweet had been retweeted 1,162,827 times. A Randall Browns jersey on nflshop.com retails for $99.99; if we don\u2019t round up, that would put Randall out a cool $116,271,071.13 if he bought everyone who asked a new jersey. \u201cHe stresses the same thing to me as he stresses to (the media). There is no news. He says he wants to be a Spur and retire there. He said that to you. He\u2019s expressed that. When I talked to him, he says he\u2019s been with us, he\u2019s always on board with us and (wanted) to be a part of what we did, and he\u2019s trying to get right. But things may change.\u201d \u2014 Danny Green , to the San Antonio Express-News , elaborating on his statement after the Spurs\u2019 season ended that Kawhi Leonard told him he wanted to return to the Spurs next season. \u201cI definitely know this is ending. I don\u2019t need any reminders. The narrative is, \u2018this will go on forever.\u2019 On the record, it can\u2019t. Nothing does, especially in a sport where the competition is so great.\u201d \u2014 Warriors General Manager Bob Myers, on the challenge of keeping his team at the top of the heap as teams like Houston and Boston build formidable challengers. \u201cIt\u2019s a gift and a curse. You play on his team, you\u2019re playing with the best player in the world and you get to witness some great, historic things, be a part of it. And then the other side, if you don\u2019t help that person win, they\u2019re looking at you, too. It\u2019s a lot of pressure, depending on how you look at it. But I get to, I tell him all the time \u2014 he gets an opportunity to play with me as well.\u201d \u2014 J.R. Smith , on Saturday, as only J.R.

No, Curry was three-much , for this game, perhaps this series. His love affair with the shot, a match made in hoops heaven, was the picture of beauty for the Warriors (and devastation for the Cavs) in a 122-103 Game 2 win by Golden State. Drop, drop, drop, falling like maple leafs in autumn, taken from different angles, some circus-like, those shots multiplied and avalanched the Cavs, who stuck around all night before finally caving to Curry. He made nine buckets from deep, erasing Ray Allen from the record books for a single-game Finals total, and they were the face of the Warriors\u2019 win. They came in a neat and timely manner, just when LeBron James and the Cavs showed a heartbeat, only to get stabbed in the chest. And some were downright insane, including the 35-footer he took with a half-turn that seared the nets just as the buzzer blew for the shot clock. What. The. Hell? \u201cWe played 23 1\/2 good seconds of defense,\u201d said Cavs forward Kevin Love, \u201cand he turned around and hit a moon ball.\u201d Curry could only laugh and smile at his pleasure and another team\u2019s pain, soaking up the fun and the hysterical crowd and of course the Golden State lead in the Finals, now 2-0 heading to Cleveland . \u201cI try all sorts of shots at one point or another,\u201d he said. While the Cavs might suspect this was a one-night blast from Curry, the forecast for the rest of this series actually favors him. You see, the difference in this Finals is Curry doesn\u2019t need to burn precious energy on the other end of the floor, guarding Kyrie Irving. There is no Irving. He\u2019s in Boston and Curry\u2019s in a groove. Ordinarily when a player must chase and check someone on Irving\u2019s level, it saps energy and pushes physical limits. Freed from that nightmare, Curry\u2019s legs are fresh and frisky for the fourth quarter, and sure enough, that\u2019s where he did his damage Sunday, going five-for-five in the period. His 17 3-pointers in Game 2 matched the total number of 3-point attempts by LeBron, Love, Kyle Korver and JR Smith combined. What deflated the Cavs wasn\u2019t just the shots he made, but the shots he made with fingers in his face. Those contested buckets can be a mental drain on a defense. What else could the Cavs do but shrug? With Cleveland players running up on him, Curry connected anyway and further built a case for him being the best shooter of this generation. \u201cHe\u2019s a big shot taker, big shot maker, tough shot taker, tough shot maker,\u201d said teammate Draymond Green. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen this before where he completely takes the game over with his scoring ability \u2026 I wouldn\u2019t say I was surprised, but it was like, oh man, he\u2019s really got it going.\u201d Clearly, this is a spirited and sprightly and, dare we add, spicy Curry we\u2019re seeing. One moment in the fourth after the whistle, he found himself near the Cavs bench and chose to answer back to Kendrick Perkins, the official finger-poker of the Cavs. Giving away eight inches to his trash-talking agitator, Curry walked up to Perkins, nose-to-chest, and gave it right back. When the shot\u2019s falling, apparently you believe you can do anything. \u201cHe seemed to hit a big shot whenever we needed one,\u201d said Warriors coach Steve Kerr. \u201cWe feel a lot of joy when he makes them. He was fantastic.\u201d Curry hasn\u2019t always felt this alive in The Finals since this Warriors\u2019 run began in 2014. He\u2019s a two-time Kia MVP who doesn\u2019t own a Finals MVP in three tries. That\u2019s rather unusual, and to see Curry slice up the Cavs on Sunday makes it weird to know he was once owned briefly by \u2026 Matthew Dellavedova? Yes. That happened in 2014-15, his first MVP season, when Irving was done for the series after fracturing his kneecap in the opener. Irving outplayed Curry in that game before limping off the floor. Curry\u2019s Finals numbers were respectable (26 points, 6.3 assists, 38 percent from deep) but off from his great regular season as Andre Iguodala claimed Finals MVP honors. In 2015-16, Curry was even worse (by his standards) against the Cavs at 22.6 points, 3.7 assists and 40 percent shooting . He couldn\u2019t keep the Warriors from blowing a 3-1 lead. In a telling moment during the heat of the action, LeBron scolded Curry, the game\u2019s greatest player essentially letting the first unanimous MVP know he wasn\u2019t up to the task. Curry then was a step-slow on Irving\u2019s Game 7 jumper in the final seconds that sealed the historic comeback. Then last season, Curry\u2019s Finals numbers finally approached his regular season level and he enjoyed a solid series by averaging 26.8 points and eight assists , but Kevin Durant was a beast and took Finals MVP. The other day, when asked about possibly winning the award this time, Curry dismissed the idea: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make or break my career or whatever you want to say, looking back. If we win this championship and I don\u2019t win Finals MVP, I\u2019m going to be smiling just as wide and just as big \u2026 I\u2019m going to play with the right energy to help my team win. Usually when I\u2019m in that mindset, good things happen. Whether that means Finals MVP or not, who cares?\u201d When Curry is executing a give-and-go which ends with him sprinting to the corner and drilling a 3, who can guard that? That play is happening with increased frequency. Sometimes, as in the Houston series , a Warriors player \u2014 in this case, Jordan Bell \u2014 will pass it back between his legs to Curry and then act as a shield. In Game 2, Curry raced to the corner three times, the last when he took a pass and floated a high arching shot over Love\u2019s fingertips and took the foul, getting a four-point play out of it. Curry said the Warriors used that play multiple times this season and it\u2019s only getting some light because of the microscope of the playoffs. Well, it\u2019s catching the Cavs by surprise. \u201cAnytime he has it from the 3-point line, you have to try and make him shoot twos, contested 2s and do the best job from the 3-point line as well,\u201d said Love. \u201cNo matter where you are on the floor, he has a chance to make a miraculous shot.\u201d And they crushed the Cavs\u2019 spirit, as when Cleveland crept within seven points just after the fourth quarter began and Curry counterpunched by drilling a pair of 3s in a 32-second span. Cleveland never made a meaningful run again. This was likely the Warriors\u2019 best effort of the postseason, all things considered. They put on a show and finished strong and left no doubt. Curry scored 33 points, Durant shot 10-for-14 and had 26 points while Thompson shook off a sore ankle and added 20 points. When those three are dangerous simultaneously, there\u2019s probably not a defense the Cavs can muster to save themselves. Plus, Green had eight rebounds and seven assists, making sure the ball moved and found the right people. \u201cI mean, they\u2019re a dangerous ballclub and it starts with those four guys,\u201d said LeBron. \u201cIt\u2019s not something that\u2019s surprising.\u201d Kerr made an adjustment from a tight Game 1 by inserting JaVale McGee in the starting lineup and McGee\u2019s best contribution was catching the ball after being left unchecked. That\u2019s why he shot 6-for-6. And the Warriors just had omens in their favor. When David West hits a 3-pointer for the first time since November, you know it\u2019s your night. LeBron remains a massive factor, obviously, and while his Game 2 performance (29 points and one rebound shy of a triple double) didn\u2019t quite send the same degree of fright into the Warriors as he did three days earlier, they haven\u2019t muzzled him, and may never. He\u2019s averaging 40 points, 10.5 assists and 8. 5 rebounds \u2026 and down 0-2. If Curry\u2019s playing like it, will it matter? He\u2019s averaging 31 points, 8.5 assists and making half his 3-pointers for the series. He\u2019s certainly not invisible. He hurt the Cavs in the fourth quarter and overtime in Game 1, then tortured them with 3s in Game 2. Which means: Curry\u2019s on pace to add a Finals MVP to his two regular season MVPs and a third championship trophy. A few factors are in his favor \u2014 no Kyrie \u2014 and he\u2019s halfway there. Who\u2019s drawing up a defense to prevent that? * * * Veteran NBA writer Shaun Powell has worked for newspapers and other publications for more than 25 years.

Mere mortal LeBron, the guy we saw Sunday night in Game 2, has to worry about a sweep. The Warriors neutralized him without their best LeBron defender, Andre Iguodala, who could make his debut in Game 3 of this series Wednesday night in Cleveland ( 9 ET, ABC ). Iguodala has missed the Warriors\u2019 last six games with a knee injury. That\u2019s a two full weeks away from the action for the 2015 Finals MVP, who earned his hardware in large part because of the work he did defending LeBron in that series . 9 \u2014 Warriors coach Steve Kerr gets the nod for the most significant tweak from Game 1 to 2 after starting JaVale McGee instead of Kevon Looney. The difference in rim rolling and rim running early was clear. McGee\u2019s size and activity in the opening minutes didn\u2019t allow the Cavaliers to get into a comfort zone and limited the opportunities for LeBron to attack the basket the way he did early and often in Game 1. McGee scored the first four points of the game, setting the tone from the start for the Warriors. 8 \u2014 J.R. Smith might as well have worn a Warriors uniform the way the Oracle Arena crowd treated the Game 1 scapegoat Sunday night. All of the Cavaliers were booed during the playing introductions, while Smith was cheered like a two-time Kia MVP. He even received \u201cM-V-P\u201d chants from the crowd at the free throw line in the first quarter. The outcome of this one was never really in doubt, so he didn\u2019t have to worry about remembering the score during crunch time, since Cavaliers coach Tyronn Lue emptied his bench with more than four minutes to play. Smith never got a chance to make up for his Game 1 gaffe. 7 \u2014 When you possess the offensive firepower the Warriors do in former Kia MVPs Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant, it\u2019s easy to forget that the most dangerous catch-and-shoot artist on the team could be All-Star shooting guard Klay Thompson. Instead of waiting until the ball found him, the other \u201cSplash Brother\u201d took matter into his own hands midway through the third quarter by scooping up a loose ball and nailing a transition 3-pointer. That gave Golden State a 72-61 lead to jump-start the offense after halftime. 6 \u2014 Kevin Love has been extremely aggressive offensively through the first two games of this series, taking 38 shots (and 16 3-pointers) . Aggression doesn\u2019t always translate to success. Love has made just four of his 3-pointers, and was 3-for-8 overall on his 3s in Game 2 . He simply hasn\u2019t been the No. 2 threat the Cavaliers need him to be to top the Warriors. He\u2019s shown no lingering effects from his time in the league\u2019s concussion protocol during the conference finals, yet hasn\u2019t regained his shooting stroke \u2014 particularly from long range. His back-to-back 20-point, 10-rebound games have come in vain. 5 \u2014 LeBron is still climbing the charts for playoff points scored with every outing. He passed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar on Sunday for second place on the all-time Finals scoring list. He\u2019s now at 1,327 points, 10 more than Kareem, and trails only Jerry West (1,679). He\u2019s going to make these G.O.A.T. debates very difficult as the points continue to pile up. 4 \u2014 The Warriors\u2019 supporting cast has been critical in this series so far, no one more than Shaun Livingston. He was 4-for-4 in the first half, finishing with eight points, three rebounds and an assist in nine crucial minutes off the bench. Without Iguodala available, it was Livingston who finished the overtime period with the four All-Stars in Game 1. His versatility and ball-handling make him an ideal fit in those situations, even he doesn\u2019t stretch the floor as a shooter. It\u2019s easy to forget just how good a prospect he was earlier in his career \u2014 he was the LA Clippers\u2019 point guard of the future before a horrific knee injury altered the trajectory of his career . Now he\u2019s become one of the league\u2019s great role players and a two-time NBA champion here with the Warriors. 3 \u2014 The Warriors\u2019 magic number this postseason is 25, as in assists. They get 25 or more and they are a perfect 12-0. That should make for an easy talking point during film study for Kerr and his staff. Move the ball and the results will come. 2 \u2014 It sure looked like all of these playoff minutes started to catch up to LeBron in Game 2 (he played 44 Sunday after logging 48 in the overtime loss in Game 1). The days between games couldn\u2019t come at a better time for Mr. 82 Games (for the first time in the regular season in his career). The Cavaliers need to find some time for his to shut it down between now and Thursday night, because Game 3 is a must-win for the Cavaliers if they want to make it back here to the Bay Area for a Game 5. 1 \u2014 Need another reminder that Thompson is the Warriors\u2019 unsung hero during this current dynasty in the making? He\u2019s played in all 100 postseason games they\u2019ve played since 2013, setting the franchise-record for playoff games played during this stretch. * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

LeBron James had another efficient night, but could not score with the volume he did in Game 1, finishing with 29 points, nine rebounds and 13 assists. And once again, he just didn\u2019t get enough support to keep up with the Golden State attack, which had one of its most efficient games of the season. One stat stood out from the rest as the Warriors took a 2-0 series lead, with The Finals heading to Cleveland for Games 3 and 4 on Wednesday and Friday. 66.5 percent \u2014 The Warriors\u2019 effective field goal percentage in Game 2. That is the third highest effective field goal percentage in this postseason , the Warriors\u2019 seventh highest mark of the year (including regular season ), and the second highest mark in the four Finals series between these two teams (trailing only the Cavs\u2019 66.7 percent in Game 4 last year ). Before garbage time set in (and the third string shot 2-for-7), the Warriors\u2019 effective field goal percentage was an even 70 percent. Stephen Curry\u2019s nine 3-pointers in Game 2 are a Finals record for most 3-pointers in a game. They\u2019re also tied for the second most in NBA postseason history (the record is Klay Thompson\u2019s 11 in Game 6 of the 2016 conference finals in Oklahoma City). But the Warriors\u2019 hot shooting night really started inside. On the first possession of the night, McGee looked like he was going to set a screen for Curry, but instead slipped to the basket for an uncontested dunk . The Warriors proceeded to score 15 points on 7-for-7 shooting on their first eight possessions of Game 2, with six of their seven buckets being layups or dunks. They shot 9-for-9 in the restricted area in a 32-point first quarter and 20-for-25 in the restricted area for the game. Curry hit three 3-pointers in the second to help the Warriors build a 13-point, halftime lead. The Cavs\u2019 offense got going in the third quarter, but though they scored 34 points on 23 possessions (1.48 per), the Golden State lead was still 10 going into the fourth. And that\u2019s when Curry really got cooking. He scored 16 of his 33 points in the final period , making all five of his threes, with the highlight being a 28-foot, desperation heave at the shot clock buzzer that brought rain before splashing through the net. The Warriors\u2019 shooting was so good on Sunday, David West made his first 3-pointer since Nov. 4 . That was one of only three corner threes for the defending champs, but they were 12-for-24 on above-the-break threes and 7-for-11 from mid-range. The most efficient Warrior on this night was Kevin Durant, who shot 10-for-14, including 2-for-3 from 3-point range. Durant didn\u2019t let the offense get stagnant (as was the case in the fourth quarter of Game 1) and dished out seven assists. The Warriors are now 12-0 in this postseason when Durant has recorded at least four assists and 2-5 (9-12 including the regular season) when he hasn\u2019t.
