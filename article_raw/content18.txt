We knew Klay Thompson would miss most of the season. But the five-time defending West champs still had (arguably) the league\u2019s most impactful players on each end of the floor, along with an additional All-Star that could give their offense a new element. Then the season started, and the Warriors lost their first two games by a total of 47 points. And in Game 4, with his team trailing the Phoenix Suns by 29 points, Stephen Curry suffered a broken hand that will have him on the shelf for at least three months . So yes, after just two weeks, we can count the Warriors (1-5) out. And while we already know the team \u2013 the Los Angeles Lakers (5-1) \u2013 that will take their playoff spot, there remains a ton of intrigue up and down the West standings, with the Dallas Mavericks (4-2) and Phoenix Suns (4-2) looking like teams that could end their own playoff droughts. The Eastern Conference is a little more academic, though the Miami Heat are already turning some heads.

In this new role, Calder\u00f3n will work closely with NBPA Executive Director Michele Roberts and the NBPA\u2019s senior management team to advise on union strategy as well as on specific issues relevant to current NBA players. He will be the first to serve in this role of Special Assistant, a season-long consulting position created by the NBPA specifically for a recent NBA player. The Special Assistant will help bridge the gap between current players and NBPA staff, giving guidance on the issues faced by players currently in the league and focusing on ways the union can better engage with their members. Calder\u00f3n will hold this position for the 2019-2020 NBA season and will maintain the ability to pursue other business opportunities outside of his role with the union. He will work out of the NBPA\u2019s headquarters in Midtown Manhattan and will travel with NBPA senior management to union team meetings throughout the year. At the end of the season, Calder\u00f3n\u2019s term will come to a close and he will assist with the onboarding of a new Special Assistant for the 2020-2021 NBA season. Calder\u00f3n began his NBA career in 2005, signing with the Toronto Raptors after several years of playing professionally in Europe. The Spanish point guard played for the Raptors for seven seasons before being traded to the Detroit Pistons in 2012. After a year with the Pistons, he went on to play for the Dallas Mavericks, New York Knicks, Los Angeles Lakers, Atlanta Hawks and Cleveland Cavaliers before returning to Detroit in 2019. During his 14-year tenure in the NBA, Calder\u00f3n left his mark on and off the court, leading the league in free throw percentage (2008-2009) and three-point shooting percentage (2012-2013) while also working on global initiatives as an ambassador for UNICEF and as the creator of his own foundation. In addition to his NBA career, Calder\u00f3n has also experienced much success on the international level. Representing his home country of Spain, he participated in numerous FIBA EuroBaskets and World Cups as well as the last four Summer Olympic Games, taking home a total of 11 medals over the last 20 years. \u201cIn this new role, Jos\u00e9 will be an invaluable resource for the NBPA,\u201d said NBPA Executive Director Michele Roberts. \u201cComing straight off of his 14th NBA season, Jos\u00e9 brings a unique perspective to our organization through his understanding of the current issues our players are facing. We are eager to have access to his unparalleled wealth of knowledge and experience.\u201d \u201cAfter all these years of playing, this role checked all the boxes of what I was looking for as a transition from my basketball career,\u201d said Calder\u00f3n. \u201cBeing able to work alongside Michele and the other union departments will be a great opportunity to learn and explore the other side of professional basketball. I\u2019m very excited at the same time to be establishing this new role for other players in the future and to share my views on players\u2019 matters during this upcoming season.\u201d"},{"id":30929,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/things-know-nba-nov-4","date":"2019-11-04","title":"5 NBA things to know for Nov. 4","content":" Get up to speed on the latest NBA news, plus a quick look at stories we\u2019ll be following closely today: 1. Morant vs. Houston, Part I: Here\u2019s hoping tonight\u2019s Rockets-Grizzlies matchup ( 8 ET, League Pass ) provides the fireworks we\u2019re all hoping to see. Grizzlies rookie Ja Morant won\u2019t get to take on his idol, Russell Westbrook, who will miss tonight\u2019s game for rest reasons. However, he\u2019ll get a shot at James Harden and given that Morant wasn\u2019t one to back down from Kyrie Irving last week , this one should be a thrill to watch. 2. Dominant \u2018Dre: If you haven\u2019t noticed, Andre Drummond has been crushing it around the hoop of late. He\u2019s notched a 20-20 game in Detroit\u2019s last three games and has four such games overall this season . There\u2019s a good chance he\u2019s in line for another one tonight ( 7 ET, League Pass ) against Washington, which ranks 25th in opponent second-chance points allowed and rebound percentage . 3. Suns, Sixers provide intrigue: Trivia question: When was the last time the Suns and Sixers both had winning records through the first six games? Yes, it\u2019s been a while. Philadelphia is fresh off a thrilling Saturday night win in Portland, while Phoenix continues to plug along despite having seemingly every reason not to. The squads meet tonight ( 9 ET, League Pass ) and expect to see the starters \u2026 a lot. Both teams rank in the top 10 in ppg that comes from their starters. (Trivia answer: 2013-14, when both teams started 4-2. Philadelphia bottomed out and went 19-63 that season, while Phoenix was 48-34 and nearly made the playoffs.)  4. A different flavor to this showdown: Before the season began, this was looking like a prime young superstar (Zion Williamson) vs. proven superstar (Kyrie Irving) matchup. Fast-forward to tonight and Pelicans-Nets ( 7:30 ET, NBA TV ) has lost some luster with both teams struggling to start the season. Of particular concern for the Nets is its defense, which must prevent so many trips to the foul line . 5. Happy Birthday, Raptors!: They\u2019re the defending NBA champions these days but back on Nov. 4, 1993 , the NBA\u2019s Board of Governors voted to grant the league\u2019s 28th franchise to a Toronto group headed by John Bitlove, Jr. The Raptors would not begin play until two seasons later."},{"id":30931,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/atlanta-hawks-unveil-peachtree-uniforms","date":"2019-11-04","title":"Hawks unveil new 'Peachtree' Nike City Edition uniforms","content":" The Atlanta Hawks have announced plans to officially debut their new Nike City Edition uniform at the Nov. 20 game versus the Milwaukee Bucks.

But don\u2019t worry, because this week\u2019s schedule presents plenty of other intriguing 1-on-1 battles. Here, we take a look at five of them: \u2022 Wednesday, Nov. 6 (10 p.m. ET, ESPN) Last regular season meeting: January 31, 2019 (Editor\u2019s note: Kawhi Leonard will miss the game for load management reasons.) Doesn\u2019t seem like it, but these Kia MVP candidates have matched up on 11 occasions, with Leonard dominating head-to-head to the tune of a regular-season record of 8-3 during his time with the San Antonio Spurs and the Toronto Raptors. This time, Leonard leads a defensive-minded LA Clippers squad with better defenders, such as Patrick Beverley, thus making Antetokounmpo\u2019s task perhaps even more difficult than in years past. Let\u2019s remember that in the playoffs last season, Toronto \u2014 down 2-0 in the Eastern Conference finals \u2014 drastically changed the trajectory of that series by assigning Leonard the responsibility of guarding Antetokounmpo. Leonard slowed down the MVP-to-be, with the Raptors winning the next four games on the way to capturing a title. Antetokounmpo averaged 27 points and 15.5 rebounds while shooting 47.2% in Games 1 and 2 of that series. But the rest of the way, the Greek star averaged 20.5 points and 12.5 rebounds while shooting 43.5%. When you narrow it down to the specific matchup, in Games 3 through 6, Antetokounmpo averaged just 3.5 points and shot 33.3% from the field when Leonard was his primary defender, per NBA Advanced Stats . This is a matchup that could turn out to be the new version of LeBron James vs. Kevin Durant, and you best believe we\u2019re here for it. Head-to-head stats below are via Basketball Reference . 2. Russell Westbrook vs. Ja Morant  \u2022 Monday, Nov. 4 (8 p.m. ET, NBA League Pass) (Editor\u2019s note: Westbrook was later slated to miss the game for rest reasons. The next Morant-Westbrook matchup will come on Jan. 14. ) Morant capped off an incredible first week of his regular-season career by going hard at Brooklyn\u2019s Kyrie Irving, recording 30 points and nine assists on the way to a 134-133 Memphis Grizzlies\u2019 overtime win. The No. 2 pick out of Murray State scored 17 points in the fourth quarter of that outing, and even locked down Irving on a critical isolation situation on the final play of regulation. Morant could also be seen jawing with Irving on occasion in the fourth quarter, before serving up the dime to Jae Crowder for the game-winner . As euphoric an experience as that was for Morant, he\u2019s focusing in on what\u2019s coming to Memphis tonight in former MVP Russell Westbrook, who happens to be Morant\u2019s favorite player. The 6-foot-3 guards are similar, posing freakish athleticism, pure aggressiveness and a genuine ability for ball-distribution. Westbrook likes to post up younger and smaller guards, but Morant is likely ready for the challenge. Asked about this matchup during the Draft process, Morant said it\u2019ll be a game in which your \u201cidol becomes your rival.\u201d \u2022 Friday, Nov. 8 (9 p.m. ET, NBA League Pass) Last regular season meeting: February 8, 2019  Dominant play down low isn\u2019t dead despite the recent small-ball revolution, and this one should be entertaining with Embiid two games back from his suspension for an altercation with another All-Star big man. Individual performances aside, Jokic\u2019s team hasn\u2019t fared well recently in games against the Philadelphia 76ers. Although both of these squads are considered potential contenders in their respective conferences, Jokic has yet to taste victory in a head-to-head matchup against Embiid, who owns a 3-0 record against him. Embiid shot just 4-for-17 the last time these two met, but the 76ers captured the victory despite Jokic logging another one of his trademark triple-doubles (27 points, 10 rebounds, 10 assists). It likely won\u2019t be as physical a matchup as Embiid vs. Karl-Anthony Towns, but there\u2019s certainly a level of intrigue heading into a battle between two All-NBA centers. Head-to-head stats below are via Basketball Reference . 4. Damian Lillard vs. Kyrie Irving  \u2022 Friday, Nov. 8 (10 p.m. ET, NBA League Pass) Last regular season meeting: February 27, 2019 Elite point guards and two of the top three leading scorers in the NBA square off on Friday night. The battle is historically won by Lillard, who enters the week averaging 29.8 points, 5.5 rebounds and 7.8 assists. He owns a record of 6-3 in these head-to-head matchups. Meanwhile, without Kevin Durant in the mix, Irving has asserted himself in Brooklyn, averaging 30.5 points, 6.5 rebounds and 7.5 assists. The pair of talented guards have identical numbers when facing off against each other, scoring 24.9 points apiece. The last head-to-head matchup between these two was also one of the closest, with Lillard outdueling Irving by scoring 33 points (Irving scored 31) to lead Portland past Irving\u2019s former team, the Boston Celtics. The most lopsided outcome between these two came in 2015 when Irving was a Cleveland Cavalier, and poured in 55 points to Lillard\u2019s 14. Head-to-head stats below are via Basketball Reference . 5. Devin Booker vs. Tyler Herro  \u2022 Thursday, Nov. 7 (9 p.m. ET, NBA League Pass) Like Morant and Westbrook, Herro once pointed out Booker as his dream 1-on-1 matchup in the NBA. This clash could see plenty of offensive fireworks, depending on how much on-court time they\u2019ll see matched up together. Herro has been efficient, effective and downright crafty to start his rookie season. His defense is still a work in progress, which Booker might look to exploit. Coming into the league, the 19-year-old Herro was believed to possess similar strengths and weaknesses to the Phoenix Suns guard. Like Booker, Herro is a late lottery pick and a one-and-done from the University of Kentucky. He\u2019s interestingly modeled his game after Booker, and maybe could experience a similar ascension one day. He recently set the Miami Heat franchise record for points off the bench (29) by a rookie against the Atlanta Hawks. Underrated matchup of the week  \u2022 Friday, Nov. 8 (8:30 p.m. ET, NBA League Pass) (Editor\u2019s picks: Mitchell Robinson will not play after suffering a concussion. The Knicks play the Mavericks again on Nov. 14.) Porzingis is likely to be highly motivated to put on a show against his former team, and that includes whatever individual matchup is in front of him. He appears to be winding into form quickly after missing all of last season recovering from a torn ACL, and he\u2019s starting to show some chemistry with reigning Kia Rookie of the Year Luka Doncic. Porzingis\u2019 offensive prowess will certainly be tested against Robinson, one of the league\u2019s most intriguing young players, due to rare fast-twitch explosiveness for a big man. Porzingis entered the week averaging 6.5 attempted 3-pointers per game, but Robinson is one of the league\u2019s best at blocking long-range shots. * * * Michael C.

Coming off a Friday night game in which James and Doncic recorded triple-doubles in a thrilling overtime matchup won by the Lakers , the pair did it again in separate games Sunday.  Doncic posted 29 points, 14 rebounds and 15 assists in the Mavericks\u2019 131-111 crushing of the Cavaliers. With Sunday\u2019s performance, Doncic became the first player in NBA history to record at least 29 points, 15 assists and 13 rebounds in back-to-back games. In Friday\u2019s losing effort, he put up 31 points, 13 rebounds and a career-high 15 assists. Doncic, 20, also became the youngest player in NBA history to log consecutive 25-point triple-doubles, per Elias Stats Bureau. Doncic needed the second-fewest number of games in NBA history to record his first streak of 25-point triple-doubles (his 78th career NBA game). Only Oscar Robertson \u2014 who accomplished the feat in five games \u2014 did it sooner. He joins legend Jason Kidd as only the second player in Mavericks history to have back-to-back 15-assist games. For his part, LeBron had 21 points, 13 assists and 11 rebounds to become the first Laker to record back-to-back triple-doubles since Lamar Odom in 2006. Led by LeBron and Anthony Davis, the Lakers got past the Spurs 103-96 . With two steals, LeBron moved up to 15th on the all-time steals list with 1,945. In Friday\u2019s game, the future Hall-of-Famer recorded 39 points, 12 rebounds, 16 assists and four steals. He was the first Laker to clear the 30-10-15 mark since Magic Johnson in 1990. It was James\u2019 82nd career triple-double, and 30th with at least 30 points. Sunday\u2019s triple-double was the 83rd of his career, now in his 17th season."},{"id":30930,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/gregg-popovich-letter-john-carlos-us-olympic-hall-fame","date":"2019-11-03","title":"Gregg Popovich congratulates American sprinter John Carlos before Hall of Fame induction","content":"SAN ANTONIO \u2014 San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich shared a portion of the contents of a congratulatory note sent recently to American sprinter John Carlos, who will be inducted Friday along with Tommie Smith into the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Hall of Fame . Carlos and Smith will be inducted into the Hall more than 50 years after raising their fists in protest of racism at the 1968 Olympic games in Mexico City. \u201cI actually used the word \u2018long overdue\u2019,\u201d Popovich said he wrote in the note. \u201cThen I gave him a little bit of crap on the side. But to see it just brought a great smile, not just to my face, but our coaches and the players who were here when he came in and talked to him. He\u2019s a special guy.\u201d Carlos and Smith created one of the most enduring images of the civil rights movement with their silent protest at the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City. The moment resulted in a national firestorm after Smith and Carlos bowed their heads and raised black-gloved fists on the medal stand after they captured first and third, respectively, in the 200-meter final. Carlos visited the Spurs back in 2015 to share his story with the team. \u201cI communicated to Dr. John [Carlos] because he has been kind enough to come in and talk to our team in the past, and we have kept up a pretty good relationship,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cHe\u2019s somebody who has suffered a great deal, and it just seems like it always takes those kinds of acts that he and Tommie Smith participated in to make social activism get to the point where something actually happens because people who are in their comfortable positions \u2014 white people \u2014 don\u2019t really get it.\u201d Carlos\u2019 and Smith\u2019s protest came with harsh repercussions, as the two received death threats and widespread condemnation from the public back home in America. The U.S. track and field team suspended both and sent them home from the Olympics. They were vilified for several years, and experienced homelessness and unemployment as a result of their protest at the Olympics. \u201cIt\u2019s always, \u2018In time, it will come,\u2019 \u201d Popovich added. \u201cAnd they have no feeling for what a person of color experiences on a minute-to-minute basis; not just physically but psychologically, opportunity-wise, all that sort of thing. So, for them to do what they did, knowing full-well, being intelligent people, that it was going to limit their opportunities for the rest of their lives probably, and they did it anyway \u2026 that\u2019s huge. That\u2019s like a Muhammad Ali moment, what they did.

If the start of the 2019-20 campaign is any indication, he might be better than ever. The 6-foot-11 big man, who has played his entire career in Detroit, is the modern-day poster boy for the 20-point, 20-rebound performance. He punctuated that dominance on Saturday in the Pistons\u2019 113-109 win over Detroit, amassing 25 points, 20 rebounds, six assists, five blocks and three steals \u2014 regular-season numbers not seen since Hakeem Olajuwon produced them in 1989 . The performance also marked Drummond\u2019s third straight 20-20 game, and fourth in the first seven games of this season. His 131 total rebounds in that span are the most through the season\u2019s first seven games since\u2026 himself in 2015-16. Dennis Rodman is the only player to snare more boards over the season\u2019s first seven games since 1974. Drummond\u2019s dominance on the glass is hardly a new revelation.

After trailing the Phoenix Suns at home by more than 30 before halftime on Wednesday, Golden State saw Curry exit the game with an apparent left wrist injury. Shortly thereafter came word that Curry had suffered a broken left hand. He had a CT scan on Thursday, and the Warriors announced the recovery timetable on Friday. The two-time Kia MVP initially came up grimacing after being sandwiched between two Suns defenders on a drive to the rim. Curry drove to his left defended by Kelly Oubre Jr. and with big man Aron Baynes standing solidly in the paint. Curry leapt with the ball then came down head first landing hard and awkwardly on his hands to brace himself from the court, with Baynes crashing onto Curry\u2019s left hand. Curry grimaced in pain grabbing at his fingers then walked to the locker room with 8:31 left in the third quarter. Curry did not attempt his two free throws, and instead went immediately to the locker room for further evaluation. The Warriors guard finished the game with nine points, six assists and five rebounds in 21 minutes of action. \u201cAron Baynes came up after the game and just wanted to know how Steph was doing,\u201d Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. \u201cYou could tell he felt really bad. It\u2019s just a random basketball play, so stuff happens.\u201d Curry had started the game hot, scoring seven points in the first three minutes. Then Phoenix ripped off an incredible 30-1 run, further emphasizing the defensive struggles with which Golden State has started the season. The Suns wound up winning 121-110 , Golden State\u2019s third double-digit loss in less than a week. Now the Warriors face an even crueler road than when the season began. With Kevin Durant now in Brooklyn and Klay Thompson recovering from a torn ACL, Golden State had already lost half its usual All-Star cast. The burden fell on Curry and Draymond Green to lead a team of newcomers, rookies and former G League standouts through a brutal Western Conference. The Warriors trailed 72-46 at halftime Wednesday after falling behind 70-37 at the break in Oklahoma City on Sunday. If Curry does indeed miss extended time, that burden now shifts to Green and D\u2019Angelo Russell to carry a franchise that seemed all but unbeatable until this year\u2019s rash of injuries. \u201cOf course it hurts knowing that Steph Curry\u2019s down,\u201d said rookie Eric Paschall, who made his first career start and scored a team-high 20 points. \u201c\u2026 That\u2019s a very, very valuable piece of our team but I feel like we\u2019re going to stay positive.\u201d Information from The Associated Press was used in this report.

Now, both Splash Brothers are on the sidelines, leaving Golden State thin in the backcourt while facing a 1-3 record and just trying to stay in games. Klay Thompson is recovering from surgery July 2 for a torn ACL in his left knee that he injured June 13 in Game 6 of the NBA Finals that won Toronto its first championship. Before Friday night\u2019s game against San Antonio, Warriors coach Steve Kerr acknowledged his team\u2019s incredible injury misfortune, dating back to the Finals last spring when star forward Kevin Durant was lost to a ruptured Achilles tendon shortly before Thompson went down. However, Kerr also stressed he didn\u2019t want his players dwelling on the negative with so much season still ahead. \u201cIt\u2019s just insane what\u2019s happened,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve had a lot of good fortune here too over the years. So we don\u2019t spend too much time thinking about what it all means. We just push forward and try to do our jobs.\u201d Curry underwent surgery Friday on the hand and second metacarpal of his index finger, and the team said he will miss at least three months but is expected to make a full recovery. The Warriors announced Curry had undergone surgery Friday morning performed by Dr. Steven Shin at the Cedars-Sinai Kerlan-Jobe Institute in Los Angeles. An update on his progress is planned after three months, which would be early February. If he makes that timeline or close to it that would give Curry about 30 games remaining in the regular season. He has indicated he wants to play for the U.S. team at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, so Curry likely would prefer to play games before that. Specialists examined a CT scan Curry had Thursday, a day after the two-time MVP broke his non-shooting hand in the third quarter of a 121-110 home loss to the Phoenix Suns. Kerr had planned to spend Thursday meeting with his coaching staff to prepare for how to move forward playing another man down. He referenced Spurs coach Gregg Popovich, who Kerr played under during his own career, as a leader who knew how to put seemingly disastrous situations into perspective for his players. In his own pregame media session Friday, Popovich was asked about the coaching challenge facing Kerr in light of Curry\u2019s injury, and Popovich predicted his former player wouldn\u2019t coach the Warriors any differently. \u201cIt\u2019s not like he flips the script and teaches them something different,\u201d the Spurs coach said. \u201cSame fundamentals on both ends of the court. Whoever\u2019s here next year will benefit from the teaching and competitiveness this year. \u201cThey won\u2019t miss a beat. They\u2019ll just go on. Chances are they won\u2019t be in the Finals, but that\u2019s not the point.\u201d The Warriors, who follow Friday\u2019s game by hosting Charlotte on Saturday, are also missing forward Kevon Looney. He went into the weekend having missed four straight games because of a right hamstring injury and is scheduled to be evaluated early next week by a team of specialists because of an \u201con-going presence of a neuropathic condition in his body, which has a direct correlation to his recent injury.\u201d Looney is limited to controlled workouts with the training staff for now. Curry was injured while driving to his left while defended by Kelly Oubre Jr. and with big man Aron Baynes standing in the paint. Curry leapt with the ball then came down head first, landing awkwardly on his hands as he tried to brace himself. Baynes then landed on Curry\u2019s left hand. The 31-year-old Curry grimaced in pain, grabbing at his fingers then walking to the locker room. * * * More on NBA.com \u2013 LeBron, NBA react to Curry\u2019s injury \u2013 Time for injured Warriors to face reality \u2013 13 takeaways from NBA Roster Survey"},{"id":30966,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/early-sixth-man-year-contenders","date":"2019-11-01","title":"6 early Kia Sixth Man of Year contenders","content":" In addition to Detroit\u2019s Derrick Rose , here are six more early candidates for Kia Sixth Man of the Year , each valuable in his impact so far off the bench: 1. Lou Williams, LA Clippers: This elusive combo guard officially has been the NBA\u2019s top Sixth Man the past two seasons , making it three wins in the past five. One more would break his tie with Jamal Crawford and, heck, make a case for naming the award after Williams once he retires. He entered the weekend averaging 20.2 points, 3.2 rebounds and 5.2 assists. 2. Montrezl Harrell, LA Clippers: Harrell finished third in Sixth Man balloting last spring behind Williams and the Indiana Pacers\u2019 Domantas Sabonis. The danger is that he and Williams might split votes, but Harrell\u2019s case is strong: 19.3 ppg and 5.5 rebounds, while shooting 74.2 percent so far. 3. Dennis Schroder, Oklahoma City Thunder: Even with Chris Paul and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander on board, Oklahoma City has found minutes for Schroder that the seventh-year guard has made productive. He\u2019s been averaging 28.6 minutes off the bench, with 14.6 ppg, 5.4 rpg and 4.4 apg .  4. Goran Dragic, Miami Heat: At 33, the one-time All-Star has been a steadying influence in reserve to Miami\u2019s mostly young starting lineup and its second unit. Coach Erik Spoelstra sized him up for this switch and \u2014 after Dragic scored 19 points in the Heat\u2019s opener \u2014 said: \u201cIt\u2019s right in his wheelhouse. He was aggressive, attacking, getting to the free-throw line, drawing fouls. We\u2019ll continue to build on this.\u201d 5. Spencer Dinwiddie, Brooklyn Nets: Dinwiddie finished fourth in 2019 SMOY balloting after starting just four of his 68 appearances for Brooklyn. He looks fully healed from the torn thumb ligaments that interrupted last season for him, averaging 17.5 points, 2.5 rebounds and 5.5 assists. He\u2019s been hitting only 38.2 percent on his 13.8 field-goal attempts, though. 6. Devonte\u2019 Graham, Charlotte Hornets: Graham \u2014 at 16.4 ppg and 7.6 apg and 17-for-33 on 3-pointers to date \u2014 has been more productive than big-ticket free-agent addition Terry Rozier. The two might find themselves paired in the Charlotte backcourt at times, though the second-year Graham is likely to remain a reserve. * * * More on NBA.com \u2013 If only Derrick Rose had load management \u2013 13 takeaways from NBA Roster Survey \u2013 Kia Rookie Ladder: Week 1 \u2013 Time for injured Warriors to face reality * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

They knew, and you knew, and they knew you knew, that the five-year thrill ride had reached the station. Yet the Warriors couldn\u2019t exactly speak truth to power because, well, that\u2019d be kinda-sorta breaking the competition code that says you must ignore the grim warning signs (even when those signs are more in your face than Draymond Green in a bad mood). But now? Today it\u2019s safe for them to come out, shout it out and get it off their chest and conscious. They may even feel better about it. The same basketball gods that have been so kind to Golden State this decade just issued it a punishment and a pass the other night. Stephen Curry\u2019s broken left hand is the excuse the Warriors need to concede that, indeed, this is a Gap Year and it\u2019s time to plan and build around 2020-21. They can officially play that card and nobody will blame them, not even those fans who paid roughly a trust fund for those nice seats at the new Chase Center . Here\u2019s what the Warriors need to do, should do, must do: Preserve Curry and Klay Thompson as much as possible \u2014 even if that means shelving them for the year \u2014 and pour Draymond a glass of wine after every game because he\u2019ll need it. This is the right course of action, even if that\u2019s a gut-punch for a franchise drunk on success and spoiled by five straight Finals trips . Yes, it\u2019s Nov. 1 and it\u2019s already time to think about next November for the team that won three of the last five NBA titles. Time to envision a retooled Warriors\u2019 team with a healthy Curry, a healed and restless Thompson, a smoldering Draymond, a possible NBA-ready teenager fresh from the Draft lottery and whomever D\u2019Angelo Russell fetches in a trade. It might be enough to make the two Los Angeles teams pause from their death match and take notice. This of course means the Warriors are running the risk of uttering the four-letter T-word that the basketball purists abhor. Well, if you stank, you must tank, and the Warriors without the Splash Brothers are all but guaranteed to reek, even in their new home that still has that new-home aroma. Even with Curry and an abbreviated season from Thompson, the Warriors would\u2019ve scuffled to make the 2020 playoffs in their first season after Kevin Durant. Yes, they\u2019re proud and all that, and you can never underestimate the heart of a champion. Yet this season in the West could belong to LeBron James or Kawhi Leonard \u2014 whomever survives that turf battle. Even in a best-case scenario, the Warriors were a one-(round) and-done in the playoffs. Their first-round pick in 2020 belongs to the Nets if it falls outside the top 20. By understanding if not embracing the reality of the moment , the Warriors can keep their future Hall of Fame backcourt healthy and also maintain their pick (which is likely to fall in the lottery). This team has a history of making wise Draft decisions. This presents a delicious twist: Do you know how hard it is for a team with great players to add a lottery pick? It rarely happens. This is somewhat similar to, though not exactly like, the 1996-97 San Antonio Spurs. They were fresh off 59- and 62-win seasons, but back and foot injuries limited former MVP winner David Robinson to six games that season . When the Spurs started 3-15, then-general manager Gregg Popovich fired and took over for coach Bob Hill. With Robinson put on ice by Christmas , the Spurs went 20-62. They stunned the NBA world in winning the Draft lottery, snagging Tim Duncan and haven\u2019t had a losing season or missed the playoffs since. Coincidentally, the Warriors\u2019 first game without Curry will be Friday against the Spurs ( 10:30 ET, League Pass ), who are now stretching their legacy into a third decade. But that \u201996-97 season hasn\u2019t been forgotten by those still attached to the organization, such as former Spurs legend and current TV analyst Sean Elliott . That season, he was limited to 39 games because of injury. \u201cDavid was such a focal part of the club, that everything we did was predicated on him,\u201d Elliott said. \u201cWhen you lose him, you just can\u2019t plug in another David. It\u2019s partly going to be a little of that without Steph Curry. He\u2019s so much a part of their offense that you can\u2019t replicate that.\u201d With Duncan looming as the game-changing No. 1 pick, the tanking accusations were flying \u2014 and not just in the direction of the Spurs, but others as well. The Boston Celtics held better odds of winning the lottery yet whiffed. Had they won, Rick Pitino might still be coaching in Boston, as Popovich is in San Antonio. Elliott said the T-word was never spoken of in the locker room. \u201cGuys were playing hard,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that we were tanking games. It\u2019s just that everybody had more than what we had.\u201d Popovich has advice for Steve Kerr, his friend and former protege, as the Warriors coach braces for the inevitable. \u201cYou don\u2019t have time to react to losing players,\u201d said Popovich. \u201cYou continue to develop the young kids, play the way you need to play to win games but also to teach because they\u2019re going to be there next year, for the most part. And the players who were hurt are going to come back. You can\u2019t just stagnate. You don\u2019t miss a beat. You just keep going.\u201d Kerr has nine new players, most of whom are a work in progress and none bring the championship chops necessary to extend a dynasty. The Warriors\u2019 dynasty likely died when Durant bailed to Brooklyn last summer. Before Curry\u2019s injury, Golden State was trying to merely stay in the playoff conversation this season (and maybe pull a surprise if Thompson returned in early spring). With Curry and Thompson both out for an extended period, the Warriors will likely be buried by then. The blueprint has been hastily rewritten with Jordan Poole and Willie Cauley-Stein and Glenn Robinson III doing heavy lifting. That\u2019s the core right now. And so, why bother playing for today when tomorrow means so much more?  They\u2019ll need to make a decision at some point on Russell, who\u2019s off to a shaky start and won\u2019t have the security blanket of Curry for a chunk of the season at the very least. Do they shop him at the trade deadline? Is he worth more to them in another uniform? It\u2019s always a hard swallow for teams when forced to make a sudden shift in philosophy and not for the better. It\u2019s about lowering expectations (that weren\u2019t steep to begin with) while watching those championship trophies start to gather dust and wondering what the pavement feels like before the fall. The tickets at Chase Center have already been sold and those fans aren\u2019t unrealistic. There\u2019s no need for the Warriors to apologize for the long nights coming their way. They can blame circumstances beyond their control. In certain, dire situations, even teams that don\u2019t try to lose end up losing anyway. This league is about talent. And the once-loaded Warriors, shockingly and suddenly, after five fruitful seasons of living in a make-believe bubble loaded with champagne and championships, are about to learn how the other half lives. * * * More on NBA.com \u2013 Curry out at least 3 months \u2013 LeBron, NBA react to Curry\u2019s injury \u2013 13 takeaways from NBA Roster Survey \u2013 6 early candidates for Kia Sixth Man * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

Think how much modern orthopedic and training techniques might have helped Bobby Orr, Joe Namath or Gale Sayers. Now picture Derrick Rose in the era of load management. The term that\u2019s all the rage in the NBA these days \u2014 and the source of some controversy, for sitting out healthy players as a means of injury prevention \u2014 didn\u2019t require medical breakthroughs achieved over decades. Load management is simply an approach, a self-discipline by teams in rationing out a player\u2019s usage to maximize his availability by, er, limiting his availability. Rose, alas, arrived six or seven years too soon to benefit from it. Load management didn\u2019t exist as a league-wide trend when he suffered in April 2012 the ACL blowout to his left knee that forever altered his NBA trajectory. \u201cAll the time in Chicago when I was coming back, load management wasn\u2019t a term then,\u201d Rose told NBA.com this week. \u201cBack then, it was, \u2018He\u2019s [expletive] being lazy.\u2019\u201d There were no healthy DNPs back then. Very few at all until San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich began to force the issue with veteran stars Tim Duncan, Manu Ginobili and Tony Parker. The idea spread to those overseeing others such as LeBron James, Joel Embiid and Anthony Davis. Over time, getting random games off became almost a status symbol, signifying membership among the NBA\u2019s elite. Kawhi Leonard\u2019s trade to Toronto heightened the tactic\u2019s profile as the Raptors chased and won the 2019 NBA Finals . Though Leonard sat out 22 games last season, he still was named to the All-NBA second team and finished ninth in MVP balloting. By contrast, when Rose missed 16 games in 2015-16, his final season with the Bulls, the onus still was on him: damaged goods. For the fourth year in a row. \u201cThey expect [you to miss games] now,\u201d Rose said. \u201cThey know, \u2018OK, he\u2019s not going to get through the year [playing 82]. But as long as we get to the playoffs, that\u2019s when we need him.\u2019 It\u2019s funny how things change.\u201d Rose at 22 had become the NBA\u2019s youngest MVP in 2010-11. The next season, in the hurried-up, lockout-shortened schedule, he missed 27 of 66 games, coping with five separate injuries. Then late in Game 1 of the playoffs, he blew out his knee in the first round against Philadelphia. Even the NBA\u2019s view of ACL reconstruction and recovery has changed since then. Players like Golden State\u2019s Klay Thompson essentially are told \u201cSee you in a year,\u201d with anything quicker than that viewed as a bonus. Rose\u2019s timeline was pegged initially at 8-to-10 months, which translated into pressure on him to return in 2012-13. When that didn\u2019t happen, some fans, media folks and even friends inside the Bulls organization began to question his toughness and drive. Interestingly, Rose this week mentioned NFL running back Adrian Peterson as another factor influencing the perception of his rehab. Peterson tore the ACL and MCL in his left knee in December 2011. But he was back in the Minnesota Vikings\u2019 lineup in Week 1 of 2012. He played in all 16 games, rushed for a league-best 2,097 yards and was chosen the NFL\u2019s Most Valuable Player. And here was Rose, taking 17 months between appearances for the Bulls. So what if it was an apples vs. oranges comparison. \u201cEverybody was taking football and kind of translating that over to what was going on with me,\u201d Rose said. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, that\u2019s a helluva accomplishment. But it\u2019s crazy that people tried to compare us.\u201d Fortunately, Rose can look back on his career-altering injury \u2014 and a series of meniscus tears and other ailments in its wake \u2014 from a happier vantage point than, say, Brandon Roy, Jay Williams, Penny Hardaway or Yao Ming. He\u2019s been active, happy, healthy and productive for the Detroit Pistons through their first five games, showing flashes of \u2014 if not his best self \u2014 his steadier, more reliable style arrived at in recent years. Heading into an always anticipated return to Chicago\u2019s United Center Friday, Rose has averaged 20.4 points and 6.2 assists while shooting 55.3 percent off the Pistons\u2019 bench. He had 16 points and 10 assists at Toronto Wednesday, playing less than 21 minutes. And that\u2019s been the key. Whether getting 18 and 10 in the opener, scoring 27 and 31 in Detroit\u2019s next two games or attacking for the winning layup against Indiana Monday, Rose has yet to play as much as 27 minutes. This is load management as minutes restriction, managed nightly. Rose is playing less but more often. \u201cI got to watch his minutes,\u201d Casey told Detroit reporters. \u201cI try to keep his minutes around 27, 28. That limits us to what we can do with him. \u2026 If it\u2019s tight or close, we may fudge the numbers a little bit, but for the most part, we\u2019re going to keep it around that number each and every night.\u201d Casey also said: \u201cI\u2019m not going to sit here and ramp up and ruin a guy\u2019s comeback career by getting excited and playing him 30 minutes and losing him for two or three games.\u201d It\u2019s worth noting, for perspective, how Rose has done \u2014 really \u2014 since his notorious injury. Coming into 2019-20, over 267 games in six seasons split between the Bulls, Knicks, Cavaliers and Timberwolves, Rose had averaged 16.6 points, 3.1 rebounds and 4.3 assists. Admittedly, that\u2019s not up to his All-Star, MVP form of his first four seasons (21.0, 3.8, 6.8). But only 15 guards in the NBA matched or bettered Rose\u2019s averages \u2014 16.6, 3.1, 4.3 \u2014 over the same period. In each of those seasons, those stats were reached or topped by anywhere from 12 to 17 guards. \u201cThat\u2019s my ammunition,\u201d Rose said. \u201cI know I\u2019ve been hooping, but everybody wants to go right to my MVP year.\u201d Rose has been a solid, occasionally electric contributor since then, most recently with the Timberwolves. His 50-point throwback performance on Halloween 2018 was one of the season\u2019s feel-good moments. Rose had three more games for Minnesota scoring at least 30 points, with another 20 scoring 20-29. After doing that on a veteran\u2019s minimum contract, Rose earned a two-year, $15 million payday from Detroit. Rose said he understood why his drop from great to good might not have played so well had he stayed with the Bulls. \u201cI didn\u2019t fault anybody for that,\u201d he said. \u201cI would want my favorite player, too, to come back and have a crazy year.\u201d The Pistons don\u2019t need that. Casey is glad to have an offensive option to what became overreliance last spring on forward Blake Griffin. The team especially has welcomed that with Griffin out so far with a sore hamstring. In a recent interview on SiriusXM\u2019s NBA Radio, former Bulls and Wolves coach Tom Thibodeau spoke excitedly about Rose. \u201cI think he\u2019ll be phenomenal. To persevere through that, when you\u2019ve had to sit out a year with an injury, that\u2019s a tough deal in itself. But to deal with it three consecutive years, I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m just really proud of him.\u201d Asked what he plays for now, compared to a decade ago, Rose mentioned winning and his three children, in leaving a legacy of not quitting. Money isn\u2019t on the list, he said, after more than $120 million in NBA earnings and massive endorsement deals. \u201cAnd I still want to be great,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s what a lot of people overlook. But that feeling doesn\u2019t go anywhere. I still want to go out there and prove to people I can hoop. I know I\u2019ve been through a lot, but again, me going out and setting an example, I think it helps a lot of people.\u201d Playing Rose off the bench behind Reggie Jackson and even fill-in starter Tim Frazier, Detroit wants to keep the 31-year-old guard healthy and locked into his role. If it holds all season, Rose would have a chance to match what only one other NBA MVP ever has done: Reinventing himself from the league\u2019s best player to its top reserve. \u201cI know who it is \u2014 Bill Walton,\u201d Rose said. The legendary UCLA center and Portland Trail Blazers star won his MVP award in 1978. After being waylaid by chronic foot issues in subsequent seasons, Walton helped Boston off the bench to the 1986 NBA title and was named Sixth Man of the Year. If Lou Williams for whatever reason loosens his grip on the SMOY award, Rose could snag it \u2014 if he\u2019s fulfilled by coming off the bench all season. \u201cYeah, yeah, it\u2019s whatever the team wants,\u201d he said. \u201cWinning takes care of every area. If we win, I could be the second. \u201cMy biggest thing is just trying to push these guys with a certain amount of energy and effort every game. And to teach the young guys, taking on the challenge of being vocal, which will help me. Trying to learn in every area that I can.\u201d * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Kuzma makes his season debut: The Lakers have held down the fort while Kyle Kuzma mends. (And yes, it sure helps to have LeBron James and Anthony Davis in the fold.) Kuzma was out to nurse a stress reaction in his left ankle and he\u2019s not expected to play more than 15 or 20 minutes tonight in Dallas ( 9:30 ET, ESPN ). 2. How about an encore, Mr. Harden?:  The last time we saw him, James Harden was busy giving Wizards fans nightmares with a 59-point performance the day before Halloween. He and the Rockets take on the Nets tonight ( 7 ET, ESPN ). What happened the last time Harden visited Brooklyn? He went off for 58 in the second of consecutive 50-point games . Could he repeat that feat one year later? 3. Big one looms for Bucks: Milwaukee was a trendy pick to not only win the East this season, but get off to a hot start as well. Yet the Bucks are squarely at .500 as they visit the Orlando Magic tonight ( 7 ET, League Pass ). A 2-3 mark after tonight might raise the early levels of concern to date about the Bucks. 4. The Steph-less era Warriors begin: The word is out: Stephen Curry will be sidelined at 3 months after having surgery on his broken left hand. That means it will be the D\u2019Angelo Russell and Draymond Green show as the rival Spurs pay a visit ( 10:30 ET, League Pass ). 5. What\u2019s wrong in Sacramento?: The Kings, kind of like the Bucks, had some serious goals for themselves this season. Yet with a loss tonight to the visiting Jazz ( 10 ET, League Pass ), they\u2019ll be 0-6 for the first time since 1990-91. Kings guard De\u2019Aaron Fox is a large part of the struggles, as he\u2019s averaging a career-low 11.6 points per game this season. 6. We love a good anniversary \u2026:  Where would the NBA and its stars of today be without those who came before them? It\u2019s a basketball version of the chicken or the egg quandary. Welp, we\u2019re here to pay homage, not get into semantics. As such, today marks the anniversary of the NBA debuts of Allen Iverson , Steve Nash and Ray Allen .

To Malone, Denver\u2019s effort on defense and in transition were particularly tough to watch. \u201cI\u2019m embarrassed,\u201d Malone said at his postgame news conference, per Andrew Lopez of ESPN.com . \u201cThat was an embarrassing effort defensively. Gave up 37 fast-break points. You can give all the transition defense rules that you want. To me, transition defense boils down to one thing \u2014 effort. Get back. You can tell them. You can lead a horse to water, whatever analogy you want to use. We did not get back.\u201d The Nuggets trailed by as many as 22 points on Thursday and saw their starters get outscored 86-48 as well . The Pelicans\u2019 defensive performance \u2014 particularly against Jokic, the reigning first-team All-NBA center \u2014 helped them end their early-season struggles in which they allowed at least 123 points in each of the first four games. Denver is 3-2 and not quite looking like the Western Conference contender many picked them to be in the preseason. Malone went off on the notion of his team and expectations for them as well. \u201cWe\u2019re a great talk team,\u201d Malone said, per Mike Singer of The Denver Post . \u201cWe can talk before the season starts about all the things we want to accomplish, and we want to be a championship contending team. It\u2019s all (bogus). Don\u2019t tell me about it, show me. And right now we\u2019ve got a lot of guys that aren\u2019t showing me much. And just care. I know you\u2019re going to make a mistake. Just show me that you care.\u201d With 7:53 left in the fourth quarter and the Nuggets down by 19 points, Malone called a timeout. On the next offensive possession after that timeout, Pelicans center Jahlil Okafor got a steal off a bad pass by Jamal Murray and took it in for a layup. From there, Malone went to his bench and immediately replaced four members of his starting lineup and emptied his bench minutes later. \u201cI thought our starting group struggled. I thought they were low energy,\u201d Malone said. \u201cWe were lucky to be down by four at halftime, and they come out and punch us in the mouth to start that third quarter.\u201d Jokic, however, thought the Nuggets\u2019 were simply outworked. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s communication, sometimes it\u2019s effort, sometimes it\u2019s just the turnovers,\u201d Jokic said of the fast-break points, per ESPN. \u201cIt\u2019s not just effort.\u201d Information from The Associated Press was used in this report.

And among 20-plus players taken No. 1 overall , Nunn has a leg up of sorts on them now, too. Nunn scored a career-high 28 points last night in a win against the Atlanta Hawks , giving him 112 total points through his first five NBA games. That\u2019s the highest mark of any undrafted player, surpassing the 105 points Phoenix Suns legend and Hall of Famer Connie Hawkins had to open the 1969-70 season. Nunn became the first player with 100 points in his first five career games since Kevin Durant scored 113 in the 2007-08 season , per ESPN Stats and Information, which also notes that by surpassing the 108-point mark in his first five games, he has gotten off to a better start to the season than the last 26 No. 1 overall Draft picks. The last No. 1 overall pick to amass more than 108 points or more in his first five games was Shaquille O\u2019Neal in 1992-93. O\u2019Neal scored 129 points in that span as a member of the Orlando Magic. To date, Nunn is averaging 22.4 points ( 22nd in the NBA ) while shooting 51.8% overall and 48.4% on 3-pointers while also averaging 2.4 rebounds and 2.6 assists per game. The 6-foot-2 guard from Oakland University in Michigan scored 14 points in the third quarter vs. Atlanta. He began his career with 24 points against Memphis on Oct. 23, and he has kept shooting. He has scored at least 24 points three times in Miami\u2019s first five games. \u201cIt\u2019s surreal a little bit,\u201d Nunn said. \u201d\u2026 All I needed was the opportunity.\u201d A Chicago native, Nunn went undrafted in 2018 and spent his first professional season in the G League with the Santa Cruz Warriors. He was signed by the Heat on April 10 and has impressed both the NBA at large as well as his Heat teammates. \u201cThose guys out of Chicago are real,\u201d Heat guard Jimmy Butler said, per the Miami Herald . \u201cI heard about the kid, I\u2019ve watched film on him, I know what he likes to do as a player. I want him to keep doing that. I always tell people all the time, my job is to help win and to help get guys big pay days. He\u2019s on his way to one.\u201d \u201cHe can shoot it,\u201d Hawks rookie Cam Reddish said. \u201cI have a lot of respect for that guy.\u201d To Nunn, though, this hot start to his NBA career is something he almost expected. \u201cNo surprise to me.

But first, see how Curry himself appears to be in good spirits. * * * More on NBA.com: * Pacers\u2019 Turner suffers ankle sprain * Embiid, Towns tossed after altercation * Rockets, Wizards combine for 317 points * Report: Kuzma to make season debut Friday"},{"id":31014,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/pacers-myles-turner-week-week-ankle","date":"2019-10-31","title":"Pacers' Myles Turner week-to-week with ankle sprain","content":" Indiana Pacers center Myles Turner will be week-to-week after suffering a sprained right ankle Wednesday night vs. the Brooklyn Nets, the team announced today .

It\u2019s a slow process, so I\u2019m grinding.\u201d \u201cHave you completely ruled out the possibility that you can return?\u201d Smith asked. \u201cYes,\u201d Durant said. \u201cNo I don\u2019t plan on [playing this season].\u201d In the interview, Durant also touched on a variety of other topics, including him delving \u2014 once again \u2014 into what led him to leave the Golden State Warriors for the Nets in free agency. \u201cI just felt like I needed a switch,\u201d Durant said. \u201cI felt like a lot of stuff in Golden State had reared its head. It was just going to be the end no matter what, especially for that group. Shaun Livingston was retiring. Andre Iguodala was getting older. Our contracts were going to stifle the team and put us in a hole to get other players. It was just time to kind of separate.\u201d Durant also said his in-season confrontation with teammate Draymond Green made his pending free agency a larger story than he thought it should have been. \u201cI wish that wouldn\u2019t have happened,\u201d Durant said . \u201cEvery day it was about my free agency. Every day was about my disposition as a player \u2014 what I looked like on the bench, what I looked like during the games. It opened up a lot of nonsense that could\u2019ve been avoided.

When news came down that No. 1 pick Zion Williamson would miss 6-8 weeks with a torn meniscus in his right knee, the Kia Rookie of the Year race was officially up for grabs. Williamson, the No. 1 pick who was dominating the preseason and was a clear favorite to win Kia ROY, will miss anywhere from 20-30 games based off the initial timetable. The Pelicans are being cautious with their prized big man, meaning the door is wide open for other rookies to take advantage. So that begs the question: Can Williamson miss 25-30% of the season and still return to claim the top prize? If what we\u2019ve seen so far from the rest of this rookie class is any indication, Zion will have his work cut out for him when he gets back on the court. Here\u2019s how the race looks after the first week. * * * The biggest surprise of the first week has been Kendrick Melvin Nunn, who spent last season in the G League after going undrafted in 2018. The Heat clearly saw something in Nunn, signing the guard to a deal in April, although he wouldn\u2019t see action until Opening Night this season. Nunn burst onto the scene, scoring 24 (one shy of the Heat rookie debut record) in Miami\u2019s 120-101 win over the Grizzlies and hasn\u2019t slowed down since, despite Jimmy Butler\u2019s return to the lineup. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen him look like he\u2019s under stress or pressure,\u201d Spoelstra said of Nunn , who leads all rookies in scoring (21.0 ppg) while shooting 48.6% from the floor. \u201cHe\u2019s an experienced older young player.\u201d For now, the starting job seems to be Nunn\u2019s. Whether he keeps up this hot start will be something to watch, but he\u2019s already winning over fans and his underdog story will only help his case. The Flying Nunn! pic.twitter.com\/oRQEVth17z \u2014 Miami HEAT (@MiamiHEAT) October 28, 2019 The No. 12 pick didn\u2019t take long to make his case for playing time in Charlotte. While GM Mitch Kupchak previously suggested the Kentucky product would spend time in the G League, Washington wasn\u2019t having it. Washington scored 27 points and hit 7 3s in the opener, setting an NBA record for a debut. And he hasn\u2019t showed many signs of slowing. Through five games as a starter, he\u2019s averaging 15.8 points and 7.0 rebounds ( tied for 1st among rookies ) while shooting 54.7% from the field and 52.0% on 3s.

Through five games, Barrett is averaging 18.2 points and 6.4 rebounds while shooting 47.4% from the field and 42.1% from beyond the arc. Barrett\u2019s only issue so far is one that plagued him at Duke: He\u2019s just 11-for-27 (40.7%) from the free-throw line. Coach David Fizdale is experimenting with Barrett at the point, with mixed results so far.

Squaring off against Kyrie Irving, Morant scored 30 points (17 in the 4th) and sealed the win with a block on Irving before setting up the game-winning 3 as the Grizzlies beat the Nets 134-133 in OT . Morant is averaging 17.5 points and 5.0 assists through four games, but he\u2019ll have to cut down on his 5.0 turnovers per game. Still, Morant\u2019s flashes of brilliance in a big matchup earn him a top 5 spot on the first Ladder. \u1d0a\u1d00 \u0280\u1d1c\u029f\u1d07\ua731 in the \u24c2\ufe0f \u270517 points in clutch time \u274cBlock to send the game into OT \u23f3Became 1 of 3 players in NBA history to have a 30+ point 9+ ast night within his first 3 games.

The No. 9 pick has started all four games for the 1-3 Wizards, averaging 18.0 points and 7.0 rebounds (tied for 1st among rookies) on 46.9% shooting. Coach Scott Brooks is giving the former Gonzaga forward free rein, so he should be a regular on the Ladder. \u201c He\u2019s going to be special in this league. I think he has the potential to be a star,\u201d Isaiah Thomas said of his teammate . \u201cI always tell him he reminds me of Kawhi Leonard when he first came into the league; big body, big hands, midrange game, he knows the game really well.\u201d Coby White, Chicago Bulls White started the season hot, scoring 17 and 25 in the first two games, but hasn\u2019t reached double-digits since, shooting 8-for-31 in the Bulls\u2019 next three games. Still, White has proven to be a capable change-of-pace off the bench and could climb with more playing time. Tyler Herro, Miami Heat Herro has been a key piece to the Heat\u2019s 3-1 start to the season, averaging 16.3 points and 6.3 rebounds while shooting 45.8% from the field (36.8 on 3s). The No. 13 pick, who was tabbed \u201cbest shooter\u201d by his fellow rookies, scored 29 points (exploding for 19 in the 2nd quarter) in Miami\u2019s 112-97 win over the Hawks. DeAndre Hunter, Atlanta Hawks Hunter has started all four games for the Hawks, averaging 9.5 points and 4.3 rebounds in 26.4 minutes per game. This team is clearly built around Trae Young and John Collins at this point, but Hunter is sliding right into his role and his numbers should only rise as he gains experience. Matisse Thybulle, Philadelphia 76ers Thybulle\u2019s numbers on offense won\u2019t wow you, but the No. 20 pick out of Washington makes his money on the defensive end. Through four games, Thybulle has 12 steals ( leading all NBA players ) and 6 blocks, both tops among rookies. He\u2019s had multiple steals in all four games (setting a Sixers rookie record) and two or more blocks in three of the four, even more impressive considering he\u2019s only seeing about 20 minutes per game. * * * ( All stats through Wednesday, Oct. 30 ) Send any questions or comments to my  email  or find me on Twitter  @drewpackham  .

We\u2019re not talking the Ghost Ballers of BIG3 fame or even the Skirvin Hilton Hotel in Oklahoma City, a stop on the circuit that some teams claim is actually haunted . We\u2019re thinking of things that used to be, gone-but-not-forgotten aspects of the league that lurk in the memory, even if they\u2019re never coming back. Here in no particular order are some Halloween hoops hobgoblins that fall somewhere on the scary scale between the chain-rattling Jacob Marley and Casper: 1. Long-gone arenas . Oracle Arena, so recently vacated by the Golden State Warriors, is the latest addition to the NBA\u2019s long list of abandoned homes. Many are gone themselves, though you still can catch a glimpse now and then on Hardwood Classics. There are too many to list, due to NBA teams moving on up to bigger, better digs over time. But a sampling would include the Cow Palace, Cobo Arena, Chicago Stadium, Boston Garden, The Forum, L.A. Sports Arena, Milwaukee\u2019s MECCA, the Salt Palace, McNichols Arena, HemisFair Arena, Market Square, the Summit, the Spectrum, the Omni, the Pyramid, ARCO Arena\/Sleep Train Arena and on and on. 2. Belted shorts . Relegated to the throwback bin, along with the more recent sleeved jerseys. 3. The six-foot lane . Heck, the 12-foot lane. The former was widened in 1951 in response to Minneapolis big man George Mikan\u2019s dominance. Then it was widened again in 1964 to its current 16 feet in hopes of tamping down Wilt Chamberlain\u2019s impact. 4. Commercial air travel . Some things on a used-to-be list inspire nostalgia in those who experienced them and curiosity in those who didn\u2019t. But it\u2019s highly unlikely any former or current players and coaches would swap today\u2019s luxury charter flights for the way the NBA used to travel. Wake-up calls at 5 a.m. for the first flight out. Waiting out delays at the gate with the beat writers and civilians. Seven-footers folding themselves into economy class seating. 5. Obstacle-course schedules . The NBA in recent years has tried to be responsive to players\u2019 performance needs and physical limitations, working to minimize the number of back-to-back games and four-in-five-night stretches. Didn\u2019t used to be that way. Consider the Baltimore Bullets, who in January 1966 were put through these paces: Games in St. Louis, Detroit, back to St. Louis, day off, to Philadelphia, to Boston, home vs. Lakers. A week later, they bounced back and forth between L.A. (Lakers) and San Francisco for four games in four nights, then traveled to New York to face the Knicks for their fifth game in five nights. Baltimore\u2019s record in those 11 games: 2-9. 6. Doubleheaders . Some teams in the NBA\u2019s first few decades would book a Harlem Globetrotters exhibition as the night\u2019s opening attraction. But the biggies were when the Knicks would host at Madison Square Garden a neutral-site game for two other NBA clubs. A lingering memory for some who attended: The thick haze that hung over the arena\u2019s upper reaches, courtesy of the smokers puffing away all evening. 7. Tape-delay. It seems inconceivable in 2019 that an NBA playoff game, never mind a Finals contest, might be shown on anything but live TV. Nope. The league didn\u2019t have much leverage in the late 1970s, before Magic Johnson and Larry Bird arrived to help goose interest and ratings. Networks forced fans to stay up late to watch games that were off before the telecasts tipped off. The practice continued into the \u201880s, with four of six Finals games in 1981 held till 11:30 p.m. ET. Michael Jordan was already creating new fans when the last tape-delayed game, Game 3 of the West finals between the Lakers and Rockets , aired on Friday, May 16, 1986. 8. \u201cIllegal!\u201d That used to be a frequent bellow from the league\u2019s benches, with coaches trying to alert the refs when opposing defenses breached (or didn\u2019t) the complicated illegal defense rules. The NBA purged most of that around the turn of the century by legislating in zone play . 9. Shattered backboards . For a while, it seemed as if backboards were exploding every few weeks in the Association. Darryl (\u201cChocolate Thunder\u201d) Dawkins was the most avid crack-titioner, getting two in 1979. The earliest recorded instance came in 1946, when a Celtics forward named Chuck Connors (later more famous as TV\u2019s \u201cRifleman\u201d) shattered one during warmups . Baltimore\u2019s Gus Johnson is said to have shattered three . Shaquille O\u2019Neal didn\u2019t get the glass but twice got entire support structures, pulling the backboards down to the court in his rookie season. In March 1993 , against Chicago, New Jersey\u2019s Chris Morris dunked and shattered a board without glass falling to the floor . 10. Three to make two . That old free-throw bonus was abolished by 1981-82. It made the game drag, and Jerry Colangelo, then GM of the Suns and the chairman of the NBA\u2019s competition committee, rightly said: \u201cPro players shouldn\u2019t need that extra foul shot.\u201d 11. Phantom franchises . Oooh, pretty scary, kids, when you think of all the teams that are no more. They are rattling around in the mind long after they were supposedly dead and buried. We\u2019re not talking just about the antiquities such as the Indianapolis Olympians, the Washington Capitols or the Toronto Huskies. The spirits of the Seattle SuperSonics, Buffalo Braves, San Diego Clippers and Vancouver Grizzlies still walk the NBA earth. Then there are most of the ABA franchises \u2014 Virginia Squires, Utah Stars, Kentucky Colonels, Spirits of St. Louis \u2014 that died more than 40 years ago before or in the merger .  12. Hand checking . A lot of capable defenders had their effectiveness vaporized overnight when the laying on of hands vs. a ball handler was outlawed in 2004 . The NBA, in case you hadn\u2019t noticed, likes scoring. 13. Injury shenanigans . As silly or frustrating as labels like \u201cDNP-Old\u201d or \u201cload management\u201d seem today, the reporting of injuries real or feigned used to be much less authentic. Before the inactive list, there was \u201cinjured reserve,\u201d to which NBA teams would designate up to two players. Anyone put on that list was sidelined for a minimum of five games, and with smaller roster sizes in effect, it was a handy place to stash guys. So there was a whole lot of tendinitis and plantar fasciitis going on. This practice was snuffed in 2005-06. 14. \u201cPlay on!\u201d Like the force-out ruling, this is a remnant of the days when the referees had and used more discretion in working their games. If a player lost the ball out of bounds but his elbow was knocked by a foe, the force-out meant the ball handler\u2019s team retained possession. \u201cPlay on!\u201d was a frequent order barked by refs when certain contact or violations were deemed minimally intrusive. Heavier scrutiny of the game officials\u2019 performance and, later, video reviews now try to adjudicate everything down to the tip of a fingernail. 15. The 2-3-2 Finals format . This was adopted in 1985 as a reaction to those Lakers-Celtics or Lakers-Sixers championship series, which had the NBA universe crossing the country four or five times in a span of two weeks. Suggestions that the league was being energy-conscious, in terms of jet fuel, were part of it, too. The practice fiddled some with the notion of home-court advantage, although MLB continues to use it for its World Series. With charter flights deployed by all teams, league execs and even some of the media, the NBA changed back to the 2-2-1-1-1 format in 2014 to align with its postseasons\u2019 earlier rounds. 16. Player-coaches . Forty men in NBA history have done it. The first was Ed Sadowski of the Toronto Huskies in the Basketball Association of America precursor to the NBA. Only two men won championships as player-coaches: Baltimore\u2019s Buddy Jeannette in 1948 and Boston\u2019s Bill Russell in 1968 and 1969. The youngest player coach ever was Dave DeBusschere , who took over the Pistons in 1964 at age 24 (not long after ending his second career as an MLB pitcher). The Hawks\u2019 Richie Guerin logged the most games (372) in the role, yet was named Coach of the Year in the one season in the middle when he stopped playing. Legend Lenny Wilkens was a player-coach for two teams, spending three seasons at it in Seattle and one in Portland. And the last player-coach in NBA history was Dave Cowens, who accepted the gig after coach Satch Sanders got fired in 1978-79. None of the players wanted to learn a new system, Cowens said, so \u201cI kind of took one for the team.\u201d The practice died with the arrival of the salary cap in 1984, with NBA brass wary that paying a coaching bonus might enable a team to circumvent the cap. 17. Victory cigars . For obvious reasons. Probably victory vaping, too. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Embiid scored 19 points before he was ejected for fighting with Towns, and the Philadelphia 76ers cruised to a 117-95 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves on Wednesday night for their fourth straight win to begin the season. The Sixers were leading 75-55 midway through the third quarter when Embiid and Towns went at it. The two big men have a history of talking trash to each other. After they got tangled under the basket, Embiid shoved Towns, who answered with a punch that missed as both men fell to the floor. Ben Simmons jumped in and forcefully held Towns down as other players and coaches ran onto the court to separate everyone. \u201cI didn\u2019t throw any punches, so I shouldn\u2019t get suspended,\u201d Embiid said. ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski reported Thursday morning that the Wolves are rejecting the notion that Simmons served as a \u201cpeacemaker\u201d in the incident. After the game, Simmons told reporters that he\u2019s \u201calways got my teammate\u2019s back.\u201d Wojnarowski also reports that NBA executive vice president of basketball operations Kiki VanDeWeghe was in contact with the Sixers\u2019 and Timberwolves\u2019 front offices. Wojnarowski also reported that the Sixers and GM Elton Brand are communicating to the NBA that they believe Towns was the aggressor in the scuffle. Embiid and Towns were tossed after a video review. \u201cWe deemed the altercation a fight. Therefore, by rule, they\u2019re both ejected,\u201d said Mark Ayotte, the officials\u2019 crew chief. \u201cI just saw them each lock arms. And that escalated to the fight.\u201d Embiid shadowboxed to the crowd\u2019s delight on his way back to the locker room. Fans responded with \u201cMVP!\u201d chants. \u201cI was built for this city,\u201d Embiid said. \u201cThe love they have for me, I can\u2019t thank them enough. I appreciate all the love. That reaction was probably the loudest I ever heard them. That\u2019s what the city of Philadelphia is all about. You gotta come in here, you gotta fight, you gotta play hard, you gotta be gritty, you gotta be a Broad Street Bully. We\u2019re gonna keep on fighting and try to accomplish the goal we have set for us.\u201d Towns downplayed the fight. \u201cIt\u2019s a competitive game. As a team, we need to play better with our system. We didn\u2019t execute our game plan,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m disappointed in the (loss). I don\u2019t think we played our game. We were playing a different type of basketball. It wasn\u2019t what got us to 3-0. We can learn a lot from this game.\u201d Embiid said the fight \u201chappened out of nowhere,\u201d but added: \u201cI like to get in people\u2019s mind.\u201d Sixers coach Brett Brown said he\u2019s not concerned that Embiid will receive a suspension. \u201cI don\u2019t see punches being thrown (by Embiid) and I don\u2019t believe he was the instigator,\u201d Brown said.

Warriors await word on Curry: If you somehow missed it, the Warriors\u2019 star exited last night\u2019s game with a broken left hand. He had his CT scan today on the injury and, per multiple reports, official word on how long he\u2019ll be out may be known as soon as Friday. 2. Fallout from the Towns-Embiid scuffle: We\u2019ll be watching to see what kind of suspension\/fines\/etc. come down from last night\u2019s scuffle between the Timberwolves\u2019 Karl-Anthony Towns and the Sixers\u2019 Joel Embiid. Both teams are off to solid starts, but a significant suspension to either or both player could have a considerable impact in the early-season standings. 3. Welcome back, Kawhi:  After missing last night\u2019s road loss to the Utah Jazz , LA Clippers star Kawhi Leonard is expected to suit up tonight as his squad hosts the San Antonio Spurs ( 10:30 ET, NBA League Pass ). As always, it will be worth watching to see how he fares against the team he called home for his first seven seasons. 4. Jimmy vs. the ATL, Part II: In his first game of the 2019-20 season \u2014 and his first game with the Heat \u2014 Jimmy Butler got off to a quick start and never really looked back. Even better (or worse, if you\u2019re a Hawks fan) for him is Atlanta is up on the docket again ( 7 ET, TNT ) tonight. Too bad that Trae Young (ankle) will miss out on this one , though. 5.

Harden\u2019s performance was his third career road game with 55 or more points. Only Michael Jordan (4) and Wilt Chamberlain (55) have had more. The only other active player with three 55-point-plus road games is LeBron James. Elgin Baylor and Kobe Bryant also had three. Bradley Beal\u2019s stellar night for the Wizards was somehow overshadowed: He dropped 46. The last time two players scored 55-plus points and 45-plus in the same regulation game happened on Dec. 14, 1962, when Chamberlain scored 63 and Elgin Baylor had 51. The combined scoring for the two teams was the third-highest total for a non-overtime game in NBA history. As for team scoring, the 159 points for the Rockets set a franchise record. And the 158 points for the Wizards was the second-most in their history. Additionally, Russell Westbrook notched a triple-double for the Rockets, with 17 points, 10 rebounds and 12 assists. According to the Elias Sports Bureau, it\u2019s the first time that teammates scored 55-plus and had a triple-double in the same game since 1992, when Reggie Miller (57) and Pooh Richardson (triple-double) accomplished the feat. Harden had 38 points in the second half \u2014 21 in the third quarter and 17 in the fourth. \u201cThe only way we\u2019ll get to where we want to go is our defensive efforts and it has to be consistent,\u201d Harden said. \u201cRight now we\u2019re not consistent and that\u2019s why we go through tough times like that. That\u2019s what the course of the year is for. We just try and build those habits and continue to keep building.\u201d Harden was 18 of 32 from the field, 6 of 14 from 3-point range, and made 17 of 18 free throws. He also had nine assists in 37 minutes. Information from The Associated Press was used in this report.

The big German accepted the gesture with characteristic humor and humility. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of surreal,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom my first year, the city probably wouldn\u2019t have named a Dumpster after me.\u201d Nowitzki, now 41, retired after last season, his 21st with the franchise. The 14-time All-Star is easily the greatest player in Mavericks history and the highest-scoring foreign-born player in NBA history. The 2007 NBA MVP will forever be beloved around here for helping Dallas win its only championship in 2011 when he was NBA Finals MVP. Nowitzki Way is the former 2900-3000 block of Olive Street south of the American Airlines Center, where Nowitzki played 18 of his NBA-record 21 seasons with only one franchise. The City Council approved the name change in a unanimous vote. Most of the event was moved inside on a cool, windy day. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit bigger than basketball,\u201d Nowitzki said, choking up. \u201cThis is about my relationship with the city. There was a lot of love that I\u2019ve received from this community.\u201d He then noted that there were questions about why the new street was not \u201cDirk Drive or Dirk Way.\u201d \u201cThis is for my family to be represented,\u201d he said. \u201cFirst of all, I never drove much in my career.\u201d Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson spoke of Nowitzki\u2019s civic-mindedness in the city where he arrived as a 20-year-old in 1998. \u201cDirk reached out to me personally to ask what he could do to help our city after the (Oct. 20) tornado\u201d Johnson said. \u201cHe and (Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher) Clayton Kershaw came to our emergency operations center to greet our city employees who had been working around the clock.\u201d Since his retirement in April, Nowitzki has devoted time to his wife and three children, and to the Dirk Nowitzki Foundation, established in 2001. Its mission is the betterment of health and welfare of children and women. The ceremony was attended by former and current Mavericks and all three of his coaches, Don Nelson, Avery Johnson and Rick Carlisle, who brought along a reminder of the greatest highlight for Nowitzki and the Mavericks. The coach wore a \u201cchampagne-soaked\u201d suit that had been in his closet since June 12, 2011, when Dallas won its title. \u201cI felt some day there would be an appropriate time to wear this again,\u201d Carlisle said. \u201cThis is a beautiful day.\u201d Mavericks owner Mark Cuban inherited Nowitzki when he bought the team in 2000. At that time, he heard criticism of the young player. \u201cHe was soft, and slow, and couldn\u2019t really play,\u201d he recalled of those opinions. \u201cTrade calls would come in, and Donnie (Nelson) would be, like, `Nope.

We\u2019re feeling Minnesota: Trivia question for you: When was the last time the Timberwolves started a season 4-0? Another such beginning could be in the cards for reigning West Player of the Week Karl-Anthony Towns and the Wolves tonight against the (similarly) 3-0 Philadelphia 76ers ( 7 ET, League Pass ). This one will be a must-watch if for no other reason than to watch Towns and Joel Embiid show off their rim-protecting skills . (Trivia answer: 2001-02, when Minnesota started 6-0 \u2026 and got swept in the first round of the playoffs by the Mavs.) 2. Trying to gain ground in East: The Nets and Pacers were considered preseason favorites to at least be in the playoff mix. Yet both sport losing records (Brooklyn is 1-2 and the Pacers are 0-3) and things are looking particularly dire for Indiana. The Pacers have one of the NBA\u2019s worst defenses and a loss tonight would be their first 0-4 start since 1988-89 . 3. Contenders collide in Boston: On the flip side of things from the Nets and Pacers are the Bucks and Celtics, who have \u2014 so far \u2014 lived up to expectations. This one ( 7:30 ET, ESPN ) will provide a good test of Boston\u2019s interior defense, while the Bucks are in the middle of the pack in that department to date. 4. A true defense vs. offense matchup:  Kawhi Leonard will miss tonight\u2019s showdown against Utah ( 10:30 ET, ESPN ) for load management reasons. The Jazz have the league\u2019s best Defensive Rating and, among all NBA starters, have the top four players in that category , too. The Clippers aren\u2019t as strong in that department (so far), but have the No. 1-rated offense and lead the NBA in effective field goal percentage and true shooting percentage . 5. Trae will be OK: Hawks star Trae Young, one of the NBA\u2019s top scorers to open the season, suffered a sprained right ankle last night and had to be carried off the court. There\u2019s good news for Atlanta, though. The team announced today that Young didn\u2019t need an MRI and will be listed as day-to-day (although he will miss Atlanta\u2019s next game). 6. Has it been 6 years already?: Like every Kia MVP winner in league lore, Giannis Antetokounmpo had to start his NBA journey somewhere. Today marks the six-year anniversary of his Milwaukee debut, which came at Madison Square Garden. He played 4 minutes off the bench, finishing with 1 point (on 1-for-2 free throw shooting), a rebound and an assist. The Bucks\u2019 starting forwards that game? Khris Middleton and Caron Butler .

It hurt enough the first time. Young left the Hawks\u2019 game against the Miami Heat on Tuesday night after enduring a sprain \u2014 he said it was the first of his life \u2014 in the second quarter. The reigning Eastern Conference player of the week was scheduled for an MRI on Wednesday, but he ended up not needing the extra imaging, according to a report from Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN. Young is ruled out for Thursday\u2019s game and expected to return to the floor next week, the team announced . \u201cIt was painful,\u201d Young said. \u201cKnock on wood, I haven\u2019t had too many injuries. I\u2019ve been blessed not to have too many injuries throughout my whole entire life, so that was definitely a tough pain.\u201d Young was hurt on a drive about 2 minutes into the second quarter. He went into the air and landed on the foot of Miami\u2019s Justise Winslow, twisting his ankle awkwardly. Young was eventually helped to his feet, initially unable to put much weight on that leg, and went to the Hawks locker room for further evaluation. The Hawks quickly diagnosed the sprain and said Young would not return to the game. \u201cThey did X-rays. I don\u2019t think they saw anything,\u201d Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce said. Young entered Tuesday averaging 34 points through Atlanta\u2019s first three games. Young played in 81 of 82 games as a rookie, only sitting out the team\u2019s next-to-last game at Milwaukee. His 11 minutes on Tuesday were a career low, and the five points tied the second-lowest scoring night of his young career.

Davis had 40 points and 20 rebounds in just 30 minutes on Tuesday night in the Lakers\u2019 120-91 blowout win against the Memphis Grizzlies. In logging that performance, he became the sixth Lakers player to notch a 40-20 game. Elgin Baylor, Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, George Mikan and Shaquille O\u2019Neal \u2014 each of them Hall of Famers \u2014 all accomplished the feat with the Lakers. O\u2019Neal was the last to do so when he put up 48 points and 20 rebounds in 39 minutes against the Boston Celtics on March 21, 2003 . \u201cIt\u2019s an honor to be on that list with those legends but more important is we got the win,\u201d Davis said. \u201cIt was a grind in the first half and my teammates trusted me. I just tried to be a monster on the glass.\u201d A big part of Davis getting to that stat line came via free throws, where he shot 26-for-27. For perspective, the Grizzlies attempted 23 free throws as a team in last night\u2019s game. Per Elias Sports Bureau, Davis became the first player in NBA history to record at least 40 points and 20 rebounds in 32 minutes or less. The previous low was held by Baylor, who had 46 points and 22 rebounds in 33 minutes against the Detroit Pistons in 1961 . Davis is also the fourth player in league history and first since Michael Jordan in 1987 to make 26 or more free throws. The all-time record for free throws made in a game is held by Chamberlain. He sank 28 of them en route to his famous 100-point game against the New York Knicks played in Hershey, Pa in 1962. Davis also set an NBA record for most free throws made in a quarter when he sank 18 (out of 18 attempts) in the third quarter . ( Lakers.com\u2019s Rodrigo Azurmendi also points out that Davis was even fouled by players from five different countries \u2014 the United States, Serbia, Brazil, Canada and Lithuania.) Aside from those feats at the free-throw line, Davis also joined O\u2019Neal and Abdul-Jabbar as the third Lakers player with 100 points, 10 blocks and 10 assists through his first four games ( per ESPN ). Davis was questionable two hours before the game due to a right shoulder injury suffered in Sunday\u2019s win over Charlotte. He did some dribbling and shooting on the court before being cleared. He had 16 points and nine rebounds in the first quarter but went back to the locker room at the start of the second to get the shoulder checked and re-taped. Coach Frank Vogel thought he might have to go the rest of the game without Davis until he saw him come back to the bench. After the game, Davis said his shoulder was still, but he thinks it will improve since the Lakers have a couple days off. At 3-1, the Lakers are off to their best start since the 2010-11 season and will play again Friday when they visit the Dallas Mavericks ( 9:30 ET, ESPN ).

Take it away, Alex Trebek! \u201cIn 2001, this 76ers guard became the shortest NBA MVP in history & was the All-Star Game MVP in an Eastern Conference victory.\u201d Perhaps an original Charlotte Hornets fan, Kris incorrectly guessed 5-foot-3 Mugsey Bogues on the $200 board in the Eastern Conference category. The two other \u201cJeopardy\u201d contestants stood in silence as they, much like hapless defenders back in the day, were unable to solve the 6-foot Allen Iverson. https:\/\/twitter.com\/iamsamkeller\/status\/1187872581526921216 Iverson still pops as a pop culture fixture almost as much as the days when he was the cool and controversial All-Star over a Hall of Fame career in Philadelphia . Ten years after he played his final NBA game , Iverson\u2019s crossover appeal still has some mad hops. The Philadelphia watering hole Misconduct Tavern collaborated with brewer Yards Brewing Co. to launch the \u201cPractice-Style IPA,\u201d a 5.5% Iverson-inspired cold one that offers notes of tangerine, grapefruit, pear and tropical fruit. We\u2019re talking about fermentation! And the AI-PA pub crawl can be made in style: Reebok, the sneaker company Iverson has endorsed since his 1996 rookie season, just dropped the $150 \u201cQuestion Mid Double Cross\u201d with a design that pays homage to his first signature sneaker. If the sneaks aren\u2019t enough of a fashion accessory (or collectible) for fans, Iverson can still cup his hand to his ear and get a standing ovation from a packed house at his regular visits to the Wells Fargo Center. \u201cI\u2019m happy in the sense that the people around me make me happy,\u201d Iverson said. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to be happy.\u201d Iverson knows how to spread the love to a generation of players that looked at him as a basketball idol. Iverson took his courtside seat for the season opener wearing not a Joel Embiid or Ben Simmons jersey, but the No. 23 of seldom-used guard Trey Burke. Burke, a 6-foot-3 guard who starred at Michigan, grew up rooting for Iverson when he wanted to \u201crun right outside\u201d to the court and try and pattern part of his game after the four-time scoring champ. \u201cHe was my favorite player growing up,\u201d Burke said. \u201cHe was a little guard doing giant things. I think a little guard like myself can relate to that. You always want to be great at anything you do. Just to see how great he was throughout his entire career, some of the performances he put on, it was just motivation at its finest.\u201d Iverson jerseys were the most popular at games until Embiid and Simmons burst on the scene, but his No. 3 that was once a global bestseller still dots the crowd with fans of all age ranges. Iverson makes appearances on behalf of the Sixers, usually for season-ticket holders, corporate partners and other fan events, and his sneaker store stops to promote his shoe have been greeted by hundreds of fans . Iverson says life is good and settled with his high school sweetheart, Tawanna, and their five kids, and even if it took a bit longer than expected, he\u2019s matured into the elder statesman in retirement that he never found comfort with as a player. \u201cEven still at 44, I\u2019m learning from having the people that\u2019s not good to be around you but you have the knowledge to know they\u2019re not the right people,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m able to see all the stuff that life has taught me as far as how people are, and their intentions, and the ups and downs, and how many times I fall, I\u2019m able to get back up to create just a better man, a better person.\u201d With the 76ers off to 3-0 start headed into Wednesday\u2019s game against Minnesota, they\u2019re set to prove to any remaining doubters it\u2019s more than hollow hype they\u2019re the team to beat in the East. The 76ers haven\u2019t reached the NBA Final since Iverson\u2019s MVP season in 2001 and haven\u2019t won it all since 1983. Iverson led the Sixers in 2000-01 to 56 wins, and they captured the conference title for the first time in 18 years. Led by Embiid and Simmons, this season\u2019s Sixers are expected to be the best one since Iverson was in his heyday. But are they good enough in a dream world to beat Iverson, Dikembe Mutumbo, Aaron McKie and the rest of the \u201901 champs? \u201cThat team that we have right now, is better than our te.. ahh, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Iverson says, laughing as he catches himself mid-compliment, \u201cbecause they would have had to deal with a lot of me.\u201d * * * More on NBA.com: * Q&A: Carter recounts classic duel with Iverson * Davis makes history with 40-20 game * Leonard looking for closure * LeBron eggs on \u2018Taco Tuesday\u2019 chants * Power Rankings: Week 2 edition"},{"id":31042,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/clippers-landry-shamet-jerome-robinson-contracts-extended","date":"2019-10-30","title":"Clippers extend contracts of guards Shamet, Robinson","content":"  LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 The Clippers have extended the contracts of guards Landry Shamet and Jerome Robinson.

That doesn\u2019t make losing any less painful for Kerr, for Stephen Curry, for Draymond Green. Or for anyone who was part of the once-dominant Golden State group that reached five straight NBA Finals. The mistakes are magnified at this early stage, and even Curry has had his share. Not that he takes time to listen to critics at the moment \u2013 he\u2019s focused on bringing this team together fast after a tough start. \u201dEverybody loves to label you when you\u2019re down, that\u2019s easy,\u201d Curry said. \u201d\u2026 Throw darts at a team that\u2019s trying to figure it out based on how much success we\u2019ve had. I hope people decide to see through that and understand what we\u2019re about and what we\u2019re going to build toward.\u201d An up-tempo offense that had become second nature, with players trusting one another to be in the right spots or anticipate teammates\u2019 tendencies, is not yet operating that way. \u201dThat will come with time,\u201d Curry said. \u201dIt\u2019s hard to rush that.\u201d Curry has considered some \u201dglaring\u201d issues already with his new-look team, which won its first game Monday night at New Orleans after beginning 0-2. The Warriors return home to host Phoenix on Wednesday night. The opening losses were truly forgettable. The Warriors were so bad in their 141-122 loss to the Clippers in the opener that fans headed for the exits early, a bad look for the first game at new Chase Center last Thursday. Then, Golden State fell behind 70-37 at halftime in a 120-92 loss at Oklahoma City on Sunday while shooting just 27.5% over the initial two quarters. These Warriors are still going to score their share of points, even without the injured Klay Thompson, but with the addition of D\u2019Angelo Russell. Stopping the other team has been a problem. Green called the defense \u201datrocious\u201d and \u201dpathetic\u201d after the rout by L.A. Kerr considers what happened against the Clippers more the \u201dreality\u201d of the NBA with hard-fought games night in and night out. But for Curry and Co., winning had become the norm with everyone else chasing Golden State. With nine players age 23 or younger, these Warriors are a far cry from what they have been. Gone is two-time NBA Finals MVP Kevin Durant, along with key veterans Andre Iguodala and Shaun Livingston. Thompson is recovering from a July 2 surgery for a torn ACL in his left knee and might miss the entire season. \u201dLosing stinks. It\u2019s no fun,\u201d Kerr said. \u201dThis is more of the reality of the NBA. The last five years we\u2019ve been living in a world that isn\u2019t supposed to exist. Five years basically, record-wise the best stretch anybody has had over five years. This is reality. Nine guys that are 23 and under \u2013 we are starting over in many respects. We\u2019ve got to be patient, we\u2019ve got to fight, continue to teach and the players have to absorb and learn. We\u2019ll get better, I know that.\u201d Curry is challenging all his teammates to attack on each possession until things begin clicking more regularly. \u201dI think we have to err on the side of being more organized and more calculated early in the season and hopefully we can have those (positive) moments,\u201d Curry said, referring to a time when the offense gets flowing and the Warriors pressure the defense. Curry noted it would be easy to just brush off the Clippers loss as one game in a long schedule, the first of 82. He didn\u2019t approach it that way. \u201dIt\u2019s all about perspective. It is not a good feeling at all, especially when you\u2019re opening up in a new building,\u201d Curry said. Shortly after Durant announced his departure to join the Brooklyn Nets, Curry acknowledged this season would be different. Having been on both ends of winning and losing in his first 10 seasons, he is embracing the challenge as the Warriors\u2019 oldest player at age 31. The Warriors are fully aware many have already ruled them out in the powerful Western Conference given all the change. They don\u2019t care. That just adds fuel. \u201dYou don\u2019t just change who you are,\u201d Green said, \u201dWe\u2019ve been pretty \u2026 successful running the offense we\u2019ve run. You don\u2019t just completely change up who you are. You have to adjust to different personnel.\u201d Still, you won\u2019t hear any excuses from Green. That\u2019s not his tell-it-like-it-is style, expletives included. \u201dYou\u2019ve got no choice but to be patient. You can\u2019t really speed the process up. The only thing that really helps with that is experience,\u201d he said. \u201d\u2019I\u2019m not a moral victory type of guy,\u201d he added. \u201dWe\u2019ve got to get better. I\u2019m not a coach, so I\u2019m not about to go watch a film and say \u2018Oh, we can build on this.\u2019 I really don\u2019t give a damn about what we can build on. \u2026 We\u2019ve got to get better overall.\u201d"},{"id":31036,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/raptors-promote-alex-mckechnie-vp","date":"2019-10-29","title":"Raptors reward sports science guru with VP role, extension","content":" TORONTO ( AP ) \u2014 Toronto Raptors sports science guru Alex McKechnie has been given a promotion and contract extension.

I look forward to having that feeling for the rest of my life.\u201d He was the big offseason acquisition for the Heat this past summer, agreeing to a four-year deal in a sign-and-trade with Philadelphia. Last season, he averaged 18.7 points, 5.3 rebounds, four assists and 1.9 steals per game with the Sixers and Wolves, appearing in 55 of his 65 total games with Philly. Additionally, guard Dion Waiters is on the inactive list for Tuesday\u2019s home game, Miami\u2019s fourth contest of the season \u2014 and the fourth that the shooting guard has missed. \u201dHe will work out, he will not be active and then we\u2019ll take it from there,\u201d Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said Tuesday. Waiters was suspended Oct. 19 for conduct detrimental to the team, one day after he expressed displeasure with playing time during Miami\u2019s preseason finale. Heat President Pat Riley said that was \u201dunprofessional,\u201d and noted it was one of multiple incidents that led to the suspension. His suspension officially ended Thursday. The Heat announced because he had been away from the team for nearly a week at that point that he would not travel for the team\u2019s two-game weekend trip to Milwaukee and Minnesota. It was not the start to the season Waiters envisioned. He spent the offseason rehabbing and shedding weight and body fat \u2013 two top priorities of the Heat culture. He arrived at camp wanting to be one of Miami\u2019s starting wings opposite Jimmy Butler, but the emergence of rookies Kendrick Nunn and Tyler Herro appeared to leave Waiters in a fight for a rotation spot. \u201dEnough\u2019s been said about it,\u201d Spoelstra said. \u201dWe\u2019ll take it day by day.\u201d Since the suspension was for one game, Waiters has lost $83,448 of his $12.1 million salary. But he stands to miss out on much more at this rate, since his contract carries a bonus of just over $1 million for appearing in 70 games this season. After not playing Tuesday, the most Waiters could play in this year is 78. Given his recent history, that seems unlikely. Waiters is in his fourth season with the Heat and has never made more than 46 appearances in a year since coming to Miami. Tuesday\u2019s game will be the 250th Heat contest since he joined the club, and the 130th he has missed \u2014 largely because of ankle injuries and surgery on his ankle and foot. Forward James Johnson, who had been sent home from training camp because of conditioning issues, will also be inactive against the Hawks. Waiters has missed 126 of a possible 246 games over the last three years, largely because of ankle injuries and a subsequent surgery on his foot and ankle. Waiters averaged 12.0 points last season in 44 games.

(Editor\u2019s Note: The following 1-on-1 conversation has been condensed and edited). * * * NBA.com : Have Dwyane Wade, Dirk Nowitzki or Kobe Bryant given you any advice for this farewell tour? Vince Carter:  Nah, not yet. I plan on talking to some of my guys when I see them. But honestly, I\u2019m just approaching it as another year. It\u2019s still my job. I can probably honestly say whenever it\u2019s over I\u2019ll be like, \u201cDang, I wish I valued or cherished it more,\u201d but at the same time I am valuing it and cherishing it because I\u2019m doing what I love in the moment. That\u2019s what I love doing. It\u2019s kind of easy to approach it that way just because that\u2019s what I enjoy. Which games are you most looking forward to during this final season? All of my former stops. [Playing] my former teams is going to be fun and exciting. It\u2019ll be more emotions than nerves. I had great memories in every stop that I\u2019ve played at so I think I\u2019ll have appreciation. With all your 1998 draft classmates retired, who are some current players that you have a close relationship with? Kyle Lowry is one of them. Kent Bazemore. Jae Crowder. I know I\u2019m going to forget some people, but those are some of the guys that I talk to the most that are current players. And there\u2019s probably more, I\u2019m gonna hate myself later on. But those are the ones I talk to the most right now where I can think of in the last two, three weeks I\u2019ve spoken to those guys. Speaking of that Draft, take me through that night when you found out you were being traded for your college teammate Antawn Jamison. Literally, [former NBA commissioner David Stern] shook my hand. We took the picture. And he said, \u201cJust stay right here, there\u2019s about to be a trade.\u201d So I\u2019m back there like, damn somebody\u2019s about to get traded . Antawn was sitting at the bottom of the steps. He was trying to tell me that we\u2019re about to get traded, but I was like, \u201cWhat, what, what?\u201d It was so much going on because I was on stage. So when [Stern] said, \u201cThe Toronto Raptors have traded the rights \u2026\u201d I was like, damn that\u2019s what he was saying . In just one word, how would you describe your legendary dunk in the 2000 Olympics over Frederic Weis? Clueless. I didn\u2019t know I had dunked over him the entire game so I was clueless. What was it like going head-to-head against Allen Iverson in that legendary 2001 playoff series? Going against him brought the best out of me. As far as that playoff series, it was probably one of the best in my career. I remember Game 1 just having to be sharp. I knew I had to bring it after obviously playing him in the season. I think he lit us up for 50 a couple times. So I knew what to expect. I didn\u2019t have to be out of character, but I had to play well. I was the center of attention for [the Raptors] as he was for the Sixers. I knew I had to score, and that didn\u2019t mean going shot for shot, point for point. Couldn\u2019t do that. Allen Iverson is Allen Iverson. So if he scored 55, 56, I just needed to be solid to where we could win. I think I had 42 the first game, a good night. When he scored 54 going into Game 2, my response was that we couldn\u2019t get too far behind on this team. [Both teams] felt like the winner of that series could go to The Finals. No disrespect to Milwaukee. (Editor\u2019s note: Carter scored 35 in Game 1, but responded to Iverson\u2019s 54 points in Game 2 with a 50-point game in Game 3.) Take me through your emotions the day of Game 7. I\u2019d say it was bittersweet, but it seemed more like sweetbitter. You go to your college graduation that morning and happily earn your degree, but ended it with missing the game-winner and losing the series. It was a great day. It was a lot going on. I wouldn\u2019t change it. I would do it the same way again. It was one of those days where I was able to accomplish a goal \u2014 a life-long goal, a family goal, a goal that any college student and educator would look forward to. And I wanted to cap it off by having the ultimate day. Not many people can say they hit a game-winning shot in Game 7 against the 76ers on the biggest stage. Yeah, it\u2019s crazy how one shot can completely change a narrative. Yeah, and it was sad and a shame to hear and read some people say \u201cit\u2019s just a degree\u201d or \u201cyou could buy that degree\u201d or \u201cwhat\u2019s the big deal in walking [across the stage]?\u201d That just doesn\u2019t make sense. I walk through my front door and see my diploma every day, and that\u2019s something that I\u2019m proud of. Because when [basketball] is over, I still got this. I come from a family of educators. All of my family [members] are teachers of some sort in the education system. Who was your favorite athlete to battle over your career? T-Mac. Kobe. I played together with these guys. Kobe and I played AAU ball. T-Mac and I were obviously family, so it\u2019s nothing like going against your superstar cousin. You can\u2019t beat that. Take me through your decision to give up your starting spot to Michael Jordan in the 2003 All-Star Game in his last season. We got to All-Star weekend and I had a brief conversation with David Stern and we kind of talked about it, but I felt there was nothing to talk about. That\u2019s just a no-brainer for me to let MJ [start]. I said the problem is going to be you guys convincing him. I just had a feeling he wouldn\u2019t go for it. I kind of briefly mentioned it to him and said, \u201cHey man, you\u2019re starting.\u201d He said, \u201cNo, you earned that.\u201d So right before the lineups I said, \u201cMJ, you are starting. Point blank period. You\u2019re starting.\u201d And I told him I was going to walk to the back so he couldn\u2019t make me start because I wasn\u2019t going to be there. We went back and forth. He goes out there. I felt like once they called his name he had to go. Are you hoping to be an honorary All-Star this season? No, no. If I earn it, give it to me. But that\u2019s just me. Don\u2019t take this the wrong way when I say it like that. That\u2019s just who I am. I\u2019m very appreciative of earning my All-Star spots, being a leading vote-getter, so I don\u2019t know. I just have a hard time with it. We\u2019ll see if later down the line my view changes. You ranked your dunk over Alonzo Mourning as your favorite dunk of all-time. Take me through that moment. I remember just going up. I felt since he was under the rim if I could get up in the air before him, I had a chance because even if he knocked me back my momentum could still take me towards the rim. But when he hit me, he hit me upward, which put me up higher by the rim. So I\u2019m just looking at the rim in a different view, thinking I can\u2019t miss. You see I tried to play it cool, but inside I was like a 7-year-old. I was just thinking how that\u2019s Alonzo Mourning, one of the best shot blockers in the history of the game. What are the biggest \u201cwhat if\u201d moments you have when you think about your career? What if I did make that shot [against the Sixers]? What if I did? What happens next? I don\u2019t know. What if T-Mac and I had a chance to play together longer? I got another one. What if we don\u2019t lose to Boston in six back when I was in Orlando? Cause we had a chance. They ended up going to The Finals. That was my other opportunity so I wonder what if. I always wondered that. Yeah, what were your thoughts when you found out you were leaving New Jersey to go back home and play in your hometown of Orlando? I don\u2019t think people know this story but the day I got traded to the Orlando Magic was the same day Michael Jackson died. June 25th, 2009. So, I was doing my basketball camp and my brother called me. He told me [about the trade] and we were excited. Then, me and a couple of my boys were at dinner and they\u2019re saying, \u201cOh man, that\u2019s crazy you\u2019re coming back home.\u201d So we\u2019re excited and the lady at the restaurant was like, \u201cHow can you be excited?\u201d Social media wasn\u2019t around like that. We didn\u2019t know. We\u2019re just hype about the trade. So my boy\u2019s like, \u201cYou heard the news too?\u201d She goes, \u201cHow can you be excited about that? The world is grieving at this point.\u201d He says, \u201cWhat are you talking about? My man just got traded to the Magic.\u201d That\u2019s when she says, \u201cMichael Jackson died.\u201d And we were like, \u201cWhat?!\u201d How do you connect with the younger generation these days? I read where NFL star Larry Fitzgerald said it\u2019s a lot different than it was 10 years ago. You have to listen and learn first and foremost. And we talk basketball so that\u2019s how it organically branches out to things like styles of music. As an older guy, you kind of just adapt to new styles more so than [the younger players] adapting to me. We have to adapt. Larry and I, Tom Brady, we have to adapt to what\u2019s around us. How many young players have called you Mr. Carter? A few. I\u2019m like just call me Vince (laughs). It\u2019s crazy. What advice would you give to someone like Zion Williamson, who came into the league being labeled a dunker by some? Be yourself. He\u2019s two years removed from high school. Players get to the NBA and we expect them to be somebody that they need to develop themselves to be. I came in labeled as a dunker, and then some people would say, \u201cYeah I knew you could shoot a little bit, but I want to see you dunk.\u201d Just like right now, when you see Zion, you don\u2019t want to see him shoot a jump shot. You want to see him dunk unless he\u2019s playing against your favorite team. And then you say what? \u201cMake him shoot a jump shot.\u201d But if you\u2019re just a fan of his, what are you gonna say? \u201cI want to see him dunk. I want to see him dunk on somebody.\u201d That\u2019s the natural reality of it. So just be yourself, play your game. [People] don\u2019t even know that he\u2019s got a decent handle. Not a bad passer. Shot-blocker. Yeah he\u2019s got all that. When we played [the Pelicans], I told him to be yourself and let all that other stuff take care of itself when it happens. Don\u2019t try to come out and be someone you\u2019re not. Then what happens? They\u2019re gonna consider him a bust. I would just be me. Everything else is gonna take care of itself. I knew that people were going to see that I could shoot, score and pass the ball. I just had to be patient, but it\u2019s not for everybody. Some people feel like they have to prove because of what\u2019s being said on social media. I ain\u2019t have that. You\u2019ve been fortunate to still get calls from teams at this point in your career. Why do you think Carmelo Anthony hasn\u2019t gotten the same chance? Situations are different. I think it\u2019s just timing at this point. I definitely think he deserves to be in the NBA. He\u2019s one of the most prolific scorers this league has seen at many levels. Pure scorer. I think in time a team will grab him, a playoff team who needs a scorer with his ability. If he\u2019s willing to come off the bench, I think he\u2019ll help a team with his starters mentality. What kept you from ring chasing towards the end of your career like some guys do? I can\u2019t. I just can\u2019t. I didn\u2019t come into my career like that. Guys who see things now see things different. They\u2019re exposed to things a little different. The way the game is played, showed and understood 20 years ago isn\u2019t like now. So I just naturally adapt to that. So when Trae [Young] is in his 15th, 20th year, what\u2019s he gonna know? He\u2019s not gonna know what I knew and how it was. He and young guys coming in now are going to know this era. That\u2019s just the way it is. What does Vince Carter want to be remembered by? I love to play. I love to play. People ask, \u201cWhy are you doing this, why are you doing that?\u201d Because I love playing. If I didn\u2019t love this anymore \u2014 stuff like drills and all that \u2014 then I wouldn\u2019t do it. I just love to play. Obviously, you saw the smiles and me having fun as a young guy when I came into the league. At 42, nothing\u2019s changed. Still love to play. Still love to be here. I\u2019m playing with a young team that\u2019s probably not going to win a championship this year, but I still love to play and compete. I enjoy it. * * *"},{"id":31040,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/things-know-nba-oct-29","date":"2019-10-29","title":"4 NBA things to know for Oct. 29","content":" Get up to speed on the latest NBA news, plus a quick look at stories we\u2019ll be following closely today: 1.

It\u2019s typical for these streets, basically, especially after 6 p.m. Working class folks are unwinding and headed home, except for those at M&M Star Car Wash and Detailing, where a dozen weary employees have just enough energy left to shoot a collective eye-roll in the direction of their otherwise beloved boss. They just overheard his brief phone conversation with someone running late: \u201cMan, we\u2019re \u2018bout to close, but bring it real quick,\u201d a common response from a businessman who kept the cash register and the customer happy. Whenever the workers are ready to punch the clock there\u2019s always someone driving in trying to beat it, and that\u2019s when Mark Leonard \u2014 they called him by his nickname, \u201cMick\u201d \u2014 tells his staff: \u201cWe\u2019ll do one more.\u201d And they answer: \u201c Mick, you always say one more.\u201d As the small and soiled pickup truck arrived and received a scrubbing, Leonard and his wife, Jacquelyne, who worked in the back office handling the books, stood on the lot at 413 North Wilmington, ready to lock up for the night, yet still caught up in the afterglow from the day before. That\u2019s when she told him he was going to be a father again; each had children from previous relationships but this was their first together as a couple after trying for years. He was thrilled. That night, he broke the news to relatives and then fetched her favorite fruits from the grocery. He wanted her to eat healthy the next nine months. \u201cWith the kids, he was a teddy bear,\u201d she said, \u201cand with me, he gave me everything.\u201d   One of Leonard\u2019s other children, a son, would be playing a high school basketball tournament in about an hour and Leonard feared the evening rush on the 405 Freeway. And just then: Someone else appeared on the lot and approached quickly, not by car, but by footstep, and with a strut. \u201cWho in the hell?\u201d Jacquelyne remembers saying. Mark Leonard came from the South Side of Chicago, then was raised and lived most of his entire adult life in and around Compton. People with that geographical bloodline usually carry a gene for detecting danger. His sixth sense did not betray him this day; indeed, the man reached for a handgun under his shirt and aimed. The first shot sent Leonard stumbling and the employees scattering. He told his wife to run and pushed her toward the office. She did not fall; she stayed steady on her feet, actually, and did as she was told. Her husband was right behind her. Until he wasn\u2019t. \u201cI ran into the building and when I realized he wasn\u2019t with me, I ran back and stood at the window and watched, and the guy was standing over him and shooting him,\u201d she says. When the pistol emptied, the gunman turned to her, then turned away and disappeared down the block. At 43, Mark Leonard was a husky man, 6-foot-3 and pushing 300 pounds by his wife\u2019s estimation, a body built from playing football at nearby Banning High School and layered by her tacos. But he couldn\u2019t survive multiple gunshot wounds, not that the punctures discouraged a shaken wife from reacting reflexively after rushing out the building. She collapsed on him, tears mixing with blood, then begged him. \u201cGet up,\u201d she said. \u201cYou got to get up.\u201d And: \u201cWhat about the baby?\u201d * * * There are over 18,000 murder cases cramming the digital library at the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department and roughly half are unsolved. When a case stalls, it sits until detectives receive what\u2019s known in investigative parlance as \u201cthe magic phone call,\u201d meaning, a tipster who helps blow the dust off that particular whodunit. But that could be weeks, months, years, even decades \u2014 if ever. In Compton, glorified as the birthplace of gangsta rap, a South-Central township of 100,000 proud residents who grapple with an exhausting history of crime and gang violence, the unsolved rate is among California\u2019s highest. Recent studies show 59% of killers get away with murder. Compton is home to Adams Mortuary , believed to be the country\u2019s only drive-thru funeral home, with a bullet-proof glass partition, which became necessary because a rise in cemetery shootouts made gang members skittish about paying their respects. One particular case is now 11 years old and stayed untouched until this summer. There is renewed interest and buzz in the Mark Leonard case and partly because the son whose high school game the father never made on Jan. 18, 2008 is a two-time NBA Finals MVP and now with the LA Clippers . In a quirky twist, Kawhi Leonard could be a factor in his father\u2019s case all because he became superb at basketball, and as a free agent last summer signed with one of L.A.\u2019s hometown teams, citing a desire to be closer to friends and family as a reason.  \u201cJust to be able to have them drive to the games and watch me play and see them afterward is going to be great,\u201d he said the day he was officially introduced as a Clipper. Kawhi was 16 and a high school junior when Mark Leonard was slain and seemingly not on the path to beating LeBron James and Steph Curry for championships back then; all he had in common with his current self was his now-trademark cornrows. Although Kawhi was a late-rising star among Southern California prep players, the chatter he generated was strictly regional and he eventually signed with San Diego State, not one of the nation\u2019s basketball powerhouse schools. But now, as an NBA superstar, savior of the Clippers and future Hall of Famer? \u201cKawhi\u2019s popularity can help,\u201d says Shaun McCarthy, a detective in the Unsolved Unit. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t famous when his dad died. But even some of the baddest criminals may be sympathetic to Kawhi, who is beginning to do good things in the community. Maybe someone out there says, `I didn\u2019t know that was Kawhi\u2019s dad\u2019 and tells us something. This happens often in high profile cases. Look, it\u2019s all `what-ifs\u2019 and `maybes\u2019. Maybe someone in trouble with the law knows about this murder and may be more willing to provide that now, knowing it will give him consideration in his case. They may benefit by giving up information.\u201d McCarthy said the process of interviewing witnesses and exploring new angles has already begun for other reasons he hesitates to divulge, citing the ongoing nature of the case. \u201cI\u2019ve decided, `Let\u2019s investigate these things,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWe can either put it to bed or maybe solve these things. It\u2019s a long shot, but I\u2019m optimistic we can identify some people.\u201d Mark Leonard\u2019s murder was not caused by attempted robbery. When victims are shot multiple times \u2014 10 in this case \u2014 that reflects a revenge hit. Investigators are retracing the curious events in the hours leading up to the shooting. Mark Leonard was paid a visit that morning by someone authorities identified and described as a local gang member with a criminal history for interstate drug transportation, seeking his advice about a recent botched deal with another gang. The two knew each other, although Jacquelyne Leonard said her husband was not in that business. \u201cMark had changed his life totally when I married him because I couldn\u2019t live like that,\u201d she said. \u201cMy mom was a retired judge and my dad was a cop. Mark made an honest living. He built this car wash from the ground up in 2006 and took pride in it. He paved the lot with his bare hands. Put in wide-screen TVs and installed flood lights so we could wash cars at night. Business was booming. We were black-owned. The community came out and supported us. It was a beautiful thing. The customers all knew and liked him because although he was big and intimidating and you couldn\u2019t come to him with no BS, he was a nice guy.\u201d McCarthy said: \u201cMark would\u2019ve never been in this situation if this guy, who was an associate, hadn\u2019t crossed him and used his name.\u201d Hours after that meeting, three other men arrived and spoke to Leonard outside the building. There was a heated discussion that involved shouting, loud enough to bring his wife from the office. \u201cWhen I came out and turned the corner, Mark had pushed this (Latino) guy,\u201d she said. \u201cCome to find out he was in a gang, and you can\u2019t do that. That was a deal breaker from my understanding. Mark went to hit him. I said, \u2018Mark don\u2019t do that.\u2019 He didn\u2019t hit him and they jumped into the car and left.\u201d The L.A. County Sheriff\u2019s Department detective originally assigned to the case was Frank Salerno, now two years retired from the force. Salerno is the son of Frank Sr., a legend in the department for cracking some of L.A.\u2019s most notorious serial killer cases, chief among them the Hillside Strangler , where victims were stashed in the hills surrounding Los Angeles; and the \u201cNight Stalker\u201d Richard Ramirez, who received 13 death sentences for particularly heinous murders. The Leonard case frustrated Frank Jr., who followed his father into the department and worked in homicide and also the gang unit as a lead detective for 34 years. Getting information at the car wash then proved to be futile. \u201cYou kind of get numb to it and used to it after you do it for a while,\u201d he said recently. \u201cThis was a typical case we would handle all the time. And the level of cooperation from witnesses was standard for that area. It\u2019s very rare when we get to a scene where people want to tell us exactly what happened. It\u2019s not like people didn\u2019t talk to us here; we think they didn\u2019t tell us everything they saw because of fear of gang retaliation. Some cases, people won\u2019t even talk, period. You go to a party and everybody was in the bathroom at the time. It\u2019s amazing how many people can fit into a bathroom. The standard answer is, \u2018I was in the bathroom and didn\u2019t see anything.\u2019 \u201d That\u2019s changing. While Leonard ran errands after the argument, Jacquelyne and the employees noticed a car circling the block multiple times. When Leonard returned, it was business as usual right up until the late customer drove on the lot at closing time. Police believe one of the three men who confronted Leonard earlier that day was the shooter and connected to a Latino gang. As detectives began reconnecting the dots, they phoned the widow out of the blue; she has lived without closure for more than a decade. A resolution, however challenging that may be, would give her the answers to the whom and the why. \u201cIt would be great,\u201d she said. \u201cI have prayed 11 years. My life changed drastically in one night.\u201d * * *  The car wash did much labor by hand, and this is where Mark Leonard helped seed Kawhi\u2019s way to NBA stardom, by injecting a work ethic in his son that\u2019s perhaps unsurpassed in the league. Kawhi lived with his mother, Kim Robertson, in Moreno Valley after his parents split when he was five. But he spent some weekends and parts of his summers in Compton with his father on the job, where he washed cars as a teenager \u2014 his hands were unusually large even then \u2014 alongside his two half-brothers, Cameron and Marcus, when he didn\u2019t have a game. \u201cMark told them if they wanted to wear the new tennis shoes, they had to work for them, that he can\u2019t keep buying them stuff,\u201d Jacquelyne Leonard said. \u201cKawhi never complained. He was a prankster at times but a very quiet child and a great kid who listened to his father and respected him.\u201d Kawhi was better at football initially; he played tight end at Canyon Springs High School and was already 6-foot-3, bruising and breaking through tacklers. But his love for basketball grew as he blossomed. His father was heartbroken when the son dropped football after his freshman year. Eventually Mark Leonard made peace and helped train him. By then Kawhi transferred to King High School in Riverside County , and after one practice, the coach at King, Tim Sweeney, called his dad, a legendary prep coach in Riverside, and said: \u201cI\u2019ve got a kid who\u2019s gonna be an NBA All-Star.\u201d Sweeney adds today: \u201cI told other people that same thing, and they all laughed.\u201d Kawhi\u2019s jump shot was flat when he arrived at King; however, the instincts that allow him to roam the floor and make snap decisions on both ends were evident then. His basketball IQ soared. Mostly, the wood-chopping energy was already rooted, a byproduct of the example his father set. \u201cAbsolute crazy\u201d is how Sweeney describes it. \u201cTo be at the level he is now, you have to have the talent but also the work ethic and mindset that\u2019s harder than everybody else\u2019s. I can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019d close the doors to our gym so I can go home and see my family, and when I turn the alarm on, the doors are open again. He was always finding a way to get into the gym to play, even at night when he wasn\u2019t supposed to be there.\u201d Sweeney was at dinner when he learned about Kawhi\u2019s father. King had just finished a league game that Mark Leonard never made. At Sweeney\u2019s request, Marvin Lea, a former King star and Kawhi\u2019s AAU coach, opened his home to Kawhi that night and consoled him. \u201cHe really didn\u2019t show no emotions about it,\u201d Lea said, \u201cand if you didn\u2019t know the boy, you wouldn\u2019t know what just happened. If you were around him enough, you know he\u2019s a little different. Kawhi is a private person, then and now. Kawhi handled it through basketball.\u201d The next night, King played the city high school heavyweight, Dominguez, at UCLA\u2019s Pauley Pavilion. Sweeney spoke with Kawhi earlier that day, told him it was his choice to play and would support him if he sat the rest of that season. \u201cLo and behold,\u201d Sweeney said, \u201che shows up with his mom, his uncle Dennis Robertson, all the family is there. I told the people running the event not to have a moment of silence. This kid is holding it together barely, I thought, and to do that, we\u2019re going to lose him. The idiots didn\u2019t listen.\u201d Leonard did remain remarkably composed, scored 17 points in a game King lost, 68-60 , but rushed into his mother\u2019s arms right after the buzzer and sobbed as he squeezed her. Friends had never seen Kawhi shed tears before. \u201cHe was playing for the love of his father and it was the first time he really felt the pain and the loss,\u201d said Sweeney. \u201cHis father was just a very hard-working man who came to as many games as he could; living in Compton, that\u2019s a good hour and a half drive in traffic away from King. He was always very cordial and respectful. He did a good job helping to raise Kawhi.\u201d It was apparent to everyone who knew Kawhi that the court became his sanctuary. In his senior year, he went next-level as a player. With a more polished and airy jump shot, combined with blue-collar energy, he averaged 22.6 points with 13.1 rebounds, 3.9 assists and three blocks and was named Player of the Year in California . Along with Tony Snell, now with the Pistons, Leonard led King to a 30-3 record and the state championship over top-ranked Mater Dei. Thus, the unexpected launch of an NBA superstar began: He played two years at San Diego State, was acquired by the Spurs via a Draft night trade in 2011 . He won an NBA championship and Finals MVP there, then repeated the feat last summer with the Raptors. He now has the Clippers \u2014 abysmal for much of their existence \u2013 looking like a championship favorite for 2019-20. \u201cWhen I moved into my current house,\u201d says Jacquelyne Leonard, \u201cI was unpacking and found an old Bible. I opened it and Mark had a prayer in it. He had made a list of things he wanted to happen in his life, as I asked him to do. One said, `Watch my boy go to the pros.\u2019 If Mark was sitting here right now, he\u2019d say, `I told y\u2019all.\u2019 Unfortunately he\u2019s not around to see this.\u201d * * * The car wash once run by Mark Leonard has twice changed hands and operates today as HB Tires and Wheels . Business is brisk because this is a car city. The signage is different. The old employees are long gone and rusty cars fill the lot. There are, however, three holes near the bottom of the facade, right by the front door, which the manager says were made by bullets. If only walls could talk. He says every once in a while, an old customer will mention the shooting and excitedly ask him if he knew whose dad it was, and the manager nods respectfully before Kawhi Leonard\u2019s name is mentioned. Jacquelyne Leonard kept the business open after the murder, but that spring she was shot in a drive-by from a truck , almost in the exact same spot in the parking lot. That, too, became an unresolved case, and detectives aren\u2019t sure if the shootings were related. She said she nearly lost her legs: \u201cThe doctors told me they were going to amputate, they were so damaged. I had eight surgeries just to help me walk again.\u201d She was also three months pregnant, but soon delivered Mark Leonard\u2019s last child, and some of Mark\u2019s old high school football teammates and employees helped raise the boy. Today, a decade later, mother and son are healthy and happy, she reports. Zion Mark Anthony Leonard is 11 and plays basketball. Not as reserved as his famous half-brother, he is asking his mother what happened to his father. Three months ago Kawhi Leonard held his Clippers\u2019 jersey for the first time, at a team news conference where they formally introduced him and Paul George, another star making a return to Los Angeles-area roots. True to his nature, Leonard was mostly reserved at the ceremony, even on a day made for enthusiasm. Seizing the chance to crown themselves a team for all of Los Angeles, the Clippers held the event at Green Meadows Recreation Center in South L.A., their way of giving light to a community that rarely if ever sees rich and famous athletes. It was perhaps only a coincidence that, just a few stoplights away, on the other side of the 105 Freeway, on a lot that once was a car wash, is where Leonard first learned the value of hard work. Perhaps soon, he\u2019ll learn who stole the life of the man who taught him that. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

Oklahoma City point guard Chris Paul returned to Houston for the first time since the Rockets moved him for first-round picks and pick swaps over the summer to acquire Westbrook , who dominated the night of reunions by nearly logging his second consecutive triple-double (21 points, 12 rebounds, 9 assists) to fuel a 116-112 triumph . In doing so, Westbrook nearly became the first player to post triple-doubles against all 30 NBA teams. \u201cThis is how it goes,\u201d Westbrook said. \u201cWhen I hoop, I have no friends. On the court, they know not to talk to me. Steven\u2019s a real close friend of mine. But inside those lines, there\u2019s no friends. Spalding, that\u2019s my friend, and my teammates. That\u2019s it. If you try to be my friend, I ain\u2019t gonna say [expletive] to you.\u201d Shortly after saying those words, Westbrook walked down the hall to the Thunder locker room, where he hugged coach Billy Donovan before entering as his former teammates dressed. Westbrook played 11 seasons with the Thunder before the July trade, and earned NBA All-Star recognition on eight occasions in addition to capturing the 2017 Kia MVP. \u201cHe obviously has done an enormous amount for the organization, for the state and the city,\u201d Donovan said. \u201cI\u2019ve always respected how hard he competed and played. We had a chance to spend four great years together. It was good to just connect.\u201d As Westbrook strolled into the locker room, several Thunder officials approached him for hugs. Glass of water in hand, the point guard eventually settled near Adams\u2019 locker adjacent to injured guard Andre Roberson. Nearby, Paul dressed and joked that Westbrook could be fined by the league for entering the opponent\u2019s locker room, which drew laughter from all over the room. Westbrook eventually moved to Paul\u2019s locker, where the two talked quietly for several minutes. On the floor, though, Westbrook overcame a slow start to dominate over the final three quarters which helped push the Rockets to their second consecutive victory. Westbrook finished at a game-best plus-19, while James Harden led all scoring with 40 points. Westbrook has posted a 20-point double-double in all three of Houston\u2019s games this season, including a triple-double Saturday in a win over the New Orleans Pelicans. Westbrook has also pulled down 38 rebounds over his first three games, which ranks as the most by a Rocket through the first three games of the season since Dwight Howard registered 51 rebounds during the 2013-14 season. In addition, Westbrook moved into 20th on the NBA\u2019s all-time assists list (6,918). \u201cHe just brings a different dynamic to the game: his speed, his pace, his athleticism, his playmaking ability,\u201d Harden said. \u201cHe does so much and creates for his teammates. It\u2019s pretty tough to guard. He\u2019s a superstar. But he\u2019s getting offensive rebounds, he\u2019s hustling. He\u2019s doing the dirty things that help you win. It feels good to have that on your side.\u201d On the other side, Paul didn\u2019t fare as well against his former team, finishing with 15 points and four assists. Paul missed his first five shots, making his first bucket with 54.9 seconds left in the first half. At the 5:57 mark of the first quarter during a timeout, the Toyota Center played a tribute video featuring Paul\u2019s days as a Rocket that lasted a minute and 30 seconds, ending with the message of \u201cThank you CP3.\u201d The crowd gave Paul a standing ovation as he waved to the fans from the bench area, before hugging Houston guard Eric Gordon as he checked back into the game. The fans here were always great to me. Some of the people here became like family to me,\u201d Paul said. \u201cAnd I try to stay in touch with those who were as genuine as could be. I had some great memories here. I\u2019m grateful to the fans for how they always treated me and my family. I\u2019ll forever be grateful for that.\u201d Paul played two seasons in Houston (2017-19), averaging 17.1 points, 8.0 assists and 5 rebounds, before the club traded him to Oklahoma City. Paul helped the Rockets to a franchise-best record of 65-17 in his first season, but they fell in Game 7 of the 2018 Western Conference finals to the eventual-champion Golden State Warriors. With the Rockets leading that series 3-2, Paul suffered a hamstring injury that forced him out of the last two games. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the best point guards that\u2019s ever played and still is. What he does is incredible,\u201d Rockets coach Mike D\u2019Antoni said. \u201cWith his knowledge of the game, his competitiveness, he\u2019s going to be around for a while. He was just really good for us. It\u2019s hard to win a whole lot more than what we won with him. We could\u2019ve gone a little bit further in the playoffs. One year, he just got a hamstring problem. Then the next year, it just didn\u2019t work out. It\u2019s hard to be better than what he was.\u201d * * * Michael C.

A reunion in Houston: What kind of reception will Chris Paul get tonight when his Oklahoma City Thunder \u2014 yep, that still sounds weird \u2014 visit his old pals in Houston? This one will be a free watch on NBA League Pass (8 ET) and couldn\u2019t feature more different styles: the Thunder are 3rd in Defensive Rating (and 27th in Offensive Rating ) while the Rockets are 10th in Offensive Rating (and 21st in Defensive Rating). 2. Trae tries to do it again:  Yes, it\u2019s only two games into an 82-game slog. Still, you can\u2019t help but be amazed by what Trae Young of the Hawks has done to open 2019-20, notching 38- and 39-point games to get Atlanta to 2-0. The Sixers, who have the fifth-best defensive rating in the NBA this season, pay Young and Co. a visit tonight ( 7:30 ET, League Pass ). 3. Someone\u2019s gotta win \u2026 right?: Who would have thought after Week 1 in the NBA we\u2019d see the Warriors and Pelicans both winless? Golden State has the NBA\u2019s worst defense (124.3 Def. Rating) and effective field goal percentage, while the Pelicans are just two spots ahead of the Warriors on defense (114.8 Def. Rating). They meet in New Orleans ( 8 ET, NBA TV ). 4. Big man concerns for Portland: The Blazers are waiting to see how Zach Collins\u2019 MRI on his left shoulder turns out. They won\u2019t have much time to celebrate (or bemoan) his status, though, as they visit the 2-0 Spurs tonight ( 8:30 ET, League Pass ) in what should be a solid matchup in the West. 5. Break up the Suns!: Phoenix was the darling of the NBA weekend after upsetting the Clippers on Saturday night. There\u2019s no rest for the weary, though, as the Suns host the Jazz ( 10 ET, League Pass ) in hopes of another upset. A win tonight would give Phoenix its first 3-1 start since 2013-14, while a Jazz win would have them off to their best start since a 5-0 run in 2008-09. 6. Happy debut anniversay, D-Rose: Eleven years ago today, Derrick Rose burst onto the scene as a bright-eyed rookie with the Bulls. Since then, he\u2019s been a superstar (and won Kia MVP in 2010-11) and dealt with a myriad of injuries. He seems comfy again in his career these days as his Pistons host the Pacers ( 7 ET, League Pass ).

The Mandeville Canyon and Mountain Gate communities remains under a mandatory evacuation order that verges into Brentwood, and the evacuation warning area has been expanded westward to include parts of Topanga State Park and the Pacific Palisades. Evacuation centers are open in Westwood and Sherman Oaks. Earlier on Monday morning, The Los Angeles Fire Department is ordering mandatory evacuations after a fire erupted on a hillside near the Getty Center museum. The department posted an alert Monday advising everyone to leave the Mountain Gate and Mandeville Canyon communities between Mandeville Canyon Road and Interstate 405 north of Sunset Blvd. Although the Getty Center is nearby, officials say the facility was built with thick walls and doors to compartmentalize any flames. Mount Saint Mary\u2019s University tweeted that its Chalon campus near the Getty has been evacuated under orders from the LAFD. Students were taken to its Doheny campus. The blaze comes as the Tick Fire near Santa Clarita was 70% contained as of Sunday night.

Lakers coach Frank Vogel told reporters before Sunday\u2019s 120-101 win over Charlotte that Cousins, who is recovering from an offseason ACL tear in his left knee, could return as soon as this season. \u201cWe\u2019ve not closed the door on that,\u201d Vogel said \u201cWe\u2019re going to be a wait and see. With these injuries that are long rehabs, you have to see and take it kind of month to month and see where he\u2019s at. But we\u2019ve not closed the door on a possible return for him.\u201d The Warriors took a similar approach with Cousins last season before he ultimately returned from a torn Achilles suffered with the New Orleans Pelicans in 2018 . The former All-Star played 30 regular season games before a torn quad muscle again sidelined him, this time until The Finals against Toronto. Fresh off that injury, the Lakers took a low-cost risk to sign Cousins during the offseason. The move was designed to further aid star big man Anthony Davis\u2019 desire to play at power forward. Instead, Cousins\u2019 run of bad luck continued when he tore his left ACL in a summer pickup game. The news forced the Lakers to quickly turn to another former superstar \u2014 Dwight Howard \u2014 for help in the middle. Howard, whose production and star power have declined rapidly since his last All-Star appearance in 2014, turned back the clock on Sunday for 16 points, 10 rebounds and four blocks in just 23 minutes off the bench. Still, the Lakers would no doubt welcome the option of Cousins as long as Vogel deploys Davis at power forward. In that scenario, L.A.\u2019s current options are Howard and JaVale McGee, the latter of whom averaged more than 20 minutes per game last season for the first time since 2011-12. Cousins, the fifth overall pick of the 2010 Draft, was one of the most dominant big men in the league before his string of injuries. The four-time All-Star boasts career averages of 21.2 points, 10.9 rebounds, 3.2 assists, 1.4 steals and 1.2 blocks. The list of players in NBA history to turn in averages of 21-10-3-1-1 (or better) over an entire season is short and star-filled."},{"id":31101,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/kyrie-irving-most-points-new-team","date":"2019-10-28","title":"Kyrie Irving sets record for most points with new team","content":"Kyrie Irving is wearing his third uniform in four seasons. If his first three games in Brooklyn are any indication, the Nets may believe they have the best edition of the All-NBA point guard. Through the first three games of the 2019-20 season, Irving has scored 113 total points. That mark bests James Harden\u2019s feat of 106 points in his first three games with Houston in 2012, setting a new record for most points with a new team in that same span. Irving also joins Vince Carter and Stephon Marbury as the only Nets to score 25 points or better in each of the first three games to start a season. Irving\u2019s 37.7 points per game rank second behind only Atlanta\u2019s Trae Young in the early season. The former Cleveland Cavalier and Boston Celtic is shooting 41.2 percent on more than 11 attempts per game from 3-point range. With fellow offseason Nets signee Kevin Durant out with a torn Achilles, Irving finds himself as the No. 1 option on a Brooklyn team hoping to take the next step after finishing sixth in the East last season. Perhaps just as impressive is Irving\u2019s efficiency despite the heavy load he already shoulders. The six-time All-Star has committed just six turnovers in 104 total minutes while shooting 27-for-29 from the free throw line. Irving started the Nets chapter of his career with a bang, dropping 50 points in the season opener against Minnesota .

Dennis Schroder scored 22 points to help Oklahoma City rout the Golden State Warriors 120-92 on Sunday for their first victory of the season. It was a long-awaited ray of hope for fans who have been looking for something to cling to after the Thunder traded away longtime star Russell Westbrook for Chris Paul in the offseason. The blowout matched Oklahoma City\u2019s largest margin of victory over the Warriors since the franchise moved from Seattle before the 2008-09 season. The fact that the breakthrough came against the Warriors didn\u2019t mean much to Paul. \u201dI think it was more about us, not about them,\u201d he said. \u201dWe\u2019ve got to have an identity. How we are going to play defensively and offensively? Pushing the pace, moving the ball and playing with the right spirit.\u201d Now, Paul and Westbrook will face off Monday night in Houston. Paul said it might be a bit awkward, but he won\u2019t make a big deal about it. \u201dIt\u2019ll be my first time back there since I got traded so you know, it\u2019s another game,\u201d he said. \u201dMove on. See a couple familiar faces say what up to my man the equipment manager. Keep it pushing.\u201d The Warriors still have a lot to figure out. Stephen Curry scored 23 points on Sunday, making 7 of 18 shots while his teammates made just 23 of 74. Golden State was coming off a season-opening home loss to the Los Angeles Clippers. Kevin Durant left the Warriors for Brooklyn in the offseason and Klay Thompson is likely out for the season with a torn left ACL. Still, Golden State expected to be more competitive early in the season. \u201dIt sucks,\u201d Warriors forward Draymond Green said. \u201dBut I guess just about everybody except Tim Duncan has been through it. But it sucks pretty bad.\u201d Oklahoma City roared out to a 70-37 halftime lead. The Thunder shot 56.5% before the break while holding the Warriors to 27.5%. Schroder had 16 points and six rebounds in the first half. A 3-pointer by Danilo Gallinari put the Thunder ahead 95-56 with just over four minutes left in the third quarter and forced a Warriors timeout. Oklahoma City led 105-68 heading into the final period. Gallinari scored 21 points and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander added 19 points and nine rebounds for the Thunder. The Warriors allowed the Thunder to shoot 56% from the field after allowing the Clippers to shoot 63%. \u201dEverybody loved our offense, but it wasn\u2019t our offense that was making us great,\u201d Green said. \u201dIt was our defense. I\u2019ve said that for years. Our defense right now is nonexistent. I don\u2019t even think we know what defense is right now.\u201d TIP-INS Warriors: C Kevon Looney sat out with a neuropathic condition in his right hamstring. \u2026 The Warriors had 12 turnovers in the first half. \u2026 Curry was called for a technical foul in the third quarter after hitting Thunder G Terrance Ferguson in the crotch area. \u2026 D\u2019Angelo Russell was ejected in the third quarter for arguing with an official. He finished with six points on 3 for 10 shooting. Thunder: G\/F Andre Roberson remains out as the team manages his return from a left knee injury that has kept him out the past 1 1\/2 years. \u2026 C Steven Adams made 4 of 8 shots after going 4 for 17 his first two games. QUOTABLE Thunder coach Billy Donovan on having to coach against Westbrook on Monday: \u201dHe was always a great guy to coach. The one thing I always admired and respected \u2013 and I told him this \u2013 that I never took for granted that he came ready to play and give his all every night.\u201d IT\u2019S A NEW DAY Green on how things have changed: \u201dI didn\u2019t have a feeling that it would be like this. You kind of figured (expletive) won\u2019t be the same, but I didn\u2019t think we\u2019d be getting our (expletive) kicked like this. It\u2019s pretty bad.\u201d HOUSE ANYONE? Paul said he might take advantage of the opportunity and check on his Houston-area house that is up for sale. STAT LINES Thunder G Terrance Ferguson made his first field goal of the season in the first quarter. He entered the day 0 for 4 in two games and 46 minutes of action.

But when the young Grizzlies needed to calm down and come up with their first win of the season, they turned to one of the few veterans on their roster as the final moments of overtime ticked away. Morant used as much of the remaining 3.7 seconds as he dared to advance the ball before shoveling a pass to Jae Crowder, who drilled the straightaway 3-pointer for Memphis\u2019 134-133 win over the Nets. * * * DIFFICULTY: Morant did all the table-setting, speeding downcourt and drawing two defenders to him like a magnet. That allowed Crowder to receive a simple shovel pass with ample space to shoot north to south, a beeline look the veteran coolly hit as time expired. GAME SITUATION: It looked as though Brooklyn\u2019s Joe Harris was going to wind up the hero on the previous possession. His unlikely high-flying tip-in put Brooklyn up 133-131 with just 3.7 seconds left in overtime. Between that, Ja Morant\u2019s turnover on the previous possession and the fact that Crowder had not scored at all until overtime, the game\u2019s momentum was not on Memphis\u2019 side heading into the final possession. CELEBRATION: For a young Grizzlies team seeking to establish an identity, a veteran like Crowder draws immediate credibility and respect. Some of his younger teammates had already started sprinting toward him before the ball hit bottom, and the entire team had run him down by the time Crowder was pounding his chest in triumph. GRADE: An impressive and potentially foundational win for a rebuilding Grizzlies squad. Memphis can look back on what they did right to come away with the victory \u2014 and to Crowder as an example of cool-headed clutchness that doesn\u2019t seem quite so out of reach for a young team. 3.5 Horrys ."},{"id":31064,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/john-henson-cleveland-cavaliers-strained-hamstring-out","date":"2019-10-27","title":"Cavaliers center John Henson out 2-4 weeks with strained hamstring","content":"Cleveland Cavaliers center John Henson will be sidelined approximately 2-4 weeks after suffering a strained right hamstring, the team announced on Sunday .

In fact, Doncic and Young look even better and have both their teams off to a 2-0 start. Doncic is coming off an impressive performance on Friday night, registering a 25-point triple-double in a win over the New Orleans Pelicans. The Mavericks\u2019 leading scorer went off for 34 points the game prior, the most in a season opener by a player under 21 years old in NBA history . He already holds the all-time record for most triple-doubles for players under 21 with nine, more than Magic Johnson (seven) and LeBron James (five). Young also posted numbers that put him in the company of a current and future Hall of Famer. Through two games, he\u2019s combined for 77 points and 18 assists. Larry Bird and Russell Westbrook are the only other players in NBA history to record at least 75 points and 15 assists over their first two games of the season. The Hawks\u2019 cold-blooded shooter is averaging 38.5 points, 7 rebounds and 9 assists. Doncic is averaging 29.5 points, 9.5 rebounds and 6.5 assists. In their last respective contests, Doncic and Young each banked in a vicious step-back 3-pointer that iced the game against a division opponent. Doncic drilled a high-arching dagger against the Pelicans. Young drained a rainbow clincher against the Magic. Both players hitting a step-back 3 that banks in and sticks the knife in the back of a division foe is extremely coincidental, but it also illuminates how these pair of nascent ballhandlers will continue to be linked throughout their careers. The Hawks drafted Doncic with the No. 3 pick in 2018, but traded away his rights to the Mavericks in exchange for Young and a 2019 Draft pick (Cam Reddish, who looks great on defense but has struggled offensively to begin the season). During the 2018-19 season, both players ended up battling for the Kia Rookie of the Year award, with Doncic emerging as the winner. Some want to call it a rivalry, and the comparisons last season were ubiquitous. But it\u2019s certainly been time to shift from that narrative as both players are incredible young talents who are set to rule the 2020s in their own way. And the pair of budding stars respect each other enough to where \u201crivalry\u201d seems like a forced notion. Doncic reacted to Young\u2019s game-winner on Twitter, and the two often laud each other\u2019s highlights on Instagram. There\u2019s no battle for Rookie of the Year anymore. Maybe one day there will be a race between the two for Kia MVP. But for now, we should appreciate them both and the sophomore tear they appear to be waging. * * * The views on this page do not necessarily reflect the views of the NBA, its clubs or Turner Broadcasting."},{"id":31134,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/markelle-fultz-slowly-regaining-confidence-magic","date":"2019-10-27","title":"Markelle Fultz slowly regaining confidence with Magic","content":" ATLANTA \u2014 You can see glimpses of it, flashes even, of the bounce and instincts that made him the No. 1 overall pick in the 2017 Draft. It\u2019s still there. The lift off the floor to battle with players four and five inches taller for rebounds, the behind-the-back, no-look pass on a dead sprint that a teammate couldn\u2019t finish. It\u2019s not as consistent as he might like it to be, not yet. And there are still those awkward moments, those times when he looks like he\u2019s leaning back as he rises to shoot a jump shot or that hitch he\u2019s worked so hard to eliminate from his form causes a momentary pause in his motion. He\u2019s working through the process every moment and every minute on the floor. This is how it\u2019s going to be for Markelle Fultz, at least for the foreseeable future. The restoration process the Orlando Magic guard is immersed in right now won\u2019t be completed overnight, no matter how badly Fultz or the Magic want it to turn out that way. Patience is the key right now for Fultz because he still doesn\u2019t play with the freedom his mercurial talent suggested he would when the Philadelphia 76ers made him the top pick. If it takes moments to rebuild the confidence lost throughout his struggles in his first two seasons in the league, so be it. There\u2019s no added pressure from a Magic team that returns the core of a roster that won the Southeast Division last season and battled the Toronto Raptors in a first-round playoff series. \u201cIt\u2019s like that, yeah, 100 percent,\u201d Fultz said of the moments he\u2019s experiencing now after having played in just 33 games in his two seasons with the Sixers. \u201cBut I put in a lot of work for this moment and I\u2019m just glad to be on the court. But I\u2019ve always had confidence, growing up where I grew up you always had to have confidence. You just got to have an edge to you and every time I step on that court I believe in myself and I believe in my teammates and I just go out there and play.\u201d He acknowledged that playing off the bench for a team and organization that won\u2019t pressure him to skips any steps in the rehabilitation process is the best place for him to continue plotting his course. And so far, so good, Fultz is the Magic\u2019s third-leading scorer (12.0) behind Evan Fournier and All-Star big man Nikola Vucevic after two games. He wasn\u2019t shy in the Magic\u2019s 103-99 loss to the Atlanta Hawks on Saturday night at State Farm Arena. He took seven shots in his first 11 minutes on the floor, going 3-for-7 overall and 2-for-5 from beyond the 3-point line. \u201cI shot all my shots with confidence,\u201d Fultz said after finishing with 12 points (4-for-11), three assists, three rebounds and no turnovers. \u201cAnd it\u2019s only a matter of time before they start falling. A few fell tonight and I\u2019m just going to keep shooting.\u201d Watching Fultz and second-year Hawks point guard Trae Young work against one another for the final four minutes at State Farm Arena Saturday night was an interesting contrast of how things can work when the circumstances are optimal, and when they are something far less than that. Young is already the undeniable leader of a young team in the foundational stage of their process. He\u2019s in complete command of what Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce wants done, while still needing to smooth out the rough edges of his game as he continues to mature physically. Young\u2019s belief in his own abilities and what he can do on the floor, however, shines through in the way he plays. (Two games into this season he\u2019s averaging 38.5 points and shooting 58 percent from the floor and 55 percent from beyond the 3-point line to go along with nine rebounds and seven assists). He put the game away for the Hawks in the final minute, driving past Fultz for a layup and then banking a 3-pointer over Fultz\u2019s outstretched arm with 25.1 seconds to play, back-to-back plays that had the crowd roaring and punctuated Young\u2019s masterful 39-point, nine-assist, seven-rebound night. \u201cWe made two big mistakes on him in the last two minutes, things we had done the whole second half,\u201d Magic coach Steve Clifford said. \u201cWe let him get away from a screen once and we went under once and he hit both shots. And those are mistakes you shouldn\u2019t make.\u201d Fultz, of course, is still working on that part of his game. Clifford\u2019s decision to go with him, instead of starter D.J. Augustin or former Rookie of the Year Michael Carter-Williams, speaks volumes about the confidence being placed in Fultz this season. And if what he\u2019s shown early on, both in training camp and the preseason as well as the Magic\u2019s first two games, is any indication, those flashes, those bursts of the breathtaking play he\u2019s capable of might stretch into something much more significant. \u201cIt shows the trust and it shows the work I put in,\u201d Fultz said of Clifford\u2019s decision to go with him for those final four, crunch-time minutes. \u201cAnd for me, it\u2019s learning experiences. Every time I can step on the floor and learn and just be the best player I can be. And down the stretch, that\u2019s one of the best times to be on the court, when all the pressure\u2019s on you. I definitely learned a lot out there tonight being out there in that time. But again, it just shows the trust and shows that I have to keep working.\u201d * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

We have some adversity right here in front of us and we have to deal with it well, do it together and we\u2019ll be better for it.\u201d Williams has put on a brave face, but it\u2019s undeniably a blow. The Suns won their opening game over Sacramento 124-95 and were hoping to make a big leap in the standings after finishing with a 19-63 record last season. Ayton was the No. 1 overall pick one year ago and averaged 16.3 points and 10.3 rebounds as a rookie. He had 18 points, 11 rebounds and four blocks in the win over the Kings. Now he\u2019s gone for the foreseeable future. Without him, the offense will revolve around fifth-year guard Devin Booker, who averaged 26.6 points last season. He\u2019ll get help from several offseason acquisitions, including point guard Ricky Rubio and veteran big men like Aron Baynes, Frank Kaminsky III and Dario Saric. Williams said Baynes will start in Ayton\u2019s absence. \u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of what (general manager) James (Jones) has done all summer, was give us depth and versatility,\u201d Williams said. \u201cAron has started a number of games in his pro career and we\u2019re looking forward to our guys playing off Aron as the anchor of our defense.\u201d The 6-foot-10, 260-pound Baynes is a powerful post presence who has been a valuable role player over the past several years for the Boston Celtics, Detroit Pistons and San Antonio Spurs. But he\u2019s never averaged more than 18 minutes a game in any season. That may change over the next two months. Ayton is eligible to return on Dec. 17 against the Los Angeles Clippers. Baynes should replace some of Ayton\u2019s rebounding and defense, but there\u2019s little doubt Booker will have a big chunk of the scoring load. Booker called Ayton \u201ca force\u201d that will be missed during games, but the only option is to keep fighting. \u201cIt\u2019s the NBA, you have to view it as an injury,\u201d Booker said. \u201cEverybody goes through injuries during the season where teammates miss games. It\u2019s the next-man-up mentality.\u201d * * * AP Sports Writer Pat Graham in Denver contributed to this story."},{"id":31130,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/lakers-get-win-column-feature","date":"2019-10-26","title":"On second attempt, Lakers make solid first impression","content":" LOS ANGELES \u2014 With microphone in hand, Danny Green created a kinda-sorta slogan for the 2019-20 Lakers by uttering a kinda-sorta ringing endorsement. \u201cWe\u2019ll do better than last year,\u201d he promised the first home crowd of the season. Well, considering last year was just shy of a disaster by almost every metric, the bar seems knee high. And to be honest, the Friday sellout crowd at Staples Center would\u2019ve been fine if the Lakers just did better than the last game, a 10-point loss to the Clippers a few nights earlier that wounded the pride of Laker Nation. At least the Lakers got a second chance to make a first impression, and they made the most of that, with a solid victory over Utah where the Lakers flashed the twin factors they\u2019ll need this season to thrive: Generous doses of LeBron James and Anthony Davis along with punishing defense. The Jazz are one of those Western Conference teams that, on paper, should win 50-plus games and cause trouble when the playoffs begin. So they were a legitimate early-season test, which the Lakers aced. The outcome was essentially decided midway through the fourth quarter, when LeBron and Davis were resting comfortably on the bench, and the 95-86 victory was wrapping up. By then, the two future Hall of Famers had connected on a series of pick-and-rolls that completely flummoxed the Jazz, and this film will certainly send a chill through any future opponent putting together a scouting report. It\u2019s a weapon the Lakers would be foolish not to employ; Davis and LeBron are matchup nightmares singularly. Together, they\u2019re a recurring nightmare. \u201cIt was a tough cover for Utah,\u201d Davis said. Seriously: How exactly do you defend this? Either Davis or LeBron rolling to the rim make for a handful, and both are solid enough mid-range shooters to give that combination an effective second option. LeBron scored 32 points with 10 assists and seven rebounds, while Davis was good for 21 points, seven rebounds and five blocks. And the good news for the Lakers is Davis and LeBron are just getting to know each other\u2019s tendencies and preferences, meaning, this chemistry should only sharpen and cause more problems. There was something else, too, that the Lakers showcased against Utah: Using Davis at center. It\u2019s not a position he craves, and in a perfect basketball world, he\u2019d never see more than a few possessions in the middle. Davis likes to roam free instead of being chained to the paint. But coming out of the halftime break, the Lakers were slumbering and coach Frank Vogel pulled that emergency cord and the results were positive, even against Rudy Gobert, perhaps the league\u2019s best rim protector. \u201cIf it makes sense, then I don\u2019t mind doing it,\u201d Davis said. The center spot is a curiosity for the Lakers; neither JaVale McGee or Dwight Howard are in their prime, nor do they bring an offensive component. Which means, on occasion, Vogel will nudge Davis over from power forward. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to go through that full time because we want to keep Anthony fresh,\u201d Vogel said, \u201cbut we have that option in our back pocket. He was all for it and wanted to do it.\u201d It\u2019s all a work in progress for the Lakers mainly because of all the new pieces in the rotation, and also because the Lakers aren\u2019t yet whole. Rajon Rondo remains on the mend and his role as an optional ball handler next to LeBron is crucial, if only to relieve LeBron from those duties for generous stretches. There\u2019s no timetable for Rondo\u2019s return although a possible projection is another week. Same for Kyle Kuzma, who hasn\u2019t played in a game since suffering a stress reaction in his left foot at the FIBA World Cup in August. Obviously Kuzma\u2019s value to the Lakers is paramount; he\u2019s the third wheel and the borderline All-Star who brings outside shooting and is capable of making teams pay for doubling on LeBron and Davis. In due time, the Lakers will be fully stocked and equipped to make good on doing better than last year, provided of course both LeBron and Davis remain upright and don\u2019t reach for a body part at some point this season. Until then, they hope to keep playing the inspired defense that confused the Jazz, who were buried under 23 turnovers. When the Lakers can win a game easily despite shooting below 40%, as they did Friday, then it\u2019s a good defensive day. \u201cThat\u2019s who we are,\u201dsaid LeBron, \u201cor at least we want to be that every night.\u201d Davis conceded the Lakers were faulty in the season opener against the Clippers, who shot 52% and cruised on the strength of their leading scorers connecting on mid-range jumpers and their bench. \u201cKawhi (Leonard) and Lou Will kind of hurt us,\u201d said Davis. \u201cWe want to be defensive oriented. The more we can punch guys in the mouth defensively it\u2019ll help us offensively.\u201d And so the Lakers in their second year with LeBron and first year with Davis are carving out their identity. It started with a loss, rebounded with a win, and will go forth on the strength of their two stars and assorted role players while Rondo and Kuzma are out. This should be enough to sustain a club that has already forgotten what last year was like. At least until Green addressed the crowd and felt it necessary to use last season as a launching pad. You might say the Lakers are already over it by now. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years. You can e-mail him  here , find his archive here  and follow him on  Twitter  .

Per team policy, terms of the deal were not released.  \u201cCedi epitomizes everything it means to be a Cavalier and we\u2019re excited to sign him to this extension,\u201d said Altman. \u201cHis work ethic and commitment to this organization and community are qualities we admire in a player. Cedi has also demonstrated daily his desire to expand his overall skill-set and we look forward to seeing his continued growth and development.\u201d Osman (6-7, 230) appeared in 76 games (75 starts) with the Cavaliers last season, averaging career highs of 13.0 points, 4.7 rebounds and 2.6 assists in 32.2 minutes per contest. He increased his scoring average from 2017-18 to 2018-19 by 9.1 points (3.9 to 13.0), the third-highest scoring increase in the NBA last season behind only Pascal Siakam (+9.6) and Derrick Rose (+9.6)(minimum 150 FGA in both seasons). In addition, Osman posted three double-doubles and scored in double-digits on 52 occasions, including 20 points or more 13 times. Osman also represented the Cavaliers at 2019 NBA All-Star Weekend in Charlotte as a member of the World Team for the MTN DEW ICE Rising Stars. He joined 18 other Cavaliers players who previously competed in the Rising Stars since its inception in 1994 and was the first Cavalier to appear in the event since Matthew Dellavedova played with the World Team in 2015. A native of Ohrid, Macedonia, Osman was originally selected by the Minnesota Timberwolves with the 31st overall pick in the 2015 NBA Draft before having his draft rights acquired by the Cavaliers that night, and signed a contract with Cleveland on July 18, 2017. The third-year forward has spent his entire NBA career with the Cavs and owns career averages of 9.0 points and 3.5 rebounds in 22.8 minutes per game over 138 career contests (88 starts). Prior to his NBA career, Osman played for Anadolu Efes in Turkey (2011-2017), where he earned BSL All-Star honors in each of his last three seasons (2015-17) while helping Anadolu Efes win the 2015 Turkish Cup and 2015 Turkish Supercup. Osman has also been a member of the Turkish senior national team since 2014.

Fresh off a 2018-19 that saw Portland advance to its first Western Conference finals since 2000, the Blazers invested in some roster upgrades in the offseason via trades and other moves. As the rest of the West got deeper and changed significantly \u2014 particularly the Los Angeles Lakers, LA Clippers and Golden State Warriors, to name a few \u2014 the Blazers improved themselves as well . They added veterans (Kent Bazemore, Pau Gasol, Anthony Tolliver) and potential contributors (Mario Hezonja, Hassan Whiteside) while inking McCollum and All-NBA guard Damian Lillard to contract extensions, too .  Those changes and more had McCollum writing that he sees no reason for the Blazers to think they can\u2019t emerge as the top team in the West this season. \u201cAll the talk this off-season has been about the Lakers and the Clippers. LeBron and A.D. Kawhi and Paul George. And that\u2019s O.K,\u201d McCollum wrote. \u201cThose are two teams that are going to be great this year, and if we want to get over the hump and get to the Finals, we\u2019ll have to go through them. The Rockets may have gotten better by adding Russ. The Warriors are still as dangerous as ever. And the Nuggets and Jazz aren\u2019t going anywhere. Yeah, the West is deep. But the way we see it \u2026 it\u2019s also wide open. It\u2019s ours for the taking. I mean, if we start this season off the way we know we can, and then we get Nurk Fever back? There\u2019s no telling where this team can go.\u201d In his piece, McCollum explained his deep connection with Portland and its fans, which are some of the most loyal and generational in the NBA. He wasn\u2019t shy about proclaiming Portland having a place at the table with other contenders. \u201cI think that in past years, we might have been a little hesitant to say that we\u2019re trying to win a championship. We\u2019ve always had that mindset, but we\u2019ve never been very vocal about it,\u201d McCollum wrote. \u201cI guess it\u2019s because outside of Portland and in the media, people haven\u2019t put us in that conversation. So it\u2019s like \u2026 nobody had given us permission. Well, I can tell you right now that we don\u2019t need permission. Our goal is to win a championship. Not to build toward it, but to make it to the NBA Finals, and win the whole thing. We\u2019ve put the work in. We know what it takes, and we know what we have.\u201d Portland\u2019s 2019 playoff run began with a first-round upset of the more-favored Oklahoma City Thunder , a team that featured George and Westbrook. From there, the Blazers rallied in Game 7 in Denver to upset the Nuggets in the West semis (a game fueled largely by McCollum). Portland was then swept in the West finals by the Golden State Warriors, but emerged confident it had a legit shot as a title contender for years to come. \u201cWe have the right team, the right coach, the right mindset \u2026 and the right fans.

The stars determine where they want to go and whom they want to play with. Last summer, two All-NBA players with championship rings \u2014 Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving \u2014 left contenders to join a franchise that hasn\u2019t won a playoff series since 2014 . One free agent \u2014 Jimmy Butler \u2014 chose to join a team (Miami) that, at the time, didn\u2019t have the cap space to sign him. Still another player \u2014 Paul George \u2014 forced a trade one year after signing a four-year contract . Since the Nets hired Sean Marks in February of 2016 , the general manager has done nearly everything right in getting them the point where they would appeal to veteran stars like Durant and Irving. One of the decisions he nailed was his choice for the Nets coach three years ago. Kenny Atkinson was clearly the right guy for the first three years of the Nets\u2019 rebirth. Marks grabbed Spencer Dinwiddie and Joe Harris out of the NBA recycle bin in 2016. From there, Atkinson and his staff turned Dinwiddie into a top-four finisher for the Kia Most Improved and Kia Sixth Man of the Year awards. Harris, meanwhile, was last season\u2019s top 3-point shooter . They turned D\u2019Angelo Russell, whom the Lakers gave up on, into an All-Star . Caris LeVert, the 20th pick in the 2016 Draft , was the Nets\u2019 best player in the 2019 playoffs and might have been an All-Star himself had he not gotten injured in November . Jarrett Allen, the 22nd pick in the 2017 Draft , has become one of the league\u2019s best rim protectors . While he was developing all those guys, Atkinson moved his team up the Eastern Conference standings. In each of his three seasons in Brooklyn, the Nets have been, statistically, better than they were the year before. They\u2019re one of just two teams that have seen an improvement in point differential per 100 possessions in each of the last three seasons, going from minus-7.4 in 2015-16 to minus-0.1 last season. (Note: Under Michael Malone, the Denver Nuggets have seen a statistical improvement in each of the last four seasons.) Atkinson was one reason why two All-NBA stars wanted to sign with Brooklyn. On media day, Durant said that he watched postgame clips of the coach when he was thinking about signing with the Nets. \u201cOnce I started getting comfortable with how he approaches his craft,\u201d Durant said, \u201cit started making me feel at ease, even though I never even had a conversation with him. I could just see it through YouTube and through the clips that he was pretty genuine about the game.\u201d Irving had a similar experience, as he told the YES Network . \u201cI\u2019m maniacal about the response of coaches or players when things get a little tough,\u201d the point guard said. \u201cHe\u2019s keeping it real with the players, with upper management. I said, \u2018I could connect with this man.\u2019 \u201d Watching from afar and being face to face every day, however, are two very different things. So too is developing young players who want to stick in the NBA vs. leading superstars who have already won championships. The right coach for the former isn\u2019t necessarily the right coach for the latter. After you become the team that stars want to come to, you could be the next team that stars want to leave. Acquiring talent also means keeping it happy. There will be no walking on eggshells in Brooklyn, however. Off the floor, the Nets do everything they can to make a player and his family comfortable. But Atkinson has learned from his mentors about not putting on kid gloves when coaching superstars. Before coming to Brooklyn, Atkinson was an assistant coach on the Atlanta Hawks under Mike Budenholzer \u2026 who spent 17 years as an assistant under Gregg Popovich in San Antonio. And Popovich was known for treating Tim Duncan the same as the last guy on the Spurs\u2019 bench. \u201cIt\u2019s just part of my personality, a little bit not afraid to be confrontational,\u201d Atkinson said. \u201cWhat I learned from [Budenholzer] is to really challenge the best players, be direct with them, coach them harder than you coach anybody else on the team. I do think it\u2019s part of my personality. I don\u2019t mind conflict and telling guys what I see.\u201d The NBA has seen confrontational coaches flame out pretty quickly. But by all accounts, Atkinson is not an old-school hard ass. When he challenges his players, they know it\u2019s not forced. \u201cIt\u2019s hard not to be motivated with Kenny, because everything he does is so genuine,\u201d says Harris, one of three Brooklyn players now in their fourth season under Atkinson. \u201cSome coaches will give you the rah-rah stuff and it\u2019s just for show. But it doesn\u2019t matter what Kenny\u2019s doing, he\u2019s trying to kick people\u2019s ass. \u201cHe\u2019s a competitor, and you can feel that. You can feel that when he\u2019s talking, when he\u2019s going through film, when he\u2019s talking about the Nets\u2019 identity and those things. You know that it\u2019s not BS. That\u2019s what gets guys going and why he\u2019s able to do what he does.\u201d Atkinson doesn\u2019t come across as a my-way-or-the-highway authority figure to his players but also says he \u201ccould be a little more diplomatic\u201d at times. After digging through film and analytics to formulate a game plan, he\u2019s not going to alter it to please his players. But he seeks their input more than their deference. \u201cYou have to collaborate with your best players and guys that have been in the league a while,\u201d Atkinson says. \u201cI want that input. I want that collaboration. But I also want to make sure that we make the right decision when we tweak something or change something.\u201d \u201cWe buy in to him, because he buys in to us,\u201d adds Dinwiddie, also in his fourth season under Atkinson. \u201cYou don\u2019t feel like when you make a mistake, he\u2019s like \u2018Well, the coaches got it right. Y\u2019all just trippin.\u2019 You really feel like we\u2019re all in this thing together. That\u2019s the most special part about being coached by Kenny and why I don\u2019t think that there\u2019s a ceiling on his ability as a coach.\u201d Marks shares the same sentiment from his position in the front office, having seen the buy-in for three years now. \u201cI think what we\u2019ve seen is a group of guys get behind Kenny,\u201d Marks said. \u201cI expect nothing [different] this year because he\u2019s a believable entity out there, which is great for our guys.\u201d Atkinson understands that things are different now. New players, new personalities, new expectations. The focus has shifted from player development to wins and losses. When Durant returns (likely next season), the pressure will be at a level he\u2019s never felt before. \u201cIt\u2019s a new challenge,\u201d Atkinson says. \u201cWe have our core values, our foundation of what we\u2019ve built. I don\u2019t see us varying from that nor me varying from my personality as a coach. I do think it\u2019s figuring this new team out, and that\u2019s an evolution. That\u2019s going to take time. \u201cIt\u2019s an exciting challenge, but I don\u2019t plan on changing just because the chess pieces have changed. It\u2019s a similar philosophy, figure out the players you have, and then put them in the best position to win ball games.\u201d At its core, the approach to coaching a team with championship aspirations is the same as the approach to coaching one just trying to take baby steps toward relevance. \u201cI think you have to be yourself,\u201d Atkinson said. \u201cYou have to be authentic. If you\u2019re not authentic, they\u2019ll see through that. Then you\u2019re in trouble.\u201d * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

That wasn\u2019t the only reason he came up short to Milwaukee\u2019s Giannis Antetokounmpo en route to his historic season in 2018-19 . Antetokounmpo\u2019s intriguing basketball life story decidedly played a part in voters\u2019 minds, many of whom are in the narrative business. \u201c Once the media, they create a narrative about somebody from the beginning of the year, I think they just take that narrative and just run with it the entire year,\u201d Harden said in an August radio interview with 97.9 The Box . \u201cI don \u2019 t want to get into details. All I can do is control what I can do, and I went out there and did what I was supposed to do at a high level. There \u2019 s only a few other seasons that anybody has ever done that before.\u201d Blaming the media is a cop out. But there is merit in Harden\u2019s assessment \u2014 that the media-spun narrative surrounding a player\u2019s candidacy for MVP has an oversized impact on the race itself. Every NBA MVP has had an underlying story that has helped push their case for the award along. Westbrook won his MVP the season after Kevin Durant left for Golden State in free agency. That season, Westbrook averaged a triple-double \u2014 the first to do so since Oscar Robertson in 1961-62 . Harden won his after finishing second twice in other bids (2015 and 2017). Antetokounmpo clinched his after turning in the finest season Milwaukee had seen since Kareem Abdul-Jabbar won the third of his record six MVPs in 1973-74 . Harden didn\u2019t complain about narratives when he won in 2018, so there\u2019s no need to throw shade at Antetokounmpo or others for doing likewise. There will be new players who enter this season\u2019s Kia MVP mix, which kicks off in earnest during this first full weekend of the season. We know the usual suspects: Antetokounmpo, Harden, Westbrook, LeBron James, Stephen Curry, Kawhi Leonard, Anthony Davis, Joel Embiid, Paul George and Kyrie Irving. But what about the players who should be on your radar in 2019-20? Here are five to keep an eye on: \u201cThe Joker\u201d finished fourth in 2018-19 , his first season as an All-Star and his first playoff run. His true breakout MVP opportunity is this season, now that he\u2019s established himself as arguably the best big man in basketball . Jokic must battle his own instincts to stay in the mix. He\u2019s a better passer than most of the league\u2019s point guards and would rather make the right play than chase individual glory. \u201cWhen you score, one person is happy. But when you [get an assist], you make two people happy,\u201d Jokic said. \u201cI\u2019m smart enough to know that two is better than one.\u201d Lillard\u2019s sixth-place finish in 2018-19 did justice to the Western Conference finals run he took the Blazers on. This may just be the beginning of the prime of \u201cDame Dolla\u2019s\u201d career. While many superstars have no hesitation about seeking the most desirable destination to play in, Lillard\u2019s devotion to Portland\u2019s quest will only enhance his case. Lillard is one of the best point guards in the league and if the Blazers challenge for a top seed in the West, he\u2019ll stay in the top of the MVP chase, too. Mike Conley\u2019s addition could unlock things for Mitchell. His opening-night performance proved that even when Conley struggles offensively, Mitchell can still dominate the action. A summer spent with the U.S. Men\u2019s Senior National team may have only boosted his momentum. True, teammate Rudy Gobert \u2014 the reigning Kia Defensive Player of the Year \u2014 is a fringe MVP candidate as well. But a hot start to 2019-20 will fuel his campaign in ways that rim protection and low-post stability cannot for Gobert. Towns hasn\u2019t been shy about his desire to be the man in the middle of the Wolves\u2019 franchise rebranding. Even as Kyrie Irving scored 50 in the season opener, it was Towns who was truly dominant in that game . He\u2019ll regularly pile up nights like that under coach Ryan Saunders, who has embraced the increased leadership role Town has sought this season. The talent has never been in question concerning Towns \u2014 now he can showcase, too. While most of the summer\u2019s high-profile free agents went one way, the always \u2013 interesting Butler did not. Given his track record of believing in the power of Jimmy, it shouldn\u2019t have surprised us that Butler bet on himself in Miami . While it might seem like a strange choice on the surface, it might end up being a genius move if a scrappy Heat team rises in the ranks of the Eastern Conference . If nothing else, Butler will have plenty of opportunities this season to prove his elite two-way skills . * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

How about an encore, Kyrie?:  The Nets nearly won an OT thriller on Wednesday night thanks to a 50-point game from Kyrie Irving . Brooklyn is 0-1, but is back at home again as the Nets are hosting the crosstown-rival Knicks tonight. Best of all, you can catch it for free on League Pass ( 7:30 ET ). 2. Big one in the East tonight: Pascal Siakam ( 34 points, 18 rebounds ) was fantastic in the Raptors\u2019 season-opening win on Tuesday. His crew visits the Boston Celtics ( 7 ET, League Pass ), who have designs on being in the East\u2019s upper crust when it\u2019s all said and done. Will Siakam flash his go-to guy skills once again? 3. The KAT is ready to pounce: Lost in that Nets\/Kyrie storyline is the team (Timberwolves) and the player (Karl-Anthony Towns) who ran wild. Towns dropped 36 points and 14 rebounds on Brooklyn Wednesday and faces a decidedly thinner Charlotte Hornets frontline tonight ( 7 ET, League Pass ). 4. Luka & Porzingis show in Big Easy: This new duo in Dallas can get shots up (they had 35 of Dallas\u2019 76 FGAs in their season-opener). The Pelicans, who host the Mavs tonight ( 8 ET, ESPN ), have to keep Doncic and Porzingis from the mid-range (where they were pretty effective on Wednesday ). 5. Times have changed for Phoenix: The Suns were a bright spot (pardon the pun) in their season-opening win vs. Sacramento as big man Deandre Ayton was decisive in the paint all game long. He starts his 25-game suspension tonight and it won\u2019t be easy for Phoenix as it visits Denver ( 9 ET, League Pass ). 6. A must-see West showdown: Can you think of a better way to close a nine-game Friday than two potential West powerhouses squaring off? We can\u2019t either. The Jazz visit the Lakers ( 10:30 ET, ESPN ) and you need to watch the defense : both squads had hiccups in their openers (but the Lakers decidedly moreso).

You might say the Chase Center , the new $1.2 billion home of the Warriors is, ahem, splashy. Perhaps this residential upgrade was overdue for a team that has dominated the NBA for most of a decade because \u2014 and this is no disrespect to Oakland or the charming and beloved Oracle Arena \u2014 the Warriors are finally learning how the other half lives. For far too long, they played champagne basketball while living in a beer hall. Of course, the question now is whether that previous imbalance will suddenly flip and reverse itself. Will the Warriors, weakened by injury and a big offseason defection , now play beer basketball while their well-heeled fans here sip bubbly from their flutes at court-side? That is a very real scenario facing the franchise as it begins life without Kevin Durant and, at least for the moment, Klay Thompson. The buzz and sledgehammer long held by the Warriors has been transferred in the NBA, specifically to Los Angeles. That\u2019s where one of that city\u2019s championship-quality teams, the Clippers, punished the Warriors 141-122 Thursday in the first regular-season game at Chase Center. It was about the worst opener a team could have in a new place, where is was competitive for about two quarters and rapidly turned into a lopsided loss caused by a performance that Draymond Green said \u201cwas sad across the board.\u201d The Warriors took the night off defensively, making it impossible for Stephen Curry to keep pace with the Clippers even if he played by his own high standards (which he didn\u2019t). Curry had as many turnovers (eight) as field goals and saw constant double-teams because the Clippers didn\u2019t fear his teammates. By the start of the fourth quarter, the arena was half-full and whisper quiet. Warriors coach Steve Kerr emptied the bench right round the same time Chase Center emptied. When Golden State did that in years past, it was because it was conversely up big. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be nights like this,\u201d said Kerr, with a sigh of resignation. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a one-off. The last five years we\u2019d been living in a world that wasn\u2019t supposed to exist.\u201d The good news is the Warriors won\u2019t play the Clippers 81 more times. Still, Kerr sounds prophetic: This is likely the new normal for Golden State over the course of the next several months. It wouldn\u2019t be a stretch to assume the Warriors will grind much harder for wins in 2019-20 than they did at any time over the last five seasons, where they won almost 80 percent of their games. The fans at Oracle became spoiled by constant 3-pointers from Curry and Thompson and muscle poses from Green \u2014 along with two Finals MVP seasons from Durant. After Durant bolted the Nets, the Clippers welcomed Kawhi Leonard and traded for Paul George . In a curious twist of fate, the Clippers are now poised to strip the Warriors of Western Conference ownership. These Clippers are 2-0, notching impressive wins against the Lakers and Warriors, all while George continues to heal up . While he\u2019ll return soon \u2014 maybe even in the next two weeks \u2014 Thompson could miss the season recovering from his torn left ACL . That puts much of the load on Curry. The former two-time Kia MVP is one of three Warriors remaining from their five straight conference-title and three NBA-title teams (Thompson and Green are the others) and is being handed a massive challenge. Curry will undoubtedly have the green light to shoot often, and also must develop a comfort zone with newcomer D\u2019Angelo Russell until Thompson heals. Curry, though, will see even more swarming defenders and his supporting cast is young, inexperienced and brings light resumes. Gone are Andre Iguodalam Shaun Livingston and David West. Say hello and introduce yourself to Glen Robinson III, Marquese Criss and Eric Paschall. The Warriors have nine players who are 23 and younger. Russell, who was a first-time All-Star in 2018-19 , is the most accomplished newcomer. Yet there\u2019s no guarantee he\u2019ll be on the roster past the February 6 trade deadline \u2014 that all depends on where the Warriors are and if their philosophy gets a re-do. \u201cWe\u2019re starting over,\u201d Kerr said Thursday. Lots of new pieces in the rotation combined with a typically rugged Western Conference means expectations have tempered somewhat dramatically here. Folks are realistic and wisely so. Making the playoffs, once a safe assumption for this franchise, is hardly a given this season. \u201cIt\u2019s not a good feeling to lose games, especially when you\u2019re opening up a new building,\u201d Curry said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about over-reacting to one game, but baby steps are in order. Turnovers, rebounding and our defensive presence in general are important. Our margin for error is really slim.\u201d The most important goal for the Warriors is not necessarily to win enough games to squeeze out one of the last playoff spots, but to preserve Curry\u2019s health by managing his minutes and games. Nothing else takes precedent over his well-being. Curry is on the wrong side of 30 and has a history of ankle tweaks. With tickets already sold for the inaugural season at Chase Center, this seems more like a bridge to 2020-21, when Thompson should be set to play a full year and the Warriors can reload. At least the digs are first class. The Warriors are back in San Francisco for the first time since 1971, before they crossed the Bay, when Wilt Chamberlain and friends played at the Cow Palace, an old barn south of town. Chase Center was built entirely with private financing and is owned and operated by the club. Peter Guber, the part-owner of the Warriors and producer of numerous Hollywood blockbuster movies, oversaw the design and flavor of the building with his vision. And the site is surrounded by office buildings and condos that\u2019ll cost a few trust funds to buy. The players and coaching staff are thrilled with the custom locker room, expanded wellness center and weight room and a connected practice facility, though there are kinks that still need to be worked out. \u201cI\u2019ve been locked out of my office a couple of times,\u201d said Kerr. \u201cWe\u2019re slowly figuring our way out around here.\u201d The same might be said about the Warriors on the court. To coronate the official opening of Chase Center for basketball, Thompson grabbed the microphone before tipoff Tuesday, walked to center court in a sharp-fitting suit, and welcomed the fans, asking for their support this season for a team that promised to play hard. The fans should expect as much as the Warriors certainly seem capable of burning calories. In their current state, however, anything beyond that will be considered a bonus. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

He\u2019ll get to grow more with Cleveland. Osman and the Cavs have agreed to terms on a four-year, $30.8 million contract extension, a person familiar with the negotiations told The Associated Press. The sides finalized the deal on Thursday night, said the person who spoke on condition of anonymity because the team has not publicly confirmed the deal. An announcement could be made Friday, the person said. The 24-year-old Osman has continued to improve for the Cavs, who began scouting the Turkish player as a teenager. The team sees him as part of their young core nucleus along with guards Collin Sexton, Darius Garland and forward Larry Nance Jr. Osman was in the final year of a three-year, $8.3 million deal he signed in 2017. He was eligible to become a restricted free agent next summer. His extension runs through the 2022-23 season. He averaged 13 points, 4.7 rebounds and 2.6 assists in 75 starts last season when Cleveland went 19-63. Osman scored 13 points in Wednesday night\u2019s season-opening loss at Orlando.

The flashbulbs popped. The beats thumped down the hall, steps from where the Milwaukee Bucks dressed prior to downing the Rockets, 117-111 . \u201cIt\u2019s sad to say, but we\u2019re not gonna win 82 games this year,\u201d said Houston coach Mike D\u2019Antoni. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a chance to win 81.\u201d The truth is all the Rockets\u2019 pre-game glitz gave way to Milwaukee\u2019s grit, partly because of an inconsistent performance from Houston\u2019s new star duo of James Harden and Russell Westbrook that led to Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Bucks leaving victorious in an opener featuring the MVPs of the last three seasons. Despite the setback, the Rockets viewed the few glimpses of greatness flashed by Harden and Westbrook as signs of what\u2019s to come. \u201cIt would\u2019ve been great to come away with a win, but I think a loss is probably just as good,\u201d Harden said. \u201cWe did some really good things out there.\u201d Not before doing plenty of bad things, though. While Harden and Westbrook combined to connect on just 9 of 30 shots, they put together a total of 21 assists and 23 rebounds as Houston surrendered a 16-point lead at the half that was built despite Harden making just two field goals in the first two quarters. Then, when Antetokounmpo fouled out with just 5 minutes and 18 seconds remaining after producing a triple-double (30 points, 13 rebounds, and 11 assists) with the Bucks leading 101-95, Houston failed to capitalize on the reigning MVP\u2019s exit.  Harden shot just 2-for-13 for 19 points (0-for-7 in the second half), while Westbrook led Houston with 24 points, including 16 in the final quarter , despite hitting just 7 of 17 to go with 16 rebounds and 7 assists. Harden and Westbrook also became embroiled in an animated discussion in the first half that was caught on cameras near the scorer\u2019s table. Westbrook downplayed the notion that the conversation was contentious, and both have said their friendship is more important than any potential bumps in the road they may encounter. \u201cThe animation is because we were talking about something, but don\u2019t deep dive too much into it,\u201d Westbrook said. \u201cLike I told you, there\u2019s nothing that nobody around the world, media, anybody [will] be able to [do to] get in between what we had because we\u2019ve had it for so long.\u201d The highlight of the duo\u2019s night came in transition with 7:42 remaining, when Harden dished to Westbrook for a dunk that put Houston ahead 95-91, while conjuring memories of their past together, seven years ago in Oklahoma City. The dunk wrapped up five straight points for Westbrook, while alleviating uncertainty for D\u2019Antoni, who said before the game in front of a sellout crowd of 18,055, he was curious to know \u201cwhat we\u2019ve got\u201d in the locker room. Westbrook banked a 3-pointer off the glass for his first bucket as a Houston Rocket. \u201cI thought Russ was a gamer,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said. \u201cWhen the lights go on, he\u2019s got that competitive spirit, then his athleticism kicks in. He\u2019s like a Rocket out there, no pun intended. I didn\u2019t know what we had before tonight. We can be really good defensively, we can be athletic as hell, we can push the ball. So there\u2019s a lot of good things. We\u2019ve got to tighten a lot of things up, learn how to use the bench, just a lot of little things like that. There was some good stuff out there.\u201d Some might say it started with the pre-game fashion show that the entire team seemed to enjoy. Harden vowed during the team\u2019s media day in early October that Houston games would feature a red carpet, and the current plan is to keep the tradition alive for the first three games of the season, before turning it into an event for only weekend games the rest of the season. On this night, Harden walked the red carpet wearing an all-white Helmut Lang outfit, while Westbrook hit the scene in an off-white one-piece jumpsuit with small splotches of paint dashed throughout. Now, it\u2019s time to make superstar chemistry fashionable for the Rockets. Harden and Westbrook seem to be ahead of the game. \u201cSee, we\u2019re friends, man. We\u2019re boys,\u201d Westbrook said. \u201cThat\u2019s the most important part. Basketball\u2019s easy. It\u2019s an easy game. When you care about someone and you want to see them do great\u2026even from a distance [in the past], me and James talked and texted throughout the year. We were both running for MVP. We both were in the MVP room. That\u2019s a blessing man. All the basketball s\u2014 is irrelevant, man. It\u2019s a brotherhood first. It\u2019s most important, and that\u2019s all I care about. So, we never disconnected [over those] seven years [we were apart]. We talked all the time. Right now, it\u2019s just easy. Basketball is the easy part.\u201d * * * Michael C.

Center Deandre Ayton was suspended 25 games without pay by the NBA on Thursday night for violating the terms of the NBA\/NBPA Anti-Drug Program by testing positive for a diuretic. The first overall pick last year out of Arizona, Ayton averaged 16.3 points and 10.3 rebounds as a rookie and was hoping to have a jump in production in his second season. He had 18 points, 11 rebounds and four blocks Wednesday night in the Suns\u2019 season-opening home victory over Sacramento. Ayton was especially proud of the blocks, telling media after the game that new coach Monty Williams had put a huge emphasis on defense and rim protection. But the good vibes from that victory have quickly evaporated. \u201cOn behalf of the Phoenix Suns organization, Monty Williams and I are disappointed in the actions by Deandre Ayton that led to his testing positive for a banned diuretic and subsequent suspension by the NBA. This does not uphold the standards and principles we have set for the team,\u201d Suns general manager James Jones said in a statement released by the team. \u201cDeandre has expressed his deepest remorse. While he is suspended we remain committed to his growth and development on and off the court. His actions are not taken lightly, and we are committed to ensuring that Deandre understands the profound impact it has had on the team, organization, and Suns community.\u201d Ayton was upbeat after Wednesday\u2019s win, giving no indication that he was about to miss nearly a third of the season. Phoenix had a 19-63 record last season but hoped for a fast rebuild with a roster that was built around Ayton and high-scoring guard Devin Booker. The team hired Williams as coach, signed free-agent point guard Ricky Rubio and re-signed talented forward Kelly Oubre Jr. The Suns also added rookies Cameron Johnson and Ty Jerome and depth in the frontcourt with veterans Aron Baynes, Dario Saric and Frank Kaminsky III. Now they\u2019ll be without Ayton until mid-December unless the suspension is reduced through the arbitration process. \u201cI want to apologize to my family, the entire Suns organization, my teammates, partners, our fans and the Phoenix community,\u201d Ayton said in a statement. \u201cThis was an unintentional mistake and unfortunately I put something in my body that I was completely unaware of.\u201d \u201cI do understand the unfortunate impact that this has on so many others, and for that I am deeply sorry. I\u2019m extremely disappointed that I\u2019ve let my team down. I will continue to work with the Players\u2019 Union (NBPA) to go through the arbitration process and am hopeful for a positive resolution.\u201d Ayton won\u2019t be eligible to return until a road game against the Los Angeles Clippers on Dec. 17.

Before the team faces the LA Clippers in the first regular season game at Chase Center on Oct. 24 ( 10:30 ET, TNT ), check out some of the features you\u2019ll find inside (and outside) the new arena. * * *  The stadium takes up four-plus city blocks in the Mission Bay area of San Francisco and features an exterior plaza (named Thrive City) for fans to gather, watch games and cheer on the team from outside. The plaza will include restaurants, bars and a 74-foot by 42-foot screen to follow the action if you don\u2019t have a ticket. Eventually, there will also be a 5.5-acre park on the waterfront next to the arena. The park \u2014 which is not controlled by the Warriors \u2014 is still under construction and may not be ready until next season.  Inside the arena, the atrium provides a stark contrast from the feel at Oracle. The open concept brings in plenty of light and provides space for fans to mingle before and after games.  The LED scoreboard is the largest in the league, measuring in at 9,699 square feet. The extra space gives the team plenty of room to display detailed statistics about the game, including effective field goal percentage, turnover percentage, offensive rebound percentage and free-throw rate.  The 18,064-seat arena offers plenty of food and drink options for fans. More than a dozen dining options will be available within the arena, including local standbys like Big Nate\u2019s BBQ (created by Warriors legend and Hall of Famer Nate Thurmond ) to new restaurants from local restauranteurs. The suites are the star of the show at Chase Center, which features suites on every level of the arena. There will be 32 courtside suites, 44 club-level suites and 60 four-person suites on the top level.  The Warriors\u2019 locker room also received a big upgrade.

But it also confirmed the Sixers could be incredibly disruptive defensively. The shortest player in their nine-man rotation is 6-foot-5 Matisse Thybulle, who led all players (who played at least 50 minutes) in the preseason with 4.9 steals per 36 minutes . On Wednesday, the rookie contributed to Kemba Walker\u2019s 4-for-18 shooting performance and finished with two steals and two blocks in less than 22 minutes. The Sixers\u2019 own offense was rough. Through three quarters, they had scored just 77 points on 78 possessions, even though they had attempted 31 free throws. They were 3-for-21 from 3-point range , struggling to find a rhythm against a Celtics team that had lost two of its most important defenders \u2014 Aron Baynes and Al Horford \u2014 this summer. \u201cHad our defense not been our defense,\u201d Sixers coach Brett Brown said, \u201cwe might have seen a different result. I think our defense, by in large, was what I had hoped.\u201d The Sixers managed to hold a nine-point lead through the third. The Celtics closed to within four early in the fourth, before Philly finally found some offense, scoring 29 points over a 16-possession fourth-quarter stretch that put the game away. The offense may continue to struggle as the Sixers figure out how to evolve without the movement of J.J. Redick and the off-the-dribble work of Jimmy Butler. They lack shooting, so much so that Brown used Furkan Korkmaz \u2014 who played 36 total minutes in the 2019 playoffs and has shot 32 percent from 3-point range over two seasons in the league \u2014 as his ninth man, in the hope that the 6-foot-7 wing can turn into a facsimile of Redick. \u201cI need to grow a bomber,\u201d Brown said. \u201cSomebody\u2019s got to emerge where they\u2019re lightning in a bottle, they can come in and go bam, bam, bam, and make a 3. Why not Furk? So we\u2019ll look at it.\u201d The Sixers tried spacing Ben Simmons beyond the 3-point line when his teammates (mostly Josh Richardson and Tobias Harris) ran pick-and-roll with Joel Embiid. Simmons didn\u2019t take a shot from outside the paint on Wednesday, but size helps on offense too, and the 6-foot-10 point guard got downhill enough ( once while spaced on a pick-and-roll ) to lead the Sixers with 24 points on 11-for-16 shooting. With Embiid being double-teamed whenever he tried to post up, nine of his 14 shots came from outside the paint. That\u2019s not a good number, and Embiid wasn\u2019t the only Sixer to struggle from the outside. The defense was plenty enough, though. It was also long and active inside (Boston shot just 19-for-45 in the paint), outside (keeping the Celtics from getting into their sets comfortably) and in the backcourt (where Richardson and James Ennis forced Boston into a third-quarter eight-second violation ). The defense is there and should continue to be there. Now that every player\u2019s heights have been adjusted in the official ledger, the Sixers aren\u2019t getting any smaller. But to get to where they want to go, the offense must eventually improve. And really, an ugly first game shouldn\u2019t be all that discouraging. \u201cYou see it every one of my many years in the league,\u201d Brown said, \u201coffense needs to keep up to the defense, because if you play hard and you stick to the simple rules and there\u2019s a high level of accountability early, and you have a team like I have with the length that they possess, then I would expect our defense to be quite good and our offense maybe not so.\u201d This certainly looks like a top-five defensive team, maybe the best defense in the league if Embiid plays enough games. League-wide, offense typically gets more efficient as the season goes on. The question for the Sixers in regard to their ability to compete for a championship is just how high the ceiling is on that end of the floor. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

The All-NBA point guard, acquired in free agency during a hectic NBA offseason, scored 50 points in his debut with the Brooklyn Nets. Irving\u2019s effort sets a new league record for most points scored in a debut with a new team. Irving did it with his trademark toolbox of dribble moves, contorting drives and physics-defying finishes. His between-the-legs, step-back 3-pointer put the Nets up by three with 1:16 remaining before the Timberwolves forced overtime. The only disappointment in his otherwise spectacular showing was his last shot \u2014 a spinning attempt that for degree-of-difficulty alone will earn plenty of play on highlight reels. The attempt itself, however, was off, allowing Minnesota to escape with a 127-126 win at Brooklyn. Despite the loss, Irving said the first game in his new uniform felt incredible. \u201cIt\u2019s a great starting point,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously, you wanted to come out and get a win in front of our home crowd, but we got another chance on Friday.\u201d Irving spoke to the crowd from the court before the game and briefly had to stop his speech when it appeared he was getting choked up. \u201cIt just hit me before the game,\u201d Irving said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t trying to get too emotional or anything like that, but I\u2019m just a Jersey kid playing for his home team. There\u2019s nothing like it. This has been brewing since I was in fourth grade.\u201d Irving\u2019s 50-point special ushers in a new era for the Nets, whose admirable rebuilding job peaked this summer with the free agent additions of Irving and Kevin Durant. With the latter out due to a torn Achilles suffered in the 2019 Finals, Irving will lead the team throughout 2019-20. His first attempt at doing so carved out a place in the record books, where he is now tied for fourth all-time in most points scored in a season opener.

NBA ALL-STAR HISTORY IN UTAH Salt Lake City previously hosted NBA All-Star at the Delta Center in 1993, when the Western Conference defeated the Eastern Conference 135-132 in overtime in the 43rd All-Star Game . Karl Malone and John Stockton of the hometown Jazz became the first teammates to share the All-Star MVP award. Malone led the West with 28 points, while Stockton notched nine points and 15 assists. The San Antonio Spurs\u2019 David Robinson added 21 points and 10 rebounds for the West, which overcame a game-high 30 points from the Chicago Bulls\u2019 Michael Jordan. This was the final All-Star Game for the Detroit Pistons\u2019 Isiah Thomas and the first for Orlando Magic rookie Shaquille O\u2019Neal. The Charlotte Hornets\u2019 Larry Johnson became the first player in franchise history to appear in an All-Star Game. Mark Price of the Cleveland Cavaliers won the Three-Point Contest, ending a three-year reign by the Chicago Bulls\u2019 Craig Hodges. Price would win it again in 1994. The Miami Heat\u2019s Harold Miner won the first of his two Slam Dunk Contest titles. Salt Lake City was home for the Utah Stars of the American Basketball Association from 1970-75 and hosted the 1973 ABA All-Star Game at The Salt Palace.

Anyone who ever played basketball has been there and done that. And Kawhi Leonard, given the choice of a lifetime, took Paul George over LeBron James and Anthony Davis. Sure, you could argue it was more nuanced than that. But that was the essence of the decision that shook the NBA landscape, because in today\u2019s NBA, superstar free agents value whom they want to ride with perhaps more than the money. Had Leonard teamed with LeBron and Davis, not to mention Kyle Kuzma, traditionalists would\u2019ve howled, 29 other teams would\u2019ve wept and the 17th Laker championship banner would\u2019ve been stitched and raised in advance. Instead, Leonard is with George and the Clippers, and the runaway winner is the L.A. basketball fanbase. The charged atmosphere at Staples Center for the City of Angels\u2019 dual-season opener was brought to you by Leonard, who wanted a challenge and has that now. Clippers vs. Lakers should prove unpredictable, fun and entertaining for the next six or so months. Such was the case in Game 1 and it should be the flavor all season, right until the final meeting between these two, most likely in the playoffs (if L.A. is lucky). Make no mistake, though: The Clippers are still chasing the lead in L.A. and Kawhi learned that quickly when he took the microphone just before tipoff, welcomed the home fans \u2026 and heard boos from the chunk of Laker fans who crashed the event. Even as Leonard scored 30 points in his debut in leading the Clippers to a 112-102 victory \u2014 doing so with George still on the mend from offseason shoulder surgery \u2014 it was done in a somewhat awkward climate. Only at a Clippers home game would visiting LeBron hear \u201cM-V-P\u201d chants \u2026 and roars from the seats whenever the visiting team scored \u2026 and encouragement and pleas for the Lakers during a fourth-quarter rally that ultimately fell short. Not only is Kawhi fighting LeBron and Davis, but also the Lakers\u2019 titles and tradition , and that can\u2019t be conquered overnight. But that\u2019s the beauty of Kawhi\u2019s decision: He didn\u2019t take the easy way out. A championship for the Clippers would be more monumental than being part of a stacked Laker team that crushes the league under its sneaker. \u201cHe\u2019s a dynamic player on both ends of the floor,\u201d said Clippers forward Montrezl Harrell, \u201cand we\u2019re just excited to be out there with him.\u201d Clearly, the Clippers wanted to use the opener to resonate in L.A. Patrick Beverley made that known by hi-fiving his teammates furiously and sneering at the final buzzer, as if this were a game in June instead of October. The Clippers were better and more emotionally charged the entire night, perhaps because, in their position, they had to be. What better way to jolt a city into delivering notice and respect? \u201cLaker fans were loud early,\u201d said coach Doc Rivers. \u201cThen I thought our fans and our guys took over.\u201d Even without George, the Clippers are the deeper club. Unlike the Lakers, who surrendered their youth movement to New Orleans to get Davis , the Clippers didn\u2019t have to strip down the roster to add a few All-Stars. Remember, they won 48 games last season without George and Leonard. Lou Williams, who averaged 20 points per game last season , had 21 points and seven assists on Tuesday. Beverley was once again a defensive pest, goading LeBron for a good portion of the game as he shot 7-for-19 \u2014 none of which particularly hurt the Clippers. And the Clippers\u2019 bench outscored the Lakers\u2019, 60-19. \u201cWhat I saw in our team was just overall team toughness,\u201d Rivers said. Meanwhile, Danny Green was the only source of outside shooting for the Lakers. The lack of outside shooting was a major problem last season for the Lakers. How many more times is Green, a notoriously streaky shooter, good for 28 points on 7-of-9 from deep? As the Clippers snatched control of the game and kept it, only then did they own the building along with the score. And about the booing of Kawhi at the start: Maybe Laker fans were angry at him for choosing the road less traveled and denying them a potential dynasty. After the Lakers swung the deal with the Pelicans to add Davis last July, there was an organizational full-court press to bring Kawhi. He met with ownership. He heard a pitch from the front office and coaching staff. There was a conversation with LeBron, of course. And with Davis, obviously. They all thought what most of us thought: How could Kawhi turn them down? \u201cI was surprised,\u201d Davis said. \u201cWe thought we had a chance. He made his decision. We did the best we could. They got a great team over there.\u201d Davis said his chat was what you\u2019d probably expect: \u201cHe don\u2019t talk much, so \u2026 He later came out with a statement that he don\u2019t like all the recruitment. So I don\u2019t know if I overstepped my boundaries.\u201d LeBron made his pitch, but refused to allow himself and his emotions to get carried away. In hindsight, it was a wise move. \u201cI\u2019m not surprised by anything,\u201d James said. \u201cI don\u2019t get too excited. I don\u2019t get excited until things actually happen. We had a chance. That\u2019s all you could ask for. When he went to the Clippers, that was important to him. He had to do whats best for him.\u201d Imagine trying to game plan against LeBron, Davis, Kawhi and Kuzma. That team only exists in the world of what-ifs and could\u2019ve beens. The reality is there is balance, finally, in L.A. basketball. In the past, when the Lakers were in \u201cShowtime,\u201d the Clippers were in purgatory. When the Clippers finally found relief and formed \u201cLob City,\u201d the Lakers were wheezing from the Old Kobe Bryant years. The two teams have never finished in the top-four of the Western Conference standings in the same season. Now they\u2019re both title contenders and, assuming good health and ideal playoff seedings, could meet in the conference finals. The season opener wasn\u2019t totally reflective of what\u2019s coming between these two teams, given that George has yet to suit up and develop chemistry with Leonard, while Kuzma \u2014 a critical piece for the Lakers \u2014 will heal up and find his role next to Davis and LeBron. The next time to take the basketball temperature in this town will be Christmas Day , and the forecast will be warm. \u201cI don\u2019t think either of us are where we want to be just yet,\u201d LeBron said. \u201cIt\u2019s only the first game.\u201d * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

But even with just Kawhi Leonard in uniform, it was still too much for the rival Lakers to handle in Tuesday\u2019s season opener. A change in scenery did nothing to disrupt the two-time Finals MVP\u2019s customary efficiency as he poured in 30 points on 10-for-19 shooting in his first game for the Clippers. The outburst helped spoil fellow franchise cornerstone Anthony Davis\u2019 debut with the Lakers and \u2014 perhaps more importantly for the perpetual second fiddles in Los Angeles \u2014 carried the Clippers to a 112-102 victory . \u201cIt was great,\u201d said Leonard of his L.A. homecoming. \u201cYou know, a lot of emotions. Before the game, last night, there were a lot of emotions, knowing that my family was going to be here tonight. I\u2019m just back here playing at Staples, in my hometown. It\u2019s amazing.\u201d The first of four regular-season meetings between these intracity rivals more than lived up to months of hype, with the Clippers turning back multiple Lakers surges throughout the course of an entertaining game at Staples Center. Leonard scored 20 points on just 11 shots in the first half, drilling seven straight at one point on a variety of trademark turnarounds and measured drives. Combined with 13 points from Lou Williams, the Clippers dropped 40 on the Lakers in the second half to take control by eight entering the break. Davis wasn\u2019t as efficient, missing 6 of his first 11 shots. But he also pummeled the Clippers inside to the tune of 12 free-throw attempts in 17 minutes. He finished with 18 at the break, while LeBron James chipped in with 14. No other Laker had more than six, however, as they struggled to keep pace with the deeper Clippers. It was more of the same in the third quarter, when the Clippers raced ahead by 14. But even after a monster 15-0 surge gave the Lakers an 85-82 advantage, the Clippers \u2014 following Leonard\u2019s lead \u2014 calmly responded to retake control over the final 12 minutes and cruise to victory. Davis, meanwhile, was nearly invisible in the second half. He finished with 25 points on 8-for-21 shooting.

The Raptors\u2019 2019 World Championship Rings were crafted by Canadian company Baron Championship Rings. \u201cThe Raptors\u2019 first NBA Championship is a moment that basketball fans across the country, and the franchise itself, waited 24 years for and we are incredibly proud to mark the occasion for the players, coaches and staff who made it possible with this stunning championship ring,\u201d said Larry Tanenbaum, Chairman of MLSE. \u201cThis championship made history and will be treasured forever as will this ring commemorating the achievement.\u201d The Raptors\u2019 2019 World Championship Ring is the largest NBA Championship ring ever made and the face features the Larry O\u2019Brien trophy centered over the iconic Toronto skyline, the team\u2019s NORTH chevron jersey logo, and the Scotiabank Arena.  The face of the ring is made up of 74 diamonds, representing the number of wins during the 2018-19 season, including one large diamond in the trophy to celebrate the team\u2019s first NBA Championship. Custom-cut baguette diamonds accentuate the iconic Toronto skyline. The outer edge of the ring features 16 genuine natural rubies along with the jersey numbers of the team roster and is complimented by a unique cascade of diamonds. Both shoulders of the ring are set off by the inclusion of even more diamonds, with one side displaying each player\u2019s name and jersey number, while \u201cWORLD CHAMPIONS\u201d, the NBA logo, and the Raptors logo complete the look on the opposite side. The inside of the ring features personalized messages unique to each player, a ruby set inside a Maple Leaf, and the Championship series scores. The 2019 Raptors\u2019 championship ring is record setting on many accounts: the most diamonds of any professional championship ring with more than 640, the most diamond total carat weight (tcw) of any professional championship ring with more than 14 tcw, and the largest single diamond in any professional championship ring with a massive 1.25 carat diamond featured in the Larry O\u2019Brien trophy. All of the gold and diamonds used to create the Raptors\u2019 2019 World Championship Rings were sourced from Canada.  As a Canadian company based in Windsor, Ontario, Baron Championship Rings was deeply honoured to be selected to commemorate Canada\u2019s first-ever NBA Championship. The Baron team is thrilled to unveil the Raptors\u2019 2019 World Championship Ring and the countless hours of meticulous detail that went into developing and producing such a highly detailed design. From working with MLSE and Raptors management to Kyle Lowry, representing his teammates, the Raptors\u2019 2019 World Championship Rings were a collaborative effort. \u201cEvery Canadian, whether a basketball fan or not, couldn\u2019t help but embrace this Raptors team and celebrate what they accomplished,\u201d said Peter Kanis, President of Baron Championship Rings. \u201cWe were thrilled to be able to contribute to the team\u2019s celebration of the moment by creating this very special ring with so many uniquely Canadian details. We also look forward to being able to share this ring with the millions of Raptors fans who want to own a piece of history.\u201d In partnership with Baron, the Raptors have created a fan collection of championship rings and commemorative items, available exclusively at RaptorsChampionshipRing.com for a limited time. The championship collection provides a special opportunity for fans to create their own customized ring to celebrate with our team. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just a ring for the Raptors. It\u2019s a ring for the city of Toronto and the country of Canada,\u201d Kyle Lowry said. \u201cThe details in the ring reflect things that are important to us and are symbolic of our Championship season.

When training camp opened late last month, the Warriors were holding out hope Thompson could possibly return sometime after the All-Star break . Coach Steve Kerr, in an interview with Logan Murdock of NBC Sports BayArea released Tuesday morning, says Thompson may not play at all in the 2019-20 campaign. \u201cGenerally an ACL for a basketball player is a full year recovery,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cAnd if it\u2019s a full year for Klay, that puts him out for the season. We\u2019ve kind of left the door open in case the rehab goes perfectly and the doctors say he can go. The reality is on April 1, that\u2019s the nine-month mark, he got his surgery on July 1. April 1 is nine months post-op for an ACL \u2026 it\u2019s unlikely that he\u2019s going to play this year.\u201d When the Warriors opened training camp, Thompson said he would stick to the rehab plan and that it\u2019s not worth pushing too hard too soon at this stage. Recovery times vary, but ACL tears typically take roughly six months to rehab, with additional time after that to regain full strength and mobility. \u201cThe last thing you want to do is rush back, especially for a player like me who wants to play \u2019til his late 30s,\u201d Thompson said. Kerr, who tore his ACL in college while at Arizona, told NBC Sports BayArea that he believes Thompson still needs time to fully heal. \u201cYou have to look at it realistically,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cI had an ACL [tear] in college, and I missed a whole season. Generally, an ACL for a basketball player is a full-year recovery, and if it\u2019s a full year for Klay, that puts them out for the season. \u201cWe have to prepare our young guys to fill that role behind him, and when he gets back, whenever that is, hopefully these young guys now are developed and in the rotation and ready to really be contributors on a playoff team and we can get better.\u201d Later on Tuesday, Kerr clarified his comments to say that Thompson hasn\u2019t been completely ruled out for this season. \u201cMy comment was very matter of face. I wasn\u2019t announcing anything. He\u2019s doing great with his rehab. It\u2019s still possible he could play,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cBut I forgot, with modern media, \u2018unlikely\u2019 is going to be on the ticker, OUT FOR THE YEAR and all that stuff. Probably my mistake for opening my mouth.\u201d https:\/\/twitter.com\/anthonyVslater\/status\/1186743241116246016\/photo\/1 Thompson has been around the team in recent weeks and following Sunday\u2019s practice, Murdock reports he stood along the baseline as players wrapped up individual workouts. One of the most durable players in the NBA, Thompson has appeared in 615 of a possible 640 regular-season games and set the team record for consecutive games played (214). Being out of the lineup and the flow of regular games has been a challenge for him, Kerr said. \u201cHe\u2019s bored,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cI mean, Klay loves basketball, he loves to play, so he\u2019s at the point in his rehab, three-plus months in, where his knee feels pretty good. He\u2019s not in pain. He can get out there and shoot around, but he\u2019s got to let it heal, and he can\u2019t run, he can\u2019t cut. So we\u2019ll see him in the weight room, in the training room, getting his work in. \u201cBut I feel bad for him. You never feel part of it unless you\u2019re actually playing and with the guys, and he misses that.\u201d The Warriors open their 2019-20 season on Thursday as they host the LA Clippers ( 10:30 ET, TNT ).

Much to the NBA\u2019s delight and, occasionally, its chagrin. If healthy, an NFL QB can flip a 6-10 season into 10-6. No one quibbles with the position as every franchise\u2019s focal point. I once had an NFL general manager tell me, \u201cThe most important player on a football team is the starting quarterback. The second-most important player is the backup quarterback.\u201d Yet quarterbacks also are frequently fragile, routinely roughed up and sidelined, rehabbed or discarded at the least opportune times. That can torpedo a career or a team\u2019s rosy five-year plan. NBA franchise guys check all the QB boxes: Visible, impactful and nearly irreplaceable. It\u2019s only natural at the start of this season to anticipate that one or more teams will lose the services of its No. 1 or No. 2 star for a month or two (or worse). Projections for the New Orleans Pelicans are ramping down after it was announced Monday that Kia Rookie of the Year favorite Zion Williamson be out six-to-eight weeks following surgery on his right knee to fix a torn meniscus. Williamson \u2014 that breathtaking 6-foot-6, 285-pound blend of size, speed and skills selected No. 1 in the 2019 draft \u2014 probably will face some challenges in ROY balloting if he misses the expected 25-30 games while recovering from this fix. (The fewest appearances by any previous ROY in a 82-game season was 50, by Patrick Ewing in 1986 .) Worse, the Pelicans\u2019 hopes of making the leap in the standings they\u2019d need to chase a Western Conference playoff berth already looks daunting. Navigating Williamson past this setback is struggle enough; finding ways to avoid future injuries to his lower extremities is an immediate organizational priority. The Pelicans have a lot of new faces this season \u2014 Derrick Favors, Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball, J.J. Redick \u2014 and return their ever-underrated guard, Jrue Holiday, too. But they have no one capable of filling Williamson\u2019s blown-out sneakers based on the buzz and performances of the preseason. New Orleans\u2019 2019-20 trajectory already has been altered. Which brings us to this: which five NBA teams are least capable of weathering an injury to a top star, followed by the five most capable of surviving such a predicament. We\u2019re going with playoff aspirants, mind you, since an All-Star or projected award chaser plucked off a likely losing team wouldn\u2019t hurt that crew\u2019s ambitions much. So as talented and important as are Karl-Anthony Towns, Kevin Love, Chris Paul, Bradley Beal and Devin Booker are, their presence or absence probably won\u2019t derail, respectively, the Timberwolves, Cavaliers, Thunder, Wizards or the Suns from their modest expectations.  Here in no particular order are the teams most, and least, vulnerable to what no one wants to see happen. * * * 1. Milwaukee Bucks: The Bucks have serious depth to their roster. They feel as good as or better about their bench than they did in winning 60 games last season . This, despite valuable combo guard Malcolm Brogdon\u2019s relocation to Indiana. But this team is built to play around Giannis Antetokounmpo at both ends. Any extended absence by the reigning Kia MVP would be like taking a loose thread on a Wisconsin-weather sweater and tying it to the bumper of a passing brewery truck. Plans for the East\u2019s No. 1 seed, a Finals trip, a championship could all unravel quickly. 2. Los Angeles Lakers : Conventional wisdom would say that when a roster boasts two of the top half dozen players in the league, it ought to be able to weather an extended absence by one of them. Except there\u2019s nothing conventional about this insta-contender the Lakers put together. Anthony Davis has a history of injuries that adds an urgency to this issue for them, while LeBron James\u2019 value out of the lineup got demonstrated in 2018-19 much as his value in a team\u2019s lineup was known before. The Lakers were 28-27 when James played and 9-18 when he didn\u2019t. Kyle Kuzma isn\u2019t ready to step up into either star\u2019s role, and the Lakers would be well-advised not to expect a return to All-Star form from Dwight Howard. If Davis goes down, these might too closely resemble last season\u2019s Lakers. If James, then last season\u2019s Pelicans. 3. Utah Jazz: What we said about Antetokounmpo up top? Well, the Jazz are similarly built around Rudy Gobert on the defensive end. Ed Davis was a strong below-the-radar addition, but no one else in the NBA has the impact as a rim protector\/mistake-eraser quite like Gobert. Offensively this is an ensemble, particularly with Mike Conley getting the ball in his hands to occasionally say \u201cno\u201d to Donovan Mitchell. 4. Golden State Warriors: One team can only suffer so much attrition. The Warriors figure to be better than some anticipate, given the departure of Kevin Durant and extended rehab of Klay Thompson (which could keep him out all of 2019-20 ). The upside to those events has been excitement about Stephen Curry returning in all his glory to the player who snagged Kia MVPs in \u201815 and \u201816 . There\u2019s no reason or room for Curry to hide his light under the bushel that enabled Durant & Co. to shine. If he were to go down for a month or more in what a lot of us imagine as a renaissance season, the depleted Warriors will sag with him. 5. Miami Heat: In the year of the tandem , the team in South Florida used the offseason to transform itself into another lone star state. Jimmy Butler is an alpha dog \u2026 and he\u2019ll be the first one to tell you that. He has been and can be an imposing player at both ends, and it seems as if his scenery-chewing personality should mesh with the hardnosed, Pat Riley culture. But if Butler were to miss 30 games or so, his absence would be felt much like it was in Minnesota after he was traded last autumn \u2014 without the sign of relief and bounce in mood the Timberwolves felt with his departure. 1. Denver Nuggets: There might be a tie or two across 30 teams, but no player in the NBA tops Nuggets center Nikola Jokic in the \u201cunique\u201d category . His passing ability and feel for the game, in a 7-foot, 250-pound package, are unicorn-worthy. Only Wilt Chamberlain among the league\u2019s historic big men ever posted season stats across the board better than Jokic\u2019s 20.1 ppg, 10.8 rpg and 7.3 apg . OK, so if the Denver center is that special, how would it cope if he were out for a significant number of games? With depth and versatility, mixed with the continuity that sets the Nuggets apart from almost every other team. You get the feeling that coach Michael Malone has had a restrictor plate on some of his guys, in terms of individual potential, in order to serve the group good. But that means Jamal Murray, Will Barton, Malik Beasley, Gary Harris or new additions (Jerami Grant or Michael Porter Jr.) could boost their production to ease Jokic\u2019s hypothetical unavailability. 2. Houston Rockets: Can a team lose a former MVP in his prime to significant injury and avoid sputtering to the side? It can if it has two of them. While finding the ideal fit of James Harden\u2019s and Russell Westbrook\u2019s game looms as the season\u2019s biggest chore for Rockets coach Mike D\u2019Antoni, an extended layoff for either would be a pretty familiar spot for either. Harden has flown solo in the past in Houston and Westbrook had that role in OKC. The biggest danger would come not from opponents but from undoing whatever strides had been made in blending their talents. Bad habits in March, for instance, could linger in the playoffs. 3. Indiana Pacers: The Pacers rate this high, in terms of playing in Kevlar uniforms, because they have done it. Losing All-Star guard Victor Oladipo to a ruptured right quadriceps tendon last January should have sent them into a death spiral. But they bucked up well, managing a 16-19 record over the final three months to finish 48-34 and grab the East\u2019s fifth seed . More telling, when Oladipo was hurt for three weeks earlier in the season, Indiana went 7-4. He remains their best player under contract, someone they\u2019ll have to do without for a while now. 4. Philadelphia 76ers: The Sixers\u2019 plan has been to plant enough stars in its lineup that the loss of one wouldn\u2019t really matter. They\u2019re not quite that bulletproof, but the on-time development of center Joel Embiid and guard Ben Simmons, added to the consistency of Tobias Harris, suggests an injury to any of them would be less traumatic than in the past. Even as recently as last season, the 51-31 Sixers were 8-10 when Embiid missed games and 1-2 with Simmons out. With so many stellar tandems dotting the NBA landscape, Philadelphia arguably has the best Big Three, and that depth of stars might matter. 5. Portland Trail Blazers: Not to downplay point guard Damian Lillard\u2019s importance \u2014 or, for that matter, his reliability (Lillard has played in 541 of 574 career games). This is more a testament to GM Neil Olshey\u2019s resourcefulness and coach Terry Stotts\u2019 resiliency in steering the Blazers through setbacks and allegedly dashed expectations in the past. They\u2019ve been able to shape-shift Portland to emphasize other styles and traits as needed. After losing center Jusuf Nurkic two weeks before the 2019 playoffs, the Blazers finished 8-2 and reached the West finals. In Anfernee Simons, they added another dynamic backcourt player to team with either Lillard or C.J. McCollum. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Per team policy, terms of the deal were not released. \u201cAs one of our longest tenured players, Joe\u2019s shooting acumen, playmaking ability and unselfishness have been integral to our team\u2019s identity,\u201d said Jazz General Manager Justin Zanik. \u201cWe are excited to keep a player like Joe, as his character and leadership are critical for the foundation of our team.\u201d Ingles (6-7, 220, Australia) is entering his sixth NBA season, all with Utah, owning career averages of 8.0 points on 44.7 percent from the field and 40.8 percent from three, 3.4 assists, 3.1 rebounds and 1.0 steals in 406 games (223 starts). He has played in 304-straight games dating back to the 2015-16 season, which is the current longest streak in the NBA. The Adelaide, Australia native currently ranks third all-time in Jazz three-point field goals made with 669, setting a franchise single-season record in 2017-18 with 204 threes and also holds the second-place spot with 189 made in 2018-19. He is one of only seven active NBA players to have hit over 650 threes while shooting over 40 percent from beyond the arc (Stephen Curry, Kyle Korver, Klay Thompson, J.J. Redick, Danny Green and CJ McCollum). In 2018-19, the second-longest tenured Jazzman handed out the most assists among Jazz players with 469 and since he entered the League in 2014-15, he\u2019s tallied the eighth most assists among forwards with 1,364. Last season he averaged career highs in points per game (12.1), assists per game (5.7) and tied a career high in steals per game (1.2). Considered one of the best Australian players of all-time, Ingles has also played professionally since the age of 18 in Australia, Spain and Israel and has represented the Australian National Team in the FIBA World Cup (2019, 2014, and 2010), as well as the Olympics (2016, 2012 and 2008). Ingles started his professional career with the South Dragons of the National Basketball League (NBL), where he earned Rookie of the Year honors in 2007. He played for the Dragons for three seasons, earning All-NBL Third Team in 2009 as the team captured the NBL Championship. He spent the 2013-14 season with Maccabi Tel Aviv of the Israeli Premier League and helped Maccabi to win the Euroleague Championship. Ingles played three seasons for FC Barcelona (2010-13) of the Liga ACB.

The team confirmed the deal on Monday afternoon. ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski and Sam Amick of The Athletic both report the Kings and Hield agreed to a four-year, $86 million deal today. With incentives and other bonuses, however, Hield could make an additional $20 million over the course of the deal. Most of the incentives in Hield\u2019s contract are team-based, including things such as All-Star and Finals appearances. His salary declines 8% year over year, and is slated to take up just 13.5% of the salary cap in his fourth year, Amick reports. Chris Haynes of Yahoo Sports reports there are no team or player options attached to Hield\u2019s extension. Over the summer, the Kings re-signed forward Harrison Barnes to a reported four-year, $85 million deal . The Kings were somewhat busy in the offseason , signing veterans Cory Joseph, Trevor Ariza, Richaun Holmes and Dewayne Dedmon in free agency to round out a core led by Hield, De\u2019Aaron Fox and Bogdan Bogdanovic. Bogdanovic is also eligible for an extension, but recently said he is taking a \u201cwait-and-see\u201d approach to sticking around with Sacramento. The Kings acquired Hield in a 2017 trade with the New Orleans Pelicans that sent the former No. 6 overall pick of the 2016 draft to Sacramento for All-Star center DeMarcus Cousins. He showed promise in his 25 games with the Kings in 2016-17, averaging 15.1 points and 4.1 rebounds per game in 25 games (18 of which were starts). Earning the green light in his third NBA season, Hield upped his scoring average from 13.5 to 20.7 points per game, the fifth-biggest jump in the NBA among starters. He also set a Kings franchise record for 3-pointers made (278 \u2013 the seventh-highest total in NBA history) and led the Kings in offensive win shares (4.3) and offensive box score plus-minus (3.1). Hield improved his efficiency in both catch-and-shoot (46%, third among players with as many attempts) and pull-up situations (37.1%, fourth). A year ago, Hield came off the bench in all but 12 of his 80 appearances and thrived as the primary scoring option against second units, while typically relying on teammates to set him up for spot-up opportunities. As a full-time starter in 2018-19, he showcased vastly improved ball-handling skills that allowed him to create space with quick step-backs and function as a secondary creator (a career-high 2.5 assists per game) alongside Fox or Bogdanovic. More comfortable than ever with the ball in his hands, Hield cut his turnover rate down from 11.3 to 9.2 percent this season despite averaging nearly 20 more touches per game."},{"id":31266,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/rookie-scale-contract-extensions-2016-nba-draft","date":"2019-10-21","title":"5 players sign contract extensions before deadline","content":" For players drafted in the 2016 NBA Draft, the deadline to sign rookie-scale contract extensions was set for 6 p.m. ET on Monday.

Originally selected with the 12th overall pick in the 2016 NBA Draft by the Utah Jazz, Prince was acquired by Atlanta in a three-team trade on July 7, 2016.

(AP) \u2014 Mitch Kupchak doesn\u2019t see the Charlotte Hornets being major players in free agency as they attempt to build a winning franchise in the post-Kemba Walker era \u2014 at least not right away. Instead, the second-year general manager said Monday he anticipates the Hornets will construct the roster through Draft picks and \u201csavvy trades\u201d during the season, while compiling as many assets as possible. \u201cWe will not be an active player\u201d in free agency, Kupchak said. \u201cI think we can build a culture here and get enough assets and have a promising enough future and really attract the kind of free agent you want to spend that kind of money on \u2014 but I don\u2019t think you can do it right now.\u201d So in the meantime, the Hornets will give young players like Dwayne Bacon, Miles Bridges, Malik Monk, Devonte Graham and even rookie PJ Washington extensive playing time this season as part of their No. 1 overall goal of player development after going 39-43 last season and losing Walker, a three-time All-Star, to the Boston Celtics. Kupchak said that will take patience, but he and owner Michael Jordan and coach James Borrego are on the same page. Kupchak said he won\u2019t measure this season\u2019s success in terms of wins and losses, but rather on how the team\u2019s younger players continue to progress. \u201cWin or lose, I want our players to play with energy and our coaches to coach with energy,\u201d Kupchak said. \u201cAs the season goes on I want to see improvement. That\u2019s how I\u2019m looking at the season.\u201d Kupchak said that concept may not be easy for Borrego. \u201cI am hoping he is better than he was last season,\u201d Kupchak said with a grin. \u201cAt the beginning of the season last year he took each loss really, really hard. Hopefully this year he will be able to handle the losses a little bit better.\u201d Borrego has yet to name a starting lineup for Wednesday night\u2019s home opener against the Chicago Bulls. Point guard Terry Rozier and center Cody Zeller are locks to start, but the combination of the other three remains a mystery. That lineup could include Washington, who has impressed Kupchak with his 3-point shooting in the preseason since being selected No. 12 overall earlier this year. Originally, the Hornets planned for the former Kentucky forward to split time between Charlotte\u2019s G League team and the NBA to gain maximum playing experience. But Kupchak said Washington has been the team\u2019s most impressive young player during the preseason and will likely remain in Charlotte, provided he\u2019s seeing 15-plus minutes per game. \u201cHe does have to play, and, based on his production of late, he will play,\u201d Kupchak said. \u201d\u2026 He has worked on his game and has turned himself into not only a big man that can be productive down in the paint, but in our game today he can also make 3s.\u201d Win or lose, Kupchak expects the Hornets to use a \u201cfast-paced style of play.\u201d"},{"id":31296,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/6-milestones-watch-2019-20","date":"2019-10-21","title":"6 milestones to watch for in 2019-20 season","content":" The 2019-20 season is set to begin and there\u2019s no shortage of notable stats and numbers to know before basketball begins. Here are six you should keep in mind once the regular season tips off Tuesday night \u2026 > NBA.com\/Stats: Even more milestones to watch for * * * The Los Angeles Lakers\u2019 LeBron James begins his 17th season needing 1,101 points to pass Kobe Bryant for third place on the NBA\u2019s all-time scoring list . Based on his career average, James (32,543 points) would need 41 games to pass Bryant (33,643) and settle in behind No. 1 Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (38,387) and No. 2 Karl Malone (36,928). The potential scoring milestone is just the start for James in 2019-20. He is poised to climb closer to the top in several major categories. Based on his career averages, here are some of his projected all-time regular-season rankings by the end of this season. On another scoring note, James is on the verge of becoming the third player to record at least 1,000 games of 20 or more points. With his next triple-double, Westbrook will pass Magic Johnson for sole possession of second place in NBA history. Westbrook needs 44 triple-doubles to pass Oscar Robertson for the most ever. Westbrook\u2019s career high for triple-doubles in a season is 42, an NBA record set in 2016-17 . Westbrook has also led the NBA in assists in each of the last two seasons (after James Harden did so in 2016-17). If Westbrook leads the NBA in assists in 2019-20, he would become the sixth player to win three consecutive assist titles. Last season, Harden finished with the eighth-highest single-season scoring average in NBA history (36.1 ppg), giving him his second straight scoring title. If Harden leads the NBA in scoring in 2019-20, he would become the eighth player to win three consecutive scoring titles. Gregg Popovich will coach the San Antonio Spurs for the 24th straight season, breaking a tie with Jerry Sloan for the longest tenure in NBA history. Sloan led the Utah Jazz for 23 seasons in a row . Since Popovich took over as Spurs coach on Dec. 10, 1996 , the number of coaches used by other NBA teams is 270. (That total includes head coaches who were hired in the 2019 offseason). Every team has had at least three coaches and as many as 14 in the Popovich era. Popovich has led the Spurs to the playoffs in all 22 of his full seasons on the job. With 22 straight postseason appearances, San Antonio is tied with the Syracuse Nationals\/ Philadelphia 76ers for the longest streak in NBA history. The Spurs last missed the playoffs in 1996- 97, the season before the arrival of Tim Duncan, who is now back with them as an assistant coach. When he takes the court in 2019-20, the Atlanta Hawks\u2019 Vince Carter will set the NBA record for seasons played at 22. Carter, 42, is the last active player drafted in the 1990s ( No. 5 pick in 1998 ) and potentially the first player to play in four decades (if he appears in a game in 2020). He is also close to joining the rare 1,500-game club. * = Doesn\u2019t include 2019-20 season Only three players have appeared in an NBA game at 43 or older. Carter turns 43 on Jan. 26. As the 2019-20 season begins, the Golden State Warriors\u2019 Stephen Curry is chasing two Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famers on the career list for 3-pointers made. Stephen Curry needs to make 78 3-pointers to pass Reggie Miller for second place in NBA history . Based on last season\u2019s average, the Warriors\u2019 star would need 16 games to pass Miller. At his current pace, Curry would pass Ray Allen for the top spot during the 2020-21 season. Curry ranks second in the NBA and in his own family in 3-point field percentage among active players. Seth Curry, now back with the Dallas Mavericks after facing Stephen in the 2019 Western Conference finals as a member of the Portland Trail Blazers, has a slight edge over the two-time Kia NBA MVP for the No. 1 position (minimum 250 3-pointers made). Seth and Steph rank third and fifth, respectively, in all-time 3-point field goal percentage.

The Raptors and Siakam have agreed on a four-year, $130 million maximum extension, a person with knowledge of the situation told The Associated Press on Saturday, speaking on condition of anonymity because the signing has not been publicly announced. ESPN first reported the agreement . The team on Monday officially announced the pact, with Raptors GM Bobby Webster saying in a team statement: \u201cPascal has been relentless in everything he has achieved. He has embraced our development philosophies from Day One, he\u2019s one of us and a unique talent. He has improved himself every season without cutting any corners. He is a testament to hard work paying off and we\u2019re thrilled that he will continue his career here in Toronto.\u201d Siakam was a breakout player \u2014 and the league\u2019s Kia Most Improved Player \u2014 last season for the NBA champions, averaging career highs of 16.9 points, 6.9 rebounds and 3.1 assists. He is entering his fourth season and now is under contract to the Raptors through the 2023-24 season. Siakam was even better for the Raptors in the playoffs last spring, averaging 19 points and 7.1 rebounds in 24 games as Toronto went on to win its first title. During the offseason, Siakam said he still believes his best basketball is ahead of him. \u201cI don\u2019t feel no limits at all,\u201d Siakam said. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s only the beginning for me and there is so much more to come. I\u2019m just excited about the future and the possibility to even get better and better from this, and knowing that it\u2019s only been three years. I\u2019m in the league for three years and there is so much more growth and things that I can improve on \u2026 so I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to stop now.\u201d Siakam\u2019s rise has been meteoric. He grew up as a soccer player in his native Cameroon before being steered toward basketball \u2013 first getting noticed at a Basketball Without Borders camp in South Africa in 2012. He made his way to college at New Mexico State, wound up as the Western Athletic Conference player of the year in his second season and eventually got drafted by the Raptors. In 2017, Siakam was MVP of the G League Finals after helping Raptors 905 win that league\u2019s title. And now he\u2019s a max player, set to make $29 million in 2020-21 and just over $35 million in the fourth and final year of the new deal. Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":31293,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nba-enacting-zero-tolerance-rules-fan-behavior","date":"2019-10-21","title":"NBA enacting zero-tolerance rules for abusive, hateful fan behavior","content":" About a dozen NBA players gathered for a teleconference with officials in the league office this summer, making their case about what they believe is one of the biggest problems in the game. Fan behavior, they said, is getting worse. The numbers show they\u2019re right, and if that isn\u2019t troubling enough race only adds to the complexity of the issue: Most NBA players are black, and it seems like most of those in the closest seats are white. Not every incident is racially motivated, though some clearly are. After high-profile incidents involving Russell Westbrook, DeMarcus Cousins, Kyle Lowry and others last season \u2014 including ones involving racist taunts \u2014 zero tolerance for abusive or hateful behavior is now to become the NBA\u2019s policy going forward. The league is changing and toughening its code of conduct for fans, especially putting those in closest proximity to the players and the court on alert that anything over the line will lead to ejections and possibly more. \u201cWe\u2019ve added any sexist language or LGBTQ language, any denigrating language in that way, anything that is non-basketball related,\u201d said Jerome Pickett, the NBA\u2019s executive vice president and chief security officer. \u201cSo \u2018your mother\u2019 comments, talking about your family, talking about test scores, anything non-basketball related, we\u2019ve added that in as well as being something that we will go and pull a fan out of the seat and investigate what happened.\u201d Westbrook and Cousins were subjected to racist taunts in Salt Lake City and Boston and the fans involved in those incidents were banned by the Jazz and Celtics. Lowry was shoved by a minority partner of the Golden State Warriors\u2019 ownership group, seated courtside during the NBA Finals, and that person was banned from team business for a year by the league. There were more. Those were just the highest-profile ones. The NBA would not release exact numbers \u2014 and the totals are believed to be very low \u2014 but Pickett said the ejections of fans in the courtside area still more than doubled last season. Westbrook declined comment for this story, saying through a Rockets official that he was not comfortable discussing the matter. But the players\u2019 union insists that the problem is getting bigger and bigger. \u201cLast season, I began to sense even at the games I was attending that there was a certain, I\u2019ll call it absence of civility, that permeated the games,\u201d said Michele Roberts, the executive director of the National Basketball Players Association. \u201cI was seeing more bad-mouthing opposing teams that were not simply \u2018you suck,\u2019 which every one of us will tolerate, but really nasty, nasty comments being directed at players.\u201d The Celtics banned a fan for two years for directing racist chants at Cousins. Westbrook was involved in a pair of incidents in Utah that came to light last season; was offended by a fan during the 2018 playoffs by a fan calling him \u201cboy\u201d before a playoff game, and then last season was involved in a back-and-forth shouting match with another fan. The Jazz banned both fans for life, and Westbrook was fined $25,000 by the NBA for threatening the fan involved in last season\u2019s incident. \u201cI try very hard not to have my default answer be, \u2018It\u2019s racism.\u2019 I really do because I don\u2019t think that necessarily advances the argument,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cIf it\u2019s undoubtedly that, then I\u2019m happy to say it.\u201d It\u2019s not always racism, either \u2014 Roberts also said she\u2019s received complaints from many white players about being the subject of nastiness from fans. Amira Davis is an assistant professor at Penn State specializing in 20th Century American History with an emphasis on race, gender, sports and politics. She believes fans feel more emboldened now to say whatever they like, without fear of repercussions. \u201cThere have been plenty of sober fans yelling slurs and attacking players in the worst way,\u201d Davis said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a mix of all of those things and when looking at predominantly white spaces like Utah and a largely black labor force, it ratchets it up a little bit more and makes it a lot more intense. Particularly in this political climate in which it\u2019s very easy to project onto high-profile black athletes and pathologies and misconceptions about the black community.\u201d Fan behavior is not just a concern in the NBA. It is being noted everywhere. Racist chants and taunts are a major issue in European soccer, including at a Euro 2020 qualifier between Bulgaria and England last week. Green Bay and Philadelphia fans fought in the stands at Lambeau Field last month. The Atlanta Braves had fans stop doing their \u201ctomahawk chop\u201d during the playoffs earlier this month. During the AL Championship Series between Houston and New York, Astros manager A.J. Hinch told umpires that he felt the behavior of fans at Yankee Stadium had crossed the line and that it \u201cwas becoming a dangerous situation.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no place for that,\u201d Hinch said, referencing matters like debris being thrown from the stands toward players and taunts directed toward some of the Astros. \u201cBoth teams will agree. And it\u2019s really hard to stop fans from doing that. But it\u2019s also very dangerous.\u201d And the athletes are not always just victims, either. Golfer Bio Kim was suspended by the Korean PGA for three years for making an obscene gesture at the crowd during the final round of a tournament that he won, angry because of noise from a cellphone camera. In the NBA, the league is expanding the area in arenas most closely monitored when it comes to player-fan interaction. The top-priority area used to be just those seated with feet on the court itself or maybe the first couple rows of courtside seats; now, that area goes several rows deep in every building, plus the areas where teams and referees enter and exit the court. The fan code of conduct, a standard announcement at every NBA arena for years, is now being shown and promoted more times in each game. Season-ticket holders have been put on notice by teams that they may lose their seats even if they give their tickets to someone who goes over the line and harasses players or officials too vociferously. Fans believed to have been involved in incidents will be removed from seats while officials investigate; many times, when a security guard asks those in a certain area what just happened, no one would volunteer information with the suspected heckler present. \u201cI think players are definitely vulnerable,\u201d Golden State\u2019s Draymond Green said after the Lowry incident. \u201cAny time you\u2019re in a situation where you can do no right, like in defending yourself, you\u2019re vulnerable.\u201d AP Sports Writer Kyle Hightower in Boston contributed to this report."},{"id":31314,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/new-york-knicks-statement-edition-jersey","date":"2019-10-20","title":"New York Knicks unveil Statement Edition uniform for 2019-20 season","content":" The New York Knicks have revealed the team\u2019s third uniform for the 2019-20 season, inspired by the hustle and strength of the city and team.

A day after NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said Chinese officials wanted Morey fired, a spokesman for China\u2019s foreign ministry told reporters that no such demand was made by the government there. That becomes the latest chapter in the now 2-week-old saga over Morey\u2019s tweet that was quickly deleted but has led to considerable damage to the long relationship between the NBA and China. \u201cI felt we had made enormous progress in terms of building cultural exchanges with the Chinese people,\u201d Silver said Thursday during an appearance at the Time 100 Health Summit in New York. \u201cAgain, I have regret that much of that was lost. And I\u2019m not even sure where we\u2019ll go from here.\u201d That future seems even murkier now. During that same appearance, Silver revealed that the Chinese government told the NBA it wanted Morey fired. \u201cObviously, we made clear that we were being asked to fire him by the Chinese government, by the parties we dealt with, government and business,\u201d Silver said. \u201cWe said, \u2018There\u2019s no chance that\u2019s happening. There\u2019s no chance we\u2019ll even discipline him.\u2019\u201d But Friday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang rebutted by saying, \u201cthe Chinese government never posed this requirement.\u201d Geng said last week that the NBA \u201chas been working with China for a long while (and) it knows very well what it should say and do next.\u201cGeng did not offer further specifics. The league and LeBron James, one of its biggest stars, have been heavily criticized by some U.S. lawmakers for the perception that they caved to the Chinese regime. Morey has not been rebuked publicly by the league, and Silver has said that the league will support his freedom of expression. \u201cWe wanted to make an absolute clear statement that the values of the NBA, these American values \u2014 we are an American business \u2014 travel with us wherever we go, and one of those values is free expression,\u201d Silver said. \u201cWe wanted to make sure everyone understood we were supporting free expression.\u201d The Rockets were of massive interest in China, largely because of Yao Ming \u2014 the Chinese star who spent his entire NBA career in Houston. Yao is now the president of the Chinese Basketball Association, which has suspended its ties to the Rockets because of the tweet. Morey has not commented publicly since a pair of tweets on Oct. 6 attempting to clarify his position. \u201cI understand there is a point of view from some that we shouldn\u2019t be in business at all in China, and I\u2019d say from an intellectual standpoint, that\u2019s fair \u2014 not getting into whether the tweet or the response to it,\u201d Silver said. \u201cBut if people believe that we shouldn\u2019t be engaged in commerce in China or frankly in other places in the world \u2026 I, at some point, look to the American government. \u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of negotiating a trade agreement,\u201d Silver continued. \u201cMany multinational corporations do trade extensively with China. And if that\u2019s ultimately how our government feels we should be dealing with China, again, we are a U.S. company.\u201d Chinese state broadcaster CCTV did not air the two NBA preseason games between the Los Angeles Lakers and Brooklyn Nets last week. Tencent, which has a $1.5 billion deal to stream NBA games in China over the next five years, has also stopped showing Rockets games but has not totally dropped all NBA content. \u201cThe losses have already been substantial,\u201d Silver said. \u201cOur games are not back on the air in China, as we speak, and we\u2019ll see what happens next.\u201d Associated Press writer Christopher Bodeen in Beijing contributed to this report."},{"id":31346,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/dwane-casey-q-and-a","date":"2019-10-18","title":"Q&A: Dwane Casey welcomes changes to Pistons' style of play","content":" PHILADELPHIA \u2014 The Detroit Pistons haven\u2019t won a playoff game since 2008 . That\u2019s an especially remarkable 11-year run given that they\u2019re in the Eastern Conference. Last season\u2019s Pistons finished eighth in the East before getting swept in the first round by the Milwaukee Bucks . They had little financial flexibility, making them somewhat hamstrung in regard to making changes. Detroit did trade for Tony Snell before adding Markieff Morris and Derrick Rose in free agency. Still, if the Pistons are going to end that 11-year, playoff-win drought, there will need to be some improvement from within. Perhaps that comes from a group of young wings that includes second-year starter Bruce Brown and third-year reserve Luke Kennard. Charged with lifting the Pistons out of mediocrity is former Coach of the Year winner Dwane Casey, who is entering his second season in Detroit. His inaugural season came and went \u2026 and then he watched his former team \u2014 the Toronto Raptors \u2014 win their first NBA championship . NBA.com recently sat down with Casey after his team\u2019s shootaround in Philadelphia. The discussion addressed both his team and his process. * * * John Schuhmann: How different is the start of Year 2 than the start of Year 1 with a new team? Dwane Casey: You know the strengths and weaknesses of guys in certain situations, whether it\u2019s under pressure or whatever it is. You know what they can do and can\u2019t do. Working guys this summer, we knew what to work on. It\u2019s not just watching video, but you get to know personalities in certain situations. It wasn\u2019t easier , but we had a clearer picture of what we wanted to do. JS: How about the group as a whole? Do you have a better sense of the team\u2019s identity that you did a year ago? DC: Not really, because we got seven new guys. JS: But the core is the same. DC: The core is the same, but Derrick Rose is going to be an important piece. Tony Snell is going to be an important piece. Incorporating all those guys is going to be important. It\u2019s a little bit different. We jelled a little bit quicker last year, because that group had been together the year prior. JS: What is your summer process like, not in regard to player development, but in regard to the coaches planning for the season ahead? DC: You spend time watching a lot of film. I spent the summer watching our previous year\u2019s games, looking at our practice notes, and trying to see what we could tweak, what we could do differently, what we could add or take away, what didn\u2019t work. I spent most of my summer nights, after the family goes to bed, doing that. JS: How many of your 82 games did you watch? DC: I would say I probably watched 50 or 60 of them. And then the playoffs, but the playoffs didn\u2019t take very long. [Laughs] JS: And then you come into the office and compare notes with your staff? DC: We e-mail back and forth over the summer if we\u2019re in different cities. What do you think? Do you like that? I didn\u2019t like this , or whatever it was. So you spend the summer trying to prepare for the season. JS: And how much do numbers play a role? DC: Quite a bit. The PPP [points per possession] of certain plays. If it didn\u2019t work and there\u2019s enough of a sample size, we\u2019ll take that out. But my thing with PPP, if we got a great look out of it, we\u2019re not just going to throw the baby out with the bath water. We\u2019re going to make sure we know why [a play worked or didn\u2019t work]. If we got a good look, we\u2019re going to stay with it. JS: Do you study other teams and try to steal stuff from other coaches? DC: You do that. You look at what other teams are doing if something sticks out. I just don\u2019t go for anything. If somebody\u2019s doing something well, you may not know how they incorporated it (in practice or whatever), but you can see what they do well, what plays are run well, and that type of thing. JS: Do you go outside the box to refresh your outlook? DC: I talk to a lot of European coaches. I got friends over there that I steal stuff from, talk to, maybe have them look at what we\u2019re doing and say, \u201cHey, what would you do differently?\u201d. I might not take it, but just see what other options are there that we may be missing. An independent set of eyes may tell us something. You don\u2019t change everything, but you look at it and be open-minded about where you are as a team offensively and defensively. JS: There\u2019s not necessarily a template for you guys offensively, with Blake Griffin being a playmaking 4 and Andre Drummond being a non-spacing 5. So there\u2019s no simple formula for you to borrow from somebody else. DC: The one beautiful thing though is that Blake has really transformed his game to be a stretch 4, to be a playmaking 4. He\u2019s one of the better pick-and-roll guys that we have. JS: So you can play pick-and-roll with Blake and Andre, spacing the floor with three guards and wings. DC: Right. And Reggie Jackson is one of our better 3-point shooters. So that fits in well to who he is as a player. It\u2019s not Blake\u2019s natural position, but for a veteran, he\u2019s really worked at transforming his game. JS: You had the league\u2019s second most improved offense after the All-Star break last season, but that came with ranking last in post-break pace . Was that planned or did it just happen? DC: It kind of just happened, because we encouraged guys to push it up. One of the negatives with our two bigs is our pace. At the same time, Andre can pick his spots to run. But I still liked our offense, Even though our pace was slower, I thought the offense really picked up. Our shooting picked up. We got the ball where it needed to go. Our offense was more efficient. JS: So do you envision this to be a relatively slow-paced team again? DC: I don\u2019t want to be. It may morph into that. I want Derrick Rose to be able to push the ball consistently. We\u2019d like to do that. At the same time, I want make sure we\u2019re efficient, getting the right shots. I don\u2019t want to be a fast-paced team at the detriment of turnovers. I\u2019m seeing that in our first few exhibition games. JS: In regard to pace, you also don\u2019t have the long and athletic wings that other teams have. That may make it tougher to get out and run. DC: Luke [Kennard] is above average [in regard to length], I would say. Tony Snell gives us that a little bit and is an excellent 3-point shooter, but doesn\u2019t put it on the floor as much. But, you\u2019re right, our smaller lineup is smaller. But we try to make that work. JS: It seems like Bruce Brown and Kennard are handling the ball more in the preseason. Is that more about having more ball-handlers when Griffin is off the floor, or do you want them also handling the ball when he\u2019s on the floor? DC: That\u2019s the big dilemma we have with Luke starting. Now you have Blake, Reggie and he\u2019s kind of the third ball-handler. I feel like one of Luke\u2019s gifts is, other than his 3-point shooting, his pick-and-roll play. He\u2019s one of our better pick-and-roll players, but for whatever reason, our numbers were down when he started. So we\u2019re working him in. He\u2019s going to be a major player for us. And Bruce Brown has really improved in his pick-and-roll game. He did a great job in summer league playing point guard. He reminds me a lot of the path that [Pascal Siakam] took. He started and really wasn\u2019t a key player with the starting unit, but that experience that he got gave him a lot confidence. JS: It feels like your ceiling will be determined a lot by those two guys and how much of a step forward they both take, because wing play is so important. DC: It\u2019s huge. One-on-one play is so important for us. Blake gives it to us. Derrick Rose is going to give it to us, as far as creating off the dribble, pick-and-roll play. Those guys are going to have to take a step forward, like you said, to help us. And I think Luke has. He\u2019s playing with a tremendous amount of confidence for us right now. It seems like he\u2019s been here forever, but he\u2019s only in Year 3. * * * John Schuhmann is a staff writer for NBA.com.

Williamson was ruled out for the Pelicans\u2019 preseason finale tonight because of right knee soreness . Wojnarowski reports a severe knee injury has been ruled out for Williamson, but that he is expected to miss a period of weeks to open 2019-20. The Pelicans are, per Wojnarowski, treating Williamson\u2019s injury with caution to ensure he has plenty of time to recover. Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry told reporters Friday that he believes Williamson sustained his injury on Oct. 13 in the Pelicans\u2019 preseason game against the San Antonio Spurs. In that game, Williamson scored 22 points and had 10 rebounds in a 123-114 victory. Gentry told reporters he has spoken to Williamson, who is in good spirits about everything. Chris Haynes of Yahoo Sports reports Williamson will undergo further evaluations on his right knee today and possibly tomorrow. The team is relieved that he has avoided any major, long-term issues with the injury. https:\/\/www.nba.com\/article\/2019\/10\/18\/zion-williamson-knee-out-weeks New Orleans officials said Thursday that Williamson didn\u2019t travel with the team to New York, remaining in New Orleans to undergo further testing and evaluation at Ochsner Sports Medicine. He was to have played Friday night against former Duke teammate RJ Barrett, the No. 3 pick, in a nationally televised game . In his lone season a Duke, Williamson suffered a mild right knee sprain. That injury occurred when his sneaker gave out a few seconds into a game against rival North Carolina. Williamson missed three weeks with the injury, returning in time to play in the ACC tournament . The No. 1 overall pick of the 2019 Draft , Williamson averaged 23.3 points, 6.5 rebounds and 2.3 assists per game in four preseason appearances for the Pelicans. His absence may mean the Pelicans find an increased role for their other rookie, big man Jaxson Hayes , who was the No. 8 overall pick in the 2019 Draft. The Pelicans also have veteran big men in Derrick Favors and Jahlil Okafor who could both move over into bigger roles in the frontcourt while Williamson heals.

Beal still had two years left on his existing contract. The extension kicks in for the 2021-22 season, has a player option for the following year and means that Beal won\u2019t be part of what has been shaping up to be an NBA free-agent extravaganza in the summer of 2021. \u201cIt\u2019s a blessing, man \u2013 for one, that they even consider me a franchise player, a piece of this organization in itself,\u201d Beal said at a news conference in Washington. \u201cAnd I was prideful of that. You don\u2019t get that type of love and respect and responsibility from anywhere.\u201d The Wizards were willing to give Beal a three-year extension that would have been worth about $111 million. Beal went the two-year route and that protects his future options \u2013 he could opt out of the deal in the summer of 2022, coinciding with his 10th year in the league. The 10-year milestone is significant: By having that many years of service, Beal would be eligible to sign a new deal worth in excess of $250 million over the next five seasons. \u201cYou ask yourself a lot of questions during free agency: Why do people leave? Why do they go other places?\u201d general manager Tommy Sheppard said. \u201cWe\u2019ve always retained our free agents. The ones we wanted to keep, we did. And this is a humongous opportunity right here with Bradley Beal. It speaks to the rest of the league that he believes in this place, and that\u2019s huge.\u201d Sheppard told a story as the team was getting ready to begin training camp about what he says to young players he meets for the first time: Work as hard as Beal. \u201cIt sounds easy,\u201d Sheppard said. \u201cThen you come in and you see all the work that Bradley puts in every day, all the leadership he exudes every day. He\u2019s shown time and time again how committed he is to D.C.\u201d Beal has played more minutes than any other NBA player in the last two regular seasons, is one of only five players to not miss a game in that span \u2013 and is the lone player to have started all 82 games in both of those seasons. He\u2019s an elite scorer, 12th in the league last season at a career-best 25.6 points per game. And he will be the centerpiece again for a Wizards team that\u2019s without point guard John Wall for the entire season as he recovers from an Achilles injury . \u201cThis is where I\u2019ve been for the last seven years, going on eight,\u201d Beal said. \u201cI have an opportunity to be able to turn this thing around. A lot of people doubt that. I view it as a challenge.\u201d Sheppard said Beal is poised for yet another big year, and that the way he was interacting with teammates in recent weeks didn\u2019t give him any reason to believe he wasn\u2019t committed to the team. \u201cThe fact that he showed up in summer league and worked with our young players and watched what we were doing \u2013 he was so committed throughout the summer,\u201d Sheppard said. \u201cHe came in in September, had everybody out here working out.

After signing, Deng made known his intent to retire from the NBA. \u201cWe\u2019re very fortunate and humbled that Luol has chosen to retire as a Chicago Bull,\u201d said President and Chief Operating Officer Michael Reinsdorf. \u201cHe was a role model on and off the court during his nine-plus years in Chicago, and he gave everything he had to help us win. I want to thank Luol for not only what he accomplished on the court for the team, but also for the leadership he demonstrated through his philanthropic efforts.\u201d The two-time All-Star from South Sudan was selected seventh overall by the Bulls in the 2004 NBA Draft. In 902 games over 15 seasons with Chicago, Cleveland, Miami, the L.A. Lakers and Minnesota, Deng averaged 14.8 points, 6.1 rebounds and 2.3 assists in 34.3 minutes per game. He played in the postseason seven times \u2013 six with Chicago and one with Miami \u2013 where he averaged 15.9 points, 6.7 rebounds and 2.0 assists through 62 games. \u201cFrom the moment we made Luol Deng the seventh overall pick of the 2004 NBA Draft, the Chicago Bulls became a better team,\u201d said Executive Vice President of Basketball Operations John Paxson. \u201cLuol carried himself with first-class professionalism and leadership, helping lead his Bulls team to eight playoff appearances during his time in Chicago. We\u2019ll always remember his All-Star career and the fierce competitiveness he brought to both ends of the floor every night.\u201d > Sam Smith: Deng rarely face of Bulls, but always team\u2019s heart Deng averaged double-figure scoring his first 12 seasons in the league, and he led the NBA in minutes per game in both 2011-12 (39.4) and 2012-13 (38.7), both seasons in which he was selected to be an All-Star. Deng was named to the 2011-12 All-Defensive Second Team and the 2004-05 All-Rookie First Team. He won the Sportsmanship Award in 2006-07, but he was not only recognized for his steadfast presence on the court: In 2013-14, Deng was named the recipient of the J. Walter Kennedy Citizenship Award, an honor given by the Professional Basketball Writers Association to a player, coach or athletic trainer who shows outstanding service and dedication to the community. Deng ranks highly on the Bulls\u2019 All-Time Career Leaders list in seasons played (T-4th, 10), games played (6th, 637), minutes (5th, 22,882), points (4th, 10,286), field goals made (5th, 3,987), field goals attempted (5th, 8,675), free throws made (8th, 1,925), free throws attempted (8th, 2,490), offensive rebounds (9th, 1,109), defensive rebounds (6th, 2,969), total rebounds (9th, 4,078), steals (5th, 639) and blocked shots (10th, 360).

She stands under the basket rebounding and giving feedback to rookie guard Carsen Edwards as he shoots from different spots on the court. After swishing his final three attempts he jogs over to her. \u201cThanks, coach,\u201d Edwards says before exchanging a high-five with Lawson. Welcome to the new-look NBA, in which women\u2019s footprints are directly impacting every aspect of the game \u2014 from broadcasting booths, to officiating, coaching on the sidelines, front-office executives to ownership. Lawson is one of a record 11 women serving as assistant coaches in the NBA this season. While former WNBA star Swin Cash and Sue Bird are working in NBA front offices. \u201cIt\u2019s not a fad,\u201d said Basketball Hall of Famer Nancy Lieberman. \u201cIt\u2019s opportunities going to very accomplished women who have given their life to the game.\u201d While it may not be a fad, it is a recent trend. Lieberman remembers a time when the presence of women was hard to spot, or at best found only behind the scenes. The 61-year-old \u2014 who has broken barriers as a player, as a coach in the WNBA, head coach in NBA G League and in the NBA as assistant \u2014 learned quickly that building relationships was the skeleton key to erasing gender hurdles and opening opportunities in the league. That, along with an occasional assist from forward thinking men like former coach Don Nelson, who in 2009 hired her as the head coach of the Texas Legends, the Dallas Mavericks\u2019 G League affiliate. Several have continued Nelson\u2019s vision, including San Antonio Spurs Greg Popovich, who made Becky Hammon the NBA\u2019s first full-time assistant in 2014; current Mavericks\u2019 coach Rick Carlisle (he hired Jenny Boucek as assistant in 2017) and the Sacramento Kings organization, which has been responsible for hiring three women as assistants (Lieberman, Boucek and Lindsay Harding). Even the BIG3, spearheaded by founder and entertainer Ice Cube, is helping normalize the idea of women leading men, Lieberman said. > Game Changers: World is watching Spurs\u2019 Hammon \u201cI remember Donnie did an interview and he said, \u2018Maybe the best man for the job isn\u2019t a man at all.\u2019 He had a list of criteria he wanted to hit for his head coach. And I hit those,\u201d Lieberman said. The women who have broken into the NBA ranks are garnering respect from players for their experience and basketball knowledge. Celtics guard Gordon Hayward said Lawson has already made her presence felt. \u201cShe\u2019s been good as far as just the experience she has as a basketball player,\u201d Hayward said. \u201cReading the game and kind of little things she sees coaching on the sideline. Having somebody that well-versed in basketball, that experience is good.\u201d Earlier this month, Wizards assistant Kristi Toliver was on the court helping the Mystics win their first WNBA championship. On the sideline, Washington NBA All-Stars John Wall and Bradley Beal were wearing the Wizard assistant\u2019s WNBA jersey and dancing from the stands. NBA players are treating the feedback from Toliver and the other women in the league with the same reverence they give their male counterparts. \u201cThe biggest thing I learned is to share your voice and what you\u2019ve learned,\u201d Toliver said. \u201cDoing that has helped me communicate with my guys.\u201d Toliver is in a unique salary situation since she coaches for the Washington Wizards and plays for the Washington Mystics \u2014 both owned by same franchise. She was only paid about $10,000 with the Wizards last year because of WNBA salary cap rules. WNBA teams can only pay all their players a combined $50,000 in offseason to supplement pay and Washington only had $10,000 left to pay Toliver.  There are no such hiccups in New Orleans, where Pelicans guard Frank Jackson said he always expected to benefit from Cash and Teresa Weatherspoon, who was hired as a New Orleans assistant this season. \u201cThey were ballers,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cThey were good at their craft and I\u2019ve taken a lot from both of them. \u2026 I\u2019ve always had open eyes and open ears to anyone who plays this game.\u201d The 21-year-old Jackson knows of the women\u2019s exploits because he has witnessed it firsthand. And he is not alone. The WNBA has been around since most players were teenagers, and is older than others; the league was launched in 1996. \u201cAs the years go on, they\u2019re going to get more and more recognition,\u201d said Jackson, in his third year out of Duke. \u201cGirls can hoop, too. \u2026 I just think as times change, you\u2019ll see more and more.\u201d Cash believes the NBA is realizing having more women is important to growing the league\u2019s overall brand, business and bottom line. \u201cThe reality is and the statistics prove it, is that having women included in your business helps you get more inclusion, helps you get the diversity you need,\u201d she said. \u201cDiversity of thought, not just Black, White, Asian, Latino, whatever.\u201d Stephanie Ready, a former assistant in the then D-League, said a big factor in the opportunities women are getting are coming because the younger generation of NBA executives, such as 76ers general manager Elton Brand. She said the new crop of hiring managers are doing a better job of recognizing what women bring to the table and as the older generation retires, it will get even better. \u201cSome people will age out,\u201d said Ready, one of the first women to be a men\u2019s assistant on the collegiate level with Coppin State and a former broadcaster with the Charlotte Hornets who now currently covers the NBA for TNT and Yahoo. \u201cBy that I mean the old regime of men who thought that only men could do these jobs.\u201d Richard Lapchick, who tracks racial and gender hiring numbers for the NBA, NFL, NHL and MLB, has long lauded the NBA as being the leader in gender hiring practices. He credits the leadership of Commissioner Adam Silver, who said the league needed to increase the number women coaches and referees in the NBA. Along with the record number of female assistants, five women referees will be working NBA games this upcoming season. Lapchick also believes the NBA will soon have its female head coach. Whether that is Hammon in San Antonio remains to be seen. But whoever it is, Lapchick said the move would go a long way in putting even more women in position to make basketball decisions. \u201cI\u2019d be surprised if it doesn\u2019t happen before the next season,\u201d he said, \u201cor during the next season.\u201d"},{"id":31317,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/anthony-davis-happy-lesser-role-times","date":"2019-10-17","title":"Anthony Davis getting used to sharing the load with Lakers","content":"Anthony Davis made his preseason Staples Center debut last night and got off to a balanced-if-quiet start in the first half . He had six points (on 2-for-4 shooting), five rebounds and four assists in 16 minutes \u2026 and the Los Angeles Lakers led the Golden State Warriors by 26. The Lakers would go on to win, 126-93 , as Davis finished with eight points, 10 rebounds, eight assists and two blocks (while sitting out the entire fourth quarter ). After the game, even Davis had to marvel at his playing a smaller role and yet his team have a win all-but assured by halftime. \u201cIt takes a load off of me,\u201d Davis said . \u201cI was joking with LeBron [James] earlier \u2026 this is the first time in a while where I can have five or six points \u2014 whatever it was at halftime \u2014 and we\u2019re up by 30. It feels good knowing you don\u2019t have to do much, everybody has a role, and when you have guys all over the board who can score the basketball, you don\u2019t need to do everything every possession. \u201cIt feels good to be able to just, you know, fit in. When the ball comes your way, either score it, pass it and it\u2019s kind of been like that all preseason.\u201d Davis, of course, spent the last seven seasons with the New Orleans Pelicans, where he was the focal point of the offense (and the top target for the opposing defense). Playing alongside James has given Davis more offensive freedom \u2014 even in the preseason \u2014 and allowed him to use his varied talents. \u201cHe has seen multiple defenders for seven straight years in New Orleans. He is able to read the defense. He can create for himself any time,\u201d James said . \u201cThere are not many guys in our league that can affect the game the way AD does. He can score, rebound and pass. He just does it at a high level.\u201d To Davis\u2019 point, the Lakers got plenty of contributions on Wednesday night as James (18 points, 11 assists), JaVale McGee (12 points, six rebounds), Avery Bradley (18 points), Quinn Cook (16 points) and Dwight Howard (13 points) all carried their weight. Lakers coach Frank Vogel expects the kind of harmonious production Davis and James turned in to be the norm come the regular season. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to always go through LeBron like it has with teams past, and it doesn\u2019t always have to go through AD,\u201d Vogel said . \u201cQuite frankly, even when those guys are out, I love the role players that we have and their ability to carry the load as well. Whether it\u2019s having two lob threats, and playing the spread game. We\u2019ve got a number of shooters out there that can make you pay when we force help, and there\u2019s a lot of experience on our club, so hopefully the usage and workload will be spread out.\u201d"},{"id":31338,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/ap-100-points-no-longer-magic-number","date":"2019-10-17","title":"The NBA\u2019s magic number for victories isn\u2019t 100 anymore","content":" MIAMI \u2014 Getting to 100 points in the NBA used to almost certainly guarantee victory. These days, it\u2019s the baseline for even having a chance. NBA teams that scored 100 or more points lost more often last season than at any time in nearly 35 years \u2014 simply a byproduct of the offensive explosion across the league a year ago, and the continuation of a trend that probably won\u2019t be changing anytime soon. Scoring 100 or more only led to wins 58% of the time in 2018-19, according to a statistical analysis by The Associated Press. That was down from 62% the year before, 70% in 2014-15 and 75% in 2011-12. \u201cI think you have to evolve your thinking, your approach,\u201d Phoenix coach Monty Williams said. \u201cMy rookie year we played a game against Cleveland and the game was in the 70s and that was deemed a really good defensive hard-nosed game. The climate has changed and you have to change with it.\u201d The hard-nosed defensive game Williams speaks of \u2014 at least in the sense of what used to be considered that sort of game \u2014 no longer exists. Minnesota scored 140 points in a non-overtime game against Golden State on Jan. 16 and lost, becoming the first team in 27 years to score that many in a regulation contest and not win. The lowest winning score in the league last year was 89, by Memphis on Nov. 7, 2018 against Denver. Last season, there were an NBA-record 845 instances of a team scoring 100 or more points in a loss. Teams that didn\u2019t score 100 points went 64-385. \u201cAll the rules in today\u2019s NBA favor offense,\u201d Denver coach Michael Malone said. \u201cIt\u2019s becoming harder and harder to guard teams and individuals. But the bottom line is if you want to be a championship-caliber team you have to be able to defend and defend at a high level. The Toronto Raptors won the championship last year \u2014 I think they were fifth in defensive efficiency. You have to find a way. You have to get players to buy in and commit.\u201d There were only 64 instances last season out of 1,230 regular-season games where the winning score was below 100. Teams won 14% of the time when being held to 99 or less \u2014 compared with how they would win 35% of the time seven years ago. Some teams last season simply couldn\u2019t win unless they scored 100: Philadelphia was 0-7 when held to 99 or less, Golden State and New Orleans were both 0-8, Boston and the Los Angeles Clippers were 0-9, the Los Angeles Lakers and Atlanta were 1-10, San Antonio, Brooklyn and Dallas were 1-12, Minnesota and Charlotte were 1-13, Phoenix was 1-22 and New York was 1-28. Memphis was perhaps the \u201cbest\u201d team at winning when scoring less than 100 \u2014 the Grizzlies were 9-28 in those games. \u201cThe pace of the game and the level of skill, everything has gone up,\u201d Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said. \u201cYou\u2019re looking at it with respect to how much you score. The inverse side of that is what you can do to limit the opponent. And that\u2019s a big part of it. The more you limit the opponent and get stops, the greater your chances will be offensively.\u201d The scoring boom that went on last year \u2014 fueled by a seventh consecutive year of record-setting 3-point numbers, faster pace leading to more possessions and the NBA\u2019s crackdown to ensure proper freedom of movement on the offensive end \u2014 isn\u2019t likely to be a one-year thing. A year ago, 20 teams averaged at least 110 points per game. The year before that, only six averaged that much. Consider: Just seven years ago, teams averaged 96 points per game.

Things are looking up even more so for the Lakers as Davis will be back in the lineup vs. Golden State, coach Frank Vogel told reporters today. Davis said his injury felt fine during Tuesday\u2019s practice as he went through the full session in hopes of being cleared to make his Staples Center preseason debut. \u201cI kinda knew (it wasn\u2019t serious),\u201d Davis said Tuesday. \u201cI knew it was just a jam \u2026 it felt fine at practice today.\u201d Davis took some contact to the thumb a few times on Tuesday, which was what he wanted to have happen in order to tough it out. He said the plan is to see how he feels Wednesday and if he feels good, he will play. Per Mike Trudell of Lakers.com , Vogel had the Lakers head outside to the turf across the field from the UCLA Health Training Center before practice Tuesday. While Davis went through some stretches, LeBron James and Rajon Rondo took turns tossing a football across the field. Davis was injured during a preseason game in China on Saturday . The Lakers were cautiously confident the injury wasn\u2019t serious, and the MRI confirmed it. He didn\u2019t play in the Lakers\u2019 preseason game against Golden State at Staples Center on Monday night, but he took shots without protection on his thumb two hours before the game. Swingman Kyle Kuzma went through some tests after the team returned from its China trip and, after a scan of his ankle (stress reaction), it was determined that Kuzma could do on-court non-contact activity. \u201cThere\u2019s still progression to be had,\u201d Vogel said Tuesday. \u201cHe was very limited with what he did today, and it was all non-contact in limited duration. It\u2019s going to take some time for him to get his legs under him and build up to the point where he\u2019s playing live with contact, and then some time where we want to see him perform in that and respond well to that before we clear him to play.\u201d Kuzma will not play in the Lakers\u2019 remaining preseason games as he works to gain progress before the regular-season opener vs. the LA Clippers on Oct. 22 ( 10:30 ET, TNT ). > Season Preview: Los Angeles Lakers Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":31368,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/all-about-powerful-duos-todays-nba","date":"2019-10-16","title":"In today's NBA, powerful duo beats out 'Big Three' model","content":" In today\u2019s high-stakes NBA, a powerful pair beats three of a kind. Teams who longed to build a Big Three are now striving for a dynamic duo, hoping two premier players are good enough to win a championship when the belief used to be that it required a trio. And with some of the combinations assembled this summer, it sure seems less is more. That\u2019s certainly the thinking in Los Angeles, where LeBron James and Anthony Davis will try to power the Lakers back to the playoffs, and Kawhi Leonard and Paul George attempt to carry the Clippers further than they\u2019ve ever gone before. Houston is putting James Harden and Russell Westbrook together in a backcourt of recent MVPs, and Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant made the Nets the talk of not only New York but also the entire NBA on the opening day of free agency when they decided to partner up in Brooklyn. \u201cEverybody was looking for a Big Three,\u201d George said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t work for a lot of teams, so now this is a new dynamic for the new generation of this league.\u201d One that could make the NBA more balanced and exciting this season. If one team hoards too many good players, as Golden State did while reaching the last five NBA Finals, it leaves a lengthy list of clubs who have no realistic hope of contending for a title. But if it only takes a pair of All-Star players, that opens the door for teams who already have two, or have one and the assets to get another. The Big Three model kept some of those teams from going all in, but that era appears over. \u201cI think that\u2019s the way the league just went,\u201d Davis said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if it was done purposefully, but I think this is maybe the most exciting the league ever has been in a while. It\u2019s going to be fun.\u201d James won rings with two versions of a Big Three, teaming with Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh for back-to-back titles in Miami, and then rallying Cleveland to the 2016 championship along with Irving and Kevin Love. Now he\u2019ll try to do it with one fewer, which might be enough if the Lakers put the right pieces around him and Davis, who are two of the top players in the league. So are Leonard and George. Doc Rivers coached a Big Three to the 2008 title in Boston with Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce and Ray Allen, and the Celtics might\u2019ve won another if not for the Heat building a younger one two years later. Now he\u2019ll try to win with two, with a Clippers team that George thinks looks like many other teams in today\u2019s NBA. \u201cI think what Boston did was special. I think what Miami did was special,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think it goes back to you have two guys that are the guys and then you have a group around them that supports them to the highest level, and that foundation is around a lot of guys in this league.\u201d Though the focus has been on the tandem of twos, George said a number of teams could point to a complementary player and say they have a Big Three. Houston is one of them, coach Mike D\u2019Antoni said when asked the reason for the trend. \u201cA lot of it is media-driven in the sense of we\u2019ve got Eric Gordon. He\u2019s a superstar,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said. \u201cEric Gordon\u2019s as good as anybody in the league. So you focus on, `Oh, we\u2019ve only got two,\u2019 because that\u2019s the named two. But probably money and cap does create an equal system for everybody.\u201d Trying to afford three top players and keep them for long became even more challenging only a year after James and Bosh went to Miami, with the 2011 Collective Bargaining Agreement implementing severe penalties for teams who exceed the luxury tax. Short of players sacrificing salary, as Tim Duncan repeatedly did in San Antonio when the Spurs kept him, Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili together long enough to win four titles, it\u2019s almost impossible to get three stars and a competent cast around them. Even if the salaries work, the personalities might not. It\u2019s hard to keep three alpha dogs happy, as Irving showed by asking out of Cleveland, especially because one of them usually has to give up so much of his game so three isn\u2019t a crowd. \u201cYou have a guy that\u2019s used to being a focal point of the offense \u2013 take Bron\u2019s teams in Miami,\u201d Lakers coach Frank Vogel said. \u201cThere\u2019s more sacrifice I think probably to be had if it\u2019s a Big Three versus a Big Two, but that would be my two cents on it.\u201d And his two cents on the two-man trend? \u201cI think we\u2019ve got the best of them, of all the duos,\u201d he said."},{"id":31370,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/jimmy-butler-heat-hopes-soar","date":"2019-10-16","title":"JImmy's era: Butler arrives in Miami, Heat hopes soar","content":" MIAMI (AP) \u2014 Jimmy Butler wants this made clear: He is not in Miami to be the next Dwyane Wade.

The Western Conference is once again flooded with talent, but that isn\u2019t what concerned DeRozan entering training camp. No, DeRozan was not sure how he is going to keep pace on a fastbreak led by the returning Dejounte Murray. \u201cI just know Dejounte is fast as hell, so we\u2019re not going to have a choice as soon as he has the ball,\u201d DeRozan said. While the Los Angeles Clippers, Los Angeles Lakers, Houston Rockets and Utah Jazz remade their rosters through trades and free-agent signings, Murray\u2019s return from injury could be a key for San Antonio this season. Murray\u2019s defense and leadership were expected to ease the final transition from the Big Three era that produced five NBA championships to one that featured Kawhi Leonard. Instead, the Spurs suffered an inconsistent and enigmatic season after Leonard demanded and was granted a trade and Murray\u2019s season ended before it began due to a knee injury. Murray returns to a roster built to take advantage of his speed and playmaking. Coach Gregg Popovich has transitioned his team from a plodding, defensive-minded squad to something different. Entering his 24th season, Popovich now has the pleasure of adapting to a fast, athletic team spearheaded by players such as Murray, DeRozan, Derrick White and Lonnie Walker IV and centered around veterans LaMarcus Aldridge and Rudy Gay. \u201cIt\u2019s just fun to watch these guys come out and play,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cI\u2019m watching Dejounte and, my gosh, I haven\u2019t seen a guy that fast in five, six or seven years. His speed is incredible and then you see Lonnie and he might be faster. Seeing that speed and athleticism is going to be fun to add to the program. So, pace and that sort of thing becomes pretty important.\u201d The Spurs offense transformed from a more deliberate, relentless attack to a faster-paced one when Murray succeeded franchise stalwart Tony Parker at point guard midway through the 2018 season. \u201cI don\u2019t really care about scoring,\u201d Murray said. \u201cI know I could score but I want to make my teammates happy. That\u2019s one thing me and Coach Pop always talk about, make your teammates really love playing with you and that\u2019s something that stuck with me.\u201d Murray averaged 8.1 points, 2.9 assists and 1.2 steals while starting 48 of 81 games and was named to the NBA All-Defensive second team in just his second season. The lanky, 6-foot-5 guard spent the following offseason improving his mid-range jumper and 3-point shooting but never got a chance to show off the hard work. Murray tore his right anterior cruciate ligament Oct. 7, 2018, in a preseason game and had season-ending surgery. He seems to be at full speed and planting hard on his surgically repaired right knee to start a \u201cEurostep,\u201d proof of his recovery. \u201cHe feels confident and he looks confident,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cHe\u2019s not holding back or anything like that, so it\u2019s good he\u2019s being aggressive.\u201d > Season Preview: San Antonio Spurs"},{"id":31409,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/trae-young-atlanta-hawks-leadership-role","date":"2019-10-15","title":"Trae Young gladly accepts role as new face of Hawks","content":" ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 Trae Young gladly accepted his role as the new face of the Atlanta Hawks.

Some might argue Curry\u2019s 2015-16 season \u2014 the one in which he was the first unanimous MVP winner in NBA history \u2014 was perhaps the peak of his powers. Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr differs with that, though. Based on what Curry has done to date and his performance in the preseason, Kerr said Curry might be no better off in his overall game and physical status than he is right now. When asked Sunday what to expect from Curry in 2019-20, Kerr\u2019s answer was simple. \u201cJust the usual,\u201d Kerr said . \u201cI\u2019m not looking for anything different than what he\u2019s done for five years, but what he\u2019s done is pretty special: two MVPs and a perennial top-five player.

Gone from the lineup as well is former two-time NBA Finals MVP Kevin Durant, who left for the Brooklyn Nets in free agency over the summer. Curry showed that Kerr\u2019s assessment might not be far off in a preseason win against the Minnesota Timberwolves last week. In that game, Curry scored 40 points on 14-for-19 shooting (and 6-for-9 on 3-pointers) in just 25 minutes to pace a Warriors romp. Much pressure will be on Curry this season as he will carry a heavy load as the Warriors attempt to make a sixth straight Finals appearance. To Kerr, Curry is in his prime because he of all the past experiences and defenses he has seen in the league. \u201cHe\u2019s in his prime age-wise, strength and conditioning-wise and defensively he\u2019s seen everything that\u2019s come his way,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cTeams have played him every possible way that you could think of, and he\u2019s had years now to work on counters. So he\u2019s kind of in his sweet spot right now, and he has been the last couple years. And hopefully that continues for the next few years. But he\u2019s an amazing player.\u201d Curry will have more of a leadership role this season after the team traded former Finals MVP and fan favorite Andre Iguodala to Memphis over the summer. In an interview with ESPN, Curry said he will lead his own way in 2019-20. \u201cI don\u2019t have to change who I am as a leader,\u201d Curry told ESPN . \u201cI think it\u2019s more so just about awareness and understanding what this team needs specifically in the details to help us be successful.

To better familiarize himself with the Cavaliers team he was taking over, Beilein broke from the tradition that has assistant coaches working the sideline at NBA Summer League. When the situation arose in a game in Las Vegas for Cleveland to invoke the experimental \u201ccoaches\u2019 challenge\u201d rule , Beilein was the one calling for it. And the one getting shot down. \u201cIt was an out-of-bounds play,\u201d Beilein recalled during a break at the coaches\u2019 meetings in Chicago last month. \u201cMy player came to the bench saying, \u2018It\u2019s definitely our ball.\u2019 I thought, \u2018Great, this is why we have it now.\u2019 \u201cWe came back out. It was their ball.\u201d  There will be a lot of dashed hopes in 2019-20, as well as some pivotal reversals, with the NBA\u2019s adoption of the latest replay wrinkle . As in MLB and the NFL, coaches will have the opportunity to appeal, in real time, certain referees\u2019 decisions. All the \u201ctriggers\u201d of the existing replay system remain, but now the teams will have a sense of control. One time each game. \u201cI\u2019ve been a proponent of it for many years, just as an additional layer of security,\u201d said Dallas coach Rick Carlisle, who also serves as president of the NBA Coaches Association . \u201cIf a call\u2019s inaccurate for any reason, it\u2019s just an extra chance \u2014 particularly if the game\u2019s on the line \u2014 to get it right. \u201cThe question has always been, how to execute it. Where to start. Sounds like this is going to start with a high level of simplicity. Then we\u2019ll see where it goes.\u201d Denver Nuggets coach Michael Malone thought back to 2017-18, when the Nuggets missed the postseason after a loss at Minnesota in the season\u2019s final game . Like every game, there were a handful of what-if moments. \u201cThink about it,\u201d Malone said. \u201cTwo years ago, one play could have been the difference for us between the lottery and playoffs. That saves jobs, that gets home\/road seeding, there are a lot of things that it can affect.\u201d For this season, the challenge can be made in three situations : to question a foul called against that team\u2019s player, to dispute an out-of-bounds decision or to question a goaltending\/basket interference ruling against that team. The first type applies to the entire game; the others to the first 46 minutes (and first three minutes of overtime), after which the established triggers take over. Challenging a call requires the coach to first call a timeout and then inform the referees he wants a review. There are new court administrators at every game this season to help with the process. Also, fans will notice green \u201cchallenge lights\u201d at the scorer\u2019s table \u2014 the one nearest the challenging bench will blink. Beilein said he sought redress a couple of times in Las Vegas, without satisfaction. \u201cThey never reversed their decisions,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it\u2019s really a good idea to do, to let us have this say in a game. You ask, they review it. If they don\u2019t see it, you just move on with the game. It puts things away, so we\u2019re not grinding away all night on that call. It\u2019s over. It\u2019s done.\u201d If a call is reversed, the challenge is successful and the team\u2019s timeout is restored. If the initial ruling stands, the challenge is deemed unsuccessful and that timeout is gone. Win or lose the appeal, the allotment stays the same: One challenge per team per game. The early chatter among coaches has been, when is the best time to use it? In Sunday\u2019s Hornets-Celtics game, Brad Stevens and James Borrego waited until the final minute . Both challenges failed.  \u201cI\u2019ll probably save it till the fourth quarter,\u201d Lakers coach Frank Vogel said. \u201cI\u2019m going to be really excited about it when it helps wins me some games. And I\u2019m going to really hate it when it costs me.\u201d Said Malone: \u201cThe funny thing is, we always say, \u2018The game never comes down to just the last play. Something that happened in the first quarter was just as important.\u2019 But the reality it, when you get to the last two minutes, if you have the coaches challenge in your pocket, that could come up with a really big play or give you momentum.\u201d The refs\u2019 crew chief will have the final determination of fouls. He or she also will be able to \u201cclean up\u201d the play in question if, for instance, they notice the foul was assessed incorrectly or if a different foul by either side occurred before the one being reviewed. Note: infractions such as 3-second violations or traveling, if uncalled initially, can\u2019t be assessed in a challenge review. The league\u2019s Replay Center in Secaucus, N.J., will adjudicate out-of-bounds and goaltending challenges. At the NBCA September meetings in Chicago, the feature \u2014 also given a trial run in the G League in recent seasons \u2014 was discussed in a ballroom session with referees and supervisors of the officials. The next day, they all spent time on a basketball court, walking through the particulars. Borrego took advantage of his proximity in Charlotte to talk with Carolina Panthers coach Ron Rivera about his strategy in using the NFL\u2019s version . Those coaches physically throw a red flag to signal their challenge and have time to hear from assistant coaches in a stadium booth upstairs who have seen video to determine their chances of reversal. The NBA won\u2019t have either flags to throw or helpers checking. The coaches will have to alert the refs by twirling their fingers in the air, the current universal symbol for \u201creplay.\u201d They\u2019ll need to act before an opposing player is handed the ball to shoot free throws or toss it inbounds, or before a jump ball. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had this conversation with them yet, but players never think they fouled,\u201d Milwaukee Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s never out on them. We\u2019re gonna have to say, \u2018OK, did you really not foul?\u2019 Somehow figure out, \u2018OK, you have to tell the truth.\u2019 \u201cThat kind of feedback from them is going to be important in a challenge situation.\u201d The preseason was only a few days old but, in this era of analytics, Chicago Bulls coach Jim Boylen had his crew gather data on every early challenge. He\u2019s working up a list of situations in which to use it. Late in games? Sure. But not so late that the existing triggers take over for a disputed out-of-bounds play. Then the coach might go home without using it. \u201cYou\u2019re always concerned about [burning] the timeout,\u201d Boylen said. \u201cYou\u2019d better be sure. Your [viewing] angles better be good.\u201d Not everyone is a fan of the experiment, which will be evaluated after the season by the NBA\u2019s Competition Committee. Some skeptics fret that adding reviews will mean more delays in games that already have replay interruptions. Then there was Monty Williams, the Phoenix Suns\u2019 new coach. Part of his dislike? Genuine empathy for the referees. \u201cI\u2019m not a fan of it at all,\u201d Williams said. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s to your detriment, but I think human error is part of our game. I know we\u2019re trying to get it right, but sometimes [replay] causes referees to get second-guessed a lot. They already are. \u201cAnd this is just one more thing for coaches to have to do. Now we\u2019re all going to have to delegate a guy on our bench to monitor things.  \u201cIf we\u2019re gonna challenge, I wish it was a segment \u2014 say, the last three minutes of the game. I want to coach. I don\u2019t want to be focused all night on, \u2018Should I have challenged [a call made earlier]?\u2019 \u201d Fans might notice other rules changes and priorities for officials this season: * Coaches will be required to submit their starting lineups earlier now , making them public at least 30 minutes before tipoff. This change is seen largely as a nod to the looming arrival of legal sports betting. Knowing the starters earlier \u2014 and which regulars might be sitting out with injuries or for \u201cload management\u201d \u2014 means more wagers can be made with the most updated information. (A change still can be made if a player gets hurt or aggravates an injury during warm-ups.) * The Replay Center will take over determinations of 2-pointers vs. 3-pointers , operating automatically. * There figure to be a spate of traveling calls early this season. The referees have made that infraction one of their \u201cPoints of Education\u201d for 2019-20. That means a \u201cmore stringent enforcement\u201d of the existing rule, according to Monty McCutchen, the NBA\u2019s VP, head of referee development and training. The league has gone so far as to include the concept of \u201cthe gather\u201d in its rule book now. That \u2014 the moment when a player has full control of the ball and thus the point from which he can take two steps \u2013 has been used for years by game officials. But now it has been codified, which helps when discerning variations such as steps taken backward (rather than in forward progress) or in the \u201cEuro-step.\u201d McCutchen noted that, in years past, the NBA game was played through the post at a slower pace. Referees evaluated plays starting with the defenders. Now, with hand-checking long gone and 3-pointers pulling players farther out on the court, the refs\u2019 sequence of viewing plays has shifted to feet, then release, then defender. Other Points of Education for the refs this year have focused on illegal contact initiated by offensive players, \u201cfreedom of movement\u201d issues and \u201crespect for the game\u201d moments, which basically are emotional overreactions to calls that exceed allowable guidelines. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Per Charania, Bledsoe has suffered a small fracture of his rib. A two-or three-week absence from Friday would put Bledsoe\u2019s return sometime around late October or early November. However, Bucks GM Jon Horst told Matt Velazquez of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that Bledsoe did not fracture his ribs. Instead, Horst says Bledsoe fractured the cartilage between two of his ribs and that Bledsoe may not necessarily be out two-to-three weeks. Velazquez reports that Bledsoe has fractured cartilage in his 9th and 10th rib and there isn\u2019t a risk of re-injury or further complications. Whether or not Bledsoe comes back sooner or later than 2-3 weeks depends on his pain tolerance. The first two weeks of the Bucks\u2019 2019-20 schedule are an even split of road and home games (three apiece) before Week 3 begins. After that, they play seven of their next 10 games on the road, including a stretch that features dates with Western Conference contenders the LA Clippers (Nov. 6), Utah Jazz (Nov. 8) and the Indiana Pacers (Nov. 16). Last season, Bledsoe appeared and started in 78 games, averaging 15.9 points, 4.6 rebounds and 5.5 assists per game on 48.4% shooting (and 32.9% 3-point shooting). He received a four-year extension from the Bucks last season as he played a key role in Milwaukee amassing the Eastern Conference\u2019s best record en route to a run to the East finals . Bledsoe\u2019s absence means veteran George Hill will get the majority of the minutes while he heals up. Last season, Hill averaged 7.6 ppg, 2.5 rpg, 2.3 apg and shot 45.2% overall and 31.4% on 3-pointers. In addition, two-way player Frank Mason III could see a stint with the Bucks rather than taking his usual spot with the G League\u2019s Wisconsin Herd.

Ten minutes after that, he\u2019s tugging at the shoulder strap of his white athletic shirt, wiping sweat from his face. Fans aren\u2019t even in the building yet as Antetokounmpo grinds through a battery of shooting drills. He starts out basic, flipping a yellow, weighted ball through the rim as he takes a step backward after each shot. Then the Milwaukee Bucks\u2019 star and the NBA\u2019s reigning Kia MVP moves through specific stations \u2014 foul line, baselines, mid-range wings \u2014 while a few teammates shoot at the same end of the court. A cluster of staffers handle the rebounds. The music in the arena bowl is loud. Photographers are setting up their equipment. Eventually the anthem singer comes out for a trial run. There are, frankly, a couple dozen possible distractions at Fiserv Forum more than two hours before the Jazz-Bucks preseason game Wednesday. And yet, as far as Antetokounmpo is concerned, it\u2019s just him, the ball, the rim \u2026 and Bucks assistant coach Ben Sullivan. Sullivan is the tall, bearded fellow in team gear who puts the franchise\u2019s guy through these paces before games, after practices, sometimes on random weekend nights in the offseason when Antetokounmpo feels the itch to work. The term they use in Milwaukee is \u201ctaking your vitamins\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s a daily commitment. For all the attention heaped on the NBA\u2019s global vision this week, Antetokounmpo and Sullivan represent one of its upsides, bringing together an earnest, soft-spoken native of Portland, Ore., and a ridiculously gifted young man from Athens, Greece. Thirty years ago, they might never have met. These days, they labor at all hours in various gyms, to little fanfare, in hopes of delivering a championship to an underdog organization in a town where some folks wear cheese hats made of foam. That\u2019s for later. The shorter-term goal is simple: Constant improvement by Antetokounmpo, at the prodding and watch of a guy who needed a day job seven years ago because his coaching gig wasn\u2019t paying the bills. \u201cI could work with him for another 20 years,\u201d Sullivan said shortly after Antetokounmpo\u2019s shooting session, \u201cand we\u2019d still be working on this stuff.\u201d As he said it, he looked heavenward, made the sign-of-the-cross and smiled. When you\u2019re living the dream, you don\u2019t want to jinx a thing. \u201cHe\u2019s a great shooting coach,\u201d Antetokounmpo said, \u201cbut he\u2019s not just a shooting coach. We work on my post game. We work on my ball skills. Just becoming a better overall player.\u201d They got to the NBA a year apart. Antetokounmpo was a skinny, knobby kneed 18-year-old who spoke halting English and had been considered a reach by former Bucks GM John Hammond as the No. 15 pick in the 2013 Draft . Now, \u201cThe Greek Freak\u201d ranks as one of the top three or four players in the NBA, a basketball-without-borders success story to rival those of NBA legends Hakeem Olajuwon , Dirk Nowitzki or Yao Ming . The Bucks are pinning their hopes for an NBA title on Antetokounmpo\u2019s talents, work ethic and relentless pursuit of greatness. Sullivan? He was a 28-year-old then, wrapping up his first NBA season breaking down game film in the San Antonio Spurs\u2019 video room. The season before, he stayed busy driving from his home in Portland up to Vancouver, Wash., to work as an office manager for a construction firm. Come 3 p.m., he\u2019d head back down to Lewis & Clark College as an assistant coach for the Pioneers , the Division III school\u2019s hoops team. Without the first job, Sullivan \u2014 a graduate of the University of Portland who played professionally for a spell in Germany, China and Chile \u2014 couldn\u2019t have afforded to give so much time to the second.  Now the Bucks are pinning their hopes for an NBA title on Sullivan\u2019s talents, work ethic and relentless pursuit of Antetokounmpo\u2019s greatness too. However deep into spring Milwaukee plays, the contributors will range from \u201cThe Greek Freak\u2019s\u201d elite skills and MVP notoriety to Sullivan\u2019s relative anonymity (you might glimpse him in sideline shots sitting a few seats away from Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer). \u201cGiannis is such a great player,\u201d Budenholzer said this week, \u201cthe more we can push that envelope of him continuing to improve, that\u2019s super-important to us. And that\u2019s a great strength of Ben\u2019s. He\u2019s got a good way of helping players take progressive steps in their games. A lot of times, if we have somebody where we\u2019re spending extra time on shooting, he gets tasked with the majority of that.\u201d If it sounds as if Budenholzer has Sullivan\u2019s back, there\u2019s a reason: they climbed the same ladder, learned the NBA game the same way, in the same place, and plugged their way to all they\u2019ve achieved. Budenholzer, out of Pomona College, famously was hired by the Spurs to work in their video department a quarter century ago after pestering Gregg Popovich for the opportunity. He worked his way onto the bench, was around for four championships, then got hired by the Atlanta Hawks in 2013 for a five-year run. Sullivan had been dumped in Budenholzer\u2019s lap the year before he left, hired by GM R.C. Buford with a recommendation from player-turned-coach Ime Udoka (Udoka and Sullivan were fixtures on the Portland hoops scene.) The timing couldn\u2019t have been better for Sullivan \u2014 the Spurs went to The Finals that season and the next, suffering from Ray Allen\u2019s famous corner 3-pointer in Game 6 in \u201913 , then beating Miami for rings in \u201914 . When Budenholzer got an opening that summer, he called Sullivan. \u201cThe dream was always to just get a job in coaching that could pay my bills,\u201d Sullivan recalled. \u201cIt didn\u2019t happen till I got to the NBA.\u201d Initially, Sullivan wasn\u2019t sure whether to heed Udoka\u2019s advice, so he sought a second opinion. He didn\u2019t need a third. Said Sullivan: \u201cI had a coach I\u2019m close to tell me, \u2018Do whatever you have to do to get that job. The amount of stuff you\u2019ll learn and the people you\u2019ll meet, it could be the best thing to ever happen to you. If you have to take out a loan just to finance it, do that.\u2019 When he said that, I knew this was something I needed to do.\u201d The video department of an NBA team is like the boiler room of a luxury cruise ship. It\u2019s as unglamorous as the league gets, with long hours spent in windowless rooms into the wee hours. Few of the coordinators and assistant coordinators plan to be in those jobs very long. And the reason they can dream like that is, what they learn there makes them so valuable in other roles.  \u201cYou really learn to see the game and train your eye in a much, much different way,\u201d Budenholzer said. \u201cLots of times you actually have to see all 10 guys on the court and understand, are they doing what they\u2019re supposed to be doing? Sometimes you have to be creative and think, what is it they were supposed to be doing? \u201cI can tell you, those video guys are truly trained to see the spacing, the timing, how offenses progress, what are teams doing defensively. There\u2019s an attention to detail that you learn in the video room that, I don\u2019t want to say you can\u2019t get anywhere else, but it\u2019s a huge part of their foundation.\u201d  Frank Vogel, coach of the Los Angeles Lakers, got his start in Rick Pitino\u2019s video room at Kentucky and later when Pitino coached the Boston Celtics. Colleagues from Sullivan\u2019s Spurs stint are scattered on benches throughout the NBA: Bret Brielmaier in Brooklyn, Will Hardy out front in San Antonio, Chris Babcock with Philadelphia. They grab the lowest rung on the coaching ladder, then the next and the next. The climb is made possible by the know-how, the feel, the networking, all gleaned from that demanding, immersive environment.  \u201cGoing into the Spurs\u2019 video room was like getting your doctorate in basketball,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cYou\u2019re not doing it for the money. You\u2019re doing it for the knowledge and the basketball experience.\u201d Budenholzer\u2019s call from Atlanta got Sullivan climbing. His first season with the Hawks, the team won a franchise-record 60 games while he worked with proven NBA players, including current Bucks shooter Kyle Korver. Atlanta reached the playoffs three times in his four seasons. When Budenholzer parted ways with the franchise in 2018 and snagged the Bucks job , Sullivan was among the staffers he brought to Milwaukee . Sullivan mentions coaches in both San Antonio and Atlanta \u2014 Chip Engelland (with the Spurs), Chad Forcier (now with the Bucks) and Kenny Atkinson (now the Nets\u2019 coach) \u2014 as mentors. When asked what he\u2019s learned or borrowed from Engelland, one of the league\u2019s most respected \u201cshot doctors,\u201d the Bucks assistant said: \u201cEverything. Like, am I going to get sued for plagiarism? The amount of stuff I learned from him and Pop and Bud, I could never repay.\u201d He can, however, pay it forward in his tutelage of Antetokounmpo. All he must do is help a reigning MVP still shy of his prime at just 24 improve on the performance he gave in 2018-19 and boost his team to six additional playoff victories next spring. That\u2019s a lot to ask from a player who averaged 27.7 points, 12.5 rebounds and 5.9 assists per game, while hitting 57.8 percent of his shots and earning All-Defensive first team honors . Might as well try to tweak the smile on the Mona Lisa, right?  \u201cHe still has a lot of growth,\u201d Sullivan said, \u201cand that\u2019s what gets me excited. His passing, his handle, his pick-and-roll play, his one-on-one play. Playing off the ball. Then on defense, he can be more engaged. He has some areas he can really grow in. I think that\u2019s scary for everyone else.\u201d \u201cHe wants it, man. He wants to be great. He wants to drive us. He wants this to be the last team standing. He\u2019s a driven man.\u201d The job as Antetokounmpo\u2019s sorta-kinda guru\/tutor\/coach was open because the fellow who\u2019d previously held it, Sean Sweeney, got cleared out when the Jason Kidd\/Joe Prunty regime ended in 2018 . Sweeney, who had been devoted to Antetkounmpo\u2019s development since arriving with Kidd in 2014, works now for Detroit. No one spent more time working with \u201cThe Greek Freak\u201d than Sweeney over his four seasons in Milwaukee. They forged a relationship that transcends team affiliation, though logistics and their daily demands keep them apart these days. Thinking of those years, Antetokounmpo said of his helpers then and now: \u201cThey\u2019re similar. One thing I\u2019ll say about Sweeney is, he literally lived in the gym. He didn\u2019t go back home. Ben has kids [Penny and Walker with wife Bailee]. But whenever I\u2019m texting him \u2014 \u2018Coach, meet me at 8:30 or 9 p.m.\u2019 \u2014 he\u2019s always there. Ready.\u201d  Building a new relationship with a player, particularly a superstar, can challenge an assistant coach. Trust is the cornerstone. Can the coach really help the player improve? Does the player even want to be coached? \u201cIn my experience,\u201d Sullivan said, \u201cif you are genuine and passionate and real, if you have good attention to detail and you\u2019re focused, I think if you bring that to the table, players will respond and respect that.\u201d And if they don\u2019t, well, no one wants to be the assistant coach who pushed the franchise star too hard, for fear it might push him away altogether. Though that apparently isn\u2019t a worry for the Bucks with Antetokounmpo.  \u201cThat\u2019s another thing that makes Giannis special,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cHis desire to be great. And then his willingness to be coached \u2014 one of the best I\u2019ve ever seen. He knows what he has inside, and he knows he needs help. Bud coaches him, I coach him, [fellow assistant] Darvin [Ham] coaches him. He\u2019s that driven to be better. He wants to be pushed.\u201d The way Antetokounmpo works through his warm-ups and tutorials, a coach is more likely to tire out himself than wear out the versatile 6-foot-11 star. While Sullivan observes, assistant video coordinator Schuyler Rimmer \u2014 a former Florida forward who stands 6-foot-10 \u2014 joins in to play post defense against the Bucks\u2019 star. There\u2019s a whole lot of banging going on. \u201cEvery player has holes in his game,\u201d Antetokounmpo told NBA.com. \u201cYou try to fill all holes up as much as you can. Ben is doing a great job. \u201cI definitely want to be challenged by my coaches. I told Sullivan that. I said, \u2018Coach, tell me what I\u2019m supposed to do and I\u2019ll try to do it as hard as I can. Do not try to be nice with me. Just fire away. No BS. Tell me what to do. That\u2019s how we\u2019re going to get better. If I\u2019m BS-ing in a practice, tell me right to my face.\u2019 \u201d Sound harsh. What about a coach\u2019s bedside manner, doesn\u2019t that matter? \u201cBeing nice?\u201d Antetokounmpo said. \u201cThere are times when you\u2019ve got to be nice. But in sports, you\u2019ve got to be real. Sometimes when you\u2019re real, that hurts. But if it\u2019s for your own good or the team\u2019s good, it doesn\u2019t really hurt. Because I want to get better. Help me get better.\u201d That gets us to the Holy Grail of Antetokounmpo\u2019s burgeoning game: His shooting. It\u2019s the one skill that, as league GMs and coaches have said for years now, lags behind the rest of his blossoming on both sides of the ball. If he were to boost his jump shot to a reliable accuracy and stretch it to (gasp) 3-point range, he might be downright unstoppable. Antetokounmpo\u2019s field-goal success is built largely from his dunks and baskets at the rim. Once he\u2019s out to three feet or farther, he shoots at about a 35% rate . He\u2019s a career 27.7% 3-point shooter, which includes 25.6% last season. There still are awkward moments when opponents leave Antetokounmpo unattended \u2014 if he has picked up his dribble, anyway \u2014 almost daring him to shoot from mid-range and beyond. As Milwaukee lost the final four games to Toronto in the Eastern Conference finals in May, the 3-pointers he did launch ( he went 7-of-21 ) seemed to come from the frustration of running into the Raptors\u2019 defensive wall. Conventional wisdom says Antetokounmpo shouldn\u2019t need much of a jump shot, given Milwaukee\u2019s many 3-point threats. The idea, after all, is to spread the defense primarily so he has lanes to the basket. That happened last season, with the Bucks ranking second in the NBA in both 3-pointers taken and made . But Sullivan flipped the thinking. \u201cHis shooting is not just for him, it\u2019s also for his teammates,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cIf Eric Bledsoe and Khris [Middleton] are in the pick-and-roll and Giannis is in the corner, if they kick it to Giannis, that\u2019s a situation where he has to be ready and willing to take that shot. He\u2019s physically capable of making it, no problem, but the mental aspect has to be \u2018This is a shot I\u2019m gonna do.\u2019 \u201d The public notices the mechanics of Antetokounmpo\u2019s jump shot, which often looks to be just that: mechanical. He lifts the ball high, out in front of his face more than above his head. Tilting back, he looks as if he\u2019s peeking over a fence. When he sends it toward the rim, the fingers of his enormous right hand are spread wide in follow-through. None of that is a problem in Sullivan\u2019s view, though it\u2019s still a little paint-by-numbers. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if I heard this somewhere or where it came from,\u201d the coach said, \u201cbut shooting is a balance of fluidity and structure. All the great shooters have some sort of balance. We\u2019re trying to carve out and find the perfect balance for Giannis, what his fluidity and structure is.\u201d  His real breakthrough will come when outside shots are equal options in Antetokounmpo\u2019s repertoire. \u201cThe term I\u2019ve heard is \u2018shooting psyche,\u2019 \u201d Sullivan said. \u201cEven more so than technique, I think mentally he\u2019s really starting to understand the impact [his shooting] can have on everybody. When Giannis comes in, he\u2019s going to the rim and trying to dunk on people. Which is right. So deciding to shoot is secondary. \u201cBut he needs to mentally grow in that area, of \u2018attack with the jumper, shoot a pull-up here, shoot a three there.\u2019 We want him to play completely to his strengths, and then whenever a shot\u2019s available, take it.\u201d By the way, Sullivan isn\u2019t only a shooting coach. He works with other Bucks players, same as Antetokounmpo gets coached by Budenholzer and his other assistants. \u201cBen\u2019s always out there, working as hard as any guy on the court,\u201d said center Brook Lopez, who stretched his 3-point range with Sullivan\u2019s aid last season. \u201cHe lets guys get out there and kind of experiment, thinking how to elevate their game. He doesn\u2019t have you doing the same stuff to be the same player. He really helps people become better players.\u201d And yes, that includes a dominant player who is being measured mostly against himself and, OK, maybe some legends. \u201cHe\u2019s going to continue to improve because that\u2019s who he is,\u201d Lopez said of Antetokounmpo. \u201cHe\u2019s not satisfied at all with the player he currently is. He sees himself as someone who can be a whole \u2018nother player by leaps and bounds.\u201d As Antetokounmpo\u2019s daily regimen of catch-and-shoots, off-the-dribble 3-pointers, pull-ups and post moves ended, he made sure to seek out and slap hands with each of the staffers and ball kids who helped rebound for him. When this all comes together in Antetokounmpo as both an inside and outside scoring threat \u2014 and it might happen more quickly than folks anticipate \u2014 the highest five will belong to Sullivan. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Irving was attempting to play through a facial fracture, an injury that occurred in a pickup game last month. He was wearing a clear mask in an effort to protect his face, but appeared to bump into Lakers guard Rajon Rondo while playing defense just 1:06 into the contest. Irving\u2019s face made contact with Rondo\u2019s upper arm. The Nets guard immediately winced in pain, took the mask off and motioned to the bench that he needed a substitute. The team soon ruled him out for the rest of the game, though, after that. Aside from Irving, Nets swingman Caris LeVert is listed as questionable to return to the game after he was scratched in the eye in the game\u2019s initial minute as well. The Nets ended up beating the Lakers, 114-111 , thanks to a fourth-quarter rally fueled by Brooklyn\u2019s backups. Irving originally suffered his injury, a left side facial fracture, after taking an elbow to the face in a pickup game in late September. He was signed in July after two seasons in Boston. He has had to wear a mask previously during games to protect a facial fracture, including early in the 2017-18 season after he was elbowed by former teammate Aron Baynes.

All of the usual media sessions surrounding the Lakers-Nets preseason game in Shanghai on Thursday \u2014 including a scheduled news conference from NBA Commissioner Adam Silver and postgame news conferences with the teams \u2014 have been canceled. It\u2019s the latest salvo in the rift between the league and China stemming from a since-deleted tweet posted last week by Morey, the general manager of the Houston Rockets. \u201cThere will be no media availabilities for tonight\u2019s game between the Brooklyn Nets and Los Angeles Lakers,\u201d the NBA said in a statement Thursday, released a few hours before the game. The game was proceeding as scheduled. Fans arriving at the arena to watch \u2014 many of them donning NBA jerseys \u2014 were handed small Chinese flags to carry with them inside, and at least one person carried a sign critical of Silver. \u201cI understand that there are consequences from that exercise of, in essence, his freedom of speech,\u201d Silver said at a news conference in Tokyo earlier this week. \u201cWe will have to live with those consequences.\u201d And this move was one of those consequences. Morey\u2019s tweet expressed support for anti-government protesters in Hong Kong, and sparked fallout that has completely overshadowed the NBA\u2019s annual trip to China \u2014 which typically takes on a celebratory tone. Not this year. Most events in advance of the game, such as NBA Cares events to benefit educational causes and the Special Olympics, were called off, as was a \u201cfan night\u201d where Lakers and Nets players were to interact directly with some Chinese ticketholders. Signage in Shanghai to promote the game \u2014 huge photos of LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Kyrie Irving and other players \u2014 was ripped down, and mentions of the game were scrubbed from the arena website. All that comes as many Chinese corporations suspended their business ties to the NBA. Chinese state broadcaster CCTV said it was not going to show the Lakers-Nets games on Thursday or in Shenzhen on Saturday, and NBA broadcast partner Tencent also said it was changing its coverage plans for the league. Silver said earlier this week that Rockets great Yao Ming, a Basketball Hall of Famer and now the president of the Chinese Basketball Association \u2014 which has also suspended its ties with Houston as part of the Morey tweet fallout \u2014 is angry as well. \u201cI\u2019m not sure he quite accepts sort of how we are operating our business right now, and again, I accept that we have a difference of opinion,\u201d Silver said. \u201cI also think that as part of our core values, tolerance is one of those as well. I think tolerance for differing societies\u2019 approaches, tolerance for differing points of view and the ability to listen. Certainly I don\u2019t come here, either as the commissioner of the NBA or as an American, to tell others how they should run their governments.\u201d In the U.S., there was governmental reaction as well leading up to the game. On Wednesday in Washington, a bipartisan group of lawmakers \u2014 including the rare alignment of Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York \u2014 sent a letter to Silver saying the NBA should show the \u201ccourage and integrity\u201d to stand up to the Chinese government. They asked the NBA to, among other things, suspend activities in China until what they called the selective treatment against the Rockets ends. \u201cYou have more power to take a stand than most of the Chinese government\u2019s targets and should have the courage and integrity to use it,\u201d the lawmakers told Silver. The Rockets were extremely popular in China, largely because of Yao. But the team\u2019s merchandise has been taken off e-commerce sites and out of stores selling NBA apparel in the country, murals featuring the team\u2019s stars and logo were painted over and even the Chinese consulate office in Houston expressed major displeasure with Morey and the Rockets. Morey has been silent on the matter since a tweet Sunday where he attempted to make some sort of amends with the Chinese. \u201cI have always appreciated the significant support our Chinese fans and sponsors have provided and I would hope that those who are upset will know that offending or misunderstanding them was not my intention,\u201d he wrote Sunday. \u201cMy tweets are my own and in no way represent the Rockets or the NBA.\u201d Saturday\u2019s game between the Lakers and Nets in Shenzhen also remains on as scheduled."},{"id":31405,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/porzingis-1st-quarter-preseason-debut","date":"2019-10-10","title":"Kristaps Porzingis comes out firing in Mavs' preseason debut (Video)","content":"Kristaps Porzingis showed no rust during the first quarter of his preseason debut with the Dallas Mavericks, drilling jumpers right away in his first NBA action since Feb. 6, 2018."},{"id":31436,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/ben-simmons-3-point-shot","date":"2019-10-09","title":"Ben Simmons shows he's got some 3-point range","content":"From Chris Paul in Oklahoma City to the Portland Trail Blazers back at Memorial Coliseum, the NBA schedule had the feel of something old on Tuesday.

First, as an undersized, little-recruited point guard who dominated in college at Colorado State. Then as an undersized, undrafted point guard who enjoyed one of the most decorated careers in WNBA history. But the South Dakota native outdid even herself in 2014, when a chance meeting with Gregg Popovich, and the unofficial internship that resulted, prompted the Spurs to hire her as the first full-time female assistant coach in the history of North America\u2019s four major professional leagues. Here are 10 things to know about her improbable journey. Make or miss \u2026 and walk: A deadly shooter, Hammon credits some of her prowess to her formative years, where she spent countless hours hooping on a rim mounted over a large concrete slab at the family home just outside Rapid City in the Black Hills National Forest. In addition to honing her stroke, she had extra motivation to make her jumpers count: To retrieve errant shots, she had to trudge down the hill from the Hammon homestead. \u201cI didn\u2019t have any neighbors,\u201d Hammon told Bleacher Report in 2014 , \u201cand if you missed, the ball rolled for 30 yards.\u201d Playing up: In addition to working obsessively on her shot, Hammon played almost exclusively against boys leading up to high school, including youth leagues in which she often played several years above her own age group. Despite her lack of size, quickness and hops, the experience proved essential to her future success, primarily in learning how to get off and make creative shots over larger, more athletic opponents. \u201cA couple of pump fakes and throw it with some twist off the board,\u201d father Marty Hammon told Bleacher Report . \u201cThat just comes from playing with boys. We always had to find a way of getting that shot off. Where for anybody else that was crap, for her it was necessary. That was part of her game.\u201d Queen of the Hills : All that work paid off when Hammon arrived at Stevens High School, where she set career records for points, assists and steals while winning a pair of state player of the year awards. Former Stevens coach Ron Riherd, who led the school for more than 20 seasons, called her \u201cby far the best player I ever coached.\u201d Yet Hammon still agonizes over the final contest of her high school career, a loss in the state semifinals in which the opposing team hit a game-winning buzzer-beater after she missed the front end of a one-and-one. Hammon, who would retire with the WNBA\u2019s best career free-throw percentage at 89.7, finished with 29 of her team\u2019s 34 points in the game. Mr. and Mrs. Basketball: Hammon was preceded by several years at Stevens by Eric \u201cThe Polish Rifle\u201d Piatkowski, who starred at Nebraska before enjoying a 14-year NBA career with the Clippers, Rockets, Bulls and Suns. The life aquatic: An avid outdoorswoman, Hammon received a shotgun for her 14th birthday. While hunting wasn\u2019t quite her thing \u2014 her brother Matt told Bleacher Report she cried after shooting her first (and only) deer \u2014 Hammon has an abiding fascination with the ocean, especially sharks. \u201cBecky loves those big sharks,\u201d said Marty Hammon, whose family takes an annual vacation in Key West. \u201cAnd they\u2019re never big enough for her.\u201d Unwanted: Despite her high school achievements, Hammon was almost entirely overlooked by college recruiters. It wasn\u2019t until the summer before her senior year, at a camp in Indiana, that an assistant coach from nearby Colorado State \u2014 there to scout other players \u2014 couldn\u2019t help but notice the short, slow point guard who kept schooling the so-called superstars. \u201cShe made them look silly,\u201d that assistant, Kari Gallegos-Doering, told Bleacher Report . \u201cShe could just do things and go around people and make passes. I remember a player running down the floor shaking her head. She had just been duped. That was Becky. Here\u2019s a nobody making these players look bad.\u201d That nobody went on to re-write the record books at Colorado State, setting school marks in career points, assists and 3-pointers while making three All-America teams and winning the 1999 Pomeroy Naismith Award, given annually to the best women\u2019s senior under 5-foot-8.  History repeats: Just as college recruiters showed little interest in the 5-foot-6 Hammon, neither did professional scouts put much credence in her extraordinary career at Colorado State. And just as Hammon took maximum advantage of that opportunity, so did she prove her doubters wrong yet again in the WNBA. Undrafted in 1999, Hammon would enjoy one of the most decorated careers in league history, highlighted by six All-Star appearances, four All-WNBA selections, the league record for career assists and selection as one of the WNBA\u2019s Top 15 Players of All Time after 14 total seasons with the New York Liberty and the San Antonio Stars. \u201cHer size never mattered,\u201d Richie Adubato, her former coach with the Liberty, told the New Yorker in 2018 . \u201cWhen she drove to the basket, it didn\u2019t matter who was in there. She had one shot blocked, I think, in four years.\u201d Circuitous route: In addition to her professional success, Hammon was also a two-time Olympian. Just not for her birth nation. Unable to get even an invitation to try out for the U.S. Olympic team in 2008, Hammon made the unusual \u2014 and highly controversial \u2014 decision to instead become a citizen of Russia, where she played professionally in the WNBA offseason for CSKA Moscow. Critics weren\u2019t shy, with then-U.S. coach Anne Donovan questioning Hammon\u2019s patriotism and star center Lisa Leslie refused to shake her hand after the two nations met in the tournament semifinals. But Hammon put her hard-earned mental toughness to good use, shaking off the heat to help Russia win the bronze medal with 22 points against China before representing the country again at the 2012 Games.  \u201cI took a beating,\u201d Hammon told the New Yorker . \u201cIt helped build something inside me.\u201d Unofficial audition: It was with the Stars, for whom Hammon played from 2007 to 2014, that her relationship with Popovich began. The two first spent meaningful time together on their flight back from those 2012 Olympics, with Popovich peppering her with questions and Hammon impressing with her intelligence and candor. Popovich\u2019s admiration for Hammon was further elevated when she spent the 2013 season with the Spurs in an unofficial capacity while she rehabbed from a knee injury. Quiet at first, Hammon gradually began participating more and more in practices and film studies, even challenging Popovich when she saw fit. \u201cThat\u2019s when I knew,\u201d Popovich told the New Yorker , \u201cif I had the opportunity, I wanted to put her on staff.\u201d Said former Spurs player Pau Gasol: \u201cBecky Hammon can coach NBA basketball. Period.\u201d The climb continues: Hammon\u2019s star has only continued to rise since her hiring by the Spurs. Indeed, the Milwaukee Bucks even interviewed her for their vacant head coaching position in 2018. Several years before that, she helped the Spurs win the 2015 Las Vegas Summer League championship as the first female head coach in that competition. She currently serves alongside Spurs legend Tim Duncan as one of Popovich\u2019s top assistants.

Silver, speaking Tuesday at a news conference in Tokyo before a preseason game between the Rockets and NBA champion Toronto Raptors, went as far as to say that he and the league are \u201capologetic\u201d that so many Chinese officials and fans were upset by Morey\u2019s tweet and comments that followed \u2014 but insisted that Morey has the right to freedom of expression . > Adam Silver\u2019s statement on NBA, China \u201cDaryl Morey, as general manager of the Houston Rockets, enjoys that right as one of our employees,\u201d Silver said. \u201cWhat I also tried to suggest is that I understand there are consequences from his freedom of speech and we will have to live with those consequences.\u201d Among those consequences: CCTV said it would not show the games between the Los Angeles Lakers and Brooklyn Nets, who will play Thursday in Shanghai and Saturday in Shenzhen. Basketball is wildly popular in China and those two teams \u2014 largely because of LeBron James starring for the Lakers and Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba\u2019s co-founder Joe Tsai now owning the Nets \u2014 almost certainly would have been a huge television draw. \u201cWe\u2019re strongly dissatisfied and oppose Adam Silver\u2019s claim to support Morey\u2019s right to freedom of expression,\u201d CCTV said in a statement. \u201cWe believe that any remarks that challenge national sovereignty and social stability are not within the scope of freedom of speech.\u201d The broadcaster is also reviewing all its cooperation and exchanges involving the NBA, said the statement posted to CCTV Sports\u2019 official social media account. The NBA is not the first major corporation to deal with criticism from China over political differences. Mercedes-Benz, Delta Air Lines, hotel operator Marriott, fashion brand Zara and others also have found themselves in conflicts with China in recent years. Silver is going to Shanghai on Wednesday and said he hopes to meet with officials and some of the league\u2019s business partners there in an effort to find some sort of common ground. He said he hopes Chinese officials and fans look at the totality of the impact of the three-decade-plus relationship between the league and their country, and urged them to see his response while acknowledging there are political differences between the countries. \u201cI\u2019m sympathetic to our interests here and our partners that are upset,\u201d Silver said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s inconsistent on one hand to be sympathetic to them and at the same time stand by our principles.\u201d Silver said the NBA did not expect CCTV to cancel plans to show the Lakers-Nets games. \u201cBut if those are the consequences of us adhering to our values, I still feel it\u2019s very, very important to adhere to those values,\u201d Silver said. The rift between China and the NBA started late last week when Morey tweeted a now-deleted image that read: \u201cFight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong,\u201d in reference to months of pro-democracy demonstrations in the semiautonomous Chinese territory that has been mired in escalating violence between protesters and law enforcement. Efforts were quickly made to defuse the impact; Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta said Morey does not speak for the Rockets, and Morey returned to Twitter on Monday in an effort to clarify his meaning. But damage was clearly done: At least one Chinese sporting goods company said it was no longer cooperating with the Rockets, NBA streaming partner Tencent \u2014 which has a $1.5 billion contract with the league over the next five seasons \u2014 said it would not show Rockets games and a sports news website in China said it was no longer covering the team. Further complicating the matter is this: China\u2019s best-known basketball player is Hall of Famer Yao Ming, who spent his NBA career with the Rockets. Yao is now the president of the Chinese Basketball Association, which has said it is suspending its relationship with the Rockets as part of the response to Morey\u2019s tweet. The CBA also canceled plans to have the G League affiliates from Houston and Dallas play preseason games in China later this month. \u201cI\u2019m hoping that together Yao Ming and I can find an accommodation,\u201d Silver said. \u201cBut he is extremely hot at the moment, and I understand it.\u201d A ceremonial NBA Cares event for an educational center in Shanghai with the Nets was canceled Tuesday, though the Nets participated in other events as scheduled. The Lakers were arriving there Tuesday. Silver said NBA Cares would still honor its bigger mission surrounding that event, including providing a gift of new computers. \u201cHow can it be possible to carry out exchanges and cooperation with China without knowing China\u2019s public opinion?\u201d Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Geng Shuang said Tuesday. \u201cNBA\u2019s cooperation with China has been going on for quite a long time, so for what should be said and what should be done, they know best.\u201d Silver also released a statement before his news conference, saying \u201cthose who question our motivation\u201d should know that the NBA\u2019s stance is about more than business. Many U.S. lawmakers have called for the league to take action \u2014 some even suggesting the games in China should be canceled by the NBA. \u201cWe are not apologizing for Daryl exercising his freedom of expression,\u201d Silver said. \u201cI regret \u2014 again, having communicated directly with many friends in China \u2014 that so many people are upset, including millions and millions of our fans. At the end of the day, we come with basketball as an opportunity to sell dreams, sell hopes \u2026 that we are causing disruption in people\u2019s lives and that we are causing disharmony, that\u2019s something I regret.\u201d Reynolds reported from Miami.

Let me be more clear. O ver the last three decades, the NBA has developed a great affinity for the people of China. We have seen how basketball can be an important form of people-to-people exchange that deepens ties between the United States and China. At the same time, we recognize that our two countries have different political systems and beliefs. And like many global brands, we bring our business to places with different political systems around the world. But for those who question our motivation, this is about far more than growing our business. Values of equality, respect and freedom of expression have long defined the NBA \u2014 and will continue to do so. As an American-based basketball league operating globally, among our greatest contributions are these values of the game. I n fact, one of the enduring strengths of the NBA is our diversity \u2014 of views, backgrounds, ethnicities, genders and religions. Twenty-five percent of NBA players were born outside of the United States and our colleagues work in league offices around the world, including in Beijing, Hong Kong, Shanghai and Taipei. W ith that diversity comes the belief that whatever our differences, we respect and value each other; and, what we have in common, including a belief in the power of sports to make a difference, remains our bedrock principle. It is inevitable that people around the world \u2014 including from America and China \u2014 will have different viewpoints over different issues. It is not the role of the NBA to adjudicate those differences. However, the NBA will not put itself in a position of regulating what players, employees and team owners say or will not say on these issues. We simply could not operate that way. Basketball runs deep in the hearts and minds of our two peoples. At a time when divides between nations grow deeper and wider, we believe sports can be a unifying force that focuses on what we have in common as human beings rather than our differences."},{"id":31518,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/zion-williamson-preseason-debut","date":"2019-10-08","title":"Dunkfest: Zion Williamson shows high-flying skills in preseason debut","content":" ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 Zion Williamson may not be quite as tall as billed. He still soared in his first NBA preseason game Monday night. Showing off the high-flying talents that made him one of the most anticipated rookies in years, Williamson turned in a ferocious slam less than 2 minutes into his debut with the New Orleans Pelicans and dunked it two more times before the first half was done against the Atlanta Hawks. \u201cThis isn\u2019t high school or college anymore,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to go up strong. So I went up strong and I was able to finish.\u201d It was quite the close-range repertoire. One with the right hand. One with the left hand. One with both hands. Williamson finished with 17 points, seven rebounds, three assists and three steals, helping the Pelicans to a 133-109 victory over the Hawks before a much larger crowd \u2014 announced at 15,441 \u2014 than what normally be expected in Atlanta for an exhibition between two teams that failed to make the playoffs last season. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect that many people to come,\u201d Williamson said. Of course, the score was irrelevant. This was chance to see the future of the NBA for the first time \u2014 not counting his brief stint in the Las Vegas Summer League \u2014 and Williamson did not disappoint, though he\u2019s not close to being a finished product after just one college season at Duke. He missed a pair of 3-point attempts, turned it over four times and looked a bit lost defensively. At one point, teammate Jrue Holiday, who has been in the league a decade, gently nudged him into the proper position. Still, it was a tantalizing glimpse of Williamson\u2019s skills. \u201cYou know me,\u201d he said, breaking into a big smile. \u201cIt was a lot of fun. The first NBA game. It\u2019s not going to count against the record. But the first one of hopefully many. I\u2019m glad I could get that one under my belt.\u201d Just 62 seconds into the game, he took a pass from Lonzo Ball on the pick-and-roll and banked one in while drawing the foul from John Collins. Williamson knocked down the free throw and \u2014 voila \u2014 he had his first three-point play. A small section of the crowd chanted \u201cOverrated!\u201d but their hearts weren\u2019t really in it. Williamson was still listed at 6-foot-7 on the Pelicans roster, though he reportedly measured an inch shorter without shoes as part of the league\u2019s push to accurately measure everyone in the league this season. Whatever the case, he turned Hawks 7-footer Damian Jones into the first of what will likely be an abundance of poster victims with his next basket. Sizing up the Hawks from beyond the 3-point arc, Williamson suddenly burst toward the hoop, split a pair of defenders and dunked over the taller Jones with a fearsome right hand that left the fans gasping. \u201cI just saw the lane open up,\u201d Williamson said. A couple of minutes later, Williamson delivered a two-handed slam off another pass from Ball, a tantalizing display from the young duo. In the second quarter, it was a left-handed dunk set up by a dish from Kenrich Williams as the Hawks defense wisely scrambled out of the way. Before the game, the past and future came together. Williamson lingered at midcourt during warmups, clearly eager for a chance to pay his respects to the NBA\u2019s senior citizen. Atlanta\u2019s 42-year-old Vince Carter, preparing for his record 22nd \u2014 and final \u2014 season, came over to say a few words to the 19-year-old phenom, pulling him in close to make sure he could hear it all. \u201cI told to enjoy the moment, have fun and be himself,\u201d Carter said. After the introductions and the national anthem, Williamson took the court with his new team, a franchise that was rocked by Anthony Davis\u2019 trade demand but quickly recovered by landing the first overall pick in the draft lottery. Davis was dealt to the Los Angeles Lakers for a haul that included Ball and Brandon Ingram \u2014 both of whom joined the teenager in a Pelicans starting lineup that also included Holiday and Derrick Favors. The rebuilding teams featured four of the top 10 picks in this year\u2019s draft. The Hawks sent out No. 5 pick De\u2019Andre Hunter as part of their starting lineup, and brought 10th selection Cam Reddish \u2014 Williamson\u2019s Duke teammate \u2014 off the bench. The Pelicans also have No. 8 choice Jaxson Hayes. Williamson was thrilled to get a chance to take the court with Reddish again, even though they are now on opposite teams. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cJust a few months ago, we were in college together, just chillin\u2019 and having fun with each other, playing in games, and now we\u2019re pros. It was a different feel for sure. But it was great seeing him.\u201d"},{"id":31552,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/gores-pistons-andre-drummond-priority","date":"2019-10-08","title":"Gores says keeping Drummond a priority for Pistons","content":" DETROIT (AP) \u2014 On the day the Detroit Pistons opened their new training facility, owner Tom Gores discussed his hopes for the upcoming season. Not surprisingly, he\u2019d like more progress after the team made a brief playoff appearance a season ago. \u201cWe have to do more,\u201d Gores said. \u201cCoach said it up there. He thinks we\u2019re in great shape, a lot better than we were last year, when we made the playoffs. We need to get through the playoffs. We\u2019ve got to win in the playoffs.\u201d Gores was on hand Monday at the opening of the team\u2019s new training center and corporate headquarters in midtown Detroit. Coach Dwane Casey and Pistons players were also at the ceremony. The new facility completes the team\u2019s move to the city from suburban Auburn Hills. The Pistons are entering their third season playing their games at Little Caesars Arena downtown. Gores was asked about a possible contract extension for Drummond, the team\u2019s standout center. He spoke highly of Drummond but did not elaborate on any possible negotiations. He did say keeping Drummond in the fold is a priority. \u201cWe know how dedicated we are to each other,\u201d Gores said. \u201cI\u2019ve said it many times: He\u2019s very underrated in a lot of ways for what he does, and culturally he\u2019s been so good for this team, just in terms of his attitude, and just watching him really grow up. I met him when he was 18.\u201d Detroit has made the playoffs twice in the past four seasons, but the Pistons were swept in the first round both times. Last season it was at the hands of the Milwaukee Bucks. It was Casey\u2019s first season as Detroit\u2019s coach, and the Pistons were limited when Blake Griffin \u2014 after a terrific season \u2014 wasn\u2019t fully healthy in the playoffs. Keeping Griffin healthy is a big key this season, and the Pistons are also hopeful they\u2019ve improved their depth after adding Derrick Rose. Gores was asked if there might come a point when the team needs to consider a different path forward after relying on the core of Griffin, Drummond and point guard Reggie Jackson. \u201cI think right now we feel really good about where we\u2019re at,\u201d Gores said. \u201cObviously, we have to succeed and win, and judge by if we\u2019re not winning. But right now we feel really good about it.\u201d The $90 million Henry Ford Detroit Pistons Performance Center includes a sports medicine, treatment and rehab facility managed by the Henry Ford Health System, as well as retail and public spaces. Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan was also at the opening. \u201cThe Pistons have moved 250 employees into the city of Detroit today,\u201d Duggan said. \u201cFor every player on the court, there\u2019s another 20 people who are working here in operations, in ticket sales, in marketing and facilities, finance and trainers and the like.\u201d"},{"id":31516,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-kyle-lowry-contract-extension","date":"2019-10-07","title":"Reports: Kyle Lowry, Raptors agree to one-year contract extension","content":" The Toronto Raptors have made sure Kyle Lowry\u2019s stay with the franchise lasts just a bit longer. According to ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski, the Raptors and Lowry have agreed to a one-year, $31 million contract extension that will keep him from entering next year\u2019s free-agent market. Lowry, who last signed an extension with the Raptors in 2017, has spent the last seven seasons in Toronto. Agent Mark Bartelstein on Monday confirmed the agreement to The Associated Press. Per Wojnarowski, Raptors president Masai Ujiri, GM Bobby Webster and Lowry\u2019s representation had been motivated to complete an extension for several months. Over the weekend, the sides closed in on a deal that allows Lowry to stay with the franchise he\u2019s wanted to complete his career. \u201cWe are so appreciative of how Masai and Bobby handled every aspect of this negotiation,\u201d Bartelstein told ESPN . \u201cOnce again, they displayed how they look after their players in a first-class manner, especially someone like Kyle who they recognize has such a legacy with the franchise.\u201d In keeping Lowry in the fold, it gives Toronto a solid player to count on as it tries to figure out its next course of action this season and beyond. While Lowry will not be on the free-agent market next summer, veterans Marc Gasol, Fred VanVleet and Serge Ibaka are all in the final years of their respective contracts. Additionally, reigning Kia Most Improved Player winner Pascal Siakam will also be a free agent next summer. Per recent reports, Siakam is seeking a max contract extension from Toronto. Lowry has been dealing with the aftereffects of offseason thumb surgery. It kept him from playing for USA Basketball at this summer\u2019s World Cup, and he isn\u2019t playing in the Raptors\u2019 preseason games this week in Japan against Houston. He said last month that winning one championship has whetted his appetite for another. \u201cI\u2019m motivated even more than ever now,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you get a taste of it, you always want it.\u201d He has been gratified by the Raptors\u2019 success. \u201cI\u2019ve been through the ups and downs,\u201d he said. \u201cI was able to help bring a championship here, from the time when they were talking about tanking for certain players. I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m the sole reason but I feel like I have a big part of it.\u201d Lowry is the Raptors\u2019 all-time leader in steals and 3-pointers made and ranks second in assists while placing in the top 5 in several categories including points scored, games played and free throws made. He is a five-time All-Star and was named to the All-NBA third team in 2015-16. The 2018-19 season began with him averaging over 10 assists per game through his first 23 games before lingering injuries brought upon a shooting slump that saw him held scoreless on Dec. 9. Through it all, Lowry remained steady, earning his fifth consecutive All-Star appearance as he ended the season averaging 14.2 ppg and 8.7 apg, the latter ranking second in the league behind Russell Westbrook. In Toronto\u2019s run to the 2019 NBA championship, Lowry was solid throughout that span. He averaged 16.2 points, 4 rebounds and 7.2 assists per game in The Finals, coming through with 26 points, seven rebounds, 10 assists and three steals in the Game 6 series-clincher.

A short time after Morey posted that statement, the NBA said it was \u201cregrettable\u201d that the deleted tweet offended many in China. And all that followed several companies in China, including some of the NBA\u2019s major business partners there, lashing out over Morey\u2019s original tweet. Morey tweeted an image that read \u201cFight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.\u201d referring to the four-month-old protests in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory. That led to Houston owner Tilman Fertitta turning to Twitter to say that Morey does not speak for the Rockets, and sparking an outcry that included the Chinese Basketball Association \u2014 whose president is Yao Ming, the former Rockets star center \u2014 saying it was suspending its relationship with the team. Other criticism came from Tencent, a major media partner of the NBA in China with a streaming deal that is worth $1.5 billion over the next five years, and Chinese state television \u2014 both of which said they would not be showing Rockets games. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear if Morey\u2019s new tweets or the NBA\u2019s statement that followed would be enough to salvage those relationships. Chinese athletic apparel maker Li-Ning released a statement saying it was upset with Morey\u2019s tweet. \u201cI did not intend my tweet to cause any offense to Rockets fans and friends of mine in China,\u201d Morey tweeted early Monday from Japan, where Houston is playing this week. \u201cI was merely voicing one thought, based on one interpretation, of one complicated event. I have had a lot of opportunity since that tweet to hear and consider other perspectives. \u201cI have always appreciated the significant support our Chinese fans and sponsors have provided and I would hope that those who are upset will know that offending or misunderstanding them was not my intention. My tweets are my own and in no way represent the Rockets or the NBA.\u201d NBA Chief Communications Officer Mike Bass said the league recognizes that Morey\u2019s tweet \u201cdeeply offended many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable.\u201d Bass added that the league supports individuals \u201csharing their views on matters important to them.\u201d \u201cWe have great respect for the history and culture of China and hope that sports and the NBA can be used as a unifying force to bridge cultural divides and bring people together,\u201d Bass said. Earlier, Fertitta attempted to distance the team from Morey\u2019s tweet with a Twitter post of his own: \u201cListen.@darylmorey does NOT speak for the @HoustonRockets. Our presence in Tokyo is all about the promotion of the @NBA internationally and we are NOT a political organization.\u201d The timing of this is particularly awkward for the NBA, whose players have often been outspoken on social issues in the United States. China has teams in the U.S. playing preseason games this week, the Rockets are about to play two games in Japan and the Los Angeles Lakers \u2014 with one of the biggest global sports stars in LeBron James \u2014 and Brooklyn Nets set to play Thursday in Shanghai and Saturday in Shenzhen, China. Speaking at a practice in Tokyo on Monday, Rockets\u2019 star James Harden was contrite as he spoke standing with teammate Russell Westbrook. \u201cWe apologize. You know, we love China, we love playing there. For both of us individually, we go there once or twice a year. They show us the most important love. We appreciate them as a fan base. We love everything there about them and we appreciate the support that they give us individually and as organization.\u201d Nets owner Joe Tsai is a co-founder of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, and posted an open letter on his Facebook page late Sunday night saying Morey stepped on what he described as \u201ca third-rail issue\u201d when it comes to China and Hong Kong. \u201cBy now I hope you can begin to understand why the Daryl Morey tweet is so damaging to the relationship with our fans in China,\u201d Tsai wrote. \u201cI don\u2019t know Daryl personally. I am sure he\u2019s a fine NBA general manager, and I will take at face value his subsequent apology that he was not as well informed as he should have been. But the hurt that this incident has caused will take a long time to repair.\u201d The statements from Morey and the NBA caught the eyes of lawmakers, including no fewer than three U.S. Senators \u2014 Ted Cruz of Texas, Rick Scott of Florida (who criticized NBA Commissioner Adam Silver for the league\u2019s statement, apparently unaware it was made by Bass, an NBA spokesman), and Brian Schatz of Hawaii. \u201cWe\u2019re better than this; human rights shouldn\u2019t be for sale; the NBA shouldn\u2019t be assisting Chinese communist censorship,\u201d tweeted Cruz, who said he is a lifelong Rockets fan. Democratic presidential candidate Julian Castro, a former U.S. Housing Secretary from Texas, tweeted \u201cChina is using its economic power to silence critics \u2014 even those in the U.S.\u201d Fostering strong relationships with China has been a priority of the NBA for at least three decades. The NBA has a China office, just announced plans to add a gaming team in Shanghai to the NBA 2K League, and officials in both countries say as many as 500 million Chinese watched at least one NBA game last season. Several NBA players \u2014 including major current and former stars like Stephen Curry and Kobe Bryant \u2014 go to China annually to promote their individual brands, and the World Cup held in China this summer saw countless fans attending in NBA jerseys. The Rockets, largely because of Yao, have an enormous Chinese following. But after Morey\u2019s tweet, even the Chinese government\u2019s consulate office in Houston issued a statement saying it \u201cexpressed strong dissatisfaction\u201d with the team. \u201cWe have lodged representations and expressed strong dissatisfaction with the Houston Rockets, and urged the latter to correct the error and take immediate concrete measures to eliminate the adverse impact,\u201d the consulate general\u2019s office said in a statement Sunday. The Chinese league said Sunday on its official Twitter-like Weibo account that Morey had made \u201cimproper remarks regarding Hong Kong\u201d to which it expressed its \u201cstrong opposition.\u201d That underscores Beijing\u2019s extreme sensitivity about foreign attitudes toward the ongoing protests and increasing violence. China accuses foreign parties in the U.S. and elsewhere of encouraging the demonstrations. The protests that started in June over a now-shelved extradition bill have since snowballed into an anti-China campaign amid anger over what many view as Beijing\u2019s interference in Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy that was granted when the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997. Protests continued raging this weekend after the shooting of a 14-year-old boy Friday night \u2014 the second protest victim of police gunfire \u2014 stoked fears of more bloody confrontations. An 18-year-old protester was shot at close range by a riot officer last week. He was charged with rioting and assaulting police, while the younger teen was arrested. The Communist Party\u2019s official newspaper, People\u2019s Daily, said in a commentary that Morey touched China\u2019s bottom line: \u201cMorey\u2019s position is hurtful to Chinese basketball fans and is also an affront to the Chinese people.\u201d People\u2019s Daily also noted multinational corporations who likewise tested the line on Hong Kong have \u201cpaid a heavy price.\u201d"},{"id":31525,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/sam-presti-10-things-know","date":"2019-10-07","title":"Sam Presti: 10 things to know","content":" Sam Presti, executive vice president and general manager of the Oklahoma City Thunder, has gone from \u201cboy wonder\u201d to middle-aged in his position as the Thunder\u2019s chief basketball officer since 2007. Odds are, there have been days when Presti has felt even older, given the ups and downs, successes and failures, injuries, personnel comings and goings, and assorted headaches that come with his job. After a strong run through his first 12 seasons \u2013 a 558-410 (.576) regular-season record, nine playoff appearances in the past 10 years, four trips to the Western Conference finals and a loss in five games to Miami in the 2012 Finals \u2013 Presti is facing the first true rebuild on his watch. Gone are Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook, who earned league MVPs with OKC. So are All-Stars and big names such as James Harden (who became an MVP with Houston), Paul George, Serge Ibaka, Victor Oladipo and Carmelo Anthony. With all eyes on newcomer point guard Chris Paul as the next star Presti might trade in the coming months, here are 10 things to know about the man who will make that call (and countless others) for the Thunder again in 2019-20: \u2018C\u2019 student made good: Presti was born in Concord, Mass., an only child whose parents divorced when he was a teenager. A 2017 Sports Illustrated profile noted that he wasn\u2019t much of a student at Concord-Carlisle Regional High, but eventually got traction when he spent time with a group of mostly African-American kids bused from neighborhoods far from his suburb and the teacher (Harriett Stevens) who supervised them. As a basketball player, Presti impressed his teammates enough to earn the nickname \u201cBob Sura,\u201d after the Florida State product who played 10 NBA seasons. Teamwork, defense came early : Presti enrolled at Virginia Wesleyan and spent two years there before transferring to Emerson College as a way to get back to Boston. He served as a team captain in his junior and senior seasons, establishing himself as a player willing to chase 50\/50 balls and draw as many charges as possible. He also coaxed teammates to agree that, if one of them wasn\u2019t working hard enough, the others could vote that guy off the team. Of Presti\u2019s work ethic, Emerson coach Hank Smith told The New York Times in 2010 : \u201cThat\u2019s how he\u2019s been since the day I met him. He\u2019ll be like that today, tomorrow, the next time I talk to him \u2026 How does anyone drive themselves that hard, that long?\u201d A break, an internship, an NBA career: How did Presti get his big break? A teammate at Emerson got hurt and was thinking of quitting. Presti talked him into continuing. That player\u2019s father was the superintendent of schools in Aspen, Colorado. Every summer, San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich and GM R.C. Buford ran a basketball camp there. They needed one more camp counselor. The superintendent thought of the young man who had helped his son. Presti scraped up money to make the trip, and on the final day persuaded Buford to take him back to San Antonio as an intern. His salary? $250 a month. The opportunity? Priceless. Tony Who? Presti soon impressed Buford, Popovich and others in the Spurs organization with his energy and diligence. He tackled all the usual menial intern tasks, both basketball-related and otherwise. Buford later said, only partly in jest, that he might have learned as much from the Emerson kid as the kid learned from the Spurs exec. He was promoted quickly up the ranks in San Antonio, where his signature moment came in 2001. By then serving as assistant GM, poring over videos with Buford, Presti encountered a point guard from France who hadn\u2019t shown well in his workout. But Presti edited together a highlight reel of the guard\u2019s play, influencing the bosses to bring him back for a second look. Tony Parker \u2014 six-time NBA All-Star, four-time NBA champion and 2007 NBA Finals MVP \u2014 was still on the board when the Spurs made the final pick of the first round. The boss\u2019 choice : Lenny Wilkens, Hall of Fame player and coach, was serving as SuperSonics president in 2007 when the team needed a new GM. So he interviewed former Orlando exec John Gabriel and Atlanta assistant GM Gary Fitzsimmons. Meanwhile, team owner Clay Bennett \u2014 who had been a partner in the Spurs \u2014 interviewed Presti by himself. Guess whose opinion mattered most. Bennett even demoted Wilkens to \u201cvice chairman\u201d to eliminate any doubt about Presti\u2019s newfound power. Some in Seattle saw Presti \u2014 incidentally, the youngest GM in the league and one of nine at the time who had never played in the NBA \u2014 as the owner\u2019s puppet or front man, hired to take flak and run interference as the franchise was prepped for its relocation to OKC. He had upset many fans soon after taking the job by trading popular guard Ray Allen to Boston and forward Rashard Lewis to Orlando. Others, after meeting the so-called whiz kid, saw it differently. Jerry Brewer, a columnist for The Seattle Times , wrote that Bennett \u201cdidn\u2019t just hire some GM. He hired the absolute best man to step into this situation and thrive. He just ensured his franchise will be a contender within four years, possibly sooner.\u201d By then, the Sonics had morphed into the Thunder. MV3: Three weeks after Presti got his GM job in Seattle, he grabbed Kevin Durant second in the 2007 Draft, right after Portland took eventual flop Greg Oden. A year later, he zagged when others zigged, picking UCLA\u2019s Russell Westbrook fourth overall. In 2009, Memphis\u2019 choice of Hasheem Thabeet left James Harden on the board for Presti at No. 3. That trio not only helped OKC to the Finals in 2012, but also and perhaps even more impressively, earned the NBA\u2019s highest individual honor \u2014 Most Valuable Player \u2014 in 2014 (Durant), 2016 (Westbrook) and 2017 (Harden). No NBA exec has ever pulled off anything comparable. The (first) one who got away: In hindsight, Presti\u2019s 2012 trade of Harden to Houston \u2014 a pre-emptive move in deference to a looming tax bill, the bearded guard\u2019s contract demands and a belief that Ibaka would be more valuable \u2014 looks like a clear mistake. The Thunder haven\u2019t reached the Finals since, and of the pieces OKC got back, only Steven Adams (as a 2013 pick) brought long-term value to the Thunder. No one anticipated the cap soon would balloon by more than 60 percent (from $58 million to $94 million) in the four years after Harden\u2019s trade. Fifteen first-round picks \u2013 15! \u2013 by 2026: Presti, on behalf of the Thunder, voted against the NBA\u2019s recent revision of the draft lottery odds, flattening the chances of landing the top pick to discourage tanking. Smaller-market teams such as his lean more heavily on the draft for talent, with free agents less interested in signing there. No surprise then, when Presti did start his rebuild, that he prioritized picks over current players. Here is what the Thunder essentially have available over the next seven years (allow for some minor protection). And this is with Paul, Danilo Gallinari and others as trade bait before next spring: \u2022 Two 2020 first-round picks \u2022 Two 2021 first-round picks \u2022 Two 2022 first-round picks \u2022 Two 2023 first-round picks \u2022 Three 2024 first-round picks \u2022 One 2025 first-round pick \u2022 Three 2026 first-round picks Bang on the drum all day: When you get death threats in your day job, as Presti did after trading George to the Clippers this summer, it\u2019s important to have ways to decompress. In his case, that often means throwing on a pair of headphones and attacking the drum set he has played since his youth. A longtime jazz fan, Presti and friends recorded three CDs that were sold to benefit a children\u2019s charity in Boston. He burned mix CDs for coach Mike Brown when they both were in San Antonio, and consulted with famed musical brothers Branford and Wynton Marsalis about the parallels between jazz and basketball. Presti also is into meditation, sticks to a diet that\u2019s way healthier than yours and spends as much time as he can with his wife Shannon, son Nicholas and twin daughters Millie and Elise. And when he can, he\u2019ll binge on music documentaries that, for example, show how albums such as Pink Floyd\u2019s \u201cThe Wall\u201d or Jay-Z\u2019s \u201cReasonable Doubt\u201d came together. Following in his footsteps: Picture a lanky white guy, a Massachusetts native, playing hoops at Emerson College. He lands a gig as an intern with the San Antonio Spurs, rises through the ranks, then moves to the NBA team headquartered in Oklahoma City. Seen this movie, right? Except that this time, it\u2019s not Presti. It\u2019s Rob Hennigan, former Orlando GM who traveled an eerily similar path about five years after Presti. Hennigan, from Worcester, Mass., played for the same basketball coach at Emerson, Hank Smith. He spent four years with the Spurs, then was brought by Presti to Oklahoma City for another four. Shaking the young-visionary tree, the Magic hired Hennigan as Otis Smith\u2019s replacement in 2012. Despite similarities, Hennigan\u2019s boy-wonder term didn\u2019t produce results on par with Presti\u2019s. He oversaw the Magic\u2019s basketball operation for five seasons, during which the team compiled a 132-278 record, had three head coaches and never made the playoffs. Hennigan is back with the Thunder, re-hired by Presti with the new-agey title of \u201cVice President of Insight & Foresight.\u201d"},{"id":31524,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/first-preseason-coach-challenge-luke-walton-sacramento-kings","date":"2019-10-06","title":"Luke Walton first to win coach's challenge in preseason game","content":" Officially, it\u2019s an NBA first: Coaches successfully argued referees\u2019 calls Saturday. Sacramento\u2019s Luke Walton became the first coach to win a challenge \u2014 a new option for coaches to use in the NBA this season \u2014 when he asked for a review of an out-of-bounds call during the third quarter of the Kings\u2019 game against the Indiana Pacers in Mumbai, India. Review showed that Walton was right and the Kings retained possession. About a minute later, Pacers coach Nate McMillan wanted a review of a goaltending call made against Indiana center Myles Turner \u2014 and he, too, was proved correct, resulting in a jump ball at midcourt instead of two points for the Kings. So Mumbai becomes the answer to a trivia question \u2014 the site of the first successful NBA coaches\u2019 challenge. The Pacers and Kings wrapped up a two-games trip to India, the NBA\u2019s first two games played in that country, with Indiana winning 130-106 to complete a sweep of the series. \u201cThank you India for allowing us the opportunity to make history\u2026thankful to be a part of this moment,\u201d Sacramento\u2019s Richaun Holmes tweeted postgame. Coaches may challenge one call per game, provided what they\u2019re challenging meets certain criteria and if they have a timeout remaining.

And note both Lillard and McCollum opted out of participating in the 2019 FIBA World Cup, which took place Aug. 31 \u2013 Sept. 15 in China.

Last season, just six games separated the West\u2019s No. 2 seed from No. 8, and every team to make the playoffs won at least 48 games.

Houston star James Harden played 28 minutes and shot only 8 of 22 from the field and 4 for 14 from 3-point range, but hit 17 of 20 free throws to finish with 37 points . He also committed an offensive foul in the first half that Houston coach Mike D\u2019Antoni tried to overturn by using the one challenge coaches get per game this season. Replay showed that Harden hooked his defender\u2019s arm with his right arm while he dribbled with his left hand, so the call was upheld. After the game, D\u2019Antoni took a lighthearted approach to his using of the challenge and said he wasn\u2019t immediately sure the call was wrong when he decided to challenge it. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to screw up,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said, per ESPN\u2019s Tim MacMahon . \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a little adjusting. It takes a while to get used to. We don\u2019t have the regular flow of information that we\u2019ll have in a regular game. They\u2019ll tell me before that I should go out there and challenge.\u201d The coach\u2019s challenge is being tested by the NBA on a one-year trail. Starting this season (and in the preseason), each team has one challenge per game. The coach can challenge any personal foul called against his team throughout the game. In the first 46 minutes of the game (or the first 3 minutes of overtime), the coach can challenge a goaltending or basket interference call against his team or an out of bounds where his team is not awarded possession. To perform a coach\u2019s challenge, a team must call timeout prior to one of the following: the ball being given to a free-throw shooter, the ball being given to a player throwing the ball in or a referee tossing a jump ball. The coach signals for a challenge by twirling his index finger upward \u2014 similar to the replay signal \u2014 which will then be confirmed by the official if it is within the challenge rules. From there, a blinking \u201cchallenge light\u201d will signal courtside as the play is reviewed. D\u2019Antoni and LA Clippers coach Doc Rivers both said after Thursday\u2019s preseason game that their teams\u2019 analytics staffs have encouraged them to not look to save their challenges for end-of-game scenarios. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s going to be something that is going to take a little bit for us to get used to and when to use it,\u201d Rivers said, per ESPN. \u201cMy guess is we are going to use it first half, if it\u2019s one of your better players that you think didn\u2019t commit a foul, you may use it to make sure he gets the foul back. Analytically they said we should use it anytime which I don\u2019t agree with that. We\u2019ll see how it goes.\u201d Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":31547,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/kawhi-george-out-clippers-preseason-opener","date":"2019-10-04","title":"Kawhi Leonard, Paul George to sit out Clippers' preseason opener","content":" The Clippers\u2019 two-star debut will wait at least one more preseason game. Jovan Buha of The Athletic reports that coach Doc Rivers plans to sit Kawhi Leonard and Paul George in the team\u2019s preseason opener against the Rockets at Honolulu. Leonard chose the Clippers as his new team during the offseason free agency period after leading the Toronto Raptors to their first NBA championship. George leaped at the chance to join the Finals MVP in Los Angeles, requesting a trade from Oklahoma City that ultimately netted the Thunder the largest haul of draft picks in NBA trade history. Without their new stars, the Clippers will be headlined by defending Kia Sixth Man of the Year Lou Williams and energetic big man Montrezl Harrell. The Rockets are coming off a 140-71 preseason shellacking of the Shanghai Sharks on Monday. James Harden led the Rockets in the rout, earning a triple-double before halftime and finishing with 10 points, 12 rebounds and 17 assists in just 21 minutes of action."}]
