The Lakers won both contests to take a commanding 2-0 lead, from which only four of 34 teams in Finals history have ever recovered. Adebayo and Dragic have played essential roles in the playoffs, averaging roughly 38 points combined as the Heat upset the higher seed in three successive series to reach their first Finals since 2014.

Erik Spoelstra pointed to \u201canother level\u201d paramount to putting Miami \u201cin a position to have an opportunity; a real opportunity at the end,\u201d while Tyler Herro assured \u201cwe can give more\u201d for Sunday\u2019s Game 3 of this NBA Finals best-of-seven series. It all sounds nearly impossible, right? Perhaps it is, given Miami\u2019s 2-0 deficit to the Lakers after Friday\u2019s 124-114 loss , coupled with the prospect of All-Star forward Bam Adebayo (left shoulder and neck strain) and veteran guard Goran Dragic (torn plantar fascia) missing their second consecutive game due to injuries. > Finals Game 3: Lakers vs. Heat, Sunday at 7:30 ET on ABC The Athletic\u2019s Shams Charania reported Saturday that both will be listed as doubtful for Game 3. \u201cWe are down 2-0,\u201d said Tyler Herro, who filled in for Dragic in the starting lineup and finished with 17 points as the youngest starter in NBA Finals history (20). \u201cThe message is that our backs are against the wall, and how are we going to react? We can either fold or fight like the Miami Heat do. We know what kind of team we are. We know what we are capable of.\u201d The last time Miami endured a 2-0 NBA Finals deficit was in 2006 against the Dallas Mavericks. The Heat came back to win that series 4-2. In the midst of their sixth NBA Finals, having won titles in three of their previous five appearances, Miami is the first No. 5 seed to reach the NBA Finals in league history. So, the team\u2019s confidence under such daunting circumstances is perhaps warranted, given its experience. But the first two games haven\u2019t provided much evidence that leans towards a Heat rebound. Sure, Miami is 6-3 on the heels of a loss since entering the NBA bubble, but it\u2019s 0-5 this postseason when allowing more than 115 points. The Heat have allowed 116 points or more in each of the first two games. Meanwhile, this red-hot Lakers squad has won 10 of their last 11 outings this postseason and owns a record of 12-1 in Games 2 through 5 so far in the playoffs. \u201cIf you want something badly enough, you\u2019ll figure it out,\u201d Spoelstra said. \u201cOur group is extremely stubborn, persistent, and we just need to figure out how to overcome this opponent. We respect the quality, high quality, of the opponent that we\u2019re playing. You\u2019ve got to figure it out and overcome it.\u201d It won\u2019t be easy. LeBron James and Anthony Davis combined for 65 points in Game 2, after coming together for 59 in the opening game of the series. Los Angeles is 20-1 this season when its superstar duo combines for 60 points or more, and James owns a record of 24-0 when his team leads 2-0 in a postseason series. James walked away from Game 2 disappointed with the way Los Angeles played defensively. So, despite his team\u2019s 2-0 lead, James believes the Lakers can play better in Game 3 with Miami on the ropes. \u201cWe\u2019re playing against a very dangerous team in Miami, where they have five guys on the floor that are a threat,\u201d James said. \u201cSo, we have to continue to stay on our P\u2019s and Q\u2019s and cross our T\u2019s and dot our I\u2019s throughout the course of a game, and if we have a breakdown, be able to cover for one another. We definitely were not happy with our performance defensively [in Game 1]. Hopefully we can be \u2014 well, we know, not hopefully \u2014 we know we can be better in Game 3.\u201d Miami obviously, needs to be, too. But that\u2019s a difficult ask for a team reeling from the losses of Adebayo and Dragic with no clear indication as to whether they\u2019ll be ready to return for Game 3. Duncan Robinson finished as a team-worst minus-21 in Game 2, while taking just seven shots to draw the ire of Spoelstra. Meyers Leonard filled in for Adebayo in the starting lineup, and finished with seven points on just three shots, while Kelly Olynyk scored 24 points in 37 minutes. Kendrick Nunn played 29 minutes to help fill the void left by Dragic\u2019s absence and produced 13 points on 3-of-7 shooting. The Heat are now 2-4 in their last six games. James poses enough of a problem for Miami, coming off a near triple-double (33 points, nine rebounds, nine assists) in Game 2. Davis is averaging 33 points per game on 63.4% on two-point attempts so far this series, joining Michael Jordan (34.5 points per game on 69.0% from the field in 1991) as the only players ever to average 30 points or more per game on 60% or better from the field through their first two career outings in the NBA Finals, according to research from Elias Sports Bureau. Still, Miami appears to be undaunted by the enormity of the task ahead for Game 3. \u201cI think we just believe. We believe in one another,\u201d Butler said. \u201cWe believe in what we put together, and we believe in what we do every day. Like I said at the beginning of this thing, we\u2019ve got to play damn near perfect in order to beat those guys over there. We have yet to do it and if we don\u2019t do it soon, it\u2019s not going to be pretty.\u201d * * * Michael C. Wright is a senior writer for NBA.com.

The decision to restart and complete the 2019-20 season wasn\u2019t as much about basketball for the players as it was about staying vigilant and amplifying the social justice messages they championed in the wake of the George Floyd murder. How do you maintain momentum when the ball stops bouncing and the cameras are on longer pointed in your direction? What can you do to leverage your power and influence to affect meaningful change in communities far from this basketball ecosystem that served for months as an incubator for the initiatives? For the players, you forge relationships outside of the basketball world and you join forces with other members of that coalition seeking to impact change. You align yourself with people like DJ Set Free Richardson, the inspiration and the individual behind the development of the new  \u201c Play for Change\u201d campaign and logo, an idea from his creative group \u2014 The Compound \u2014 in partnership with the NBPA. Richardson, a noted artist\/filmmaker\/marketing guru and gallery owner (frequented by Kevin Durant, Carmelo Anthony among many others), is also the creator of the AND 1 Mixtapes. He\u2019s also a celebrated music DJ and fashion designer (see popular number 7 caps) who served as the lead on creative ad campaigns for Nike, adidas, New Era and EA Sports. Given his history with players past and present, he knew the time was right for something more than just a symbolic gesture to capture this moment in history \u2014 whatever comes next. Richardson took time out of his busy schedule editing a major sports and culture documentary to share some history, insights, observations and much more in this conversation with NBA.com \u2018s Sekou Smith. *** Sekou Smith: Being down here in Florida, my senses are heightened. I\u2019m observing every little thing, so when I see logos on T-shirts and sweatshirts, I\u2019m wondering what the genesis was for the \u201cPlay for Change\u201d logo and name? Set Free Richardson: Well, it started with COVID, right? COVID came and then the league was like, should we play, should we not play? And I was like, \u201cWow.\u201d I always think, \u201cHow can something be made to address something?\u201d Then I was like, \u201cOkay.\u201d So the first thing was just making a logo to represent the league because the Jerry West logo is legendary. It is what it is, but it just only speaks to basketball. And then, I was like, \u201cIt\u2019s not like a player logo that can address problems when they happen.\u201d And then George Floyd happened. So I was like, \u201cWow.\u201d Players was protesting, but they still didn\u2019t have a mark. And, of course, we connected with players and just everybody, we all connected with Black Lives Matter. But I just thought the athletes, they didn\u2019t have a mark.  So it was heavily influenced by what you saw and heard from the players? I loved what LeBron [James] was saying, and just everybody I\u2019m talking of, the players, from Carmelo to Kevin, just all the players that I\u2019m friends with. And I was like, \u201cYou know what? I\u2019m going to create a logo.\u201d And it was combined from the ideology of the NBA logo, the Jump Man logo, and then the Olympics, when [John Carlos and Tommie Smith] raised those fists in the air that said Black Power. Is there some significance to the silhouette logo, something that gives it a certain kind of recognition as a logo? S ilhouette logos are just \u2026 from Nike to the Rasheed Wallace, to LeBron even, has the silhouette logo. So it was just the powerful DNA, silhouette logos, to the history of logos. So then, Kyrie Irving was getting a lot of press and he was like, \u201cYou know, we don\u2019t feel we should play right now ..\u201d So the first idea of the logo, when I thought about the silhouette and then the fist raised, I had the saying like, \u201cHold the rock\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t stop the rock,\u201d because Kyrie basically said, \u201cLet\u2019s hold the rock and deal with what\u2019s going on in the streets right now.\u201d Once they decided to come here to Orlando and restart the season you shifted again? Yes, there are always two sides to things. If they were going to play and use their voices for to amplify a message about change, I wanted to capture that as well. Now I\u2019ve got both sides If you\u2019re not going to play, you hold the rock. If you do play, the fist represents your voice and it\u2019s speaking you to give truth for what you believe in and what\u2019s going on. And that\u2019s when the slogan \u201cPlay for Change\u201d came from, because now I felt like I can represent both sides of the ball, both sides of the players\u2019 views, and I have the logo that combines everything. And not just social justice, because I see it can go broader. It started because of social justice, but if players want to voice something about breast cancer, they want to voice something about healthcare, or police brutality, now there\u2019s a logo that we can connect to all these things. It sounds like you felt the need to find something to help focus all these different perspectives and energies into something easier for people to absorb and comprehend? Yeah. For me, I totally felt like it, you know. A lot of these players are my friends. A magnifying glass was on their voices and what they were saying, but there wasn\u2019t an image for them. If you look at the image in Play for Change, you get it from just looking at it. You\u2019ll understand it, like, \u201cOh, I get what this is about.\u201d So I definitely felt like, and if I could be the one that come up with something to help magnify their voices, I feel like I\u2019m pointing in the direction of doing a good job. I know this is one of multiple partnerships you\u2019ve had with the NBPA in terms of your working with them. What is it about these guys, and you mentioned that some of them are your friends, but what is about this generation of players and how they\u2019ve connected to the culture that has served an inspiration for you as an artist and creator? I think just this generation of players has found technology. So I\u2019ll put it under the bubble of technology, because what happened with the players from the \u201960s to the super early 2000s, where we only got to see them on the court. In the the late \u201870s and early \u201880s, a lot of NBA games weren\u2019t even broadcast. So now, we got phone technology, we got social media technology, we have fashion. I swear it\u2019s been meaningful, the runway in and out of games of what just all the players are wearing fashion-wise. Every T-shirt is a message or statement. I just think that technology has exposed the 360 degrees of a player. These guys are so specific about what they wear and what type of statement they are making with their attire. They know everybody\u2019s watching them. Do you think this is more about them being mindful, especially in these sensitive times, of how responsible they have to be with what they have on their chests or on their backs? Yeah. I think one is, they all wearing what they believe in, you know? When you just watch the games now, look at the messages that\u2019s on the back of the jersey and then think about the player. Some of them got education reform, unity. So it\u2019s the individuality . If we\u2019re seeing it on the court from the names, if they already took it that far on the court, you definitely know they\u2019re thinking about what they\u2019re wearing off the court. And also, it still ties in with fashion. I\u2019ve seen some of the greatest messages on TV, but still mashed up with the latest Nikes, with the hats and all. So I definitely think they\u2019re aware. I think they\u2019re wearing them in a way that\u2019s noticeable, fashionable, and it represents who they are. What did you think of the league\u2019s rule allowing certain slogans and statements on jerseys? I know there was a big debate about that when it was being discussed before we got down here to Orlando, whether or not that was a smart idea, whether or not it would turn people away or turn people off, seeing it. Did you agree with that? And what do you think the impact has been of that? I mean, well, first the impact. Let\u2019s say, to me, the NBA is the number one trailblazer in sports in the universe. So literally we have seen two weeks ago that the NFL has put sayings on the back of their helmets after the NBA do that. Then I think certain soccer teams also did it, but for doing that, it\u2019s, to me, 99.9% good. I can\u2019t see nothing wrong with voicing a message. I can\u2019t even say anything bad about it. I think it was great that they gave a selection of quotes and sayings. I think it was important that they let players from all races, colors, creeds, age groups pick what fit them. I just think that that DNA should be across sports. I\u2019m talking hospital uniforms, restaurants. I think that everybody could take a page out of that book. I thought it was really cool too, that some of the international players had the expressions in their native languages. You talk about the league being influential around the world and the culture, I thought that was really something that set it apart. And as you mentioned trailblazing, the WNBA has been right there at the forefront of it as well. Totally. I didn\u2019t mean to forget about the WNBA. They\u2019ve been unbelievable. Totally committed to the fight for change. And that\u2019s another silhouette logo I love, and I\u2019m mad I can\u2019t find one of those orange hoodies. That WNBA orange hoodie with the silhouette, that was another thing that I saw that made me feel like I was on the right track. We\u2019re going to get some distance from 2020 at some point. And when we do, what do you think this will all look like to us in hindsight? It feels like this was part of an awakening that happened for the younger generation and really for all of us. This year, it put a lot of people in self-reflection through quarantine. I think that\u2019s where it started. This is the most we ever looked in the mirror because we\u2019ve been in the house this much in 2020. So a lot of self-reflection, and then, through the quarantine, connected to the social justice and the incidents that happened, it exposed a lot of things. And one of the things that I feel that it brought on, a positive, is a lot of unity in a lot of different cultures, races, and in the sports world, it just did so much in magnifying the players voices, the messaging, the unity, and camaraderie of team on and off the court, and just that team aspect of just people in general. And that, to me, brought a great surge of unity. Everybody\u2019s exploring for change, and people are looking to fight and work towards change, and not just sit back and accept the same old standards. At a time when it seems so easy to focus on the divisions, \u201cPlay for Change\u201d seems like it\u2019s asking people to dive deeper into the message. You wanted it to be comprehensive and welcoming, as opposed to just a mass statement, something that brought people together ?  Yeah. Totally. And I think that\u2019s what I was saying earlier about, hearing Kyrie\u2019s message but also taking into consideration LeBron\u2019s message of talking to President [Barack] Obama, of talking to Carmelo and using the platform they had. So in life, in my marketing world, I always look at everything. In life, you got your left hand and you got your right hand. And I wanted to make sure that \u201cPlay for Change\u201d could sit the middle on both sides, but both sides respect the other side, you know? So when people see it, they can say, \u201cI\u2019m not playing, but I respect that.\u201d Or they can say, \u201cI am playing, but I can respect the other side on that.\u201d At the end of the day, we\u2019re all in this together. * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

Bam Adebayo was out with a neck strain, leaving Kelly Olynyk and Meyers Leonard (who had played just once in the postseason) as the Heat\u2019s only rotation players taller than 6-foot-7. With Leonard in the starting lineup, the Heat played man-to-man to start the game. But after Olynyk checked in, made a 3, and committed a non-shooting foul, the Heat went to their 2-3 zone for the first time, having played it for just two possessions in Game 1. They would go on to play zone for 58 defensive possessions, 63% of Game 2. And it sort of worked. It\u2019s not good that the Lakers scored 74 points on those 58 possessions (1.28 per possession), but L.A. scored 50 points on just 34 possessions (1.47 per) otherwise. > Finals Game 3: Lakers vs. Heat, Sunday at 7:30 ET on ABC Here are some key possessions against the zone\u2026 1. Seal in the paint  The Lakers mostly attacked the zone by having somebody \u2014 James, Davis, Alex Caruso or Rajon Rondo \u2014 flash to the middle of the paint. The Heat would try to close that passing lane, but on a couple of occasions, James sealed the nearest defender off to create a passing lane\u2026 James got a layup for himself with similar seal late in the fourth quarter. 2. Over the top  The Lakers have the best set of lob threats in the league. Kyle Kuzma isn\u2019t one of the top four, but late in the second quarter, he was looking for a lob behind the zone. He didn\u2019t get it, but he flashed to the middle of the paint, pulling Olynyk up from the basket. James then followed behind Kuzma, catching a lob from Rondo. One thing to note on that play is the lack of pressure on Rondo, making it easy for him to throw the lob. 3. Crashing the glass  The Lakers had 21 second-chance points in Game 2, with 16 of the 21 coming against the zone. Six of those 16 came from Davis on a three-possession sequence midway through the third quarter, with the middle of the three offensive rebounds being the most spectacular\u2026 After those three straight offensive boards, the Heat tried harder to keep Davis off the glass. He still grabbed five more offensive boards , totaling eight for the night. 4. ATO \u2013 James to the seam  At the start of the fourth quarter, the Lakers drew up a play for James to attack the seam of the zone. Rondo pitched the ball over to James, who attacked the weak-side seam and got an interior screen from Markieff Morris, keeping Olynyk from being able to step in front of the drive. 5. Some settling  The Lakers\u2019 execution against the zone wasn\u2019t perfect. After scoring 20 points on 12 zone possessions in the third quarter, they scored just 21 on 19 zone possessions in the fourth. There were possessions when they couldn\u2019t get the ball into the paint and settled for long or contested 3s. Here was one low-energy, fourth-quarter possession that helped the Heat hang around a little longer than they probably should have. Bam or no Bam?  The Heat would have more options defensively with Bam Adebayo, but he\u2019s doubtful for Game 3. Either way, that doesn\u2019t mean they should abandon the zone. As noted above, though the Lakers had the third most efficient Finals performance of the last 24 years , they were less efficient against the zone than they were otherwise. A lot of that was about the shots they were getting. Against the zone, 36 of the Lakers\u2019 66 shots came from 3-point range and they had a free throw rate of just nine attempts per 100 shots from field. Otherwise, only 11 of their 31 shots were from 3-point range and they had a free throw rate of 35 attempts per 100 shots from the field. A lot of the zone 3s were open and in-rhythm, but against the Lakers, those are preferable to dunks, layups and free throws from Davis and James. Whether they\u2019re in man or zone, Adebayo\u2019s presence would help prevent some of the interior stuff, along with some of L.A.\u2019s second-chance opportunities. * * * John Schuhmann is a staff writer for NBA.com.

Harris spoke with NBA.com\u2019s Brian Martin to discuss the award, a coaching career that spans 60 years and some of the great players he coached along the way. Martin: Can you tell me how much this award means to you, especially since it is a recognition by your peers in the coaching fraternity and named for the late great Chuck Daly? Harris: This is really a special honor because there\u2019s nothing like being recognized by your own peers, people that you worked with or against. For it to come from NBA head coaches is extremely exciting and humbling because I was fortunate to be able to coach at a time when some of the greatest coaches in the history of the game were working and that\u2019s who I had to go against. And Chuck being one of those who was a master coach and someone that everybody had the highest respect. I just looked back at when I was first an NBA head coach in 1979, and look at the list of the 21 head coaches there were \u2014 there are only 21 teams then \u2014 and it\u2019s just an honor roll of coaches that I had to go against as a rookie NBA coach. I wasn\u2019t a rookie, I coached 20 years, but I was a rookie head NBA coach. This was what I call \u2014 and many others call \u2014 the golden years of NBA coaching and of basketball itself in the 80s and early 90s. If you look at the teams in 1979-80 and see who the coaches were, it\u2019s just amazing. Almost all of them have been highly honored right down to a man. My first year I had to start out on the road. I had a one-year contract for $70,000. And in the first three games I\u2019ve got to go against Bill Fitch, Dick Motta and Red Holzman, and then come home against Slick Leonard and Hubie Brown. That was my first five games right there. I got off to a shaky 2-7 start after nine games. And I was thinking, man, it\u2019s going to be a short career. And then we won seven in a row; fortunately for me or would we wouldn\u2019t be talking right now. Which coaches were most influential to you in terms of the knowledge you gained from them and how you developed your style of coaching? Keep in mind, this was 61 years ago that I started in 1959. I was going to be a preacher, but I was told that I should work at least a year before I went to grad school. And if I wanted to do that, my major professor had a job for me \u2014 coaching junior high boys and girls. So, I did that and it turned out so incredibly well, that just was a message to me that this is what I was supposed to do. And so that\u2019s what I\u2019ve done ever since. During that time, I was able to learn from reading books and watching teams and great coaches. The guys that I leaned on the most were John Wooden and Dean Smith, and the recently late wonderful coach Garland Pinholster, who was a great writer of books and a great coach at Oglethorpe University. There were just a few books out there and we didn\u2019t have games on TV, just one game a week is all you could see. There just wasn\u2019t the emphasis on the NBA; the NBA was fourth on the totem pole of pro sports at the time. As a result, I just learned from everybody that I could, and those guys were most instrumental, but I also learned as I went along and even learned from players that I coached. When you reflect on your coaching career \u2014 from high school, college, the G League, the ABA, the NBA, FIBA competitions like the Olympics and World Championships \u2014 there have to be so many memorable moments. Are there any that stand out above the rest? All of it just amazes me. I was blessed to be able to get those opportunities; it\u2019s beyond comprehension really for me. I was the first in my family to graduate from college. My parents were married at the beginning of the depression and I was born during the depression and grew up during World War II, so there was never any expectation of anything like this. Probably the weirdest moment is that I would be the first foreign head coach in communist China. That didn\u2019t fit my pattern, but it was a great experience. We had a bunch of super guys; of course, everybody knows the great Yao Ming, but there were so many others. Fortunately, it was a young team that they gave me in 2004, hoping that I could help them get ready for 2008 Olympics in Beijing. As it turned out, almost every one of the guys I had on the 2004 team is now coaching at a high level in China. In fact, the national coaches of the women\u2019s and men\u2019s teams are two of my former players. The current champion was one of them as well as the top GM, and the head of basketball itself in China, Yao Ming. All those guys have done well, and I stay in touch with them as I\u2019ve been back there several times. I also owe so much to Puerto Rico. I was coaching small college ball at Earlham College in Indiana for nine years. In the last seven years, I had the great opportunity to coach in the pro league, the superior league in Puerto Rico. I was given the opportunity because they had read some of the stuff that I\u2019d written in periodicals and books, and they called me up. I had never even heard of summer basketball in Puerto Rico, but I went down there and coached for seven years. I coached against ABA and NBA guys, and was fortunate enough to win three championships. Tom Nissalke, the ABA coach at Utah Stars, asked me to come and be his assistant coach. I\u2019d have never gotten there had it not been for Puerto Rico. I was coaching small college ball, and I could have won 30 games a year for 30 years and getting an ABA job just wouldn\u2019t have happened. Looking back on these kinds of things makes me so grateful. With so much international competition experience \u2014 coaching and working with teams from Puerto Rico, Canada, China, Dominican Republic and the United States \u2014 can you discuss the importance of that work in terms of growing the game globally? I really was in a situation to see the NBA grow and the international game. Coaching in Puerto Rico, I was fortunate enough to become a national head coach for two international events, filling in for the regular coach would could not participate at the time, and started coaching against Italy, Yugoslavia, Brazil and more. I ended up going to Europe a number of times during the summer once I was in the ABA and NBA and did clinics and camps. I\u2019ve taught basketball on five continents in 15 different countries. I have seen how things went from where nobody was in the NBA from Europe and South America, to where now you\u2019ve got a little more than one quarter of all players in the NBA being , foreign born. I started in the NBA in the year of the merger. I was coaching in the ABA with the Utah Stars and when that folded, fortunately, my head coach Tim Nissalke, got the head coaching job with the Rockets and asked me to go with him, which I did. That first year of the merger is a pivotal point in NBA history because they brought in Dr. J [Julius Erving] and Ice Man [George Gervin], Moses [Malone], and all these great players. I saw it grow from that period of time. And when I was first head coach in 1979, the first game I coached was against Larry Bird in his rookie year. I faced Magic Johnson in his rookie year, and then lo and behold, I would end up end up being Magic Johnson\u2019s last coach. Then when I joined the Mavericks here in 2000, I saw Dirk develop into such an international star. Dirk really changed the stretch game, even though Jack Sikma had been the first seven-footer to shoot over 200 threes with me in Milwaukee. But Dirk just changed the whole nature of the outside game for big men. And then Steve Nash, he\u2019s responsible as much as anybody for three ball we see today. The things that Steph Curry, James Harden and these players do, that paradigm was started in Phoenix after Steve left Dallas, which was unfortunate for us. And it\u2019s just blossomed ever since. In a career that spans 60 years, you\u2019ve seen the game evolve and change through different eras, with multiple commissioners and transcendent stars from Magic and Larry, to Michael, to Shaq and Kobe, to LeBron and Curry, to Luka and so many others. Your first NBA head coaching job came in the same year the NBA added the 3-point line and now we\u2019ve seen the game evolve from being dominated by big men to a 3-point revolution with shooters all over the court. What are your thoughts on the state of the game today? I preferred the style of play in the 80s and early 90s, which was more ball and player movement, team motion, and involving all the players, a little less one-on-one but appropriate one-on-ones for sure. But I will say this, the big man is not dead. To think that Shaq wouldn\u2019t be able to play in the league now, because he wouldn\u2019t be able to shoot 3-pointers and he had trouble with free throws, is a stretch. You wouldn\u2019t keep Kareem out of there because he wasn\u2019t shooting three balls and so on. The teams that are still alive in the Finals have key, big men playing for them. And they may not be low post players, but they are goaltenders and they do score in the paint. There\u2019s still many ways that a big man can be used. The 3-point shot depends on two things, the ball going inside and then kicking outside. There\u2019s two ways to do that. The way they\u2019re doing it now is all the dribble penetration, which makes the defense have to shrink and absorb. And then if it doesn\u2019t, the player either gets to the rim or shoots a shot up there; if the defense does shrink in on him, then he kicks it out for an open look on the outside right away or after one more pass, something like that. The other way to do that is to have a big man inside who can draw a double team \u2014 has to be good enough to draw a double team and then skilled enough to pass out and find open teammates. I was fortunate enough to coach seven centers over my career, I\u2019m not going to say I developed them or anything, but I worked with them. Seven of them are Hall of Fame players. I was also fortunate enough to have been involved on the same team with five of the top 10 scores in the history of the game. That may soon change. The only threat to the top 10 right now is Melo. He could pass up Elvin Hayes at 10 and could pass up Moses at nine, but they\u2019re not going to get Dirk, Shaq or Kobe. As you just mentioned, over the course of your career, you had the opportunity to coach some of the greatest players in the history of the game \u2014 Magic, Kobe, Shaq, Moses, Barry, Dirk, Yao just to name a few. What was it like for you to coach those players that would go on to become legends in the game? When I talk about the big number of Hall of Fame players that I was able to be on the same team with in one capacity or another, it seemed like they were either really young or toward the end of their career. For example, I didn\u2019t have anything to do with the development of Rick Barry or Magic or Sydney Moncrief or Bob Lanier, whom I was able to spend a little time with when I was working with Nellie [Don Nelson] the first year back in 1983-84. The guys that I had as youngsters were Moses and Kobe, they were guys that didn\u2019t go to college. I was first with Moses at the Utah Stars, but that didn\u2019t last long because our team folded before the season ended \u2013we folded at the end of November. I ended up coaching with the University of Utah the rest of that year. But without my relationship with Moses, I would never have gone anywhere in the NBA because we were able to get Moses to Houston the next year. He had gone in the expansion draft. He went to Portland, but they didn\u2019t need him because they had Bill Walton, they traded him to Buffalo and Buffalo just didn\u2019t use him. We were able to give them two first round picks and get Moses down to Houston my first year as assistant coach under Tom Nissalke. As a result, we went to the final four that year, and Tom was Coach of the Year. I then coached Moses as the head coach from 1989 to 1992-93, and he actually had his best three years numbers wise when I was head coach. His last year, he was MVP for the second time and averaged 31 points and 15 rebounds, but Philadelphia offered him $13 million. Our owner, who had just bought the team for $9.5 million, said no way he can go. So that\u2019s the year my team won 14 games, with the expectation that we would get Ralph Sampson in the draft, which they did, but I never got the coach him. I had Moses for those six years and then I was able to get him back when I was the coach of the Milwaukee Bucks near the end of his career. He and I remained friends until the very end. I talked to him two days before his death. We were in contact many times, many times over the years. Then with Kobe, I only got to be with him his first two years plus 12 games. He was 17 when we signed him and had just turned 18 heading into his first year. He\u2019d missed training camp because he broke a bone in his hand, he was playing outdoor ball at Venice Beach because he couldn\u2019t wait for the season to start. He was good by the end of that first year and was a big part of the rotation by the end of the year. The next year, I didn\u2019t start him because we had a great team. We won 61 games and he was our third leading scorer and runner up for Sixth Man of the Year in the league. It was just worked out better that way. And I love using a sixth man. Ricky Pierce was my sixth man at Milwaukee. Calvin Murphy was my sixth man at Houston. I\u2019m a believer in the sixth man, even going back to my college years. The next year he was a starting lineup and I had him for 12 games [before being let go]. He was averaging 20 points and 10 rebounds, believe it or not. He ended up averaging a little less than 20 points and, and quite a bit less rebounding. We had already beaten San Antonio twice in those 12 games who won at all that year. But I was let go and I had to watch him from afar and well sometimes real close because he got 43 on us one time, 42 on us another time, and in the 16th time we played him when I was with the Mavericks, he got 62 in three quarters. And he joked about that, how he hated me so much because I wouldn\u2019t let him play, so he scored that 62 points for me. And he told me, \u201chey, I was just joking, they [media] took it serious.\u201d I figured if he had that much animosity toward me, he would have shown it the first time he played against us in 2000, when he scored 16 points against the Mavericks and we beat them. I didn\u2019t buy that one and he didn\u2019t either, but the media did, so it goes down in history that way. But I will say he had a winning record against us at the Mavs, even though our Mavs teams were really good. I mean whether I was with Nellie or Avery [Johnson], we averaged 58 wins for seven years. So, we were good, but Kobe was better. And obviously the basketball world \u2014 and really the entire world \u2014 was stunned by his tragic passing earlier this year. The tragic part about Kobe\u2019s dying is that when he died, I was twice as old as him. I was 82 and he was 41. Over the last 10 years of his life, he had shown such maturity and leadership and concern for others that you know, it wasn\u2019t there at the beginning because he was so singularly focused on being the best player he could be, that\u2019s all he thought about for the first several years. And, that\u2019s really what it takes, I mean, that\u2019s what the great ones do. I don\u2019t care who \u2014 Tiger Woods or Michael Jordan, any all-time great \u2014 whether it\u2019s in baseball, basketball, football. If you\u2019re going to be one of the all-time greats, it doesn\u2019t just happen. It\u2019s not just \u201cHey I\u2019m on the team, I\u2019m automatically going to be great.\u201d You have got to be focused \u2014 and he was. But then he really matured and changed. And my point is that it\u2019s obvious with the stuff that he was doing with his organizations and things, the Mamba Foundation and all that, he was going to do more if he were able to live the 41 years that I got, he was going to do more in those years than he had done previously. We just talked about some of the legends that you coached during your career, and speaking of legends, you\u2019re still working in the league with the Texas Legends. At 83, I think you have earned the title of the ultimate hoops lifer. I\u2019m curious why it\u2019s important to you to still be involved with the game now. And, and what impact are you hoping to have on the players and the coaches and the teams that you\u2019re working with? I wrote my last book five years ago; I\u2019ve written six of them and a number of articles and things over the years. With the clinics I\u2019ve done around the world and in 30 states, it\u2019s always been my goal just to help the game like it helped me. I got whatever I knew from others and I\u2019m willing to pass on whatever it is I have that people can use. I have quite a big correspondence with coaches around the world actually. Whether on LinkedIn or just here in the States and locally. So as long as anybody wants to ask me a question, they think I can answer, I\u2019ll give it a shot. I just I like being around it. Coaching is what I do in life, but it\u2019s not my life. And there\u2019s always a difference. I don\u2019t think that a person should say his work is his life; life as much more than one\u2019s work, but your actual life can put meaning into the work though. And that\u2019s what I hope to do. And as long as they\u2019ll have me, I\u2019m available."},{"id":733,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/5-things-learned-2020-finals-game-2","date":"2020-10-03","title":"5 things we learned from Game 2 of 2020 Finals","content":" Five things we learned from the Los Angeles  Lakers\u2019 124-114 victory  over the Miami Heat in Game 2 of the 2020 Finals Friday in the Orlando bubble: * * * It certainly was a little-brother Game 2. That\u2019s when an outcome never is in doubt and barely even competitive, thanks to the older-brother Lakers sensing they could grab control (mostly with their offense) whenever they needed to do so. Miami essentially was kept on a bungee cord all night. Sometimes they were way behind, sometimes they were closer. After the Lakers got out in front by eight points deep into the first quarter, the closest the Heat got that period was six. In the second, L.A.\u2019s lead grew to 13, dwindled to four, then jumped up to 14 by halftime. Second half, more of the same: Up by 18, never leading by less than nine in the third. Then double digits for all but 20 seconds in the fourth. \u201cKujos,\u201d as Michael Jordan used to say, to those viewers who stuck with it to the inevitable end. Playing without point guard Goran Dragic (plantar fasciitis) and center Bam Adebayo (neck\/shoulder strain), two of its three best players, as it did Friday, Miami was pretty much airport code \u2014 MIA \u2014 on its way to a 2-0 hole. Not to say there isn\u2019t hope, considering that four teams in Finals history have overcome that start. The 1969 Celtics, the 1977 Trail Blazers, the 2006 Heat and the 2016 Cavaliers each clawed back to eventually celebrate. But Bill Russell, Bill Walton and Dwayne Wade aren\u2019t walking through that door, and when LeBron James does so for Game 3 on Sunday  (ABC, 7:30 p.m. ET) , he\u2019ll be turning left for the opponents\u2019 locker room. Miami can muster as much spit \u2018n\u2019 vinegar as it wants, but its words aren\u2019t going to hurt and its punches aren\u2019t going to land as long as the Lakers have a hand on their forehead, keeping the littler fellas at an Anthony Davis-arm\u2019s length. \u201cWe\u2019re never giving up,\u201d Heat leader Jimmy Butler said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to fight and we\u2019re going to ride with this thing until the wheels fall off. It\u2019s not over. We\u2019re just down 0-2, so we got to do something special. We\u2019re capable of it and I wouldn\u2019t want to be in the trenches with any other guys except for the ones that we have.\u201d Except for maybe Russell, Walton, Wade and\u2026 A case can me made for Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, a handy Derringer of a player who always seems good for a couple of timely shots each game. Alex Caruso shines, but mostly because he continues to be grossly underestimated. Kyle Kuzma? Not yet. It\u2019s pretty clear now that the third-best, certainly the third-most valuable and important Laker in the postseason behind James and Davis is Rajon Rondo. The 34-year-old veteran of 14 NBA seasons and deep playoff runs in his long-ago Boston incarnation has been indispensable for several reasons. Perhaps the biggest is the trust coach Frank Vogel and teammates have in Rondo to run their attack. Against Miami, that means a creator savvy enough to see what\u2019s needed \u2014 for instance, getting into the heart of the Heat\u2019s zone defense with the ability to make plays. A second benefit is that when Rondo has the ball in his hands, James doesn\u2019t have to. Now that he\u2019s 35, if James had to play the 39 minutes he logged in Game 2 the way he used to play five or 10 years ago, he\u2019d be tuckered out or cramped up before the buzzer. This way, Rondo gets LeBron off the ball, enabling him to conserve energy on offensive possession (and take off defensive possessions less often). It\u2019s worth a historical note here: Rondo moved up to sixth on the all-time NBA playoffs assists list Friday and now has 1,063. He passed Larry Bird (1,062) and Steve Nash (1,061) with 10 in 26 minutes. \u201cI didn\u2019t grow up with hoop dreams,\u201d Rondo said. \u201cThe past names that I passed in the playoffs from Isiah [Thomas] to Michael [Jordan] to Kobe [Bryant] to Steve and Larry. I couldn\u2019t even dream of that opportunity. \u2026 I played with a lot of great teammates that obviously made shots for me.\u201d That brings us to a third reason Rondo has been L.A.\u2019s No. 3: Now he\u2019s making shots for his teammates. Specifically, those desirable ones from the arc. In Rondo\u2019s first 96 appearances over seven postseasons from 2008 to 2017, he shot .266 (29 of 109) on 3-pointers. In his last two playoff runs, though, he has shot .439 (25 of 57). So far in this series, he has taken nine, made four. The Heat\u2019s best player \u2014 in Dragic\u2019s and Adebayo\u2019s absences, definitely \u2014 took heat on the broadcast of Game 2 from Mark Jackson for not seeking out his own shot more often. We won\u2019t nitpick with that, even though Butler\u2019s 1-of-3 shooting didn\u2019t capture the eight free throws he had shot to that point (which suggests four more shots for a 28-attempt pace for the game). Jeff Van Gundy chimed in, too, after Butler a couple of times too often attacked the paint, got near the rim, went into the air \u2026 and predictably looked for a Heat teammate on the perimeter to whom he could pass. As skilled and strong as Butler is, Van Gundy said, he first should be looking to score. There\u2019s a case to be made that Miami needs Butler to go off for 15-20 points in the first quarter Sunday, particularly if the cavalry doesn\u2019t arrive via his two injured cohorts. It might take pressure off other guys to know the scoring load won\u2019t fall so much to them. Maybe it would get the Lakers\u2019 defense to scrambling in a way they wouldn\u2019t enjoy. Then again, Vogel and his crew could concentrate on choking off Butler completely, daring \u2014 who, Tyler Herro, Kendrick Nunn or Kelly Olynyk to carry the day in a must-win Finals situation? Butler finished with 25 points, eight rebounds and 13 assists. He shot 12 free throws, twice what anyone else on the floor managed. This is throwback stuff to the criticism LeBron has taken in his career for favoring the \u201cright basketball play\u201d over scoring a boatload of points. More points for Butler would have meant fewer for teammates he wouldn\u2019t have passed to. Besides, offense wasn\u2019t the Heat\u2019s problem. And let\u2019s not forget that early Jordan scored 63 in a playoff game and lost because he didn\u2019t have much help. \u201cI will continue to play that way because that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to win, that\u2019s how we played all year long,\u201d Butler said. \u201cJust because we\u2019re in the Finals it\u2019s not going to change.\u201d Scoring points wasn\u2019t Miami\u2019s problem \u2014 everyone one in their authorized bubble party would tell you 114 should have been plenty to win. But their zone defense configurations never really stymied the Lakers, who seemed almost giddy in hoisting 47 3-pointers, as long as they could exploit the Heat\u2019s tactic inside as well. And exploit they did. L.A. made 33 of 50 2-pointers, scored 56 points in the paint and turned 16 offensive rebounds into 21 second-chance points. The Lakers also outscored the Heat by 15 on 3-pointers alone, lousy percentage or not. Why play zone when the results were so bad? Miami was thin on alternatives, with its best defender (Adebayo) out and targeted guys such as Herro and Duncan Robinson playing extra minutes. Also, Miami coach Erik Spoelstra didn\u2019t question the strategy as much as the execution. Going zone has some natural downsides \u2014 blocking out for rebounds gets trickier, and there\u2019s a passivity that can settle in compared to man-to-man. Still, Spoelstra expected more individually within that team framework. Said Spoelstra: \u201cI don\u2019t think it really would have mattered man or zone, there was probably eight, 10 of those possessions where we just did not finish it with that next level of commitment. \u2026 This opponent is going to require us to go there.\u201d Enough with all the talk about who isn\u2019t available for Miami. Let\u2019s talk about someone who is: Udonis Haslem. U.D., as he\u2019s known. Or the OG, as teammates call him. If only the veteran forward could get on the court and focus his wrath on the Lakers the way he did on the Heat huddle during a third-quarter timeout. That was a blistering, a testosterone-fueled challenge to his teammates to play harder, get tougher and \u201cempty\u201d their tanks, Butler said later. It was not suitable for the airwaves. The Heat briefly showed some life after that. \u201cMaybe he should just start the game off cussing people out,\u201d Butler joked. Better still, in a series without any real dislike or certainly rancor among the players, Haslem could sprinkle a little by knocking around James and his new Super Friend Davis. Theoretically, anyway, since at 40, Haslem played only 44 minutes all season and hasn\u2019t touched the floor in the playoffs. No one would dare say the Heat players don\u2019t respect and heed Haslem\u2019s advice. Having him in uniform \u2014 in warm-ups, at least \u2014 gives his voice a little extra heft, in boss Pat Riley\u2019s mind, compared to sitting in a suit in the second row. But this series is past exhortations. Haslem could lead by example, if only for a few bumpy-bangy minutes at a time. If you don\u2019t have your Bam, you have to find someone else to lay a little wham on the too-comfortable Lakers. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

He\u2019s been on point every other time during this magical Miami Heat run to The Finals. He called his shot as the teams descended upon the NBA bubble in July; Butler said the Heat were here to win it all, even if no one else believed in them. He had no idea his point guard and Heat playoff star Goran Dragic (left foot injury) would go down in Game 1 and be ruled out for Game 2 and more. The Heat won\u2019t have All-Star Bam Adebayo either, that shoulder injury he suffered in that Game 1 blowout to the Los Angeles Lakers keeping the young center from suiting up here Friday night at AdventHealth Arena. There\u2019s a Game 2 or bust feel to this series for the Heat, who were already a decided underdog before they got started and even moreso now that they\u2019re without two starters \u2014 Meyers Leonard and rookie Tyler Herro moved into the starting lineup in place Adebayo and Dragic, respectively. And they both made 3-pointers early to keep the Heat close early and giving a little life to Butler\u2019s \u201cnext man up\u201d theory. But a sincere belief in a plan works for only so long. Reality has a way of snapping you out of that dream state where anything, literally anything, is possible: 24 \u2014 Six quick points on 3-for-3 shooting and a block on a Butler layup from Dwight Howard has all of Southwest Atlanta on fire for the resurgence of the one-time best big man in basketball. His spice since being inserted into the mix late in the Western Conference finals against Denver has provided the beef and blunt force the Lakers were looking to use against a smaller Heat team. #ATLShawty 23 \u2014 The Lakers are showing great patience in their offense, shooting over and passing around and through the cracks of the Heat\u2019s 2-3 zone, cracks that look mighty without Adebayo in the middle. They are only shooting 30% (6-for-20) from deep with 8:07 to play in the second quarter. But their 10-point lead seems like a more commanding grip on this game than the scoreboard suggests. 22 \u2014 Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said he hadn\u2019t forgotten about Rookie of the Year runner-up Kendrick Nunn, whose playoff role was significantly impacted by a positive COVID-19 test. It allowed Dragic to assume that starting role and flourish before suffering his injury. But Nunn popped in the fourth quarter of Game 1, with the game already decided, of course. \u201cYeah, we haven\u2019t forgotten what he can do,\u201d Spoelstra said. \u201cThis is, sometimes you have to separate all this, the competition and coaching and your team and just the human side of it. You\u2019re rooting for the guy. He had a tremendous year. We haven\u2019t forgotten about that. And I\u2019ve had great compassion for everything that he\u2019s gone through. But he\u2019s got significant perseverance. He\u2019s been through a lot and he just continues to grind. I love watching him work. I just love coming in every day and just watching him put in the time and be ready for his opportunity when it inevitably would happen.\u201d Nunn popped again in Game 2, bringing good energy in 14 minutes off he bench and scoring seven points to help the Heat stay close in the second quarter. If the Heat plan on stealing a game in this series, I believe it will have to be the one where Nunn goes off (in conjunction with Butler and either Tyler Herro and\/or Duncan Robinson) in a 3-point storm. 21 \u2014 The Twitter love affair with Alex Caruso continues \u2026 and with good reason. 20 \u2014 That Lakers\u2019 bench was outstanding in the first half, led by Rajon Rondo (nine points, four rebounds, two assists), Kyle Kuzma (eight points), Caruso (six points) and Markeiff Morris (four rebounds, three points). I don\u2019t know how any team \u2014 the Heat at full strength or anyone else \u2014 would be able to deal with a Lakers team where LeBron and Anthony Davis are playing as well as they did in the first half, and with ample backup from their supporting cast. Just don\u2019t see how it could be done. 19 \u2014 What kind of first half was it for the Heat?  18 \u2014 I got Fat Joe with the front row spot and Desus (of Desus and Mero) second row, far right. Beyond those two, I\u2019m lost. I saw LL Cool J on the board earlier \u2026 at least I think I did. Been in the bubble long enough now where you start to question yourself sometimes. 17 \u2014 This is just way too easy for AD. I\u2019m starting to agree with the crowd that says he should have been higher than sixth in the Kia MVP voting. I was conflicted with how to gauge he and LeBron\u2019s value playing off each other. But he\u2019s making a story case right now for Finals MVP. My man @realtuffjuice is right: 16 \u2014 My GOAT Charles Woodson saying what the rest of us are thinking. I don\u2019t know what it looks like on TV but I promise you, it doesn\u2019t feel like two teams playing on the same level. It\u2019s just difficult to see a window for the Heat right now. They are at such a disadvantage without Bam and Dragic. 15 \u2014 At this point, Spo might as well put UD in the game! 14 \u2014 To their credit, the Heat cranked up the energy after their leader and OG vet lit into them. They are attacking the basket and the bench is energized as well. Down 100-89 with 90 seconds to play in the third quarter. Maybe they\u2019ve found something to work with here to really get all the way back into this game. A compelling finish is all we\u2019re asking for. 13 \u2014 #anOG@work \u2026 Just watch the video! 12 \u2014 Every time the Heat make a little headway and cut into this lead, the Lakers come back with a 3-pointer on that zone to keep them on the end of that jab. The heads in the Heat family section go back every time. But at least we\u2019ve got a game (111-101 Lakers with 9 minutes to play). 11 \u2014 Nothing but respect for Rondo\u2019s game. To still be this impactful speaks volumes about him. 10 \u2014 Nunn with the low-key play of the game for the Heat. A ridiculous block on AD at the rim. Somebody better get that clip because it\u2019s going on Nunn\u2019s rookie highlight reel. 9 \u2014 Lakers leaning on that size advantage around the rim now that the 3-pointers aren\u2019t falling. The nightmare of LeBron and AD attacking you inside and out is pressure the Heat will continue to struggle with in this series. No way around it. Lakers\u2019 rebounding edge is only 39-33 with 4:36 to play, but 14 of those are offensive rebounds. That\u2019s an absolute backbreaker in a 115-104 game. 8 \u2014 Some of the LeBron debates can get extremely trivial. But this one makes pretty good sense to me. No need for artificial enhancers. 7 \u2014 It took AD forever to get his first points of the fourth quarter (a dunk) but he played excellent defense all the way through. Just a menace in the passing lanes and recovering. 6 \u2014 We\u2019re going to have to hear this Kelly Olynyk chatter after this. I can already feel it coming. That\u2019s what happens when you go for 24 points (9-for-16, 3-for-7 from deep) and 9 rebounds off the bench in Game 2 of The Finals.  5 \u2014 Magic\u2019s smiling after the Lakers\u2019 124-114, but the Heat made things interesting down the stretch. They gave chase this time, which was nice to see after Game 1.  4 \u2014 It felt like a 3-point party every time the Heat made a move. The 16-for-47 night from deep, though, tells a different story. Lakers win this series pounding their advantage in the paint and around the rim. 3 \u2014 Who you got for Finals MVP after two games? It\u2019s tight right now. Careful with that narrative business, though. 2 \u2014 AD with the exclamation point on the win for the Lakers. They remain undefeated in the Mamba jerseys (Kuzma says wear them for two more). 1 \u2014 Cannot say enough about Rondo (heard him say the other day he doesn\u2019t care much for the Playoff Rondo moniker). If the Lakers have a No. 3 star on this team, it\u2019s the veteran point guard who hasn\u2019t been on this stage in a decade. It\u2019s a do-or-die Game 3 Sunday for the Heat. * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

Per team policy, terms of the deal were not disclosed. Rivers will serve as the 25th head coach in franchise history, after a seven-season run as the head coach of the L.A. Clippers. Prior to being named the head coach in Los Angeles, Rivers spent nine seasons with Boston, where he led the Celtics to an NBA title in his fourth season. His 91 career postseason victories are the second-most among active NBA coaches and rank seventh all-time in NBA history. In his seven seasons with the Clippers, Rivers led the franchise to the fifth-best record in the NBA (564-356, .631), reaching the playoffs six times. Rivers\u2019 Clippers earned 50-plus wins in four straight seasons from 2013-17, including a franchise-record 57 victories in 2013-14, when Chris Paul and Blake Griffin each earned All-NBA honors. \u201cWe are thrilled to welcome Doc Rivers to Philadelphia as the new head coach of the 76ers. Doc is one of the most respected and accomplished head coaches in the NBA,\u201d Brand said. \u201cI believe Doc can help us unlock our full potential on the floor and further our pursuit of an NBA championship. I also respect and appreciate that his impact extends far beyond the basketball court as he truly embraces the platform he has to drive positive change in society. Doc is a great fit for our team and city, and I\u2019m excited for what the future holds with him as our head coach.\u201d In 21 seasons as an NBA head coach with the Clippers, Boston and Orlando, Rivers holds a 943-681 (.581) career record. His 943 wins are the second-most among active NBA coaches, while ranking 11th all-time in league history. Rivers\u2019 teams have qualified for the postseason in 16 of his 21 seasons. \u201cI am really excited about the opportunity to be joining a world-class franchise, a franchise whose legend inspired my nickname,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cThis is a city that loves sports and loves their teams. It\u2019s a city that values hard work and that is exactly what we are going to do and who we are going to be. We are ready to do good things in Philadelphia.\u201d  In Boston, Rivers amassed a 416-305 (.577) record over nine seasons, including consecutive 60-win campaigns from 2007-09. Rivers led the Celtics to a 59-47 (.557) overall playoff record during his tenure, reaching the 2010 NBA Finals, in addition to defeating the Lakers in the 2008 Finals. Prior to Boston, Rivers spent four-plus seasons with Orlando, earning NBA Coach of the Year honors in his first season as an NBA head coach. He\u2019d go on to lead the Magic to three consecutive postseason appearances from 2000-03. Prior to coaching, Rivers was selected by Atlanta with the No. 31 overall pick in the 1983 NBA Draft, following a standout career at Marquette. A one-time All-Star, Rivers appeared in 864 games (605 starts) over 13 NBA seasons with San Antonio, New York, the Clippers and Atlanta, tallying 10.9 points, 3.0 rebounds, 5.7 assists and 1.8 steals in 27.3 minutes per game. As a player, Rivers\u2019 teams made the playoffs in 10 of his 13 seasons, as he appeared in 81 career postseason contests, notching 11.4 points, 3.3 rebounds and 5.9 assists. Rivers remains Atlanta\u2019s all-time leader in assists, with 3,866 for his Hawks career, over 100 more than the next-closest player. Internationally, Rivers represented the U.S. at the 1982 FIBA World Championship, leading his country to a silver medal, and earning tournament MVP honors after averaging a team-best 18.6 points per game. Over his three-year collegiate career, the Chicago-area native posted 13.9 points, 4.6 assists and 2.3 steals. His No. 31 was retired by the Golden Eagles on Feb. 14, 2004."},{"id":1033,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/76ers-hire-doc-rivers-head-coach","date":"2020-10-03","title":"76ers hire Doc Rivers as head coach","content":"Doc Rivers has been named the head coach of the Philadelphia 76ers, the team officially announced on Saturday. Rivers became available on the coaching market earlier this week when he and the LA Clippers parted ways. He went 356-208 over seven seasons with LA. ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski was first to report the news of Philadelphia\u2019s hire. Rivers, 58, takes over for Brett Brown, who was fired after the 76ers were swept by the Boston Celtics in the first round of the Eastern Conference playoffs. Philadelphia is headlined by former top Draft picks Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons, who both became All-Stars and led the Sixers to two straight trips to the Eastern Conference semifinals. But Simmons missed the 2020 postseason with a knee injury and neither Embiid nor the players brought in recent years could provide enough scoring in clutch situations against Boston. The Sixers believed they were ready to contend for their first championship in 37 years and Brand spent $180 million to re-sign Tobias Harris and nearly $100 million to sign free agent Al Horford away from Boston. Instead, the Sixers had only snippets of consistent success and Brown paid the price. The longtime San Antonio Spurs assistant was let go on a contract that runs through the 2021-2022 season. General manager Elton Brand said after he fired Brown he would evaluate the front office and consider more changes but doesn\u2019t plan to trade either of his two top stars. \u201cI\u2019m not looking to trade Ben or Joel,\u201d Brand said days after the season ended. \u201cI\u2019m looking to complement them better. They are 24 and 26 years old, respectively. You try to make that fit as long as you can. They want to be here, they want to be with our organization and I see them here for a long, long time.\u201d Brand has not made any changes to the front office while he settled on a coach. Tyronn Lue, who coached LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers to an NBA championship, and Mike D\u2019Antoni, who departed from the Houston Rockets, also were in contention for Rivers\u2019 job. Rivers went 356-208 over seven seasons with the Clippers, taking them to the West second round three times. Rivers, who played 13 seasons in the NBA, hiring means the league remains at four Black coaches currently with jobs. He is 1,624-943 in nearly 21 seasons as an NBA coach. He was the 1999-00 NBA Coach of the Year. Rivers visited with Brand and Sixers ownership Wednesday and the organization wasted little time striking to make a deal with the 58-year-old coach.

You say the Lakers still had Magic Johnson, who won MVP that season. Well, yeah, but halfway through Game 2, he was done too, another Laker star hamstrung by a damaged hamstring. For the rest of that series, or what was left of it, whatever segment of the basketball audience that didn\u2019t drift away was treated to generous doses of David Rivers and Tony Campbell against Isiah Thomas, Joe Dumars and Vinnie Johnson. If you weren\u2019t born yet or weren\u2019t into basketball then or simply missed it, well, it went just as you might imagine. It was an anti-climatic Pistons sweep and \u2026 you see where we\u2019re going with this? Here at the 2020 Finals, the Miami Heat were down two very important players Friday for Game 2 and unsurprisingly are now halfway to oblivion in this series after getting swamped by the Lakers again , 124-114. It\u2019s such a raw deal, for a No. 5 seed that scrapped its way through the East and arrived with the underdog\u2019s twinkle, for the fans who stayed patient through a pandemic-interrupted season only to see a short-changed Finals. For them, and for Pat Riley. Riley, you see, coached that Lakers team three decades ago, and he built this Heat team, and this is now the second time in his substantial basketball career where he\u2019s been dealt pain and misery at the absolute wrong time. Obviously, this series isn\u2019t over yet, not officially anyway, but that sound you just heard is the fat lady clearing her throat. > Finals Game 3: Lakers vs. Heat, Sunday at 7:30 ET on ABC There\u2019s two more games, minimum, for Bam Adebayo and Goran Dragic to heal in a hurry, two more games for some suspense to infiltrate the locked-down Disney campus, and if none of that happens, then the only realistic drama will be when Anthony Davis and LeBron James arm wrestle for the Finals MVP award. There\u2019s a developing sense of deflation about this series, and the powerful scent of finality wafting in. This has plenty to do with the fractured state of the Heat combined with the gargantuan presence of Davis and LeBron. It\u2019s a concoction that\u2019s fortifying the Lakers and poisoning the Heat. Yes, Heat coach Erik Spoelstra became big mad at a postgame question about the perception of The Finals being already over two games in, saying \u201cWe don\u2019t give a [crap] what the world thinks.\u201d But his team better bring that same energy starting Sunday in Game 3. And even if they do, will it really be enough? Seriously, what switch can Miami flip at this point? Adebayo suffers from neck and shoulder issues while Dragic has a plantar fasciitis injury. Maybe Adebayo recovers in time for Game 3; Dragic has lingering pain in his foot and that could restrict him should he play. Adebayo is the only interior defender on a team that\u2019s getting mutilated in the paint. Dragic is Miami\u2019s leading scorer in the playoffs and a valued shot creator. There\u2019s only one day off before the next game, which means the scheduling is showing no sympathy for the wounded, either. Spoelstra implored his team passionately, maybe even desperately, to find \u201canother level.\u201d But there\u2019s only so many more stairs that a young team without a superstar \u2014 all due respect to Jimmy Butler \u2014 is capable of climbing. It might be more wishful thinking and motivational talk than anything else. The bigger problem for the Heat is that they offer little resistance for LeBron and Davis even if Adebayo and Dragic are good to go. The two superstars took turns walloping Miami once again, delivering 65 points and 23 rebounds of punishment, just too much size and flex and talent for Miami to handle, especially around the rim. \u201cWe want to do whatever it takes to help our team win,\u201d said Davis. \u201cWhen you got two guys who want to win as bad as we do and be dominant every game, you have games like we had tonight.\u201d Lakers coach Frank Vogel said: \u201cThey attack the defense. They both have the ability to score against single coverage. They both have that elite ability to read defenses. Both are extremely determined to win the championship and bring the ability to play at an elite level.\u201d It\u2019s gotten to the point where reporters are comparing LeBron and Davis to Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O\u2019Neal during that early 2000s Lakers dynasty, mainly because this series isn\u2019t giving us anything else to discuss. And that\u2019s the point: LeBron and Davis are battling Laker history more than they are the Heat. Like, which one is Kobe? Which one is Shaq? We\u2019ve already arrived at that stage in the search for talking points. \u201cTo be in the conversation with those two guys is very humbling,\u201d LeBron said. For the record, Davis is averaging 33 points on a lethal 63% shooting mainly because Miami can\u2019t put a body on him within 15 feet of the rim; he also had eight offensive rebounds. LeBron flirted once again with a triple double in Game 2, coming up a rebound and assist short along with 33 points, and is directing his team like Coppola did \u201cThe Godfather\u201d. Spoelstra tried throwing a zone defense at the Lakers and it largely backfired; LA was 33-of-50 on 2-point shots and at one point their overall field-goal percentage was even better than that. Miami can\u2019t offer much resistance against the Lakers, even on a night when L.A. misfired for dreadful stretches from deep. The Lakers had 68 points by halftime, and that\u2019s when a Miami team must ask itself some very hard questions. \u201cIt just goes to playing hard, putting your nose to the ball \u2026 we didn\u2019t rebound, we didn\u2019t get back on defense,\u201d said Butler. \u201cWe got to stop them from dunking and getting layups and free throws. If we do that we might be all right.\u201d Yes, might. Butler played all but three minutes and was more active earlier than normal; his 25 points, eight rebounds and 13 assists were badly needed production. And Kelly Olynyk did something with his increased playing time by scoring 24 points in 37 minutes. Yet once again, Miami\u2019s margin for error in this series is linguine-thin. Collectively, the group must overachieve, if that\u2019s possible, and time is running short. \u201cIt\u2019s not over,\u201d Butler said. \u201cWe\u2019re just down 0-2.\u201d Well, sure, that\u2019s factual. \u201cI think if we get more shots up we\u2019re in a better position,\u201d he added. \u201cI like what we\u2019ve been doing. We just got to play harder and really get locked in. We do that, we turn this thing around.\u201d Yes, more positive talk. And about Bam and Dragic, who aren\u2019t feeling 100%? \u201cYeah, we miss those guys for what they do on both ends of the floor. They wanted to play. We need those guys and want those guys but we want them to have a long career and whenever they do get back in the series, we want them to be ready to go.\u201d Three decades ago, Pat Riley\u2019s former team scrambled for answers and solutions after suffering a pair of injuries and never found them. The 1989 Finals wobbled and staggered toward a quick finish that everyone saw coming. And so here we are, once again. For Riley, this is developing into a case of d\u00e9j\u00e0-boo-hoo . For the Heat, this a challenge that\u2019s probably beyond their capabilities. For the viewing audience, this will really test its love and patience for basketball. For LeBron James and Anthony Davis, this Finals MVP award could be the biggest battle they\u2019ll see in the series. For the 2020 NBA Finals, unless the basketball gods are setting us up, this looks like a wrap. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

In what was a very different game from Game 1, the Lakers got 65 combined points on 64% shooting from LeBron James (33, along with nine rebounds and nine assists) and Anthony Davis (32 and 14 rebounds) to keep the Miami Heat at bay for a 124-114 victory in Game 2 of The Finals on Friday. Playing without starters Goran Dragic and Bam Adebayo, the Heat got a big game (25 points, eight rebounds and 13 assists) from Jimmy Butler. For just the third time this season , they shot at least 50% from the field, at least 40% from 3-point range, and at least 90% from the free-throw line. But Miami just couldn\u2019t get the stops it needed to make things interesting down the stretch. One stat stood out from the rest as the Lakers took a 2-0 series lead. 134.8 \u2014 Lakers\u2019 points scored per 100 possessions. That was the third most efficient Finals performance in the 24 years for which we have play-by-play data, topped only by the Cavs\u2019 137 points on 95 possessions ( 144.2 per 100 ) in Game 4 in 2017 and the Celtics\u2019 131 points on 96 possessions ( 136.5 per 100 ) in Game 6 in 2008. The Heat had their most efficient game of the playoffs (114 points on 91 possessions), and they lost by double digits. Counting the regular season, they were 22-1 when they scored at least 118 per 100 prior to Friday. After being on the wrong side of a wide free throw disparity in Game 1, the Heat outscored the Lakers 31-10 at the line in Game 2. They also outscored them 42-38 in the restricted area. But from outside the restricted area, the score was Lakers 76, Heat 41. The zone did its job in keeping L.A. (mostly) away from the basket and off the free-throw line. The percentage of their shots that came in the restricted area (27\/97, 28%) was their second-lowest rate of the playoffs. And the Lakers\u2019 free throw rate (17.5 attempts per 100 shots from the field) was also their second lowest of the postseason. But they were 9-for-11 ( Davis and James were each 4-for-5 ) on non-restricted area shots in the paint and a solid 5-for-12 from mid-range. Often, when a team is shorthanded, it will shoot a ton of 3s, going for a win by variance. On Friday, it appeared that, with the zone, the Heat\u2019s strategy was for the Lakers ( a bottom-10 3-point shooting team in the regular season) to launch from deep early and often. And the Lakers set both a Finals record and a franchise postseason record with 47 3-point attempts. They didn\u2019t shoot the lights out, but they were good enough, making 16 (34%) of those 47 3s. Starting guards Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and Danny Green were a combined 3-for-19. But James (3-for-8) and Davis (1-for-1) made their share and the Lakers\u2019 bench was 9-for-19 from deep. It was a wild game, with the teams combining to score 74 points on just 43 possessions (1.72 per) in the third quarter. As dominant as the Lakers looked at times, they kept the Heat hanging around, because they couldn\u2019t get stops themselves. But the defense didn\u2019t matter, because the offense was off the charts.

Adebayo is dealing with issues with his left shoulder and the left side of his neck. Dragic tore his left plantar fascia in Game 1. ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski was first to report Adebayo\u2019s status, following up to note the Heat hold out hope that Adebayo might return for Game 3. Shams Charania of The Athletic reported that Dragic would be out as well. Both were evaluated and treated multiple times Thursday and Friday, without enough improvement to give either of them a chance to get on the floor for Game 2. The Lakers won Game 1 easily, 116-98. \u201cI\u2019ve had to play the role of not just head coach but almost a parent the last 24 hours,\u201d Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. \u201cThese two guys are really amazing. Like everyone in our locker room, there\u2019s a real special sense of brotherhood and responsibility and they\u2019re both lobbying to play. Ultimately, I had to take the decision out of their hands for tonight.\u201d It\u2019s the first time Adebayo has missed a game because of injury this season. He played in 158 consecutive regular-season games before sitting out Miami\u2019s meaningless regular-season finale in the bubble back in August. The Heat announced Meyers Leonard and rookie Tyler Herro would join the starting lineup. Herro \u2014 who started only eight games in the regular season \u2014 was tabbed to make his first playoff start in Dragic\u2019s vacant backcourt spot, and Meyers Leonard was picked to start at the center spot for Adebayo. Spoelstra indicated that many players would get a swing at Adebayo\u2019s minutes. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to do this by committee,\u201d Spoelstra said. Leonard started each of Miami\u2019s first 49 games before getting hurt in February, badly spraining an ankle. He has played sparingly since, playing about 56 minutes in three appearances off the bench \u2014 only one of those coming in the postseason. Heat coach Erik Spoelstra explained after Thursday\u2019s practice that Adebayo\u2019s latest setback is different than the injured shoulder he suffered against the Boston Celtics in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference Finals. \u201cIt\u2019s on the same side, so it\u2019s easy to draw a comparison,\u201d Spoelstra said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a different injury.\u201d Adebayo suffered the neck injury when he slammed a shoulder into Dwight Howard while driving into the lane with 7:03 remaining in the third quarter of the team\u2019s Game 1 loss. The team confirmed that X-rays taken at the arena were negative. But Adebayo was already clearly favoring the injury suffered in the conference finals, as he wore a sleeve on his left arm. Adebayo scored eight points to go with four rebounds in 21 minutes of action of Game 1. With Adebayo out for Game 2, it\u2019s likely Spoelstra will try to replace his production on both ends of the floor with two players in veterans Kelly Olynyk and Meyers Leonard. Though Leonard was a starting cog prior to the season hiatus, he hasn\u2019t played since Sept. 4, when he logged nine minutes in a win over Milwaukee. Olynyk, meanwhile, is averaging 5.8 points and 4.2 rebounds in the playoffs. \u201cWe know exactly what Meyers and Kelly bring to our team, and hopefully we can exploit that to the best of our ability,\u201d Heat forward Jae Crowder said. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s the game plan. We know exactly how they can affect the game; just a matter of us putting them in position to help us win games.\u201d With Dragic also doubtful, Miami will likely turn in part to first-team NBA All-Rookie guard Kendrick Nunn, who started 67 games during the regular season, but has averaged 12.4 minutes per game in the playoffs. Nunn played nearly 20 minutes after Goran\u2019s injury in Game 1 and contributed 18 points on 8-of-11 shooting off the bench. Nunn arrived at the NBA bubble 25 days later after testing positive for COVID-19, and largely fell out of Spoelstra\u2019s postseason rotation, as he struggled to regain his rhythm from before the league\u2019s hiatus, which started in March. \u201cIt\u2019s just tough to see him in this position because he cares about the game, cares about his teammates, and he really wants to win,\u201d Miami superstar forward Jimmy Butler said on Thursday about Adebayo. \u201cObviously, we want him out there with us. We know that we need him. He\u2019s been huge for us in the playoffs all year long in the sense of doing whatever he was asked to do, come off the bench, start, score, facilitate, whatever. \u201cBut it\u2019s bigger than basketball. We care about him as a person. We want him to be right. I can talk to him as much as I can, but you can hear that pain in his voice, of him feeling like he may have let us down. But he did not, and I want him to know that. He\u2019s carried us to this point, and it\u2019s only our duty to pay that back to him right now.\u201d There has been no final determination for the availability of Adebayo and Dragic for Game 3 of the series on Sunday night. \u201cThey are our warriors and are continuing to try to lobby,\u201d Spoelstra said. \u201cBut they just need rest and recovery.\u201d Information from The Associated Press was used in this report. * * * Michael C.

Harris, the 2020 recipient of the Chuck Daly Lifetime Achievement Award announced Friday by the National Basketball Coaches Association, didn\u2019t simply grow up and begin a lifetime of coaching at an elementary school in small-town Indiana. He actually attended the famous 1954 state high school championship game between Milan and Muncie Central that inspired the movie \u201cHoosiers.\u201d Still has the ticket stub to prove it. In fact, Harris\u2019 connection to the NBA goes back further than that, all the way to the start. The fellow wearing No. 11 who jumped center for the New York Knicks in Toronto on Nov. 1, 1946, in what became the first NBA game in history, was a fellow native of Plainfield, Ind. Harris didn\u2019t just know him \u2013 he worked as a teenager in the summer of 1952 for Weber\u2019s homebuilding business. What stands out especially in NBA terms about Harris\u2019 career is how he has been at the forefront of so many developments, tweaks and changes in the game. And not just in a Forrest Gump way as a random bystander \u2013 the man has been part of some of the league\u2019s greatest innovations in style and play. The way Harris used first Rick Barry and then Robert Reid to initiate offense for the Rockets in the 1970s and \u201880s, a persuasive case can be made (and the coach has made it) that he was responsible for the wave of \u201cpoint forwards\u201d that followed, including Marques Johnson, Paul Pressley, Scottie Pippen, all the way to LeBron James. He became an avid architect of zone defenses for Dallas when the NBA opened the door with a 2001-02 rule change. He thrived with a traditional, dominant low-post center in Moses Malone in Houston, then came up with an entirely different scheme in Milwaukee where Jack Sikma\u2019s shooting range made him an arguable pioneer as a \u201cstretch five.\u201d So Harris\u2019 trademark as a coach likely was his adaptability, even though chameleons often don\u2019t get noticed. \u201cI was flexible,\u201d Harris said in a video news conference from his home that featured remote appearances by NBA commissioner Adam Silver and Dallas Mavericks coach (and NBCA president) Rick Carlisle. \u201cIf it called for slowing the game down, pounding it in, we did that. If it called for a moderate pace \u2026 we did that. If it called for up-tempo with the Lakers, we did that. \u201cThere are a lot of ways to win the game. And I\u2019m telling you, the big man is not dead. There are two ways to get the defense to shrink in. One is off penetration, which they tend to do, almost all of \u2018em now. And the other is to throw it inside, draw the double and then find open people. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me that if Shaq were to play today he wouldn\u2019t get in the game because he doesn\u2019t shoot the three ball. He would get in the game. He would be the game.\u201d Harris became a giant of basketball in his own quiet way. Raised in basketball like so many kids in his state, he enrolled and played at Milligan College in Johnson City, Tenn., with the idea of becoming a pastor. But waiting for his girlfriend to graduate, and heeding the advice of a professor to earn a little money before heading off to the seminary, Harris took a job at King Springs Elementary, where he coached boys\u2019 and girls\u2019 teams. After his boys started putting up 100 points a game playing six-minute quarters, people began to notice and Harris got hooked.  From there, everything has played out in an expansive, remarkable rush, from his climb up the high school ranks to the nine years he spent at Earlham College, a Quaker school where his teams posted a 175-70 record. His love of the game led him over time to author six books about basketball and coaching. The first one, \u201cMultiple Defenses,\u201d became a popular teaching guide and got him a call from a team in Puerto Rico in 1971. The seasons were flipped there \u2013 basketball in the summer \u2013 so a number of NBA and ABA types would head there in the offseason for extra cash. Harris made connections, one of whom was Tom Nissalke, an assistant coach who was bouncing between the two U.S. pro leagues. When Nissalke got hired to coach the ABA Utah Stars in 1975-76, he hired Harris as his assistant. Hurting more than most in a financially strapped league, the franchise folded a mere 16 games into what became the ABA\u2019s final season. But when Nissalke surfaced the next year as coach of the Houston Rockets, he again called Harris. And when Nissalke resigned in June 1979 (to take the Utah Jazz job 24 hours later), the Rockets chose Harris to step in. By 1981, Harris, then 43, had led Houston to the NBA finals against the Boston Celtics \u2013 the 40-42 Rockets remain the only sub-.500 team to reach the championship series. He later coached the Milwaukee Bucks and Los Angeles Lakers, earning NBA Coach of the Year honors in 1995 after boosting L.A. from 33 victories to 48 \u2013 in the season before O\u2019Neal and Kobe Bryant arrived. Harris joked Friday about what some consider the highlights of his vast coaching career. \u201cI\u2019m known as Kobe\u2019s first coach, Magic [Johnson\u2019s] last coach and I\u2019m in the movie \u2018Space Jam,\u2019\u201d Harris said, laughing. It\u2019s way more than that, though. Harris compiled a 556-457 (.549) record in 14 NBA seasons. He took his teams to the playoffs 11 times. He was an assistant coach for 18 years, including six in Dallas late in his career as reportedly the league\u2019s highest-paid assistant under Don Nelson and Avery Johnson. He wrapped up with a season each in support with the Bulls and the Nets. \u201cDel is like an encyclopedia of basketball,\u201d Dallas legend Dirk Nowitzki told Mavs.com, when informed of Harris\u2019 Daly award. \u201cI would always go to Del and see what he has to say because he knows so much. He\u2019s been around forever.\u201d Harris held a variety of jobs, titles and gigs in and around his official coaching stints, including a heavy dose of international work as the NBA was gaining traction globally. He wound up coaching in more than 400 FIBA games for national teams in Puerto Rico, Canada and China as head coach, and assisting squads from the U.S. and the Dominican Republic. He coached Yao Ming with China, one of dozens of great players and eventual Hall of Famers Harris touched over time. Seven centers he coached, including Moses Malone, Sikma, O\u2019Neal and others, made it to Springfield, Harris recalled Friday. Eight of his assistants went on to become NBA head coaches. Harris, now 83, remarked that of the 14 previous winners of the Daly award, he went up against \u201cabout every one of them\u201d in what he called a \u201cgolden era of coaching.\u201d Boston\u2019s Tom Heinsohn was the first recipient of the award created in 2009 to honor longtime Detroit Pistons coach Chuck Daly. Other winners have included Tex Winter and Jack Ramsay in 2010, Lenny Wilkens in 2012, Bernie Bickerstaff in 2014, Jerry Sloan and K.C. Jones in 2016 and Frank Layden last year. Recipients are chosen by a committee of some of the NBA\u2019s top coaches and executives, including Pat Riley, Donnie Walsh, Gregg Popovich, Billy Cunningham, Phil Jackson and others. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

That\u2019s why the All-NBA superstar holds Anthony Davis in such high regard. \u201cJealousy and envy [have] killed a lot of great things, not only in sports, but in general,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re able to just throw your egos to the side but continue to bring that confidence of what you\u2019re trying to do \u2014 not saying it\u2019s that easy \u2014 but for us, it\u2019s that easy when it comes to our relationship. We\u2019re not jealous of each other. I think that\u2019s the best thing.\u201d > Finals Game 2: Heat vs. Lakers, Friday at 9 ET on ABC The evidence continues to present itself on the court, where the duo combined Wednesday for 59 points in Los Angeles\u2019 116-98 rout of the Miami Heat in Game 1 of The Finals . Nobody expected such a simpatico flow between the stars last summer, but it\u2019s precisely what the organization craved when bringing in Davis via a July trade from New Orleans in exchange for Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart and a slew of draft picks. Davis becomes an unrestricted free agent at the conclusion of The Finals, and prefers to keep the focus on now, instead of the future. Undoubtedly, his close relationship with James paired with winning a first NBA title could go a long way toward keeping the power forward in purple and gold on a long-term deal. That could ensure the Lakers remain in the mix for championships for years to come. \u201cIn professional sports, you have guys that join forces to become alpha males; that\u2019s what they call them,\u201d James explained. \u201cTwo guys that have been dominant in a specific sport on their own respective teams, they get together, and they talk about how dominant they can be, and they talk about this is going to be this and that. \u201cI believe jealously creeps in a lot, and that is the absolute contrary of what we are. We know who we are. We know what we\u2019re about. We want the best, seriously, every single day both on and off the floor for one another. We\u2019re just not jealous of one another. I think that you align that with respect, I think the sky\u2019s the limit.\u201d Interestingly, James\u2019 thoughts on the relationship with Davis came the same day former teammate Kyrie Irving uttered remarks that were sure to offend a few teammates from the past. Now paired with Kevin Durant as a Brooklyn Net, Irving spent some time on the debut episode of his new teammate\u2019s podcast, \u201cThe ETCs with Kevin Durant.\u201d Irving was asked whether he or Durant would take the final shot for Brooklyn with the game on the line. \u201cDepends on who\u2019s hot,\u201d Irving said, before adding later that \u201cI felt like I was the best option on every team I\u2019ve played for down the stretch. This is the first time in my career where I can look down and be like, \u2018That [expletive] can make that shot, too.\u201d If we\u2019re being honest, so could James. He still can. James captured a championship in 2016 with Irving and the Cleveland Cavaliers, and is now three victories away from winning his fourth ring to join teammate Danny Green, Robert Horry and John Salley as the only players to win titles with three different teams. Davis jokingly admitted that James\u2019 hardware is the only thing worth a little envy these days. \u201cBut he made a promise to me, and so far, he\u2019s kept it,\u201d Davis said. \u201cHopefully, I don\u2019t have to be envious of that much longer.\u201d Michael C.

Del has been a trusted friend to the game of basketball for over 6 decades. Our sincerest congratulations to Del on this well-deserved and prestigious recognition.\u201d \u201cIt is truly a special honor to be recognized by fellow Coaches and to be added to the list of outstanding Coaches and men who have had the privilege of being recognized along with the great Chuck Daly,\u201d said Del Harris. \u201cChuck was a master Coach who combined style with technical command, but beyond that was his ability to lead with a firm but soft hand, it seemed to me. He was a tough opponent, but a friend\u2014we even lost money on an oil deal. Wasn\u2019t funny at the time. \u201cBeing honored by my peers is particularly meaningful to me because I coached in an era that many regard to be one with the highest level of the art. Most are in the Hall of Fame and\/or have been honored similarly by the Coaches that coached in the 1970s and 1980s with a smaller number of teams. You had to go against a veteran, well-prepared team every game. There were no nights off against inexperienced Coaches; you could never expect to outsmart anyone. Players tended to stay on teams longer; divisional teams played one another many more times and that made up for less film availability as players and Coaches knew tendencies and strategized around it. Several great ones have gone on before, but the committee is full of those from that time that remain. Thanks to you all. \u201cThese Coaches helped form the National Basketball Coaches Association. I was at the meeting when we voted to hire the late and great Michael Goldberg. Lenny Wilkens and several other veterans were leaders in this. We didn\u2019t even have Coaches\u2019 retirement benefits at the time. Now the NBCA, through the leadership of David Fogel and Coach Rick Carlisle, does so many great things as a result of those and succeeding Coaches and the lasting impact of Michael.  \u201cI never imagined I could have been put in a position to be thanking you all for this Award. I didn\u2019t work harder than everyone and I wasn\u2019t smarter. But here I am, deeply thankful for the blessings that have been given me.\u201d Harris has been involved in basketball for over 61 years and has coached at every level\u2014jr. high school, high school, small college, major college, NBA D (now G) League, ABA, NBA and over 400 FIBA games including the Olympics and two World Championships. He began his collegiate coaching career in 1965 as Head Coach at Earlham College. In nine seasons he had a 175-70 record and led the Quakers to three conference championships and the 1971 NAIA tournament. It was while he was at Earlham that he made his first foray into international coaching. In 1969, Harris was invited to coach in the Superior League, Puerto Rico\u2019s premier professional league where the majority of Coaches were NBA, ABA or NCAA veterans. He was the first and only Coach in league history to win three championships, and he compiled a 176-71 record in six summer seasons. This success opened the ABA\/NBA door and Harris was hired by Tom Nissalke to be his Assistant Coach with the Utah Stars, and then the Houston Rockets before he was named Head Coach of the Rockets in 1979. Harris was an NBA Head Coach for 14 seasons for the Houston Rockets, Milwaukee Bucks and Los Angeles Lakers, forging a record of 556-457 (.549). In 1981 he led the Rockets to the franchise\u2019s first ever championship series. When he won his 500th NBA game in 1997, he was just the 19th NBA Coach to reach that milestone and his 556 wins currently ranks 29th in NBA history. He was voted NBA Coach of the Year in 1995 in his first year with the Lakers. He was an Assistant Coach for 18 seasons and his teams averaged over 55 wins a year during his last 11 seasons as an assistant. Eight of Harris\u2019 Assistant Coaches went on to become NBA Head Coaches and two others became NBA General Managers. An author of numerous books on basketball which have been translated in five languages, Harris has coached five different national teams in FIBA competition. In 1974 he led Puerto Rico to a Silver Medal in the Copa Americas and the country\u2019s first ever Gold Medal at the CentroBasket Championship (Caribbean and Central America). In 1994 he assisted Ken Shields with the Canadian national team at the World Championships. He was an assistant to Rudy Tomjanovich\u2019s Bronze Medal winning Team USA at the World Championships in Greece in 1998. In 2004 Harris was the first foreign born Head Coach of the Chinese national team, leading their squad to their best ever finish at the Olympic Games. And in 2011 and 2012 he assisted John Calipari with the Dominican Republic\u2019s national team, winning a Bronze Medal at the Copa Americas in 2011 and a Gold Medal at the 2012 CentroBasket Championships. Harris was also the Head Coach of the Milwaukee Bucks for the inaugural McDonald\u2019s Championship in 1987, beating a talent-laden Soviet national team in the championship game. In 2019 Harris was honored by the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame with the John Bunn Lifetime Achievement Award, the most prestigious award presented by the HOF outside of Enshrinement. He is a member of six Halls of Fame, including the NAIA HOF, Indiana Basketball HOF and Earlham College HOF. He has won numerous other awards, including the Naismith Foundation\u2019s James Naismith Legacy Award in 2019, the NABC Lifetime International Award in 2017, the John Wooden \u201cKeys to Life\u201d Award in 2014 and the Jerry Colangelo Award for Leadership from Athletes in Action in 2010.  \u201cDel Harris has been successful at every level of basketball and in every country in which he\u2019s coached,\u201d said David Fogel, National Basketball Coaches Association Executive Director. \u201cHe has done it with a quiet dignity, tremendous respect for the game and admiration of his fellow coaching competitors. This honor is well deserved.\u201d The National Basketball Coaches Association\u2019s Chuck Daly Lifetime Achievement Award honors the memory of Hall of Famer Chuck Daly, who over an outstanding NBA coaching career set a standard for integrity, competitive excellence and tireless promotion of NBA basketball. This year\u2019s Award recognizes the extraordinary contributions Del Harris has made to the sport throughout his NBA career. Through building a body of work that has had a positive and powerful impact on the NBA coaching profession, Harris has embodied the high standards and leadership philosophies that Coach Daly brought to the game. The National Basketball Coaches Association\u2019s Chuck Daly Lifetime Achievement Award recipient is selected annually by the Award Selection Committee, comprised of some of the most respected Coaches and basketball executives in the game, including Bernie Bickerstaff, Billy Cunningham, Joe Dumars, Phil Jackson, Gregg Popovich, Pat Riley, Donnie Walsh and Lenny Wilkens. Prior recipients are Frank Layden (2019), Doug Moe (2018), Al Attles and Hubie Brown (2017), K.C. Jones and Jerry Sloan (2016), Dick Motta (2015), Bernie Bickerstaff (2014), Bill Fitch (2013), Pat Riley (2012), Lenny Wilkens (2011), Tex Winter and Jack Ramsay (2010) and Tommy Heinsohn (2009)."},{"id":25434,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/miami-jimmy-butler-thrive-adversity-finals","date":"2020-10-02","title":"Attuned to adversity, Jimmy Butler and Heat ready to climb uphill challenge in Finals","content":" Behind the unkept mustache and scraggly beard, the sly smile belied all that felt dire in the wake of Miami\u2019s devastating loss to the Los Angeles Lakers in Game 1 of the NBA Finals. Jimmy Butler twisted his left ankle. Goran Dragic ripped the plantar fascia in his left foot. Bam Adebayo winced in agony with a neck strain. Still, Butler smiled pondering the possibility of picking up the pieces against this high-powered Lakers squad, even with Dragic and Adebayo officially listed as doubtful for Friday\u2019s Game 2 (9 ET, ABC) of this best-of-seven series. > Finals Game 2: Heat vs. Lakers, Friday at 9 ET on ABC \u201cYou\u2019re talking about adversity,\u201d Butler said. \u201cFor us, we thrive in that. If you look at it, everybody thought they were going to do that to us anyway. They probably think they\u2019re going to do it to us three more times in a row. I beg to differ. Nobody picked us to be here. We embrace it. We love it. We know that we can win; we do. But we know we\u2019ve got to play perfect, man. So, coming into Game 2, all the adversity, backs against the wall, yadda, yadda, yadda, we\u2019re gonna win.\u201d But how, potentially down two starters, facing a dominant and fully healthy Lakers team that led by as many as 32 points in Game 1, after climbing out of a 13-point hole? That\u2019s the question left to answer for Heat coach Erik Spoelstra, one of the game\u2019s brightest minds, but definitely not some magical healer. The plan is to lean on depth from a bench that outscored the Los Angeles Lakers reserves 49-21 \u2014 largely due to it playing more minutes because of injuries \u2014 and a progression through \u201cPlan A, Plan B, [and] Plan C\u201d as Spoelstra explained, with first-team NBA All-Rookie guard Kendrick Nunn (18 points on 8-for-11 shooting off the bench in Game 1) likely rejoining the starting lineup and veterans Kelly Olynyk and Meyers Leonard (49 starts this season) expected to log more minutes if needed to replace the irreplaceable Adebayo. Olynyk is averaging 5.8 points and 4.2 rebounds in the playoffs. Nunn, meanwhile, started 67 games during the regular season, averaging 15.3 points, before Spoelstra elected to play Dragic more minutes along with Tyler Herro and Jae Crowder in the playoffs. Nunn arrived at the NBA bubble 25 days late after testing positive for COVID-19, and largely fell out of Spoelstra\u2019s postseason rotation. Spoelstra expressed confidence in players such as Nunn and Olynyk taking on larger roles, while pointing out that Duncan Robinson, who took just three shots in Game 1, needs to step up his aggression to provide Miami more of a \u201ccatch-and-shoot element\u201d in Game 2. \u201cIt\u2019s not like they haven\u2019t played this year,\u201d Spoelstra said. \u201cThose guys have both played significant roles for us at different times in the season, and we\u2019ve seen them play extremely well here in a practice setting. I said it last night: it\u2019s more from a human standpoint for K-Nunn to have to go through COVID. That\u2019s something that\u2019s real. You have empathy for him. He\u2019s really worked behind the scenes. We have confidence in him. The other series played out just the way we felt would be best for those series. But he didn\u2019t put his tail between his legs and just feel sorry for himself. That\u2019s not how he got to this point. This guy has great competitive character.\u201d Nunn showed it in his 20 minutes off the bench on Wednesday and explained that his bout with COVID-19 threw off his rhythm upon his return to the bubble. If Dragic can\u2019t play in Game 2, Nunn said he\u2019s ready to reclaim his spot in the starting lineup. \u201cI don\u2019t think I need a speech or anything like that,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m ready to play.\u201d Other little-used Heat players should be, too. Miami utilized the starting lineup of Adebayo, Butler, Nunn, Robinson and Meyers Leonard for 39 of its games during the regular season, but the Heat deployed the lineup it played against the Lakers in Game 1 (Butler, Dragic, Robinson, Crowder and Adebayo) for the majority of the playoffs. That group logged 200 minutes together, generating an offensive rating of 115.6 and a defensive rating of 110.7. Spoelstra admitted the team\u2019s performance in Game 1 was difficult to evaluate because \u201cthat was not our best version\u201d while acknowledging Los Angeles \u201chad something to say about that.\u201d Having faced plenty of series deficits since becoming Miami\u2019s coach in 2008, Spoelstra grinned as widely as Butler and chuckled when asked whether he\u2019s grown to enjoy the adversity of situations such as the one his team currently faces. \u201cThis is when you feel most alive: when you\u2019re being tested competitively and challenged in new ways, different ways,\u201d Spoelstra said. \u201cThis is a quality opponent. This is the way the whole playoff system is supposed to be set up. It\u2019s supposed to get tougher and more challenging every single round, and may the best team win at the end. That\u2019s what we\u2019ll work on today. \u201cWe took it on the chin last night. It counts as one [loss]. But we know we didn\u2019t play well. We didn\u2019t compete at a high enough level. They were the more physical team, and also were just playing their game and imposing their game way more than ours. That\u2019s what makes this matchup interesting. It\u2019s contrasting styles. So, we\u2019ll just work for some better solutions for tomorrow.\u201d The Lakers are doing the same, which is why LeBron James stayed up until nearly 4:30 a.m. after Game 1 studying the film from that outing. James won back-to-back championships with Spoelstra in Miami and expects his former coach will bring plenty of adjustments for Game 2, even if the Heat aren\u2019t at full strength. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be five guys in opposing jerseys on the floor, and they\u2019re all dangerous, no matter who\u2019s in the lineup, no matter what the name is,\u201d James said. \u201cYou have to approach it like they all can beat you as a unit. And as individuals, they\u2019re all on the floor for a reason.\u201d As for Butler, who already said he\u2019ll play Friday on the sore ankle, his message to the team was \u201cjust to stay calm.\u201d After all, Butler and the majority of the Heat \u2014 outside of Spoelstra, Udonis Haslem and Andre Iguodala \u2014 experienced jitters as Game 1 marked all their first experiences in the NBA Finals. \u201cThey say when it\u2019s bad \u2013 when it rains, it pours,\u201d Butler said. \u201cAll in all, we\u2019re still expected to win. We got here for a reason. We realize we belong. But we also realize how well we have to play on both ends of the floor to give ourselves a chance to win. I\u2019ve always said \u2018next man up\u2019 when a man goes down, and right now we\u2019re definitely going to have to do that. But I think it\u2019s tough to lose. Your mind is moving at 1,000 miles per hour, obviously you\u2019re not sleeping. But it\u2019s just because we all care. We all want to win. We all want to be champions.\u201d Michael C.

And he understands how to fight from both sides, both as the favorite or team up in the series and from the opposite end of the series ledger. In this, his 10th appearance in The Finals, he\u2019s comfortable looking back on the lessons learned in each and every trip, especially his first one, when his Cleveland Cavaliers were swept by the San Antonio Spurs in 2007. It provided a blueprint for how it should be done. Seeing Spurs coach Gregg Popovich and his future Hall of Fame trio of Tim Duncan, Manu Ginobili and Tony Parker work like that was a revelation to 22-year-old LeBron James. \u201cWell, I mean, obviously they were the better team,\u201d LeBron said before the Lakers\u2019 Thursday practice. \u201cDealing with Timmy and Manu and Tony and Pop, four Hall of Famers, I knew it would be challenging, not only for myself but for our franchise and for our ball club. I saw the way they approached every game, how they approached every possession. They didn\u2019t make mistakes. They weren\u2019t just happy with being there; they wanted to be great, as a unit and as individuals as well. \u201cI sensed that as a 22-year-old, and I saw that as a 22-year-old. That helped shape me year after year after year after year, just holding on to that feeling of not being able to reach the ultimate goal. But at the same time, like I said, just having that adversity and having those moments has put me in a position where I\u2019ve been throughout my career.\u201d LeBron has always relished the ability to be a student of the game and he has an affinity for the honing of the craft, the obsessing over the minutiae that tends to be a trait of champions and the game\u2019s all-time greats. Each one of his past playoff runs provided the basis of knowledge he\u2019s using to work his way through the most unique run of his career. \u201cLike I mentioned last night, the best teacher is life experience,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve played against great coaches throughout my whole career, not only in the regular season but in the postseason, throughout first, second, third, Finals runs. I\u2019ve played against some exceptional coaches, great coaches, Hall of Fame coaches, Hall of Fame players. They\u2019ve all, opponents and coaches, helped me get to this point where I am today, to a point where I have no weakness, offensively or defensively, to where if I can read a defense, I can exploit it. I can put myself in a position to be successful. It doesn\u2019t mean that the ball goes in all the time, but there\u2019s nothing out on the floor that I cannot do at this point in my career. \u201cThat\u2019s all because of the competition, the adversity, the losses and everything I\u2019ve been through throughout the course of my career. At that point in time I say I\u2019ve got to work on this because that\u2019s what they\u2019re allowing me to have; now I\u2019ve got to work on this because they\u2019re shutting this down in my game.

(AP) \u2014 The jerseys will be hanging in their lockers when the Los Angeles Lakers arrive for Game 2 of the NBA Finals on Friday night. Black jerseys, trimmed in gold, a snakeskin print on the exterior to make it further unique. They are the Black Mamba jerseys. Designed by Kobe Bryant \u2014 and now worn for Kobe Bryant. \u201cWe never want to lose in these jerseys,\u201d Lakers forward Anthony Davis said. Nobody wants to lose in any jersey, of course, but the Lakers would feel like they\u2019re letting Bryant down if they happened to fall short in that uniform. The tribute jersey is just one of many ways that Bryant\u2019s fingerprints are all over these NBA Finals between the Lakers and Miami Heat. It\u2019s the league\u2019s first title series since Bryant, his daughter Gianna and seven others were killed in a helicopter crash on Jan. 26. It\u2019s no secret: This playoff run by the Lakers is with Bryant constantly in mind. \u201cThey\u2019ve got something special that they want to do. You can\u2019t deny that,\u201d Heat center Bam Adebayo said. \u201cIt\u2019s not shocking that he passes away and that becomes their motivation to win the NBA championship and be in the finals. It\u2019s not weird at all. I want to win and do it for Kobe too \u2026 so I understand.\u201d Bryant is the player that Adebayo grew up idolizing. His favorite souvenir from All-Star weekend wasn\u2019t his skills competition championship trophy, but the Bryant jersey that all the players received. His favorite sneakers aren\u2019t just the Kobe 5\u2019s \u2014 but the purple and gold Kobe 5\u2019s, Lakers colors. So, he understands why this Lakers team is motivated to win in Bryant\u2019s memory. \u201cIt still doesn\u2019t feel real to this day,\u201d Adebayo said. \u201cBut you see the effect that he had on the world.\u201d Many of the Lakers wear Bryant\u2019s signature sneakers for games, and assistant coach Jason Kidd often wears them as well. At least four members of the Heat \u2014 Adebayo, Andre Iguodala, Solomon Hill and Jae Crowder \u2014 typically wear Kobe sneakers as well. Bryant won five titles with the Lakers, the last of those coming in 2010. Until now, the Lakers hadn\u2019t been back to the finals since. Now, they\u2019re three wins away from a 17th championship in franchise history, which would tie the Boston Celtics for the most ever. Bryant would have loved that, of course. \u201cIt\u2019s hard not to think about him, whether you\u2019re a part of this organization or not,\u201d Lakers guard Danny Green said. \u201cHe\u2019s always going to impact the game and have a presence, especially for us.\u201d More than eight months have passed since Bryant\u2019s death. The Lakers\u2019 tributes have not faded or slowed down in that time. The Lakers break huddles by yelling \u201cone, two, three, Mamba!\u201d A patch with the initials \u201cKB\u201d adorns some of their jerseys now, a \u201c2\u201d for Gianna Bryant is affixed to some others. A Kobe Bryant credo \u2014 \u201cLeave a Legacy\u201d \u2014 has become the team\u2019s marketing slogan and rallying cry for these playoffs. He helped Nike design the jerseys about three years ago, coming up with the snakeskin-texture idea himself, the obvious nod to his Mamba nickname. The Lakers are 3-0 in those jerseys so far in these playoffs, including a win over Portland on Aug. 24 \u2014 8\/24, the two numbers that Bryant wore in his career with the purple and gold. The score at one point that night was Lakers 24, Blazers 8. \u201cWhen I looked up there and saw 24-8, I was like, \u2018OK, he\u2019s here in the building,\u2019\u201d Lakers forward LeBron James said. The postgame routine in the NBA\u2019s season-restart bubble at Walt Disney World is different than what it was before the pandemic struck. There are no showers at the arena, so players leave the floor, change out of their uniform into usually a T-shirt and shorts, then head back to their hotel to get cleaned up. That is, except on that night in the Mamba jerseys against the Blazers. Davis didn\u2019t want to take his jersey off that night. And when Davis hit a game-winning 3-pointer at the buzzer in Game 2 of the Western Conference finals against Denver, the Lakers just happened to be in the Mamba jersey. \u201cHe\u2019s a guy that especially in this organization we\u2019ll always think of,\u201d Green said. \u201cNot just myself and my teammates, but everybody throughout the league. Any time they step on the floor, they represent the guys that came before us, and he was one of those pioneers that was amazingly great in everything he did on and off the floor.\u201d"},{"id":25427,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/film-study-game-1-lakers-heat-analysis","date":"2020-10-01","title":"Film Study: 5 plays that tell the biggest story of Lakers' Game 1 win","content":" Through the first six and a half minutes of Game 1 of The Finals , the Miami Heat had scored 23 points on just 12 offensive possessions, building a 13-point lead. And then the offense stopped and Game 1 finished as the Heat\u2019s least efficient performance of the postseason (98 points on 97 possessions). The big change after those first 12 possessions was with the Lakers\u2019 bigs. L.A. coach Frank Vogel called timeout, took Dwight Howard off the floor, and moved Anthony Davis to center. The Lakers have generally been better defensively with Davis at center than they have with him at power forward, and that was the case on Wednesday. With Davis and Dwight Howard on the floor together, the Lakers allowed 36 points on 28 Miami possessions ( 1.29 per ). With Davis on the floor without Howard (JaVale McGee did not play), they allowed just 35 points on 49 Miami possessions ( 0.71 per ). 1. No help for the ice  The Heat\u2019s first score came when Goran Dragic rejected a Bam Adebayo screen, beat Howard off the dribble, drew help from Davis, and fed Jae Crowder in the corner . Later in the first, Adebayo set a screen for Jimmy Butler early in the clock. LeBron James \u201ciced\u201d the screen (which means to force the ball-handler toward the sideline) and kept Butler from getting to the middle of the floor. However, Howard was not in position to stop Butler\u2019s drive when he went the other way. Butler was able to get to the baseline and pass back to Adebayo on the roll. 2. Davis on the chase  Crowder doesn\u2019t move and run off screens like Duncan Robinson and Tyler Herro. But he does take some hand-offs and makes Davis chase more when he\u2019s playing the four than when he\u2019s playing the five. His natural inclination to help in the paint allowed Crowder to get open for a 3 early in the third quarter. Crowder was 3-for-5 from 3-point range in 11.4 minutes with Howard on the floor, but had just two attempts in 13.2 minutes with Howard off the floor in Game 1. 3. Quicker from 1-5  There\u2019s an advantage to being bigger, but moving Davis to center allows the Lakers to remain relatively big while adding quickness. Late in the first quarter, Alex Caruso and Kyle Kuzma both went to the ball when Herro set a screen for Dragic and then popped to the left wing. But James quickly rotated off the corner, Davis was in position to protect the rim against Herro\u2019s drive, and then he recovered to block Derrick Jones Jr.\u2019s shot. Midway through the second quarter, James forced a turnover when he helped on another Herro drive and then quickly recovered out to Crowder in the corner. 4. Especially at 5  James has an unprecedented combination of size, speed and instincts on the defensive end of the floor. And with his mix of length and athleticism, Davis is another defensive unicorn, one who can guard two guys at once. Here, he\u2019s able to stay attached to Adebayo while keeping Herro from getting to the basket, which allows Caruso to get back into the play and contest Herro\u2019s shot. 5. Rim protection above everything else  Two possessions later, Davis drops back on another Adebayo hand-off, this one to Dragic. He keeps both guys from getting to the basket and swats Dragic\u2019s shot. Time to start small?  Through the conference finals, the Lakers were slightly better with Davis at power forward (+12.9 points per 100 possessions) than they were with him at center ( +11.7 ). But every series is different. The Heat aren\u2019t quite the Houston Rockets, but with all their player movement and hand-off actions, defending them requires a certain level of quickness at every position. So playing Davis at the five is probably a better solution in this series. That doesn\u2019t mean that Howard or McGee shouldn\u2019t play, but they may be more useful on the offensive end of the floor. And if Kelly Olynyk starts in place of Adebayo (listed as doubtful with a neck strain) in Game 2 on Friday (9 p.m. ET, ABC), starting small to better defend the perimeter may be the move for the Lakers. Dragic (torn plantar fascia in his left foot) is also listed as doubtful , but it was Howard being out of position again that allowed Kendrick Nunn to score his first two of 18 points in the second half Game 1. * * * John Schuhmann is a staff writer for NBA.com.

The Heat announced Thursday that guard Goran Dragic and forward\/center Bam Adebayo are both doubtful for Game 2 of the series ( 9 ET, ABC ). Per the team, Dragic has a torn plantar fascia in his left foot while Adebayo has a neck strain. Adebayo and Dragic departed with injuries and Jimmy Butler played through one in Game 1 of the NBA Finals . A series that started so impressively for the Heat could be a short one if their three best players are out or limited. In a bit of good news, though, Butler said he plans to play through the pain of the left ankle injury he suffered in Game 1 and suit up for Game 2. The Heat were blown out 116-98 by the Los Angeles Lakers  on Wednesday night, but their concerns go far beyond how can they compete. The bigger question might be: Who can? > Finals Game 2: Heat vs. Lakers, Friday 9 ET on ABC Dragic didn\u2019t play in the second half because of a torn left plantar fascia, a person with knowledge of the details told The Associated Press after Game 1. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because no official announcement was made. ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski reported after Game 1 that Dragic was able to put pressure on the foot and had not been ruled out for Game 2. \u201cWe know how much he wants to win, how much he wants to go to war and battle with us,\u201d Butler said. \u201cObviously we love him for that and we want him out there with us. But whatever the doc tells him to do, that\u2019s what he\u2019s got to do.\u201d The Slovenian is a veteran leader for the Heat, who acquired him in 2015, the season after their last NBA Finals appearance. He played as a reserve during the regular season but has been starting in the playoffs, and his six-point finish to Game 1 ended a streak of 33 consecutive postseason games in double figures. \u201cWe\u2019re still expecting to win. We still know that we can,\u201d Butler said. \u201cLike I said earlier, we want that guy out there with us. He\u2019s a big part of what we\u2019re trying to do, but until we can have him back, we got to go out there and we got to fight even harder.\u201d Just before halftime, Butler turned his left ankle on a drive to the basket. He was able to stay on the floor after a timeout for the final seconds, but the injury still appeared to be bothering him in the second half. The star swingman appeared to be hobbling when he landed after scoring while being fouled 13 seconds into the third quarter. He said he felt some soreness after the game but would be OK with treatment. \u201cI\u2019ve got to be ready to go, so we\u2019ll see how it feels tomorrow but I\u2019ll be fine,\u201d he said. Adebayo\u2019s shoulder crashed hard into Dwight Howard as he drove into the lane with 7:03 left in the third quarter. Adebayo, Miami\u2019s All-Defensive team center, is already wearing a sleeve on his left arm and was clearly hurting during the Eastern Conference finals against Boston. The Heat said X-rays taken at the arena were negative. Coach Eric Spoelstra said he wasn\u2019t sure if Adebayo had a lingering injury from the previous series. \u201cI don\u2019t have that answer right now,\u201d Spoelstra said. \u201cWe\u2019ll reevaluate him tomorrow and see where we are.\u201d Adebayo overcame the injury to finish with 32 points and 14 rebounds in the Heat\u2019s victory in Game 6 to eliminate Boston , but he couldn\u2019t keep going Wednesday. He appeared to bang the arm again on a rebound attempt shortly after Howard fouled him and soon left the floor for treatment. In case things weren\u2019t bad enough by then, Butler appeared to be hobbling again after going back into the game in the fourth quarter. Dragic averaged 22.8 points to lead the Heat in their first-round sweep of Indiana in the first round. Butler paced Miami with 23.4 per game when it knocked out top-seeded Milwaukee in the Eastern Conference semifinals and Adebayo scored 21.8 per game in the East finals, making the Heat the first team since the 1999 San Antonio Spurs to reach The Finals with three leading scorers in each of the first three rounds. That trio powered the No. 5 Heat to the finals as the lowest-seeded team since that year, when the Spurs beat the No. 8 New York Knicks. The Heat then jumped on LeBron James and the Lakers with a quick 13-0 run \u2014 all but three points coming from Adebayo, Butler and Dragic \u2014 to open a 23-10 lead. But Los Angeles closed the quarter with a 21-5 finish to take a three-point lead to the second, when things quickly fell apart for Miami. The Heat will try to bounce back Friday in Game 2. They just don\u2019t know yet who can help them try to do it. Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":25474,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/2020-nba-finals-game-1-lakers-heat-analysis","date":"2020-10-01","title":"Lakers look ready to take their championship and go home","content":" Whenever a team is accused of wanting to pack up and go home, it\u2019s because they\u2019ve surrendered and see the challenge as bleak and essentially decided to check out. But this is the NBA restart in Orlando and therefore that feeling has adopted a totally different description, where after three months spent on this Walt Disney World campus the Lakers opened The Finals like they\u2019re ready to close it. They rendered Game 1 rather obsolete by midway through the second quarter, when suspense and the Heat\u2019s confidence left the building, soon to be followed by a limping Goran Dragic , a bummed Bam Adebayo and the bored virtual fans. After that, the only drama was if the Lakers\u2019 blowout would swell as large as the lump on the Heat\u2019s head. All of the suspicions about this potentially lopsided series rang true Wednesday, and as an added bonus for the Lakers, they beat Miami at its own game by making 3-pointers and getting to the line. So the state of the 2020 championship series is suddenly very clear: The Lakers will either wrap up this title rapidly and gas up the jet for the long-awaited return flight to L.A. \u2026 or the Heat will execute the most unlikely rally in Finals history. > Finals Game 2: Heat vs. Lakers, Friday 9 ET on ABC After this first-game kneecapping, which option are you buying? The ease by which the Lakers claimed a far-worse-than-the-score indicated 116-98 victory cannot be dismissed, and speaking of a massive loss, same goes for injuries to Adebayo (shoulder) and especially Dragic (foot). Those two were instrumental in helping the No. 5-seed Heat climb mountains to get here, and now their health for the next game is iffy. It\u2019s all playing right into the Lakers\u2019 hands and fortifying their case for a 17th title. What\u2019s most amazing about their victory was how little it involved LeBron James, who had the quietest and most unneeded near triple-double you\u2019ll ever see. LeBron was one assist shy of that statistical treat. He already holds The Finals record, and he wasn\u2019t pressed because the Lakers, by the fourth quarter, were in full mop-up duty. And if this keeps up, those mops will be exchanged for brooms. \u201cWe have to continue to be aggressive, continue to stay humble and focused on our mission,\u201d said Lakers center Dwight Howard. \u201cEverybody is locked in. We\u2019re locked in on both ends of the floor. We\u2019re locked in in film session and practice. I think we\u2019re super hungry to get this championship.\u201d The Heat flexed some early muscle but only for a minute. They had a 13-point lead in the first quarter, and when the quarter ended, the Lakers were up three. That quick turnaround gave the stunned Heat a case of whiplash from which they never recovered. \u201cThey smacked us in the mouth,\u201d LeBron said. \u201cFrom that point we started playing up to our capabilities.\u201d Look, when Danny Green, who has been mainly dreadful from deep in the playoffs, starts a 3-point barrage by emptying the clip and his teammates follow up, that\u2019s pretty much a wrap for the Lakers. They were barely average from that distance for the post-season, making roughly 11 per game and not being very efficient. Well, they had 11 by halftime against Miami. They already held the clear size advantage over a Miami team that just offers Adebayo \u2014 and he\u2019s not exactly a plus-size center \u2014 and suddenly they\u2019re dropping 3s? That\u2019s why the Lakers led by 32 at one point, were up 26 heading into the fourth, and the rout was hardly in doubt. LeBron went for 25-13-9. Meanwhile, in his first Finals game, Davis was beastly with 34 points, third-most by a Lakers player making their Finals debut. He added nine rebounds, five assists and three blocks, testament to his all-around ability and impact at both rims. Those two are the only superstars in this series, which gives the Lakers a decisive advantage. Green was a plus-21 on the floor and the Lakers\u2019 bench was overwhelming in the second and third quarters. That\u2019s what the Lakers are bringing. Miami? Well, it\u2019s possible that we just saw the Heat at its peak as a team. They might play better from here \u2014 there\u2019s really only one direction to go, actually \u2014 but that means they\u2019ll need to likely overachieve without Dragic, their leading scorer and starting point guard. He had a nasty landing on his left foot; the early word is the injury is plantar-related. No conclusions about his availability were immediately drawn. Given that there\u2019s only one day\u2019s rest between each of the next two games, the skimpy recovery time will work against him. For a player like Dragic, who uses cuts and pivots to attack the rim when he isn\u2019t shooting 3-pointers, this injury could be very limiting even if he plays. \u201cHe\u2019s a big part of what we\u2019re trying to do, but until we can have him back, we got to go out there and we got to fight even harder,\u201d said Heat star Jimmy Butler. \u201cWe got to try to cover up what he gives us and make up for it. We\u2019re capable of it. We have to be capable of it. Moving forward with or without Goran we better hurry up and tie it up 1-1.\u201d Dragic was hell against the Celtics in the East finals and also had solid games in the previous two rounds, averaging just under 21 points in the postseason. While Miami does offer other options, those players have little margin for error. And when they do struggle \u2026 Duncan Robinson didn\u2019t score in 27 minutes Wednesday and Tyler Herro shot poorly, needing 18 attempts to tally 14 points. As for Adebayo, X-rays on his shoulder proved negative. The bigger problem for him is dealing with Davis and also LeBron and trying to stay clear of fouls and save enough energy for the other end of the floor. Adebayo didn\u2019t face a scoring big man in the Boston series. Now, he has a pair to deal with. Davis took 14-of-21 shots in the paint. Clearly, the Lakers\u2019 strategy is to wear down Adebayo and force Miami to send in the replacements, who aren\u2019t nearly as attractive as defenders or interior scorers and are barely mentioned in the scouting reports. Anyway, this was a team collapse by Miami. \u201cWe talk about how damn near perfect that we have to play, and that was nowhere near it,\u201d Butler said. \u201cWe can watch all the film in the world. What we talked about we were going to do, we didn\u2019t do. We didn\u2019t rebound, we didn\u2019t make them miss any shots, we didn\u2019t get back, all of those things led to the deficit that we put ourselves in.\u201d Lakers coach Frank Vogel was being diplomatic when he mentioned Kelly Olynyk and Solomon Hill and Kendrick Nunn, three Miami players who struggle for minutes, as potential threats if they\u2019ll be pressed for extended duty in Game 2. \u201cWe have great respect for these guys,\u201d Vogel said. If Miami must lean somewhat significantly on those three and others to fight their way back into this series \u2026 well, draw your own conclusions. It\u2019s probably best to place more weight on the motivational words of a driven superstar trying to pick up his fourth title with his third team. \u201cI\u2019ve been preparing for this moment for quite a while,\u201d said LeBron, who missed out on the playoffs last year with an injury of his own. The Lakers have now played 27 games in Orlando and been here so long, they might have voting rights in Florida. Visitors to this part of the state are always anxious to arrive, yet after all the exhausting thrills at the theme parks, the desire to leave is almost as strong. The Lakers are no different. They\u2019ve put themselves in position to do the expected in this series, and quickly, against an overmatched opponent. In their minds, with regards to The Finals that are now leaning even heavier in their direction, a grand opening deserves a grand closing. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

I have to admit, I wasn\u2019t sure we\u2019d get here on March 11, when the season shut down due to the coronavirus pandemic. But here we are, four wins away from crowning a champion in the most tumultuous season of my lifetime. The calendar year opened with the somber news of longtime NBA Commissioner David Stern\u2019s passing. After the shocking news on Jan. 26 of the helicopter crash that killed Kobe Bryant, his daughter, Giannia, and seven others, it felt like rock bottom. All-Star weekend in Chicago felt like a giant group hug, seeing all the usual faces in the NBA ecosystem doing their best to celebrate those who were lost as well as the best in the game this season. The season felt rejuvenated after that. But it didn\u2019t last. When Rudy Gobert\u2019s positive test for COVID-19 shut down that game in Oklahoma City, you had to know things would take a dramatic change. But a four-month hiatus and then the social-justice uproar in the wake of George Floyd\u2019s killing in Minneapolis, no one saw that twist coming and we don\u2019t know how many more twists and turns there will be in the future. The season restart wasn\u2019t guaranteed. But the league and the NBPA pulled it together, a collaborative effort that saved the season. There were turbulent times along the way. There was a moment \u2014 when the Milwaukee Bucks didn\u2019t take the floor for a playoff game against the Orlando Magic \u2014 when it seemed like forces beyond the control of anyone here were conspiring to bring an abrupt and crushing end to this season. And yet here we are, on the cusp of perhaps another title for LeBron James or another for the franchise \u2014 the Miami Heat \u2014 that helped him capture his first two. We\u2019re talking about a potentially dream finish to what on multiple occasions felt like a nightmare year for so many. It\u2019s good to be here, no \u2026 it\u2019s great to be here, to chronicle (with 24 Thoughts from each game) the finish to the longest season in NBA history. It\u2019s time to sit back and enjoy the games now, each and every frantic minute as these teams fight for the right to be NBA champions. * * * 24 \u2014  This is a giant step up for Butler, who has been the most confident man in the bubble from the start. Anxious to see if the Heat can rise to the moment with so little experience on their side compared to the Lakers. 23 \u2014  These two \u2026 SMH! 22 \u2014  Tyler Herro out here making those of us who have been around the league for a few years feel absolutely ancient. Ugh! 21 \u2014  Pretty good Game 1 seats for the MDE (Shaquille O\u2019Neal), President Barack Obama and \u201cBig Game James\u201d (Worthy). 20 \u2014  No jitters whatsoever for the \u201cunderdog\u201d Heat early as they open up an early 23-10 lead on the home team. 19 \u2014  Things come at you fast in The Finals. One minute you\u2019re rolling and the next, you\u2019re getting rolled over. 18 \u2014  Playoff Rondo is a real thing! 17 \u2014  Most likely the first of many milestones for him in this series. 16 \u2014  Let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves. Too soon. 15 \u2014  Age ain\u2019t nothing but a number for Herro. Young fella showing up and showing out in his first taste of The Finals. But he\u2019s getting picked on defensively. Lakers have spotted the target. 14 \u2014  Lakers doing just fine without LeBron on the floor. So you know what\u2019s coming when he cranks up. Warning sign for the Heat down 57-47 with just over three minutes to play before halftime. 13 \u2014  The Heat dared the Lakers to beat them from deep in the first half \u2026 and that\u2019s exactly what they did. 12 \u2014  This is how you finish the first half when you flip it from a 13-point deficit early to a 65-48 lead. 11 \u2014  Just the facts! 10 \u2014  The Lakers shooting 13-for-20 from beyond the 3-point line and Goran Dragic out for the rest of the game with a foot injury has a way of shaking up a team, even one as confident as the Heat coming into this game. Lakers up 76-54 and showing no signs of slowing down. 9 \u2014 Its  93-67 Lakers at the end of the third and no Bam (shoulder) or Dragic for the Heat. This could get downright filthy before long if the Heat don\u2019t start knocking down some shots. 8 \u2014  Not the news you want to hear about the player who has led you in scoring in this postseason. Kendrick Nunn, second in the Kia Rookie of the Year race, is on in relief. But this could be a potentially devastating blow for the Heat. 7 \u2014  Pretty much sums up the night for Spoelstra and the Heat. Game 1 got off to that nice 23-10 start and rolled all the way downhill and into a gator-filled ditch down here at Walt Disney World. 6 \u2014  Tough night all around for Herro and the Heat. 5 \u2014  Can\u2019t do a Lakers\u2019 win without some instant analysis from Magic! 4 \u2014  The Lakers\u2019 116-98 Game 1 demolition of the suddenly wounded Heat puts this series in a completely different light as we get ready for Game 2 on Friday. The status of Bam and Dragic will determine how much longer the bubble stays open for basketball business. If the Heat are down two starters \u2026 don\u2019t want to get ahead of the news or anything. But it\u2019s fair to wonder if the Heat\u2019s bubble got busted tonight. 3 \u2014  AD looked super comfortable in his first Finals game, Finals MVP comfortable? 2 \u2014  I wondered how Bam would hold up against the pounding the Lakers would dish out via this future Hall of Famer. Didn\u2019t go too well for Bam. 1 \u2014  Not exactly the news you want to hear Heat fans. * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

But they could have felt a little whiplash after getting outscored 75-30 during a stretch of barely 22 minutes . It began with their own early run, opening a 23-10 lead deep into the first quarter. Then came the Lakers\u2019 19-3 rush to close out that quarter. The second quarter was a mismatch, won by L.A. when it outshot the Heat 63.2% to 36.4%. That was followed by the Lakers\u2019 22-7 start to the second half in slightly less than six minutes. It was 87-55 when the smoke cleared. That swing of 45 points rendered most of what followed irrelevant, except perhaps for Lakers coach Frank Vogel\u2019s film review before Game 2 to fend off any overconfidence in his crew. For Miami, the freefall from that early lead to donesville was like a magician pulling a silk table cloth off a magnificently set table, but sending the china, glassware, centerpiece and good silver flying across the dining room. The Lakers did it with unusual 3-point proficiency. They hit 11 of their first 17 in Game 1 and totaled 15-of-38. That\u2019s their third most 3-pointers made in the postseason and eighth most in all of 2019-20. L.A. had ranked 23rd in takes (31.6) and makes (11.0) during the regular season, 21st in accuracy (.349), so they outdid themselves across the board Wednesday. Miami\u2019s zone, so honed and effective in the East finals against Boston, ran and hid this time. As vexing as it is to spell, plantar fasciitis \u2013 trauma to the thick band of tissue that runs from one\u2019s heel bone toward the toes \u2013 is even worse to play on for an NBA player. That\u2019s what Miami faces with Goran Dragic suffering a reported tear in his left foot in the second quarter. \u201cPlantar fasciitis sucks,\u201d said Joakim Noah, one of the many who have been hobbled by it through the years. \u201cIt feels like you have needles underneath your feet while you\u2019re playing.\u201d Known among trainers as \u201cthe Achilles heel of NBA players,\u201d the injury has afflicted a multitude of players at varying degrees of severity, including Noah, Pau Gasol, Jason Kidd, Joe Johnson, Damian Lillard, Nene, Derrick Favors and Steve Francis. It particularly hampers running, cutting and jumping \u2014 three somewhat useful activities in basketball. It is best treated with orthotics, injections, immobilization and rest, two of which Miami has little time for. So as much as it stunk for the Heat that Bam Adebayo aggravated a shoulder injury and was done after 21 minutes, as much as Jimmy Butler twisting an ankle gouged into his effectiveness from that point, Dragic limping off was the worst. And could settle this Finals almost before it began. Dragic had been the Heat\u2019s leading scorer through the playoffs, averaging 19.9 points per game. His usage rate of 27.2 in 16 postseason games has been higher than in any of his 12 NBA regular seasons (it was 25.7 in his All-Star season of 2017-18, when he averaged 17.3 points). He is a creative, slippery offensive player, initiating trouble for any defense and often bailing out Miami deep into shot clocks. Kendrick Nunn, the All-Rookie first-teamer who logged only 23 minutes in the East finals and none at all in the last three games, scored 18 points mostly in garbage time of Game 1. He is Miami\u2019s best option, barring a miracle recovery by or remarkable treatment of Dragic\u2019s sore foot gets him back to at least 80 percent capability. That\u2019s the reason the Lakers started big, with both Anthony Davis and Dwight Howard in the lineup, only to subsequently go small. Trailing by double digits so early in the game will scuttle plans like that, pronto. That big lineup wasn\u2019t equipped to deal with the Heat\u2019s early 3-point proficiency (welcome back, Jae Crowder) or Miami\u2019s pick-and-roll forays. So no matter how much Vogel wanted to flex his team\u2019s size advantage at the other end, he had to find better matchups. Consider: On a night when Danny Green was plus-21 and the L.A. bench pack of Rajon Rondo, Kyle Kuzma and Alex Caruso all finished with double-digit plus ratings, Howard in his 15 minutes was minus-2. Miami is facing the more acute defensive problem now. It needs Tyler Herro as a scorer and Duncan Robinson as a shooter, but both were treated like raw meat by LeBron James and his teammates. James, as we\u2019ve seen in other playoffs when the pace slows to the half-court, all but points to the mismatch he wants as if he\u2019s at one of the finest steakhouses in the land, making his selection off the server\u2019s tray. The Lakers run a little action to isolate the lonely bone-in ribeye, and nature\u2019s food chain takes over. By the way, when it\u2019s LeBron licking his chops over Herro or Robinson, the physiques of those tender Heat defenders feel like more injuries waiting to happen. Herro was a minus-35 in Game 1. And even though Robinson was a good-enough-to-lose minus-8, he didn\u2019t make a shot, missing the mere three 3-pointers he launched in 27 minutes. What about Andre Iguodala? Certainly Iguodala has the resume defensively and great experience against James. But the difference between James\u2019 35 years on the planet and Iggy\u2019s 36 turned into 35 Wednesday, the gap between the Lakers\u2019 star\u2019s plus-10 and the Miami vet\u2019s minus-25. If he continues to play the way he did in Game 1 (34 points, nine rebounds, five assists and three blocked shots in 38 minutes). If that keeps him about five points and three boards, on average, ahead of James in the stats when this is over, while staying within an assist or two. And if James keeps talking up his younger teammate the way he did after this one (\u201cHe was, once again, a force in every facet the game\u201d). Otherwise, that award remains James\u2019 to lose. His results were sufficiently impressive \u2013 25 points, 13 rebounds, nine assists, a couple 3-pointers and a handful of highlights \u2013 to keep him as both the sentimental (he\u2019s old) and still-formidable favorite. Let\u2019s see how much the Heat and the media talk about Miami\u2019s vaunted culture when they\u2019ve got as many as three starters in the trainer\u2019s room in the hours between Games 1 and 2. One thing culture is not is a bunch of backups going against the LeBron James and the Anthony Davis, trying to win four out of six now. There will be no sympathy from James, at least not until it\u2019s over. Back in 2015, he had to play a Finals without Cleveland\u2019s Nos. 2 and 3, Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love. Against Golden State. Soldiering on with the likes of Tristan Thompson, Matthew Dellavedova and Timofey Mozgov. So in addition to plugging the leaks of his defense, Heat coach Erik Spoelstra has to be prepared to try that with replacement parts. Remember, thanks to the bubble format \u2014 and the fact we\u2019re watching Finals games in October \u2014 there are no extended breaks in this series, no travel days folded in. The only gap of one additional day comes between Game 4 Tuesday and Game 5 next Friday. Do the math. That might be too late. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

After trailing by 13 points early in Game 1 of The Finals , they outscored the Miami Heat 75-30 over the next 22 minutes of basketball, eventually cruising to a a 116-98 victory on Wednesday. The Heat have more to worry about than the loss. In the process, they lost both Goran Dragic (left foot) and Bam Adebayo (left shoulder) to injuries. Jimmy Butler also turned his left ankle twice. And if any of those three guys is unavailable going forward, the task of winning four of the next six games (against a team that\u2019s won 13 of its last 15) becomes much tougher. One stat stood out from the rest as the Lakers took a 1-0 series lead. 25-11 \u2014 Made free-throw differential in Game 1. Entering The Finals, the Heat ranked second in postseason free throw rate (33.2 attempts per 100 shots from the field) and had outscored their opponents by 3.9 points per game (the third best differential) from the free throw line. The Lakers ranked third in free throw rate (30.9 attempts per 100 FGA), but 15th in opponent rate (31.7), and had been outscored by 1.5 points per game at the line. The Lakers starting Dwight Howard, the postseason leader in fouls per 36 minutes , increased the chances of the Heat being able to get to the line, and Howard did commit three fouls in just 14:55. But Miami\u2019s 14 free-throw attempts were tied for their fewest in the postseason . Adebayo matched his postseason average (six attempts) in just 21 minutes and Butler drew a game-high seven fouls . But his five free-throw attempts were four fewer than his postseason average and the Heat had just three attempts beyond those two. Meanwhile, the Lakers were 25-for-27 themselves from the line. Anthony Davis drew six fouls and was 10-for-10. And it was LeBron James who took Adebayo into the paint late in the first quarter to draw the second straight foul on the Heat center, a critical play in the Lakers\u2019 comeback from that early deficit. The Lakers\u2019 3-point shooting (11-for-15) was the story of that extended, 75-30 run . But that\u2019s obviously not sustainable and Miami\u2019s bigger concern could be inside the arc. If the Heat can\u2019t outscore the Lakers at the line, they\u2019re in trouble. Butler and Adebayo are their main source of free throws, but losing Dragic\u2019s 14 drives per game ( 10th in the postseason through the conference finals) would hurt their ability to put pressure on the Lakers\u2019 defense and get to the stripe.

Sticking with campus culture, then, it\u2019s fair to say that even with its Finals just beginning Thursday, the league already has aced most of its exams in bringing back basketball in a pandemic. Not that anyone wants to come back for sophomore year. \u201cI\u2019m most proud that we collectively came together as a community and pulled this off,\u201d said commissioner Adam Silver, before Game 1 of The Finals between the Miami Heat and the Los Angeles Lakers. \u201cBy that I mean all of the stakeholders. The players, the team governors, 30 teams \u2014 not just 22 teams \u2014 [and] the support we received from our fans.\u201d Silver added: \u201cEspecially, frankly given all the division in our country right now, the fact that people could set their minds to something, come together, make enormous sacrifices, compromise.\u201d This was not a victory lap \u2014 not yet, not with two teams and another week or two to go. But it was a moment of appreciation and gratitude, with some pride folded in. \u201cThe pride of the sense that we\u2019ve accomplished this against many obstacles,\u201d Siver said, \u201cand at a time also when I think people needed to see this.\u201d Silver met with reporters Thursday evening, an annual tradition at the start of his league\u2019s championship series. But the media reps were both nearby and remote, a limited number in the room and many more scattered across the country and around the globe, checking in via Zoom. And of course, when the commissioner finished, he carefully donned a mask before stepping from the podium. That\u2019s the new yet odd NBA normal, life as the league has come to live it. The Heat and the Lakers will blow by the three-month mark this week for time spent in the bubble. Their mental and physical endurance, their focus, their sense of purpose has been topped only by the time, effort, manpower, expense and defiance of a determined and dangerous virus that the NBA has logged. With the help of literally thousands. Silver pegged the number at 6,500 who made the bubble possible, from the players, coaches and staffs to so many support workers from the Orlando community assisting at the arenas and the hotels. \u201cI analogize it a bit to when you go to a movie and you see the actors on the screen and then the credits start rolling at the end, and they keep rolling and they keep rolling,\u201d Silver said. \u201cThat\u2019s the 6,500 people. \u201cAnd it\u2019s the essential workers, the people who do our testing every day, take our temperatures, clean our rooms, maintain these facilities. It\u2019s the bus drivers. \u2026 It\u2019s everyone who\u2019s been involved down here. A huge \u2018thank you\u2019 to the people of Orange County, Florida, who have taken such good care of us over our time here.\u201d So now that they\u2019ve gotten pretty good at it, there\u2019s zero chance any of them wants to repeat it for the 2020-21 season. Which is entirely beside the point. The NBA and everyone involved with it might have no choice but to yield and react all over again to COVID-19. Already, the \u201c2020\u201d signage on next season can be removed, with whatever schedule gets played likely to fit entirely in 2021. A January start seems to be the earliest fans again will see games that matter. With a bunch of unknowns from there. Teams in their cities? Fans in the arenas? Multiple bubbles rather than one? Eighty-two games or maybe fewer? Legit questions all, in search of answers. \u201cNothing has really changed in this virus, as far as I know,\u201d Silver said. \u201cIn fact, I think the majority of states right now, cases are ticking back up again. There\u2019s predictions of a combination of flu and coronavirus season, what that will mean. People are moving back indoors. In some cases, people have COVID fatigue and aren\u2019t following the same protocols. \u201cSo in many ways we\u2019re looking at a lot of the same factors we looked at determining what to do this season.\u201d Wait, there\u2019s more: Any changes in terms of the collective bargaining agreement between the teams and the players would require negotiations, at a point when the patience of so many principals has worn thin. Sequestering on the Disney campus one time for one, two or three months is one thing; signing up for another full season would be quite another.  Gaining access to better, quicker testing could help contain the virus\u2019 spread by identifying carriers immediately. It also would allow for attendance at arenas, not 19,000 strong necessarily but several thousand spectators, properly distanced. \u201cBased on everything I\u2019ve read, there\u2019s almost no chance that there will be a vaccine, at least that is widely distributed before we start the next season,\u201d Silver said. \u201cSo I do not see the development of a vaccine as a prerequisite.\u201d As for the league\u2019s internal business \u2013 particularly establishing the salary cap and luxury tax threshold for next season \u2013 operations have been gummed up by so many variables. The NBA still was calculating the financial hit from splintered relations with China \u2013 estimated as a $200 million loss or more this year, after the political controversy of last fall \u2013 when the virus shutdown began. Silver has estimated the portion of revenue derived from fan attendance at games at approximately 40 percent, worth hundreds of millions more. The Draft, rescheduled from June, has been pegged for now to Nov. 18. But there is no date yet for the start of free agency, and without cap and tax numbers, the roster-building work of salary structures and possible transactions can\u2019t get done. The best-case scenario might be that the league works a second season with the 2019-20 limits \u2014 $109.14 million for the cap, $132.6 million to enter the luxury tax. That would kick the can of a financial reckoning down the road for a year or longer, hopeful that some glimmer of the old normal NBA might see a rebound in revenues. Coming together to confront big problems isn\u2019t going to end anytime soon, then, no matter how soon this bubble pops. ALSO OF NOTE \u2022 The NBA\u2019s deep dive into social and racial issues was a component of what made the bubble successful, Silver said. \u201cTo me, certainly it began with what\u2019s important to our players is important to us. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t just our players. The players know and the NBA community knows there\u2019s a long history in this league of fighting for social justice, for racial equality.\u201d \u2022 Silver understood the view of many fans, weary of nonstop big issues in a virus-riddled election year, \u201cwho look to sports as a respite.\u201d \u201cMy response is that, again, I\u2019m listening,\u201d he said. \u201cBut these are unique times. \u2026 I still firmly believe it was and is the right thing to do.\u201d \u2022 The league\u2019s weekly release of coronavirus test results stopped when the cases did, Silver said. There was no news, so no reports. That, in fact, might be the biggest takeaway of the Orlando bubble, even after the 2020 NBA champion is crowned. The worst-case scenario of a seriously ill player, coach or staff member simply never happened. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

So there are many questions to be answered when Game 1 of The Finals tips off at 9 p.m. ET on Wednesday (ABC). One of those questions is in regard to the Heat\u2019s 2-3 zone defense. After using it for 157 possessions (27% of all defensive possessions) in the conference finals, how much of it will they play against the Lakers? The Heat themselves probably don\u2019t know the answer just yet. The Lakers are a very different team than the Boston Celtics, and the Heat actually went through two series (against Indiana and Milwaukee) without playing any zone at all. But there\u2019s one big reason why zone would make a lot of sense against this particular opponent \u2026 The Heat played eight possessions of 2-3 zone in the first quarter of Game 6 against Boston, and the Celtics made five 3-pointers on those eight possessions. That, along with Boston having had its best game against the zone (14 points on nine possessions) in Game 5, might have been reason to go away from it. But the Heat stuck with the zone and used it for almost all of the 37-27 fourth quarter that put them in The Finals. The Celtics certainly got more comfortable against the zone as the series went on, and they got a lot of open 3s (many from the corners) against it. But overall, they scored 1.11 points per possession against the zone and 1.15 otherwise. As we look forward to Lakers-Heat, the point-per-possession numbers may not be the most important. Against the zone, the Celtics took more than half of their shots (73\/145) from 3-point range and attempted just 13 free throws per 100 shots from the field. Otherwise, they took only 39% of their shots from 3-point range and attempted 33 free throws per 100 shots from the field. So the zone forced more jump shots and allowed fewer free throws. That\u2019s an even more important formula against the Lakers, the team that, in the regular season, had the biggest differential between its field goal percentage in the paint (60.9%, first) and its effective field goal percentage on shots from outside the paint (47.7%, 26th). That outside-the-paint number has been higher (50.4%) in the playoffs, but protecting the basket remains priority No. 1 against the Lakers. In the postseason, the Lakers have scored 1.06 points per attempt from 3-point range (1.20 on corner 3s), but 1.42 per attempt in the restricted area and 1.49 per (2-shot) trip to the line. And the zone may be the best way to prevent the latter two. When the Heat play man-to-man, Bam Adebayo switches almost every ball screen. That allows him to neutralize the man with the ball (he\u2019s allowed just 0.58 points per possession on isolations), but it also takes him away from the rim . In Games 3 and 5, the Heat played 25 total possessions of zone, and the Celtics scored 133 total points in the restricted area or on free throws. In Games 4 and 6, the Heat played 89 total possessions of zone and the Celtics scored 91 total points in the restricted area or on free throws. As noted, forcing jumpers is more important against the Lakers than it is against the Celtics, who had the sixth smallest differential between their field goal percentage in the paint (54.6%, 22nd) and their effective field goal percentage on shots from outside the paint (51.6%, ninth) in the regular season. So don\u2019t be surprised if we see zone early and often in The Finals. If we see the zone, here are some ways that the Lakers might attack it \u2026 1. Inside screen and go from there The Celtics attacked the zone the same way for much of Games 5 and 6. They had their big man set a ball-screen on the inside of one of the top defenders. If that screen is solid and the other top defender doesn\u2019t slide over to the nail (the middle of the foul line), the ball-handler is able to get into the paint \u2026 If the other top defender does slide over, the ball-handler can pass to the opposite side of the floor, where a huge seam has been created\u2026 And if the defender on the weak-side baseline steps up to close off that seam, a shooter is wide open in the corner. LeBron James is the Lakers\u2019 primary ball-handler (especially in the starting lineup), but would obviously be the best guy to attack the seam from the wing, as he did in the first regular-season meeting when the Lakers set an inside screen up top \u2026 So the inside-screen action may work best with Rajon Rondo or Alex Caruso in the game and with Danny Green ( 18-for-43 on corner 3s in the playoffs ) or Kentavious Caldwell-Pope (18-for-38) in the corner. 2. Outside screen and attack If one of the ball-handling guards isn\u2019t on the floor, the Lakers can set a screen for James on the outside of the zone, allowing him to attack those seams on the side of the zone directly. A shooter in the strong-side corner gives the baseline defender a difficult decision to make. 3. Davis in the middle That inside-screen play above (where James drew a flagrant foul on Meyers Leonard) was one of 27 possessions of zone that the Heat played in the November meeting between these two teams (they played just eight possessions of zone in the December game). But it was one of only a few times where the Lakers used that inside-screen action. Most of the time, they had somebody (usually Anthony Davis) flash into the middle of the zone. More often than not, he got a shot for himself ( a layup and a short jumper are two examples). But if the Lakers are playing big and Adebayo steps up to guard Davis in the middle of the zone, he can find either JaVale McGee or Dwight Howard on the baseline, which he did a couple of times in November \u2026 With the lineups the Heat have been using in the playoffs, they\u2019re relatively small at those two baseline positions in the zone. So McGee and Howard can score above guys like Tyler Herro and Duncan Robinson. And if the baseline guys manage to take away the high-low option, Davis can kick out to open shooters . 4. Post and cut Enes Kanter was the only guy that the Celtics posted up against the zone, but the Lakers have both Davis ( third in the postseason with 8.0 post-ups per game ) and James (12th with 3.1). Getting the ball into the post against the zone is tougher than it is against man-to-man, but it can open some things up by turning the defense around. McGee actually got a post-up in that November game. Jimmy Butler turned his head and Caldwell-Pope cut behind him for a layup\u2026 You can get into the teeth of the zone via the dribble or the pass. James could be the toughest guy in the league to stop off the dribble, while Davis is arguably the league\u2019s best interior target. But getting into the paint isn\u2019t the same as getting all the way to the basket. And if the Heat can mostly force short jumpers from Davis or James or catch-and-shoot 3s from the Lakers\u2019 guards, that\u2019s a lot better than a heavier diet of layups and dunks. The Lakers have options in regard to bending the zone. Breaking it is easier said than done. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

The Cavaliers were in no position to beat the dynastic Spurs, not with Boobie Gibson, Larry Hughes, Drew Gooden and Zydrunas Ilgauskas as the main pieces next to LeBron . Tim Duncan and Tony Parker and Gregg Popovich didn\u2019t lose much sleep in a series that lasted slightly longer than lunch. He is now 35 and once again back at the dance, for a 10th time , a staggering amount by any measure, especially considering nine of those trips have come in the last decade. That alone puts him beyond the reach of most athletic immortals in any professional team sport and certainly more than many of us will ever see in our lifetimes. As the NBA Finals begin with him on the floor at tipoff, the only unusual aspect of this familiar scenario is the series taking place in October instead of June. These trips aren\u2019t getting old for him, and from a performance standpoint, he doesn\u2019t seem to be getting old, either. LeBron made first-team All-NBA with the Lakers and was runner-up for Kia MVP this season, his 17th in the league. He led the NBA in assists in his first full-time role as ball distributor. Some of the greats in this game were relegated to supporting duty and just hanging on a roster, mainly for the money, at this stage of their careers. They were nothing more than hood ornaments, reminders of what they used to be. LeBron, much like Michael Jordan (scoring championship and an NBA title at the same age), remains the outlier as the centerpiece of his team, with all due respect to Anthony Davis. \u201cHe\u2019s seen everything,\u201d said Erik Spoelstra, who coached LeBron with the Heat. \u201cAt this point in his career, it\u2019s just about winning. And his ability to do what he does at his age is incredibly uncommon.\u201d We can discuss and analyze what it will all mean if he wins his fourth championship on his third team. That\u2019s for another day, sometime in the next week if he and the Lakers beat Miami. For now, it\u2019s all about reaching this point, a milestone in itself. \u201cTo be back in the Finals against Miami I think means a lot more to him winning this than anyone else,\u201d Davis said. \u201cI think this championship is probably second behind Cleveland, being able to get this one for him. It\u2019s been fun to watch him. He goes to The Finals every year. Win or lose, he always comes back the next year. And to finally get back after last year and go against his former team, I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s going to have a competitive series.\u201d Former Yankees star Derek Jeter, who knows something about playing for multiple championships, once said that the title is never guaranteed once you get there; but you must keep giving yourself those chances. He\u2019s right, and that\u2019s sometimes lost when taking into account the six times LeBron came up short in The Finals. The more swings you get, the better the odds of connecting. LeBron agrees and says: \u201cDo you always become successful at it? Are you always going to win? No, it doesn\u2019t happen like that. But you\u2019re able to sleep a little bit better at night when you know you\u2019ve punched the clock.\u201d LeBron has carried lesser teams to The Finals and more talented teams. None of his teams in Cleveland were favored to win. The 2007 series with the Spurs was projected as a blowout (and didn\u2019t disappoint). In his four cracks at the Warriors, only one of them successful, and his lone formidable teammate was Kyrie Irving, who was injured early in one of those Finals and sat out. Only with Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade in Miami did LeBron bring ample firepower before this season, where Davis and a decent collection of veteran role players will give the Lakers the significant upper-hand over the superstar-lacking Heat. \u201cI never had a problem with any team I went to The Finals (with),\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve always been confident that we had the ability to win. If you\u2019re going to a Finals saying you\u2019re undermanned or you feel like you don\u2019t have enough, then who are you? The game is won between the four lines, not won on paper. At the end of the day, when I\u2019ve lost in The Finals, the better team won because they played well, they were more prepared and they did what they needed to do to win those four games. \u201cWhen I\u2019ve won, the same thing. I\u2019m not here to talk about the talent we all have, the team that we have. The game is won in between the four lines, 94 feet. The team that is prepared and the team that executes, the team that is not careless throughout 48 minutes will give themselves a chance to win each and every game. I\u2019m confident going into this Finals, as I\u2019ve always been in my career.\u201d LeBron continues to defy basketball logic in multiple ways in his mid-30s. He\u2019s 6-foot-8 and roughly 250 pounds but moves fluidly and has full ownership of a spin-move in the paint that flummoxes the defense no matter how often he executes it. His 3-point shooting has never been better and, similar to how Jordan developed a baseline turnaround jumper, is aiding LeBron here in the latter stages of his career. His defense was lackluster last season, yet has improved. And his court-sense and ability to find teammates with bounce and bullet passes remains sharper than ever. He makes a wide imprint on almost every game he plays, if not with passing, then leadership, scoring, rebounding and playmaking, particularly in the moment of truth, when a close game begs for a turning point. The run on Finals appearances for LeBron can\u2019t be taken for granted, because the end is probably near. Next season he\u2019ll be 36 and while his body has rarely betrayed him, he is human and there\u2019s lots of mileage on his limbs. Likewise, Davis has a rich history of injury issues and, despite his great health now, that\u2019s always a question with him until it isn\u2019t. Here\u2019s the larger and more sobering issue, though: The competition starting next season will be fierce. Every contender this season should remain just as good if not better next season. That includes the Clippers, Nuggets, Jazz, Bucks, Heat and Celtics, and beware of spoilers such as the Mavericks, Raptors, Blazers and Pelicans. Meanwhile, there are potential monsters forming in Brooklyn and San Francisco, where healthy superstars await anxiously. If LeBron isn\u2019t aware of his own mortality and the multiple threats that\u2019ll assume the championship chase next season, or cares not to subscribe to it, he\u2019ll find out soon enough. Time has a way of bringing even the greats to their knees, begging for mercy. You can eat right and live right and lift all the weights and run all the hills, but gravity is never starstruck; it spares no one and offers no compassion. All you can do is cheat the process as long as possible. * @KingJames : \"I\u2019m here for one reason and one reason only, and that\u2019s to compete for a championship.\" \u2014 Mike Trudell (@LakersReporter) September 29, 2020 Right now, LeBron is winning that game and pushing those limits. Whether he can win four more games in this NBA restart and extend the boundaries of his legacy remains to be seen. At least he has given himself that chance. That, in itself, must be respected and saluted. \u201cTo see what LeBron has done, when he moved on to Cleveland and then to here, it really is just a testament to his greatness and his commitment to winning,\u201d Spoelstra said. \u201cTo be able to do it with different rosters and uniforms is really remarkable.\u201d * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

TMZ Sports first reported the news of Cuban picking up West, who played for the Mavs in the 2011-12 season. West disclosed in 2009 that he has bipolar disorder and has struggled with off-the-court issues for years. Cuban confirmed to ESPN\u2019s Tim MacMahon that he is attempting to help West get his life back on track. Per The Athletic\u2019s Shams Charania, Cuban reunited West with his mother, Delphina Addison, in Dallas on Monday and West has now checked into a rehab center in Florida. Cuban had asked Addison how he could help and she said she simply needed someone to find West. Cuban waited with West in a hotel until Addison arrived at a hotel and then West entered rehab, Charania reports. Friends and family of West, reports TMZ Sports, have been trying to get West to go to a drug rehabilitation facility and Cuban has offered to pay for treatment. In two videos that went viral in January, West was shown being hit by another man in a street near Washington D.C. In the other , a shirtless, handcuffed West was being asked about the attack. Several former teammates and coaches \u2014 as well as Cuban \u2014 have expressed concern for West. Cuban reportedly made an attempt recently to help West after photos of him panhandling in the Dallas area circulated online last week. West was the No. 24 overall pick of the 2005 draft by the Boston Celtics and played eight seasons in the NBA, averaging 9.7 points, 2.9 rebounds, 3.6 assists and 1.1 steals per game. His last NBA season was in 2011-12 with Dallas, when he averaged 9.6 ppg, 2.3 rpg, 3.2 apg and 1.3 spg in 44 games. He was eventually waived by the Mavs that season for conduct detrimental to the team. After his playing days in the NBA ended, West played for the Mavericks\u2019 NBA G League franchise, the Texas Legends. He logged two separate stints with the Legends, playing in eight games in 2012-13 (averaging 10.3 ppg, 3.8 rpg, 4.4 apg and 2.3 spg) and four games in 2014-15 (14.8 ppg, 4.8 rpg, 3.8 apg, 2.3 spg). He was also a part of the LA Clippers\u2019 Summer League team in 2014 , but was waived shortly after that ended.

The Los Angeles Lakers, chasing championship banner No. 17 and heavily favored in most circles outside of South Florida, don\u2019t mind the blue-blood distinction. And no one relishes the long-shot tag more than the Miami Heat, given their roster loaded with underrated players who have scrapped and clawed their way up the ranks in this bizarre, pandemic-influenced season. The Lakers celebrated their first trip to The Finals since 2010 with a clear message: There \u2019 s more business to be done. The Heat disseminated a similar refrain to their group after clinching their first trip here since 2014: We\u2019re not done yet. But only one of them will leave with the title in what would be an exclamation point to a 2019-20 season filled with moments and obstacles no one could foresee. The No. 5-seed Heat vanquished three higher seeds \u2014 No. 4 Indiana in the first round, No. 1 Milwaukee in the conference semifinals and No. 3 Boston in the conference finals \u2014 to get here. And they come with a warning label. \u201cThey\u2019re super physical, super tough, very, very savvy,\u201d Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. \u201cI think they\u2019re the best team in the East and deserve to be representing the East in the way that they have played.\u201d An upset of the top-seed from the Western Conference is the logical next step. And with no home court advantage to lean on \u2026 anything is possible! ( In the Kevin Garnett voice \u2026) Here are four keys to the Heat springing that upset: * * * Heat coach Erik Spoelstra perfectly deployed a 2-3 zone defense against Boston. The wrinkle worked wonders in their Game 2 win and the threat of it the remainder of the series was invaluable. It\u2019s no gimmick. Spoelstra had no choice but to add the zone to their defensive playbook so All-Star center Bam Adebayo would stay out of harm\u2019s way. The zone lets him set the Heat\u2019s defensive parameters while also protecting the paint.  The bubble environment has allowed for a different sort of scouting experience, with every team getting a real-time look at the in-game adjustments in the same location. The element of surprise, then, won\u2019t be on the Heat\u2019s side. \u201cWe feel good about attacking whatever defense they throw out there,\u201d Lakers coach Frank Vogel said. \u201cWe\u2019re familiar with the different looks they like to show and we have a plan on how to attach each of them. At that point it\u2019s just about trusting your guys and making sure we\u2019re in the right spots. And attack the way the game plan suggests.\u201d The Celtics had the same plan. They couldn\u2019t beat the Heat consistently attacking or trying to shoot them out of their zone. And they were a significantly better 3-point shooting team than the Lakers (35.5% on 3-pointers in the playoffs). Adebayo\u2019s rim protection is compromised when the Heat are switching all over the place, as Boston exploited at times during the conference finals. Spoelstra countered by mixing in some zone stretches that worked to perfection. Kawhi Leonard (2014) and Andre Iguodala (2015) won Finals MVPs based largely on their ability to limit the effectiveness of LeBron James. But it wasn\u2019t a one-man job then and it isn\u2019t now. The Heat have an assortment of bodies to throw at LeBron, a challenge Spoelstra understands as well or better than any NBA coach after serving as James\u2019 coach during his four seasons with the Heat (2010-14). That said, Iguodala\u2019s work on James during their first Finals matchup is a masterclass on how to agitate, frustrate and contain a force like James. \u201cHe\u2019s a historically good perimeter defender, that\u2019s why he\u2019s going to go to the Hall of Fame,\u201d Vogel said of Iguodala. \u201cHe\u2019s got great length, great hands, great feet \u2026 toughness. He\u2019s just one of those types of defenders. There\u2019s a reason these guys are in the NBA Finals, because they have a lot of defensive firepower. And Andre fits in that bucket.\u201d Jimmy Butler and Jae Crowder have also had to match up with LeBron in recent playoffs, giving Spoelstra all sorts of options. Butler will no doubt get his fair share of time guarding LeBron and respects the challenge. \u201cThe main key, and it\u2019s been like this for a very long time, if you want to win, you\u2019re going to have to go through a LeBron James-led team,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the end of the day, that\u2019s what it normally comes down to. \u2026 Obviously you can\u2019t focus in on [just] him because he has so many really good players around him, but you\u2019re going to get the same test over and over again until you pass. And that test is LeBron James.\u201d Celtics point guard Kemba Walker said it best after Adebayo destroyed the Celtics in Game 6: \u201cBam\u2019s a star. And he played like it.\u201d For Spoelstra to turn Adebayo loose on the Lakers the way he did against the Celtics, someone will have to protect the heart and soul of this Heat team from bruisers like Dwight Howard, JaVale McGee and Markieff Morris. They are a significant step up in competition from Boston\u2019s Daniel Theis and Enes Kanter. \u201cYeah, he\u2019s earned it,\u201d Spoelstra said. \u201cThat\u2019s what all the great players have to go through, different schemes, different matchups, game plans against you. They know how important he is, and like I said before, he\u2019s an elite competitor, and he\u2019s as impactful as anyone in this association.\u201d Vogel agreed. \u201cHe \u2019 s is not becoming (a star). He \u2019 s already there. He \u2019 s terrific,\u201d Vogel said. \u201cHe really fits the modern NBA, in terms of playing the center position, with all that he can do. \u2026 He can really do it all, protects the rim, defensively. He can switch out and does a lot of things, and is a huge reason for their success this year.\u201d We could end up seeing Bam and Anthony Davis matched up as small-ball centers in this series (if both coaches decide to go that way). The underdog routine has worked fine to this point. But the Heat need the trio of Goran Dragic, Tyler Herro and Duncan Robinson to elevate their game to meet the magnitude of the moment. Dragic, not Butler or Adebayo, leads the Heat in playoff scoring (20.9 ppg). We\u2019ve already seen what Herro can do when his confidence is soaring and he starts cooking from deep (see his nuclear Game 4 effort vs. Boston). \u201cI think I came into the league more as like a catch-and-shoot guy and that\u2019s what I\u2019m labeled as, but as you can see, I can put the ball on the floor,\u201d Herro said. \u201cI can make plays for others. I can get my own shot off the dribble, and that\u2019s what I did my whole life before Kentucky and before the NBA. I grew up with the ball in my hands and making plays and making tough shots. I feel like that\u2019s my game.\u201d And Robinson, who is shooting 40% on 3-pointers, is due for one of those lights-out performances great shooters tend to have at least once in a series. There\u2019s a reason the Lakers aren\u2019t buying this underdog narrative. The Heat\u2019s profile outside of the bubble is one thing. Their reality is something different inside this diorama. \u201cThey have three All-Star players in Butler, Bam and, I \u2019 ve always felt that when healthy, Goran Dragic is an All-Star-level player,\u201d Vogel said. \u201cThey have shooting. They have toughness. And like I said, they are extremely well-coached. So it\u2019s no surprise they \u2019 ve had such a successful postseason run.\u201d Butler and the Heat have backed up his business trip talk and believe they will emerge on top in one of the most tumultuous seasons in NBA history. He reflected on as much a year to the day since his introductory news conference to announce that he was \u201ccoming home\u201d to Miami. \u201cA lot of ups and downs. Obviously, everything that\u2019s happened in 2020,\u201d he said. \u201cBut from a basketball standpoint, [it] couldn\u2019t be better. You talk about where we are right now going into The Finals, that\u2019s what I want. We talked about it and put that out there in the world, and I think all that positive energy we put out, it came back to us. We believed when not too many did, but that\u2019s okay. We\u2019re going to keep believing and get these next four.\u201d * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

Goosebumps kicked in at the thought. What was once a 22-team bubble at Walt Disney World is down to the final two, with Adebayo and the Miami Heat set to take on LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers in the NBA Finals that start on Wednesday night. It\u2019s the first finals matchup between the clubs, with the Lakers looking for a record-tying 17th title and the Heat seeking their fourth in the last 15 seasons. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty cool considering, when you really think about it, it\u2019s you and one other team that are still left standing and one of the two will be raising the Larry O\u2019Brien Trophy,\u201d Adebayo said Monday. \u201cBut we know that the job isn\u2019t done yet.\u201d The Heat were spending much of Monday resting up before an evening team meeting would officially start their finals preparation process. The Lakers, who won the Western Conference finals on Saturday \u2014 a day before Miami finished off the Eastern Conference crown \u2014 were starting to get their game plan in order after a one-day break as well. Much like the Heat, the Lakers took a moment to enjoy winning the conference title. Winning a day ahead of Miami just happens to give the Lakers a bit more time to prepare for Game 1. \u201cWe appropriately had fun with it that night, enjoyed it that night. And then the next day, it\u2019s time to move on to the next \u2026 and now it\u2019s all business,\u201d Lakers coach Frank Vogel said Monday. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any kind of an eye towards the end of getting home or anything like that. It\u2019s really about staying single-minded in our focus about what needs to happen for us to beat the Miami Heat.\u201d Both teams are scheduled for regular practices Tuesday. It\u2019s definitely a tight squeeze, preparation wise, compared to last year: the 2019 NBA Finals started on May 30, with Golden State clinching its spot in the title series on May 20 and Toronto on May 25. \u201cI tell you, it\u2019s going to be brutalizing for our video staff,\u201d Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. The Heat, who ousted East No. 1 seed Milwaukee in the second round, are trying to become the second team in the last 18 seasons to beat a pair of No. 1 seeds in the same playoff. Toronto did it last year, first to Milwaukee, then to Golden State. Before that, one would have to go back to 2002 when the Lakers pulled off the feat. \u201cI\u2019m full of emotions,\u201d Heat guard Goran Dragic said. \u201cI\u2019m happy. I\u2019ve been waiting for this for a long time, for 11, 12 years, and finally I\u2019m here. All the credit goes to those guys who are believing it and to my teammates. I\u2019m just happy. I\u2019ve been through a lot in those five years, ups and downs, and I\u2019m just happy to be here and to be part of this big moment. Can\u2019t wait for the finals.\u201d The Heat celebrated into the wee hours of Monday morning before retiring to their rooms for a few hours of sleep. Adebayo said he enjoyed himself \u2014 within reason. \u201cI had a Shirley Temple,\u201d Adebayo said. The bubble has been a grind. By Game 4 or so of this series, the Lakers and Heat will have been at Disney for three months. A few players have family or friends there now, but for the most part they\u2019ve been isolated throughout this process. It was tough mentally. It was tough physically, playing every other day for the most part once the season resumed on July 30. But all the teams have to get through now is one more series. \u201cWe\u2019re super locked in,\u201d Vogel said. \u201cOur group enjoys each other. We\u2019ve been through a lot. Even though we were really assembled this year, not a team that\u2019s been together for multiple years, with everything that we\u2019ve been through our chemistry is strong. And, you know, I think the fact that we enjoy each other away from the basketball court has really helped with the bubble environment and hopefully that will continue for us.\u201d"},{"id":25491,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/boston-celtics-see-bright-future-despite-loss-east-finals","date":"2020-09-29","title":"Celtics see bright future despite loss in East finals","content":" BOSTON (AP) \u2014 Jayson Tatum emerged as a bona fide star, Jaylen Brown showed he can be a consistent presence in the lineup and Kemba Walker helped the Celtics put the failed Kyrie Irving experiment behind them. But following their Eastern Conference finals loss to Miami, it\u2019s clear there is still work to do in Boston after the Celtics squandered their best opportunity yet under coach Brad Stevens to make it to the NBA Finals. Stevens said he heads into the offseason lamenting only the outcome and not the effort by his players during the abnormal season. \u201cMy regret is not what we put in. My regret is not how we prepared or worked or how hard our guys worked or how committed they were to playing and staying together,\u201d he said. \u201cYou look back at those first couple of games (against Miami) and it put us in a tough spot. I just think that ultimately we had our chances and we didn\u2019t take advantage of it enough.\u201d The Celtics returned from the COVID-19-caused hiatus and emerged as one of the hottest teams in the Florida bubble, winning five of their eight seeding games entering the playoffs. They then swept the Philadelphia 76ers in the first round and held off the defending champion Toronto Raptors in seven games to advance to the conference finals \u2014 all without Gordon Hayward, who was sidelined in the opening game of the Philly series with a sprained right ankle. Despite big efforts from Tatum, Brown and Walker, who all averaged 20 or more points per game in the playoffs, Hayward\u2019s absence was felt in the back-to-back losses to open the series against the Heat, as the Celtics struggled to score against Miami\u2019s athletic front line. That combined with uncharacteristic lapses in defense contributed to them being unable to close out games in the 4-2 series loss. But unlike in previous seasons, the issues were situational and don\u2019t seem to be systemic. That\u2019s something to build on for a team expected to remain a contender in the East next season. \u201cWe got to use this fuel to fuel us to come back stronger, better, mentally, physically, emotionally, psychologically, all of it,\u201d Marcus Smart said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to use it to our advantage to come back. It\u2019s over. We can\u2019t change the past. We can only get ready for the future.\u201d It\u2019s also why Tatum said he doesn\u2019t believe there needs to be wholesale changes. \u201cI believe in this group. I think we were capable. We had more than enough to get the job done. We just let a couple slip away,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of guys got so much better this year and throughout the season, so much better from last season. So just to see guys continue to grow and get better, it\u2019s a lot of fun. It was fun this year.\u201d"},{"id":25513,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/miami-heat-president-pat-riley-still-fight-75","date":"2020-09-28","title":"Heat's Pat Riley still up for a fight at 75","content":" Three decades ago, which is roughly three lifetimes ago for him, the man heard and saw a disturbance develop on the basketball practice court: Two Knicks were ready to kill each other. Charles Oakley and Anthony Mason, a pair of notable bad asses who were angrier than red ants, had a blowup and now were squaring off, with fists balled. Everything around them stopped cold. And then the two began throwing punches and wrestled each other to the floor. When a few teammates tried to rush and break up the fight, they heard a firm and direct order from the person in charge of preventing the chaos: \u201cLet \u2019em go,\u201d Pat Riley said. Riley was a coach then, he worked in New York, and his hair was still jet black. And those are the only differences with the man between then and now. He still believes in building winners, by any means necessary. He subscribes to toughness, a trait he insists is necessary for players to thrive in the NBA. And at 75, an age where many in Florida are shuffle boarding instead of preparing for an NBA championship, Riley is once again up for a fight. It\u2019s hard to say if the 2019-20 Miami Heat are Riley\u2019s magnum opus; after all, when it comes to traveling deep into the NBA calendar, he has been there and done that, almost too many times to count. But this represents quite the satisfying achievement for the Heat president, to put a team in the championship round without a superstar, to get the chance to stare down LeBron James and the Lakers in the process, and to build this title contender by kicking the idea of tanking in the groin. Maybe the best compliment you can pay Riley right now is to suggest this team reflects the personality of its boss. Which is exactly what Riley had in mind when he pushed enough of the right buttons to make a Heat appearance possible in these NBA Finals . \u201cPat is the man,\u201d said swingman Jimmy Butler, the team\u2019s spiritual leader. \u201cWe got a bunch of dogs on this team, and he\u2019s the big dog.\u201d In their first meeting last summer, when he was weighing the decision to sign with the Heat as a free agent, Butler said Riley won him over in five minutes. That sounds about right. Whether it\u2019s tossing championship rings on the table, or delivering compelling and stirring motivational talks, Riley usually gets his man. But that man must meet The Man\u2019s standards, which, in hindsight, Butler surely has. It\u2019s all turning out splendidly for Riley, who has masterfully rebuilt the Heat, six years after LeBron departed and the Big Three dismantled, without enduring a painful rebuild or having the luxury of a Draft pick higher than No. 10 overall. He\u2019s in a demanding, what-have-you-done-lately job that favors the young and penalizes the careless, yet Riley is neither. A winning attitude permeates the Heat culture that Butler raves about. In the last three offseasons, Riley has conducted a master class on how to do more with less. He signed Butler, drafted Tyler Herro and Bam Adebayo and grabbed undrafted diamonds in the rough in Duncan Robinson and Kendrick Nunn. Before this season\u2019s trade deadline, he got Andre Iguodala and Jae Crowder in exchange for basically three players who weren\u2019t really in the rotation. Butler has revved up the competitive pulse, bringing unapologetic fire and an appetite for taking over games in the moment of truth. Adebayo became an All-Star and just finished bulldozing the Celtics with a stellar Game 6 performance at both ends of the floor, and is just realizing how good he can be, especially defensively. Herro is developing rapidly as a big-time scorer who isn\u2019t afraid to take key shots and brings confidence rarely seen among mid first-round picks. Robinson, one of the NBA\u2019s best shooters, cannot be left unguarded on the perimeter. Nunn was an NBA G League standout who became an All-Rookie First Team pick this season. Iguodala is wise and championship tested, having played a key role during the Warriors\u2019 recent dynasty. Crowder has proven to be a solid 3-point shooter and floor-spacer while bringing an ability to guard multiple positions. \u201cHe didn\u2019t assemble this team for us to play 82 games and go home,\u201d Adebayo said. \u201cThat\u2019s not the reason why he brought Jimmy here, that\u2019s not the reason he drafted me, not the reason he got Andre and Jae \u2026 this is all about preparation on how we can win the championship. Pat wouldn\u2019t have assembled this team unless he knew we had great things ahead of us.\u201d What\u2019s impressive is how Riley managed to erase his mistakes to make this happen; great team-builders always do. He overpaid for James Johnson, Hassan Whiteside, Tyler Johnson and Dion Waiters, yet none are around anymore and the damage has been minimal at best. Even more impressive: Butler will be the Heat\u2019s only big-money player in 2020-21. Everyone else is either on rookie deals or minimal contracts. That means the Heat will be in play to sign A-list free agents, and how many will resist the temptations of South Beach and turn down Riley for the chance to play next to Herro, Adebayo and Butler? The prospects for the Heat dimmed considerably when LeBron took his talents from South Beach and went home to Cleveland. Riley felt betrayed. He told author and former NBA.com writer Ian Thomsen in his book, \u201cThe Soul Of Basketball\u201d, the following: \u201cI had two to three days of tremendous anger. I was absolutely livid, which I expressed to myself and my closest friends. My beautiful plan all of a sudden came crashing down. That team in 10 years could have won five or six championships.\u201d A chill developed between LeBron and Riley. LeBron won a championship in Cleveland, which some might say is worth five more in Miami. Chris Bosh had to retire for health reasons and Dwyane Wade turned gimpy and old. He went back home, to Chicago, then ring-chased with his pal LeBron in Cleveland, before a final reunion with Riley and the Heat. Riley was left to deal with the rubble, but he refused to break the team down and rebuild from scratch. Retreating is not in his basketball DNA. The Heat went through a few reinventions designed to stay respectable. The very next season, in 2014-15, the Heat missed the playoffs but were only one win from advancing to the conference finals the following season and had only had one losing season since. And now, this. Riley was the captain of \u201cShowtime\u201d with the Lakers in the NBA\u2019s golden age of the 1980s. He then brought respectability and grit to the Knicks and took them to Game 7 in the 1994 Finals. In Miami, he grabbed Shaquille O\u2019Neal and paired him with Wade to win the team\u2019s first championship in 2006. After that, he went full-time to the front office and formed the \u201cBig Three\u201d Heat. Counting his playing days with the Lakers, he has reached a Finals in six straight decades. When the Heat began the playoffs in this NBA restart, some in the organization urged Riley not to attend the games in Orlando out of concerns for his age, given the coronavirus. Outside the organization, the thought was, why bother? Miami was a No. 5 seed, with mild expectations of going very far. But Riley isn\u2019t easily intimidated, just like his team. He made the trip up Florida\u2019s Turnpike and became a fixture at Heat games, once again sitting next to his wife, Chris, just as they do at American Airlines Arena. And that\u2019s where he\u2019ll be, starting Wednesday, a senior citizen with a white mane watching calmly and showing no outward emotion after the ball goes up. Inside, however, there is a winner within who will expect his team, against steep odds, to fight the good fight. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

(AP) \u2014 Doc Rivers would easily be considered the best coach in Los Angeles Clippers history. Most wins. Most playoff appearances. Top winning percentage. And now he\u2019s out. Rivers announced in a statement posted to Twitter on Monday that he is not returning as coach. The move comes about two weeks after the Clippers wasted a 3-1 series lead and lost to the Denver Nuggets in the Western Conference semifinals. \u201cDoc has been a terrific coach for the Clippers, an incredible ambassador, and a pillar of strength during tumultuous times,\u201d Clippers Chairman Steve Ballmer said in a statement. \u201cHe won a heck of a lot of games and laid a foundation for this franchise.\u201d The Clippers said Rivers and Ballmer came to the decision jointly. Rivers spent seven seasons with the Clippers, making the playoffs in six of them \u2014 major success for a once-woebegone franchise. This season\u2019s team, with the summer 2019 additions of Kawhi Leonard and Paul George, was expected to compete for a championship. But losing three closeout opportunities to the Nuggets cost the Clippers a chance to play the Los Angeles Lakers in the West finals, and likely played a role in Rivers not remaining as coach. \u201cWhen I took this job, my goals were to make this a winning basketball program, a free agent destination, and bring a championship to this organization,\u201d Rivers wrote in the statement. \u201cWhile I was able to accomplish most of my goals, I won\u2019t be able to see them all through.\u201d Rivers went 356-208 over seven seasons with the Clippers, taking them to the West second round three times. But the franchise has never made the conference finals, and going 0-3 in chance to get there this year was a devastating blow. Expectations were high, and on the night the season ended, Rivers took responsibility. \u201cWe didn\u2019t meet them. That\u2019s the bottom line,\u201d Rivers said on Sept. 15 after the Game 7 loss. \u201cI\u2019m the coach and I\u2019ll take any blame for it. But we didn\u2019t meet our expectations, clearly.\u201d This was the third time Rivers saw one of his teams waste a 3-1 series lead. It also happened with eighth-seeded Orlando against top-seeded Detroit in 2003, and with the Clippers against Houston in 2015. The Clippers went 49-23 in the regular season, the fourth-best record in franchise history. Rivers has been the coach in five of the Clippers\u2019 six best regular seasons. Rivers thanked fans for their support. \u201cThough it was a disappointing end to our season, you are right there and I know what this team is capable of accomplishing with your support,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cThank you to all the players, coaches, and staff for helping us get here. Most importantly, thank you to the fans. We went through a lot, and I am grateful for my time here.\u201d The Clippers\u2019 job becomes the sixth current vacancy in the NBA, along with Houston, Indiana, Philadelphia, Oklahoma City and New Orleans. New York, Brooklyn and Chicago have already filled vacancies in their offseasons. Rivers\u2019 departure means the league also is down to four Black coaches currently with jobs: Lloyd Pierce in Atlanta, J.B. Bickerstaff in Cleveland, Monty Williams in Phoenix and Dwane Casey in Detroit. Rivers is the third Black coach to either step down or be fired this offseason, joining Nate McMillan in Indiana and Alvin Gentry in New Orleans. Sam Cassell and Tyronn Lue were both assistants on this Clippers team under Rivers. Lue already has won an NBA title in Cleveland, and Rivers has long said that Cassell is ready to become a head coach. It\u2019s possible they could be among the candidates to take over. \u201cI am immeasurably grateful to Doc for his commitment and contributions to the Clippers and the city of Los Angeles,\u201d Ballmer said. \u201cI am also extremely confident in our front office and our players. We will find the right coach to lead us forward and help us reach our ultimate goals.

Butler was the Heat\u2019s prized free agent, the player whose arrival signaled the formal shift from the Dwyane Wade era to the future. Butler, however, made it clear from the start that Adebayo\u2019s work ethic, character and relentlessness would be the traits that served as the support for whatever course Miami set this season. That path runs to The Finals this week, for a showdown with the Los Angeles Lakers \u2014 thanks to Adebayo, whose energy and activity fueled a furious fourth-quarter blitz of the Boston Celtics Sunday night at AdventHealth Arena in Game 6 of the Eastern Conference finals. Adebayo scored a career-high 32 points, grabbed 14 rebounds and dished out 5 assists, overpowering the Celtics around the basket and really all over the floor in an emphatic 125-113 win that clinched the Heat\u2019s first Finals appearance since 2014. > NBA Finals, Game 1: Wednesday at 9 ET on ABC He joined Shaquille O\u2019Neal and LeBron James and Wade as the only players in franchise history to go for 30, 10 and 5 in a postseason game. Two days after taking the blame for the Heat\u2019s Game 5 loss, Adebayo refused to let them falter. \u201cHe didn\u2019t let anybody down. We played bad as a whole,\u201d Butler said. \u201cBut I love the fact that he wants that pressure. He wants all of that on his shoulders. That\u2019s why he\u2019s the heart and soul of this team. He\u2019s one of our leaders. That\u2019s what stars do. He\u2019s put himself on the map since he\u2019s come into the league, and he\u2019s huge for us, will continue to be that for us, and he knows how special he has to play in these next four wins.\u201d It\u2019s hard to imagine the Heat being in this position without the work Adebayo has done all season. But he\u2019s been particularly effective in this playoff run, playing like a man beyond his 23 years and relatively modest experience in the league. Butler knew what he had in Adebayo when he joined the Heat. \u201cI pay attention to it. I pay attention to a lot of guys \u2014 [that] just play hard,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause whenever you want to admit it or not, that\u2019s a talent. It\u2019s hard to play hard for 48 minutes and I knew that he was going to be key in what we were trying to do. Talking to Coach Pat [Riley] and talking to Coach Spo and them saying what he can do, but then when you actually get out there with him it\u2019s so different because he really can do it better than anybody can say that he can. \u201cI just love being around him. He\u2019s a good dude. He cares about winning. He cares about his teammates. He\u2019s the heart and soul of this thing, I keep saying it, but he\u2019s going to be the reason that we win a championship.\u201d Adebayo would not be denied Sunday, not with all the was on the line. \u201cAfter the game, after Game 5, I put that on myself that my teammates would never \u2014 would never have that type of performance from me again,\u201d Adebayo said. \u201cFor those 24 hours, I was locked in, and my family know how I get when I play bad, or especially we lose, I put that on my shoulders because I feel like I could have done something different. Tonight I did something different and came out being extra aggressive and just locked in. I made a promise to [Heat veteran Udonis Haslem]. When you all see UD, you ask him \u2014 I can\u2019t tell you.\u201d Heat coach Erik Spoelstra can tell you all about Adebayo, who he says is introducing himself to the public this season. Just like Butler, Spoelstra loved that Adebayo wanted to shoulder the responsibility for Game 5. And he didn\u2019t see the need for any pep talk to get Adebayo going for what was the biggest game of his young career. \u201cNo. I loved it,\u201d Spoelstra said. \u201cI wanted to let him know and everybody know that it wasn\u2019t his responsibility. All the greats have done that, take that responsibility, and then prove it the next opportunity. He is a great, elite competitor. I love everything that he\u2019s about.\u201d The Heat knew Aebayo was about all the right things that fit their culture when they selected him with the 17th pick in the 2017 Draft after his lone season at Kentucky. \u201cBam is one of the great competitors already in this association. He\u2019s going to become one of the great winners in the history just because he\u2019s so competitive,\u201d Spoelstra said. \u201cHe moves the needle in every single way. You can\u2019t put an analytic to his game and that\u2019s probably why he was overlooked in college. He competes every single possession. He\u2019s really growing into a leadership role. Way beyond his years. His offensive game is just growing daily. And he wants the responsibility, and he wants the accountability, and he isn\u2019t afraid of putting that responsibility on his shoulders, and that\u2019s what he did the other night. \u201cAll the greats in the history of the game have done that before. It was not his fault. That was a collective effort, including the coaching staff, but he wanted to take a step forward and put it on his broad shoulders, and he backed that up tonight. He was sensational. And just from a competitive standpoint, all across the board.\u201d With the Heat in a tight slugfest deep into the fourth quarter Sunday, Adebayo simply turned his energy up to another level over and over again. The game was tied at 96, the Celtics surged ahead two more times, only to have Adebayo respond immediately in the moment. The first time it was a drive and wicked two-handed dunk over Daniel Theis. The final time, with 6:16 to play, it was a jumper for a lead the Heat would never relinquish. They finished the final nine minutes of the game on 35-17 run, with Adebayo in the middle of the mix. Again, Adebayo is all about winning. Whatever it takes, whenever it\u2019s needed. \u201cIt\u2019s just one of those things, you know, coaches they want me to be better and they want me to do great things,\u201d Adebayo said. \u201cThat\u2019s the first time I got plays, back-to-back, back-to-back. Being in that moment and embracing it and taking over is a great thing for me. But at the end of the day, we got four more. Our business isn\u2019t done yet.\u201d Not by a longshot. A favored Lakers team, with LeBron, Anthony Davis, Dwight Howard and JaVale McGee are standing in the way and every bit as determined as the Heat. Still, Butler made a point of not glossing over Adebayo\u2019s breakout moment. \u201cThat\u2019s what stars do,\u201d he said. \u201cThey find a way to win. They impact winning. He\u2019s done it all year long, along with so many other guys. It\u2019s like I say, any other game, you never know who it\u2019s going to be on any given night because you can\u2019t key in on one guy. We have so much trust in each other, and we have a lot of trust in Bam, and Bam makes sure that we win the game tonight.\u201d Adebayo was 14 when \u201cThe Heatles\u201d were competing for and winning championships. He said he grew up watching and rooting for those teams, dreaming about one day making his way to the big stage. The belief shown him, he said, is the reflection of the franchise\u2019s belief in this team, with it\u2019s surprisingly well-matched parts, and the collective grind that has led them to this final series of what seems like an endless season. \u201cHe didn\u2019t assemble this team for us to just play 82 games and go home,\u201d Adebayo said of Riley\u2019s masterplan. \u201cThat\u2019s not the reason why he brought Jimmy here. That\u2019s not the reason why he drafted me and not the reason why he got Andre [Iguodala] and Jae [Crowder] or Solo[mon Hil] and Derrick [Jones Jr.]. This is all preparation on how can we win a championship. I love this team he brought together because we are all underdogs. We\u2019re here now. \u201cThat\u2019s been one of my dreams to be in the Finals. I grew up watching Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade and LeBron in the Finals and it\u2019s crazy that I get to walk on the Finals floor and actually play. It\u2019s going to be a great moment for all of us. Pat wouldn\u2019t have assembled this team unless he knew we had great things ahead of us. I appreciate Pat, the Riley family, Spo and his family. Everybody from the top to the bottom, I appreciate it just because they believed in us.\u201d Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

For most of the rest of the league, though, getting to The Finals is no small accomplishment. They hand out hardware for winning your conference for a reason. And even teams that lose in The Finals etch themselves into NBA history to a degree, say, that No. 1 seeds do not. > NBA Finals, Game 1: Wednesday at 9 ET on ABC The Miami Heat, by eliminating the Boston Celtics in Game 6 Sunday 125-113, won the East . It was difficult. It was e-x-t-e-n-d-e-d, taking most of a year. And it deserved a moment or two of appreciation. The Heat reached the championship series playing from down under as the East\u2019s No. 5 seed, then methodically going through the Nos. 4, 1 and 3 seeds. (That No. 3, Boston, took care of No. 2 Toronto, so you could say the Heat went through the Raptors too.) Where they are now, they\u2019re still four victories shy of the goal players and coaches actually do talk about, the only goal that matters to an all-timer like James. But this level, this seam between what the Heat just did and the task awaiting them, is too significant and took too much work to simply skip over. Miami emerged from the East by toppling the Pacers, the Bucks and the Celtics to the tune of a 12-3 playoff record. They earned the title shot against James, Miami\u2019s former superstar, and that storied franchise from Los Angeles. They joined past underdogs such as the 1995 Houston Rockets and the 1999 New York Knicks in getting this far. So whether they realize it or admit it or not, it\u2019s kind of a big deal. Especially to these five members of the Heat team, who checked some pretty important boxes merely by reaching The Finals: Coach Erik Spoelstra It\u2019s a futile exercise debating where Spoelstra ranks in the pantheon of active NBA coaches. Some would say that four consecutive trips to The Finals (2011-14), with championships in \u201912 and \u201913, cemented Spoelstra near the top before this season even began. Lottery finishes in \u201915, \u201917 and \u201919 might pump the brakes on that, along with the \u201che only won when he had LeBron\u201d slights. That\u2019s why getting back to The Finals this year \u2014 without James and buddies Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh doing the heavy lifting the way they did on Spoelstra\u2019s first four trips \u2014 is such a credit to him. Instead of the game\u2019s dominant \u201cBig Three\u201d, Spoelstra and the Heat did it with one all-NBA third team player (Jimmy Butler) and assorted parts that fit. The Heat play hard, they put defense first, they innovated as needed (the zone defense that dug Boston a 3-1 hole), they spread the offense around and they really do seem to put outcomes before egos, heading into The Finals opener Wednesday   (9 ET, ABC). There\u2019s no way that all happens if not for this coach \u2014 with, in this case, the complete support of Godfather Pat Riley upstairs. Jimmy Butler Many \u2014 as in me, for one \u2014 have underestimated Butler at each stage of his NBA development, from No. 30 pick in 2011 to a starter two years later to four straight All-Star selections. He won a Kia Most Improved Player Award in 2015, earned four All-Defensive Team berths and played chicken with the Chicago Bulls (and won) in the negotiation of his first big contract, also in 2015. Butler\u2019s reputation for a head that was growing as fast as his game got him traded from Chicago and later Minnesota. He didn\u2019t endear himself to the Philadelphia 76ers, either, who instead invested in Tobias Harris as their third option behind Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons. Even when Miami wooed Butler with his four-year, $140.7 million contract in July 2019, the consensus on the largely self-made, 6-foot-7 wing was: \u201cNot good enough to be the best player on a championship contender.\u201d Well look where he is now. At 31, with Bam Adebayo\u2019s and Tyler Herro\u2019s rapid ascension, Butler might not be the Heat\u2019s best player for long. But he is their alpha, and he has led his team further than Embiid, Giannis Antetokounmpo, James Harden, Chris Paul, Damian Lillard, Blake Griffin, Paul George and several others considered more skilled or team-oriented. \u201cI\u2019m not for everybody,\u201d Butler said Sunday, \u201cbut here I am.\u201d Moving to Miami, Butler\u2019s place in his team\u2019s pecking order instantly became a non-issue. He wasn\u2019t giving up the ball to Embiid or Simmons, he wasn\u2019t obsessed with his paycheck behind Karl Anthony-Towns or Andrew Wiggins. No contented young stars uninterested in Butler\u2019s candid and self-appointed style of leadership, not with the Heat. \u201cHe\u2019s being himself,\u201d Adebayo said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we love about Jimmy, he\u2019s being himself. That\u2019s hard knocks, that\u2019s who he is. And we accept that here.\u201d Said Spoelstra: \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have to make any apologies for who he is. We love him for who he is and what he\u2019s all about. He impacts winning. I think everybody in the league has always known that. It\u2019s not about stats. It\u2019s not about anything else. He cares.\u201d Spoelstra and Butler spoke about the night the Heat recruited him and how, over dinner, neither the coach nor Pat Riley got a chance to make their formal pitch. He clicked with their style and plan, assuring them he was \u201cin\u201d before the money talk. \u201cMore than anything, they wanted me to be here,\u201d Butler said. \u201cThey told me, like, \u2018Yo, you\u2019re the guy that we want. We\u2019re coming after you.\u2019 \u2026 To be wanted, that\u2019s what anybody wants in the world, not just basketball.\u201d Anyone familiar with Butler\u2019s back story \u2014 being tossed out of his house by his single mother as a teenager in Tomball, Texas, then clawing up rung by rung through Marquette to a shot at the NBA \u2014 understands how important the Heat\u2019s sense of home is to him. Said Adebayo: \u201cWhen Jimmy came into this team, he wanted to get in where he fit in. He didn\u2019t come in like, \u2018This is my show and this is how I\u2019m going to do it. This is my way or the highway.\u2019 He came in and bought into the system. He didn\u2019t care if he scored.\u201d Butler is the best player on a championship contender, and I\u2019m officially done underestimating him. Andre Iguodala If they gave out MVPs in the conference finals, old man Iguodala \u2014 he\u2019s 36 \u2014 might have grabbed it with his Game 6 contribution, not unlike the way he snatched the 2015 Finals MVP trophy. Iguodala scored 15 points on 5-of-5 shooting, including all four of his 3-pointers. He had two steals, played almost 28 minutes and was a plus-20. He had, as some cranky Celtics fans put it on social media, the type of game Gordon Hayward should have had Sunday. Mostly what Iguodala accomplished was reaching The Finals for the sixth consecutive postseason. His first five came with Golden State and now he\u2019ll face James again, as he did from 2015-2018. Certainly, Iguodala took a circuitous route to the 2020 Finals, even without the virus shutdown. Unhappy about being traded by the Warriors to the Grizzlies, he sat out the first 51 games with Memphis (while getting paid), until the Grizzlies shipped him to Miami in early February. The Heat promptly signed him to a two-year extension for another $30 million. His work prior to the playoffs \u2014 4.6 points in about 20 minutes \u2014 made the veteran of 16 NBA seasons look a bit like toast. But his ability to guard multiple positions and chip in offensively as he did Sunday had Spoelstra gushing anew about Iguodala\u2019s \u201cchampionship experience, championship pedigree.\u201d Tyler Herro Herro wasn\u2019t too happy with landing on the NBA\u2019s All-Rookie second team this season, but there\u2019s an easy fix for that. He just needs to swap spots with teammate Kendrick Nunn, a first-teamer whose star dimmed in the postseason. The Finals might present the ultimate stage on which to do that. Nunn had been a revelation for the Heat in the regular season, scoring big (15.3 ppg) and starting all 67 games he played. But his role dwindled in the playoffs to 11.6 minutes and 3.2 points per game in just nine appearances. One big reason was Herro, who showed he was ready for his postseason close-up by scoring 37 points off the bench in Game 4. That\u2019s the NBA playoff record for a rookie reserve. Then Herro chipped in 19 points in Game 6 Sunday, with five rebounds and seven assists. He was on the floor the entire fourth quarter, when the Heat put the Celtics out by outscoring them 37-27. Goran Dragic There seemed to be genuine appreciation from Spoelstra for Dragic\u2019s work with Miami not just this season but for the past six. That\u2019s how long he\u2019s been on board, arriving as James was exiting in the summer of 2014. The Slovenian point guard has been a consummate pro through the ups and downs \u2014 like Bosh\u2019s abrupt retirement due to health issues \u2014 in Miami since. The Heat had promised him better and now, reaching the Finals, made good on it. \u201cThis was a promise that Pat [Riley] and I made to Goran Dragic six years ago, that we would have a contending team,\u201d Spoelstra said. \u201cNo one would know those turn of events, a bunch of events that we couldn\u2019t control, and he stayed with it. Stayed with it and we are able to build some solid pieces around him.\u201d Now 34, an All-Star in 2018 but stuck in the trainers\u2019 room with injuries in his Miami stint, Dragic never has played this deep into a postseason. It\u2019s hard to imagine him sounding more thrilled by winning The Finals than my reaching one. \u201cIt\u2019s unreal,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m full of emotions. I\u2019m happy. I\u2019ve been waiting for this for a long time, for 11, 12 years, and finally I\u2019m here.\u201d It\u2019s a big deal to a lot of them. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Either way, the point was clear: This opportunity was a long time coming. Phil Jackson, Pat Riley, Paul Westhead, Bill Sharman and John Kundla all won championships in their first seasons as Lakers coach, and now Vogel has the chance to join that group. The 47-year-old New Jersey native will see the finals stage for the first time this week when the Lakers face off against either the Miami Heat or the Boston Celtics. \u201cThis career achievement is so far away from where I\u2019m at mentally right now,\u201d Vogel said Saturday night, talking while wearing the Lakers\u2019 new Western Conference championship shirt and cap. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to play my part. Give our guys a plan, make sure that everybody is playing together.\u201d He makes it sound simple. Nothing was simple. Not this year. The Lakers are 64-22 this season when adding up the regular season and the playoffs, on pace for the seventh-best record in franchise history. For an organization with 16 championships, that\u2019s no small achievement. Vogel\u2019s season started with championship expectations, which are always accompanied by immense pressure. He had to navigate his team through a preseason made rocky by getting caught in the political squabble between China and the NBA \u2014 a mess that flared to a very ugly level when the Lakers were in China last October. And then came the devastation on Jan. 26, when Kobe Bryant died in a helicopter crash. \u201cHe\u2019s been great. He\u2019s been unbelievable,\u201d Lakers forward LeBron James said of Vogel. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s been a crazy obstacle course for our franchise this whole year. \u2026 He\u2019s been able to manage it the whole time. Bringing in guys, losing guys. He\u2019s just always been the anchor, and our coaching staff has been right behind him. I can\u2019t say anything more than that.\u201d The Lakers were sputtering in their early days in the bubble, with the offense the lowest-ranked out of the 22 teams at Disney. Vogel never flinched. And the Lakers have gone 12-3 in the first three rounds of the playoffs. The sputter is long forgotten. \u201cHe trusts us,\u201d Lakers forward Anthony Davis said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the only thing you can ask for in a coach is to trust your players. But at the same time. we have to trust him.\u201d There\u2019s so much irony that can be found surrounding Vogel\u2019s first trip to the NBA Finals. First, it comes on the outskirts of Orlando, where Vogel coached for two dismal seasons and took the fall when he was fired in April 2018 for the Magic having a roster that featured a bad combination of too little talent and too many injuries. Next, it comes with James playing for him instead of against him, as he was when the Miami Heat ended Vogel\u2019s seasons with the Indiana Pacers in 2012, 2013 and 2014. Those Heat and Pacers teams, quite simply, hated each other. Vogel wound up leaving the Pacers as their NBA-era leader in coaching wins, then had two bad seasons in Orlando, and the finals seemed a long way away. \u201cYou always wonder,\u201d Vogel said. \u201cI was always hopeful that I would get another opportunity. I remained confident in my belief in myself.\u201d That\u2019s always been a Vogel trademark. Vogel fell in love with the game as a kid, his first brush with fame coming as a 13-year-old when he appeared on \u201cLate Night with David Letterman\u201d and spun a basketball on one end of a toothbrush while using the bristled end on his teeth. \u201cYou\u2019re going to knock every tooth out of your head doing this,\u201d Letterman said. The teeth were fine. The trick he learned at a basketball camp is still in his arsenal, too. Clearly, he\u2019s added a few more skills along the way. He eventually made his way to Kentucky and got noticed by then-Wildcats coach Rick Pitino. After Pitino jumped to the NBA (and Vogel got his degree from Kentucky in biology), he brought Vogel to the Celtics as a video coordinator. A career began. And more than two decades later, a ring is four wins from Vogel\u2019s finger. \u201cThis run is about LeBron James and Anthony Davis and all the guys that bought into starring in their roles and about the Lakers family who is used to being in this position and used to being in the finals, used to winning championships,\u201d Vogel said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time for them and it\u2019s been a difficult number of years out of the playoffs. So it\u2019s really just all about them.\u201d"},{"id":3281,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/los-angeles-lakers-lebron-james-reach-nba-finals","date":"2020-09-27","title":"Lakers reach The Finals after difficult decade","content":" ORLANDO, Fla. \u2014 Dwight Howard was in the middle of the mix the last time the Los Angeles Lakers thought they\u2019d assembled a sure-fire championship team.

They were charged with resurrecting the championship fortunes of a franchise that had seen that shine fade in the aftermath of back-to-back titles won in 2009 and 2010. They were the group that would capture the franchise\u2019s 17th banner, cementing the legacies of all involved and restore some order to a league that was transitioning from an era dominated by the Lakers and San Antonio Spurs. It was the summer before the 2012-13 season. And there was opening at the top of the Western Conference for a super team to rival the megawatt Miami Heat team led by LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh. It never happened, of course. They went through three head coaches. Injuries decimated the roster. The inability to mesh all those superstar pieces and the pressure that came with it, was more than the franchise could handle, especially after the death of beloved owner Jerry Buss in February of 2013. The Lakers struggled to make the playoffs only to be swept by the Spurs in the first round, a merciless end to an experiment that would leave a stain on all involved and the franchise for years. That scar tissue from that experience is what made Saturday\u2019s confetti shower and Western Conference finals championship celebration extra sweet for Howard. He\u2019s back in Lakers\u2019 uniform, back in the starting line, as they closed out the Denver Nuggets in Game 5 of the Western Conference finals and prepare to compete for that 17th championship. \u201cWow, that was seven years ago,\u201d Howard said as he exited an interview room at AdventHealth Arena. \u201cThat seems like a lifetime ago.\u201d A couple in the NBA. A Golden State Warriors dynasty has come and gone since the Lakers last competed on this stage in 2010. The Lakers missed the playoffs six straight seasons after that 2013 flameout against the Spurs. Nash is a coach now, taking over in Brooklyn. James is the face of the Lakers\u2019 franchise now, with Anthony Davis as the heir apparent. Bryant died in a January helicopter crash in Los Angeles along with his daughter GiGi and seven others. His legacy now serves as the inspiration for a franchise resurrection that began two years ago, when LeBron chose the rebuilding Lakers in free agency. It\u2019s a story only Hollywood could tell. Then Lakers president Magic Johnson serves as the chief recruiter and LeBron, fresh off of eight straight trips to The Finals with Miami and Cleveland, is supposed to lead a motel crew of hand-picked vets and previously assembled lottery picks back to the top. That never happened either. A severe groin injury derailed his season and the Lakers\u2019 chases of competing for a playoff spot. Rumors of young stars being trade bait for Davis crushed the culture and camaraderie in the locker room. Alleged backbiting and politics put a strain on the front office \u2014 namely between Magic and general manager Rob Pelinka \u2014 assembled by owner Jeanie Buss. Magic resigned before season\u2019s end , a failed attempt at trading for Davis having added another public stain on the Lakers\u2019 brand. Luke Walton was jettisoned as head coach shortly thereafter, replaced by Frank Vogel. The memes about LeBron \u2019 s extended offseason were relentless. The \u201c washed king\u201d narrative took on a life of its own. Pelinka replaced Magic as the chief decision-maker. The Davis trade was finally made and they tried to convince Kawhi Leonard, the bigger free agent prize on the market last summer, riding the wave of his Finals MVP and title run in Toronto, to join them. Leonard pulled a power move of his own, convincing Paul George to force his way out of Oklahoma City and join him on a super team of their own down the hallway at Staples Center with the Clippers. The Lakers absorbed the ego hit and moved on. Instead of repeating the folly of trying to fit LeBron into their theoretical championship framework this time, the organization plotted a course with heavy input from the two superstar catalysts that have guided them all season. After nine trips to The Finals as the centerpiece of each one of those teams, it shouldn\u2019t have been too difficult to retrace the blueprint that worked five times in Cleveland and four times in Miami. Pelinka reiterated the \u201cintentionality\u201d in the construction of the roster during the trophy ceremony Saturday night. Obviously it starts with the pairing of top-five superstar talent. They also put a premium on veterans with championship and championship-level experience, guys like Rajon Rondo, Danny Green, JaVale McGee, Quinn Cook, J.R. Smith and Howard. \u201c This team is special,\u201d Davis said. \u201c\u2026 some guys on some teams are in it for selfish reasons and things like that. But this group of guys for sure only want one thing, and that\u2019s to win a championship.\u201d The one LeBron had to watch everyone else compete for last season after spending the better part of the past decade in that crucible. So he watched the playoffs, every single game, he insists, all while preparing his body and mind for this rejuvenated season, his 17th and potentially one of the best and most tumultuous of his illustrious career. He had to assume an even larger leadership role after Bryant\u2019s death. He had to keep the Lakers together during a wild start to 2020 that saw the season interrupted for four months by the coronavirus pandemic, gut-punched by nationwide social unrest and the emotional grind of being some of the most visible faces in a generational movement fighting for equality for Black and other marginalized people. And that was before the NBA season restart here in the bubble, where another police-involved shooting in Kenosha, Wis., threatened to shut the bubble down in the first round of the playoffs. \u201cFor us as a franchise, I\u2019m extremely proud to be a part of this franchise getting back to where it belongs,\u201d James said, \u201cand that\u2019s playing for championships and competing for championships and representing the Western Conference in the championships. This is what I came here for. I heard all the conversations and everything that was said about why did I decide to come to L.A \u2014 the reason I came to L.A., it was not about basketball. All those conversations, just naysayers and things of that nature. \u201cI understood that, with the season I had last year and my injury, it just gave them more sticks and more wood to throw in the fire to continue to say the things that they would say about me. But it never stopped my journey and never stopped my mindset and never stopped my goal.\u201d James praised the Nuggets and their coach, Mike Malone, for bringing out the best in him and the Lakers, knowing they needed the push if they are going to take that necessary next step to winning it all. He needed a moment at the end of Game 5 to collect himself just thinking about it. \u201cYeah, just, one, getting my breath back underneath me after a hard-fought series against one of the most well-coached team I\u2019ve ever played against in the postseason,\u201d he said, \u201cone of the most respected teams I\u2019ve played against. Obviously, you guys know how much I love Mike Malone. He\u2019s incredible. He\u2019s the reason why that team is so damn good.\u201d Malone showed the same love for what James has done during his incredible run. \u201c Yeah, it is incredible. And when you just step back and look and marvel at what LeBron is doing at this stage of his career, how he continues to find ways to improve and get better and take whatever team he\u2019s on to new heights, that defines his greatness,\u201d Nuggets coach Mike Malone said. \u201cTenth Finals appearance. I know everybody wants to get caught up in the whole argument, the greatest of all time. That is an unwinnable debate. LeBron is a great player and he\u2019s one of the greatest to ever do it and his resume speaks for itself. And like I mentioned earlier, in a Game 5, closeout game, when the game was hanging in the balance, who took over? The best player on the floor. And that\u2019s what you\u2019ve come to expect from him.\u201d LeBron insists it\u2019s not about him now. It\u2019s about the unfinished business at hand for the Lakers. There is still some unfinished business that needs to be tented to in the coming days, expectations to be met exceeded. They\u2019re still four wins shy of the ultimate goal, with either the Heat or longtime rival Boston Celtics standing in the way . So that means more of the dogged James who has driven these Lakers all season. \u201cI just feel he\u2019s had a chip on his shoulder all year long,\u201d Vogel said. \u201cEverybody has doubters. To be in the Eastern Conference and get there as much as he had, now to come over to the Western Conference, I think just an enormous accomplishment to do it with a third team. \u201cSo much respect for him and love for him and what he\u2019s meant to me. He has empowered this whole group with just buying into the plan that we had, with how we wanted to play this year, and getting the whole group to buy in. Obviously a great part of why we\u2019ve had this success. Understanding that the job is not done.\u201d * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

But enough about Michael Jordan, star of \u201cThe Last Dance\u201d, this year\u2019s smash basketball documentary. This is now about LeBron James and his quest to expand his galactic legacy. By the fourth quarter in Game 5 of the Western Conference finals , you could plainly see that LeBron would not be denied a 10th trip to the NBA Finals. He dropped 3s from deep. He went hard to the rim, scattering Nuggets\u2019 bodies like bowling pins. And he sent bullet passes to open teammates for jumpers. Yes, this was arguably LeBron\u2019s finest 12 minutes in the NBA restart, mainly because the scent of the Finals was simply too strong to resist. He scored 15 points in the final quarter of Denver\u2019s season and once again was the best player on a floor he shared with Lakers teammate Anthony Davis and a pair of percolating Nuggets stars, Nikola Jokic and Jamal Murray. Not that any of them mattered much on a night like this. LeBron had 38-16-10. And he did all of this in the latter stages of September, in his 17th NBA season and his 35th year on Planet Earth. Nine of the last 10 Finals have now included LeBron, and the one year he wasn\u2019t involved \u2014 last season, his first with the Lakers \u2014 he was hurt. With the West title in the bag, LeBron is now hunting for his fourth championship and by extension a bigger prize: Winning the greatest-ever debate vs. Jordan, an ongoing hot-take that surely will be revisited (a) in the coming days; and especially (b) if LeBron conquers the Celtics or Heat, whichever opponent emerges from the East. Because really, in an age where arguing over issues both important and trivial has become a national pastime in itself, isn\u2019t that what this really is all about? Not the Lakers gunning for a 17th championship, not AD getting some championship stripes and not even LeBron vs. the next foe \u2026 but LeBron vs. Jordan? The TV debate shows and 24-hour sports radio stations and the internet are desperately clearing their throats and bracing for this. (We would include the water cooler and how that discussion is also preparing for a LeBron-Jordan remix, but nobody goes to the office anymore.) If nothing else, LeBron will bring an upgraded resume to the table. His performance Saturday was bloodthirsty and borderline brilliant when the game was on the line. \u201cIn a closeout game, I\u2019m just as desperate as the team we\u2019re trying to close out. I don\u2019t want to play another game in the series. I\u2018m not undefeated in closeout games but my mindset is: I do not want to play another game.\u201d The triple double brought him three closer to Magic Johnson\u2019s all-time post-season record. The poor Nuggets never had a chance once LeBron locked in and willed the Lakers to next week. It left an impression on his teammates and coaches. Danny Green: \u201cHe\u2019s the greatest player in the goddamn world.\u201d Lakers coach Frank Vogel: \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve ever witnessed a guy take over the fourth quarter of a game in person, possession after possession after possession.\u201d AD: \u201cIn the fourth quarter, he told us it was his time. He just took over. Everybody kind of got out of the way and let him be him.\u201d The just-acquired West title is the current culmination of a season that saw LeBron finish second in the MVP voting while garnering raves for his ability to play at a high level in middle age. Also, it\u2019s his first year playing mainly at point guard; James led the league in assists and uplifted his teammates and bonded quickly with AD in their first season together. LeBron also left little doubt that he\u2019s still the best player on this team (with all due respect to fellow All-NBA first teamer Davis) and that he\u2019s winning the battle against advanced age. \u201cI\u2019ve taken care of my body, been available to my teammates,\u201d he said. \u201cI try to get as much sleep as I can. And I\u2019ve never cheated the game. I put so much into my craft, so much into the game, played with great coaches and coaching staffs. I\u2019m truly blessed and they\u2019ve all allowed me to be me, do the things on the floor that I do.\u201d Vogel said LeBron has \u201chad a chip on his shoulder all year long\u201d because of critics both real and imaginary, and also because of the challenge of playing in the more competitive West and conquering all obstacles. LeBron wasn\u2019t ready to label this a mission accomplished, however: \u201cThe job is not done, but it\u2019s great to hit moments in the journey and appreciate it.\u201d Yes, there\u2019s still work to be done. Next up is most likely the Heat, now holding a 3-2 lead on the Celtics. What a coincidence that would be, to go against the team he once helped win a pair of titles, to have a chance to look Heat president Pat Riley in the eye. Yet, the real opponent is Jordan, who two decades after his sixth and final championship still holds a spell over the basketball world, even among those who never saw him play live. If you doubt this, then you didn\u2019t watch the documentary on the Bulls\u2019 dynasty and certainly can\u2019t comprehend how that TV series, from a ratings standpoint, is superior to any playoff series LeBron has played in this 2020 restart. Also, since Jordan is 6-0 in championships, LeBron can\u2019t win that battle, even though his teams weren\u2019t favored in five of his six losses in the Finals, the lone embarrassment being the stumble to the Mavericks in 2011 in the first year of \u2018The Heatles\u2019. All of that will be revisited in due time, depending on what LeBron does once the ball goes up this week for Game 1 of The Finals. He spoke briefly Saturday about his legacy and tried to place it into context, while realizing his basketball story is still ongoing: \u201cI want to travel my own journey because it is my journey. As Frank Sinatra would say: I did it my way. I hope I\u2019ve inspired enough people to play the right way, and have respect from my teammates, the players whom I played against and the teams I represented. At the end of the day, all you have is respect.\u201d LeBron James definitely has respect, that much is for certain. But a debate-crazed basketball country wants to know if he has Jordan yet, now or ever. Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

Nobody brings it up when they lose. So we\u2019ll have to wait until Sunday night, when Game 6 of the Eastern Conference finals is over to know whether \u201cculture\u201d made a difference or not. What the Heat and their most fervent supporters call culture, other teams refer to as standard operating procedures. Or rules, policies, standards, habits, traditions or \u201cthe way we do things around here.\u201d Some don\u2019t even talk about that stuff at all, because they\u2019re too busy trying to find opportunities and fix what\u2019s broken on the fly in an NBA playoff series. Against a formidable opponent, the Boston Celtics, who could talk morning till night about the culture they have as a city and as a franchise, without altering the fact that they trail 3-2 in the best-of-seven series. > Game 6: Celtics vs. Heat, Tuesday at 7:30 ET on TNT The Celtics staved off elimination Friday in Game 4 because they defended more extensively, attacked the rim, took better care of the basketball than they had been, and likely had an adrenaline boost from staring in the face their season\u2019s potential demise. They\u2019ll have to do it again Sunday (TNT, 7:30 ET) and, if successful, again on Tuesday. \u201cEvery game is hard,\u201d said Boston coach Brad Stevens, in a Zoom conference with reporters. \u201cEvery time you play a playoff game, it\u2019s its own entity. It\u2019s not as much about momentum as it is making sure you do what you do best as much as you can and create a momentum in that game.\u2019 Similarly, Miami needs to counter whatever revived hope and momentum the Celtics have not with culture but by addressing slippage and failures from what had worked so well in their 10-1 postseason start. The Heat have dropped two of the past three in the series, culture not withstanding. It hasn\u2019t been center Bam Adebayo\u2019s fault, as he nobly claimed late Friday. And it had nothing to do with responding or not to veteran forward-slash-semi-coach Udonis Haslem\u2019s exhortations during a second-half timeout. Miami got a little lulled by its potent first half, 58 points that coach Erik Spoelstra feared might tempt his players to relax defensively. The team\u2019s 3-point shooting continued its slide \u2014 3-for-18 in the second half. And Jimmy Butler, so lauded for his leadership between games and closing ability late in games, wasn\u2019t up to the job Friday. \u201cWe weren\u2019t communicating,\u201d Butler said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t as aggressive on either end of the floor, and they were way too comfortable.\u201d Spoelstra expressed utmost confidence in his shooters Saturday. \u201cOur guys are like a powder keg,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can explode at any time.\u201d But after 14 playoff games, this is looking like a legit trend. The Heat shot 39.1% from the arc in the first round against Indiana, 37.3% in the conference semifinals against Milwaukee and now 30.1% against Boston. During the regular season, Miami ranked second overall at 35.4%. Factor in Boston\u2019s prowess at contesting on the perimeter and that\u2019s a problem. The Celtics ranked fourth in defensive field goal percentage overall in 2019-20 and second vs. 3-point attempts. Among the Heat\u2019s rotation guys, Jae Crowder is making only 26.2% (11-42 3Ps) and guard Goran Dragic is at 32.4% (11-34). As electric as rookie reserve Tyler Herro\u2019s 37-point performance was in Game 4, he\u2019s shooting an OK 35.0% (14-40). Even sniper Duncan Robinson is down by his standards \u2014 after hitting 47.0% during the season, he tops Miami at 35.7% (15-42). \u201cThey\u2019re very good at defending the 3-point line,\u201d Spoelstra said. \u201cThey\u2019ve taken us off of some of our normal rhythm 3s. We\u2019ve also missed some open ones.\u201d While it\u2019s true Miami\u2019s shooters could go off at any time, they probably don\u2019t want to wait until Game 8. Then there\u2019s Butler, who has been praised for his knack of knowing what his team needs at any given point in a big game. Except what the Heat needed in Game 5 was more production than Butler\u2019s second half of three points on 1-for-5 shooting with no rebounds and three assists. After that finish, Butler got asked about how he would counsel Adebayo to stop blaming himself. It\u2019s a different sort of leadership Miami needs from Butler at this point to get that proverbial toughest victory of the four. Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

(AP) \u2014 There have been two undeniable truths about the Miami Heat this season. They must make 3\u2019s to win. They aren\u2019t invincible with sizable leads. The Boston Celtics have scouting and analytics teams that undoubtedly know these trends. But, really, so would anyone who simply can read a boxscore. Take away Miami\u2019s 3\u2019s, and the Heat are easier to beat. The Celtics proved that again in Game 5 of the Eastern Conference finals when they extended their season with a victory \u2014 and will aim to take the same tact Sunday night when they meet the Heat again in another must-win for Boston. \u201cThey\u2019re going to hit some shots, they\u2019re going to make some plays,\u201d Celtics forward Jayson Tatum said. \u201cThey\u2019ve got some good players. We\u2019re just trying to make it as tough as we could.\u201d The Heat have played 87 games this season and shot below 20% from 3-point range in just three of them \u2014 one of them being Friday night, when the Celtics prevailed 121-108 to cut Miami\u2019s lead in the series to 3-2. Miami was 7 for 36 from deep, just 19%. \u201cRegardless of whether it\u2019s going in or not, that can\u2019t affect your commitment on the other side of the floor,\u201d Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. \u201cAnd it felt like it did.\u201d The Celtics confined most of their Saturday plans to a film session; the Heat were doing the same along with some optional workouts. Heat center Bam Adebayo, who blamed himself for the Game 5 loss despite teammates saying otherwise, said he would spend some of Saturday on the floor looking for answers. \u201cThis team has good resolve,\u201d Celtics coach Brad Stevens said Saturday. \u201cI thought we showed that last night. We\u2019ll have to continue to show the ability to be able to handle good and bad throughout a game.\u201d Even though the disappointment was clear Friday night, the Heat still understand where they are: a No. 5 seed, one that didn\u2019t even make the playoffs last season, one win from the NBA Finals. Miami needed two tries before ousting Milwaukee in the second round, saying then it learned at what level a team needs to be to win a closeout game. The Celtics provided them another reminder of that Friday night, when they outscored Miami 70-50 after halftime and erased a 12-point second-quarter deficit. \u201cAs you go on, the wins get harder and harder,\u201d Heat guard Duncan Robinson said. \u201cAnd doing what we want to do and advancing from this round is going to be the hardest thing we\u2019ve done all season and our in our athletic careers for many of us. Fortunately, we have coaches and guys that have been there and know what it takes. \u201cBut this is certainly a reminder \u2014 to think that we were just going to have a good first half and just kind of coast to a victory in this stage of the playoffs, we\u2019re misguided for thinking that.\u201d Some of what to know going into Sunday: Miami is 55-32 this season, and 18 of those losses have come in games where the Heat held a double-digit lead. Boston has beaten Miami four times this season, rallying from at least 11 points down in three of those games \u2014 including a pair of 12-point comebacks in this series. Miami has lost games this year where it led by 10 points once, 11 (four times), 12 (five times), 13 (once), 14 (twice), 15 (once), 20 (once), 22 (twice) and 23 (once). For whatever reason, 31.1% is the magic number for Heat 3-pointers this season. When the Heat shoot 31.1% or worse from beyond the arc, they\u2019re 2-17 (.105). When they shoot better than that, they\u2019re 53-15 (.779). Centers Daniel Theis and Enes Kanter gave Boston some big-time numbers in Game 5. Theis played all but 39 seconds of the second half, more time on the floor after halftime than any other Celtic and finished the game with 15 points and 13 rebounds. Kanter added eight points and four rebounds in 10 minutes. Friday\u2019s game featured three players \u2014 Bam Adebayo and Jimmy Butler for Miami, Marcus Smart for Boston \u2014 finishing with eight rebounds and eight assists. It was the first time a playoff game had three players reach at least eight rebounds and eight assists since April 28, 2005, when Vince Carter and Jason Kidd did it for New Jersey and Dwyane Wade did it for Miami. That Nets-Heat game went double overtime. It hadn\u2019t happened in a regulation playoff game since April 10, 1969, when Walt Frazier did it for New York and John Havlicek and Bill Russell did it for Boston. The Celtics scored 103 points in the final three quarters of Game 5. That tied for the fourth-best total in the final 36 minutes of regulation that they\u2019ve had this season \u2014 and was the most they scored in the final three quarters of a playoff game since June 17, 2008, when they blew out the Los Angeles Lakers for the clinching win in that season\u2019s NBA Finals."},{"id":2978,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/film-study-boston-celtics-miami-heat-game-5-daniel-theis","date":"2020-09-26","title":"Film Study: Bigs help Celtics get back to the rim in Game 5","content":" Down three games to one in the Eastern Conference finals , the Boston Celtics were in a desperate situation on Friday. And with his team having scored just twice on its first seven possessions, head coach Brad Stevens didn\u2019t hesitate to replace starting center Daniel Theis with Gordon Hayward less than four minutes into Game 5. If this was the last game of the Celtics\u2019 season, they were going to go out with their best five guys on the floor for heavy minutes. Except that didn\u2019t happen. That group was on the floor for less than three minutes (in which it was outscored by six points ), and Game 5 wasn\u2019t the last of the Celtics\u2019 season. Boston\u2019s best-five lineup struggled, but the Celtics\u2019 centers \u2014 Theis and Enes Kanter \u2014 played big roles in a 121-108 victory over the Miami Heat that forced a Game 6 on Sunday ( 7:30 p.m. ET, ESPN ). This win didn\u2019t play out the same as the Celtics\u2019 win in Game 3, a wire-to-wire victory in which the Heat struggled offensively at the start. Boston trailed Game 5 by as many as 12 points in each of the first two periods . But after the Celtics turned things around with a 41-25 third quarter and put the Heat away with a similarly efficient fourth, some key numbers looked a lot like they did in that win last Saturday. First, the Celtics\u2019 two wins have been the two fastest-paced games of the series . And second, the two wins have come with 60 and 56 points in the paint , respectively. Those two things are not unrelated. Game 5 was the Celtics\u2019 most efficient offensive performance (121 points on 102 possessions) since Game 2 of the first round , which is pretty remarkable given how the first seven minutes went. After scoring five points on their first 14 possessions of the game (trying the best-five lineup and then quickly giving up on it), the Celtics scored 116 points on 88 possessions (a rate of 132 per 100) thereafter. They really flipped the game around with five minutes of great defense at the start of the third quarter, but their offense had been doing pretty well already. It has been noted often in this space that early offense is good offense. This season, league-wide effective field goal percentage was 60% in the first six seconds of the shot clock, 53% in the middle 12 seconds, and just 44% in the last six seconds, according to Second Spectrum tracking. Transition offense was key for the Heat in Game 1 , but they\u2019ve slowed down since then. The Celtics, meanwhile, have sped up. After totaling 17 shots in the first six seconds of the shot clock over the first two games, the Celtics have averaged 17 over the last three. Game 5 came with 12 buckets on 20 shots (the most for either team in the series) in the first six seconds. Some of those (including the Jayson Tatum and-one that really put the game away) were easy fast breaks off live-ball turnovers. But the Celtics also pushed off of both missed and made shots, taking advantage of a Miami defense that was too often too slow to match up. Here are some examples\u2026 Play 1: The Celtics start slow after a Jae Crowder miss, but there\u2019s only one defender in front of Marcus Smart and Jaylen Brown running up the right side of the floor. So Tatum passes ahead and Smart gets around Duncan Robinson. Play 2: There\u2019s some pointing, but the Heat actually don\u2019t match up after a make and Kemba Walker passes ahead to Brown for a dunk. Play 3: The Celtics don\u2019t seem to have numbers after this live-ball turnover, but Brown just blows by Robinson down the right side. Play 4: Again, the Celtics don\u2019t have numbers. But Walker gets the ball into the frontcourt quickly, Robinson has to pick him up, and he draws a foul on an early-iso drive. Play 5: After a Smart rebound, Walker has the ball at mid-court with 22 on the shot clock, and Brown is again racing down the right side to give the Celtics their first lead of the game. Play 6: The Heat have bodies in front of Walker after he pushes off a rebound. But again, there\u2019s only one guy guarding two on the right side, and Walker slings a pass to a wide-open Tatum. After playing 46 possessions of zone two nights earlier, the Heat didn\u2019t use it on Friday until the Celtics were taking the ball out of bounds with 9:14 to go in the third quarter. Earlier in the series, there was a working theory that Hayward\u2019s return would allow Boston to play small and skilled against the zone. But Theis was a key factor, both with and without the ball, as the Celtics had their best performance against the zone in Game 5. Shots from 10-14 feet accounted for just 28 (7%) of Theis\u2019 426 field goal attempts in the regular season. But he made half of those 28 shots and on that first zone possession on Friday, he didn\u2019t hesitate to shoot from just inside the free-throw line. Here are some examples of Theis helping the Celtics bust the Miami zone\u2026 Play 1: On that first zone possession, Walker swings the ball to Smart and gets screens from both Theis (screening Crowder) and Tatum (screening Robinson). Both defenders fight through the screens to get out to Walker, who is 28 feet from the basket without the ball. That leaves Theis wide open at the free-throw line and he drains the jumper. Play 2: With Walker dribbling up the left side of the floor, Theis sets a high and early screen on the inside of Jimmy Butler, allowing Walker to step into a pull-up jumper from the foul line. Play 3: Theis is a little slower with this screen, but he changes the angle (back to the baseline) and Walker steps into a pull-up 3. Play 4: After setting another inside screen for Smart, Theis rolls into the middle of the paint. Both Andre Iguodala and Bam Adebayo are in the vicinity on the catch, but when Theis pivots, Iguodala retreats to Smart, and Adebayo clears the paint. So Theis dribbles back into the paint and lofts a floater before Adebayo can get back. The Celtics have still been a little less efficient against the zone (1.11 points per possession) than they\u2019ve been otherwise (1.16). They get to the basket and get fouled more against man-to-man. But that \u201cotherwise\u201d number includes transition possessions and would be lower if we isolated half-court possessions against man. None of Boston\u2019s eight shots against the zone on Friday were layups or dunks. But those 14 points on nine possessions took Miami out of the it. And when the Heat went back to man-to-man, the Celtics took Adebayo away from the basket. The Celtics\u2019 21 restricted-area buckets in Game 3 came mostly with Adebayo on the perimeter. The Celtics often got Adebayo to switch onto their guards, and then they attacked elsewhere , with the Heat\u2019s big man not in position to protect the rim. Game 5 (20 restricted area buckets) was similar, except there was more of the Celtics\u2019 big men taking advantage of the ensuing mismatches after an Adebayo switch. Here are some examples\u2026 Play 1: Adebayo switches a Kanter screen for Walker, so Kanter takes Butler into the post and gets a point-blank jump hook. Play 2: Theis sets another one of those high-and-early screens for Tatum. Adebayo switches it, and Theis takes Butler into the post. A Walker screen temporarily gets Adebayo off of Tatum who misses a deep 3. Theis gets rebounding position on Butler and follows up the miss. Play 3: Another high-and-early screen for Walker gets the same switch. Hayward misses a jumper, but Theis taps out the miss, ducks in against Butler, and draws a foul. Play 4: Another Adebayo switch allows Theis to box out Iguodala, who commits both a loose-ball foul and a technical foul on the rebound. This is kind of the opposite of the Toronto-Boston series, where both teams were continually trying to figure out how to score against the other. After the Celtics and Raptors combined to score just 103.3 points per 100 possessions in the conference semis, the Celtics and Heat have combined to score 113.4 per 100 in this series. After Game 4, it appeared that Boston wasn\u2019t sure how to defend Miami\u2019s pick-and-rolls and dribble hand-offs . But the Cs did away with trapping Butler, came with much better ball pressure, and didn\u2019t once allow Adebayo to roll all the way to the rim in Game 5. And now, it seems the Heat have to figure out how they want to defend the Celtics. After that Kanter post-up vs. Butler in the second quarter, we actually saw Adebayo in \u201cdrop\u201d coverage, allowing Walker to step into a pull-up 3 . And Theis and Kanter didn\u2019t just punish switches. Kanter had a roll-man layup in that second-quarter, while Theis opened up a pair of second-half 3s ( one , two ) by pulling a defender into the paint when he rolled to the rim. The Heat have shot just 30.1% from 3-point range in the series, while the Celtics have shot worse from beyond the arc in their two wins than they have in their three losses . The story of the two wins has been their ability to get to the basket. The zone is the best way to keep Adebayo protected, but (though it produced 11 of Boston\u2019s 19 turnovers in Game 5) Game 2 was the only game in which the Celtics really struggled against it. Preventing layups and dunks starts in transition (better focus and communication can clean up some of the issues in the transition examples above), but there are still some questions to be answered with Miami\u2019s half-court defense. Game 6 on Sunday (7:30 p.m. ET, ESPN) is both an opportunity to answer those questions and another chance to reach The Finals. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

Things didn\u2019t go well Friday night. And Adebayo wanted \u2014 demanded, really \u2014 all the blame. His stat line \u2014 13 points, eight rebounds, eight assists on 5-for-11 shooting \u2014 certainly didn\u2019t look as abysmal as Adebayo made his effort sound after Game 5 of the Eastern Conference finals, when Miami fell apart in the third quarter and saw its series lead trimmed to 3-2 after a 121-108 loss to the Boston Celtics. But he didn\u2019t like much of anything about his night and headed back to the hotel following the game vowing that he would find a way to be better in Game 6 on Sunday. \u201cI put that game on me,\u201d Adebayo said. \u201cIt\u2019s not my teammates\u2019 fault, it\u2019s not my coaches\u2019 fault. It\u2019s me. I missed too many shots I should have made. Put that one on me.\u201d No matter what the subject matter was within the handful of questions he took postgame, he usually found a way to turn the finger of blame toward himself. On Miami giving up 41 points in the third quarter: \u201cI wasn\u2019t being the defensive anchor that I should have been. I don\u2019t think I was communicating fast enough. I felt like I was a step behind today.\u201d On not adjusting when Boston would change lineups: \u201cI didn\u2019t get some fast enough triggers and that\u2019s on me.\u201d On what has to change before Game 6 on Sunday: \u201cI\u2019ve got to be better. \u2026 This game is on me. I played terrible and that can\u2019t happen. And I know that, and I feel like I let my teammates down.\u201d He wasn\u2019t yelling or screaming, merely giving the answers in his usual conversational tone. But it was still an unusual approach for Adebayo, the breakout third-year center who became an All-Star for the first time this season, won the skills competition at All-Star weekend, nearly won the NBA\u2019s Most Improved Player award and made the All-Defensive team. Heat forward Jimmy Butler said he appreciated Adebayo trying to take the blame \u2014 but simply refused to put it all on his shoulders. \u201cIt\u2019s on everybody,\u201d Butler said. \u201cHe does so much for us that it can feel like that at times but it\u2019s definitely not on him. It\u2019s on us as a whole. We all understand that because nobody was playing the way that we are supposed to play; the way that we have to play in order for us to win, nobody. And for him to say that, I respect it. I love him for it. But he can\u2019t do it by himself. We\u2019ve got to be there with him.\u201d Adebayo has logged more minutes in the postseason than anyone on the Heat, is third behind Goran Dragic (21.4) and Butler (20.6) in scoring at 17.5 per game, and he\u2019s grabbed nearly as many rebounds as any other two Miami players combined. Adebayo has 157 rebounds; Butler and Jae Crowder, Miami\u2019s second- and third-leading rebounders in the playoffs, have teamed up to grab 164. He said his Saturday would include plenty of film and then some time on the court, all with hopes of finding whatever answer he\u2019s seeking before Game 6 \u2014 and a second chance to clinch a spot in the NBA Finals. \u201cEastern Conference finals, this ain\u2019t easy to let go,\u201d Adebayo said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve got 24 hours to get over it. Next, it\u2019s go time.\u201d"},{"id":25550,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/heat-celtics-game-5-analysis","date":"2020-09-26","title":"Walker's halftime speech settles Celtics, who respond with series-saving run","content":" Twice in the afterglow of his team\u2019s 121-108 victory over Miami to fend off elimination Friday in Game 5, Boston coach Brad Stevens stepped into the way-back machine and dialed in \u201c1 Year, 0 days.\u201d It was a full year ago, Stevens was saying, that the Celtics gathered for their first workout in advance of this endless 2019-20 NBA season. That\u2019s when they started from the ground up, emphasizing and drilling through repetition some pretty fundamental stuff, as far as playing the way Stevens wants his teams to play. Like contesting shots. Attacking the rim. Turning defense into offense, preferably at a revved-up pace in transition. So when he mentioned Sept. 26, 2019 \u2014 not once but twice \u2014 Stevens\u2019 implication was that people should notice when the Celtics don\u2019t do important things like that, rather than when they do in win-or-burst-the-bubble tests such as Friday. \u201c[Defense] is a huge emphasis for us, not only to stop the ball but [to] fire out and play with multiple efforts and challenge shots,\u201d the Boston coach said. \u201cAll this stuff is kind of back to the basics. We need to be better, again, in Game 6.\u201d > Game 6: Celtics vs. Heat, Sunday 7:30 ET on ESPN That comes Sunday, again on the Disney campus in central Florida (ESPN, 6:30 ET). But the Celtics had their hands full in Game 5, when their long season and postseason had drawn within 24 minutes of completion. Down 3-1 in the series, they trailed after the first half 58-51. They weren\u2019t just losing, they were being dispatched. At no point in the first two quarters had the Celtics led. They had fallen behind almost instantly, trailing 17-5 in the early minutes. The Heat had them in rebounds, fast-break points, second-chance scoring and a seven-point advantage from the line that accounted for the margin at the break. The Celtics weren\u2019t quite trudging to the gallows \u2013 they were energetic yet not efficient \u2013 but that\u2019s where they surely seemed headed. Then came halftime, when Stevens challenged them and then yielded to the team\u2019s leaders. Point guard Kemba Walker in particular piped up. \u201cWhat I remember of halftime is Kemba saying we just need to settle down a little bit,\u201d forward Jaylen Brown said. \u201cWe all felt the intensity that we all had in the beginning. I don\u2019t think we came out flat. It was different from Game 4. We had the intensity. It was just kind of a little bit all over the place. We had to dial in a little bit.\u201d Boston dialed in a lot, playing their best stretch of basketball at least in the past two series and arguably in the bubble overall. It was 60-51 when Brown stole the ball from Miami\u2019s Bam Adebayo and, on a feed from Walker, finished at the other end. Then Marcus Smart got the ball away from Goran Dragic. No score after that one, but there was a newfound aggressiveness in the Celtics\u2019 defense. Over a span of 4:46 \u2013 from 10:25 of the third to 5:39, when coach Erik Spoelstra burned his second timeout of the quarter \u2013 the Heat made only one of nine field-goal attempts, six of which were 3-pointers. Meanwhile, Boston was pushing into the paint, going to center Daniel Theis in the heart of Miami\u2019s defense. The 6-foot-8 native of Salzgitter, Germany, in his third NBA season at 28, contributed six points, two offensive rebounds and a couple of blocks while playing all but 39 seconds of the quarter. Theis had been averaging 6.5 points and 0.5 blocks per game through the series\u2019 first four games. After being a cumulative minus-9 in those games, Theis was plus-16 Friday, behind only Walker\u2019s plus-21. Jayson Tatum, whose lights flickered on after halftime in Game 4, caught a spark again. His 10 points in the first two quarters were up to 27 by the end of the third. Walker stayed feisty despite lugging around three, then four personal fouls. Boston controlled the boards (16-5) in the quarter, and got into the bonus early to turn around the free-throw deficit. During that same 4:46 span, the Celtics hit 7-of-10 shots and added four foul shots. They finally tied it 60-60, then took their first lead 24 seconds later after a Miami timeout. When Tatum caught a slick cross-court fling from Walker on the right wing and drained a three, Spoelstra huddled up again. It was 71-63, a 20-3 run that defined the game, and Boston never trailed again. The Heat, while respecting Boston\u2019s ability to turn the urgency of elimination into production at both ends, owned the failure. \u201cThey started attacking. We stopped guarding,\u201d Jimmy Butler said. \u201cNever, never a good thing for us. \u201cNobody was playing the way that we are supposed to play, the way that we have to play in order for us to win. Nobody.\u201d Boston did just that with its back-to-the-basics shifting of gears out of halftime. Through their first 15 games in these playoffs, the Celtics\u2019 greatest trouble had come in third quarters; they were getting outscored by an average of 1.6 points in that period, vs. a scoring edge in the other three. Then they come up with a 41-25 game-breaker.  \u201cWe looked like the team that we all know and love,\u201d Brown said.

Anthony Davis is on the verge of his first. The final step for the Los Angeles Lakers shapes up as the toughest. They have to knock out the Denver Nuggets, who have been on the brink of dismissal from the bubble six times and every time refused to go. \u201cYou can never be comfortable around this team,\u201d Davis said. \u201cThey have been in this situation twice. We\u2019ve been in the situation twice. But both teams are familiar with these situations, but this team is not going to go away.\u201d Game 5 is Saturday. The Lakers have ended both their series thus far in five games. But the Nuggets were also down 3-1 against both Utah and the Los Angeles Clippers, fell far behind in Game 5, and then battled back to not only win the game but eventually the series. No team had ever erased two 3-1 deficits in one postseason and now the Nuggets need to do it a third time. It\u2019s a predicament they could have avoided, if they\u2019d gotten one more defensive stop in Game 2 or given up a few less second-chance points in Game 4. \u201cThese are all close games we\u2019re playing,\u201d guard Jamal Murray said. \u201cGoing to keep battling it out.\u201d Murray was sensational again in Game 4, though James slowed him enough down the stretch after taking on the defensive assignment to help the Lakers pull out a 114-108 victory. One more win, and James ties NBA career scoring leader Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for third on the career list with 10 NBA Finals appearances. Only Hall of Famers Bill Russell (12) and Sam Jones (11) of the Boston Celtics have gone to more. It would be James\u2019 first with the Lakers after five appearances in Cleveland and four in Miami, and the Lakers\u2019 first trip to the finals since winning the last of their 16 championships in 2010. James and Davis have been the unquestioned catalysts of this run, and they\u2019re good strong support from some playoff-tested veterans. Dwight Howard had 12 points and 11 rebounds Thursday in his first start of this postseason, helping send Los Angeles to its overwhelming 25-6 advantage in second-chance points. Rajon Rondo contributed 11 points and moved into eighth place on the career list with seven more assists. \u201cIn the postseason, every possession is so important,\u201d James said. \u201cWhen you can have guys that have been in the moments and can understand and also be able to make adjustments on the fly, and know that you can count on them down the stretch, it just makes the team and you individually feel so much more confident in the outcome.\u201d The younger Nuggets don\u2019t have those type of veterans, but they have the experience of this historic postseason run that could have ended on Aug. 25, the night of Game 5 against Utah. A month later, they are still at Disney World, still trying to prove that hope is not lost until four games are. \u201cI think people out there probably think this is exactly where we want them. It\u2019s not. We would much rather be up 3-1, but it is what it is. We put ourselves in this position,\u201d Denver coach Michael Malone said. \u201cOur team has shown tremendous resiliency and grit in getting out of these before. I have no doubt that tomorrow night we\u2019ll bring that same fight to the game and hopefully we can keep this series alive.\u201d If they do, Game 6 would be Monday night. If not, the Lakers will be preparing to face Miami, in its first appearance since James left in 2014, or the Celtics, their greatest rival they could tie with a 17th NBA title. The Lakers won\u2019t think about any of that until the Nuggets are finally gone. \u201cLike I said last game, we\u2019ve got to put them away,\u201d Davis said. \u201cThey are going to continue to fight, no matter what the score is, no matter what the situation is. We just have to make sure we counter everything they do.\u201d"},{"id":25539,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/jazz-add-keyon-dooling-dell-demps-assistants","date":"2020-09-25","title":"Jazz add Dell Demps, Keyon Dooling to coaching staff","content":" The Utah Jazz announced today that the team has added Dell Demps and Keyon Dooling to its coaching staff. \u201cI was fortunate to work with Dell to begin my career as a head coach in professional basketball and I know he will delve into his role on the bench,\u201d said Head Coach Quin Snyder.\u201c He has an incredible work ethic and commitment to his craft.

This isn\u2019t where the Nuggets wanted to be, even after earning the designation of being the first team in NBA playoff history to bounce back from multiple 3-1 deficits to capture series victories in the same postseason. Denver coach Michael Malone made that clear Friday in the aftermath of his team\u2019s 114-108 loss in Game 4. \u201cI think people out there probably think this is exactly where we want them,\u201d Malone said. \u201cIt\u2019s not. We\u2019d much rather be up 3-1. We\u2019ve put ourselves in this position, and our team has shown tremendous resiliency and grit in getting out of these before. I have no doubt that we\u2019ll bring the same fight to (Game 5 on Saturday). Hopefully, we can keep this series alive.\u201d It\u2019s a daunting task, to be sure. So, it came as no surprise minutes after Game 4 when Denver announced it wouldn\u2019t be conducting a practice on Friday. That\u2019s precisely how the Nuggets handled rebounding from 3-1 series deficits to Utah and the L.A. Clippers in the first two rounds of the playoffs. Denver decided to take a step back, so it could move forward. It\u2019s well-documented that Anthony Davis (34 points) and LeBron James (26 points, eight assists) did their part to help the Lakers improve to 18-1 this season when the duo combines for 60 points or more. But the Lakers also demolished Denver on the glass, taking a 12-6 advantage in offensive rebounding, which allowed them to outscore the Nuggets 25-6 in second-chance points. Veteran Dwight Howard played a major role in that, setting the tone for the Lakers starting opposite Denver big man Nikola Jokic, by grabbing eight boards in the first period, while contributing eight points on 4-of-4 shooting. \u201cDwight Howard dominated the first quarter,\u201d Malone said. \u201cWhen the shot goes up, we have to be a lot more physical. We\u2019ve gotten caught ball-watching, or we\u2019ve been engaged, but just not with the requisite amount of energy and fight.\u201d He continued, \u201cGoing into this series, we talked about two things over and over again: It was transition defense, and rebounding. I think the rebounding has a lot to do with not just last night, but this series overall.\u201d So, when the Nuggets woke up Friday morning, Malone would have loved to have taken his squad to the practice court for some rebounding drills. But the coach also realizes, \u201cthat\u2019s just not realistic,\u201d considering the grind of playing games every other night. Instead, Malone chose to \u201creview, reflect (and) communicate with our guys,\u201d he said. That\u2019s a process that started as soon as Malone arrived back at his hotel room after Thursday\u2019s loss. Malone called his wife, Jocelyn, to wish her a happy anniversary, and then wished a happy birthday to one of his two daughters, who celebrated the occasion on Friday, before he changed clothes and turned on the film of Game 4. Malone turned in for the night at approximately 4 a.m. As soon as he woke back up, Malone starting poring over all of his notes and clips from Game 4, before jotting down even more notes to discuss heading into Game 5. \u201cYou meet with your staff. You talk about what they saw, where we can be better,\u201d Malone said. \u201cThen, you address that with your team. You show the clips, and you talk about it. There\u2019s not a lot you can do physically on a day like this. So, a lot of this now is just so much more mental.\u201d It\u2019s an approach that worked for Denver over the last two series, and for Malone this current 3-1 deficit feels no different than the last two. \u201cWe\u2019ve been here twice, and we\u2019ve answered the call, if you will,\u201d Malone said. \u201cTo be honest, I think in the second round against the Clippers, the Clippers were the odds-on favorite to win the whole thing ahead of the Lakers. So, Clippers, great team. Lakers, great team. We\u2019re down 3-1 again, unfortunately.\u201d This time, they\u2019re facing a Lakers squad that owns a record of 10-1 in Games 2 through 5 this postseason, led by a 17-year vet in James that has never lost a series with his team ahead 3-1. Los Angeles is 2-0 in close-out games this postseason, having knocked off both Portland and Houston in fewer than seven games. During Los Angeles\u2019 film session Friday, the Lakers zeroed in on improvements they can make defensively for Game 5. Described as \u201cspecial\u201d by James, who guarded him late in Game 4, Jamal Murray has already put together four 40-point games this postseason and lit up the Lakers on Thursday for 32 points and eight assists. The Nuggets are 4-2 this postseason when Murray scores 30 points or more. Coming off an off night in Game 4 due to foul trouble, Jokic has put together 14 games these past two postseasons in which he\u2019s scored at least 20 points to go with 10 rebounds and five assists . \u201c(There are) a lot of areas we can still improve and have to improve if we expect to win this series,\u201d Lakers coach Frank Vogel said. \u201cOur group\u2019s demeanor in all of these playoff games has been (to) treat every one like a must-win. I would say that same mindset has applied to the close-out games we had against Houston and Portland. We know that those are always the most difficult wins to get in a series. We expect this to be no different.\u201d It\u2019s an opportunity Los Angeles wants to make sure it doesn\u2019t squander. Howard (12 points, 11 rebounds) pieced together his first postseason double-double since April of 2017, and before this season, he hadn\u2019t advanced beyond the first round since 2015. So, for many, these opportunities don\u2019t come often, which is why Howard knows exactly what Los Angeles faces on Saturday in Game 5. \u201cThey\u2019re gonna give us their best shot,\u201d Howard said. \u201cWe understand that. We\u2019re one step closer to our dreams. So, we\u2019re not gonna let our foot off the gas. I think we\u2019re going to bring more intensity than we brought before. We understand how important this series is, and this game. We should treat it like a Game 7 with our intensity and our effort.\u201d  * * * Michael C. Wright is a senior writer for NBA.com.

He was the most dominant big man in the league back then, the face of the Orlando Magic and considered by most the best big man in basketball. His profile has changed dramatically over the years, but there he was Thursday night at AdventHeath Arena, manning the middle for the Los Angeles Lakers as they moved to within a game of making it to The Finals with a 114-108 win over the Denver Nuggets. There are plenty of reasons the Lakers lead this series 3-1 with a chance to close it out Saturday night in Game 5. Anthony Davis (34 points, 5 rebounds) dominated early, played through the pain of a nasty sprained ankle and finished strong. LeBron James was masterful on both ends, stepping up on defense down the stretch, locking down Nuggets scoring machine Jamal Murray. > Game 5: Nuggets vs. Lakers, Saturday at 8:30 ET on ESPN But it was Howard\u2019s energy and activity early \u2014 he started Game 4 opposite All-NBA center Nikola Jokic \u2014 that made the difference for the Lakers. After not playing in the conference semifinal matchup against Houston\u2019s small-ball attack, Howard has turned into a key piece of the jumbo package frontline Lakers coach Frank Vogel deployed from the tip Thursday night. HIs offensive rebounding and physicality on Jokic helped set the tone for the Lakers, who still had to survive the Nuggets until the final minute. \u201cDwight was a beast,\u201d James said. \u201c[He] gave us opportunities when we missed shots, which as a team, we missed a couple. AD didn\u2019t miss any, but as a team, when we missed a couple shots, he was cleaning glass both offensively and defensively. Got us put-backs and was able to control the paint. We know we got smashed in the rebounding category in Game 3, so we wanted to do a better job in that. Dwight brought that physical presence. It was great for our ballclub.\u201d The Lakers are the only team still alive playing with the sort of supersized expectations they brought with them to the bubble. Howard, like both James and Davis, was the No. 1 overall pick in his Draft class and is destined for the Naismith Memorial Basketball of Fame some day. He played like someone who comprehends this moment, even if he has been a role-playing reserve this season. His 12 points and 11 rebounds served as his first playoff double-double since 2017. The Lakers held a 12-6 edge on the offensive glass and piled up 25 second-chance points to the Nuggets\u2019 six. Davis certainly appreciated the boost Howard provided, especially after the Lakers were pounded on the glass in their Game 3 loss to the Nuggets. \u201cDwight\u2019s impact this entire series has been very helpful for us,\u201d Davis said. \u201cFirst half, he has six offensive rebounds. His body language with Jokic, just being a pest and taking on that challenge. I mean, like I say, for a guy not to play the last series and come in and have huge impact, he stayed ready. Got the start tonight and been playing well for us.\u201d Lakers coach Frank Vogel didn\u2019t deliberate long about swapping Howard into the first five in place of JaVale McGee. Howard\u2019s ability to bother Jokic was evident in the minutes he played previously. His impact was unmistakable. \u201cDwight just brings energy, you know what I mean?,\u201d Vogel said. \u201cHe fits what we want to embody in terms of being a team that plays harder than our opponent every night. He plays extremely hard and extremely physical. [He] really set a great tone for us tonight.\u201d Jokic never recovered from the physicality Howard applied early, struggling through a 16-point, seven-rebound, four-assist night after getting in foul trouble early. Murray was the Lakers\u2019 biggest problem (32 points, eight assists), given his hot start kept the Nuggets from being run out off the court due to a 7-for-7 shooting start from Davis. But in the final five minutes, James shifted over to guard the Nuggets\u2019 scoring wiz. The All-NBA length, strength and timing James provides proved crucial as the Lakers\u2019 got critical stops to seal the win. \u201cLeBron asked for the assignment and obviously I granted it,\u201d Vogel said. \u201cHe did a great job down the stretch trying to contain him 1-on-1. Murray had a great night. Nothing was really working in terms of trying to slow him down until LeBron took that assignment. Game ball to him, I guess, for that move.\u201d It was the sort of move you\u2019d expect from a 17-year veteran and three-time champion who knows when it\u2019s time to take over. \u201cI knew it was winning time, and Jamal had it going,\u201d James said. \u201cThe kid is special. He has an array of shots. Triple-threat from the three, mid-range and also in the paint. For me, it\u2019s just trusting my defensive keys. Trusting my study of film. Trusting personnel. And living with the results. I told my teammates that I had him and everyone else can kind of stay at bay and stay home. I was able to get a couple stops and we were able to rebound the basketball, which is the most important thing.\u201d Finishing these Nuggets off becomes the most important thing for the Lakers. And that\u2019s a task the Utah Jazz and LA Clippers failed to do in the previous two rounds, each having held (and lost) 3-1 series leads. The Nuggets are the first team in NBA playoff history to rebound from multiple 3-1 deficits and win in the same postseason. They\u2019ve been at their most dangerous and best with their season on the line. \u201cOf course. They have done it twice this year. They are extremely difficult to play against on both sides of the ball,\u201d Vogel said. \u201cThey are well-coached defensively. They have great speed and physicality. Obviously, Jamal and the Joker are just playing at an extremely high level offensively, as is their supporting cast. The bench has been fantastic. Great respect for this team and definitely know that we have a lot of work to do to finish this series.\u201d The Lakers also have to make sure Davis is healthy and ready to go. He played through the pain Thursday night. And if Howard is going to get a chance to finish off his storybook ending to his Orlando experience in The Finals, the Lakers will need Davis to play through whatever discomfort remains heading in Saturday night. \u201cYou can never be comfortable around this team,\u201d Davis said. \u201cThey have been in this situation twice. We\u2019ve been in the situation twice. But both teams are familiar with these situations, but this team is not going to go away. Like I said last game, we\u2019ve got to put them away. They are going to continue to fight, no matter what the score is, no matter what the situation is, we just have to make sure we counter everything they do.\u201d * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

The third time\u2019s a harm? The Nuggets have resumed the position, trapped once again in that gloomy, win-win-win-or-else situation, where they must find the right formula to scramble back into a best-of-seven series in which they trail 3-1. It worked against the Jazz in the first round . It worked against the LA Clippers in the Western Conference semifinals .. History and a very big Lakers team indicate it won\u2019t work again. > Game 5: Nuggets vs. Lakers, Saturday at 8:30 ET on ESPN Pardon the expression, but the Nuggets literally face a tall order against the Lakers in these Western Conference finals , and a nearly impossible one, if only because basketball logic says a team can only have so many lives in the playoffs. And this is now 18 games and counting for the Nuggets, who have labored the longest of any team on campus. Oh, and LeBron James is one win away from reaching The Finals for the 10th time, which brings us to the list the reasons why the Nuggets, barring an unforeseen event, have most likely reached the end of the road: Well, duh. They\u2019re bringing lots of height, and you thought Denver had altitude. No, actually, the Nuggets measure up short as projected against 6-foot-8 LeBron and 6-foot-10 Anthony Davis and 6-foot-11 Dwight Howard, all of whom have left fingerprints on this series and in the painted area. This size manifested itself in Game 4 when the Lakers came back again. And again. And again. All those second-chance points (25, actually) off 12 offensive rebounds (Denver had only six) simply wore down Denver and was clearly the difference in yet another close game. \u201cWe did a poor job in that area,\u201d said Nuggets coach Michael Malone. There\u2019s little reason to believe the Nuggets will grow taller overnight. Their only hope is to develop a better hunger for boxing out and more aggressiveness at the rim like they did in Game 3. But Lakers coach Frank Vogel\u2019s decision to start Howard was a game-changer. He\u2019s a downright pest on the block on both ends. Now, don\u2019t get it twisted; Jokic is still playing at a lofty level. But in multiple games now he\u2019s had to dance around foul trouble, and the reason for that is simple enough. Unlike the Clippers\u2019 series \u2014 and for most of the Utah series as well \u2014 Jokic didn\u2019t have to guard anyone. Neither of those teams offered up an offensive-minded big man who could force Jokic to spend energy and fouls on him. That\u2019s not the case against the Lakers. Jokic must actually play defense. He has to guard Davis, and at times LeBron when there\u2019s a switch, and even Howard, who\u2019s being very physical and at times succeeding in goading Jokic into cheap fouls. What this means is Jokic is burning the candle at both ends, and you wonder how much of this is sapping his offense or willingness to mix it up for rebounds and risk getting whistled for fouls. There are times when he doesn\u2019t even bother positing up, electing to settle for jumpers. Not a good sign for Denver. Murray dismissed any notion that he\u2019s running out of steam, saying: \u201cI\u2019m 23 years old, I\u2019m healthy, got a lot of gas left in the tank.\u201d If you saw those body-contorting shots he made Thursday, you\u2019d have to agree. Once again, Murray is raising hell for the man assigned to him, although LeBron managed to swat a few of his shots in the fourth quarter when Murray \u2014 foolishly? \u2014 tried to challenge a bigger player a few times too often. Still, Murray is averaging roughly 42 minutes a night over the last three games, and there\u2019s only one day\u2019s rest between games. At some point, doesn\u2019t this catch up to a player, especially after a long playoff run? \u201cI\u2019m running the poor kid into the ground,\u201d Malone said. \u201cBut when I take him out, things go sideways for us. He\u2019s a tough kid and we\u2019ll continue to ride him.\u201d Paul Millsap seems to grow a year older every game. Too often he\u2019s turning the ball over, passing up shots, getting his shot blocked, or simply not making much of an impact. He had five points and five fouls Thursday and Malone had to keep him on the bench, playing him just 17 minutes. Mason Plumlee is Mason Plumlee. When Jokic takes a breather, the Nuggets suffer from Plumlee\u2019s inability to do anything offensively unless he\u2019s right at the rim. And his decisions on defense haven\u2019t improved greatly since the Invisible Screen in Game 2 . Gary Harris is vapor; he scored three points and missed 4-of-5 shots, just a total non-factor not only in Game 4 but also throughout this series. Other than Jerami Grant and Monte Morris and an occasional burst from Michael Porter Jr. \u2014 whose lax defense often costs the Nuggets \u2014 Denver can\u2019t find much support. \u201cIf you can\u2019t help on the defensive end, you shouldn\u2019t be on the floor,\u201d Malone said. Rajon Rondo is giving the Lakers an extra playmaker and relieving LeBron of constantly being charged with that duty. This is what the Lakers wanted to see from their veteran guard, and he\u2019s delivering. How many times has Rondo tossed a lob pass or bounce pass that led to buckets \u2014 he had seven assists Thursday \u2014 or simply made the right decision at the right time? All of this adds up to sobering mathematics for Denver\u2019s odds of rallying in these playoffs for a third straight time. That\u2019s never been done in a single playoff season by a team, and there\u2019s little reason for that reality to suddenly change now. Murray mentioned how the Nuggets, with few exceptions, have been involved in close games throughout the playoffs, and added: \u201cWe just got to give ourselves a chance.\u201d Well, they better hope those chances aren\u2019t finally running out. \u201cWe have a tough and resilient group,\u201d Malone said. No question. But this time, do they have the better group in this series? * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

Things sure changed in a hurry. \u201cI wasn\u2019t looking at anything,\u201d Donovan said. \u201cIt was five great years in Oklahoma City. I think it\u2019s always emotional when you leave a place that you enjoyed working with the people you were working with. I was around some terrific people in the organization, tremendous players. You\u2019re just kind of decompressing. So this kind of came out of left field for me.\u201d The Bulls introduced Donovan as their coach on Thursday, two days after they announced they landed arguably the most attractive candidate on the market to help turn around a struggling team with new management. Donovan goes from working with stars such as Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook and Paul George and Chris Paul to trying to lift a franchise with one playoff appearance in five seasons. He was 243-157 with the Thunder and led them to the playoffs each season. Donovan was a finalist for NBA Coach of the Year this season after Oklahoma City outperformed expectations. He split with the Thunder on Sept. 8 after he couldn\u2019t get the assurances he wanted from general manager Sam Presti. On Thursday, he pushed back on the idea that he was against coaching a rebuilding team, pointing out he built a powerhouse at Florida before he moved to the NBA. \u201cThat was really never, ever about it for me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a lot more important for me, knowing that my time had ended there, what was going to be the environment, the situation going forward. I\u2019ve never really ever talked about that at all. I do feel like Oklahoma City was incredibly open and honest with me.\u201d He said he was \u201cvery positive\u201d feelings from his time with the Thunder. Once he became available, the Bulls wasted no time making it clear they wanted him. Donovan met in person with Karnisovas and Marc Eversley for 5 1\/2 hours to get the process in gear. He later had a long discussion with chairman Jerry Reinsdorf and COO Michael Reinsdorf. And when Donovan accepted the job, Karnisovas said, \u201cI could not stop smiling.\u201d Hiring Donovan was a rare big and bold move for the Bulls. It also hammered home they have a different vision now for building a contending team. With the players they have and future cap space available, they believe they are in position. They expected to make a big jump behind Zach LaVine and Lauri Markkanen, only to stumble to their second straight 22-win season. They were 11th in the Eastern Conference when play was stopped because of the pandemic, and were among the eight teams not invited to the restart in Florida. The Bulls missed the playoffs for the fourth time in five years and fired coach Jim Boylen. \u201cWhen we sat down and talked about the roster, I thought this roster was too talented for what they showed the last two years,\u201d Karnisovas said. \u201cThey have a lot of potential, and we kind of agreed there\u2019s a good mix of young players and vets, from (draft) picks to cap space in the future to build this team. On both sides, I think there was a lot of optimism looking at the roster. \u201cWe spent a lot of time talking to Billy about offense, about defense, about the way he values relationships and how he rallies players around him, and how he values relationships with players and gets a buy-in from them,\u201d he said. Donovan said he was \u201ctaken aback\u201d by Karnisovas\u2019 vision and is looking forward to \u201cworking hand in hand\u201d with him. That\u2019s something they haven\u2019t done before. They don\u2019t really know each other, but they have mutual friends in P.J. Carlesimo \u2014 Karnisovas\u2019 coach at Seton Hall \u2014 and USA Basketball national team director Sean Ford. \u201cFrom building the front office to now going after Billy \u2014 from Billy\u2019s resume to being just a great human being \u2014 I\u2019m going to go after best available regardless of my relationship with the person,\u201d Karnisovas said. \u201cI\u2019ll do all the background checks to make sure that I\u2019m getting the right guy. Billy was the guy for us.\u201d"},{"id":2786,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/qa-alex-english-hoopers-vote-day-initiative","date":"2020-09-24","title":"Q&A: Alex English on importance of voting, social justice causes","content":"ORLANDO, Fla.  \u2014 Monte Morris has a simple, four-letter solution for anyone wondering where to turn at a time of uncertainty and trepidation with what\u2019s going on outside the cocoon of the NBA bubble. \u201cV-O-T-E\u201d the Denver Nuggets point guard said, running his hand across his chest where those letters are splashed when he and his teammates take the court for the Western Conference finals against the Los Angeles Lakers. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to get our voices out there, to be heard,\u201d Morris said. \u201cThe reason we\u2019re playing is to show awareness to the police brutality, social injustice and other issues people are dealing with around the country right now. And we need to vote and encourage people everywhere to vote. The more of the league we get to vote, the better. It starts with us and spreads throughout the community. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to be the living and breathing example in our communities. Just that one little impact, seeing the words \u2018vote\u2019 across our chests, that could change one person\u2019s mind and inspire them to get involved. And ultimately, that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about.\u201d Morris has a kindred spirit in ex-Nuggets legend and Hall of Famer Alex English . He is joining with others from all over the basketball community to advocate for Hoopers Vote Day to energize voters in the lead up to the Nov. 3 general election. English, whose No. 2 was retired by Denver, says current and retired players, coaches and others associated with the basketball ecosystem can spread the word on what is easily the most consequential election of his lifetime. An eight-time All-Star and the 1983 NBA scoring champion, English shared his candid opinions on the tremendous challenges he believes the country is facing right now and in the coming weeks. * * * Question: You\u2019ve lived through some critical times in this country\u2019s history. Why do you feel such a sense of urgency right now? Alex English: This is the most crucial national election in our history because we\u2019ve got a person in the White House who doesn\u2019t mind lying about everything. He\u2019s always changing the narrative to fit him and doesn\u2019t really care about bringing the country together. It\u2019s more about division and it\u2019s an opportunity for young people, they\u2019re protesting, they\u2019re fussing. But the way you can be heard is you get yourself out there and vote. You get other people out there to vote. That\u2019s the way you make a difference in this country. And until we realize and understand that, we\u2019re going to always be protesting and fussing about politics. We\u2019ve got to mobilize. We\u2019ve got to mobilize our old people, our young people and we\u2019ve got to make a difference. We\u2019ve got to grab two or three people and take them with us. Given the current climate in the country, with the current players being as vocal as they\u2019ve been about the need for social justice, changes to systems throughout our society and voting, does it just make sense that now seems like the right time for all of these forces to come together? It makes all the sense in the world. Everything has come together for a reason. In the past, we older players, we had to go along pretty much with whatever was given to us. We had a voice but because our players today have been elevated to a different level \u2014 financially as well as status and viewer status \u2014 they get a bigger voice. And they get a bigger voice especially with young people. A lot of them follow the NBA players. And because of the injustices that have been happening in this country in the last \u2026 forever, but there\u2019s more focus on it now. It\u2019s important that they not only just talk about it and protest. They\u2019ve got to get out and vote. They\u2019ve got to take action to make things happen. And I am just proud that the NBA and WNBA players today \u2014 LeBron [James] and all the other players in both leagues \u2014 they are staying focused and saying, \u2018we may be playing basketball and we may be entertaining you, but we realize that our power is right now.\u2019 You mentioned the NBA and WNBA players and the role they are playing in this movement. Do you think they\u2019ve had an impact beyond just the basketball world? What the NBA and the WNBA have done is they\u2019ve mobilized athletes all across the spectrum. You think about this: we\u2019ve been trying to get this conversation going for how long? We\u2019ve been trying to get it forever. These players are really focused on it and they\u2019ve made other athletes focus on it. Players of previous generations have been passionate about these issues, but the climate was different \u2026 what was accepted might have been different. Your concerns seem to be rooted in something deeper than just the current unrest of what\u2019s going on right now, something more systemic? You\u2019ve got these privileged other people being able to live a comfortable life, whether it\u2019s walking down the street, whether it\u2019s going in a bank, whether it\u2019s going in a restaurant, or whether it\u2019s getting a job, a good quality job. They have had the pick of the litter. Where we\u2019ve had to deal with the systemic racism. For instance, let me tell you something: you look at TV, and it\u2019s better now than it was, but they might have one Black to represent just to say we\u2019ve got someone Black there. It\u2019s kind of like the president having the one Black person behind him at his rally, and he can say \u2018there\u2019s my Blacks, there\u2019s my Black back there.\u2019 And it\u2019s the same thing across the system, whether it be the movies and entertainment, they think they have one Black person there and they represent everybody. Why can\u2019t a show have three or four Blacks? Why can\u2019t a business have four or five Black people a the top. Why does it have to be that one, that one person they get to represent us? But why does it have to be that way when we know there is so much Black talent and talent of all colors and creeds, I\u2019m talking across the board? In that respect, the fight from previous eras sounds very much like what folks of this generation are fighting for now when it comes to trying to energize the vote. Exactly. So, what these young people today are saying is that [the status quo] doesn\u2019t work anymore. We\u2019re not going for that. We\u2019ve got talented people across the board and they\u2019ve got to recognize us. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m so proud of them. I\u2019m so proud of them standing up for social justice and equality and not letting it go. They can\u2019t let it go. It doesn\u2019t mean anything if you don\u2019t get your butt out there and vote. I know many of the players here in the bubble were conflicted about the idea of playing while they felt their voices and energy might have been needed elsewhere at this critical time. But you\u2019ve supported them here, even showing up at the virtual fan space for a Nuggets game. Did you feel a need to show that support visibly just to make that point? Absolutely. It is so important, because the one thing the NBA has is an audience. And the audience is across the spectrum. It\u2019s Black, white, women, men, it doesn\u2019t matter. So, we all are forced to see the messages, to hear these young people say, we are tired of this. Literally get your knee off my neck. Because it\u2019s been going on for too long. You\u2019ve had your knee on my grandad, my mom, my uncle. You\u2019ve had your knee on their neck all this time. And we\u2019re tired of it. And you believe the best way to see things change is through mobilizing the vote for the coming election? That\u2019s right. It\u2019s plain and simple. People have to get off their butts and vote. * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

A chase-down block. A move-your-feet, one-on-one stop. A deflection and save. Multiple rotations on the same possession. But energy and effort can be just as critical on the other side of the ball. And it was clearly visible in the Miami Heat\u2019s offense in their 112-109 victory in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference finals . Rookie Tyler Herro was the star as the Heat took a 3-1 series lead, scoring 37 points on 14-for-21 shooting off the bench. And this wasn\u2019t a Klay Thompson, catch-and-shoot performance; Eight of Herro\u2019s 14 field goals were unassisted , with the highlights being a transition drive past Jayson Tatum and a deep, step-back 3 over Marcus Smart. > Game 5: Heat vs. Celtics, Friday at 8:30 ET on ESPN But Herro was less an offense to himself and more an outstanding cog in a system that wears a defense down and eventually creates open shots, lanes to the basket, or mismatches than can be taken advantage of. Much has been made (including once , twice in this space) about the Celtics\u2019 ups and downs against the Miami zone. Game 4 saw the most zone of the series thus far (the Heat used it for almost the entire second half), and Boston\u2019s 19 turnovers were a significant issue in the loss. But the Celtics have scored more efficiently in three of their four games in this series than they did in all but one of their seven games against the Toronto Raptors . Lament Jayson Tatum\u2019s scoreless first half or Marcus Smart shooting 1-for-8 from 3-point range, but 109 points on 96 possessions should be enough to win a playoff game for a team with a top-five defense. The issue is that top-five defense can\u2019t keep up with the opponent. Before the series started, Celtics coach Brad Stevens didn\u2019t just acknowledge that Miami would be tougher to defend than the Raptors, who were a possession or two away from beating Boston in the conference semifinals. Stevens put the Heat in elite company. \u201cThis is probably the closest team in the East that we\u2019ve seen to the Warriors,\u201d Stevens said, \u201cwith regard to their cutting and shooting.\u201d With changes in the starting lineup \u2014 Kendrick Nunn and Meyers Leonard out, Goran Dragic and Jae Crowder in \u2014 there\u2019s been more cutting and shooting in the playoffs than there was in the regular season, when the Heat ranked seventh offensively , scoring 111.9 points per 100 possessions. They\u2019ve only scored 1.1 more per 100 in the postseason (113.0), but they\u2019ve done it against three of the league\u2019s top six defenses. In the first round, the Heat scored 5.2 more points per 100 possessions than the Indiana Pacers\u2019 sixth-ranked defense allowed in the regular season. In the conference semifinals, the Heat scored 11.1 more points per 100 possessions than the Milwaukee Bucks\u2019 top-ranked defense allowed in the first round. And in this series, the Heat have scored 13.1 more points per 100 possessions than the Celtics\u2019 fourth-ranked defense allowed in the conference semis. This is a difficult team to defend, even for the league\u2019s best defenses. Herro may have had a huge game on Wednesday, but there\u2019s no trying to take away one option against the Heat. Through four games, six guys on the Heat are averaging double-figures , with four averaging between 18.8 and 21.8 points per contest. Bam Adebayo is one of those four, but he\u2019s also the hub around which the other Heat scorers move. He leads the postseason with 10.5 elbow touches per game and by a rough count, Adebayo either set a ball screen or executed a dribble hand-off on about 50 of the 80 offensive possessions for which he was on the floor in Game 4. There were times when he did both\u2026 And there were times when he handed the ball off to Duncan Robinson three times in the span of five seconds\u2026 So one of the Celtics\u2019 biggest challenges is determining how to defend those pick-and-rolls and DHOs. They don\u2019t have to worry about Adebayo as a pick-and-pop shooting threat (he averages less than a point per game from outside the paint), but four games into the series, they\u2019ve yet to really figure it out. \u201cThey do a really good job of trying to set those screens,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cI think a lot of times you want to blitz or switch. They do a good job of getting out of the switches or setting the switches low. Specifically on those hand-backs, the minute you jump it, he fakes it, dunks it. Puts you in a real bind.\u201d They Celtics have tried just about everything, different coverages and different defenders. But the Heat have found ways to score against all of it. First, there\u2019s the standard coverage, with Adebayo\u2019s defender dropping back and the other defender chasing his man around the screen. Jaylen Brown did a heck of a job the first two times in the three-hand-off example above, but then got flatted by the third screen. Smart had to leave Goran Dragic to help on Robinson, and Dragic got an open three from the wing . Here are some more examples of how the Heat took advantage of standard coverage in Game 4\u2026 Play 1: Adebayo sets a screen for Dragic to get to the middle of the floor with his strong hand. Kemba Walker goes over the screen, Daniel Theis has to stop Dragic\u2019s drive, and Adebayo has a clean roll to the rim, with Brown staying attached to Jimmy Butler (fewer than one made three per game in the playoffs) in the right corner. Play 2: After almost committing an offensive foul on a drive, Adebayo gets the ball back in the post. He kicks it out to Herro and sets a screen along the left sideline. Brown goes over the screen, Theis retreats, and Herro hits a he\u2019s-feeling-it-tonight runner off the glass. Play 3: Late in the shot clock, Robinson pitches the ball to Adebayo, takes a hand-off, and slams the brakes. Walker goes over the screen and fouls Robinson as he shoots a 3. Play 4: Adebayo sets a high screen for Herro. Brown gets caught in the screen and Robert Williams is just chillin\u2019 at the free throw line, so Herro steps into a pull-up 3. Play 5: On a sideline out-of-bounds play that the Heat ran often on Wednesday , Herro takes a hand-off from Adebayo with an empty corner. Walker goes over the screen and, with nobody to tag Adebayo\u2019s roll, Theis retreats, allowing Herro to drain another 3 from the top of the arc. By switching ball screens and DHOs, the Celtics can seemingly flatten the Heat out. Adebayo\u2019s defender can switch to the ball and (theoretically) prevent a shot or drive, and the other defender can stay attached to Adebayo on his roll to the rim. The Celtics switched some Adebayo actions in Game 4, both with Theis and with smaller defenders guarding the Heat\u2019s center. They had trouble in either case. Here are a few examples\u2026 Play 1: After Dragic rejects an Adebayo screen and Theis recovers to the roll, Adebayo runs a DHO with Butler on the left side of the floor. Tatum gets caught in the screen, so Theis switches onto the ball-handler. But Butler pulls up from the foul line before Theis can get there. Play 2: Adebayo sets a pin-down screen for Butler and then turns around for a ball-screen. Theis switches to contest Butler\u2019s step-back jumper and Gordon Hayward can\u2019t handle Adebayo on the glass, committing a loose-ball foul (one of the 10 fouls that Adebayo drew in Game 4). Play 3: The Celtics had Theis guarding Andre Iguodala in the fourth quarter, perhaps so they can better switch Adebayo screen actions. Here, the Heat run that same sideline-out-of-bounds, empty-corner DHO. Hayward switches the hand-off to Butler, but Adebayo out-muscles Brown for the rebound, putting it back for two of the Heat\u2019s 21 second-chance points ( their high for the postseason ). Play 4: Another sideline out-of-bounds play, another empty-corner DHO. Hayward jumps out to prevent a Herro 3, but then gets beat off the dribble. Theis helps off Iguodala, who gets an open 3 \u2026 that he doesn\u2019t shoot. He does get Dragic an open shot and then chases down the rebound. The Celtics also tried blitzing the ball-handler at times on Wednesday. But that just gave left somebody open. Here are a few examples\u2026 Play 1: After the Celtics cover simultaneous cuts to the rim from Butler and Robinson, Adebayo hands off to Dragic, who gets trapped by Brown and Walker. Theis leaves Jae Crowder to tag Adebayo\u2019s roll and Crowder gets a wide-open 3 from the right wing. Play 2: Theis blitzes a Butler-Adebayo pick-and-roll. Adebayo flashes back to the ball and gets a friendly roll on a short pull-up before Theis can recover. Play 3: Tatum and Hayward trap Herro after a hand-off. Herro finds the Adebayo in the paint and, with the Celtics playing their best-five lineup, the only weak-side help is that of Walker. Adebayo drops in an easy jump hook over the 6-foot guard. Play 4: Hayward and Tatum trap another Butler-Adebayo pick-and-roll. Butler quickly gets the ball to the big man at the foul line, forcing Brown to step up. Adebayo drops the ball off to Iguodala on the baseline, Smart rotates down, and Dragic gets a wide-open 3 in the left corner. Stevens was right about the Heat looking like the Warriors, except that Jimmy Butler isn\u2019t Stephen Curry in regard to needing to prevent him from shooting pull-up 3s. Much of playoff basketball is finding ways to score when the defense takes away the primary option(s) in your offense. Questionable traps of Butler aside, the Celtics are a great defensive team. Though they had some focus and effort issues in Game 1 , they\u2019ve done the work to take away as many of those hand-off actions as they can. But, for the most part, the Heat just don\u2019t stop moving. When they do, they struggle. You can see it in select possessions , you can see it in their isolation stats (just 24 points on 29 isolation possessions in the series), and you can see it in the game-to-game tracking data. The Heat\u2019s one loss in this series was their one sub-par offensive game (106 points on 100 possessions). Not coincidentally, it was also the game in which they didn\u2019t move as much offensively. They\u2019ve averaged 11.2 miles traveled per 24 minutes of possession in their three wins, but only traveled 10.1 per 24 in Game 3. All that movement takes energy, and the energy isn\u2019t just required of the Heat\u2019s shooters running off dozens of hand-offs. Adebayo matches his teammates\u2019 tireless movement with his willingness to set multiple screens on almost every possession. If the first one doesn\u2019t work out, he\u2019ll come back and try again. The 23-year-old big man scored 20 points on 7-for-11 shooting in Game 4. He was also credited with four assists, two secondary assists and eight screen assists . The eight screen assists were more than every other player in the game combined. We may appreciate the rapid development of Robinson and marvel at Herro scoring 37 points in the conference finals at just 20 years of age. We may note the effect of Smart guarding Dragic and debate whether or not Butler needs to take over late in games. But the Heat offense revolves around Bam Adebayo. In these playoffs, they\u2019ve scored 21.7 more points per 100 possessions with him on the floor (117.1) than they have with him off the floor (95.4). So the left arm injury he suffered late in the fourth quarter on Wednesday is concerning. A 3-1 series lead suggests room for error, but the results of the games do not. The Heat\u2019s three wins have come by a total of 11 points and they\u2019ve been outscored by 29 in Adebayo\u2019s 40 minutes on the bench. So they can only hope that he\u2019s on the floor for Game 5. Whether it\u2019s by three points or thirty, one more win gets them to The Finals. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

The time stamps and age references were flying around fast and furious Wednesday during and after Miami\u2019s 112-109 victory over Boston in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference finals, what with Heat wing Tyler Herro\u2019s remarkable 37-point performance . Sure, what Herro did \u2014 tormenting the Celtics in a game they desperately needed, carrying Miami until a few of his teammates found some offensive rhythm \u2014 was special. Special for anyone and, yes, especially special for a rookie. But let\u2019s not forget that Herro is in the late stages of the longest NBA rookie season ever. His rookie year has been, literally, nearly a year. > Game 5: Heat vs. Celtics, Friday at 8:30 ET on ESPN Five seasons in one: Fall, winter, spring, summer and fall again. \u201cAt this point, we\u2019re past that,\u201d Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said of Herro\u2019s level of experience after his team went up 3-1 in the series, improved to 11-2 in the bubble postseason and moved within one victory of its first Finals since 2014. \u201cHe\u2019s not a rookie anymore. We need his skill set. Does that mean it\u2019s going to translate into that kind of point production every night? No, it doesn\u2019t.\u201d More like once every 40 years or so. Herro still is just 20 years old. (He won\u2019t turn 21 until Jan. 20, by which time his second NBA season might be underway.) And there only has been one player age 20 or younger in NBA playoff history who scored more than Herro\u2019s 37. Magic Johnson, who did it in one of the league\u2019s greatest individual performances ever. Johnson jumped the opening tap on May 16, 1980, for injured and absent Lakers captain Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in Game 6 of the 1980 Finals. He then scored 42 points in 47 minutes, grabbed 15 rebounds, passed for seven assists, had three steals and shot 14-of-14 from the foul line in what became the title clincher over the Sixers in Philadelphia. Herro\u2019s stats line and timing wasn\u2019t quite so dramatic. But he got his 37 points in less than 36 minutes, shooting 14-for-21 and 5-for-10 on 3-pointers. He made all four of his free throws, had six rebounds and three assists and a pesky minus-4 rating. But the when of Herro\u2019s production was as vital as the what. Through three quarters, he had 20 points hitting eight of 12 shots, when the rest of Miami\u2019s squad was 19-for-54 (35.2%). Then the rookie \u2013 er, veteran rookie \u2013 scored 17 more in the fourth, including three buckets early in the period after the Celtics had gotten within a single possession. They were the sort of shots a young player might not even be willing to take, never mind be calm enough to make. \u201cThe context of those makes \u2013 you know, [those] are the big separators in this league, and those are pressure shots,\u201d Spoelstra said. \u201c He was making plays at the end of the clock, you know, and that\u2019s a skill set that he has.\u201d Herro has had it for a while, at least in fledgling stages, dating back to his play at Whitnall High School in Greenfield, Wis., just southwest of Milwaukee. He averaged nearly 33 points there, earning interest from Wisconsin and other top schools. He committed, then de-committed, to the Badgers, opting for Kentucky for one season. His 60 3-pointers and 14.0 scoring average as a freshman were only enough to boost him to No. 13 in the 2019 Draft. He went in the middle of three Wildcats first-round picks that night. \u201cI think someone said my wingspan was too short,\u201d Herro recalled late Wednesday. \u201cThey say everything but, you know, whatever they say, it\u2019s whatever.\u201d Exactly. By the time Herro got to Las Vegas nearly 15 months ago with the Heat\u2019s summer league entry, some of his potential was evident even for an NBA.com reporter to see. Watching Herro effortlessly get to his spots in pregame warmups and games, rising gracefully with a quick release and landing as if on foam, it seemed clear Miami had snagged a keeper. So much so that when a rumor surfaced of a possible trade for Russell Westbrook in the days after the Heat acquired Jimmy Butler \u2013 and Herro was mentioned as a piece in the deal \u2013 Miami passed. Or at least could feel good about what never happened, given Herro\u2019s development and high ceiling. So when was the Heat\u2019s \u201cEureka!\u201d breakthrough with the kid, when the coaches and the front office knew he might one day do, well, what he did in Game 4? \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Spoelstra said. \u201c I know like everybody is looking for that signature moment. That would be such a great story, right? \u2018I knew that day he would be this guy.\u2019 I think everybody over estimates what you can do in a day and what you can do in months of work and sweat and grind when nobody is watching.\u201d Herro\u2019s coach used the word \u201crelentless\u201d to describe his work ethic, and there were times in the season when defensively he could not meet Spoelstra\u2019s or the team\u2019s expectations. He also lost 15 games to a right ankle injury, playing a total of 36 minutes in February. Throughout, though, Miami\u2019s veterans kept encouraging and testing Herro, getting him through \u2013 till the virus shutdown, anyway \u2013 his first NBA season. Of particular help was Jimmy Butler, who channeled his rookie season as the No. 30 pick in 2011 and the help he got from Chicago vets such as Joakim Noah, Derrick Rose and Luol Deng. To see Herro now, after his Game 4 performance, Butler said, \u201cmakes all of us smile. We\u2019re all so happy for him because he knows what he\u2019s capable of, and he just plays with so much confidence. \u201cTo him, there\u2019s no pressure or anything.\u201d Spoelstra said that having teammates\u2019 trust is what makes a game like Herro had possible, and the young wing agreed. \u201cIt\u2019s everything, really, everything,\u201d he said. So now the achievements pile up. Herro has scored at least 10 points in each of Miami\u2019s 13 playoff games so far. In NBA playoff history for rookies, that matches Lakers legend Elgin Baylor (in 1959) and trails only Boston\u2019s Jayson Tatum (14 in 2018) and Phoenix\u2019s Alvan Adams (19 in 1976) in the 50 years that stat has been tracked. He has scored 214 points off the bench this postseason, third most by a rookie reserve. The Spurs\u2019 Manu Ginobili scored 221 in 2003 and Philadelphia\u2019s Andrew Toney had 221 in 1981. Spoelstra joked that Herro\u2019s teammates and coaches would \u201cabsolutely crush him [Thursday] to keep him humble,\u201d then immediately walked it back. He touted the kid\u2019s \u201cfearlessness\u201d and \u201cgreat competitive humility.\u201d Which were evident once Herro sat down for, in a non-bubble postseason, would have been what\u2019s known as a \u201cpodium game.\u201d Instead, he sat on a folding chair on the floor, wearing a Phillies ball cap and naturally a mask that obscured any hero shots. Didn\u2019t matter. \u201cI\u2019m just going to bet on myself,\u201d Herro said, explaining his deep confidence. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing that my whole life. I went from, you know, a small town in Milwaukee to Kentucky, and nobody thought I would survive there. And nobody thought I would survive here. Obviously there\u2019s a lot of factors that play into it but at the end of the day, I\u2019m just going to bet on myself.\u201d * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Still, when none of that pops, Vogel believes there\u2019s a simple counter. \u201cWhen that happens, you\u2019ve got to win with your energy and your hustle,\u201d he said. Denver rode those attributes hard Tuesday to pull the series to within a game. > Game 4: Lakers vs. Nuggets, Thursday at 9 ET on TNT The hustle statistics from Game 3 pretty much prove as much.  The Lakers hit just 6-for-23 3-pointers in Game 3, and that registered as their second-lowest output of the postseason from deep. L.A. bigs Anthony Davis, JaVale McGee and Dwight Howard only exacerbated the shooting woes by combining for just four rebounds as Denver won the battle of the boards 44-25. Credit Nikola Jokic, Paul Millsap and Jerami Grant for keeping the Lakers\u2019 bigs off the glass. That trio alone combined for more defensive box outs (16) than the entire Los Angeles squad. That played significantly in helping the Nuggets seize an 11-4 advantage in second-chance points. \u201cWe didn\u2019t play our best game, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Vogel said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t as sharp as we should\u2019ve been, could\u2019ve been, in particular to start the game and into the second quarter; a step slow to some things. We weren\u2019t as physical as we need to be. As a result, we created a deficit for ourselves that was tough to overcome. So, we didn\u2019t play as sharp as we need to, and we had a poor shooting night. It was our worst shooting night since Game 1 against Portland.\u201d While it\u2019s certainly debatable, Denver feels it could actually be leading this series 2-1. What\u2019s undeniable, however, is the continued improvement we\u2019re seeing from the Nuggets in different facets in every game. Denver knocked down 54.8% of its field goals in Game 3 to run its record to 5-0 this postseason when it shoots 50% or better. The Nuggets also turned 16 Laker turnovers into 25 points, despite allowing 23 points off their 20 turnovers. After falling 126-114 in Game 1 on the strength of Los Angeles reeling off 35 points in transition, Denver tightened up that area of its game, allowing just eight points on fast breaks in Game 2, only to fall victim to Davis in the end on a buzzer-beater. Los Angeles outrebounded the Nuggets in that game 44-31 and outpaced them 16-12 in second-chance points. \u201cAfter Game 1, the goal was to eliminate the easy baskets we were giving them. I thought our transition defense in Game 2 was terrific,\u201d Malone said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t rebound as well as we needed to. But last night we had a plus-19 rebound margin. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s been talked about enough. We limited the Lakers to four offensive rebounds for 4 points, which is unbelievable.\u201d Surprisingly, they\u2019ve also found ways to, at times, slow down Los Angeles stars James and Davis. Paul Millsap has guarded Davis for nearly 16 minutes this series, limiting him to a total of 20 points on 27.8% shooting from the field. Throughout the postseason, Davis has connected on 50% or better from the floor against every other player he\u2019s matched up against for at least 10 minutes. \u201cI think we\u2019ve done a better job of guarding LeBron, guarding A.D., giving them different looks, making the floor crowded, and then flying around and making plays behind that,\u201d Malone said. \u201cSo, that\u2019s where it starts for us: we\u2019re a team that has to defend at a high level because that gives our offense life, and that\u2019s the only chance that we have.\u201d Toss in the strong two-way play from Jerami Grant (scored a playoff career-high 26 points on 7-for-11 shooting in Game 3), along with budding superstar Jamal Murray (playoff career-high 12 assists to go with 28 points in Game 3) and Jokic, who has registered the most career playoff games in NBA history (14) over his first two postseasons with at least 20 points, 10 rebounds and five assists, and it\u2019s easy to see why Denver continues to play unafraid against this high-powered Lakers squad teeming with postseason experience. Millsap\u2019s tenacious defense on Davis, Grant\u2019s breakout play and Jokic\u2019s two-way dominance and hustle seem to just create more opportunities for Murray to continue flourishing. He\u2019s scored 21 points or more in every game of this series, and we\u2019ve already seen him drop a couple of 50 pieces in the opening round of the postseason, not to mention 40 more in Denver\u2019s Game 7 win over the L.A. Clippers in the semifinals. Murray\u2019s two 3-pointers over the last 2:17 put Game 3 on ice. \u201cYou definitely learn more about your opponent and what to try to look for, tendencies and all of that [as the series progresses],\u201d Murray said. \u201cIf we\u2019re consistent in our play, we can win a lot of games and put a lot of pressure on other teams. Now we\u2019re back in the series, and we\u2019ve got to forget about this and move on to Game 4.\u201d * * * Michael C. Wright is a senior writer for NBA.com.

Players and coaches on the four teams still competing here were stunned and disappointed when they learned that just one of the officers involved in the March 13 shooting death of 26-year-old Breonna Taylor would face charges. A grand jury in Louisville had indicted that officer for shooting into neighboring apartments during the incident. They\u2019d come here 22 teams strong in July, committed to not only restarting and completing an NBA season stained by the coronavirus pandemic, but also to use the platform and their collective influence to call attention to police brutality, systemic racism and social injustice issues. Justice for Breonna Taylor was one of the siren calls. Her name invoked often by players who chose to speak out and speak up rather than sticking strictly to sports and what transpired on the courts here at Walt Disney World\u2019s Wide World of Sports. But by early afternoon Wednesday, the mood had soured considerably as the news spread around campus. That $12 million settlement the Louisville Police agreed to pay Taylor\u2019s family wasn\u2019t the sort of justice anyone here had in mind. \u201cLike everybody else, [I\u2019m] very disappointed,\u201d Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. \u201cI think all of us don\u2019t understand it. It\u2019s not justice. The $12 million looks like such a ridiculously empty payoff. I\u2019m really just \u2014 it\u2019s all about justice and it was not served.\u201d For some, just trying to digest what the grand jury handed down \u2014 Officer Brett Hankison was charged with three counts of wanton endangerment in connection to the police raid that resulted in Taylor\u2019s death \u2014 was hard enough. \u201cSadly, there was no justice today for Breonna Taylor,\u201d NBPA executive director Michelle Roberts said in a statement released Wednesday evening. \u201cHer killing was the result of a string of callous and careless decisions made with a lack of regard for humanity, ultimately resulting in the death of an innocent and beautiful woman with her entire life ahead of her. Our players and I once again extend our deepest sympathies to her family and we vow to continue working in her honor and to always say her name.\u201d Getting the news this late in this bubble experience, when there are only four teams left in the championship chase, made it even tougher to feel anything other than completely demoralized by a process they thought they were impacting with their words and gestures. \u201cThese are unprecedented times and there\u2019s incredible disappointment and frustration in our locker room, as well there should,\u201d Spoelstra said. \u201cOur guys have been able to manage a lot of this disappointment over the last several months of things that have been happening for obviously way too long.\u201d When Minneapolis Police officer Derek Chauvin kneeled on the neck of George Floyd for eight minutes and 46 seconds, killing the handcuffed black man in the street on May 25, it set off protests and outrage around the globe. Outrage over years of brutal police tactics that have disproportionally affected communities of color for generations, morphed into a protest movement the likes of which the country hadn\u2019t seen since the height of the Civil Rights era. Some of the most outspoken public figures were NBA players, who took to the streets, social media and anywhere else they could express their anger and frustration. One of the missions for the players in agreeing to resume the season was to bring more attention to these issues, be it on their backs with words and slogans tied to the movement and with their words every chance they had to speak into a microphone. \u201cI think we\u2019re being heard, but obviously the goals that we\u2019re trying to achieve we\u2019re very far away from after seeing today\u2019s verdict.,\u201d Lakers guard Danny Green said, \u201cIt\u2019s a disappointment. We feel like we\u2019ve taken a step back, that we haven\u2019t made the progress we were seeking. Our voices aren\u2019t being heard loud enough.\u201d Celtics coach Brad Stevens said he addressed the Taylor news with his team in detail before Wednesday\u2019s game. \u201cI think at the end of the day there\u2019s been a call across the country, rightfully so, for more transparency, more accountability, just a better community relationship,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously this feels like a setback to that. At the same time I guess the other side is you see a lot of cities, a lot of places, really taking steps that should have been taken a long time ago, but at least being taken now, whether it\u2019s meeting the initiatives of the 8 Can\u2019t Wait, committing to civilian review boards, better transparency and data, diversifying the police force even more to match that of the neighborhood, whatever the case may be. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t feel good today. So what I told the team was, I just sent them a text midday, because everybody has their own thing that they do during the day of the game, and I just said, If you need somebody to vent to, if you need somebody to talk to, if you want to call or get me in person at the gym, feel free.\u201d Nuggets coach Mike Malone said they got word of the Louisville grand jury\u2019s decision as they were finishing up a staff meeting and before Wednesday\u2019s team meeting and practice in preparation for Thursday\u2019s Game 4 tilt against the Los Angeles Lakers in the Western Conference finals. \u201cI\u2019m not sure all our players have really had a chance to internalize the news that came out today,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously, the fact that the officers that were involved in her death were not charged. I think that\u2019s something that we\u2019ll continue to talk about and discuss over the next few days, next 24 to 48 hours. I try to talk to guys individually as much as possible as well in those one-on-one conversations, which are private, just to make sure guys are handling and coping with the news, understanding how they may want to react, what their conversations may be like. It\u2019s something that we\u2019ll continue to discuss.\u201d Malone was right about his players being caught off guard with the news. Rookie Michael Porter Jr. was informed of the grand jury\u2019s decision by reporters. When the details were explained to him, he paused and then shook his head before responding. \u201cSee, I didn\u2019t even know that,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t have Instagram, I don\u2019t have Twitter. And you said that happened today?\u201d It happened as the Nuggets were walking onto the court for practice. \u201cSee, I had no idea,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I mean, that\u2019s \u2026 there\u2019s really no words for that. Everybody knows that\u2019s not right. I mean, this is the first time I\u2019m hearing about that, but that\u2019s heartbreaking because I know a lot of people have been doing a lot of steps trying to get the justice that situation needs. And to hear that that happened is not right.\u201d Nuggets veteran Torrey Craig had a similar reaction. \u201cIt\u2019s just disappointing. It\u2019s depressing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not the outcome anybody wanted. Yeah, that\u2019s a touchy subject, so I\u2019m just going to leave it at that.\u201d Nuggets forward Jerami Grant has been one of the loudest voices in demanding justice for Taylor and mentioned anticipating Wednesday\u2019s decision after scoring a playoff career-high 26 points in his team\u2019s Game 3 win over the Lakers Tuesday night. He did not speak to the media Wednesday. But Malone said they were studying the decision in detail in order to fully comprehend why the justice they were seeking wasn\u2019t served. \u201cI just put myself in Breonna Taylor\u2019s boyfriend\u2019s shoes,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m in my apartment, wherever I am living. Somebody breaks into my house at 2:00, 3:00 in the morning. I am going to feel like somebody should not be there. It\u2019s tragic. I know there\u2019s a curfew in place. [Nuggets assistant coach] Wes Unseld\u2019s family is from there, has a lot of family down there. \u201cWhen I think about the tragedy of those police officers getting off, it also makes me think a lot closer to home, Elijah McClain, his case in Aurora, Colorado, how we\u2019re still demanding justice for the police officers who were involved in the death of Elijah McClain. That is still not the case. That\u2019s just been tragic. I know we\u2019ve been using our platform down here to try to bring about education and a voice in a lot of players on our team, especially also spoken out on justice for Breonna Taylor. We have not gotten that justice. That\u2019s a shame. Hopefully that will change at some point.\u201d Lakers star LeBron James took to Twitter to share his frustration. A month ago, when the footage of the Jacob Blake shooting in Kenosha, Wis. rippled through the bubble, the Milwaukee Bucks instigated a player strike that shut down the games for three days as the players contemplated ending this season with the streets outside of this environment heating up. The players wanted assurances that the league and its owners would be committed to impacting a change in their respective communities to help heal the divisions and improve the dialogue. Taylor\u2019s mother was actually on a Zoom call with players during that time, as they sought input and advice on what their next steps should be. \u201cYeah, the Zoom call where she talked to everybody. Yes, I was part of that,\u201d Lakers guard Alex Caruso said before detailing his takeaways from that conversation.\u201c Just how hopeful the people close to Breonna were, how much strength they have, because I always try to put myself in the position of the people that are going through stuff. I try to be as emotionally connected as I can, and I try to imagine if that was one of my sisters or one of my parents. Those people are a lot stronger and a lot more professional with the way they handle themselves than I think I would if it happened to somebody that I knew. So just the strength that they have and the fortitude for them to just keep fighting.\u201d The Lakers\u2019 Green pointed out that with fewer teams and no real time in the schedule to take a break, figuring out some concrete next steps this late in the process is a difficult proposition. \u201cObviously there\u2019s time in between each round that we can take to reconvene and discuss,\u201d he said. \u201cHopefully we can continue \u2014 obviously basketball is a small part of the bigger picture of what we\u2019re doing here \u2026 But we\u2019re not going to stop. We\u2019re going to continue. We\u2019re going to continue fighting, we\u2019re going to continue to push, we\u2019re going to continue to use our voices. \u201cBut yeah, after today\u2019s verdict, seems like every time we turn around and look at the news, it\u2019s always something disheartening or disappointing, and that\u2019s from all standpoints of what\u2019s going on in our country. We\u2019re not happy about it, but can\u2019t give up hope, can\u2019t quit, got to keep fighting and try to make things better, not just for us but for our future children, future grandkids. We want it to be a better place here for them to live.\u201d * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

Karl Anthony-Towns got to work in Minnesota and his old coach started to mold his new team in New York. After six months without one, it felt so good for some NBA teams to practice again that even Allen Iverson might\u2019ve enjoyed it. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a layup drill with such intensity,\u201d Atlanta coach Lloyd Pierce said. \u201cWe did a full-court layup drill and the guys were clapping and cheering. You know they haven\u2019t practiced in a long time if they\u2019re excited about layup drills.\u201d The teams that didn\u2019t qualify for the restart of the NBA season at Walt Disney World could begin voluntary workouts Wednesday to start preparing for their next game \u2013 whenever that is. \u201cAs of right now, we don\u2019t know when next season will begin, but there\u2019s obviously a lot of work to be done between now and then,\u201d Tom Thibodeau said after the Knicks practiced. The league allowed those eight clubs (Atlanta, Golden State, New York, Minnesota, Charlotte, Cleveland, Chicago and Detroit) to have voluntary team workouts by creating their own bubbles, where players and staff stay together and are tested daily for the coronavirus. While the other 22 teams had all played at least eight games at Disney, the bottom eight had been restricted to only voluntary individual workouts since the NBA season was suspended on March 11 because of the pandemic. Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse in Cleveland had essentially been vacant since then. For a young team like the Cavaliers, the interruption was a double blow since they had just undergone a coaching change and were playing their best ball of the season under J.B. Bickerstaff, who was promoted following John Beilein\u2019s stunning resignation. Love said it was \u201cparamount\u201d for the team to get together and make up for lost time. \u201cIt gives us some sense of continuity, some sense of togetherness,\u201d said Love, who didn\u2019t want to miss the voluntary workouts. \u201cUnlike those other teams, they were able to get together. Even other teams that didn\u2019t make the playoffs, they still had eight games. They got to play for something. \u201cWe weren\u2019t able to do that. So it\u2019s huge for us to be on the same court, even just seeing each other and spending time with each other and be around one and other.\u201d Under the agreement between the NBA and the National Basketball Players Association, players who planned to take part in the group workouts could continue their individual workouts at team facilities on Sept. 14, at which time they began their daily virus testing. Following two days of quarantine, workouts and scrimmages could begin Wednesday and run through Oct. 6. Stephen Curry and Draymond Green opted not to take part in the workouts, but Golden State coach Steve Kerr said the Warriors expect Klay Thompson on the court this week as he works his way back from a torn ACL in the 2019 NBA Finals. Pierce got the Hawks quickly playing 5 on 5, because they hadn\u2019t in so long. Coaches who didn\u2019t know what to expect were pleasantly surprised by the level of play they saw. \u201cWe know the basketball will get better and better,\u201d said Minnesota coach Ryan Saunders, whose group of 15 players included Towns and D\u2019Angelo Russell. \u201cHonestly, it was a lot better than I expected it to be after a six-month hiatus.\u201d The workouts allowed Clint Capela to finally join the Hawks for practice, having been sidelined by injury following his acquisition from Houston before the shutdown. Players and coaches had been in contact during that time, but not the way they were Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019ve been texting, calling, Zooming a ton throughout the six months, but there\u2019s nothing like being live, eye to eye, face to face with another person,\u201d Charlotte coach James Borrego said. \u201cSo this time is really valuable for us.\u201d Unfortunately, they don\u2019t know when they\u2019ll be back together once the workouts end. Commissioner Adam Silver said the 2020-21 season may not start until at least January , so it\u2019s unclear when training camps would begin. At least the teams won\u2019t be off the floor until then. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing we can do about what we missed or didn\u2019t get to do,\u201d Pierce said. \u201cWe know how to navigate through what we\u2019ve been given.

(AP) \u2014 LeBron James sent the word to the Los Angeles Lakers in a group text on Wednesday afternoon, and basketball suddenly seemed irrelevant. A grand jury in Kentucky had finally spoken. And James was letting his team know that NBA players, who have spent months seeking justice for Breonna Taylor, did not get what they wanted. \u201cSomething was done,\u201d Lakers guard Danny Green said, \u201cbut it wasn\u2019t enough.\u201d Wednesday\u2019s decision by the grand jury, which brought no charges against Louisville police for Taylor\u2019s killing and only three counts of wanton endangerment against fired Officer Brett Hankison for shooting into Taylor\u2019s neighbors\u2019 homes, was not unexpected by many NBA players and coaches. They had a sense it wasn\u2019t going to go how they hoped. \u201cI know we\u2019ve been using our platform down here to try to bring about education and a voice in a lot of players on our team, especially also spoken out on justice for Breonna Taylor,\u201d Denver coach Michael Malone said. \u201cWe have not gotten that justice.\u201d Teams came to Walt Disney World to finish the season and crown a champion, and hoping that the platform of the NBA\u2019s restart bubble could help amplify calls for change. Players and coaches have used the NBA spotlight to make statements at a time when the demand for racial equality and an end to police brutality is resonating as loudly as it has in generations. And Taylor\u2019s story \u2013 the tale of a 26-year-old Black woman who was killed March 13 by police in Louisville when they burst into her apartment on a no-knock warrant during a narcotics investigation centered around a suspect who did not live there \u2013 has captivated NBA players. Many have met, virtually, with members of her family to offer support. They say her name in news conferences, wear it on shirts, scrawl it onto their sneakers. \u201cWe have moms. We have sisters, nieces, aunties. And just like men of color have experienced traumatic instances, so have women,\u201d Boston forward Jaylen Brown said. \u201cThat is an example of some things that happen to women in our country. So, we wanted to stand alongside them, but also make it that it\u2019s not just us. I think the future is female, so it\u2019s important to show our sisters that we care. That\u2019s why it\u2019s been important.\u201d Many NBA players and others took to social media to share their thoughts following the news. Even for teams not in the bubble, it mattered. Atlanta coach Lloyd Pierce leads a committee of NBA coaches tasked with finding new ways to use their own platform to create change, and he\u2019s encouraged his own players \u2013 Black and white alike \u2013 to speak out and take action, whether in Atlanta or their own community. Pierce took Wednesday\u2019s news hard. \u201cYeah, there was a grand jury and yeah, they went through the information and yeah, they have facts to support whatever the claims may be,\u201d Pierce said. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t provide any justice for those that are on the outside, those that feel like the police and law enforcement are there to protect them. \u2026 What currently is happening isn\u2019t good enough.\u201d National Basketball Players Association executive director Michele Roberts went a step further . \u201cSadly, there was no justice today for Breonna Taylor,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cHer killing was the result of a string of callous and careless decisions made with a lack of regard for humanity, ultimately resulting in the death of an innocent and beautiful woman with her entire life ahead of her.\u201d The league shut down for three days last month when a boycott that was started by the Milwaukee Bucks \u2013 in response to the shooting by police of a Black man, Jacob Blake, in Kenosha, Wisconsin \u2013 nearly caused players to end the season because they felt their pleas for change were not being taken seriously enough. And Wednesday\u2019s news was another disappointment for them. \u201cWe feel like we\u2019ve taken a step back, that we haven\u2019t made the progress we were seeking,\u201d Green said. \u201cOur voices aren\u2019t being heard loud enough.

McNair was hired last week after a long tenure as an executive in Houston to replace Vlade Divac. He backed Walton publicly during his introductory news conference Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019ve got to know him the last few days, we\u2019ve had some good conversations,\u201d McNair said. \u201cI\u2019ve heard great things. So far I think we\u2019ve had a great rapport. Luke\u2019s going to be our coach next year. I\u2019m really excited to work with him. I think we\u2019re aligned with our vision and we\u2019re gonna start implementing it.\u201d Walton is the team\u2019s 10th coach since the Kings last made the playoffs in Rick Adelman\u2019s final season in 2005-06. Sacramento went 31-41 in Walton\u2019s first season at the helm. McNair and Walton will work together to end the 14-year playoff drought that is one year off the longest one in NBA history. \u201cI understand the frustrations of all the loyal Kings fans,\u201d McNair said. \u201cI\u2019ve already seen and heard about their passion. I think we\u2019re aligned on that goal. I was fortunate enough to spend the last 13 years at an organization where we were able to build those winning habits, that culture, where year in and year out we expected to be in the playoffs and compete for championships. My goal is to recreate that here. We\u2019re going to be flexible and just be ready whenever that opportunity arises to really improve the team and get us back into that consistent playoff hunt.\u201d McNair inherits a roster that has some intriguing young pieces but has not been good enough to contend in the Western Conference. Point guard De\u2019Aaron Fox is one of the better young players in the league. Marvin Bagley III, the No. 2 overall pick in 2018, showed flashes as a rookie but struggled with injuries this past season that limited him to 13 games. The Kings also have a pair of talented 3-point shooters in Buddy Hield and restricted free agent Bogdan Bogdanovic as some of the pieces to build around. McNair is a Southern California native who spent 13 years working for the Rockets. He has been the assistant general manager since 2018 and also was integral in the team\u2019s analytics department, working closely with the coaching staff on strategy. The Rockets made the playoffs for eight straight seasons with two trips to the Western Conference final and seven 50-win campaigns thanks to a playing style that relied heavily on 3-point shots. \u201cIn Houston, obviously we pushed some things to the extreme,\u201d McNair said. \u201cThat was partly due to our personnel there. There are some tenets that we\u2019ll apply here. We\u2019re definitely going to play fast and space the floor. There\u2019s a lot of versatility and talent on this roster. I think that\u2019ll dictate how we build the team.\u201d Divac was initially hired by the Kings in March 2013 as vice president of basketball operations and franchise operations. He became general manager in August 2015 but was unable to get the Kings back into the playoffs. He traded DeMarcus Cousins to New Orleans in 2017 and made the decision to draft Bagley second overall in 2018, one spot ahead of Luka Doncic."},{"id":25570,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nba-announces-format-2020-draft-combine-official-release","date":"2020-09-23","title":"NBA announces innovative format for Draft Combine 2020","content":"NEW YORK \u2014 The NBA announced today that NBA Draft Combine 2020 has been reformatted to be conducted both in NBA team markets and virtually, taking place in phases beginning Sept. 28 and continuing through early to mid-November. The reimagined Combine will continue to provide NBA teams with player evaluation opportunities during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. \u201cNBA Draft Combine is an essential part of the pre-draft evaluation process,\u201d said Byron Spruell, President, NBA League Operations. \u201cWhile the circumstances surrounding this Combine are unique, we\u2019re excited to creatively deliver a valuable experience for our teams, who have remained flexible through the process, and for prospective draftees who are just beginning their NBA journeys.\u201d  NBA Draft Combine 2020 will give players the opportunity to participate in league and team interviews, both conducted via videoconference from Sept. 28 through Oct. 16. Players will also take part in an individual on-court program consisting of strength and agility testing, anthropometric measurements, shooting drills and a \u201cPro Day\u201d video, all conducted in October at the NBA team facility nearest to a player\u2019s home or interim residence. Medical testing and examinations will be performed by NBA-affiliated physicians in the same market.

The video, used to showcase a player\u2019s skills, may feature only the individual player (and either a coach or trainer) and can be up to 45 minutes long. HomeCourt is developed by NEX Team, Inc., an NBA strategic partner. Additionally, the NBA has expanded its use of \u201cCombine HQ,\u201d an online tool developed by Fusion Sport in its software platform Smartabase.

You know the ones, always saying in their British accents \u201cAfter you,\u201d \u201cNo, you first\u201d and of course \u201cIndubitably!\u201d Having a healthy respect for one\u2019s opponent is one thing, but Miami\u2019s Erik Spoelstra and Boston\u2019s Brad Stevens are somewhere between mutual admiration society and man-crush in the praise and appreciation they lavish on the job each has done with the Heat and the Celtics, respectively. >> Game 4: Wednesday, 8:30 ET (ESPN) While players will dap up and make small talk after games, in the heat of competition we\u2019ll see everything from angry glares to heated words to actual, aggressive physical contact. Those flagrant fouls and ejections aren\u2019t for nothing, after all. But with the coaches, it\u2019s like they\u2019re providing blurbs for the back covers of each other\u2019s autobiographies. It\u2019s enough to make combative Red Auerbach throw up in his hat. Here\u2019s Stevens talking Tuesday about his Miami counterpart, who holds a 2-1 edge in the series that resumes with Game 4 Wednesday. All bouquets, no brickbats toward the guy whose staff and players are standing between Stevens and his team\u2019s goal. \u201c[I\u2019m] learning every day from Miami,\u201d the Celtics coach said. \u201cI think Erik is tremendous on both sides of the ball. I think that the way that they have morphed their team to play around the strengths of [Bam] Adebayo at the elbow and all those guys cutting off of him, and then to be able to play with [Goran] Dragic or [Jimmy] Butler in pick-and-rolls or isolations or get matchups or whatever, is tremendous. \u201cThen on the defensive end, I think the additions of [Jae] Crowder and [Andre] Iguodala gave them a ton more versatility at the trade deadline [and] made everyone else a better defender because it gave them a little bit more help,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cThe schemes that they\u2019ve put in place make it really hard to find a good shot. I think the world of Erik. I think the world of their whole program. I think they\u2019re tremendous. But that\u2019s the fun part of this.\u201d Spoelstra, meanwhile, has gone out of his way \u2014 particularly after the Heat won the first two games \u2014 to tout Boston as a formidable foe and yield to the impact the Celtics, in being coached-up by Stevens, have had in forcing adjustments on the Heat. \u201cLet\u2019s be real about it. We got down because they were playing great,\u201d Spoelstra said about one hole in which Miami found itself. \u201cThis is a very good team we\u2019re playing against. It\u2019s not as if it was just about us. I would love to say that, \u2018Oh, yeah, we were just kind of going through the motions.\u2019 We weren\u2019t. They were putting it to us. They are a very good defensive team and you have be so detailed and purposeful every single possession against them.\u201d There\u2019s a lot to be said about not giving the other team bulletin board material. But this is the other end of the kudos scale. And it\u2019s not some lame attempt to lull the bad guys into complacency. \u201cYou look at the coaches who are left, the four teams,\u201d former coach Jeff Van Gundy, now an ABC\/ESPN analyst, said. \u201cYou can\u2019t have more humility than those four guys. That doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t have egos or take great pride in their jobs. \u201cBrad and Eric have only known success. But Michael Malone was let go in Sacramento. Frank [Vogel] was let go in Orlando [and Indiana]. And the other two, I just think they have such a healthy respect for coaches and winning, they just have natural humility.\u201d  It\u2019s not just the four still in the bubble, either. It\u2019s hard to find any real rivalries between NBA coaches these days. Certainly not like in the combustible days of Auerbach, Hubie Brown, Don Nelson or George Karl. You don\u2019t see the Pat Riley vs. Phil Jackson bits of one-upsmanship. Or Jackson vs. Van Gundy (never forget his \u201cBig Chief Triangle\u201d crack). \u201cCoaching is great in the NBA now,\u201d Van Gundy said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think the egos of the coaches are as big as they once were. I don\u2019t know why. I just see much greater humility now. And knowing how hard it is to win.\u201d Coaches have as much on the line as players. Pride. Ambition. A consuming desire to be the best. They, too, have multi-million dollar contracts at stake and are far more likely to be fired than players. Yet the fraternal air among the coaches is strong, beyond the end-of-game wave toward the opposite end. One theory Van Gundy offered stems from the NBA\u2019s intervention over the past decade or two. In hitting coaches\u2019 and owners\u2019 wallets. \u201cWhen Commissioner [David] Stern started to heavily fine them for the criticism of officiating, it helped to eliminate that,\u201d Van Gundy said. \u201cBecause when Coach A says what he says about officiating, then Coach B thinks he needs to protect his team. Then it starts to get a little bit contentious.\u201d The intended audience were the referees, complaining about calls the other guys got to plant a seed for the next game. But the other guys often fired back. Van Gundy had wondered if the fans-less bubble of the Disney campus restart might lead to some simultaneous bickering and resentment, but he hasn\u2019t seen it. \u201cI thought there might be more hearing what each other is saying, and working the officials at the same time,\u201d he said.  There\u2019s another big reason Spoelstra and Stevens are so respectful of each other. Game recognizes game, right? They are widely regarded as two of the top five or six coaches in the NBA. Spoelstra, 49, has two rings from the four consecutive Finals he went to, steering the LeBron James-Dwyane Wade-Chris Bosh rock band to the championship round each year from 2011 to 2014. Hired as a video coordinator, he spent 13 years in various Heat roles before taking over in 2008-09 for Riley. His .623 postseason winning percentage ranks fourth in NBA history. \u201cErik has had good teams, he\u2019s had championship-level teams and he\u2019s had lottery teams,\u201d Van Gundy said. \u201cI\u2019m not so sure he hasn\u2019t coached his lottery teams every bit as well as he coached his championship teams.\u201d Stevens, 43, hasn\u2019t won any titles yet or reached a Finals. But his work with Boston\u2019s front office in rebuilding the Celtics has been swift. The former Butler University coach went 25-57 in his first pro season, and has had the Celtics in the playoffs all seven years since. Ironically, the job requiring work and rolled-up sleeves that Doc Rivers no longer wanted in Boston in 2013 hasn\u2019t stopped Stevens from reaching the East finals three times. Rivers has failed to get the LA Clippers to the West finals even once. \u201cWith Brad, he came in, I thought he was extremely good from Day 1,\u201d Van Gundy said. \u201c He didn\u2019t have a good team. Since he\u2019s had a good team, he\u2019s done a great job with good teams, too.\u201d As with most coaches, it\u2019s fair to say that the pecking order for what gets them worked up \u2014 in order, their players, the officials, then the other team\u2019s player \u2014 doesn\u2019t leave much bile for the other team\u2019s coach. Said Van Gundy: \u201cYour team plays against the other team. But you really don\u2019t coach against the other coach. \u201cYou\u2019re coaching to try to get your team and your players to do their very best. Obviously, their best is impacted by what the other team does. But I\u2019ve never bought into the idea that \u2018So-and-so outcoached the other coach.\u2019 Teams outplay other teams, and sometimes you\u2019re upset with things you did or didn\u2019t do. But it\u2019s not like this intense head-to-head competition.\u201d  Typically, coaches are judged against whatever other options they didn\u2019t choose out of a timeout or in a clutch moment. Players used, players rested. Shots drawn up, other plays ignored. It rarely comes down to some chess move with which one coach snookered the other. \u201cIt\u2019s so hard to make all the individual choices you have to make as a coach,\u201d Van Gundy said, \u201cyou don\u2019t have a lot of time to think about, is the other guy annoying you?\u201d * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

That he\u2019s headed to Chicago might be a surprise, only because big and bold moves have been few and far between for the team. Then again, these aren\u2019t the same old Bulls. Chicago struck it big Tuesday, hiring Donovan and landing one of the top candidates on the market to lead a rebuilding team with an overhauled front office. The 55-year-old Donovan spent the past five seasons with the Oklahoma City Thunder. He replaces Jim Boylen, who was fired after the Bulls finished 22-43 and were one of the eight teams that didn\u2019t qualify for the NBA\u2019s restart at Walt Disney World. In a statement, Donovan thanked ownership and said he\u2019s looking forward to working with new executive vice president of basketball operations Arturas Karnisovas. \u201cI\u2019m excited to partner with Arturas as we work together on behalf of this historic franchise,\u201d he said. The Bulls came into the season with their sights set on a playoff spot. They were 11th in the Eastern Conference when play was stopped in March and decided they needed new leadership. Chicago hired Karnisovas as executive vice president of basketball operations in April out of Denver\u2019s front office and shifted John Paxson into an advisory role. The Bulls also brought in general manager Marc Eversley to replace the fired Gar Forman, and they let Boylen go last month. Donovan went 243-157 as coach of the Thunder and reached the playoffs each year. He was a finalist for Coach of the Year this season after his team outperformed expectations and pushed the Houston Rockets to seven games in the first round of the playoffs. But with his contract expiring, the Thunder announced two weeks ago he would not return, saying it was a mutual decision. Before his time with the Thunder, Donovan coached for 19 seasons at the University of Florida, winning two NCAA titles. \u201cWe are very pleased to welcome Billy and his family to the Chicago Bulls,\u201d Karnisovas said. \u201cThe success that he has sustained over the course of his coaching career puts him on a different level. We feel his ability to help his players reach their potential, both individually and collectively, will mesh well with our roster. Whether as a player or as a coach, he has won everywhere his career has taken him, and we hope that will continue here in Chicago.\u201d Donovan inherited All-Stars Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook when he was hired before the 2015-16 season. Oklahoma City reached the Western Conference Finals, squandering a 3-1 lead against Golden State. Durant joined the Warriors after that season, shaking the Thunder and their fans. But Oklahoma City remained competitive. Westbrook averaged triple-doubles the next three seasons and was MVP in 2017. The Thunder traded for Paul George and Carmelo Anthony prior to the 2017-18 season in an effort to challenge Golden State. But they\u2019ve lost in the first round four straight times since that run to the conference finals. They came into this season with lower expectations after trading Westbrook to Houston for Chris Paul and sending George to the Los Angeles Clippers for Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Danilo Gallinari. But they went 44-28 and pushed the Rockets to the brink in the playoffs. The Bulls are counting on Donovan to give them a lift after the team missed the postseason for the fourth time in five years. On the court, the Bulls are led by Zach LaVine, who averaged 25.5 points this season, and Lauri Markkanen, who took a step back. The 7-footer from Finland missed 15 games with a pelvic injury and his scoring and rebounding numbers dropped. Chicago hosted the All-Star game but didn\u2019t have a player selected. That hammered home just how far the Bulls have fallen."},{"id":25575,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/lakers-nuggets-game-3-postgame-column","date":"2020-09-23","title":"Resilient Nuggets bounce back with crucial Game 3 win","content":" ORLANDO, Fla. \u2014 They didn\u2019t wait until they were in dire straights, on the brink of elimination and facing expulsion from the NBA bubble. Nope. Not this time. After fighting off elimination six times in this postseason, the Denver Nuggets opted for an earlier response in the Western Conference finals. The bubble\u2019s most resilient team rebounded from Sunday\u2019s soul-crushing Game 2 loss to the Los Angeles Lakers for an impressive 114-106 Game 3 win Tuesday night at AdventHealth Arena, foiling any notion that this series would end in a sweep. There was some drama, of course, but nothing like that Anthony Davis buzzer-beating 3-pointer Sunday night. This is the Nuggets we\u2019re talking about. Everything about their bubble experience has been filled with in-game dramatics, including Mike Malone\u2019s team being the first in NBA playoff history to rebound from 3-1 deficits to advance multiple times in the same postseason. > Game 4: Lakers vs. Nuggets, Thursday at 9 ET on TNT Jamal Murray clearly does. He had to rescue the Nuggets Tuesday night to secure the win. A 97-77 lead dwindled to 101-98 in the final minutes. The Lakers chewing into that lead behind a furious push by LeBron James, who finished with a 30-point, 10-rebound, 11-assist triple-double. But with the game on the line, Murray kicked it into overdrive. He nailed a 3-pointer with 2:16 to play that pushed a four-point lead back to seven. And closed the door on the Lakers\u2019 rally with another deep 3-pointer with 54 seconds to play to back to double digits. \u201cI think they just kind of picked up their aggressiveness,\u201d Murray said. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I had a good game in total, to be honest with you. I think I didn\u2019t really get everybody organized. Had too many turnovers. Too many live-ball turnovers that led to easy two points. It happened a second time. I thought there were stints in the game where I just could have been a lot better. I can\u2019t have those, like I said, breakdowns for them to come back into the game. Even when they\u2019re playing good defense, I just got to play better. Got to take care of the ball, be shot ready like we all were today, we\u2019ll be fine. I got to have a better game if we want to win.\u201d A team that hasn\u2019t been through what Murray and the Nuggets have the past two seasons might have folded and gone back to their hotel down 3-0. But not these Nuggets. They\u2019ve shown that they are just built different. They don\u2019t recoil at the first sign of pressure. They don\u2019t crumble when things get tight, the way the game did in the fourth quarter. \u201cThe clock starts moving really slow, especially when you have LeBron putting his head down and driving, and Anthony Davis out there,\u201d Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. \u201cBut we know there\u2019s a lot of time left. No lead is safe, especially against a team like that. I\u2019m not sure what they cut it to, whether it\u2019s one or three, but it got to be really close. That\u2019s when I was proud that we gave up our lead, but we didn\u2019t collapse. We withstood their run, their punch. We had the poise to get ourselves out of it. That\u2019s the sign of a team that\u2019s been in a lot of close games and has won a lot of close games in the last three, four years.\u201d How about the last three or four weeks? The Nuggets have already gutted out two Game 7s here in the bubble, knocking off Utah in the first round and upsetting the LA Clippers in the conference semifinals . They\u2019ve done it with a devastating dose of Murray (28 points, 12 assists) and All-NBA center Nikola Jokic (22 points, 12 rebounds) and whomever else spikes from a deep supporting cast on a given night. It was Jerami Grant in Game 3. The veteran forward scored a playoff career-high 26 points and was a factor on both ends, guarding James and Davis. \u201cOh, we\u2019d be down 3-0, that\u2019s the bottom line,\u201d Malone said when asked where the Nuggets would be right now without Grant\u2019s monster night. \u201cJerami was spectacular. Twenty-six points, got to the foul line 12 times, made 10. Had really good defensive possessions guarding some of the best players in the world. \u201cWe knew going in what we were going to get every night from Nikola, Jamal. You always wonder who is going to step up and be that third scorer. For us tonight obviously Jerami came through in a big, big way at both ends of the floor. Proud of Jerami. Great to see him have some success offensively because he\u2019s been working so hard at it. His hard work paid off tonight.\u201d The Nuggets know they let Game 2 slip away. They fought back, much like the Lakers did using a zone defense in the fourth quarter, but got burned on that Davis buzzer-beater. The Lakers didn\u2019t get close enough to rekindle that magic Tuesday night. \u201cDenver came in and played exceptionally well,\u201d James said. \u201cThey played better than us, more aggressive than us through three quarters, 36 minutes, but you know, we\u2019ve got into the penalty in the third quarter with like nine and a half minutes to go and we had some turnovers that led to some easy buckets for them. We had 16 turnovers for 25 points and put them to the line 29 times. It\u2019s not going to be winning ingredients for us if we continue to do that and we knew that, even after Game 2, we talked about that, trying to assure that. Got to be better than that Game 4.\u201d The Nuggets would be wise to save the rest-and-recovery blueprint Malone utilized during Game 3. \u201c(Monday) when we met and we watched the film, I started off by watching the last play of the game,\u201d Malone said. \u201cGet the elephant in the room out of the way. Let\u2019s talk about the play, what happened. When we\u2019re in this situation again, let\u2019s learn from it. Yes, we all take ownership. Let\u2019s learn from it. \u201cAfter that, my goal was when we got done with that film, they saw so many positive clips of us doing the right things, which put us in a position to win. Now we had to do that for more than just a second half. We had to do it for four quarters. Tonight we did it at a high level for three. The fourth quarter we\u2019ll work on our zone offense tomorrow and taking care of the basketball. But very resilient group. I think this group has proven that.\u201d With his team operating at its confident best, they looked every bit the Lakers\u2019 equal. The same way they found another level against the heavily-favored Clippers in the previous round, they\u2019ll need to find and sustain that level to continually trade blows with the Lakers the way they did to win Game 3. Malone, of course, never doubted his resilient crew. \u201cYeah, I had no doubt that we were going to show up tonight,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reason I didn\u2019t have any doubt is because we won six straight elimination games. Everybody always has us packing our bags and leaving, but we\u2019re not ready to go. For some reason we love this bubble. I can\u2019t explain that, but this team loves the bubble.\u201d * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

The Lakers are just an Anthony Davis Game 2 buzzer-beater from flipping their 2-1 advantage into a 1-2 deficit, and now the search begins in-house to discover why this is the case. They were out-hustled and outplayed through much of Game 3, save for a fourth-quarter flurry triggered by \u201cPlayoff\u201d Rajon Rondo, which briefly put a scare in the Nuggets before Jamal Murray perked up and Denver prevailed 114-106 . There\u2019s perhaps a sense of resignation in Laker World because this won\u2019t be a sweep, yet L.A. still brings Davis and LeBron James, so there\u2019s no trace of panic. This remains LeBron\u2019s series to lose. Yeah, but \u2026 Did the Lakers, after six straight wins, simply ease their foot off the pedal Tuesday? Or is there a simmering of Laker issues that, if not properly addressed, could give the Comeback Nuggets another reason to believe in themselves? Maybe it\u2019s a combination of both. > Game 4: Lakers vs. Nuggets, Thursday at 9 ET on TNT When a team that flaunts a pair of first-team All-NBA members rips through the first two rounds, and then sees their supposed biggest threat in the West \u2014 that would be the Clippers \u2014 get eliminated, then perhaps human nature takes over and a bit of overconfidence seeps in. You couldn\u2019t blame the Lakers for that; happens every year to someone. \u201cWe didn\u2019t come out aggressively or physically,\u201d said Davis. \u201cWe know we have to play from start to finish.\u201d If that\u2019s what they\u2019re guilty of more than anything else, then their problems are resolvable, certainly after the Nuggets just got their attention. But there are a few annoying headaches that will make things harder for the Lakers (if not in this series, then in the NBA Finals should they advance that far). At the very top is Kyle Kuzma. Before the playoffs, coach Frank Vogel said Kuzma \u201cmust be our third-best player.\u201d There are times when Kuzma isn\u2019t the third-best player off the bench. He\u2019s still an enigma wrapped in a riddle, a seasonlong tease, a skilled player who every now and then will escape the fog that suffocates him, but mostly doesn\u2019t. On the other bench Tuesday, the Nuggets got a breakout game from Jerami Grant and saw some glimmer from Monte Morris. Basically, someone other than Murray and Nikola Jokic surfaced for Denver and that\u2019s largely why they won. Meanwhile, Kuzma had a soft 11 points and one rebound in 26 minutes and was mostly invisible. There was one hair-pulling moment when, in the final minutes while the Lakers furiously rallied to come within three points, Kuzma pump-faked a wide-open shot. With the exception of one game in each of the first two rounds \u2014 that\u2019s two games out of 13 now \u2014 Kuzma had what could be classified as an impact. Nothing major, but reasonable. Isn\u2019t he supposed to be a difference-making third-wheel who feasts on open shots and takes advantage of having LeBron and AD command all the attention? Another issue for the Lakers, and this isn\u2019t breaking news here, is their 3-point shooting. In Game 3, they took 26 from deep and made six. Aside from the poor percentage, the Lakers settled too often on lazy 3s. That played right into the Nuggets\u2019 hands. Remember, L.A.\u2019s size was and is to its advantage. When the Lakers refuse to \u201cplay big,\u201d the Nuggets can compete more comfortably with them. Danny Green was supposed to supply that element to this team \u2014 that\u2019s why they gave him a three-year contract last summer \u2014 yet he\u2019s 5-for-17 so far against the Nuggets. If he doesn\u2019t make the shot, Vogel can\u2019t justify keeping him on the floor. Finally, the Lakers may go the entire series without finding a defensive solution for Murray. This was largely expected; Murray is on a major roll in these playoffs and the Jazz and Clippers had no answer for him, either. When his team began to crumble and shiver late in the fourth quarter Tuesday, Murray bailed them out with killer shots to preserve the win. There is something that\u2019s working for the Lakers as a bonus: Vogel\u2019s decision to put Rondo on Jokic for a handful of late possessions. On paper that seems a silly strategy; Jokic is almost a foot taller. But Jokic rarely sets up on the post. He plays high, and therefore right into Rondo\u2019s hands. When Jokic has the ball, Rondo is daring him to dribble, and Jokic was clearly uncomfortable doing so in that situation. He knows Rondo will go for the steal \u2014 Rondo had a pair of steals, albeit off Murray, that nearly stole the game for L.A. Jokic was spooked by that; he didn\u2019t even try to dribble or back Rondo down, and he didn\u2019t score a basket with Rondo guarding him. \u201cHe\u2019s our best activity-communicator, with his gambling and what not,\u201d Vogel said of Rondo. \u201cHe was a huge part of that run.\u201d Finally, the Lakers bamboozled the Nuggets with a 2-3 zone that aided the fourth-quarter comeback. Expect L.A. to revisit this again if necessary, although the Nuggets will surely watch the tape and try to counter with something. \u201cYou\u2019re looking for something to give your team a spark,\u201d explained Vogel, \u201cto change the game. It worked down the stretch but the hole we dug ourselves was too much to overcome.\u201d Before the game, Vogel joked how the Lakers needed to adjust to the high altitude in Denver for this game. Well, that was good for a few yuks. Weirdly, the Lakers then went and appeared out of gas in Orlando. Their issues are fixable. But they might want to get the toolbox out right away, before the plucky Nuggets get drunk on confidence and make a brave attempt to go a shocking two-for-two against L.A. basketball teams. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

(AP) \u2014 NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said Tuesday that his \u201cbest guess\u201d is that next season will not start until at least January, plus acknowledged that the later-than-usual schedule could mean top U.S. men\u2019s players miss next summer\u2019s Tokyo Olympics. Silver, a guest in a series of panel discussions on CNN, did not indicate that any decisions are finalized. The league was originally hoping for a Dec. 1 start to next season, then shifted its focus to the chance of a late December start, and now the target has apparently moved again. \u201cI continue to believe that we\u2019re going to be better off getting into January,\u201d Silver said in a discussion with Bob Costas during part of the \u201cCitizen by CNN\u201d event. \u201cThe goal for us next season is to play a standard season \u2026 an 82-game season and playoffs.

A very small number of fans \u2014 maybe 30 or 40 per game \u2014 have been allowed to watch inside the NBA\u2019s restart bubble at Walt Disney World in recent weeks, all of them family members or close friends of players. Those guests all are tested daily for coronavirus, like everyone else in the bubble. A typical NBA season has a regular season that lasts for nearly six months, followed by about a two-month postseason. If next season is typical \u2014 and there\u2019s no way of knowing that it will be, or even could be \u2014 a January start could mean a June or July regular-season finish, with playoffs concluding in August or September. That could greatly affect Olympic plans. The rescheduled Tokyo Olympics are set to begin July 23 and run through Aug. 8 \u2014 if those games are held. Final qualifying rounds for the 24 teams still bidding for the four remaining spots in the 12-team men\u2019s basketball field would begin in June. \u201cThere are a lot of great U.S. players, and we may be up against a scenario where the top 15 NBA players aren\u2019t competing in the Olympics, but other great American players are competing,\u201d Silver said. \u201cAnd, obviously, there are many NBA players who participate in the Olympics for other countries. That\u2019s something we\u2019re going to have to work through.\u201d USA Basketball has been planning for various possible scenarios in recent months but can\u2019t make any concrete plans until it sees what the next NBA schedule officially looks like. The U.S. roster for the Tokyo Olympics will be 12 players; there were another 34 players competing for other countries at the Rio Olympics as well. Several NBA coaches are also planning to coach in the Tokyo Olympics or in qualifying: San Antonio\u2019s Gregg Popovich will coach USA Basketball and be assisted by Golden State\u2019s Steve Kerr and Atlanta\u2019s Lloyd Pierce; Golden State associate head coach Mike Brown is set to coach Nigeria; Toronto assistant Sergio Scariolo will coach Spain and Raptors head coach Nick Nurse will lead Canada in qualifying and then the Olympics should it qualify. \u201cThese are highly unique and unusual circumstances,\u201d Silver said. \u201cAnd I think just as it is for the Olympic movement, it is for us as well. And we\u2019re just going to have to sort of find a way to meld and mesh those two competing considerations.\u201d The U.S., Nigeria, Australia, Spain, Argentina, Iran, France and host Japan have qualified for the Olympic men\u2019s basketball field already. Among the top international teams still hoping to qualify: Greece (which could have two-time reigning NBA MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo), Serbia (led by Denver\u2019s All-NBA center Nikola Jokic), Lithuania, Russia and the Czech Republic."},{"id":25557,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/romeo-langford-has-season-ending-wrist-surgery","date":"2020-09-22","title":"Celtics' Romeo Langford has season-ending wrist surgery","content":" BOSTON, MA \u2013 Celtics guard Romeo Langford this morning underwent successful surgery to repair the scapholunate ligament in his right wrist.

They just didn\u2019t give us a look at it. That lineup \u2013 Kemba Walker, Marcus Smart, Jaylen Brown, Gordon Hayward and Jayson Tatum \u2013 kind of won the game. In an 11-point victory that made it a 2-1 series, the Celtics\u2019 best-five lineup was a plus-13 in its 6:35 of playing time. It\u2019s a small sample size and the last 30 seconds (in which the Celtics outscored the Heat, 6-2) was Miami fouling intentionally. But small sample sizes are what you get in the playoffs and its certainly an intriguing sample for a lineup that could see more time going forward. Every possession counts, even more so in this series, which has been played at the second slowest pace ( 94.4 possessions per team per 48 minutes ) of the 14 series in these playoffs. All three games have been within five points in the last five minutes (though Game 3 was only a \u201cclutch\u201d game for nine seconds). In the postseason overall, nine of Miami\u2019s 12 games and 11 of Boston\u2019s 14 have been within five in the last five. Celtics coach Brad Stevens went to his best-five lineup late in each half, standard practice for super-lineups that include at least one guy off the bench (see the Thunder\u2019s best-five lineup from this season). And it made an immediate impact late in the second quarter when Smart checked in for Daniel Theis as Hayward put the Celtics up four with the second of two free throws. The small lineup is obviously more skilled than one with Theis, Enes Kanter or Grant Williams at center. It\u2019s also quicker. And you can certainly credit the added quickness for what happened in the first 63 seconds after the Celtics went small: Three stops and three fast breaks, pushing that four-point lead to a 10-point cushion: Play 1: Walker chases Tyler Herro around three screens, denies him the catch and pushes him 30 feet from the basket. Jimmy Butler enters the ball to Bam Adebayo at the left elbow. Herro fakes a cross-screen for Butler and slips to the basket, but Walker stays with him. Brown switches an outside hand-off for Butler and takes the ball away, leading to a dunk for Tatum. Play 2: Herro gets Walker off his tail with a dance move in the paint before using a cross-screen from Butler and taking a hand-off from Adebayo. With Walker trailing, Brown probably isn\u2019t aggressive enough in switching out to contest Herro\u2019s left-wing 3. But it\u2019s off the mark and the Heat (especially Goran Dragic in the weak-side corner) are slow to react. This time, Tatum pitches ahead to Brown for a dunk. Play 3: Adebayo flashes to the top of the key and Brown comes from behind to deflect Butler\u2019s entry pass, leading to a third straight fast break. There\u2019s an argument to be made that the Miami offense is defended better with quickness than with (interior) size. In the regular season, the Heat took only 29% of their shots , the league\u2019s fourth lowest rate, in the restricted area. In the playoffs, that number is below 26% . (League-wide, the percentage of shots that have come in the restricted area is down from 33.0% in the regular season to just 27.9% in the playoffs. Utah was the only team that saw a jump.) Of course, Smart is willing to play rim protector in that small lineup if needed \u2026  The Celtics did have some size issues with their small lineups, which included 1:49 of the fourth quarter (after Theis picked up his fifth foul) with Brad Wanamaker in place of either Hayward or Tatum . Maybe Theis contests this Butler spin move if he\u2019s in Tatum\u2019s place (guarding Kelly Olynyk) \u2026  And having both Walker and Wanamaker on the floor gave Butler two bully-ball targets after a switch \u2026  Switching more of Adebayo\u2019s screens (instead of having Theis try to contain and recover) could prevent some of his clean rolls to the rim. He did score on a jump hook over Hayward after a switch early in the fourth quarter, but did the same thing to Theis on the very next possession. Having Adebayo screen for Walker\u2019s man and roll quickly would put the Celtics in more of a scramble situation, which they can mitigate by pressuring the ball as much as possible after the switch to make the initial pass tougher\/higher\/slower. There was more good than bad on that end of the floor when the Celtics played small in Game 3. If you discount Miami\u2019s last two desperation 3-point attempts, the best-five lineup allowed 13 points on 15 defensive possessions. Six of those 13 were a result of the Celtics just not being aware of Duncan Robinson, once in transition and once after an offensive rebound . When the Celtics weren\u2019t turning turnovers into fast breaks (there was another midway through the fourth quarter), they were matchup hunting with the small lineup. They mostly went at Herro, both in the second quarter (with Tatum) and in the fourth (with both Tatum and Walker). One of the biggest shots of the game was a Walker corner 3 after Herro contained an isolation, but lost him off the ball. Having more skill on the floor allows the Celtics more matchup-hunting options. They can isolate with Walker, Tatum or Hayward. They can post-up Smart \u2026  \u2026 and Brown is one of the best fill-in-the-gaps players in the league. If you ignore the last 30 seconds in which the Heat intentionally fouled Smart three times, the Celtics\u2019 best-five lineup scored 20 points on 13 offensive possessions on Saturday. As noted, eight of those points came on four fast breaks. None of those possessions were against the Miami zone. Game 4 on Wednesday ( 8:30 p.m. ET, ESPN ) will provide more wrinkles on both sides of the ball. The Celtics need another win to even the series, and certainly won\u2019t go down without putting their best five guys on the floor. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

(AP) \u2014 Denny Hamlin is starting his own race car team in partnership with Charlotte Hornets owner Michael Jordan and Bubba Wallace as the driver. Hamlin, a three-time Daytona 500 winner and top contender for this year\u2019s Cup title, made the announcement on social media. The team will be a single-car Toyota entry aligned with Joe Gibbs Racing. \u201cEleven years ago I met Michael Jordan at a then-Charlotte Bobcats game and we became fast friends,\u201d Hamlin wrote. \u201cNot long after, I joined Jordan Brand as their first NASCAR athlete. Our friendship has grown over the years and now we are ready to take it to the next level. \u201cDeciding on the driver was easy \u2014 it had to be Bubba Wallace.\u201d Hamlin said additional details would be forthcoming. Wallace is the only Black driver at NASCAR\u2019s top level. There\u2019s been speculation for months that Hamlin was organizing some sort of ownership group as he expects NASCAR\u2019s business model to become more favorable for team owners when the \u201cNext Gen\u201d car is released in 2022. NASCAR rules prohibit a current driver from owning a team and driving for another, but Hamlin works around the policy with Jordan as the primary owner. Jordan became a partial owner of the Bobcats in 2006 and bought the team outright in 2010, restoring the franchise to its original Hornets name. Hamlin has been a longtime season-ticket holder with courtside seats along the visitors\u2019 bench. Jordan has twice traveled to the NASCAR season finale to watch Hamlin race for the championship. Hamlin, who\u2019s 39, is still seeking his first title. Wallace, who has cobbled together about $18 million in sponsorship deals since he made social equality his platform, already said he\u2019d leave Richard Petty Motorsports at the end of the season. \u201cThis is a unique, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that I believe is a great fit for me at this point in my career,\u201d Wallace wrote in a social media post coordinated with Hamlin\u2019s. \u201cI am grateful and humbled that they believe in me and I\u2019m super pumped to begin this adventure with them.\u201d"},{"id":25621,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/anthony-davis-lakers-possessions-count","date":"2020-09-22","title":"Anthony Davis knows every Lakers possession crucial this deep into playoffs","content":" Awash in the euphoria of the moment, Anthony Davis looked over to his right when a question regarding the significance of every single possession at this stage of the postseason caught his attention. The Lakers own a 2-0 series lead over the Denver Nuggets in the Western Conference finals and are 9-0 thus far in these playoffs in Games 2 through 5. That doesn\u2019t mean L.A. expects an easy ride the rest of the way against a Denver squad that is the only team in NBA history to have overcome two 3-1 series deficits in the same playoffs. > Game 3: Lakers vs. Nuggets, Tuesday at 9 ET on TNT \u201cTeams are great at this level [which have] made it this far,\u201d Davis said. \u201cPlayers are a lot better than teams you might see in the first round. This guy to my left (LeBron James) is a constant reminder of how we should play, the details, and what it takes to win championships. He constantly preaches that in the timeouts and the film room because he\u2019s been there. We want to be there, too. So, details matter. It\u2019s definitely a possessions game when you get this late in the playoffs.\u201d In his eighth NBA season, Davis is playing in his first conference finals. After perusing the box score on the heels of hitting the game-winner at the buzzer of the Lakers\u2019 105-103 win on Sunday, Davis lamented his team giving Denver 23 extra possessions by way of turnovers that the Nuggets turned into 19 points. Those 23 turnovers marked a postseason high for Los Angeles. \u201cEvery possession does matter,\u201d Davis said. \u201cTwenty-four turnovers [actually 23] tonight. We gave them 24 more possessions. We turned the ball over. We\u2019ve got to get shots at the rim. Things like that matter. Details matter because now teams will make you pay. Teams are already good enough to get this far that they\u2019re going to make plays. If when we have mistakes defensively, breakdowns offensively, not talking, not sprinting back on defense or whatever, and we give them extra points, then we make it a lot harder for us to win a game. So, you never want to give them extra possessions.\u201d The Nuggets, meanwhile, feel optimistic about slowing down the Lakers in transition in Game 2, as that was a main point of emphasis headed into the contest. Los Angeles scored just eight points on fast breaks in Game 2, after reeling off 16 points off the break in Game 1. Coach Michael Malone believes that improvement is what allowed Denver to remain competitive in a game that it trailed by as many as 16 points, before taking a one-point lead with just 20.8 ticks remaining on a Nikola Jokic tip-in. Davis\u2019 game-winning buzzer-beater marked Los Angeles\u2019 first in the postseason since Metta World Peace accomplished the feat in the 2010 NBA Finals, and gave Denver its first 2-0 series deficit under Malone. Since coming into the NBA bubble, the Nuggets are 5-7 on the heels of a loss. \u201cWe did a much better job of taking away their transition,\u201d Malone said. \u201cThat was a huge point of emphasis going in. So, to clean that up allowed us to be in the game. I thought our defense in that second half was tremendous. Our defense will keep us in games. We\u2019re 8-8 in the postseason. In our eight wins, the defense has been great. Defensive transition was tremendous. If we can continue that, we\u2019ll continue to give ourselves a chance.\u201d Denver also increases its prospects if it can find a way to keep Jokic plugging away in the face of all the adversity he\u2019s faced this postseason. In the opening round, Jokic emerged victorious in tough battles against two-time Defensive Player of the year Rudy Gobert, only to work against Ivica Zubac in the conference semifinals against the L.A. Clippers, as well as Sixth Man of the Year Montrezl Harrell. Now, Jokic faces a three-headed monster of Lakers bigs in Davis, Dwight Howard and JaVale McGee. Although he\u2019s held his own against that trio through the first two games, it\u2019s logical to question whether Jokic can keep up the production on both ends for the rest of the series against so much front-court depth. Led by James\u2019 11 boards, the Lakers out-rebounded Denver 44-31 in Game 2. \u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t think about it,\u201d said Jokic, who scored 12 of his team-high 30 points in the fourth quarter of Game 2. \u201cWhoever is over there, I\u2019m going to try to beat him and try to win the game. It is what it is. Like I said: It\u2019s not just me against them. It\u2019s Nuggets against Lakers. We are underdogs. We need to fight. That\u2019s our only chance.\u201d Malone expressed a similar sentiment headed into Tuesday\u2019s Game 3. Going back to the regular season, the Lakers are 5-1 against the Nuggets and are in the midst of a six-game postseason winning streak. \u201cThe message is we\u2019re down 2-0. Let\u2019s go out and win Game 3,\u201d Malone said. \u201cThat\u2019s been our mindset in the first round, the second round and we\u2019re in the same situation here. Whether you\u2019re down 3-1 or 2-0, obviously, next game is the biggest game for us. Some guys like to win. Some guys hate to lose. I think we\u2019re a group of guys that hates to lose. Even though we\u2019re disappointed, we\u2019re frustrated, we\u2019re angry, we\u2019ll use that motivation to come out and try to take Game 3.\u201d * * * Michael C.

Brendan Malone has fingerprints on both, as the father of Michael and the former coach of LeBron James. The elder Malone spent nearly 30 years on NBA benches, most famously at the hip of Chuck Daly during the Detroit Pistons\u2019 championship years of the 1980s and early 90s. He was the inaugural coach of the Toronto Raptors and, for 18 games, was interim coach in Cleveland during LeBron\u2019s second season. Malone was briefly also an assistant with the Sacramento in 2013, the same year his son, Michael, was in his first season coaching the Kings. With all those years comes wisdom, and Brendan Malone is long valued for his honest and refreshing take on the game, for being a confidant to players and coaches, and obviously for his knowledge. He agreed to offer his take on his son\u2019s development, a teenaged LeBron, the Nuggets-Lakers series so far, what made Daly great, his analysis of the LeBron-or-Michael Jordan debate with a surprising answer to that \u2026 and how the Secret Service lost a chance to hire the right man to protect U.S. Presidents. * ** Q: The Nuggets are down 0-2 but we\u2019ve seen this movie before. Are you surprised by how they\u2019ve rebounded throughout the playoffs, fighting back from 3-1 to Utah and the LA Clippers? A: This didn\u2019t happen overnight. This is the maturation of Nikola Jokic and Jamal Murray being a tandem, especially in pick and rolls, and the other players maturing. They were down 3-1 against what many thought was the best team in the NBA and showed some grit. I think Murray scared me in the first few games in the Utah series because he wasn\u2019t looking to shoot and then he became aggressive. If he gets on a roll he\u2019s hard to stop. Very much impressed with the team. They have to become better defensively if they want to go anywhere. Jokic has to become a rim protector. Murray has to become a better perimeter defender. When and if they become good defenders they will be ready to make the next step. What about your son? He has developed along with the team, correct? I\u2019m impressed with Michael\u2019s coaching and his matchups and the way he uses his bench. He\u2019s been there for five years and each year he has become a better coach. He\u2019s controlling his emotions on the sidelines. The team\u2019s success is a reflection of coaching. He knows that when the game\u2019s on the line he has to go to the two-man game with Murray and Jokic on the high pick and roll. It\u2019s very difficult to guard. You\u2019ve got Murray coming off a 3-point shot and if Jokic flashes he\u2019s going to be open for a 3-point shot. He has that figured out. His substitutions are also very good. Did you try to discourage Michael from seeking this profession? Including college and the NBA, you coached in 10 different places, so he had to see the rigors first-hand. It\u2019s not easy on a family. I wanted him to go get married and have kids. But after he graduated from college and I was with the Pistons, he was living with us and got a call from Greg Kampe, the coach at Oakland University in Detroit, to be a volunteer assistant. Michael helped clean the gym to supplement his salary, and sometimes Barry Sanders would come by and they\u2019d play one-on-one. Then he just decided to be a Secret Service agent. Secret Service? That\u2019s a drastically different gig. But he went through basic training in 1995 to get the law enforcement experience needed for the job, right? He took the physical and the mental exams and passed. But before this, he \u2019 d written letters to a lot of head coaches for jobs, and the first coach who answered was Dean Smith, who didn\u2019t offer him anything. Well, Michael was two weeks away from going to the barracks when Pete Gillen, the coach at Providence College, called the house. I thought he wanted to talk to me and Pete said no I want to talk to Michael. He offered Michael a job. Michael didn \u2019 t go to the Secret Service. What kind of Secret Service agent would he have been? (Laughs) Well, he\u2019s a serious guy. I\u2019ll just say he would\u2019ve taken the job very seriously and been someone you wouldn\u2019t want to mess with. The coaching business is all about making connections. After Michael reached a dead end following his short stay as an assistant with the Knicks, another coach gave him a shot, right? That summer Brett Brown and Michael went to Argentina with Basketball Without Borders. Brown was [Spurs coach] Gregg Popovich\u2019s assistant coach with the Spurs. Popovich went down there to visit Manu Ginobili. Popovich, Brown and Michael went out to dinner every night. Popovich got to know Michael. After they came home Popovich called Mike Brown, who just got the job at Cleveland, and said, `You got to hire Michael as your assistant,\u2019 and he did. Mike Brown gave him a lot of responsibility. Your son\u2019s first head coaching job was in Sacramento but it ended badly, with Michael being fired 24 games into his second season. The Kings were a dysfunctional organization with lots of infighting and many believed Michael got a raw deal. I suppose you agree? I was angry. There were people there who had selfish motives. He was the only guy who could coach DeMarcus Cousins, who loved playing for Michael. They had a rapport. Right after Michael got the job he went down to Alabama to visit Cousins, stayed with his family. When they fired him, they mentioned his tempo. Well if he played up-tempo they would \u2019 ve been playing away from Cousins. He was smart enough to know you had to play through Cousins. He wasn \u2019 t a fast-break coach because his best player was his center and didn \u2019 t want the team to be running up the court while this guy was running from the back. I know this much: After seeing him come back 3-1 down twice in the playoffs, the people in Sacramento are saying, \u2018Why did we get rid of Michael M alone? \u2019 What was it like coaching a young LeBron? He was very competitive, an extremely hard worker and very smart even then. He wanted to win every drill. He was still developing, though. I tried to get the ball to him down low and he was not comfortable then. Right now he\u2019s a good low post player, but at that time he wasn\u2019t.  As an assistant with the Pistons, you helped devise a plan to stop Michael Jordan 30 years ago and it was termed \u201cThe Jordan Rules.\u201d What would be \u201cThe LeBron Rules?\u201d I don \u2019 t think any coach in the NBA has come up with that answer yet. He \u2019 s probably the best player in the open court. He \u2019 s so fast and strong going to the basket. He can finish. His best skill is passing. I would take away the drive, give him the 3-pointer, and if he goes to the basket, foul him because he\u2019s not a high percentage free throw shooter. Well, does this mean LeBron is better than Jordan, in your opinion? People ask me who was better: Michael Jordan or LeBron? And I always say you\u2019re asking the wrong question. Who was better, Kobe Bryant or Michael? I would say LeBron is in the conversation of course. There\u2019s a lot of people who would put LeBron ahead of Kobe. And some would put LeBron ahead of Michael. I saw how competitive Michael was. LeBron is competitive but didn\u2019t come up to the level as Michael. And the guy closest to Michael in that sense is Kobe. How would Jordan do in today\u2019s game, with no hand-checking or physical tactics that he endured when going up against Rick Mahorn and Bill Laimbeer? If you gave him that kind of freedom, he could flirt with 50 points every game if he wanted to. At the risk of having a second Malone coach this series, how should the Nuggets handle LeBron and Anthony Davis? Denver doesn\u2019t have a lock-down defender who can guard either one of those guys. What you have to do is play one-on-one and do the best you can. The temptation is to double team Davis and LeBron, but then you leave people open. Davis and LeBron are going to score their points; they may score 60 together. You can\u2019t let Dwight Howard have 13 points as he did in the first game and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope go for 18 or 19. You \u2019 ve got to shut down the other players and if you can do that, I think they can be successful. What did you think of your son\u2019s plea to have family members of the coaches visit at the Disney campus, as the players were allowed? He was hurt that some coaches didn\u2019t back him up and didn\u2019t support his position. Some coaches thought he was out of place. Look, he missed his wife and two girls. It\u2019s not easy being there alone. He rides a bike 20 miles every day in that bubble. He\u2019d go back to his room and felt alone. And what about a week ago when Michael Porter Jr. publicly talked about being more involved in the offense? How did your son react? Porter\u2019s a young man learning how to play. He has to learn to keep everything in the locker room. He says give me the ball. Well, they don \u2019 t run plays. It \u2019 s a free-flow offense. If you can hit Jokic and then cut, Jokic is always going to find you. Porter had to get himself involved in the offense. He hadn \u2019 t learned that yet. I think he \u2019 s learned a lesson. And I credit Michael for not blowing it up. He handled the situation pretty good. What\u2019s the best advice you ever gave your son? The best thing you can do as a coach is to instill confidence in your team. Always be in the foxhole with them when they\u2019re going through bad times. You have to pick them up after they \u2019 re down. Some coaches, and I don \u2019 t want to name names, were always with you when you won but didn \u2019 t want any part of you when you lost. I told Mic hael to be the same coach after a win and loss. The players have to feel you care about them individually.  Does this remind you of anyone? One of the best coaches who ever did that was Chuck Daly. We were walking one time and he said, `I\u2019m not the greatest X-and-O guy but coaching in the NBA is a people person business. You have to get along with your players, the general manager and the press.\u2019 That\u2019s what Chuck did. He subordinated his ego to the team\u2019s ego. That\u2019s what made him a success. What\u2019s the best advice you ever gave LeBron? Actually I would turn that question around. When we were struggling in Cleveland, I asked LeBron for advice. He was young but he knew the game, even then. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years. You can e-mail him  here , find his archive here   and follow him on  Twitter  .

Two seconds left with the Lakers trailing by a point in Game 2 of the Western Conference finals . Of course, he wants the ball, wants to take the shot that the great ones take, the one the champions and legends make. Davis drained the \u201cbiggest shot of his career thus far,\u201d his 3-pointer at the buzzer delivering the Lakers a 105-103 win over the Denver Nuggets for a 2-0 lead in this series. Two wins away from that biggest of stages that Davis has been yearning for. > Game 3: Lakers vs. Nuggets, Tuesday at 9 ET on TNT The celebration inside AdventHealth Arena was muted compared to what it might have been in a crowded Staples Center with a raucous home crowd joining in on the pandemonium that left Lakers rookie Talen Horton-Tucker flattened after Davis leaped into a crowd of his teammates after the buzzer sounded. Lakers coach Frank Vogel called it a \u201cMamba Shot.\u201d The Lakers were wearing their \u201cBlack Mamba\u201d uniforms, in honor of the late Kobe Bryant. And Davis channeled his inner-Kobe in that moment. He didn\u2019t hesitate, rising and firing the way the Lakers icon Bryant did so many times during his Hall of Fame career. \u201cWell, we want to embody what Kobe Bryant stood for and honor his memory,\u201d Vogel said after Davis saved the Lakers from squandering a 16-point lead and control of the series . \u201cObviously, there are certain games where we are going to feel it a little bit more than others. When we have that uniform on, I think we feel it more than others. That\u2019s a shot Kobe Bryant would hit. To me, AD coming off just flying to the wing like that, catch-and-shoot with the biggest game on the line of our season, nothing but net, it\u2019s a Mamba shot.\u201d Davis yelled \u201cKobe!\u201d after the shot swished through the net. \u201cI did. You know, I mean, obviously wearing the jerseys. He\u2019s hit countless shots like that to win games, whether it\u2019s in the playoffs, Finals,\u201d Davis said. \u201cBut it was a special one for me. Special one for my teammates. I told \u2018Bron, in L.A., right before the hiatus against the Brooklyn Nets, same spot, slightly different play and I missed a shot. I was upset with myself. And he said, \u2018Man, we gonna live or die with you shooting that shot.\u2019 I got the same opportunity tonight. Ready to make it. \u201cSpecial moment for me. Special moment for the team. Especially in a situation like trying to go up 2-0 against a special team who are great competitors and going to fight for the entire 48 minutes. To do something like that, and with the jersey we wore tonight, it just makes it even more special.\u201d Special is the only way to describe what Davis is doing in the deepest playoff run of his career. He smoked the Nuggets for 37 points in Game 1 and 31 Sunday night. He was the only Lakers player to score in the final five minutes. And his final shot, of course, was the most significant to date in this postseason run for the Lakers. \u201cJust a big-time shot by a big-time player,\u201d Vogel said. \u201c We have a set where we can basically isolate LeBron on a baseline out-of-bounds situation like that. [Rajon] Rondo came up and whispered in my ear about do I want him in there as a passer, and obviously I said heck yes. He made a great read on it, and Anthony flew over to the wing. We talked about missing that shot, similar type of shot, against Brooklyn before the hiatus. Like I said, big-time shot by a big-time player.\u201d Rondo called it the biggest shot of Davis\u2019 career, so far, and Davis agreed. Rondo would know, having played with Davis in New Orleans in the only other significant postseason run of his career (the Pelicans made it to the conference semifinals in 2018). So he understood the magnitude of this moment for Davis, the man who led the Lakers in 13 statistical categories in his first season playing alongside James. He had no doubt Davis would come through. \u201cAD had it going in the second half. He was scoring from inside out, and fortunately came through in the end,\u201d Rondo said. \u201cBut he\u2019s arguably the best scorer in our game. He\u2019s 7 feet tall. He can take bigs off the dribble. He can post smalls. He\u2019s a foul magnet and shoots 99 percent from the line, so he\u2019s definitely a great option to have. And also LeBron, 1A or 1B, it doesn\u2019t matter. You have two guys on the floor who can draw fouls or get a wide-open look. \u201cHe\u2019s always been dominant force for any opponent he\u2019s ever played against. But to see him grow and hit a shot in this type of environment, the Western Conference finals, it doesn\u2019t get any bigger than this. I\u2019m extremely happy for him as a teammate, as a friend. And I love watching him grow.\u201d Growing into moments like the one the Lakers experienced Sunday night is why Davis forced his way out of New Orleans and into the partnership with LeBron. All of the scrutiny and pressure that comes with it, the opportunity to face a moment with a conference final game on the one and the ball in his hands, he wanted that, too. \u201cWhen I left, I just wanted to be able to compete for a championship, and I know that moments like this comes with it,\u201d Davis said. \u201cEspecially being in L.A., the biggest market in basketball. I know the quote, unquote, pressure is going to be on us, going to be on me, especially the first year with everything that happened last year, and then also playing alongside \u2018Bron. I know he gets criticized more than any basketball player ever. \u201cSo just being able to play alongside him, and he kind of helped me with all this quote, unquote, pressure, going out and playing. You guys saw that in Game 5 of the Rockets [series] where he comes to me at the scorer\u2019s table and talks to me when I was struggling. Just going out there and just playing basketball. He makes it a lot easier for me. Just being able to want this type of pressure, this type of spotlight, and go out and play in big games and make big-time plays and big-time shots for my team, it was definitely what I wanted.\u201d James knows the feeling. That same yearning for the big moments has led him on a journey from Cleveland to Miami, back to Cleveland and, ultimately, to these Lakers. He knows what it feels like to take the type of shots Davis nailed Sunday. He knows what it\u2019s like to miss them. He knows that only certain players can deal with that sort of pressure, that sort of responsibility. \u201cAD, he knows how special he is and when he doesn\u2019t, I\u2019ll be the first one to tell him how special he is,\u201d James said. \u201cHe wanted to be here. I\u2019m happy he wanted to be here, because if he didn\u2019t, we wouldn\u2019t have a moment like tonight. That\u2019s what it\u2019s all about. You put that pressure on yourself when you don\u2019t really care what other people think, because what other people think doesn\u2019t really matter because they don\u2019t understand. Anybody can talk from outside, but if they got into the ring or they got into the arena, probably 10 times out of 10, they [expletive] their pants.\u201d Not Davis. Not in that jersey, in that moment he\u2019s been craving for so long, and not with everything riding on the outcome of those final two seconds. Watch the replay again and again and you\u2019ll see the look of certainty on Davis\u2019 face as the ball left his hands and he watches it in flight. \u201cIt was a big shot,\u201d Davis said. \u201cLike I said, we\u2019ll celebrate it for a couple hours. But they could have easily won this game and we have to be ready for Game 3 \u2026the job is definitely not over until we\u2019re able to win the ring. I mean, that\u2019s when it\u2019s over and that\u2019s when the test is completed. * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

So with all due respect to Jokic, who was merely being kind to the guilty party Sunday \u2014 teammates must always be supportive of each other \u2014 the mistake by Mason Plumlee was actually massive. And now, in due time, the extent of the damage will determine how much longer the Nuggets remain in the Western Conference finals. Because right now, no thanks to a poor decision by Plumlee in Game 2\u2019s moment of truth, they\u2019re down 2-0 to the Lakers . That\u2019s pushing the envelope, even in terms of their much-applauded comeback-ability. Plumlee is the raw and limited backup center who normally wouldn\u2019t even be on the floor for Denver in the final seconds of a tight game. Yet the Lakers bring size, and so Plumlee was inserted for the final possession: Nuggets up a point, Lakers with the ball, 2.1 seconds on the clock. By now, hours after the fact, you either screamed this at your TV or the replay or both: \u201cWhat is Plumlee doing?\u201d And you wouldn\u2019t be alone. Anybody who ever played the game, and those who haven\u2019t, know you do not, under any circumstances, allow yourself to be stopped by a phantom screen. It\u2019s rather surprising, because Plumlee is a veteran player and \u2026 he went to Duke. But Anthony Davis was free to catch the inbounds pass from Rajon Rondo, square up and release the game-winning 3-pointer. It swished at the buzzer, because Plumlee gave up the chase. Before the inbounds pass, Plumlee was assigned to Davis. He and Jerami Grant, who was guarding LeBron, had a brief conversation about switching if LeBron picked Plumlee. LeBron never moved. There was no screen. And when Davis sprinted away from Plumlee, the trailing Nuggets\u2019 center pursued him for about a step, then stopped and pointed at Davis, as though Grant should suddenly leave LeBron. Remember, there\u2019s only two seconds left. Grant was locked on LeBron, and he\u2019d have to go around LeBron to pickup Davis. So Grant correctly stayed with his man, who would\u2019ve had a clear path for a dunk had Grant switched off. Meanwhile, Plumlee released a guy who was the Lakers\u2019 leading scorer in the second half and finished with 31 points, and two days earlier dropped 37 on Denver. Just a reminder: Plumlee wasn\u2019t even screened. He just \u2026 surrendered and pointed. You can watch and re-watch this play a million times and still come away with the same head-scratching reaction. (Also curious: After Davis\u2019 shot swished, Rondo merely walked toward the ensuing chaos like nothing happened). Making matters more depressing for Denver, it was the lone second-half lapse by a Nuggets\u2019 team that was far better prepared defensively than in the previous six quarters (including the four in Game 1). Denver gave up just 22 points in the third and 23 in the fourth and that allowed the Nuggets to rally hard and assume the lead on a tip-in followed by a 3-pointer from Jokic (he and Davis combined to score the last 22 points in the game). They had unsolved the Lakers\u2019 riddle. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to figure them out,\u201d Jokic said. \u201cWe can just make them uncomfortable. They\u2019re really talented, they\u2019re going to find solutions. They have two really good, really good, really good players. We just need to stay on top and just make it uncomfortable.\u201d Nuggets coach Michael Malone also reached deep down his bench and inserted PJ Dozier, a second-year sub who hadn\u2019t played many meaningful minutes in the playoffs, for the second half. Dozier did miss four free throws in the fourth quarter Sunday, but he had energy and wasn\u2019t afraid of the moment, to the point where he became a problem for L.A. As a vote of confidence from the coach, Dozier was on the floor instead of Michael Porter Jr. for the final play, and slammed the ball in frustration after Davis\u2019 shot fell through. The inspiring lift from Dozier, the late take-charge by Jokic, the comeback \u2014 once again \u2014 by the Nuggets in these playoffs, all of that for naught because of how they finished up Game 2. \u201cWe had it and kind of lost it in the end,\u201d Jokic said. \u201cWe put effort in it, put fight in it. We played well most of the game. We\u2019re going to keep our heads up and on to the next one.\u201d That remains to be seen. For sure, the Nuggets are not your head-hanging team. They refused to give up against Utah or the Clippers \u2014 maybe you heard? They were flicked aside rather easily by the Lakers in this series opener and now they must elevate themselves out of another hole. They will hear how you cannot keep falling behind and fighting back. They\u2019ll also learn that LeBron is 22-0 lifetime whenever his team has a 2-0 lead in a best-of-seven series. They\u2019ll keep chanting the encouraging words of Malone, who stayed with the glass-half-full approach and said: \u201cWe were in the game and they had to rely on a great play by a great player to beat us.\u201d Well, sure, that is correct. But that great player was able to catch a pass, aim and shoot because Mason Plumlee suffered from brain lock. Maybe Anthony Davis makes that shot anyway. But in a best-case scenario for Denver, he doesn\u2019t, and this series is tied. \u201cIt happened, you know,\u201d said Jokic. \u201cIt happened.\u201d * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

And the first since Metta World Peace during the 2010 Western Conference finals vs. Phoenix. DIFFICULTY: Not much time to work with, and everyone admitted the play was intended for LeBron. At the inbounds whistle, Davis broke from the right elbow on a curve toward the left wing. Rondo, with LeBron doubled, bounced a pass to meet Davis at the spot.

The last two came on a bullyball hook with 20.8 seconds left, as Jokic just backed Davis all the way to the cup before putting the Nuggets ahead, 103-102. Alex Caruso missed a clean 3-pointer with 6.9 seconds left, but Danny Green grabbed the rebound, only for Jamal Murray to swat his shot attempt out of bounds. That set up the decisive inbounds. CELEBRATION: The bench started flying upcourt, and Davis met them near the halfcourt sideline in a flying shoulder bump. Talen Horton-Tucker was unfortunately on the receiving end, and wiped out completely as everyone else celebrated. Fun times. GRADE: Denver led for precious little of the second half. Completing the comeback would have driven Denver\u2019s confidence in this series through the roof.

This is his role right now for the Heat. His only role. Leonard is in a tough spot these days; a full-time starter during the regular season, he is now out of the rotation as the Heat have made their run to the Eastern Conference finals . It is a bitter pill for him to swallow \u2014 yet to his credit, he hasn\u2019t acted the least bit bitter about his current reality. > Game 4: Wednesday, 8:30 p.m. ET on ESPN \u201cMy team knows this, and our coaching staff knows this,\u201d Leonard told The Associated Press . \u201cI would do anything to be out there. And I\u2019d be lying if I said that I\u2019m not competitive as hell. I wish I was impacting the game on the floor. I\u2019m not, but as a person and as a player, I want what\u2019s best for everybody.\u201d So for now, the 7-foot, 260-pound, chiseled center is the tallest, strongest and best-paid assistant coach in these playoffs. He calls out what he\u2019s seeing on every possession, pulls aside teammates for quick one-on-one chats when necessary, and on off days he\u2019s getting his on-court work in just in case he\u2019s needed to play. Leonard has started 49 of his 51 appearances with the Heat this season, more starts than he made in his seven seasons with Portland combined. But in the playoffs, he\u2019s logged a total of nine minutes, all in one appearance. \u201cMeyers is one of the most special people I\u2019ve ever had the opportunity to coach and to be around,\u201d Spoelstra said. \u201cHe is just an incredible human being and teammate. He has all our hearts. We will do anything for him because he is so pure.\u201d Leonard, more than anything else, got unlucky at the worst possible time. He badly sprained his left ankle in early February and wasn\u2019t anywhere near being ready to return to the lineup when the NBA season was suspended March 11 because of the coronavirus pandemic. And then when team facilities shut down as a precaution, Leonard\u2019s rehab process had to be amended as well.  That was the first issue. The second was Miami became a different team a few days after he got hurt, pulling off a trade to bring Andre Iguodala, Jae Crowder and Solomon Hill to the Heat. Crowder has become a starter, and Spoelstra told Leonard before Miami resumed play in the NBA\u2019s restart bubble that he was taking the rotation in a different direction. It was tough on Leonard mentally. He was struggling when he got to the bubble because of his ankle, then spent days wrestling about whether he should stand for the national anthem or kneel with his teammates, and on top of all that he essentially lost his job as well. \u201cThere\u2019s just two things that I won\u2019t ever let be questioned and that\u2019s character and work ethic,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cEvery day when I walk through the door, I\u2019m going to be a great guy, a great teammate. It\u2019s not fake. So I\u2019m trying to make my impact now from the sideline.\u201d There are a few starters who aren\u2019t in the same roles that they were for the four teams remaining in this NBA season. Avery Bradley opted out of joining the Los Angeles Lakers in the bubble. Will Barton \u2014 who led Denver in minutes per game this season \u2014 has a knee injury and has missed the Nuggets\u2019 entire postseason run. Gordon Hayward has missed much of Boston\u2019s playoff stint while recovering from a sprained ankle. Heat rookie Kendrick Nunn, a starter all season, is in Miami\u2019s second unit now. Leonard saw the Heat change, and his role change with it. He didn\u2019t sulk, lash out or complain. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy, being in this kind of situation, going through the injury he went through and having the hiatus where he didn\u2019t get the full opportunity to rehab it,\u201d Spoelstra said. \u201cBut he\u2019s making the most of it, and if he gets his opportunity, he will be ready.\u201d Leonard also sees the reason why he should be helping the Heat however he can right now. He\u2019s never been this close to an NBA championship; the Heat lead the Celtics 2-1 in the East finals, with Game 4 on Wednesday night. He\u2019ll be ready to scream some more then, too. \u201cI am, in the best way possible, the most jealous of watching our team\u2019s success,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cI literally said this to my wife the other night. I said, \u2018Elle, we are six wins away from a ring.\u2019 That is so damn special.\u201d"},{"id":25623,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/film-study-celtics-heat-game-3-rim-protection","date":"2020-09-20","title":"Film Study: How Celtics attacked the rim in Game 3 vs. Heat","content":" Three games into the Eastern Conference finals , the most memorable play of the series (no matter how you rank it historically) remains Bam Adebayo\u2019s incredible block on Jayson Tatum\u2019s drive in overtime of Game 1. That play is why this series is 2-1 in favor of the Miami Heat instead of the Boston Celtics after Boston\u2019s 117-106 victory on Saturday. The difference in Game 3, the reason why the Celtics aren\u2019t down 3-0, was their 60-36 advantage in points in the paint. The league is shooting more 3-pointers every season (and more in these playoffs than it did in the regular season), but shots in the restricted area remain the most valuable on the floor. And the Celtics got there early and often to make this series interesting. The Celtics 60 points in the paint were 10 more than they\u2019d scored in any of their previous 13 playoff games and tied for the second most the Heat have allowed in regulation all season. Critical in that attack, especially with that Game 1 block in mind, is that Adebayo was nowhere near the rim for the vast majority of the Celtics\u2019 21 baskets in the restricted area ( video ). That block in Game 1 was spectacular, but Adebayo didn\u2019t grade as an elite a rim protector in the regular season. Opponents shot 58.9% at the rim when he was there to protect it, a mark that ranked 27th among 79 players who defended at least 4.5 attempts at the rim per game. That 58.9% was the best mark on the Heat , but for a starting big man, Adebayo didn\u2019t protect the rim all that often. The 5.0 shots that he defended at the rim per 36 minutes on the floor ranked 62nd among 246 players who played at least 1,000 minutes this season. (For context, Celtics center Daniel Theis ranked ninth, defending 8.7 shots at the rim per 36.) The low number is partly about the Heat preventing those shots in general. They ranked fourth in the (lowest) percentage of their opponents\u2019 shots that came in the restricted area (29.6%). It\u2019s partly because Adebayo played more than half (56%) of his minutes alongside another big (Meyers Leonard or Kelly Olynyk). And it\u2019s partly because Adebayo switched a lot of screens so that he could shut down opposing guards. The switching has had its benefits. According to Synergy play-type tracking, the Heat ranked third in points allowed per possession on isolations (0.82) in the regular season, with Adebayo defending the fifth most isolation possessions in the league (108). In the playoffs, opponents have scored just 0.64 points per possession on 33 isolations against the Heat\u2019s center. In Game 1, the Celtics isolated against Adebayo *seven times, and the results were not good. They scored just three points on those seven isolations in an otherwise efficient offensive game. In Game 2, they scored five points on *four isolations against him. * These are different counts than those from Synergy above. They include isos that don\u2019t end a possession. On Saturday, the Celtics only tried playing one-on-one against Adebayo twice. Tatum drew a non-shooting foul on Adebayo early in the third quarter and then committed an offensive foul early in the fourth. So it seems that, since Game 1, the Celtics have learned not to attack one particular defender. But they spent most of Game 3 attacking others, and Adebayo generally wasn\u2019t in position to help. Duncan Robinson hurt the Celtics in Game 2, shooting 6-for-12 from 3-point range in Miami\u2019s five-point win. He was 4-for-8 from beyond the arc in Game 3, but the Celtics got a lot of those points back by targeting Robinson on the other end of the floor. Here are some examples of them scoring against Robinson both off the dribble and in the post: Play 1: On the Celtics\u2019 third possession of the game, Tatum gets a screen from Daniel Theis and Adebayo stops his drive. He kicks the ball out to Jaylen Brown, who attacks Robinson off the dribble. Adebayo is in position to help, but just swipes at the ball and retreats to Tatum in the strong-side corner. Play 2: Marcus Smart takes a hand-off from Tatum and gets a screen from Theis that Adebayo switches. Smart gets the ball back to Tatum on the left wing and he drives baseline. Because of the switch, it\u2019s Jimmy Butler and not Adebayo protecting the rim. Play 3: Brown contests a Robinson 3-pointer, leaks out, and establishes early position on Robinson under the basket. Tatum gets him the ball and he converts an and-one before Adebayo can get there. Play 4: Adebayo switches another Smart-Theis screen and Tatum again attacks Robinson along the left baseline. Robinson cuts off the drive, but Tatum turns it into a post-up and draws a foul on a drop step with Adebayo remaining on the perimeter. Play 5: With Adebayo off the floor, the Celtics run their double-drag screen for Kemba Walker and the Heat switch both screens, putting Robinson on Smart. He takes Robinson into the post and gets another and-one on a turn into the lane. Play 6: With Adebayo still off the floor, Robinson switches a hand-off from Smart to Walker, who initially gives up the ball. But Tatum gets it right back to him and Walker easily beats Robinson off the dribble. Robinson didn\u2019t get burned every time the Heat went after him \u2013 he actually blocked Tatum on the first possession of the third quarter \u2013 but the Celtics will continue to challenge him defensively. In addition to getting layups, they\u2019re getting fouls ( he has 10 in 77 minutes ), which can take away one of Miami\u2019s weapons on the other end of the floor. Four of the Celtics\u2019 21 restricted area buckets (including the last two above) came with Adebayo off the floor , and another five came on fast breaks. But the other 12, including each of the Celtics eight restricted-area buckets in the first quarter, came in the half-court with Adebayo on the floor. And on only two of those 12 \u2013 a Brown cut against the Heat\u2019s 2-3 zone where Jae Crowder wasn\u2019t guarding anybody and a Smart drive that he didn\u2019t contest \u2013 was Adebayo in position to protect the rim. Here are some more Boston layups that Adebayo couldn\u2019t get to: Play 1: The Celtics ran the same play \u2013 Smart taking a hand-off from Walker and using a screen from Brown \u2013 on their first two possessions of the game. Both times, Adebayo was guarding Theis, who was stationed in the right corner. On the first possession, Smart beat Crowder off the dribble for an and-one . Here, he hits Brown rolling to the rim, with Goran Dragic helping off of Walker instead of Adebayo helping off Theis. Play 2: Walker brings the ball up the left side of the floor in transition. Adebayo is around, but doesn\u2019t get all the way back to wall off the paint and just swipes at the ball when Walker beats Crowder off the dribble. Play 3: Robinson and Dragic don\u2019t switch an exchange between the Celtics\u2019 two guards, but Adebayo switches Theis\u2019 screen for Walker. Crowder alertly switches onto Theis when he dives into the paint and Butler stops Brown\u2019s first drive. But when Brown spins away from a Robinson switch and drives again, Crowder steps up and, with Adebayo still outside the paint, Theis is able to tip-in the miss. Play 4: Adebayo again switches a Walker-Theis screen, Walker again quickly gets rid of the ball, and Crowder again leaves his man to get Dragic off of Theis. Robinson forces a tough shot from Smart, but Theis again gets position for a put-back. Play 5: With Olynyk on the floor and guarding Theis, Adebayo has Brown in the right corner. Walker gets Brown the ball, but he knows there\u2019s a better matchup elsewhere. Tatum backs down Tyler Herro and gets an easy layup with Adebayo watching from a few feet away. Some of this stuff can be cleaned up with better effort from the Heat defense, which will have three days to soak this one up and build up the requisite energy and focus needed for Game 4 on Wednesday ( 8:30 p.m. ET, ESPN ). \u201cLacking communication,\u201d Adebayo said of his team\u2019s performance in Game 3. \u201cThis is a series where you have to guard your yard. Sixty points in the paint is not guarding our yard.\u201d But the Heat might also be better off if Adebayo didn\u2019t switch so often. It\u2019s great that he can guard \u201cone through five\u201d and a lot of perimeter players in this league have learned the hard way that he can shut anybody down in isolation. But his ability (and eagerness) to switch onto guards can put the Heat in bad situations elsewhere on the floor, and it seems that the Celtics have figured that out. If Adebayo is on the perimeter, they can attack the Heat\u2019s weaker defenders, and he won\u2019t be at the rim to protect it. \u201cWe just got to stay in front of our man,\u201d Butler said about the Celtics\u2019 60 points in the paint on Saturday. \u201cSimple as that. I think we put too much on Bam to always be there, and he can\u2019t save us every single time. He\u2019s great at help defense and he\u2019s great on the ball but he already does enough for us. You can\u2019t just get beat and expect for Bam to come and save you every time.\u201d Theis is 4-for-24 from 3-point range in the playoffs. If he\u2019s stationed on the perimeter, Adebayo (if he\u2019s actually guarding Theis) can sag off and be in better position to protect the rim. If Theis is stationed inside, the paint will be crowded and it will be more difficult for the Celtics\u2019 perimeter players to drive. Choosing not to switch means choosing between a softer (drop) coverage or an aggressive (blitz) one on pick-and-rolls. Dropping back means allowing the league\u2019s best pull-up jump shooting team to shoot pull-up jumpers. Blitzing means leaving yourself open to 4-on-3 situations behind the pick-and-roll. The Heat generally blitz when Olynyk is playing center and Walker has handled double-teams well, but Adebayo would be quicker to recover back to his man than Olynyk is. Playing zone is the easiest way to keep Adebayo closer to the basket. But the two zone scores noted above were part of a third quarter where Boston scored 13 points on seven zone possessions, easily their best stretch against it in the series. Through three games, the Celtics have still been less efficient against the zone (1.05 points per possession) than they\u2019ve been otherwise (1.15). It will return, but maybe not for as much as we saw in Game 2 (27 second-half possessions). No matter what defense they\u2019re playing against, the Celtics saw the benefits of being aggressive in Game 3. \u201cI think we should play like that all the time,\u201d Tatum said, \u201clike we\u2019re fighting for our lives. And we realize that.\u201d They\u2019re going to keep attacking the rim. The question is whether Bam Adebayo will be there to protect it. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

But the real winners were the NBA and most of its fans, when you stop to consider the alternative. Imagine this series being 3-0 in favor of Miami, with everyone waiting through the first scheduled extended break of this postseason. The games have been coming fast compared to a normal, non-bubble year, every other day. But with the Eastern Conference finals a couple games out in front of the West edition, the NBA opted to push Game 4 of this series out to Wednesday. Down 3-0 \u2014 from which no NBA team in playoff history has survived \u2014 the Celtics would have been waiting in vain for a reprieve from the governor. So would the rest of us. Now we\u2019ve got a series again. Better still, the Celtics have themselves a series again. Boston seemed on the verge of a death spiral after Game 2, adding acrimony in their locker room to their struggles on the court. The audible squabbling after that loss from Marcus Smart and mates, leading to the hastily called meeting by coach Brad Stevens with the team\u2019s key players put Boston, already in a must-win predicament, in a must-buck up situation as well. \u201cI told the team this yesterday \u2026 like, this result didn\u2019t really matter to me,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cIt was more about: What are we going to show ourselves to be?  And I thought that we are a really special group.\u201d Said Jaylen Brown, who scored a team-high 26 points: \u201cTo be honest, I didn\u2019t get much sleep the last 48 hours. I was so antsy to get back and play basketball. I don\u2019t think the last two games exemplify what this team is about. So, I couldn\u2019t wait to come out and be the best version of myself and try to add to a win.\u201d The Celtics, rather than coughing up leads as they had in the first two games, never let the Heat catch or pass them this time. That Miami zone that so stymied them in the second half of Game 2? Boston attacked it this time, not only putting to use Gordon Hayward in his return from a sprained ankle, but also focusing more aggressively on the paint (60-36 scoring edge from there). The Celtics also had the rebounding advantage and held Miami below 40% shooting. \u201cJust about honing in, focusing,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThere\u2019s some great guys in that locker room. A lot of emotion, a lot of passion. But we\u2019re a family. We are here for each other at the end of the day. So we exemplified that when we came out together. We stayed together during some tough moments.\u201d Miami coach Erik Spoelstra had as many things to be displeased about as the Celtics had to be pleased. With three extra days to ponder that. \u201cI want our guys thinking about this,\u201d Spoelstra said. Here are a couple of things: The Heat can head into Game 4 remembering that a team (Milwaukee) that started 10-1 in the playoffs last season, like them, still found itself sitting at home by the 2019 Finals. The Celtics can recall that a team (Toronto) that started 0-2 in the 2019 East finals still found a way to roar back and sweep the next four games. The stats weren\u2019t much: six points on 2-for-7 shooting, with five rebounds, four assists, three steals and a plus-1 rating in nearly 31 minutes off the bench. But Gordon Hayward was back from his sprained right ankle, the Celtics were delighted to have him and his impact was felt all night. \u201cHe is a stabilizing force for our team,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cHe just can make the right play and make a play for somebody else at the right time. And he hit the big 3 as they were making a run, so I think he makes us better, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d Boston wasn\u2019t just better Saturday, it was playoffs-throwback better. Brown, Jayson Tatum, Kemba Walker and Smart each scored 20 or more points \u2013 the first time four Celtics did that in a game since May 15, 1986. That night, five Celtics (Larry Bird, Kevin McHale, Robert Parish, Dennis Johnson, Danny Ainge) got 20 or more in a victory over Milwaukee. What did Hayward have to do with this breakout? Tatum counted the ways: \u201cJust his decision-making, his ability to make plays for others and for himself,\u201d the young Celtics forward said. \u201cIt just opens up the floor so much more. They\u2019ve got to respect him. So, it\u2019s just having a bunch of guys out there you really can\u2019t hop off of, because everybody can shoot, knock down shots and make plays.\u201d Stevens admitted there were moments when Hayward was gassed, but he kept him on the court anyway, to fast-track the return of his stamina. The versatile wing had not played in a month since his injury in Boston\u2019s playoff opener against Philadelphia. But now he has three full days to rest and get a little practice time to aid his rhythm. The Heat has fallen into a bad habit of spotting the Celtics leads in each game of the series. Not just a point or two in the early going but substantial holes, dug quickly and deeply, demanding no small effort when the Miami players and coaches get around to digging out. Or in Saturday\u2019s case, not. \u2014 In Game 1, Miami trailed by nine after just five minutes and by 13 with 4:18 left in the first quarter. They were down 14 early in the fourth, before clawing back to force the overtime they needed to win. \u2014 In Game 2, the Heat fell behind by 17 points in the second quarter. It was elevator-shaft stuff, plummeting from a two-point deficit to 58-41 in a span of barely seven minutes. From there, Jimmy Butler, Bam Adebayo and the rest hitched up their shorts, outworking and outscoring Boston 65-43. It wasn\u2019t easy. \u2014 And in Game 3 Saturday, Miami found itself down by seven points in the first 4:01. This time, there was no coming back. This was a wire-to-wire loss, down early, down by as much as 20, down at the end. The Heat\u2019s 21-7 run deep into the final quarter would have been more exciting if they hadn\u2019t begun that stretch in a 19-point hole. So 109-104 was as close as they got. \u201cIt gets old, playing from behind, consistently,\u201d Butler said afterward. \u201cWe should stop put ourselves in that position.\u201d Should? More like must. \u201cWe got to start the game how we start the fourth,\u201d Adebayo said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re not the type of team where we can go through the motions and try and figure out everything in the first half, and then in the third or fourth, we just try to turn it on. \u201cI guess they got tired of us being down 13 and coming back and winning.\u201d Resiliency is a great thing, in games as much as in series. But you\u2019d rather not put yourself in the position to test it. Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

So, in familiar territory once again down 1-0 to the Los Angeles Lakers, Denver Nuggets coach Michael Malone quickly identified what hurt his squad most Friday in a 126-114 Game 1 loss . It was even a primary concern going into the series. >> Game 2: Sunday, 7:30 ET (TNT) \u201cI think it\u2019s obvious for anybody that watched the game is just getting back [in transition],\u201d Malone said. \u201cThey had 35 transition points. As I told our players this morning when we watched the film, \u2018I told you about this. We talked about them being the No. 1 running team in the league. We talked about the pace at which they played with and that is off makes, that\u2019s off misses, that\u2019s off turnovers. That\u2019s off free throws.\u2019 We did a poor job of that. We could\u2019ve taken away so many easy baskets. Give them credit. They get the ball up the floor in a hurry, and they attack.\u201d LeBron James discussed after losing Game 1 of the Western Conference semifinals against Houston how the Lakers needed to actually experience the small-ball Rockets\u2019 overall team speed in a game setting to catch a firm grasp for how to combat it. For Denver, the same applies regarding the Lakers in transition. The Nuggets learned that lesson the hard way after closing the opening quarter Friday on a 16-8 run to take a 2-point lead (38-36) going into the second quarter. Los Angeles quickly reeled off a 17-1 run to start the second quarter, and in just the first 5:35 of that frame, the Lakers outscored Denver 20-3 on 7-for-8 shooting from the field and 2-for-2 from deep, while churning out seven points on seven Nuggets turnovers. Up 11 to start the third quarter, Los Angeles eventually pumped up the lead to 24 going into the final frame. Denver owns a record of 1-6 this postseason when it surrenders 110-plus points. \u201cTheir ability to convert from defense to offense is remarkable,\u201d Malone said. \u201cA lot of teams say they want to run, but they\u2019re not in shape to do so for 48 minutes. I think the second thing about it is they have a player in LeBron James who could very well be the best passing forward ever to play the game. He\u2019s always looking up the floor. They have bigs that are athletic, [and] put pressure on the rim. They have wings that are disciplined and dedicated to getting out on the break. And the ball is thrown up the floor. They\u2019re used to the advance pass, as opposed to always using the dribble. A lot of people talk about it. They do it. \u201cIt definitely was a concern coming into the series. You can talk about it. You can try to prepare people for it, but once you\u2019re up against it and you really feel it, I think that\u2019s when it takes hold. Hopefully, going into Game 2 our guys understand that and we can be a lot more disciplined, because there were times even when we were back we just didn\u2019t point and talk. And communication would clear up a lot of confusion and take away some of the easy 3s we allowed them to walk into. For us to try to even the series up, it\u2019ll have to start and end with that transition.\u201d Nuggets forward Michael Porter Jr. concurred. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly just an awareness we\u2019ve got to have, especially for us guys that crash the offensive glass,\u201d Porter said. \u201cBe selective with that, and just make sure we\u2019re getting back because they\u2019re a great transition team. They hurt us last game with that.\u201d Los Angeles coach Frank Vogel anticipates Denver working to make the necessary adjustments to handle his team\u2019s transition game, and the Lakers are already devising potential counters. \u201cAfter each game, we watch the tape and we come in as we\u2019re watching tape saying, \u2018Hey, Game 2, this is probably what Denver\u2019s gonna do,\u2019\u201d Vogel said. \u201cWe go through that list so our guys have thought about it, prepared. It\u2019s conversational. It\u2019s something we do talk about in between every playoff game.\u201d Besides that, the Lakers \u2014 winners of five straight playoff games for the first time since 2010, when they captured eight straight \u2014 understand the resilience Denver displayed in getting here. \u201cAfter watching them beat two great teams back-to-back after being down 3-1, they\u2019re the comeback kids. That\u2019s what we\u2019re gonna keep going by,\u201d Lakers forward Markieff Morris said. \u201cThey like to come back. So, we know we ain\u2019t had their best shot yet.

(AP) \u2014 Gordon Hayward has been part of Boston teams that have made the Eastern Conference finals twice in the past three seasons. He finally got to play in that playoff round. Hayward returned to the Celtics\u2019 rotation in Game 3 of their East title series against the Miami Heat on Saturday night, after missing a month while recovering from a right ankle sprain. It was his first time in an East finals game; he was inactive for all seven Boston games in the 2018 series and the first two this year, both times because of injuries. Hayward had six points, five rebounds, four assists and three steals in 31 minutes, and Boston won 117-106 . \u201cI think it was really fun to be back out there with the team, with the guys,\u201d Hayward said. \u201cI just tried to impact our team in winning ways, whatever I could do.\u201d Hayward checked in with 5:06 left in the opening quarter and finished with finished with six points, five rebounds, four assists and three steals. \u201cHe can score the ball. He can switch all the different positions. He gives us a lot of defensive flexibility there. He just gives us a lot,\u201d Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. \u201cAnd I think that he\u2019s always been a guy that provides a great sense of stability.\u201d Hayward played 34 minutes in Game 1 of Boston\u2019s first-round series against Philadelphia when he hurt the right ankle. The Celtics said Hayward would be out at least four weeks with what they said was a Grade III sprain, the most severe level; his absence was about 4 1\/2 weeks, so he was right on the envisioned schedule. \u201cWe don\u2019t expect him to be a world-beater, but I think his presence helps us,\u201d Stevens said. Hayward had a strong season for the Celtics, averaging 17.5 points, 6.7 rebounds and 4.1 assists on exactly 50% shooting. Hayward was only the second Boston player to have those numbers, or better, over a full season; Larry Bird is the other, and he did it five times for the Celtics. The Celtics\u2019 win Saturday cut Miami\u2019s lead in the series to 2-1. Game 4 isn\u2019t until Wednesday, so Hayward gets plenty of recovery time. \u201cI\u2019m extremely tired right now,\u201d Hayward said postgame. \u201cMy ankle\u2019s pretty sore.\u201d Hayward was a top target of Miami in the free agency summer of 2017 before he chose the Celtics. Boston went to the East finals in his first season there, but he played only five minutes of the first regular-season game before his year ended with a terrible injury \u2014 a dislocated ankle and fractured tibia. The Celtics lost that East title series to Cleveland in seven games."},{"id":25627,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/lebron-james-upset-kia-mvp-finish","date":"2020-09-19","title":"LeBron 'pissed off' with another Kia MVP second-place finish","content":" ORLANDO, Fla. \u2014 LeBron James is fine. Just fine. His Los Angeles Lakers are up 1-0 on the Denver Nuggets in the Western Conference finals and he promised to sleep good in the NBA bubble. But that doesn\u2019t mean the Kia MVP voting, announced Friday, didn\u2019t rile him up. He agreed that back-to-back winner Giannis Antetokounmpo had a great year. It\u2019s the system and the voting breakdown \u2014 he received 16 of the 101 first-place votes \u2014 that caused a problem. For a four-time winner of the award in his 17th season who led the league in assists and guided the Lakers to the No 1 seed in the Western Conference playoff chase, and has his team three wins away from The Finals \u2026 that\u2019s math he can\u2019t comprehend. Finishing second for a fourth time, however, left him more angry than anything. \u201cPissed me off. That\u2019s my true answer,\u201d he said when asked for his thoughts on his place in the race. \u201cIt pissed me off because out of 101 votes, I got 16 first-place votes. That\u2019s what pissed me off more than anything. You know, not saying that the winner wasn\u2019t deserving of the MVP. But that pissed me off. And I finished second a lot in my career, either from a championship, and now four times as an MVP. \u201cI never came into this league to be MVP or to be a champion. I\u2019ve always just wanted to get better and better every single day, and those things will take care of itself. But some things is just out of my hand and some things you can\u2019t control. But it pissed me off.\u201d I get it. The MVP debate\/discussion stirs passion and emotion 24 hours a day, seven days a week and 365 days a year. I\u2019ve been responsible for NBA.com \u2018s Kia Race to the MVP Ladder long enough to know that my email inbox and social media feeds have the scars to prove how partisan the MVP discussion can get. LeBron\u2019s legion of supporters, my own father included, have no problem letting me know how wrong they think I was to be among the evil 85 that didn\u2019t have LeBron at the top of my ballot. And there\u2019s no doubt that LeBron presented a strong case for the top spot this season and basically every season since he entered the league. It pissed me off because out of 101 votes, I got 16 first-place votes. That\u2019s what pissed me off more than anything. LeBron James on Kia MVP voting I would point out that in this strangest of NBA seasons, with shutdown for the coronavirus pandemic and the restart here in the bubble and the fact that we\u2019re seeing the conference finals in September, the awards conversation is as strange as it\u2019s been in years. Is it any coincidence that in this strangest of NBA seasons it marks the first time since the 2006-07 campaign that none of the main award winners \u2014 MVP, Defensive Player of the Year, Most Improved Players, Rookie of the Year, Sixth Man Award and Coach of the Year \u2014 are in the conference finals? So maybe there\u2019s good reason for LeBron to be upset about the MVP race. After all, a slight, real or perceived, has always been a great motivator, even for the game\u2019s all-time greats (see Jordan, Michael and The Last Dance for a reminder). But it\u2019s clear he\u2019s been thinking about the voting process for season-ending awards for some time, the MVP criteria in particular. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not going to sit up here and talk about what the criteria should be or what it is,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s changed over the years since I\u2019ve gotten into the league, I know that. It\u2019s just changed. It\u2019s changed a lot. Sometimes it\u2019s the best player on the best team. Sometimes it\u2019s the guy with the best season statistically \u2026 Giannis had a hell of a season, I can definitely say that.\u201d While he doesn\u2019t need any extra motivation to add a fourth Larry O\u2019Brien Trophy to his wickedly long list of accomplishments, LeBron did rattle the saber when he offered his thoughts about those aforementioned fluid requirements for finishing first in any award category.  \u201cI mean, I\u2019m fine. Don\u2019t get it twisted. I\u2019m going back to my room. I\u2019m perfectly fine. We\u2019re 1-0 in the Western Conference finals. I\u2019m absolutely fine. I was pissed off at the reaction earlier when I saw it, (but) I\u2019m absolutely great now. I\u2019m going back to my room (to) drink some wine and sleep very well tonight. Let\u2019s not get it twisted. I\u2019m great.\u201d But \u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s just the voting scale is a little weird to me sometimes,\u201d he continued. \u201cI mean, if you take 2012. If you just stick with me \u2014 or 2012-13, I had a chance to be Defensive Player of the Year and also MVP in the same season. And that year [Marc] Gasol was [voted] Defensive Player of the Year, but he made Second Team All-Defense. So that doesn\u2019t make sense. It\u2019s like being MVP of the league, but you make Second Team All-NBA. That\u2019s when I really started to look at things differently. I was like, how does that even make any sense? It\u2019s like being Rookie of the Year but you make Second Team All-Rookie. \u201cAnd then I looked at the Most Improved this year, and rightfully so Brandon Ingram was amazing and I thought he should have won it. But did you see the vote that Devonte\u2019 Graham got? He averaged four points last year compared to 17 and a half (this year). If that\u2019s not improving, what is? \u2026 I don\u2019t know how much we are really watching the game of basketball or are we just in the narration mode, the narrative.\u201d Anthony Davis finished sixth in the MVP voting this season, his first playing alongside LeBron. There\u2019s no question who he would have voted for. \u201cHe deserves it. What he\u2019s been able to do for our team, the things he\u2019s been doing individually, on a consistent basis, night-in, night-out. It\u2019s not even a question who deserves it,\u201d Davis said. \u201cYear 17, doing what he\u2019s doing. I\u2019m pretty sure he said everything that I was going to say \u2026 They kind of choose the MVP before the season even starts. If the Lakers needed a rallying cry for this postseason run beyond the career-making accomplishment of winning a title or restoring the glory to a proud franchise that hasn\u2019t been in this space since 2010, they surely have it now. * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

Well, if the Western Conference finals remains on course after a dominant opener Friday night by the Los Angeles Lakers, then LeBron James and Anthony Davis (and Dwight Howard?) will flex their way to the NBA Finals. The Lakers used size to overpower the Nuggets, rolling up 32 free throw attempts in the first half of the 126-114 victory . They also got Nikola Jokic into early constant foul trouble, which is why all suspense turned to vapor by midway through the third quarter. \u201cWe want to be the most physical team on the floor every time we take the floor no matter what team we\u2019re playing,\u201d said Lakers coach Frank Vogel. \u201cI was happy where that was at tonight. We built a plan to give us the flexibility to play against small teams with Anthony at the five or going big with our two centers.\u201d Forced to deal with Howard and Davis, Jokic was simply outnumbered and couldn\u2019t elevate his team as LeBron did his. But that was the Lakers\u2019 plan, not only from the start of this series, but last summer when they added Howard to compliment the LeBron-AD nucleus. Loading up on height was done with an eye toward the postseason, just in case the Lakers saw Jokic along the way. They just didn\u2019t anticipate seeing him here in the West finals \u2014 but no need to pile on the Clippers any further. Howard was a wandering and unwanted soul for much of last summer when he was unceremoniously cut loose by the Wizards, his fourth team in four years. His career, while headed toward Springfield and the Hall of Fame someday, had taken a wicked detour, caused by a back injury \u2014 he would require surgery for it \u2014 and a poor locker room image. The Lakers signed him on the cheap, on a non-guaranteed deal at that. It was a harsh reflection of where Howard stood around the league, an embarrassing plight for an eight-time All-Star and former three-time Defensive Player of the Year. A year later, the Lakers and Howard are looking wiser right now for choosing each other. He was clearly the X-factor for Los Angeles in Game 1 against Denver after playing sparingly in the previous series against the small-ball Houston Rockets. He targeted Jokic almost immediately after checking into the game, baiting the Nuggets star into costly fouls that sent Denver\u2019s All-Star to the bench for much of the second quarter. Meanwhile, Howard also made himself a presence offensively by catching lob passes from LeBron and Rajon Rondo for easy buckets. As a reward, Howard started the second half over JaVale McGee, and within minutes, the game was essentially over. Howard finished with 13 points in 16 minutes. You could argue that, at one stretch, Howard was the second-best big man on the floor after Davis and ahead of Jokic. The Lakers can\u2019t lose in that situation. \u201cI liked his energy,\u201d Vogel said. \u201cDwight has a physical presence and this is going to be a physical series.\u201d As for Davis, he punished the Nuggets repeatedly and especially thrived with Jokic sitting with foul trouble. Because Davis is such a tough assignment given his shooting range and ability to score around the rim, Jokic is more vulnerable to fouls against the Lakers than in the previous two rounds when he faced Rudy Gobert and Ivica Zubac, a pair of centers who aren\u2019t primary scoring options. Basically, Jokic must expend energy at both ends of the floor because of Davis. \u201cWe have to do something different with him,\u201d Nuggets coach Mike Malone said of Davis. \u201cIt was too easy. He did not feel us.\u201d Davis finished with 37 points and 10 rebounds, while LeBron added 15 mainly because he wasn\u2019t needed; he also added 12 assists. \u201cWe followed the game plan, try not to foul, trust our game plan and what we\u2019ve been doing throughout this whole year,\u201d said LeBron. \u201cWe got a lot of length out there. Having that type of size and athleticism gives us an advantage.\u201d The Nuggets are perplexed, not only over the Lakers\u2019 size, but their own penchant for collecting fouls. The Lakers shot 24 free throws in the second quarter alone, and Malone was anxious to see the video replay of a majority of those foul calls. Regardless, he added: \u201cWe have to be a little bit smarter. We didn\u2019t guard anybody. We\u2019re not going to beat that team by putting them on the foul line 37 times. It was an extreme advantage for the Lakers in that first half. We can learn from our losses and see what we can do better to give ourselves a chance to win.\u201d The Lakers were taking no special satisfaction in capturing an opening victory against a Denver team that rallied from a pair of 3-1 deficits to reach this point. If anything, most of the postgame emotion was generated by LeBron over getting what he thought was a lack of respect in the MVP voting ; he finished second to Giannis Antetokounmpo. If that becomes a battle cry for LeBron for the rest of this series, then it\u2019s one more worry for the Nuggets. \u201cThis is a historic type of resilient team,\u201d Vogel said. \u201cWe got to make sure we put our foot on the gas.\u201d * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

It would be a win-win, right? Horry, one of the league\u2019s most decorated role players ever, could show off on his mantle the Maurice Podoloff Trophy, presented annually to the NBA\u2019s MVP. (An award for which Horry never got a single vote in his 16 seasons, by the way.) Meanwhile, Antetokounmpo could forever flash that most coveted piece of sports jewelry, a championship ring. He has yet to win one in seven seasons with the Milwaukee Bucks, and it remains a hole in his remarkable resume that still needs filling. Horry \u2013 or Satch Sanders (eight rings), Tom Heinsohn (eight) or Sam Jones (10) \u2013 might not even miss one, and be happy to trade for the ultimate individual honor he never won. It doesn\u2019t work that way, of course. Modestly talented players pick up championship rings every season, validating their careers in ways the hefty paychecks do not. What makes them so very valuable is that, no, you can\u2019t go out and buy one, not a legitimate one. Can\u2019t swap for one, either. Conversely, only one performer each year gets hailed as the NBA\u2019s most valuable player. A select group have been honored with that award more than once. And an even more elite subset managed to stack up their MVPs back-to-back, distinguishing themselves one year, then defending the status the next. That\u2019s how Antetokounmpo did it, putting up historic numbers and again leading the Bucks to the NBA\u2019s best record, claiming the same MVP hardware for 2019-20 that he earned in 2018-19. With that, however, the Milwaukee star joined an even smaller club, one that could meet in a closet and maybe opt to keep the door closed: Back-to-back MVP winners who did not win \u2013 or in Antetokounmpo\u2019s case, have not won \u2013 a ring. Total membership? Two. It\u2019s former Phoenix point guard Steve Nash, the MVP in 2005 and 2006, and Antetokounmpo. Ten other NBA legends have been named MVP in consecutive seasons, and all won at least one championship. Nine, in fact, won two or more titles: Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan, Tim Duncan, LeBron James and Steph Curry. (Moses Malone won once, in 1983 with Philadelphia.) In all, the league\u2019s 65 MVP trophies have been won by 34 players. That includes 20 one-and-done winners, six players who each won twice and eight who combined to claim the honor 33 times: Russell (five), Chamberlain (four), Abdul-Jabbar (six), Malone (three), Bird (three), Johnson (three), Jordan (five) and James (four). Those eight Hall of Famers earned, between them, 35 NBA championships, led by Russell with 11 and Abdul-Jabbar and Jordan with six apiece. Of the 34 MVP winners overall, 26 of them also won rings. And fairly or not, the eight who never won might come to mind more quickly than several of those who did. The ringless MVPs: Charles Barkley (1993), Karl Malone (1997, \u201999), Allen Iverson (2001), Nash (2005, \u201906), Derrick Rose (2011), Russell Westbrook (2017), James Harden (2018) and Antetokounmpo. That\u2019s the group from which Antetokounmpo wants to distance himself now, not simply standing out from the other 450 or so active players. He said as much when he repeated his thought from last year\u2019s trophy announcement, asking that he not be called an \u201cMVP\u201d until he leads the Bucks to a championship. This time, he upped that to not being called a two-time MVP until that team prize is in hand. The Greek Freak, who actually was in Athens when the award balloting was released Friday, put up historical individual stats in 2019-20, averaging 29.5 points, 13.6 rebounds and 5.6 assists while shooting 55.3 percent and averaging a modest 30.4 minutes. Milwaukee went 56-17, posting the league\u2019s best record for the second season in a row. But the Bucks lost their formula before or during the long virus shutdown, sputtered in the Orlando restart bubble and suffered a gentleman\u2019s sweep (4-1) by Miami one round earlier than their 2019 exit. \u201cI always look forward,\u201d Antetokounmpo said in a Zoom news conference. \u201cI always try to figure out, how can I get better? How can I do it again? How can I do it for multiple years to come? How can I be a champion? I\u2019m happy. I\u2019m grateful. But how can I do it again?\u201d It\u2019s not likely Antetokounmpo will win a third straight MVP. It only has been done three times, and all three \u2013 Russell, Chamberlain and Bird \u2013 had won a championship before snagging their third Podoloff. Past back-to-back winners have faced voter fatigue, a tendency for those with ballots to seek out someone new for change\u2019s sake. There might be some, rightly or wrongly, who won\u2019t back Antetokounmpo again for the regular season award until he at least gets himself and his team to an NBA Finals. In the years after Nash\u2019s back-to-back MVPs, the Hall of Fame playmaker finished second, ninth, eighth and ninth in the balloting, though he continued to play at an All-Star level. By the way, Nash was 32 when he earned his second MVP. Antetokounmpo still is 25. There have been MVPs who had lengthy gaps between their first MVP and their first ring. Washington\u2019s Wes Unseld was a rookie when he was named MVP in 1969, then had to wait nine seasons to nail down a championship. It took Chamberlain (1960 to 1967) and Bob McAdoo (1972 to 1982) roughly that long before they backed up their individual greatness with a ring. So Antetokounmpo has time. But even superstars who got from MVP to champion pretty quickly, like Jordan and James (three years each from MVP to champion), heard about the missing piece of their puzzles constantly. Until they finally found it. That\u2019s why Antetokounmpo, asked Friday to channel the skinny Greek kid who was a steal at No. 15 in the 2013 Draft in reacting to all he has achieved so far, knit together so well his past, present and future. \u201cMy younger self would probably say, \u2018I\u2019m extremely proud of what you have accomplished. But we\u2019re not done yet,\u2019\u201d Antetokounmpo said. \u201cThe goal is always to be the best. The goal is always to be the champion. The goal is always to make your team successful.\u201d The goal for Antetokounmpo officially can shift to the Bill Russell Finals MVP Award, which will scratch all sorts of individual and team itches. Can\u2019t swap for that one, either. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

This is the second straight Kia NBA Most Valuable Player Award for Antetokounmpo, who becomes the 12th player to earn the honor in consecutive seasons. A native of Greece, Antetokounmpo is the first player from Europe to be selected as the NBA MVP more than once. Antetokounmpo, 25, also joins Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and LeBron James as the only players to win multiple NBA MVP awards by the age of 25. Antetokounmpo was previously named the 2019-20 Kia NBA Defensive Player of the Year. He joins Michael Jordan (1987-88) and Hakeem Olajuwon (1993-94) as the only players to be selected as the Kia NBA Most Valuable Player and the Kia NBA Defensive Player of the Year in the same season. (The NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award was first presented in the 1982-83 season.) Antetokounmpo received 85 of 101 first-place votes and earned 962 total points from a global panel of 100 sportswriters and broadcasters as well as the Kia NBA Most Valuable Player Award fan vote. Los Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James received the other 16 first-place votes and finished in second place with 753 points. Houston Rockets guard James Harden (367 points) finished in third place, followed by Dallas Mavericks guard Luka Don\u010di\u0107 (200 points) in fourth place and LA Clippers forward Kawhi Leonard (168 points) in fifth place. Players received 10 points for each first-place vote, seven points for each second-place vote, five points for each third-place vote, three points for each fourth-place vote and one point for each fifth-place vote. The voting was conducted based on regular-season games played through March 11. The seeding games, which were played July 30 \u2013 Aug. 14 as part of the season restart, did not count toward voting for the Kia NBA Most Valuable Player Award or the league\u2019s other traditional end-of-season awards. In games played through March 11, Antetokounmpo averaged 29.6 points, 13.7 rebounds, 5.8 assists, 1.04 steals and 1.02 blocks in 30.9 minutes in 57 games. During that time, he ranked third in the NBA in both scoring average and rebounding average. Antetokounmpo also shot 54.7 percent from the field and sank 83 three-pointers, which is 31 more threes than he made in any of his previous six seasons. Behind Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee posted an NBA-leading 53-12 record in games played through March 11, a mark that included an 18-game winning streak Nov. 10 \u2013 Dec. 14. The four-time NBA All-Star selection helped the Bucks excel on both ends of the court as they led the league in net rating (outscoring opponents by 10.7 points per 100 possessions), scoring offense (118.6 ppg) and defensive rating (101.6 points allowed per 100 possessions) in their first 65 games of the season. Antetokounmpo was honored as the Kia NBA Eastern Conference Player of the Month for October\/November, December and January, in addition to being named the NBA Eastern Conference Player of the Week four times. He was also voted as a starter to the NBA All-Star Game for the fourth consecutive season, serving as a team captain for the second year in a row.

Maybe one of those is that zone defense is playing a big role in the NBA playoffs. A year after Toronto Raptors head coach Nick Nurse broke out a \u201cjanky\u201d box-and-one in the NBA Finals, zone defense remains more than just a gimmick to get a stop or two. And if the Miami Heat make it to this year\u2019s Finals, we may point to 20 minutes of zone defense on Thursday as a big reason why. The Boston Celtics\u2019 own defense was good enough in the conference semifinals to get past Nurse\u2019s Raptors, who played zone in all seven games of the series, throwing that janky box-and-one at Kemba Walker for almost the entire first half of Game 7. The Celtics\u2019 loss in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals on Tuesday was more about them letting their guard down defensively than it was about how they performed ( pretty well, actually ) on 14 possessions of Miami zone. Game 2 was another story. The Celtics blew a 17-point lead on Thursday in part because they couldn\u2019t execute against the Miami zone for much of the last 20 minutes of a 106-101 defeat that put them in an 0-2 hole. > Game 3: Celtics vs. Heat, Saturday at 8:30 ET on ESPN After handling the zone competently in Game 1, the Celtics scored the first two times Miami played zone in Game 2. Midway through the second quarter, they got an easy layup for Marcus Smart, who sneaked behind Duncan Robinson as Walker and Daniel Theis ran a pick-and-roll up top. Later in the second, Walker missed a wide-open pull-up jumper against the zone, but Jaylen Brown chased down the rebound and eventually made a pull-up himself , giving the Celtics that 17-point lead that they eventually blew. The Heat cut into the lead with some man-to-man stops at the end of the second quarter. But after the Celtics got Jayson Tatum to the line with a clever after-timeout play with a little more than eight minutes to go in the third, the Heat went back to the zone. And they would use it on almost every half-court possession from then on. While the Celtics were just as efficient against the zone as they were otherwise in Game 1, things were different in Game 2\u2026 For the most part, the Celtics\u2019 offense against the zone didn\u2019t look terrible. They were able to get into the paint and also attack from the baseline. But there\u2019s a difference between getting into the paint and scoring in the paint. After scoring 38 points in the paint (12 more than they had in all of Game 1) through the first 28 minutes on Thursday, the Celtics scored just eight points in the paint over the last 20 minutes. They made up some of that difference with free throws (7-for-8 through the first 28 minutes, 12-for-16 over the last 20), but it wasn\u2019t enough. Some of their jumpers against the zone were open, but open jumpers aren\u2019t layups. In all, the Celtics\u2019 16 empty possessions against the zone were a mix of bungled offense or bad decisions, open shots that were missed, tougher shots that were missed and great defensive plays. Bad offense Good looks That was the extent of the self-inflicted wounds against the zone on Thursday. The rest of the possessions that came up empty were more a result of how good the Heat were in that zone. There were some contested or rushed shots, for which this 10-foot floater from Walker is a good example\u2026 And there were some cases of the Heat just being athletic, smart and instinctive. For Heat coach Erik Spoelstra, the difference between the first half and the second half of Game 2 was less about man-to-man vs. zone and more about effort and energy. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t much that we liked about what we were doing defensively, man or zone,\u201d Spoelstra said afterward. \u201cI know everybody wants to talk about a scheme but for us it\u2019s disposition, effort, making multiple plays and multiple efforts, regardless of the scheme. And we were more committed there in the second half.\u201d Exhibit A in the effort-vs.-scheme argument is, well, the entire NBA. A lot of teams employ the same (or very similar) defensive schemes, but some execute those schemes better than others. It starts with buy-in and it continues with energy, cohesion, intelligence and instincts. And all of that was on display from the Heat over those last 20 minutes on Thursday. Here\u2019s some of their best work in the zone\u2026 Play 1: One way to beat a zone is to overload one side of the floor to the point where there\u2019s not enough defenders to guard everybody. The Celtics have done that at times, and early in the third-quarter stretch of zone, both Brown and Smart are open on the right side as Theis sets a screen for Walker\u2026 Walker gets the ball to Brown and he attacks the seam, drawing Bam Adebayo to the ball. But Adebayo is able to recover to Theis and block his layup. \u201cYou have to present a threat at the rim,\u201d Celtics coach Brad Stevens said of his team\u2019s execution against the zone, \u201cmake the guy in the middle play multiple guys, shrink the bottom in. I thought we did a good job attacking to the corners on several occasions. We missed shots or we drove it, dumped it to the roller and he just missed. But Adebayo had a big part of that.\u201d Play 2: The Heat apply some pressure in the backcourt (something they did a few times on Thursday) to work some extra seconds off the shot clock. Smart drives baseline and draws Adebayo and tries to hit Enes Kanter rolling to the rim. But Jae Crowder drops down from the opposite side to get his hand on the ball, forcing one of the Celtics\u2019 seven live-ball turnovers in the second half. Play 3: The Celtics seem to run a sideline out-of-bounds play for Tatum to flare off a back-screen from Grant Williams. He\u2019s open for a split second, but he\u2019s a few steps beyond the arc. Smart beats Derrick Jones Jr. off the dribble, but Jones makes an incredible recovery to contest (and maybe block) Smart\u2019s layup. (WYD, Kelly Olynyk?) Play 4: Smart flashes to the middle of the zone and quickly kicks the ball back out to Walker, but Butler and Tyler Herro keep Walker from launching off the catch. He gets into the paint, but Butler stays with him and Jones deflects his pass back to Smart. Tatum recovers the loose ball, but his pass to Brown on the baseline is wide. Play 5: On a baseline out-of-bounds play, Adebayo covers Tatum\u2019s dive to the rim and Butler bounces off of Theis\u2019 screen to deflect Smart\u2019s inbounds pass to Brown. Butler can sometimes get himself (and his team) into trouble with how aggressive he is in seeking steals and deflections. But it sure feels like he\u2019s guesses right more than he guesses wrong in those situations. He\u2019s one of two players who have played at least 100 minutes in these playoffs and have more steals than personal fouls. Kawhi Leonard finished with 30 steals and 29 fouls. Butler, who was one of two players (Memphis\u2019 Tyus Jones was the other) who played 1,000 regular season minutes with more steals than personal fouls, now has 25 and 20 through the Heat\u2019s 11 playoff games. You might have a hard time coming up with a better top line to a 2-3 zone than Butler and Jones ( more evidence here ). Having Adebayo as the back-line anchor is nice, too. \u201cIt\u2019s a hard zone to play against,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cWe did play well against it in Game 1. We played with way better pace than we did tonight. So we\u2019ll go back and look at it, figure out if it was a technical thing or a pace thing or an execution thing, or just not-as-focused-on-the-important-stuff thing.\u201d There was important stuff on the other end of the floor, especially in the third quarter , when the Heat scored 37 points on just 23 possessions, with Adebayo scoring 12 of those 37 in the restricted area. But the game really started going south for the Celtics when the zone slowed them down and kept them from getting to the basket. Spoelstra\u2019s it\u2019s-about-effort-more-than-scheme talk could mean that he doesn\u2019t see the zone as necessary to win more games in this series. Of course, he\u2019d ever give us any hint about how much he plans to use it going forward. Heck, his team played the most zone in the regular season, didn\u2019t play any zone through the first two rounds of the playoffs, and then had it ready for Boston in Game 1. Also, when the Heat went back to man-to-man for a couple of possessions midway through the fourth quarter on Thursday, the Celtics got a dunk from Tatum and a pull-up 3 from Walker . Maybe that was a temporary change of disposition and maybe the scheme had something to do with it. Whether it\u2019s about scheme or disposition (it\u2019s both), we can expect the Heat to go back to the zone at some point in Game 3. With more film to watch, Boston will have a better idea of what works and what doesn\u2019t. The Celtics\u2019 own disposition can be just as critical as that of the Heat. They\u2019ll certainly look to get into their offense quicker to avoid rushed shots late in the clock. And they may have an additional playmaker \u2014 Gordon Hayward, who hasn\u2019t played since the first game of the first round \u2014 to help find holes in the defense, maybe as the center in a tougher-to-guard small lineup that\u2019s played a total of 18 minutes this season. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

The verbal jabs and blatant signs of disrespect from the LA Clippers had reached the point of no return for the Denver Nuggets\u2019 elder statesman. With 50.1 seconds to play before halftime of Game 5 in that Western Conference semifinal, and the Nuggets absorbing a pounding from the Clippers, Millsap decided it was time to take a stand. If the Nuggets, down 3-1 in the series and facing elimination, were going out, they were going to do it giving as good as they were getting from the favored Clippers. So when Marcus Morris Sr. and Millsap got tangled up under the basket fighting for space to chase a rebound, it clicked. Morris turned to face down the man shoving back and was met face-to-face by the usually measured Millsap, who was done backing up. > Game 1: Nuggets vs. Lakers, 9 ET on TNT Everything about that series \u2014 and ultimately this postseason \u2014 changed in that moment for the Nuggets, who rallied for a dramatic Game 5 win to keep their season alive. And then did the same again in Game 6 and Game 7 to shock the Clippers and set up a date with the Los Angeles Lakers in the Western Conference finals. But in that moment, Millsap recognized the need to show the Nuggets had arrived and had earned the right to that prime real estate as much as the Clippers, Lakers or anyone else toiling in the NBA bubble the past two plus months. \u201cI felt it. it definitely felt like everything changed right there,\u201d Millsap, the only player on the Nuggets\u2019 roster over 30, and a no-nonsense veteran with universal respect in the locker room, said of that defining moment between he and Morris. \u201cAnd to be honest, it should have happened earlier. I know the first game they blew us out and there was a lot of chatter and a lot of talk from those guys, telling us we were soft and all that stuff. So it was past overdue. And at that time, for me at least, enough was enough.\u201d Jamal Murray, All-NBA center Nikola Jokic and the rest of the Nuggets felt the same way. And it manifested in a historic effort to reach the conference finals \u2014 the Nuggets are the first team in NBA playoff history to rally from 3-1 deficits in multiple series in the same postseason; they did so in the first round against Utah as well. But what might look like some overnight fluke or global-pandemic-produced success story to the outside world is something totally different to the Nuggets. It\u2019s the fruits of a relentless five-year grind to build a legitimate contender under coach Mike Malone, whose team has shown a resilience unmatched in this bubble environment. Against all odds, the Nuggets believe. Even when no one else outside of the organization, and their most loyal fans, is buying them as a true contender. Murray demanded respect after they crushed the Clippers in Game 7, calling out everyone who has and continues to doubt them. \u201cYou\u2019ve got [Shaquille O\u2019Neal], you\u2019ve got Charles [Barkley], you\u2019ve got \u2014 I think \u2014 [ESPN NBA writer] Zach Lowe \u2026 [ESPN analyst Stephen A. Smith], all y\u2019all better start giving this team some damn respect, because we put in the work and we\u2019ve got a resilient team,\u201d Murray said. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have been down 3-1, but to come back from 3-1 against the Clippers is a big achievement. So it was fun just to change that narrative, where y\u2019all can finally shut up and start to change that narrative and putting us in a better light.\u201d Malone has been preaching belief in the system, in each other and in the work put in by the entire group from the moment he arrived. The Nuggets have drafted extremely well \u2014 Jokic, Murray, Gary Harris and Monte Morris, along with prized rookies Michael Porter Jr. and Bol Bol \u2014 and found the ideal pieces in free agency or on the fringes \u2014 Millsap, Jerami Grant, Torrey Craig, Mason Plumlee and others \u2014 to flesh out one of the deepest and most versatile rosters in the league. They have a player development program that has helped Jokic pivot from overweight toward two-time All-NBA status as arguably the best center in the league. Murray, the breakout star of this postseason, is on a similar trajectory. \u201cHis development, his growth\u2026 I think when we showed the belief that we had in him by the contract we gave him, you\u2019re a foundational piece, we believe in you,\u201d Malone said, referencing Murray\u2019s recent max extension. \u201cThis is something you have to understand, take responsibility for. You\u2019ve got to be better on the court, your preparation, your professionalism, your work ethic, and your leadership. He\u2019s taken all those things into account and tried to be better in every one of those areas, which is all you want. Now you have two core pieces in Nikola and Jamal that are still very young, bought in, have grown up in front of our eyes. \u201cI think most NBA teams, most pro sports teams don\u2019t do it that way. It\u2019s always a quick fix, go grab a guy, rent a guy. We built this from the ground up, which makes it that much more satisfying.\u201d The coach is another key ingredient. With the unyielding energy of Malone, who celebrated his 49th birthday on the same night they popped the Clippers to clinch the franchise\u2019s first trip to the conference finals since 2009, the Nuggets have a leader steeped in the process. \u201cI think the biggest question aside from themes, plays, personnel, is are our guys satisfied?\u201d Malone said. \u201cMan, we just made Playoff history, down 3-1, down 3-1 [again]. We\u2019ve gotten to the Western Conference Finals only the second time in franchise history. Take a breath, come up for air. The Lakers aren\u2019t coming up for air. They\u2019ve been waiting. I know LeBron, having been around him. They\u2019re going to try to come out and send a message. \u201cI don\u2019t think our guys are satisfied. That\u2019s going to be the greatest challenge, tomorrow can we match the intensity. I thought in Game 1 against the Clippers we did it for a quarter and a half, couldn\u2019t sustain it. I think we were just gassed. Hopefully tomorrow we\u2019re able to put forth a 48-minute effort.\u201d The Lakers aren\u2019t buying the humble underdog approach. James and Malone go back to their days in Cleveland, when they were chasing the same things they\u2019ll fight for in this series together. Malone was on Mike Brown\u2019s staff, working with LeBron before he was the three-time champion and Finals regular he would become in Miami and through that second stint in Cleveland. Knowing Malone\u2019s character and work ethic, watching his team take the Clippers apart down the stretch in three straight games is all the evidence James needed to know that they\u2019re in for a scrap in this series. \u201cVery resilient, very confident, very driven, very well-coached team,\u201d LeBron said. \u201cIt takes a lot of energy, effort, a lot of desperation to be able to come back from a 3-1 deficit. They did it twice. So the respect level is out of this world for what we have for this ballclub. That\u2019s how we\u2019re going into this series, understanding what they\u2019re capable of, where they stand. \u201cWhen you work hard on your craft, you see others working just as hard on their craft, it becomes organic and it becomes mutual respect. I know how much Coach Mo put into our schemes, put into our productivity, put into what we needed to do to go out and win ballgames when we were together in Cleveland. I saw that. So the respect level, just seeing what he was putting into his craft, it made it easy for me to grow likeness to him.\u201d Millsap said the Nuggets won\u2019t change their approach, not now. Not after what they\u2019ve been through to get here. So he\u2019ll gladly continue to remind his teammates that for all the work they\u2019ve put in, there remains plenty of folks who view them the way the Clippers did.  He doesn\u2019t have to do any convincing in the locker room. \u201cI mean, even when we beat the Clippers, they were talking how the Clippers lost,\u201d Jokic said. \u201cThey don\u2019t think about us. Not even the Lakers, not even anybody.\u201d * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

That was the lethal one. The game-breaker. The reason for Smart\u2019s and reportedly other Celtics\u2019 post-game anger. And the proof of that old saw that the playoffs are all about adjustments. Coach Erik Spoelstra and the Miami Heat adjusted midway through Game 2 like the Eastern Conference champions they\u2019ll be in a few days, if the Celtics don\u2019t adjust to the adjustments starting Saturday. > Game 3: Celtics vs. Heat, Saturday at 8:30 ET on ESPN A stingy zone defense, a jump-started Bam Adebayo, a late push of freelance creativity from Goran Dragic and the Heat\u2019s increasingly predictable resiliency flipped what began as an assured Boston performance. All that Heat freshness after halftime gave the south Floridians a 2-0 lead in the series, getting them halfway to the 2020 Finals before the West participant Lakers and Nuggets have even laced up their sneakers. The Celtics, after losing Game 1 in overtime, looked to have found their karma and their Kemba through two quarters Thursday. They led early, and pushed ahead by 17 before getting to the break at 60-47. Point guard Kemba Walker, after a cockeyed shooting night in the opener, was leading the way with 14 points on 6-for-10 from the field. The Celtics were hitting 58.1 percent as a group, while Miami, beyond Duncan Robinson\u2019s 4-for-9 shooting on 3-pointers, had little working at either end. \u201cWell, Boston was really getting us on our heels in the first half,\u201d Spoelstra said, \u201cand I don\u2019t think anybody was in any kind of rhythm or disposition defensively and a lot of it was them. They were backing us up and everything.\u201d So? Halftime, that interlude for studio shows, bathroom breaks and on-the-fly fixes. The Heat staff found some, throwing a zone in which its frontcourt guys often played out top. Even a little effectiveness helped Miami get back to playing in its personality, the scariest thing for Boston as this series plays out. Said Spoelstra: \u201cI know everybody wants to talk about a scheme, but for us it\u2019s disposition, effort, making multiple plays and multiple efforts, regardless of the scheme, and we were more committed there in the second half.\u201d The third quarter began innocently enough, Boston still up 67-52 at the 9:43 mark. But Adebayo had been activated after a quiet first half (4 points, 5 rebounds). The Miami center got a block, a couple of dunks, a steal and two more dunks in a span of less than four minutes. \u201cCoach came up to me in the third, was like, \u2018I need All-Defensive team now,\u2019\u201d Adebayo said. \u201cFrom there, I had to start it on defense and then my offense started flowing with it.\u201d It was Adebayo\u2019s floater at 4:17 that wiped Boston\u2019s lead completely. The Celtics got up only 12 shots in the quarter \u2014 seven turnovers against that Miami defense cost them possessions \u2014 and made four. Heck, the Heat were 5-for-12 on threes alone. \u201cWe pulled apart and we didn\u2019t play well,\u201d Boston coach Brad Stevens said. \u201cWe\u2019re not beating this team if we\u2019re not completely connected on both ends of the court. Got to get back to being that.\u201d Zones often turn an offensive team passive, searching for perfect shots rather than attacking along the baseline or at the rim. Stevens didn\u2019t think his guys were stymied \u2014 they had seen a variation of it in the previous round from Toronto \u2014 but it got the results Spoelstra sought. \u201cIt\u2019s a hard zone to play against [but] we did play well against it in Game 1,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cWe played with way better pace \u2026 So we\u2019ll go back and look at it, figure out if it was a technical thing or a pace thing or an execution thing or just not-as-focused-on-the-important-stuff thing.\u201d For those following along, this was only the latest in Miami\u2019s series of knockout-punch quarters. In Game 1 on Tuesday, their 35-23 fourth quarter erased the Celtics\u2019 12-point lead through three, making the Heat\u2019s OT victory possible. One round earlier, they seized absolute control against Milwaukee in Game 3 by undressing the Bucks 40-13 in the fourth. This time the damage came in the third, and Dragic was the difference in the fourth. Boston\u2019s last real push built a 94-89 lead, but it was down to two when Dragic returned with 3:17 left. He scored seven of Miami\u2019s final 11 points, controlling the ball and the pace in the time left. Said Spoelstra: \u201cYou just have to create something out of nothing [sometimes], and Goran was able to do that down the stretch.\u201d Now it\u2019s on Stevens and the Celtics to create something out of nothing so far in the series. The NBA announced after the game that there will be three days between Games 3 (Saturday) and 4 (Wednesday), and sitting around that long in a 3-0 hole would likely not improve the moods in Boston\u2019s locker room. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Anyone within earshot of the Celtics\u2019 locker room at AdventHealth Arena after Thursday night\u2019s 106-101 Game 2 loss heard it loud and clear, as Smart was audibly screaming amid other voices in a heated exchange. It didn\u2019t stop after Smart exited the locker room and headed for a nearby bathroom. Smart exited the building without speaking the media, leaving Celtics coach Brad Stevens and teammates Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum and Kemba Walker to answer questions about what had gone on.

But the series is far from over. And we got to get ready for Game 3. You, this how it goes. In families there\u2019s up and downs, there\u2019s fights and emotions.

And you know, we\u2019re going to hold each other accountable and we\u2019ve got to do what it takes to come out and execute next game.\u201d When asked if what happened was needed, Brown agreed and acknowledged that a good Heat team is forcing the Celtics into all sorts of uncomfortable situations through the course of the first two games of the series. \u201cI think so,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of people are passionate, emotional and I\u2019m one of those people, so I recognize it as that. I recognize it as emotions and passions and I don\u2019t recognize it as nothing else. How the media might see it or whatever, that\u2019s all it is passion just being expressed.

The Miami Heat and Boston Celtics went into overtime on Tuesday, with Bam Adebayo\u2019s incredible block of Jayson Tatum the difference in Miami\u2019s 117-114 victory. The Celtics led by 14 early in the fourth quarter, and that should have been a big enough cushion with how well they\u2019ve defended in these playoffs. But it wasn\u2019t, because the Celtics stagnated offensively and allowed the Heat to score critical early-clock buckets . > Game 2: Heat vs. Celtics, 7 ET on ESPN Amazingly, these are the only two teams that haven\u2019t trailed by 15 points during these playoffs, another reason to believe that this will continue to be a closely-contested series. Here are three things to watch for in Game 2: Heading into the 2020 Eastern Conference finals, we were among those who pointed to Boston\u2019s Marcus Smart and Miami\u2019s Tyler Herro as potential \u201cX-factors\u201d for their respective teams. But once a series is underway, underperformers are the ones who get outsized attention. And one game into the Celtics-Heat showdown, the guys capable of giving more are Miami\u2019s Duncan Robinson and Boston\u2019s Kemba Walker. Both had strong regular seasons to whet their teams\u2019 appetites for the playoffs. Both have had their moments so far in the Orlando bubble, even early in the postseason. But both are sputtering. And the first one to get on track could pull his team right along with him. Robinson\u2019s emergence in his second season caught rivals by surprise. Undrafted out of Michigan in 2018, signed as a two-way player, Robinson averaged 13.5 points and shot 44.6 percent on 3-pointers, starting 68 games for the Heat. He\u2019s at 10.1 points in 10 playoff appearances, though, and his accuracy from the arc has dipped to 38.2 percent. Over Miami\u2019s past seven games , Robinson has missed 33 of 48 3-pointers, including a 2-for-7 night in Game 1. A possible explanation is that the Robinson scouting report is complete and good teams do not neglect him in their game plan. It didn\u2019t help Tuesday that the Miami wing got in early foul trouble \u2014 defending without fouling is vital to the Heat\u2019s formula \u2014 and Herro\u2019s play has boosted the rookie as an option for some of Robinson\u2019s minutes anyway. \u201cSometimes you do all the right things and the ball doesn\u2019t go in,\u201d Robinson told The South Florida Sun-Sentinel Wednesday . \u201cIt requires adjustments on myself, also, to be more aggressive and also to make some.\u201d The Celtics similarly are searching for answers with Walker, or at least ways to shake him loose. Over their past seven games , the point guard has shot 20.4 percent on 3-pointers (10-for-49) and 38.8 percent overall. In Tuesday\u2019s Game 1, he wasn\u2019t having his usual success blowing by defenders, either. Boston center Daniel Theis talked Wednesday of how teammates might help Walker. \u201cWe got to help him [get] easy looks, especially me,\u201d Theis said. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get him open more on screens when he\u2019s got the ball, and even other guys, we\u2019ve got to get them open. \u201cSomething where he is off the ball, you have to set the screen for him so he\u2019s coming off screens and maybe a catch-and-shoot 3 instead of just iso and an off-the-dribble, step-back 3. Especially in the beginning of the game. We need him out there and we need him to be aggressive.\u201d Walker was hardest on himself after the opener, talking about how \u201cterrible\u201d he played in going 1-for-9 from the arc, 6-for-19 overall, and only showing a familiar spark later in the game (10 points in the fourth quarter plus overtime). That glimmer was enough for Celtics coach Brad Stevens to double-down on Walker. \u201cI don\u2019t lose any sleep over Kemba,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cNobody cares more than Kemba. Nobody wants to play better. We are constantly going to the drawing board to figure out how we can make his life a little bit easier from our own perspectives. So we\u2019ll keep riding.\u201d \u2014 Steve Aschburner Zone defense has seen an uptick the last couple of seasons and no team played more zone defense this season than the Heat, according to Synergy play-type tracking. And then the Heat didn\u2019t play any zone against the Indiana Pacers or Milwaukee Bucks in the first two rounds of the playoffs. But the Celtics struggled against multiple Toronto zones in the conference semifinals. Over seven games, Boston scored 90.3 points per 100 possessions (93 on 103) against the Raptors\u2019 different zones and 109.2 points per 100 possessions otherwise. So the Heat broke out their zone late in the first quarter on Tuesday, and they played it for 14 of the Celtics\u2019 99 possessions of Game 1. The results were mixed, but the Celtics generally handled the zone better than they did for most of the Toronto series. They scored 16 points on those 14 zone possessions, a rate (1.14 points per possession) better than their marks from all but one game in the last round (10 points on eight zone possessions in Game 5). A few of the empty possessions came when the Heat went to zone as the Celtics were taking the ball out of bounds with a short shot clock.* And there were a few really good looks against the zone \u2014 a wide-open corner 3 , an open pull-up jumper , and another open 3 from top of the arc \u2014 that Walker just missed. * This includes the possession in which Adebayo blocked Tatum at the end of overtime. It\u2019s tough to distinguish whether that was a zone or the Heat switching everything, even non-screen exchanges before the inbounds pass. Marcus Smart made a long, pull-up 3 in one of those short-clock situations, but the Celtics\u2019 other five scores against the zone came when they were able to get into the paint via the dribble or pass. One of those was a timely cut from Brad Wanamaker, leading to an open 3 for Tatum\u2026 We\u2019ll probably see more zone in this series. But Celtics were basically as efficient against zone on Tuesday as they were otherwise (98 points on 85 possessions, 1.15 per). Fourteen possessions is a small sample size, but we might not see longer zone stretches than that going forward. The Heat\u2019s man-to-man defense is a little like a zone in that they\u2019re switching most screens to keep the ball in front of them. \u2014 John Schuhmann On three different occasions in Game 1, the Heat ran a sideline out-of-bounds (SLOB) play that you\u2019ll see a few teams run ( here are two examples from the Milwaukee Bucks). It\u2019s fairly simple, with Adebayo flashing to the strong-side elbow and the inbounder (usually Jimmy Butler) getting a back screen from another guard coming up from the strong-side block. But it forces defenses to make a tough decision in how it guards the back-screen (shooters make the best screeners) and it has a lot of options without even involving the two guys on the weak side of the floor. Here are several examples of the play from the Heat, with the three Game 1 instances at the end: Early in the third quarter, Walker switches the back-screen from Dragic. So Butler seals Walker under the basket, gets the entry feed from Adebayo, and drops in an easy jump hook. Midway through overtime, Tatum wants to avoid that mismatch, so he stays attached to Butler when Jae Crowder sets the back-screen. But Walker still gets pushed into the paint and Crowder is left alone on the wing for a huge 3. Later in OT, Walker is already guarding Butler, so Herro doesn\u2019t bother with the back-screen and vacates the area. But before Adebayo can get the ball to Butler, Smart comes over from the weak side and rescues Walker. That causes Butler to hesitate and the Celtics force a tough 3 from Herro as the shot clock expires. \u2014 John Schuhmann The NBA\u2019s Last Two-Minute Report off Game 1 showed three incorrect decisions by the officials Tuesday, each of which seemed to favor Boston. One, however, might not have.  There was Derrick Jones Jr.\u2019s erroneous foul on Marcus Smart before the Celtics inbounded the ball with 22 seconds left in regulation. There was Tatum\u2019s uncalled traveling violation with 7.3 seconds left, before he launched and missed a 3-pointer at the end of that final quarter, tied 106-106. And there was a wrongly assessed foul on Goran Dragic with 32.7 seconds remaining in overtime. The foul that Smart sold when Jones bumped into him was the result of Walker pushing the Heat player into his teammate. Because the clock hadn\u2019t started, the Celtics got one free throw (made by Tatum) and the Celtics again got to inbound. But that free throw tied the score at 106-106. That\u2019s when Boston settled for Tatum\u2019s isolation shot on its final possession \u2014 and then complained afterward that their offense had gotten too stagnant. Had the Celtics still trailed 106-105, they almost certainly would have gone quicker, getting more action to get a closer shot or create contract to get to the line for the tie or lead. Smart\u2019s free throw seemed to lull them, as far as objective and energy. \u2014 Steve Aschburner"},{"id":25659,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-sacramento-kings-hiring-monte-mcnair-head-basketball-operations","date":"2020-09-17","title":"Kings hiring Monte McNair as general manager","content":" The Sacramento Kings are hiring Monte McNair as general manager, the team announced.

The Miami Heat came back from a 14-point fourth-quarter deficit to win Game 1 in overtime . Bam Adebayo saved the game with one of the best blocks you will ever see and Jimmy Butler was 2-for-2 on shots to tie or take the lead in the final minute of the fourth quarter or OT, having shot 1-for-15 in those situations prior to Tuesday. Jayson Tatum was 0-for-2 on final-minute shots for the lead or the tie , and offensive stagnation was an issue for Boston. But the other end of the floor was the larger problem for the Celtics as they blew that 14-point lead. The Heat scored 35 points on their final 20 possessions of the game, part of a wacky sequence of events where Miami was more than twice as efficient in the second and fourth quarters (72 points on 43 possessions, 1.67 per) than it was in the first and third (34 on 46, 0.74 per). > Game 2: Heat vs. Celtics, Thursday at 7 ET on ESPN This was actually the slowest-paced game of the Eastern Conference playoffs thus far. So don\u2019t let the low score (106-106 after regulation) fool you. Despite the anemic first and third quarters, the Heat scored 117 points on just 99 possessions, making Game 1 the Celtics\u2019 worst defensive game of the postseason thus far (30 total games), with the two teams combining for just 198 possessions in 53 minutes. The slow pace overall doesn\u2019t mean that both teams walked the ball up the floor for 53 minutes. In fact, the Heat\u2019s 16 fast break points in Game 1 were more than they had in any game in the first round and just two fewer than their high in the conference semis . It was their transition game that sparked their offense early in the second quarter and ultimately made the difference on Tuesday. But more surprising than the Heat having success in transition was the Celtics allowing it to happen. One of the biggest keys to Boston\u2019s conference semifinals victory over the Toronto Raptors was transition defense. After the Raptors led both the regular season (18.8) and the first round (18.5) in fast break points per game, the Celtics held them to just 11.4 per contest in their seven-game series. If you want to know why Pascal Siakam struggled against the Cs, start with the fact that only three (2.7%) of his 110 field goal attempts came in the first six seconds of the shot clock, according to Second Spectrum tracking. In both the regular season and in the first round, 20% of Siakam\u2019s shots came in the first six seconds of the clock, but the Celtics cut off his transition opportunities, and he\u2019s not nearly as efficient in the half-court as he is in the open floor. The Heat, in general, do not run like the Raptors. They ranked second in transition efficiency according to Synergy tracking, but only 13.3% of the Heat\u2019s regular-season possessions, the league\u2019s fourth lowest rate , were in transition. Through the first two rounds of the playoffs, that number was just 11.2%. Maybe the Celtics let their guard down a bit? If that\u2019s the case, their guard will be back up after watching the film from Game 1. After the Heat scored just 20 points on their first 25 possessions of the game, Kelly Olynyk began a run of nine straight scores by squeezing in a reverse layup around Grant Williams. And then Goran Dragic went to work, sparking a stretch where five of Miami\u2019s next seven scores came from quick attacks against a Boston defense that just wasn\u2019t ready\u2026 Play 1: After Kemba Walker feeds Semi Ojeleye for a dunk, he\u2019s not prepared for a Dragic push. By the time Walker gets over to the left side of the floor, Dragic is going downhill on his way to a short runner in the paint. Play 2: After a dead ball turnover on the very next possession, Walker is in front of Dragic, but not in guarding position. Dragic abandons the set play (likely an entry pass to Adebayo at the left elbow) and attacks Walker again, getting an even better look than he had on the previous possession. Play 3: Two possessions later, Dragic rebounds a Brad Wanamaker miss and Wanamaker does a good job of stopping Dragic\u2019s initial push. But he passes ahead to Tyler Herro, who immediately attacks Grant Williams off the dribble, draws help from Walker, and passes to a wide-open Andre Iguodala in the corner. Play 4: The Celtics call timeout, but turn the ball over on their next possession. Butler pushes the ball up the floor and Tatum runs back to the paint instead of identifying Duncan Robinson in transition. Wanamaker is a little late with his contest and then watches what happens next. When Butler rebounds Robinson\u2019s miss, Wanamaker isn\u2019t there to contest the second-chance 3. Play 5: When Tatum hits the floor after a tough miss in the paint, the Heat have a 5-on-4 break. The other Celtics get back, but Jaylen Brown allows Butler to get between him and the basket and Herro hits Butler for an and-one. Credit the Heat for pushing the ball. Effective field goal percentage is highest in the first six seconds of the shot clock and taking advantage of a defense that\u2019s not set is a great way to get some easier points. But the Celtics will look at those plays above and realize that they could have been better. Walker not being ready to defend Dragic, Wanamaker ball-watching after contesting Robinson\u2019s initial 3, and Brown not taking the extra step needed to keep Butler out of the paint\u2026 Those are all mistakes that can be cleaned up with better focus and effort. Transition defense can come down to reaction time, because one step can be the difference between a contested shot or an open one. One second can be the difference between staying attached to an opponent running the floor and that same opponent running free. The Heat found more transition opportunities in coming back from that 14-point, fourth-quarter deficit, and they again got help from the Celtics\u2026 Play 1: On first glance, this is just a case of the Heat having numbers after a live-ball turnover. But look at where Dragic and Wanamaker are as Tatum\u2019s pass is in the air\u2026 Yes, Dragic has the inside lane, but he also reacts faster. He actually gives up that inside lane to run wide, but still has three steps on Wanamaker (who doesn\u2019t exactly have the strides of Usain Bolt) by the time he crosses into the frontcourt\u2026 Play 2: After Brown makes a 3, he thinks he\u2019s guarding Adebayo. And by the time he realizes that he\u2019s supposed to be guarding Jae Crowder, it\u2019s too late and Crowder gets a layup. Play 3: Daniel Theis picks up Crowder in transition, but trailing Crowder is Robinson, and Wanamaker is slow to meet him for the trail 3. Play 4: Walker hits a tough floater to put the Celtics up three with a little more than a minute to go in regulation, but the Heat get the ball up the floor quickly. Walker keeps Tyler Herro from launching a quick pull-up 3, but then leaves him for a split second as Marcus Smart (who lunged to deflect Dragic\u2019s pass) recovers back to Dragic. Herro reloads and drains a huge shot to make it a one-possession game. Play 5: In overtime, Adebayo leaks out after contesting a Tatum step-back 3 and gets an easy dunk. How do you stop that? Well, as Tatum was shooting the ball, Walker was standing above the 3-point line on the left side of the floor, and he didn\u2019t move until it was far too late\u2026 According to Second Spectrum, the Heat were 12-for-16 in the first six seconds of the shot clock in Game 1, with the 16 attempts being more than Toronto had in the first six seconds in any of the last five games of the conference semifinals. Dragic had five more shots in the first six seconds on Tuesday (he was 6-for-8) than Siakam had over seven games against the Celtics (1-for-3). \u201cTransition defense really stands out,\u201d Celtics coach Brad Stevens said of the Celtics\u2019 fourth-quarter collapse. \u201cThat Herro three with a minute left in regulation was a killer.\u201d The Celtics\u2019 mistakes weren\u2019t limited to transition situations. Botched switches led to a dunk for Butler midway through the fourth quarter and a wide-open 3 for Jae Crowder in overtime. \u201cThey executed very well down the stretch,\u201d Smart said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t, especially on the defensive end. Miscommunication on a lot of guys\u2019 part. And in transition, we allowed them to do what they do best, and that\u2019s get out and run.\u201d Given how many mistakes they\u2019ll see in the film, the Celtics will probably lean toward \u201cWe need to play better\u201d more than \u201cWe need to make changes\u201d for Game 2. The Heat, with their movement and versatility on offense, will continue to test them more than Toronto did on that end of the floor, but the Celtics are a better defensive team than what they showed in Game 1. Heck, they showed it in the first quarter. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t get anything going [early] and that\u2019s a big-time credit to their defense,\u201d Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. \u201cThey got us out of our normal rhythm. It wasn\u2019t about us. That\u2019s just what they do, and Goran was able to shake free a few times and put some points on the board.\u201d Both teams will take a close look at how matchup-hunting worked for them. Miami was often looking to get Walker switched onto Butler, while the Celtics got very iso-heavy in the fourth quarter and overtime. Overall, their offense wasn\u2019t a big problem (this was only their third loss of the season when scoring more than 115 points per 100 possessions), but the Celtics will certainly look for ways to get the ball moving against the Heat\u2019s switch-everything (or zone) defense. The Heat did trap some of Walker\u2019s pick-and-rolls, and he handled that well, creating a couple of open 3s. The Celtics were switching a lot too and both teams have already tried slipping out of screens to catch defenders off balance. Gordon Hayward\u2019s status will remain a topic of conversation. He hasn\u2019t played since spraining his ankle in the first game of the first round, but he\u2019s been ramping up his activity over the last week. Hayward taking minutes from Wanamaker and Semi Ojeleye will be a heck of an upgrade whenever it happens. It might be tough for the Heat to shorten their rotation after an overtime game in which five guys played 39 minutes or more, but they played 10 on Tuesday and Kendrick Nunn\u2019s minutes were a struggle. They could eventually go back to their first-round, no-Nunn, nine-man rotation. A 1-0 series lead won\u2019t preclude the Heat from making their own adjustments. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can set the tone in a long series,\u201d Spoelstra said. \u201cObviously it\u2019s much better to get the win and go work on your teaching points from there, but we understand how we can\u2019t get too carried away with just one win.\u201d * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

Not for a team with the championship coach, the reigning Finals MVP, the superstar sidekick, the Sixth Man of the Year bench brigade and a rebranded franchise bankrolled by the richest owner in the league. The LA Clippers were finally dressed for championship success. But that music pounding through the walls late into the night at AdventHealth Arena were coming from the opposing locker room, where the Denver Nuggets were busy celebrating their stunning and historic 104-89 victory over the Clippers in Game 7. The Nuggets will take that spot opposite the Los Angeles Lakers in the Western Conference finals, the one everyone had reserved for this star-studded Clippers team that crumbled under the pressure down the stretch in three straight games to get bounced from the bubble eight wins shy of their ultimate goal. Instead of a historic romp to the conference finals for the first time in franchise annals, the Clippers exited the NBA bubble on a soggy Tuesday night as punchlines once again. They ended their season on the wrong side of history, eliminated by a Nuggets team that, following their victory over Utah in the first round, became the first to come back from 3-1 deficits in consecutive series. \u201cI\u2019m the coach and I\u2019ll take any blame for it,\u201d Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. \u201cBut we didn\u2019t meet our expectations, clearly. Honestly, you could just see the difference in the two teams. That team\u2019s been together. We haven\u2019t. And you could see it as the games went on.\u201d The Nuggets got a 40-point masterpiece from Jamal Murray and a 16-point, 22-rebound, 13-assist triple-double from All-NBA center Nikola Jokic. Their gaudy performances only served to highlight the vanishing act of the Clippers\u2019 two biggest stars with everything on the line. Reigning Finals MVP Kawhi Leonard scored just 14 points while missing 16 of 22 shots, only marginally better than All-Star swingman Paul George\u2019s 10 points on 4-for-16 shooting. \u201cIt hurts. It hurts. But we move on,\u201d George said. \u201cYear 1 together, first run together, of course we wanted to win this. But we\u2019ve been very optimistic about us being together and building something going down the road.\u201d It\u2019ll be hard to sell the long-term plan when many considered these Clippers the title favorites all season, and particularly with their newest additions \u2014 veterans Marcus Morris Sr. and Reggie Jackson \u2014 and healthy players all in place for the playoffs. Fans and pundits alike will pick over the bones of this Clippers team, and with good reason. They came up woefully short of expectations, given all the championship bluster and hype that followed last summer\u2019s free agent acquisition of Leonard, and the blockbuster trade with Oklahoma City (exchanging promising young point guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and a staggering five first-round draft picks for George) that was supposed to have shifted the balance of power in the league in favor of the Clippers. \u201cY\u2019all are only doing your job,\u201d Morris said. \u201cY\u2019all are supposed to pick us apart. Y\u2019all are supposed to kill us. We had it in our hands. Great team over there. They played together. They stuck with it. And I\u2019m expecting the backlash, but that doesn\u2019t define who you are as a man or as a basketball player. We couldn\u2019t get it together. You know, next year we\u2019ll be right back at it \u2026 and I can\u2019t wait.\u201d Next year? That power shift was supposed to be now. All the pieces were in place. But they never looked like that championship team they believed themselves to be, at least not consistently. They built those big leads against the Nuggets and couldn\u2019t hold them. The Nuggets schooled them in the second half for a third straight game. Eight times in franchise history, including Games 5, 6 and 7 of this series, the Clippers have had an opportunity to play their way into the conference finals. And they\u2019ve failed to cash in each and every time. \u201cRight when they put pressure on us,\u201d Rivers said, \u201chonestly, I thought we just didn\u2019t come through.\u201d That won\u2019t stop the Clippers from trying to make sense of it from their own perspective. Rivers, Leonard and George all talked about the struggles they had with their chemistry and cohesion. Their playoff run is the first time all season that Rivers had his full compliment of talent available. None of that explains how you go up 3-1, with double-digit leads in each of the final three games, and still couldn\u2019t put the Nuggets away. \u201cTo be up 3-1 and lose multiple leads is probably the toughest part,\u201d Morris said. \u201cThere were times up 3-1 when we had this series in our hands. We had time to put them away and I think that was the toughest time, to be up 20 multiple times and not be able to come up with the wins.\u201d No, the toughest part comes Friday, when the Lakers and Nuggets suit up for Game 1 of the conference finals to decide who will represent the West and have the opportunity to play for that Larry O\u2019Brien Championship Trophy the Clippers have been talking about for more than a year. * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

Blown up at the rim by Miami defensive ace Bam Adebayo on an attempted soaring dunk. 2. Loitering on the perimeter for too long, pounding the ball and then hoisting a low-percentage and needlessly distant 3-pointer when all the Celtics needed was one point. Had things gone in that order, human nature pretty much would have covered Tatum\u2019s decisions on two plays that proved costly in Miami\u2019s 117-114 overtime victory to open the Eastern Conference finals. When you get destroyed in the paint on a brilliant defensive play even more athletic than your own, you understandably might be a wee shy about venturing in there again. >> Game 2: Thursday, 7 ET (ESPN) Problem was, the order was not flipped. The laconic effort and dubious clock management on Tatum\u2019s shot from deep on the left wing happened first. It was a lazy possession by the Celtics that again raised questions about their late-game execution, an issue that showed itself as they were surviving a seven-game series against Toronto in the conference semis. As breathtaking as Adebayo\u2019s instinctive reaction was to meet Tatum at the rim and not only block the dunk but control the rebound, that never would have happened had Boston handled things better as the fourth quarter ticked away. \u201cI think obviously switching has something to do with it,\u201d Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. \u201cWe need to handle it better, there\u2019s no question about it. Not only was there probably too much pounding of the ball, it was also not as much space the way they were guarding. We need to do a better job of that.\u201d It\u2019s worth noting that Stevens contributed to any matchups issues and a traffic jam about 29 feet from the basket when he called timeout with 22 seconds left in regulation. Jimmy Butler had just put the Heat in front, 106-105, with a 3-pointer from the right corner. By pausing, the Celtics did more than allow Miami to get its defense set for the halfcourt. It enabled Heat coach Erik Spoelstra to sub in the defenders he wanted, Derrick Jones Jr. and Andre Iguodala for Goran Dragic and Tyler Herro. It was the peskier, stickier Jones over whom Tatum launched his shot. Stevens referred several times to watching the film and fixing things before Game 2. But he didn\u2019t throw Tatum under any of the buses moving folks around on the Disney campus. \u201cI trust that he\u2019ll make the right decision,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cHe\u2019s a hell of a player. When he has the ball, I feel good about it.\u201d Stevens is renowned for his ATOs, those after-timeout plays that light up scoreboards and NBA writers\u2019 eyes. In this instance, Step 1 would have been moving the ball and some players in the 22 seconds allotted. A mid-range jumper, a layup, even splitting a pair of free throws with little or no time left would have been every bit as effective at a vastly higher percentage. But the Celtics had gotten stagnant offensively earlier in the game, costing themselves leads as big as 13 points in the first half and 14 early in the fourth quarter. And that\u2019s how they let the fourth fizzle at the end. \u201cContinue to move,\u201d is how Celtics guard Marcus Smart described his team\u2019s imperative. \u201cWe\u2019re great, but to play a team like this is going to take everybody. \u201cWhen we allow those guys to set their defense and just look at the ball and we\u2019re not moving, it\u2019s tough. That\u2019s tough to beat anybody. We just have to limit those isos as much as we can and just really get them moving. Just play and keep them on their heels.\u201d A case could be made that Tatum\u2019s miss from deep to end regulation informed his attack on the rim trailing 116-114. He had fouled Jimmy Butler on the Heat leader\u2019s driving shot for the lead, and Butler\u2019s free throw nudged it to two. That stoppage let Spoelstra again sub in Jones and Iguodala, giving him the defensive unit (with Adebayo, Butler and Jae Crowder) he wanted. At least that group was set before Boston called its timeout with 12 seconds left. The Celtics had Miami spread wide and Tatum, with the ball up top, saw a lane. That\u2019s when Adebayo left Smart, his man, to sprint under the rim. As he got there, Tatum was already in flight to the right of the rim, cranking his arm and the ball toward the hole \u2026 \u201cThat can be a poster dunk,\u201d Spoelstra said, \u201cand a lot of people won\u2019t be willing or aren\u2019t willing to make that play and put themselves out there. Jayson Tatum, get into the launching pad, and [Adebayo] just made a big-time save for us. I mean, Tatum did have an angle, and it looked like he had an open lane to the rim.\u201d Adebayo\u2019s arm bent back as Tatum jammed the ball down but not through. It squirted toward the floor and Adebayo grabbed it. \u201cIt\u2019s just, you get on that big stage, you just got to make big plays and I made a big play,\u201d Miami\u2019s 6-foot-9 center said. In this third season out of Kentucky, the 23-year-old Adebayo finished second to New Orleans\u2019 Brandon Ingram for the NBA\u2019s Most Improved Player Award after earning his first All-Star selection and nearly doubling his scoring average to 15.9 points per game. He was also rewarded with a spot on the league\u2019s All-Defensive second team, an honor he justified with what he said Tuesday night was the No. 1 play of his young NBA career. \u201cI came into the league as a defender and an energy guy,\u201d Adebayo said. \u201cJust having that moment [I] kind of flashed back to my rookie year where all I did was play defense and just provide energy.\u201d Said Tatum: \u201cI like both shots that I got. I just missed one. They made a great play at the rim on the second one.\u201d Tatum did get one more frenzied look, when Boston \u2013 out of timeouts \u2013 inbounded to him just beyond midcourt with 2.5 seconds left. He fell down with two Heat defenders contesting, but got up and, somehow without traveling, hoisted up a shot that could have knotted the score. It bounced off. But things never should have gotten to that point for Tatum or his team. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Do you feel that you truly belong? That might be a strange way for the plucky Nuggets to approach their first Western Conference finals appearance in 11 years; after all, Denver did just eliminate the No. 2 seed Clippers and showed much basketball courage and swagger by rallying from a pair of 3-1 deficits and winning a pair of Game 7s in these playoffs. They are nobody\u2019s surprise team; up until the All-Star break, they had the second-best record in the West. Still, how much do they have left in the tank after this thrilling yet exhausting ride in Orlando? Isn\u2019t the next step tricky? And that is LeBron James and Anthony Davis blocking the path, isn\u2019t it? LeBron, AD and the Lakers were the boss in the West all season and have not had to labor nearly as much as the Nuggets in this restart. Also, for what it\u2019s worth, the Lakers do bring 16 championships while the Nuggets have zero NBA titles. Basically, this is old hat for LeBron and the Lakers franchise; for Nikola Jokic and Jamal Murray and the Nuggets, this is a new and forbidding world they\u2019re about to enter. Here in what qualifies as a solid and gradual ascent among the elite teams in the NBA, Denver simply hasn\u2019t paid its championship dues yet, which is usually a requirement before any title hopeful can cash in. So maybe it\u2019s best they keep embracing the let\u2019s-have-fun approach and stay loose. They know all the urgency is on LeBron and the favored Lakers. They know they\u2019re playing with house money at this point. Why change mindsets now, even if they could? Besides, there\u2019s a reason the Lakers aren\u2019t expected to stumble. The cohesion between their two superstars is airtight. They\u2019ve lost only twice in eight games in the postseason and closed out two series in emphatic style. This conference championship, much like the just-concluded Nuggets-Clippers series, will be more of a referendum on the Lakers than anything. It\u2019s theirs to lose. 1.What are the biggest mismatches? The safe assumption is Jokic and Davis will cancel each other out; both are skilled big men who do their damage differently yet their impact is the same level \u2014 severe. The obvious problem for the Nuggets is LeBron and for the Lakers it\u2019s Murray. Neither team has a logical defensive answer for either. Denver will offer Paul Millsap and Jerami Grant and in some instances maybe Michael Porter Jr., but none are known for being shutdown defenders. Meanwhile, the Lakers will hope aging Rajon Rondo can negate some of Murray\u2019s quickness. Both are tall orders; LeBron is averaging nearly a triple-double in the playoffs and remains at peak form, while Murray has a pair of 50-pieces and is using this postseason to gradually grow into a superstar. 2. Will the Lakers have a 3-point problem? This was a very big concern early in the playoffs, yet the Lakers stabilized and therefore rolled through the first two rounds after first-game stumbles. That\u2019s fine \u2026 but it\u2019s still their main weakness and now they\u2019ll see a Nuggets\u2019 team that offers better defenders than the Blazers or Rockets. The Nuggets rotate well and bring reinforcements off the bench in case of foul trouble. If the Nuggets can play LeBron and AD straight-up on several possessions and keep the Lakers shooters such as Danny Green covered, that might create suspense in the series. It\u2019s really their best strategy. 3. Can Porter Jr. be the third wheel the Nuggets will need? The series will demand a bonus player from either team to surface and deliver in at least a few games. The logical candidate for the Lakers is Kyle Kuzma, but he\u2019s been mild overall and averaging just 11 points. There will be great interest, however, in Porter, whose best attribute is that he doesn\u2019t appeared awed by the situation despite being in his first true season. Porter brings size and shooting range to the mix and also the confidence to insert himself in fourth-quarter moments. The Nuggets are already drawing plays for Porter; is he able to develop enough faith in coach Mike Malone to be on the floor when it counts? That will determine his worth in this series. 28.3 \u2014 The Lakers outscored the Nuggets by 28.3 points per 100 possessions in a little more than 56 minutes with Anthony Davis at center (no JaVale McGee or Dwight Howard on the floor) in the regular season series. Those 56 minutes accounted for just 38% of the 150 minutes Davis played against Denver. In his other 94 minutes (when Davis played alongside McGee or Howard), the Lakers were outscored by 9.7 points per 100 possessions. The bigger difference was on defense, where the Lakers allowed just 97 points per 100 possessions with Davis playing center. In 33 minutes with Nikola Jokic on the floor against Davis at center, the Lakers were a plus-22 and the Nuggets scored just 60 points on 66 possessions (91 per 100). After playing just 41% of his minutes at the five against Portland in the first round, Davis played 84% of his minutes at the five against Houston in the conference semis. Through two rounds (and as was the case in the regular season), the Lakers have been better offensively with Davis at the four, but better defensively with him at the five . \u2014 John Schuhmann This is perhaps the best chance for LeBron, now 35, to win a title with the Lakers. He doesn\u2019t have to go through the Clippers or the Bucks. Next season, not only will those and the other current title contenders remain intact for the most part, but the Nets and Warriors will be retooled and ready to be thrown into the mix as well. Therefore, LeBron for those reasons should be the most motivated player on the floor, bringing a sense of urgency. That doesn\u2019t necessarily translate into victory and a happy ending, though. He\u2019ll need at least a few blockbuster performances from his tag-team partner, Davis. That\u2019s because the Nuggets are bringing good flow and the belief that anything\u2019s possible; their 6-0 record in elimination games is sufficient evidence of that. But the Nuggets\u2019 depth must show up for this to be a surprise series. Lakers in six. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

Nurse and the Raptors announced a multiyear extension Tuesday, without divulging the terms. In his two seasons with Toronto, Nurse won the 2019 NBA championship and led the Raptors to more wins than any team in the league over that span. Nurse was originally signed to a three-year deal in June 2018 to lead the club. \u201cOur confidence in Nick just continues to grow, and part of that comes from what we\u2019ve experienced together,\u201d Raptors President Masai Ujiri said. \u201cThe past two seasons have been unlike any other in our team\u2019s history \u2014 first, winning our championship, and then navigating a global pandemic and committing long term to the fight against racism and for social justice. \u201cNick has proved that he can coach on the court and lead in life.\u201d The Raptors went to the Eastern Conference semifinals this season, thriving in the NBA\u2019s restart bubble even after having to come to Florida two weeks early because of the challenges of bringing players back to Canada amid a quarantine.

McCollum releases first wine","content":" PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) \u2014 Always a wine connoisseur, CJ McCollum is now a wine maker, too. The Portland Trail Blazers guard has a signature wine coming out Tuesday, and apropos of Oregon, it\u2019s a pinot noir. McCollum Heritage 91 is the result of a partnership with Adelsheim Vineyard. \u201cWe\u2019re in a bit of a jam because it\u2019s a limited quantity, and demand is very high,\u201d McCollum said. McCollum readied for the launch while recuperating from Portland\u2019s 51-day odyssey in the NBA bubble in Florida. The Blazers overperformed in the seeding games, going 6-2 and making the playoffs as the No. 8 seed. It was Portland\u2019s seventh straight trip to the playoffs, but it ended in five games in the first round against the top-seeded Los Angeles Lakers. McCollum played the tournament with a fractured vertebra in his back. The 10th pick out of Lehigh in the 2013 draft, McCollum has averaged 18.5 points, 3.3 rebounds and 3.1 assists over his career in Portland. This strange season he averaged 22.2 points, 4.2 rebounds and 4.4 assists as half of Portland\u2019s dynamic backcourt with All-Star Damian Lillard. When Lillard celebrated a birthday in the bubble, McCollum contributed the wine. In fact, McCollum\u2019s room at Walt Disney World became something of a wine cellar with more than 80 bottles. \u201cI brought him a bottle and I brought myself like a case of McCollum Heritage 91 and I brought a bunch of other Oregon wines,\u201d McCollum said. \u201cHe only wanted to drink my stuff.\u201d McCollum is by no means alone in the NBA when it comes to wine. Stephen Curry\u2019s wife, Ayesha, and sister Sydel have a cabernet sauvignon and a sauvignon blanc under their label, Domaine Curry. Former player Dwyane Wade has Wade Cellars in Napa Valley, which produces, among other wines, a rose. Yao Ming\u2019s Yao Family Wines released its first bottles in 2011. Trail Blazer Carmelo Anthony has a YouTube show called \u201cWhat\u2019s In Your Glass\u201d where he discusses wine and more with fellow athletes and other celebrities. McCollum\u2019s wine was two years in the making. \u201cIt started with me sitting down and kind of figuring out what I wanted to get out of the process, from the educational standpoint, from a wine standpoint, from a taste preference standpoint. What is my ideal situation? We went over examples of ideas on how I could learn, how often I could be on the vineyard, how I could be involved in the process,\u201d he said. McCollum\u2019s preference was for wine from volcanic soil. He worked with Adelsheim wine maker Gina Hennen to find the right combination of grapes, from three different vineyards. His first bottle is from grapes harvested in 2018. But there\u2019s more to come. For McCollum, this is more than just a money-making venture (his wine retails for $50 a bottle). He really loves wine. Since arriving in Oregon, he has become a member at several local vineyards. \u201cRight before I left to go to the bubble, actually I went to Adelsheim and to check things out, to visit. And I was fortunate enough to taste the \u201919 version, but it\u2019s still young and not ready,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was fun to walk down and see the barrel\u2019s label, it had my initials on it and the year.\u201d"},{"id":25717,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/qa-goran-dragic","date":"2020-09-15","title":"Q&A: Heat guard Goran Dragic on his charmed basketball life","content":" ORLANDO \u2014 Goran Dragic knows he\u2019s lived a charmed basketball life.

He was once tabbed as the heir apparent and successor to two-time Kia MVP Steve Nash in Phoenix. He was voted the NBA\u2019s Most Improved Player in 2014, earning third-team All-NBA honors for his play that season. And in 2018 Dragic became an All-Star, realizing a dream he\u2019d worked towards for years. Dragic has experienced the emotional high of winning championships, MVP trophies and what he called the ultimate prize, leading the Slovenian National Team to the 2017 EuroBasket title and winning MVP honors alongside another homegrown prodigy, Luka Doncic, and the rest of his national team \u201cbrothers.\u201d And now he\u2019s embarking on yet another title chase with his Miami Heat \u201cbrothers\u201d as they prepare to engage with the Boston Celtics in the Eastern Conference finals here in the Orlando bubble.

When Rookie of the Year runner-up and starter Kendrick Nunn was knocked out of commission for the NBA restart with a positive COVID-19 test, Heat coach Erik Spoelstra turned to Dragic to step into the void and the Heat have been on a roll ever since. They\u2019ve lost just once in the playoffs, while Dragic has served up a reminder that he\u2019s still got plenty left in his tank at 34. \u201cI was never concerned about [my] role on this team,\u201d Dragic said. \u201cThat\u2019s not how we operate.

That\u2019s all.\u201d Dragic is averaging playoff career-highs in points (21.1 per game) while shooting a career-best 38.1 percent from beyond the 3-point line to go with 4.7 assists, 4.4 rebounds and 1.2 steals. \u201cWe really rely on our young players and that\u2019s a fact,\u201d Spoelstra said. \u201cBut when you go into a playoff situation you need veteran, playoff-experienced players. And that\u2019s who Goran is. He\u2019s battled tested. He\u2019s been through so many playoff pressure moments. To change his role on the fly and go back into the starting lineup, obviously that helped settle that group. And that\u2019s not an indictment on anybody else, that\u2019s just where we are right now.\u201d * * * NBA.com: Be honest, did you know at the beginning of this season that you guys were this sort of team, with all of these young guys and new faces? Dragic: If I\u2019m honest, no. I mean, at the beginning of a season you never know how things are going to turn out. You\u2019re always going in positive, believing in the work that\u2019s been done. But for me it was not easy. Coming from the injury and then had a meeting with Spo and he told me it was the best thing for me to come from the bench. But the best thing for me, when I look back, is that I just stay with it while these young guys and this team comes together. We had a lot of challenges to overcome and we did it as a team. And I think that\u2019s something awesome and now we finally can show what we are made of. You know, we are playing amazing basketball right now and hopefully we can continue to play like that. When you have an injury in this league, late in your career and move to the bench the way you did, do you worry at all that it closes the door on you being a starter again or that it somehow diminishes you as a player? Dragic: I don\u2019t think so. I wasn\u2019t worried about anything like that. Spo talked to me and said exactly what he needed me to do and that was it. I\u2019m going to play for my team first, always. So it\u2019s not just about me, it\u2019s about our team and what was needed. When your role changes in this league, when things change, it\u2019s easy for people to forget how good you are, that you were an All-Star a couple of years ago. Was it funny for you to hear people act like they just discovered your game again when the playoffs started, like you had vanished or something? Dragic: You know, I never even kind of think about that. I always had that in my mind, you are good as long as your last game. And I know that I can play basketball, I just need to get back healthy, and once I did that I would be fine. I accept my role coming from the bench and I think so, that helped me a lot in my career, especially with Spo putting me in the right position and my teammates as well. From there on, it\u2019s easy to play because I don\u2019t have no worries, I\u2019m just free. I\u2019m just playing out there and having fun. The way the veterans on this Heat team incorporated and mentored the young guys like Nunn and Tyler Herro seems like it happened seamlessly. What do you think was the key to finding that right balance as a group? Dragic: When you see the work everybody put in and the way we came together working out before the season, it was obvious we had a good group to be together. I had experience on my national team, playing with younger guys like Luka and other guys, so [I] understand the role a vet has to play. You do the job you do, whatever that is, but still make sure to come together as a team. That\u2019s the only way it works. No \u2026 what\u2019s the word? No [jealousy], just hard work together. When you talk about your career and the success you\u2019ve had at every stop, the championships back home and in international competition, how much do you lean on those experiences now that the Heat is in a position to potentially play for a championship? Dragic: That was huge for my career, especially playing for my national team for 12 years. And every time they put us as one of the favorites, we have a good team but we [were] not there. And it\u2019s always tough. When we achieved that goal [in 2017] it felt like 100 pounds came off my shoulders. It was something unbelievable for my country, for me, my teammates. And yeah, Luka definitely, he came to the team and we had great chemistry and it\u2019s just something amazing that we achieved.  Speaking of chemistry, when did you really notice that this Heat team had that kind of chemistry? When did you know this is what it was going to be, even with Jimmy [Butler] coming in and all the new pieces? Dragic: Yeah, I think so \u2026 after training camp. We already been in the gym before training camp, so we really connected in training camp, when the whole group was basically 24-7 together and you could see everybody likes to hang out and we went together to dinners. You just see that we had that spark and I think that\u2019s [what] helps us a lot to kind of grow as a team. When you have that chemistry and it\u2019s interrupted by the pandemic and the shutdown and then you have to come down here to the bubble and see if you can get it all back, is there even anything you can compare it to? Dragic: I compare it a little bit to EuroBasket, you know, when you go with the national team and we all eat together and we [are] all in the same hotel. Of course, you have more freedom, you can go out. And I mean, I understand with this pandemic going on, it has to be the way it is here and be careful. But yeah, if you\u2019re mentally strong and you have good teammates that you can hang out [with] every single day, that really helps out because you\u2019re not thinking about the other stuff, You\u2019re just thinking about the main thing, and that\u2019s basketball. I know when you\u2019ve been in the league as long as you have and you\u2019ve had success, All-Star games and everything, you start to realize that those things can be there one day and gone the next. Do you think about that now as a veteran leader when you\u2019re trying to explain to your guys that you have to seize this moment in the conference finals? Dragic: Every day, every day. You know I\u2019ve been blessed to play this sport and to be so many years in the best league in the world in the NBA, this is my second conference finals. The first one, I didn\u2019t really play that much \u2026 maybe 15 minutes a game or something, but this is something that you have to take advantage, you have to enjoy it. You have to give everything you\u2019ve got because, you know maybe this is the last one. You just never know, is this an opportunity you cannot pass up. You have to do everything in [your] power or possession to do good. That first conference finals was with Phoenix in 2010 and here you are in 2020 finally making it back. Did young Goran Dragic have any idea at that time how long it would take to see this again? Dragic: Kobe. Kobe \u2026 man. Kobe, he was a monster. What he did in that conference finals against us was something unbelievable. I know Grant Hill was playing unbelievable defense in that series, just unbelievable defense, but it was just better offense. I never forget how Kobe played in that series. That\u2019s something that I knew I was always going to have in my mind. Basically, he beat us by himself. It was something special. He was so special. I imagine you feel like Kobe Bryant seized that moment the way you\u2019re talking about you and your guys have to now? Dragic: It does, it really does. I mentioned this to our young guys, to all of them \u2014 Kendrick, Bam [Adebayo], Tyler and Duncan [Robinson] \u2014 and I said, don\u2019t take this for granted because this is not normal. Don\u2019t think that this is normal. It\u2019s not normal, that you \u2026 look, I was in the conference finals in 2010 and now we here in 2020. It\u2019s been past 10 years, and so I just tell them, you know, enjoy every moment, enjoy this and try to do your best. And I\u2019m hoping that those young fellas still going to have many, many more of these experiences. But you never know. This beautiful game is crazy like that. You just never know. * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

They last about three minutes and then you come running out and you\u2019re fired up. And then three minutes later you\u2019ve got to focus on playing basketball.

That\u2019s what we\u2019ll do the next two days, we\u2019ll get them doing what we\u2019ve done to get the leads and we\u2019ll continue to do it. But there\u2019s nothing secret or magical. It\u2019s about playing basketball. Manning up, moving the ball and doing all of the things we can do. Other than that, that\u2019s about it.\u201d Rivers has experienced the highs and lows of Game 7s in his coaching career, so he understands that each team, each scenario and the dynamics that come with it are unique to a specific series. So it\u2019s hard to draw parallels to use when analyzing the predicament his team finds itself in; the Clippers led this series 3-1 before losing double-digit leads and buckling down the stretch to lose Games 5 and 6. For a team with plenty of players with playoff seasoning, Rivers said he won\u2019t lean on that experience since this core group is playing in its first postseason together. They do have the reigning Finals MVP in Kawhi Leonard, but Rivers pounced out that his superstar is in the same predicament everyone is right now. \u201cKawhi has no experience with this team,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cHe\u2019s unshakable. And like with Kawhi, you can\u2019t guarantee that he\u2019s going to play well or not because he\u2019s human, and all players are. But you know the moment won\u2019t be too big. That\u2019s the one thing with him, you just know that. So that\u2019s comforting to know that.\u201d * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

The Clippers are now 0-7 all-time with a chance to clinch a berth in the conference finals on the line, the latest stumble coming Sunday in a 111-96 Game 6 loss to the Denver Nuggets. It\u2019s the second straight game that the Clippers have lost in this series after leading by double-digits in the third quarter. They surrendered a 15-point lead in their Game 5 loss and were ahead by 19 points in the fourth quarter Sunday before the Nuggets rallied, outscoring the Clippers 64-35 in the second half, to force a Game 7 Tuesday night. > Game 7: Nuggets vs. Clippers (9 ET on ESPN) A season-long trend of surrendering big leads hasn\u2019t gone away for the Clippers during these playoffs. Seven times this season they lost games when leading by 15 or more points, and that includes a first-round loss to Dallas when they led by 21. Despite their second-half crumbling in each of the past two games of this series, Paul George is adamant that the Clippers are still in control of their own destiny in this series and ultimately this season. \u201cWe know what we are up against,\u201d George said after his 33-point effort Sunday. \u201cWe have the utmost respect for them as opponents, but I like our chances. I like our odds. I like what we have. Again, it\u2019s on us to finish this out.\u201d The berth in the conference finals doesn\u2019t just come with historical significance for the Clippers. It\u2019s also an opportunity to square off against their Staples Center rival Los Angeles Lakers, who locked their spot down Saturday by trouncing the Houston Rockets in Game 5 of their conference semifinal series . With their once-commanding 3-1 lead over the Nuggets vanishing, the Clippers will now face the scrutiny and questions that come with a potential collapse on the big stage. \u201cThis group\u2019s staying together,\u201d George said. \u201cWe\u2019re still in the driver\u2019s seat. It\u2019s not a panic mode. We have a Game 7.\u201d When asked if they choked Game 6 away, two-time Finals MVP Kawhi Leonard didn\u2019t want to frame it that way. \u201cWe just went cold. We went cold in that third quarter, that\u2019s it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe kept getting into the paint, passing the ball and got a little stagnant and just couldn\u2019t make shots.\u201d He knows better than anyone what kind of pressure comes with a Game 7, having hit a shot at the buzzer last season to beat the Philadelphia 76ers in the conference semifinals. The Nuggets are the first team in playoff history to play in four straight Game 7s, adding even more intrigue to Tuesday night\u2019s winner-take-all showdown. His message to his teammates for Game 7 is simple. \u201cIt\u2019s pressure every game,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cWe\u2019ve just got to leave it all out there on the floor. Make sure we are paying attention to detail, executing and communicating on the defensive end. That\u2019s all we can do, go out there and play hard and make sure we know the game plan.\u201d * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

Facing elimination time after time, five times in this postseason alone, including Sunday against the Los Angeles Clippers in Game 6 of the Western Conference semifinals, Jokic and the Nuggets once again found a way to do the seemingly unthinkable. By the time they\u2019d finished their miraculous comeback from a 19-point third quarter deficit to pull off a shocking 111-98 win , Jokic was searching for the right words to describe what it is that allows the Nuggets to keep defying the odds. > Game 7: Nuggets vs. Clippers, Tuesday at 9 ET on ESPN \u201cMaybe this is going to sound weird or funny, but we don\u2019t care. We\u2019re just going to go there and have fun,\u201d Jokic said after leading the comeback and shredding the vaunted Clippers\u2019 defense for 34 points (on 13-for-22 shooing, 4-for-6 from beyond the 3-point line), 14 rebounds and 6 assists. \u201cCoach said in the meeting before \u2018don\u2019t forget to have fun\u2019 and in the third and fourth quarters we were having fun. You could see everybody was laughing feeling good because we were playing good, we were playing amazing, so when we play like that the confidence is very high.\u201d Tuesday\u2019s Game 7 looms historically large for both teams. The Clippers were supposed to be marching towards a date in the conference finals (for the first time in the 50-year history of the organization) against their Staples Center rival Los Angeles Lakers. Instead, they\u2019ll now have to survive a Nuggets team that is the first in NBA history to play in four straight Game 7s, dating back to last season. The Nuggets have forced a Game 7 twice after being down 3-1 in the same postseason for the first time in playoff history. They\u2019ve also tied three other teams by staving off elimination five times in this postseason. The only team to do it more was the 1994 Nuggets, of course, who did it six times. Jokic pointed to the three previous Game 7s and the roller coaster rides in each of those series, for educating the Nuggets to stay in the moment no matter the circumstance. \u201cWe\u2019ve kind of seen everything,\u201d he said. \u201cThe main thing is that we have fun, we\u2019re having fun. The pressure, there is no pressure on any of us.\u201d With Jokic knocking down one-legged, step-back 3-pointers and Jamal Murray, Gary Harris and Michael Porter Jr. all taking and making clutch shots during the comeback, Nuggets coach Mike Malone was searching for the right words to describe his team\u2019s unwavering resilience. He lauded his team\u2019s defensive effort, which produced 11 straight stops during that second-half run. Seeing the normally stone-faced Jokic fired up and emotional was the surest sign that something special was brewing. \u201cI love, and my favorite part about Nikola Jokic,\u201d Malone said, \u201che doesn\u2019t get very excited too often. But when we went on that run and we\u2019re getting stops and they were calling timeout, and we got more stops and they called another timeout. And we\u2019re making the right play and the ball was flying. And I see Nikola emotional and yelling and screaming and pounding his chest, I know we\u2019re in a good place. And I saw that tonight. And that\u2019s always fun to see. We\u2019re embracing this, we\u2019re enjoying the journey. This is a great moment for us but we have a lot of work to do.\u201d The Nuggets\u2019 work in this series has made them the bubble darlings of the remaining five teams \u2014 the Lakers await the winner in the Western Conference finals while the Boston Celtics and Miami Heat are set to battle it out in the East. The Nuggets are probably still considered the longest of long shots in this field. Malone doesn\u2019t care, of course, as long as his guys are convinced they can do it. \u201cI think what it comes down to is an inner belief, an inner confidence,\u201d Malone said. \u201c We started off training camp back in September in Colorado Springs talking about winning a championship. And we still have those same goals. We never lost sight of that. Four months on the hiatus, coming back into the bubble truing to get healthy \u2026 we\u2019ve always felt we were good enough. No one else does, but we don\u2019t care about that. We don\u2019t listen to the noise. We\u2019ve always had this internal belief in ourselves and in our collective group that we\u2019re good enough to win a championship. \u201cWe find it funny that the narrative is that the Nuggets are this cute team, \u2018oh what a good story.\u2019 We were second in the West last year. We were one possession away from going to the Western Conference finals. Most of this year we were the No. 2 seed in the West, until after the All-Star break we lost hold of that. So I think it comes down to just a tremendous belief and confidence in who we are, what we\u2019re about and what we\u2019re trying to accomplish. And we have work to do. We\u2019re not satisfied yet.\u201d  Three times in this bubble run the Nuggets put Malone\u2019s words into action. They have found themselves down by 15 or more and each time they rallied for wins. They were down 15 to the Utah Jazz in Game 5 of their first-round series and went on a 64-36 run to turn that one around. They were down 15 in the second half of Game 5 against the Clippers Friday and used a 65-44 blitz to flip that one. Sunday\u2019s 62-30 run after trailing by 19 came after Murray was knocked to the floor on an early fourth-quarter drive by Clippers star Paul George. Malone went off when there was no foul called. But Jokic said he wasn\u2019t worried about Murray, who stayed on the ground for minutes before getting up and walking to the bench with the Clippers up 68-49 with 10:08 to play in the game. We find it funny that the narrative is that the Nuggets are this cute team, \u2018oh what a good story.\u2019 We were second in the West last year. We were one possession away from going to the Western Conference finals. Mike Malone Jokic said he never had a doubt that Murray would return and close out the game. \u201cNo, I mean, even if he had a broken rib or whatever, he would continue for sure,\u201d Jokic said. \u201cWhatever would happen, he\u2019s not just going to leave the team just like that. Something serious needs to be wrong if he doesn\u2019t finish the game. Like really serious.\u201d Jokic has been just as indispensable for the Nuggets. He\u2019s dominated the Clippers in this series, averaging 25.8 points (shooting 53 percent from the field, 44.1 percent from beyond the 3-point line), 12 rebounds and 5.5 assists. His 13 career playoff games with at least 20 points, 10 rebounds and 5 assists ranks as the most by any player in his first two seasons, one better than Hall of Famer Oscar Robertson, the only other player to record double-digit games up to that standard. He was the best player on the floor with Game 6 up for grabs, and that\u2019s with reigning Finals MVP Kawhi Leonard and George on the other side. \u201cI think he was, too,\u201d Murray said when told that Malone suggested Jokic was the best player in the world during that wild comeback. \u201cI don\u2019t see why not. He\u2019s hitting the one-leg step backs, fading away on one leg with a hand in his face, consecutive times, I\u2019d say he\u2019s the best player in the world. And he\u2019s unselfish. He\u2019s passing the ball, he\u2019s finding guys in crunch time and guys are stepping up and making shots. He\u2019s making plays. It was a team effort, but Joker definitely carried us throughout the game and when he\u2019s playing like that, we\u2019re going to be a scary ream for years to come.\u201d They only have to worry about being that team for one more night to reach the conference finals. * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

(AP) \u2014 Mike D\u2019Antoni has told the Houston Rockets that he will not be back as coach with them next season, essentially choosing free agency over a return to the club with whom he has spent the last four seasons. D\u2019Antoni told the Rockets on Sunday \u2014 not even a full day after the team\u2019s season ended with a playoff loss to the Los Angeles Lakers \u2014 that he would seek coaching options elsewhere for next season and not return to Houston. Team owner Tilman Fertitta confirmed the move later Sunday. \u201cI would like to thank Mike D\u2019Antoni and his wife, Laurel, for their incredible contributions to the Houston Rockets organization and the Houston community,\u201d Fertitta said. \u201cMike is a true professional and an amazing basketball mind. He is a winner, and we have been blessed to have such an outstanding coach and leader to work with the past four seasons.\u201d ESPN first reported the 69-year-old coach\u2019s decision. It was not totally unexpected; the Rockets and D\u2019Antoni couldn\u2019t agree on an extension last year, meaning he was coaching this season with no guarantee of his future in Houston. D\u2019Antoni had already been mentioned as a potential candidate for vacancies in Indiana and Philadelphia, but when the season ended Saturday night there appeared to be at least some hope of his remaining in Houston. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a great organization, great city, great fans, team\u2019s great,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said after the Game 5 loss to the Lakers. \u201cI mean, everything\u2019s good here. We\u2019ll see what happens, but I couldn\u2019t ask for a better situation. I had four years and hopefully it keeps going. You just never know.\u201d But sometime between late Saturday night and early Sunday afternoon, he knew that it was time to move on. Houston becomes the eighth team that will be going through a coaching change since the end of the regular season \u2014 March 11 for eight clubs that didn\u2019t qualify for the NBA\u2019s restart bubble, and mid-August for the league\u2019s 22 other franchises. In recent weeks, Brooklyn has hired Steve Nash and New York hired Tom Thibodeau. Chicago, Indiana, New Orleans, Oklahoma City, Philadelphia and now Houston are vacant. D\u2019Antoni was with the Rockets for four seasons. Houston went 217-101 in his regular-season contests, a .682 winning percentage. The Rockets\u2019 winning percentage this season \u2014 .611 \u2014 was the worst of his four-year tenure. He went 28-23 in the playoffs with Houston and was the NBA\u2019s coach of the year in 2016-17, his first season with the Rockets. \u201cMike has done some unbelievable things here,\u201d Rockets star James Harden said Saturday night, making clear that he would have liked to have seen D\u2019Antoni come back. Houston\u2019s other star, guard Russell Westbrook, also raved about the type of person D\u2019Antoni is and said he enjoyed his lone season playing under him. D\u2019Antoni has coached 1,199 regular-season games with five different franchises, going 672-527. He\u2019s a two-time coach of the year, having also won the award in 2004-05 after guiding Phoenix to a 62-20 record."},{"id":25694,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/rockets-lakers-rondo-westbrook-trash-talk","date":"2020-09-13","title":"Russell Westbrook's debut season with Rockets crash-lands with Game 5 ouster","content":" ORLANDO, Fla. \u2014 Russell Westbrook\u2019s first season with the Houston Rockets ended in ugly fashion Saturday night with a 119-96 blowout loss to the Los Angeles Lakers in Game 5 of the Western Conference semifinals . But that was only part of a wild night for Westbrook. With 7:42 to play in the fourth quarter, a heated exchange between Westbrook and a member of the Lakers\u2019 family section at AdventHealth Arena led to William Rondo, older brother of Lakers\u2019 point guard Rajon Rondo, being escorted from the building. The game wasn\u2019t in doubt when William Rondo said something that Westbrook heard and then responded to. LeBron James was at the free-throw line with the Lakers up 23 points. And then things went sideways. After the game Westbrook explained what happened from his perspective. \u201cI don\u2019t know man. You know, people at the game, you\u2019re supposed to shut your mouth and watch the game,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the rules, especially when you have families and people here. Apparently, I guess because [Rajon] Rondo was talking [trash], he decided he wanted to hop in, too. \u201cBut, it\u2019s OK. It\u2019s all good. I get it. He wanted to take up for his brother. But that\u2019s it. Those rules stand for everybody though, no matter who it is, family, whatever. When you cross that line, then he\u2019s supposed to be at home. There\u2019s no rules or regulations for that. But he started talking crazy, and I don\u2019t play that game.\u201d Westbrook\u2019s season ended with a rough 4-for-13 shooting effort. He finished with 10 points, 6 assists, 4 rebounds, 2 steals and 3 turnovers on a night when James Harden outscored Westbrook and the other Rockets starters 30-28. Westbrook said he just never fully regained his rhythm after the March shutdown due to the coronavirus pandemic. A positive COVID-19 diagnosis and a quad injury suffered two games into his bubble experience foiled any hopes he had of him getting back on track. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t 100 percent,\u201d Westbrook said, \u201cBut I\u2019m not the guy to make excuses. I like to compete. But it is what it is. \u2026 It\u2019s unfortunate for me, because it\u2019s very frustrating, honestly man, coming to Houston and then catching Covid, and then sit back 20 days, 20-21 days without working out when I was probably in the best shape I\u2019ve been in in a long time. Then I come down here trying to get acclimated and play two games and then boom, I get hurt again. \u201cSo it\u2019s just very frustrating for me knowing that the postseason is where you\u2019re supposed to elevate your game. And for me, I was just trying to catch a rhythm and there was no time for that.\u201d Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

If you allow that to happen throughout the course of your 48-minute game, they will extend the series.\u201d Saturday in Orlando, the Rockets didn\u2019t. The Lakers eliminated the Rockets 4-1 in dominating fashion, capping their effort with a 119-96 victory in Game 5 of the Western Conference Semifinals . The series-closing wire-to-wire victories helped them advance to the Western Conference Finals for the first time since 2010. James now owns a career record of 37-10 in close-out games, having averaged 28.3 points in those outings while shooting 47.8% from the field. \u201cI know what my name, my stature and what I\u2019ve done in this league comes with \u2014 whenever I decide to join a franchise, either for starting off my first seven years with Cleveland, my four years in Miami, going back to Cleveland four more years, and then coming into this franchise,\u201d James said. \u201cI know what my name comes with, and it comes with winning. \u201cI take that responsibility to the utmost because I am a winner and I\u2019ve always been a winner from the first time I ever played organized basketball. It\u2019s never about you. So, I understand the Laker faithful, and what they\u2019ve felt and what they\u2019ve been going through the last decade of not being in the postseason, not competing for championships. I took that responsibility as well. So, I\u2019m happy I\u2019m able to [play] a little bit of a part of it, and the rest of my ballclub, the coaching staff and everybody that has put [in] the sacrifice to get this franchise back to competing for a championship, which we\u2019ve done all year.\u201d James racked up 29 points to go with 11 rebounds and 7 assists in Game 5, as he and Anthony Davis (13 points, 11 rebounds) became the first pair of teammates to each average at least 25 points and 10 rebounds in a playoff series since the 1961 NBA Finals, when Bob Pettit and Cliff Hagan accomplished the feat for the St. Louis Hawks. \u201cThe fact that they\u2019re so cohesive on and off the court really impacts our group\u2019s togetherness and our chemistry,\u201d Lakers coach Frank Vogel said of James and Davis. \u201cIt filters down to the rest of the guys. Both of them have dominant abilities on both sides of the floor, and they\u2019re both willing passers. So, they fit what we\u2019re trying to build here in terms of being a team-first team offensively, and one that\u2019s athletic and gifted, talented and committed on the defensive end. All of those things are leading us to success thus far, and I\u2019m looking forward to seeing how far we can take it.\u201d Here are three observations from Game 5: Los Angeles utilized the same starting lineup it took the floor with for its Game 4 win in this one, electing to roll with James, Davis, Danny Green, Markieff Morris and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope. This lineup spent 14 minutes on the floor together in Game 5, producing an offensive rating of 161.5 and a defensive rating of 73.1 to go with a true shooting percentage of 86.8. The same group spent a total of 9 minutes on the floor together in Game 4, and finished with a an offensive rating of 100.0, a defensive rating of 70.6, a true shooting percentage of 50.4 and a rebounding percentage of 60.0. Perhaps that\u2019s why Houston coach Mike D\u2019Antoni isn\u2019t yet ready to give up small ball, even after Saturday\u2019s disastrous results for his team. \u201cAsk the Lakers, that\u2019s what they beat us with,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said. \u201cThey were small. Golden State did a pretty good job with theirs. I definitely think you can win [with small ball].\u201d The Lakers played the Rockets with smaller lineups for the majority of the conference semifinals, but Vogel has said on numerous occasions that he hasn\u2019t eliminated big men JaVale McGee and Dwight Howard from the team\u2019s plans moving forward, as Los Angeles faces the winner of the Denver-L.A. Clippers series. On the brink of eliminating the Rockets, it\u2019s clear the Lakers saw some vulnerability and pounced. Los Angeles stormed out to a 22-point lead and would lead this game by as many as 30. James led the charge with 11 points on 4-for-6 shooting and Caldwell-Pope chipped in 8 points, knocking down both his attempts from 3-point range in the first quarter. Los Angeles racked up 13 points on fast breaks in the opening quarter, compared to none for the Rockets and connected on 13-of-18 from the floor and 7-of-12 from deep. Maybe James Harden\u2019s recent experiences in elimination games tempted the Lakers to throw the first punch. Coming into Game 5, Harden owned a record of 1-5 in his last elimination six games, averaging 23.8 points, 38% shooting from the field, and 25% from 3-point range while averaging 6.7 turnovers. Despite the early Lakers onslaught, Harden settled in nicely with a 12-point second quarter. Headed into intermission, Harden was tied with James for a game-high 19 points on 7-for-11 shooting. Houston at one point cut Los Angeles\u2019 early lead to 7 points, before finishing the first half trailing 62-51. The Rockets capitalized off 13 Los Angeles turnovers for 15 points to stay within striking distance. A 17-2 run from the 1:56 mark of the first quarter to the 10:04 point of the second quarter definitely helped, too. But by the end of the third quarter, the game was pretty much over as the Lakers \u2014 having shot 15-for-27 on 3-point attempts in the first three quarters \u2014 held a 26-point lead. Houston shot 29.4% from 3-point range over the first three quarters. \u201cIt\u2019s very, very frustrating,\u201d Harden said. \u201cEspecially with the amount of work that individually I\u2019ve put in. But I\u2019m gonna keep chipping away, keep going and keep going until I can\u2019t go anymore.\u201d You\u2019ve got to wonder where the Rockets go from here, and it\u2019s worth questioning whether management decides to pull the plug on the team\u2019s small-ball style. General manager Daryl Morey and D\u2019Antoni showed some conviction in the system by leaning all the way into it with their trade deadline exchange of Clint Capela for Robert Covington. But if the plan moving forward is to continue playing that way, the front office will need to find a way to put more talent around Harden that fits, which could prove difficult given Houston\u2019s situation. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re a piece away,\u201d Harden said. \u201cWe\u2019ve just got to keep trying to figure it out, keep trying to grow and put the right pieces around me and Russ [Westbrook] to get to where we want to go. We\u2019ve got to look at our entire team and see what direction we want to go. Obviously, [for] half of the season, we tried the small ball. It worked for the most part. So, we\u2019ve just got to take an overall look at our team and see what holes we need to fill and go from there.\u201d Let\u2019s not forget that D\u2019Antoni\u2019s contract expired after Game 5, and his return for next season appears to be uncertain. The loss in Game 5 marked the first time the Rockets were eliminated in fewer than six games under D\u2019Antoni. The Rockets are now 2-11 all-time when trailing a series 3-1. \u201cI\u2019ve got to let this one sink in a little bit,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a great organization, great city, great fans. The team\u2019s great. Everything\u2019s good here. So, we\u2019ll see what happens. But I couldn\u2019t ask for a better situation. I had four years, and hopefully it keeps going. But you just never know. Everything is good on this side, for sure. I want to continue coaching, sure.\u201d The Rockets already have big money tied up in Harden, Westbrook and Eric Gordon for next season, and they don\u2019t control a 2020 draft pick. Considering Westbrook\u2019s issues shooting the 3-ball, he doesn\u2019t appear to be an ideal superstar fit alongside Harden. So, does Houston tweak the system toward a more traditional style, or does it find pieces that cater the current setup? After the Game 5 loss, nobody with the Rockets sounded like they were ready to give up on small ball, despite the fact they\u2019ve been outrebounded now in 35 of their last 38 games. \u201cIt\u2019s way too early to assess that,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said. \u201cOne, that\u2019s Daryl\u2019s job. He\u2019ll do a great job of trying and finding and putting a roster together that can compete. We competed. We were in the top four in the West. But we just couldn\u2019t get over the hump. This is a very good team, and they played great tonight. It\u2019s way too early.\u201d Westbrook didn\u2019t hesitate when asked whether small ball was a sustainable system for winning. \u201cYeah, man, I think when you have the right group of guys that can do it, it\u2019s definitely sustainable,\u201d said Westbrook, who finished with 10 points on 4-for-13 shooting. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely something that you can build off of, and something that can put teams in a bind.\u201d Michael C.

(AP) \u2014 A small number of protesters carrying signs and shouting into megaphones briefly blocked at least two buses chartered by the NBA from entering the Walt Disney World campus on Saturday night, with the group saying it wanted LeBron James, Russell Westbrook and other top players to take notice. The group blocked charter buses carrying members of the news media and some NBA staff, but no players or team personnel. Among their chants: \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d and \u201cLeBron can you help us?\u201d Some also carried signs with messages such as \u201cRussell Stand With Us.\u201d The protesters assembled near one of the entrances and were not inside the so-called bubble, where teams, NBA staff and other have been for more than two months in some cases for the resumption of the season. They appeared to have gathered on a road that is open to the public, then stopped buses on an access road near a primary entrance to the resort. It was not known if they were able to be seen by any buses carrying players. At least one of the buses carrying players from the Los Angeles Lakers-Houston Rockets game Saturday night had left the ESPN Wide World of Sports complex before the first protest was noticed. Calling attention to racial inequality and police brutality has been a top priority of the NBA restart, for both players and the league itself. Playoff games stopped for three days last month in response to player protests over the shooting of a Black man by police in Wisconsin, and dozens of players have spoken out with calls for justice in the case of Breonna Taylor \u2014 a 26-year-old Black woman who was fatally shot when police officers burst into her Louisville, Kentucky, apartment using a no-knock warrant during a narcotics investigation on March 13. The group outside the Disney complex on Saturday \u2014 through messaging on some of the shirts they wore and signs they carried \u2014 made clear that they were trying to draw attention to the case of Salaythis Melvin, a Black man who was fatally shot in the back by an Orange County sheriff\u2019s deputy last month. Sheriff\u2019s officials have said Melvin was armed; attorneys for his family have said he posed no threat to the deputy involved. The mall where Melvin was shot is about 15 miles from the site of the NBA restart."},{"id":25727,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/celtics-raptors-game-7-analysis","date":"2020-09-12","title":"Celtics get the final stop in epic, defensive series","content":" There are some games where the offense is so good, it\u2019s a last-team-with-the-ball-wins situation. Game 7 of the Eastern Conference semifinals series between the Toronto Raptors and Boston Celtics was definitely not one of those games. The offense was not good, because the defense was incredible. \u201cRight when something worked,\u201d Celtics coach Brad Stevens said about this series, \u201cthe next play it didn\u2019t work anymore.\u201d The Boston defense, highlighted by an incredible block by Marcus Smart in the final minute, was just a little bit better on Friday. With a 92-87 victory , the Celtics survived and advanced to an Eastern Conference finals matchup with the Miami Heat. The Raptors had the most efficient offense in the first round , scoring 122.9 points per 100 possessions in a sweep of the Brooklyn Nets. In this round, the Raptors ranked last offensively , scoring just 100.3. The Celtics didn\u2019t have a field goal for the final 5:22 of Game 7, a circumstance that would seemingly lead to defeat in a game that didn\u2019t include any garbage time. But that final field goal \u2014 a Jayson Tatum drive past Pascal Siakam \u2014 put the Celtics up nine. And that was just enough of a lead to get them to the conference finals for the third time in the last four years. The Raptors did have two chances to tie this game, though. With the Celtics up two and just over a minute to go, Tatum missed on a drive, and suddenly Norman Powell was out on the break with only Smart in front of him. It was the exact same situation as the most important sequence in the second overtime of Game 6, a little more than 48 hours earlier. That time, Smart stayed in front of Powell, who powered through for a 3-point play that put the Raptors up four. \u201cAs soon as Norman caught the ball,\u201d Smart said afterward, \u201cinstantly I remembered last game where that exact same play, he came at me full court and got the and-one.\u201d As he crossed the midcourt line, Powell put the ball in his left hand so he could take the same angle to the basket, putting Smart on his heels. \u201cHe made a good move, right-to-left crossover that made me shift my hips,\u201d Smart said. With the defender on his side, Powell was going to get better lift off the floor than he did in Game 6. But so was Smart, who later replayed what was going through his mind. \u201cI was just telling myself, \u2018He has to dunk it. I\u2019m not gonna get no foul. I\u2019m gonna just meet him up top and see who wins that battle.'\u201d Powell leapt off one foot, but didn\u2019t go for a dunk. Smart leapt off two and pinned the layup off the backboard. It rebounded to Jaylen Brown and the Celtics still had a two-point lead. \u201cI bet on myself 110% of the time,\u201d Smart said, \u201cI\u2019m first-team All-Defense for a reason, and I believe in that wholeheartedly.\u201d Tatum made a similarly huge hustle play on the other end of the floor, crashing the glass on the second of Grant Williams\u2019 two missed free throws to grab an offensive rebound over Powell, who fouled Tatum on the way down. But when he missed one of his two freebies with 35 seconds left, the Raptors had another chance to tie. Toronto ran a \u201cHammer\u201d play that got them a wide-open corner 3 from Fred VanVleet in Game 6. With Kyle Lowry fouled out, VanVleet was the passer this time. Pascal Siakam flashed to the left elbow and handed the ball back to VanVleet, whose job was to get to the baseline for a pass to Powell in the left corner. But Smart (guarding VanVleet) called for a switch from Brown, who slid into VanVleet\u2019s path, blowing up the play, which the Celtics had covered on the weak side anyway. Tatum switched off of OG Anunoby, picked up Powell, and then fought through Serge Ibaka\u2019s back-screen with somebody (Stevens presumably) yelling \u201cHammer! Hammer!\u201d. Another Ibaka screen got Williams switched onto VanVleet late in the clock, but the rookie stayed solid and forced a high-arcing step-back 3 that didn\u2019t have much of a chance. Appropriately, this series was decided in the final 30 seconds. And appropriately, it was decided with a defensive stop. Given how many rotation guys the Celtics lost last summer, it might be a surprise that they\u2019re here. And given that how important Al Horford and Aron Baynes were to a defense that ranked sixth last season, it\u2019s definitely a surprise that they\u2019re here because of their play on that end of the floor. The offensive development of Tatum and Brown has been the big story in Boston this season, and their offense (50 combined points, seven assists from Tatum) was critical on Friday. But their improvement defensively has been just as noteworthy. Daniel Theis stepped into a bigger role and anchored the Celtics inside, and Kemba Walker has been a solid defender for his size. Most importantly, if the Raptors were the most cohesive defensive group in the league, the Celtics weren\u2019t far behind. Toronto was so consistently good defensively that the champs were 51-3 when they scored at least 105 points per 100 possessions, five fewer than the league average of 110 per 100. If they were just decent offensively, the Raptors won. But the Celtics didn\u2019t let them get anywhere near that 105-per-100 mark in Games 1, 5 and 7 of this series , three of Toronto\u2019s nine least efficient games of the season (83 games total). \u201cLosing [Horford and Baynes] was definitely a big hit to our defense,\u201d Smart said. \u201cBut it just allowed other people like Jayson and Jaylen and Theis and Rob Williams to step in and really pick up the slack on that end. That\u2019s tremendous for us, because not only do you have Jayson and Jaylen playing offensively, but you got them playing defensively and becoming two-way players.\u201d Two-way players who are only 22 and 23 years old. The Celtics have ranked in the top seven defensively in 10 of the last 13 seasons, and there\u2019s no stopping that run given how good these guys are now. It may seem like Smart\u2019s been around forever, but he\u2019s only 26. It\u2019s a young group. But at 23, Brown is now going to the conference finals for a third time. At 22, Tatum is making his second trip. \u201cThey are young by every metric except playoff experience,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cThey have a lot of it.\u201d And there\u2019s more to come. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

So, too, is the conference\u2019s No. 1 seed. What might have seemed like the undercard when the East side of the playoffs bracket began now is the main event. If the Miami Heat advance, it will be their first trip to the Finals since 2014. If it\u2019s the Boston Celtics, they\u2019ll be repping the Eastern Conference for the first time since 2010. There are enough contrasts here to fill several storylines across what figures to be a long series. Boston has an elite level of talent in the backcourt and on the wing, while Miami owes its spot here to tenacity and resourcefulness. The Heat have a deeper and more versatile bench, though the Celtics have done fine using a shorter rotation with heavier minutes loads. Watching Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown and Kemba Walker get into the open court can be thrilling, but grinders such as Jimmy Butler, Bam Adebayo and Jae Crowder are happy to play the role of speed bumps. And so on. Look for added interest with the Raptors, the Bucks and their Coach-of-the-Year winning bosses \u2013 Nick Nurse and Mike Budenholzer \u2013 gone. Boston\u2019s Brad Stevens has been a genius-in-waiting for a few years now, even as Miami\u2019s Erik Spoelstra has quietly moved into Top 5 or Top 3 status in the league. When the days in between games are as important as the games themselves, providing for tweaks and takeaways as a series plays out, the work of both coaches and their staffs will be on full display. 1. Is Jimmy Butler good enough? As in, \u201cCan you win an NBA championship if Jimmy Butler is your best player?\u201d This isn\u2019t about picking on Butler \u2013 lots of players are put to this litmus test as a way of gauging the strength of a team\u2019s roster. Sometimes it even extends to \u201c\u2026 if So-And-So is your second-best player?\u201d Until these playoffs, Butler hadn\u2019t earned affirmative answers to that second question, never mind the first. But he has emerged as a cornerstone guy in the bubble, with as much will as skill, as much tenacity as talent. It would be tough to pick against him as King of the Hill in this series, as far as a total package of ability, leadership, toughness and will. 2. Who are the X-factors for each team? We\u2019re going with Marcus Smart for Boston and Tyler Herro for Miami. They\u2019re a contrast in styles and resumes, with Smart as a forceful, grinding veteran defensive ace and Herro as the lithe, smooth young jump shooter. Smart\u2019s ability to stymie Miami\u2019s backcourt weapons such as Goran Dragic, Duncan Robinson and Kendrick Nunn could be huge, while he gave Toronto some fits with his own 3-point prowess. Herro\u2019s learning curve has been like a fighter jet off the deck of an aircraft carrier, all rapid verticality to become a go-to option at age 20. 3. Will Gordon Hayward return in this series? Hayward, the Celtics\u2019 injury-bugged wing, sprained his right ankle in the opening game of the first round against Philadelphia. His recovery has been slow, but at least he\u2019s out of quarantine. \u201cI think he\u2019ll be back at some point in the series, but I don\u2019t know when,\u201d said Stevens. He has been working with Boston\u2019s training staff while still not cleared for full contact. If he comes back at anything close to his regular-season form (17.5 ppg, 6.7 rpg, 4.1 apg, 50 percent shooting), he\u2019ll give the Celtics yet another weapon to stress Miami\u2019s defense. Number to know  10.5 \u2014 In their five-game series against the Milwaukee Bucks, the Heat scored 10.5 more points per 100 possessions ( 113.0 ) than the Bucks\u2019 top-ranked defense allowed in the regular season ( 102.5 ). That was, by far, the biggest such offensive differential in the conference semifinals. In their seven-game series against the Toronto Raptors, the Celtics allowed 10.5 fewer points per 100 possessions (100.3) than the Raptors scored in the regular season (110.8). That was, by far, the biggest such defensive differential in the conference semifinals. The Heat ranked second in 3-point percentage (37.9%) in the regular season and rank third (38.0%) in the playoffs. The Celtics ranked second in opponent 3-point percentage (34.0%) in the regular season and rank first (30.5%) in the playoffs. So it will be strength vs. strength on Miami\u2019s end of the floor. Boston ranked second defensively (106.3 points allowed per 100 possessions) among Eastern Conference teams against Miami in the regular season, and the Celtics\u2019 December win was one of only seven times this season that the Heat were held under a point per possession. But Miami had a big offensive game (without Jimmy Butler) when the two teams met in the restart, taking 43 (56%) of their 77 shots from 3-point range and scoring 112 points on just 95 possessions. \u2014 John Schuhmann The pick  Boston took two out of three meetings in the regular season, though the only meeting since Feb. 1 went Miami\u2019s way in the bubble Aug. 4. Of greater impact, possibly, is the week of rest the Heat will have earned by the time the East finals begin \u2013 that was Miami\u2019s reward for not merely upsetting the favored Bucks but doing so in five games. Boston had to labor hard to the final minutes of a Game 7 to eliminate the Raptors. But three days to rest and prep, without any travel fatigue, should be enough. Besides, this round isn\u2019t going to be a quick knockout for anybody. Miami\u2019s full embrace of the idea they\u2019ll control their fate, and the defenders they\u2019ll attach to the Celtics best scorers, favors sweat more than style.

And the Denver Nuggets don\u2019t care if you think they should\u2019ve already been bounced out of the NBA bubble by now. The bubble\u2019s most resilient bunch was at it again Friday night, fighting off elimination and muddying up the Western Conference finals plans of the Los Angeles Clippers with a stunning second-half comeback for a 111-105 Game 5 win . It\u2019s the fourth time in these playoffs that Michael Malone\u2019s team has staved off elimination, the most of any team in a postseason since the Houston Rockets did it four times in the 2015 playoffs. They\u2019ll have to do it again Sunday in Game 6 ( 1 ET, ESPN ), an opportunity Malone said his team relishes, especially with seemingly everyone else having already counted his crew out. They\u2019ve already battled back from a 3-1 deficit in the bubble ( first round against Utah ) to advance to this point. These Nuggets, for some strange reason, seem extremely comfortable with being uncomfortable. And they won\u2019t go away without a fight, no matter what Hall of Famer Charles Barkley says about them on Inside the NBA (he joked at halftime that the Nuggets were already packed up and ready to depart from the bubble). \u201cAs far as Charles Barley,\u201d Malone said, \u201cwe\u2019re not going home yet. We ain\u2019t gone fishing yet. We\u2019re going to live to play a Game 6 and try to stretch this series out and try to win it. I know everybody\u2019s excited about the Lakers playing the Clippers in the Western Conference finals but we\u2019re hoping to have something to say about that.\u201d The Nuggets kept their season alive with contributions from up and down their roster. Veteran power forward Paul Millsap sparked them, scoring 14 of his 17 points in the second half, after getting tangled up and going chest-to-chest with Marcus Morris just before halftime. \u201cI think that was a huge play that nobody will probably talk about,\u201d Malone said. \u201cWhen you have a seasoned veteran who has had enough and is not just going to sit there and take it, and he stood up. And I thought his response to that situation really helped our team respond. It kind of gave us a group toughness and that was a pivotal play, a turning point in the game.\u201d The Nuggets went from trailing by 15 points with 9:42 to play to their first lead on a Nikola Jokic 3-pointer with 7:06 to play in the game, flipping the energy switch and snatching momentum from the Clippers on both ends of the floor. \u201cThey played desperation ball. They didn\u2019t have a choice,\u201d George said. \u201cCredit them for not wanting to go home. They played great down the stretch.\u201d And it was rookie forward Michael Porter Jr. who had perhaps the biggest plays down the stretch for the Nuggets. His deep 3-pointer, his only made field goal of the night, with 1:11 to play pushed a two-point lead to five. He added two rebounds and a block to help seal the win. All this after he spent the time between Games 4 and 5 in the social media crosshairs for his postgame comments late Wednesday night, when he vented about his role after the Nuggets\u2019 Game 4 loss. He suggested the ball had to move around, beyond the two-man game of Jokic and Jamal Murray, if the Nuggets were going to beat a team like the Clippers. He drew the ire of superstars around the league, guys like Portland\u2019s Damian Lillard, who took the youngster to task for speaking out of turn. But Porter Jr. was on the floor at crunch time with the Nuggets\u2019 season on the line. \u201cMan, I think Jok[ic] found me on the wing and everybody knows it wasn\u2019t the best shot selection,\u201d Porter said, \u201cbut something made me shoot it, so I shot it \u2026 it was a clutch shot, but I\u2019m glad I could help my team.\u201d Malone loved the block and rebound that followed, two plays on the defensive end, where Porter\u2019s game remains weakest, while acknowledging that the rookie simple has something special about him. \u201cWhat you love about Michael, is that whether it\u2019s just youthful inexperience or not really understanding the magnitude of the situation, but he has supreme confidence,\u201d Malone said. \u201cThe guy is a tireless worker. He is a gym rat and for every shot he makes in a game, he\u2019s had thousands upon thousands of reps in a practice gym. So what it says is, he has confidence in himself. We have confidence in him.\u201d Porter Jr. absorbed all of the criticism that came his way between games but leaned into that confidence from his teammates and coaches. \u201cI kind of tried to block that out,\u201d Porter said. \u201cEverything I said \u2026 I stand by what I say. And I didn\u2019t mean it in any kind of disrespectful way. My coaches and my teammates, they all know that. We talked as a team and everybody was on the same page coming into today. But Dame and those guys, I respect all those guys, so \u2026 especially those superstars in the league talking to a young guy like me. You want to listen and you don\u2019t want to have an ego, and just think you\u2019re always right. So it took what those guys said and I listened to it. Everybody has their opinion, but that was blocked out before today and everybody was on the same page.\u201d That page is filled with the stuff Malone preaches to and about his team on a regular basis. It\u2019s the stuff that has fueled the performances of guys like Murray (26 points) and Jokic (22 and 14 rebounds) in a postseason run that has had produced its magical moments when the Nuggets appear facing the longest odds.  \u201cI think just being a very tough, resilient group that believes,\u201d Malone said. \u201cWe have belief. I know there\u2019s not a lot of belief \u2026 I heard one of the commentators say the other day that seven teams are left in the bubble, or eight teams are left in the bubble and seven of them have a chance to win a championship. And we were the one that he thinks did not have a chance to win a championship. \u201cBut we don\u2019t listen to all that. We believe in ourselves. We believe in the process that we\u2019ve been going through in the last five years to get us here. That is a very good basketball team over there. There is a reason they are the favorites to win it all. But \u2026 our guys believe. We\u2019re tough. Everybody continues to count us out. That\u2019s the way we like it and we live to die another day\u201d * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

We\u2019ll see how it goes. But they should get our best shot. If it\u2019s good enough, then we\u2019ll go to the next game after that.\u201d The Rockets are 2-10 all time when trailing 3-1 in a series. So, when the team met ahead of Friday\u2019s practice session, it spent plenty of time discussing its experience with 3-1 series deficits. The Lakers own a record of 35-1 all time when leading a series 3-1. But it was D\u2019Antoni and the Phoenix Suns that handed Los Angeles its only loss (2006) with a 3-1 lead, and eventually won that series. James Harden, meanwhile, helped Houston rebound from a 3-1 deficit to the Los Angeles Clippers that featured Rockets reserve Austin Rivers in the 2015 Western Conference semifinals to advance to the conference finals. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of guys that when we had our meeting that were in the room that have come down from 3-1 and have won,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said. \u201cI did it in Phoenix against the Lakers. James did it against the Clippers. So, they\u2019ve done it. Denver just now did it against Utah. So, yeah, it\u2019s a one-game series. We\u2019ve got to play to win one game. Then, the one thing we talked about [is] we want to give them our best shot. If our best shot\u2019s not good enough, so be it. But we have not given in the three losses our best shot. We need to get back to that.\u201d It certainly won\u2019t be easy. Despite the 110-100 score in Game 4, the Los Angeles Lakers churned out their most dominating performance of the series in that contest they led by as many as 23 points and never trailed. The Lakers limited Houston\u2019s top scorer Harden to a 2-for-11 shooting night, while feasting off the contributions of six double-figure scorers. They outscored Houston 62-24 in the paint, 19-2 on the break, and 17-3 in second-chance points. Los Angeles even held the speedy Rockets to zero fast break points and zero second-chance points through the first three quarters of Game 4, which registered as a first in any playoff games since 1997, the start of the play-by-play era. Rockets center P.J. Tucker admitted the difficulty in trying to summon the tenacity Saturday needed to rebound from a 3-1 series deficit after experiencing such a deflating loss in Game 4. \u201cThat\u2019s the tough thing. I think that\u2019s the thing that a lot of teams fight with in these situations,\u201d Tucker said. \u201cFor us, it\u2019s just to get that feeling back, especially from Game 1 and even spurts of Game 2, where we just honestly played the way we play. I feel like the last two games, we haven\u2019t played Rockets basketball. That\u2019s the biggest thing: to get back to Rockets basketball. We\u2019re not getting enough possessions, we\u2019re not getting up enough 3\u2019s, we\u2019re not playing as fast as we normally do. Part of that is we\u2019re taking the ball out a lot of times. But for us, we\u2019ve still got to pick our pace up and play with a lot more energy. The ball has to find ways to move better and get more 3\u2019s up. But that\u2019s got to come from our defense. From being down 2-1 to 3-1, there\u2019s no difference. You still have the same mindset. It\u2019s the playoffs. Every single game matters, every game counts, every possession counts. There\u2019s desperation throughout the entire time.\u201d Especially now with the Rockets sitting at somewhat of a crossroads. D\u2019Antoni is in the final year of his contract, and Houston\u2019s two brightest stars \u2014 Harden and Russell Westbrook \u2014 are now on the wrong side of 30. Surely, there might also be some second guessing concerning what Houston gave up (two first-round picks, two swaps) to land Westbrook, not to mention how the team\u2019s decision to go all-in on small ball might affect the team\u2019s roster if the Rockets decide moving forward to play a more conventional style. Houston figures it can worry about all that later, as it chooses to concentrate energy on breaking the team\u2019s first three-game postseason losing streak under D\u2019Antoni. \u201cThe series isn\u2019t over yet,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cWe just saw the Utah and Denver series. I\u2019ve been up 3-1 before versus Houston when I played for the Clippers. It happens, man. So, it\u2019s tough. It\u2019s going to be hard. They\u2019re a great team. But we believe if we make the adjustments that we need to make, if we execute them, we still have a shot. It\u2019s gonna take a lot of effort. It\u2019s not going to be perfect. We\u2019re going to make mistakes. If we keep playing, we still believe that we\u2019re the better team. But we\u2019ve got to go out there and prove that because right now, they\u2019ve been the better team.\u201d * * * Michael C. Wright is a senior writer for NBA.com.

Los Angeles took command from the outset, leading by as many as 23 points in the first game of the series that featured absolutely no lead changes. The Lakers led by 16 with 4:24 remaining, and watched their advantage disintegrate to just five points with 58.7 ticks left on the strength of a 12-2 Rockets run. Interestingly, the teams interpreted that fourth-quarter spurt differently. The Rockets took an optimistic viewpoint, hoping that momentum carries over into Saturday\u2019s Game 5. Los Angeles, meanwhile, saw Houston\u2019s fourth-quarter run as unacceptable for a team with championship aspirations in a high-stakes fight against a high-octane offense. \u201cIt\u2019s a 48-minute game,\u201d Lakers coach Frank Vogel said. \u201cWe know if we got a big lead and they got down at crunch time, they\u2019re gonna get desperate. We didn\u2019t take care of the ball well enough and execute, offensively, well enough. But it\u2019s something we can work on and improve. It\u2019s a heck of a win for our group, and we\u2019re not gonna be comfortable playing against this team with the firepower that they have. We\u2019re up 3-1, but we\u2019ve got to stay the course and stay the more desperate team.\u201d Los Angeles owns a record of 35-1 all-time when leading a series 3-1. The last time the Lakers built such an advantage and lost was in 2006 against the Phoenix Suns, coincidentally, led then by Rockets coach Mike D\u2019Antoni. \u201cI think we know the formula,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said. \u201cWe know we\u2019re in a big hole now. But the next game is the game we\u2019ve got to win. We\u2019ll go all out, and if we lay it on the line like we did in the fourth quarter, we\u2019ll be fine.\u201d Here are three observations from Game 4: 1. Lakers\u2019 almost small-ball lineup  Los Angeles combated Houston\u2019s highly-publicized small-ball lineup with a smaller starting lineup of its own featuring Anthony Davis starting just his third game this season at the center spot and Markieff Morris at power forward alongside James, Danny Green and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope. \u201cI don\u2019t look at it as a small lineup,\u201d James said. \u201cWe\u2019ve still got A.D. at 6-11, we\u2019ve still got [Markieff] at 6-10. I\u2019m 6-9, Danny [Green] is 6-7 and K.C.P. is 6-6 \u00bd, 6-7 (he\u2019s actually 6-5).\u201d Indeed. That group spent a total of 9 minutes on the floor together, producing an offensive rating of 100.0 and a defensive rating of 70.6 while finishing with a true shooting percentage of 50.4 and a rebounding percentage of 60.0. Houston hit just 1 of 5 from deep in the opening quarter, as the Lakers finished the first quarter ahead 26-22. \u201cWe\u2019re just able to rotate faster, [and] we can switch a lot,\u201d said Davis, who finished with a game-high 29 points to go with 12 rebounds, five assists and a pair of blocks. \u201cWhen we match up with those guys, we\u2019re able to switch out, keep the ball in front of us. When they do drive and get by one of us, and start kicking it out for 3s, our guys are able to rotate and cover up for our mistakes. We still have enough size where we can rebound the basketball and kind of punish them on the other end as well.\u201d 2. You\u2019ve probably heard very little about Talen Horton-Tucker  But the rookie from Iowa State put on a quick first-half show in his brief postseason debut. Horton-Tucker entered the game for Kuzma with 9:46 left in the second quarter, and quickly poured in his five points on back-to-back buckets in a span of 44 seconds. His finger roll off a Rondo assist with 4:59 left in the first half gave the Lakers a 10-point lead. More importantly, Horton-Tucker\u2019s play showed he wasn\u2019t afraid of the moment and that the team can trust him moving forward in the playoffs. \u201cWe got the rook in the game today, and he was huge in his first stint in the postseason,\u201d James said. Added Davis: \u201cWe\u2019re all so happy for him. In a big game, he comes in and played extremely well on both ends of the floor.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a surprise to anyone on the Lakers. With Morris joining the starting lineup, Vogel saw an opportunity to give the extra minutes to Horton-Tucker. A second-round pick from Iowa State, Horton-Tucker had played in just six games during the regular season. \u201cHer performed exceptionally well, and none of us were surprised,\u201d Vogel said. \u201cWe\u2019ve watched him play on the off days in the pick-up games. We\u2019ve seen him a lot in the bubble here. We didn\u2019t see him a lot [before the season was suspended due to coronavirus] aside from obviously the G League games during the season. But he\u2019s a talented kid. He\u2019s unafraid. He plays beyond his years. When we decided to go smaller, starting Markieff, we knew we had some minutes there to get another wing in there. I just wanted to give Talen a chance because he continued to prove himself in practice. I like what he brings to the table.\u201d 3. The Lakers obliterated Houston in the hustle stats  That was pretty much the story of the game as Los Angeles owned a 17-3 advantage over the Rockets in second-chance points , outscored them on the break 19-2 and dominated paint scoring 62-24. The Lakers also outrebounded Houston 52-26, in addition to holding them to zero fast break points and zero second-chance points through the first three quarters, marking the first time since 1997 that\u2019s happened in any playoff game, per ESPN Stats & Info . Los Angeles still walked away thinking it could\u2019ve performed better. Rockets star James Harden connected on just 2 field goal attempts, but still managed to score 21 points by hitting 16 of 20 from the free-throw line. One of Los Angeles\u2019 top priorities against Harden is preventing him from getting to the charity stripe. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to limit anything that we can from him because he can score,\u201d James said. \u201cHe gets into the paint with his runners, with his floaters. Obviously, he has the step-back. He has the 3s in transition. He has his catch-and-shoot 3s when he\u2019s off the ball.\u201d Harden drained only one of his six attempts from deep. Interestingly, the Rockets averaged 51.6 3-point attempts per game over their first 17 outings in the bubble. Over the last two games, Houston\u2019s 3-point attempts have fallen to an average of 31.5. \u201cA lot of it is what they\u2019re doing,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said. \u201cThey\u2019re really spreading out, but that means we should get to the [free-throw] line and get some layups. We did when we were doing it the right way. In the second half, we get 59 points, and a lot of that was just putting our heads down and going. There\u2019s no reason why we can\u2019t repeat that.\u201d The small-ball Rockets have now been outrebounded in 34 of their last 37 games. The Game 4 loss also marked D\u2019Antoni\u2019s first when his teams trailed 2-1. So, with the stakes so high for Game 4, Harden was asked why the Rockets came out so flat. \u201cThat\u2019s a good question,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing we can do about it now.

But the third Game 7 of these playoffs is here, set to tip off Friday at 9 ET on TNT. Every game of a series is different and we can probably expect the unexpected in a Game 7. But with a trip to the Eastern Conference finals on the line, here are two things to watch for, along with a few more notes to get you ready\u2026 Raptors head coach Nick Nurse said after Game 6 that he\u2019d been looking to get to his small-ball lineup \u2014 Kyle Lowry, Fred VanVleet, Norman Powell, OG Anunoby and Pascal Siakam \u2014 for a few games. \u201cIt\u2019s about three games in the making,\u201d Nurse said. \u201cI\u2019ve been talking about doing it and getting to it for a long time, and I just had never found that or pulled the trigger until we got way down the other night.\u201d That lineup played about five minutes in Game 2 of the first round, less than a minute in the fourth quarter of Game 1 (with Boston up 24), and four minutes (as a transitional lineup) over the second and third quarters of Game 5. Nurse then went to it with 8:22 to go in the fourth quarter on Wednesday, after the Celtics got (and made) open 3s on four straight possessions to turn a seven-point deficit into a one-point lead. On the first of those, Serge Ibaka was a little slow with a close-out. The second was created by Kemba Walker getting a half step on Ibaka\u2019s pick-and-roll coverage. So Nurse decided to sacrifice size for speed. \u201cIt just gives us a little bit better chance to guard them,\u201d Nurse said of the small lineup. \u201cThat\u2019s the main thing. It\u2019s tough when Kemba\u2019s so fast and it\u2019s hard for our bigs sometimes to keep up with him when they\u2019re up, because he can shoot the 3. You\u2019ve got to be up, and then if you creep up too far he darts by you.\u201d At that 8:22 mark of the fourth, the Celtics had scored 89 points on 76 possessions (1.17 per). The small-ball lineup played the rest of the game (save for Marc Gasol checking in for the Raptors\u2019 last possession of regulation) and Boston scored 33 points on 35 possessions (0.94 per) from that point forward. There were possessions where the speed paid off. With 3:20 left in the fourth quarter, Anunoby hedged a Walker\/Daniel Theis pick-and-roll, prevented a pass to Theis in the paint, and then Siakam shut down a late-clock drive from Jayson Tatum. With Jaylen Brown\u2019s put-back coming just a tick after the shot clock expired, every second in that possession mattered. Early in the first overtime, Anunoby was able to hedge and recover again, forcing a tough step-back (from Brown) himself. And the biggest defensive possession of the second overtime \u2013 Powell\u2019s clean strip of Tatum \u2013 was a result of the all five defenders being able to swarm and scramble. The small ball paid off on offense, too. With the Raptors down three in the first overtime, Anunoby set a sideline screen for VanVleet, who beat Theis off the dribble, collapsed the defense, and fed Powell in the corner for a 3 that tied the game. And in the second OT, Theis was slow to recover to Anunoby on a pick-and-pop 3 that put the Raptors up one (right before the Powell steal). After scoring well over a point per possession over the first 39 1\/2 minutes of Game 6, the Raptors scored 37 points on 37 possessions with the small lineup. But Nurse liked what he saw on that end of the floor. \u201cWe were doing it more for some better chances defensively,\u201d Nurse said Thursday after reviewing the Game 6 film. \u201cI thought at the offensive end it really spread the ball around. Norm was making shots, OG popped, made a shot, OG drove and kicked one out, Fred and Kyle. There was a lot more I think happening at the offensive end that made us more difficult to guard.\u201d Back on defense, there were examples were the Raptors were too small. With Toronto up four in the fourth quarter, the Celtics were able to tie the game with two Theis buckets. The first was an easy put-back and the second was a dunk after he established early position down low against Anunoby. And early in the first OT, Anunoby provided far-less-than-Ibaka-level rim protection when Brown drove past Lowry. Another big component of those last 15 minutes of Game 6, which wasn\u2019t necessarily tied to the Raptors playing small, was Tatum and Walker screening for each other in an effort to get VanVleet switched onto Tatum. The Celtics often used an action that the Dallas Mavericks would use to get Dirk Nowitzki defended by a small guard at or above the nail (the middle of the foul line). Here are some examples\u2026 Play 1: Powell switches Tatum\u2019s screen for Walker and Tatum catches the ball at the top of the key. But before he attacks VanVleet, he hits Brown in the left corner, open because Lowry is shading toward the mismatch. Brown misses the open 3. Play 2: Tatum catches on the right side of the floor and tries to attack with the dribble. VanVleet is able to stand him up and Marcus Smart misses a contested 3 from the left wing. Play 3: VanVleet gets over Tatum\u2019s screen and Siakam recovers back to Tatum on the left wing. Tatum loses control on a spin move and turns the ball over. Play 4: Tatum gets the switch again and gets a half step on VanVleet on a drive down the left side of the lane. Anunoby steps up and Tatum tosses a lob to Theis hanging out in the dunker spot. Play 5: Tatum gets the switch again and this time takes VanVleet to the low post. Anunoby comes over to help before Tatum even gets the ball and Smart tosses another lob to Theis over the top. There were more examples of Tatum-Walker screens down the stretch. On the Celtics\u2019 final possession of regulation, Tatum slipped out of the screen for Walker, keeping VanVleet off balance and allowing Walker to get into the paint , where he drew a foul on Anunoby that wasn\u2019t called. Walker got into the paint again via the same action late in the second overtime, feeding Theis with another lob after drawing help from Anunoby. But earlier in the second OT, VanVleet stayed with Walker when Tatum slipped out of the screen. Siakam then got over Walker\u2019s screen for Tatum and forced Tatum into a step-back airball . Lowry was Tatum\u2019s primary defender early in the series, but Anunoby has defended him almost as much through six games, and Tatum has shot just 9-for-27 against Anunoby. He\u2019s 8-for-15 in about half the matchup time against VanVleet. The results of the VanVleet switch at the end of Game 6 were mixed, though you can\u2019t get anything better than those two lobs to an untouched big man. Maybe those lobs are tougher to throw over Ibaka\u2019s help than they are against Anunoby, but even if the Raptors are playing a center, Tatum and VanVleet will be on the floor for most of Game 7. And the Celtics will surely seek out that switch. A few other numbers worth noting\u2026 * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

They\u2019re on the brink of elimination, this time down 3-1 to the Los Angeles Lakers in their Western Conference semifinal after a 110-100 Game 4 loss here Thursday night. The former Kia MVPs have to be tired of this space. Coming up short routinely in the postseason carries an extra burden for superstars. Doing it with two superstars \u2014 old friends and former teammates in their first year reunited after last summer\u2019s blockbuster trade \u2014 only intensifies the scrutiny. Harden has taken soul-crushing back-to-back playoff losses at the hands of Golden State, while Westbrook only emerged this year from the first round for the first time since Kevin Durant exited Oklahoma City. > Game 5: Rockets vs. Lakers, Saturday at 8 ET on ESPN And now they have to try to recover from a dismal first three quarters in Game 4 and hang on to the energy of a fourth-quarter surge that proved there was still signs of life coming from a seemingly flattened bunch. Voices were raised in the Rockets\u2019 locker room after the game, the gravity of their situation no doubt weighing on everyone. The real heavy dialogue, however, starts now. Westbrook and Harden have to convince each other, and their supporting cast, that there is still a chance that this bubble odyssey isn\u2019t over. \u201cThe conversation is, number one, take care of the play in front of you,\u201d Westbrook said. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously win or go home, so you have to be able to make sure you come out and have that mindset. And it\u2019s one game at a time, especially here down in the bubble. \u201cIt\u2019s a different scenario than any other playoffs, so to be able to take our time and make sure we take advantage of our size and our speed. We have to do it if we want to win. We just have to come back to what gives us the best chance of winning. And that conversation starts tonight and tomorrow and hopefully, we can take care of business the next game.\u201d After winning Game 1, the business of upsetting the No. 1-seeded Lakers seem like a distinct possibility. The environment, the circumstances and the momentum after their Game 7 win over Oklahoma City in the first round was all in the Rockets\u2019 favor. But in the span of a few days it all came apart. The Lakers, led by LeBron James and Anthony Davis, made their adjustments to the Rockets\u2019 small-ball scheme. And then Rockets starter Danuel House Jr. missed Games 3 and 4 while the league is reportedly investigating a potential violation of the bubble protocol at the Rockets\u2019 team hotel. Asking Harden and Westbrook for explanations as to why the Rockets came out so flat in the first three quarters of a game with so much riding on it was really a rhetorical exercise. They didn\u2019t have to say what most everyone else is thinking. \u201cI don\u2019t have an explanation for you,\u201d Westbrook said. \u201cBut there should have been a sense of urgency on everybody\u2019s part. But we fought, which was good. And we know what we have to do. It\u2019s going to take a lot of effort, it\u2019s going to take everyone being uncomfortable in their role and making sure we understand we all have to sacrifice, you know, some of the things we may love to do. But we\u2019ve got to scramble, that gives us the best chance to win games.\u201d Asked to elaborate on those sacrifices that needed to be made, Westbrook caught himself in mid-sentence. \u201cI\u2019m not, I\u2019m not \u2026 Coach has to make that decision individually,\u201d Westbrook said. \u201cI know I can\u2019t speak for anybody else, but just for myself \u2026 just making sure that I do what I need to do, bringing my energy and effort and competing on a very, very high level for 48 minutes is what I need to make sure I need to do.\u201d The referendum on this dynamic duo, this team and really this era of Rockets basketball will have to wait. They\u2019ll have at least one more chance to exhaust whatever they have left to fend off the coming Lakers\u2019 knockout punch. \u201cI mean, there\u2019s nothing we can do about it now,\u201d Harden said. \u201cWe just got to be ready for Game 5 and bring that same energy [from the fourth quarter of Game 4] and have it curry over to Game 5.\u201d Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

Lacing up her sneakers in Australia, Lithuania, Israel, Russia and Poland allowed her to earn a paycheck during the WNBA offseason and experience different cultures in the process. \u201cThey definitely do things differently than we do here in America,\u201d she says. In 2018, Montgomery\u2019s itinerant career led her to Atlanta, which has a culture more akin to her upbringing. The WNBA veteran believes there are pervasive problems in the southern city, however, that are antithetical to her convictions as a Black woman. She labeled Atlanta a \u201crepeat offender\u201d in regard to voter suppression. Montgomery, 33, has been working relentlessly to increase votes in Georgia after she opted out of the league\u2019s season restart this summer. She joined the LeBron James-led \u201cMore Than A Vote\u201d campaign and launched her own initiative titled \u201cRemember the 3rd.\u201d I spoke with Montgomery two weeks ago, coincidentally during the same time the Milwaukee Bucks staged a protest against police brutality. When I relayed the news, she voiced support for the players: \u201cIn this climate, everyone has to allow people to grieve how they want. They have to allow people to feel how they want and to say what they feel because this is a very intense time. There\u2019s a lot going on, and as an athlete, the dynamic is uncomfortable.\u201d Montgomery talks about that uncomfortable dynamic, sitting out the WNBA season, getting people to vote and building up HBCUs. (Editor\u2019s Note: The following 1-on-1 conversation has been condensed and edited.) * * * NBA.com: When was the exact moment you decided to opt out of the WNBA restart? Montgomery: I would say talking to my parents the night of the George Floyd protests. I live here in Atlanta, and I just remember the protests were at my front door. I was talking to my parents about what I should do, and they were giving me advice from their experiences. That\u2019s where the seed was planted. I was looking at the protests outside my window while also looking at it on my TV screen. I really wasn\u2019t focused on basketball anymore after that. What exactly did your parents say to convince you of your decision, and what were their experiences? They were telling me not to be worried. This is what people do when they don\u2019t feel like they\u2019re heard. So they were calming me. My mom was in Detroit when the (1967) Detroit riots happened. She was there. She told me, \u201cAlthough you\u2019ve never been a part of a protest before, I have, and those are people who feel like they\u2019re not being listened to.\u201d One of the initiatives you created while being away from the game encourages people to vote in the upcoming Nov. 3 election. How exactly will this work? So the initiative is called \u201cRemember the 3rd.\u201d We\u2019re going to host three workshops and a pep rally. The workshops will educate people on the things we might have learned and forgot, as well as the things we might have never learned. People don\u2019t vote locally a lot of times because people don\u2019t really care or think it affects them. They don\u2019t know what the mayor does, for example. We want to connect that and show what it is local officials do, how it affects your everyday life and why you should feel the need to vote. We need to connect the passion we have to protest and drive that passion to the polls. You\u2019re also working on uplifting HBCUs, particularly in Atlanta with Morris Brown College. How did that come about and what\u2019s your ultimate goal? Police brutality is tearing down the Black community. Since HBCUs are a representation of the Black community, I want to build those up, and I\u2019m starting with Morris Brown College. I\u2019m working on trying to raise $3 million and that\u2019s not a small task. We\u2019ve called the initiative \u201cThe Last Yard.\u201d Morris Brown is an HBCU with so much history. If people don\u2019t know, they should Google. The young people probably know it from \u201cDrumline\u201d with Nick Cannon. That was one of the schools. But they are also one of the schools that need a lot of help right now. They have not been accredited for 20 years. Getting a school their accreditation not only starts to build that community, but it builds up the workforce since more faculty will be hired. We want to get them accreditation, but we also want to try to make Morris Brown tech savvy and tech innovative. We want to have a tech center there because the tech space is not something you always hear HBCUs leading in. Well, let\u2019s try to change that because we all know that tech is the future right? You mentioned police brutality. Can you elaborate more on your thoughts there? My thoughts on police brutality is all it\u2019s doing is breaking down the Black family. These murders are not just a murder. It\u2019s pulling families apart. It\u2019s torn a kid from their parents. It\u2019s breaking the family dynamic in an already broken community. I can remember thinking my dad was a superhero when I was four years old. I was racing my sisters, and I was getting whooped because I\u2019m the youngest. My dad came running behind, picked me up and ran me across the finish line. We ended up blowing my sisters out in the race. So if I can still remember that from when I was about four or five, can you imagine something traumatic that the kids of Jacob Blake witnessed? They\u2019ll never forget it. Since this is happening so often and it\u2019s constantly breaking down our community, I wondered how I can build it up. I want to do something that unifies everybody and builds up our community. We all want to create change and we all want to do something for our community. What led you to tackle education? There are all these different areas where you can see systemic racism. The area where I\u2019m going to focus on is education because I really firmly believe that the more someone knows about a topic the better their perspective can be. One way or the other, you start to see other people\u2019s views. Education to me is everything and not just because my mom was a college professor for 30 years. I lived overseas for 10 years, so I saw a lot of different cultures. We were there for six-to-seven months at a time and submerged in those cultures. They definitely do things differently than we do here in America, but that helped me see that some ways we do things in America may not be right. What are your thoughts on top athletes going to HBCUs? Some athletes feel if they go to an HBCU, they won\u2019t get seen. But it\u2019s the day and age where everything is streamed. Literally everything is streamed on the Internet. Scouts from the NBA go overseas. They have global games to go find talent, so if you are here in America, it\u2019s kind of understood that the scouts will find you. When you talk to athletes, especially in a sport like football, one of the things that really separates different schools and universities is their facilities. You\u2019ll see the big schools have multi-million dollar facilities. Top recruits get blown away and want to be able to use those facilities. When you see someone like a Makur Maker choose to go to Howard, you really commend it because he knows what he could\u2019ve had and he still chose the HBCU experience anyway. I don\u2019t want to tell athletes they should go to HBCUs, but I just think that everyone now should just give them an extra look. Give them a consideration. How do you plan to continue \u201cRemember the 3rd\u201d beyond this upcoming election? There\u2019s a lot of different things that get decided other than elections. There\u2019s a lot of different laws getting passed when no one\u2019s looking. There\u2019s a lot of activity when it\u2019s not just election time. So that\u2019s what\u2019s going to be the goal for \u201cRemember the 3rd.\u201d It\u2019s about remembering this passion we have right now and where we\u2019re trying to go with it. The place we\u2019re going is to the polls, but after that, there\u2019s still work to be done. Voting is not the only step; it\u2019s just the first step. Arresting the cops for wrongdoings is a step, but it\u2019s also a band aid for the real problem. The laws in place and the laws being taken out are the real problem. So if people were educated more about what was going, they would feel more of a need to speak up and say things. How would you like to see NBA and WNBA players work closer together on these issues? I think this is the first year where you see so much continuity across sports leagues, not even just the NBA and WNBA. I think an example of working closer is how closely I\u2019m working with the \u201cMore Than A Vote\u201d campaign. Everyone knows that it\u2019s LeBron James\u2019 campaign. Shortly after I opted out, his team reached out to me and asked would I want to be a part of what they\u2019re doing. With me being in Georgia where voter suppression is real, I responded saying, \u201cOf course.\u201d Then later, State Farm arena was opened as a polling location, and I feel like I had a real impact. That made me say, \u201cWow, we\u2019re doing something here.\u201d You collaborated with NBA players earlier this summer when Kyrie Irving held a call to express concerns about playing. Can you talk about what you took from that? Yeah, I was actually on the call. I think the narrative got lost along the way. I think that people were more focused on the different views that people had of how to create change rather than saying, \u201cWow, look at all these NBA players wanting to figure out how they can make a difference.\u201d I left the call smiling after seeing there were that many players interested and passionate about this topic. It was beautiful. It made me feel empowered. I love that these NBA players are all excited about how they can be progressive and be a catalyst for change. Kyrie caught so much flack, but he is a man of his word because he created a fund for WNBA players knowing that some of us opted out for social justice, health causes or other reasons. I don\u2019t know all the details of how everything played out, but I do know for somebody to do that unprompted, it says a lot about Kyrie. So we have to pay attention and make sure that we\u2019re not creating division among people that all have the same passion. We all want to create change and we all want to do something for our community. * * * Khari Arnold is a Senior Producer at  NBA.com  and graduate from Howard University. You can email him  here  .

A journey of generations in the making will be realized with just one more win over the Denver Nuggets in the Western Conference semifinals. Making a trip to the Western Conference finals for the first time is a milestone worthy of attention. Now if someone could just convince Clippers coach Doc Rivers and his stars that it\u2019s something to celebrate. They wanted no part of any premature celebration after delivering a defensive masterpiece with a 96-85 throttling of the Denver Nuggets Wednesday night. A commanding 3-1 lead didn\u2019t inspire any sense of entitlement from the Clippers. Rivers wouldn\u2019t allow it anyways. > Game 5: Clippers vs. Nuggets, Friday at 6:30 ET on TNT \u201cUm, nothing,\u201d Rivers said of the reaction in the locker room. \u201cLike, that\u2019s not our goal. I don\u2019t even think no one cares, to be honest. So it was a zero reaction is what I would say. We haven\u2019t done anything yet.\u201d Rivers is right on both counts. This Clippers team set a high bar for this season that doesn\u2019t just include a spot making a conference finals appearance. They entered the season with legitimate championship aspirations, courtesy of the offseason acquisition of reigning Finals MVP Kawhi Leonard and his superstar plus-one Paul George. And they can\u2019t take the Nuggets lightly, not after seeing them battle back from a 3-1 deficit to win their first-round series over Utah with a dramatic Game 7 finish a week ago. So technically speaking, Rivers is correct in warding off any sense of security in his locker room. He has an ideal surrogate in Leonard, whose ability to remain unimpressed with anything other than winning the ultimate prize is unrivaled around this NBA campus. It\u2019s not that Leonard is immune to the subconscious good vibrations that tend to accompany playing this deep into a postseason. In fact, he knows those feelings better than anyone else in the Clippers\u2019 traveling party. He\u2019s played until the final day of the season three times in his career, in back-to-back seasons (2013 and 2014) with the San Antonio Spurs and again last season with the Raptors. So he knows how it feels on both sides of the championship divide. He knows that a team can\u2019t skip any steps on the path to a Larry O\u2019Brien Trophy. And he knows these Clippers, as deep and talented as any group still competing here, have plenty of unfinished business to tend to, Friday and beyond. \u201cIt\u2019s always good if you can make it to the next round,\u201d Leonard said.\u201dBut we\u2019ve got a lot of work to do still, the Denver team does not quit. They\u2019re a good group over there, a good coach. We\u2019re still fighting.\u201d With Rivers and Leonard on the case, peeking ahead to that potential all-Los Angeles conference finals against the Lakers, who are up 2-1 on Houston , really is not an option. If they are the work-in-progress Rivers and his stars believe themselves to be, they can\u2019t afford to overlook the Nuggets for a moment, not if they are going to be fully prepared for the challenges ahead. There is still work to be done, things that need to be fine-tuned now, before facing the challenge of the Lakers or even the Rockets, depending on how that series finishes. \u201cWe\u2019re all still learning each other,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cThis is a different team, especially with me and PG. And even the guys that\u2019s been here, it\u2019s a different style of play, different voices that you\u2019re hearing. So we\u2019re still trying to come together. I don\u2019t know where we are right now. We just want to keep getting better, and that\u2019s the focus on each and every play and just be a better unit.\u201d Their performance Wednesday night showed all of the things Leonard spoke of. They got off to a great start and led by as many as 18 points before halftime, only to see the Nuggets rally and tie the score early in the third quarter. The Clippers are still turning it on and off in a way only the deepest and most talented teams can. That might work in the first round or even the conference semifinals. But it won\u2019t be that simple in the conference finals, where a team every bit your equal awaits. \u201cI think our continuity is growing,\u201d George said. \u201cThis team is getting more and more comfortable together. I think the challenge is allowing us to come together. And we\u2019ve been accepting these challenges. We\u2019re having fun with it and we\u2019re growing at the same time.\u201d Just in time to make a little history for the franchise. * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

But point differential don\u2019t mean a thing, and there will be a Game 7 on Friday (9 ET, TNT) after the Raptors\u2019 wild, 125-122, double-overtime victory over the Boston Celtics in Game 6. With their season and title defense on the line, the Raptors made just enough plays across 58 minutes of hectic hoops to stay alive. The Celtics led by as many as 12 points in the second quarter, the Raps led by as many as eight in the third, and the gravity of this series brought them back together for the final 19 minutes, during which neither team led by more than four. Marcus Smart had a triple-double. Toronto started the game in a box-and-1 defense, with Fred VanVleet chasing Kemba Walker. Kyle Lowry got three stitches for a shot to the chin that he didn\u2019t get a call on despite his typical embellishment. The Raptors scored more points on a three-possession sequence of the third quarter (12) than they did in the entire first quarter of Game 5 (11). And though it felt like a slog at times, this was the most efficient game of the series, because the 3s were falling. In fact, both teams shot exactly 19-for-47 from beyond the arc. > Game 7: Celtics vs. Raptors, Friday at 9 ET on TNT There have been 14 instances this season where a team made at least 10 corner 3-pointers in a game, and three of the 14 have been the Celtics against the Raptors in Orlando: Their Aug. 7 meeting (10), Game 1 (10), and Game 6 (11). There have also been 14 instances ( 11 in the regular season and three in the playoffs ) where a team won a game in which its opponent scored more efficiently. Two of those 14 have been Toronto wins in this series (Games 3 and 6). While the Celtics were slightly more efficient on Wednesday, the Raptors had a few extra possessions. And nearly as important as any stop or bucket in Game 6 were the three overtime jump balls that OG Anunoby won (two over Daniel Theis, one over Brown) as the 6-foot-7 \u201ccenter\u201d in the small-ball lineup that Toronto used over the final 18:22. The Celtics played their starting lineup for all of the fourth quarter and both overtimes, and nine players in the game logged more than 47 minutes. Marc Gasol had another rough first half, but helped open the floodgates by starting the third quarter with his first 3-pointer (on his 12th attempt) of the series. Pascal Siakam continued to struggle offensively, but hit a huge face-up jumper to tie the game with less than two minutes to go in the second overtime. Walker should probably have got a foul call on drive at the end of regulation. The Raptors should probably have had more time on the clock after Jayson Tatum fouled Anunoby on the ensuing inbounds play. Though it was the most efficient game of the series, the teams combined to go scoreless on the final seven possessions of regulation and also on five of the six final possessions of the first overtime, with the final play drawn up for a Norman Powell iso. And then, after 53 minutes of grind-it-out basketball, it seemed like neither team could miss. If there was one thing that made sense, it was how the Raptors got their stops in those final five minutes. Before Smart missed a last-second, off-balance 3-pointer for the tie off a full-court pass from Tatum, the Raptors got four stops in the second overtime, and all four came via their hands. Brad Stevens said before Game 6 that he deletes e-mails that include defensive metrics . And he probably didn\u2019t need any e-mails to tell him that Toronto was near the top of the league (ranking second) in both steals and deflections per game. Stevens noted early in the series that the Raptors\u2019 arms would swipe at the ball \u201cevery time you drive it.\u201d And those arms certainly weren\u2019t going to stop swiping with the season on the line. A minute and 15 seconds into the second OT, the Celtics were up four and Brown had the ball in the open floor, dribbling up the right side. With only the 6-1 Fred VanVleet in front of him, Brown attacked. \u201cI know he likes to go right, so I think I\u2019ve cut his right off a little bit,\u201d VanVleet said afterward. \u201cHe went left and tried to put his body on me.\u201d In the middle of the paint, Brown tried to jump off his left foot for a runner over VanVleet, whose \u201cbet on yourself\u201d mantra does not extend to trying to block shots up at the rim. \u201cI\u2019m not really going to do nothing in the air with him,\u201d VanVleet, sixth in the league with 4.2 deflections per 36 minutes, said. \u201cI can\u2019t get to the height that he can get to, but if he brings the basketball down, I\u2019m able to get my hands on it.\u201d As Brown rose, VanVleet came down with his right arm, knocking the the ball out of Brown\u2019s hands , a short-guy blocked shot. He followed it up with a short-guy rebound, almost in the same motion. A few seconds later, Lowry drove past Brown for a tough bucket in the paint to cap one of this game\u2019s many momentum-shifting sequences. On the next possession, Theis rebounded a Tatum airball under the basket. He was in position for a layup, but the ball was below his waist and Powell got his hands on it . The play was initially called a foul, but Raptors coach Nick Nurse challenged the call, and it was reversed. Anunoby then won his third jump ball of the final 10 minutes. The Celtics were still up two the next time down the floor when Brown backed Lowry down to the right block. As Brown turned into the lane for a short jumper, Lowry, 51st in the league with 3.0 deflections per 36, slapped down on the ball. It was another short-guy blocked shot and, like VanVleet two possessions earlier, Lowry recovered it himself. The teams traded scores for the next seven possessions, with Anunoby putting the Raptors ahead with a catch-and-shoot 3 with less than a minute to go. The Celtics then got the Raptors in rotation and Tatum drove past a Lowry close-out. But Powell, 45th in the league with 3.1 deflections per 36, came out of nowhere to cut him off. When Tatum tried to cross over, Powell got his hands on the dribble . The ball bounced off of Lowry\u2019s leg and right back into the hands of Powell, who drove the length of the floor, drew contact from Smart, and put in a near-impossible layup. His free throw put the Raptors up four. Over their first 11 possessions of the second overtime, the Celtics missed just one shot that came out of their hands cleanly. That was Tatum\u2019s step-back 3 that Siakam contested and Theis rebounded. They made their other seven \u201cclean\u201d shots, but had three misses that the Raptors got their hands on and the Tatum turnover that lead to Powell\u2019s 3-point play. This is what the Raptors do. Their aggressiveness toward the ball has, at times, been their downfall in this series, because Tatum and Walker have been willing to find the open man. Just watch the film from all those corner 3s the Celtics made on Wednesday. But the champs ranked second defensively this season, because that aggressiveness worked in their favor more often than not. It\u2019s most important to stay in front of the guy you\u2019re guarding, but Nurse isn\u2019t going to tell his guys not to use their hands if the ball is there for the taking. \u201cSometimes when you\u2019re smaller,\u201d Nurse said, \u201cthey\u2019ve got these guys that are trying to post you up and shoot over top of you. And once they turn around it\u2019s kinda your last line of defense, because if they get it up, they\u2019re going to be over the top of you.\u201d He laughed and finished, \u201cJust trying to survive sometimes out there, too.\u201d They survived.

A win-or-go home scenario for the reigning champion Toronto Raptors. A win and advance to the Eastern Conference finals for the Boston Celtics. The playoffs tend to bring out emotions, especially when the matchup is as tightly contested as this Eastern Conference semifinal has become. But the emotions overflowed on both sides at the end of Game 6 Wednesday night at HP Field House, where the Raptors saved their season with a wild 125-122 double-overtime win that produced plenty of drama to carry us all to Friday night\u2019s winner-take-all Game 7. >> Game 7: Friday, 9 ET (TNT) Straight answers were hard to come by when it was over. Both benches cleared at the end and both teams met under the basket at the end of the court that led to both locker rooms. Ultimately they were separated without incident, but we know what comes next. Raptors point guard Kyle Lowry exited the building with three \u201cbeautiful\u201d stitches. His Celtics counterpart, Kemba Walker, departed with an ice pack on his left knee and deflated after coming oh so close to moving on. Both teams left having authored an instant playoff classic, complete with the requisite missed opportunities, great plays, finger-pointing, mean-mugging and emotional exhaustion that is sure to stoke the lead up to Game 7. \u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d Walker said when asked what went down after the final buzzer. \u201cI\u2019m being perfectly honest with you, I\u2019m not sure. A little scrum \u2026 I don\u2019t know, it happens.\u201d Lowry walked into the interview room after the game and apologized for being late, due to the need for stitches after taking an inadvertent elbow to the face during the game. But he wasn\u2019t divulging any details on what happened postgame, or the barking that went on between him and Raptors coach Nick Nurse in a timeout huddle late in the second overtime. Lowry appeared to think the timeout was unnecessary with only a half-second left, and the Raptors only needing to inbound the ball. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you are talking about, next question,\u201d Lowry said when asked about the back-and-forth with Nurse. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you are talking about, next question.\u201d Celtics swingman Jaylen Brown didn\u2019t provide any details about the postgame \u201cscrum\u201d but did deliver some pointed commentary about what should and shouldn\u2019t go on, taking direct aim at the Raptors coaching staff. \u201cYou know, a lot of emotions and things like that swirling, etc. I ain\u2019t really gonna speak on it too much,\u201d Brown said before, of course, going on. \u201cBut it\u2019s a lot of emotions going on. It\u2019s an intense series. Things like this tend to happen. It\u2019s a lot of testosterone \u2026 ain\u2019t nothing to worry about. We got to be ready to fight. That\u2019s a respectable organization and I expect them to act accordingly. You know, things seemed to get out of hand at times \u2026 from coaching staffs, etc. Just keep it under control, be ready to play basketball and be ready to fight.\u201d Raptors coach Nick Nurse disagreed with any suggestions that things got out of hand from the bench. \u201cNo,\u201d Nurse said. \u201cWe were just competing.\u201d We\u2019re guaranteed to see more of it Friday night. Lowry said the Raptors are built for this, having grinded their way through all sorts of adversity to win a title last season. The Raptors, he said, are always ready to go at it between the lines. \u201cEvery game is a different game. Every single game is a different game, And every game, every play, every possession in the playoffs is going to be a challenge,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s two versus three, two teams in the same division. They got some young studs that are coming up and we\u2019ve got a team that has been through some battles. We\u2019re just trying to find a way to win the next game on our team.\u201d Walker said the Celtics will be ready as well and took offense to anyone questioning otherwise. Walker was asked why he\u2019s confident the Celtics can finally finish what they started against the Raptors. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I be?\u201d Walker said, \u201cWe have great players and we\u2019re really competitive, That was a hard-fought game right there. We could have given up. We didn\u2019t. We fought hard and made plays throughout the whole game and it took two overtimes. So yeah, I\u2019m confident. We have a good group of guys. We love playing basketball with each other. We love making each other better.

Those qualities helped him become a Hall of Fame player. Now he thinks they can make him a successful coach. Nash was introduced Wednesday by the Brooklyn Nets, who picked him to guide Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving and the rest of a team with high expectations despite him having no coaching experience. \u201cI love to compete. I love to teach, to lead and to be a part of a team. And so to be in a position where I can use all those things on a day-to-day basis and focus all my energy on those tenets is a perfect fit,\u201d Nash said. \u201cSo while I hadn\u2019t necessarily publicly stated my desire to coach, privately it\u2019s always been in my mind, it\u2019s always been an opportunity that suited me. When you can\u2019t run up and down the court anymore, what can you do? What can you contribute?\u201d The Nets believe there is plenty. General manager Sean Marks played with Nash in Phoenix, when the Suns helped usher in an exciting era of high-scoring basketball, and knows how his fearlessness can galvanize an organization. \u201cLook, there\u2019s nobody that I\u2019ve been around that hasn\u2019t wanted to be pressure tested on the spot quite like Steve. He\u2019s never shied away from a moment,\u201d Marks said. \u201cThis guy has never run from anything and he wants the ball in his hands at the end of games and his career spoke for itself. He made the right decision more times than not, so the experience that he\u2019ll bring here speaks volumes.\u201d The two struck up a friendship off the court, talking about life outside of basketball. When Marks was looking for a coach this summer, Nash called and asked if this was the time for him to pursue it. Marks agreed it was, citing Nash\u2019s ability to connect people and drive a culture. And Nash, having played against Durant and Irving and becoming friends with both, is eager to impart his smarts on a roster that has plenty of skills. \u201cThey\u2019re obviously at an incredible point in the history of this organization, so I think the timing is fantastic, the opportunity is fantastic,\u201d Nash said. The hiring was a surprise, with Nash apparently not telling many of his friends within the league of his interest in coaching. And it led to some criticism that he got a coveted opportunity at the top without having to work his way up from the bottom. \u201cWell, I did skip the line, frankly, but at the same time I think leading an NBA team for almost two decades is pretty unique,\u201d Nash said. \u201cSo while I haven\u2019t necessarily learned some of the skills that I\u2019ll definitely seek to understand and learn as far as the technical aspects of coaching, I was never far from that.\u201d There were also a criticism that Black assistants with similar qualifications don\u2019t receive the same opportunities in a league where there are only five Black head coaches. Nash agreed that he has benefited from white privilege in some aspects but not this one. \u201cI\u2019m not sure that this is an example that fits that conversation but I own it and I understand why it\u2019s important to talk about it and that we do need more diversity and more opportunity for African American coaches and staff in all capacities,\u201d Nash said. Nash had worked only as a player development consultant with Golden State, but Marks wasn\u2019t looking for coaching experience. The attributes he sees in Nash go far beyond X\u2019s and O\u2019s. \u201cHis winning past, the way he\u2019s played the game, his family values, and just the curious and creative mind that he has brought to the game over a 20-year career,\u201d Marks said, \u201cand also maybe more importantly than anything the joy with which he played the game and the joy with which he led his teams and his teams played were deciding factors in making Steve Nash the right choice for the Brooklyn Nets.\u201d Brooklyn reached the playoffs even while Irving played only 20 games and Durant missed the entire season while they recovered from injuries. With them back and a number of players growing from the experience they got playing without them, Nash couldn\u2019t ask for many better places to start a new career. \u201cI think the chemistry and culture has been well lauded. We have a roster that is very wealthy, and I mean that from a basketball standpoint,\u201d Nash said. \u201cWe have talent, versatility and good human beings. So as a coach there\u2019s so much to be thankful for when you walk in the doors here. I just can\u2019t wait to get started.\u201d"},{"id":25774,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/lakers-playing-rockets-smallball-hand-successfully","date":"2020-09-10","title":"Rockets force Lakers to go small, might regret the result","content":" Houston\u2019s small-ball style generates the headlines, but the Los Angeles counterattack to it might be playing significantly into the results we\u2019ve seen over the last two games of this Western Conference semifinal series. After the Lakers snatched a 2-1 lead in the series Tuesday night, Rockets coach Mike D\u2019Antoni talked about his team running \u201cout of a little steam,\u201d saying, \u201cI think our legs got a little tired. They upped their stuff.\u201d Perhaps the Los Angeles Lakers\u2019 small-ball lineup of LeBron James, Rajon Rondo, Markieff Morris, Alex Caruso and Kyle Kuzma factored heavily into all of that. \u201cLast game, it was Markieff [Morris], this game it was Rondo,\u201d said James Harden, after scoring 33 in Tuesday\u2019s losing effort. \u201cSo, we\u2019ve just got to make sure that we\u2019re engaged and locked in on the role players.\u201d Given their impact on these last two games, that certainly makes sense. It\u2019s a small sample size, no doubt, but over the last two games the Lakers small-ball lineup of James, Rondo, Morris, Caruso and Kuzma has scored 56 points on 33 possessions, while allowing just 30 points on 31 defensive possessions. Although they\u2019ve played a total of just 16 minutes on the floor together over the last two games, you can\u2019t minimize the group\u2019s impact (169.7 offensive rating, 96.8 defensive rating, 81.8% on defensive rebounds and a true shooting percentage of 93.1) Over the last two games, the Lakers have outscored the Rockets 57-37 in the fourth quarter, limiting Harden to 3-for-7 shooting from the field and just five points in the fourth quarter of each of his last two outings. \u201cWe\u2019re doing a good job, numerically,\u201d said Lakers coach Frank Vogel. \u201cThe thing about James and this team is you\u2019re never comfortable. It doesn\u2019t matter what the score of the game is, what the series looks like. We\u2019re just not gonna be comfortable against a team that has the type of firepower that they have. We\u2019re going to just continue to try to execute our coverage and scheme to try to minimize him and obviously the backside 3\u2019s as much as possible.\u201d So, it comes as no surprise that of the 16 minutes spent on the floor together, that Lakers lineup of James, Rondo, Morris, Caruso and Kuzma has logged half of those minutes solely in the fourth quarter of the last two games, producing impressive numbers. Vogel didn\u2019t deploy that lineup in Game 1. When he did for Game 2, the group shot 87.5% in outscoring the Rockets 35-14. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to play smarter, and harder for longer periods of time,\u201d said Rockets center P.J. Tucker on Wednesday. \u201cObviously, going into the fourth tied up, they made some good shots [in Game 3]. Rondo made some good shots, Kuzma made some good shots. It\u2019s because they got some stops. It\u2019s just how the game goes. It\u2019s been tough all series. \u201cBut for us, we\u2019ve just got to do what we do faster, harder, for a longer amount of time. That\u2019s all that matters. Obviously with the doubles on James, Russ [Westbrook] in the post, we\u2019ve got to be able to get to our spots, be able to make plays, the right plays. Like I said: we do it throughout the game. We\u2019ve just got to do it for longer.\u201d The question is whether that\u2019s possible, given the way D\u2019Antoni splits up Houston\u2019s minutes. Six Rockets \u2014 Harden, Westbrook, Tucker, Robert Covington, Eric Gordon and Jeff Green \u2014 played 35-plus minutes in Game 3. Just two Lakers \u2014 James and Anthony Davis \u2014 logged as many minutes in Game 3. Los Angeles utilized 10 players for Game 3, while Houston played with an eight-man rotation without Danuel House Jr. available due to personal reasons. When House played in Game 2, D\u2019Antoni utilized a nine-man rotation with each of his starters playing at least 33 minutes, compared to just two Lakers logging as many minutes. So, it begs the question of whether Houston possesses the stamina to finish games while leaning so heavily on the starters. D\u2019Antoni was asked before Wednesday\u2019s practice whether fatigue has played a role in Houston\u2019s fourth quarter woes. \u201cWe\u2019re just not getting it done,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said. \u201cThat\u2019s the simple answer. Last night, it was a question of we had five turnovers in the fourth. When it comes to a time to win the game, to be more assertive and more careful with the ball and just will ourselves to a win, we haven\u2019t done that.\u201d Down 2-1 going into Thursday\u2019s Game 4, the Rockets find themselves in familiar territory. In each of the last two postseasons, Houston fought off series deficits against Golden State to tie things up before eventually suffering elimination. Covington returns for Game 4 after going through the concussion protocol Wednesday, the result of suffering a nasty blow to the nose from Anthony Davis in Game 3 that led to him hitting his head on the floor. D\u2019Antoni said, \u201cwe haven\u2019t heard yet,\u201d when asked about House\u2019s availability for Game 4. \u201cWe need to be more aggressive definitely defensively [late in games],\u201d D\u2019Antoni said. \u201cWe\u2019re in the right spots, but we\u2019re not being active in those spots. We need to turn up the heat. That\u2019s what they did after Game 1, where we willed ourselves to good stuff. In Games 2 and 3, they willed their way to better games. We\u2019ve got to match that. Structurally, we\u2019ll tweak some things here and there, how we guard guys. We\u2019ll change that. But overall, it\u2019s a dogfight. Usually, the dog with the most fight is gonna win. We\u2019ve got to be that dog.\u201d Even when the other team is consistently unleashing more dogs. Michael C. Wright is a senior writer for NBA.com.

(AP) \u2014 The NBA\u2019s board of governors and general managers will discuss a plan later this week to push the NBA Draft back to Nov. 18, according to a memo sent to teams Wednesday. In the memo, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press , the league told teams that the Nov. 18 date is based on \u201cinitial conversations with the Players Association.\u201d The board of governors and general managers have meetings scheduled for Thursday and Friday. If it is moved this would be the second time that the Draft \u2014 originally set for June 25, then pushed back to Oct. 16 \u2014 gets delayed. An additional delay would also allow the league more time to conduct the pre-draft process, including a combine in some form, teams were told in the memo. The league also said delaying the draft would allow it more time to continue the process of deciding when best to start next season. Moving the draft would have a domino effect on other offseason league business, such as free agency and the process by which the league and Players Association will determine salary cap numbers for 2020-21 \u2014 something that teams obviously need to know before they can go shopping. The most recent plan had been for free agency to start with negotiations able to begin at 6 p.m. on Oct. 18 and the end of the annual offseason moratorium at noon on Oct. 23. And the NBA had been hoping for a Dec. 1 start to the 2020-21 season, though Commissioner Adam Silver said on the ESPN telecast of the draft lottery last month that date was unlikely. Silver said Dec. 1 \u201cis feeling a little bit early to me.\u201d The league has yet to publicly reveal when next season could start \u2014 or if it could start in a bubble or multiple bubbles. \u201cOur No. 1 goal is to get fans back in our arenas,\u201d Silver said on the draft lottery telecast Aug. 20. \u201cMy sense is, in working with the players association, if we could push back even a little longer and increase the likelihood of having fans in arenas, that\u2019s what we would be targeting.\u201d"},{"id":25734,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/rockets-robert-covington-injured-collision-lakers-anthony-davis","date":"2020-09-09","title":"Report: Robert Covington expected to be available for Game 4","content":" Houston Rockets forward Robert Covington was taken to the locker room after colliding with Los Angeles Lakers center Anthony Davis in the fourth quarter of Game 3 of the teams\u2019 Western Conference playoff series Tuesday night.

But when I hear it, to just know the history of the game, from growing up as a kid watching the NBA playoffs, seeing so many dominant players, so many dominant franchises, seeing who was victorious out there and to know I sit at the top of most wins for any individual is very humbling and something I never dreamed of. > Game 4: Lakers vs. Rockets, Thursday at 7 ET on TNT \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t happen without my teammates over the years, my coaching staffs, everyone from top to bottom \u2014 GMs, owners, training staff, ball boys, everything \u2014 everyone has a hand in it because we\u2019re all a part of the process and success.\u201d Game 3 served as testament to James\u2019 thoughts with Los Angeles leaning on timely contributions from Anthony Davis (26 points) and veteran point guard Rajon Rondo (21 points and nine assists), who carried the Lakers on a personal 8-0 run in the fourth quarter to break open a close game. Rondo\u2019s 21 points registered as his most in the playoffs since May of 2018. With the Lakers up 86-85, Rondo knocked down a 22-footer, and followed up 34 seconds later with another 3-pointer. Rondo stole an errant James Harden pass on the ensuing possession and converted on the other end with a finger roll to put Los Angeles ahead 94-85 shortly before serving up his 1,000th career playoff assist on an Alex Caruso 3-pointer. Rondo said after Game 3 that he doesn\u2019t buy into the \u201cPlayoff Rondo\u201d moniker, but he\u2019s certainly embodied it over the last two games. Lakers coach Frank Vogel expected this all along, despite Rondo missing the team\u2019s seeding games and the first round after undergoing surgery in July on his fractured right thumb. So did James, having faced Rondo in the playoffs on 25 occasions, as well as Davis, who played with the point guard in New Orleans in 2017-18, when the Pelicans swept Portland in the first round. \u201c\u2019Playoff Rondo\u2019 is real,\u201d Davis said. \u201cHis intensity picks up. He wants to guard the best perimeter guy. He wants to facilitate on the floor. He\u2019s shooting the ball very well, making the right passes. We\u2019ve got the two best I.Q. guys in the game with him and LeBron on the floor at the same time, which is tough for defenses. So, \u2018Playoff Rondo\u2019 is real, and he showed up tonight.\u201d Rondo scored 15 points and dished five assists over the final two quarters as the Lakers limited Houston to just 38 second-half points. Davis credits James and Rondo with helping the Lakers make defensive adjustments on the fly, as they did in Game 3. \u201cThey see a lot of things on the floor, then we make adjustments,\u201d Davis said. \u201cWe come in with a game plan, but things happen in the course of a game. \u2026 With at least one [of them] on the floor at all times, it\u2019s easier to make those adjustments. It\u2019s been helpful for me. Those two guys, with that basketball I.Q. on both ends of the floor have been wonderful for us.\u201d Rondo\u2019s experience and knowledge makes him a rarity in today\u2019s NBA, according to James. \u201c[It\u2019s beneficial] when you have enough people you can trust and be in the foxhole with you, not from a basketball aspect, but from a cerebral aspect,\u201d he said. \u201cThe postseason is about making adjustments from game to game, and also being able to make adjustments on the fly because things happen in real time. Being able to see how defenses are playing, seeing how the game is being played, seeing how the flow of the game is being played, there\u2019s just not many guys that can do that in our league. In the postseason, it\u2019s gigantic. Having Do\u2019 on your side definitely helps.\u201d James did most of the heavy lifting in the first half with 29 points that may have prevented a Houston blowout. Harden and Russell Westbrook combined for 38 first-half points as the Rockets shot 56.8% from the field and 42.9% on 3-pointers. Harden finished with 33 points, while Westbrook bounced back from a dismal Game 2 to contribute 30 points on 13-of-24 shooting and 2-of-4 from deep. \u201cWe didn\u2019t play any defense in the first half,\u201d Vogel said. \u201cSo, this easily could\u2019ve been a blowout if [James] wasn\u2019t hitting big shot after big shot.\u201d Big blocks for James came soon after \u2014 four of them, in fact, in the third quarter \u2014 as the 35 year old set a personal playoff milestone for blocks in a quarter. James has eight blocks in this series, but only one of his four blocks in the third quarter led to points. James ran down Austin Rivers (whose father, Doc, was in attendance) for a block that prevented Houston from breaking an 82-82 tie at the third-quarter buzzer. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable,\u201d Vogel said. \u201cWhen he\u2019s protecting the rim on that end of the floor, and then scoring [29] in a half, that\u2019s just remarkable. The lift he gives us with the superhero plays, you can\u2019t really put it in words.\u201d Davis certainly tried to. \u201cIt gives us a spark, his ability to chase guys down on fast breaks, something he\u2019s been doing his whole career,\u201d Davis said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the best guy on your team giving his body up trying to take charges and making big plays on the defensive end. Usually, if he blocks it, he\u2019s running down the floor and he gets upset if we don\u2019t give him the ball for dunks and lobs. So, we try to find him. Then, another spectacular play is coming on the other end.\u201d The last two games appear to be finally wearing on the Rockets. They expressed confidence Monday in the aftermath of Game 2. But Houston coach Mike D\u2019Antoni said after Game 3 that, \u201cI think our legs got a little tired\u201d in the second half, and in the fourth, \u201cI think it\u2019s pretty obvious we just ran out of a little steam.\u201d Houston shot 6-for-20 in the third quarter, 7-for-18 in the fourth and put up 30 3-point attempts \u2014 their fewest since Jan. 22. \u201cWe can\u2019t play into their strengths and the things they love to do,\u201d Harden said. \u201cThat\u2019s halfcourt, slow the pace up, let them get set, let them meet us at the rim, which I think we did, especially in the second half.\u201d Houston\u2019s bench, which has been outscored 83-19 over the last two games, is another growing concern. In the second half of Game 3, Los Angeles\u2019 bench outscored the Rockets\u2019 30-7 as Jeff Green was the only Houston reserve to score in Game 3. Sixth man Danuel House Jr. missed the game for what D\u2019Antoni called \u201cpersonal reasons.\u201d Houston\u2019s reserves could be even thinner for Game 4 if Green is forced to start. Robert Covington left the game with 4:37 left after catching an inadvertent Davis elbow to his nose under the basket. D\u2019Antoni wasn\u2019t certain about Covington\u2019s status and had \u201cno idea\u201d about whether House would play in Game 4. As for James, it\u2019s clear he\u2019s still got plenty of support for a fifth Kia MVP award, even though it appears that hardware this season could go to Giannis Antetokounmpo. \u201cNobody impacts winning more than LeBron James,\u201d Vogel said. \u201cHonestly, it\u2019s probably true in the history of the game that no one has impacted winning more than LeBron James.\u201d Davis, meanwhile, has grown so accustomed to seeing James\u2019 heroics that another career milestone in Game 4 wouldn\u2019t surprise him. \u201cIt seems like he\u2019s drinking from the fountain of youth,\u201d Davis said. \u201cThe things he\u2019s able to do on the floor still: head still touching the rim, still taking big shots, still playing physical is all a testament to his hard work and dedication to taking care of his body. So, I\u2019m pretty sure we\u2019ll see another record being broken on Thursday.\u201d * * * Michael C. Wright is a senior writer for NBA.com.

Yes, the likely (and reigning) Kia Most Valuable Player and the certified KIa Defensive Player of the Year twisted his right ankle in Game 3. But he played through it, only exiting with 16 seconds left in that staggering 40-13 fourth quarter Friday. * Milwaukee at that point essentially was eliminated from the 2020 postseason. While folks around the NBA like to say that Father Time is undefeated, they also know that dropping the first three games of a playoff series is insurmountable. It\u2019s postseason quicksand, claiming all 140 teams that have stepped in it through the years.  * Then Antetokounmpo sprained the ankle again early in the second quarter of Game 4. He spotted his teammates 19 points in his 11 minutes, but they proved plucky enough to take advantage of some Heat complacence and avoid the sweep by winning in overtime. * Then the Bucks\u2019 star got ruled out shortly before Game 5 Tuesday , effectively ending their 2019-20 season against a Miami crew that wasn\u2019t going to make the same mistake twice. Milwaukee ran out of defense in stretches, ran out of buckets in one miserable third-quarter drought and ran out of time. It\u2019s important to keep the sequence of events straight because in the coming months or years, some people may get it mixed up. They might attribute Milwaukee\u2019s unacceptable ouster in five games, by a No. 5 seed, from the semifinals, to Antetokounmpo\u2019s injury and absence from the series finale. They might think that failing in five games somehow is better than four, when in truth it was over in three. They might shift their gaze back to the Bucks\u2019 admirable regular-season record, not just this time (56-17) but from 2018-19 (60-22) too. They might spin all those things forward in an attempt to rationalize the Bucks\u2019 second consecutive playoff failure. And then maybe alibi some more by citing the weird, artificial atmosphere of the Orlando restart campus or the Bucks\u2019 focus on social protest that might not have been a distraction, per se, but clearly added a lot to their playoff plate. To their credit, the players who were asked on their Zoom post-series interviews and coach Mike Budenholzer generally refused to blame the odd setting in which the NBA playoffs are unspooling or the off-court social justice agendas all 22 bubble-invited teams embraced from Day 1. Everybody, winners and losers, have dealt with the same isolated, hunkered-down circumstances. And they all have felt capable of tackling two tasks, playing on the court and speaking out on their media platforms over the past eight weeks. The Bucks could have felt a little extra glare from the spotlight they shined on themselves when they decided not to play Game 5 of their first-round series vs. Orlando on Aug. 26, the day it was scheduled. But the other teams still alive in the playoffs had their backs. The schedule got shifted by three days and basketball returned. It wasn\u2019t as if Milwaukee got inordinately hounded by media attention, either \u2014 the reporters in the bubble remained the same, quarantine rules fending off a sudden rush from TMZ or the networks. So now that we\u2019ve accounted for the timeline and the purging of excuses, the questions remain. * * * Do not underestimate the severity of the Bucks\u2019 swoon. They got to March 1 with a 52-8 record. Then they went 1-4 before the virus lockdown, losing at Miami, at the Lakers, at Phoenix and at Denver. After an interruption of more than 4 1\/2 months \u2014 again, same for everybody \u2014 Milwaukee went 3-5 in the seeding games, got spanked in its playoff opener by the Magic, and wound up at 5-5 in the two rounds as its bubble burst. In all, that\u2019s a 9-14 mark that began well before the restart. None of them had an answer for that lost vim, vigor, mojo or bottom-line results. Homecourt advantage? Yeah, it sure looks as if they needed what was nowhere to be found. The dazzling Fiserv Forum sat vacant back in the Cream City. What is inescapable is that the Bucks need change, and a fair amount of it. An overhaul, not tweaks around the edges like they got last summer. There would be zero satisfaction, and potentially a lethal dose of impatience, if general manager Jon Horst, Budenholzer, his staff and the players tried to run back the same group, same strategies, same results whenever 2020-21 gets here. Posting the best record over the long schedule to again snag the No. 1 seed , then hoping for a different playoff result is a form of hoops insanity. Besides, that\u2019s what this season was all about. The Bucks were two victories away from the 2019 Finals when they lost Game 3 to Toronto in overtime and never got back on track. So that means they\u2019re 5-9 in their last 14 postseason games. Even if the Bucks (like the other 29 teams) won\u2019t have to worry about selling tickets anytime soon, how will they attract eyeballs when fans already have seen this movie \u2026 twice? It isn\u2019t change for its own sake that\u2019s needed. There are weak spots to address, holes to plug, work to be done and mistakes to be erased, if they can be. The decision last offseason to keep Eric Bledsoe over Malcolm Brogdon goes all the way to the top, a financial flinch by co-owners Marc Lasry and Wes Edens that saw the Bucks keeping the wrong guy. Or at least parting with the better player for them. It\u2019s been bad enough to see Bledsoe play poorly in the biggest moments \u2014 after the way he shrank against Boston in 2018 and Toronto last year, his work against Miami should be strike three. If, that is, there is a way to offload the guaranteed $40 million or so left on his contract. What hurts too is that Bledsoe isn\u2019t a shooter (Brogdon is), which is what Milwaukee needs from the point guard it teams with Antetokounmpo. He can be a fireplug defensively (he was named to the league\u2019s All-Defensive second team Tuesday) but that doesn\u2019t outweigh his inefficient and oft-forced offense. Wesley Matthews at the other starting backcourt spot will turn 34 next month and played this season on borrowed time. George Hill, Bledsoe\u2019s backup, already is 34. There\u2019s more center Brook Lopez can give if asked, and Khris Middleton needs to use his play in Antetokounmpo\u2019s absences against the Heat to boost his game to that next proverbial level. Budenholzer\u2019s twice-tried, twice-thwarted system \u2014 based on making 3-point shots over the top of his freakishly versatile penetrator, while counting on opponents to miss theirs \u2014 needs a makeover. His team\u2019s focus on defending the paint coupled with the game-by-game randomness of perimeter shooting earned the Bucks\u2019 their No. 1 defensive ranking again this season. But Miami beat them at their own game, shooting 37.3% from the arc for 75 3-pointers to the Bucks\u2019 32% and 54. The Raptors had turned them inside out that way as well. Relying so heavily on Antetokounmpo \u2014 yet seeing how other players moved and played more aggressively in his absence near the end against the Heat \u2014 suggests there are skills and styles to blend toward better ends, too. No more waiting for Giannis to do it. Look, revamping a system isn\u2019t always an easy thing for a coaching staff, so Budenholzer\u2019s happiness and future in Milwaukee may get bandied about outside and even inside the organization. When four playoff coaches already have gotten dumped \u2014 Indiana\u2019s Nate McMillan, Philadelphia\u2019s Brett Brown, Brooklyn\u2019s Jacque Vaughn (interim) and now Oklahoma City\u2019s Billy Donovan \u2014 it\u2019s important to remember that contracts are guaranteed but jobs are not. As for Antetokounmpo, even he has miles to go, er, lots to improve upon for 2020-21, from his foul shooting and need for a reliable mid-range jump shot to new brakes, new shoes or new moves to cut down on his offensive fouls. That \u201cmiles to go\u201d phrasing might have confused some folks, focused as they might be on Antetokounmpo and the quarter-billion-dollar, five-year \u201csupermax\u201d contract extension he will or will not sign before next season. Even though the Greek Freak has room for growth and definitely can help his teammates more right where he is, that\u2019s not necessarily how this league works. To head off that disaster \u2014 Antetokounmpo deciding he wants out to seek his championship elsewhere \u2014 the Bucks frankly must change around him. However and whatever he wants. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

Jimmy Butler was just being, well \u2026 Jimmy Butler, when he talked about the Miami Heat\u2019s mission in the NBA bubble. He told anyone willing to listen that they were coming north to win it all, not just to deliver a good showing and exit this unprecedented situation with any moral victories. That\u2019s not the Heat way. Who cares that the roster didn\u2019t scream championship, with its mix of seasoned veterans and promising youngsters. Butler saw something in the Heat organization, and the building blocks of this team in particular, when he spurned other recruiting pitches last summer and zeroed in on the hard-hat culture of the championship organization that team president Pat Riley built and coach Erik Spoelstra commands. So they\u2019re halfway to a fourth title now, and halfway to Butler\u2019s stated goal, with Tuesday\u2019s 103-94 win over the No. 1 overall seed Milwaukee Bucks in Game 5 at HP FieldHouse. Butler\u2019s not surprised things have come together so quickly. \u201cNot at all,\u201d said Butler, who led a balanced effort with 17 points, 10 rebounds and six assists. \u201cWe\u2019re a close group, we like being around one another. We\u2019re constantly talking about how we can make each other better. What we see out there on the floor, we\u2019re legit in it to win it. We don\u2019t care about stats, we don\u2019t care about fame. We don\u2019t care about none of that. All that we all care about is winning a championship. And I\u2019m telling you, that\u2019s why we\u2019re playing the style of basketball we\u2019re playing right now.\u201d The Bucks were missing their MVP, Giannis Antetokounmpo, whose sprained right ankle kept him out of what turned out to be the final game for the team with the best regular season record in the league in each of the past two seasons. But the Heat had theirs in Butler, who has led the franchise to its first conference finals since 2014. Back then, LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh were finishing up a wild run of four straight trips to The Finals, including championships in 2012 and 2013. And he doesn\u2019t think this team has come close to playing its best yet. \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Butler said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve played a full 48-minute game yet. And that\u2019s what\u2019s promising, is that if we do lock in and play from start to finish the way that we\u2019re capable of, the way we\u2019re supposed to, I think the game will be a lot easier. It\u2019s yet to happen, but we got to have it happen in the next round.\u201d Those \u201cHeatles\u201d title teams rode the wave of theirsuperstar trio to the top of the NBA mountain. This Butler-led Heat team is in this position, a league-best 8-1 in the postseason, because their superstar trusted the Heat\u2019s culture and the process. Butler also trusted his teammates. That includes veterans like Goran Dragic and Kelly Olynyk, who were already in Miami and played big minutes in the close out of the Bucks, and trade-deadline additions Jae Crowder and three-time champion Andre Iguodala, both of whom delivered handsomely on all that experience Tuesday. They also got important contributions from youngsters Bam Adebayo and Tyler Herro.  Spoelstra knows how tough it is to get here and how special it is. That was particularly true with a team that\u2019s endured its first season together amidst the coronavirus pandemic, the four-month season layoff and restart and the rigors of an unprecedented playoffs in this bubble. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to get to the conference finals and our organization knows that,\u201d Spoelstra said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been trying desperately to get back to the conference finals. That\u2019s not our ultimate goal, we get it. But you could still acknowledge the journey, how hard it is to get to this point. That is why we brought Jimmy Butler here, that is why we put this team together with the veterans, adding Andre and Jae, building around Goran and Bam and adding to the young core. \u201cSo it\u2019s not easy to get to the conference finals, otherwise every team would be doing it. And we\u2019ve been at this for 25 years under the Riley-[Heat owner Mickey] Arison leadership. We\u2019ve tried every single year just to get to this level and it just shows you how competitive this league is. It doesn\u2019t happen every year and we don\u2019t take it for granted. We\u2019re grateful for the opportunity we\u2019ve had.\u201d What looked like a motley crew to the outside world when training camp began was the perfect situation to Butler after stops in Minnesota and Philadelphia the past two season did not agree with his sensibilities about the game. Butler was searching for a like-minded group of players, ones who compete with a chip on their shoulder, ones who were maybe overlooked, counted out or disregarded. He was looking for players like, well \u2026 Jimmy Butler. He was searching for guys like Crowder (16 points in Game 5) and Adebayo (13), Dragic (17) and Herro (14 off the bench, with several huge baskets down the stretch). Guys young and old(er) who would chase greatness the way he would. And they did, running down the Bucks after falling behind by 13 points in the first quarter with a furious 30-9 rally of their own to regain control. \u201cI just came in with a killer mindset,\u201d Herro said. \u201cI wanted to leave everything on the floor for my coaches and teammates. This was one game we needed, we needed one game to move to the next round and I just tried to bring everything I could and leave it out there on the floor. It was ugly but we got the win and that\u2019s all that mattered.\u201d So no, Butler\u2019s not surprised that his team is still playing. The Heat will celebrate this accomplishment \u2014 at least for a night or two per Spoelstra \u2014 before locking in on the conference finals. \u201cIt felt good at the end to obviously win it,\u201d Herro said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to enjoy this tonight and maybe tomorrow a little bit. But then we\u2019ll get back to work, because we\u2019ve still got some unfinished business.\u201d They\u2019re off to the best start for a team seeded fifth or lower since the playoffs were expanded in 1984. That\u2019s news that might even surprise Butler, who is finally getting his first taste of the conference finals. In fact, he probably won\u2019t care. Because in his eyes, the Heat are still only halfway to the ultimate goal. \u201cThis means a lot,\u201d Butler said. \u201cBut that\u2019s not my goal, that\u2019s not my guys\u2019 goal, that\u2019s not the organization\u2019s goal. We want to win it. We want a championship. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on. These next eight [wins] are going to be much harder than the previous eight. We know that. But we\u2019re ready for it.\u201d * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

With Game 6 on Wednesday ( 6:30 p.m. ET, ESPN ), here are three things to know: Serge Ibaka was in a walking boot on Tuesday after suffering a left ankle injury in Game 5. As of late Tuesday night, his status for Game 6 was unknown. \u201cI will see how I wake up [Wednesday], because it\u2019s different,\u201d Ibaka said. \u201cWhen it happened last night, I felt like I could still play. Then today, this morning, it changed a little bit. So let\u2019s see tomorrow when I wake up.\u201d Both Nick Nurse (\u201cI think there\u2019s a good chance\u201d) and Fred VanVleet (\u201cI would be surprised if he wasn\u2019t out there\u201d) expressed confidence that Ibaka will be able to play in Game 6, but only time will tell. And the backup center\u2019s presence is critical, given how the Celtics are defending and given Marc Gasol\u2019s shooting issues. When the Raptors have run high pick-and-roll with their centers, whether the guard has used the screen or rejected it , Ibaka and Gasol have generally been open when they\u2019ve popped to the top of the 3-point arc. \u201cThey\u2019re gonna chase the ball with the big a lot,\u201d Nurse said. \u201c[Daniel] Theis is chasing the ball down the lane a lot, which obviously means your big can either roll or pop and get some kick-backs to him.\u201d Ibaka has been much more willing to take those shots, and he\u2019s 11-for-22 on above-the-break 3s in the series. Gasol, far less willing and far less accurate, is 0-for-10 in about the same number of minutes. He\u2019s been better inside the arc, but had a couple of rough-looking shots at the rim on Monday. Among 81 players with at least 50 field goal attempts in the playoffs, Ibaka (67.9%) ranks third in effective field goal percentage , while Gasol (43.0%) ranks 78th. Nurse acknowledged that, whether Ibaka plays or not, his team needs more from its starting center. \u201cWe don\u2019t need a ton,\u201d the coach said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we need 25 from him. But we need him to chip in with some, just because there\u2019s opportunities there for him. As you well know, we need both him and Pascal [Siakam] to provide some offensive punch for us. That\u2019s when we\u2019re at our best, and we need to be at our best to win a game here.\u201d Siakam, 75th in effective field-goal percentage (44.4%) among those 81 players with at least 50 postseason field-goal attempts, is another story. The Raptors\u2019 leading scorer in the regular season has averaged just 15.8 points on 41% shooting in this series. It was noted after Game 1 how much Siakam\u2019s shooting suffers after the first six seconds of the shot clock. In the regular season, he had an effective field goal percentage of 65.7% in the first six seconds of the clock and just 47.4% in the last 18 seconds of the clock, according to Second Spectrum tracking. That differential (18.3%) was the fifth largest among 86 players with at least 100 field-goal attempts in the first six seconds. Siakam\u2019s 220 shots in the first six seconds were the ninth most in the league and accounted for a little more than 20% of his total field goal attempts. That ratio was about the same (14\/71, 19.7%) in the Raptors\u2019 first-round series against Brooklyn. In this series? Only two of Siakam\u2019s 79 field-goal attempts have come in the first six seconds of the shot clock. And the first of those wasn\u2019t in transition. It was a last-minute, after-timeout iso in Game 2 against Marcus Smart, who stripped him on the way up . (The Raptors were probably looking to iso against Kemba Walker there, but Smart seemingly figured out what they were doing and told Walker to guard OG Anunoby.) The one real transition bucket for Siakam came in the third quarter of Game 4. So the first answer to \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with Pascal Siakam?\u201d is \u201cThe Celtics aren\u2019t letting him run.\u201d Two more issues, which are connected to the lack of transition opportunities, are Siakam\u2019s lack of layups and free throws. In the regular season, 34% of Siakam\u2019s shots came in the restricted area. In the first round, that number was 28% ( 20\/72 ). And in this series, it\u2019s just 19% ( 15\/79 ). He\u2019s made 11 (73%) of those 15 shots, but field goal percentage drops dramatically once you get outside of the restricted area, and Siakam has taken almost twice as many shots elsewhere in the paint (11-for-28) as he has in the restricted area. Tied to that is the lack of trips to the line. In the regular season, Siakam had a free throw rate of 27.4 attempts per 100 shots from the field. In the first round, he upped that to 33.3 per 100. But in this series, Siakam has just 14 free throw attempts with those 79 shots from the field, a rate of 17.7 per 100. Siakam has shot a reasonable 15-for-33 (45%) with Jaylen Brown defending him , but has just two free-throw attempts to go with those 33 shots from the field. He\u2019s shot 17-for-46 (37%) otherwise. Siakam saw a big drop in efficiency with his increase in usage this season. And without transition opportunities or free throws, it\u2019s been an even greater struggle for him to provide what the Raptors need offensively. This has been the ugliest series in these playoffs, with the Celtics and Raptors combining to score just 103.1 points per 100 possessions through five games. But it hasn\u2019t been so ugly on the Celtics end of the floor when Kemba Walker has been in the game. In 186 minutes with Walker on the floor in this series, the Celtics have scored 112.5 points per 100 possessions. In 54 minutes with him off the floor, they\u2019ve scored just 80.2 . Some of that latter number includes garbage time, but even in 45 minutes with Tatum on the floor without Walker, the Celtics have scored just 80 points on 99 possessions . One big difference has been their shooting. From outside the restricted area, the Celtics have shot 40.1% with Walker on the floor and 30.4% with him off the floor . Walker himself has shot 13-for-19 in between the restricted area and the 3-point line. The other big difference has been turnovers. With Walker on the floor, the Celtics have committed 13.5 turnovers per 100 possessions, a tick fewer than they averaged in the regular season (13.7). With Walker off the floor, they\u2019ve committed 25.6 turnovers per 100 possessions . Taking care of the ball has always been one of Walker\u2019s best qualities. The Hornets ranked first or second in turnover percentage in each of his last six seasons in Charlotte. This season, his 8.5 turnovers per 100 possessions used was the sixth lowest rate among 41 players with a usage rate of 25% or higher. In this series, against the team that ranked second in opponent turnover rate and needs to get out and run, Walker\u2019s ability to take care of the ball is even more critical than usual. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

Donovan, who was at the end of his contract, took the Thunder to the playoffs every year and was a finalist for NBA Coach of the Year this season after his squad outperformed expectations and pushed the Houston Rockets to seven games in the first round of the playoffs. Donovan went 243-157 with Oklahoma City. \u201cI have a great respect and admiration for the players I coached in Oklahoma, and I also want to thank the coaches I worked with, who gave unbelievable time and expertise to our common goal,\u201d Donovan said in a statement. The Thunder and Donovan described his departure as a mutual decision. Oklahoma City general manager Sam Presti said he couldn\u2019t give Donovan the assurances he wanted about the future. \u201cIn knowing where he is and the caliber of coach he is, I wouldn\u2019t want to mislead him and tell him it was going to be a certain way and then have it not be that way,\u201d Presti said. \u201cBut ultimately, it was also five years and I think in his mind, it may have been time to move on. I totally respect that and I have a great deal of respect for him. I wish him nothing but the best.\u201d Before his run in Oklahoma City, Donovan led the University of Florida to two national championships and four Final Four appearances in 19 seasons. Donovan inherited All-Stars Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook when he was hired before the 2015-16 season. The Thunder reached the Western Conference finals, where they squandered a 3-1 lead against the Golden State Warriors. Durant left for the Warriors that offseason, shaking the franchise and its fans. But the Thunder bounced back \u2013 Westbrook was the league MVP and set a league record for triple-doubles in a season. It was the first of three straight seasons that Westbrook averaged a triple-double. The Thunder lost to the Rockets in the first round of the playoffs. The Thunder tried to assemble enough stars to compete with Golden State, trading for Paul George and Carmelo Anthony before the 2017-18 season. It didn\u2019t go as planned \u2013 the team went 48-34 and lost to the Utah Jazz in the first round of the playoffs. In 2018-19, the Thunder went 49-33 and George finished third in the MVP balloting. Oklahoma City lost in the first round again when Portland\u2019s Damian Lillard hit a deep game-winning 3-pointer over George in Game 5. Expectations for Oklahoma City were low after the Thunder traded Westbrook to the Houston Rockets for Chris Paul and sent George to the Los Angeles Clippers for Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Danilo Gallinari. Many weren\u2019t sure if Oklahoma City\u2019s new players would function well together \u2013 or if the group would stay together. Instead, Paul was an All-Star, Gilgeous-Alexander emerged as the team\u2019s top scorer and Gallinari had one of the best seasons of his career. The Thunder went 44-28 and nearly knocked off the Rockets in the first round of the playoffs. Presti said he wanted Donovan to return and even lobbied for him to be Coach of the Year. Donovan finished behind Toronto\u2019s Nick Nurse and Milwaukee\u2019s Mike Budenholzer. \u201cWe appreciate him greatly, and I think we were pretty clear about that before the playoffs started,\u201d Presti said. But with the Thunder stockpiling draft picks and Paul\u2019s future with the franchise uncertain, among other things, Presti understood Donovan\u2019s hesitation. \u201cI think he\u2019ll have other opportunities that may be more \u2014 just a little more certainty in terms of what that\u2019s going to look like beyond the next season,\u201d Presti said. \u201cAnd I respect that completely.\u201d"},{"id":25802,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/la-clippers-final-city-approval-build-inglewood-arena","date":"2020-09-09","title":"Clippers get city approval to build Inglewood arena","content":" INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) \u2014 The Los Angeles Clippers have received final approval from Inglewood\u2019s city government to begin construction on their new arena next summer. The Clippers announced the approval from the city council Tuesday, along with a joint deal to buy the publicly owned property on the arena site for $66.25 million. Clippers owner Steve Ballmer is building a privately financed 18,000-seat arena along with a practice facility and corporate offices for his NBA franchise, which has shared Staples Center downtown with the Los Angeles Lakers and the NHL\u2019s Los Angeles Kings since it opened in 1999. Ballmer intends to open his new arena in 2024, immediately following the expiration of his team\u2019s lease at Staples Center. The Clippers plan to break ground on the estimated $1.2 billion project in 2021. The Clippers immediately opened a wait list for season tickets at their new arena. The naming rights to the project currently called the Inglewood Basketball and Entertainment Center are already being shopped worldwide in a partnership with CAA Sports. \u201cToday is a new chapter for the Inglewood Basketball and Entertainment Center, as we move from the land use entitlement process and look toward construction,\u201d Clippers President of Business Operations Gillian Zucker said in a statement. \u201cEvery part of IBEC is being designed with purpose \u2013 with an unapologetic intensity that will define the experience together for players, musical talent and fans alike. This arena will prove, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that there is no replacement for live basketball and entertainment.\u201d Inglewood\u2019s approval was expected for a project that claims it will create 1,500 full-time jobs and $100 million in tax revenue over its first 15 years in business. The only major obstacle to Ballmer\u2019s plans to date has been the Madison Square Garden Company, which owned the venerable Forum just north of the Clippers\u2019 proposed site. MSG sued Inglewood, California Gov. Gavin Newsom and the state Legislature to slow Ballmer\u2019s progress, apparently fearing competition for concerts and other events. Ballmer, the former Microsoft CEO with an estimated net worth of about $75 billion, solved that problem in March by buying the Forum outright for $400 million in cash. He says he will continue to operate the famed home of the 1980s Showtime Lakers as a live music venue. The Clippers\u2019 arena site and the Forum are separated only by SoFi Stadium, the new $5 billion football arena and surrounding development built by Los Angeles Rams owner Stan Kroenke. SoFi Stadium opens Sunday with the Rams\u2019 season opener against the Dallas Cowboys. When the Clippers\u2019 new home is built, four significant arenas \u2013 SoFi Stadium contains a 6,000-seat performance venue in addition to the main football stadium \u2013 will sit one mile apart."},{"id":25772,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/reports-rockets-danuel-house-out-game-3","date":"2020-09-08","title":"Rockets' House out for Game 3 for personal reasons","content":" Rockets forward Danuel House will not be available for Tuesday\u2019s Game 3 against the Lakers, according to The Houston Chronicle\u2019s Jonathan Feigen House played 27 minutes in Game 2, scoring 13 points while adding five rebounds."},{"id":25794,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/giannis-antetokounmpo-game-5-status","date":"2020-09-08","title":"Giannis Antetokounmpo (ankle) out for Game 5 vs. Heat","content":" LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Reigning NBA MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo was ruled out of Game 5 of Milwaukee\u2019s Eastern Conference semifinal series against the Miami Heat because of a sprained right ankle. The Bucks listed Antetokounmpo as inactive, doing so about 45 minutes before Tuesday\u2019s matchup started. They entered the game trailing the best-of-seven series 3-1. Antetokounmpo clearly tried to get himself ready for Game 5. He was on the court about two hours before game time, getting some shots up, then did more strength and flexibility work with a member of the Bucks\u2019 staff. Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer watched the on-court session closely, before the team made the final decision. \u201cIt\u2019s just always good to see it with your eyes,\u201d Budenholzer said. Antetokounmpo sprained the ankle in the first quarter of Game 3, then played his usual minutes the rest of the way. He turned the same ankle the same way \u2014 inward \u2014 early in the second quarter of Game 4 and could not return. The Bucks lost Game 3 with Antetokounmpo, then found a way to win Game 4 in overtime even after playing the final 40 of the game\u2019s 53 minutes without their leading scorer and rebounder. Antetokounmpo had started all 43 of Milwaukee\u2019s postseason games since he joined the franchise as the 15th pick in the 2013 NBA draft. The last time the Bucks played a playoff contest without Antetokounmpo was April 28, 2013 \u2014 when they were swept out of the first round by the Heat. Antetokounmpo got plenty of treatment between games, but Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer indicated Monday \u2014 while acknowledging that there was still hope that the MVP would play in Game 5 \u2014 that the team would weigh the short-term benefit of him playing Tuesday against the long-term risk. \u201cWe have such a great sports and performance staff and just a high, high level of trust that they understand the big picture,\u201d Budenholzer said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been a part of all the decisions in the past and obviously going forward, and the trust level with them, the communication between them and Giannis \u2026 sometimes you have to protect him.\u201d Antetokounmpo is widely expected to win the MVP award for a second consecutive season after averaging 29.5 points, 13.6 rebounds and 5.6 assists. In the opening round of the playoffs against Orlando, he averaged 30.6 points, 16 rebounds and six assists on 59% shooting from the floor and 39% from 3-point range. But in the first three games of the series against the Heat, his offensive numbers cooled off considerably. He averaged 22.7 points, 13.3 rebounds and seven assists \u2014 shooting only 45% from the field and 15% from beyond the 3-point arc. He had 19 points in 11 minutes in Game 4, helping Milwaukee stay in the game early. Antetokounmpo is obviously a huge part of Milwaukee\u2019s plans going forward. It was almost exactly a year ago \u2014 Sept. 12, 2019 \u2014 when the Bucks held a preseason Town Hall meeting for fans, and one of them asked the panel that included Milwaukee general manager Jon Horst what the situation was with Antetokounmpo\u2019s long-term contract. \u201cOf course, he\u2019ll be offered a supermax extension,\u201d Horst said. The Bucks can make that move when free agency begins, possibly as early as mid-October. Such a deal would kick in for the 2021-22 season, and the mathematics before the pandemic hit said it would have been worth around $247 million. If the salary cap going forward takes a hit because of the amount of revenue the league and its teams lost this season, so would the total value of Antetokounmpo\u2019s next deal \u2014 though, by any measure, he\u2019ll be set for life. He\u2019s under contract for $27.5 million next season."},{"id":25813,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/bucks-hope-giannis-antetokounmpo-available-game-5","date":"2020-09-08","title":"Bucks hope Giannis Antetokounmpo can play in Game 5, but won't know until hours before tip","content":" UPDATE:  Giannis ruled out for Game 5  (Sep. 8, 5:45 p.m.) Both are nightmare scenarios, capable of scaring awake even the most seasoned, gnarled basketball coach in the middle of the night, screaming, shaking and calling out for \u201cMama!\u201d So which is worse: Losing your superstar player unexpectedly in the heat of a playoff game and having to adapt and improvise on the fly? Or knowing and dreading for 48 hours that you might not have him at all, well aware that your opponents are preparing accordingly? While Milwaukee\u2019s Giannis Antetokounmpo continued round-the-clock treatment Monday on his sprained right ankle, coach Mike Budenholzer could hedge on his answer only because he and the team thought Antetokounmpo might not even play in Game 4 against Miami Sunday. From that perspective, Antetokounmpo\u2019s 19 points in 11 minutes before he had to leave in the second quarter was all bonus. > Game 5: Tuesday, 6:30 ET on TNT Budenholzer explained that \u201clittle bit of an asterisk\u201d that carried the Bucks through the first nightmare. Antetokounmpo\u2019s availability for Game 5 Tuesday isn\u2019t expected to be known until the hours or minutes before tip. Antetokounmpo arrived at the arena on Tuesday wearing a walking boot. \u201cI would say generally speaking a player going down in a game [is worse],\u201d the coach said. \u201cThe thing that made this one a little bit unique, there was some chance he wasn\u2019t going to play. So there was some thought and preparation put into \u2018What if Giannis didn\u2019t play\u2019 from the tip. \u201cBut if you\u2019re going into a game with a totally healthy player and he is unexpectedly injured, there are things you\u2019ve got to adjust and do on the fly.\u201d To the Bucks\u2019 credit, they did all those things, strategically and emotionally, winning in overtime 118-115 to stave off elimination by sweep. Multiple players, notably Khris Middleton, picked up the slack left by Antetokounmpo\u2019s departure. They got outscored from the foul line and the 3-point arc, yet managed to dominate in the paint without their potent primary trespasser there. The Bucks swiped or pounced on the basketball when it got loose, got many of their preferred shots, took advantage when the Heat relaxed a bit and survived. \u201cDid we put ourselves in a hole? Absolutely,\u201d guard Wesley Matthews told reporters Monday. \u201cAre we gonna be punks about it? Absolutely not.\u201d Now it\u2019s on to Nightmare No. 2: Anticipating an elimination game minus the NBA\u2019s likely repeat Kia Most Valuable Player and its certified Kia Defensive Player of the Year on your side. Against a Miami bunch that has been feistier most of the series, now chapped from letting Game 4 slip away, and no doubt rooting for the Bucks\u2019 possible short-handedness. \u201cWe anticipate him playing, being ready to go, being the player that he is,\u201d Heat veteran Andre Iguodala said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to be able to adjust with him \u2026 and adjust better without him. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to come in with a flat game,\u201d Iguodala also said. \u201cThey\u2019re desperate and they\u2019re going to play like it.\u201d For the record, Antetokounmpo participated in the Bucks\u2019 workout session Monday morning on the Disney campus. Also for the record, the team did nothing strenuous that a guy in a walking boot couldn\u2019t handle. \u201cOn the court, we literally just walked through a couple of defensive things, a couple offensive things, just kind of stationary in the half court,\u201d Budenholzer said. \u201cHe was able to participate in that, but I think it wasn\u2019t much, so don\u2019t read too much into that.\u201d Sliding over into that top player spot again for Milwaukee, if Antetokounmpo is out or plays at less than full health, will be Middleton. Besides his vital numbers \u2014 36 points, eight rebounds, eight assists \u2014 he kept shooting regardless of his percentage (12-of-28) and made many of the Bucks\u2019 offensive decisions to orchestrate the victory. Said Iguodala: \u201cHe has a really strong skill set scoring the ball. Not a particularly quick player but he has a great fast-slow, slow-fast change of speed, which is the hardest to guard. He\u2019s got a really good handle and \u2026 he\u2019s very fluid. More than capable 3-point shooter. And then gets to the mid-range, which is kind of a lost art in the playoffs. But it\u2019s very needed, as we saw.\u201d Middleton\u2019s teammates know he\u2019s not the Greek Freak as far as elite status in the league. Not as overtly competitive, either. (Not in the way Antetokounmpo spit out to a few of them as he lay on the court, cursing and grabbing his ankle, \u201cI should have dunked it!\u201d) But he\u2019s no distant second in their eyes. \u201cHe\u2019s really flourishing,\u201d Matthews said of the Middleton. \u201cHe\u2019s stepping up in a big moment. And not only on the offensive end. \u2026 This is the most vocal I\u2019ve ever seen Khris.\u201d Budenholzer went to a four-guard attack for a while Sunday. Eric Bledsoe had the ball in his hands more without Antetokounmpo around as primary ball handler. And Brook Lopez got more work in the low post, with less need to open lanes for Giannis\u2019 romps through the paint. Those tweaks give Miami new things to think about for Game 5. But most of the heavy-duty thought process will stay with Milwaukee, because playing Antetokounmpo even if he says he\u2019s ready isn\u2019t an easy decision. As Budenholzer said: \u201cSometimes you have to listen to the player, sometimes you have to protect him.\u201d The Bucks coach said the medical staff will have the most input, tasked with weighing the condition of Antetokounmpo\u2019s sprained ankle now against further injury that might come if he risks playing on it. \u201cOrganizationally we have such a great sports performance staff,\u201d Budenholzer said. \u201cJust a high level of trust that they understand the big picture. They\u2019ve been a part of all the decisions in the past, and obviously going forward. The trust level with them, the communication between them and Giannis.\u201d Having Antetokounmpo for Game 5 in a series that might end in five or six games anyway is a bad bargain if it adversely affects the guy Milwaukee hopes to have for the next one or six or 10 seasons. \u201cLooking at everything, assessing everything together, we\u2019ll continue to make decisions that protect and keep Giannis in a position where he\u2019s healthy and has a long, long, healthy career and is still available to us and giving us what he can.\u201d * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

(AP) \u2014 NBA coaches or other team staffers could have guests in the bubble later this month, with the league sharing final plans for such additions with teams on Tuesday. Team staffs would be limited to a total of 10 guests, all of whom would have to begin a self-quarantining period at home immediately, then travel to Central Florida next week to begin another week of even stricter lockdown. Those guests could then enter the so-called bubble at Walt Disney World on Sept. 21, about a week before the scheduled start of the NBA Finals. Coaches have been clamoring for this for some time. Some players were able to bring family into the bubble \u2014 following quarantines and other health certifications \u2014 starting on Aug. 31. NBA referees also had the option of bringing a guest into the bubble, though none did so. \u201cI\u2019ve been involved in those conversations since May,\u201d Boston coach Brad Stevens said. \u201cWe just found out this morning that we have 10 spots. I\u2019ll share my own thoughts privately with the NBA and that\u2019s all I\u2019ll have to say about it.\u201d The league worked with Disney officials as well as health authorities to determine how many people could be safely allowed inside the so-called bubble. The restart began with 22 teams; by next week, only four will remain and the population drop allows room for family members and some others to enter the bubble. Other coaches, such as Denver\u2019s Michael Malone and Miami\u2019s Erik Spoelstra, have spoken out publicly about their hope that the league would allow team staff to have the opportunity to bring family into the bubble. Not everyone felt it was such an important issue; Toronto\u2019s Nick Nurse said earlier this week that he would not have brought his family to Disney if given the chance. The 10-guest limit is per team, and no coach or staff member can bring more than four guests, the NBA said in a memo sent to teams Tuesday, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press . ESPN first reported on the contents of the memo. All guests would have to follow the same protocols as others in the bubble, including daily coronavirus testing, required use of masks and other safety measures. The cost, $550 each day for each guest, would have to be covered by the team or individual staff member. The guests would have to arrive in one group per team on Monday to begin a seven-day, in-room quarantine at a hotel selected by the NBA. There is another option for those who wish to come later, with that arrival date expected to be Sept. 22 \u2014 which would basically get guests into the bubble and out of quarantine just in time for the NBA Finals to start. And as is the case with player guests, including children, none of the staff guests will be able to leave the NBA\u2019s bubble. That means, among other things, they would not be able to visit Disney\u2019s theme parks until their stay in the bubble ends."},{"id":25785,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/draymond-green-shoes-giveaway-saginaw","date":"2020-09-08","title":"Draymond Green to give away hundreds of shoes in hometown","content":" SAGINAW, Mich.

In the 2020 playoffs, he is averaging 15.1, 8.2 rebounds, 1.2 blocks and shooting 57.6% overall and 52.8% on 3-pointers. The early portion of Game 5 was a problem for Toronto. Here\u2019s what the Raptors got out of their first 18 possessions: five points on 2-for-15 shooting, a stretch that included everything from missed open layups to airballed contested jumpers, along with five turnovers in the game\u2019s first 8:53. They were down 18-5 after all that, and it got worse in a hurry. Another big scoring run \u2014 this time, 23-7 \u2014 in the second quarter pushed Boston\u2019s lead from 37-25 to 60-32 late in the half. The Raptors had gone 5-for-6 from the field just before that spurt began and seemed to be getting in a rhythm; they missed 11 of their next 13 shots and things got out of hand. Toronto is 9-10 all-time when facing elimination, as will be the case Wednesday. The Raptors went 1-0 last season in win-or-else games, that being the Game 7 triumph over Philadelphia in the East semifinals.

Or perhaps it was the four-month hiatus due to the coronavirus pandemic that stripped away all the trappings of the strangest NBA regular season on record. Whatever it is, it\u2019s safe to say that there is absolutely no fear factor in these playoffs \u2014 at least not in the conference semifinals. > Game 4: Clippers vs. Nuggets, Wednesday at 9 ET on ESPN Gone are the days of the Golden State Warriors and whatever team LeBron James is on reserving spots in The Finals. This NBA campus has flattened out the competition and given way to a feeling that this is anyone\u2019s Larry O\u2019Brien Trophy, provided you can sustain the energy needed to overcome the obstacles in the way. There\u2019s no homecourt advantage to lean on. The environment that seemed so unfamiliar when teams arrived two months ago required the same adjustment from everyone, no matter your record or status in the league\u2019s pecking order. The regular-season juggernauts \u2014 the Los Angeles Lakers and LA Clippers in the Western Conference and the Milwaukee Bucks and defending-champion Toronto Raptors in the Eastern Conference \u2014 seem like mere mortals here. The Clippers went deep into the fourth quarter chasing the Denver Nuggets to earn their 113-107 comeback Game 3 win Monday night at Advent Health Arena. Their will down the stretch on both ends of the floor proved the difference in them taking a 2-1 series lead as Game 4 looms Wednesday ( 9 ET, ESPN ) . The Clippers closed the second quarter and the game with furious, end-to-end effort. Before halftime, they cut the Nuggets\u2019 lead from 57-46 to 59-57. In the game\u2019s final eight minutes, the Clippers outscored the Nuggets 21-10 as stars Paul George and reigning Finals MVP Kawhi Leonard applied defensive pressure. \u201cBoth ends of the floor, Paul really exerted himself and really took a leadership role in this game,\u201d Clippers guard Lou Williams said. \u201cI think a lot of our guys decided in the fourth quarter the we just didn\u2019t want to lose this game. We didn\u2019t want to have that feeling, especially after the type of game we had the last game. And I thought Paul was the head of the snake on both ends of the floor just really being aggressive for us.\u201d The Clippers are the only higher seed still playing with a lead in their series. The Bucks and Raptors are both facing elimination games, while the Lakers are tied 1-1 with the Houston Rockets. The Clippers, still smarting from getting clocked by the Nuggets in Game 2, were not interested in enduring similar stress. \u201cWe felt it, I \u2019 m sure you guys saw it,\u201d George said. \u201cWe were not going to be the team that lost tonight.\u201d Closing Game 3 with smothering defense and timely plays is the sort of comprehensive effort needed to survive and advance in this playoff atmosphere. Game 3 was a showcase of what the Clippers have to offer when they\u2019re locked in. There was George\u2019s team-high 32 points and air-tight defense on Nuggets star Jamal Murray all game long. Leonard had 23 points, 14 rebounds, six assists and a wicked middle fingertip block on a Murray dunk attempt at the rim. Patrick Beverley had clutch steals and Williams had clutch baskets (his driving lay with 2:04 to play gave the Clippers a 109-103 lead). \u201cIt was all of our defense down the stretch,\u201d Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. \u201cThe game came down to one of the two teams was going to play some defense. And for three and half quarters, both teams were basically scoring. And then the last six minutes it was our defense. I thought that play by Kawhi was amazing. \u2026 We had our lapses, there\u2019s no doubt about that. But when we locked in, we were pretty good.\u201d The Clippers haven\u2019t lost back-to-back games since mid-February and have won four of their last five games. That includes two straight wins to eliminate the Dallas Mavericks in the first round and two of three against a potent Denver squad. \u201cWe held a team to 107 points, one of the best offenses in the league,\u201d Beverley said, \u201cso I would say that was good defense. Overall, I would say we did what we needed to do. Got key stops when we needed to get key stops. Got key rebounds when we needed to get key rebounds. Give Denver a lot of credit, coming from a seven-game series. The type of play they came out here with, energetic, you got to give them a lot of credit.\u201d Just don\u2019t put them on the Clippers\u2019 level, not yet. They aren\u2019t playing with the same pressure. These Clippers are well aware of the expectations, both internal and external, they brought with them to Orlando. The burden of playing up to those sky-high expectations, however, has proved difficult. Rivers knows his team is still finding its way. Leonard and George are still negotiating their 1-2 superstar dynamic. The full roster has been available for just 14 games. This team is still a work in progress \u2014 even this late in the season. But when they turned the intensity up down the stretch, the difference between Denver and LA was hard to miss. Playing like that consistently remains the challenge. \u201cIt\u2019s basketball,\u201d George said. \u201cWe\u2019re not a perfect team by any means. This game is made on stretches. One team gets hot and gets going. The other team rallies back. But this game is always predicted on whoever plays defense first wins. And I thought we incorporated that and put this game away.\u201d T he Nuggets walked away from Game 3 feeling like they let the Clippers off the hook (as opposed to the Clippers stopping them). That fear factor, even after being manhandled down the stretch, isn\u2019t there. \u201cThey\u2019re talented,\u201d Jokic said. \u201cThey\u2019re favorite on paper and everything, have maybe better starting unit, more players, whatever. Coach, whatever. But we can fight. We can give ourselves a chance to win the game, like we did in the last two games. Today, we didn\u2019t close well \u2026 the effort just needs to be there to give ourselves a chance to win a game.\u201d * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

The LA Clippers (second on offense, fifth on defense) were one of those two teams. And in theory, the Clippers have been title favorites since almost half of the league\u2019s GMs picked them 11 months ago . In practice, they\u2019ve looked the part only sporadically. The Boston Celtics didn\u2019t enter the season with nearly the same expectations, in part because they parted ways with five of the top eight players from last year\u2019s rotation. But it didn\u2019t take them long to establish themselves as one of the best teams in the Eastern Conference again, winning 25 of their first 33 games. They ranked fourth on both ends of the floor, maybe the most complete team in the East, with their efficiency off the dribble and their defensive versatility seemingly made for the postseason. > Game 6: Raptors vs. Celtics, Wednesday at 6:30 ET on ESPN It all came together in Game 5 of the Celtics\u2019 Eastern Conference semifinals series against the Toronto Raptors, though it took a while for one end of the floor to catch up with the other. With suffocating defense in the first quarter and potent offense in the second, the Celtics built a 27-point halftime lead and cruised to a buzzer-to-buzzer, 111-89 victory . They lead the series 3-2 with Game 6 on Wednesday ( 6:30 p.m. ET, ESPN ). Toronto\u2019s second-ranked defense set the bar in Game 4 on Saturday. Two nights later, the Celtics\u2019 set a new standard by holding the defending champs to just five points on their first 17 possessions. Possession No. 15 was most emblematic of that stretch\u2026 It started with a Kemba Walker turning the ball over in the paint. Good defense, especially against the Raptors, starts in transition. And even though the ball was loose off OG Anunoby\u2019s deflection, the Celtics immediately got back, preventing a Toronto fast break before it could even start. When Marcus Smart \u201ciced\u201d Kyle Lowry (keeping him away from the middle of the floor), Daniel Theis wasn\u2019t immediately in the right position. But he got there quickly enough to cut off Lowry\u2019s drive, and when Lowry tried to isolate the mismatch, Theis shut him down twice. In between, Walker stayed in front of a Norman Powell drive. The 24-second violation was one of four turnovers in a five-possession stretch for Toronto that allowed the Celtics to build a double-digit lead. Walker played a big role in two of the other three, getting around a screen and back in front of Fred VanVleet, and then drawing a charge from Powell in transition. Walker will always be a target of opposing offenses. But that\u2019s more about his size and how good the rest of his team is defensively, and less about his effort or awareness on that end of the floor. This was not the first (or second or third) top-10 defense he\u2019s been a part of. \u201cI\u2019m just playing hard,\u201d Walker said. \u201cMy job (defensively) is to play pick-and-roll defense as best as I could, get back in front of the basketball, and sacrifice my body when I\u2019m able to. That\u2019s it.\u201d The Celtics have defended the league\u2019s best offenses well all season. The Raptors were not one of the league\u2019s best offenses, and they were not at their best on Monday. Lowry didn\u2019t have quite the same downhill push as he had in Game 3 , Marc Gasol couldn\u2019t make a layup, and Pascal Siakam remains unable to grab on to the role of leading man. But Game 5 was more an exhibition of just how good Boston can be defensively. \u201cWe were really active,\u201d Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. \u201cWe were really just trying to play hard, as hard as we could. They missed a couple of shots. We missed some shots in the first quarter but we were playing with great purpose. You could feel that from the get go. So you just hope that you would knock enough (shots) in to kind of get something going and we did.\u201d They really didn\u2019t get something going offensively until late in the first quarter, right at the end of that stretch where they forced four Toronto turnovers. Amazingly, after scoring just 14 points on their first 16 possessions, the Celtics broke through against a Toronto zone that had them somewhat flummoxed all series. And they did it with what should be the worst offensive lineup (no Walker or Jayson Tatum) they could put on the floor. But that lineup overloaded the left side of the floor and Brad Wanamaker blew by an Anunoby close out, drew help, and dropped the ball off for Theis, who was superkicked by Siakam . After he made the free throws, Theis blocked a Powell drive, sparking a transition sequence them finished with a monstrous dunk from Jaylen Brown. Eleven points on seven possessions late in that first quarter wasn\u2019t an explosion, but it was a breakthrough in what has been the ugliest offensive series of these playoffs. The explosion came in the second quarter , when the Celtics scored 37 points on 25 possessions, shooting 13-for-20 from the field. Smart , Tatum and Wanamaker took turns driving around Siakam, and Boston was just quicker than a Toronto defense that was so locked in just two nights earlier. \u201cI think we got a lot of movement,\u201d Walker said of his team\u2019s best offensive performance of the series. \u201cWe penetrated and whenever we drew two defenders, we made the right play, made the right pass. They closed out and we drove the basketball and made the right pass again and just got the better shot. That\u2019s what it was.\u201d Brown (27 points on 10-for-18 shooting) led six Celtics in double-figures. As was the case in Game 1, when the Raptors couldn\u2019t score early, they couldn\u2019t keep up. \u201cThey looked faster, stronger and hungrier than we did,\u201d Raptors coach Nick Nurse said. \u201cI thought we had great shots in the first quarter and we get 11 points. And somehow, that really disheartens us against this team.\u201d The Raps are the defending champs, and they\u2019ll surely come with more energy with their season on the line in Game 6 on Wednesday. But to take this series to the limit, they\u2019ll have to win ugly. Given their offensive issues, the champs probably can\u2019t put together a complete performance like we just saw from the Celtics. \u201cThey outplayed us pretty much in every facet of the game,\u201d Fred VanVleet said. \u201cThey were quicker to the ball, they were playing with more force and pace, and as a result you saw the start that they were able to get out to. [It] kind of put ourselves in a hole and we were fighting uphill after that.\u201d Fighting uphill and now one game from elimination against a team that looked every bit of a championship contender on Monday. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

So, naturally, Russell Westbrook paid a visit to James Harden\u2019s suite. \u201cWe were just talking about basketball and ways we can be better,\u201d Harden said. \u201cWe hold each other accountable. That\u2019s the kind of weight that we have on our shoulders. So, communication, talking and figuring things out, ways I can help him, ways he can help me and then ways we can help our team as a collective.\u201d > Game 3: Lakers vs. Rockets, Tuesday at 9 ET on TNT The Rockets certainly didn\u2019t do that in helping the Los Angeles Lakers even the series at 1-1 with 17 turnovers turned into 27 points in a game decided by single digits. Houston even overcame a 21-point deficit to lead by four with just three seconds left in the third quarter. So, maybe that\u2019s why Houston enters Tuesday\u2019s Game 3 with confidence that Harden described as \u201cskyrocketing.\u201d \u201cI think each individual player on our team is in a good space, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re gonna need,\u201d Harden said. \u201cWe\u2019re excited. We\u2019re more confident. I think last night, even though we lost, we\u2019re even more confident that we have a chance because we didn\u2019t play well, and we let some of their players and role players get off, or make shots, or get opportunities to score, which we can control.\u201d Harden believes that all starts with he and Westbrook. The star guard duo combined to commit 12 of the team\u2019s 17 giveaways, with the Lakers producing 20 of their 27 points off turnovers in transition. Westbrook scored just two points, shooting 1-for-8 from the field while committing four first-half turnovers that helped the Lakers build their 21-point lead. Still, the Rockets made the game competitive despite all the mistakes and their point guard serving more turnovers than assists while contributing just 10 points on 4-of-15 shooting. Westbrook owned up to his part in Sunday\u2019s loss, saying he\u2019ll be \u201cready to go\u201d for Game 3. Rockets coach Mike D\u2019Antoni simply wants Westbrook to \u201cjust be himself.\u201d That version of Westbrook attacked the paint in the regular season when teams deployed zones, traps and double teams in an attempt to neutralize Harden. It\u2019s not an accident that Westbrook averaged nearly a triple double (27.2 points, 7.9 rebounds and 7.0 assists) before Houston entered the Walt Disney World campus. D\u2019Antoni called zone defenses \u201ca desperation thing,\u201d adding that \u201cI\u2019m not a big believer in it. I think offensively, we should kill it. We didn\u2019t last night. But we\u2019ll do a better job against it next time.\u201d They should, given the frequency at which teams have deployed exotic tactics this season to slow Harden. The Rockets have seen just about every look an opponent can throw their way. So they know how to attack them, a point D\u2019Antoni made sure to mention Monday on a Zoom chat before the team\u2019s workout. \u201cIf you look at the game, we did it then,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said. \u201cWe were down [21], then we we\u2019re up five in a blink while we\u2019re doing it right. Then, we just made some decisions that weren\u2019t great. It happens. Nobody tries to do that. But we know how to attack it. Will we be more prepared? We hope. We showed them [during a film session] examples of when we did it right, it was great. When we did it wrong, it was bad. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of trying to make those decisions on the run. Our spacing could be better. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s 20 times that they trapped, 10 times we did it really well, and then 10 times we didn\u2019t. It was mostly the same mistakes. So, hopefully we\u2019ve addressed that, and we\u2019ll be able to do a better job with it.\u201d Despite the Game 2 win, the Lakers see areas in need of improvement, too. With Los Angeles devoting so much into shutting down Harden and Westbrook, Rockets guard Eric Gordon has slithered through the cracks in two straight games. Gordon scored 23 points in Game 1 before reeling off 24 in Game 2, and he\u2019s shooting 45% from deep in this series. What\u2019s more, many of his shots from 3-point range in the series have been wide open , and he\u2019s knocking down 56.3% of those attempts. P.J. Tucker (4-for-7 on 3-pointers in Game 2), Robert Covington (4-for-8) and Danuel House Jr. (3-for-7) have also had their moments. \u201cI\u2019m gonna rely on my Hall of Fame point guard and my Hall of Fame combo guard to set me up in position to break that,\u201d House said. \u201cI just want to do the easy part for the team: shoot, make the right reads, and just play the right way.\u201d With Houston\u2019s shooters spread out so far on the floor, the Lakers understand they\u2019ve got to cover plenty of ground to account for Houston\u2019s supporting cast when they attempt to load up on Harden. Lakers coach Frank Vogel said his team typically goes into a game with a plan for their various defensive coverages and an idea of the best points to utilize them. \u201cYour margin for error is small,\u201d Vogel said. \u201cIf you make mistakes against this [offense] you could be giving up a 3. You saw in the third quarter [of Game 2] they can hit them in bunches. You make up for it with communication, energy and using your hands. Getting your hands in the passing lanes shrinks the floor. \u201cThere definitely is a smaller margin of error when you have the space around elite playmakers like they have. I really loved the energy of our defense [in Game 2]. Our guys really bought into what our plan was, and the many ways we kind of mixed our pitches with their great players. Giving them different looks is an important part of how we play these games.\u201d The Rockets certainly expect them. Harden replied \u201cof course,\u201d when asked whether the Rockets sense desperation when an opponent resorts to utilizing zones, traps and double teams to stop him. \u201cWe\u2019re so good, man, that teams have got to throw in traps or throw in zones or whatnot,\u201d he said. \u201cThe zone or trap, it kind of gets us more excited because we\u2019re gonna have more shot opportunities. Guys that are around me and Russ are gonna have more shot opportunities, more opportunities to keep going offensively. That\u2019s what we want because, offensively, me and Russ are able to get any shot we want to at any time. \u201cWe\u2019ve just got to do a better job, especially me and Russell and the ballhandlers of getting those shots, getting those possessions where we don\u2019t give the Lakers opportunities to get out in transition because that\u2019s what they\u2019re really good at. So, we watched film on the traps, the zones and things like that, ways that we can attack it. Tomorrow, we\u2019ll be better prepared.\u201d As will the Lakers, according to Kyle Kuzma, who leads a bench unit that has outscored Houston\u2019s reserves 74-30 so far this series. The Rockets are now 3-1 against the Lakers this season since going all-in on small ball. \u201cSome guys, we need to double at some point,\u201d Kuzma explained. \u201cYou just have to have that awareness on the floor of where the shooters are, and how to close out soon whether you need to force them left, you need to force them right, you need a hot close, short close. It\u2019s all about just knowing your personnel, and then having that awareness on the court.\u201d * * * Michael C. Wright is a senior writer for NBA.com.

Antetokounmpo missed most of Game 4 after aggravating the injury. He scored 19 points early, then watched the rest of the way from the locker room. > Game 5: Heat vs. Bucks, Tuesday at 6:30 ET on TNT But the Bucks kept their season alive anyway, winning 118-115 in overtime to cut Miami\u2019s series lead to 3-1.

We had to have his back tonight.\u201d Antetokounmpo was driving to the basket with 10:18 left in the second quarter, trying to get past Miami\u2019s Andre Iguodala. He went down and screamed in pain as he grabbed at the ankle, and it didn\u2019t take long for most of those on the Bucks\u2019 bench to gather around him in concern. Antetokounmpo eventually went to the bench, then went back onto the court to shoot his free throws. He had to take them to have any chance of being able to return to the game, per NBA rules. In the end, it didn\u2019t matter: The Bucks announced at halftime that Antetokounmpo would not return to the game. He was 8 for 10 from the field when he limped off, after scoring 19 of Milwaukee\u2019s first 30 points and being the only Bucks player able to manufacture much of anything against Miami in the early going. Antetokounmpo was with the team on Monday and reportedly wore a boot on his ankle, which is standard for the injury. His status for Game 5 remains undetermined. \u201cYou feel for Giannis,\u201d Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. \u201cI hope it\u2019s not lost what he did in those first 10 or 12 minutes on an ankle that\u2019s not fully 100%. He was phenomenal to start the game and gave us a huge boost. I think they threw a big punch early and Giannis was able to keep us afloat.\u201d Antetokounmpo originally turned the ankle inward on a drive in the first quarter of Game 3 of the series on Friday night. He finished with 21 points, 16 rebounds and nine assists in 35 minutes, but he shot just 7 for 21 from the field and missed all seven of his 3-point tries. Antetokounmpo insisted after Game 3 that the ankle did not bother him during the game. He is widely expected to win the MVP award for a second consecutive season after averaging 29.5 points, 13.6 rebounds and 5.6 assists. In the opening round of the playoffs against Orlando, Antetokounmpo averaged 30.6 points, 16 rebounds and six assists on 59% shooting from the floor and 39% from 3-point range. But in the first three games of the series against the Heat, his offensive numbers cooled off considerably. He averaged 22.7 points, 13.3 rebounds and seven assists \u2014 shooting only 45% from the field and 15% from beyond the 3-point arc."},{"id":25814,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/lakers-rockets-game-2-analysis","date":"2020-09-07","title":"3 takeaways from Lakers' series-leveling Game 2 win over Rockets","content":" Houston huddled in the tunnel before tip-off and discussed the importance of throwing the first punch, only to be walloped 117-109 on Sunday by a Los Angeles Lakers squad now acclimated to the Rockets\u2019 speed-borne surprise from Game 1. \u201cLike I said after Game 1: sometimes you need one game to be able to understand the speed they played with,\u201d Lakers star LeBron James said. \u201cEveryone keeps talking about small ball, but their speed, their activity defensively and offensively is something that can catch you off guard in a Game 1 situation.

Still, Los Angeles managed to hold on with James and Davis combining for 14 of the Lakers\u2019 27 points in the fourth quarter, while the reserves outscored Houston\u2019s bench 10-0. \u201cOur mindset going into the fourth quarter was we had some breakdowns getting to shooters, things we could tighten up and do better,\u201d Lakers coach Frank Vogel said. \u201cWe understand this team has the ability to make five, six, seven 3s in a row and go on big runs like they did in the third quarter and not overreact to that; to stay the course with what was working in the first half. We did that.\u201d The Game 2 victory moved James into a first-place tie with former Lakers great Derek Fisher for the most playoff wins (161) in NBA history, and he also moved into second place all-time in playoff 3-pointers (386). The Lakers shot 56.6% from the field to move to 31-0 this season when they shoot 50% or better. Most importantly, the Lakers feel like they\u2019ve solved the mystery of Houston\u2019s blazing small-ball speed. \u201cWe understand how much every possession, how much scrambling, how much running, how much pace, how physical the game is going to be against this team because they\u2019re extremely good, no matter who\u2019s out on the floor,\u201d James said. Here are three takeaways from Sunday\u2019s game: You can attribute some of Houston\u2019s issues in the first half to Westbrook\u2019s play, as he scored just two points on 1-of-8 shooting and 0-for-3 from 3-point range in addition to committing half of the Rockets\u2019 eight turnovers that Los Angeles turned into 17 points. Westbrook finished the game with just 10 points on 4-of-15 shooting, with a game-high seven turnovers to go with four assists. It\u2019s important to note that for the game, Los Angeles scored 27 points off Houston\u2019s 17 turnovers. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Right now, I feel like I\u2019m just running around,\u201d Westbrook said, when asked about helping out James Harden when he\u2019s trapped out on the wing. \u201cSo, I\u2019ve got to look at film and figure out how to be effective. Some of it is my fault, some are missed calls. But it\u2019s on me. I don\u2019t point fingers at anybody else [about] my own game. I own my mistakes. I own what I do, and that\u2019s that.\u201d The Lakers outscored Houston by 14 points in Westbrook\u2019s 33 minutes on the floor, which registered as the worst plus-minus among Rockets starters. Behind Harden, Westbrook is the team\u2019s second-leading scorer. But Eric Gordon (24 points) filled that role for Game 2, while Harden produced a team-high 27 points. Houston coach Mike D\u2019Antoni expressed confidence in a Westbrook rebound for Game 3. Despite Westbrook\u2019s struggles, Houston still outscored Los Angeles 41-23 in the third quarter. Those 41 points rank as the most the Lakers have surrendered thus far in the postseason. \u201cWe\u2019re not gonna win anything without Russell,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said. \u201cThat\u2019s not even a question on when he\u2019s gonna work through it. He\u2019s fine. He\u2019s more upset than anybody. He\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019m not worried about him. He\u2019s still working his way back, and he\u2019ll play with great intensity. He\u2019ll always be aggressive. He needs to be aggressive. That\u2019s why he\u2019s Russell Westbrook. He\u2019ll work it out.\u201d  Playing in just his second game since before the NBA suspended the season back in March due to the coronavirus pandemic, Rondo shook off a shaky Game 1 performance with a vintage night. The Lakers outscored the Rockets by 28 points in the 29 minutes Rondo played, as he produced 10 points on 4-of-9 shooting with nine assists and a team-high five steals. Vogel described Rondo\u2019s impact as virtually immeasurable. \u201cHis impact on our team is measured in swag,\u201d Vogel said. \u201cJust the confidence that he brings to our group, you saw that. Game 1 was his first game in six months or something like that. So, you have to forgive a little bit of rust. He was a plus-28 tonight, took the assignment of guarding James [Harden], guarding Russ [Westbrook] at certain times, and wreaked havoc defensively for us both on the ball and in helping us mix coverages. Just a great Rondo performance.\u201d Rondo scored eight points to go with four assists, three rebounds, a pair of steals and a block in Game 1. Before that outing, Rondo hadn\u2019t played the entire time the Lakers have been in the bubble after undergoing surgery in July to repair a fractured right thumb. Rondo missed time again in the opening round of the playoffs due to back spasms. \u201cHe was just extremely aggressive,\u201d James said. \u201cNot just offensively, but defensively taking the challenge on James [Harden], taking the challenge of whomever he was guarding, just trying to lead. That\u2019s what [Rondo] is: he\u2019s a leader. For us to have him back in the postseason, it\u2019s a key for our team. He comes in, he pushes the tempo, he gets guys involved. It doesn\u2019t always show up in the stat sheet with [Rondo], the intangibles that he does offensively and defensively. His nose is always around the ball, and he just makes plays for us.\u201d Earlier, we mentioned Los Angeles\u2019 bench outscoring the Rockets\u2019 reserves 10-0 in the fourth quarter, but we\u2019d be remiss to not discuss the group\u2019s impact on the entire game.  Just two Lakers bench players \u2014 Kyle Kuzma (13 points) and Markieff Morris (16 points) \u2014 either matched or surpassed the production of Houston\u2019s reserves. The Lakers bench outscored Houston\u2019s reserves 41-13, in addition to contributing seven steals. That made for a difficult night for Houston, as its starters combined for 96 of its 109 points. Morris inflicted the majority of his damage right out the gates with 12 points on 4-of-4 shooting from 3-point range, as Los Angeles finished the first quarter leading 36-20. \u201cWe built this team to be able to play in different ways; to be able to play big versus teams, be able to play small, to be able to play in between,\u201d James said. \u201cWe built that from the beginning and we\u2019ve always had that in our toolbox. Tonight was an example of that, being able to go to that. Smooth (Morris) was spectacular off the bench giving us that instant offense. He was unbelievable for us. Doe (Rondo), A.C. (Alex Caruso), Kuz (Kyle Kuzma), those guys came in and gave us a big boost.\u201d Morris\u2019 big night took away minutes from Los Angeles\u2019 big men. Vogel made it a point to mention the Lakers haven\u2019t abandoned their centers this series. \u201cOur centers are still gonna have a role in this series,\u201d he said. \u201cThe plan was to go with Dwight [Howard] as well. We\u2019ve been working with those guys in terms of how to play against this team, which is unique. But we went on a heck of a run toward the end of the first with Markieff at the five. It\u2019s just how the game played out. Sometimes, you\u2019ve got to ride that hot hand with the hot lineup. The plan was to play JaVale [McGee] and Dwight [Howard[, but we obviously audibled at that point.\u201d * * * Michael C. Wright is a senior writer for NBA.com.

Lakers coach Frank Vogel said the veteran big man, who is averaging 4.9 points, 4.7 rebounds and 1.1 blocks in the playoffs, is set to undergo an MRI on Monday. Without McGee, the Lakers opted to play Anthony Davis at center for the majority of their 117-109 win over Houston.

Waiters, who signed with L.A. as a free agent in March, has played just 38 total minutes in five postseason appearances and shot 4-for-12 in that time.

The Celtics were half a second from taking a 3-0 lead, but we now have a 2-2 series with a pivotal Game 5 on Monday ( 6:30 p.m. ET, TNT ). With a spot in the conference finals coming down to three games, here are three things to know about what we\u2019ve seen so far \u2026 The Raptors seemingly had a depth advantage coming into this series with Gordon Hayward out, Marcus Smart in Boston\u2019s starting lineup, and legit questions about everybody left on the Celtics\u2019 bench. The Raptors had *the NBA\u2019s best bench in the regular season. And then they had the best bench in the first round of the playoffs, outscoring **the Brooklyn Nets by 72 points (28.4 per 100 possessions) in 116 minutes with Norman Powell and\/or Serge Ibaka on the floor. * According to aggregate (estimated) bench NetRtg. ** Necessary context: Brooklyn\u2019s depleted bench was pretty terrible. But through the first two games of this series, Toronto was a minus-20 in Powell and Ibaka\u2019s 32 minutes together. With Celtics back-up center Robert Williams III shooting 10-for-10, Boston was winning the bench minutes. Through those first two games, the Raptors were a minus-1 in 64 minutes with Fred VanVleet and Kyle Lowry on the floor together and, incredibly, a minus-30 in 17 minutes with VanVleet on the floor without Lowry. The solution was simply to not let Lowry rest. The 34-year-old point guard played 46:29 in Game 3 and then 43:47 in Game 4. He\u2019s not the only Raptor whose minutes have been extended. Pascal Siakam has actually played the entire second half in each of the last three games . OG Anunoby played the entire second half of Game 3 (capping it with his only three points of those 24 minutes), and VanVleet played the entire second half of Game 4. > Game 5: Celtics vs. Raptors, Monday at 6:30 ET on TNT The Raptors\u2019 starters have been pretty good. After getting outscored in Game 1, the Toronto starting lineup is a plus-24 in 62 minutes over the last three games. That breaks down to a plus-30 in 37 minutes against the Boston starting lineup and a minus-6 in 25 minutes otherwise. Celtics coach Brad Stevens subbed Williams in for Daniel Theis just 2 1\/2 minutes into Game 4, seemingly preferring the Williams match up vs. Marc Gasol. After playing 13 of his 50 minutes against Gasol through the first three games, Williams played 12 of his 15 minutes against Gasol in Game 4. For the series, Boston is a plus-10 with the Time Lord vs. Big Spain matchup, and we could see more of it going forward. That Toronto advantage with the starters has shown up more in the third quarter than in the first. While they\u2019ve been outscored by 39 points otherwise, the Raptors are a plus-26 , having scored 129.8 points per 100 possessions , in the third period. Siakam has almost as many buckets in the third quarter (when he\u2019s 13-for-25 ) than he does in the other three periods combined (14-for-45). Anunoby is 8-for-10 in the third , Ibaka has made all four of his third-quarter 3-point attempts, and the Raptors have scored at least 125 points per 100 possessions in all four third quarters . The second quarter, meanwhile, has been brutal \u2026 on both ends of the floor. Both teams have scored less than a point per possession in all four second quarters of the series. The cumulative score in 48 second-quarter minutes is Celtics 88, Raptors 76. This has been the least efficient of the four conference semifinals series. Through Sunday, the Celtics (104.6 points per 100 possessions) and Raptors (101.0) rank seventh and eighth in offensive efficiency in this round. The Toronto offense has improved since the first two games , while the Boston offense had its worst game of the playoffs on Saturday, with the Raptors\u2019 defense playing a not-insignificant role in the Celtics shooting 7-for-35 from 3-point range. It seems unlikely that either team is going to bust out with a huge offensive performance in Game 5. Maybe one could at least score a point per possession in the second quarter, though. The Raptors played the third-most zone in the regular season, according to Synergy play-type tracking. And they\u2019ve played more than twice as much zone in this series as they did in the first round against Brooklyn. The champs have played zone on 55 (14%) of Boston\u2019s offensive possessions. There have been a few possessions of a triangle-and-two zone, and in the fourth quarter of Game 4, we saw a few possessions of a box-and-one. But for the most part, the Raptors have employed a 2-3 or 2-1-2 zone. And through four games, the Celtics haven\u2019t quite figured it out. Boston has scored just 47 points on those 55 possessions of zone, a rate of 85 per 100 possessions. They\u2019ve shot 15-for-42 (6-for-23 from 3-point range), with more turnovers (16) than field goals. Otherwise (in transition and against man-to-man), the Celtics have scored 108 points per 100 possessions. The one good stretch that the Celtics had against the zone was late in the third quarter of Game 3, when they scored 15 points over eight possessions. The first of those eight was probably their most aesthetically-pleasing possession against the zone \u2026 The Raptors\u2019 21 possessions of zone in Game 3 were more than they played in Games 1 and 2 combined (19). And despite the Celtics\u2019 success in that third-quarter stretch, Toronto came back with it midway through the first quarter of Game 4 on Saturday. There was one bad breakdown (allowing a Williams dunk ), but Boston scored just 13 points on 15 possessions against zone in Game 4, turning the ball over four times. One early-fourth-quarter possession against the box-and-one included a lot of player movement, but the Raptors covered it well. And when the movement stopped, Marcus Smart committed one of those turnovers late in the clock\u2026 The Celtics are obviously going over their zone offense in between games, but the need for rest on days off may make it hard to get in any live-action, practice reps. Expect to see more of it in Game 5. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

That\u2019s 48-plus hours to find a near-miracle cure for a superstar and season that need to make it to next week. But the sneaky and largely unnoticed reality in this NBA restart is how there\u2019s no rest for the weary or injured. The playoffs are engaged every other day, which means Giannis Antetokounmpo can\u2019t simply rub some dirt on his creaky right ankle and expect to be a savior. That\u2019s the bad news for the No. 1 seed in the East, which winced on Sunday when it saw Antetokounmpo collapse and heard him scream when he re-injured that ankle . The newly crownd Kia Defensive Player of the Year and Kia MVP finalist limped off the floor, never to return to Game 4 against the Heat, maybe never again in this series or this season. At least the Bucks didn\u2019t limp right along with him. That\u2019s the good news. The only thing more painful than Giannis\u2019 ankle would\u2019ve been the agony of getting swept by Miami. And so their fate received an extension; not the extension the Bucks are praying for the most \u2014 that would be a contract signed by Giannis \u2014 but this will do. > Game 5: Heat vs. Bucks, Tuesday at 6:30 ET on TNT They\u2019ll see a Game 5 because forward Khris Middleton delivered like a franchise player instead of a designated shotgun rider in Milwaukee\u2019s 118-115 overtime win. He hit a massive and contested 3-pointer with six seconds left in overtime, a moment of truth usually reserved for Giannis. So give Middleton that. Neither the situation nor the presence of Jimmy Butler\u2019s defense made him shiver. \u201cThat\u2019s Khris,\u201d said Bucks center Brook Lopez. \u201cHe was in a rhythm. They did come and double him but getting that shot off, that was a great job by him. He was constantly in control with what\u2019s going on. I can\u2019t say I was surprised by it. That\u2019s the way our team is built. We always come together in moments like that.\u201d Of course, the cynic might advise Milwaukee fans to get used to the sight of Middleton as No. 1 option. Since no team has ever rallied from a 3-0 hole to win a series, the odds are firmly against the Bucks to pull that off with or without Giannis, who\u2019s sure to be gimpy even if he makes an unexpected recovery for Tuesday\u2019s game. A second-round ouster courtesy of Miami, after entering the playoffs with the best record for the second straight year, will either plant the seed for Giannis\u2019 departure from Milwaukee or at least get the outside chatter started. If there wasn\u2019t any doubt that Giannis will sign a max extension with the Bucks in a few months, or before becoming an unrestricted free agent next summer, then why are rival teams keeping salary cap space open longer than 7-Eleven? Interestingly, one such team is Miami. The only heavy contract on the Heat\u2019s cap will belong to Butler, though Antetokounmpo\u2019s potential free agency could coincide with that of current Heat players including Bam Adebayo, Kendrick Nunn and Duncan Robinson. Another serious threat is Dallas because Luka Doncic will still be on his rookie deal and the only big contract will belong to Kristaps Porzingis. Those and other teams (Lakers, Raptors, etc.) will ask Giannis one question: Are your teammates in Milwaukee superior to the teammates you could have here? OK, make that two questions: How many championships do you own? Assuming this year\u2019s chance is already blown, the Bucks will be under intense pressure to win next year or else, which presents a problem. Not only could current contenders remain intact, but Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving will suit up for Brooklyn and the Golden State Warriors will be healthy in the Western Conference. Essentially, the competition for the 2021 championship will be as intense as the competition for Giannis. But that\u2019s talk for another day. The Bucks are simply thrilled they\u2019ll live to see another game. Middleton scored 36 points while lasting 48 very tough minutes, most of those as a solo star. Until then, Middleton once again took a back seat in the game to Giannis, who started strongly by scoring 19 of the Bucks\u2019 first 30 points before toppling in pain. Then Middleton scored 21 points in the third quarter and suddenly it was a contest. Middleton averaged a career high 20.9 points during the regular season. He is the forgotten All-Star, at least on the Bucks. He benefits often from open looks created by the double-teams on Giannis. Yet that shouldn\u2019t be a lasting image of him. Middleton can create his own shot, and did so when he had no other choice once Giannis left. Middleton is a trademark shooter, yet is sneaky solid off the dribble. He showed that in the second half and in OT. \u201cI just wanted to get the ball in certain positions,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought the guys did a good job of passing it and finding me.\u201d Giannis never returned to the bench after leaving, though he did greet his teammates one-by-one in the locker room afterward. \u201cWe know he was out there laying it on the line for us before he got hurt,\u201d said Middleton. \u201cHis ankle was in bad shape coming into the game. But right from the start, in the first and second quarter before he got hurt, he was giving it his all. He\u2019s a complete teammate. Even though he won an MVP and it should be back to back, he\u2019s still a great teammate. We had to have his back tonight. If he plays we\u2019ll have to have his back for the next game, if not we\u2019ll just have to keep playing hard in order to keep playing, period.\u201d The Bucks realize this is a Herculean task, not necessarily because the Heat are loaded with stars, but because Miami\u2019s defense is swarming and intense and history is against Milwaukee. And the format here at Disney doesn\u2019t help. \u201cIt\u2019s been tough playing every other day,\u201d Middleton said. Giannis Antetokounmpo would love to discover the feeling come Tuesday. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

Based on the Sunday performance of so many Milwaukee Bucks not named Antetokoumpo, perhaps the ensemble of Larry O\u2019Brien lifting help is right where he needs it. There in the Bucks locker room, picking him up figuratively \u2026 after picking him up literally, when he fell to the court early in the second quarter of Game 4 of their East semifinal series against Miami. > Game 5: Heat vs. Bucks, Tuesday at 6:30 ET on TNT Antetokounmpo aggravated the sprained right ankle first rolled in Game 3 on Friday, part of the meltdown that dropped them into this 3-0 hole. It was severe enough that the reigning Kia MVP left the game at 10:18 of the second quarter and never returned. History, according to the NBA, already had the Bucks as dead deer walking, facing the same inevitable elimination that came for the first 139 teams to open a best-of-seven series by losing the first three. But to lose Antetokounmpo, the league\u2019s likely repeat MVP and certified top defender of 2019-20? Against this Heat squad that had been more resourceful, more tenacious and playing to its own high standards from the series\u2019 start? Why of course. The remaining Bucks, down 31-30 when Antetokounmpo exited, outscored Miami 88-84 for a 118-115 overtime victory on the Walt Disney World campus. Made no sense. Wouldn\u2019t have bet on it. Yet bubblicious, in an admirable way. This sort of stuff happens occasionally in sports, and in this case there were a few contributing factors: * The remaining Bucks were desperate. With Antetokounmpo gone, they really knew their season was about to end, banishing them from the bubble into an offseason of undetermined length and indefinite futures. You don\u2019t earn the No. 1 seed in the conference two years running only to be so rudely dispatched. Most have heard the chatter through two playoff quests that Antetokounmpo\u2019s teammates might not be up to the task of properly chasing a championship with, and for, him. Yet just when it seemed some of them \u2014 along with coach Mike Budenholzer \u2014 might have been working their last games with the Bucks, they spoke up against that. Loudly, for a night. \u201c[Giannis] was laying it on the line out there for us. His ankle already was in bad shape,\u201d Bucks wing Khris Middleton said, after the postseason performance of his life (36 points, eight rebounds, eight assists). Antetokounmpo had, in fact, scored 19 points in 11 minutes, leading Milwaukee back from an early 12-point deficit to one once he got hurt. \u201cHowever long he was out there, he was giving it his all,\u201d Middleton said. \u201cWe had to have his back.\u201d * Miami relaxed. Jimmy Butler even said so afterward, admitting that the focus and drive that had carried his team to the 3-0 start and seven victories without defeat in the postseason flickered Sunday. \u201cWe did what all of us said we can\u2019t do, and that\u2019s get comfortable,\u201d Butler said. \u201cWe thought this game was going to be easy and it was not. \u2026 We knew what we had to do coming into this game.\u201d Human nature? Sure. Costly against a wounded foe? Sure. \u201cI feel like we played like we were up 3-0,\u201d said center Bam Adebayo. \u201cI feel like we got complacent a little bit. \u2026 And they just kept playing.\u201d Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said it unfolding in defensive lapses that hurt \u2014 baseline cuts, offensive rebounds, Bucks shooters getting to their preferred spots. Uncharacteristic for them. \u201cWe didn\u2019t defend with the level of detail and effort and concentration,\u201d Spoelstra said. \u201cThe reality is, they deserved to win this game. They were playing harder, they were doing things with more force, more consistency, getting us off our spots in our offense.\u201d More force, consistency and motion looked good on the Bucks, who can often look deferential and passive while Antetokounmpo attacks and buckles under swarms of defenders. * Milwaukee\u2019s options were limited. This is the more complicated factor, with the implication that a few of the Bucks\u2019 best players after Antetokounmpo might play more free-and-easy when they can\u2019t defer to his game. It happens all the time for reserves who step in for an injured teammate \u2014 they know they\u2019re getting their minutes that night, no quick hook, so they\u2019re able to get into a rhythm. With the Bucks, Middleton, Brook Lopez and Eric Bledsoe knew the ball was going to be in their hands at levels rarely experienced \u2014 Antetokounmpo topped the NBA this season with a 37.5 usage rate. Someone had to pick up the slack, or Miami might have started playing make-it-take-it. So in addition to Middleton\u2019s firepower stretched across 48 of the 53 minutes, the Bucks got 14 from Lopez, Bledsoe\u2019s most active game (14 points, 10 rebounds, 6 assists) and even 10 points and five boards from Donte DiVincenzo. The second-year guard from Villanova had looked overmatched in the previous games but wound up a game-high plus-22 in his 27 minutes. The biggest one came when he salvaged a possession in the final seconds of regulation by drawing a foul on Goran Dragic. With 1.9 left, his team down 107-106, DiVincenzo missed the first foul shot but hit the second to trigger the overtime. Middleton went over to rub the kid\u2019s shoulders, assuring him that he had made the free throw they\u2019d needed. That\u2019s sort of what Middleton and the rest of them did with Antetokounmpo, assuring him they\u2019d cover for him for a night. \u201cThe Greek Freak\u201d hobbled out of AdventHealth Arena in a walking boot, with nothing but guesses for 24-to-48 hours whether he would be able to play Game 5 on that ankle. Regardless, the energy and passion, the aggression and movement and urgency the other Bucks showed need to be there.

Jernstedt, enshrined as a member of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2017, has passed away at the age of 75. \u201cTom Jernstedt was a humble and unsung steward of the game,\u201d said John L. Doleva, President and CEO of the Basketball Hall of Fame. \u201cUnder his direction, the NCAA Men\u2019s Basketball Tournament grew into a phenomenon that brings college basketball fans together on a global scale. He will forever be remembered as the Father of the Final Four and one of the most respected leaders in basketball.\u201d Tom Jernstedt\u2019s introduction to the NCAA came as a reserve on the University of Oregon football team. Despite a lack of playing time, he proved himself to be a leader in athletics. While football was his primary interest early in life, he would leave a lasting mark on basketball starting in 1972 when he was hired as the director of events at the NCAA and worked his first Final Four. Nearly 50 years later, the madness and the magic of March still reflects the vision and the leadership Jernstedt brought to the NCAA throughout his career. He helped steer the NCAA Tournament through television contracts, tournament expansion, the shift to domed stadiums, and the selection process. He also served as the President of USA Basketball from 2001 to 2004 and was the 2001 recipient of the John Bunn Lifetime Achievement Award. USA Basketball CEO Jim Tooley issued the following statement regarding the passing of  Jernstedt: USA Basketball is greatly saddened to learn of the passing of Tom Jernstedt. A USA Basketball Board of Directors member for many years and the USA Basketball president from 2001-04, Tom was a steadfast supporter and a tireless contributor to USA Basketball, international basketball and the NCAA. He cared greatly about the sport of basketball and even more about the athletes and coaches who represented USA Basketball. Tom was a good friend and mentor to me and to many others at USA Basketball. He will be missed. Our thoughts and prayers go to the Jernstedt family."},{"id":25831,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/disney-world-diary-lessons-learned-nba-campus","date":"2020-09-06","title":"Disney World Diary: Advice after life on NBA campus","content":" ORLANDO, Fla. \u2014 My colleague Sekou Smith is about to be released from NBA quarantine soon and since he won\u2019t know what\u2019ll hit him besides sunshine and humidity at first, I should fill him in on what\u2019s up around here. First: Don\u2019t miss coronavirus testing. Second: Don\u2019t miss coronavirus testing. Once he follows those orders, he\u2019ll be exposed to another world here in this basketball ecosystem. It\u2019s not perfect; nothing ever is. The NBA worked without a parachute and a blueprint while devising a way to continue the season on this campus, collect that all-important TV revenue, and keep everyone safe. But by and large, this operation is a success so far, because of the high level of basketball performances and non-existent number of positive tests. So here\u2019s what Sekou will discover once he gets his equilibrium and his wits following a week locked inside a small hotel room, and my advice for him: \u2022 This is a basketball paradise, an NCAA tournament in one place, only with superior players and better refereeing. The chance to see multiple NBA teams on a single day, either playing a game or practicing it, is once-in-a-lifetime stuff. Luxuriate in it. \u2022 Being inside the arena will seem surreal at first, with no fans or halftime acts and an atmosphere that\u2019s largely artificially created. But the noise created by emotional players and coaches and shifting sneakers is very real and pure. Bring your ears as well as your eyes and they will be treated to the sounds of basketball. \u2022 Don\u2019t worry about stepping on a gecko even if dozens will scatter in your path every day once you open your door. Those reptilian critters are quicker than a juicy rumor. \u2022 Always bring a jacket to Florida in summertime because they overdo it on the air conditioning. You go from sauna to Siberia in a hurry. \u2022 Don\u2019t waste your time requesting a one-on-one interview with LeBron James. King don\u2019t do those. Not yesterday, today, tomorrow, next week or next year. Not here, either. \u2022 But do spend time with Jaylen Brown of the Celtics. It\u2019ll be more meaningful. He\u2019s thoughtful, smart, well-versed and beyond his years. You might even talk basketball with him.  \u2022 Kyle Speller, who\u2019s employed by the Nuggets, is one of four NBA public address announcers invited to voice these games. His enthusiasm and signature style \u2014 yeeahhhbaby! \u2014 is Rucker Park-like and will turn you into a huge fan. \u2022 The teams normally practice on courts installed at the Coronado hotel ballroom and the hallways to those courts make for some, um, interesting if not uncomfortable path-crossing scenes. The morning after the Raptors beat the Celtics on a buzzer-beater, both teams held practice just a few dozen yards away from each other, roughly at the same time. There wasn\u2019t much acknowledging by players en route. \u2022 You will have chicken as a meal choice on Sunday, Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and probably Saturday. \u2022 Do not, under any circumstances, wear a suit or button-down shirt to work. You will get clowned. Dress down like the coaches and your fellow media folk and blend in. \u2022 Rent a bike, even you haven\u2019t ridden one in years. Pedaling will be therapeutic and a good way to clear your head and prepare for the busy day. Make sure to say hello to the power-walking Heat coach on the road that laps the hotel. Erik Spoelstra starts his rounds at roughly 9 am daily. \u2022 There\u2019s a big lake at the hotel so go ahead and grab a rod , although there\u2019s a rumor going around that everyone catches the same one fish. \u2022 Pace yourself, plan accordingly, use time management and make every day count. Understand that this bold experiment by the NBA isn\u2019t sustainable. The price is too steep \u2014 around $175 million? \u2014 and the sacrifices made by everyone involved is too great. And this is just for 22 invited teams over four months, not 30 teams and 82 games plus post-season. \u2022 Finally: Make full use of this chance to reconnect socially with your NBA family, meaning players, coaches, media, league employees, etc. Been a long time since you last saw them. With this pandemic, who knows when you\u2019ll see them again? My time here is done. This assignment from the basketball gods was an honor and pleasure. After two-plus months, I\u2019m headed home. But first, I\u2019m checking my luggage for any gecko castaways. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

He knew their Game 1 effort against the Los Angeles Clippers in the Western Conference semifinals was a sinister mix of fatigue from an emotional Game 7 grind against the Utah Jazz in their first-round series and the Clippers sensing doubt in the opposition and pouncing. So with another day between games to stew on what went wrong, to digest all the chatter about his team being out of its league, the Nuggets\u2019 coach had all the motivation tools needed to stoke the competitive fire of his team. Don\u2019t take the first punch. Deliver it. And keep swinging. It worked spectacularly early as the Nuggets built an early 23-point lead behind the 1-2 punch of Nikola Jokic and Jamal Murray in a wire-to-wire 110-101 Game 2 victory Saturday. That Nuggets team that ran out of gas after the first quarter Thursday night, morphed back into the energized bunch that battled from 3-1 down against the Jazz to win that series. The change in demeanor, the increase in physicality, is what Malone expected from his crew. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s hard at all,\u201d Malone said. \u201cI mean, this is playoff basketball. If you don\u2019t have a physical mindset you\u2019re going to be going home early. I thought we had a physical mindset in that Utah series coming back from a 3-1 deficit and tonight we were a noticeably different team than we were in Game 1. \u201c Those same guts and mettle they displayed in that comeback against the Jazz was require to survive the second half Saturday night. The Clippers closed within single digits multiple times in the fourth quarter, but each time the Nuggets got an answer from defensive ace Gary Harris, who nailed three huge 3-pointers to help secure the win. Harris was playing in just his fourth game since the season restarted here in the Orlando bubble. He was rehabbing a hip injury that and isn\u2019t yet in his normal game shape. But he\u2019s still sharp enough to have made the clutch steal on Donovan Mitchell in the closing seconds of that Game 7 win over Utah. Harris and Murray nailed 3-pointers on back-to-back possessions in the final minutes to help hold the Clippers off down the stretch. \u201cHe gave us a big boost on offense and since Game 6 [of the Utah series] he\u2019s been giving us a big boost on defense,\u201d Murray said. \u201cThat\u2019s what he does and that\u2019s what we expect of him. And he\u2019s had a great transition from not playing to coming back and starting and being a big part of what we do.\u201d Jerami Grant led a swarming and relentless defensive effort on Kawhi Leonard as the Nuggets held the reigning Finals MVP to his worst game of this postseason (13 points on 4-for-17 shooting) and his lowest-scoring playoff game since 2016. Leonard\u2019s streak of playoff games scoring at least 15 points was halted at 47. Harris did a similar job on Paul George, who led the Clippers with 22 points (7-19 FGs, 4-10 3Ps). Harris\u2019s 13 points (including a 4-for-7 shooting effort from beyond the 3-point line) proved just as critical. \u201cOur defensive, our activity and the fact that we were willing to help each other [improved],\u201d Malone said. \u201cI thought Jerami Grant\u2019s defense on Kawhi was spectacular. But the four guys behind him were giving the necessary help. I thought Gary Harris\u2019 defense on Paul George was terrific. But the help behind that was what we needed, what we didn\u2019t have in Game 1.\u201d That initial punch from Jokic and Murray was also missing from Game 1. After exhausting themselves in that wild Game 7 against Utah, they were spent by the end of the first quarter in Game 1 against the Clippers. They made up for it in the opening minutes of Game 2, taking turns attacking and setting the tone. They owned the floor before halftime \u2014 when the Nuggets led led 72-56 \u2014 combining for 44 points (24 from Jokic; 20 from Murray). They combined for a total of 27 in that Game 1 wipeout. \u201cWe were tired,\u201d Murray said. \u201cWe came out sloppy, we came out exhausted, we didn\u2019t make shots and it showed.\u201d Clippers coach Doc Rivers noticed the difference from the start in Game 2. Jokic knocked down three wide-open 3-pointers early, Murray was attacking and getting to his spots and his team was trying to climb out of that hole all night. \u201cJokic had like 30 seconds to shoot those first three 3s,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cHe\u2019s a good player to begin with. But when we gift him nine points, he\u2019s just going to get more confident. I thought Murray was dominant and I thought Jokic was just as dominant in the first quarter. Honestly, I thought they just played more aggressive. They got into us the entire game.\u201d They did exactly what Malone asked them to do. They responded the way he expected a team that\u2019s playing in the conference semifinals for a second straight season to respond when smacked in the mouth the way the Nuggets were in Game 1. And now things really get interesting. Because the Clippers get a day to digest what went wrong, what they can do better and figure out an appropriate response. Their path to the conference finals and beyond won\u2019t come easy. It won\u2019t come without a fight from a Nuggets team that is convinced it belongs. \u201cOur group believes in themselves,\u201d Malone said. \u201cWe\u2019ve shown that we\u2019re a very resilient group that can execute and find ways to win in close games down the stretch. It\u2019s great to be able to tie this series up and have that life and belief going into the next game.\u201d Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

In fact, OG Anunoby\u2019s buzzer-beating game winner in Game 3 was the difference between the Raptors shooting better or worse than the Celtics from beyond the arc on Thursday. The Raptors had a much bigger edge in Game 4 on Saturday, shooting 17-for-44 (39%) from 3-point range on their way to a much more comfortable, 100-93 victory that tied the series at two games apiece. The pivotal Game 5 is Monday (6:30 ET, TNT). \u201cIt\u2019s a huge part of the game,\u201d Raptors coach Nick Nurse said of the 3-point shooting \u201cWe\u2019re trying to defend \u2019em at a super high level and challenge \u2019em, and we\u2019re certainly trying to create good ones for our guys to step into and shoot \u2019em.\u201d > Game 5: Celtics vs. Raptors, Monday at 6:30 ET on TNT To that first part, it should be acknowledged that Jaylen Brown, who shot 42% on catch-and-shoot 3s in the regular season ( 39% in the playoffs through Game 3 ), missed some open and in-rhythm looks on Saturday. The Celtics were 7-for-35 (20%) from 3-point range and Brown (2-for-11) attempted five more 3s than any of his teammates. But, upon review of the film, less than half of the Celtics\u2019 28 misses from beyond the arc were open and in-rhythm. The Raptors did challenge a lot of those 3s, even though their priorities on that end of the floor start with defending the dribble. \u201cIt\u2019s always most important that we get \u2019em in the half-court,\u201d Nurse said. \u201cOnce you get \u2019em in the half-court it\u2019s probably containing the ball, and trying as best we can to keep the ball in front of us.\u201d These days, with hand-checking disallowed, keeping the ball in front of you often requires multiple defenders. And the Raptors are probably the most aggressive team in the league in regard to putting extra bodies (and arms) in front of the ball-handler. They pinch off shooters one pass away in an effort to both keep the offense from getting all the way to the basket and force turnovers. In the regular season, the Raptors were the only team that ranked in the top five in both the (lowest) percentage of their opponents\u2019 shots that came in the restricted area (30%, 5th) and opponent turnovers per 100 possessions (16.5, 2nd ). The other side of that coin is that the Raptors will allow a lot of 3s. But that doesn\u2019t mean that they will happily concede those 3s. Yes, there will be some open ones, like the two from either corner that Brown missed in the first four minutes on Saturday. But no team can contest every shot. And the champs are the best in the league at scrambling out of two-to-the-ball situations, rotating, and contesting as much as they possibly can. Yes, it\u2019s a make-or-miss league. But not all misses are the same. Here is some of the champs\u2019 best work in forcing tough 3s from the Celtics in Game 4: Play 1 Pascal Siakam is on the bottom row of the Raptors\u2019 2-3 zone and has both feet well inside the paint when Jayson Tatum throws a dart to Marcus Smart in the left corner. But Siakam sells out and jumps like he would if he was trying to dunk the ball from the free-throw line, running Smart off the catch-and-shoot 3. He even manages to contest the side-step 3 with a quick second jump. Play 2 Matt Thomas matches up with Semi Ojeleye in the right corner in transition, but quickly rotates up to stop Tatum with the ball. Tatum swings it to Ojeleye, who elicits another all-out close-out from Siakam. Thomas rotates back to Ojeleye and Lowry rotates to Tatum, whose fall allows the Raptors to reset. Thomas then switches a Kemba Walker-Ojeleye pick-and-roll and is able to avoid the foul on Walker\u2019s step-back 3 (though Walker would probably disagree on the avoiding-the-foul part). Play 3 Kyle Lowry sinks into the paint to help Fred VanVleet on Brown\u2019s drive, but is still able to run Smart off the catch-and-shoot 3 from the left wing. And like Siakam in the first play, he recovers to contest the side-step 3. Play 4 The Celtics\u2019 after-timeout play has Walker curling to the ball off a Grant Williams screen. VanVleet\u2019s pressure pushes Walker\u2019s catch far beyond the 3-point line. Serge Ibaka meets Walker on the other side of a Brad Wanamaker screen, Lowry rotates to Wanamaker\u2019s pop, and Siakam guards two guys until Ibaka recovers. VanVleet then defends Walker\u2019s late-clock iso about as well as one can, though the Raptors do give up an offensive rebound. Play 5 The Raptors push a double-drag screen for Walker far beyond the 3-point line. Marc Gasol retreats to stay with Daniel Theis\u2019 roll to the rim, but VanVleet is able to contest a potential pull-up 3 from behind. Siakam stays in front of Brown, and when Siakam falls, Gasol steps up and OG Anunoby rotates down to guard Theis. Tatum is open on the right wing, but Anunoby runs him off the catch-and-shoot 3 and the side-step attempt is off the mark. The Celtics do get another offensive board. That is a lot of ridiculous effort on the defensive end of the floor. \u201cWe weren\u2019t really switched on to Game 1,\u201d Nurse said. \u201cBut other than that game I think we\u2019ve tried hard. I think there\u2019s been some effort and some desire and some toughness, and trying to carry it through for most possessions. \u201cEach possession seems to be pretty critical in a playoff game, and we\u2019re getting to the point where we\u2019re playing most of the possessions as, we\u2019re trying hard. We\u2019re making some mistakes and they\u2019ve got good players and they make shots and some things like that, but we\u2019re down and we\u2019re trying to compete is the biggest thing.\u201d As seen on those last two plays above, the Raptors\u2019 rotations do leave them susceptible on the glass. But their defensive rebounding percentage has higher in the playoffs (76.4%, 7th ) than it was in the regular season (72.1%, 22nd ). And it\u2019s been higher in this series (80.1%) than it was in the first round ( 73.6% ). Rebounding is important, but the most critical thing you can do defensively is force your opponent to miss shots. The Raptors do that both near and far from the basket. Not only did they rank second in opponent field goal percentage in the restricted area (59.3%) in the regular season, but they ranked first in opponent 3-point percentage (33.7%). The Celtics probably won\u2019t shoot 20% from beyond the arc like they did in Game 4 again, but they might not shoot 44% like they did in Game 1 again either. And even when the Celtics made 10 corner 3s in Game 1, they scored a well-below-average 106 points per 100 possessions (112 on 106). This series is the first time the Celtics have been held under 110 points per 100 possessions in four straight games since a 2-3 road trip in mid-November. \u201cThat\u2019s our foundation,\u201d VanVleet said, \u201cbeing able to get stops. As long as we continue to do that at a high level, we give ourselves a chance to win, and we got to keep meeting the challenge. It\u2019s a really, really hard team to guard but I think we are doing a great job trying to meet the challenge.\u201d The Raptors\u2019 own offense has had its issues. Toronto ranks seventh offensively out of eight teams in this round. But they\u2019re certainly able to win ugly, so consistently good defensively that they\u2019re now 45-3 ( 5-0 in the playoffs ) when they\u2019ve scored at least 105 points per 100 possessions. \u201cI think we know who we are,\u201d VanVleet said Saturday. \u201cI think we\u2019re just being OK being uncomfortable and not being pretty. I think we can win in many different ways and I think that we\u2019re very versatile and just trying to keep continuing to find ways to win. \u201cIt\u2019s not always going to be pretty but I think we\u2019re comfortable with how ugly and mucky the game is now. Now we would like it not to be that way but you\u2019ve got to take what you get and that\u2019s a great team that we\u2019re going up against, and we\u2019ll take any wins that we can get, take any success that we can get. So we put up 100 and we were able to hold them to 93 and that\u2019s the name of the game at this point in the year.\u201d John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

He will also, in all likelihood, win his second straight Kia MVP award in a few weeks. And if you fell from another planet and started watching this second-round playoff series between the Bucks and Heat, you\u2019d assume this is a tale about Jimmy Butler. >> Game 2: Heat go for the sweep Sunday (3:30 ET, ABC)  But no, no. This is Giannis Antetokounmpo, who has everything a superstar wants, and suddenly a few things he doesn\u2019t: Questions about his ability to lead a team to the promised land. Those conversations are being amplified here on the eve of a potential sweep, with Butler and the Heat bringing the brooms instead of Giannis and the team with the NBA\u2019s best record. Giannis is down alarmingly in the second round to a lower seed, and in this type of situation, all eyes are seared in the direction of the player who earns all the goodies. Should the Heat finish him off \u2014 and no team in NBA history has rallied from 3-0 in a best-of-seven \u2014 Giannis will deal with a level of scrutiny like none before in his otherwise stunning NBA career. His flaws are being magnified and exploited right now and his trend of going silent in the fourth-quarter stretch in this series will solidify if it hasn\u2019t already. He might find that shaking a reputation can be a lot harder than shaking a few defenders on his way to the hoop. Mainly, he\u2019ll need to go back to the lab this offseason and fine-tune his skills, starting with his outside shooting. That part of his game still lags, and although Giannis has gained more confidence in that shot over the last year, it has failed spectacularly against Miami, where he\u2019s 2-for-13. The Heat, therefore, are giving Giannis all the room he wants on the perimeter, leaving him open, daring him to aim from 20 feet, watching him misfire. He\u2019s most dangerous when he runs downhill to the basket, a 6-foot-10 forward who covers the space between midcourt and the rim in roughly four gallops, collecting fouls and breaking spirits along the way. But again: When your jumper isn\u2019t being respected, you start seeing layers of defenders standing in the paint and waiting and often drawing offensive fouls. Or, in the case of ace defenders Butler and Bam Adebayo, you get stripped of the ball en route. Problem is, Giannis tweaked his ankle midway through Game 3 and had to endure the remainder of the game operating at less than 100%. With only one day\u2019s rest between games here at Disney, there\u2019s not ample recovery time; the Bucks called off Saturday\u2019s practice. There\u2019s also another issue at stake: Giannis\u2019 level of bloodthirstiness. This can only be tested in the postseason, when the stakes are high and demands on superstars are heavy. This cold-hearted approach is very apparent in the eyes, demeanor and take-charge-ness of Butler, who like the majority of NBA players has far less physical ability than Giannis . Milwaukee searched for leadership in the fourth quarter of Game 3 and found none, being outscored by 27 points in the period. Giannis is still waiting to deliver a signature moment in this series. He missed 14-of-21 shots in Game 3 with three turnovers, far from the level he enjoyed in a season that saw him average almost 30 and 14 and win Kia Defensive Player of the Year. \u201cI am in a good place,\u201d Giannis insisted. \u201c Obviously, if there is a team that can come back against a team from 3-0, and beat them, it can be us. \u201d The plight that the Bucks find themselves in can also be taken another way, that perhaps Giannis doesn\u2019t have the right mix of players around him. This song and verse has been heard before. Is Khris Middleton a true and solid deputy to Giannis? Does Eric Bledsoe have the chops to match up with the league\u2019s other floor leaders at point guard? What happens if the Bucks fail to hit open 3-pointers and do they have the personnel for that or an emergency plan other than throw the ball to Giannis. \u201cI believe in my teammates, I trust my teammates, I love my teammates and I want my teammates to be confident,\u201d Giannis said. \u201cWe can do it.\u201d Also: Why isn\u2019t Giannis playing more than 33-34 minutes a night, especially here in the postseason where it\u2019s all-hands-on-deck? These are nervous times in Milwaukee because the fate of the franchise rests with Giannis. No other team is more dependent on a superstar, both on and off the court, than the Bucks are with Giannis. He helped build a downtown arena with all the bells and whistles, made the Bucks a title contender, put a small-market town on the basketball map and influenced many personnel decisions. Didn\u2019t the Bucks give Middleton an astonishing contract extension \u2014 he\u2019ll make $40 million in 2023-24 alone, rich for a No. 2 option guy \u2014 partly to show Giannis how committed they are? Same for Bledsoe, who\u2019ll make $19 million in his final year? And what about when Giannis\u2019 deal comes up next summer, when almost every team in the NBA will clear salary cap room in what will be the next great free-agent chase? How damaging would that be for the Bucks if Giannis fails to win a ring between then and now and decides he\u2019d have a better chance elsewhere? That\u2019s the elephant in the room, because the franchise is hypersensitive about Giannis and his options next summer. The Bucks do have the ace card, of course. They can, and will, offer him a supermax extension that\u2019ll be more than any other team can offer. And if Giannis puts that level of generational wealth above everything else, then it\u2019ll be an easy decision. Still, others have rejected that money, namely Kawhi Leonard and Anthony Davis, so there\u2019s precedent. And anyway, this isn\u2019t Giannis\u2019 first big contract; it\u2019s his second. He\u2019s already wealthy. All of that, and more, creeps into the picture for Giannis and the Bucks in the event of a second-round ouster and they can\u2019t return to the conference finals, much less the NBA Finals. The atmosphere at this NBA campus does favor a team trying to rally. There\u2019s no home-court advantage of disadvantage, and besides, Milwaukee hasn\u2019t dropped four straight all season. \u201cFirst time in the history playing in a bubble, first time in history a team can come back from down 3-0,\u201d said guard George Hill. This is supposed to be his year and Milwaukee\u2019s year, the second time they entered the playoffs with the league\u2019s best record and the MVP. They were the dominant player and team during the regular season. They were the force that held up the playoffs for a few days to better reflect on social injustice. They came into the playoffs as the top seed and strong favorite against Butler and the upstart Heat. If Giannis and the Bucks exit meekly and quietly, what did it all mean? And: Where is this all headed? * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years. You can e-mail him  here , find his archive here  and follow him on  Twitter  .

James called the Rockets a \u201c100-meter dash team,\u201d before turning to the NFL to bring home the point. >> Game 2: Lakers look to even series (Monday, 8:30 ET, ABC) \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like in the early 2000s [with] the St. Louis Rams, \u2018The Greatest Show on Turf,\u2019\u201d James explained. \u201cPeople always said how you\u2019d scout them, scout them, and scout them until they got on the field and saw Isaac Bruce, Torry Holt, Marshall Faulk, Az[-Zahir] Hakim and all those guys. And they were like, \u2018OK, we need to play them again because there\u2019s no way you can simulate that speed.\u2019\u201d Luckily for the Lakers, they\u2019ve got at least three more cracks at it. Playing at a blistering pace offensively while relying on its relentless, active defense \u2014 which ranks No. 1 in the playoffs \u2014 Houston seized Game 1 of this series with relative ease on the strength of a 36-point night from James Harden, who produced his sixth outing of the postseason with 30-plus points, and strong showings from Russell Westbrook (24 points, 9 rebounds, 6 assists) and Eric Gordon (23 points). Defensively, the Rockets feasted on 17 turnovers they turned into 27 points as Lakers stars James (20 points) and Anthony Davis (25 points) combined for just 22 points in the second half. Maybe Houston\u2019s small-ball style doesn\u2019t put them at a disadvantage against the larger Lakers after all. Game 1 of the Western Conference semifinals marked the first time since the 1971 NBA Finals (Milwaukee Bucks against the Baltimore Bullets) that a playoff game featured a team with no starter shorter than 6-foot-5 against an opponent with no starter taller than 6-foot-7, according to research from Elias Sports Bureau. As if that mattered, anyway. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Rockets coach Mike D\u2019Antoni said. \u201cThere\u2019s just not that many plays that are above the rim. Most of them are on the floor or position or loose balls. I don\u2019t know how many times you have to be above the rim. Every once in a while, they\u2019re above the rim. Great. If we can control everything below the rim, I\u2019ll take that.\u201d That\u2019s precisely what Houston did in this one. \u201cThey\u2019re a really good team. So, we had to get off to a really good start,\u201d Harden said. \u201cWe did that. We were just competing, competing, until we figured out what they were doing. We just tried to keep attacking. If you give them opportunities to play slow and play into their hands, they have the advantage. So, we wanted to keep our pace up, and defensively, be active; make those guys work as hard as we can and make everything tough for them.\u201d On occasion, the Lakers randomly sent double teams at Harden, but that seemed to only harden the guard\u2019s resolve to attack the rim. In the first half alone, Los Angeles sent Harden to the free-throw line on 11 occasions, with the guard scoring nine of his 25 points over the first two quarters on freebies. If you\u2019ve spent any amount of time watching the Rockets play, then you know that\u2019s precisely how Harden typically finds his rhythm. \u201cWe were careless fouling him, and that definitely gets him going,\u201d Lakers coach Frank Vogel said. \u201cWe know this about James. If you\u2019re going to beat the Houston Rockets, you\u2019ve got to play him without fouling.\u201d To do that, the Lakers know they\u2019ve got to find a way to adjust to Houston\u2019s overall team speed. Coming off a six-day layoff after making quick work of the Portland Trail Blazers in the first round, the Lakers knew what they were getting into having faced the Rockets this season on three other occasions. They saw the speed on film; saw it just two days prior when Houston bested Oklahoma City in Game 7 of the opening round behind Harden\u2019s late heroics on defense. \u201cThey play with a lot of speed both offensively and defensively. You can see it on the film,\u201d James said. \u201c[But you don\u2019t really understand the speed] until you get out there and get a feel for it. That\u2019s what we did tonight: we got a feel for their speed, and we should be fully aware of that going into Game 2. We had 17 turnovers for 27 points versus a team that\u2019s [a] 100-meter yard dash team. You cannot turn the ball over like that. It\u2019s just that simple. It starts with myself being the primary ball handler, and it trickles down to everybody else. How do you adjust to their speed?\u201d It also helps to understand the all-encompassing effect that Houston\u2019s speed played on Friday\u2019s outcome. In addition to all the points Houston scored off turnovers, it totally negated Los Angeles\u2019 size advantage with speed and quickness. The larger Lakers finished the game tied 41-41 with the Rockets in rebounds, and the latter won the defensive rebounding battle 37-31, thus limiting the former\u2019s second-chance scoring opportunities. When Harden left the game with 2:45 left in the third quarter, the Rockets led by three (76-73). Houston would storm to a 15-point advantage before its leading scorer re-entered the game, with Gordon closing out the show with his 11 points in the fourth quarter on 3-of-5 shooting. \u201cWe\u2019re just doing a good job of covering for each other,\u201d Westbrook said. \u201cWe\u2019re small out there, so we\u2019ve got to be scrappy. We\u2019ve got to play hard. If we don\u2019t, our chances of winning come down. Our guys in the locker room know that. Everybody stepped up defending, rebounding. Our quickness was beneficial tonight.\u201d It also played a major role in breaking James\u2019 15-game winning streak in conference semifinals games. He also finished the game at a minus-15, his worst this postseason in 37 minutes. Harden, meanwhile, believes Houston has finally found the formula to keep it alive in the postseason. For all Harden\u2019s scoring acumen, he knows it\u2019s not offense, and the Rockets\u2019 Game 7 win over OKC served as testament to that as well as Friday\u2019s triumph over the Lakers. \u201cI think where we\u2019re great at is our defense,\u201d Harden said. \u201cOffensively, we can score with the best of them. But defensively, I think we\u2019ve found it. If we can continue to just guard and lock in on our defensive coverages, the plan works. You\u2019ve got to be a competitor. You\u2019ve got to take on the challenge. Everything isn\u2019t gonna be great every single night, every possession. Sometimes you\u2019re gonna struggle. Sometimes, you\u2019re gonna be playing well. But I think if you\u2019ve got that competitive spirit and you have the will to want to get things done, that makes up for anybody that\u2019s tall, that\u2019s 7-feet.\u201d * * * Michael C.

He and his No. 1-seeded Mavericks were upset in the first round by No. 8 Golden State. So the trophy ceremony came a couple weeks later in Dallas, at a bittersweet news conference as the postseason rolled on without them. That appears to be the dilemma facing the league now with Giannis Antetokounmpo. Straw polls suggest the Milwaukee Bucks star is a heavy favorite to be named NBA MVP for the second season in a row. If the presentation is delayed until the Bucks are out of the Disney restart bubble \u2014 in deference to the 3-0 hole against Miami in which they find themselves, another No. 1 seed in dire playoff trouble \u2014 it will end up on Zoom, the doors of Milwaukee\u2019s Fiserv Forum locked by pandemic orders to appreciative fans, most of Antetokounmpo\u2019s teammates scattered to the offseason. If, on the other hand, it\u2019s decided that the MVP \u2014 the last undisclosed award of the NBA\u2019s six top-tier annual honors \u2014 should get presented before the Bucks are eliminated, which could come as soon as Sunday afternoon, league honchos will likely seek some sort of assurance that Antetokounmpo doesn\u2019t silently hand it to the Heat\u2019s irrepressible Jimmy Butler. There is no doubt who the MVP has been in Antetokounmpo\u2019s and Butler\u2019s head-to-head matchup through three games of their Eastern Conference semifinal. What the Greek Freak did to the rest of the league from October into March, Jimmy (More Than) Buckets has been doing to the Bucks in grabbing a never-surmounted 3-0 lead in the best-of-seven series. Teams that fall so far behind have gone 0-139 in NBA playoff history, which would have even the Jim Carrey half of Dumb and Dumber admitting that, nah, there\u2019s no chance. To be honest, there\u2019s really no need to assess all three games, as far as what Miami is doing so well and how Milwaukee has gotten so sideways from the style successful enough to run up that 56-17 regular-season record. The fourth quarter of Game 3 provided all the biopsy any pathologist would need. It was one of those hit-them-so-hard-it-wins-the-whole-series quarters, though Miami already was well on its way in that direction. The Heat trailed 87-75 when the period began and 91-80 with 10 minutes left at The Field House. From there, the Heat could do almost no wrong while the Bucks could do almost nothing right. Miami outscored them 35-9 over those final 10 minutes. In all, the 27-point differential was the most one-sided of any fourth quarter in playoff history. The Heat caught and passed Milwaukee as if Antetokounmpo and his mates were standing still, which at times they obviously were. The comeback started with a pair of Bam Adebayo free throws at 9:40, continued through a couple more by Butler at 6:16 to tie and edge ahead, 94-93, then all but wrapped on Jae Crowder\u2019s 3-pointer from the wing on Butler\u2019s penetration-and-kick that made it 107-100 at 2:15. So yeah, a 27-9 rush in less than 7 1\/2 minutes, and then Miami tacking on the game\u2019s final eight points, too. With the Bucks encased in amber or something. After providing a laundry list of his team\u2019s failings down the stretch, Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer summed it up: \u201cThey made every play and we didn\u2019t make enough, obviously.\u201d Then, perhaps due to the screaming in his head in those initial minutes after Game 3, Budenholzer made some odd comments. He talked about winning the first three quarters Friday, along with the last three quarters of Game 2. \u201cSo six quarters in a row,\u201d he said. When asked about still keeping his best players, Antetokounmpo (34:55) and Khris Middleton (36:03), at a moderate minutes level despite the increasing urgency, Budenholzer said: \u201cObviously it\u2019s 48 minutes and we\u2019ve got to be good for the last 12.\u201d The irony about the last 12 seemed lost on him. So much of what Milwaukee built its season and identity on has vanished. Miami is taking and making more 3-pointers, while the Bucks struggle with that weapon. A defense that prides itself on not fouling sent the Heat to the line for 34 free throws. And a group to which Antetokounmpo, the Defensive Player of the Year, gave credit for making that award possible has been torched for 115.3 points per game in this series. Most of all, what Miami has had that Milwaukee has lacked has been toughness, both physically and mentally. If you did a draft, playground style, with the rosters of these teams for sheer toughness, you\u2019d get at least three deep in Heat players \u2014 Butler, Bam Adebayo and Jae Crowder \u2014 before you picked the first Buck. And that\u2019s not counting Udonis Haslem, Miami\u2019s Yoda on the bench. There\u2019s a sense that nobody pulls it together in crises for Milwaukee like any of the above. They\u2019re much more into affability than volatility, which has them looking steamrolled emotionally as well as in the outcomes. Consider where Antetokounmpo pointed for the failure Friday. \u201cThey play harder than us,\u201d he said, several times. \u201cThey play harder than us.\u201d Now try to picture Butler, three losses in, sitting at a podium to tell the world that their rivals were playing harder than his team. Can\u2019t do it. The ruckus from behind the closer locker room door after Game 1 or Game 2 would have said everything. It would not have happened a third time. Antetokounmpo might not be that guy for Milwaukee, but somebody needs to be. Needed to have been, frankly. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

One, he misses his family. Two, he doesn\u2019t understand why they aren\u2019t with him now. But the NBA confirmed Friday night that the policy may change later this month. \u201cWe are hoping to add additional family members for other participants beginning with the Conference Finals,\u201d a league spokesman said. \u201cWe are mindful of the incredible hardship these restrictions impose and wish it were not necessary for the health and safety of everyone involved.\u201d Malone \u2014 offering perhaps the most impassioned plea of any coach who has spoken on the topic \u2014 railed against the policy that says coaches are unable to bring family or a guest into the bubble. Some players were reunited in the bubble with family members or guests for the first time this week, and referees had the option of bringing one guest into the bubble. No referee has yet exercised that right, however. \u201cI say, `Shame on you, NBA.\u2032 This is crazy,\u201d Malone said. \u201cI miss my family, and I think I speak for me, I speak for my coaches and probably all the coaches down here \u2014 60 days and not having access and not being granted the privilege to have my family come here, to me, is criminal in nature. And that shouldn\u2019t be. Shouldn\u2019t be at all.\u201d It might not be that way as the playoffs move along. Miami coach Erik Spoelstra \u2014 who previously criticized the policy \u2014 said the league\u2019s head coaches, led by Dallas\u2019 Rick Carlisle, are lobbying for change and that the NBA \u201chasn\u2019t totally, absolutely, 100% shut the door\u201d on the notion. \u201cI understand that these are not easy decisions, and this is not a normal period of time in our history,\u201d Spoelstra said. \u201cThis is unprecedented. You can\u2019t compare this to anything else. You\u2019re trying to put together something that has protocols, that has structure, that is working in a world where there is COVID and a global pandemic. \u2026 The more people you add to it, then you\u2019re also increasing the risk of something happening.\u201d The league worked with Disney officials as well as health authorities to determine how many people could be safely allowed inside the so-called bubble. The restart began with 22 teams; only eight remain, and the population drop allows room for family members and in some cases additional team staff to enter the bubble. Spoelstra hasn\u2019t seen his wife and two young sons since the Heat left for Lake Buena Vista two months ago. \u201cWe\u2019re not in the military. We don\u2019t have a background in this,\u201d Spoelstra said. \u201cI miss my family dearly. These are extraordinary times and this is an extraordinary opportunity here in this bubble. So, I get it.

This is the first NBA Sixth Man Award for Harrell, who finished in third place last season.  Harrell received 58 first-place votes from a global panel of 100 sportswriters and broadcasters and earned 397 total points. Oklahoma City Thunder guard Dennis Schr\u00f6der finished in second place with 328 points (35 first-place votes). Clippers guard Lou Williams, a three-time Kia NBA Sixth Man Award winner, received the other seven first-place votes and finished in third place with 127 points. Players were awarded five points for each first-place vote, three points for each second-place vote and one point for each third-place vote. The voting was conducted based on regular-season games played through March 11. The seeding games, which were played July 30 \u2013 Aug. 14 as part of the season restart, did not count toward voting for the Kia NBA Sixth Man Award or the league\u2019s other traditional end-of-season awards. To be eligible for the Sixth Man Award, players had to have come off the bench in more games than they started in games played through March 11. From the beginning of the season through March 11, Harrell averaged 18.6 points, 7.1 rebounds and 1.14 blocked shots in 27.8 minutes in 63 games (two starts) as part of his fifth NBA season. In games played off the bench during that time, Harrell ranked second in the NBA in scoring (18.4 ppg) and fifth in rebounding (7.0 rpg). He also shot 58.0 percent from the field in all games played through March 11, the 10th-best mark in the NBA.  In games played off the bench through March 11, Harrell recorded an NBA-high 11 double-doubles, tied for first with four games of at least 30 points and ranked second with 10 games of 25 or more points. He scored 34 points off the bench twice, matching his single-game career high as a starter or reserve.   Led by Harrell and Williams, the Clippers averaged an NBA-high 51.5 points off the bench and outscored their opponents\u2019 reserves in 53 of 64 games through March 11. LA posted a 44-20 record during that period, the second-best mark in the Western Conference.  Harrell, 26, has spent the last three seasons with the Clippers, who acquired him in a trade with the Houston Rockets in June 2017. He played his first two seasons with the Rockets after they selected him in the second round (No. 32 overall) of NBA Draft 2015 presented by State Farm.  This marks the third consecutive season and the fifth time in seven years that a member of the Clippers has received the Kia NBA Sixth Man Award. Williams won the award in each of the previous two seasons, and Jamal Crawford did so with the Clippers in the 2013-14 and 2015-16 seasons. The voting results for the 2019-20 Kia NBA Sixth Man Award are below. The balloting was tabulated by the independent accounting firm of Ernst & Young LLP. Complete ballots for each voter will be posted at pr.nba.com after the announcement of all end-of-season awards.

For months, we discussed the possibility with local elections officials knowing we could help make the voting process open, accessible, safe and even exciting. After all, our facility has a storied history of attracting and serving our friends and neighbors across Miami-Dade County. We did a walk-through with them and were led to believe we would be receiving an agreement to solidify all that had been discussed and make it official, including a commitment to make the Arena available for the same purpose in future years. Then today, we were informed that our Arena would not be designated a polling place, in favor of the Frost Science Museum. This decision was made and delivered without further explanation. NBA arenas all over the country, including just up the road in Orlando are getting approved as polling sites with little to no pushback. We were under the impression that approval was imminent.  To say we are disappointed is a huge understatement. The Arena is clearly a better site, with more visibility, more space, and more parking.

Raptors aim to ride momentum changer","content":" ORLANDO \u2013The morning after, once the heartbeat returned to normal and the yelling subsided and the Raptors-Celtics playoff series became a lot more interesting and unpredictable, Nick Nurse was interrupted by a buzzing cell phone. Brendan Brown was on the line and he thanked the Raptors coach and said: \u201cIt felt like my dad got a chance to be in the bubble for a moment.\u201d That father is Hubie Brown, the Hall of Famer and longtime coach and current TV commentator who, because he\u2019s 86 and there\u2019s a pandemic, had to sit out this restart. And partly because of Brown, the defending champs were spared from the brink of elimination. Instead, they only trail the Celtics 2-1 after Nurse drew up a Game 3 play that launched an improbable 3-point buzzer-beater . In terms of impact and history-making, OG Anunoby\u2019s shot won\u2019t replace the iconic Kawhi Leonard rim-bounce that sent the Raptors to the Eastern Conference finals a year ago, but it saved Toronto\u2019s season nonetheless. \u201cWe were desperate, man,\u201d said Nurse. After the game, Nurse casually mentioned to the media how he discovered that play from an old Hubie Brown instructional video. Toronto had only a half-second for Kyle Lowry to inbound the ball and throw a pass that traveled across court to a wide-open Anunoby, who snuck behind the Boston defense and released just before time expired. Nurse is the freshly-named NBA Coach of the Year for steering the Raptors back into the title mix despite losing Leonard last summer to free agency. Nurse is known for occasionally using methods considered unconventional or outdated and breathing life into them. Such as: In last year\u2019s Finals, Nurse surprised Warriors guard Steph Curry with a box-and-one, a defensive tactic designed to stop one player and is mainly confined to youth basketball. A few years before then, Nurse was invited to Brown\u2019s home and he approached the door sheepishly, wondering if he belonged. \u201cI got there early in the morning and we spent the whole day talking basketball,\u201d said Nurse. \u201cThen last year in the playoffs I got a chance to sit down with him during that run because he was doing our games on TV. He \u2019 s one of the great ones. It was bizarre for me to be sitting there talking to H ubie , you know what I mean? I was a young coach coming up. I mean, it was appointment viewing just to watch him announce games. Because I felt I was learning so much from him.\u201d There are moments in almost every playoff series, especially the tightly-contested ones, that freeze in time and flip the switch. The Raptors are hoping that shot changes the vibe in this second-round series that, until it swished, had belonged to Boston. The proud defending champs had few answers for the tactics, execution and energy shown by the Celtics, who are deep and well-matched with Toronto and cause problems, starting with Jayson Tatum but not limited to that All-Star. Now, there\u2019s new swagger in the Raptors and drama in this series. And besides the shot, some of this is due to Lowry, the team\u2019s leader and spiritual heartbeat. He shook off a Game 3 knee to the groin to cleverly throw the inbounds pass over Celtics center Tacko Fall, who\u2019s a foot taller. But his determination was evident well before then; Lowry broke free of a pair of sub-par games, where he was outplayed by Celtics guard Kemba Walker, to deliver 31 points and burn 46 minutes Thursday. A case can be made that Lowry is the most important player in franchise history, if he hasn\u2019t supplanted Vince Carter for being the best. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve ever seen anybody play the game harder,\u201d said Nurse. \u201cAnd that\u2019s any place I\u2019ve ever coached. I don\u2019t know any higher compliment I can give the guy than that.\u201d These are challenging times for the Raptors, especially against the only team to beat them during this restart. Boston won once in the seeded schedule and looked impressive while taking the first two in this series. That said, with the exception of the Bucks, the Raptors were the most consistent team in the East all year, a mild surprise considering the loss of Leonard. And now they must rediscover what has worked well for them before this series. A good start is Pascal Siakam, who filled the Kawhi role and had a breakout season where he became an All-Star, yet is shooting below 40 percent (and under 30 percent from deep) and still looking for a signature performance in the playoffs. Norman Powell and Marc Gasol, until Thursday night, also suffered from frequent disappearance, and other than Fred VanVleet, there\u2019s been inconsistency from others in the rotation. \u201cWhen you\u2019re not playing that well either individually or collectively, we (had) to start making some shots,\u201d Nurse said. \u201cIt was just a better performance from us, which I would see as encouraging. It\u2019s a little bit more of who we are and who we\u2019re used to being. For whatever reason we weren\u2019t playing like ourselves. I \u2019 m not making any excuses for them kicking our butt. We needed to play better. It looks like we might be ready to start playing better. \u201cGive the Celtics credit, they\u2019re playing great, they\u2019re disrupting. Boston has played great. They\u2019re really good, got tons of talent and shot-making. They brought it to us and we didn\u2019t have any answers. They\u2019ve been playing great and I imagine they\u2019ll continue playing great, maybe a little harder. When you\u2019re upset, as I\u2019m sure they are right now, you become more aggressive. That would be a natural response from them after that game.\u201d The Raptors know what they just did. They prevented this series from being over. Going down 0-3 in a best-of-seven means you start the engine on the bus ride home. It\u2019s not that Toronto is off the griddle just yet; Tatum and Jaylen Brown and Marcus Smart are quite the obstacle to overcome. What the Raptors must do is bring a game-face to Saturday\u2019s contest, similar to the no-big-deal expression worn by Anunoby right after making that shot. The young forward just casually turned and walked toward the Toronto bench without any joy, like nothing happened. \u201cThat has to be one of the most classic reactions of all times,\u201d said Nurse. \u201cI remember one other that was similar, when Larry Bird was a coach (with the Pacers). I think it was probably Reggie (Miller) who hit a step back three to win the game and Larry didn\u2019t move, didn\u2019t blink. It\u2019s a cool moment and it\u2019s nice for our team.\u201d * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

Woodson was one of the assistant coaches announced Friday by the Knicks, who hired Thibodeau as their coach last month. The Knicks had already said that longtime Kentucky assistant Kenny Payne had left John Calipari\u2019s staff to join Thibodeau. They have now added Johnnie Bryant as associate head coach, and Woodson and Andy Greer as assistant coaches. Woodson originally joined Mike D\u2019Antoni\u2019s staff as an assistant for the 2011-12 season, becoming the interim coach when D\u2019Antoni resigned in March of that season. He guided the Knicks on an 18-6 finishing kick to earn a playoff spot and the full-time job. He then led New York to a 54-28 record in 2012-13, winning the franchise\u2019s first Atlantic Division title since 1994. The Knicks beat Boston to reach the second round of the postseason for the only time since 2000. But the Knicks hired Phil Jackson as president late in the 2013-14 season and he didn\u2019t retain Woodson after the Knicks narrowly missed the playoffs. They haven\u2019t returned to the postseason since, a seven-year drought that matches the longest in franchise history. Woodson went on to work on Doc Rivers\u2019 staff with the Los Angeles Clippers from 2014-18. Greer is also a former Knicks assistant, working there from 2001-03, and was later an assistant to Thibodeau in both Chicago and Minnesota. Bryant spent the last six seasons as an assistant with the Utah Jazz, who lost in the first round of the playoffs. Also, Daisuke Yoshimoto was hired as an assistant to the head coach. Thibodeau said in a statement that the Knicks are assembling a staff that will \u201cembody everything we want to be about: accountability, development, teaching and a winning culture.\u201d"},{"id":25844,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/villanova-saddiq-bey-tailor-made-nba","date":"2020-09-04","title":"The versatile game of Saddiq Bey is tailor-made for modern NBA","content":"Saddiq Bey\u2019s farewell remarks when he announced in June he\u2019d be leaving Villanova for the NBA Draft were anything but typical. One word in his opening line spoke volumes about who he is, and what kind of player the team that drafts him in October is getting. \u201cI have thought a lot about my decision to enter the NBA Draft,\u201d Bey said, \u201cand specifically how that would impact my coaching staff, teammates and professors.\u201d Suffice it to say if most players who announce for the Draft allow their professors to enter into their decision about whether they stay or go, they keep it to themselves. That Bey chose to consider his instructors and give them a shout out tells us that, even though he\u2019s leaving higher education behind after just two years, he valued it. \u201cI\u2019ve been blessed to be able to build relationships with professors in my short time at Villanova,\u201d Bey says. \u201cIt\u2019s part of the whole process thing. I wanted to thank them for what they did for me over those two years. That definitely entered into my decision. I was fortunate enough to have great professors and I\u2019ll always be appreciative of what they did for me.\u201d Bey, a 6-foot-8 prototypical NBA wing player, has always understood the benefits of a good education thanks to his mother Drewana Bey, who played college basketball at Charlotte, went on to earn a PhD in educational leadership, became a high school principal, and is now the instructional superintendent of secondary schools in the Washington, D.C. public system. You don\u2019t reach that station in life without working hard. Bey\u2019s mother showed him that by example. Why is this important for Bey\u2019s future NBA employer? Bey, after first having signed with NC State before leaving after that program became embroiled in the FBI\u2019s investigation of college basketball recruiting in 2018, chose carefully the second time around. He wanted to go to a place where he could learn in the classroom and the court, and where hard work and a desire to get better were part of the philosophy. That\u2019s why he chose Villanova. Seldom does a pairing of player and school mesh so perfectly. Villanova coach Jay Wright has built a formidable program by recruiting players who are content to wait their turn, work hard, accept skills coaching, and be ready to shine when their time comes. So it was for Bey, who willingly accepted the role of defender and rebounder when he was a freshman. Phil Booth and Eric Paschall were the Wildcats\u2019 big guns then, but Bey, who played nearly 30 minutes a game, made his contributions, too, averaging 8.2 points and shooting a rock-solid .374 from 3-point range. After Booth and Paschall presided over a team that finished 26-10 and 13-5 in the Big East, Bey knew he was the next man up. He trained accordingly in the summer of 2019. \u201cBy the end of that summer, you look up and see he\u2019s gained 15 pounds of muscle,\u201d says Villanova assistant Kyle Neptune. \u201cHis handle had gotten better, his jump shot was better, and he was way more confident.\u201d Bey\u2019s preparation paid huge dividends. Last season he doubled his scoring average as the Wildcats won a share of the Big East regular-season championship, earning All-Big East honors and eventually the Julius Erving Award, given to the nation\u2019s top small forward. That put him in the best of company at a school that churns out Erving Award winners\u2014Josh Hart (2017) and Mikal Bridges (2018) had been anointed previously. Two other things stood out about Bey\u2019s final season at Villanova. Despite the NCAA\u2019s longer 3-point line\u2014moved from 20 feet nine inches to 22 feet, 1 \u00be inches for the 2019-20 season\u2014he increased his percentage to 45.1, fourth in the nation. And defensively, he became the Wildcats\u2019 stopper. Bey was smart enough as a freshman to figure out defense and rebounding would be the first things to get him on the court. Even as he was increasing nearly every important offensive statistic from his first season, he never forgot the value of versatility, and of being able to guard. \u201cHe\u2019s a legitimate 6-8 with guard skills,\u201d Neptune says. \u201cWe played him at every position while he\u2019s been here. He was our third point guard. But defensively \u2026 he guarded everybody. As assistants we did the [opponent] scouts and we always tried to match up with the other team\u2019s best player. Who should be guarding this guy? And it was always Saddiq. If it was the point guard, Saddiq would guard him. If it was a two or three man, Saddiq would guard them. If the best player was a four man, Saddiq would guard him, too.\u201d While Bey became a stopper, he also became an offensive player that was No. 1 on opponent\u2019s scouting reports. But few could handle him and that deadly jumper. So all the ingredients are there for the next level\u2014size, length, the ability to play multiple positions and guard them, too, and shooting range. \u201cI literally can\u2019t say enough about him being a perfect match for what the NBA is doing right now,\u201d Neptune says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what position\u2014if you can\u2019t dribble, pass, shoot and guard on the perimeter, there really isn\u2019t room for you now in the modern NBA. But because Saddiq has the size, the skill, and the willingness to always be in the gym working to get better, he\u2019s going to succeed at the next level.\u201d Bey plans to take what he learned at Villanova and apply it to the NBA. \u201cComing into Villanova, I wanted to give the team what it needed from me,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the NBA, my goal is to try and be as versatile as possible and complete a player as I can possibly be. Whatever the team needs from me, I feel comfortable I\u2019ll be able to provide it. That\u2019s a tribute to how we develop at Villanova.\u201d * * * Chris Dortch is the editor of the Blue Ribbon College Basketball Yearbook .

Like, if you\u2019re late getting in a request to attend a team practice, T-Frank will send you an email or text that\u2019ll begin \u201chey pal\u201d and you better believe his fingers hit those keys really hard. So don\u2019t mess with the man. But T-Frank just delivered a message that was totally good news. He said: \u201cWhen you leave here, you can keep your press credential.\u201d I should explain. The NBA security is super-sensitive and so when you leave this Walt Disney World campus, they want that press pass, probably to avoid duplication by any unscrupulous reporters (seriously, we would do that?). But because I\u2019ve been getting my practice requests in on time, or maybe T-Frank just rolled out of the right side of the bed, he worked some back channels and the NBA will send my credential to me at a later date. Of course, you\u2019re asking: What\u2019s the big deal? So I guess I should explain further. My credential has been my constant and daily (and required) partner through this entire process. I\u2019ve changed shirts, shoes, underwear (thank goodness) and socks, but never the credential. We\u2019ve become inseparable, like Brook and Robin Lopez of the Bucks. There\u2019s another reason this is a must-keepsake: This and other credentials tell my professional story better than I could. In fact, I\u2019ve saved several hundred of them over the decades and many are framed on my office wall back home. They make for a striking optic, all the different colors, shapes, sporting events and also shades of me, since I had plenty of hair on the old credentials and a far more handsome face. The special ones are front-and-center in the frame. They include: The Mike Tyson-Evander Holyfield \u201cbite fight,\u201d Wimbledon, Michael Jordan\u2019s two retirements from the Bulls, Jack Nicklaus\u2019 final British Open, two from the NBA\u2019s games in South Africa, several from the golf and tennis US Opens, several from the Masters, every Summer and Winter Olympic Games I attended and a collection of Super Bowls, Final Fours, World Series, Stanley Cup playoffs, All-Star Games and NBA Finals. I even have credentials to events at arenas and stadiums that no longer exist. That\u2019s a lifetime of work. My most valuable? A football game against the Giants and Chiefs in Kansas City, and not just any game, but the first NFL contest after Sept. 11, 2001, which claimed the life of my brother and thousands of others. Twenty years later, I\u2019m still not sure how I managed the strength to gather my shattered self, get on a plane and then work that game while everyone in the press box stared at me. I got the idea to save credentials from the late Dave Anderson, the revered sports columnist at The New York Times , who emphasized the importance of preserving one\u2019s history. Dave\u2019s most cherished credential was from the Ali-Foreman fight in Zaire back in the 1970s. He said it\u2019s made of bamboo. They\u2019re not just tokens from a sporting event. They\u2019re also reminders of where I was at that point in my life, much like you feel when you hear a favorite song from back in the day. The credential from this NBA restart will instantly go on my personal wall of fame. It will be the most dog-eared credential of the bunch, and it\u2019ll be like DiMaggio\u2019s 56-game hitting streak or Wilt\u2019s 100-point game, because I can\u2019t imagine getting another credential that requires me to wear it for two-plus months. Therefore, I owe Tim Frank a big solid. I\u2019ll start by getting my practice request in on time today. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

Lowry got the Toronto Raptors to that moment, scoring a game-high 31 points on 13-for-23 shooting. And he did it by getting into the paint like he never has in his career. The Raptors were searching for offense. The Celtics had slowed their transition game, and their half-court issues were evident. After scoring 123 points per 100 possessions in their first-round sweep of Brooklyn, the champs had scored just 95.5 through the first two games of this series. Lowry was 1-for-12 from 3-point range, with 18 total points in the paint . Before Game 3, he got some advice from somebody whose name he wouldn\u2019t reveal. \u201cI got a text from a real close friend of mine,\u201d Lowry said, \u201cand he kinda told me, \u2018Stop waiting.\u2019 And that was pretty much the game plan for me tonight, to stop waiting and be aggressive from the jump. He was correct.\u201d > Game 4: Raptors vs. Celtics (Saturday, Sept. 5 at 6:30 ET on TNT) Lowry didn\u2019t exactly catch fire from deep. He was 2-for-8 from 3-point range in Game 3, though one of the makes was a huge pull-up that gave the Raptors a 90-89 lead with 7:15 to go in the fourth quarter. He wasn\u2019t counting on his jump shot, though. Lowry was attacking the basket from the very first possession of the night, when he used a Marc Gasol screen, turned the corner on Kemba Walker, slammed into Marcus Smart (whose feet were still in the restricted area) and pushed a shot over the arms of Daniel Theis . It fell in and Lowry converted the 3-point play. Three possessions later, he took an outlet pass from Gasol and attacked Jayson Tatum in transition, drawing a goaltending violation on Theis. And three possessions after that, Lowry drove past a Tatum close-out and attacked Theis. He bumped the big man under the basket, got him in the air with a pump fake, drew contact, and tossed in a jump hook for another and-one. \u201cHe started with a great burst,\u201d Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. \u201cA great energy to get to the rim the whole night. I thought right from the tip when he turned the corner and got the foul, the and-one, he was ready to go. We didn\u2019t do a good job on him at times, but he\u2019s a really good player. Credit him more than anything else.\u201d Lowry kept the Celtics guessing by not always using the screen, and he scored or assisted on 14 of the Raptors\u2019 first 16 points as they found a rhythm early on. \u201cHe actually broke a couple of the set calls early tonight,\u201d Raptors coach Nick Nurse said, \u201cwhich is a good sign. You\u2019ve got an idea where you can get some buckets in the first few sequences of the game, and he just put his head down and went on a couple of them. Those are good, because they\u2019re kind of like sneak drives. The play is setting up somewhere else and boom, someone takes off. He found a couple of those early and got going.\u201d The Raptors\u2019 offense did not stay in a rhythm. They scored just 19 points on 24 possessions in the second quarter and they were down four with five minutes to go in the third. That\u2019s when their offense got a boost from the Celtics, who had Enes Kanter check in for the first time in the series, presumably to help the Boston offense against Toronto\u2019s zone. The Raptors had Kanter guard pick-and-rolls on six of their next seven half-court possessions, scoring 11 points on the first five of those. And that was the last we saw of Enes Kanter on Thursday. Lowry played pick-and-roll for each of the Raptors\u2019 last six possessions of the third (the last one after Kanter sat down), and then on 10 of the his team\u2019s 20 fourth-quarter possessions prior to Anunoby\u2019s game-winner. \u201cHe just wanted the ball in his hands,\u201d Nurse said. \u201cAnd he wanted to try to hit the big or get in the paint, make the kick-out, or find his own shot. He was commanding the ball there late, and just needed a little help to get free.\u201d Here are the fourth-quarter buckets that the Lowry pick-and-roll produced: 1. Lowry gets a transition screen from Serge Ibaka, gets into the paint, and collapses the defense, helping Fred VanVleet eventually get enough space to drain his second straight 3. 2. VanVleet\u2019s screen gets Walker switched onto Lowry. He backs down the smaller (or lighter) guard and draws the attention of Grant Williams, allowing Pascal Siakam to get good position for a post-up. 3, Lowry drains the aforementioned pull-up 3 after Gasol flips his screen on Smart. 4, With Walker playing Lowry to the side of the oncoming screen from Gasol, Lowry rejects the screen, engages Theis, and hits Gasol rolling to the rim. 5. Gasol\u2019s second screen flattens Smart, and Lowry gets by Theis with a little hesitation for his biggest bucket of the night. Lowry also had a tough baseline drive around a Smart close-out with two minutes left, finishing with seven points and four assists (with no turnovers) in the fourth quarter . \u201cHe had to do a bunch of stuff,\u201d Nurse said. \u201cHe had to come off some [screens]. They were jumping on his side and not letting him get to some, so he had to straight-line attack \u2019em. He had to cross-screen a few because of the same thing when we changed the angle of the picks.\u201d Lowry\u2019s performance \u2014 the 31 points were the most he\u2019s scored in a postseason game since 2016 \u2014 reminded Nurse of the title-clinching Game 6 of last year\u2019s Finals, when his point guard came out firing. But Lowry was 4-for-7 from 3-point range in that game. Thursday\u2019s attack was something different. Lowry\u2019s 20 points in the paint were the most he\u2019s scored in his career , regular season or playoffs (1,007 total games). \u201cI played with a lot different pace tonight,\u201d he said. \u201cI can play a multitude of ways. I can be a pass-first, I can be a score-first, I can be on attack, defense-only. Whatever my team needs, and that\u2019s the most important thing. I think my team needed me to be more aggressive, and that\u2019s what I needed to do tonight.\u201d With the season (essentially) on the line, Lowry played the final 37:29 of Game 3 . And despite all the minutes, he was carrying a heavier load than usual down the stretch, because Nurse was not going to say \u2018No\u2019 to the best player in franchise history. \u201cWe do like to try to move it around a little bit, go from him to Fred to maybe Pascal, him and Fred alternating, just depending on the matchups,\u201d Nurse said. \u201cBut we kind of found a \u2026 well \u2026 Kyle wanted the ball, man. He just wanted the ball. That\u2019s all there is to it.\u201d * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

They were four games deep, Rivers said, before he recognized the crew he believes can win it all. He didn\u2019t have to wait in this time around. The Clippers got off to a great start, clicking on all fronts in a 120-97 rout of the Denver Nuggets in Game 1 of this Western Conference semifinal matchup. The shaky moments that plagued the Clippers against the Mavericks vanished with a few days of rest, against a Nuggets team operating on fumes after the first quarter Thursday. > Game 2: Nuggets vs. Clippers (Saturday, Sept. 5 at 9 ET on TNT) It helped that Rivers had his entire roster intact to open this series, just the 13th time this season that he\u2019s had everyone at his disposal and the first since the season restarted here July 30. Patrick Beverley was back in the starting lineup after missing the the final five games against the Mavericks with a strained calf. Marcus Morris was back on the floor and in a groove, free from having to battle with Mavericks star Luka Doncic. Kawhi Leonard and Paul George were locked in a rhythm from the start. And the bench crew, the best in the league led by Lou Williams and Montrezl Harrell, were back in familiar positions. \u201cI thought we just locked into our assignments,\u201d George said, \u201cTo be honest, that\u2019s the best we\u2019ve done so far against an opponent. Our attention to detail was great and we followed the game plan \u2026 It just took us to lock in tonight and come here and do what we needed to do. There\u2019s no sugar-coating answer or no headline answer. We just locked into what we needed to do, And that was enough for us to play with energy and effort. We just knew what our job was tonight and we executed it.\u201d Beverley played just 12 minutes but finished with eight points, six rebounds and two assists and received universal praise for his presence and energy. All those things were sorely missed from their defensive captain in the first-round series against the Mavericks. \u201cHe gives us energy,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cWe\u2019re not a particularly loud team on the floor defensively. Pat is, in a lot of ways with that starting lineup, a defensive captain with his voice. He calls out coverages, he holds everybody responsible and to have that voice to start games is just invaluable. And then what it does is it just leaks over to the rest of the team. When you see him playing like that and talking like that on defense, it helps the entire team.\u201d Beverley was in agony watching in street clothes. The opportunity to get back into the action for Game 1 energized the Clippers\u2019 energizer. \u201cEveryone has a different role on the team, you might say,\u201d Beverley said. \u201cI take my role very seriously. I understand I\u2019m the point guard, getting guys in the right places offensively, making sure I\u2019m doing my job defensively \u2026 you know, it\u2019s a hard job. But I\u2019m fortunate to be the one to be able to do it. And like I said, sitting out, this injury definitely humbled me, man. I appreciate the game a lot more, for sure.\u201d Rivers reminded his team how much fun this series would be if they moved the ball, paid attention to the details and embraced the challenge ahead. Each game, each win, is another step on the road to a place the Clippers have never been as a franchise: the Western Conference finals. \u201cI think we played alright, I think it works,\u201d Morris said after another particularly effective night on both ends (18 points on 7-for-10 shooting and 4-for-5 on 3-pointers). \u201cWe\u2019re just coming in here every day and working hard. Guys are on the same page. We have high IQ guys, so you know it\u2019s fun. And with a coach like Doc, he\u2019s putting it all together and it\u2019s coming out with a good outcome,\u201d The Nuggets clearly didn\u2019t have the energy needed to deal with the Clippers in the opener. Fresh off of an emotional Game 7 win over Utah Tuesday night in their first-round series, the adrenaline was flowing in a back-and-forth first quarter. The Clippers kept going into the second quarter while fatigue set in on the Nuggets. A 38-20 blitz, including a 23-11 run to end the quarter, blew the game open for good. \u201cJust too much 1-on-1, not enough ball movement, not enough player movement and random offense,\u201d said Nuggets coach Mike Malone. \u201cBut, we were tired. [Friday] we\u2019ll try and give them as much rest as we can and have a more energetic performance come Saturday night.\u201d The Game 2 rebound will need to start with Jamal Murray and All-Star center Nikola Jokic, the stars that carried the Nuggets against the Jazz. Murray scored 145 points, grabbed 20 rebounds and dished out 24 assists in Denver\u2019s four wins in that series. Jokic averaged 26.3 points and 8.1 rebounds this postseason before Thursday night, shooting a blistering 47.8% on 3-pointers. They combined for 27 points on 11-for-29 shooting (2-for-10 from distance), struggling to find the energy that fueled the Nuggets the last time they played. \u201cWe didn\u2019t make shots, we were rushing shots,\u201d Jokic said. \u201cYou could say whatever and it\u2019s going to be true, so, it was just a bad, bad night for us. They affect us but we affect us too. But we can change, we can be better. We can be better.\u201d The Clippers didn\u2019t present anything the Nuggets weren\u2019t expecting. This is a step up in weight class for a team that had to win three straight against the Jazz to make the conference semifinals for the second straight season. The Clippers have been talked about at as a championship favorite since Leonard and George were acquired last summer in free agency and a trade, respectively. There are no secrets here in the bubble, where teams share space in the same hotel and basically everywhere else within the confines of the NBA campus. There\u2019s no escape from the obvious. The Clippers took advantage of a team they knew had just one day to recover and refocus while they had a little extra time to rest and recharge after finishing off the Mavericks Sunday. \u201cIt\u2019s just great, great to have everybody together,\u201d George said, \u201cWe\u2019ve been saying it all year. It\u2019s good for us to just continue to build this chemistry. I thought we looked great tonight. We did everything. Everybody helped. We gad great energy, we were vocal and we just wanted it. We wanted to play for one another. And it was just fun basketball playing with everybody.\u201d * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

Toronto escaped from the brink of a 3-0 series deficit with a 104-103 victory over the Boston Celtics. After the Celtics\u2019 Kemba Walker escaped a Toronto double-team and made a brilliant no-look pass to Daniel Theis for a dunk, the Raptors were down two with only 0.5 seconds left. It wasn\u2019t a lot of time, but it was enough. Raptors coach Nick Nurse had 6-foot point guard Kyle Lowry inbound the ball on the right side of the floor. Celtics coach Brad Stevens had 7-foot-5, third-string center Tacko Fall stand in front of him. The first action on the play was for Anunoby to clear from the right corner to the left corner. Jayson Tatum let him go to stay on the strong side, calling for a teammate to switch onto Anunoby. Jaylen Brown was the closest one, but was alone with Pascal Siakam in the paint. > Game 4: Raptors vs. Celtics (Saturday, Sept. 5 at 6:30 ET on TNT) The primary option was Fred VanVleet curling to the right corner, where he was met by both Tatum and Theis. Marc Gasol set a pin-down screen for Siakam, which Brown and Marcus Smart switched. Theis was left guarding nobody, and Anunoby was still all alone. But he was 53 feet away from Lowry, who still had a 7-foot-5 dude standing in front of him. \u201cI was just waiting,\u201d Lowry said. \u201cJust waiting for the right moment and I seen Jaylen Brown step up a little bit on Marc, and I just had to make a precise pass to a heck of a shooter in OG.\u201d Easier said than done, but Lowry launched a two-handed, soccer-style inbounds pass over the arms of Fall. With the ball 20 feet in the air, Brown turned in the middle of the paint, realizing he was the nearest defender to what was going to be a wide-open corner 3 attempt from a guy who was already 4-for-7 from the left corner in the series. Lowry\u2019s parabolic pass landed right in Anunoby\u2019s lap. \u201cYou say to me, \u2018Why is Kyle taking it out?'\u201d Nurse explained. \u201cI say, \u2018Because he\u2019s got some guts, man.\u2019 You\u2019ve got to make a gutsy play every now and then.\u201d Brown leapt from midway between the paint and the 3-point line, but couldn\u2019t get his hands on the shot, which left Anunoby\u2019s hands with 0.1 on the clock. According to Anunoby: \u201cIt felt good.\u201d Indeed. The shot rattled in, and this is now a 2-1 series heading into Game 4. \u201cThe pass was nothing,\u201d Lowry said. \u201cOG made the shot. All the credit goes to the shot.\u201d \u201cGive OG his flowers tonight, man. Give him his flowers tonight, seriously. Everybody, just give OG his flowers.\u201d And give the Raptors a chance to win this series. No team in NBA history has come down from 3-0, but 2-1 is manageable, and a lot different than how things were looking for the champs Thursday morning. \u201cIt\u2019s been a rough couple of days,\u201d VanVleet admitted. \u201cThe egg we laid in Game 1 and to get beat like that. Then to play really good for about 42 out of 48 minutes in Game 2 and lose, we\u2019ve been pretty hard on ourselves the past couple of days. It hasn\u2019t been pretty.\u201d Things still weren\u2019t looking good after the first half of Game 3, with Boston up 57-47 and Toronto having scored a paltry 19 points on 24 second-quarter possessions. \u201cWe got to the half down 10, and just again weren\u2019t catching any breaks,\u201d Nurse said. \u201cThe ball wasn\u2019t going in. The ball was bouncing funny.\u201d And things were again looking bleak after Theis\u2019 dunk. But the Raptors were focused in their huddle. \u201cThe thing about being in those timeouts,\u201d VanVleet said, \u201cis you just have to feel the belief. And I just felt like the belief never went anywhere, regardless. We had 0.5, and that was enough to get a shot off.\u201d Insert that \u2018ol Rudy Tomjanovich quote here. \u201cTo reach in and find that gustiness for that second half,\u201d Nurse said, \u201cand find it any way, even though it was very fortunate, finding a way, I\u2019m not sure that doesn\u2019t rank up there with our gutsiest performances.\u201d * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

Then OG Anunoby, one of the most pivotal pillars in Toronto\u2019s transition to post-Kawhi life, save the day. DIFFICULTY: The majority of this category is found not in the shot, but in the pass. Kyle Lowry realized Anunoby was neglected on the weak side of the floor and lofted a two-handed pass with enough strength to stay ahead of the off-their-guard defense. The ball landed exactly in Anunoby\u2019s catching pocket, enabling him to take one of the most wide-open, win-or-lose shots in NBA playoff history. >  Game 4: Raptors vs. Celtics (Saturday, Sept. 5 at 6:30 ET on TNT) GAME SITUATION: Toronto\u2019s championship chops showed up big-time, here. They had just watched Kemba Walker slice through their defense and deliver what would have been an all-time no-look assist to take the lead. Only 0.5 seconds remained on the clock. The Raptors\u2019 perimeter players don\u2019t get the casual fan\u2019s notice as knock-down shooters. Six of their regular rotation players shot 38% or better from deep in the regular season. Anunoby and Toronto were ready. CELEBRATION: The team mobbed Anunoby, but it wasn\u2019t a delirious, carry-him-to-the-ground bedlam. The celebration seemed as much about Anunoby as it was about Toronto avoiding the undefeated 3-0 series hole in which Toronto nearly found itself. Anunoby is a product of Toronto\u2019s deservedly praised player development program. His teammates, coaches and front office personnel know he has put in the reps. Thursday was the ultimate example of how that process can pay off. GRADE: They were down 2-0, not 3-0, but Thursday felt like a must-win for Toronto. The Raptors haven\u2019t been able to establish a clear advantage over the Celtics. A second consecutive one-possession loss would have added to the weight entering Game 4 winless. Instead, the Raptors are alive and have a chance to make this a whole new series. 4.5 Horrys .

Tucker provides Rockets' small-ball heart","content":" ORLANDO, Fla. \u2014 Houston Rockets coach Mike D\u2019Antoni got jokes. \u201cWhat do you mean, size disadvantage? I\u2019m as tall as Frank Vogel.\u201d And this: \u201cPJ\u2019s gonna guard both. \u2018P\u2019 will be on Davis and the \u2018J\u2019 will be on LeBron.\u201d OK, then. Any more questions about \u201csmall ball\u201d and P.J. Tucker and the Rockets\u2019 challenge of chopping LeBron James and Anthony Davis and the tall-ball Lakers down to size in this upcoming playoff series? Or does that settle it? For the record, D\u2019Antoni has a few inches on Vogel, the Lakers coach. Now the real issue is Tucker, the critical defensive player in Rockets vs. Lakers, who gives away a combined 9 inches to LeBron and Davis. Remember, they\u2019re both All-Stars, future Hall of Famers and perennial All-NBA choices who destroy game-plans against them. It\u2019s not just about their height, it\u2019s about the enormity of their size and skill and impact. > Game 1: Rockets vs. Lakers (Friday, Sept. 4 at 9 ET on ESPN) In their path will be Tucker, generously listed at 6-foot-5, who\u2019s about the biggest and definitely the toughest player the Rockets will throw their way. Yet he\u2019s minuscule when compared to traditional centers and interior intimidators. Back in the spring, Houston rolled the dice in order to further fortify the vision D\u2019Antoni had for his system: They traded 7-foot center Clint Capela, a reputable defender in the paint but a clog in an offense that emphasized spacing and 3-point shooting. By default, Tucker now gets the big-man assignment, and he\u2019s as incredulous about that as you are. \u201cIf you told me three years ago that I\u2019d be playing center for the Rockets,\u201d he said, \u201cI would\u2019ve laughed at you.\u201d The goal for Tucker against the Lakers is to prevent this series from becoming a laughter. If there\u2019s anyone at 6-foot-5 who\u2019s up for that challenge, it\u2019s Tucker, a hyper competitor who\u2019s triggered at any thought that the Rockets will be hopelessly overwhelmed defensively. \u201cSince you were little kid, you played against grown men,\u201d he said. \u201cJust something you do. It\u2019s basketball, man. It\u2019s being smart, using your size as an advantage. I can get into people. I can get into your stomach, so you can\u2019t back me down. I can stay in front of you, I can move my feet, I can be aggressive. People don\u2019t understand that it can be a disadvantage being tall, too.\u201d He\u2019s 35, an age where decline is lurking around the corner, although Tucker is fighting to stay in prime. He\u2019s a strong and squatty 245 pounds and knows how to leverage his legs and forearms in the post. He\u2019s also quick for his weight and obviously wise here in his 10th NBA season. More than anything, Tucker falls into the category of \u201cPlayer You Need To Have\u201d in your playoff rotation. It\u2019s not just about his basketball smarts and rugged demeanor. The court shrinks this time of the season and the emphasis on half-court play favors him. Tucker\u2019s play in the post-season is traditionally higher than the regular season. In the past, his rebounding rises from 5.6 to 6.9 and his habit of making plays looms as critical once again. As a bonus, his overall shooting (48%) and 3-point shooting (46.7%) are substantially better in the playoffs. The Rockets can get compensation from others if Tucker can\u2019t consistently make the corner 3-pointer, but they have few options if he can\u2019t slow Davis and LeBron. \u201cEverybody makes a big deal about small ball,\u201d said Tucker. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve guarded Anthony Davis every time I\u2019ve played him, since he first came into the league. There is no difference. Really doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s all going to come down to making them take the shots we want them to take. You don\u2019t want give anyone 3s, and don\u2019t want to give anyone layups. \u201cEvery game gonna be different. What we do will have changes, you never know in the playoffs. We\u2019ll make adjustments.\u201d Tucker will start on Davis and rotate when necessary on LeBron, who\u2019ll draw Robert Covington initially. The idea is to keep switching and give those Laker superstars different looks and body types and levels of physicality, and also avoid collecting fouls, since the Rockets aren\u2019t deep in defenders. Since Covington was acquired at midseason and doesn\u2019t bring the same body of defensive work, Tucker is the Rockets\u2019 most proven defender against big men. \u201cJust his tenacity, not giving up on a play, using his strength, just a combination of that,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said. \u201cWhat he misses in height, he makes up with will and a big heart. Look, if you want to play great defense and bring the skills to do that, you also need the mindset, and he obviously\u2019s got that.\u201d  He\u2019ll need it. LeBron and Davis are coming off a stellar first round, where they showed the expected 1-2 punch that makes the Lakers a title favorite. They averaged a combined 57 points and nearly 20 rebounds against the Blazers, and Portland had height with Jusuf Nurkic and Hassan Whiteside. LeBron and Davis are solid off the dribble and can reach the rim, but also shoot with range. They\u2019re tough for anyone to guard, even the game\u2019s very best defenders. That\u2019s why Tucker, and also Covington, are totally on the spot here. \u201cThere\u2019s advantages and disadvantages to what we do,\u201d said D\u2019Antoni. \u201cThey know what are weakness is. We have to lessen that blow with the tenacity and fight to get it done.\u201d D\u2019Antoni mentioned \u201cweakness\u201d in reference to height only. He believes Tucker will be more than credible; that\u2019s why the Rockets traded Capela to bet big on Tucker in the first place \u201cP.J. was easy just because his whole career he\u2019s been battling big 4s,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said. The system created and perfected by D\u2019Antoni makes for high-scoring games and serves as a stage for James Harden. What it hasn\u2019t done yet is reach the NBA Finals \u2014 not bearing fruit in Houston or an earlier iteration in Phoenix, where D\u2019Antoni coached Steve Nash and Amare Stoudemire. There are certainly other issues the Rockets must address against the Lakers, including whether they can limit turnovers as well as the slippage in shooting by Russell Westbrook. Obviously, keeping LeBron in check is high on the list. \u201cHe is who he is,\u201d Tucker said. \u201cLeBron is going to try to pick you apart.\u201d Overall, the small-ball system will be on trial once again in the postseason. Not that the Rockets are claiming to have second thoughts. \u201cWe\u2019re more secure and more confident in how we play,\u201d said D\u2019Antoni. \u201cThey\u2019re the biggest team we\u2019ll see, so it\u2019ll be a challenge, but we\u2019re real confident in what we\u2019re doing.\u201d There\u2019s nothing Tucker can do about his height; he\u2019s stuck at 6-foot-5. However, if he doesn\u2019t rise to the challenge of LeBron and Davis, the Lakers will be a step closer to The Finals \u2026 and small-ball to extinction. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

The 6-foot-3 guard is the second player to win the Rookie of the Year Award with the Grizzlies, joining Pau Gasol (2001-02). Morant received 99 first-place votes from a global panel of 100 sportswriters and broadcasters and earned 498 total points. Miami Heat guard Kendrick Nunn finished in second place with 204 points. New Orleans Pelicans forward Zion Williamson received one first-place vote and finished in third place with 140 points. Players were awarded five points for each first-place vote, three points for each second-place vote and one point for each third-place vote. The voting was conducted based on regular-season games played through March 11. The seeding games, which were played July 30 \u2013 Aug. 14 as part of the season restart, did not count toward voting for the Kia NBA Rookie of the Year Award or the league\u2019s other traditional end-of-season awards. From the beginning of the season through March 11, Morant led all qualified NBA rookies in scoring (17.6 ppg) and assists (6.9 apg) and shot 49.1 percent from the field in 59 games. During that period, Morant was one of three NBA players to average at least 17.0 points and 6.0 assists and shoot 49.0 percent or better from the field, joining 2020 NBA All-Stars LeBron James of the Los Angeles Lakers and Nikola Joki\u0107 of the Denver Nuggets. In games played through March 11, Morant recorded a rookie-high 11 double-doubles and produced the only triple-double by a rookie when he finished with 27 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists against the Washington Wizards on Feb. 9. He had at least 20 points and 10 assists in seven games, including a 27-point, 14-assist performance against the Lakers on Feb. 29. Morant excelled late in games, ranking sixth in the NBA in fourth-quarter scoring average (7.3 ppg) in games played through March 11. Of the top six players in that category, Morant had the highest fourth-quarter field goal percentage (55.9).     Honored as the Kia NBA Western Conference Rookie of the Month in October\/November, December and January, Morant joined Gasol as the only rookies in Grizzlies history to earn monthly accolades three or more times. Morant, the No. 2 overall pick in NBA Draft 2019 presented by State Farm, also broke the franchise rookie record for total assists in a season, reaching the milestone in his 48th game. With Morant leading the team in points and assists, the Grizzlies posted a 32-33 record in games played through March 11 and began the season restart in eighth place in the Western Conference. In last season\u2019s 82-game schedule, Memphis went 33-49 and finished tied for 12th place in the conference. Morant, who turned 21 in August, receives the Eddie Gottlieb Trophy as the Kia NBA Rookie of the Year.

If things go the way the Brooklyn Nets hope, the better answer over time will be: Nash\u2019s. But the Nets and their newly named coach have a long, long way to go. So in the meantime, sports fans will continue to hash out that debate over chicken wings or craft brews. Unless someone cops out by saying \u201ceither\u201d or \u201cboth.\u201d The point of the question always has been to flush out a person\u2019s sports values. Many would choose Nash\u2019s fantastic individual career, with his undersized overachievement, his jaw-dropping style of play, those back-to-back NBA Most Valuable Player Awards in 2005 and 2006 and his enshrinement in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame the instant he became eligible. An eight-time All-Star playing for Dallas and Phoenix, Nash, 46, boosted the NBA\u2019s profile in Canada, where he grew up, back when the Toronto Raptors still were learning to dribble and chew gum. Oh, and there\u2019s the $147 million he earned in his playing days. In spite of all that, some would choose Kerr and would have done so even before he became the coach who led the Golden State Warriors to five consecutive Finals and three championships from 2015 through 2019. Kerr\u2019s career as a player is the crux of the question: individual acclaim vs. team success. Life spent almost entirely as a bench guy (only 30 starts in 910 games) with meager stats (6.0 points, 1.8 assists per game) that pale next to Nash\u2019s. He showed up four times to hoist 3-pointers on All-Star Saturday but never on Sunday. Career earnings? Approximately $16 million as a player, about 11% of Nash\u2019s fortune. But five trips to The Finals with the Bulls and the Spurs and five rings, to Nash\u2019s none and none, clinches it for the Kerr crowd. What the Nets are hoping is that Nash, with no prior coaching experience, can transfer the All-Star and MVP specialness he had as one of the league\u2019s greatest point guards to their roster mix of exciting young players, some helpful veterans and a pair of future Hall of Famers in Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving. Brooklyn, based on its injuries and an in-season coaching change (from Kenny Atkinson to interim Jacque Vaughn in March), overachieved in its own way in 2019-20, finishing 35-37 and winning five of its first seven in the Disney restart bubble to nail down the East\u2019s No. 7 seed. Getting swept from the first round by Toronto simply got the Nets started sooner on their reset for next season, whenever it comes. That surprised no one. The Nash hiring, on the other hand, surprised most of the NBA. His name had not come out publicly as a candidate in general manager Sean Marks\u2019s coaching search. And Nash since his retirement as a player in 2014 had brushed aside queries about his coaching interest, talking about family time while throwing himself into soccer, broadcasting and film production pursuits. His selection \u2013 without previous professional coaching experience \u2013 immediately sparked criticism Thursday, as did Nash\u2019s race. Currently five of the 26 filled NBA coaching jobs are held by African Americans. Four openings remain: Chicago, Indiana, New Orleans and Philadelphia. Twitter quickly had alternative candidates\u2019 names trending, including former NBA players who also have worked as head or assistant coaches: Mark Jackson, Jason Kidd, Tyronn Lue, Sam Cassell, Adrian Griffin, Darvin Ham and others. One thing we do know about the Nets job, though, was that nobody was getting hired without Durant and Irving signing off on the move. Their games are too important to the franchises, their personalities too strong. It helps that Durant has a solid relationship with Nash from the former point guard\u2019s five years as a player development consultant with Golden State. Irving? Well, he has shown limited appreciation of coaches with lesser resumes than his own. That at least will get put to the test in 2020-21. While the NBA currently is long on grinders who apprenticed on somebody else\u2019s staff or made their coaching bones in college, it hasn\u2019t been unusual for former players to snag jobs with no legit prior experience. Jackson, Kidd, Doc Rivers and Kerr himself skipped those steps. If anything, Nash is the beneficiary of \u201cMVP privilege,\u201d a tradition that has seen some of the game\u2019s legends hired to work the sidelines. Eight former NBA MVP winners, including four of the 13 men who won that award multiple times, had served as coaches. Combined, the results are not pretty: a record of 1,116-1,282 (.465) in regular season games. In the playoffs, 76-66 (.535). The postseason numbers are tilted a little by Bill Russell, whose personal records as a coach were 341-290 (.540) and 34-27 (.557). But to be fair, in his first three seasons he won two NBA championships with the Celtics because he had the great Bill Russell playing for him, too. Players were allowed to do both back then. Meanwhile, six more \u2013 Bob Cousy (141-207), Wes Unseld (202-345), Wilt Chamberlain (37-47 in the ABA), Willis Reed (82-124), Dave Cowens (161-191) and Magic Johnson (5-11) \u2013 did better as elite players than they did instructing others. The trend of great players, mediocre coaches has been demonstrated across sports, too, including the NHL (Wayne Gretzky), the NFL (Bart Starr) and MLB (Ted Williams). There\u2019s more to it than sprinkling the pixie dust of one\u2019s talents on the people on your roster. Maybe we\u2019ll see some day, maybe we won\u2019t, how it goes for San Antonio legend Tim Duncan, who actually has been logging gym and video time on Gregg Popovich\u2019s staff. The best of the MVP coaches: Larry Bird, who had 147-67 (.687) and 32-20 (.615) records in three seasons with Indiana, getting that team to the Finals in 2000 before stepping down. Bird had no problem grabbing the attention of the Pacers\u2019 players with his reputation and his insights into the work required for greatness. He also made sure he had strong Xs & Os lieutenants in Dick Harter and Rick Carlisle. With staff sizes ballooning in the 20 years since Bird last coached, Nash will have no excuse for not surrounding himself with capable, veteran assistants along with recent ex-players to help with relationships and overall buy-in. He reportedly reached out to former teammate Dirk Nowitzki, but the future Hall of Famer isn\u2019t looking for full-time coaching this soon. Nash\u2019s time spent running Mike D\u2019Antoni\u2019s ballyhooed \u201cseven seconds or less\u201d attack in Phoenix and immersed in the Warriors\u2019 3-point driven small ball tactics should serve him well. Better yet, his game was built on guile, vision, anticipation, geometry, conditioning, an awareness of his teammates\u2019 and opponents\u2019 strengths and weaknesses and a relentless competitive streak. All of those qualities are available to players, Nets or otherwise, who are willing to work hard enough. Brooklyn\u2019s foundation was laid by Kenny Atkinson, by Vaughn (who will remain as the lead assistant), by Marks and by the players who have made it into the past two offseasons. Nash has everything he needs \u2013 the demeanor, the knowledge, the feel \u2013 to take the Nets a step or three beyond that. Just so he stays away from any rings throwdown with his star forward or, especially, his point guard. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Per ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski, Nash has signed a four-year deal in what will be his first jaunt into coaching an NBA team full-time. Nash joins the Nets following five seasons as a player development consultant with the Golden State Warriors, where he contributed to two championship teams and made four consecutive trips to The Finals. Per Wojnarowski, Nets owner Joe Tsai and general manager Sean Marks had been aggressive in recruiting Nash to make the move to coaching. In Brooklyn, Nash will be leading a Nets team filled with talented scorers, including former Kia MVP and Finals MVP Kevin Durant and All-Star guard Kyrie Irving. That made the Nets vacancy an attractive position, and Marks said he met with a number of highly accomplished candidates. There was even speculation the Nets would try to entice Spurs coach Gregg Popovich, for whom Marks played and then worked under in San Antonio. Instead, Marks turned to one of his former teammates. \u201cAfter meeting with a number of highly accomplished coaching candidates from diverse backgrounds, we knew we had a difficult decision to make,\u201d Marks said in a statement released by the Nets. \u201cIn Steve we see a leader, communicator and mentor who will garner the respect of our players. I have had the privilege to know Steve for many years. \u201cOne of the great on-court leaders in our game, I have witnessed firsthand his basketball acumen and selfless approach to prioritize team success. His instincts for the game, combined with an inherent ability to communicate with and unite players towards a common goal, will prepare us to compete at the highest levels of the league. We are excited to welcome Steve, Lilla, Lola, Bella, Matteo, Luca and Ruby to Brooklyn.\u201d https:\/\/twitter.com\/BrooklynNets\/status\/1301518544937652224 In addition, the team announced that Jacque Vaughn will return to Brooklyn as lead assistant coach. One of Nash\u2019s former teammates, future Hall of Famer and Dallas Mavericks legend Dirk Nowitzki, was reportedly someone Nash wanted to add to his coaching staff. Per Marc Stein of The New York Times , Nowitzki is not looking to return to the NBA so soon after retiring following the 2018-19 season and declined the offer. https:\/\/twitter.com\/TheSteinLine\/status\/1301580166540394496 \u201cI am honored to have this opportunity with such a first-class organization and would like to thank Sean, Joe and his wife, Clara, for having faith in my ability to lead this team forward,\u201d Nash said. \u201cCoaching is something I knew I wanted to pursue when the time was right, and I am humbled to be able to work with the outstanding group of players and staff we have here in Brooklyn. I am as excited about the prospects of the team on the court as I am about moving to Brooklyn with my family and becoming impactful members of this community.\u201d The Nets reached the postseason despite having Irving for only 20 games and Durant for none, but the two stars who came to Brooklyn together last summer are expected to be ready for the 2020-21 season. Vaughn finished out the season as coach and did as well as anyone could have expected, leading the Nets to a 5-3 record in the NBA\u2019s restart in Florida before they were swept by the Toronto Raptors. He started 2-0 after replacing Kenny Atkinson in March, including a victory over the Lakers in Los Angeles, and picked up victories over the powerful Bucks and Clippers at Walt Disney World. An eight-time NBA All-Star, Nash played 18 seasons with the Phoenix Suns, Dallas Mavericks and Los Angeles Lakers. He won back-to-back MVP awards in 2005 and 2006 while playing for the Suns, becoming just the 10th player in NBA history to win the award in consecutive seasons. Nash was named to All-NBA teams seven times throughout his career, earning first-team honors three times (2005-07), while twice being named to the second (2008, 2010) and third teams (2002, 2003).  A five-time assist champion, Nash currently ranks third in NBA history with 10,335 career assists. The culmination of his brilliant playing career came in 2018 when Nash was enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. \u201cWe are excited to welcome Steve to the Nets family and look forward to a successful and meaningful partnership,\u201d Tsai said in a statement released by the team. \u201cSteve shares our vision for the future of this franchise and his character exemplifies the core principles of our organization in working to serve our communities. I can\u2019t wait for Steve to get started.\u201d Having grown up in Victoria, British Columbia, Nash is one of the most accomplished figures in Canadian basketball history. He was a member of Team Canada from 1993-2004 and served as general manager for the senior national team from 2012-19. Nash played collegiately for four seasons at Santa Clara University prior to being selected 15th overall in the 1996 NBA Draft.

Perhaps Oklahoma City Thunder coach Billy Donovan shared similar feelings on the other side regarding Eric Gordon and Robert Covington, as three of the most unheralded players in Wednesday\u2019s Game 7 created the most significant impact for their respective teams in Houston\u2019s nail-biting 104-102 win . Dort racked up a game-high and career-high 30 points for the Thunder, while Gordon and Covington paced the Rockets with 21 apiece. Houston advances to the Western Conference semifinals, where it faces the well-rested Los Angeles Lakers on Friday ( 9 ET, ESPN ). \u201cRight now, Game 7s, especially, it\u2019s not about how good you play,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said. \u201cIt\u2019s how hard you play and how engaged you are. It\u2019s more brains and heart, and not talent. I thought everybody fought out there.\u201d D\u2019Antoni\u2019s remarks specifically reflected his thoughts on the Rockets, but they certainly apply more broadly. That\u2019s especially true considering how the chaotic finish played out with the night\u2019s biggest star, James Harden, struggling all night before finally sealing the victory from the defensive end in the waning seconds. In a Game 7 chockful of star power with two former Kia MVPs (Harden and Russell Westbrook) and a future Hall of Fame point guard (Chris Paul), nobody in Las Vegas would have bet on Dort, Gordon and Covington being Game 7\u2019s top scorers. \u201cIn the playoffs, man, each game in the series different guys will be able to step up,\u201d Westbrook said. \u201cIt\u2019s not always the main guys that make plays down the stretch and throughout the game. We have a lot of those guys on our team.\u201d Houston sorely needed them, too, to take this series-deciding victory. Struggling all night offensively, Harden shot 4 of 15 and 1 of 9 from 3-point range to finish with 17 points, while Westbrook contributed his 20 points on 9-of-20 shooting and 0-for-2 from deep. They also combined for six turnovers, which made the contributions from Gordon and Covington more timely. In a fourth quarter featuring three ties and four lead changes, Covington knocked down a 26-footer to put Houston ahead by 3 with 6 minutes and 53 seconds remaining, before nailing one of two free throws with 1.4 seconds left to extend the Rockets\u2019 lead. Gordon, meanwhile, entered the game shooting 8 of 43 from 3-point range this series, before turning that around in Game 7 with a 5-of-9 performance from deep. Perhaps Gordon\u2019s most significant contribution came from him locking down Paul in the clutch with the game on the line. Paul hit a pair of free throws with 7:11 remaining to tie the score at 96. He wouldn\u2019t score again. \u201cEverybody did something great,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said. \u201cThe way Eric guarded Chris Paul towards the end was terrific. Cov[ington] had some big plays.\u201d Covington and Gordon combined for four blocks and four steals to play prominent roles in Houston enjoying a 28-12 advantage in points off turnovers. Covington also secured a team-high 10 rebounds, as the Rockets outscored the Thunder 14-8 on second-chance points. \u201cHe was excellent tonight on both ends of the ball,\u201d Harden said. Had OKC captured the victory, Dort\u2019s performance would\u2019ve garnered the lion\u2019s share of headlines. Known mostly for his solid defense on Harden this series, Dort shot 3-of-16 from the field and 0-of-9 from 3-point range in Game 5, before bouncing back in Game 6 with 13 points, including 10 in the third quarter of that victory. In Game 7, Dort put the clamps on Harden while providing his own fireworks, offensively, against a Houston defense that was content most of the series with him taking open shots. Dort hit 10 of 21 from the field and 6 of 12 from 3-point range in Game 7. \u201cIt was one of the most impressive things that I\u2019ve seen out of a player that young,\u201d Donovan said. \u201cHere\u2019s a guy that was in the G League. He never got drafted, was a two-way player. And here he comes up, and we have some injuries. Everybody knows the story: [he] comes into the starting lineup. In a significant playoff [Game 5], he goes 3-for-16 and 0-for-9. If that doesn\u2019t show you the mental toughness of a guy to be able to come back and play as well as he did in Game 6 after that Game 5, and then come back today to play even better, and to also focus on guarding James Harden, I was really impressed with him.\u201d It\u2019s important to retrace Dort\u2019s background here to illuminate the brightness of his future in this league. An undrafted rookie out of Arizona State playing on a two-way contract earlier this season, Dort spent a good portion of the first half of the season in the NBA G League with the Oklahoma City Blue before becoming a full-time starter in January. OKC finally signed Dort in June to a multiyear contract, and on Wednesday, he scored the third-most points by a rookie in a Game 7, while producing the most points in a Game 7 for a player under the age of 22. To put that last number in perspective, consider that LeBron James (27 points) and Kobe Bryant (25) rank second and third, respectively, on that list. Wearing a t-shirt emblazoned with a picture of Bob Marley and the words \u201cGet up, Stand Up,\u201d Dort wiped away tears while discussing his journey. \u201cThis team just gave me a lot of confidence,\u201d he said . \u201cThe vets, they just gave me a lot of confidence. They really trusted me. It\u2019s a blessing just to be here. Dennis [Schroder] is one of the guys who really trusted me from the beginning. \u201cI remember the first game I played against Minnesota, and he really talked to me about how I could impact this game at this level. Just the way he was talking to me just really helped for the whole season. My teammates and my coach really believed in me. This really helped. I know it was a big game, and I live to play games like that. It didn\u2019t go our way. It hurts. But I can\u2019t wait for the future. There\u2019s a lot that can happen.\u201d * * * Michael C.

Anyway, to the point: Harden had enough playoff energy to provide a pair of leaps in the air Wednesday in the final seconds of a first-round Game 7 that saved the Rockets\u2019 season. The first leap: He soared and softly rejected the go-ahead shot attempt by Luguentz Dort, the unassuming rookie Thunder role player who haunted Houston in this game with 30 points. The second leap: After Dort recovered the ball, he tried to throw it off Harden\u2019s body so it could go out of bounds and give Oklahoma City one last try. But Harden jumped again, spread eagle, and dodged the ball to allow the Rockets to dodge an embarrassing elimination. So, although these are the playoffs, and the second round is beckoning, no, Harden doesn\u2019t appear to be whipped, neither literally or figuratively. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to advance, excited to be where we\u2019re at,\u201d Harden said. But a little more than a year ago this time, he was indeed tired \u2014 of Chris Paul. And this led to a divorce that could prevent Harden and the Rockets from going much further here at Walt Disney World. Yes, the record will show that Harden is now moving on to face the Lakers, and Paul is now going home, and if they had worked out their differences and remained teammates, maybe they\u2019d be the favorite to go to The Finals. That\u2019s because the most impactful player in the Rockets-Thunder series wasn\u2019t Harden, a former Kia MVP who shot 4-for-15 Wednesday ; and certainly not Russell Westbrook, also a former MVP who now owns a broken jumper; but Paul, the former teammate Harden no longer had any use for. Paul is the main reason Harden had to sweat out this series. It was his greatness that stretched this and the Rockets to the suspenseful limit. Two nights after his amazing fourth quarter that forced a do-or-die game, Paul spooked Harden again by delivering a triple-double and at age 35 becoming the oldest ever to do so in a Game 7. The evidence is in and it\u2019s very compelling: Paul is not poorly conditioned, as was previously believed at the time Houston swapped him for Westbrook last summer, nor is his body breaking down. And after a stirring season that saw his leadership and overall play boost an OKC team that was targeted for rebuilding, Paul\u2019s career didn\u2019t careen off a cliff, either; he remained an elite point guard who should make an All-NBA team in 2019-20. He hooped. Oh, what they could\u2019ve done together, a pair of desperate future Hall of Famers still in their prime and tricky with the ball, surrounded by complimentary teammates who\u2019d give coach Mike D\u2019Antoni\u2019s small-ball system more than a fighting chance at a championship. Instead, Harden\u2019s bringing Westbrook \u2014 who lacks Paul\u2019s shooting range and court savvy \u2014 to a basketball war against LeBron James and Anthony Davis. This isn\u2019t expected to end well for Harden, still searching for his first Finals appearance, let alone championship, since joining the Rockets and becoming a true superstar. How many more chances will he get? How many more times must the Rockets find him the ideal co-star, now that Dwight Howard and Paul didn\u2019t work out? On that last point, keep in mind that in addition to trading Paul, the Rockets also traded their future, forking over multiple first-round picks to OKC to sweeten the pot. This makes the Harden-Westbrook era a must-win, or risk the real possibility of Harden going into his mid-30s without enough assets around him to retool for a third time. Harden and Paul were teammates for two years, a mixture of great expectation and painful fate. They set the franchise record with 65 wins their first season, followed up with 53 and a division title. If not for Paul\u2019s hamstring injury in the 2018 playoffs, maybe they win it all. The following season, they lost again to the Golden State Warriors, no shame there. But philosophical differences in that second season, especially that playoff loss to the Warriors, ruined a basketball relationship that seemed ideal on paper. Suddenly, a pair of playmakers who made insurance commercials together no longer wanted to break bread. And this was on Harden if only because, clearly, he runs the Rockets. It\u2019s his team, operating in his vision. And Paul no longer fit. It\u2019s certainly possible that a Harden-Paul team would see a more favorable road to The Finals than in the two seasons they were together. LeBron and Davis are obviously a load, but not more than those Warriors teams. Now it\u2019s Harden-Westbrook, close buddies off the court yet still largely unproven in the playoff sense on the court. Westbrook remains an explosive, change-of-pace player, yet that\u2019s now his only weapon: to attack the rim. With his 3-point shooting fading fast \u2014 he\u2019s down to 20 percent now \u2014 defenders aren\u2019t even pretending to press him tight at the arc. Westbrook is left with little choice but to constantly challenge bigger players in the paint. In that sense, he\u2019s an odd fit in an offense that so heavily relies on floor-spreading and 3-point shooting. \u201cWe can win a variety of ways,\u201d Harden said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t shoot well in games in this series and still had a chance to win. If we can play with that same mindset defensively, the shots will fall. We\u2019ll finally get Russell back in his rhythm, we should be in good hands.\u201d True enough. Westbrook is still mending from a quad injury and said: \u201cI\u2019ll take it one game at a time to find my rhythm.\u201d Would Paul have made those same costly turnovers as Westbrook did late in Game 6 that kept OKC alive for one more game? That would be uncharacteristic for Paul, not so for Westbrook, who can be mistake-prone. \u201cObviously a lot of people doubted us,\u201d Paul said of his first season with the Thunder, \u201cbut we didn\u2019t doubt ourselves. We didn\u2019t give a damn about anybody\u2019s prediction going into any series. In any game, we expected to win. That\u2019s how we played all season long, every game. We fought hard all year.\u201d After the buzzer sounded Wednesday and the Rockets exhaled, it was telling how Paul and Harden took separate paths once again, one year later. Paul made his way around the court to bro-hug most of his former Rockets teammates and staff, wishing them well in the second round. \u201cThey deserved to win,\u201d Paul said. \u201cThey did everything they were supposed to do.\u201d He never approached Harden, though, and instead kept walking into the locker room and toward an autumn offseason. Meanwhile, with only one day to catch his breath, James Harden is onto the next round, against LeBron James and the steep challenge that entails. Without the benefit of a former teammate he stopped endorsing, will Harden still be flushed with playoff zest to make yet another energetic leap, this time a far bigger one? * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

Often, one team got off a final shot at the buzzer, while the other worked awfully hard to contest it. Frequently, that meant some amount of contact. No matter, game after game, year after year, the contact \u2014 certainly, if incidental \u2014 has often been ignored or waved off as the shot bounced away. Such games were allowed to slip into overtime, where the players and coaches got at least five more minutes to determine the outcome. Not Wednesday night, though, in Game 2 of the Eastern Conference semifinal between Milwaukee and Miami . With the score tied at 114 and a network television audience poised for a tasty overtime session between the rattled and desperate Bucks and an increasingly scrappy Heat team, the game \u2014 pffft! \u2014 abruptly ended. Turns out Jimmy Butler, whose last-chance jump shot from the left baseline missed, had been fouled ever-so-slightly as he followed through. Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo had doubled-team Butler in the corner with Wesley Matthews, putting a hand near Butler\u2019s waist that was apparently judged to have gotten under the Miami wing on his landing. So for the Bucks, instead of OT, it was Oh no! Climax, into anti-climax. After a video review, Butler was sent to the line all by himself, nobody along the lane, few in the bubbled building. His first free throw rattled in to win it, his second was for the bettors, and the teams walked off. Milwaukee, down 2-0, is a No. 1 seed in trouble. Miami, the East\u2019s No. 5 seed, already has exceeded most everyone\u2019s expectations besides their own. And instead of five more minutes of intense playoff basketball, viewers were treated to, well, a little history. It\u2019s curious enough that there were 69 overtime games in the 2019-20 regular season, with six that required double OT. Out of those 75 opportunities, not one of them ended on a free throw with :00.0 left on the clock. But none ended like that two seasons ago either. Or three. Or four. You have to go back to March 4, 1991 to find an NBA game that was decided at the foul line with no time left. That night in Dallas, Mavericks guard Rolando Blackman beat the New Jersey Nets. Twenty-nine years. So it was a rare sort of angst the Bucks felt as they stood or sat helplessly by and waited for Butler to decide their night\u2019s fate. \u201cI\u2019d say we\u2019re disappointed with the judgment, the decision, the timing,\u201d said Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer, a little more composed a few minutes after, but his true expression half-masked. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough job. I have a lot of respect for the officials. We have our way of seeing things. We\u2019re going to disagree.\u201d Antetokounmpo had sat down just off the court as the review sent Butler to the line. \u201cI tried to make it tough for Jimmy,\u201d he said. \u201cThe ref said there was contact. Maybe there was. It is what it is. I tried to contest the shot.\u201d Said Butler: \u201cI got fouled. Pushed me in the back. Can\u2019t deny that.\u201d If there was any consolation for Milwaukee in what seemed a soft, ticky-tack verdict against them, it was the fact they benefitted only seconds earlier from a softer, tickier-tackier call against the Heat. Out of a timeout with 7.7 seconds left, Milwaukee\u2019s Khris Middleton rose up for a 3-point shot on the left wing. Miami guard Goran Dragic stood ramrod straight in front of him, both arms upraised, doing that verticality thing the big men do. Middleton missed but his shooting momentum carried him into Dragic, who apparently was whistled for not giving the Bucks shooter sufficient room to land. No easy feat, Middleton hit all three free throws to tie at 4.3 seconds. The Heat were almost as exasperated then as the Bucks would be moments later. Except, of course, they didn\u2019t and wouldn\u2019t lose. \u201cYou\u2019re all over the place emotionally,\u201d Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. Spoelstra acknowledged that the officiating crew of Marc Davis, Sean Wright and Kevin Scott Wednesday had their work cut out for them, as well any other refs who work this series. \u201cNeither team is an easy team to officiate,\u201d Spoelstra said. \u201cYou have aggressive players who are creating contact. You have to do things with incredible discipline and technique. And a lot of these calls, you have to go to a replay almost every single time.\u201d If karma counts, the Bucks and their fans caught two major breaks. One came in the third quarter, when the Bucks won a review that enabled Antetokounmpo to avoid his fourth foul and a certain sitdown. Milwaukee won that quarter, though their star was a minus-8 in the period. Down the stretch, Bucks George Hill and Kyle Korver trapped Butler, who recklessly floated a pass that got picked off by Brook Lopez. The Bucks center made a layup to get his team within 113-111. So the funky finish should not overshadow Miami\u2019s superiority in Game 2 or so far in the series. Seven Heat players scored in double figures, making it impossible for the Bucks to pick their proverbial poison. Butler, after scoring 40 points in Game 1, had 13 this time and seemed almost insignificant until he got very significant. Milwaukee won\u2019t be going anywhere if it lets itself get outscored from 3-point range by 30 points \u2014 the Heat shot 17-for-45, the Bucks 7-for-25. And while the refs at least were consistent in their late-game adjudicating, the Bucks were inconsistent when it mattered most. They went up 91-90 early in the fourth, got outscored 13-2, responded with a 9-2 spurt of their own, then went four minutes without scoring again. Everything was tough because Miami\u2019s defense made it so. The NBA\u2019s Last 2 Minutes report for this one, however, shouldn\u2019t be tough at all. Skip the first 115 seconds, please, and just focus on the final five. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

But in the Western Conference semifinals, the Lakers face an almost fully healthy Houston Rockets squad that seems to be finally catching its small-ball groove behind volume shooting from deep, and a stingier defense than we all expected when the club first made the decision to go all-in on its diminutive style. \u201cWe\u2019re undersized,\u201d said Rockets forward. P.J. Tucker. \u201cOK, so what? The elephant is in the room. It\u2019s always going to be something we\u2019ve got to deal with. We do it on purpose. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s something that somebody just threw on us and we\u2019ve got to deal with it. We choose to be this size. We choose to play the way we play because we feel like we have an advantage. We have multiple advantages by playing that way with our personnel. So, instead of saying how we dealt with being undersized, I think the flip is really how do other people feel about playing against us, how did they feel in their match ups against us? I think that\u2019s more of a question.\u201d We\u2019re about to find out, because as Charles Barkley stated on TNT\u2019s \u201cInside the NBA\u201d, the Lakers present the \u201cultimate test of that small ball,\u201d given their roster chockful of talented bigs in Anthony Davis, Dwight Howard and JaVale McGee, as well as capable wing defenders. 1. Three-point shooting will make the difference for Houston. The Lakers ranked in the bottom-10 in 3-point shooting all season, and the struggles carried over to the bubble, where they ranked 13th among the 16 postseason teams in 3-point percentage (34.3). Houston wasn\u2019t much better than the Lakers in postseason 3-point percentage (11th), but it leads the league in attempts from distance by a large margin. Face it: the Rockets will definitely get up the shots from long range, but if they\u2019re not falling, it could make for some long nights due to their disadvantage on the boards, stemming from their lack of size, and the Lakers\u2019 ability to score in transition . More than 50 percent of Houston\u2019s scoring comes from 3-point range. 2. Can the Lakers score in iso situations? Houston switches everything defensively and headed into Game 6 of its series against Oklahoma City, it ranked No. 1 in that category, surrendering 101.8 points per 100 possessions. Houston\u2019s defensive style forces opponents to make quick decisions or resort to playing iso ball, a facet of the game in which the Rockets have also proven stout this season. LeBron James is the only Laker ranked among the top 10 in iso scoring in the playoffs (6.4 points per game), and Anthony Davis scores 58% of the time in isolation situations through five postseason outings. The Lakers are 30-0 this season when they shoot 50% or better. 3. What style should the Lakers play? Los Angeles possesses the flexibility to match Houston\u2019s small-ball lineup with its own version featuring James at the 4 and Davis at the 5. But it\u2019s worth pondering whether the Lakers actually want to do that and negate their size advantage. Houston won both games against the Lakers, after it fully committed to playing small ball exclusively. But when the teams last played on Aug. 6, both James and McGee sat out. It\u2019s worth noting that when the teams met back in February, the Lakers finished at plus-6 in 16 minutes , as colleague John Schuhmann pointed out, with Davis playing alongside McGee or Howard. In the 24 minutes the Lakers played with Davis at the five, they were minus-10. 120.2 \u2014 After scoring just 103.1 points per 100 possessions over their first nine games in Orlando (eight seeding games plus Game 1 against Portland), the Lakers scored 120.2 per 100 over the last four games of the first round. The biggest difference was their shooting from the outside. After making just 28% of their shots from outside the paint (effective field goal percentage of 38.7%) over those first nine games, the Lakers have shot 43% (57.2%) from the outside over the last four. Those outside-the-paint numbers for Davis and James combined: 25% (effective field goal percentage of 34.0%) in the first nine bubble games, 61% (77.7%) over the last four. That last number is surely not sustainable, and the Rockets will obviously prioritize keeping Davis and James out of the paint. They\u2019ve been a much better defensive team than the Blazers, who ranked 20th (of 22 teams) defensively in the seeding games (120.4 points allowed per 100 possessions). The Rockets ranked seventh defensively (109.1 per 100) in the seeding games and first in the first round , holding the Thunder to just 101.7 per 100. The Rockets were the only West team with a winning record against the Lakers in the regular season, and they had the league\u2019s third-best defense (104.4 allowed per 100) against L.A. But James (the seeding-game meeting) and Davis (the first meeting) each missed one game against Houston. Davis and James didn\u2019t shoot well from the outside against the Rockets, but they took 62% of their combined shots against Houston in the restricted area. That was their second-highest rate against any opponent, lower than only their rate against Cleveland\u2019s 30th-ranked defense (63%). \u2014 John Schuhmann Kudos to Houston coach Mike D\u2019Antoni and general manager Daryl Morey for sticking to their vision while selling the rest of the Rockets on the small-ball revolution. But as well as the supporting cast of Eric Gordon, Robert Covington, Ben McLemore, Jeff Green, Danuel House Jr. and Tucker have played in the postseason, it\u2019ll be a stretch to count on them consistently against this veteran Laker squad with so much playoff experience. You\u2019ll see a couple of brilliant performances from James Harden, and perhaps Russell Westbrook, too, as the Rockets know their championship window is closing. But James and Davis will ultimately emerge in this series as the biggest stars. Lakers in 6 . * * * Michael C. Wright is a senior writer for NBA.com.
