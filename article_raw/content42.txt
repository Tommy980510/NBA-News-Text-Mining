For example, take the Clippers: A teenaged DeAndre Jordan grew too tall for football pads in Texas. Austin Rivers watched his father Doc, the Clippers coach and former NBA player, on TV and took notes. Then there\u2019s the person in charge of running this team. He put funky uniforms in the laundry bin, collected damp socks, made sure the towels were fresh and kept the locker room nice and tidy. \u201cWell, that\u2019s how you start out on the job,\u201d said Lawrence Frank, explaining his to-do list as student manager of his college team at Indiana. \u201cBy the time you\u2019re a senior, you\u2019re assisting the coaches with scouting reports.\u201d The story of Frank\u2019s basketball life, therefore, is how he kept graduating to something more satisfying and challenging as the journey continued. After Indiana he was an assistant coach in college, then in the NBA, then an NBA head coach, and last summer was handed the basketball operations job with the Clippers after a significant restructuring and shakeup at the top of the organization. Beneath the executive two-piece suit, however, lies a basketball dreamer who\u2019s eager to do the grunt work, someone who did so while dealing with the unpredictable whims of the mercurial Bob Knight, and that base will never leave him, Frank says. (Oh, and about Knight: Frank was hired on the spot, sight unseen \u2014 no interview, no nothing \u2014 for his first few coaching jobs out of college because Knight simply placed a call.) \u201cThat was an unbelievable foundation for me, for every step of my career,\u201d he said. \u201cYou appreciate being on the ground floor and it taught me about the chain of command and about respect for others and if you want to be good, it\u2019s about the work you must put into it. You learn the value of teammates, humility, all the things we preach to our kids and teams. Any job isn\u2019t too small.\u201d * More L.A. Week Well, this job Frank has now is fairly ambitious, even more when you consider the hilarious history of the franchise and also the recently unfulfilled era with the dearly departed Chris Paul and Blake Griffin, who left the Clippers with \u2026 what, exactly? That\u2019s the slippery state of the Clippers right now; they can slide in either direction and catch almost nobody by surprise. They do have Jordan, a voracious rebounder and paint enforcer; Lou Williams, an unapologetic gunner and late bloomer; and Tobias Harris, a young scorer who previously played on teams that nobody bothered to watch. And they also have a hazy picture at point guard, upcoming free agency issues with Jordan, and miles between them and those who rule the West. Also, and this must be stressed because after all they are The Clippers , there\u2019s a stigma to deal with. About that reputation: Maybe it\u2019s dead. Maybe it vaporized when former owner Donald Sterling was yanked from power and took with him a legacy of crummy drafts, lousy luck, lost decades and a general sense of ridicule within the NBA. This was the spring of 2014 when Sterling was caught on audio making, to put it mildly, insensitive comments about people who share the same skin color as most of his players. In a warped way, this was a game-changer for a team that has never advanced beyond the second round of the playoffs, if only because it meant the end of Sterling , who made everything he touched turn to aluminum foil. The franchise came to L.A. uninvited from Buffalo by way of San Diego and never really caught L.A.\u2019s passion even after 33 years. Mainly because of Sterling\u2019s reign of error, they\u2019re Cain to the Lakers\u2019 Abel, a team smack in the entertainment capital lacking the sizzle, celebrity following, national branding or championship chops of their more beloved basketball brother. Ron Harper, whose promising career took a wicked turn when he suffered a knee injury less than two months as a Clipper, would respond \u201cLos Angeles\u201d when asked what team he played for. In a sense, much like a young Lawrence Frank, the Clippers have spent most of their NBA existence as the student manager of the league. They\u2019ve clearly taken a few steps backward after being forced to trade Paul last summer to the Rockets and, in a shocking shift of allegiance, sending Griffin to the Pistons a few weeks ago. That doesn\u2019t mean the Clippers aren\u2019t better off in the long run, though. It depends on how much room they create under the salary cap to gain flexibility and the free agents they chase and trades they make. Frank has the advantage of a thick wallet belonging to billionaire owner Steve Ballmer and the ear of the great Jerry West, the team consultant and sounding board. That\u2019s a start. What Frank and the Clippers lack right now is traction. And once again, an identity. \u201cWe know we have something to prove,\u201d said Jordan. The Golden Age of the franchise was from 2013-17 when the Clippers had Griffin, Jordan and Paul; all three were top-five, arguably, at their position over that time. Plus there was JJ Redick and Jamal Crawford, a pair of respected veteran shooters. And also Rivers, regarded as one of the top coaches in the NBA with a championship from Boston. That was, under almost any definition, a championship contender. They had five straight 50-win seasons, the third-best record in the NBA over that stretch \u2026 and went no deeper than the second round of the playoffs. This was their scarlet letter in that \u201cLob City\u201d era, although it must be explained how injuries once again finger-nailed the Clippers\u2019 blackboard, and at all the wrong moments. Of course, there will always be the 2015 second round when their injuries came from squeezing their own throats. That\u2019s when they crumbled to Houston after a 3-1 series lead. Most embarrassing was being up 19 at home in Game 6 and losing to Corey Brewer and Josh Smith with James Harden on the bench. Otherwise, their playoff path was a series of players reaching for body parts and wincing. Paul missed the first two games of that \u201915 series with the Rockets with a bad hamstring suffered in the first round against the Spurs and was never 100 percent vs. Houston. Griffin and Paul missed the 2016 playoffs with a broken finger and a sore quad. Griffin came up lame last spring against the Jazz in the first round and the Clippers were finished. Rivers sighs and says: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing you can do about it, really. The year Chris gets the hamstring injury in the San Antonio series, that\u2019s the only one I think most about, what if he had been healthy for us in the Houston series which came next. \u201cIt\u2019s all health related, this business. The teams that win owe it to good health. When you\u2019re winning titles, you\u2019re healthy, you don\u2019t have guys sitting out.\u201d The Clippers were the last team in the West to beat the Warriors in the playoffs and that was the high-water point of Lob City. Otherwise, beyond the highlight reels and individual honors, significant as they were, there wasn\u2019t much to crow about. Even this year, injuries paid another uninvited visit. In fact, those injuries spooked the club and conspired to make the Clippers re-think their investment in Griffin, whom they gave a five-year, $171 million deal just last summer. They realized they could only grow so much while paying a fortune to a power forward who\u2019s on the wrong side of 30 and a power forward with a significant injury history (most were freakish in nature, but still, they add up). Rivers has done one of his better coaching jobs this season, given the shifting lineups caused by injuries to his son, Danilo Gallinari, Patrick Beverley and others, keeping the Clippers within a few nose hairs of the final playoff spot with a few months to go. \u201cI love this team,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cIt\u2019s a great group to coach. They just play hard. And our ball movement is infectious. They pass so much that everybody wants to join in.\u201d It could be argued that Rivers is more at peace, now that he no longer has the personnel title and the hassles that go with that. He didn\u2019t raise a stink, at least not publicly, when they cut his titles in half (perhaps because they didn\u2019t reduce his pay) and seems content to see what the next chapter brings. It helps that he and Frank have history; Rivers hired Frank as his assistant in Boston and also brought him to the Clippers to serve the same role before the promotion. \u201cDoc and I have such a special relationship because it\u2019s based on honesty,\u201d said Frank. \u201cWe deal with each other openly and honestly. We serve each other. It\u2019s a true partnership. We tell and take the hard truths and we both share the same vision in trying to do what\u2019s in the best interests of the organization. We\u2019re both here to serve each other, the players and the organization. He put me in the front office role. When it was restructured we haven\u2019t skipped a beat. For us, we keep moving forward.\u201d The Clippers padded the front office by adding the expertise of West, who built championship dynasties with the Lakers and Warriors; along with former Oklahoma City Thunder executive Michael Winger and Trent Redden, formerly of the Cavaliers, and the debate amongst them is healthy. \u201cWhen everybody agrees on the same thing, No. 1, it\u2019s an echo chamber and No. 2, someone\u2019s not needed,\u201d said Frank. They did agree two weeks ago that it was time for Griffin to move on, with the biggest nudge coming from West. It wasn\u2019t an easy about-face, of course; Griffin was a five-time All-Star and rescued the franchise from the dumpster when he was drafted in 2011. He sold T-shirts and jerseys, put the club on prime-time TV and, from his jump-over-a-car dunk and catchy commercials, made the Clippers \u2026 cool. But trading Griffin to the star-desperate Pistons was groundbreaking in that it forced the club to try a different approach. The next shakeup could be felt by Jordan, the longest-tenured Clipper who hasn\u2019t been offered a contract extension by the club and isn\u2019t expected to receive one, at least not right away. Jordan has an option next season at $24 million and he\u2019s in a tricky spot. With salary cap money drying up for 2018-19 and most teams suddenly becoming budget conscious, it\u2019s unlikely Jordan will bank that much on the market this summer, even though he\u2019s still a solid rebounder (14 per game over the last five years) and defender and just 29. He can opt-out and get more years, but less annual money, from another team; or he can stay in L.A. and play for the $24 million and then hit the market in 2019. \u201cI\u2019ve been here when it was horrible times, good times and great times,\u201d said Jordan. \u201cBeing here as long as I\u2019ve been here is something I\u2019ve taken pride in.\u201d He paused, then added: \u201cI\u2019ve been loyal,\u201d which is somewhat true; he did try to flee the Clipper ship four years ago when he accepted, then backed out of, a free agent deal with the Mavericks . Surely, Jordan can see the handwriting; with Paul and Griffin gone, what\u2019s stopping the Clippers from washing free of Lob City and starting fresh? All Frank would say is: \u201cWe have a great relationship with DJ and his agent. He\u2019s one of the top players in the league and having another terrific year.\u201d The Clippers\u2019 plan is clear: Get leaner with the cap, and develop younger players while mixing in a few reasonably-priced veterans. That\u2019s why they kept Lou Williams at the trade deadline; when he agreed to a three-year extension at $24 million , it fit the plan. He\u2019s averaging 23 points and five assists this season, by far the most productive of his career, yet he\u2019ll be 32 next season. So the team-friendly money helped the Clippers while the security helped a player who previously bounced around five other teams.  Beyond Jordan, Harris, Williams and Gallinari, the remaining talent is either aging or tapped out or just average. There\u2019s a need for a star, but those type tend to gravitate toward the other team in town. If the Clippers were truly a reflection of ownership during the Donald Sterling years, and if this pattern continues, then the ball belongs to a former software executive who\u2019s balding, wears clothes that scream Jos. A Bank, tends to get goofy after a great play and is worth upwards of $30 billion. We know Steve Ballmer is rightly hailed as a savior in L.A. simply because, if nothing else, he\u2019s clearly not Sterling. But what kind of owner is he, and will he be going forward? There haven\u2019t been any burps since he paid $2 billion for the club four years ago and Ballmer doesn\u2019t appear to be the intrusive type. He also, and rather boldly, stripped Rivers of the personnel duties and brought in West, and you can\u2019t find many in the basketball world who will argue against either of those moves. They indicate that Ballmer is a quick study and is getting the hang of this ownership gig. \u201cWhat Steve has been able to do in a short amount of time has been great,\u201d said Frank. \u201cEveryone sees the passion but don\u2019t get to see the humility, investment and commitment to make this a world class organization. He provides every single resource necessary to all the people who work for the Clippers. We\u2019ve been able to add so many high level people, new resources, technology in a short amount of time. That\u2019s why we\u2019re optimistic about what we are and what we can be.\u201d Frank says Ballmer is a basketball guy beneath the billions, and a boss who holds people accountable, yet is reasonable. \u201cYou see the intelligence but what\u2019s pressing the most is his humility,\u201d Frank said. \u201cPeople\u2019s eyes widen when someone\u2019s worth $30 billion but he\u2019s just a very likable guy. There\u2019s no false pretenses. He\u2019s very direct, honest and connects with people. He wants to do the right things. He loves the game. He\u2019ll watch five games a night, you can pick his brain and bounce ideas and he\u2019ll give you an unfiltered opinion.\u201d Ballmer has retired from the daily role at Microsoft and is living in Los Angeles part-time and tending to all things Clippers. Eventually, though, he must weigh in on the two people still remaining from Lob City: Jordan and Rivers. Both decisions must be run by Ballmer because they involve money and\/or direction. Is a low-post center who can\u2019t create his own shot still worth $20 million-plus in today\u2019s NBA, especially as he drifts toward the other side of 30? Is Rivers the right man for a team that\u2019ll suddenly lean more toward youth and development? Mostly, does Ballmer have all the right people in place under him who\u2019ll steer the club correctly through this transitional stage? \u201cWe want to be very good for a very long time and every decision we make is based on that,\u201d said Frank. \u201cThere\u2019s no one formula to build a team. You must do what\u2019s best to fit your overall vision. If there was one way to build a champion, everybody would be doing it. There\u2019s also timing and an element of luck, some of it circumstantial. You try to plan and make the best informed decision you can.\u201d This isn\u2019t the hapless Clippers you once knew. And it\u2019s not the Clippers of four years ago, either. The goal is to carve out an identity that lasts, not only for decades, but beyond May, for once. Yes, the Clippers are dying to get past the second round of the playoffs. In their present state, however, just reaching the playoffs will be progress.

It felt like a sour breakup.\u201d Perkins went on to say it was now a matter of which side was willing to make the first step to restore relations.

The Bucks\u2019 G League team officially claimed Jennings off waivers on Tuesday. Jennings had reportedly signed with the G League and entered the league\u2019s player pool. Wisconsin was No. 1 in the player pool and claimed Jennings, according to Marc Stein of the New York Times . As a rookie with the Bucks in 2009-10, Jennings made the All-Rookie first team and became well known after his seventh game in the NBA. In that game, Jennings scored a Bucks rookie-record 55 points against the Golden State Warriors , breaking the mark set by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (then known as Lew Alcindor) on Feb. 21, 1970 . He started all 82 games for the Bucks in 2009-10, helping them to the playoffs for the first time since \u201906. By 2012-13, Jennings averaged 17.4 points and a career-high 6.5 assists that season, ranking among the league\u2019s top 20 in both categories. However, the Bucks traded him to the Detroit Pistons in the summer of 2013 for guard Brandon Knight, forward Khris Middleton and center Viacheslav Kravtsov. A little more than two years later, Jennings was dealt to the Orlando Magic in the Tobias Harris trade , where he played in 25 games, averaging seven points, four assists while shooting 36.6 percent. He signed with the New York Knicks in the summer of 2016, but was waived after 58 games . He then signed with the Washington Wizards , playing 23 games for them and went unsigned last summer.

The voting category dedicated to the game\u2019s best big men has been missing since 2013 , removed by the league\u2019s Competition Committee in a nod to a style of play pushing toward the perimeter. There also was an acknowledgement that the very best bigs were roaming the NBA as \u201cpower forwards\u201d and, let\u2019s be honest, a desire to avoid the likes of Jamaal Magloire and Brad Miller as \u201cAll Stars,\u201d mucking up the annual fast-paced, offense-obsessed showcase game. As league exec Stu Jackson said at the time, \u201cIt [the center category] just seemed a little outdated and didn\u2019t represent the way our game has evolved.\u201d As Roy Hibbert, the former Indiana Pacers center who felt his All-Star days were suddenly over (he\u2019d made the 2012 Game): \u201cThat\u2019s bull\u2014-!\u201d Well, get a load of the All-Star rosters now. Joel Embiid, DeMarcus Cousins (injured) and Anthony Davis racked up enough votes to earn starting spots . Al Horford, Karl-Anthony Towns, Draymond Green, Kristaps Porzingis (injured), Kevin Love (injured) and Andre Drummond were chosen reserves or injury replacements. There\u2019s a wide range of sizes, skills and capabilities in that group of nine, but all are, or at various times have been, centers. Just when it looked as if the large fellows were marching dinosaur-style into the NBA\u2019s great tar pit, the league suddenly turned into Jurassic Park. Centers are thriving, with the position hosting a wildly diverse group of players, from traditional, plodding bangers to ball stylists with the shooting and passing skills of wings. \u201cThere\u2019s very talented [big men] now,\u201d former Milwaukee coach Jason Kidd said earlier this season. That night the Bucks were facing Minnesota, and Towns happened to pass by in the hallway where Kidd was talking. \u201cJust talking about Towns as he\u2019s walkin\u2019 by, someone who can play inside, out, put it on the floor,\u201d Kidd said. \u201cCan lead the break. Can pass. Everybody talks about the [3-pointer]. So I think the center position is in a good place. Sometimes we look at the past and how the game has changed, and some of us haven\u2019t changed with the game. But there\u2019s an understanding that everybody can shoot a thiree now. It\u2019s not just about playing inside for twos.\u201d The poster guy for the resurgence at center is the Philadelphia 76ers\u2019 Joel Embiid. At 7-foot and a sturdy 250 pounds, Embiid looks like a throwback big man, with the length and heft to dominate inside. Yet he possesses the ball skills and shooting range of a guard, combined with nimble footwork reminiscent of Houston Rockets legend Hakeem Olajuwon . What\u2019s exciting for the NBA \u2013 and a sign of a style pendulum swinging back \u2013 is the number of promising young big men lining up to challenge both Embiid and any irrational thoughts about a centerless game. Per basketball-reference.com, of the 31 centers and power forwards who were averaging at least 10.0 points and 6.0 rebounds through Monday night (while appearing in at least 30 games), 10 are age 23 or younger . Seven more are 24 or 25. Only six are older than 29. And among the youngest group, only Houston\u2019s Clint Capela and the Portland Trail Blazers\u2019 Jusuf Nurkic are down in the single digits of the 3-point game with traditional big men like the Charlotte Hornets\u2019 Dwight Howard, the LA Clippers\u2019 DeAndre Jordan or the Miami Heat\u2019s Hassan Whiteside. The 10 youngest of those 31 big men have attempted 125.2 shots from the arc this season, compared to 69.6 by the 10 oldest. And that includes Marc Gasol\u2019s 233 and Al Horford\u2019s 175 , which account for 58.6 percent of the older group\u2019s total. Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr talked last month about rule changes that made life tougher for traditional post players. \u201cWhen Patrick [Ewing] was playing, you couldn\u2019t double-team the post until the guy got the ball,\u2019\u2019 Kerr said. \u201cYou can do that now \u2014 it\u2019s made posting up much more difficult. \u201cSo rule changes led to an offensive revolution. Led to centers deciding, \u2018I\u2019m going to go shoot threes,\u2019 whether it was Pau Gasol or Mo Speights, Marc Gasol. You see a lot of centers who, three years ago, never took a three and now they\u2019re shooting threes.\u201d Certainly, some old guys have learned new tricks \u2014 Gasol has scored 29.9 percent of his points on 3-pointers since the start of 2016-17, compared to just 0.4 percent through his first eight seasons. But it\u2019s the new guys who are arriving with those tricks as standard equipment. \u201cCertain types of big men [have been legislated out of the game],\u201d Rockets coach Mike D\u2019Antoni said, laughing. \u201cThe ones who aren\u2019t skilled.\u201d D\u2019Antoni doesn\u2019t need his centers to launch 3-pointers when he has shooters like James Harden, Chris Paul, Trevor Ariza and Ryan Anderson. And, the Rockets take more 3-pointers ( 42.6 ) than any team in the league. Yet in Capela, D\u2019Antoni has the perfect complementary big. \u201cIt would be nice if you could post up, but that\u2019s not what we\u2019re looking for,\u201d said the Rockets coach. \u201cTo me, a big man has to be able to guard on the perimeter. If he can\u2019t do that, if he can\u2019t run the pick-and-roll and have good hands and finish above the rim, that makes it tough. \u201cThe players have changed, not the game. The big men aren\u2019t going away, they\u2019re just getting better.\u201d Towns is typical of a generation of big men for whom size, formerly an easy advantage, loomed as a possible liability in today\u2019s NBA if it weren\u2019t bundled with superior basketball skills. \u201cWhen I was younger, I was taught to be as versatile as possible,\u201d Towns said. \u201cIf you\u2019re versatile, there\u2019s no reason a coach can\u2019t have you in the game. That\u2019s what my dad\u2019s philosophy was, so from a young age, he taught me to be a guard first and a big second, though I don\u2019t think he had a crystal ball to be able to see what the NBA would become.\u201d Growing up, Towns admired the games of players such as Dirk Nowitzki, Kevin Garnett and Magic Johnson \u2014 all guys who notably \u201cplayed smaller\u201d than their actual sizes. \u201cI wanted to shoot like Dirk, I wanted to play defense like KG, I wanted to be \u2018Showtime\u2019 like Magic,\u201d Towns said. \u201cAs bigs, we all understand that to be the driving force of bringing back the big men, we have to be doing our jobs and continue to get better every day. It\u2019s up to us. Obviously, we have to adapt with the game. We can\u2019t change it back to the way it was. But we can still implement old-school philosophies into the modern game.\u201d Embiid already has made his reputation, being voted in as a starter for Sunday\u2019s All-Star Game . Here are a handful of other young centers who have made size desirable again in a league that fell in love with small ball: Vitals: 7 feet, 244 pounds Key stat:  NBA-leading 49 double-doubles Towns\u2019 offensive repertoire, at his height, is as strong as Embiid\u2019s. And if you see flashes of other big men in his game, well, that\u2019s very much by design. From Shaquille O\u2019Neal to Sam Perkins to Rik Smits, the Wolves center has tried to learn from the best. \u201cOne of the things that has benefited me in my career is being part of the new age of technology,\u201d Towns said. \u201cThe ability growing up to get on the Internet at friends\u2019 houses and go on YouTube and watch videos of great players. Just watching highlights \u2014 Kevin McHale doing his \u2018slippery eel\u2019 and Tim Duncan with his fundamentals . Just the other day I was looking at Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and his hook shot.\u201d Minnesota coach Tom Thibodeau tries to incorporate Towns\u2019 versatility. Now if only he was as effective defensively. Towns leads the NBA in fouls ( 195 through Monday ) and often isn\u2019t a conscientious and aware defender. When he takes that next step in his game, the Wolves can take a bigger step in the standings. Vitals: 6-foot-11, 243 pounds Key stat : Third in blocks per game (2.1) past two seasons. Turner, the Pacers\u2019 young big, claims to have seen the game transform into \u201cpositionless basketball\u201d just in his three NBA seasons. \u201cI think my rookie year was when we saw a lot of big guys \u2014 Brook Lopez, Marc Gasol \u2014 shooting threes. It has happened fast,\u201d Turner said. \u201cYou see a lot of big men doing a little bit of everything now.\u201d Turner feels he adapted quickly. A 21.4 percent 3-point shooter as a rookie, he\u2019s at 35 percent this season . He considers himself an elite shot blocker and says, \u201cI\u2019m confident in my ability to guard on the perimeter and protect the paint.\u201d Injuries and inconsistency have slowed Turner\u2019s development, and some would like to see him work more on his inside game. He shares some of the Pacers\u2019 big-man duties with Domantas Sabonis, son of Hall of Famer Arvydas Sabonis and another of the current gifted young bigs. Vitals: 6-foot-10, 240 pounds Key stat : Leads NBA in 2FG% (.657) Capela suits the Rockets\u2019 high-octane attack as well as they suit him. He doesn\u2019t dawdle at the 3-point line, instead converting at a high rate on lobs and layups. \u201cI like to run the floor, set pick-and-rolls, and move hard and fast,\u201d said Capela, who spent much of his rookie season with the Rio Grande Valley Vipers in the G League . \u201cAlways quick decisions. That brings my team a pace that helps to get our shooters open, to get wide open threes. It also helps me to get dunks.\u201d Capela\u2019s efficiency is impressive too, given the 27.1 minutes he averages. On Feb. 9 vs. the Nuggets, he became the first player to get at least 20 points and 25 rebounds in 29 minutes or fewer . After a victory over Dallas, Paul raved about Capela\u2019s value to their club. \u201cMe and James probably on him more than anyone else because he\u2019s really the backbone of this team,\u201d Paul recently told NBA TV. \u201cWithout him rolling to the basket, without him defending the paint \u2026 CC is the guy.\u201d Vitals: 6-foot-10, 250 pounds Key stat:  Leads centers in assists (5.6 apg) By the numbers, Jokic\u2019s 2017-18 season isn\u2019t much better than his breakout in 2016-17. But the Nuggets are positioned for a postseason berth and the big man\u2019s work as a \u201cpoint center\u201d is a big reason why. Jokic has averaged 7.8 assists in triggering Denver\u2019s offense and leading it to seven victories in 10 games entering Tuesday. He has contributed 18.0 points and 10.7 rebounds in that stretch, too. The Serbian will turn 23 on Feb. 19 and ranks 14th in the league in total touches . But the key to his deft passing is how swiftly he makes his decisions and moves the ball along. \u201cHe picks teams apart with his passing ability,\u201d Turner said. \u201cYou never know when he\u2019s going to shoot it, when he\u2019s going to pass it. Those kind of big men, who are able to play-make, they\u2019re the toughest to guard.\u201d Vitals: 7-foot-3, 240 pounds Key stat : 2.4 blocks per game (tied 1st in NBA) Prior to blowing out his ACL last week , Porzingis was having a monster season, with career highs in scoring (22.7 ppg), blocks (2.4 bpg) and 3-point shooting (39.5 percent). He made history on Dec. 12 when he became the first player in league history with at least 35 points, 10 rebounds, five blocks and five 3-pointers in a game. \u201cHe shoots it so well, you\u2019ve got to respect his range out there,\u201d Turner said. \u201cBut he can also do it down low, especially when he has smaller guys on him.\u201d Porzingis\u2019 injury forced the Knicks to reassess this season, shifting their emphasis away from playoff thoughts to a deeper dive into rebuilding. His rehab timeline will eat into 2018-19 too, though even another 10 or 12 months on the side shouldn\u2019t prevent \u201cThe Unicorn\u201d from taking his place near the top of the NBA\u2019s young hybrid bigs. \u201cIt seems like [it\u2019s a big hurdle], but in the big scheme of things, the guy\u2019s going to play 15, 18 years in this league,\u201d Knicks coach Jeff Hornacek told reporters Monday. \u201cHe\u2019s 22 years old. It\u2019s a bit of a mountain he has to climb for a year. He\u2019ll look back at this and probably be glad he went through it and got stronger. When you hit adversity and bounce back, it says a lot about your character.\u201d * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

The former NBA Coach of the Year decided before tipoff against the Phoenix Suns that his players would handle coaching duties. They did just that, right down to giving instructions and diagramming plays during timeouts in a 123-89 Warriors victory . Draymond Green, Andre Iguodala, Stephen Curry and others took turns coaching while Kerr took a backseat. Perhaps it was a way to congratulate himself for becoming the fastest NBA coach to earn win No. 250 on Saturday. Either way, the Warriors looked just fine under new management, beating the Suns by a whopping 46 points . The results from Green, Iguodala, Curry and others leading the charge, according to Mark Medina of The Mercury News , were a little mixed : Phoenix guard Troy Daniels was not pleased with what he deemed a disrespectful move by Kerr He told Scott Bordow of The Arizona Republic as much before zipping his own dart at the Warriors\u2019 coach: Suns players had differing views on the maneuver, with one telling ESPN\u2019s Chris Haynes that it is on Phoenix to change how opponents esteem them . Monday\u2019s 46-point loss marked the Suns fourth 40-point loss this season \u2014 the same number of 40-point losses the rest of the NBA has combined in 2017-18. Additionally, the Suns\u2019 four 40-point losses ties the total number of 40-point losses the franchise logged in its first 49 seasons. Kerr, however, insisted that his forgoing game-night duties was about sending a message to his own players, not the Suns. \u201cI told [Suns interim coach] Jay [Triano] that people may make a big deal of it and it had nothing to do with being disrespectful,\u201d Kerr told the Republic . \u201cIt had everything to do with me trying to reach my team. I haven\u2019t been able to reach them the last month. They are tired of my voice and I\u201dm tired of my voice. It\u2019s been a long haul these last few years. I wasn\u2019t reaching them and we just figured it was probably a good night to pull a trick out of the hat and do something different.\u201d Triano, for his part, did not seem particularly irked by Kerr\u2019s tactics. \u201cI noticed their plays were a little better out of timeout tonight,\u201d Triano told ESPN jokingly. \u201cNah, I didn\u2019t have a problem with what Steve did.\u201d * * *"},{"id":41758,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/minnesota-timberwolves-jeff-teague-adjusting-new-role-less-scoring","date":"2018-02-13","title":"Jeff Teague ramps down scoring in new role with Minnesota Timberwolves","content":" Winning cures a lot of ails in the NBA, but winning also requires sacrifice from players in one form or another.

The catch is he hasn\u2019t thrown a no-look pass in 22 years or won a championship in 30. Magic Johnson is now decades removed from \u201cShowtime\u201d \u2014 although you wouldn\u2019t know it by the love he still gets in a town where fame fizzles once careers die. Now in his first season as team president, he remains the everlasting smiling face of the organization, and this is precisely why he rushed back to rescue the Lakers last February . He needs and wants players who can replace him. If that\u2019s possible. And so, Magic is on an ambitious mission to create stars and find them, which is something the Lakers have always done in their rich history. There is perhaps no NBA franchise that reflects the city it represents more than the Lakers do. Flashy and transcendent, magnetic and entertaining, the greats followed in a neat and convenient succession: first Elgin Baylor , then Jerry West , Wilt Chamberlain , Kareem Abdul-Jabbar , Magic Johnson , James Worthy , Kobe Bryant ( in No. 8 ), Shaquille O\u2019Neal and Kobe Bryant ( in No. 24 ). They formed the bedrock upon which the franchise and its 16 championships was built. When those names suddenly became Timofey Mozgov, Luol Deng and another Johnson (not Magic, but Wesley), and the Lakers couldn\u2019t even make the playoffs anymore. The aura vaporized and the pain felt by those with a connection to the franchise was eye-gouging. * More L.A. Week Nobody was irritated more than Johnson, by then a wildly successful businessman, TV personality and partial owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers . Whoa, baseball? Seriously, that\u2019s where Magic was spending his time until he heard his true calling, a desperate Jeanie Buss on Line One. \u201cIt was hard for me to sit back and see what was going on, the team losing and doing so without a clear vision,\u201d Johnson said recently. When he retired from the Lakers, he never really left them; they remained in his thoughts, his heart and his financial portfolio (Magic had a small slice of the team until he sold it in 2010 to eventually to buy into the Dodgers). When the team began to tailspin five seasons ago and won just 27, 21 and 17 games (in 2013-14, \u201914-15 and \u201915-16, resepectively), with a roster and a salary cap in flames, one of the Lakers\u2019 biggest critics was \u2026 Magic. Tough love was expressed through social media, where Magic was almost Donald Trump-like on Twitter, taking shots at players, coaches and especially The Brother of Jeanie, who was responsible for the fall. Jim Buss was low-hanging fruit; the more hapless the Lakers looked on his watch, the more that baseball cap slid down over his eyes. A non-bloody coup ensued within the Buss family , with Jeanie flexing her right to swipe control of the Lakers , akin to a sibling wrestling the remote control during TV time, and her first order of business was to ask for, and get, an assist from someone who made that an art form. So this is where we are: Jeanie, Magic, general manager and former Bryant agent Rob Pelinka, Kyle Kuzma, Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Paul George rumors, LeBron James dreams and uninvited guest LaVar Ball, all conspiring to revive the one franchise that the NBA needs on the floor in May and June if possible. \u201cThe Lakers have the No. 1 fan base in the NBA so it\u2019s good for the league when the Lakers are in contention,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re building towards. And we\u2019ll get there.\u201d Perhaps. But the how and the when are what will make this push to prominence a fascinating one. The shot-callers on the Lakers all have a working history with each other. That, on the surface, seems an advantage. There are no introductions needed between Magic, Jeanie Buss and Pelinka. Johnson and Buss met as teenagers. The bond between them was the late Lakers owner Jerry Buss , who mentored both. Johnson and Jeanie have adopted Buss\u2019 philosophies about money and business and running the Lakers. Jeanie Buss oversaw the completion last spring of a new state-of-the-art training center with all the sweet touches (including a barbershop!), proof of the family\u2019s financial commitment to ensure the Lakers have the best of everything. She told Magic and Pelinka to fix the product on the floor and everything else will be provided. \u201cJeanie Buss has done a tremendous job keeping the vision of her father and the hope alive with the Lakers,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cShe\u2019s all about titles. We\u2019ve got everything in place. And people can see that. Who else can say they\u2019ve been losing for four years and still have sellout crowds?\u201d Because he can run the Lakers without restrictions or push-back from above, Magic was only too thrilled to take the wheel. Put aside, for a moment, baseball and gourmet coffee and movie theaters (his other business ventures); Magic was trained for basketball. Of course, just because you\u2019ve won six championships (including his NCAA title), an Olympic gold medal and put lumps in people\u2019s throats, that doesn\u2019t automatically translate into front-office brilliance. West aside, the championship track record for Hall of Fame players-turned-executives isn\u2019t very encouraging. Magic\u2019s eternal basketball twin brother, Larry Bird, finally surrendered last year after an executive run with the hometown Pacers. He had his moments there (three conference finals, an Executive of the Year award in 2011-12), but couldn\u2019t match what he did as a player and didn\u2019t produce a ring. Isiah Thomas, whose friendship with Magic was freshly rekindled recently , had a forgotten run as president of the New York Knicks. While Thomas wasn\u2019t the sole reason the Knicks couldn\u2019t produce a winner, he became a symbol of a lost era, fair or not, among New Yorkers. Then there\u2019s Michael Jordan, still trying to gain traction as owner of the Charlotte Hornets, who seem no closer to sipping champagne now than when he first took ownership of the team in 2010 . Again, the similarities are stark: All-time great player, massively successful businessman (Jordan Brand, commercials) and, so far anyway, unsatisfied basketball bossman. Is this a curse from the Basketball Gods or merely a coincidence? What does Magic know about running a team that the other Hall of Famers didn\u2019t, or don\u2019t? That\u2019s fair to ask. Pelinka can\u2019t speak for them, but he can for Magic. \u201cMagic is relentless in his pursuit of excellence,\u201d Pelinka said. \u201cMagic is the most positive and enthusiastic person I\u2019ve ever come across. Every day he gets up at 4 and works out and then he starts calling me at 6 with ideas and vision. He\u2019s a \u2018vision-caster extraordinaire.\u2019 I like to do the ground work to make sure his vision comes to life.\u201d Pelinka is making the ambitious leap from A-list player agent to general manager, a transition that appears seamless. He crunched numbers with Buss about contracts for Bryant. He brings the nuts and bolts knowledge about the agent culture, negotiating and the salary cap, which frees up Magic to spend more time studying talent. \u201cAfter so many years representing players who\u2019ve been through here I had a natural working relationship with Jeanie,\u201d Pelinka said. \u201cIt seemed a natural progression with her and then to have known Magic so well from being in LA, I have lots of touch points with him. There was just a real common DNA and common vision. The three of us believe in collaboration and round-tabling ideas. We\u2019ve tried to create a structure that\u2019s not bureaucratic. It\u2019s the wheel philosophy. We\u2019re all spokes on the wheel and when the spokes stay strong the wheel stays strong.\u201d Pelinka has other claims to fame. He was a reserve player on the Fab Five team at Michigan, which first exposed him to stars. And he\u2019s a dead ringer for heart-throb actor Rob Lowe; no doubt Pelinka has stories about being approached in LA by strange women biting their pearls. But maybe the best gift that prepared him for the road ahead came when his wife handed him a song by gospel singer Amy Grant, conveniently titled \u201cTakes A Little Time\u201d which includes these lyrics: To get your feet back on the ground, it takes a little time sometimes, It takes a little time sometimes to get the Titanic turned back around. Buss, Magic and Pelinka put their faith in Luke Walton, a first-time coach (not counting his half-season stand-in for Steve Kerr with the Warriors in 2015-16) who can grow into the role. Nobody panicked last month when the Lakers endured a nine-game losing streak, the defense turned sour and Walton\u2019s job security became an issue outside of the organization, not within it. They haven\u2019t forgotten the respect Walton received from Klay Thompson, Stephen Curry and Draymond Green with the Warriors. Also, Walton got good reviews from O\u2019Neal and Bryant on those Lakers championship teams of 2008 and \u201809. If he can work well with superstars, the feeling is, he can work with anyone. \u201cI believe in this group and believe in the fact that when you have repetition and hard work and unselfish players, good things will happen,\u201d Walton said. \u201cIt takes patience and commitment and I think we have all those things in the organization.\u201d They have a Hall of Fame guy, a former ace agent, a basketball lifer as coach and a Buss, all on the top floor of the basketball office. That, they believe, is a winning combo. \u201cThe Lakers have had extreme glory,\u201d Pelinka said. \u201cThe last 2-3 years have been rough and it\u2019s going to take a little time to turn that around. The beauty is we really worked hard to get a great draft class and worked hard with this young core of guys that bring the promise and hope that people see. We have a strong confidence that we\u2019re going to get this done.\u201d Kuzma can\u2019t explain how he felt when Magic dropped that \u201cjunior, junior\u201d sky hook against the Celtics in Game 4 of the 1987 Finals because you cannot describe what you never saw. Kuzma wasn\u2019t born until three years after Magic retired, typical of the team\u2019s \u201cCrib Core\u201d that only knows Magic from what their parents told them. \u201cKobe,\u201d answers Kuzma, when asked what Laker left the best impression on him. \u201cAnd I only remember Jordan with the Wizards.\u201d That\u2019s what the Lakers are dealing with in their locker room, and it\u2019s all positive. Because if Kuzma, Ball and Ingram are indeed keepers, then the Lakers\u2019 work is already halfway done. Given their ages \u2014 all 22 and under \u2014 and small sample-sized looks at their talent, these three can grow organically and develop the same bond as others did before them. Johnson and Pelinka seemingly had a robust Draft debut last summer , getting Ball, swinging a deal that brought Kuzma while also adding Josh Hart . Some luck was involved, of course, as the lottery fell in the Lakers\u2019 favor and they kept a first-round pick that would\u2019ve gone to the Philadelphia 76ers. Ball, Hart and Kuzma are relatively productive and on rookie deals, allowing the Lakers to spend on free agents or absorb heavier contracts via trades. Kuzma, the Lakers\u2019 second-leading scorer ( 15.7 points per game ), is supremely athletic and confident. He can score in a variety of way and is a worker bee defensively. Among this rookie trio, he has the most star sparkle, which others have noticed. Perhaps the biggest compliment Kuzma received was getting an approving postgame hug and head tap from the likes of Kevin Durant. \u201cEvery other game it\u2019s somebody else,\u201d Kuzma said with a grin. \u201cKD had some good things to say. I just try to go out there and play as hard as possible. Being a Laker and getting this much playing time is something I don\u2019t take for granted. A lot of rookies don\u2019t get the chance to play right away. It means a lot that the coaching staff and organization has a lot of faith in me.\u201d If you heard Ingram\u2019s name mentioned in any trades, it didn\u2019t come from the organization. He\u2019s stretchy and bouncy, and his improving  mid-range shot and growing confidence can cause matchup issues with small forwards. Whether he\u2019ll ever add biceps and a beast mentality to see minutes at power forward is questionable and Ingram is lacking as a rebounder ( 5.3 rpg this season in 33.9 mpg ) and rim protector ( 36 blocks in 40 games ). Ball is the Lakers\u2019 highest-drafted point guard since Russell ( No. 2 in 2015 Draft ), but both were the highest drafted Lakers point guard since Johnson in 1979 ( No. 1 overall ). But that\u2019s the least of the burdens Ball carries. Johnson had good intentions when he predicted Ball\u2019s jersey would hang from the rafters one day . But it only intensified the premature public expectations when Ball\u2019s shooting mechanics and accuracy became serious issues to start 2017-18. The basketball world was quick to proclaim Ball as the second-best Lakers rookie after Kuzma, which rings true \u2026 in the short-term anyway. And then LaVar Ball, thirsty for fame, took shots at his son\u2019s teammates and coach . If anything, the Lakers are comforted by seeing how the kid deals with the madness. He\u2019s amazingly level-headed, and this will serve him well when and if the Lakers start to win big on his watch. His floor vision and passing instincts are constantly applauded by opponents. (He\u2019s already got two triple-doubles this season .) And remember, he just turned 20. Most important, he\u2019s well-liked in the locker room and his teammates are giving him room to grow into a leadership role. \u201cThey tell me stay positive when things aren\u2019t going right, to speak up when I need to and encourage me,\u201d Ball said. \u201cIt makes it easy for me.\u201d Ball, Kuzma and Ingram must also cope with the losing that comes with a developing team \u2014 and they\u2019ve put that in perspective. \u201cI think when you win so much in high school and college it\u2019s disappointing to go through, but it\u2019s going to make us stronger as we go through this journey, stronger and tougher,\u201d Ingram said. \u201cI\u2019m comforted by what we do in practice every day. Eventually it\u2019ll come over to the games. Eventually you get tired of losing.\u201d Kuzma promises: \u201cWe\u2019ll figure it out in the next two years. Or less.\u201d This is the most important summer in Lakers history since 1996 when they swung a draft-day trade for Bryant and signed O\u2019Neal . It\u2019s all because they have a healthy salary cap situation, thanks to the Magic-Pelinka-led trades with Brooklyn (last summer) and Cleveland (last week). When the Lakers dialed the Nets and unloaded Mozgov\u2019s bloated contract, it earned them Lopez (on an expiring deal) and the chance to draft Kuzma (who is a steal of a player on a rookie contract). It was brilliant, in hindsight. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have made that move if I didn\u2019t think we could use that money (this summer),\u201d Johnson said. The Lakers then doubled-down when they sent Jordan Clarkson\u2019s big deal and Larry Nance Jr. (on his rookie deal) to the Cavs in return for Isaiah Thomas and Channing Frye , whose contracts expire this summer. They also grabbed Cleveland\u2019s No. 1 pick in the process, which replaces the first-rounder that was sacrificed by the Jim Buss-Lakers. Once again, it was a money-wise move by Magic and Pelinka and heightens their belief that someone worthy is coming their way this summer or next. Johnson stresses that if the Lakers don\u2019t load up this July, they\u2019ll save some cash for the summer of \u201919. That\u2019s when All-Stars like Kawhi Leonard and Klay Thompson hit the market. Projections have the Lakers with roughly $47 million to dangle this summer. That could swell towards $70 million if, as expected, they let Lopez and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope walk and use the stretch provision on Deng\u2019s contract. There\u2019s also the chance they open more money by not re-signing restricted free agent Julius Randle, which is a tougher call. Randle is in the midst of a mini-breakout season and quickly raising his value to the Lakers. They\u2019ll do whatever, if it means adding James and George, the two most logical free agents this summer and also the best by far. Another GM believes the Lakers will chase New Orleans Pelicans star DeMarcus Cousins hard this summer, even though Cousins is mending from Achilles surgery . If anything, the GM said, the injury could make it easier for the Pelicans to back away if the Laker offer is big enough. \u201cWe\u2019ve got some good young players and then you add some veterans,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cYou look at what Jimmy Butler meant to Minnesota and Kyrie Irving to Boston. Look at their record before they got there and now. They needed a star to take them to the next level. That\u2019s all we need here. We get that, and we\u2019re like Minnesota and like Boston and we become one of the teams that can contend. \u201cThose (free agents this summer) can see that. They\u2019re like, `Man, this young talent they have? And I can put myself in that lineup? We can be good together.\u2019 \u201d The last major upgrade the Lakers tried \u2014 back in 2012 \u2014 went bust. Trading for Dwight Howard and Steve Nash proved both were too hurt and beyond their prime and, as a result, Kobe\u2019s final years weren\u2019t maximized. Johnson says it\u2019s different now, with a new regime in place. \u201cFree agents and their agents know we\u2019re serious about winning,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a guy in place that knows how to win and will take care of their guys.\u201d It\u2019s one thing to have young talent and cap space; quite another if you have those assets and someone who knows what to do with it. The Warriors\u2019 worst nightmare is if Johnson knows what to do with this. The man who wants to win also wants to take his time, which sounds like a contradiction until he explains: \u201cYou can\u2019t get it all at one time,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to build, and so we don\u2019t want to do some stupid trade that could make us good right now but can\u2019t build toward contention for championships. So I\u2019m going to a build it the right way.\u201d What Magic Johnson really wants is to walk into the Stapes Center and get trampled by fans chasing one of his players for selfies. That would be bad for the ego, great for the Lakers. * * * Veteran NBA writer Shaun Powell has worked for newspapers and other publications for more than 25 years.

Per team policy, terms of the deal were not disclosed.  Belinelli appeared in 52 games (one start) with Atlanta this season, averaging 11.4 points and 2.0 assists in 23.3 minutes per game, while shooting .372 from three-point range on a career-high 4.8 attempts per contest. His .927 free-throw percentage ranks fourth-best in the NBA. He has scored in double figures 31 times this season and has five 20-point performances. In his 11th NBA season, Belinelli has played in 696 career games (217 starts) with Atlanta, Charlotte, Sacramento, San Antonio, Chicago, New Orleans, Toronto and Golden State. All told, he holds averages of 9.8 points, 2.0 rebounds and 1.7 assists in 23.2 minutes per game. A career .377 three-point shooter, Belinelli has connected on 945 threes over his 10-plus NBA seasons. In 2013-14 with San Antonio, the Italy native enjoyed his most successful season from beyond the arc, finishing fifth in the NBA, shooting a .430 clip from long distance. At State Farm All-Star Saturday Night that year, Belinelli won the 2014 Foot Locker Three-Point Contest. That season was capped off with a playoff run that would end with the Spurs defeating Miami in the 2014 NBA Finals. Belinelli appeared in 23 playoff games for San Antonio, posting 5.4 points per game, while shooting .421 from three-point range. In his career, Belinelli has appeared in 48 total playoff games (13 starts) with San Antonio, Chicago and New Orleans. Originally selected by Golden State with the 18th overall pick in the 2007 NBA Draft, the 6-foot-5 guard-forward played professionally in Italy before entering the NBA. Belinelli will wear No. 18 for the 76ers.

Considering so many teams were determined to hold onto their first-round picks at all costs \u2014 costs being a big deal in the $200 million-plus max deals world of today\u2019s NBA \u2014 any trades at all would have made for a good, exciting day. And then Cavaliers GM Koby Altman went all Al Capone with the bat on fools. Cleveland\u2019s implosion merited taking a blowtorch to the roster, and Altman did that, in a day that centered on the Cavs\u2019 remaking of the roster, but was fascinating by not only what happened, but what didn\u2019t. With so many teams bunched up in both conferences in the playoff race, every one of them would have been justified making a deal. But the days of renting a player for a couple of months for the stretch drive are over. Almost every team has a superstar, or is at least paying their best player like one. And the 2016 spending orgy continues to have ramifications. The outlay from that summer, in large part, has put two-thirds of the league well over the salary cap, with a number of those 20 teams either hard-capped or perilously close to being so. It made maneuvering this year difficult, if not impossible. No role player was worth a team going over the tax apron, or over the tax threshold \u2014 especially if a team would become a repeater tax paying team by doing so. And yet, teams made moves, and not insignifcant ones. (The Blake Griffin trade to the Detroit Pistons , even though it technically was made the week before the deadline, was close enough to it here to be considered a deadline deal.) Because, as ever, it\u2019s ridiculous to assign \u2019\u2019winners\u201d and \u2019\u2019losers\u201d a minute after a trade was made, it\u2019s more accurate to simply observe that some people benefitted from the trades that were made, on and off the court, while others did not, at least immediately. To paraphrase Al Pacino in the Michael Mann film about whistle blower\/hero Jeffrey Wiegand, \u201cThe Insider\u201d \u2026 1. Altman, reconsidered: Cleveland\u2019s rookie GM had so many things to prove in what was a seemingly impossible spot in his first NBA go-round as the Cavs\u2019 boss. In fact, he was derided as not even being the boss, the notion being that Dan Gilbert was getting his inner Jerry Jones on and making personnel decisions as well as owning the team. Altman got heat nationally for holding out for more from Boston before pulling the trigger on the Kyrie Irving trade, then was pilloried for what he got in the deal, then was pilloried for not trading the most important piece of the deal \u2014 the unprotected 2018 first-round pick from Brooklyn that the Celtics had held onto for years before including it to get Irving \u2014 for a short-term fix. And as the Cavs continued to struggle and look less and less like a contender in January, Altman was dismissed altogether as a coatholder for Cavs owner Dan Gilbert, who was thought to be the \u2019real\u2019 GM in Cleveland. But Altman had his say when it mattered last Thursday , as he pulled the trigger on simultaneous deals that took a blowtorch to the old roster, made the team younger and longer and gave it a foundation for the future regardless of what LeBron decides to do this summer \u2014 while not sacrificing the Brooklyn pick. (And, it must be said, all this happened because Gilbert agreed to take on still more luxury tax payments \u2014 another $7 million \u2014 for this year.) Out went Isaiah Thomas and Channning Frye , Jae Crowder and Iman Shumpert , Derrick Rose and Dwyane Wade (the last a sop to Wade that allows him to finish his career in Miami, where everyone wanted\/hoped he would). In came Jordan Clarkson and Larry Nance, Jr., Rodney Hood and George Hill, Hill being the only one over 30. Hood will be a restricted free agent at season\u2019s end but the Cavs are almost certain to keep him and\/or match any offer for him. That would leave Cleveland with Hill, Hood, Clarkson, Kevin Love, Tristan Thompson, Nance, J.R. Smith, Kyle Korver and rookie Cedi Osman all signed for 2018-19, along with whomever Cleveland takes with Brooklyn\u2019s pick, regardless of whether James is there or not. That may not be a championship contending core, but it\u2019s not nothing, either. And, yes, Altman opened the door to the Lakers being able to make a compelling pitch to James to leave Cleveland. But that\u2019s life in the big city. You can\u2019t make a deal because of what it might do to you down the road; you have to improve the team you have. And, Altman did. If James walks, the Cavs now have a post-LeBron future that would be vastly different from the one they had after he left the first time 2010 . 2. LeBron James, revitalized: It was obvious to anyone paying attention that James\u2019 spirit was sapped in the last couple of weeks. His defense bordered on nonexistent; his offensive output collapsed, as he made just 13 3-pointers in 14 games and shot a horrific 22 percent from 3-point range in January. His plus-minus in January, per basketball-reference.com, was -8.3, the worst of his career in a full month\u2019s slate of games. He didn\u2019t believe in the team that Altman had put around him. We will find out what he thinks of his new, younger brethren in due time, but make no mistake \u2014 he\u2019s once again engaged, as his 65th career triple-double Friday in Atlanta showed. And an engaged LeBron can take any group to The Finals. 3. Unnamed ESPN Executive, again hopeful: See No. 2. Whoever ultimately replaces John Skipper, the Four-Letter\u2019s longtime president who suddenly resigned last December , will cry Kevin Hart-sized tears of joy if the Cavs re-ignite and find themselves in a fourth straight Finals against the Golden State Warriors, or face \u201dThe Beard\u201d and \u201dCP3\u201d, in June. Nothing against the Boston Celtics or Toronto Raptors, but LeBron is gold-plated ratings magma, which ABC\/ESPN have ridden to wildly successful numbers the last three years in June, among the best for Finals games since Michael Jordan\u2019s days in Chicago. 4. Daryl Morey, sitting pretty: The Warriors didn\u2019t make a move at the trade deadline to bolster what has been a shaky bench, leaving Morey\u2019s Houston Rockets right where they were before the deadline: right on Golden State\u2019s heels. Getting a post-buyout commit from Joe Johnson also keeps him from going to the Warriors, who coveted his low-post abilities as a small-ball four just as the Rockets did. Morey has methodically built his team to this point since getting Harden: Houston, right now, is a real and credible threat to topple Golden State in the Western Conference. 5. Derrick Favors, queued up: The 26-year-old power forward didn\u2019t get traded, as many around the league figured he would once Utah didn\u2019t give an extension last fall. But with Gordon Hayward and Hill already gone from last year\u2019s roster, and with Hood getting dealt to Cleveland, there aren\u2019t many parts of the existing Jazz nucleus left that Utah has to pay signficant dollars. They already have Rudy Gobert, Joe Ingles and Ricky Rubio inked for 2018-19 at a total outlay of around $51 million, with another $11 million due Alec Burks if Utah keeps him. It then stands to reason that Favors, with full Bird rights in Utah, could be in line for some of that money in July that the Jazz offered Hayward last year. Favors has played extremely well next to Gobert when both have been healthy, and he\u2019s been outstanding during Utah\u2019s nine-game win streak . If he doesn\u2019t stay in Salt Lake City, he\u2019ll be among the top free-agent big men available this summer.  6. Jeanie Buss, Tinseltown Boss: Cleveland took on Clarkson\u2019s $12.5 million for 2018-19 in the Thomas deal. Doing so puts the Lakers back in business this summer, giving them the option to make max offers to two free agents at the same time. So, after the Lakers\u2019 president fired her brother, Jim, and former GM Mitch Kupchak last year , and installing Magic Johnson and Rob Pelinka in their place , Jeanie Buss has her hand-picked management team in place, plenty of cap room and some promising young guys around which to build. The Lakers have a story to tell that should be compelling. They\u2019ve struck out on free agent after free agent for the last several years, sounding out of touch and tone deaf to elite players and their representatives. It\u2019s Showtime. 7. James Ennis, unearthed: The fourth-year forward was having a solid though relatively anonymous season in Memphis, averaging almost seven points off the bench in 23 minutes a game. A lot of teams were trying to get him at the deadline. The Pistons did , to finish a solid fortnight of trades that revamped their roster and injected life into the franchise as they were sinking in the Eastern Conference. Ennis doesn\u2019t have the start power of Griffin and he\u2019s not as familiar with coach Stan Van Gundy as Jameer Nelson is. But the 27-year-old is going to help the Pistons in the last months of the regular season, as they fight for a playoff spot. 8. Mike Malone, keeping the band together: Denver was much less active at the deadline than many thought the Nuggets would be. In the end, they only moved guard Emmanuel Mudiay , who had fallen out of favor and the rotatiion anyway with Jamal Murray assuming the point. The Nuggets didn\u2019t move Will Barton, Wilson Chandler or Kenneth Faried, all of whom had suitors, and they\u2019re expecting Paul Millsap back no later than early March. So Malone, the Nuggets\u2019 coach, has his team essentially in place for the stretch run, which should result in a playoff berth if Denver can stay healthy and Millsap doesn\u2019t have any relapses. And no one at the top of the West wants to see Murray, Gary Harris, Nikola Jokic and company in the first round.  9. Hornets fans, not abandoned: Some around the Association figured that Charlotte, once it let it be known it would listen to offers for Kemba Walker , would have to move him before the deadline. After all, the Hornets don\u2019t have much of a chance at the playoffs this year, and Walker is rapidly approaching free agency in 2019. The idea was, make a good deal for him now (maybe to his native New York) and get assets around which you could build, before he walks in a year and you get nothing. But the Hornets stood pat and didn\u2019t deal, and it\u2019s a good thing for that franchise. Why should Charlotte be any more inclined to move its best player for pennies on the dollar than, say, the Knicks or the Lakers or any big-market franchise that\u2019s struggling this season? People in North Carolina want value for their entertainment dollars just as much as people in California. It\u2019s hard enough to get free agents to commit to Charlotte; why give away a star guard who, by all accounts, likes it there and wants to stay there? The Raptors made the team around Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan better \u2014 they didn\u2019t blow it up after a couple of playoff failures. The Hornets\u2019 fan base deserves similar restructuring and improvement around Walker rather than a fire sale. 10. Andre Roberson, irreplaceable: The Oklahoma City Thunder guard is out for the season after rupturing his patella tendon Jan. 27 . His impact on the Thunder\u2019s defense has been written about time and time again over the years . The Thunder aren\u2019t the same without him. Yet, in this season where OKC has put all its cards in the middle of the table \u2014 getting Paul George, then trying to keep Paul George by extending Russell Westbrook, then acquiring Carmelo Anthony \u2014 the Thunder didn\u2019t make a deadline move to get a guard to replace Roberson, at least for the rest of the year. * * * OKC was linked to any number of prominent, defense-first wings \u2013 the LA Clippers\u2019 Avery Bradley, Utah\u2019s Hood, the Portland Trail Blazers\u2019 Maurice Harkless \u2014 but didn\u2019t make a deal for any of them. Perhaps the Thunder will make a deal with free agent Tony Allen \u2014 The Grindfather would seem a perfect fit for Roberson\u2019s spot the rest of this year, and the Thunder\u2019s been in contact since the trade deadline passed. But, long-term, assuming a return to health, Roberson will have no significant competition for his minutes or role. On the other hand, some teams did things that were head scratchers, or didn\u2019t seemingly move the needle at all. To paraphrase the dude that former network anchor Dan Rather said attacked him on a Manhattan street in broad daylight in 1986 ( turns out, Rather wasn\u2019t crazy ): * * * 1. The Tale of Tyreke Evans, in Ten Short Chapters: A. He was maybe the most coveted and available player at the trade deadline, in the midst of a great bounceback season after signing a one-year minimum vet deal in Memphis. B. The Grizzlies are going nowhere \u2014 as in a guy sitting at the bus stop who has a game token for Dave and Busters and a coupon for free crazy bread at Little Caesars in his pocket going nowhere \u2014 and Evans was found money, an unexpected asset who could net them something valuable in return. C. The Grizzlies pulled Evans off the court before their game Jan. 31 against the Indiana Pacers , a signal to all of NBA World that they were going to trade him soon and didn\u2019t want him to get injured before a deal could be consummated. D. He continued to sit for more than a week, while the Grizzlies kept losing \u2014 antithetical to the team\u2019s notion that they\u2019re not interested in a rebuld\/tank job this year and think they\u2019ll quickly return to the NBA elite when everyone is healthy. E. The Grizzlies, despite knowing full well that almost no one was\/would be willing to give up a first-round pick in the current almost-everyone-is-capped-out-environment for a player that could turn out to be a three-month rental, insisted on a first-rounder or nothing for Evans . F. No one offered a first-rounder for Evans \u2014 see \u201cE\u201d \u2014 leaving Memphis the option of second-rounders and\/or 2018-19 contracts for him. G. The Grizz, improbably, didn\u2019t move Evans by the deadline, hoping that he truly does, as he\u2019s consistently said, like playing there \u2014 he was a star at the University of Memphis \u2014 and that they can re-sign him in July, despite not having his Bird rights, and add him to their Mike Conley-Marc Gasol nucleus. H. Memphis can, though, get him to Early Bird rights in the summer of 2019 if he were to sign a one-year deal with the Grizz in July, which is the only financial advantage they will have over other teams that could, like Memphis, offer him the full mid-level exception this coming summer. I. But by keeping Evans the rest of this season, Memphis runs the risk of devaluing its own 2018 first-rounder; if he continues to play well, the Grizzlies could win more games and wind up in worse position in the Lottery. J. And if he walks out the door \u2026 well, do they have Dave and Busters locations in the Greater Memphis area? Some of the video games are awesome. 2. Atlanta, holding onto rags in front of Johnny Chan: The Hawks, desperately seeking the bottom of the East to bolster their Lottery chances, didn\u2019t trade any of Kent Bazemore, Dwayne Dedmon, Marco Belinelli or Ersan Ilyasova by the deadline (though they did buy out Belinelli, who\u2019s going to the 76ers ). Maybe the offers for all of them were junk, but, charitably: so what? You don\u2019t give Dedmon away, I guess, but even a second-round pick for Belinelli or Ilyasova would help continue building the Draft stockpile that\u2019s going to be at the heart of any Hawks rebuild the next couple of years. 3. The Brothers Lopez, stuck in neutral: There was buzz around the league that at least one of the two Lopezes would be relocated one way or the other. Brook Lopez, with the Lakers, seemed the liklier candidate; he\u2019s on an expiring deal and has to be renounced by the Lakers in July for them to have the cap space to go after two max free agents, which they can now do after getting Jordan Clarkson\u2019s deal off their books for 2018-19. Robin Lopez is playing very well for the Bulls this season, but he\u2019s got a year left on his deal ($14.3 million), making a trade more likely . But neither Lopez was traded, and as of this writing, neither has been bought out, leaving mascots around the league still vulnerable to the wrath of two seven-footers with chips on their shoulders . 4. The Southeast Division, falling asleep: Okay, Miami brought Wade back, and it was a feel-great story, to be sure. But he\u2019s 36 now, not 26. It wasn\u2019t a balance of power move as much as a balancing of the Heat\u2019s karma. The Wizards and Hawks made a deal for Sheldon Mac , who hasn\u2019t played a minute this season after tearing his Achilles in exhibition play for Washington, and whom Atlanta promptly waived . The Hawks traded Luke Babbitt to Miami for Okaro White, who they promptly waived . Charlotte got Willy Hernangomez from New York for a couple of seconds, and the 23-year-old will no doubt help and be in the Hornets\u2019 rotation. Orlando sent its former first-round pick, Elfrid Payton, to Phoenix for a second-round pick, but didn\u2019t have the fire sale that many around the league thought was coming: no deals for Evan Fournier, Mario Hezonja or Arron Afflalo, much less Aaron Gordon or Nicola Vucevic. It\u2019s not that Atlanta or Orlando had to do something; their big moments will come this summer. But for a trade deadline, it was decidedly underwhelming.  5. Mark Cuban, mostly silent: The Mavericks have almost always made a deal at the deadline, going all the way back to when Don Nelson traded five of his players to the New Jersey Nets in 1997 for four of theirs. (Nellie then told a reporter on the phone of his departing players, \u2019\u2019they\u2019re a bunch of [bleeping] babies. And you can quote me on that.\u201d Since I was the reporter, I did.) But this year, the Mavs didn\u2019t move the expiring contract of Wesley Matthews or Nerlens Noel. Noel hadn\u2019t played well before getting hurt early in the season, and he turned down a four-year, $70 million offer . The Mavs did bring in Doug McDermott as part of a three-team deal that sent Devin Harris to Denver, and maybe McBuckets can finally find a home there. 6. Golden State, lacking nails: (Because the Warriors have a rickety bench. Get it?) The Warriors couldn\u2019t get Johnson or Belinelli, each of whom could have provided production in reserve, following their respective buyouts. Johnson was especially interesting, given that the Warriors saw him as a perfect fit for them, and they\u2019ve almost always gotten their man the last few years. That he chose Houston over the Warriors must cut to the quick. 7. Portland, out of the red: Wheee!! Trading Noah Vonleh to Chicago officially got the Blazers out of luxury tax jail for this year. They\u2019d already done the heavy lifting last July by sending the rest of Allen Crabbe\u2019s $75 million deal to Brooklyn last summer. Moving Vonleh\u2019s $3.5 million to the Bulls just finished the job. And while even owner Paul Allen is entitled to save money when he can, that\u2019s not quite as sexy a move as, say, getting DeAndre Jordan for the stretch drive would have been. 8. Al Jefferson \u2026 you\u2019re still here?: The veteran big man is only playing 13 minutes a night for the Pacers, and that\u2019s understandable. Myles Turner\u2019s in the middle for the bulk of Indiana\u2019s nightly run, and should be. But it\u2019s hard to imagine Jefferson couldn\u2019t have played the Nene role for someone else who still doesn\u2019t mind dumping the ball into the paint every once in a while and watching someone score from there.  9. Georgios Papagiannis, unemployed: Wasn\u2019t the Greek center one of Sacramento\u2019s first-round picks in 2016 ? Wasn\u2019t he part of the reason the Kings traded DeMarcus Cousins, because they had such a promising young big man who wouldn\u2019t cause nearly as much trouble ready to replace him? Didn\u2019t the Kings also acquire Malachi Richardson in the first round in 2016 ? Didn\u2019t they just dump him last week, too ? Okay, they did get the rights to Bogdan Bogdanovic in that 2016 Draft, too. One out of three is \u2026 decent. 10. The Pelicans, quizzical: Already down an All-Star after losing DeMarcus Cousins for the season, and putting Omer Asik into the deal that brought them Nikola Mirotic , give the Nets a solid veteran big in Dante Cunningham \u2026 why? Maybe they are, as the buzz has been for days, about to sign Andrew Bogut, in which case jettisoning Cunningham would make more sense. * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

And what will his future be, whether with the Los Angeles Lakers or someone else, next season? It\u2019s easy, now, to blame Thomas for much of what went wrong during what turned out to be just 15 games played for the Cavs before he was traded to the Lakers last week . But anyone who approaches this fairly has to have some sympathy for his position. He rushed to get back from the hip injury that ended his incredible run with the Celtics last June \u2014 against the Cavaliers. But he wasn\u2019t healthy enough to be able to participate in training camp after being traded to Cleveland in August. Once he finally was cleared to play in January, he had to use his first games as his preseason . He was getting his wind back while his teammates were in the throes of a terrible patch \u2014 one that Thomas\u2019 skill set was not equipped to fix. (As far as hip injuries go, it\u2019s hard to compare one to another, of course. And the record is mixed on full recovery\/return to former quality of play. Some, like Kevin Love, LaMarcus Aldridge and Otto Porter Jr., have come back and done well, though Porter continues to battle hip problems with the Wizards. But others like Jonny Flynn and Martell Webster couldn\u2019t overcome their hip injuries and had to retire. Gerald Henderson missed this season after suffering a hip injury last season, but is hopeful he\u2019ll return next season after extensive rehab.) So it\u2019s hard to hold Thomas responsible for what happened on the court when he came back. It\u2019s hard playing with LeBron James; even harder to try and learn how to do so on the fly. Almost every great offensive player\u2019s instinct is to attack with the ball, unless you\u2019re primarily a catch-and-shoot player. That\u2019s the exact opposite of what\u2019s worked best on the best James teams \u2014 him having the ball, deciding on where to pass it, then threading a dime to someone behind the 3-point line with their feet set. The one place where Thomas erred was talking so much while the Cavs were in their tailspin. He\u2019d built no currency in that locker room yet to speak with any authority about the Cavs\u2019 culture, how players reacted during adversity, etc . He hadn\u2019t been there the last three years, when they had their ups and downs, fired a coach, made trades, yet still made three straight Finals and won one . Going after Cavs coach Ty Lue publicly on end-game playcalling did nothing to endear Thomas with teammates, and especially James, who\u2019s been one of Lue\u2019s strongest defenders and proponents. Yet Thomas is still as lethal an offensive talent as any in the game when healthy. And he\u2019ll get the ball and plenty of shots with the Lakers. He came off the bench in his first game there Saturday and scored 22 points in 31 minutes, including 4 of 8 on 3-pointers , despite not knowing the plays or many of his new teammates. \u201cSaturday night, he looked like a $12-15 million guy,\u201d one team executive texted Sunday. Whether Thomas remains with the Lakers after this season is another question. The Lakers made the deal with Cleveland to clear enough cap space to go after two max free agents in July. Thomas, seemingly, will not be one of them. Long gone are the days when Thomas said the Celtics would have to \u201cback up the Brinks truck\u201d to pay him when he became a free agent, as well as dreams of a $200 million deal. The Lakers have Lonzo Ball , their 2017 first-rounder in whom they\u2019ve invested so much, at the point. Since Ball has been out with a sprained knee , Brandon Ingram has started in his place and done pretty well. It would make no sense for L.A. to put money into Thomas, even if it was inclined to do so, if it cost the Lakers a shot at James or Oklahoma City Thunder All-Star swingman Paul George. So, the next 30 games or so are almost certainly an audition for Thomas. But what is the landscape for him next summer? With only 6-8 teams having real cap room this summer, there just aren\u2019t going to be many able to put a huge deal on the table. A lot of front office types think it\u2019s most likely that Thomas signs a short deal rather than a long-term contract. It could wind up as a \u2018\u20191+1\u201d deal like the ones James and Kevin Durant have signed in recent years \u2014 a one-year deal with an option for a second year controlled by the player. Or, it could just be a one-year deal for big money similar to what J.J. Redick did ($23 million) with the Philadelphia 76ers last summer. Some executives believe that Thomas may have to settle for the mid-level exception, given the number of teams that are capped out and don\u2019t have a better mechanism to get quality players. \u201cNo max,\u201d one front office guy said. \u201cI predict he gets something in the neighborhood of 1 + 1 for $10 mil per year.\u201d Said another: \u201cDepends how he finishes the year. Due to the tight market, would not surprise me to see him at $12-15M or could be as low as a mid-level deal if one of the space teams does not value him.\u201d The non-Laker teams who should have the biggest cap room include the Atlanta Hawks, Dallas Mavericks, Chicago Bulls and Indiana Pacers. The Hawks have Dennis Schroeder; Dallas has rookie Dennis Smith, Jr.; the Bulls have Kris Dunn. The Pacers have an option for next season for veteran Darren Collison at $10 million. It would likely cost more to bring in a replacement player capable of starting at the point. And that\u2019s a problem for Thomas, too: position scarcity. \u201cI think he is screwed,\u201d said a former team executive who remains in regular contact with teams. \u201cHe will be looking at deals like Lou Williams (who signed a three-year extension with the Clippers last week at around $24 million ). Most teams have point guards and everyone knows he can be a little difficult. The real problem he is a scoring point in the mode of Allen Iverson. His best bet may be with the Lakers if they don\u2019t get two guys. They may pay him max money for one year.\u201d The Suns gave Thomas a four-year, $27 million deal in 2014 , as part of a sign-and-trade deal that brought him from Sacramento. The Suns then got a 2016 first-round pick from Boston when they traded Thomas to the Celtics in 2015 , after Thomas had only played a little more than half of one season with Phoenix. Even then, it wasn\u2019t easy for the Suns to get a first for Thomas. It would be impossible now; it was Cleveland that sent a 2018 first with Thomas to the Lakers. \u201cA lot of teams don\u2019t want small, ball-dominant point guards who are poor defenders,\u201d another executive said. \u201cI think his market may be the mid-level in the new NBA economy, especially when the hip injury is factored in.\u201d But if Thomas puts up numbers in L.A. and shows he\u2019s over the hip injury, he could pump his value back up some. Teams with cap room may want him, or at the least, may not get the guy or guys they do want and double back to him. A team like Orlando, for example, certainly is poised to be a player in free agency. And, the Magic just traded its starting point guard the last three years, Elfrid Payton, to Phoenix at the deadline . Thomas\u2019 market will also be determined by whether he\u2019s willing to come off the bench, as he appears to have settled on with the Lakers, or seeks a starting job. Lots of teams could use his energy and scoring in reserve, but likely wouldn\u2019t break the bank to get him. But \u2026 Thomas was a serious Kia MVP candidate in 2016-17, playing for a team that made the conference finals. He led the NBA in fourth-quarter scoring and was an All-Star . That is the resume of a max player. And yet \u2026 \u201cNo idea,\u201d said another executive, asked about Thomas\u2019 financial floor and ceiling this summer. \u201cThis market will be an interesting one and it\u2019s one I don\u2019t think everyone has a handle on yet.\u201d * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

From Jelani Scott: In the midst of all this excitement, most people have decided that, although they got younger and more athletic, the Cavaliers have gotten deeper without really addressing their biggest issue: rim protection. Who do you see the Cavs grabbing on the buyout market to address this issue, or do you think they\u2019d be fine without? I think Brandan Wright could\u2019ve been that dude for them, but the Houston Rockets are amassing an arsenal to wage war against the Warriors with after reportedly adding Wright and Joe Johnson . Didn\u2019t seem to be a problem Sunday in Boston, Jelani. If the new Cavs use their length and quickness out front, most people will never get to the front of the rim. Neither Boston nor Toronto pounds the ball into the paint, though Kyrie Irving is the only guy for whom no one in the game has an answer for keeping out of the paint. At a loss for words. From Simcha Heisler: Let\u2019s rewind. The only real trade assets the Clippers had going into the deadline \u2014 and by \u201creal,\u201d I mean guys you wouldn\u2019t have to attach another player and\/or Draft pick to be enticing to other teams \u2014 were DeAndre Jordan, Avery Bradley and Lou Williams. They weren\u2019t going to move Danilo Gallinari, Tobias Harris, Austin Rivers or Milos Teodosic. Cleveland had interest in Jordan, of course, but the Cavs wound up going in another direction Thursday, one we all saw. The Wizards tried, too, but wouldn\u2019t bite unless Jordan opted in for 2018-19 at $24.1 million \u2014 and weren\u2019t willing to discuss Kelly Oubre. OKC tried for Bradley, but couldn\u2019t make a deal. (I\u2019m told the Avery Bradley-Danny Green talk before the deadline was overblown, but can\u2019t help but think we haven\u2019t heard the last of AB to SA. He seems a natural for the Spurs\u2019 system at both ends, and one wonders what his value on the open market will really be in July at the easiest position to fill\/replace on a team.) And the Clips opted to give Williams an extension at a very reasonable price ($8 million season per through 2021) when it became clear they wouldn\u2019t be able to pry a first from anyone for him. In any event, L.A. was not motivated to have a fire sale; the Clippers think they have to be competitive next season in order to be able to attract free agents in the summer of \u201919. (It is Los Angeles; you can\u2019t just put a G League product on the floor at those ticket and suite prices.) You may think their plan is wrong, but I don\u2019t think moving Jordan and\/or Bradley just for the sake of moving them wouldn\u2019t have made a lot of sense, either. Don\u2019t Play it Again, Sam. From Howard Bealick: Did I miss the news conference where Westbrook signed with the Lakers? I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s still appearing nightly at Chesapeake Energy Arena in Oklahoma City. If you meant to say \u201cHarden,\u201d as in James Harden \u2026 well, hey, Presti and the franchise can be criticized for it. I\u2019m not sure Harden would have ever become what he\u2019s become in Houston had he stayed in OKC, though. So the alternative would have been to trade either Westbrook or Durant, or maybe both of them, to let Harden flourish with the ball in his hands. And, when your owner says he\u2019s not paying luxury tax, as Clay Bennett was unwilling to do at the time, there\u2019s not much you can do to keep your superstars. If Westbrook or Durant had been a free agent then, the Thunder may have had to move them, too. And: t he Harden trade, as unpalatable as it may still be to many , netted OKC the first-round pick that became Steven Adams. That the Thunder still employ Westbrook, and will through 2022, is no small feat. And that only happened, I\u2019m fairly certain, because Presti and his front office were able to get Paul George and Anthony. Kanter\u2019s doing in New York what he always does \u2014 score. He\u2019s a very good offensive talent. I think OKC is nonetheless happy with its end of the deal, and with its GM.

The Cavs took back 94 playoff games\u2019 worth of experience \u2014 and George Hill has 83 of those, with Rodney Hood having the other 11; Jordan Clarkson and Larry Nance, Jr., have yet to play in a postseason game. 1) The Truth, up in the rafters where he belongs . Congratulations. I still have Bill Russell, John Havlicek, Larry Bird and Pierce on the Celtics\u2019 Mount Rushmore. Could be wrong. But I doubt it. 2) Utah is doing damage to folks. Winners of nine straight, the Jazz has gotten right back in the playoff race in the Western Conference. Rudy Gobert is back and dominating. And it says here (again) that Jae Crowder is going to play much, much better in the 801 than he did in Cleveland. 3 ) Great fun working with former Cavs\u2019 GM David Griffin during our trade deadline shows Thursday on NBA TV. Griff\u2019s knowledge about the Cavs and LeBron was deep and emotive and made our coverage second to none, I think, and he was great on the cap and the Lakers and everything else. Delighted he\u2019s on our team. 4) Once again, knowing full well that the Olympics are a complete financial boondoggle that often ruins the host city , if not country, for years economically, and that the pursuit of Olympic gold has led to abuses ranging from doping to the monstrous life of USA Gymnastics \u201cphysician\u201d Larry Nassar (not to mention dictators and other strongmen using the Games for their own, awful purposes ), I was still mesmerized by the opening ceremonies of the Winter Games in PyeongChang Friday. I know it\u2019s a show and a hype and it\u2019s not real, and it won\u2019t bring North and South Korea together. It was still beautiful. Drones forming the Olympic Rings, over synchronized skiiers \u2026 dude. 5) When you\u2019re 85 and have no more (bleeps) to give . 1) Condolences to Rick Adelman and his wife Mary Kay on the death of their son R.J., a former Rockets assistant coach who was killed after being struck by a minivan while crossing a street in Houston Feb. 2. R.J. Adelman worked for the then Seattle SuperSonics, Kings and Timberwolves as well during his career. RIP. 2) Godspeed and good luck to Dan Gilbert\u2019s son, Nick,  reportedly set to undergo brain surgery this week as he continues to battle neurofibromatosis, a disorder that causes tumors to form on nerve tissues. 3) Not your best couple of weeks , Boston sports media .

The Celtics retired Pierce\u2019s No. 34 on Sunday following the Celtics\u2019 121-99 loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers. He became the 23rd person in franchise history to have his number or name enshrined by the Celtics organization. The honor capped a 19-year career for Pierce, who was named NBA Finals MVP in 2008 when the Celtics captured their 17th championship. After the game, Pierce, clad in a green plaid blazer, entered the court via the newly named Paul Pierce Players\u2019 Tunnel. The team said the tunnel, featuring Pierce\u2019s signature, will serve as a reminder to current and future players of what \u201cbeing a Celtic\u201d means. When his jersey was raised, Pierce was serenaded with chants of \u201cThank You, Paul Pierce!\u201d \u201cThis is just a special day,\u201d Pierce said afterward. \u201cIf I never make the Hall of Fame or anything, to go up in the rafters as a retired number for the Celtics \u2013 that\u2019s just enough. That\u2019s enough for me. \u2026 When you\u2019re forever with the Celtics, you\u2019re forever.\u201d The 40-year-old Pierce retired after last season. He tops the Celtics\u2019 all-time lists in 3-pointers made (1,823), free throws (6,434) and steals (1,583). He is Boston\u2019s second all-time leading scorer with 24,021 points, trailing only John Havlicek. His 15 seasons also trail only Havlicek\u2019s 16 for the longest stint with the team. Current Celtics players gathered to watch the ceremony, and legends including Robert Parish, Cedric Maxwell and Tom \u201cSatch\u201d Sanders sat on the court. Pierce credited his mother, Lorraine Hosey, and brothers Jamal and Steve Hosey, for inspiring him. \u201cIt starts at home. It starts where you come from,\u201d Pierce said. He later cried when acknowledging his wife, Julie, and their three children. Pierce sat next to the 2008 championship trophy as the team showered him with tributes. Along with having his number retired, Pierce also received a framed replica of the banner that his No. 34 will be added to, a Rolex watch, a piece of the Celtics\u2019 parquet floor and a stained-glass backboard adorned with his number. A weekend of festivities in honor of Pierce began with a private dinner hosted by the Celtics on Saturday night. Parish attended along with several of Pierce\u2019s former teammates, including Antoine Walker, Walter McCarty, Brian Scalabrine and Leon Powe. Pierce said the honors reminded him of how much he sacrificed during his career. He said being a Celtic was \u201cmeant to be.\u201d During the game, the Celtics showed video segments that highlighted Pierce\u2019s basketball journey. The clips went as far back as his Inglewood High School days and included interviews with friends, family and former teammates. There were also surprise recorded tributes from NBA greats Magic Johnson and Kobe Bryant. Pierce smiled as Bryant said in his message that Pierce made \u201call the Celtics legends proud.\u201d Pierce sat courtside with his family and Celtics co-owner Wyc Grousbeck. Former Celtics coach Doc Rivers and teammates Kevin Garnett and Rajon Rondo \u2013 all part of the 2008 title run \u2013 sat together nearby. Rivers told the crowd about conversations he and Pierce used to have about the day his number would be retired. He said the 2008 championship solidified Pierce\u2019s status as an all-time great in Boston. \u201cI just think it always cements it. When you win a title you become a main man, and that made Paul,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cHe would have had this night regardless of winning the title, but winning the title makes this day pretty special.\u201d A touching moment came near the end of Pierce\u2019s speech when his son, Prince, placed a No. 34 cap atop the 2008 trophy. \u201cI did the trifecta,\u201d Pierce said. \u201cI left a legacy.

No, really. The best player of his generation hasn\u2019t always had the deck stacked in his favor, he hasn\u2019t always been on the best team. You do remember don\u2019t you? Earlier in his career, before his Heatles days, during his first stint in Cleveland, when he and the upstart Cavaliers had to fight through an incumbent Eastern Conference power in Detroit to make it to The Finals in 2007 . The Big 3 Boston Celtics provided a similar roadblock after he conquered the Pistons, proving once again that just because you are recognized as the world\u2019s best player doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s your world come championship time. It wasn\u2019t until LeBron and the loaded Miami Heat won back-to-back titles in 2012 and 2013 in the middle of a four-year run of Finals that he finally found out what it was like to have it all. And that sensation didn\u2019t last. And not once in the Cavaliers\u2019 current run of three straight trips to The Finals have they been favored against the Golden State Warriors, who own a 2-1 edge in the championship round as both teams plot their courses for a fourth trip this season. If the Cavaliers do have a chance to get there this season, it\u2019ll take some of LeBron\u2019s very best work (remember, this is the man who helped wipe out Cleveland\u2019s 52-year title drought by vanquishing a record-setting 73-win Warriors team in The Finals two years ago). He\u2019s attempting to resuscitate the Cavaliers\u2019 season right now in the aftermath of a seismic trade deadline performance authored by Cleveland general manager Koby Altman \u2014 six players shipped out, four new faces added during a whirlwind day that shook up the entire league. And guess who\u2019s on the hook for making it all come together on the floor? That\u2019s right, the 7-13 slide between Christmas and the deadline was on a little of everybody, but mainly jettisoned former All-Star point guards Isaiah Thomas (Lakers) and Derrick Rose (Utah and eventually waived), neither of whom was a great fit alongside LeBron in the limited action we saw from both. But now it\u2019s on LeBron to make sure new faces George Hill and Jordan Clarkson, Larry Nance Jr. and Rodney Hood all find a rhythm, and quickly. If the first glimpse of the, as Altman coined it, a \u201crejuvenated\u201d LeBron came Friday night here in a rout of the lowly Atlanta Hawks , the immediate future of this lab experiment could get very interesting down the stretch of the regular season. LeBron refused to throw shade on those who had departed before, during and after his 22-point, 12-rebound and career-high 19 assist triple-double. And he served up the perfect reminder with his new teammates in the building but not yet cleared to play, that everyone wins when the Cavaliers play his way. The signs of new life for these Cavaliers were obvious, even with only a skeleton crew available against the Hawks. LeBron\u2019s 10th triple-double of the season was bolstered by a 30-point outing from Kyle Korver, who drained seven of his 13 shots from beyond the 3-point line and looked a decade younger version of himself. Jeff Green (24 points) and rookie Cedi Osman, who has quickly become LeBron\u2019s favorite pet project, had his best outing of the season with a career-high 16 points, six rebounds, five assists and three steals. \u201cWe played together offensively and defensively. The communication was very high,\u201d he said. \u201cThe ball was moving around. The ball was popping. Everybody felt like we were in a good rhythm. This team has played us tough every single season, no matter their record. Tonight, we finally played them tough. We played Cavaliers basketball.\u201d LeBron acknowledged the daunting challenge ahead, reassured anyone wondering if he\u2019s up for it that he most certainly is, and confirmed his commitment to finishing this season the same way he has each and every one of his past seven seasons: playing for a title. The newcomers will have all of one workout under their belts before the Cavaliers hit the floor at TD Garden for a Sunday showdown with the Boston Celtics ( 3:30 ET on ABC ) and the player truly responsible for Altman\u2019s Thursday roster overhaul, Kyrie Irving. Without his offseason trade request (demand \u2026 or whatever you want to call it) after three fruitful but apparently frustrating season\u2019s trying it LeBron\u2019s way, the Cavaliers are still sitting in the favorite\u2019s spot for that fourth straight Finals showdown with the Warriors. And to be sure, Kyrie and his new team will have something to say about who comes out of the Eastern Conference this year, as will the Toronto Raptors. Focusing on the past, or what could have or should have been, or even the competition angling to keep the Cavaliers from playing deep into he summer, doesn\u2019t aid LeBron\u2019s cause now. It\u2019s what goes on today and every day through mid-April and beyond, that will make or break this season for the Cavaliers. \u201cIt\u2019s not about what the other guys didn\u2019t bring, or what these guys bring,\u201d LeBron said. \u201cI think we\u2019re all professionals. We\u2019re happy with the guys that we had, and we\u2019re going to be happy with the guys that we have now. That\u2019s the way the league is, and the business. There\u2019s no shade on anybody. We\u2019re excited about the new guys that we have coming in \u2013 Jordan (Clarkson), Larry (Nance, Jr.), Rodney (Hood) and George (Hill) \u2013 and we look forward to them getting acclimated to what we want to do and finishing this regular season on a high note.\u201d History tells us that if any player is built for this sort of burden, for this type of against-all-odds adventure, it\u2019s the guy who has been there before, time and time again. And we should expect some of his best work. Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

There was no love shown from Griffin to his old crew before, during or after the Clippers\u2019 win over the Pistons Friday night at Little Caesars Arena in Detroit.

Contracts are shorter. So is the patience of both management and players. Fail to win, get stuck, underachieve, ask out, and you\u2019re gone. All the change makes for fun television, though. Celtics-Cavs was one of the most highly anticipated opening nights in recent memory thanks to the offseason trade that saw Kyrie Irving go from Cleveland to Boston. DeMarcus Cousins made waves in his first return to Sacramento since getting traded last year, posting 41 points and 23 rebounds in a dominant reminder of why trading players of his caliber is such a hard call to make. Every episode Durant vs. Westbrook\/OKC is must-see TV . Friday saw three such reunions take place on the same night. Blake Griffin faced the team that traded him less than two weeks ago. Jimmy Butler returned to the Windy City. Dwyane Wade went back to South Beach. Here\u2019s a look at each reuniting, why it mattered, and how it unfolded: Reunion signficance: With Chris Paul having departed via trade and Griffin having just signed a five-year extension, the 6-10 forward had a chance to go down as the best and longest-tenured player in franchise history. Frankly, it would have been nice to see that happen after decades of Clipper bad luck and worse play. Instead, LA pivoted midseason when they realized the team they re-assembled around Griffin was no sure bet to make the postseason in the brutal Western Conference. They dealt him and his enormous contract to Detroit in exchange for less money, decent talent and a pair of draft picks. The move was an abrupt about-face from their off-season pitch to Griffin, which was basically, \u201cYou are the guy, and we want your life to be a montage of Clipper awesomeness.\u201d Griffin himself was \u201cshocked\u201d at the move. Eleven days later, he was forced to face the only team he had played for in his seven-and-a-half years in the league. Vibe heading in: Definitely centered on Griffin. The game was in Detroit, so there was no feel-good return tribute. Instead, this was about Griffin vs. old teammates, including fellow former All-Star DeAndre Jordan. This was very much like the dumped boy\/girlfriend being at the same party as the person who dumped him\/her. Griffin has a new All-Star center (Drummond), a new high-profile coach (Stan Van Gundy) and a new blue-and-red team (Pistons) riding a seven-game winning streak. Would Griffin successfully prove he was better off without the Clippers than vice versa? How it unfolded: Griffin\u2019s offensive game was off from the start. He missed his first four shots and picked up an early technical foul after a brief dust-up with former Pistons guard Avery Bradley. The former Clipper star still showed the strength and basketball IQ that made him so invaluable in LA. The Pistons, however, sputtered in the fourth quarter, and the Clippers pulled away for the 108-95 win . Highlight: Montrezl Harrell was teammates with Griffin for less than a season, so it\u2019s hard to imagine there being much previous history between them. That didn\u2019t stop them from making some. Late in the third quarter, Griffin used his vintage strength and speed to dribble coast-to-coast, bull-doze Harrell and still convert an and-one layup. On the very next possession, it looked like Harrell might exact revenge after winding up with a loose ball near the rim. Griffin met and completely snuffed his dunk attempt, then added a dis to his defense by throwing the ball off Harrell and out-of-bounds. And yes, Griffin loved every part of the sequence. Quest for closure: The final score wound up giving the Clippers their 28th win of the season. The Pistons also have 28 wins, but it was their first loss since the two teams executed the season-altering trade. The Pistons are all in on Griffin in a way he thought the Clippers once were. It appears that he is also all-in on Detroit, as Griffin wanted nothing to do with post-game handshakes or greetings with any of his former teammates. Reunion significance: Other than Hall-of-Fame forward Spencer Haywood , Jimmy Butler might be the best 30th overall pick in NBA history. Yet despite his three NBA All-Defensive Second Team honors, a trio of All-Star appearances and last year\u2019s All-NBA Third Team recognition, the Bulls seemed unusually willing to shop him as soon as his 2015 contract extension matched his production. That might have had something to do with Chicago winning only one playoff round over the last four years. They were never able to successfully build around Butler, so instead they opted for a complete tear-down last summer. The Bulls traded him to Minnesota in exchange for more youthful, if less developed talent. Butler told reporters after the deal that he had \u201calready moved past it,\u201d but he did contribute his own take on why the Bulls did what they did. \u201cThey weren\u2019t convinced I was good enough \u2014 whatever you want to call it, I don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. Now Chicago is headed for the NBA lottery, while Butler is an All-Star representing a Timberwolves team headed for its first postseason berth since 2004. Vibe heading in: Vengeance bubbling just beneath the surface. Heading into his return to Chicago, Butler repeatedly dubbed it just \u201canother basketball game.\u201d Bulls VP John Paxson was slightly more honest . \u201cThe one thing that we learned about Jimmy while he was here is that he\u2019s motivated by a lot of things, but he\u2019s motivated by having that chip on his shoulder,\u201d Paxson said. How it unfolded: Bittersweetly. Butler showed every reason why many Bulls fans were unhappy with giving him up, finishing with 38 points, seven rebounds, five assists and four steals. His effort was trumped, however, by the reverse angle of the Bulls-Timberwolves revenge story. Former Minnesota guard Zach LaVine had his best game yet since returning from a torn ACL, hitting the go-ahead free throws in the closing seconds to give Chicago a dramatic 114-113 victory . LaVine had to make his new team feel pretty good about the future, finishing with 35 points of his own, including 15 in the fourth quarter. Highlight(s): After a Karl-Anthony Towns miss, the Timberwolves got the offensive rebound and the ball back to Butler, who had a last-second chance to drive the ultimate dagger into his former team. His 3-pointer missed, forcing him to leave his old gym with an unexpected loss. On the plus side, Butler did receive a heartfelt tribute and ovation from his original NBA team. Quest for closure: While Butler is no doubt disappointed about losing his return game to Chicago, he has to feel good about being on the most talented team of his career. The Timberwolves are a more-than-solid playoff team with the inside track on homecourt advantage in the first round. Key teammates such as Andrew Wiggins and Karl-Anthony Towns should only get better. This season, he has confirmed the opinion that he is a franchise player capable of leading a team to games that matter in April. It will be worth monitoring how well the Bulls fare. Seventh overall pick Lauri Markkanen has blown away expectations. Zach LaVine has hit the ground running since returning from injury, and former Wolves lottery pick Kris Dunn was enjoying a breakout season before a concussion sidelined him in mid-January. It may take a few years to see which team actually won this particular trade. Reunion signficance: Unlike the previous trips down memory lane, this one is all love. As a courtesy to Wade\u2019s wishes and legacy, Cleveland traded him to Miami for next to nothing before Thursday\u2019s deadline. There is no exaggerating the emotional significance of Wade back in South Beach. He is the best player in franchise history and a leading force behind all three of the championship banners hanging in American Airlines Arena. ESPN\u2019s Darren Rovell reported that when the Heat made his City Edition jersey available for purchase online, it sold in over 100 countries in 15 hours, and that team merchandise sales were up 8000-percent. Wade County, indeed. Vibe heading in: Historically happy. How many players are with a franchise long enough to be iconic, get traded, but still have a chance to return and play for the team that made them iconic in the first place? Too often, the last step is left incomplete. George Gervin, Patrick Ewing and Hakeem Olajuwon are just a few examples. Instead, Wade and Miami get to enjoy all the welcome home feels. It felt wrong when they were apart. A year-and-a-half later, they get the rare chance to make it right. How it unfolded: On a team scale, about as well as you could have hoped. Miami struggled from the start, got an unbelievable emotional lift once Wade come off the bench to steady the ship, then blew the game open in the third quarter. We\u2019ll excuse Wade\u2019s 1-for-6 shooting and four turnovers as a consequence of reacquainting himself with his old gym. That and he came up with the game-clinching block. Highlight: Wade didn\u2019t start, but that was probably a good thing. That meant even the late shows to the game could witness his anticipated return to the court. He checked in with 5:19 remaining in the first quarter, and when he did\u2026 well, see for yourself: Quest for closure: Wade is synonymous with the Heat, and the world feels a little more right now that they\u2019re back together. Questions still remain. Will he continue to come off the bench? Will Miami re-sign him this offseason? For now, however, the two parties are simply grateful to be reunited, as is the NBA world."},{"id":41803,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/reports-brandan-wright-bought-out-sign-houston-rockets","date":"2018-02-10","title":"Reports: Brandan Wright to be bought out, sign with Houston Rockets","content":"The Houston Rockets will add a little more defense and depth to their frontline in their chase to overtake Golden State.

Dwayne Wade was back with the Heat on Friday night, coming off the bench for Miami. As the Heat fell behind 9-0, the crowd chanted, \u201cWe want Wade!\u201d Wade took the court midway through the first quarter as the fans gave him a standing ovation. He immediately grabbed a defensive rebound and threw a lob pass to Hassan Whiteside, who was able to slam home a dunk. Wade is Miami\u2019s all-time leader in points, games, assists and steals. He was drafted in the first round by Miami in 2003, but left for Chicago in 2016. Miami acquired him from Cleveland as part of the Cavaliers\u2019 deadline-day makeover. His return seemed to put everybody with the franchise in a good mood Friday, from office workers to coach Erik Spolestra. \u201cI definitely feel it\u2019s going to be a great environment,\u201d Wade said before the game. It was. The lower bowl was full before tip-off, an uncommon sight for a typical Heat regular season game, as they awaited to see their superstar come off the bench. But no one really saw this coming, not even Spolestra. Prior to Thursday\u2019s practice, Spoelstra received updates on possible trades in Pat Riley\u2019s office. Riley informed him there was a possibility to acquire Luke Babbitt and also Wade. Spoelstra was about to leave Riley\u2019s office when the news sank in. \u201cWhat?\u201d Spoelstra said. \u201cDwyane who?\u201d Riley explained to Spoelstra about the player movement in the league and a Wade deal could potentially happen. \u201cWe\u2019ll let you know by the end of practice,\u201d Riley said. The coach said, \u201cMy only response was, `Let\u2019s go, let\u2019s do it.\u2019 But it was probably not something any of us foresaw two weeks ago. Crazy things happen in this league so it just absolutely perfect timing for both parties and it was actually surreal of how quickly it came about.\u201d Wade could hardly wait. \u201cI\u2019m excited for a lot of different reasons, but definitely the fan base that I grew up with and grew up with me, and just to be back in the environment,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m excited for my teammates as well. When you go through a long season, this team is on a five-game losing streak, sometimes it\u2019s a lull, and to kind of get a jolt of energy like tonight will be in the arena, the atmosphere will be great. I think it\u2019s going to be great for everybody as we go down the stretch of the season. I\u2019m just excited to put on that jersey again and get out there and try not to be too bad.\u201d Wade was embraced by his teammates, many of whom he played with in his last season in Miami two years ago, which should help him make a smooth transition to a team sitting at 29-26 looking to improve its playoff standing. \u201cI feel like I know these guys,\u201d Wade said. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m a part of this team already. When we played them, just the love that everyone always showed me before and after games, coming back to Miami in the summer and seeing these guys around, spending time with them so that transition right there was pretty seamless for me coming in today.\u201d Wade snuck up on Josh Richardson in the training room and gave him a playful push. \u201cIt was cool,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cIt kind of felt like he never left.\u201d"},{"id":41807,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/atlanta-hawks-buy-out-veteran-marco-belinelli-contract","date":"2018-02-10","title":"Atlanta Hawks buy out veteran Marco Belinelli's contract","content":"ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 The Atlanta Hawks have bought out 3-point specialist Marco Belinelli\u2019s contract, giving the 11th-year veteran an opportunity to finish the season on a contending team.

As far as a lot of Bulls and NBA fans are concerned, though, his comeback began an instant before LaVine got the ball in the second quarter of Monday\u2019s game at Sacramento and ended moments later to Jakarr Sampson\u2019s extreme dismay. With time running down late in the period, LaVine turned the left corner on the Kings\u2019 Garrett Temple and exploded toward the rim. Sampson, leaving his man to help, arrived late and paid a poster-worthy price. Wham! Bulls TV analyst Stacy King\u2019s narration of the play and several replays can take us from here: \u201cStop it, Sampson! He didn\u2019t come for the massage, he came for the facial! Oh my goodness. Why, Sampson, why! I think he didn\u2019t remember that Zach LaVine is a dunk contest winner. \u2026 Look at Sampson, Sampson\u2019s upset. You know, when you get dunked on, you want to push somebody. \u201cWhy even jump? \u2026 He\u2019s back, ladies and gentlemen.\u201d Easier said than done, for both LaVine\u2019s statement dunk and the comeback that dragged on with an indefinite return date and no guaranteed result from the moment the 22-year-old wing went down in Detroit last Feb. 4. LaVine \u2013 who switched teams from Minnesota to Chicago while rehabbing, via the Jimmy Butler trade on draft night last June \u2013 wasn\u2019t as wowed by the West Coast moment as folks who knew him mostly from the highlights and his reputation as a two-time Slam Dunk champ (2015 in New York and 2016 in Toronto). \u201cIt\u2019s just another play to me because I don\u2019t have to think about it,\u201d LaVine told NBA.com in a conversation this week. \u201cI went into the [rehab] process knowing that, I\u2019m a pretty mentally tough kid. So I got over the \u2018scared\u2019 factor. To me, it was just another dunk. Ha!\u201d Even LaVine had to laugh at making the remarkable sound mundane. His leaping ability and in-air maneuvering appear to deny, not just defy, gravity. Did before the injury, and do again. \u201cBut I was more in tune with the game than anything,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t see it from the outside, from the fans\u2019 perspective where, \u2018Oh, Zach dunked on somebody again.\u2019 To me, it was two points and I went on to the next play. I feel like it gives other people confidence, but I already had the confidence.\u201d Chicago\u2019s trip to face the Trail Blazers, the Clippers and the Kings was notable for LaVine because the fourth-year wing averaged 23.7 points, 4.0 rebounds, 2.7 assists and 1.3 steals, while making 10 of his 18 3-pointers and shooting 46.9 percent overall. After returning in the Bulls\u2019 43rd game on Jan. 13 on a tight 20-minute leash, LaVine played 31 minutes in each of the past two games. Heading into Friday\u2019s home game against the Timberwolves ( 9:30 ET on ESPN ) \u2013 a big return game for the Wolves\u2019 Butler and Taj Gibson but emotional for LaVine too, given the Minnesota roots to his career \u2013 he\u2019s happy with what he knows is a progression, not some isolated highlight. \u201cIt\u2019s about getting back into the flow of things,\u201d LaVine said. \u201cIt\u2019s inconsistency. You haven\u2019t played in NBA games in almost a year, so you can\u2019t simulate your legs being fatigued the way they get. It\u2019s a matter of getting back into it and learning to be OK with sometimes struggling at points to get you better.\u201d Only a handful of players have won more than once the Slam Dunk contest that began at the 1984 All-Star Weekend. Two are legends: Michael Jordan and Dominique Wilkins. Three are footnotes: Harold Miner, Jason Richardson and Nate Robinson. LaVine wants to wind up closer to the former than to the latter, when the story of his career is complete. The Bulls want that, too, since they\u2019ll be the ones most likely to pay him after he hits restricted free agency this summer. One fellow who knows LaVine and his game well believes he\u2019s a sound investment. \u201cI think Zach has All-Star potential. I really do,\u201d said Sam Mitchell, who coached LaVine in his first two NBA seasons, first as a Minnesota assistant, then as a hurried replacement when Flip Saunders died in October 2015. \u201cI think he has the chance to be one of the best two guards in the league. \u201cHe\u2019s got unlimited range shooting. He\u2019s a gym rat, he loves working on his game. He loves getting better. I\u2019ve got nothing but high praise for Zach and obviously the Bulls feel the same way or they wouldn\u2019t have traded Jimmy Butler for him.\u201d In so many ways, LaVine and Butler hardly could be more different. LaVine comes from a solid, athletic family background, his father Paul a former USFL and NFL replacement linebacker and his mother C.J. a softball player. Butler was tossed out of his own home in Tomball, Texas, as a teenager, by a mother overwhelmed in raising him. LaVine went to UCLA, one of college basketball\u2019s most celebrated institutions, and managed to turn the attention he got in one season as a reserve there into a legitimate shot at the NBA. Butler spent one year at Tyler (Texas) Community College, which earned him the right to be a near-nobody again the next year at Marquette. LaVine was a lottery pick, No. 13 in 2014, a reach by a coach\/president of basketball operations who nonetheless handed him game opportunities to learn. Butler just snuck into the first round in 2011, and had to earn grudging minutes from a coach predisposed to dismiss rookies. LaVine has made his name in the league courtesy of the Slam Dunk contest, unsheathed a blistering 3-point shot last season before he got hurt and still needs remedial work on the defensive end. Butler pushed into former Chicago coach Tom Thibodeau\u2019s rotation with his defense, grew his game one facet at a time and plugged his way to what will be his fourth All-Star Game Feb. 18 in Los Angeles.  The two men, however, do have one particular thing in common: they are, as it\u2019s so indelicately put in this game, gym rats. Which is to say, what cheese is to the rodent world, hardwood is to guys like LaVine, Butler and a million others who love them some basketball. The irony is that, while gym rats are easy to spot at YMCAs and in rec leagues, they\u2019re much more rare at the NBA level. It\u2019s like the rest of us; once your passion becomes your job, it\u2019s sometimes hard to keep it as your passion. Now imagine forcefully separating the rat from his pack. \u201cIt\u2019s terrible,\u201d LaVine said of the early months of rehab, where he wasn\u2019t allowed to practice even the most rudimentary basketball skills. \u201cIt was terrible. That was the hardest thing for me, dealing with that. But it\u2019s the best thing for you at the time, because you can\u2019t be putting too much stress on [the leg]. So you work on your body in different ways and you try to better yourself, and keep your mind working.\u201d The one-year anniversary of LaVine\u2019s injury passed without celebration but without incident, too, a normal NBA day in Sacramento between road games. Normal, of course, is good compared to what came before. \u201cThere were a lot of ups and downs,\u201d LaVine said of his rehabilitation regimen, split between Minnesota, Los Angeles and finally Chicago. \u201cIt takes a long time. And especially when you\u2019re injured in the middle of a season \u2013 that\u2019s why I feel for KP [Knicks forward Kristaps Porzingis] right now, having a great year. I said some words to him on Twitter.\u201d Porzingis\u2019 season ended Tuesday when the ACL in his left knee ruptured Tuesday . He\u2019s now on the LaVine track and the track of so many other ACL survivors, an NBA fraternity of which no one wants to be a member. \u201cMe and Jabari [Parker, Milwaukee\u2019s two-time ACL patient] talked,\u201d LaVine said. \u201cJamal Crawford is one of my good friends, Nate Robinson, and they both had one. Ricky Rubio had one. So I talked to a lot of guys that knew about it personally and they helped me get through little things that were tough. \u201cI think everybody does it differently. Whatever works for them is the best. But you\u2019ve just got to attack it. You\u2019ve got to go into it with the right mindset. You can\u2019t be \u2018poor me\u2019 or anything like that. It\u2019s a really messed-up injury but the way technology is now and how driven us athletes are, you come back better. Many trainers and coaches, going on experience, believe that the first full season after an ACL victim\u2019s comeback is when they\u2019re fully, finally \u201cback.\u201d But so far, so good, says LaVine, claiming no concessions at all to the injury. \u201cI\u2019ve got my same explosiveness. Same quickness,\u201d he said. \u201cI got a little bit stronger and grew my game a little bit.\u201d Crawford, who has known LaVine since he was in high school as members of Seattle\u2019s tight basketball community, is a close friend (in spite of a wicked prank pulled for a late-night talk show). The veteran NBA scorer, now with Minnesota, said he never doubted LaVine would work his way all the way back. \u201cWhen it happened, I was one of the first people to text him,\u201d Crawford said Wednesday after Minnesota\u2019s game in Cleveland. \u201cPeople around the league always feel bad for their brothers when they first go down. But he was probably the most positive. He got back to me: \u2018Nah, I\u2019ll be back. No problem.\u2019\u201d It figures to be Butler\u2019s night at United Center. Butler\u2019s and Gibson\u2019s and even Thibodeau\u2019s, the three former Bulls favorites reunited in the Twin Cities. They are bound to end the Timberwolves franchise\u2019s 13-year playoff drought, the NBA\u2019s longest. The Bulls? Not so much. They\u2019re about to renew one, missing the postseason for only the third time in the past 14 seasons. A lot of their customers are cranky about it, too, unconvinced about the rebuilding embraced ever so eagerly John Paxson and Gar Forman in the front office and coach Fred Hoiberg. LaVine said he won\u2019t take personally any love lavished on the former Bulls, even though he\u2019s linked by trade to Butler. \u201cThey deserve a standing ovation,\u201d he said. \u201cDudes who spent how many years here? They put hard work and dedication into the team and into the city just like we\u2019re going to do. So I expect nothing less than a big ovation for those guys.\u201d The trade that shipped Butler and the Bulls\u2019 No. 16 pick in the first round to Minnesota (Creighton center Justin Patton) delivered LaVine, guard Kris Dunn and the No. 7 pick (Arizona\u2019s Lauri Markkanen) to the Bulls. No one doubted Butler would have an impact on the Wolves \u2013 he\u2019s an alpha dog brought in to show his young teammates how to win, how to not back down. The other side of the ledger was more of an unknown, given Dunn\u2019s disappointing rookie season, Markkanen\u2019s slim frame and NBA unfamiliarity, and LaVine\u2019s injury. But the first two have shown plenty to Chicago \u2013 Dunn playing like the Rookie of the Year favorite he was supposed to be last season, Markkanen demonstrating a feathery 3-point shot as well as grit in the paint. That leaves LaVine, who no longer carries the burden to make the trade successful but doesn\u2019t want to be the laggard either. \u201cThis is one of the rare instances where there\u2019s a trade that worked for both,\u201d said Mitchell, who works now as a studio analyst for NBA TV and in Toronto where he coached from 2004-2008. \u201cJimmy Butler obviously is a good player \u2013 Minnesota got a veteran guy who can lead them to the playoffs. But Chicago got three, young talented players who are going to be starters for them. And out of the three, one or two of them is going to make a copule of All Star teams.\u201d Said Thibodeau, who made the deal as both Wolves coach and president of basketball operations: \u201cBoth teams, we just happened to fit each other. What we were looking for, what they were looking for, we matched up. Jimmy has transformed our organization, just from going from where we were to winning, which I think is the most important statistic there is. And then Chicago, they had a great run and thought it was time to reset, and they\u2019re well on their way.\u201d LaVine shrugged off the suggestion that he faces less pressure to balance out the trade, based on Markkanen\u2019s and Dunn\u2019s play so far. And Mitchell knew he would. \u201cZach don\u2019t think like that,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cHe just loves playing ball, man. He\u2019s not thinking it and I\u2019m glad he doesn\u2019t. Sometimes young players get traded and they hear people praising them or talking about big plans, they lose focus on their growth and development. All Zach cares about is winning and getting better. \u201cI told him when he got traded, \u2018This is a good move for you.\u2019 He said, \u2018Why?\u2019 \u2018Because in Minnesota, you were always going to be the third wheel [behind Karl-Anthony Towns and Andrew Wiggins]. In Chicago, they don\u2019t have a pecking order. So if you go in and prove that you\u2019re \u2018that guy,\u2019 you\u2019re going to be \u2018that guy.\u2019 Or one of \u2018those guys.\u2019 Said LaVine about facing his pals from Minnesota (Dunn remains out while recovering from a January concussion): \u201cI\u2019ve just got on a different uniform now. We still have the same friendships. But it\u2019s game time. I played there for three years, so I think there will be a lot of competition. A lot of trash talking, and some fun as well. But people who will try to evaluate who got a good trade out of one game really aren\u2019t basketball people.\u201d LaVine also won\u2019t let himself feel rushed to cram a season\u2019s worth of achievement into 29 games. He won\u2019t necessarily be negotiating this summer from a position of strength in restricted free agency, but between his ongoing potential and established work habits, he believes business will take care of itself. Most likely right where he\u2019s at in Chicago. \u201cWhatever happens is going to happen. I have no fear in that,\u201d LaVine said. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate I had the injury. I was in a good spot in Minnesota, the team was picking it up at that time. But that\u2019s part of the game \u2013 injuries happen \u2013 and one way or another, I\u2019ll get a contract sooner or later. That doesn\u2019t worry me at all. I know my play and my hard work and dedication will take care of that. \u201cI\u2019m working my butt off every day to play that out. I think I\u2019m gonna be fine and the team\u2019s gonna be fine.\u201d Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

A day after the Cavaliers overhauled their roster with a tornado of trades that ripped through the NBA, James didn\u2019t dwell on what\u2019s lost, who\u2019s no longer around or how much time Cleveland has left to salvage its season. \u201cIt is what it is, so let\u2019s get it going,\u201d he said Friday following the team\u2019s shootaround in Atlanta. \u201cThe front office made changes that they felt best fit this franchise. It\u2019s time to go to work.\u201d In the hours before Thursday\u2019s trading deadline, the Cavs unloaded six players, including Isaiah Thomas and Dwyane Wade, James\u2019 best friend, in three separate deals designed to make the team younger, more athletic and as general manager Koby Altman put it, to revitalize a team he felt was \u201cmarching a slow death.\u201d * Blogtable:  After roster remodel, are Cavs team to beat? Cleveland added guards George Hill and Jordan Clarkson as well as forwards Larry Nance Jr. and Rodney Hood , and all will have to take a crash course in Cavaliers 101. The team sent some of medical staff to Atlanta in hopes of completing physicals before Friday\u2019s game ( 7:30 ET, NBA League Pass ), but it\u2019s unlikely any of the new additions will play until Sunday in Boston. On paper, the Cavs look better. James is cautious. \u201cWe have to see how it meshes, obviously,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I like the pieces that we have coming in.\u201d The makeover was also aimed at placating James, who can become a free agent and leave Cleveland this summer. Teams already are lining up for an audience with The King should he turn down $36.5 million and opt out of his contract. So the Cavs turned their roster upside down in hopes of convincing James he doesn\u2019t have to go anywhere. \u201cHe\u2019s the guy that is going to take us back to the promised land,\u201d Altman said, \u201cso you want to put the right pieces around him.\u201d The Cavaliers have been in a freefall, losing 13 of 20 games since Christmas Day and getting blown out on national TV several times. More troubling to Altman was the sense that the Cavs were miserable, disconnected and on a self-destructive path. So the 35-year-old GM\u2019s first move in the overhaul was bold, requiring him to swallow his pride and scuttle the blockbuster trade that brought Thomas and Jae Crowder to Cleveland last July in the deal for Kyrie Irving. Crowder was also traded Thursday to Utah. A former All-Star, Thomas struggled while recovering from a serious right hip injury, and there were no signs he was going to improve enough to make a difference this season. He and James were a forced fit, and it became obvious to the Cavs they had to pull the plug on the experiment. And it wasn\u2019t just Thomas\u2019 poor shooting and defensive holes, he irked teammates and coaches with public comments. He was also in the middle of a heated team meeting when he questioned why Kevin Love left a game early and missed a practice. Cleveland could afford to go on with him, so they sent Thomas, Channing Frye and one of its 2018 first-round picks to the Los Angeles Lakers. James took the high road when asked about his time with Thomas. \u201cThe small little doses that I was able to play with Jae and IT, I wish it could have been better than it was,\u201d James said. \u201cI want Isaiah to get his bounce back, get his spring back, get healthy. Being out seven months is difficult for anybody. I just feel like he was playing behind the eight ball, not only on the floor, but just trying to get himself back to where he\u2019s accustomed to playing. I wish the best for him in LA right now and his future.\u201d Altman\u2019s renovation also included trading Wade back to Miami, where he\u2019ll finish his career with the franchise that drafted him and the one he put on the map by winning three titles \u2013 two alongside James, who was thrilled for him. \u201cHe gets to go back home and that\u2019s how it should be,\u201d James said. \u201cI\u2019ve always felt like that\u2019s where his heart and his mind was and I think it\u2019s going to be great for him.\u201d While Altman\u2019s main objective was to repair Cleveland\u2019s culture, he also wanted to spark James, who hasn\u2019t been himself in recent weeks. However, with the deadline hours away, James put together a 37-point, 15-assist, 10-rebound game on Wednesday that he capped with a buzzer-beating shot in overtime to edge Minnesota. \u201cThis guy is so good he dictates outcomes,\u201d Altman said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to compete every night and try to get whatever team he\u2019s on to the Finals, but I wanted to see a renewed sense of joy in him and being around him the last 24 hours has been great.\u201d Just last week James expressed doubts about the Cavs\u2019 commitment to fixing their roster. He watched other All-Stars get traded since the end of last season and wondered if Cleveland was going to make changes. He doesn\u2019t have any doubts now. The Cavs made their moves. James gets the next one."},{"id":41823,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/numbers-notebook-deadline-day","date":"2018-02-09","title":"Numbers notebook: Cleveland Cavaliers upgrade at the trade deadline","content":"The NBA had quite a deadline day, with a major overhaul in Cleveland being the highlight. Lets dig in with some numbers regarding the players and teams that were involved in deals made over the last two weeks \u2026 Trade 1: The Cavs traded Channing Frye, Isaiah Thomas and their own 2018 first-round pick to the Lakers for Jordan Clarkson and Larry Nance Jr. Trade 2: The Cavs acquired George Hill and Rodney Hood in a three-team trade, sending out Jae Crowder, Derrick Rose, Iman Shumpert, and a second round pick. Trade 3: The Cavs traded Dwyane Wade to Miami for a second round pick. The Cavs upgraded their talent and managed to keep the Brooklyn Nets\u2019 first round pick in this year\u2019s Draft. They did so by taking future salary off the Lakers\u2019 and Kings\u2019 books. Even if you disregard Hood\u2019s qualifying offer this summer and assume that they will waive Hill in 2019 (paying him just his $1 million guarantee for 2019-20, rather than his full $18 million salary), the Cavs took on an additional $15.5 million in salary next season and an additional $6.6 million in salary for the 2019-20 season. How those commitments are judged, of course, will depend on whether or not LeBron James re-signs with Cleveland this summer. James\u2019 status, of course, could be affected by how well the Cavs play over the next four months. And the players they acquired should certainly help them play better than they have over the last four. More size in the backcourt The Cavs have been most desperate for help on defense. They currently rank 29th in defensive efficiency , with multiple problems. Only two teams have allowed more points per game in the restricted area , only three teams have allowed their opponents to take a greater percentage of their shots from 3-point range, and only four teams have forced fewer turnovers per 100 possessions . In the 40 seasons since the league started counting turnovers, only one team (last season\u2019s Cavs) has reached The Finals after ranking in the bottom 10 in defensive efficiency in the regular season. The lowest ranked defensive team to win a championship was the 2000-01 Lakers, who ranked 19th. The Cavs probably aren\u2019t going to climb out of the top 10 between now and April 11. But they have to get better if they want to get back to The Finals. And a couple of their new additions can help. Hill (6-3) is six inches taller than Thomas (5-9) and Hood (6-8) is two inches taller than Crowder (6-6). The Boston Celtics\u2019 defensive improvement this season will tell you that size matters. The Celtics lost two guys \u2013 Crowder and Avery Bradley \u2013 with defensive reputations, but got bigger at all three perimeter positions, swapping Thomas, Bradley (6-2) and Crowder for Kyrie Irving (6-3), Jaylen Brown (6-7) and Jayson Tatum (6-8). The result has been the best defense in the league , one that has allowed 5.5 fewer points per 100 possessions than the Celtics did last season . The Cavs\u2019 added size in the backcourt should help in regard to forcing turnovers, running opponents off the 3-point line, and rebounding. Hill comes from another bottom-three defensive team , and the Kings were 5.6 points per 100 possessions worse defensively with Hill on the floor than they were with him on the floor, when they allowed 112.9 per 100. That is the fifth highest on-court DefRtg among 284 players who have averaged at least 15 minutes in 25 or more games . Two of the players with higher marks are new teammate J.R. Smith and former Cav Jae Crowder. But it\u2019s reasonable to disregard Hill\u2019s Sacramento tenure given how bad of a fit Hill was on, statistically, the worst team in the league. The Kings have a chance to become the first team to rank last in both offensive and defensive efficiency in a 30-team league in a full, 82-game season. Prior to this season, every team that Hill has played on (nine seasons in San Antonio, Indiana and Utah) has ranked in the top 11 in defensive efficiency. He was on two Pacers teams ( 2012-13 and \u201913-14 ) that ranked No. 1 on defense. Last season, the Jazz allowed just 100.2 points per 100 possessions in 684 minutes with Hill and Hood on the floor together . It helped that Rudy Gobert was on the floor for 587 (86 percent) of those minutes and the Hill-Hood combo was not adept at forcing turnovers ( the Jazz forced only 12.3 per 100 possessions with them on the floor ). But with Hill and Hood on the floor, Utah opponents took only 26 percent of their shots from 3-point range . That would have been the lowest opponent 3PA\/FGA rate in the league last season. Defense from \u2026 the Lakers? Both Nance and Clarkson come from a decent defensive team. After ranking last in defensive efficiency each of the last two seasons, the Lakers ranked 11th prior to Thursday\u2019s trades and allowed just 100.4 points per 100 possessions in 475 minutes with Clarkson an Nance on the floor together . That\u2019s not a ton of minutes and the pair generally played against the opponent\u2019s reserves, but that mark is lower than that of any Cleveland combo that has played at least 300 minutes . Nance does not rank well as a rim protector. Opponents have shot 68 percent at the rim when he\u2019s been there to protect it, the 10th highest mark among 88 players who have defended at last three shots at the rim per game . But he ranks in the top 50 in deflections per game and the Lakers forced 16.8 turnovers per 100 possessions (a rate which would lead the league ) with him on the floor. Shooting If you\u2019re going to play alongside James, it helps if you can shoot off the catch. And, cumulatively, the players that the Cavs acquired on Thursday have shot better off the catch over the last three seasons than the players they traded away. The six players the Cavs traded were particularly bad on catch-and-shoot threes this season, making just 114 (31 percent) of their 364 attempts . Obviously, Nance isn\u2019t a shooter, but in regard to both his size on defense and his ability to knock down threes off the catch, Hill looks like the most valuable addition of the new guys. The Frye Factor But the loss of Frye shouldn\u2019t be overlooked. Though he didn\u2019t play much in The Finals the last two seasons (Tyronn Lue didn\u2019t like the matchup against Golden State), Frye was a problem for some of Cleveland\u2019s Eastern Conference opponents. And in the four seasons since James returned to Cleveland, the Cavs\u2019 offense has been at its best, scoring 118 points per 100 possessions, with Frye and James on the floor together. Frye\u2019s Combo of size & shooting (with a quick release) made him a matchup problem with a passer like James. The Toronto Raptors, against whom Frye shot 23-for-38 (61 percent) from 3-point range over the last two postseasons , are probably glad he\u2019s no longer in Cleveland. The trade:  The Magic traded Elfrid Payton to Phoenix for a second round pick . With just 28 games left on his rookie contract, the Orlando Magic finally gave up on Payton, whom they took with the 10th pick in the 2014 Draft . Payton has shot a career-best 52 percent from the field this season , but that number needs some context. Payton has taken only 26 percent of his shots from outside the paint. That is the second lowest rate (higher than that of only Ben Simmons) among 125 guards who have taken at least 200 shots from the field. Payton has improved his ability to finish at the rim in his four seasons. After shooting just 49 percent in the restricted area as a rookie , he shot 58 percent there over his second and third seasons and 67 percent in the restricted area this season. But as a guard who doesn\u2019t shoot much from the outside (maybe because his hair is in his field of vision), Payton isn\u2019t a huge threat offensively. And on the other end of the floor, Payton has been a liability. The Magic allowed 113.6 points per 100 possessions with him on the floor. That is the highest on-court DefRtg among 284 players who have averaged at least 15 minutes in 25 or more games and 9.4 points per 100 possessions more than the Magic allowed with Payton on the bench . The Magic have allowed 49.6 points in the paint per game , more than any team in the last 20 years. And they allowed 52.5 per 48 minutes with Payton on the floor . The trade: In a three-team deal , the Nuggets acquired Devin Harris and a second round pick, the Knicks acquired Emmanuel Mudiay, and the Mavs acquired Doug McDermott and a second round pick. The Nuggets are currently in seventh in the East , but tied in the loss column with the ninth-place Clippers. And they were desperate for a back-up point guard, because Mudiay\u2019s minutes have generally been a disaster. The Nuggets were 12.7 points per 100 possessions worse with Mudiay on the floor (minus-8.6) than they were with him off the floor (plus-4.1). He did have some better minutes ( plus-3.1 per 100 ) since returning to the rotation a few weeks ago and he has shot better from the outside this season (effective field goal percentage of 48 percent from outside the paint) than he did in his first two seasons (40 percent). But Mudiay has remained one of the league\u2019s worst finishers in the rim ( only three players have shot worse on at least 100 shots in the restricted area ) and his overall effective field goal percentage of 46.0 percent is still well below the league average (52.1 percent). Harris has generally given the Mavs a good lift off the bench this season. In fact, the Mavs were 13.5 points per 100 possessions better with Harris on the floor than they were with him off the floor . The Nuggets swapped the guy with the sixth worst on-off NetRtg differential (Mudiay) among 304 players who have played at least 500 minutes this season for the guy with eighth best on-off NetRtg differential (Harris) among that same group. Harris\u2019 differential is as much about the Dallas starters, who have been consistently overmatched against the starting groups of their opponents, than it is about Harris. But the Mavs stayed in games ( only two teams have had more games within five points in the last five minutes ), because the Mavs had one of the best bench units in the league. In fact, the Mavs\u2019 lineup of Harris, J.J. Barea, Yogi Ferrell, Dirk Nowitzki and Dwight Powell outscored its opponents by 19.4 points per 100 possessions, the third best mark among 30 lineups that have played at least 200 minutes together . Long live the super-fun, Dirk-plus-bench unit. Trade 1:  The Heat acquired Dwyane Wade from Cleveland for a second round pick . Trade 2:  The Heat acquired Luke Babbitt from Atlanta for Okaro White . The Heat, dealing with a slew of injuries, needed depth and offense. And they added both by bringing back two guys they\u2019ve had before. Wade isn\u2019t the most efficient scorer in the league. His effective field goal percentage and true shooting percentage are well below the league average. He has taken just 50 percent of his shots from the restricted area (where he\u2019s still a good finisher) or 3-point range (where he\u2019s still pretty bad). He has attempted twice as many mid-range shots as 3-pointers. But he does give the league\u2019s 24th-ranked offense another ball-handler. Babbitt gives them another shooter. He has shot 44 percent from 3-point range over the last four seasons, the third best mark among players who have attempted at least 500 threes in that time. The Hawks are at the bottom of the Eastern Conference standings, but for a short time, they had a decent starting lineup (plus-3.1 points per 100 possessions) with Babbitt and Dewayne Dedmon on the frontline . The trade:  The Knicks traded Willy Hernangomez to the Hornets for Johnny O\u2019Bryant and two second round picks . Hernangomez barely played for the Knicks this season before getting traded on Wednesday, so we\u2019ll recycle a couple of notes from last season , when Hernangomez was a First Team All-Rookie selection\u2026 Charlotte leads the league in defensive rebounding percentage and ranks ninth in second chance points per game , so Hernangomez doesn\u2019t necessarily fit a need. And the Hornets just got Cody Zeller back from a two-month absence, so it\u2019s not clear that there\u2019s any immediate playing time available for the new acquisition. But Hernangomez is on a cheap contract for two more seasons beyond this one and with some work, Steve Clifford may be able to turn him into a not-so-terrible defender. The trade:  The Bucks acquired Tyler Zeller From Brooklyn for Rashad Vaughn and a second round pick . A couple of small notes on this move\u2026 The Grizzlies clearly couldn\u2019t get a first round pick for Tyreke Evans, who they shut down last week in anticipation of a trade. Rather than taking the best offer (likely two second rounders), they decided to hold onto Evans, who they might be able to re-sign in the summer. We\u2019ll have to wait until July to see if Evans shows some loyalty to the team that helped him resurrect his career. The question for now is whether Evans goes back to playing 30 minutes a game for the Grizz, who are one of eight teams at the bottom of the combined standings with 17-19 wins . Lottery odds for seven of those eight teams (and the Cavs, who own the Nets\u2019 pick) will change with their results over the last two months of the season. The Grizzlies have the most road-heavy schedule of those eight teams, but have also been 10 points per 100 possessions better with Evans on the floor than they\u2019ve been with him on the bench . It\u2019s really been a remarkable comeback for Evans, who was an inconsequential element of the DeMarcus Cousins trade a year ago. While registering a career-high usage rate of 28.3 percent this season , he has career-high marks in assist-turnover ratio, effective field goal percentage and true shooting percentage. And he has shot 40.4 percent on pull-up 3-pointers, the second best mark among 17 players who have attempted at least three pull-up threes in 25 games or more . His status for the rest of the season will affect the Grizzlies win total. The Pistons are 4-0 with Blake Griffin , who was acquired in the blockbuster deal that took place 10 days before the deadline, and they\u2019ve allowed less than a point per possession over the four games . Some context\u2026 First, the Pistons have had a rest advantage, with their opponent playing the second game of a back-to-back, in all four games. Second, all four opponents have been below-average offensive teams and three of the four rank in the bottom seven offensively. They have two pre-break games against the 22nd-ranked Hawks (the second of which is another rest-advantage game), but will host the 11th-ranked Clippers on Friday and the seventh-ranked Pelicans on Monday. Overall, the Pistons have one of the league\u2019s easiest remaining schedules. Even with the schedule advantages, it\u2019s worth noting that the Pistons have outscored their opponents by more than 24 points per 100 possessions in 84 minutes with Griffin and Andre Drummond on the floor together . Over the four games, Griffin has assisted Drummond on nine of the 21 baskets that the center has scored with Griffin on the floor. Griffin has also been complemented well by third big Anthony Tolliver , though Griffin himself has shot just 39 percent with Drummond off the floor ."},{"id":47452,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/philadelphia-76ers-gm-bryan-colangelo-markelle-fultz-may-not-play-year","date":"2018-02-09","title":"Philadelphia 76ers' Bryan Colangelo unsure if Markelle Fultz will return this season","content":" Things were looking up for the No. 1 overall pick of the 2017 Draft just a month or so ago. That was when the Philadelphia 76ers\u2019 Markelle Fultz had entered the final phase of his injury rehabilitation work and seemed on track to return to the team\u2019s lineup. However, based on comments from Sixers GM Bryan Colangelo today, Fultz may not play again this season. In a discussion with reporters today, Colangelo said there is currently no timeline for Fultz\u2019s return and added the guard could be back in days or could miss the rest of the season. \u201cThere\u2019s always a chance that he\u2019s going to be out there soon, and there\u2019s a chance that he\u2019s not going to play this year,\u201d Colangelo said. \u201cI can\u2019t answer that question because we don\u2019t know the answer to that.\u201d Per Derek Bodner of The Athletic, the Sixers still don\u2019t know if Fultz\u2019s changed shooting mechanic caused the injury or if his injury caused him to change his shot mechanics. As well, the Sixers have had to complete rebuild the muscle memory in Fultz\u2019s shooting mechanics. \u201cWe hope to see [Fultz] this year. If not, we will wait until he\u2019s ready to participate, and help, and put him in a position to succeed. That\u2019s going to be a determination that\u2019s made at some point in the future,\u201d Colangelo said. \u201cHe\u2019s doing some things on the basketball court, in the limited basketball activity that he\u2019s taking place in, that he\u2019s participating in, and he\u2019s dazzling in many ways. But when he\u2019s ready to help his team and be ready, I can\u2019t give you a timeline.\u201d Four games into the 2017-18 season, the team shut down Fultz to deal with issues in his right shoulder. He was ruled out indefinitely on Oct. 29 with soreness and scapular muscle imbalance in his right shoulder. There is no structural impairment to the shoulder and as of early December, Fultz no longer had soreness in the shoulder . Fultz has had problems with his shoulder all season that have greatly affected his free-throw mechanics and his form was widely mocked as his shots clanked off the backboard. Fultz struggled to begin the season, averaging 6.0 points, 2.3 rebounds and 1.8 assists in 18.9 minutes . He shot just 33 percent overall (9-for-27), 50 percent on free throws (6-for-12) and has not attempted a 3-pointer."},{"id":47446,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-potential-buyout-candidates-who-could-help-contender","date":"2018-02-09","title":"Blogtable: Which potential buyout candidates could help a title-contender?","content":" * * * The buyout market is next. Name a player or two we could see floating out there who could make a difference for a title contender?  * * * Steve Aschburner : Tyreke Evans should have gotten traded \u2013 that\u2019s why the Memphis Grizzlies warehoused him for a week, right? \u2013 and now looms as the No. 1 player not just in line for a buyout but deserving of one. Evans was having a strong season and, given Memphis\u2019 downward arc, should be given a chance via negotiated freedom to take his game to a legit contender. At a lower level, Shabazz Muhammad wants out of Minnesota and the Timberwolves ought to accommodate him, while keeping options open for buyout additions of their own. Muhammad has enough offensive skills to generate some post-buyout interest among other playoff teams. Tas Melas:  Joe Johnson. This is his time to shine. The new Raptors offense tends to revert back to the old Raptors offense in crunch time and they need another guy who can create on his own. It\u2019s Joe-John time in Toronto. And, that would prevent him from killing the Raptors as he tends to do in the postseason.  Shaun Powell :  To be honest, nobody will be a difference-maker in the truest definition of the word ; if they could still make a difference, their team never would\u2019ve given up on them. The batch of players up for grabs will either be old or dealing with declining skills or both. That said,  Joe Johnson has a history of taking big shots . That\u2019s not saying he will, at this stage of his career, still make them. But he won\u2019t back down from the moment. Championship teams want and need gutsy players like that. John Schuhmann :  Every team needs shooting and Marco Belinelli is a shooter who has contributed to a championship team (2014 Spurs) in the past. He\u2019s not having his best shooting season ( his catch-and-shoot 3-point percentage of 37.8 percent is just a tick above the league average), but he\u2019s somebody that defenses have to account for when he\u2019s on the move.  Sekou Smith :  Joe Johnson is still grinding along as one of the league\u2019s most reliable scorers and certainly strikes me as a prime candidate for a buyout. He\u2019d draw plenty of attention from contenders on both side of the conference divide and rightfully so. Cleveland has a roster spot and a connection (Johnson and Cavs coach Tyronn Lue once shared a backcourt and a leadership duties in Atlanta) that could lead him to northeast Ohio.The value a veteran practitioner of his ilk brings come playoff time cannot be overstated. The same goes for Tony Allen , who brings the defensive prowess comparable to Johnson\u2019s offensive skills and would be a plug and play, elite-level perimeter defender, provided he\u2019s physically capable of rekindling his \u201cGrindfather\u201d routine somewhere other than Memphis."},{"id":47676,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-are-cleveland-cavaliers-team-beat-after-roster-remodel","date":"2018-02-09","title":"Blogtable: After roster remodel, are Cleveland Cavaliers still team to beat in East?","content":" * * * It seems like we ask this question every 15-20 games, but here goes: Are the Cavs, as constructed right now,the team to beat in the East?  * * * Steve Aschburner : The Cavs are still the team to beat because they have LeBron James reinvigorated and a little bit out on Responsibility Island. The moves GM Koby Altman made were done with James\u2019 blessing, from all reports, so he owns the results too for at least the next four months or so. Having witnessed how he \u201ccoached up\u201d the likes of Matthew Dellavedova and Tristan Thompson through the 2015 postseason to a six-game Finals against Golden State, I\u2019m confident he can work similar magic with George Hill, Rodney Hood, Jordan Clarkson and Larry Nance, Jr. over 29 games and a couple of training-wheel playoff series. By the conference finals, whether it\u2019s Boston or Toronto, we\u2019ll see a more vibrant Cavs team than the one James and Altman just put asunder. Tas Melas:  They are. Their weaknesses after the trades: Playoff experience, a lack of rim protection, and a thin frontcourt (especially with Kevin Love\u2019s injury), but it\u2019s nothing a rejuvenated LeBron with more youthful legs around him can\u2019t overcome. The fast break with Larry Nance Jr. and Jordan Clarkson will be something to watch. George Hill has played in 83 playoff games and will make big shots. Rodney Hood should score a lot off the bench. The worry is if they continue to fall in the standings, they could have three tough series, which could all be on the road, versus the likes of the Washington Wizards\/Milwaukee Bucks, Boston Celtics and an improved Toronto Raptors team. And, what will Love look in these difficult series, returning to the court from that hand injury in late March or early April?   Shaun Powell :  Yes, because they\u2019ve still got LeBron and the Boston Celtics and Toronto Raptors don\u2019t. Even though the next 15-20 games will have a training camp feel in Cleveland, with all the new faces and maybe a different style of play needed to accommodate their talents, someone in the East must beat LeBron four times in seven games this spring. You buying that? It all comes back to him. John Schuhmann : I could change my mind come April 14, but right now, I see the East as wide open, with no \u201cteam to beat.\u201d The Celtics are better than they were last season, are still holding onto the No. 1 seed , and have had the league\u2019s best defense . The Raptors are better than they were last season, are right on the Celtics\u2019 heels, and are the only team in the league that ranks in the top five in both offensive and defensive efficiency. But Boston has struggled offensively at times and Toronto\u2019s depth won\u2019t be as big of an advantage in the playoffs with shorter rotations. The Cavs have LeBron James, but still have a lot of work to do to rise to the level of the two teams ahead of them in the East standings , especially on defense. The East playoffs should be a lot more fun than they have been the last few years and I\u2019m not booking any hotels for the conference finals just yet.  Sekou Smith :  Give me at least five games with this renovated Cavaliers roster and then I\u2019ll make my assessment of their chances of regaining their favorites status in the Eastern Conference. Because based on what we saw from the Cavaliers from Christmas up until the trade deadline, they were in danger of not making the conference finals. They had fallen so hard and so far in such short order, I\u2019d already removed them from my top spot in the East in favor of Boston and Toronto. And yes, I know LeBron is still there and the most important factor for a team trying to claim the conference crown. But I wasn\u2019t sure he was even capable of rescuing the previous version of the Cavaliers. This new crew has to come together quickly and show me that they are indeed back to being the version of the Cavaliers who won 18 of 19 games earlier this season. When I see signs of that group again, I\u2019ll be glad to push them back up in the pecking order. But not a moment sooner. * * *"},{"id":47475,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-impact-cleveland-cavaliers-los-angeles-lakers-trade-lebron-future","date":"2018-02-09","title":"Blogtable: Impact of Cleveland Cavaliers-Los Angeles Lakers trade on LeBron James' future?","content":" * * * It\u2019s an interesting argument either way. But in your opinion, did the Cavs-Lakers trade make it more likely that LeBron James stays in Cleveland, or did it actually help the Lakers clear a path to sign James themselves this summer or next?  * * * Steve Aschburner : To me, the Lakers were going to do whatever it took to position themselves to woo LeBron James when he\u2019s available whether Cleveland helped in that endeavor or not. No real change, then, from the West Coast. But big change in northeast Ohio, where taking the ax to a moribund Cavs roster was essential to stay in James\u2019 good graces. Maybe Cleveland won\u2019t win another title or even reach the Finals with its new supporting players, but it surely was going nowhere with the previous group. That\u2019s why I said on NBA TV that Thursday was less Trade Deadline Day than early Valentine\u2019s Day, with the Cavaliers courting LeBron with flowers, chocolates and a Hallmark card. He and his new crew, though, will have to take care of the jewelry. Tas Melas:  I give the edge to Cleveland. This day will be known as the trade deadline when the Cavs opened the door for the Lakers to sign LeBron, but they already had room to sign him this summer and would have made the requisite moves (trade Jordan Clarkson, stretch Luol Deng, etc.) around the draft if both Paul George and Bron had tickets to LAX. In truth, this day was about the perpetual power LeBron James holds over the Cavs\u2019 front office. He signs 1-year deals for this very effect and 35-year-old GM Koby Altman handled it marvelously. LeBron now has the youthful exuberance around him that he could get by signing in LA without having to move his family and life across the country. Shaun Powell :  Maybe the correct answer is: Both and Neither. Let\u2019s explain : The Lakers cleared up enough room to sign two A-list free agents or perhaps three if they make some additional financial decisions next summer. This allows them to blend young players (Kyle Kuzma, Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram) with ready-to-win veterans. But the Cavs drained the swamp of players who were bad fits\/bad contracts without sacrificing quality and also kept the 2018 Brooklyn pick, which helps them both now and in the future. Bottom line is LeBron will pick whomever he wants, and the team that gives him the best chance of winning. Which means he\u2019s going to the Houston Rockets. John Schuhmann : I believe those who say that James wasn\u2019t (and isn\u2019t) going to make a decision about his future until the season was over. But it was clear, by the lack of effort he displayed on defense, that he was not fully engaged with the Cavs as they were constituted prior to Thursday. The changes made can only help the on-court performance and the chemistry and, therefore, help the team\u2019s chances of retaining its star. The Lakers did give themselves the chance to sign two max free agents this summer. But a Lakers team with James, another max player, and their collection of young guys probably isn\u2019t as ready to compete for a championship as next season\u2019s Cavs would be should he stay in Cleveland.  Sekou Smith :  I don\u2019t believe the happenings at the trade deadline did anything to sway LeBron one way or the other. To suggest something like gutting a team at the trade deadline would do anything interrupt or even impact the calculation of LeBron\u2019s master plan ignores his NBA history. He doesn\u2019t make his decisions on the whims of others or by taking the temperature of things at the moment. I\u2019ve felt all along that it will be tough for the Cavaliers to keep him in the fold, especially if he\u2019s decided that he doesn\u2019t want to continue grinding away in a situation that he cannot control (to the extent that he\u2019s comfortable with how things run from top to bottom). At this stage of his career, I don\u2019t know what the strongest motivators are for LeBron. The title-chaser who went to Miami isn\u2019t the same guy who will make his choice in July. Trying to predict what happens for this summer\u2019s version of The Decision is for those who are gluttons for punishment. And yes, my gut tells me he\u2019s gone \u2026 but I have no clue where he might end up. * * *"},{"id":47738,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/mvp-ladder-week-17-houston-rockets-james-harden-clears-path-trophy","date":"2018-02-09","title":"Kia MVP Ladder: Roster revamp could revitalize LeBron James' run for MVP hardware","content":" Koby Altman\u2019s charge was simple. Make that change that stopped the Cleveland Cavaliers\u2019 post-Christmas slide. Make them whole again. Make them fun. Energize a group that had clearly run out of energy, and in his own words, \u201cwas marching a slow death,\u201d he wanted no part of. And do it by the 3 p.m. ET trade deadline Thursday . Altman, the Cavaliers\u2019 first-year general manager, did all of that and more, when he flipped the Cavaliers roster with three trades that could save the season in northeast Ohio. Isaiah Thomas, Iman Shumpert, Derrick Rose, Dwyane Wade, Jae Crowder and Channing Frye are all gone , purged from the roster in order to add some youth and energy in the form of youngsters Jordan Clarkson, Larry Nance Jr., Rodney Hood and veteran point guard George Hill. The most important trade deadline acquisition, however, might very well be the \u201crejuvenated\u201d LeBron James Altman and the Cavaliers expect to emerge from the franchise\u2019s trade deadline flurry. One of the leading candidates on the Kia Race to the MVP Ladder through Christmas, when the 24-10 Cavaliers lost in their Finals rematch against the Golden State Warriors in Oakland, the four-time Kia MVP\u2019s spirits and performance sagged as the Cavaliers tumbled through a 7-13 stretch before Thursday\u2019s roster reckoning. Forget the looming free agency quandary the Cavaliers are facing with the face of the franchise; July will be here before you know it anyway. The Cavaliers clearly had more immediate issues to address if they were serious about making a fourth straight run to The Finals. Altman couldn\u2019t take it anymore . He knew he had to do something to change the fractured culture that had developed around his superstar, something to light LeBron\u2019s fire for the stretch run of this season. \u201cThis guy is so good he dictates outcomes,\u201d Altman said in a media conference call Thursday night. \u201cThat was the hardest part for me was seeing him \u2026 I wanted to see a renewed sense of joy in him. Being around him the last 24 hours has been great. I think he\u2019s excited and I can see a renewed sense of excitement and joy in him when he\u2019s in the building and we will see that translate to some fun basketball because he\u2019s the key, he\u2019s the guy that is going to take us back to the promised land. So you want to put the right pieces around him.\u201d Time will tell if that mission has been accomplished. In the meantime, we\u2019ll see if Altman\u2019s deadline dealing turns up the heat on the other players at and around the top of the Kia Race to the MVP Ladder. * * * The top five in the Week 17 edition of the 2017-18 Kia Race to the MVP Ladder: * * * Last week\u2019s ranking:  No. 1 Season stats:  31.5 points, 9.0 assists, 4.9 rebounds While many of his contemporaries around the league and on this list were sweating out the details of Thursday\u2019s trade deadline, Harden is busy going about the business of trying to bag his first Kia MVP. The Rockets have won six straight games heading into tonight\u2019s game against Denver at Toyota Center ( 8 ET, NBA League Pass ), a streak in which the Rockets are averaging 113.5 points on nearly 50 percent shooting). The last time we saw him in uniform Harden was dropping 41 points (which included a 5-for-12 effort on 3-pointers) on the Miami Heat , his eighth 40-point game of the season. With Harden, Chris Paul and Clint Capela in the lineup the Rockets are a staggering 24-1 and have shown themselves to be as good as any team in the league \u2014 the Golden State Warriors included. But it all starts with Harden, whose focus and determination has not wavered this season. Last week\u2019s ranking:  No. 4 Season stats:  26.0 points, 6.8 rebounds, 5.5 assists Durant has strung together 30-point performances in three of his past four games, showing off the scoring touch you\u2019d expect from a four-time NBA scoring champion in the prime of his career. Sure, the Warriors went 2-2 in those games, losing to both Denver and Durant\u2019s old team, the Oklahoma City Thunder . But his ability to take his game to the next level at a moment\u2019s notice has been undeniable, even on a roster that includes former two-time Kia MVP Stephen Curry as well as All-Stars Klay Thompson and Draymond Green. The Rockets are giving good chase for that No. 1 spot in the West, which should be all the motivation Durant and the Warriors need to stay focused until season\u2019s end. Last week\u2019s ranking:  No. 3 Season stats:  26.5 points, 8.7 assists, 8.0 rebounds For all of the struggles the Cavaliers have endured since Christmas, it\u2019s worth noting that LeBron still kept them among the top three teams in the Eastern Conference. Cleveland was able to hold on until the trade deadline, where the front office could go to work on the issues LeBron\u2019s presence alone couldn\u2019t fix. Still, his 37-point, 15-assist, 10-rebound triple-double and game-winner in overtime to knock off the Minnesota Timberwolves was the glimmer of hope Cavaliers fans needed to believe things had a chance to turn around during the upcoming All-Star break. Fresh legs, news faces and a renewed energy should sustain the Cavaliers until the new faces can be integrated into the system. LeBron has always been inspired by challenges and this is the latest and perhaps greatest since his first season back in Cleveland. Back in that 2014-15 season, he dragged an inexperienced bunch to The Finals with an injury-ravaged supporting cast. Last week\u2019s ranking:  No. 2 Season stats:  27.2 points, 6.4 assists, 5.1 rebounds It\u2019s not often a former two-time Kia MVP gets picked on the way Curry did in back-to-back losses to the Denver Nuggets and Oklahoma City Thunder earlier this week. But there he was in both games, wearing the bullseye on the defensive end as the Nuggets and Thunder targeted him time after time. Curry usually combats his defensive liabilities by exploiting the mismatches he enjoys offensively (few humans can match his shooting range and the he\u2019s usually not ever turning the ball over). The Warriors need Curry to find his groove again, what with the Rockets in full pursuit of that top spot in the West playoff chase. The Warriors don\u2019t have the luxury of playing as carelessly as they have lately, and that means Curry has to set a better tone with his ball security and attentiveness on the defensive end. Last week\u2019s ranking:  No. 7 Last week\u2019s ranking:  25.5 points, 10.3 assists, 9.3 rebounds Westbrook sat out Thursday\u2019s game against the Los Angeles Lakers with a sore ankle, an injury suffered during his monstrous performance in Tuesday\u2019s 20-point thumping of the Golden State Warriors . That performance (34 points, nine rebounds and nine assists) serves as another reminder of how quickly Westbrook can overwhelm foes \u2014 even the Warriors \u2014 when he\u2019s hell bent on doing so. He made nine of his first 10 shots, scored 21 of his points in the first quarter as the Thunder opened up a 12-point lead after the first quarter and never trailed. Any time Westbrook sees old friend and former teammate Durant and the Warriors, he shows up with a few extra doses of rage. With Paul George, playing like the frontrunner for this season\u2019s Kia Defensive Player of the Year award (six steals to go along with his game-high 38 points), rolling with him, the Thunder looked every bit the potential spoiler in the West playoff field. Depending on the matchups they get, Westbrook and George could lead the Thunder\u2019s upset bid throughout the 2018 playoffs. 6. Kyrie Irving, Boston Celtics 7. DeMar DeRozan, Toronto Raptors 8. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks 9. Jimmy Butler, Minnesota Timberwolves 10. LaMarcus Aldridge, San Antonio Spurs And five more \u2026: Bradley Beal, Washington Wizards; Anthony Davis, New Orleans Pelicans; Joel Embiid, Philadelphia 76ers; Nikola Jokic, Denver Nuggets; Damian Lillard, Portland Trail Blazers An inside look at Rodney Hood from a Western Conference advance scout: \u201cThis is one of the more intriguing trade deadline additions I\u2019ve seen in recent years, considering the efforts of the Cavaliers to get younger and more athletic on the perimeter. Hood is sort of an enigma in that he\u2019s a 6-foot-8 shooting guard who can do a little bit of everything offensively but always seems to be holding something back. On those nights when he really let it loose, he goes off and just shreds your defense. But in terms of the consistency, it hasn\u2019t always been there. That\u2019s where playing alongside a guy like LeBron James can bring out the best in Hood\u2019s game.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s going to be working with the best player in the world, the best player of a generation and one of the best of all-time. There\u2019s so much Hood will learn watching with and working with LeBron. And he\u2019s going to be really good once he figures out how to pick and choose his spots playing alongside one of the best facilitators I\u2019ve ever seen. That sneaky athleticism and Hoods\u2019 shooting stroke are exactly what the Cavaliers need to help boost their overall group. He\u2019ll come in there and fit in easily. The best part, though, is that he\u2019s learned how to defend playing for Quin Snyder in Utah. His length and athleticism make a huge difference on defense. Sometimes you need a guy with his talent to come in and play a role and play it to perfection. I think he\u2019s capable of doing that at a very high level. I think Tyronn Lue is going to love him. His teammates are going to love what he brings. LeBron is going to love having a guy like that to work with and help him continue to grow his game and become an integral part of what they\u2019re trying to get done. The headline of [trade deadline day] was the Lakers guys, and Larry Nance Jr. and Jordan Clarkson are also great fits for what Cleveland is trying to do. That said, Hood might be the underrated move of the day.

Those stale, sputtering Cavs are no more. They are gone \u2014 six players out Thursday, four new players in \u2013 and done, replaced by a younger, quicker, more athletic cast who\u2019ll be force-fed their playoff experiences. * 2017-18 NBA Trade Tracker What with so many in and out doors banging to a frenzied beat, All-Star forward Kevin Love barely got a mention. But Love, out with a fracture to his left hand , will be coming back in a month to six weeks to a vastly reconfigured roster and lineup rotation. However long it takes this team to incorporate new guys George Hill, Rodney Hood, Jordan Clarkson and Larry Nance Jr., count on another period of adjustment for Love playing with them for the first time. Presumably \u2014 for Love\u2019s sake \u2014 it will go more smoothly than Isaiah Thomas\u2019 learning and comeback curve, which sort of triggered much of Thursday\u2019s maneuverings in the first place. Thomas was the fall guy of the day, the flip side of what most expect to be an enthused, rejuvenated and newly focused LeBron James. It already had been a tough nine months for the 5-foot-9 scoring guard, going from the most valuable player on a formidable contender ( Thomas finished fifth in Kia MVP balloting ) to the hip injury that ate deep into this season, the Kyrie Irving trade that landed him in Cleveland and the rust and skepticism that marred his 15 largely forgettable games there. The Cavs went 7-8 with Thomas, who shot 25 percent on 3-pointers and 36 percent overall. Their defense, leaky enough before, got worse (Thomas had a net rating of minus 15.1 points per 100 possessions ). Ball movement ground down to a series of dreary isolation plays or desperate 3s. Also, Thomas began to serve as one of the team\u2019s spokesman in the media, a role that suits his personality but one he had not earned in the Cavs\u2019 locker room. He spoke of things \u201cwe\u201d had to do better without quite yet being part of that \u201cwe.\u201d That included comments after the team\u2019s collapse in Orlando Tuesday about the Cavs failing to make adjustments during games, a criticism that went directly to coach Tyronn Lue and his staff. It was not appreciated. By the time Thomas followed up 24 hours later, after the last-second overtime victory over Minnesota at Quicken Loans Arena, with heartfelt comments about liking Cleveland and not wanting to be traded, he effectively already was gone. Altman reportedly talked with James before the game, running some possible trade scenarios by the team\u2019s star. \u201cWe were marching a slow death,\u201d Altman told reporters in a post-trades conference call Thursday evening, \u201cand we didn\u2019t want to be a part of that.\u201d Although it\u2019s undeniably part of the dynamic of trades \u2014 dwelling on the down sides of the departed vs. seeing the upsides of the newbies \u2013 it\u2019s fair to say that the players to whom the Cavs bid adieu (IT, Jae Crowder, Channing Frye, Iman Shumpert, Derrick Rose and Dwyane Wade) represented a lot of things that weren\u2019t working or weren\u2019t getting done. Energy was low, enthusiasm lower. The new arrivals, once they finally do arrive, bring not just their skills but \u2013 with three of the four, anyway \u2013 enough youth and hunger to jolt a Cavs locker room that lacked a bit of a pulse. Hill is the most like the veterans Cleveland shed Thursday, but he does bring playoff experience and a defensive mindset. Also, his combo-guard ways that could frustrate those in search of a classic playmaker should be an asset where James is initiating so much offense. * Cavs undergo major makeover via trades Hood, Clarkson and Nance get more than just changes of address and the newly dangled carrot of a deep playoff run. They \u2014 along with Cedi Osman, already in house and getting an opportunity \u2014 get James as a mentor, a role he has enjoyed (think 2015 playoffs and the wonders he worked with Matthew Dellavedova and Tristan Thompson, with Love and Irving out or hobbled). Make no mistake, James likes veterans but not in the mix, with the unreliable results, they had until Thursday. So the Cavaliers hit a reset button that they believe will help them for this season. These deals \u2014 and the ability to not trade away the Brooklyn first-round pick they hold thanks to the Irving trade \u2014 also leave Cleveland in better shape this summer, more attractive to James when he hits free agency and even more resilient if he leaves. For those tempted to conflate the Irving trade with the deals made Thursday and decree that Cleveland didn\u2019t get nearly enough, the economic concept of \u201csunk costs\u201d comes to mind. Irving was gone, Thomas wasn\u2019t working out, Crowder was not helping; that first deal was done. There was no going back. All Altman and the Cavs could do was go from there. There is a bigger issue that might not be answered over the remaining 29 games and however many follow in the postseason. The Cavaliers began this 2017-18 season as favorites to again win the conference title and reach the Finals. Even after the Irving trade, most NBA GMs and media mavens expected James and his vets to stomp through the East, whenever they chose to get serious about the season. Instead, we got an unprecedented makeover of a Finals favorite two-thirds of the way through a championship-minded season. In a league that preaches continuity and chemistry as ingredients of success, that\u2019s mind-boggling. James\u2019 inability to rouse this group out of its doldrums, on top of whatever Irving came to dislike even before this season began, raises questions about the superstar-down culture \u2014 as opposed to many teams\u2019 top-down, or San Antonio\u2019s Pop-down culture \u2014 wherever James has played. Or, for that matter, might play in the future. Bottom line on a busy trade day: Who gets to play for Team LeBron is a lot bigger deal than just on All-Star Sunday. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Tim Bontemps of The Washington Post reports via Twitter that the Thunder could make a serious run at any number of veteran free agents : \u2014 3:53 p.m. ET For now, Joe Johnson is reportedly headed to Sacramento as part of the Cleveland Cavaliers\u2019 George Hill\/Rodney Hood trade . He\u2019s not expected to be there for long and will likely be bought out by the Kings, reports TNT analyst David Aldridge.

Marcus Smart, Tyreke Evans, Derrick Favors, Marco Bellinelli and others seem to be staying where they are. Although all were in trade talks to varying degrees over the last few days, ultimately, they will ride out the rest of 2017-18 in their current locales. \u2014 3:02 p.m. ET In the midst of a rebuilding season, the Phoenix Suns are adding another young guard to their mix.

The Nuggets are sending Mudiay to the New York Knicks as part of a three-way according to media outlets. The trade also includes the Mavericks, who will get Doug McDermott from New York while the Nuggets will get veteran guard Devin Harris . The Knicks will also send the Nuggets a 2018 second-round pick while the Nuggets send a 2018 second round pick (via Portland) to Dallas. \u2014 2:09 p.m. ET The Toronto Raptors have pulled off a small trade, adding high-energy guard Malachi Richardson of the Sacramento Kings for reserve big man Bruno Caboclo. \u2014 1:30 p.m. ET The Dwyane Wade experiment with the Cleveland Cavaliers is apparently over. Per ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski, Wade is being shipped back to the Miami Heat, the team he spent the first 13 seasons of his career. The Cavs will receive a heavily protected 2024 second-round pick as part of the deal. Wade joined the Cavs in the offseason after being bought out by the Chicago Bulls in September. Wade was both a starter and a reserve at times for the Cavs and is averaging a career-low 11.2 points per game this season. \u2014 1:12 p.m. ET The Cleveland Cavaliers are adding to their backcourt remodel, it seems. According to reports, the Cleveland Cavaliers have landed Utah Jazz guard Rodney Hood and Sacramento Kings guard George Hill. In return, the Cavs will send Derrick Rose and Jae Crowder to Utah. The Cavs are also trading Iman Shumpert to the Kings as part of the trade and Utah is trading Joe Johnson to Sacramento, too. The reported trade marked another blockbuster for the Cavaliers, as they reportedly traded former All-Star guard Isaiah Thomas, veteran forward\/center Channing Frye and a 2018 first-round pick to the Los Angeles Lakers for Larry Nance Jr. and Jordan Clarkson . \u2014 1:02 p.m. ET The Detroit Pistons had been rumored earlier today to be looking to move newly acquired forward Brice Johnson. Although they did not end up picking up Dante Cunningham of the New Orleans Pelicans, they did add a solid contributor to their mix. The Pistons have acquired James Ennis from the Memphis Grizzlies for Johnson and a second-round pick. Ennis is averaging 6.9 points, 3.5 rebounds and 1.1 assists per game for Memphis and joins a Detroit small forward mix that includes Reggie Bullock and Stanley Johnson. \u2014 12:34 p.m. ET The Miami Heat have added some 3-point shooting to their mix after trading for Atlanta Hawks forward Luke Babbitt. Babbitt, who is shooting 44.1 percent from 3-point range this season, is returning to the Heat for forward Okaro White . \u2014 12:25 p.m. ET The Cleveland Cavaliers had sought to be buyers at the trade deadline and have accomplished that goal. In a surprising blockbuster deal, the Cavs have landed Larry Nance Jr. and Jordan Clarkson from the Los Angeles Lakers for Isaiah Thomas, Channing Frye and their own 2018 first-round pick. Nance is averaging 8.6 points, 6.8 rebounds, 1.4 assists and 1.4 steals per game this season, all of which are career highs. Clarkson is averaging 14.5 ppg, 3.0 apg and 3.3 apg in 53 games. Nance\u2019s father had his No. 22 retired by the Cavaliers in 1995. As for Thomas, he had expressed after the Cavs\u2019 win against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Wednesday that he did not desire to be traded by the team . Thomas is averaging 14.7 points, 4.5 assists and 2.1 rebounds in 27.1 minutes. \u2014 12:07 p.m. ET The Detroit Pistons are shoring up their backcourt after adding heft to their frontcourt a week ago. Detroit is trading center Willie Reed to the Chicago Bulls for veteran guard Jameer Nelson. Both teams agreed to swap second-round picks in the 2022 NBA Draft. The Bulls waived Reed as a subsequent move. He was suspended six games without pay by the NBA on Feb. 6 as a result of a domestic violence incident involving his wife . Chicago acquired Nelson in the Nikola Mirotic trade on Feb. 5 and had been a player whom many thought the Bulls would part with. Nelson\u2019s move to Detroit reunites him with coach Stan Van Gundy, who coached Nelson on the Orlando Magic. Under Van Gundy, Nelson enjoyed some of his best seasons in the NBA, garnering an All-Star bid in 2008-09 as the Magic reached The Finals in 2009.

All of the latter are meaningful rotation players. Cleveland did all of this without giving up Kevin Love or the its much sought after 2018 first-round pick from the Brooklyn Nets . Two questions remain: is it enough to 1) turn around the floundering Cavs and 2) keep LeBron James in Cleveland beyond this season? The answer to the latter won\u2019t be known until at least July. It is easier to see why the Cavs think this midseason overhaul will right the ship in the short-term. Cleveland\u2019s first deal will garner the most headlines because of the names involved. Isaiah Thomas, the most significant player acquired in exchange for Kyrie Irving just seven months ago, is now on the Los Angeles Lakers (as is Channing Frye). The Cavs shipped those two, along with their own 2018 first-round pick for high-scoring sixth man Jordan Clarkson and athletic forward Larry Nance Jr. If the Cavs had sincere hopes of Thomas playing a meaningful role before, it is clear those hopes were all but gone after his return from a prolonged hip injury. In 15 games, the two-time All-Star averaged just 14.7 points per game and shot 36.1 percent. In his 406 total minutes played, Cleveland was a whopping minus-132 with him on the court, by far the worst mark on the team. Thomas publicly criticizing teammates and the coaching staff in recent days likely did not help his desires to remain with the Cavs.  On paper, the move makes Cleveland healthier, more athletic and better on defense. The Lakers sported a defensive rating of 100.4 with those Nance Jr. and Clarkson on the floor at the same time. For context, the Spurs rank second in the league with a defensive rating of 101.2. Clarkson, however, is shooting 32.4 percent on 3-pointers this season, while Nance is a none-threat from deep. The hope is that Clarkson will be more efficient with James and Love drawing defensive attention from him. Nance provides an athletic finisher that will no doubt feast on LeBron-led fast breaks. The long-term concern for Cleveland is not so much what they gave up, but to whom. Thomas and Frye are both expiring contracts, which enables to the Lakers to dangle max-level contracts to free agent this summer. The Cavaliers might have given Los Angeles the means to pursue James, among others, this offseason. The second deal that surfaced on Thursday was a doozy: a reported three-team transaction in which Cleveland acquired Utah Jazz guard Rodney Hood and Sacramento Kings guard George Hill. The Cavaliers gave up Iman Shumpert (to Sacramento), Jae Crowder (to Utah), Derrick Rose (to Utah) and a second-round pick (to the Miami Heat) in the trade. Rose, Shumpert and Crowder shot a combined 31.4 percent from 3-point range. Enter Hood and Hill, who are hitting a combined 41 percent from downtown. The deal does carry financial ramifications for Cleveland. Hood\u2019s contract is cheap now, but he becomes a restricted free agent this summer. Wing players with size, speed and shooting are valued commodities in the NBA. The Cavs may be forced to shell out serious money to keep him. Hill, meanwhile, is locked into a contract that pays him roughly $37 million after this season and through 2020 (though the last year is not fully guaranteed). For now, he gives Cleveland a point guard who can shoot, defend and run an offense without demanding the ball nearly as much as Thomas. The Dwyane Wade era in The Land is over after he was reportedly dealt to Miami for a second-round pick. To their credit, the Cavaliers made this move to appease Wade as much as to help themselves. Cleveland gets a modest return on Wade, who is 36 and putting up career-low numbers across the board. That being said, the three-time NBA champ felt he could contribute more than Cleveland was asking. Now he gets the opportunity to show it on behalf of his original team, which is very much in need of a jolt after dropping its fifth straight game. The Heat also get the obvious bonus of welcoming back perhaps the best player in franchise history."},{"id":41848,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/derrick-rose-trade-utah-jazz-plan-waive-reports","date":"2018-02-08","title":"Reports: Utah Jazz plan to waive Derrick Rose; Minnesota Timberwolves interested in signing him","content":" * Latest Trade Deadline Buzz The Utah Jazz reportedly plan to waive former MVP Derrick Rose after acquiring him in a trade with the Cleveland Cavaliers on Thursday , according to reports from Shams Charania of Yahoo Sports and Marc Stein of the New York Times.

In 15 games with the Cavaliers, Thomas averaged 14.7 points, 4.5 assists and 2.1 rebounds in 27.1 minutes while shooting a career-worst 36.1 percent from the floor and 25.3 percent from 3-point. The Cavaliers have struggled to post a record of 7-10 since Thomas returned from injury in early January. Despite the team\u2019s struggles, Thomas said on Wednesday he was \u201ctired of being traded\u201d and wanted to remain on the Cavaliers. \u201cI like it here,\u201d Thomas said after Cleveland\u2019s OT win against Minnesota . \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been as planned, but I definitely want to be here. We definitely have a real chance to win an NBA championship and I want to be a part of that.\u201d Thomas\u2019 agent, Aaron Goodwin, told Cleveland.com this trade is a \u201cgood opportunity for Isaiah\u201d and the situation in Cleveland \u201cclearly wasn\u2019t working\u201d.

Not right now, anyway. He has fully believed for many months that he would eventually return to the Miami Heat, though he figured it would happen in a free-agent deal this coming summer and not on a Thursday afternoon while he was headed into Cleveland\u2019s practice facility for a workout with LeBron James. * Wade, Thomas react to deadline-day deals Then came the text from agent Leon Rose: \u201dCall me 911,\u201d he wrote. \u201dSo if you get a text like that and the trade deadline is coming up and you know the team that you\u2019re on is going to be very active, you know something is going down with you,\u201d Wade said. \u201dAnd my mind went right to, \u2018No, it\u2019s not Miami. There\u2019s no way.\u2019 My mind went right to that because I felt like that\u2019s the only other place I can be.\u201d He was right. Wade, who left Miami in 2016 for his hometown of Chicago, is now back in his NBA hometown. He\u2019s with the Heat again, getting traded as part of Cleveland\u2019s massive roster shake-up Thursday in exchange for a second-round pick in 2024. \u201dI always felt that one day it would happen,\u201d Wade said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201dFor me, it\u2019s always been a hope. You just don\u2019t know how or when you\u2019re going to get there.\u201d How, that became a hastily arranged flight out of Cleveland on Thursday afternoon. When, that will be Friday night, with Wade saying he intends to make his second Heat debut when the Heat play host to the Milwaukee Bucks. It\u2019s Miami\u2019s only home game between now and Feb. 24, and Wade doesn\u2019t want to make fans wait. \u201dI\u2019ve missed them and I know they\u2019ve missed me,\u201d Wade said. Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said on Friday that Wade will not be in the starting lineup. Wade is Miami\u2019s all-time leader in points, games, assists and steals, shots made and shots taken. He returns to Miami with the Heat on a five-game slide, one he helped contribute to when the Cavaliers beat his then-former, now-current club last week. His mission, he said, is simply to help the franchise \u2013 the one that drafted him in 2003 and had him for 13 seasons the first time around, winning three titles \u2013 reach its potential. He raved about the player Heat guard Josh Richardson \u2013 who Spoelstra has compared to a young Wade on more than one occasion \u2013 has become. Wade is back to both help Miami win now and win in the future by mentoring young players. \u201dThis is definitely a playoff team,\u201d Wade said. \u201dThis is a team that a lot of teams around the NBA respect because of the way that they play the game.\u201d Heat President Pat Riley said that in the beginning of this reunion, Wade will likely come off the bench. \u201dDon\u2019t matter,\u201d Wade said. \u201dI can\u2019t wait to embrace whatever role I have.\u201d This trade, in the minds of many involved, will down as the last deal that Henry Thomas ever swung. Thomas, until his death last month, was the agent for both Wade and Heat captain Udonis Haslem. Thomas had deep relationships with the Heat, through his representation of those two players as well as Chris Bosh, Tim Hardaway and Shaun Livingston and others. The Heat even had a moment of silence before a home game on the day that Thomas died. At Thomas\u2019 funeral in Chicago, fences were mended. Wade and Riley, whose relationship would best be described as strained since Wade left for Chicago in the summer of 2016, hugged. Simple as it sounds, that\u2019s all Wade needed to be convinced that his plan for returning to Miami one day would become reality. \u201dHank\u2019s still doing his job from above,\u201d Haslem said. Less than two weeks later, Wade\u2019s back in Miami. \u201dThe hug that we embraced was real and it was all we needed,\u201d Wade said of the brief encounter with Riley at the funeral. \u201dThat\u2019s it. That\u2019s all we both needed. I walked away and I felt better about everything, without even getting into anything.\u201d Wade kept his home in Miami, and his two sons and a nephew that he is raising have been back in school there this year. Wade was back in Miami a few days ago, albeit briefly, to celebrate his oldest son Zaire\u2019s 16th birthday. \u201dThat was the best moment I\u2019ve had in a long time,\u201d Wade said. The kids are thrilled. His wife, Gabrielle Union, is thrilled. His teammates are thrilled. James wished Wade well, both on social media and in person before they went their opposite ways Thursday. Even the Miami Police Department couldn\u2019t contain its excitement, tweeting that a \u201dmissing person\u201d has been found and \u201drecovered in good condition.\u201d \u201dI can\u2019t wait to get back to my environment,\u201d Wade said. \u201dI can\u2019t wait to see the smile on my wife\u2019s face when she\u2019s sitting out tanning outside and all those things, and I can\u2019t wait for the drive to the arena that I can make with my eyes closed.\u201d Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":41860,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/2017-18-kia-rookie-ladder-week-17","date":"2018-02-08","title":"Kia Rookie Ladder: Josh Jackson enters mix; Ben Simmons back at No. 1","content":"In the Week 17 edition of the 2017-18 Kia Rookie Ladder , we check in on the five rookies who are making the biggest impact so far this season. * Previous Kia Rookie Ladders:  Debut edition | Week 12 | Week 13 | Week 14 | Week 15 | Week 16"},{"id":41862,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/kevin-durant-golden-state-warriors-questionable-vs-dallas-mavericks","date":"2018-02-08","title":"Kevin Durant (hand) questionable vs. Dallas Mavericks","content":"The Golden State Warriors may be without their top scorer tonight against the Dallas Mavericks ( 10:30 ET, NBA League Pass ).

One second left in overtime. Incredible pass by Jeff Green. Turnaround fadeaway jumper by James. Ballgame! It was an amazing game for James, who outdueled Jimmy Butler and finished with 37 points, 15 assists and 10 rebounds in 48 minutes in a 140-138 overtime thriller .

J.R. Smith collected the loose ball, but started to dribble before calling a timeout, so Cleveland could not advance the ball to the front court.

While Smoothie King Center crews fashioned a fabric catch basin in the rafters to stop water from dripping on the court, Pacers coach Nate McMillan said coaches and players on both teams didn\u2019t want to risk an injury in the event the make-shift fix didn\u2019t hold up for the duration of Wednesday night\u2019s game. \u201cIt\u2019s not a chance you want to take,\u201d McMillan said. \u201cBoth coaches went out and looked at the floor and looked at the conditions and just really felt that you didn\u2019t want to take a chance of these players going out there playing on the floor with the possibility of a leak happening in the course of a 2 1\/2-hour game in an area where there\u2019s going to be a lot of action right around the free throw line. \u201cAll it takes is one spot for a player to slip on,\u201d McMillan added. \u201cMentally, guys really wouldn\u2019t have been able to go out there and play, knowing that situation.\u201d A number of fans left before a public address announcement was made that the game would not be played. Many of those who remained booed. Officials have not yet announced when the game will be made up. Rain fell on and off throughout the day in New Orleans, but water on the court did not appear to be an issue during warmups. Smoothie King Center general manager Alan Freeman said the source of the leak was difficult to determine without inspecting the roof at another time, so the catch basin was the only possible solution for game night. Freeman says the leak was causing water to run down to a ring of hanging speakers and then drip down to the court. However, no one noticed a problem until about 30 minutes before the scheduled 7 p.m. tip-off. Initially, officials announced that tip would be moved to 7:30, but even after the court was dry, there were no signs of players coming out for a 10-minute warm-up that was supposed to take place before the delayed start of the game. Pelicans All-Star Anthony Davis came out alone at one point and inspected the area where water had fallen. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough, tough situation to have to do it, but it was the safest thing to do,\u201d Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. \u201cAfter looking at several things and looking at the roof and evaluating it, I think they came to a conclusion it\u2019s just not worth risking players\u2019 health.\u201d The Pelicans dance team and mascots tried to entertain fans for the better part of two hours. New Orleans resident Ken Carter, who had seats two rows behind the visitor\u2019s bench, said he was disappointed but understood the decision. \u201cThese athletes work very, very hard to get themselves in shape to put on a great performance and it would be wrong to endanger their careers just for one night,\u201d Carter said. The Pelicans issued a written statement saying tickets for the postponed game would be honored when the game is made up.

Here\u2019s what Begley reported via Twitter : \u2014 12:17 p.m. ET Over the last few days, it has been reported that the Oklahoma City Thunder are looking to be active at the trade deadline. They have been linked to potential deals involving the Chicago Bulls\u2019 Tony Allen and the Utah Jazz\u2019s Rodney Hood , to name two. They\u2019re potentially interested in Atlanta Hawks guard Marco Belinelli (see below). Per The Ringer\u2019s Kevin O\u2019Connor, could be looking to get into the Marcus Smart derby and may have eyes for other players, too : \u2014 10:59 a.m. ET The Boston Celtics didn\u2019t think they\u2019d have a chance at the No. 1 spot in the Eastern Conference when Gordon Hayward went down on opening night with his gruesome injury. Yet, even after last night\u2019s 20-point loss to the Toronto Raptors, the Celtics have the top seed in the East as of this morning . Boston has been mentioned in trade talks for the likes of Memphis Grizzlies guard Tyreke Evans and LA Clippers guard Lou Williams. Those players, though, are on the final years of the deals and acquiring them may make them more or less \u201crental\u201d players for Boston. To land a player like that, the Celtics have reportedly floated trading guard Marcus Smart, who will also be a free agent this summer. According to Steve Bulpett of the Boston Herald, the Celtics don\u2019t seem willing to trade Smart for anything less than a player who can contribute this season and beyond :  \u2014 8:16 a.m. ET The Oklahoma City Thunder and Philadelphia 76ers both have designs on making noise in the 2018 playoffs. Both teams are also in the middle of the pack when it comes to 3-pointers made per game ( Philly makes 10.3; OKC makes 10.2 ) and low in the rankings in 3-point percentage ( Philly ranks 18th at 36 percent; OKC ranks 26th at 35 percent ). According to Orazio Cauchi of the international site Sportando, the Sixers and Thunder have interest in Atlanta Hawks guard Marco Belinelli. The veteran guard is making 37.2 percent of his 3-pointers this season and is among the NBA leaders in 3-pointers made off the bench . Here\u2019s what Cauchi tweeted : According to Michael Cunningham of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution , Belinelli was held out of last night\u2019s 108-82 home win against the Memphis Grizzlies . Belinelli was held out of the game so as to prevent the chance of him getting injured before a potential trade : \u2014 7:22 a.m. ET Lou Williams doesn\u2019t look to be going anywhere at the trade deadline as the 31-year-old veteran is closing in on an extension with the L.A. Clippers, per ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski. The two sides have gained momentum in contract talks and a new deal is reportedly within reach.

The guard is averaging a career-best 23.3 points per game and has helped keep the Clippers in the playoff race throughout injuries and the recent Blake Griffin trade.

All three point guards are first-time nominees on this year\u2019s Hall of Fame ballot. Who gets in?  * * * David Aldridge :  Uh, all of them? Why on earth not? They were three of the best ever, winning MVPs and championships and setting the bar high \u2014 way high \u2014 for what was expected from that position. See all y\u2019all in Springfield this fall. Steve Aschburner : All three? One glimpse at the 2018 candidates list \u2014 with the waiting period for eligibility reduced to three years into retirement \u2014 suggests this year\u2019s HOF class will enter through the loading dock rather than the front door. In this case, regardless, all three belong. The first two I can attest to as an eye witness. No need to have the Hall without them. As for Hammon, people whom I trust and who saw her play sufficiently vouch for her worthiness. But since the basketball Hall voting process is part star chamber, part black box, I don\u2019t get too worked up over \u201cfirst ballot\u201d vs. subsequent entry. Getting in at any point, as long as it\u2019s not posthumous, is swell. Tas Melas:  We know they\u2019re all getting in, let\u2019s not waste anyone\u2019s time putting it off a year or two , although Becky Hammon is not done breaking down gender barriers in basketball and her story is far from written. She reportedly was a candidate for the Milwaukee Bucks GM job last summer \u2014 her ascendance in the NBA, after a Hall of Fame worthy career in the WNBA, is just getting started. She\u2019s gonna need a major addendum years from now  Shaun Powell :  Jason Kidd and Steve Nash are arguably top-10 all-time at the point guard spot. Becky Hammon might also make a case for herself as a six-time WNBA All-Star and two-time All-WNBA first teamer and her stellar play internationally. (Although, I admit, I\u2019m not even pretending to be enough of an expert on women\u2019s basketball to know exactly where she stands within her gender.) Ultimately, they all should get in. But first timers? My bounce pass goes to Kidd and Nash. John Schuhmann :  Whether it\u2019s this year or down the line, all three will be enshrined. Kidd and Nash, two of the five best floor generals in NBA history, should be locks this year, and I don\u2019t see why Hammon wouldn\u2019t be either. She was never thought of as the best point guard in the WNBA, but built up a pretty impressive resume in her 16 seasons, ranking in the top 10 all-time points (eighth) , assists (fourth) and 3-point percentage (eighth) . The Hall of Fame is about more than just the NBA and WNBA, so her accomplishments playing internationally can only help her case.  Sekou Smith :  Jason Kidd and Steve Nash are locks. If not, go ahead and shutter the doors at the Naismith Memorial Hall of Fame. And Becky Hammon\u2019s case is just as strong, given her status as one of the WNBA\u2019s top 15 all-time players (in 2011) and making the WNBA 20@20 . But Kidd and Nash have to be no-brainers. We\u2019re talking about two of the transcendent players at the position \u2014 an NBA champion (Kidd) and a two-time MVP (Nash) \u2014 who helped change the way the position was played. The fact they spent time as teammates (in Phoenix) and both, at different points, worked alongside another future Hall of Famer (Dirk Nowitzki) makes their status as first-time nominees even more interesting. Kidd\u2019s basketball body of work is beyond reproach. And Nash\u2019s college and NBA careers, even without a title, put him on solid HOF footing. It should be a point guard party with all three on the list."},{"id":41887,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-what-will-you-remember-most-about-dirk-nowitzkis-career","date":"2018-02-07","title":"Blogtable: What will you remember most about Dirk Nowitzki's career?","content":"* * * Dirk Nowitzki ( or is it Nowitkzi? ) has now logged more than 50,000 NBA minutes . What will you remember most about Nowitzki when he finally calls it quits?  * * * David Aldridge :  That he was the greatest shooting big in the history of the game \u2014 and the impact of that is seen every night, with stretch fours and fives now just \u201cfours\u201d and \u201cfives.\u201d Big men are now expected to be able to shoot from deep; those who stay in the post are dinosaurs, Betamaxes. Small ball and analytics surely drove the point home, but it was the Diggler that showed it was possible in the first place. Oh, one other thing: he was, and is, a righteous, woke man. Now, shut it down! Let\u2019s go home! Steve Aschburner : My most vivid and lasting memories of Dirk will be from the 2011 Finals victory over heavily favored Miami. Nowitzki was so cool and classy when LeBron James and Dwyane Wade mocked him to reporters , i.e., the world because they didn\u2019t believe he was sick. Dirk & Co. just went our and forced some humility on the Heat. It was a nice equalizer for the Finals Dallas let slip away to Miami four years earlier. Tas Melas:  It\u2019s gonna be impossible to forget about Dirk while watching the NBA \u2018cause so many guys use the one-legged lean back jumper he perfected. He needs to film a music video with Fat Joe. Dirk and his shooting coach, Holger Geschwindner put in so much work together and Nowitzki\u2019s shooting form, body positioning, and footwork are his hallmarks. For me, overcoming the 2007 season where he was named MVP and then eliminated by the \u201cWe Believe\u201d Warriors in the first round was when he exorcised his demons.  Shaun Powell :  How could it not be the wrong-legged jumper? Sure, there\u2019s much more to Dirk\u2019s legacy than that, including the manner in which he put the Mavericks (and Mark Cuban) on the map, how he spent his entire career with one team, his series-changing finger roll against the Miami Heat in Game 4 that helped win a championship, and being the finest European import the game has ever seen. Still, that jumper, that form \u2026 John Schuhmann :  He was nothing like we\u2019ve ever seen before, a seven-footer with incredible touch out beyond the 3-point line. He will leave a legacy beyond the numbers and the 2011 championship, because the one-legged, turnaround fadeaway that so many players have tried to emulate will forever be known as Dirk Nowitzki\u2019s shot. It\u2019s unguardable, especially when he (as he so often does) gets a pick-and-roll switch onto a guard at the nail (middle of the foul line), something I\u2019ll always call \u201cthe Dirk play.\u201d Personally, I\u2019ll also appreciate him for his attitude. There are some players in this league that take themselves too seriously. Dirk is definitely not one of them.  Sekou Smith :  I had the good fortune of drawing Mavericks duty for their entire playoff run the year Dallas won its lone championship in 2011 . I\u2019ll always remember how Dirk showed up time after time to lead the team, doing what all of the all-time great champions tend to do during title runs. The coolest part about it was just how unassuming he and the Mavericks were during that postseason run \u2026 well, save for Shawn Marion and Jason Terry (who regularly let the media know they were the team to beat). Dirk just kept showing up, game after game, series after series, outdueling the other superstars he faced each and every time. They were on the ropes in their first-round series against the Portland Trail Blazers , but survived that scare. They then swept the two-time defending champion Los Angeles Lakers in the conference semifinals, which was when it dawned on me that they could win it all. They finished off the Oklahoma City Thunder in five games in the conference finals and vanquished the Miami Heat\u2019s Big 3 in The Finals . Being on that ride, the best of Nowitzki\u2019s Hall of Fame career, was as fun a time as you can have. And watching an all-time great at his zenith, it doesn\u2019t get much better than that. I had a totally different appreciation for his game after seeing that up close. * * *"},{"id":41879,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-thoughts-golden-state-warriors-okc-thunder-round-2","date":"2018-02-07","title":"Blogtable: Thoughts on latest Oklahoma City Thunder-Golden State Warriors showdown?","content":"* * * Biggest takeaway from Tuesday night\u2019s Thunder-Warriors Round 2 ?  * * * David Aldridge :  Paul George is a problem \u2014 a major one \u2014 for the Warriors. Over seven games, Warriors coach Steve Kerr may find a lineup that works against the Thunder, but for now, he doesn\u2019t have any answer for PG13. Golden State\u2019s whole Raison d\u2019etre is fluid ball movement leading to soul-sapping 3-pointers and dunks. George wrecked that all by himself, as he\u2019s done throughout the season in a formidable Kia Defensive Player of the Year campaign. On the ball, off the ball, helping, recovering \u2014 George seemed to be everywhere wreaking defensive havoc, while scoring, somehow, a quiet 38 . George and Steven Adams are just a devastating halfcourt duo defensively. I\u2019m by no means saying the Thunder will definitely beat the Warriors in the playoffs. But the template is there. (Which, he notes parenthetically, is not good news for the Los Angeles Lakers or LA Clippers.) Steve Aschburner : Good for the Thunder, ho-hum for the Warriors. OKC needed to stop its Oakland losing streak, end a four-game skid and feel better about itself since losing defensive-minded guard Andre Roberson. This one hardly proved the Thunder are back to their old stingy selves, though the third quarter was a start. For Golden State, I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s more of a teachable moment that coach Steve Kerr and his staff craved to get their guys\u2019 attention. Might not have it in undivided form till after the All-Star break, at which point this type of performance will become more concerning. Tas Melas:  Draymond Green is beginning to earn himself reputation techs. As patient as the referees have been with Green, it may have reached a tipping point. That second tech when he gently lobbed the ball at the ref was clearly a: \u201cWe\u2019ve had enough and will whistle you on any semblance of breaking the rules.\u201d He has to be aware of this fact in playoffs Round 2, or 3, or 4 Shaun Powell :  The harmony between Russell Westbrook and Paul George is championship-contender quality. They play well off each other and it shows almost nightly; this is the chemistry that could convince George to stay in OKC, although the rest of the club isn\u2019t so deep or talented or intriguing. Also, the Warriors (and especially Draymond Green) really need to get a grip on their behavior towards referees. But you knew that. John Schuhmann :  Turnovers were probably the bigger issue on Tuesday, but on a more macro scale, it\u2019s noteworthy that the Warriors\u2019 defense has lost its edge. They certainly aren\u2019t where the Cavs are, but the champs rank 26th defensively since late December , with their biggest issues being 3-point defense ( 29th over that stretch ) and forcing turnovers ( 28th ). This is a team that, despite all its talent, has never just relied on its historically efficient offense to get by and never had to find \u201cthe switch,\u201d because they\u2019ve built good defensive habits from Day 1 of training camp. On Tuesday, they let the Paul George and Russell Westbrook walk into a lot of comfortable jumpers and build a rhythm early. It\u2019s probably just an energy issue that will resolve itself after the All-Star break (and it wouldn\u2019t be the first time where we\u2019ve seen defensive slippage from a team that has gone to The Finals each of the last three years), but this is the Warriors\u2019 worst defensive stretch in their four seasons under Steve Kerr and it has allowed the Houston Rockets to climb into a tie in the loss column for the No. 1 seed in the West (with Houston holding the tiebreaker).  Sekou Smith :  The Thunder remain the true wild card for me in the entire playoff field. For all of the issues they have had and continue to deal with, they\u2019ve shown themselves more than capable against the Western Conference\u2019s top two teams. They can grind away at both the Warriors and Houston Rockets in ways that no other team in the league can. Russell Westbrook and Paul George lead the way and Steven Adams and the rest of that long, athletic (and much-improved from earlier in the season) supporting cast following along. You watch these regular season statement games to see if there are any clues as to what could translate into a potential postseason matchup. The Warriors (and Rockets) should absolutely take this Thunder team as a serious threat. And once again, the Warriors can get away with playing fast and loose with the ball against a huge chunk of the league. But turnovers and losing your composure against a team like the Thunder \u2014 a team that has your picture up on the dart board every day \u2014 is a recipe for disaster."},{"id":41881,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/carmelo-anthony-oklahoma-city-thunder-ankle-injury-vs-golden-state-warriors","date":"2018-02-07","title":"Carmelo Anthony (ankle) questionable vs. Los Angeles Lakers on Thursday","content":" Oklahoma City put a halt to its four-game skid on Tuesday night in a big way, scoring a 125-105 road win against the mighty Golden State Warriors.

And, if you missed it, here\u2019s what happened in trade talks on Monday . * * * As All-Star point guard John Wall mends from his knee surgery , his Washington Wizards are more than holding down the fort in his absence. They have won five in a row (every game Wall has missed) and are creeping up on the Cleveland Cavaliers for the No. 3 spot in the Eastern Conference. The Wizards have been mentioned in trade talks involving LA Clippers center DeAndre Jordan and they may be looking to move center Marcin Gortat to land him. ESPN\u2019s Brian Windhorst has more on the Wizards\u2019 trade chatter : \u2014 1:52 p.m. ET The Cleveland Cavaliers had been linked to trade talks involving veteran Sacramento Kings guard George Hill in mid-January . The Kings, for their part, aren\u2019t in a big rush to trade Hill anywhere . And, of course, there is the issue of Cleveland trying to make a trade despite having not much that other teams want (save for that 2018 Brooklyn Nets pick). Chris Mannix of Yahoo Sports digs through a rich smattering of trade chatter from around the league, including the Cavs-Hill talk, which teams are looking to sell (Atlanta Hawks and Orlando Magic) and which teams could be wild cards : \u2014 1:26 p.m. ET Tyreke Evans of the Memphis Grizzlies has not suited up since Feb. 1 while the team hashes out potential trade destinations for him. Evans\u2019 averages of 19.5 points, five rebounds and five assists per game are some of the best in years and he is drawing trade overtures from a handful of teams. ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski reports that three teams \u2014 the Boston Celtics, Denver Nuggets and Philadelphia 76ers \u2014 are leading the charge for Evans\u2019 services (with another squad close behind). Here\u2019s what Wojnarowski wrote on Twitter : \u2014 12:42 p.m. ET Whatever roster makeover or trade the Cleveland Cavaliers can perhaps pull off between now and Thursday\u2019s deadline are thought to be done with making LeBron James happy going forward. And for James, the notion of him seeking a trade for the Cavs is, perhaps, an option as well. But Shams Charania of Yahoo Sports reports that James will not drop his no-trade clause and is determined to see the season through in Cleveland. James can opt out of his contract this summer and enter free agency, moves that are expected by some to happen come the July free agency period. Here\u2019s what Charania wrote on Twitter : \u2014 12:21 p.m. ET DeAndre Jordan is one of the best rim-protecting big men in the game and a former All-Star as well. His name has been tossed about in trade rumors as his LA Clippers are fighting to keep in the race for the No. 8 spot in the Western Conference. If Jordan is moved, however, the thinking is that teams would do so with the knowledge he will opt in for the 2018-19 season, reports TNT analyst David Aldridge. However, Jordan does not seem to be open to opting in, reports Aldridge. And, given the agent change Jordan made last year, the chances of Jordan opting in look even less likely. Here\u2019s what Aldridge wrote on Twitter : \u2014 12:15 p.m. ET As mentioned below, the Boston Celtics are reportedly not looking to trade Marcus Smart because of his on-court production or any other issue. Rather, the kind of contract Smart \u2014 an unrestricted free agent this summer \u2014 could get on the open market may make it tough for Boston to keep him in a number of ways. Marc Stein of The New York Times reports that the Celtics are looking to swap Smart for an extra first-round pick in hopes of using it for a trade that would net either the LA Clippers\u2019 Lou Williams or the Memphis Grizzlies\u2019 Tyreke Evans. Here\u2019s what Stein wrote on Twitter : \u2014 12:02 p.m. ET A season-ending injury to Andre Roberson has caused more than a few defensive issues for the Oklahoma City Thunder of late. His replacement in the starting lineup, 19-year-old rookie Terrance Ferguson, has not been effective on either side of the ball so far for the Thunder. As such, OKC is perhaps looking to make a deal as the deadline nears, writes Royce Young of ESPN. They have been linked to swingmen Rodney Hood of the Utah Jazz and Tony Allen of the Chicago Bulls, but may have some hurdles to overcome in any potential trade situation : \u2014 11:57 a.m. ET Winning six games in a row will always do a lot to help team chemistry in the NBA. Doing that in the midst of the trade deadline with several key players mentioned in trade talks? That\u2019s where the Utah Jazz find themselves this morning. The Jazz romped past the New Orleans Pelicans on the road last night, pulling Utah within three games of those Pelicans for the No. 8 spot in the Western Conference . Tony Jones of The Salt Lake Tribune has more on the quandary the Jazz find themselves and whether or not key players mentioned in trade talks (Rodney Hood, Derrick Favors, Alec Burks) will be dealt : \u2014 11:22 a.m. ET Boston Celtics guard Marcus Smart had his name floated in trade talks yesterday involving the Denver Nuggets and guard Emmanuel Mudiay . Today, he remains a topic of a potential trade for Boston \u2014 but not because of any shortcomings in his game or off-the-court incidents. Smart is averaging 10.1 points, 3.6 rebounds and 4.4 assists per game for Boston in 46 games, logging 10 starts. He suffered a cut to his hand on Jan. 26 and has been out of the lineup due to that injury. According to Steve Bulpett of the Boston Herald , Smart is being shopped because the Celtics may be worried about what it will take to re-sign him this summer : \u2014 9:27 a.m. ET January was a month of progress of sorts for the Los Angeles Lakers. They were 8-7 \u2014 their lone winning month so far this season \u2014 and scored wins against the playoff-bound Indiana Pacers and Boston Celtics during that stretch. While that may lead to some reasons for optimism about the Lakers, they are still decidedly in a rebuilding phase as they parse through their young talent on the roster. ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski and Ramona Shelburne report the front office is shifting its free agency focus from the summer of 2018 to 2019. With that in mind, players who had been mentioned in trade talks (like Julius Randle and Jordan Clarkson) are perhaps not as likely to be dealt now : \u2014 9:08 a.m. ET Four losses in five games \u2014 coupled with a win streak by another team \u2014 has the Philadelphia 76ers\u2019 playoff positioning a little dicey as of this morning. The Sixers are still holding down No. 8 in the Eastern Conference standings, but Detroit\u2019s recent four-game win streak has the Pistons at .500 just like Philly. Might the Sixers be looking to add some scoring punch before Thursday\u2019s trade deadline, then, to keep teams like the Pistons at bay? According to Keith Pompey of the Philadelphia Inquirer , the Sixers are still interested in Memphis Grizzlies guard Tyreke Evans and may be in pursuit of LA Clippers guard Lou Williams, too : \u2014 8:35 a.m. ET DeAndre Jordan and Lou Williams of the LA Clippers are in the midst of solid seasons. Their team, however, is struggling to stay in the Western Conference playoff chase and after last week\u2019s trade of Blake Griffin to the Detroit Pistons, it seems a rebuild may soon be afoot for the Clippers. As our David Aldridge pointed out in his Morning Tip yesterday , the Clippers are staking a lot of their future on what they got back in that Griffin trade. If more moves are afoot and players like Jordan and Williams (and others) are dealt, they know it can happen anytime now. Broderick Turner of the Los Angeles Times  got a sense of how Clippers coach Doc Rivers is helping his players deal with the chatter : \u2014 8:23 a.m. ET Struggling and stumbling have marked the Cleveland Cavaliers of late, with Saturday\u2019s 48-point loss to the Houston Rockets on ABC serving as the latest difficulty. The Cavs have been in a variety of trade talks for weeks now, with their names being linked to the likes of DeAndre Jordan, George Hill and some other fairly big names. With LeBron James\u2019 free agency\/opt out looming this summer, the Cavs are considered by many to be players at the trade deadline. Joe Vardon of Cleveland.com points out that if (or when) the Cavs make a move, who they acquire and the contract that player (or players) has will say much about where the team may be headed next . In short, owner Dan Gilbert \u2014 per Cleveland.com \u2014 does not want to pay the luxury tax in 2018-19 if James has left the team in free agency. \u2014 7:57 a.m. ET The Chicago Bulls have already parted ways with Nikola Mirotic, doing so with last week\u2019s trade of him to the New Orleans Pelicans . Another big man on the Bulls\u2019 roster, veteran center Robin Lopez, has seen his name in trade rumors the last few days (although he has not yet been linked to any team in particular). Lopez got ejected in last night\u2019s 104-98 road loss to the Sacramento Kings after getting two technical fouls in the first half. After the defeat, Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg said he has spoken a bit with Lopez about the trade chatter surrounding him, writes K.C. Johnson of the Chicago Tribune : Additionally, Joe Cowley of the Chicago Sun-Times reports the Bulls are willing to move just about anyone not named Kris Dunn, Zach LaVine or Lauri Markkanen : \u2014 7:46 a.m. ET * * *"},{"id":47689,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-lebron-james-cleveland-cavaliers-will-not-drop-no-trade-clause-2017-18","date":"2018-02-06","title":"LeBron James will not waive no-trade clause this season","content":"The Cleveland Cavaliers are in the thick of much of the trade-deadline chatter buzzing about these days.

There was Rasheed Wallace being sent from the Atlanta Hawks to the Detroit Pistons in 2004, Pau Gasol going from the Memphis Grizzlies to the Los Angeles Lakers in \u201907 and Clyde Drexler going from the Portland Trail Blazers to the Houston Rockets in 1995. Don\u2019t forget about Dikembe Mutombo going from the Atlanta Hawks to the Philadelphia 76ers in \u201801, Shaquille O\u2019Neal sent by the Miami Heat to the Phoenix Suns in \u201908 and last year, DeMarcus Cousins heading to the New Orleans Pelicans right after the All-Star Game. All beat the February deadline buzzer with a bang. And then there was the one on Feb. 7, 1979 between the Sixers and then-New Jersey Nets : Harvey Catchings, Ralph Simpson and cash swapped for Eric Money and Al Skinner. A minor deal? Perhaps, and yet: It was the deadline deal that threw the league for a loop, caused some temporary panic and created one of the craziest scenes in NBA history. It ensured that three of those players would play for both of those teams \u2026 in the same game. A game that needed four months to finish. * Box score:  Sixers vs. Nets game from Nov. 8, 1978 And maybe longer to completely comprehend, especially when you read the box score, which is confusing and needs to be preserved as proof that this indeed took place. The absurdity of it all is we\u2019re more likely to see someone beat Wilt Chamberlain\u2019s 100-point game before three traded players get some burn on both benches again. \u201cAll these years later,\u201d said Simpson, \u201cI still can\u2019t believe it happened. But it did. I know. I was there.\u201d To answer your first question: No, the trade didn\u2019t happen at halftime, causing the players to run down the hall and to the other locker room and switch jerseys. That would\u2019ve been crazy (and against league rules). But this is borderline crazy. This happened in a league you wouldn\u2019t recognize today. The NBA in the late 1970s was, shall we say, a different and distinctly quieter one than today\u2019s. This was pre-ESPN and Twitter and NBA 2K and \u201cInside The NBA\u201d. Teams traveled on regular planes, with players sitting next to regular people. Four NBA cities from then (San Diego, Seattle, Kansas City and East Rutherford\/New Jersey) are no longer around. The NBA Finals was shown on tape-delay after midnight because the networks \u2014 who are now shelling out $2 billion for rights \u2014 would rather stick with re-runs on Sunday afternoons and sitcoms in prime-time back then.  And so, there was nothing special initially about a Nov. 8, 1978 tip-off between the Nets and Sixers , played just a few weeks into the 1978-79 season. The Sixers had Julius Erving but the supporting cast wasn\u2019t yet ripe enough and Philadelphia was four seasons from its first of several Finals runs in the \u201870s and early \u201880s. Meanwhile, the Nets had sold Erving to the Sixers after the 1976 ABA-NBA merger and were barreling fast toward irrelevancy because of it. The former two-time ABA champs wouldn\u2019t taste respectability again until Jason Kidd arrived (in a trade) three decades later . The Nets did have a young, future Hall of Famer in Bernard King, though, and this is where the twisted tale begins. King was in his second season and wound up averaging 21.6 points per game that season, demanding double-teams nightly. The Sixers threw help on King all night and in the third quarter, the extra defensive layer was a hulking center named Steve Mix (whose biggest contribution to basketball was being big). King drove hard to the basket, there was contact with Mix, and King was whistled for an offensive foul. Enraged, King screamed at referee Roger McCann, ignoring the fact that he already had a technical. Now he had two and an automatic ejection. King kept screaming and gesturing and then punted a courtside chair on his way to the locker room. Watching this unfold, and reaching for his whistle, was the other referee, Richie Powers. Powers was one of a handful of referees who had clout and a measure of respect in that era, along with Earl Strom, Norm Drucker and Jake O\u2019Donnell. Famously short-fused and thin-skinned, officials of that era took no lip from players and coaches and often punctuated violation calls with colorful body language. Powers, a 23-season NBA official, worked 25 Finals games in his career. But this was late in his career, when the body begins to creak and the pace of the game gets foggier to the eyes. Just two years earlier, he was pivotal in the epic triple-overtime Game 5 of the 1976 NBA Finals, which featured legendary shot-making from Gar Heard and John Havlicek. (In that game, Powers was at the center of a crucial call. With the score tied at regulation and seconds left, Paul Silas called for a timeout in which the Celtics didn\u2019t have. Powers ignored it, rather than blow a whistle and call an automatic technical. That made Suns GM Jerry Colangelo say: \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for Richie Powers, we would\u2019ve won that game and maybe the championship.\u201d) Powers called a technical on King, giving him three for the game and one over the limit. Nets coach Kevin Loughery jumped from the bench and raced onto the floor. He got three technicals from Powers, too, which was illegal. \u201cI liked Richie, but he had a habit of giving technicals,\u201d Loughery said recently. \u201cAnd unfortunately for me, I got a lot of technicals. That\u2019s one thing I regret in my career. They\u2019re human beings and make mistakes. Sometimes my reactions made it personal.\u201d The referees hated doing Loughery\u2019s games because he relentlessly worked them. He was usually among the most T\u2019d-up coaches every season and in his ABA days, he got six techs in one game . \u201cThat call on Bernard set everything in motion, then Kevin went ballistic and next thing I know, the game was out of control with all the technicals,\u201d said Catchings. The Nets played on without King and Loughery. Taking over as coach was the lead assistant, Phil Jackson; this would be his first stint in a head-coaching capacity. Taking over the scoring load from King was Eric Money, a point guard who originally scored 37 points, a season-high, for a game that went double-overtime before the Sixers won 137-133. Game over. Or maybe not. The Nets protested and the league office wasn\u2019t thrilled with Powers for his avalanche of technicals. Commissioner Larry O\u2019Brien suspended Powers for five games for \u201cfailure to comply with league procedure.\u201d * Box score:  Sixers, Nets replay game on March 23, 1979  O\u2019Brien also ordered the game to be replayed starting at the 5:50 mark of the third quarter, when the technicals flew. Given the demands of the schedule, the replay couldn\u2019t happen until March 23 , when the teams had a previously-scheduled game in Philly. Therefore, it would be a double-header: The makeup game first, followed by the scheduled game. Both teams agreed . But before that double-header, they agreed on something else: A trade between them, that Feb. 7, before the deadline. Catchings, Simpson and cash from the Sixers to the Nets for Money and Skinner. Some introductions are in order: Money was a shifty guard who averaged 18.6 ppg for his hometown Detroit Pistons in \u201977-78 , but played only six seasons for three teams. Skinner was a college and pro teammate of Erving but largely a journeyman whose biggest contribution to basketball came later as Boston College\u2019s coach. Catchings was a gangly 6-foot-9 forward who didn\u2019t begin playing basketball until he was 16 and wasn\u2019t recruited by any big program out of high school. Simpson was a big scorer in the ABA with the Nuggets, where he averaged 27.4 ppg one season, but never averaged more than 6.1 ppg in his NBA days . (Catchings and Simpson eventually became far less famous than their daughters: Tameka Catchings was a WNBA champion and MVP, while India Arie has won four Grammys and sold 10 million records. Also on that Sixers team were fellow teammates \u2013 Joe Bryant, Doug Collins and Henry Bibby \u2014 who produced famous sons Kobe Bryant, Chris Collins and Mike Bibby, respectively.) \u201cI welcomed the trade,\u201d said Catchings. \u201cI told Billy Cunningham, my coach on the Sixers whom I had a tremendous respect for, that if I stayed there, my career\u2019s going to be cut short. They were committed to Darryl Dawkins and Caldwell Jones. The deck was stacked against me. I wasn\u2019t angry or anything, but I told Billy if he could get me out of there, I\u2019d appreciate it.\u201d Simpson said: \u201cI didn\u2019t think I was going to get traded because I\u2019d been playing well. But I wasn\u2019t really upset. Harvey and I had become pretty good friends and I also knew Kevin Loughery from the ABA. We all had respect for one another.\u201d That trade raised an obvious issue: The suspended game. Once again, the league huddled, then decided the traded players could play in the makeup game, but for their new teams. And so, on the afternoon of March 23, the game clock at tipoff read 5:50 instead of 12:00, and it was the third quarter instead of the first, and the Sixers were up 84-81. Catchings, Money and Simpson played for the other team this time while Skinner rode the bench for the Sixers just as he rode the bench for the Nets in the previous game. \u201cThe strangest situation I\u2019ve ever been in,\u201d said Simpson. \u201cI was laughing about it, Julius (Erving) was laughing. It was sort of funny for everybody.\u201d  Powers didn\u2019t ref the makeup game. And nobody earned a technical, either. However, there was the matter of the official box score, which showed that Powers, in fact, did work the \u201cgame,\u201d as did three other referees. \u201cThat\u2019s when it really hit me, when I walked on the court and saw all of my old teammates,\u201d said Catchings. \u201cI thought no way would they let us do this, but then you see the clock and the guys you spent 4 1\/2 years with now on the other side, it was mind blowing. Dawkins was teasing me about it the whole game. You know how Darryl is.\u201d Money lost points in the process. Remember, when King was ejected, Money\u2019s number was called and he also had the benefit of two OT periods. But officially, he was credited with 23 points, down from his now-erased 37. He was the only one of the three who scored in the makeup game, getting four points for his new team, the Sixers, meaning he scored for both teams in the same game. The Nets lost that November game and lost this one too, 123-117. The teams went to their locker rooms, rested and showered, then put on fresh uniforms and prepared to play the second game of the double-header. The Sixers won again, which means they beat the Nets three times which counted as two. \u201cAll the fans got their money\u2019s worth,\u201d said Loughery. \u201cTwo games for the price of one.\u201d Technically, it was five quarters plus 5 minutes and 50 seconds worth of basketball, but at that point who was counting anymore? Loughery and the three who played in both games say their memory of that moment is getting trickier. So many years have passed, and as Loughery said: \u201cI got so many technicals in my career, they all seem the same.\u201d All that\u2019s left, really, is a box score that reads like it bypassed the auto-correct. Three players listed for both teams in the same game? And just for fun, guess who met in the first round of the playoffs that year? Nets vs. Sixers, won by Philly. No matter what happens in the NBA between now and Thursday\u2019s trade deadline, no matter the names or the number of players involved or how controversial the trades may be, those deals can only raise questions. They will never create a trivia question. * * * Veteran NBA writer Shaun Powell has worked for newspapers and other publications for more than 25 years.

Already this season, a handful of deals have taken place ( which you can keep track of here ). As we close in on the official trade deadline ( Feb. 8, 3 p.m. ET ), talks of other deals will be bandied about. Keep up with the latest rumblings around the NBA \u2014 and the latest deals that have been agreed to \u2014 as deadline day approaches. * * * The Milwaukee Bucks have added depth to their frontcourt with the addition of Brooklyn Nets center Tyler Zeller . The Nets will receive former first-round pick Rashad Vaughn and a 2018 second-round pick in the deal. Zeller was the starting center in Brooklyn before rookie Jarrett Allen took over the spot. In 42 games this season, Zeller is averaging 7.1 points and 4.6 rebounds in 16.7 minutes . \u2014 6:36 p.m. ET Utah Jazz guard Rodney Hood has had his name mentioned in trade talks more than a few times as the deadline has approached, and that is happening again. According to The Salt Lake Tribune \u2018s Tony Jones, a handful of teams in both conferences are interested in him. As well, backup guard Alec Burks is drawing interest from teams, too \u2014 but his contract may hinder a deal getting done. Here\u2019s more from Jones on the Jazz trade talk : Hood is in the midst of the best statistical season of his career, averaging 16.4 points per game while making 38.7 percent of his 3-pointers . Injuries have limited him to 37 games this season and he has been frustrated by his role as a reserve as well, Jones writes. As for Burks, he is two years removed from knee and ankle surgery that ended his 2015-16 season after 31 games . He has played in 48 games this season, averaging 9.2 ppg and 3.4 rpg in 18.8 mpg off the bench. \u2014 2:42 p.m. ET Denver has designs this season on getting back to the playoffs for the first time since 2013. While the Nuggets would be in the playoffs if they started today (as the No. 8 seed), they are also perhaps in the market for some more depth in the backcourt. According to Marc Stein of The New York Times , the Nuggets have explored acquiring Boston Celtics guard Marcus Smart. The Nuggets, Stein reports, have made third-year guard Emmanuel Mudiay available in such a trade, but the Celtics want more in return. Here\u2019s more from Stein, via Twitter : Smart is averaging 10.1 points, 3.6 rebounds and 4.4 assists per game for Boston in 46 games, logging 10 starts. He suffered a cut to his hand on Jan. 26 and has been out of the lineup due to that injury. Mudiay has appeared in 41 games for Denver, averaging 8.5 ppg, 2.2 rpg and 2.9 apg. He averaged a season-low 9.6 minutes per game in January, but has received more playing time so far this month (17.2 mpg). \u2014 1:42 p.m. ET The New York Knicks have no shortage of centers , with Enes Kanter, Joakim Noah, Willy Hernangomez and Kyle O\u2019Quinn all available to log minutes at the position. To date, only Kanter and O\u2019Quinn have been significant regulars in the playing rotation. Noah and the Knicks last week mutually agreed to take an indefinite leave of absence from the team . As for Hernangomez, he has appeared in just 25 games \u2014 the last coming on New Year\u2019s Eve \u2014 and is averaging 4.4 ppg and 2.6 rpg in 9.2 mpg this season. After averaging 18.4 mpg and looking like a solid contributor for the Knicks (8.2 ppg, 7.0 rpg, 1.3 apg) last season, he has been a non-factor in the Knicks\u2019 plans and is asking for a trade. Stefan Bondy of the New York Daily News has more : Shams Charania of Yahoo Sports, who first reported the news, reports Hernangomez wants a trade to a team where he can continue his development : \u2014 1:06 p.m. ET On Feb. 1, the Memphis Grizzlies made the reported decision to sit Tyreke Evans as they hash out a possible trade destination for him . The veteran guard, whose averages of 19.5 points, 5.0 rebounds and 5.0 assists per game are some of the best he\u2019s posted since his rookie season (2009-10), will be an unrestricted free agent this summer. According to Vincent Goodwill of NBCSportsChicago.com, the Philadelphia 76ers are showing interest in landing the guard. Here\u2019s more from Goodwill, via Twitter : Per Ronald Tillery of The Commercial Appeal , the Grizzlies have been seeking a first-round pick for Evans in trades . \u2014 10:45 a.m. ET * * *"},{"id":41904,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/orlando-magic-aaron-gordon-has-withdrawn-dunk-contest","date":"2018-02-05","title":"Orlando Magic forward Aaron Gordon has withdrawn from 2018 Verizon Slam Dunk","content":" Orlando Magic forward Aaron Gordon will not participate in the 2018 Verizon Slam Dunk, the team announced today in a tweet from its official public relations account. \u201cOrlando Magic forward Aaron Gordon will not play tonight at Miami due to a strained left hip flexor.

Steelers coaches since 1969: Chuck Noll, Bill Cowher (1992), Mike Tomlin (2007). Spurs starting point guards (not counting guys who\u2019ve started there occasionally over the years because of injuries) since the 1994-95 season: Avery Johnson, Antonio Daniels\/Terry Porter (2000-01), Tony Parker (2001-02), Dejounte Murray (2017-18). Four point guards in almost a quarter century. As my friend Tony likes to say: that\u2019s it. That\u2019s the list .  That there was little fanfare in San Antonio when Murray took over for good on Jan. 21 , was \u2026 because San Antonio. The Spurs wouldn\u2019t make any public noise if the duplex in which they were all living burst into flames at 3 a.m. Hello, 911. There is a combustion event occurring at our domicile. Please do not send any assistance. We just thought it prudent and appropriate to inform you that we will be attaching a hose to the nearest available hydrant. No, we\u2019ll do it ourselves. Thank you for your time. But it doesn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t a big, big deal. And even a young guy like Murray understood the significance of it, and was willing to fall in line to do it \u201cThe Spurs Way .\u201d He knows that, one day, he\u2019ll be at the other end of this. \u201cAs you see, they do the right things,\u201d Murray said at the Spurs\u2019 practice facility last week. \u201cThey\u2019ve got the right people, the character, people that\u2019s willing to help you get better, from watching film, to strength, to shooting, to ballhandling. They have everything. Everybody\u2019s comfortable with each other; everyone respects one another. It\u2019s just a blessing to be around so (many) great people. There\u2019s not one person that I can tell you steered me the wrong way. Everybody is supportive of one another, we respect one another. The love is all one. It\u2019s a family here.\u201d Parker \u2014 even an older, diminished, oft-injured, 35-year-old Parker \u2014 is a seminal figure in Spurs history, a man and player who commands respect in that locker room because of what he\u2019s accomplished over 16-plus NBA seasons. A rookie starter at age 19. A six-time All-Star. A Finals MVP . A future first ballot Hall of Famer. And someone who killed himself when he absolutely did not have to in order to get back on the court this season . It took Spurs coach Gregg Popovich a couple of days to summon up the nerve to finally have the talk with one of his all-time favorite players, the tough love combined with allowing Parker to spend summer after summer playing for his beloved French national team over the years manifest of that feeling. It wasn\u2019t a long talk between coach and player. The message was simple: it\u2019s time. And, this is permanent. It would be a lie to say Parker was happy. He\u2019s a mighty competitor. But he accepted Popovich\u2019s decision, just as Tim Duncan and Manu Ginobili and others in recent years have as their roles were changed and reduced. \u201dA lot of people don\u2019t understand the relationship I have with Pop, the respect we have for each other,\u201d Parker said. \u201cAnd so, for me, it\u2019s like, I\u2019ll trust him. Whatever happens. I have a feeling that he\u2019ll take care of me my whole career, and I know he will until I\u2019m finished. When he told me he thought it was best for the team, me coming off the bench and play with Manu, maybe we\u2019ll bring some energy and stuff like that, I believe him. I trust him. And if he thinks we can do something even better with for team, I\u2019m fine with it. I\u2019ve been very blessed to be with the Spurs all those years, and that\u2019s part of our mentality. Me, Manu, Timmy, always sharing for the team.\u201d Often, \u2019culture\u2019 in an organization means \u2019we do what the best player wants us to do.\u2019 That\u2019s not culture; that\u2019s appropriation masquering as standards. The Spurs have true culture. It\u2019s a culture that could make David Robinson see he had to take a back seat almost immediately to Duncan , that saw Daniels realize the team would win more with Parker starting, that got Duncan to know when it was time for the offense to stop running through him and to start going through Kawhi Leonard . It is a culture that has seen Popovich reinvent the team over and over for 20 years. Most every player in the NBA wants to win. But most of them want to win without making any real sacrifices to their numbers \u2014 shots, money, whatever. (This is also true of many coaches, whose egos are just as big as most players. Trust me.) Parker is one of the winningest point guards of his generation \u2014 four championships, including that Finals MVP in 2007 as he led the Spurs to a four-game sweep of a young LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers . But he is no longer that guy, even though he\u2019s getting paid like it ($15.4 million this season). \u201cYou have to look at the big picture,\u201d Parker said. \u201cFor me, as a professional, that\u2019s what you have to do that, anyway. You have to rehab. They pay me a lot of money, and so that\u2019s part of it. I never saw it like that. My relationship with Pop goes deeper than that. He knows how hard I worked to come back, and R.C. (Buford, the Spurs\u2019 general manager), too. So that\u2019s why, for me, I just look at the big picture. I really believe that they will take care of me.\u201d Murray does not lack for confidence. But he was still surprised to get the keys to the car so quickly. \u201cIt just shows how much of a pro he is, how much he\u2019s willing to sacrifice for the team,\u201d Murray said of Parker last week. \u201c\u2026I just try to motivate him to keep going. I always tell him, out of everything you did \u2014 winning championships, all the points you scored, anything \u2014 the thing that surprised me and shocked me the most and made me respect him even more was when he got hurt last year. To see him in here every day, coming in on crutches, trying to get to running and shooting, he was dedicated to get back. He said he was going to get back to play again, and that was the best thing that I\u2019ve seen from him.\u201d Murray looks like a colt during his two-year-old campaign \u2014 not ready for the Derby, but all legs and arms, potential pouring from his pores. His length makes him a more than capable defender already. The 3-point shot is not not his strength at present as he\u2019s made just 4 of 18 (22.2 percent) of them this season. That has to improve. But, he\u2019s not afraid of anybody. \u201c1,000%,\u201d DMs Jamal Crawford, the Wolves\u2019 guard and Murray\u2019s mentor; he\u2019s been shepherding Murray since the latter was a high school star in Crawford\u2019s native Seattle. Crawford has stayed on Murray since he came to the L, too, telling him \u201cEvery night, consistency. Not getting too high, or too low. It\u2019s a long journey, keep enjoying the process.\u201d Murray inhales rebounds at his position and became the third player in league history to grab 13 boards in a game in which he didn\u2019t score a point \u2013 which he did last week in a 106-104 win vs. Denver . The other players to accomplish the feat: Dennis Rodman and Petur Gudmundsson. (Petur Gudmundsson?) His 5.3 rebounds per game are sixth in the league among point guards , per NBA.com\/Stats, behind Russell Westbrook, Ben Simmons, Lonzo Ball, Kyle Lowry and Chris Paul. Murray started eight games out of injury necessity last season, but wasn\u2019t ready. He started the first seven this season while Parker was still completing the rehab from the quad injury that ended his season in Game 2 of the 2017 Western Conference semifinals . But after Murray struggled with consistency and his shot in October and early November, Popovich started Patty Mills 11 games to try and get some offensive punch on the floor. Coming off the bench in November, Murray\u2019s offensive rating rose signficantly. And when Parker got back on the court, while the team was still managing his starter minutes, they placed Murray down the stretch in several games. But that was off-Broadway stuff. The Spurs always had plans for the day their 2016 first-rounder would be the guy. They decided not to wait any longer once they were able to see Parker play a month\u2019s worth of games. \u201cInternally, this probably hasn\u2019t been any different than it appears externally,\u201d Buford said. \u201dJust as Timmy allowed Pop to coach him, and Manu allowed us to present our team in the best way possible, Tony, the day the discussion took place with Pop, those were his sentiments \u2026 we couldn\u2019t have done this without the professionalism Tony displayed \u2014 and the mentorship he continues to show to Dejounte.\u201d At least Murray\u2019s had half a season to get ready. Parker became the permanent starter in 2001 in his fifth professional game. He started all but one game the rest of that year, including all 10 playoff games. \u201cI think the biggest thing is staying positive, because you\u2019re going to have your ups and downs,\u201d Parker said. \u201cNow, a lot of people are going to have a lot of expectations of him, and you know how hard Pop is. You know how he is. At the point guard position, it\u2019s not easy to play for him \u2026 \u201cI\u2019m just trying to be there for (Murray), you know \u2014 support, whatever questions he has, and using all my knowledge that I have. I think I know the system even better than Pop. I\u2019m just trying to help him as much as I can. It\u2019s not going to be an easy transition, because as we play better teams, and playoffs, you know how hard it is.\u201d This regular season hasn\u2019t exactly been a cakewalk for the Spurs. Their 34-21 record belies the incredible job they\u2019ve done patching together lineups and wins. With Kawhi Leonard having played just nine games as recovering from his own quad injury has proven much tougher than expected, and Rudy Gay (heel) out since just after Christmas , San Antonio has had to make do with almost no proven scoring on the floor around All-Star LaMarcus Aldridge for long stretches. Murray is just one of several young players \u2014 as well as Brandon Paul, Davis Bertans, Bryn Forbes and Derrick White \u2014 who\u2019ve all played meaningful minutes already this year. \u201cWe\u2019ve had to invent ourselves almost every night with a different lineup,\u201d Buford said. \u201cPop\u2019s not going to let us feel sorry for ourselves. And it creates great opportunities. Do Bryn Forbes, does Davis get these chances in other places, if the circumstances had been as linear? I don\u2019t know.\u201d The Spurs, though, despite being outstanding again defensively (first in the league in points allowed ; second in Defensive Rating ; seventh in opponent field goal percentage and opponent 3-point percentage ), aren\u2019t clicking on all cylinders. San Antonio has plummeted offensively, falling from first in 3-point percentage last season to 17th this season . Their 9-7 January was their worst month since December, 2014, when they went 8-10. They have missed Leonard terribly, and an ESPN story last month saying that the relationship between the team and its newest franchise player had cooled over disagreements about treatment plans and other issues was noteworthy not because of its content, but because someone was willing to publicly cite disagreement with how the franchise was operating. When the franchise makes mistakes, it\u2019s usually the one that acknowledges them, as Popovich did when he said that he was wrong to try and change Aldridge\u2019s offensive game his first season in San Antonio.  Buford said last week that the issue of Leonard\u2019s rehab is \u201cnot chilling; it\u2019s challenging. But no one\u2019s put more time into than our group, and Kawhi, and we\u2019ve put all the resources we can, internally and externally, to get him feeling confident enough to play.\u201d So, while they wait for Leonard, they must win games with their young guys taking on bigger roles \u2014 and with Parker coaching Murray on the intricacies of the position \u2014 the hardest, by far, in basketball. \u201cHe\u2019s a great kid, and he listens,\u201d Parker said. \u201cHe wants to get better. And he understands what it takes to get better. He\u2019s in the gym. He works hard. For me, that\u2019s good to see that he wants to be better.\u201d It means Murray is getting a real-time education in Popology \u2014 the screaming, followed by the arm around the shoulder, followed by the well-timed moment of inquiry and curiosity at practice, or a video session. \u201cPop don\u2019t play that,\u201d Murray said. \u201cIt\u2019s not BS. It\u2019s all stuff that makes sense. That\u2019s the big picture about it \u2014 everything he\u2019s talking about, everything he\u2019s yelling about, it all means something. It\u2019s the right thing.\u201d And it means Murray is around when Duncan and Matt Bonner returned to the gym last week so the Spurs could have enough bodies to run four on four in practice. \u201cIt just shows me their love for the game,\u201d Murray said. \u201cThey\u2019re retired. They could be running businesses and never coming to see a court again. They put so much work in. But just to see how much they love the game, and I look at it the same way. I really love the game. \u201cI don\u2019t do this because I like it or it\u2019s fun, or the stuff that comes with it. I love this. I want to be great. To see Tim come in here \u2014 he comes in here to lift; he comes in here to shoot; he comes in here to play. It\u2019s crazy. Seeing that stuff, it just shows that after basketball, it\u2019s going to be the same thing (for me). I want to be in the gym. You can\u2019t go away. It don\u2019t matter how much money you make, or how much money you got, if you love the game, you always find your way (to) playing the game.\u201d Speaking of which, Parker is still playing. In his first eight games in his new role, he\u2019s averaging 8.6 points in 18.9 minutes and shooting 45.6 percent. He badly wants to play 20 seasons in San Antonio before calling it a career. That would mean three more seasons after this one. He trusts the Spurs will get him there. So, he looks at the positives \u2014 a last chance to play next to Ginobili (\u201cI haven\u2019t played with Manu in five years,\u201d Parker said), and a chance to pay it forward. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy,\u201d he said. \u201cYou still have to digest and stuff like that. But, for me, I knew it was not going to last forever. I understand that the NBA is a young league. And I was the oldest starter (at point guard) the last three years. So I understand at some point, it\u2019s even better for my career to come off the bench. If, hopefully, Pop gives me my last three years, I can have great energy those last three years coming off the bench.\u201d There have been more fits and starts this season, maybe, than normal. The Spurs aren\u2019t championship material. But they\u2019re still 34-21, still capable of a push if Leonard comes back healthy at some point this season \u2014 in a perfect world, maybe after the All-Star break. They did throttle the Rockets in the 2017 playoffs and they were up 20 on the Warriors in Game 1 of the 2017 Western Conference finals when Leonard landed on Zaza Pachulia\u2019s foot . They have institutional memory, and they have grit, and now they have a new point guard to run the show until 2030 or so. \u201cWe\u2019re working,\u201d Murray said. \u201cWe\u2019re working every day. That\u2019s like, ooh, Tim Duncan to Manu to TP? All these banners, they did that. It\u2019s crazy. But at the same time, it\u2019s the next man up. And that\u2019s how I approach things: if I\u2019m the next man up, I\u2019ve got to be ready to go. Like I said, I\u2019m working every day, and I\u2019m showing them that I\u2019m here to learn and get better every day. That\u2019s all I can say. \u201cAs long as I stay healthy and (with) God\u2019s will, I\u2019m going to work my ass off. I\u2019m going to continue to study the game and learn and learn and learn. \u2019Cause as the point guard, you\u2019re the quarterback, you\u2019ve got to know everything. I want that. Some dudes shy away from it and are scared of this type of position. I\u2019m built for it. I fear nothing. I\u2019m going to continue to reach for everything I can.\u201d * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

The Detroit Pistons and LA Clippers, for different reasons, went out on a ledge last Monday, then jumped , taking the proverbial leap of faith that what they\u2019d just done would ultimately work out. But both, stuck in NBA limbo, are gambling \u2014 gambling the jobs of those who worked out the deal, gambling the futures of the players that remain on their respective teams after. The only person who was sitting pretty after it was all done was the centerpiece of the deal. * Aldridge:  Clippers deal Griffin after superstar unable to elevate team Blake Griffin will get the $140 million coming to him through 2022 regardless. Now it\u2019s just coming out of Pistons owner Tom Gores\u2019 pocket, rather than Steve Ballmer\u2019s. (And, Griffin will have to have some clothes sent to Detroit. Other than that \u2026 he\u2019s good.) But for the Pistons, who got Griffin, Willie Reed, Brice Johnson and a second-round pick last Monday from the Clippers for Tobias Harris, Avery Bradley, Boban Marjanovic and a 2018 first-round pick, the decision to bring in the extremely skilled yet oft-injured five-time All-Star, and to pick up his price tag, wasn\u2019t a hard one at all. \u201cHow many chances do you get to acquire elite level talent?,\u201d Pistons Coach and President of Basketball Operations Stan Van Gundy said Sunday via text. \u201cAnd how often would we be able to get that talent if there wasn\u2019t some risk involved?\u201d Griffin has been laid low by significant injury in each of the last three regular seasons , and couldn\u2019t finish either of the Clippers\u2019 last two postseasons. Injuries have also cost him All-Star and Olympic team appearances the last few years. In the NBA, there tend to be two types of guys when it comes to injuries: those that return from them in a few days, and those that return in a few weeks. Griffin has been the latter. It\u2019s not his fault, any more than it\u2019s someone\u2019s fault when they develop an allergy to something. You don\u2019t ask to break out in hives when you eat peanuts; Griffin isn\u2019t looking to get hurt. It just happens. But where were the Pistons going? They had lost eight straight just before they made the deal, falling out of the playoff race in the Eastern Conference. Their great start the first fortnight of the season had been long forgotten. Reggie Jackson, their starting point guard, was hurt again and out for a long time with an ankle sprain . Van Gundy reached the decision a couple of years ago that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to get free agents to sign with Detroit. So he brought Jackson in from Oklahoma City , Harris from Orlando and Marcus Morris from Phoenix . Griffin was a logical extension of that philosophy. * Trade Tracker:  Every deal in NBA this season If he\u2019d been a free agent in 2017 and it would have cost the Pistons Harris and Bradley to sign him, no one would have thought twice about it. He\u2019s a superstar, and the Pistons, as much as they try to promote All-Star Andre Drummond, don\u2019t have one. \u201cWe\u2019re serious about winning and we\u2019re not afraid to make a bold move and seize the opportunity,\u201d Gores said via e-mail Sunday night. \u201cChances like this don\u2019t come along very often. The move is not without risk and we gave up a lot to get him. We know that basketball is a game full of risk, but it was really clear that he is worth it.\u201d (They insist that they got Griffin for his talent alone, but the Pistons haven\u2019t drawn well at all in their first year in their new building, Little Caesars Arena, which they share with the NHL\u2019s Red Wings. Getting a high-flying, crowd-pleasing player like Griffin can\u2019t possibly hurt with ticket and sponsorship sales. Detroit drew announced crowds of 17,841 in Griffin\u2019s debut Thursday against the Memphis Grizzlies and 18,747 Saturday against the Miami Heat .) People throughout the league had indicated just after the New Year that the Clippers were making Griffin available in potential trade scenarios. But this specific deal didn\u2019t come to fruition until near the end of the month. And Gores didn\u2019t hesitate when the proposed deal was put on his table. \u201cDon\u2019t really want to get into internal discussions,\u201d Van Gundy said, \u201cbut it didn\u2019t take much selling. Tom was all for it.\u201d Said Gores: \u201cI was involved from the beginning of the discussions. Once we realized this was a real deal, that it was a real opportunity, I told our guys we should get it done. Keep our young guys, keep some flexibility, but get it done.\u201d The Clippers had sold Griffin that he\u2019d get his jersey retired in Staples Center someday, and that he\u2019d be a Clipper for life, when they got him to sign a five-year, $173 million deal in July . Yes, Chris Paul was gone, but the team was going to build again around Griffin, just as it had after making him the first pick of the 2009 Draft . That notion lasted about as long as Griffin did before spraining the MCL in his left knee just after Thanksgiving, costing him another month on the shelf. That injury, coming so soon into the season, \u201cscared the (bleep) out of Steve when it happened,\u201d one league source said. Suddenly, Ballmer\u2019s team wasn\u2019t as tied to Griffin as it purported to be in the summer. Those ties were coming loose even before Griffin\u2019s injury. Ballmer had hired Hall of Famer Jerry West from the Golden State Warriors in June as a consultant , and at a not-inconsiderable cost. You don\u2019t bring \u201cThe Logo\u201d in to say \u2018everything looks great here; carry on.\u2019 And, changes were made quickly. Doc Rivers lost his title as president of basketball operations last August, with Lawrence Frank taking over as the team\u2019s chief decision maker, and L.A. hiring highly regarded Michael Winger from Oklahoma City to further bolster the front office as general manager. The Clippers were heading toward a teardown anyway, and especially after suffering a rasher of injuries early in the season. They lost guard Patrick Beverley, who was supposed to take over for Paul at the point, for the season to a knee injury in November , and key acqusitions like forward Danilo Gallinari and Milos Teodosic have each missed weeks of action with various injuries. It left Los Angeles on the periphery of the playoff picture in the Western Conference, depending on G-League talents and players on two-way contracts to keep the Clippers afloat. So \u2026 why are we on the hook to Blake for 34 large for five years, again? By getting Griffin off the books, at least the Clips would be able to take a real shot at the likes of LeBron James, Kyrie Irving, Kevin Love and others who could be available in the summer of 2019. And that\u2019s the world where Jerry West, like Bumpy Johnson in the Cotton Club, likes to dance. \u201cLet\u2019s say the Clippers team would have made the playoffs,\u201d West told host Suzy Shuster on the \u201cNot Just Sports\u201d podcast last week . \u201cThere\u2019s no guarantee, because we\u2019ve had so many injuries, period. There was no guarantee, even with Blake here, that we were going to make the playoffs. But I think the one thing that I would say to you and to everyone is, would you rather this Clipper team, the way it was presently constructed, let\u2019s say play the Warriors (in the first round) and lose every game by 20, 25 points. That\u2019s what was going to be. I don\u2019t think anyone who\u2019s competitive, and cares about winning, wants that. No one. And certainly not, our fans don\u2019t.\u201d With Harris, just 25 and on a very good by today\u2019s standards deal, along with a healthy Gallinari, Teodosic and Austin Rivers, the Clippers expect to at least be competitive for the next year, whether or not they keep or re-sign DeAndre Jordan and Lou Williams, or trade them by Thursday\u2019s deadline. At least they hope so: \u201cfree agents don\u2019t want to join a (bleep) team,\u201d another source said. And, they expect the L.A. market to work for them in 2019. It worked for Griffin, on and off the court. But not well enough to keep him in town. The Pistons don\u2019t care. All they know is their game with the Clippers this Friday is suddenly on national television ( 7 ET, ESPN ). \u201cMore than a great basketball player, he\u2019s a natural leader,\u201d Gores e-mailed Sunday. \u201cI spent several hours with him after we finished the deal. He has great character, believes in hard work and competing to the highest standard. He\u2019s such a competitor, he wants to win, and you can see it in the way he plays.\u201d If Detroit was ebullient, the mood among Clippers folks as they heard the news last Monday was \u201cterrible,\u201d one source said. A team that had competed on the highest levels in the West for the last four seasons was suddenly back in the middle of the pack, betting on hope rather than what they actually had in the building. It was discomfiting. But it was reality. \u201cIn this business,\u201d West told Shuster, \u201cthe biggest risk takers do the best. Not the biggest gamblers. I don\u2019t think we took a gamble. Period. And I think we\u2019re gonna do just fine with what we have.\u201d * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

G-Money is no stopper, but he won\u2019t have to be in Boston; he\u2019s there to put the ball in the bucket as early and often as possible after taking off the warmup jacket. 3) Toronto Raptors (3-1) [3]: Philly native Kyle Lowry, after scoring 11 points in 26 minutes early Sunday afternoon in Toronto as the Raptors beat Memphis, nonetheless made it to Minneapolis in time for kickoff of Super Bowl LII Sunday evening, coming out of pocket for private transport. 4) Golden State Warriors (1-2) [1]: Kerr\u2019s right; these guys are bored out of their minds, and need the All-Star break bad. 5) San Antonio Spurs (1-2) [4]: Rodeo Trip callin\u2019: six straight away from Texas from Feb. 7 through 26, including the odd \u201clast game in Denver before the All-Star break\/first game in Denver after the All-Star break\u201d daily double. 6) Minnesota Timberwolves (2-2) [6]: Don\u2019t think there\u2019s a nascent Shabazz Muhammad (21.1 percent on 3-pointers; 41.8 percent on twos) market out there. 7) Washington Wizards (3-0) [12]: Tomas Satoransky, every bit of 6-foot-7 at the point in place of John Wall, is not throwing up on himself so far at either end of the floor in Wall\u2019s absence. 8) Milwaukee Bucks (3-1) [10]: For now, not looking to make a deal to replace Malcolm Brogdon. Still looking for a big, though, before trade deadline. 9) Oklahoma City Thunder (0-4) [7]: While I\u2019m sure the Thunder would love to get Avery Bradley from the Clippers to replace Andre Roberson , even as a rental, it\u2019s hard to see how OKC could make that work. One, the Clippers want first-round picks back in every potential deal, and because OKC has already committed its 2018 and 2020 first-round picks \u2014 and because the 2020 first has protections through 2022 \u2014 the Thunder doesn\u2019t have an available first to trade until 2024, due to the Stepien Rule. Two, the Clips don\u2019t want to take on salary that could hinder their pursuit of impact free agents in 2019, so it\u2019s unlikely to see them taking a chance that, say, Patrick Patterson would opt out of his 2019-20 season ($5.7 million). Doesn\u2019t make a Bradley deal to OKC impossible. But it makes it very hard. 10) Cleveland Cavaliers (1-2) [8]: Kevin Love just called a meeting with his teammates to yell at them for a change . 11) Indiana Pacers (3-1) [14]: Thaddeus Young coming on: 59.3 percent (51-86) from the floor during Pacers\u2019 recent 6-2 patch. 12) Miami Heat (1-3) [9]: I\u2019ll be shocked if the Heat doesn\u2019t make a deal before the deadline. I still think Tyreke Evans\/future second for Justise Winslow makes all kinds of sense for both Miami and Memphis. 13) New Orleans Pelicans (1-2) [11]: In the convoluted world of Pelicans\/Hornets\/Bobcats history and statistics, Anthony Davis is now the Pelicans\u2019 all-time leading scorer . 14) Portland Trail Blazers (2-2) [15]: Streak of 17 straight games scoring 100 or more points ended in last-second loss to Boston Sunday. 15) Philadelphia 76ers (1-3) [13]: No one in the City of Brotherly Love cares that the Sixers still need shooting this morning. * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

Dude graduated with a finance degree in three years with honors and a 3.8 overall GPA at Connecticut, where he led the Huskies to the national championship in 2004. (I know this acutely because during the evening the Huskies beat Duke in the national semifinals at the Final Four, my wife turned to me at some point in the second half and said \u2018we have to go to the hospital. It\u2019s time.\u2019 It took some time \u2014 maybe he wanted to see the end of the game \u2014 but our first born was delivered the morning of the national championship game between UConn and Georgia Tech.) All of this to say, Emeka Okafor is a smart guy who would get along just fine without basketball. Except, he can\u2019t. Which may explain why he\u2019s in New Orleans this morning with the Pelicans, on a 10-day contract signed Saturday , at 35, more than four years removed from the last time he played in the NBA, with the Wizards in the 2012-13 season. He played well in Washington, but a herniated disc in his neck, which was diagnosed before the Wizards sent him to Phoenix in October, 2013, for Marcin Gortat , kept Okafor \u2014 the second pick overall in the 2004 Draft, by Charlotte, after Orlando took Dwight Howard first \u2014 kept him from ever playing for the Suns, or anyone else. Rehabbing to get back on the court, the former Rookie of the Year winner Okafor paused to first get married (many of us who cover the league know his wife, Ilana, who did PR for the NBA for many years) and then have two beautiful kids. But his thoughts were always toward a return to playing. The problem was, out of sight, out of mind. As 2014 turned into 2015 and 2016, teams moved on, though the Cleveland Cavaliers, Golden State Warriors and Miami Heat all talked with him over the years . Finally, in 2017, Okafor was cleared to play, and signed a camp deal with the 76ers last fall . He didn\u2019t make it out of preseason, but he opted to continue his comeback with Philly\u2019s G League team in Delaware , the 87ers ( \u201cthe first time I heard he was gonna be my roommate, I was really shocked,\u201d said his Sevens teammate, Julian Jacobs, \u201c\u2018 cause when he got drafted, I was in, like, fourth grade \u201d).  Okafor played in 26 games for Delaware, averaging 6.8 points and 4.7 rebounds . The Pelicans came calling after losing DeMarcus Cousins for the season with an Achilles\u2019 tear a week ago. Nothing is guaranteed other than the next 10 days, which is a new place to be for a guy who\u2019s been a starter and made man almost all of his basketball career. But Okafor will take the leap. He\u2019s strong enough again now to handle the landing. Me: You have a beautiful wife whom we all love, and two beautiful kids, and I know you probably have the first dime you made playing pro ball. So, why? Why are you doing this? Emeka Okafor: You know, when I first got injured, the goal was to always come back. It never dawned on me that, hey, man, I\u2019m done, let me quit. When I\u2019m embarking on the rehab process, I didn\u2019t plan on it taking four years. I didn\u2019t plan on taking four years off. The whole time my mind was like, I gotta go back, I gotta go back, I gotta go back. I never lost that hunger to play and I still felt I could play. When it came finally time to actually get on the court, I tried out for some teams. Understandably so, they were like, hey, man, you\u2019ve been gone for four years. There were questions on whether I could do it, why I was doing it. Are you going to quit in the middle of it? So the G League was the option as a proving ground to demonstrate the want to and the capability to play. I was like, okay, I get it. If this is what the process dictates, I want to get back. And if this is the way back in, this is what I have to do. Long story short, the goal was always to come back and play. I wanted to play. I felt I could play. As an athlete, I think we all have this drive that just keeps us going. For me, I wasn\u2019t going to stop unless the situation forced me to stop. I just couldn\u2019t lay down and go \u2018okay, I\u2019m done.\u2019 I think I can go unless I\u2019m told otherwise, or forced otherwise. Me: You were pretty decent in camp for the Sixers. How disappointing was it you couldn\u2019t stick there, after all the work you\u2019d put in just to get back on the court? EO: This has been a learning process for me. To be fair, I thought that me getting back in would a little be easier than it was. I was like, okay, with my experience and what I\u2019ve done, I thought I would be at a minimum contract, that a team would take a chance. I didn\u2019t really, until I put myself in the eyes of a GM, in terms of being gone, and I saw all the work, I understood the business aspects and the risks associated, and the concerns associated with me getting back in. In understanding that, I understood the time frame of when my window of opportunity would actually be. Once I understood rosters and contracts and guaranteed dates, and when 10 days were able to start, and trade deadlines, there\u2019s just all these other aspects of the NBA that I didn\u2019t know about, because it didn\u2019t pertain to me during my career. Now, at this point, when I was trying to get back in and I saw all these workings, I was like, okay, this is a completely different animal than what I thought \u2026 especially since call-ups don\u2019t start until Jan. 5th or 10th, or whatever it was, and I understand from the point of a GM, hey, let\u2019s see if this guy even wants to do it, or if he can do it. I understood that no one\u2019s going to jump out immediately. I understood the lay of the land. I didn\u2019t really take it personally. Me: Besides the obvious opportunity, what was appealing about New Orleans to you? EO: I\u2019ve been here. The city\u2019s familiar, the GM\u2019s familiar, the staff\u2019s familiar, the arena\u2019s familiar. To be honest, my thought process was, just for the sake of being comfortable, if I could somehow land in a place where I\u2019ve already been, that would be pretty cool. The fact that that worked out is awesome. Me: You know the game and how the game has evolved since you\u2019ve been out, with every big being a stretch four or five now. How have you incorporated some of that into your game? EO: I\u2019ve been working on threes and dribbling skills. I haven\u2019t implemented the three yet. I\u2019m capable of doing it. But, to be fair, there\u2019s certain classics that never go out of style. Being able to screen and roll hard, play solid defense and rebound the basketball and finish around the rim, there\u2019s always gong to be a need for that, no matter what happens. I feel like that\u2019s my core value, to be able to do that extremely well. That\u2019s going to be able to fit somewhere and somehow, in whatever era you\u2019re going to be in. Especially in the pick and roll dominated game, you have to be able to set screens very well, and you have to roll. The ability to set screens, roll hard and finish at the rim, whether it be dunking or being able to finish with finesse, is what\u2019s going to open your shooters and your stretch fours and whatever else you\u2019re trying to set up. That aspect is still important. And being able to defend and rebound the basketball. Those have been my core values and I\u2019ve made sure that I\u2019m solid in that foundation. But I understand the way the game\u2019s gone. I\u2019m going to work on these other aspects and be able to use them when necessary. It\u2019s in my back pocket. If it\u2019s needed, I can pull it out and use it. Me: How do you plan when you\u2019re on a 10-day contract? EO: Literally, you can\u2019t. I was in Grand Rapids getting ready to play the Drive, and I got a call: hey, man, we need you on a plane in seven hours. Granted, the road trip I was on was only for one day, so I packed two or three pairs of socks, two pairs of underwear, a shirt or two, and that was it. That\u2019s what I have with me right now. And it\u2019s like, okay, now I\u2019m in New Orleans, and it\u2019s like, figure it out. New offensive scheme, new teammates, new whatever. Granted, it\u2019s the same city but it\u2019s like, bam. And coming from a place of guaranteed contracts, guaranteed playing time, I knew where I fit in. There was no volatility. To just, straight up, volatility, seat of your pants, figure it out as you go. No real compassion. Well, it\u2019s compassion, but it\u2019s like, the window of what you can do is like, all right, produce now. Right now. It\u2019s interesting. It\u2019s a different side. It\u2019s an adventure for me. I\u2019m enjoying it. It\u2019s giving me a well-rounded basketball experience and given me perspective and even more appreciation for the grind. But iit is different. You can\u2019t plan for it. JYour mindset, to be honest, is just stay ready. My whole thing is, be prepared for your opportunity, so when your opportunity presents itself, in whatever fashion, you\u2019re ready. Because you\u2019re not going to know what\u2019s going to happen . You have to be prepared to be prepared. Me: Did you have to have any conversations with your family about this, or did they just say, go? EO: Ilana, she\u2019s awesome. I\u2019m very fortunate to have her as my wife. Great mother. She wanted me to be back damn near more than I wanted to be back. Her dad was a ref (former Supervisor of Officials Ronnie Nunn), and she worked in the NBA. She knows the business. She knows what it is. There was no conversation necessary, \u2018cause she already knew the deal. It was like, all right, this is what we\u2019ve got to do. She was with me the whole rehab process. She understood the drive and what I was going for and why I was doing it. She understands how special a thing it is to be part of the NBA. If there\u2019s a chance, you want to be part of it as long as you can. It\u2019s a very special experience. It\u2019s everybody\u2019s dream to be there. If you have access to it, you just don\u2019t stop. You don\u2019t just lay down. You go until you can\u2019t. Me: You ever played for or on the same staff with Alvin? I know you weren\u2019t playing in Phoenix, but I didn\u2019t know if your time there overlapped. EO: No. Me: So what has he said to you about expectations and what he wants from you? EO: Ah, nothing. Literally, I haven\u2019t talked to him. There hasn\u2019t even been time. It might have been the 24-hour mark today. Right now, and even that\u2019s marked by plane time and travel and sleep. Right now, I\u2019m at the practice facility, getting ready to go over the plays. Me: I think a lot of guys want to go out on their own terms. I wonder how important that was to you: that no matter what happens, just getting back on an NBA court and being able to play allows you to say, at least, I made it back, and if it\u2019s this year or next year or whenever, if I leave, it won\u2019t be because of injury; it\u2019ll just be because it\u2019s time. EO: My thing is, go until you can\u2019t. Go until it just doesn\u2019t make sense anymore. I don\u2019t feel like that time has come. My injury happened, and I was like, no, I still can go. Work back and give it your all, and if it doesn\u2019t work out, hey, you tried. What are you going to do? It\u2019s sports; stuff happens. But until that moment, you just go until the horn stops. Me: What do you think you can provide to a team \u2014 and I don\u2019t mean the Xs and Os, skill sets part. I mean as a guy, as a person, as a teammate. EO: Just wealth of knowledge and experience. In terms of professionalism, how to be a basketball professional. I think I\u2019m very good at that. My thing is, I\u2019m always trying to, people have helped me out and taught me. I\u2019m trying to help and teach young guys. Whether it\u2019s basketball, life, or just any aspect. Letting them know, make sure you enjoy what\u2019s going on. Or giving them certain aspects of their game. Making sure that people grow, whether it\u2019s on the court or off the court, making sure they\u2019re aware of certain pitfalls that may or may not happen. You see the road. And younger guys, they don\u2019t see the big picture, see the road. They might get caught up in some obstacles that may not be as big as they perceive, or get caught up in stuff that\u2019s really, really not important. So just making sure that they know, this is what you need to worry about. This thing here is minor. This is the big picture. Me: Who were some of the guys that really helped you? EO: My rookie season, I had Brevin Knight. He was a good vet. And I had Steve Smith, also, my first year, he was a good vet. And the rest were actually very, very young teams. Bernie Bickerstaff, he was an awesome first coach. A lot of these lessons, you don\u2019t even realize at that time. You realize it later: oh, man, that\u2019s what they were talking about. Little conversations that happened between players on the court. In the offseason. I was in L.A. a lot and would play pickup. Just certain conversations you\u2019d hear, people just talking. At various points in your life you\u2019d reflect back and be like, okay, that\u2019s what they were talking about. When I talk to these guys, I know they may not understand now, but at some point they\u2019ll be like, \u2018okay, that\u2019s what Mek was talking about.\u2019 Because I\u2019m like that: \u2018okay, that\u2019s what Brevin was talking about. That\u2019s what Bernie was talking about.\u2019 And Nazr Muhammad was a good vet. Juwan Howard, he was a good vet. Me: I couldn\u2019t help but notice, if you parlay this into a second 10-day or for the rest of the season in New Orleans, on March 13, y\u2019all do play Charlotte. EO: I haven\u2019t even looked. Now is now. I\u2019m a planner. I like to have things organized and plan. This is very outside the way I operate, in terms of being sporadic and flying by the seat of your pants. I think it\u2019s good for me, because it makes me have to operate out of a different mindset. Literally, my thing is, this 10-day, now. That\u2019s it. Where are we now? Me: But if you are still there in March, you\u2019d get to play Dwight one more time. And that would be cool, right? EO: I\u2019ll cross that bridge when I hopefully get to it. \u201cI\u2019m lost for words, actually. Going 0-8 on national television. They should take us off every nationally televised game for the rest of the season.\u201d \u2014 LeBron James , after his Cavs were again mauled on ABC , this time by Houston, on Saturday. Since beating Boston on opening night on TNT, Cleveland has indeed lost its last eight games in front of the whole country: by four (at Houston, Nov. 9, TNT); by seven (at Golden State, on Christmas Day, ABC); by 34 (at Toronto, Jan. 11, TNT); by 10 (Golden State, on MLK Day, TNT); by 24 (Oklahoma City, Jan. 20, ABC); by 12 (at San Antonio, Jan. 23, TNT); by 11 (at Detroit, Tuesday, TNT) and by 32 (Houston, Saturday). \u201cI grew up as a kid thinking that the Patriots never win the Super Bowl \u2014 we could get there, but we don\u2019t win. And now my nephews, there view of it is entirely different. They think the Patriots should win it every year. That\u2019s a good way to grow up. But I know how special that is. And no one in that area should ever take it for granted.\u201d \u2014 Timberwolves coach Tom Thibodeau , a New Britain, Conn., native, on the emergence of the New England Patriots as the NFL\u2019s superpower. Thibodeau\u2019s friend Bill Belichick, the soon-to-be Hall of Fame coach, attended the Wolves-Bucks game in Minneapolis on Thursday before his team played the Eagles Sunday in Super Bowl LII. \u201cI hear about it every day.

From John Looney: One at a time, John: 1) True. The Spurs were listening on potential offers for LMA before the Draft. They didn\u2019t find anything close to what they wanted. The Cavs, I guess, did for Kyrie. 2) True. 3) True, but not to the point where they still couldn\u2019t have done a deal. More than half of the league would still have lined up to make a legit offer for someone as talented as Irving, no matter when he actually came available. 4) Not me. And Kyrie wouldn\u2019t have had any leverage to shoot down a trade with two years left on his deal, anyway. Why wouldn\u2019t the Suns, even if they knew Irving was just a short-term rental through 2020, pull the trigger? They\u2019d have two years to change his mind by building a good team around him, and if it didn\u2019t work out, they could have traded him in the summer of \u201918 or \u201919. I think the Cavs and Suns just couldn\u2019t come up with a deal that worked. The only reason Cleveland made the deal with Boston, IMHO, was the unprotected Brooklyn first. That\u2019s their LeBron insurance. 5) He\u2019s not really my cousin. Charge of the not-so-light brigade? From Alexis Corona-Aguilar: See above, Alexis. The Clips are holding out for that Brooklyn first. Now, L.A. now has a 2018 first coming from Detroit in the Blake Griffin deal , so its desire for another 2018 first may not be as great as it was before last week. But what else does Cleveland have that you\u2019d really want (Tristan Thompson, who would almost certainly be part of a Jordan deal in any iteration, aside)? The pressure on owner Dan Gilbert in Cleveland to jettison that pick to make a season\/franchise\/please-LeBron-don\u2019t-leave-saving move is going to be enormous in the next 72 hours. California Dreaming! From Milan Veissi: No, I don\u2019t. I expect them to move Lou Williams by Thursday, and maybe Jordan, too. And that won\u2019t leave them with enough, in my opinion, to make a postseason run past Denver and\/or Portland \u2014 who both have much more stable core groups, even if either makes a deal by Thursday.

(Last week\u2019s averages in parenthesis) 1) James Harden (34.7 ppg, 6 rpg, 10.3 apg, .515 FG, .962 FT): A 60-burger as part of a historic triple-double caps an incredible first half for the runaway MVP favorite. 2) Kevin Durant (27 ppg, 4 rpg, 5.3 apg, .630 FG, .850 FT): He does not concur with the posit that LeBron James could be entertaining notions of joining the merry band in the Bay next season . 3) LeBron James (18.7 ppg, 8.7 rpg, 7 apg, .392 FG, .706 FT): You wonder what James is thinking this morning. For the first time since very, very early in his career \u2014 maybe 2005 or so? \u2014 what he\u2019s selling isn\u2019t working. His team isn\u2019t buying in. It isn\u2019t building good habits. It is floundering. This hasn\u2019t happened to a LeBron James team, literally, for more than a decade. 4) Kyrie Irving (27 ppg, 3 rpg, 6 apg, .647 FG, 1.000 FT): Missed last three games (quad). 5) DeMar DeRozan (23.5 ppg, 3.3 rpg, 4.8 apg, .408 FG, .879 FT): After missing both of his 3-pointes Sunday, DeRozan remains just five makes short of his regular season record for 3-pointers in a season ( 64 in 2013-14 ). 30 \u2014 Teams, for the first time, that will participate in the MGM Resorts NBA Summer League 2018 .

No, the Wizards are not better without John Wall. No, Bradley Beal was not hinting they were by saying \u201ceverybody eats\u201d in the offense without Wall. Stop it. 7 \u2014 Minutes that Dirk Nowitzki needs tonight against the LA Clippers to become the sixth player in NBA history to reach 50,000 minutes played in his career. Nowitzki will join all-time leader Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (57,446), Karl Malone (54,852), Kevin Garnett (50,418), Jason Kidd (50,111) and Elvin Hayes (an even 50,000). 1) Fly, Eagles, Fly! And congratulations on out-dueling, out-toughing and out-playing a great champion in the Patriots to win Philadelphia\u2019s first Super Bowl title Sunday in Minneapolis. 2) One suspects John Wall, not likely to make any of the three All-NBA teams this season , or to win Kia MVP or Kia Defensive Player of the Year, is an extra crispy bucket of happy that he signed the Designated Player Extension with the Wizards last summer. 3 ) Andy Jasner\u2019s delightful compilation of stories and columns by his father, the great Phil Jasner, \u201cOn The Case,\u201d is available on Amazon , barnesandnoble.com and many area bookstores. Andy spent the last four years meticulously going through three decades of stories his late dad wrote for the Philly Daily News and other publications, from the Eagles to the Big 5 to his more than 30 years writing about the 76ers, including the \u201983 championship team, Iverson, the Dream Team, and on and on. Andy interviewed several Philly sports household names \u2014 Paul Westhead, Doug Collins, Billy Cunningham, Charles Barkley, AI and others \u2014 as part of new material that\u2019s in the book as well. Andy wrote the book\u2019s forward as well, detailing his memories of his dad and what having this collection means to him and his family. It costs $25. Here\u2019s the link . Buy it and enjoy reading a great writer who was on top of his game for 40 years. 4) Faith in humanity, restored . 5) A beautifully written story about two men, one once famous, who became friends in the most unlikely of ways \u2014 and what happened to the once-famous man . 1) One cannot possibly process the sorrow everyone in the league felt upon hearing that Rasual Butler and his wife, the singer Leah LaBelle , had both been killed in a car accident in California on Wednesday. Rasual was, genuinely, one of the nicest, most grounded guys I\u2019ve covered in 30 years on the beat. He had an athletic ego like anyone else in the NBA, but he became a consummate teammate everywhere he played \u2014 Miami and New Orleans and Toronto and Los Angeles and Indiana and Washington and San Antonio. Just a good, good dude. Thirty-eight is just too damned young. RIP, my man. 2) Will say this until they take the laptop away: fans in small markets need just as much reason to come out on cold winter nights to watch basketball as those in large markets. So if you understand why Detroit gambled on taking Blake Griffin to help fill up what has been an empty Little Caesars Arena, why would you not understand why Charlotte is compelled to hold onto Kemba Walker, even though the Hornets are likely not to make the playoffs and will be in a salary cap strait jacket next season? He\u2019s the only compelling player the Bugs have. He likes it there. He wants to be there. The challenge for management in any city is to improve the talent around the best player, not move the best player to buy a couple of years of security as you cry \u201cbut we\u2019re rebuiiding!\u201d 3) This is a good idea \u2026 why? 4) Thumbs up, Isaiah Canaan .

Antetokounmpo twisted his right ankle with about 7 1\/2 minutes remaining, not long after the Nets had cut what had been a 28-point deficit to seven. While the Bucks held on and eventually went on an 8-0 to put the game away, Antetokoumpo, who was standing along the baseline near the bench after coming out, trying to get loose in case he was called on to return. Ultimately the Bucks and interim coach Joe Prunty opted to keep him out of the game. As for Dellavedova, his injury came with 10 minutes, 41 seconds left in the game. He collided with Nets guard D\u2019Angelo Russell and the Nets\u2019 guard was called for blocking on the play. Matt Velazquez of The Journal Sentinel  has more on Dellavedova and Antetokounmpo\u2019s injuries : Ankle injuries have cropped up of late for Antetokoumpo. In Thursday\u2019s 108-89 loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves , Antetokoumpo suffered an injury to his left ankle in the final five minutes of the game as the Bucks were attempting a comeback of sorts. He came out of the game when the injury occurred and told reporters about his injury after the game. After that game, Antetokoumpo had trouble putting weight on it and had a bit of a limp. But he ended up playing in Friday\u2019s thrilling 92-90 win against the New York Knicks, scoring 29 points and nailing the game-winning bucket with 1.2 seconds left . The Milwaukee Bucks have been in a groove under interim coach Joe Prunty , logging wins in six of the seven games he has coached.

Sunday\u2019s performance against the Trail Blazers is a microcosm of Horford\u2019s versatility: He led the team in points (22), rebounds (10) and assists (five), and was a leader on defense as the Celtics rallied from a 16-point halftime deficit. \u201cMr. Do Everything\u201d capped his performance with the game-winning dagger, and the Celtics were victorious 97-96. DIFFICULTY: Horford\u2019s 2-pointer wasn\u2019t a long one (15 feet), but there was nothing easy about it. With four seconds left, Jaylen Brown gets the inbound pass on the right wing to Horford, who had sprinted across the lane to accept it. Draped by a tough defender, the Blazers\u2019 Al Farouq Aminu, Horford dribbles twice, leans his back into Aminu slightly, then steps away from the direction of the basket and elevates for the fadeaway. The turnaround shot bangs the lower back of the rim and flushes for the game-winner. GAME SITUATION: Sitting atop the Eastern Conference standings, the Celtics had battled back from a slow start against the Trial Blazers, a Western Conference team likely headed for the playoffs. But trailing by one point and with the possession, it was do-or-die for the Celtics. Boston\u2019s confidence in calling Horford\u2019s number \u2014 and the confidence he had shown in leading his team this day \u2014 was rewarded. Failure to finish after the comeback would have been deflating, even if this wasn\u2019t a conference matchup. CELEBRATION: It wasn\u2019t the seventh game of a playoff series and not much was at stake in this game, other than momentum.

Days later, he\u2019s still in disbelief For the second year in a row, Cleveland\u2019s forward will miss the All-Star Game \u2013 and a chunk of the season \u2013 with a significant injury. \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating,\u201d said Love, who could be sidelined two months. \u201cIt\u2019s not just All-Star, it\u2019s missing time. It just seems like (bad) luck, really. I don\u2019t know how to categorize it, I really don\u2019t. Injuries are injuries, but like a significant injury. It\u2019s just one of those unlucky (bad) luck kind of things.\u201d Love has watched replays of Tuesday\u2019s game in Detroit, but he still can\u2019t determine exactly the moment when he broke his hand in the first quarter. If there\u2019s any positive, it\u2019s that Love will not have to undergo surgery and he\u2019ll be able to do some ball handling drills and remain in decent shape. The medical staff\u2019s timeline means he\u2019ll return with two weeks left in the regular season. That\u2019s not a lot of time to get ready for the playoffs, but Love thinks it will be enough. In the meantime, he\u2019s trying to put the injury behind him. That\u2019s been difficult. \u201cI\u2019m down, still down,\u201d he said. \u201cI guess I\u2019m always looking for a silver lining or something that\u2019s going to keep my spirits up. I just look at it like it\u2019s my left hand, I didn\u2019t need surgery and I can still be here to support this team. I can still be around the team, I can still almost do everything besides go out there and play which obviously is what I want to be doing.\u201d \u201cI can stay in shape and keep my legs underneath me and be well-rested for the playoffs.\u201d The injury is a major blow to the Cavs, who have been struggling and need their top rebounder and second-leading scorer. Last season, Love missed 13 games after undergoing an arthroscopic procedure on his knee. He\u2019s now broken his left hand twice, and his right hand once. \u201cI should have drank more milk when I was little,\u201d he joked, trying to make light of his latest injury. \u201cI\u2019m not endorsed by chocolate milk any more, that was my first year here. I don\u2019t know. Honestly I think it\u2019s just, I don\u2019t know. I looked at that myself. I thought, my hands are a big part of the sport but this is the second time I\u2019ve broken my left hand. I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s crazy.\u201d The Cavs haven\u2019t played like a team capable of getting to the NBA Finals for the fourth straight time, but Love hasn\u2019t given up hope. Like Love, Cleveland has been down before. \u201cWe have so much time now,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not even at the All-Star break, to establish an identity. We have a track record of that in the past where it\u2019s taken us until really the last 4-to-6 weeks to the end of the season. We\u2019re hoping that\u2019s still the case with this team. Obviously there\u2019s a lot of moving parts. This is a good chance for a lot of guys to step up and play big minutes. \u201cNot just at my position but really throughout. I\u2019m excited to see what these guys are able to do. For me, I\u2019ll keep going out there and supporting them and try to stay in shape throughout this whole process. And that rhythm as the previous question you asked, I\u2019ll try to get it back in however many games I have.\u201d"},{"id":41927,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-shabazz-muhammad-wants-out-minnesota","date":"2018-02-04","title":"Report: Timberwolves guard Shabazz Muhammad wants out of Minnesota","content":"Minnesota Timberwolves reserve guard Shabazz Muhammad is reportedly seeking an exit from the team that selected him with the 14th overall pick in the 2013 NBA Draft .

The New York Post \u2018s Brian Lewis has the story :"},{"id":47721,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/milwaukee-bucks-jabari-parker-back-again","date":"2018-02-03","title":"Milwaukee Bucks forward Jabari Parker is finally back \u2013 again","content":" MILWAUKEE \u2013 From solo workouts in an empty gym to a standing ovation in a sold-out gym, from soulful drives around the city at night to satisfying drives to the basket Friday, Jabari Parker \u2013 finally \u2013 was back. Again. Three hundred and fifty-nine days had come and gone since Parker had participated in an NBA game for the Milwaukee Bucks, a stretch even longer than the first time he ruptured and rehabbed the same left anterior cruciate ligament in his same left knee. That one cost him 317 days, from the middle of December in his rookie season to the start of his second in 2015-16. Which means Parker has been hurt and hopeful more than he\u2019s been happy or helpful to a team that drafted him No. 2 overall in 2014 to play opposite Giannis Antetokounmpo on the Milwaukee front line. That\u2019s where they were against the New York Knicks at the BMO Harris Bradley Center, for much of Parker\u2019s 14 minutes and 48 seconds (the Bucks\u2019 medical staff had him limited to 15, max). It\u2019s a tandem that is going to have to click if Milwaukee hopes to reach its goals of a top-four finish in the Eastern Conference and, in the playoffs, advancing to the conference semifinals. If only the teamwork and chemistry would stop getting so significantly interrupted. Parker looked eager, bouncy and only a time or two tentative against the Knicks, subbing in for the first time at 5:25 of the opening quarter. The crowd of 18,717 welcomed him onto the court with their applause and Parker acknowledged them by scoring seven points. He hit his first shot, a jumper from the right baseline, then appeard to lack a little lift when he tried a reverse slam. When he broke out and took a long outlet pass from Khris Middleton, Parker had to slam on the brakes before finishing with a layup. The knee held. The crowd exhaled. \u201cI just wanted to stay composed,\u201d Parker said later, reviewing his night. \u201cNot trying to get carried away. Trying to stay right. Pretty much distracted, cuz I heard the crowd. I had to calm down and kind of teach myself like, you\u2019ve still got to play. You\u2019ve still got to show the people out there [what] you were working so hard [for].\u201d Parker\u2019s minutes leash dictated that he wasn\u2019t around when the game was decided. Tied at 90-90 from the 2:00 minute mark of the fourth, Antetokounmpo eventually put Milwaukee up with 1.9 seconds left with a spinning, long-armed, left-handed layup past Enes Kanter. Then the Bucks got Tim Hardaway Jr., who\u2019d shot 2 for 10 to that point, to miss one more from 30 feet. Parker watched the drama at the end of an otherwise grinding game from the side. But in time, assuming the knee repair holds, he will be on the floor for such moments, even in the middle of them. \u201cOnly way to go here is goin\u2019 up,\u201d he said after finishing with 12 points on 4-of-7 shooting. \u201cCan\u2019t be below any point that I\u2019ve been at any stages of these few months. Anything I do from this point on is to go up, and it\u2019s a blessing. \u2026 Any opportunity I get, it beats being on the couch for three months at a time.\u201d Parker has missed 144 of a possible 297 games with his injuries, either of which could have spelled ruin \u2013 or still could \u2013 for his budding career. He was playing at a near-All-Star level (20.1 ppg, 6.2 rpg, 36.5 3-point pg) when he got hurt, without contact, against Miami last Feb. 8. Facing another year of monotonous and grueling rehab work, far away from cheers, bright lights or competition with anyone but himself, Parker doubled down on the things that got him through his first comeback. Writing about it in a piece posted by The Players Tribune on Friday, Parker explained that his faith grew deeper, his anger buoyed him through much of his morning-and-evenings regimen, and the late-night drives in his \u201964 Cadillac Coupe De Ville kept him centered through the ordeal. \u201cIt went quick, because I got lost into the process I was having,\u201d Parker told NBA.com Friday. It did not go quick for the Bucks. In Parker\u2019s absence, they crammed in their second playoff appearance without him (he missed their first-round battles with Chicago in 2015 and Toronto last spring). They replaced the only coach he\u2019d known as a pro, Jason Kidd, with interim Joe Prunty. Antetokounmpo blew up as one of the NBA\u2019s hottest new stars. Eric Bledsoe arrived in trade as the team\u2019s new point guard. Meanwhile, Parker failed to negotiate a contract extension to stay with the Bucks. That gives him only a few months to fit back into the team\u2019s rotation, make a difference and demonstrate his value heading toward restricted free agency in July. To this point, the Bucks are 68-85 in the regular-season games Parker has played for them, 76-68 in the ones he has not. But there have been too many other moving pieces in Milwaukee in that time to rate him on record alone. What matters for Antetokounmpo, Prunty and the rest is how well the 6-foot-8, 246-pound Parker blends in and complements what the others are doing. As a wingman to the Greek Freak, Parker has a game better suited to pounding down low, while offering another shooter with decent range for Antetokounmpo\u2019s kick-outs. Defensively, he matched up against some of the bigger Knicks, including Kristaps Porzingis, Kanter and Michael Beasley. The Bucks were without guard Malcolm Brogdon, the 2017 Rookie of the Year who will miss six to eight weeks after suffering a partially torn left quadriceps tendon Thursday at Minnesota. Brogdon\u2019s exit just as Parker returns is cruelly reminiscent of last season, when Middleton came back from hamstring surgery in Game 51, the same night Parker went down. Handing off an injury baton is no way to prep for postseason success, but the Bucks feel they have sufficient time to set themselves up. \u201cThe potential is big,\u201d Antetokounmpo said. \u201cHe can be a top 15, top 20 player in this league, so just having a guy like that next to you [helps]. He\u2019s a big threat. Just having Jabari out there, the defense is going to pay attention to him. So when they pay attention to him, they pay less attention to me, to Khris, to Bledsoe.\u201d Said Middleton, \u201cI\u2019m proud of him. That\u2019s tough. To go through what he went through twice and come back and play like nothing\u2019s ever happened, that\u2019s great. I know there a lot going through his mind, but he did a great job of just going out there and playing basketball. \u201cIt is special. He\u2019s one of our best players. He\u2019s one of the key pieces who can take us farther than we\u2019ve been. So having that means putting smiles on everybody\u2019s faces.\u201d Whatever anxiety the Bucks have about the fragility of the tissue and grafts in Parker\u2019s repaired knee, that is balanced for the moment by their teammate\u2019s demeanor and perspective. Antetokounmpo said late Friday that they all have learned \u201cpatience\u201d from Parker\u2019s challenge, even as he\u2019s made peace with what\u2019s been and what shall be. As he noted in the Players\u2019 Tribune piece: \u201cWhat matters to me is not accolades or awards or headlines. That\u2019s just not where I\u2019m at. After injuries and rehabs, what matters to me is what I can control. What matters to me is going after what I love and then working as hard as I can to protect it.\u201d It matters to Milwaukee, that\u2019s for sure.

The place: the gymnasium in Vienna, Austria, where Rainer \u00d6mer and Martina Poeltl practiced and honed the skills that earned them roster spots on Austria\u2019s national volleyball men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams.  The child: Jakob Poeltl, dragged along, running loose, playing around and messing with sports equipment from whomever, wherever. Legend has it the energized 6-year-old one day picked up a bigger, heavier, pebble-grained orange ball he\u2019d found and, in that instant, began straying from his parents\u2019 sport. The result: Poeltl is a promising, second-year big man for the Toronto Raptors, the first Austrian to reach the NBA and a fellow for whom dunks have replaced spikes entirely. \u201cI was more in basketball,\u201d Poeltl said before a recent game in Chicago. The 22-year-old, now 7 feet and 248 pounds, pronounces his name \u201cYA-kub PURR-tuhl.\u201d \u201cI did play volleyball with my parents when we went on holidays. But it was never anything serious, it was always just fun. They taught me a lot \u2014 I think I\u2019m half-decent at volleyball. Obviously I couldn\u2019t play it at a very high level like they did, but I still know some stuff from back in the day that they showed me.\u201d  Still knows some stuff? That\u2019s intriguing as Poeltl continues to develop as an active, mobile center who backs up Jonas Valanciunas. Is it possible that any aspects of the family business transfer to NBA play, offensively or defensively? Besides the high fives, that is. \u201cA big chunk,\u201d Poeltl said. \u201cI got my height from them. I got my athletic ability probably, to a certain extent, from them too. Always, growing up, I was around sports. It was a very active family, I guess. I was always moving. They say I couldn\u2019t stop running around.\u201d That\u2019s a good start for a big man in today\u2019s NBA. There\u2019s more.  \u201cHis footwork is unbelievable,\u201d Raptors coach Dwane Casey said. \u201cThe athletic genes are there. Quick feet, great hands, good hand-eye coordination. And he picks up stuff so fast. I think it comes from being around that athletic background.\u201d Said teammate C.J. Miles, new to Toronto this season with an inside glimpse at Poeltl\u2019s development: \u201cHe\u2019s extremely mobile for his size. Great hands. His athleticism shows up on both ends, defensively and offensively. He\u2019s got a tremendous feel for the NBA. \u201cHis agility. His feet. He\u2019s got good bounce off the floor.\u201d Volleyball and the NBA have a pretty long history. Wilt Chamberlain, after wrapping his legendary hoops career, picked up the sport and played it well into his 40s. He played both beach and indoor versions and was quoted in his 1991 book, \u201cA View From Above,\u201d saying, \u201cFor a long time, volleyball became as big a part of my life as basketball once was.\u201d He even got involved in the mid-1970s with, and lent legitimacy to, the short-lived pro International Volleyball Association. Bill Walton, not surprising given his southern California roots and nature-loving way, played beach volleyball. So does his son, current Lakers coach Luke Walton. On a recent trip to Chicago, the younger Walton talked about how forgiving the sand is for an NBA player whose legs and bodies don\u2019t need any extra pounding. The Waltons honed their games with the help of Greg Lee, a UCLA teammate of Bill who became a renowned beach volleyball star . Vince Carter played both sports at Dayton Beach\u2019s Mainland High School, earning Conference Player of the Year status in 1994. Former NBA forward Chase Budinger was more of a standout at volleyball than basketball while at La Costa Canyon High in Carlsbad, Calif. During the 2011 lockout, Budinger joined his brother Duncan briefly on the pro beach tour. The offspring of numerous NBA figures, from Jermaine O\u2019Neal\u2019s daughter ( Asjia, committed to Texas ) to Houston coach Mike D\u2019Antoni\u2019s niece ( Bailey D\u2019Antoni, freshman at Marshall ), have snagged college volleyball scholarships. Another former NBA player, Jud Buechler, a member of Walton\u2019s staff, played volleyball in high school, then coached up his daughter, Reily, to a spot at UCLA .  Philadelphia\u2019s Joel Embiid was a 7-foot Cameroonian volleyball player before he got introduced to hoops shortly before an NBA Basketball Without Borders camp. And Portland coach Terry Stotts played high school volleyball in Guam when he attended high school there, his parents taking the family overseas in their jobs as teachers. \u201cVolleyball was a varsity sport, so I played volleyball for a couple years,\u201d Stotts said. \u201cThe things I would say transfer to basketball are the explosive jumping. Hand-eye coordination. Quick reflexes. Timing. Going to spike the ball is like going to get a rebound \u2014 you\u2019ve got to time your jump. Lateral quickness to the ball. So yeah, I would say there\u2019s some valid skills.\u201d So Stotts is OK if his rebounders occasionally tap out the ball rather than grabbing it. \u201cRobin Lopez used to do that for us on the offensive glass,\u201d the Blazers coach said, \u201cand we\u2019d get a lot of 3-pointers because of it.\u201d Said Poeltl: \u201cI actually do that a lot. I also find myself doing a lot of tip-ins. Maybe that has something to do with it.\u201d The 22-year-old\u2019s overall game has stepped up thanks largely to opportunity. Already, he has logged more minutes in 2017-18 than he did all of last season, his nightly shifts increasing by about 50 percent from 11.6 minutes to 17.8. His production has jumped accordingly \u2014 Poeltl is averaging 13.8 points and 9.5 rebounds per 36 minutes while shooting 63.7 percent . \u201cThe most important improvement I\u2019ve made was getting more comfortable on the court,\u201d said Poeltl, who is not afraid to challenge dunkers at the rim, regardless of the poster potential. \u201cJust gaining experience. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anything I specifically worked on in my game.  \u201cThe chemistry with my teammates, finishing around the rim, all of that, small things have helped me. Knowing opponents, for sure. Knowing my own game more and more. How my teammates play and how I have to play around them.\u201d Said Toronto forward Pascal Siakam, Poeltl\u2019s best friend on the team after arriving as rookies together last season: \u201cI know he looks awkward, but he\u2019s doing a great job of moving his feet.\u201d Poeltl is still carrying that flag as the first Austrian drafted into the NBA, realizing a dream few others in his country had when the Raptors used the No. 9 pick on him in 2016 . Austria had a spirited basketball faction through the 1950s, with qualifying for EuroBasket competition six times. But it dropped off after that, with little or nothing to show in international competition over the past five decades. Poeltl\u2019s journey, however, has begun to revive basketball interest in his homeland, and he\u2019s just getting started. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to do \u2014 be something of a role model for young basketball players in Austria,\u201d Poeltl said. \u201cI\u2019m really trying to make basketball more popular and get more kids to play. If I can have that kind of effect, that would be great.\u201d He is on the Austrian roster for the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup qualification (Europe), and participated in August in pre-qualifying games. Poeltl will remain strictly a one-sport participant, though, not crossing over to the one his parents played. \u201cThey know better,\u201d he said. \u201cI think [the national team organizers] have some better volleyball players than me.\u201d Volleyball\u2019s loss, the Raptors\u2019 and the NBA\u2019s gain. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

One thing that has been a bit disconcerting in 2017-18 has been the turnovers (5.3 average over the last six games and a career-worst 4.5 this season). 2. LaMarcus Aldridge (32), San Antonio Spurs Previous rank: 1a Last weeks\u2019 stats: 7 games, 19.4 ppg, 7.9 rpg, 2.1 apg Season stats: 22.3 ppg, 8.5 rpg, 1.9 apg It was a bit of an up-and-down stint for Aldridge, who went for 30 points in two games but was held to 16 or less in three games. Also, in three wins, the big man went for 25 points on 55.2 FG% compared to just 15.3 points and 39.4 FG% in four losses. Aldridge also hasn\u2019t pocketed a double-double since Jan. 21. 3. Dwight Howard (32), Charlotte Hornets Previous rank: 5 Last weeks\u2019 stats: 7 games, 18.6 ppg, 14.4 rpg, 1.4 apg Season stats: 16.0 ppg, 12.7 rpg, 1.4 apg What\u2019s been more impressive: Howard shooting 77 percent from the line over the last four games or eight straight games with 15 or more rebounds? Regardless of which one you choose, there\u2019s no mistaking the impressive play of Howard, who has also managed to block four or more shots in three of the last six. 4. Chris Paul (32), Houston Rockets Previous rank: 3 Last weeks\u2019 stats: 6 games, 21.0 ppg, 5.3 rpg, 5.3 apg Season stats: 19.1 ppg, 5.6 rpg, 8.4 apg Some hits and some misses sum up Paul\u2019s last two weeks. Two impressive performances (33 on Jan. 20 and 38 on Jan. 26), two average outings (16 on Jan. 22 and 17 on Jan. 28) and two clunkers (12 on Jan. 24 and 10 on Feb. 1) mean the point guard drops one spot. Another troubling sign: Paul hasn\u2019t had 10 or more assists since Jan. 10 (10 games). 5. Marc Gasol (32), Memphis Grizzlies Previous rank: 4 Last weeks\u2019 stats: 8 games, 15.8 ppg, 8.9 rpg, 3.6 apg Season stats: 18.0 ppg, 8.6 rpg, 3.9 apg Despite notching his first triple-double of the season, Gasol slips a spot. That\u2019s because all his performances (even the 13-12-10 triple-double) left something to be desired. In addition to just 41.1 FG%, the center went over 20 points just once (23 on Wednesday). He did finish the period with 19 and 14, but shot just 6-for-21. 6. Carmelo Anthony (33), Oklahoma City Thunder Previous rank: 6 Last weeks\u2019 stats: 7 games, 16.9 ppg, 6.1 rpg, 1.4 apg Season stats: 17.5 ppg, 5.9 rpg, 1.5 apg After three consecutive games with 20 or more points where he connected on 11 3s, Anthony has eclipsed the threshold just once in the last six while going just 8-for-35 (22.8 percent) from deep. And it looks like he\u2019s more comfortable on the road. In three home games, Anthony averaged 13 points on 35.9 FG%. In four road games: 19.8 points on 43.1 FG%. 7. Pau Gasol (37), San Antonio Spurs Previous rank: Just missed Last weeks\u2019 stats: 7 games, 13.1 ppg, 9.0 rpg, 3.4 apg Season stats: 10.8 ppg, 8.3 rpg, 3.3 apg Even if we brush aside Thursday\u2019s head-scratcher in which he shot just once in 20 minutes (he did manage six points and seven rebounds), it was a fairly productive two weeks for Gasol. In addition to shooting 52.5 from the field, he snatched two double-doubles, went for 14 or more points in five of seven and shot 78 percent (28-for-36) from the line. 8. Taj Gibson (32), Minnesota Timberwolves Previous rank: 8 Last weeks\u2019 stats: 8 games, 12.9 ppg, 6.0 rpg, 1.0 apg Season stats: 12.1 ppg, 7.4 rpg, 1.3 apg Before Thursday\u2019s nine-point showing against the Bucks, Gibson managed seven straight games with double-digit scoring. In fact, he\u2019s been held under 10 points in just three of his last 15 games. But if we dig deeper, he hasn\u2019t gone for 20 points in any of those games, with four games being 12 or less points. 9. Courtney Lee (32), New York Knicks Previous rank: NA Last weeks\u2019 stats: 7 games, 13.0 ppg, 3.1 rpg, 3.1 apg Season stats: 13.4 ppg, 3.3 rpg, 2.8 apg Lee did just enough at the start of the two-week period to climb back into the chase. The veteran guard went for 18, 16 and 20 in the first three games before stumbling, failing to eclipse 13 in the next four. He did, however, manage to connect on two or more 3-pointers in five of seven while averaging 1.4 steals. 10. Jamal Crawford (37), Minnesota Timberwolves Previous rank: NA Last weeks\u2019 stats: 6 games, 13.0 ppg, 1.7 rpg, 2.5 apg Season stats: 9.9 ppg, 1.2 rpg, 2.4 apg Despite averaging just 19.6 minutes, Crawford went for 16 or more points in three of six games while shooting 52.6 from the field. But outside the points, Crawford didn\u2019t do much else to fill the box score, going for five or more assists twice and three or more rebounds once. But it was enough to make the cut. Just missed the cut: Anthony Tolliver, J.J. Redick, Dwyane Wade Will turn 32 this season: Rajon Rondo (Feb. 22), Corey Brewer (March 5), Kyle Lowry (March 25), Marco Belinelli (March 25).

Now and forever.  James strongly denounced a report that said he would consider playing for the Warriors if the NBA champions were able to restructure their roster to accommodate the four-time league MVP. On Thursday, ESPN, citing anonymous league sources, reported James would meet with the Warriors this summer if they cleared the salary-cap space to sign him, assuming he will opt out of his contract with the Cleveland Cavaliers and become a free agent  \u201cIt\u2019s nonsense, and it\u2019s a non-story,\u201d James said Friday following the Cavaliers\u2019 practice. \u201cI think it\u2019s a discredit to what I\u2019m trying to do here. It\u2019s a discredit to my teammates and the coaching staff here. My only focus right now is trying to figure out how we can become a championship-caliber team in these next few months. It\u2019s been so many stories about me in the last few months, in the last few days, about where I\u2019m going and where I\u2019m at and what place I\u2019m in.  \u201cI\u2019m here, I\u2019m right here, I\u2019m right now and this is my present and this is where I\u2019m at.\u201d  James said he awoke Thursday to an alert and messages on his phone about the report and \u201cthe first thing I did I started laughing, actually.\u201d  The 14-time All-Star said he soon became upset, however, knowing the damage that kind of story can cause. James was most bothered by his teammates having to wonder about his commitment in getting the Cavs back to a fourth straight NBA Finals.  While others can speculate about James\u2019 future intentions and how any move might tarnish his legacy, he made it clear that no one speaks for him.  \u201cIf you don\u2019t hear something coming from my voice, then it\u2019s not true,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t give a damn how close they are, I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s my kids, or my wife or whatever. If it\u2019s not from me, it\u2019s not true. I just want you guys to know that my focus right now is on the Cavs and how we can get back to the Finals for a fourth straight year. That\u2019s my focus. And everything else is going to get talked about, but it\u2019s not a distraction. But like, I think it\u2019s just unfair to my teammates that come here every day. I mean, I can handle it myself. But it\u2019s unfair to those guys.\u201d  James often uses social media platforms to comment on stories or make statements. He didn\u2019t post anything on Twitter and Instagram on Thursday because he felt it was important for him to respond in person. \u201cYou know how real this is right now,\u201d he said. \u201cLike, this is my focus. Nothing else is stopping me from trying to get this team back to the Finals.\u201d The speculation about where he plans to continue playing after this season is only going to increase. James understands that, and while him joining forces with Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry and the other Warriors might make for entertaining sports talk radio, it\u2019s not grounded in any truth. James holds the Warriors\u2019 organization in high regard, but not to where he would ever consider being a part of it. The 33-year-old has said previously he would like to finish his career with Cleveland, the home state team he left previously as a free agent in 2010 for Miami. If he declines his $35.6 million contract option this summer, he\u2019ll be a free agent again but that would not preclude him from re-signing with the Cavs. That\u2019s months away and James is certain there will be other stories linking him to other teams. \u201cI know exactly how it works,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are 30 teams right now that at the end of the day probably want to sit down with me at the end of the season, right? Correct. It\u2019s so easy to make a story out of that.\u201d In the short term, James and the Cavs are dealing with the loss of All-Star forward Kevin Love for two months. Love broke his left hand on Tuesday, and while he won\u2019t need surgery, his eight-week recovery timetable means he won\u2019t be back until just before the playoffs. James is coming off a bad stretch \u2013 for him \u2013 in recent weeks. His statistics have dropped across the board, and he recently had a career-high 11 turnovers in one game while averaging 4.5 turnovers in January. \u201cI haven\u2019t had a great couple weeks, but the couple weeks I\u2019ve had would put guys in the All-Star Game,\u201d said James. \u201cI\u2019ll be all right. I\u2019ll get you better numbers, I promise you.\u201d"},{"id":41986,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-boston-celtics-reach-agreement-greg-monroe","date":"2018-02-02","title":"Reports: Boston Celtics to sign center Greg Monroe","content":" A day after formally being waived by the Phoenix Suns , big man Greg Monroe is on the move back to the Eastern Conference.

History tells us that wrapping up that race before the NFL crowns its Super Bowl champion doesn\u2019t add up. But if James Harden continues on his current path, leading the Houston Rockets on an impressive ride this season while doing things (a 60-point triple-double earlier this week) we\u2019ve never seen before, it\u2019ll be tough to deny him in the coveted pot of gold that comes at the end of the Kia Race to the MVP Ladder rainbow. That hardware has eluded him twice in the past three seasons. He was the runner-up to Stephen Curry in 2015 and again to Russell Westbrook last season , coming up short both times with seasons that were certainly worthy of a Kia MVP. There is no one having one of those kinds of transcendent seasons this time around, well \u2026 no one other than Harden. He leads the league in scoring (31.5 points per game) and ranks third in assists (9.1 apg) . He\u2019s putting on virtuoso performances night after night, making Hall of Famers swoon watching him work Mike D\u2019Antoni\u2019s system to perfection. \u201cAn incredible game from an incredible scorer,\u201d Isiah Thomas said on The Players Only broadcast after Harden\u2019s 60-point triple-double . \u201cHe really understands this Rockets offense, where everyone is at, where everybody is supposed to be, where he\u2019s going to get his shot, how he can create shots for everyone else. He makes plays. He\u2019s in such a relaxed rhythm out there. You don\u2019t see him playing fast, he\u2019s not rushing out there \u2026 Really, when you watch him play, it\u2019s like he\u2019s playing in slow motion out there.\u201d TNT\u2019s Inside the NBA crew have already proclaimed this season\u2019s Kia MVP Harden\u2019s to lose with 32 games remaining in the regular season. \u201cJames Harden right now is the clear-cut MVP,\u201d Shaquille O\u2019Neal said, a sentiment Charles Barkley immediately agreed with on Thursday night. Harden\u2019s work this week alone, could serve as the ideal snapshot of what makes his MVP case this season. He finished two assists shy of a triple-double after scoring 27 points and grabbing 10 rebounds in Sunday\u2019s home win over the Phoenix Suns . He shredded the Orlando Magic Tuesday at Toyota Center with a historic 60-point, 11-assist, 10-rebound triple-double , snapping Calvin Murphy\u2019s 40-year-old, single-game scoring mark in the process. * Five amazing stats to know from Harden\u2019s 60-point triple-double game He delivered a brilliant encore performance with 28 points, 11 assists and two blocks in Thursday\u2019s win over the Spurs in San Antonio on TNT. The Rockets, at 37-13, are tied with the 1993-94 championship team for the best 50-game start in franchise history . And Harden has a date with four-time Kia MVP winner LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers Saturday night at Quicken Loans Arena ( 8:30 ET, ABC ). It is a prime-time opportunity for Harden to stamp his MVP case \u2026 and do so months ahead of the actual finish line. \u201cThis is probably the biggest part of our season right here,\u201d Harden told TNT\u2019s David Aldridge after the win over the Spurs, when asked how crucial this stretch before All-Star weekend is for the Rockets. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of injuries, guys in and out of the lineup, so we\u2019ve got put these wins together. I think we\u2019ve got six or seven more games to go into All-Star with some confidence and our swagger and then carry it over after the break as well.\u201d Do that and it will be difficult for someone to keep Harden from carrying that Kia MVP hardware away with him at the end of this season. * * * The top five in the Week 16edition of the 2017-18 Kia Race to the MVP Ladder: * * * Last week\u2019s ranking:  No. 1 Season stats:  31.5 points, 9.1 assists, 5.0 rebounds Harden\u2019s 60-point triple-double , the first in NBA history, in Tuesday\u2019s win against the Orlando Magic was a statement game that will be hard to top this season. And that goes for Harden, too. He broke Calvin Murphy\u2019s franchise single-game scoring record that stood for 40 years. Harden has nine games of 50 or more points in his Rockets tenure, one more than every other player in franchise history has combined for. His four 50-point games this season is as many as the rest of the league has combined . The Rockets needed every point, rebound and assist of Harden\u2019s historic performance to slip by the Magic without Chris Paul available. Not only does Harden lead the league in scoring this season , he\u2019s also top three in assists and has the Rockets firmly entrenched in the fight for the No. 1 spot in the Western Conference playoff chase. And, he has already led the Rockets to a 2-1 season-series win against the top-seeded Warriors. Last week\u2019s ranking:  No. 4 Season stats:  27.7 points, 6.5 assists, 5.1 rebounds Curry, not Harden, earned the league\u2019s Western Conference Player of the Month award for January . He finished the month with an decidedly un-Steph-like performance ( 14 points on 4-for-13 shooting in a blowout loss to the Utah Jazz ), proof that even a two-time former Kia MVP can have off nights. That one game doesn\u2019t erase the monster work he did during the Warriors\u2019 11-3 run through the first month of 2018. Curry averaged 29.5 points (on 51.4 percent shooting and 46.3 percent 3-point shooting), 6.7 assists and 5.1 rebounds per game. He scored 30 or more points six times and drained a league-best 62 3-pointers and had eight games with five or more 3-pointers. He was a two-time Western Conference Player of the Week and cranked up the debate, internally and beyond, as to whether he\u2019s the real MVP of the Warriors \u2014 and perhaps the NBA. Last week\u2019s ranking:  No. 5 Season stats:  26.6 points, 8.7 assists, 7.9 rebounds Losing Kevin Love , in the midst of all the drama the Cavaliers have going on as next week\u2019s trade deadline nears, plays right into the script for this tumultuous season for LeBron and his crew. But the buzz surrounding the reports that LeBron would entertain overtures from the Golden State Warriors during free agency is over the top \u2014 and a dreadful thought for the rest of the league. All of this serves as the ideal camouflage for the turnaround you know LeBron is plotting right now. A modest stretch that saw the Cavaliers win two of their past three games heading into Saturday night\u2019s home showdown against James Harden and the Houston Rockets won\u2019t instill the sort of hope Cavaliers fans are looking for. But as the pressure to maintain a top-four position in the Eastern Conference playoff chase increases, so does the workload for and production from LeBron (24.8 points, 8.8 rebounds, 8.8 assists, 1.2 steals in his past five games). Last week\u2019s ranking:  No. 2 Season stats:  25.6 points, 6.9 rebounds, 5.6 assists Stephen Curry wasn\u2019t the only player from the Warriors worthy of Western Conference Player of the Month candidacy. Durant was impactful in his own ways, rolling on both ends of the floor for a team the claims four All-Stars in consecutive seasons for the first time in NBA history. His January numbers ( 24.7 points, 6.6 rebounds, 6.5 assists and 1.8 blocks per game ) more than stand out. Like the rest of the Warriors not named Klay Thompson, Durant had a rough night in a 129-99 loss to the Utah Jazz, scoring 17 points on 5-for-13 shooting . Warriors coach Steve Kerr didn\u2019t hold back in his verbal smack down of his team, which means Durant and the Warriors will be on alert tonight in Sacramento ( 10:30 ET, ESPN ) when they take on the Kings. After back-to-back tough outings (by Durant\u2019s standards) against two of the league\u2019s better defensive teams (Boston and Utah), the Kings might be just what he needs. Last week\u2019s ranking:  No. 7 Season stats:  24.4 points, 5.2 assists, 4.1 rebounds DeRozan\u2019s stellar work last month ( 25.3 points, 5.9 assists, 3.7 rebounds and 1.1 steals per game ) earned him Eastern Conference Player of the Month honors and a nice bump here. The Raptors went 10-5 and clawed to within a game and a half of the Boston Celtics for the top spot in the Eastern Conference standings. Included in DeRozan\u2019s monster month was that franchise-record 52 points he dropped on the Milwaukee Bucks in that overtime win on New Year\u2019s Day that set the tone for DeRozan\u2019s 2018 stretch of the season. Now comes the real grind. Toronto has a prime opportunity at hand with three-time East champion Cleveland looking vulnerable and Boston having a one-game cushion on Toronto in the standings. But DeRozan and the Raptors must find ways to win games like the one they dropped Thursday against the Washington Wizards , a team playing without All-Star John Wall. 6. Kyrie Irving, Boston Celtics 7. Russell Westbrook, Oklahoma City Thunder 8. Jimmy Butler, Minnesota Timberwolves 9. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks 10. LaMarcus Aldridge, San Antonio Spurs And five more \u2026: Bradley Beal, Washington Wizards; Anthony Davis, New Orleans Pelicans; Joel Embiid, Philadelphia 76ers; Nikola Jokic, Denver Nuggets; Damian Lillard, Portland Trail Blazers An inside look at Nikola Mirotic from a Western Conference advance scout: \u201cThis is a great pick up for the Pelicans. With DeMarcus Cousins done for the season, the Pelicans are in desperate need of a big to play off of Anthony Davis. He\u2019s by no means in the same class as Boogie, not even close. But for what [Pelicans coach] Alvin [Gentry] likes to do, the way he likes to play, he\u2019s the ideal fit. He\u2019s a big who can stretch floor and keep defenses from sagging on AD. He\u2019s not physically built to operate the way Boogie did, but he\u2019s a more natural deep shooter and he\u2019s a better athlete than you think. He\u2019ll have some work to do in terms of being more active and physical on the defensive end and making sure he pays attention to the added duties he\u2019ll have to help rebound with a smaller lineup on the floor. \u201cThe skill set is there, always has been. The mystery with him has been the mental side. He didn\u2019t make a smooth transition to the league and then there came the questions about whether or not his heart was really in it, being in our league. Give him credit, he put in the work during this past offseason and was ready to come back and go at it, and then the incident with he and Bobby Portis happens and he gets buried in the avalanche of foolishness that came with it. He needed this move, the fresh start that comes with it and the opportunity to play off of a great player like AD. If he does it right, he\u2019ll be a more dangerous version of what Ryan Anderson was when he played with AD. \u201cMirotic is more than just a shooter. He\u2019s more dynamic than that and we didn\u2019t really get a chance to see that until this season. If he can produce the same way for the Pelicans as he did for the Bulls, he could potentially be a season-saving pick up for those guys. He really could. Because the loss of Boogie, without a move like this to try to do something about it, would have buried those guys eventually. Now if they can find a way to get Greg Monroe as well, then you can plug him in as your starting center and really do some different things with your lineup and with Mirotic. He becomes a much more dangerous piece to use if you don\u2019t have to worry about him playing out of his comfort zone.\u201d * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

The memories from those title runs are forever the Rockets, but the actual hardware they won \u2014 the Larry O\u2019Brien Trophy \u2014 are in the possession of the man who owned the team back then. Leslie Alexander sold the Rockets for $2.2 billion to Houston businessman Tilman Fertitta early last fall , ending Alexander\u2019s 24-year stint as owner of the team. Houston claimed the 1993-94 NBA title after an epic season in which it won a franchise-record 58 games and topped the New York Knicks in Game 7 of The Finals. In 1994-95 , the Rockets became the first team to defeat four 50-win teams (Utah Jazz, Phoenix Suns, San Antonio Spurs and Orlando Magic) en route to sweeping the Magic in The Finals . Both of those championship runs came after Alexander bought the team in July of 1993. In an interview with David Barron of the Houston Chronicle , Alexander says he has the Rockets\u2019 two championship trophies at his house in Florida. His retaining of the trophies is permitted by the NBA : According to the Houston Chronicle , a Rockets spokesman says the team is in the process of ordering replica NBA trophies. Those trophies, once procured, will be displayed where the former trophies were \u2014 in the team\u2019s offices at Toyota Center and also at special events for Rockets season-ticket holders. Per the newspaper, Feritta did not comment on Alexander\u2019s decision to take the title trophies but said he would be interested in a public display of the replicas. * * * * * *"},{"id":47593,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/cleveland-cavaliers-kevin-love-no-surgery-hand-out-eight-weeks","date":"2018-02-02","title":"Kevin Love (hand) doesn't need surgery, is expected to miss 8 weeks","content":"Kevin Love  continued the examination and consultation process related to the non-displaced fracture of his left hand fifth metacarpal in New York City yesterday at the Hospital for Special Surgery.

Then we give it an overall grade on a scale of 1-5 Robert Horrys, named for the patron saint of last-second answered prayers. * * * Two teams currently in the Western Conference\u2019s playoff field provided one of the best finishes of the season on Thursday night. Coming off two heartbreaking losses that went down to the wire this week, the Denver Nuggets cruised for majority of the contest and even boasted a 20-point lead in the first half. That was before the Oklahoma City Thunder climbed back in the fourth quarter, led by Paul George and Russell Westbrook. In the end, however, the final hero would be Gary Harris, who delivered the clutch jumper at the buzzer to rescue Denver from another tough loss. DIFFICULTY: While 1.4 seconds seems like a short window to execute a play, in reality, that\u2019s an eternity. The Nuggets had plenty of time to get a shot off coming out of a timeout \u2014 the problem would be how clean of a look they would get. Without much difficulty, that problem was solved when Westbrook, who, as Nikola Jokic put it after the game, \u201cfell asleep\u201d on the final possession that left Harris with a wide-open look. GAME SITUATION: The Nuggets led 104-89 at the start of the fourth quarter. The lead began to dwindle as the frame went on and it was completely squandered when George pulled up for a huge step-back 3 that gave the All-Star 43 points and knotted things up for the first time since tipoff. Jokic, the team\u2019s best passer, was left to inbound the ball with 1.4 left and delivered a strike to the opposite wing. Harris came through with the cold-blooded trey. CELEBRATION: After seeing Westbrook and OKC display a classic celebration on the exact same court last season , it was exhilarating to see Harris and his teammates on the victorious side of a classic Northwest Division finish.

Star forward Giannis Antetokounmpo and guard Malcolm Brogdon both suffered injuries in the course of the loss that have the Bucks wondering how they will fare going forward. For Brogdon, the reigning Kia Rookie of the Year, he exited last night\u2019s game with a left quadriceps strain suffered in the second quarter. He appeared to suffer the injury while going up for a non-contact, breakaway layup.

Thon Maker committed a foul on the possession to stop play so Brogdon could be tended to.

This is his second Verizon Slam Dunk appearance, having finished second to Zach LaVine in 2015.

The trade, announced by both teams late Thursday afternoon, comes less than a week after New Orleans lost All-Star DeMarcus Cousins for the season because of a left Achilles tear \u2013 and with the Pelicans still in the playoff picture. Mirotic has averaged 16.8 points and 6.4 rebounds since missing the first 23 games this season because of two broken bones in his face stemming from a fight in practice with Bobby Portis. The altercation soured Mirotic on playing for Chicago, and the Bulls were looking to accommodate his request to be traded. \u201cNiko\u2019s representatives were consistent over the last several months that they wanted him moved,\u201d said John Paxson, the Bulls\u2019 executive vice president of basketball operations. \u201cThey never backed off of that stance one bit.\u201d Nelson has averaged 5.1 points and 3.6 assists in 43 games for New Orleans. Allen averaged 4.7 points before a broken leg sidelined him for 22 games. He returned to the active roster this week but did not play in Tuesday night\u2019s loss to Sacramento. Asik has averaged 1.3 points and 2.6 rebounds in 14 games this season. Paxson said acquiring another first-round draft choice fits the plan of retooling the roster that was put in motion when Chicago traded Jimmy Butler to Minnesota. \u201cThe draft asset that we acquired in this deal was far and away the best that we got. It\u2019s just consistent with the direction, the plan that talked about,\u201d Paxson said. \u201cAs we mapped out what Niko would be looking for financially, especially, that wasn\u2019t part of our timeline. We now have a situation where we\u2019re invested in these young guys. Our focus remains on the growth and development of them.\u201d New Orleans had been seeking to unload the 7-foot Asik, who has struggled with his health and has been unable to return to his form from earlier in his career since the Pelicans signed him to a five-year, $58 million contract that would expire after next season if a team option is not picked up. Mirotic is due $12.5 million next season, but that becomes easier for the Pelicans to absorb now that Asik is off their books. He was due about $12 million next season. Still, financial flexibility remains important for New Orleans. Cousins enters free agency this offseason, and the Pelicans hope to re-sign him. The Pelicans won seven of the last eight games that Cousins played alongside fellow All-Star starter Anthony Davis. Two of those victories came against teams with the second- and third-best records in the NBA \u2013 the Houston Rockets and Boston Celtics. Since Cousins\u2019 injury, New Orleans has dropped two straight. New Orleans plays next at Oklahoma City on Friday night. As part of Thursday\u2019s trade, Chicago will have the right to swap its 2021 second-round pick with New Orleans\u2019 own 2021 second-round pick. In a corresponding roster move, the Bulls waived veteran wing player Quincy Pondexter, a former Pelicans player who has struggled with knee injuries for most of the past three seasons."},{"id":42020,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/february-schedule-breakdown-tough-test-denver-nuggets","date":"2018-02-01","title":"February schedule breakdown: Denver Nuggets face tough test in fight for playoff spot","content":" The Denver Nuggets seem to be a big beneficiary of the Blake Griffin trade this week . At the time of the deal, the LA Clippers were just one game behind the Nuggets for the final playoff spot in the West. And if the Clippers were going to fade after trading their best player, the Nuggets\u2019 chances of ending a four-year playoff drought were going to increase dramatically. But the Clips are still hanging around , the Nuggets still have some work to do, and the work will be tough in February. Denver has one of the league\u2019s toughest February schedules, with seven of their 10 games against teams that are currently at or above .500. That includes six games against the Warriors, Rockets (x 2), Spurs (x 2) and Thunder. Denver has the league\u2019s toughest February schedule in regard to both opposing offenses and opposing defenses. Through January, the Nuggets are 8-16 against the other 15 teams that are currently at or above .500, having allowed more than 110 points per 100 possessions over those 24 games. Ten of those 16 losses (including two to Boston and San Antonio in the last three days) were games that were within five points in the last five minutes, though. And there is good news with the Nuggets\u2019 February schedule . Seven of their 10 games are at home, where they\u2019re 19-7 (6-5 against other teams that are currently at or above .500) and where they\u2019ve been 10.9 possessions better than they\u2019ve been on the road . Only Utah (13.4) and New York (11.9) have bigger home-road NetRtg differentials. The Nuggets also have just one February back-to-back, and the second game is in Phoenix. They have three games this month with a rest advantage (where their opponent played the night before but they did not). The Utah Jazz, coming off wins over Toronto and Golden State, could be Denver\u2019s biggest threat in regard to that last playoff spot. The Nuggets and Jazz have already finished their season series, with each team winning its two home games. But if the Clippers are still hanging around in a few weeks, the Nuggets\u2019 most important February game could be their last, when they host LA on Feb. 27. Note: Every team has at least seven full days off for the All-Star break. Two teams \u2013 Dallas and San Antonio \u2013 have the longest All-Star breaks: nine days off between games. Rest advantage \/ Rest disadvantage: Games in which one team (at a disadvantage) played the day before and the other (at an advantage) did not. Teams are currently 120-82 (.594) with a rest advantage, 98-49 (.667) at home and 22-33 (.400) on the road. Here\u2019s a breakdown of every Western Conference team\u2019s February schedule\u2026 More Western Conference notes\u2026 The Washington Wizards have not lived up to expectations this season, unable build off a trip to Game 7 of the conference semifinals last May. They\u2019re in fifth place in the East, but their bad losses (11 to teams that are currently at least six games under .500) have overshadowed their quality wins (they\u2019re 5-5 against teams with the league\u2019s eight best records). Now, the Wizards are dealing with an extended absence for John Wall, who had knee surgery on Wednesday . Things could certainly come together for the Wizards if Wall returns healthier and stronger in April and May (they won\u2019t have to play the Nets or Mavs in the playoffs), but as they look to stay in the mix for a top four seed in the East, they\u2019ll have a difficult schedule to navigate without one of their All-Stars. Seven of the Wizards\u2019 12 February games are against the other seven teams in playoff position in the East. That includes four games against the three teams \u2013 Indiana, Milwaukee and Philadelphia (x 2) \u2013 behind them and within two games in the loss column in the standings. Three of the Wizards\u2019 other five games are on the road. And they\u2019ll finish the month of February by hosting the Warriors on the second night of a road-home back-to-back (with the Warriors not playing the day before). But it doesn\u2019t end there. That Golden State game will be only the second game of 12 straight against teams that are currently over .500. The Wizards\u2019 March might be tougher than their February, and just staying in playoff position at all could be a challenge.

Once that \u201cinterim\u201d light flashes on, with the plane still 35,000 feet up but adrift, a team might as well be plucking its pilot \u201cAirplane!\u201d-style from the main cabin .

Your good teams don\u2019t usually make these changes. \u201cThe trick is having good players. Knowing Joe and the way he is, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll tell you the same thing.\u201d The Bucks were 23-22 on Jan. 22 when management fired Kidd, the soon-to-be Hall of Fame point guard who had coached the team since 2014. Kidd met the early expectations of new franchise ownership by steering the Bucks to the playoffs in two of his first three seasons. But his overall record was 139-152, and 2017-18 was playing out fitfully, with no momentum, no traction. When Kidd tried to tamp down expectations after a dreary post-Christmas performance against Chicago, this season no longer just seemed like \u2014 it sounded like \u2014 a lost opportunity. \u201cIt just felt like we were standing still when we should be climbing,\u201d Milwaukee\u2019s first-year general manager, Jon Horst, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel . \u201cThis is an important year.\u201d No kidding. Milwaukee is a franchise aiming at big things . A massive new arena to replace the BMO Harris Bradley Center needs to be filled come fall. The team\u2019s tri-owners \u2014 Marc Lasry, Wes Edens and Jamie Dinan, all private-equity movers and shakers \u2014 rejected from the start former Bucks steward Herb Kohl\u2019s smaller-market mission of simply keeping the team competitive from year to year. The new guys want championships. This season was targeted as a step toward that, with Milwaukee seeking a top-four playoff seed and advancement to the conference semifinals. Those were important goals for external and internal reasons. Giannis Antetokounmpo, 23, the team\u2019s most talented player, is on the cusp of NBA superstardom and is under contract only through the 2020-21 season. Jabari Parker, if he comes back successfully from his second knee surgery in three seasons (he\u2019s set to play 15 minutes against New York Friday ), will be a restricted free agent this summer. And keeping a young, talented core together is tough enough, never mind adding pieces in a city not considered much of a free-agent destination. * Blogtable:  Can Bucks make push for No. 3 in East? Prunty\u2019s new job is far more focused than that and, so far, so good: the Bucks were 4-0 through his first eight days as Kidd\u2019s replacement, with back-to-back games at Minnesota tonight ( 8 ET, NBA League Pass ) and Friday vs. New York ( 8 ET, NBA League Pass ). At that pace, they\u2019d run the table, finish with a tidy 60-22 mark, be sitting right where they want to be in the standings and have the rest of the East scared to death. Now in his 22nd NBA season, Prunty, 48, isn\u2019t going anywhere near that sort of nonsense. He\u2019s fine as a plugger, thank you, with a strict see-the-game, play-the-game approach. If he comes up with any Dalyesque analogies, it will be by accident \u2014 or he\u2019ll be quoting someone he\u2019s worked with, like San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich, former Mavs and Nets coach Avery Johnson, former Cleveland Cavaliers coach Byron Scott or Indiana Pacers coach Nate McMillan (Prunty was on his staff in Portland) or Kidd. \u201cThe teams that win in this league are the teams that win in this league,\u201d said Prunty, a native Californian who coached Lakers coach Luke Walton and former Chicago Cubs pitcher Mark Prior in high school. \u201cYou will have success based on what everybody does to contribute to that. \u2026 It is about getting better day over day. It always sounds boring and like a clich\u00e9, but it is the truth.\u201d \u201cInterim\u201d is a tricky position. Too much old or too much new could be bad. Whatever the previous guy was doing, that got him fired, so don\u2019t do that. But if you try to change too many things on the fly, that could create problems where they don\u2019t exist. Players who have come to know you as an advocate for the fired guy\u2019s system will wonder you really embrace. The \u201cgood cop\u201d role many assistants play will require some \u201cbad cop\u201d decisions now. Meanwhile, there\u2019s job security in play. Prunty has the position for the rest of Milwaukee\u2019s season, but immediately upon Kidd\u2019s firing, national pundits were calling the job \u201cone of the most sought-after\u201d in the NBA. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to mess it up,\u201d Carlesimo said. \u201cIt\u2019s a tremendous advantage being on the inside. You know all the players, they know you. You can change the rotations, you can change whatever you want. But the vast majority of the plays, the playbook, stays the same.\u201d Through the first week of the Prunty era, Milwaukee has demonstrated more tweaks than overhaul. Hidden within the team\u2019s overall offensive ( 107.7, 8th overall ) and defensive ( 106.7, 20th overall ) ratings are these monsters: the Bucks\u2019 offensive rating is 116.6 and their defensive rating is 95.1 during this 4-0 run \u2014 numbers that would rank No. 1 in both categories. It helps immensely to have faced the Phoenix Suns, Brooklyn Nets, Chicago Bulls (without Kris Dunn) and Philadelphia 76ers (without All-Star Joel Embiid) in those games. But the Bucks have noticed X & O adjustments, while talking about a change in atmosphere as well. \u201cRight now, you can tell guys are a little bit looser,\u201d guard Khris Middleton said. \u201cWith Joe, he preaches confidence. His plays are designed for us to move the ball side to side more. And just, not necessarily just playing off one matchup, but just trying to use the matchup as a decoy to get other guys shots.\u201d Antetokounmpo claimed to see no tactical differences, citing Prunty\u2019s influence even before Kidd\u2019s dismissal. But he did say that \u201cguys are playing harder.\u201d \u201cTeams usually take on the personality of the coach,\u201d Middleton added. \u201cWith Joe, he\u2019s a lot more relaxed, much more of a pick-a-guy-up type of guy and you kind of see that with the guys out here.\u201d Said Carlesimo: \u201cObviously the players there have responded. It usually goes one way or the other \u2014 players play well or they pack it in. The lame excuses aren\u2019t there anymore, so it\u2019s \u2018Hey, step up! If you or your agent or the media was implying there was something wrong with the coaching, here\u2019s your chance to show it.\u2019 \u201d Carlesimo went through this five years ago in Brooklyn, when Johnson was fired after a 14-14 start in 2012-13 . He moved over the proverbial 18 inches on the Nets bench and led them to a 35-19 mark the rest of the way. Things soured for that team \u2014 built around Joe Johnson, Deron Williams and Brook Lopez \u2014 only when it lost in the first round (dropping Game 7 at Barclay Center) to a Chicago club using journeyman Nate Robinson in injured Derrick Rose\u2019s role. That summer, Brooklyn cleaned house and hired Kidd, who hired Prunty. And so it goes. \u201c \u2018Interim\u2019 clearly is an audition,\u201d Carlesimo said. \u201cThere have been guys who were interim and got the job full-time. But that\u2019s usually not the way it goes. Management ends up going outside to change direction. \u201cIt\u2019s really going to come down to what the Bucks owners and Jon Horst think. It\u2019s Joe\u2019s job to land the plane.\u201d * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980. You can e-mail him  here , find  his archive here  and  follow him on Twitter .
