And they did it unconventionally, laughably and by any measure, dreadfully. It was Year One of the most ambitious rebuilding plan before or since, when the Sixers willingly laid down and became a doormat and allowed other teams to wipe their sneakers on them. That season, while LeBron James and Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh cruised to a fourth straight appearance , and their last together, in the NBA Finals, the Sixers lost 63 games . And then they got better at this tanking technique and lost 64 and 72 the next two years. But fast-forward to now, to Saturday at American Airlines Arena, and the roles with the Heat and Sixers are threatening to flip. Maybe not so drastically, but it\u2019s clear through four games of this first-round playoff series that the Sixers are going one way and the Heat another. The Sixers have Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid, a pair of young bedrocks slowly building something with the potential to be big. The Heat? They have banners in the rafters commemorating what they used to be, not so long ago. Philly also has something else on Miami, namely a 3-1 series lead after Simmons became the first rookie since Magic Johnson to drop a triple-double in a playoff game and Embiid fought through a poor shooting game and an irritating protective mask to spook any Heat player that challenged him at the rim. It was the Sixers who made all the right plays in the final crucial moments in the 106-102 win , getting key stops and buckets and pulling away, a team with a young core turning mature, and doing it rapidly, despite their lack of post-season experience. And having a front-row seat to this new Process was none other than Wade, a proud if aging member of the extinct Big Three who realizes something unique is happening with the Sixers. \u201cThis is a very good team,\u201d said Wade. \u201cThey\u2019ve got talent at almost every position. This is definitely one of the best first-round opponents I\u2019ve played in my career.\u201d Are the Sixers all that, already? \u201cThey\u2019re good,\u201d said Wade. \u201cThey\u2019re special. They put the right team together.\u201d Yes, they have. Maybe it wasn\u2019t properly done in the spirit of competition, and perhaps they embarrassed themselves if not the league while doing so, but that\u2019s all behind the Sixers right now. What\u2019s ahead of them is a potential series-clinching Game 5 in Philly and from there, who knows? Yes, the core of the Sixers is Simmons, Embiid and Dario Saric, all under 25, and in the playing rotation only JJ Redick and Marco Belinelli earned any significant playoff money. But if a young team is ever going to reach the NBA Finals, this is the right time, and this is the right team. Just look at the wide-open landscape in the East: LeBron and the Cavaliers, winners of the last three East titles, are down 2-1 to the Pacers and haven\u2019t appeared this fragile since LeBron returned to Cleveland. The Celtics are missing Kyrie Irving and Gordon Hayward. Toronto is the No. 1 seed in the East but inspires few outside Canada. Why not the Sixers? Why not now? Simmons is lacking a jump shot and little else, and still manages to score anyway. His direction of the club in the fourth quarter of Game 4 was near-masterful; Simmons stayed poised, found the open man and popped the Heat\u2019s comeback hopes with an uncontested dunk when Miami pulled within a point. Embiid couldn\u2019t hit a shot and yet didn\u2019t fall into a funk; rather he terrorized Miami by being a defensive force, punctuated by his spike of a Goran Dragic late-fourth quarter breakaway layup attempt (followed by an Embiid stare down). \u201cThey make you pay every time you make a mistake,\u201d said Wade. Speaking of which, the Sixers had 27 turnovers, certainly the recipe for disaster, and still found a way. In the words of coach Brett Brown: \u201cI\u2019m surprised we won this game. We really didn\u2019t have any right to win this game.\u201d But maybe it\u2019s just additional proof that this is Philly\u2019s time. It\u2019s quite a contrast to the ex-bully on the block. Four years after LeBron made the second biggest decision of his life, the Heat are still searching for the identity they had when the champagne flowed, and the party rolled on South Beach. The only reminder is Wade, and at age 36 he\u2019s only capable of having flashes now, like his 28 points in Game 2 and an impressive 25-point follow up Saturday that was marred only by a missed free throw in the final seconds. Besides that, there\u2019s nothing special. Pat Riley\u2019s latest attempt to recreate a winner is looking dubious right now. Riley decided two summers ago to build the Heat around a seven-foot center with low post-skills, which means Riley gave a $100 million to a dinosaur. And one with a decaying relationship with coach Erik Spoelstra. Hassan Whiteside can\u2019t get on the floor in today\u2019s NBA, where small-ball makes him a liability in certain situations. With no shooting range, and perhaps no incentive to develop one, Whiteside finds himself on the bench in fourth quarters and on the nerves of Spoelstra. \u201cHe\u2019s a prisoner of the style of play,\u201d said Brown. Plus: Riley also paid Josh Richardson, James Johnson, Tyler Johnson and Kelly Olynyk. Which means the Heat are almost guaranteed to be a 43-win team fighting for the final playoff spot for the next few years. When the Heat searched for someone to bail them out Saturday, who did they turn to? An aging All-Star who\u2019s on the downside, which says something about Wade \u2026 and the Heat\u2019s roster. \u201cHe ended up being our best option,\u201d said Spoelstra. There\u2019s another path the Heat can take, of course. They could follow the current Hawks, Nets, Lakers and Magic, who all took their cues from the 2014 Sixers, and take a few steps back before moving forward. But that\u2019s not a fool-proof plan \u2014 have you seen the Magic the last few years? \u2014 and besides, losing by any means isn\u2019t in Riley\u2019s DNA. So, mediocrity it is, then. Meanwhile, the Sixers have Embiid and Simmons and if you ask fans in Philly, they\u2019d say it was well worth the steep price, in terms of the misery of tanking, paid for them. \u201cThey\u2019re two players that have the chance to be great,\u201d said Brown. \u201cJoel has no right to be doing some of the things he does. Ben\u2019s composure down the stretch is amazing. Those two are exceptional.\u201d What the Sixers just did was win a pair in Miami, under the banners that hung over them, was fly in the face of basketball convention which says youth doesn\u2019t get served in the post-season. They can close out at home and then get the survivor of Celtics-Bucks, and Philly can expect to be the favorite in that conference semifinal. \u201cI can see how much we\u2019ve grown and how much more room we have to grow,\u201d said Brown. \u201cTo come here and get a win, in this building, against an organization of winning and culture and history, it\u2019s special.\u201d There\u2019s another story here: If the Sixers eliminate the Heat, then it could be curtains for Wade, who doesn\u2019t have a contract for next season, who hasn\u2019t committed to playing beyond this season, and who paused suspiciously for about three seconds when asked if Saturday was his final game in Miami. \u201cI don\u2019t want to answer that right now,\u201d he said. Whether he sticks around or takes the sunset cruise, Wade must realize that a transformation is taking place in the East. After years of deliberately bad basketball the Sixers are finally bearing fruit, and oh, speaking of food, Wade and the Heat can chew on this for a minute: The Sixers have room under the salary cap to give Embiid and Simmons some help next season. LeBron James, free agent-to-be, might reach the conclusion that the Sixers are his best championship option.

If there are concerns or worry by James, he was not sharing his thoughts as he did not speak to reporters on Saturday. And he did not have a whole lot to say in the immediate aftermath of Game 3, either, when Indiana erased a 17-point deficit and then held on for a 92-90 victory over the Cavs . Not only has the four-time MVP and three-time NBA champ never lost an opening NBA postseason series, going 12-0 in the past, he had never even trailed in the first round until this one, when Cleveland dropped Game 1 at home. Now he is behind again. \u201dWe\u2019ve had some good quarters,\u201d James said Friday, \u201dand we didn\u2019t have some good quarters.\u201d Well, that explains a lot.

A hungry, boisterous Friday night crowd at the BMO Harris Bradley Center. A somewhat cranky Bucks squad, unhappy both with the two performances they gave in Boston and with the heat that came their way since. A couple essential members of the Milwaukee rotation \u2013 point guard Eric Bledsoe and forward Jabari Parker \u2013 who, with bold talk, put themselves squarely under the bright and rather, hot put-up-or-shut-up spotlight. And of course, Thon Maker. Wait, who? It\u2019s an NBA clich\u00e9 by now that role players and reserves are most likely to help their teams in the playoffs at home rather than on the road. It\u2019s all about comfort zones, intimidation factors and other elements that either soothe or fray a young or fringe player\u2019s nerves. Well, Maker was a poster guy for that in the Bucks\u2019 116-92 victory over the Celtics. He scored 14 points, hit three of his four 3-point attempts, grabbed five rebounds and blocked five shots in 24-plus impactful minutes off the bench. Compare that to Maker\u2019s DNP-CD in Game 1 and his lone scoreless minute in Game 2, both held on the parquet at Boston\u2019s TD Garden. Maker and, for that matter, backup Bucks guard Matthew Dellavedova contributed mightily, the former at both ends, the latter defensively as he dogged Boston ball handlers for 94 feet. They brought energy, tenacity and determination that somehow made it into neither their carry-on bags or checked luggage for the initial trip to New England. \u201cThey both came ready to play,\u201d Bucks All-Star Giannis Antetokounmpo said, \u201cand checked into the game and set an example for the team. And everybody else followed.\u201d Maker, the 7-foot-1 second-year project from the South Sudan, got minutes in relief of big man Tyler Zeller, who started because of John Henson\u2019s aching back. Dellavedova was in on a need basis, dictated by the damage being done through two games by Boston point guard Terry Rozier. Neither of them had done much this season to either crow about or suggest helpful playoff contributions. Dellavedova, hobbled by tendinitis and an ankle sprain, played in only 38 games and dipped from 7.6 points per game in 2016-17 to 4.3 this season. Maker regressed more on merit. After starting 34 games as a rookie, he was called on to do so just 12 times this season. His playing time went up from 9.9 to 16.7 minutes but his production backslid from 14.5 points and 7.3 rebounds pro-rated to 36 minutes to 10.4 and 6.5. In short, Maker did little to justify mentor Kevin Garnett\u2019s bold prediction at the season\u2019s onset that the lanky defender with the pterodactyl wingspan one day would be named the NBA\u2019s Most Valuable Player. Most Disappointing Sophomore was more like it. None of which mattered a bit Friday. \u201cSometimes with guys that don\u2019t do it every night,\u201d Boston coach Brad Stevens said, \u201cyou\u2019re more fearful of what they\u2019re capable of than what their averages are. That was the case tonight.\u201d One thing about the playoffs is, a big game or even a game-turning moment can wash away a regular season\u2019s worth of heartbreak or ineffectiveness. Maker was feeling amped before the series even began, but it wasn\u2019t until the scene shifted to Milwaukee that he showed it. \u201cPlayoffs just really get me hyped,\u201d Maker said after his dynamic, rim-denying, plus-23 effort. \u201cThe crowd, even if it\u2019s an away crowd, just to hear that noise, you just get motivated. You just feel like you have to leave everything on the floor. \u201cIt\u2019s the end of the season. There\u2019s teams sitting at home watching us, and I do not want to be those guys. So I got to find a way to get out there and give everything I got. I have nothing to lose, like I said. I really love this game, and the playoffs are the biggest stage. So I gotta find a way to impact the game.\u201d To put Maker\u2019s shots and swats in context, he had six games all season before Friday in which he played as many minutes. Two in which he scored more points. One in which he posted a better plus\/minus rating. And none in which he blocked so many shots. Four of his five blocks Friday came in the first quarter. \u201cThon for me is like a little brother,\u201d Antetokounmpo said. \u201cWe had a conversation two weeks ago and I told him he has to bring that killer mentality back.\u201d Maker, you might recall, played well at a similar point last postseason, scoring 11 points in Milwaukee\u2019s 104-77 Game 3 blowout of the Raptors at home. That, too, was a spirited game, one that put the Bucks up 2-1 in the series and looked like a tipping point \u2026 until Toronto ran off three consecutive victories. The challenge to the Bucks now is even greater. Barely 36 hours after fending off, decisively, a potential 0-3 hole, they will need to do it all again on Sunday (1 ET, ABC). That means Khris Middleton, who topped Milwaukee in points (23), rebounds (eight) and assists (seven), leading the way again. With Antetokounmpo bedeviling Boston\u2019s defense and maybe avoiding the foul trouble that limited his playing time to 27:21. It means Bledsoe, with 17 points and four assists, staying on the right side of his matchup with Rozier, the Celtics point guard he had dissed with a \u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d remark after Game 2. It means Parker backing up his grumbles about short minutes by contributing something akin to the 17 points with five boards, two assists and two blocks he had in 30:13 Friday. Parker, a restricted free agent this summer whose relationship with Bucks management seems more than a little strained, declined to talk with reporters afterward. That instantly did his points-to-comments ratio some good. And then, if Milwaukee gets all that or something close to it in Game 4, it will hope that someone, anyone, can offer the boosts Dellavedova and Maker brought in this one.

Rondo played with the original Big 3 of this current era as a young point guard for the Boston Celtics led by Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen. So when he says that the Pelicans had the league\u2019s most powerful trio this season before DeMarcus Cousins suffered a season-ending Achilles injury, it should\u2019ve had you pause.

Will Guillory of Nola.com has more : The Pelicans came into the season with a roster built around the NBA\u2019s most overpowering frontcourt combination \u2014 Antony Davis and Cousins \u2014 and arguably one of the league\u2019s best two-way players in guard Jrue Holiday.

Sometimes, the team that wins a record 73 games in the regular season blows a 3-1 lead in The Finals. And assuming that the New Orleans Pelicans don\u2019t blow a 3-0 lead in their series with the Portland Trail Blazers, this will be the 12th straight year in which a team with home-court advantage has lost in the first round. Along those lines, the Washington Wizards trailed 2-0 entering Friday\u2019s Game 3, even though their 18th-ranked bench had outplayed the No. 1 bench in the league. The Toronto Raptors were missing key reserve Fred VanVleet for all but three minutes of the first two games, but their bench still had the ability to withstand his absence if the other reserves had performed up to their standards. They didn\u2019t, but the Raptors had outscored the Wizards 134-95 in 46 minutes with Toronto\u2019s two All-Stars (Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan) and Washington\u2019s two All-Stars (John Wall and Bradley Beal) all on the floor. And that was the difference. The Wizards, given their talent, are the most dangerous 8 seed the Eastern Conference has had since the last 1-8 upset (2012, when the No. 1 seed Chicago Bulls lost Derrick Rose in Game 1). But while their reserves, led by Mike Scott, stepped up in Toronto, their starters hadn\u2019t done their share. The Wizards, however, finally put it all together on Friday. And it started with Wall and Beal, who combined for 56 points on 22-for-42 shooting in a 122-103 victory to make sure that this series will be heading back to Toronto for a Game 5. Wall added 14 assists and the pair accounted for seven of the Wizards\u2019 10 steals as they slowed down the Toronto offense for the first time in the series. It looked like more of the same at the start, with the Toronto starters building a nine-point lead in the first quarter. But the Washington bench, along with Beal, got the lead back by the end of the period. Then Wall registered 13 points and six assists in a 39-point second quarter. Leading 69-61 at the break, Washington held what had been the postseason\u2019s most efficient offense to just 42 points over the final 24 minutes. The Wizards switched more often and played pick-and-rolls more conservatively in Game 3, allowing defenders not involved in the action to stay at home on Toronto\u2019s shooters and close passing lanes. DeRozan and Lowry were held somewhat in check and the Wizards outscored the Raptors by four points with all four All-Star guards on the floor. The Washington bench continued to play well, with Kelly Oubre Jr. providing some support to Mike Scott, who now has the best plus-minus (plus-33) in the series. The improvement of the bench didn\u2019t matter in the first two games. But it held up on Friday, in part because Beal scored as many points (28) as he did in the first two games combined. \u201cBrad came out and was looking to go towards the basket and not just letting them hold him and going along with it,\u201d Wizards coach Scott Brooks said afterward. \u201cHe didn\u2019t want to dance with his opponent, he wanted to get away from them. That was a critical part of his success.\u201d With Wall playing downhill most of the night, Game 3 was more about how good the Wizards can be than how disappointing the Wizards have been. \u201cIt starts with us,\u201d Beal said. \u201cYou see the results,\u201d Kelly Oubre Jr. added. \u201cWhen those guys are at the top of their game, they\u2019re unstoppable. So it\u2019s their job to lock in and take the next step of being great and bringing out that same fire every game.\u201d The \u201cevery game\u201d thing is the issue. The Wizards have been frustratingly inconsistent all season. Good wins have often followed by inexplicable losses. While the Raptors were Team TCB (takin\u2019 care of business) this season, going 35-2 against the 12 teams that finished with losing records, the Wizards were just 20-15 against that same group. On the other hand, the Wizards were 7-5 against the top three teams in the East and were one of two East teams (the Raptors were the other) to beat the Houston Rockets with both Chris Paul and James Harden in the lineup. The ceiling is high, but times when the Wizards reached it have been fleeting. On Friday, the Wizards played like the team they were projected to be when this season started and not the team that finished a disappointing eighth in the East. But nobody can know what\u2019s to come in Game 4 on Sunday (6 p.m. ET, TNT). \u201cWhen you\u2019re in the playoffs, you can\u2019t rest on the last game,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cIt\u2019s always about playing better the next game. We can\u2019t lose our edge.\u201d John Schuhmann is a staff writer for NBA.com. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

The two-game totals tell a frustrating story for the 22-year-old: just 13 points, 5 for 18 shooting and a 2-0 deficit in the series against the Rockets. Towns has found himself the subject of pointed criticism from analysts, fans and even his own team. The switch-heavy Rockets have double-teamed Towns to a stifling effect, and the Timberwolves sure haven\u2019t helped their 7-footer out by getting him the ball in favorable situations in the post. \u201dThey\u2019re coming to double.

And they want a win. The Timberwolves host the Rockets on Saturday night in Game 3. Earlier in the day, Miami takes on Philadelphia in the Eastern Conference and New Orleans hosts Portland, both in Game 4. Later, Utah visits Oklahoma City in Game 3. Towns tried his best to shrug off the bad vibes and stinging rebukes when speaking with reporters on Friday. \u201dYou dwell too much on the past, you forget that you\u2019ve got to take care of the present,\u201d Towns said.

Trouble was, during a season of constant evolution for the youngest team he\u2019d ever coached, Calipari hadn\u2019t gotten around to picking captains. For the longest time, he wasn\u2019t quite sure who to trust with that responsibility. But one of the players he sent to collect the hardware was freshman guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, who by that time had become de facto captain. \u201cHe [became] that guy because of how he works, how he performs, how he finishes games,\u201d Calipari said the next week during the NCAA Tournament. \u201cPlayers are now looking to him. The best way to have captains is kind of [let them] evolve versus \u2018I\u2019m naming you a captain.\u2019 I\u2019d rather it be that way.\u201d Gilgeous-Alexander, a 6-foot-6 point guard from Canada, was the least heralded recruit in Kentucky\u2019s 2017 class. Of the seven players signed by Calipari and his staff, five were rated five-star prospects and Gilgeous-Alexander, a consensus four-start recruit, was ranked seventh among them. That he wound up having the biggest impact on the team was no surprise to people who know him best. Raised by demanding parents \u2014 his mother, Charmaine Gilgeous, was on Canada\u2019s Olympic track team and sends her son text message critiques of his play after every game \u2014 Gilgeous-Alexander developed mental toughness and the willingness to be coached. Calipari doesn\u2019t go easy on his players, but nothing he threw at the young guard did anything but strengthen his resolve to improve and take his place as the Wildcats\u2019 leader. Gilgeous-Alexander\u2019s journey to stardom at Kentucky began in his native Canada, but continued in Chattanooga, Tenn., where Zach Ferrell has built a prep powerhouse at Hamilton Heights Christian Academy. Wanting to test his ability against better players, Gilgeous-Alexander came to the U.S. in the summer of 2015. Unheralded at the time, it took just a couple of months for him to begin attracting interest from power conference schools. Florida\u2019s Mike White was the first to offer a scholarship. Asked what attracted him to Gilgeous-Alexander, White quickly offered a brief, but on point answer. \u201cHis length, hands, touch, steadiness, and communication skills,\u201d White said. Gilgeous-Alexander committed to the Gators, but White and his staff knew it would be another year before they could lock him up with signed scholarship papers. A lot could happen in that time, and it did. In July 2016, Gilgeous-Alexander earned a spot on Canada\u2019s U18 team that competed in the FIBA Americas Championship and won the silver medal. He averaged 7.8 points, but more important, a tournament-high 5.4 assists and 3.0 steals. By October, he decided to reopen his commitment. He\u2019d been a fan of Calipari\u2019s Kentucky teams, and reached out to Calipari before the latter could contact him. By Halloween, he received an offer from Kentucky. Two weeks later, he was a Wildcat.  NBA scouts quickly realized that among the talent Calipari had collected, Gilgeous-Alexander was different. Calipari told the press he had an \u201cold man\u2019s,\u201d game, meaning old school, in a good way. Oscar Robertson used to say that if his opponent gave him a 15-foot shot, he\u2019d look for a 10-footer, and if he had a 10-footer, he\u2019d seek a five-footer, and if he had that, well, why not go get a layup? That was Gilgeous-Alexander. There were other plusses, too. With his height and wingspan, Gilgeous-Alexander could guard multiple positions, and he was a willing defender. And when he started showing everyone he could score at a high level, he shot up draft boards. Gilgeous-Alexander\u2019s 24 points against Louisville \u2014 \u201cShai was ridiculous,\u201d Cal said \u2014 were an eye opener. And as the season progressed, more often than not, it was Gilgeous-Alexander \u2014 who averaged 14.4 points, 4.1 rebounds, a team-high 5.10 assists, a team-high 1.6 steals and shot 40.4 from 3 \u2014 who carried the Wildcats. They endured a four-game losing streak during the first two weeks of February, but after Calipari made a couple of adjustments, allowing his players to focus more on attacking the basket and scoring than micro-managing them on defense, Kentucky took off. The Wildcats rebounded with four straight wins, lost at Florida in their season finale, then won three games in three days to capture their fourth straight SEC Tournament title. Gilgeous-Alexander had his fingerprints all over the trophy well before Sankey handed it to him \u2014 in the title game against Tennessee he collected 29 points, seven boards, three assists and two steals. He was an easy pick for tournament MVP. Kentucky continued that momentum into the NCAA Tournament, though its run was cut short in the Sweet 16. Gilgeous-Alexander averaged 20.3 points. Asked during the NCAAs to explain how he took over such a talented team, SGA attributed it to accepting Calipari\u2019s coaching. \u201cAbout midpoint during the season, I watched a lot of film,\u201d he said. \u201cI was really taking what coach was asking of me, what this team needed me to do. I just tackled it. Once I cleared that role out, I worked on my game and got better every day.\u201d Though Kentucky fell short of its goal to win the national championship, Gilgeous-Alexander more than demonstrated he was worthy of a lottery pick. And a coach who worked with him longer than Calipari, Hamilton Heights\u2019 Ferrell, thinks he knows how Gilgeous-Alexander will be utilized at the next level. \u201cI think he\u2019s a point guard,\u201d Farrell said. \u201cThrough and through. I\u2019ve never known him to be anything but a point guard. He came to Kentucky and people were saying he\u2019s a combo. They must have watched some film or seen something that I didn\u2019t see the last couple of years.\u201d Farrell has his reasons for projecting Gilgeous-Alexander as a point. \u201cHe\u2019s got incredible feel off the ball screen, which is so much what the NBA is; he can really get to the basket,\u201d Farrell said. \u201cIf you saw Kentucky this year \u2014 if their kids were making outside shots, you weren\u2019t beating them. If they were making outside shots and you had to stay with them, that means Shai was getting to the basket every time. \u201c[In the NCAA Tournament] Buffalo stayed with Kentucky\u2019s shooters more and Shai lit them up [27 points on 10-of-12 shooting]. But Kansas State [which beat the Wildcats in the Sweet 16] said \u2018you\u2019re not getting to the basket, guys are going to have to make shots.\u2019 In the NBA, it\u2019s not going to be that. Shea\u2019s position at the point will give him some phenomenal opportunities to create for others or get to the rim.\u201d * * * Chris Dortch is the editor of the Blue Ribbon College Basketball Yearbook .

He\u2019s trying not to be the same way. Game 3 of the Eastern Conference first-round series was difficult on many levels for Miami\u2019s center. He was in foul trouble throughout, finished with only five points and was largely a nonfactor in his team\u2019s 128-108 loss to the Philadelphia 76ers on Thursday night. Whiteside has a total of 11 points in three playoff games this season, after averaging 14 points in the regular season. \u201dIt\u2019s just different, man. I feel like our offense is a lot different,\u201d Whiteside said. \u201dI\u2019m not involved in as many dribble-handoffs as I was and post-ups as I was during the regular season. That\u2019s what Coach wants. Coach wants me to just be in a corner and set picks. I mean, that\u2019s what he wants so I\u2019ve just got to trust it.\u201d For his part, Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said he\u2019s trying to find ways to get Whiteside involved. \u201dThat\u2019s part of my job, is to figure it out,\u201d Spoelstra said. The Heat trail the series 2-1, with Game 4 on Saturday afternoon. Whiteside finished with only one field-goal attempt in Game 3, an alley-oop lob from Dwyane Wade that got turned into a dunk in the fourth quarter, seconds before Whiteside was taken out of the game for good. He had a bad turnover shortly before the dunk, and Spoelstra sent Kelly Olynyk to the scorer\u2019s table almost immediately after that miscue. \u201dI want to get more minutes out there,\u201d Whiteside said. \u201dI\u2019m going to keep trusting Coach\u2019s decision-making. Even with the fouls I still could have been out there. I wouldn\u2019t have fouled out.\u201d Whiteside played only 13 minutes \u2013 five minutes in the first quarter that ended with his second foul, 2 1\/2 minutes in second that ended with foul No. 3, 3 1\/2 minutes in the third that led to foul No. 4, then two minutes in the fourth where he had two turnovers. Meanwhile, 76ers center Joel Embiid scored 23 points in his return after a 10-game absence to recover from surgery to repair a broken left orbital bone. \u201dThey run enough plays for him that he\u2019s going to get his numbers,\u201d Whiteside said. \u201dI don\u2019t really get caught up in that. He lives a big-man\u2019s dream. He gets the ball, he gets the post-ups, he posts up every other play and they pretty much run a lot of stuff through him and Ben Simmons.\u201d Whiteside\u2019s inference was clear: He\u2019d love to get that many touches. He was asked how he can contribute in this series, and paused before answering. \u201dI\u2019m trying to figure that out right now,\u201d Whiteside said. \u201dI\u2019m trying to figure it out.

On April 20, 1986, inside Boston Garden, Michael Jordan put on one of his more unforgettable shows. Jordan was able to play in only 18 regular-season games in his second year in the NBA, after breaking a small bone in his foot in Chicago\u2019s third game of the year. But he made up for lost time by Game 2 of the Bulls\u2019 first-round series with the Celtics, torching Boston\u2019s defense to the tune of 63 points. In the game, Jordan was 22-for-41 overall, did not attempt a 3-pointer and made 19 of his 21 free throws. However, his performance wasn\u2019t enough as the Bulls lost the game 135-131.

Sure, McCutchen\u2019s 25 years of experience as one of the league\u2019s highest-rated game officials \u2014 including 169 playoff contests and 16 Finals games \u2014 would inform his new position with a real, recent perspective, feeding his effectiveness in working with the full staff of refs. On the other hand, coming so soon after the retirement of veterans Joey Crawford and Danny Crawford, taking McCutchen off the court would thin the ranks of proven referees. McCutchen believes he can help enough in his new macro- job, though, to make up for any losses at the micro- level. The native of San Angelo, Texas, who is known for a fashion sense built around a wardrobe of colorful, throwback \u201czoot suits,\u201d spoke with NBA.com in a wide-ranging interview. This Q&A is edited from that longer conversation: NBA.com : How does the dress code in your new job compare to your old one? Monty McCutchen : I put it in the contract, verbally, don\u2019t be tellin\u2019 me to wear gray and navy. It\u2019s not happening. NBA.com : How about the job itself, five months in? MM : I\u2019m enjoying the job. It\u2019s a different pace to my life. One of the things that\u2019s great about the new job is, you don\u2019t realize the amount of support that exists for referees when you\u2019re sort of out in the desert going from game to game. It\u2019s easy to paint your own picture of victimization and think, \u2018Aw, nobody loves me.\u2019 I\u2019m finding out that\u2019s just not true. The people I\u2019m getting to work with now [at NBA HQ] are sort of life-giving people. They\u2019re really enjoyable people. That\u2019s exciting at 52 years old, to take on something new and lets you grow. NBA.com : So you\u2019re feeling the love now that you\u2019re management. You weren\u2019t feeling that when you were labor? MM : I\u2019m not making bad calls anymore [laughs]. NBA.com : The just-completed regular season was marked by a lot of talk about player\/referee friction. Where do you feel things stand? MM : You\u2019re never solving all the missed calls. The work is imperfect. What we can have an impact on is the culture of mutual respect and how we disagree, and the culture of good people doing good work \u2014 which is what our referees are \u2014 can be respected even amongst the disagreements. That\u2019s what I hope to have an impact on. NBA.com : Danny Crawford, who retired last year, told me early this season he thinks officiating accuracy is about as good as it\u2019s going to get \u2014 and will be at approximately the same level 10 years from now. How much improvement is humanly possible? MM : That begs a question of what you value. For me, if you only value product, then it\u2019s about a percentage [of correct calls], right? I know that to the people we impact \u2014 our players, our coaches, our owners \u2014 product is really important. And it\u2019s important to me too. But process is also important. Regardless of what the potential outcome is, it\u2019s an integrity-based decision to be involved in the process to try to get better. To put the work in to get better. If you view life through that process, then the product will take care of itself. NBA.com : Give us an example of one area to be addressed. MM : With the use of modern technology in its various forms, with our replay center , with our ability to get information out more quickly to our officials, I think all of that will speed up the learning curve of our lesser-experienced officials. Our staff has the opportunity to become more consistent through rapid education. It can compress the difference between Kenny Mauer in year 32 or 33, whatever year he\u2019s in, and Ray Acosta, J.B. DeRosa and Jonathan Sterling in year 1. Then, when you put the work in, you live with the results. \u2026 We won\u2019t get to 100 percent. In that way, Danny is 100 percent right. But I will say, what is 100 percent? If we watch a game, we can\u2019t even agree what 100 percent would be. NBA.com : There often seems to be a style vs. substance component in play. For instance, early in retired referee Steve Javie\u2019s career, players and coaches praised his ability to adjudicate a game but felt he was arrogant and tough to talk to. Skills in both areas are essential, aren\u2019t they? MM : For years, none of [the latter] has been taught. Referees have sort of figured that out on their own. What we\u2019re hopeful to do is to start to implement some programs. We have a sports psychologist who helped us with our WNBA preseason meetings who gave a really great foundation for how to approach these interpersonal [relations]. If we start to educate and evaluate and say, hey, this matters \u2014 so does accuracy, but this matters \u2014 it pushes people in the direction of finding answers for themselves. I don\u2019t want to get too touchy-feely here. We need to understand this is an important part of refereeing. It doesn\u2019t mean acquiescing all the time. It just means being able to articulate a position. NBA.com : I\u2019ve heard from former referees that some of the younger officials don\u2019t arrive with as many skills or as much life experience as in the past. MM : And what we\u2019ve found is that, often, no choice is a choice. If I don\u2019t know what to say in my younger years of being a referee, if I don\u2019t know how to meet the will of the coaches and the players, I tend to default to nothing. I say nothing, I hope this goes away and I avoid the situation. What we\u2019re finding out from traveling around to various teams is, that non-choice is leading to the idea of arrogance, of being ignored, which of course amps up emotions. It doesn\u2019t calm them down. NBA.com : This is an emotional game, with players and coaches competing with a high intensity. Referees are supposed to stay cool and detached, right? MM : The one thing I would throw out for open discourse is that poise is an important part of all of our lives. Playing a game is emotional. Having things screamed at you is emotional as well. The fact is, we\u2019ve practiced and trained to remain poised, for the most part. We all can grow from more poise. NBA.com : Let me ask about some specific issues related to officiating. Like the idea of \u201cmake-up calls.\u201d In Minnesota\u2019s Game 1 loss to Houston , Jeff Teague inadvertently got hit in the jaw but the refs seemed to not see it. Moments later, with the Timberwolves\u2019 bench in uproar, Houston lost possession on a traveling call. And the color analyst working the game immediately labeled that a \u201cmake-up call.\u201d MM : I think it\u2019s the lowest hanging fruit. It\u2019s lazy reporting. And to be honest, it means someone doesn\u2019t have to put any real thought into what just happened. The fact is, we\u2019re scrutinized to such a degree that if you were to think that way, all you would be is wrong twice. And wrong twice gets you sent home earlier. What we\u2019re graded on is a percentage basis of correct and non-correct calls. We have consequences to our decisions. Was there actually a travel? OK, we missed the first call \u2014 I understand that. But do you know how many times I know I missed that call? Very few. It\u2019s only later that I understand I missed the call. This also might come as some surprise to you \u2014 I\u2019m being facetious and hopefully funny \u2014 that players will tell you things sometimes that aren\u2019t true. And only the tape will tell you that later on. If you go around making up calls, only to find out you were correct in the original case, look how far down the rabbit hole you would have gone. NBA.com : OK, how about \u201cstar treatment?\u201d In the same category? MM : Absolutely. Every one of our teams thinks that every superstar gets every call \u2014 except theirs. That\u2019s the nature of the business. I understand that, I don\u2019t begrudge anyone that sense of protecting their player. But you know what, the game is moving really, really fast. And the only way our fans can believe that the championship their team won or fell just short of is legitimate is if they believe in the integrity of our officials. Our officials want to get plays right whether it\u2019s the best players or players who are on 10-day contracts. Anyone who doesn\u2019t \u2014 and I come to know about it \u2014 won\u2019t be here for long. NBA.com : Why doesn\u2019t the NBA keep referees together in a \u201ccrew\u201d through a playoff series the way baseball does with its umpires? MM : I think you would build up a frustration level. With baseball, you get a different dynamic in a home-plate umpire every game in a series. That is not our work. If you were to have a [controversial] play at the end of Game 1, that crew would have to be living with the commentary and both teams would have to live with the thought that things weren\u2019t right. I think it\u2019s important that every game starts with a fresh slate. NBA.com : It\u2019s as if your refs all call balls and strikes every night. MM : That\u2019s right. NBA.com : Another playoff topic is how the points for flagrant fouls and technicals accumulate through the playoffs. That turned into a big deal for Golden State and Draymond Green two years ago. Is that an area where the referees have input or is it strictly up to the Competition Committee? MM : We have a non-voting voice in the Competition Committee \u2014 two of our current referees and myself are on that as part of the meetings, but without a vote. We can give our perspective but it\u2019s an administrative decision that\u2019s above my pay grade. But for me, I\u2019ll revert back philosophically to my point that poise is an important part of a championship pursuit. NBA.com : The officials working the playoffs continue to be evaluated and the initial group of 36 eventually narrows to 12 for The Finals. Someone always is watching? MM : Your body of work is evaluated. Just like missing one layup, we\u2019re not going to punish someone\u2019s career over one mistake. But if consistent work is not being produced, that hinders your ability to move on to serve the game. The game must be served at this time of year to its highest level. NBA.com : Second only perhaps to air traffic controllers, referees are reviewed and scrutinized more than almost any other profession, it seems. Can they ever just relax? MM : You have to own your ability to relax. We all took this job on, we all knew it\u2019s a highly scrutinized profession. Those of us who accept the work and the responsibility for it don\u2019t have any trouble getting on a treadmill the next day and working off a little stress. That doesn\u2019t mean you shake your mistakes as if they don\u2019t matter. Mistakes, when they impact game, stick with the referee. But they can\u2019t stick so much that they affect the next game\u2019s work. The participants in that game deserve our best work, not some victimized referee who\u2019s moping around because he or she feels too much pressure. NBA.com : Before and since the All-Star break \u2014 where a small group of players and referees gathered for a summit meeting \u2014 you and others from the league have met with all 30 teams to address officiating concerns. How has that gone? MM : We often want to put situations in opposition to one another, when in fact they\u2019re capable of moving along the same path that leads to a beneficial place. Our two unions meeting can\u2019t possibly be anything but a good thing. It\u2019s people talking about how to solve a problem. People looking inward about how to participate in that. That\u2019s great. Michelle Johnson (senior VP and head of referee operations), Shareef Abdur-Rahim (associate VP of basketball operations) and myself visited the teams and laid down a template for what good, honest discourse and constructive criticism can be about. We were open to listening to teams\u2019 perspective \u2026 and we were able to give a perspective and education about how hard our group [works], how much tape they watch and preparation they put in. In a profession that\u2019s been so good to me, to help other people have success and to see the league have success, I find that to have a great deal of meaning. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Ira Winderman of the South Florida Sun Sentinel, Keith Pompey of the Philadelphia Inquirer and Ramona Shelburne of ESPN.

He\u2019s got an answer for any and everything you throw at him in this first-round playoff series against the Minnesota Timberwolves, and the proof was found in Houston\u2019s 102-82 win in Game 2 . The Rockets are not some one-trick outfit that lives or dies by the 3-point line. Even with the superstar point guard duo of James Harden and Chris Paul leading the way, they are much more complete than that. This is a group just as capable of locking down on the defensive end as they are of overwhelming the opposition with one of the vintage 3-point showers D\u2019Antoni\u2019s team have been famous for over the years. That defensive component \u2014 the result of assistant coach Jeff Bzdelik and Houston\u2019s role players \u2014 was on full display in Wednesday night\u2019s romp against Minnesota. Even with a much-improved defensive presence, it\u2019s always nice to lean on an old standby if the situation demands it \u2014 the way it did in the opening minutes of Game 2 when D\u2019Antoni went searching for the right buttons to push with his starters struggling. He went to Gerald Green and he kicked off the fireworks, draining four of his seven shots from deep during an electric six-minute stretch of the second quarter that saw the Rockets flip a seven-point deficit into a 16-point lead, a cushion that ballooned to 27 before it was all over. \u201cSooner or later,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said, \u201cwe\u2019ve got too many guys, somebody\u2019s going to catch fire, you hope. Gerald did, he came in when we were struggling and hit a couple of threes and opened it up. Then once you see the ball go in, once you get the monkey off your back and all that stuff and then we played well for about two and a half quarters. Defensively, we played well the whole game and that\u2019s what it takes.\u201d Green\u2019s story is just as wild as his style \u2014 from his braids to the throwback Warren Moon Houston Oilers jersey he wore to the podium after the game as he sat next to Harden. A Houston native, Green was waived by the Milwaukee Bucks on the opening day of the season and was working out in his hometown when the Rockets called. They needed another perimeter player after Christmas, when James Harden was lost for seven games in January to a Grade 2 hamstring strain. Green was signed three days after Christmas and played the same night in Boston, going scoreless in his 11-minute season debut. But he proved to be an indispensable component on what was arguably the deepest and most balanced roster in the league. Now he epitomizes the depth, seasoning and talent on what is perhaps the most peculiarly effective playoff roster. \u201cTo me this is more than a dream,\u201d Green said after recording playoff career-highs in points (21) and rebounds (12). This moment right here that I\u2019m living right now is everything I dreamed about since I was five or six years old. Right now, I\u2019m staying in the moment but I\u2019m staying locked in because I still have a bigger goal we\u2019re trying to achieve. It\u2019s not just about getting to the playoffs. It\u2019s about getting a championship and bringing a championship to Houston. We\u2019ve still got a long way to go but I feel like I\u2019m as focused as I\u2019ve ever been on my dream.\u201d Harden and Paul share the same dream, only with the extra burden of being the faces of this Rockets team. They\u2019ve also shared tag-team duties in the rough outing department after the first two games of this series. Paul struggled in the opener (14 points, four assists, six turnovers), but bounced back Wednesday night with a classic line (27 points, eight assists, one turnover). Meanwhile, Harden shot a miserable 2-for-18 (and 1-for-10 on 3-pointers) in Game 2, finishing with 12 points after his 44-point, eight-assist night in Game 1. But there\u2019s so much more at work here, explained Harden, that he doesn\u2019t stress over off nights like he once did. \u201cI\u2019ve got better players around me,\u201d Harden said. \u201cBetter players on both ends of the floor that have my back and I know that. So yeah, I don\u2019t worry about me shooting the basketball. I can miss. I missed what, 16 shots today. I\u2019m going to shoot the ball, when you you\u2019ve got guys behind me telling me to \u2018keep shooting, that\u2019s your shot.\u2019 I\u2019m going to keep shooting. Then on the defensive end I just have to make sure I\u2019m locked in and create the energy, make sure my rotations are really good and keep communicating.\u201d Communicating on a roster that seems to fit together perfectly, with the contributions coming from all directions. Young center Clint Capela is an emerging talent and Houston is 44-3 with Harden, Paul and Capela in the lineup. Veteran forward Trevor Ariza, who has played for six different teams in his 14 seasons, has championship experience (Los Angeles Lakers, 2009) and can work on both ends. Rugged-yet-undersized power forward P.J. Tucker lacks that championship ring, but has defensive chops, too. Eric Gordon is the reigning Kia Sixth Man of the Year. And D\u2019Antoni can milk quality minutes out of the likes of a physical big man (16-year veteran Nene) and a steady guard (former All-Star Joe Johnson), if needed. And that doesn\u2019t account for two of D\u2019Antoni\u2019s regulars \u2014 forwards Ryan Anderson (left ankle sprain) and Luc Mbah a Moute (dislocated right shoulder) \u2014 who were in street clothes tonight. \u201cThey are a good team,\u201d Timberwolves forward Andrew Wiggins said. \u201cTheir team doesn\u2019t consist of one guy. They have a lot of good players that can put the ball in the hoop and lot of people that can create, so I think we did a good job on [Harden]. Now we have to stop the others.\u201d That might not be nearly as easy as it sounds. * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

Based purely on that, the possibilities along with the scales seemed tilted in their favor Wednesday. And when the buzzer sounded and the outcome was decided and fans rubbed their disbelieving eyes, those Oklahoma City Thunder\u2019s star trio found themselves on the bad side of the 102-95 score . Not only did they lose, but they were collectively outscored 13-2 in the fourth by Jazz rookie Donovan Mitchell \u2026 who just wrapped up his second career playoff game. This Western Conference first-round series is tied 1-1 because the Jazz revealed themselves for who they are, and in a big way. They\u2019re a dogged defensive team, perhaps the league\u2019s best, and they\u2019re led almost exclusively by a kid (in NBA years anyway) \u2014 although Mitchell never really looked like a rookie from the time he first suited up. He\u2019s playing a beefy role, the kind that rookies don\u2019t normally do or get because they lack the ability, wisdom and quite simply aren\u2019t put in that position by their coach. Those rules don\u2019t apply to Mitchell, especially when the game gets tense. His number is called more than a hotline and that hasn\u2019t changed even here, in the postseason and when matched against the reigning Kia MVP in Westbrook. \u201cWe\u2019ve given him that respect all season,\u201d said Joe Ingles, \u201cand there\u2019s no reason to take it from him now.\u201d Mitchell led the Jazz in scoring this season with 20.5 points per game and played 33.4 minutes per game. Only a handful of rookies in NBA history have led a playoff team in scoring, most of those are in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. Utah made him the team\u2019s lead singer almost instantly, partly because he proved himself right away, but also by necessity. After losing Gordon Hayward to free agency, nobody on the club brought the goods to wear that big a backpack. And when Rodney Hood was dealt at midseason, the Jazz lost their primary No. 2 option as well. None of it mattered to Donovan or affected his flow. He won the Verizon Slam Dunk contest during All-Star weekend yet also shot a respectable 34 percent on 3-pointers. He\u2019ll be in the running for Kia Rookie of the Year , and while Ben Simmons of the Philadelphia 76ers will probably win that award, Mitchell has pole position for Rookie of the Playoffs \u2014 especially after Wednesday. As the fourth quarter began, Mitchell was in the midst of an uneven game. He missed all seven of his 3-pointers, didn\u2019t attempt a first-half free throw and admittedly found himself drifting at times against OKC. \u201cThere was a point where I stopped being aggressive,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt I left them off the hook, to be honest.\u201d That\u2019s where his maturity and poise perked up. Rookies tend to freeze in these situations where the intensity doubles. For Mitchell, it was motivation. He played the final 11 minutes of the quarter and helped the Jazz pull away, finishing with 28 points (making eight of nine free throws in the second half) and six rebounds. In the final two minutes, he isolated on one of the NBA\u2019s top defensive players, but George was helpless after Mitchell executed a spin move and finger-rolled in a layup. \u201cI had to change up,\u201d said Mitchell. \u201cMy mindset was to go back to being aggressive.\u201d A handful of times during timeouts and after the whistle, he lectured his teammates \u2014 whether it was veterans Ricky Rubio and Rudy Gobert or anyone else. It further proved how a veteran team is showing respect to a rookie and allowing him to grow into a leader. \u201cWe\u2019re all giving advice to each other on the floor,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we are as a team. Everyone\u2019s engaged and giving you information, telling you what needs to be done, and what needs to be changed. That\u2019s what our team is all about.\u201d * * * Veteran NBA writer Shaun Powell has worked for newspapers and other publications for more than 25 years.

Having the NBA\u2019s best player explode for his team\u2019s first 16 points, 29 in the first half and 46 by night\u2019s end would make the Gatorade cooler over on the Cleveland sideline look like a coaching genius. That is Lue\u2019s luxury, that is Lue\u2019s curse. And like the other 29 guys who hold the same job around the league would be, he\u2019s fine with whatever dent that puts in his reputation as an \u201d X&O\u201d strategist or a leader of men. But there were other things going on for the Cavaliers as they beat the Pacers to even the best-of-seven series at 1-1 , and Lue did have a hand in them. Specifically, Lue reconfigured his starting lineup, swapping in J.R. Smith and Kyle Korver for Jeff Green and Rodney Hood. And the moves panned out, with both veteran shooting guards contributing at Quicken Loans Arena. Korver scored 12 points and played his underrated team-defense role, taking a pair of charges and diving to the floor in ways that might break most 37-year-olds. Smith, for so long in his career an unrepentant chucker, got by with only five shots but accepted the defensive challenge of guarding Indiana\u2019s primary scorer, Victor Oladipo. Smith got a pair of steals, including a pivotal one with three minutes left when he tied up Oladipo in the backcourt and turned it into a layup for a 93-86 lead. It was the 16th of the Pacers\u2019 17 turnovers, a lethal number on a night that began so brutally. Let\u2019s put it this way: James, for all the havoc he wreaked early, finished a plus-7 in plus\/minus. Smith was a plus-8. And Korver was a plus-15. \u201cEvery moment is big in the playoffs,\u201d Korver said afterward. \u201cMoments can change games, moments can create a run. So I think that\u2019s on all our minds. If there\u2019s a loose ball, dive on the floor. If you can take a charge, do that. The playoffs are all about scratching. Whatever it takes.\u201d Korver was proud of that last comment, working so smoothly into his analysis the Cavs\u2019 marketing department\u2019s slogan for the 2018 playoffs. \u201cWhatever It Takes.\u201d It seems a little plucky and feisty for a team whose core has gone to three consecutive Finals. But after a long, tumultuous regular season and a rigorous 96 minutes so far in the postseason, it might just apply. In moving Green (scoreless in Game 1) and Hood (a placeholder for a sick Korver) to the bench, Lue\u2019s first impulse was to surround James from tipoff with potent shooters. That worked beyond all expectations as the four-time MVP and strong candidate for a fifth shredded the Pacers\u2019 early defense at will. Lue had implored James, publicly and privately, to come out more aggressively this time, rather than facilitating teammates and taking the game\u2019s temperature the way he had on Sunday. It\u2019s a little harder to give the Cavs coach the credit for his star\u2019s more snarly demeanor \u2014 LeBron is who he is, answerable mostly to himself \u2014 but clearly, he was right in what Cleveland needed. \u201cThis was the most aggressive I\u2019ve seen [James] at the start of a game, as far as trying to make a conscious effort attacking,\u201d Smith said. \u201c \u2019Bron is at best when he\u2019s just comfortable being him. Not when he\u2019s trying to be too locked in or trying to be, just being quiet. That\u2019s not who he is. He\u2019s best when he\u2019s laughing, joking, having a good time. It just seems like he plays better, in my opinion.\u201d Smith gave credit to Korver for keep defenders spaced out and away from James, although Kevin Love and Smith had the same effect, with guard George Hill a little less feared from range. Korver, meanwhile, didn\u2019t overthink the Cavs\u2019 vastly improved start. Last time they trailed 33-14 after 12 minutes; this time, they were up 33-18. \u201cWe roll how he rolls,\u201d Korver said of James. \u201cThere are moments when he has to get us all going and get us shots, but a lot of our shots are predicated off him putting his head down and driving to the basket. Kind of creating things for us. That\u2019s how we play. \u201cWe don\u2019t run a motion offense or anything. We give LeBron the ball and say, \u2018Go to work.\u2019\u201d Actually, the Pacers were the ones who got busy after their initial stagger. They outscored Cleveland 79-67 over the final three quarters and got within four points numerous times. With barely a half minute left, Indiana had turned the Cavs\u2019 big bounce-back performance into a one-possession game, trailing just 95-92. Out of a timeout, the two most helpful Cavs sidekicks Wednesday, Korver and Smith, got crossed up on a switch and left Oladipo open on the right wing. He launched an uncontested 27-footer that would have tied it, but it bounced off. Oladipo has been outstanding through two games, but his opportunities got restricted by early foul trouble, limiting him to less than nine minutes in the first half. With Smith as a deterrent notwithstanding, Oladipo scored 15 in the second half anyway to boost the Pacers\u2019 hopes as the series shifts to Indianapolis for Games 3 and 4, starting Friday. That Cleveland\u2019s Kevin Love suffered a partially torn left thumb late in the game and might be bothered by it in Game 3 was a little added incentive for Indiana. So was the way they absorbed James\u2019 immediate haymaker without their knees buckling. \u201dTake nothing away from what he\u2019s done,\u201d Pacers forward Thaddeus Young said, \u201cbut he had 46 points and we lost by three. We punched them, they punched us. We\u2019re very, very confident.\u201d Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

The same goes for the playoff debut of Minnesota Timberwolves All-Star center Karl-Anthony Towns. Timberwolves coach Tom Thibodeau had one view in the immediate aftermath of the Timberwolves\u2019 Game 1 loss to the Houston Rockets Sunday night, when Towns struggled in his playoff debut, scoring just eight points on 3-for-9 shooting, well below his season average of 21.3 points. Thibodeau said his big man had to be more active to deal with he swarming and double-teaming defense the Rockets threw at him. But that uncharacteristic performance \u2014 Towns was held to fewer than eight points just twice in the regular season \u2014 looked much different after a thorough study of the film. \u201cAfter watching the film I thought he made a lot of good plays,\u201d Thibodeau said after the Timberwolves wrapped up practice Tuesday at Rice University. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a hard time guarding them in the regular season and there\u2019s still a lot of things we have to do better. But offensively, I thought he made good plays. I think he understands what he has to do, he\u2019ll be fine.\u201d The Timberwolves need Towns to be better than just \u201cfine\u201d in Game 2 Wednesday ( 8:30 p.m. ET, TNT ), particularly if his Rockets counterpart, Clint Capela (24 points, 12 rebounds and three blocks in Game 1) continues to play at a high level in this series. Towns clearly didn\u2019t take offense to Thibodeau\u2019s initial review of his performance, agreeing with his coach after Game 1 that he\u2019s \u201cgot to be better on both sides of the basketball.\u201d But he reiterated several times Tuesday that his objective is to stick with the game plan rather than getting caught up in any game inside the game, just to satisfy someone else\u2019s expectations of what a player of his considerable talents should be able to do in this setting. He did, however, acknowledge the strategic differences between the regular season and postseason atmosphere, and he\u2019ll be sure to adjust accordingly. \u201cI felt good out there, and I never take anything too high or too low. I always stay even-keeled,\u201d he said. \u201cIt felt to me like a regular game, but it\u2019s more about playing chess this time, you know. It\u2019s not about playing checkers, it\u2019s about playing chess. And it\u2019s a game about who is the more disciplined team, who sticks to their game plan the most and finds ways to adjust on the fly.\u201d Those adjustments for Towns must include taking advantage of the Rockets\u2019 endless switching on defense, situations where he ends up with a much smaller perimeter player matched up on him. He\u2019ll need to be more aggressive offensively, even if it requires a slight tweak to the game plan he mentioned repeatedly Tuesday.  \u201cYou\u2019ve got to do it when the game seems that it can be taken, or when its getting out of hand,\u201d Town said. \u201cI have to do a better job of assessing the situations and adjusting on the fly quicker, especially in the playoffs.\u201d It helps that the Timberwolves were within striking distance at the end on a night when they didn\u2019t get the best out of Towns. The same way the Rockets don\u2019t expect to struggle through another 10-for-37 shooting performance from beyond the 3-point line or for their superstar point guard Chris Paul to turn the ball over the way he did, the Timberwolves don\u2019t foresee another subpar performance from one of the league\u2019s elite big men. \u201cJust makes us more hungry, more confident,\u201d Towns said. \u201cWe felt we played well, but we made some mistakes here and there and it ended up costing us in the end. But if we can tweak things here and there, I think we can be something really special and we could possibly win the series.\u201d As for any suggestions that he needs to be more of a priority, as suggested by TNT analyst Charles Barkley after the game, Towns and his teammates were careful to sidestep any outside influence on the situation. Jimmy Butler issued a quick, \u201cnope,\u201d when asked for a response and ended his media obligation immediately after that. Towns took a more nuanced approach. \u201cI mean, we almost won the game,\u201d he said. \u201cSo you\u2019ve got to take it as its given. You\u2019ve got to go with the flow of the game. It\u2019s about following the game plan. We went with the flow of the game, had ourselves a great chance to win at the end. We were up with six minutes left, so our game plans were working. We cost ourselves as players, not as coaches, late in the game not getting some stops and James (Harden) making some tough shots. You can\u2019t control that. It\u2019s just great defense and better offense. \u201cIt happens sometimes like that, it doesn\u2019t matter when it is. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s game one or game 82, playoffs or whatever. Sometimes the basketball gods don\u2019t play in your favor that night. I think we did everything we could in that game to put ourselves in a position to win and that\u2019s all you can ask for at the end of the day.\u201d Well, that and maybe for the focus to shift just a little bit more on the best big man on the floor.

In the wake of dimissing coach Jeff Hornacek at season\u2019s end last week , the Knicks are searching for someone to push their team out of their five-season long playoff drought. One name that won\u2019t be in the mix: former New York Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy. According to ESPN\u2019s Ian Begley, the team has not shown interest in Van Gundy, who led the Knicks to the 1999 NBA Finals and coached the team from 1995-96 to 2001-02 . According to multiple reports, former Golden State Warriors coach and current ESPN analyst Mark Jackson, former Memphis Grizzlies coach David Fizdale and current Raptors 905 coach Jerry Stackhouse will soon get interviews with the team. In addition, former Knicks coach Mike Woodson and former Cleveland Cavaliers coach David Blatt may also soon get interviews, too. In fact, Stackhouse arrived in New York yesterday to do exactly that, according to the New York Daily News \u2018 Stefan Bondy and Al Iannazzone of the Newsday . Here\u2019s more from Iannazzone on Stackhouse and the coaching search: Stackhouse, 43, has coached the Raptors G League team for the last two seasons, leading them to the G League Finals in each season. He was G League Coach of the Year in 2016-17. Jackson was 121-109 in three seasons with the Warriors, but was fired after the 2013-14 season after clashes with management . Fizdale went 50-51 in his brief tenure with the Grizzlies, as he was fired 19 after a 7-12 start to this season. Woodson is 315-365 in his NBA coaching career, which he spent with the Atlanta Hawks and Knicks from 2004-14. He went 109-79 in two-plus seasons in New York, guiding the team to its last playoff berth and a division title in 2012-13. He was fired after a 37-45 finish in 2013-14 . Blatt was 82-40 in 1 1\/2 seasons of work with the Cavs, guiding them to the 2015 NBA Finals. However, he was fired midway through the 2015-16 season and his assistant, Tyronn Lue, took over from there.  The Knicks are among several teams seeking coaches this offseason, as the Charlotte Hornets and Orlando Magic also recently parted ways with their coaches, too. In addition, the Milwaukee Bucks, Phoenix Suns and Memphis Grizzlies were all led by interim coaches to close out the 2017-18 season. According to reports, the Magic and Hornets plan to interview Stackhouse, too. Fizdale has been linked to multiple NBA job openings as well."},{"id":47366,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/no-curry-no-worry-golden-state-warriors-cruise-2-0-lead","date":"2018-04-17","title":"No Stephen Curry, no worry as Golden State Warriors cruise to 2-0 lead","content":" OAKLAND, Calif. \u2014 On the morning of Game 2, moments after a light team warmup, the practice court of the Golden State Warriors cleared \u2026 save for one solitary player. What transpired next was done behind closed doors and so we can only assume that Stephen Curry did what Curry usually does in these situations: Dribble drills, shooting drills, rinse and repeat. Several hours later, though, at Oracle Arena, the only bounce he showed was when he rose from his chair during timeouts, wearing a plaid jacket and a satisfying grin. For the second time the Warriors didn\u2019t need Curry against the San Antonio Spurs which means everything is going according to plan for Golden State in this first round series. He can relax; the Warriors, so far anyway, got this. While Curry continues to mend from a knee injury, the Warriors continue to make a convincing case that they don\u2019t need him, at least not now, maybe not ever in the first round or even the second. Coach Steve Kerr made an interesting observation weeks ago after Curry went down, that they were good enough to beat anyone without him. So far, so \u2026 prophetic: It\u2019s 2-0 Warriors now in the best-of-seven after Monday\u2019s 116-101 victory , with no meaningful slippage in sight for the defending champions. To prove his point, Kerr put Andre Iguodala in Curry\u2019s starting point guard spot to start the series. It was a bold move but also an unintentionally arrogant one as well, because Iguodala has only started eight regular-season games in four years and has never played the position before in his 13-year NBA career. Iguodala opened Game 2 with three shots from deep, then settled in and supplied defense, some boards, a few chest passes and other intangibles that the Warriors have come to expect from him. He finished with 14 points, seven rebounds and five assists in just 27 minutes. This is what the Spurs are up against. \u201cI just love his poise,\u201d said Durant. \u201cHe\u2019s a veteran leader for us. A guy that just kind of keeps it real with everybody \u2026 he doesn\u2019t have an ego and he\u2019s going to go out there and do the best job he can do. Even if he\u2019s not making shots, he adds so much value to our team with his energy, his deflections, his rebounds, driving to the rim and getting hockey assists. We appreciate him for it.\u201d The Warriors were sloppy initially and trailed the Spurs by six at halftime after taking San Antonio\u2019s best shot, yet won by 15. That\u2019s because even without Curry, the reinforcements are deep, fully functional and clinically capable. The Spurs still have no resistance to offer for Durant and Klay Thompson, who combined for 63 points. And the Golden State defense once again held the Spurs under 42 percent shooting, an especially deadly number when LaMarcus Aldridge (34 points) is the only player worth a double team. \u201cNo one can make up Steph\u2019s contributions individually,\u201d said Thompson. \u201cThat\u2019s got to be done as a team, and even then it\u2019s hard, the way he can shoot the ball.\u201d Yes, a two-time Kia MVP isn\u2019t easily cloned. After Iguodala won Finals MVP honors in 2015, coincidentally by being elevated into the starting lineup in Game 4 of that series, he has become almost strictly a made-for-the-playoffs player. His numbers across the board have steadily dipped in the regular season, and the last two years he averaged 7.3 points and four rebounds. Last summer, Iguodala was a free agent and the Warriors were faced with perhaps their riskiest if not biggest financial decision of this championship era. Should they give considerable money to a player at age 34, especially with the payroll already soaring well into luxury tax hell? Durant did take less than his market value to give the Warriors some wiggle room, yet Iguodala demanded a three-year deal, and in almost any other situation, that many years tied up in an aging player would appear poisonous to a team. Indeed, Iguodala had feelers from other teams, namely the Houston Rockets \u2014 Golden State\u2019s biggest threat in the West. And so the Warriors caved, realizing that the possibility of Iguodala suiting up and possibly facing his old teammates in a key playoff series wouldn\u2019t be ideal. Asked if that would feel weird, he said, smiling: \u201cWell, I do know how to play these guys and I see them all the time in practice. But yeah, that would be strange.\u201d Boasting a roster rich in talent with four All-Stars, the Warriors can afford to cover for Iguodala in the regular season as long as he breaks from that slumber when the playoffs begin. They gave him that third year and his $48 million for what he can do for them from April through June, not September through March. \u201cYou try to be at your best around this time,\u201d he said. \u201cSo you take care of yourself, pace yourself and be ready.\u201d With Kawhi Leonard missing from the Spurs (and perhaps for good in the series ), the red alert for Iguodala might not flash until the next round or whenever the Warriors feel more threatened than they are now. Perhaps the West finals and against James Harden and the Rockets? That\u2019s the most likely scenario. That\u2019s where this appears to be heading. Until then, Kerr will keep Iguodala in the starting lineup against the Spurs and get, the Warriors hope, much of what he supplied in the first two games. \u201cThe biggest thing is not being afraid to fail,\u201d Iguodala said. \u201cYou try to embrace whatever situation you\u2019re put in. That\u2019s what I try to do. Being a starter, well, it\u2019s good to switch up at times. Sometimes you get complacent in that other role. Whatever they need from me, really, is fine.\u201d And that role is \u2026 point guard? Actually, Iguodala\u2019s strange promotion has more to do with his defensive mindset than his playmaking. Anyway, it\u2019s working and the Warriors are winning and they\u2019re doing it without one of the greatest shooters of all time. \u201cWe\u2019re just doing what we can until he gets back,\u201d said Thompson. \u201cHe\u2019s a special player and a big part of what we do, that\u2019s obvious.\u201d The clock on Curry\u2019s rehabilitation is another week or two, which would coincide with the start of the second round. Well, at this rate, by Sunday night, Curry might be joined by his teammates, who could finish off the Spurs and buy themselves an extended rest. This series isn\u2019t over, although it looks and feels like it is. This working out well for the Warriors. No Curry, no worry. * * * Veteran NBA writer Shaun Powell has worked for newspapers and other publications for more than 25 years.

Next is the addition of superstar point guard Chris Paul, for years now the epitome of the feisty floor general whose competitive nature can change the temperature in the room in an instant. The third dot is Clint Capela. That\u2019s right, the Swiss big man whose energy, athleticism, rim-protecting and rim-rolling gives the Rockets a lift the opposition often struggles to match when the talents of these three critical components of the best regular season in Rockets\u2019 history come together. It\u2019s not as simple as that, of course, but the raw numbers \u2014 the Rockets were 43-3 during the regular season with all three of them in the lineup \u2014 make it clear to anyone that the cosmic energy of the Rockets\u2019 three most dynamic players is undeniable. That Capela completes the Rockets\u2019 version of a \u201cBig Three\u201d is perhaps the biggest surprise in a season filled with them. Capela is a rising star, a bouncy young big whose name doesn\u2019t always come up when the discussion shifts to the best young centers in the game. That could change if he duplicates his performance from the Rockets\u2019 Game 1 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves in their first round playoff series . Capela worked the Timberwolves for 20 points and 10 rebounds in the first half and finished with 24, 12 and three blocks, thoroughly outplaying Timberwolves All-Star Karl-Anthony Towns in his playoff debut. \u201cI\u2019ve been here since Clint got here,\u201d Harden said after that Game 1 win . \u201cHe\u2019s developed, he listens, he works his butt off every single day, and it shows for big moments like that. So he has a long way to go. [But] helluva a job for Game one.\u201d An active Capela has been a good sign all season for the Rockets, who were 12-0 during the regular season when Capela scored 20 or more points and 21-0 when he had three or more blocks. After posting 25 double-doubles in his first three seasons combined, Capela registered 42 this season. His work as the primary defender against Towns in Game 1 proved to be critical as the Rockets kept one of the league\u2019s most dynamic bigs from getting untracked. But it was just another day at the office for Capela, who relishes his role as the Rockets\u2019 hard-hat worker. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to bring this every night, which means I feel great whenever I get up on guards or whenever I\u2019m in the post,\u201d he said. \u201cI just try to focus on what I have to do. I\u2019ve been studying these guys, so I know what they are looking for and which way they\u2019re trying to go. So every single tine I just try to be ready and make their job hard.\u201d Capela\u2019s work habits and diligence have paid off handsomely for the Rockets, who selected Capela at No. 25 in the 2014 draft. Once Dwight Howard\u2019s understudy, Capela\u2019s rapid rise eventually led to him replacing Howard as the Rockets\u2019 starting center and the ideal pick-and-roll partner for Harden, whose developed a spectacular chemistry with his 23-year-old big man. Capela\u2019s confidence in his fourth season has been off the charts, as he posted career-highs in minutes (27.5), points (13.9), rebounds (10.8) and blocks (1.9). After seeing spot duty in place of an injured Howard during his rookie season, Capela continued making his presence felt around the rim on both ends, a trait that always seems to work well for a big man in Mike D\u2019Antoni\u2019s offense. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m still coming up and with energy and run hard, set screens and finish at the rim,\u201d Capela said of his humble beginnings and evolution with the Rockets. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing it consistently and doing it well, which is why I\u2019ve got my opportunity more and more. Now I\u2019m starting, I\u2019m trying to do it consistently every night at a high level. It\u2019s been going well.\u201d If he can dial up a few more performances like he did in Game 1 against Towns and the Timberwolves, his breakout campaign could last deep into this postseason, perhaps into June. \u201cClint is big right now,\u201d Rockets reserve swingman Gerald Green said. \u201cI mean, he\u2019s our anchor. Defensively, that\u2019s what makes him so special, not what he can do offensively, what he can do defensively to change the game for us. We need him to play like he did (in Game 1) for the rest of the games.\u201d Wednesday\u2019s Game 2 at Toyota Center is a good place to start for Capela, who is set for a substantial raise on his $1.2-million salary this summer as a restricted free agent. \u201cHe was sitting at the kid\u2019s table at the wedding for a long time,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said. \u201cNow he\u2019s giving toasts and stuff like that. He\u2019s up with the guys now and they have confidence in him and he\u2019s matured a lot. He\u2019s terrific. He\u2019s really, really good. He\u2019s definitely undervalued. He won\u2019t be this summer when he gets paid. But right now he is. People kind of sleep on him a bit, but he\u2019s one of the better centers in the league.\u201d Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

He was the second worst jump-shooter in the league this season. And generally, he hurt his team whenever he stepped on the floor. But Wade still has star power, the ability to make big shots and big plays on any given night, and Monday was one of those nights. Wade\u2019s performance in Game 2 of the Miami Heat\u2019s first round series against the Philadelphia 76ers, 28 points on 11-for-16 shooting, was the difference in a 113-103 victory that gave the Heat home-court advantage as the series moves to Miami for Game 3 on Thursday. Wade is only here because the Cleveland Cavaliers decided they no longer needed him in their quest for a fourth straight trip to The Finals. After the Cavs made two major trades on deadline day in February, they decided that Wade wasn\u2019t needed, and they gave him a chance to return to the place he spent the first 13 years of his career. Wade got a hero\u2019s welcome upon his return to Miami, but he didn\u2019t give the Heat much of a boost. If anything, he compounded their offensive issues. He shot 41 percent in his 21 regular-season games with the Heat, and for the season as a whole, he had an effective field goal percentage of just 37 percent on shots from outside the paint, the second-worst mark among 207 players who attempted at least 200 shots from the outside. His lack of shooting, along with an inability to get to the basket like he used to, hurt the Miami offense. From the time the Heat reacquired him, they were almost 11 points per 100 possessions better offensively with Wade off the floor (scoring 111 per 100) than they were with him on the floor (scoring 100). Their defensive numbers were worse with him on the floor as well. On another team with another coach, another player would be out of the rotation with numbers like that. But this is Dwyane Wade on the Miami Heat, coached by Erik Spoelstra. The history with this player, this franchise and this coach can\u2019t be disregarded. \u201cYou put him in a Miami Heat uniform,\u201d Spoelstra said Monday, \u201cI don\u2019t care what his numbers were anywhere else or all year long or at different times. He\u2019s (made) for these moments.\u201d And so, in Game 2, Wade checked in late in the first quarter, and by the time he checked out midway through the second, he had made a huge \u2013 and positive \u2013 impact. In those 10 minutes, Wade shot 6-for-6, scoring 15 points and helping the Heat turn a nine-point deficit into a seven-point lead. He came back late in the second to score the Heat\u2019s final six points of the half and build that lead to 14. Wade got into the paint off the dribble, pulled up from mid-range when the Sixers gave him space and took advantage of smaller guards in the post. It was old-school shot selection, with seven of his 11 buckets coming between the paint and the 3-point line. The Sixers played Wade more aggressively in the second half, but he still made a near-impossible turnaround jumper over Robert Covington late in the third, and his big plays weren\u2019t limited to the offensive end of the floor. After a 19-7 Philadelphia run cut the Miami lead to two late in the fourth quarter, Wade made the biggest play of the game, roaming over to strip Dario Saric at the high post and streaking free to receive a Kelly Olynyk pass for a dunk that put the Heat up four. Philadelphia never had a chance to tie or take the lead after that. \u201cDwyane\u2019s steal changed the game,\u201d Sixers coach Brett Brown said. \u201cIf you were to pick one defining moment, one defining play, I think it was that.\u201d \u201cI watched that play go down early in the game,\u201d Wade said. \u201cI told myself, \u2018If they do that play later, I\u2019m going to steal it,\u2019 because I could see the pressure that we were putting on the elbow guy and where the pass needed to go. So it gave me a little time to sneak behind. I definitely took a chance, but I thought it was good gamble.\u201d This was a fantastic basketball game between two very good teams who are now past the \u201cfeeling each other out\u201d phase of this series. There\u2019s a big difference between 2-0 and 1-1, and in the intensity of a back-and-forth affair, Wade seemed to be playing at his own pace. \u201cThere was a rhythm and a calmness to his game like he didn\u2019t feel too much,\u201d Brown said. \u201cAnd there was a real confidence the way he played to make those shots. \u201cThat is classic Dwyane Wade.\u201d A great individual performance made the team better. The Heat outscored the Sixers by 16 points with Wade on the floor in a 10-point win. \u201cYou\u2019re not always going to be able to do it,\u201d Wade said. \u201cBut for the most part, to be able to come through for your team when they need you to, that feels good. The reason I was brought here was for a game like this.\u201d Over the course of a full season, Wade is a relatively ineffective NBA player. But the full season doesn\u2019t matter anymore and a performance like this can be the difference in a playoff series. Wade was a star again on Monday, and the Heat got what they were looking for when they brought their star back home. \u201cI\u2019m enjoying just every minute of this,\u201d Spoelstra said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been through every stage of our pro careers together. I don\u2019t know how long this will last. That\u2019s why I want to enjoy it now. I want to make the most of these moments.\u201d John Schuhmann is a staff writer for NBA.com.

Embiid had hoped to play in Game 2 after the NBA\u2019s concussion protocol, but the Sixers are being conservative with his return to the court and ultimately ruled him out . After Monday\u2019s game, Embiid took to Instagram to vent his frustrations, writing, \u201cF\u2014ing sick and tired of being babied.\u201d When asked about the post, Embiid stressed to ESPN\u2019s Ramona Shelburne that he was simply eager to suit up for his team once again. \u201cI promised the city the playoffs and I\u2019m not on the court and I may not be on Thursday either,\u201d Embiid said. \u201cI wish more than anything that I was out there. I just want the green light to play.\u201d After the loss, 76ers coach Brett Brown seemed understanding of Embiid\u2019s emotions. \u201cHe just wants to play basketball,\u201d Brown said. \u201cHe wants to be with his team. He wants to play in front of the fans. He wants to see this through. When he\u2019s not able to do that, he gets frustrated.\u201d This is not the first time Philadelphia has played it safe with Embiid\u2019s on-court health. The franchise kept him from playing in back-to-back games for most of the first half of the season. Despite those restrictions and his late-season injury, Embiid played in 63 games after logging just 31 total over his first three seasons since being drafted third overall in 2014."},{"id":40858,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/san-antonio-spurs-start-rudy-gay-over-kyle-anderson-game-2","date":"2018-04-17","title":"San Antonio Spurs start Rudy Gay over Kyle Anderson in Game 2","content":" Hoping to rebound from their 113-92 loss to Golden State in Game 1 , the Spurs are going with a different look to their starting lineup.

But they wouldn\u2019t have been alone; no one believed Aldridge had much of a shelf life in San Antonio. Rumors were plentiful before last June\u2019s Draft that the Spurs were shopping him , and they turned out to be true. Spurs coach Gregg Popovich acknowledged that, for the first time, a star player of his had asked to be dealt . Even more shockingly, Popovich copped that it was his fault, not Aldridge\u2019s, that things hadn\u2019t worked out since Aldridge had signed with the Spurs in 2014 , when he was among the biggest free-agent prizes available. Popovich vowed to put Aldridge back where he was comfortable, and followed through on it \u2014 not that he had many options, with Leonard missing almost all of the regular season and almost certainly all of the playoffs rehabbing a quad injury . With his back to the basket again, operating on the left block where he\u2019s operated much of his 12 NBA seasons and where he\u2019d played in Portland off Damian Lillard before coming to San Antonio, Aldridge again was an All-Star, putting up some of the most efficient numbers of his career ( 23.1 points and 8.5 rebounds per game ) and carrying the Spurs to the playoffs for the 21st straight season. \u201c Considering the way he\u2019s been playing and our recent success in those games, we are at the point where if LaMarcus gets a cough, a cold, we are in deep trouble,\u201d Manu Ginobili said after Aldridge left a late regular season game in Washington with a knee contusion. The Spurs remain a longshot themselves in the first round of the playoffs, but Aldridge, who got a three-year extension for $72 million at the start of the season, would now seem to be the guy with a long-term future in San Antonio. No translation necessary. Me: How have you all sustained this season through all the injuries and Kawhi not being here? LaMarcus Aldridge: Just having the next-man-up kind of mentality, having the system where you can plug in guys and they can understand, or they can help the team in the ways they\u2019re going to be good out there. And not giving in. It would have been easy to say we\u2019ve had all this adversity this year and it\u2019s not our year, but we have a bunch of guys that want to still be here. And we pushed through and guys got better, and the younger guys got some experience, and they\u2019ve gotten better. It\u2019s the whole team coming together. Me: What did you do to work with Dejounte [Murray] once Pop made it clear he was the guy at point guard ? LA: Just trying to talk to him. That big story came out about Dame and myself, and how we didn\u2019t talk . So I\u2019m trying to re-do that with him. He\u2019s not the same level of player offensively (as Lillard), but I\u2019m trying to talk with him more, mentor more as far as showing him things I\u2019ve learned over the years and showing him things he can do to make us better. And he\u2019s been great about listening, and he wants to get better. He\u2019s always in the gym. I feel like he\u2019s playing the toughest position out there, so it\u2019s going to take time. But he\u2019s definitely grown this year. Me: As a leader on this team, do you think you have to speak more? LA: I mean, that\u2019s definitely my role. That\u2019s who I\u2019ve grown to be. In the past, maybe not my first two years (in San Antonio), having Tim (Duncan), he\u2019s one of the best leaders in the game. I feel like this year, I\u2019ve definitely grown back to who I was. I\u2019ve been more vocal and tried to be that guy. I think guys have liked it. I\u2019ve had guys tell me at times I\u2019m not talking tonight. I think they\u2019ve gotten used to it. I\u2019ve definitely tried to stay on that and keep talking. Me: But at the other end of that, you have Tony [Parker] and Manu [Ginobili]. Do you defer to them? LA: They\u2019re both reserved guys. They talk at times. I think Manu talks more than Tony at times. They\u2019re both not really outspoken. So I try to take that burden of being the guy who\u2019s talking. They both speak when things have to be said. Me: Your numbers since the All-Star break are a little higher in terms of usage (31.2 after the break; 28.6 before), but your shots are different \u2014 fewer mid-range and more in the paint. Was that by design? LA: I mean, it\u2019s just what teams are giving you right now. I\u2019m a mid-range guy and most teams give that up, but that\u2019s what I do. So teams are not giving me that shot, so we do a lot of high-low stuff where I\u2019m at the rim or I\u2019m running the floor and trying to get something easy. And if I\u2019m out at the three and I\u2019m open, I shoot it, but that\u2019s not really what I want to do. For this team to be good I have to be mid-range and in, and let the other guys shoot threes. Me: Who is good for you in the high-low game? I know Pau [Gasol] has always been really good at it. LA: Pau\u2019s a great passer, a really skilled big. I think with him I\u2019m definitely better out there, because teams play me high or trap or whatever, and he\u2019s really good at putting that pass over the top. He\u2019s always looking for me. I think as any other big out there, he\u2019s the one that\u2019s always looking for me. Me: How rewarding has this season been for you? LA: It just feels good to be myself again. It wasn\u2019t really about trying to re-invent the wheel or do something I haven\u2019t done. This is who I\u2019ve been. So it felt good to be myself again and play my game again and get back to the level that I was at. It wasn\u2019t a surprise or anything new. This is just what I\u2019ve done. Me: But were you surprised when Pop said \u2018my fault?\u2019 LA: Yeah, for sure. As I\u2019ve told people, to have a Hall of Fame coach tell you that it was his fault, that he shouldn\u2019t have tried to change me, that was surreal to me. \u2018Cause I thought he was going to tell me \u2018go F yourself; I\u2019m Pop, you\u2019re wrong, I\u2019m right.\u2019 That\u2019s what you expect from someone of his caliber. It was the total opposite. He was like, you\u2019re right. I did try to change you and make you into my vision. You\u2019ve been in the league long enough; you\u2019ve done this. So I\u2019m going to leave you alone. Me: Do you have any expectation you\u2019re going to see Kawhi? LA: No, we\u2019re just playing. If you go day to day wondering when he\u2019s going to be back, then you\u2019re not in the moment and you\u2019re not going to do your job. You have to do your job and put your best foot forward and focus on what you have to do to win. If he comes back, great. But this is us right now, that\u2019s the attitude we have to have. Me: Any idea why it\u2019s been so hard for you to win on the road this year? LA: We shoot better at home as a group, so that\u2019s a part of it. I don\u2019t know. I just feel like we have to lock in. I feel (when) guys are at home they have the crowd behind them, and it\u2019s just better ju-ju and mojo, whatever it is. It\u2019s always better at home. But we have to figure it out, because in order to win it, you have to win on the road. We have guys that are definitely good enough to play home and away. We\u2019ve just got to lock in. https:\/\/twitter.com\/Jabari_Bird\/status\/984532746105163781%20 \u2014 Celtics rookie Jabari Bird (@Jabari_Bird), Thursday, 4:44 p.m., supposedly on FaceTime with Hall of Famer Larry Bird, also a Celtic, though one of slightly more renown. \u201cHe kept Stephen Jackson from beating me up.\u201d \u2014 Gregg Popovich , before Game 1 of the Golden State-San Antonio series, on the role assistant coach Mike Brown, now with the Warriors, played while he was an assistant with the Spurs. \u201cIt would be great to have a coach I could have for more than two years, you know.

From Konstantin Epp : It\u2019s a fair question, Konstantin. I think we do tend to take people for granted when they\u2019ve maintained a state of excellence for as long as LeBron has. And I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question it\u2019s probably cost him another MVP or two as voters (and I include myself in this) gravitate to the new thing. One could certainly cast an MVP vote for LeBron this year without hesitation. It would be hard for me to do so because the Cleveland Cavaliers have struggled so mightily for so many stretches during the season, especially at the defensive end, and LeBron was part of that struggle. In Westbrook\u2019s case, I think it\u2019s a combination of things. First, every season is its own and has its own drumbeat, so what voters thought last season doesn\u2019t matter this year. And that\u2019s why, while the Thunder\u2019s record this year is basically the same as last year, the circumstances of OKC\u2019s season are totally different. Last year, OKC was coming off the devastating loss of Kevin Durant, leaving the Thunder and Westbrook without a top-five player to play off of. That Westbrook not only led the team to the playoffs, but put up the numbers he did, was remarkable in that context. Yes, Victor Oladipo and Domantas Sabonis, in retrospect, were better than they showed there, but they never would have gotten the opportunity there that they have in Indiana. Maybe coach Billy Donovan could have and should have done more to incorporate them. It\u2019s a fair criticism. Second, it\u2019s so facile to dismiss Westbrook\u2019s triple-double accomplishments by saying he\u2019s hunting stats. Name me a superstar that doesn\u2019t, or hasn\u2019t, or who hasn\u2019t had assistance from time to time from sympathetic home stat crews. The bottom line is that no one had averaged a triple-double since Oscar Robertson in 1962. Westbrook has now done it two years in a row. To dismiss that is the height of arrogance in our hot-take world. But, it\u2019s also arrogant not to acknowledge the numbers James Harden has put up this season, the record that the Houston Rockets have and the way they\u2019ve played almost all year with Harden on the floor. Even the White Shadow had a probationary period. From Travis Stevens: Great question. To me, the biggest thing an NBA head coach has to have is credibility. How they are credible can take different forms.  A former player brings a certain gravitas to a locker room, to be sure. For example, if Kevin Garnett ever decided he wanted to be a coach, I think he\u2019d have a chance to be good at it; players respect him immensely. Other coaches gain credibility with their work ethic and\/or grind, like Erik Spoelstra or Stevens. Obviously, comfort with and belief in analytics, in today\u2019s NBA, is a must as well. Even when you\u2019re not winning, if you can show players why you want them to do something by being comfortable with modern numbers and what they mean \u2014 think Brett Brown \u2014 you can survive a bad year or two. The late Daly said it so well so many years ago: an NBA team is like 12 different Fortune 500 companies. They must allow you to coach them. As great as Popovich is, if Tim Duncan had tired of being cussed out in practice or in the film room, Pop would have never made it. It\u2019s not you, it\u2019s me. From Sherley Jean-Pierre: Has there been any thought given to awarding the No. 1 Draft pick to the non-playoff team with the best record? This would certainly create an incentive against tanking. Oh, there\u2019s been so much talk, Sherley. And I think that\u2019s part of the problem. Everyone seems to be so desperate to make the Lottery\/playoffs perfect that they\u2019re in danger of tinkering them to death (and I\u2019m not talking about your idea, which seems reasonable and logical). It\u2019s just that at some point the league and the teams need to come to an understanding that the Lottery is an imperfect system and that while it may be unfair to Western Conference teams that the balance of power is currently in that conference, there\u2019s no perfect solution that solves all potential problems.

Let the Brow percolate in the Big Easy for a spell. 4) Kevin Durant (15 ppg, 4 rpg, 5 apg, .478 FG, .857 FT): Warriors got their hometown discount last summer from KD; I\u2019d be shocked if he doesn\u2019t ask for, and get, the max on a multiyear deal with the usual outs to allow for escalating salaries and a new deal in two or three years. 5) Russell Westbrook (14.5 ppg, 19 rpg, 16 apg, .333 FG, .778 FT): The only number that matters with Westbrook: OKC is 54-14 (.794) the last two seasons when Westbrook gets a triple-double. As that is damn near a full regular season\u2019s worth of games, that ends all debate here about whether Westbrook\u2019s stat-stuffing feats have helped or hurt his team. Dropped out: Kyrie Irving $2.35 Billion \u2014 Reported valuation of the Brooklyn Nets, according to the New York Post , as Alibaba co-founder Joseph Tsai bought 49 percent of the team from majority owner Mikhalil Prokhorov. If that number is accurate it would represent a record valuation for an NBA team, topping the $2.2 billion valuation placed on the Rockets when they were bought outright by Tillman Fertitta last year. Tsai can and is expected to buy controlling interest of the team from Prokhorov in the next couple of years, though Prokhorov\u2019s and his company will continue to own Barclays Center, one of the busiest arenas in the country. 22,124,559 \u2014 Leaguewide attendance, per the NBA, this season , which set a new record for one year. The average attendance this season of 17,987 was also a league record, making the first time that NBA buildings operated at 95 percent of capacity.  29 \u2014 Consecutive playoff series in which a LeBron James team has won at least one road playoff game, according to Elias, an NBA record. The last team James was on that failed to win at least once on the road in the postseason was the 2009 Cavs, which lost all three games in Orlando en route to a 4-2 loss in the Eastern Conference finals . 1) The acolytes of The Process in Philadelphia have been in full throat as the Sixers have gone buck wild during their run to the playoffs. I hate to be That Guy, but: almost everyone that was on the floor for the 76ers in their Game 1 rout of Miami was someone that Bryan Colangelo had brought to the team since he became its GM in 2016. You remember how well that went over ( here , here and here ) at the time. But Colangelo drafted Ben Simmons first in the 2016 Draft . It\u2019s easy to say now that was a no-brainer; at the time, Simmons was viewed by many as the guy who couldn\u2019t even get his LSU team into the NCAA tournament. Colangelo signed J.J. Redick and Amir Johnson as free agents last summer. He kept funds available to give Robert Covington an extension. Colangelo got killed for trading a future first to move up two spots to get Markelle Fultz, who barely played during the regular season with injuries, while the Boston Celtics got Jayson Tatum third overall and looked brilliant. Yet Fultz has come back after missing four months and done much better than anyone thought he would. And, Colangelo got Marco Belinelli and Ersan Ilyasova at and after the trade deadline for nothing. Yes, Sam Hinkie took Joel Embiid, and should be properly credited for that; Embiid is the engine around which the franchise will run for the next decade. But Colangelo put the rest of the car together. 2) Teams do not let their coaches under contract speak with other teams. The Atlanta Hawks did, giving Mike Budenholzer permission to speak with the Phoenix Suns about their vacancy. Which means, everyone should end the mishegas now: Atlanta should let Budenholzer out of his deal, he should free the Hawks from the obligation of paying him the balance of his contract, which would allow him to go quickly to Phoenix, which has young talent that needs to be developed \u2014 prime Bud meat. And the Hawks, who stripped Budenholzer of his team president title last summer, can go about the business of bringing in a new guy who fits what GM Travis Schlenk wants. 3) God speed, Jerry Reynolds , the longtime TV color analyst for the Kings, who\u2019s retiring after more than two decades with the franchise . The second-most famous basketball person from French Lick, Ind., Jerry was quite funny on and off the air. When he was the Kings\u2019 director of player personnel, he once did a minor deal with the then Washington Bullets, the team I covered at the time, trading Byron Irvin for Steve Colter. So I had to call him to get his reaction. \u201cWell,\u201d he said in his twang, \u201cwe really shifted the balance of power in the league today.\u201d 4) Bueller \u2026 Bueller \u2026 Bueller . 5) Nothing to add: this is just really entrancing . 1) Here\u2019s betting that Steve Clifford won\u2019t be out of work very long. The obvious clip-n-save is seeing him reunite with Jeff Van Gundy if the latter gets another head coaching gig next season, but if that doesn\u2019t happen, Clifford should get consideration for head coach vacancies on his own dime. The Hornets\u2019 struggles the last two years were centered on injuries and poor roster choices, not Clifford\u2019s work on the bench. 2) The times I\u2019ve spoken with OKC play by play man Brian Davis over the years, he\u2019s been a very decent person. And I don\u2019t believe for a second that he was trying to pull a fast one by saying Russell Westbrook was playing \u201cout of his cotton picking mind\u201d in the Thunder\u2019s last regular season game. Just an unfortunate choice of words. 3) Best wishes for a quick and complete recovery to Doug Smith , the dean of hoops writers in Canada and the longtime beat writer\/columnist for the Toronto Star , who\u2019s coming back from a heart attack. 4) RIP, William Nack, one of the great, great sportswriters of this or any other era . I still read, often, his 1989 appreciation of Secretariat, the horse Nack came to love and chronicle throughout his historic Triple Crown season of 1973. Just take 10 minutes and read this . There\u2019s so much wonderful prose in here, so much detail and so much love for the subject. And Nack details those fleeting moments in one\u2019s life where they are, for a short time, impossibly happy where they are and what they\u2019re doing, and with whom they are doing it. They are the moments we all treasure and then think about when they are gone, until we are gone. Thank you, William Nack, for writing about yours so beautifully. * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

Can this crew provide the seraph blades? 3) Golden State Warriors (0-1) [3]: After throttling the Spurs in Game 1 Saturday at Oracle , the Warriors have won 10 straight playoff games at home. Their last loss was Game 7 of The 2016 Finals . 4) Cleveland Cavaliers (1-1) [4]: Need Playoff J.R. Smith (105-231, .455 on 3-pointers last two postseasons) to re-emerge. 5) Boston Celtics (1-1) [5]: Terry Rozier said it was \u201cdisrespectful\u201d for teams to say they wanted to play the depleted Celtics in the first round. Now\u2019s their chance to do something about it. 6) Utah Jazz (1-1) [6]: First back-to-back playoff appearances since 2008-10. 7) New Orleans Pelicans (2-0) [7]: Owner Gayle Benson seems to be making it plain that she plans to remain hands-on with the Pelicans  in the wake of her husband Tom\u2019s death last month. 8) Philadelphia 76ers (2-0) [8]: Haven\u2019t lost a game in a month.

It promises to be fascinating. 10) Oklahoma City Thunder (2-0) [10]: Good to see Paul George\u2019s shot came back, just in time for Game 1 Sunday against Utah. 11) Portland Trail Blazers (1-1) [11]: Maurice Harkless (arthroscopic knee surgery) is an under-the-radar big loss for the Blazers. 12) Indiana Pacers (0-1) [12]: Victor Oladipo getting the James Bond treatment  from teammate Lance Stephenson after going off on the Cavs in Game 1. 13) Miami Heat (1-1) [13]: The longtime beat writer for the Heat, the South Florida Sun-Sentinel \u2019s Ira Winderman, pointed out last week that the Heat , by making the playoffs rather than the Lottery, will surrender a much more benign first-round pick to Phoenix this year as part of the Goran Dragic trade than they could have. Miami still owes the Suns an unprotected first in 2021. 14) Milwaukee Bucks (1-1) [14]: If I\u2019m the Bucks, I honestly don\u2019t know what I would do about Jabari Parker \u2014 what to pay him, if he\u2019s the long-term small-ball answer at center. He\u2019s talented, but is he a fit? I really don\u2019t know. 15) Minnesota Timberwolves (2-0) [15]: Wednesday\u2019s overtime victory over Denver to clinch the final playoff spot was the biggest win for the franchise since May 19, 2004, when the Wolves beat Sacramento in Game 7 of the Western Conference semis, making the conference finals for the first \u2014 and, so far, only \u2014 time in franchise history. * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

My beloved alma mater has many great things going for it \u2014 world-class schools of international service and communication, extensive ties to the political and journalism worlds both locally and nationally. Oscar winners went to AU . Pulitzer Prize winners taught at AU . And, Judge Judy went there, too ! But \u2026 sports \u2026 not so much. AU\u2019s moments in the athletic sun are few and far between. Our soccer team reached the NCAA national championship game in 1985, but lost to UCLA, 1-0, in a game that ran eight overtimes. Eight. We currently play in the Patriot League, not a hotbed for notable sports figures \u2014 though C.J. McCollum (Lehigh) and Mike Muscala (Bucknell) have broken through in recent years, joining Adonal Foyle (Colgate) as Patriot League players turned NBA players. AU\u2019s only NBA player had been Kermit Washington , a rugged power forward in the 1970s who was the last NCAA player to average 20 points and 20 rebounds in one season. We love Kermit. Unfortunately, he is more infamous outside AU for hitting Rudy Tomjanovich during a fight in 1978 than famous for his good works with players as a trainer and union rep and charity work with kids in Africa. AU just doesn\u2019t register on that side of the athletic street. When one of our own has a magical, very good week, you can be I\u2019ll be next to the rooster, crowing in the dawn\u2019s early light. Step into the spotlight, Andre Ingram, Class of \u201907, physics major, part-time math tutor, all-time 3-point leader in the G League \u2014 and, finally, after 10 years in the minors, NBA rookie, at 32. It\u2019s so rare, in our hot-take, quick-to-outrage world, that there comes a story that everyone can feel good about and not carp about on Twitter. It\u2019s not that you\u2019re a cynic about these things, but people, being people, are human. They\u2019re fallible. They make mistakes in judgment that can be disappointing. But Ingram produces similar reactions in everyone \u2014 genuine joy at his accomplishment, given the work he put in over a decade to get here. Called up by the Lakers from their G League affiliate , the South Bay Lakers, to play the last two games of the NBA season, Ingram didn\u2019t just show up. He thrived as if channeling Roy Hobbs . Against the best team in the league, the Houston Rockets, he scored 19 points on 6 of 8 shooting , including 4 of 5 on 3-pointers. The next night, against the LA Clippers, he didn\u2019t shoot it as well, making just 2 of 9 shots. But he had six assists, three rebounds and two steals , finishing with a +23 in 35 minutes on the floor. And he handled all of it the same way he\u2019s handled everything since his days at AU (2003-07), where he\u2019s still fifth on the school\u2019s all-time scoring list and was a three-time all-Patriot League selection. \u201cI listened to myself when I was interviewed by somebody about him,\u201d said his coach at AU, Jeff Jones, on Sunday. \u201cI\u2019m sure there are people out there who will read it and go \u2018okay, right.\u2019 But it\u2019s one of those things. He\u2019s special \u2026 he\u2019s just one of those people who, he\u2019s a better person than the rest of us\u201d Jones, now the coach at Old Dominion, invited Ingram to work his camp last year to speak. \u201cOf course, he comes early,\u201d Jones said. And afterward, Ingram didn\u2019t want to be paid for his time. \u201cWhen we met with Andre, he\u2019s a person that\u2019s kind of represented by gratitude and appreciation,\u201d Lakers General Manager Rob Pelinka said Saturday. \u201cBeing in the room when we kind of surprised him \u2014 he thought it was an exit meeting \u2014 and we made an offer to wear the Lakers jersey, you could just see the emotion hit him, and then when he called his family. He\u2019s a terrific person. And in the building, all of a sudden, we\u2019re playing against the Rockets, and our crowd is chanting MVP when Andre Ingram\u2019s at the line. It as kind of a surreal moment.\u201d Ingram has carried himself the same way for years \u2014 dedicated to his craft, but also to helping when he can. That\u2019s taken many forms, including tutoring kids in math to supplement his basketball salaries and his young family, and being a mentor to his young South Bay teammates. \u201cThe value of him off the court for our G League team is something that has to be mentioned,\u201d South Bay General Manager Nick Mazzella said by phone Sunday. \u201cWe rely on developing young players. To have a guy in the locker room who can put an arm around a young guy going through a tough stretch, to show them good practice habits, that\u2019s invaluable to us.\u201d He was a star the moment he stepped on campus at AU, earning Patriot League Freshman of the Year honors, helping the Eagles reach the Patriot League championship game in 2004. He shouldn\u2019t have ever wound up there, having starred for Highland Springs High in Richmond. But Ingram was one of those talents that, for some reason, was barely recruited. \u201cVCU was his local team,\u201d Jones said. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t recruited there, or (the University of) Richmond. We knew. We absolutely knew that we were getting a steal. This was a kid that was better than his recruitment \u2026 we were holding our breath the hold time. He played AAU the summer before, because he was young. He was playing, maybe, in Orlando. And I was down there, and I was worried. He was averaging 30 a game. And all it took was somebody to persuade him to play at Fork Union for a (postgraduate) year, and then our NLI (National Letter of Intent) would be over. We never did talk about it. And I mentioned it this summer and he said \u2018I wasn\u2019t going to do that.\u2019\u201d He played the exact same way he does now \u2014 no wasted motion on the floor, constantly finding the soft spots in opponents\u2019 defenses, leading by example. But Ingram went undrafted in \u201907. He felt he could get to the NBA, though, and started the grind, beginning with the Utah Flash , which selected him in the seventh round of what was then the D-League Draft. After four years there, Ingram was the franchise\u2019s all-time leading scorer, making 328 3-pointers. (The Flash ceased operations in 2011 and was resurrected across the country two years later in Delaware; the team is now the Philadelphia 76ers\u2019 G League affiliate, the Delaware Blue Coats .) Ingram then started with the Lakers\u2019 organization, with the D-Fenders, always grinding toward his ultimate goal of making the NBA. As he kept making 3-pointers, and the NBA started turning toward small ball and wings who could shoot it from deep, a callup seemed in the cards. But it never materialized. A brief stop in Australia in 2016 lasted all of two games, and it was back to the G League and the Lakers, whose affiliate was relocated and renamed. As Ingram\u2019s hair turned gray, he kept making 3-pointers with that funky, Michael Adams-like release , becoming the G League\u2019s all-time leader in made 3-pointers. He was a testament to getting in the lab and perfecting the craft . But no call came from the parent team, which was dealing with the death of patriarch Jerry Buss in 2013 , a cascading series of bad personnel moves and the end of Kobe Bryant\u2019s career. There was just too much going on. But Jeanie Buss assumed control of the team last year, firing her brother Jim Buss and general manager Mitch Kupchak , and chose Magic Johnson and Pelinka to run the franchise. The Lakers vowed to start doing things differently and be more patient, building through the Draft and giving Luke Walton a real shot to grow into his role as coach. When the end of the Lakers\u2019 2017-18 regular season approached, with several players out with injuries, the team made one of its longest-serving employees\u2019 dreams come to fruition. \u201cA lot of the credit on this goes to our head of South Bay, Joey Buss,\u201d Pelinka said. \u201cThey approached Earvin and I with the concept. It\u2019s interesting; Jeanie Buss\u2019 driving philosophy is under this new leadership we have, is to do what\u2019s right for people, and always make the best choice. There\u2019s been times this year when we had to do that, and it was hard, like with Corey Brewer. We knew he wasn\u2019t playing and we could let him go and he could be on a playoff team ( Brewer signed with Oklahoma City after the Lakers released him ). If you do enough of the right things for people, it kind of comes back into how your franchise and your culture is viewed.\u201d It was several weeks in the making. \u201cThroughout the year, Joey Buss and I would meet with Rob and Magic and Luke about guys in the G League that we thought could be potential callups, guys that we would recommend,\u201d Mazzella said. \u201cAndre was a name that always came up. As much as it\u2019s a feel-good story, he plays the game the right way. He\u2019s the best shooter in the league. He\u2019s an underrated defender.\u201d The Lakers tapped into the G League throughout the season, bringing Nigel Hayes in from Westchester in February, and Travis Wear and Alex Caruso from South Bay. Finally, after a rash of injuries hit the parent team after the All-Star break \u2014 Josh Hart broke his hand; Brandon Ingram strained his groin; Kyle Kuzma banged up both ankles; Kentavious Caldwell-Pope sprained his right shoulder, and on and on \u2014 it was Andre Ingram\u2019s moment. Walton, who had been an assistant on the D-Fenders before going to Golden State Warriors to join Steve Kerr\u2019s staff, was all for it. South Bay and the Lakers both practiced in the franchise\u2019s new UCLA Health Training Center. All the coaches knew each other. It was like having a 27-man roster, basically. The conceit was that Ingram was being brought in for his exit interview after South Bay\u2019s season ended in the G League semifinals , and that everyone\u2019s interviews were being filmed for an end-of-season videography. \u201cWe wanted him to be the first to know,\u201d Mazzella said. \u201cIt would be great for Andre to show his family. And, it would be great for South Bay Lakers Twitter.\u201d No one expected what happened next. Something in Ingram\u2019s story touched people \u2014 not just NBA fans, but fans of anyone who doesn\u2019t give up on their dream. \u201cObviously, I was happy,\u201d said Ingram\u2019s business manager, Romone Penny \u2014 also a former AU player. \u201cAnd then I said, all this boy needs is a few minutes, and he\u2019s going to shine \u2014 he\u2019s going to show them what he can do. He\u2019s going to show them that he belongs.\u201d Which is when this got ridiculous. \u201cAndre took it and made into something even bigger,\u201d Pelinka said, which is about when The New York Times , ESPN , \u201cGood Morning America\u201d , the Los Angeles Dodgers and 96 other people that have blown up Penny\u2019s phone in the last week came calling. Which is why Ingram retreated to Virginia this weekend for some R and R before he starts to think about what\u2019s next. It\u2019s not easy to answer once the glow of last week starts to wear off. Here stands a 32-year-old rookie with exactly two games of NBA experience under his belt. That\u2019s not disqualifying by any means, but it\u2019s not exactly the resume of a Lottery pick. Ingram could go back to South Bay, one supposes. But once they\u2019ve seen the lights of Broadway, it\u2019s hard to go back to Summer Stock, not that there\u2019s anything wrong with Shakespeare in the Park. Could the Lakers have two Ingrams \u2014 Andre and Brandon \u2014 in camp next fall? \u201cThe other big philosophy of Jeanie Buss is once a Laker, always a Laker,\u201d Pelinka said. \u201cWe had our (real) exit meetings and we just said \u2018we want you around here. We want you in our building, continuing to work. Your spirit is so inspirational to all of us, the way you work.\u2019 We\u2019ll kind of let it unfold and see how happens, but definitely want him to stay close.\u201d I\u2019m too old to believe in fairy tales. But Andre Ingram can play somewhere in the NBA in 2018-19. Maybe it\u2019s not with the Lakers, who have a lot of young mouths to feed and dreams of bringing in some big-time free agents in July. But you can\u2019t tell me there isn\u2019t room on someone\u2019s roster somewhere for a no-excuses, hard-working, great teammate who may come into a came and drop five threes on a team that doesn\u2019t close out on him hard. I\u2019d believe that even if we hadn\u2019t gone to AU a decade apart. But it makes believing easier. \u201cHe showed at 32 years old, he fits,\u201d Mazzella said. \u201cEveryone\u2019s career path is different. He\u2019s the first guy in the weight room. He\u2019s always taking care of himself. I don\u2019t look at him as a guy past his prime getting a chance at the end. I think Andre still has something to prove.\u201d * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

That first step, that first foray into the great postseason abyss , required this sort of confirmation from the No. 1 overall seed in the entire tournament, so to speak. There\u2019s no room for Cinderellas around here, no slaying of Goliath, not on Clint Capela\u2019s watch. Not with James Harden on the case when the Rockets needed it most, and especially at crunch time. And not with Chris Paul, chip planted firmly on his shoulder as always, eyeballing bigger and better things than being the best from late October to mid-April. So it won\u2019t be easy. Nobody said it would be. And let\u2019s be clear, the Minnesota Timberwolves are not a normal eight seed. Not really. A healthy Jimmy Butler and the infusion of veteran talent that helped end the second longest playoff drought in NBA history this season makes that big a difference. They certainly did Sunday night at Toyota Center, when the Rockets were forced to battle until the very end for a 104-101 win despite a 44-point masterpiece from Harden. But like everyone else who dealt with these juggernaut Rockets all season long, Harden and his crew proved to be too much with the game on the line. With Harden on the bench and the game tied at 85 with 6:49 to play, the script was already written. He came in for Paul with 6:07 to play and the Rockets up a point, and promptly scored on a driving layup. He stole the ball and then scored on a driving floater. After a Capela block, he scored on a driving layup. By the time he knocked down a 3-pointer with 4:27 left, the Rockets\u2019 lead was back up to eight points, 94-86, and it was clear that Harden was going to do whatever it took \u2014 scoring, playmaking and even defending \u2014 to keep Game 1 from going awry. It was vintage work from the maestro who has owned the floor most every night since the season opener, when Harden and the Rockets went into Oracle Arena as the reigning champion Golden State Warriors hung another banner and collected those diamond-laced title rings and walked off the floor winners. \u201cAnother day for James,\u201d Rockets coach Mike D\u2019Antoni said after Harden finished one point shy of his playoff career high. \u201cHe\u2019s done it all year and he really stepped up. We were struggling to make shots, struggling to really have any kind of rhythm of play and James put us on his back and he\u2019s been doing it for a while now.\u201d D\u2019Antoni will have to forgive the rest of us, including the frontrunner for the Kia MVP this season, for not digesting his theory about the playoffs being something other than a referendum on his team\u2019s magical regular season. Harden operated like someone keenly aware of what was at stake with the Timberwolves, each and every one of them, trying in vain to slow him down. \u201cHonestly, I just try to be aggressive and make the right play,\u201d Harden said. \u201cThings got slowed up a little bit, just try to be aggressive with my shot and fortunately it went in.\u201d Jimmy Butler is an All-Star and one of the league\u2019s best two-way players. Derrick Rose is a former Kia MVP himself, and still has enough juice left to make things difficult for someone when he locks in the way he did on this night. And neither one of them had any luck slowing Harden down during his second-half blitz. He scored 25 of his points in the final 18 minutes, making play after play when the Timberwolves appeared to be on the verge of potentially pulling off a shocker. \u201cThere were several plays in which I thought we defended well and he made shots,\u201d Timberwolves coach Tom Thibodeau said. \u201cJames is that type of player and we\u2019ve seen it all year, (he\u2019s) very difficult to guard. Basically, you have to guard him with your whole team. And it\u2019s not just his scoring, but his playmaking and all the things that he does.\u201d The Rockets won on a night when they shot a brutal 27 percent (10-for-37) from beyond the 3-point line, where they\u2019ve feasted on the opposition all season. They roasted the Timberwolves from distance during their regular season match ups to the tune of 43.4 percent and more than doubled them up in 3-point makes during those games, but made just two more Sunday night. Harden was 7-for-12 from deep, a playoff career-high for makes, while the rest of the Rockets shot a combined 3-for-25. And he was draining his shots with hands in his face routinely. \u201cHe\u2019s an MVP candidate and you know why,\u201d said Timberwolves big man Taj Gibson. \u201cEvery time the game was \u2018mono e mono\u2019 and they were in a tight spot, he just took over the game. He made some tough shots, he played phenomenal tonight. We were trying to throw everything at him, he\u2019s a talented player.\u201d He\u2019s clearly much more than that. \u201cI mean yeah, he\u2019s a hell of a player,\u201d Butler said. \u201cEveryone knows that. But you don\u2019t just guard him with one guy. It\u2019s everybody out there, everybody has to be in the correct position. Challenge shots; contest them at the rim, but more than anything, if there is a miss we\u2019ve got to get the rebound and take off the other way. But we didn\u2019t do any of that tonight, we\u2019ve got to be better (in Game 2) on Wednesday.\u201d Thibodeau had to turn to his bench to stay in the game before halftime and they delivered, scoring 19 points and playing with an energy level that matched what the Rockets did regardless of who was on the floor. Rose (nine points), Jamal Crawford (seven) and Gorgui Dieng (three) did all that bench scoring, which was the only way to offset the furious 49 points Capela and Harden combined for before the break. Jeff Teague\u2019s three fouls and Butler\u2019s defensive task, trying to keep Harden under wraps, required so much of his attention that the scoring load had to be picked up by someone else. He went scoreless in the first quarter and just never seemed to get untracked early on, finishing with just 13 points on 4-for-11 shooting. It\u2019s an issue the Timberwolves won\u2019t be able to scheme their way out of in this series, not as long as Capela is the most energetic and effective young big man on either team. He outscored the All-Star Towns 20-3 before the break and out rebounded him 10-5, adding two blocks and a steal to drive home the point that he\u2019s up for this challenge all series long. \u201cMan, Clint was all over the place, both ends of the court offensively and defensively,\u201d Paul said. \u201cYou see him defending KAT, who\u2019s a tough cover in the post. You know I\u2019m low, and I weak side and I\u2019m watching him go up for the hook, and then I\u2019m watching Clint block it, and then he\u2019s running. he was unbelievable tonight and we\u2019re going to need that all season.\u201d Capela finished his night with 24 points, 12 rebounds and three blocks while Towns didn\u2019t crack double digits in the scoring column (eight points on 3-for-9 shooting, 12 rebounds in a team-high 40 minutes of action). Chalk it up as a lesson learned for the playoff rookie. That must-win game the Timberwolves won at home over Denver Wednesday night had all the hype and intensity of a playoff game, only it wasn\u2019t. Thibodeau credited the Rockets\u2019 defense, the swarming and double-teaming of Towns, for slowing the big man down. \u201cHe has to be more active,\u201d Thibodeau said, before praising the Rockets for perhaps their most underrated trait this season: The ability to lock down defensively. \u201cThey\u2019re good, they\u2019re very good. They\u2019re tied together, they do a lot of switching and after the switch they read the ball extremely well. They react, they swarm, and so you have ti make good decisions, you have to make good plays. You have to have the ability to read and react.\u201d Funny, that\u2019s what the Rockets\u2019 best player does perhaps as well as any other player in the league right now. Harden reads and reacts accordingly, always seemingly coming up with the right play at the right time. That\u2019s how you know he\u2019s in the moment right now, as are the rest of the Rockets. No matter how many times and how many different ways anyone tries to deflect attention from the obvious, they comprehend every bit of what lies ahead for a team riding into the postseason on the strength of a 65-win regular season that saw them run away from the competition. They wouldn\u2019t have souls if they didn\u2019t. They wouldn\u2019t be human if they hadn\u2019t already calculated the weight of the best regular season in franchise history times a wide-open postseason equaling something that\u2019s never been done here, which says a lot for a franchise that has two Larry O\u2019Brien trophies to show off. They know how important each and every step on this current journey is, starting with Sunday night\u2019s very first choppy ones. Any suggestion to the contrary is, shall we say, a distant cousin of the truth. But we\u2019ll play along for now, at the beginning. Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

If you think their 98-80 victory in Game 1 of the teams\u2019 first-round Eastern Conference series was one of those \u201cplucky underdog steals one from blas\u00e9 favorite\u201d flukes, you weren\u2019t paying close attention to what played out over 48 minutes on Cleveland\u2019s home court. The Pacers might have had a little surprise and opponent overconfidence on their side, but mostly they took a 1-0 lead in the best-of-seven series because they outplayed the defending East champs. They limited the Cavaliers to 80 points and 8-of-34 3-point shooting. They dictated the pace, controlled the ball and led 25-8 late in the first quarter and 33-14 when it ended. The Pacers stymied a couple Cleveland players with their defensive matchups (notably sticking big man Myles Turner on Jeff Green), exploited the playoff inexperience of some of the Cavs\u2019 newcomers and created points by creating turnovers (12 steals). They did not panic when LeBron James and his crew revved up in each of the final three quarters. And the Pacers saw to it that their star, Victor Oladipo, got the opportunities to play like one. Bottom line, they out-X\u2019d and out-O\u2019d the Cavaliers, which is why Indiana might be in line for something bigger over the next 10 days than pats on the head. \u201cWe\u2019ve been playing like this all year,\u201d Oladipo said, as deadpan after the victory as he was demonstrative during it. \u201cBeen playing hard at both ends all year. It\u2019s just that it hasn\u2019t been magnified. It\u2019s the playoffs now \u2026 so everybody sees it. So, it\u2019s like, it\u2019s kind of shocking to everybody.\u201d Oladipo scored 32 points on 11-of-19 shooting, 6-of-9 from the arc, and added six rebounds, four assists and four steals. He turned a flurry of personal slights last summer \u2013 media, fans and folks within the NBA (including Cavs owner Dan Gilbert) openly criticized Indiana for trading All-Star Paul George to OKC for \u201conly\u201d Oladipo and big man Domantas Sabonis \u2013 into motivation that got him to All-Star Weekend and a likely Most Improved Player award. Oladipo wasn\u2019t about to take a step back Sunday and, same as during the first 82 games, neither were his teammates. Sized up as a lottery team last fall, they got to the postseason as the East\u2019s No. 5 seed and apologized to no one after ending James\u2019 streak of 21 consecutive first-round victories. \u201cWe\u2019re fully aware of LeBron, we\u2019re fully aware of this team,\u201d Oladipo said. \u201cAnd we realize it\u2019s not going to be easy. But that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re going to come in here and just fold. \u201cWe\u2019re planning on winning. That\u2019s why we came to this series, that\u2019s why we came to play this game \u2013 to win. Not just come in here and be OK.\u201d Chances are good that, if you hacked into Indiana\u2019s scouting reports, you\u2019d find a game plan that looks remarkably like the video James, coach Tyronn Lue and the rest of the Cavs will be breaking down before Wednesday\u2019s Game 2. Much of what the Pacers wanted to do, they did. And most of what they did worked. Assigning Bojan Bogdanovic to guard James, particularly early, kept the Cavs star off stride just enough while he shouldered responsibility for setting up his teammates. Turner on Green meant Kevin Love had to cope with more mobile Thaddeus Young. Cleveland\u2019s George Hill got blind-sided on a pick by Pacers reserve Trevor Booker in the first half, then his back stiffened up. Hill only lasted a few minutes in the third quarter. That put James at point guard even longer, keeping him out of the post where he looked capable of doing more damage, while limiting his downhill assaults on the rim. But the Pacers avoided backpedaling frantically in transition by controlling the ball and keeping the floor balanced, and they were good generally at stopping the ball so James couldn\u2019t collapse their defense for easy kick-outs. Not every one of Cleveland\u2019s 26 missed 3-pointer was hotly contested but few were wide-open looks either. \u201cThey came in and they dictated the tempo,\u201d said James, who got a triple-double with 24 points, 10 rebounds and 12 assists but was a minus-13 in his 44 minutes. \u201cThey were more aggressive. They just played inspired basketball. \u2026 They were more physical than us at the point of attack. They were more precise in what they wanted to do. And we couldn\u2019t score the ball.\u201d James was anything but flummoxed (\u201cI\u2019m down 0-1 in the first round. I was down 3-1 in the Finals\u201d). He and Lue mentioned the newbies, guys like Jordan Clarkson, Rodney Hood and Larry Nance Jr. who were acquired at the trade deadline. Nothing in their NBA careers to date had prepared them for quite this stage or intensity, but now they\u2019ve sampled it. \u201cListen, experience is the best teacher,\u201d James said, \u201cand they got it today.\u201d Yet the Pacers\u2019 roster is full of younger, inexperienced players too. They handled Game 1 just fine. When the Cavaliers twice got within seven points and goosed the home crowd \u2013 late in the third and early in the fourth \u2013 Indiana carefully plugged its leaks and built back its lead. \u201cWe\u2019ve got 10 new players,\u201d coach Nate McMillan said. \u201cThey kept pretty calm and poised throughout the season. This is something we conditioned ourselves for \u2013 we talk about being calm, clear and connected every single night. \u201c[When] you\u2019re in postseason basketball, you\u2019re going up against a player like LeBron and all the things he\u2019s done, it\u2019s going to be emotional. You\u2019re on their home court. You\u2019re going to have to show that calmness. You\u2019re going to have to be clear about what you need to do, and connected out there.\u201d Said reserve guard Cory Joseph: \u201cWe don\u2019t feel like the underdog. That\u2019s what the media and those guys say. But we don\u2019t worry about that. We know we\u2019re a good team and we can stay tight. We stay together and play hard. \u201cAt the end of the day, every good team it comes down to, especially in the playoffs, execution, defense, the details.\u201d Indiana didn\u2019t just play like a good team in taking the opener. It is a good team. Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980. You can e-mail him  here , find  his archive here  and  follow him on Twitter .

Essentially, they\u2019re trailing the Golden State Warriors and also failing in their attempt to get their franchise player back in uniform and in time to save their season. And unless something drastic happens in both situations, the Spurs look destined to go 0-for-2. Being down 1-0 in the best-of-seven to the Warriors is easy to explain. Golden State has Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green and a determination to repeat as NBA champions, so they\u2019re strong out of the gate in these playoffs and are anxiously pouncing on the disadvantaged Spurs. That\u2019s evident. After looking lethargic and uninterested over the last few weeks of the regular season, and perhaps understandably since there was nothing to play for in particular, the Warriors are ready to wake up. The other contest is more complex and head-scratching for the Spurs. Clearly, there\u2019s friction or at least a major wedge between Kawhi Leonard and the Spurs although nobody knows how it arrived to this point and the extent of the damage and where it\u2019s going. Or maybe, nobody\u2019s willing or able to explain. It\u2019s not even evident that Kawhi is the problem, or that he has a personal beef with coach Gregg Popovich and the organization, since he doesn\u2019t talk publicly or reveals much when he does. Yes, it\u2019s complicated. Here\u2019s the facts: Leonard has played only nine games this season, citing a quad injury which normally needs a half-season to heal properly based on similar injuries. While the Spurs are here preparing for Game 2 on Monday, he\u2019s in New York doing rehab work. The Spurs medical staff cleared him two months ago but Leonard sought a second opinion and his experts haven\u2019t given the green light, so he\u2019s working out on his own. Also, Leonard has one year left on his current contract and, because he made the All-NBA team last season, he qualifies for the \u201csuper max\u201d extension which the Spurs can give him this summer. Here\u2019s what\u2019s fuzzy: Leonard\u2019s communication with Popovich and the staff has, by all indications, been professional and pure if limited and murky. That\u2019s because Leonard\u2019s inner circle of family members aren\u2019t on the same page, it seems, with the Spurs. And his future as the successor to David Robinson and Tim Duncan in San Antonio, which once seemed like a layup, isn\u2019t so automatic anymore. That\u2019s what led Popovich to say this, on the eve of Game 2, regarding Leonard\u2019s status for the Warriors: \u201cYou\u2019ll have to ask Kawhi and his group that question.\u201d And this: \u201cSo far they say that he\u2019s not ready to go. So, we can\u2019t do anything until that happens, then we would have to decide what\u2019s going on from there.\u201d They. His group. We. Not exactly a response or words that projects harmony and understanding and a kinship. A report by Yahoo! Sports on Sunday revealed that Leonard will not be available for the rest of the playoffs. What\u2019s weird is Leonard was exactly the type of superstar the Spurs were accustomed to having: Someone quiet, who didn\u2019t care about his \u201cbrand,\u201d unselfish with teammates, coachable and respectful to the demanding Popovich, excellent all-around on the floor, rose to the occasion in the post-season and single-minded in a pursuit of a championship. Also, just a few weeks ago Popovich refused to question Leonard\u2019s desire to resume playing; after all, Leonard was a Finals MVP and never hid his desire to compete. What happened? How much of this situation is due to Leonard\u2019s contract extension? Usually, money plays a role in these matters, either a sneaky one or obvious one. Also, there\u2019s no guarantee that Popovich will get the OK from ownership to pay a super max in excess of $200 million to Leonard after such a weird and unsettled season. Even before money is discussed, the Spurs must ask him and \u201chis people\u201d this fundamental and direct question this summer: Do you want to be here? If so, the two sides must begin to lay out the ground rules and forge a better understanding about his injury, and also map out his financial future. If not, then the Lakers and Clippers (Leonard is from LA) will likely receive a call, among others. His value is obvious; a pesty and aggressive 6-7 swingman, Leonard might be the best man-to-man defender in basketball and improved his shooting range enough to be a top-10 scorer. But that\u2019s an issue for July. In the meantime, here in the playoffs, Leonard is the most important player and he hasn\u2019t broken a sweat. The Spurs are undermanned against the biggest force of the last five years, and that could make for a quick series. \u201cThey\u2019re missing No. 2,\u201d said Durant, citing Leonard\u2019s jersey number. \u201cSo yeah, they look different from that aspect. They play the same way and it\u2019s always about the game. All the rest of that stuff doesn\u2019t matter to Pop and the rest of the players. That\u2019s why they\u2019ve had so much success over the years. And they play a good brand. They believe in each other and they don\u2019t beat themselves. It\u2019s a good combination to have but obviously they\u2019re missing their best player and we\u2019re just trying to take advantage of it.\u201d Without Leonard, there\u2019s no second source of offense next to LaMarcus Aldridge and the Spurs are leaning on past-their-prime players such as Rudy Gay, Manu Ginobili and Tony Parker. Without Leonard, Thompson shot 11 of 13 in Game 1 and had a number of open looks that he conceded he normally doesn\u2019t get against the Spurs. \u201cIt\u2019s a big difference,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cKawhi is MVP caliber. Not having him affects them drastically. It was always fun because he was one of the best defenders in the game. I took it as a challenge to have a great game with Kawhi covering me, knowing what he brings and the energy he uses on every possession. He\u2019s an amazing player on both sides of the ball.\u201d But right now, he\u2019s a ghost, a rumor, a person of the past and a non-factor when it matters most. That\u2019s never been said before about Kawhi Leonard and the post-season. Veteran NBA writer Shaun Powell has worked for newspapers and other publications for more than 25 years.

(We\u2019ll say that the Cleveland Cavaliers of the last two seasons are the exception to the rule, though it must be acknowledged that their championship season was the one in which they ranked in the top 10 defensively.) The Philadelphia 76ers, just two years after completing a season in which they lost 72 games, have become great on both ends of the floor. The Sixers ranked third defensively this season. J.J. Redick is their only starter shorter than 6-9 and size matters on that end of the floor. Ben Simmons was the rare rookie who made a positive impact defensively. But Game 1 of their first-round series against the Miami Heat, in addition to being the Sixers\u2019 17th straight win and their 24th win in 25 home games since Jan. 1, was the latest example of how big of a leap they\u2019ve made offensively over the last two months. The Sixers scored 130 points on just 98 possessions on Saturday, chewing up what was the seventh-ranked defense in the regular season. The 18-for-28 from 3-point range that the Sixers shot in the 130-103 victory is not sustainable. But even if all those shots aren\u2019t dropping, they won\u2019t be significantly easier to guard in Game 2 on Monday. \u201cThey play really, really fast,\u201d Heat center Kelly Olynyk said after his team allowed 74 points in the second half. \u201cA lot of stuff in transition. They just kept those shooters coming off staggered screens, non-stop, full speed and it\u2019s tough to guard when they got four shooters out there with Simmons handling the ball it\u2019s tough to help and pack the paint, get in the paint. \u201cThey\u2019re coming off making tough shots, throwing the ball back, other guys are making shots, Simmons is attacking, they\u2019re getting back cuts, trying to guard off screens. They play really fast, they execute really, really well.\u201d The Sixers have played faster since losing Joel Embiid to a facial fracture in late March. But they\u2019ve been playing with pace, moving bodies and moving the ball since the start of \u201cThe Process.\u201d This is the system that head coach Brett Brown has been developing for the last five years. For most of that time, he just didn\u2019t have the personnel to execute it well. But all those seasons at the bottom of the standings have resulted in an influx of talent. More talent has resulted in better execution, and suddenly, this team has become hard to stop. Without Embiid, Simmons is driving the bus. But a playmaker, no matter how talented, needs the right people around him. And as the Cavs and Golden State Warriors have taught us over the last few years, you can never have too much shooting in this league. Redick, sixth among active players in career 3-point percentage, was the Sixers\u2019 big addition in free agency last summer. Dario Saric was the most improved 3-point shooter in the league this season, and Robert Covington led the league in catch-and-shoot 3s. But it wasn\u2019t until February, when the Sixers added both Marco Belinelli and Ersan Ilyasova in the buyout market, that the offense really took off. When the Sixers signed Belinelli on Feb. 12, they ranked 14th in offensive efficiency, having scored 105 points per 100 possessions over their first 53 games. They had seen a big improvement from last season (when they ranked last offensively for the fourth straight year), but were still worse than average on that end of the floor. After the Belinelli addition (Ilyasova would sign two weeks later), they ranked fifth on offense, scoring more than 111 points per 100 possessions over their final 29 games. The Sixers were the only team that ranked in the top five in both offensive and defensive efficiency after the All-Star break. The defense has been there all season, and it helped the Sixers take the lead for good on Saturday with a 15-3 run early in the third quarter by holding the Heat scoreless on eight straight possessions. The offense, or at least its foundation, has been there all season too. The Sixers led the league in ball movement (passes per minute of possession) and ranked second in player movement (miles traveled per minute of possession). Last season, they led the league in both. This is who they are and who\u2019ve they\u2019ve been since Day 1 with Brown. \u201cWhat we did the first day of (training) camp is what we needed to win tonight,\u201d Brown said Saturday. \u201cPassing the ball, sharing the ball, playing downhill, understanding it\u2019s really the magic play in the playoffs. It\u2019s always about concepts and spacing and unselfish players.\u201d The Sixers recorded assists on 34 of their 45 baskets in Game 1. Belinelli, Ilyasova and Redick combined to score 70 points and that game-deciding run came with with Ilyasova \u2013 one more shooter around Simmons \u2013 starting the third quarter in place of Amir Johnson. Pace, space, ball movement, player movement, and lights-out shooting \u2014 it all came together in an incredible offensive display. But Brown began planning for this moment five years ago. And when he finally got the players talented enough to make his system work, he was ready to plug them in. \u201cWhether Ersan comes in or Marco comes in, that\u2019s who we are,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to coach here. And the guys have bought in. We play fast, we look for each other. The 3-point shot, without Joel, has become a real big part of our identity. We\u2019ll continue to do that. You have to do that or you won\u2019t win games when it matters.\u201d For the first time in six years, the Philadelphia 76ers have won a game that matters. And with how good they\u2019ve become on both ends of the floor, there will be more to come. John Schuhmann is a staff writer for NBA.com.

Better protect those chins, Pacers. One of the most dominant postseason players in NBA history, James is undefeated in Game 1 of any opening series, a perfect 12-0 since making his playoff debut with the Cavaliers back in 2006. James is a ridiculous 48-7 overall in the first round with seven sweeps, and his teams in Miami and Cleveland have ripped off 21 consecutive opening-round victories, a winning streak that stretches to 2012 in his second season with the Heat. Since rejoining the Cavs in 2015, he\u2019s 12-0 in Round 1. Facing him means an early exit. But while all those overbearing facts would seem to give Cleveland a huge advantage against Indiana in a best-of-seven Eastern Conference series that starts Sunday at Quicken Loans Arena, James isn\u2019t taking the Pacers lightly. They beat the Cavs three times during the regular season and guard Victor Oladipo and Co. have enough talent to maybe upset the No. 4 seed. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a very good matchup,\u201d James said Saturday. \u201cIt\u2019s 4-5 for a reason. Both teams played good ball at times throughout the regular season. Obviously their season, from the outside looking in, was more productive than ours because of what they went through in the offseason. But we went through a lot in the offseason as well. It\u2019s a good matchup and we look forward to the challenge.\u201d Following a regular season that went up, down and sideways for the Cavs, the postseason has finally arrived. It\u2019s when James shines most. The 33-year-old is aiming to make his eighth straight Finals, a feat only accomplished by a handful of Boston Celtics in the 1960s. The three-time champ is coming off perhaps his finest regular season, and there\u2019s no reason to think he won\u2019t be at his best in April, May and probably June. \u201cLeBron is a freak of his own,\u201d said Oladipo, who has blossomed in his first year with Indiana. \u201cHe\u2019s the best player in the world. You could give it (the MVP award) to him every year, but it wouldn\u2019t be fair to everyone else.\u201d James wasn\u2019t fair to the Pacers in last year\u2019s playoffs. He averaged 32 points, nine rebounds, nine assists, three steals and two blocks as Cleveland swept Indiana en route to a third straight conference crown. It\u2019s hard to imagine it being that easy this year as the Pacers are a more well-balanced squad. In Oladipo they have a player capable of taking over a game, but James knows the ropes better than anyone this time of year. \u201cHe definitely understands that, going to The Finals, that the quicker you can get a series over and get some rest is the best way to do it,\u201d Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. \u201cSo our guys have to understand that we\u2019re going to see the best (team) at their best.\u201d His teammates and opponents may change from year to year in the postseason. James stays the same. \u201cMy responsibility has been the same for quite a while now,\u201d he said. \u201cGo out and try to dominate.\u201d SECOND OPTION: For the first time in four years, James won\u2019t have Kyrie Irving by his side in the playoffs. With Irving gone, Kevin Love has become Cleveland\u2019s second-most important player. Although the Cavs aren\u2019t the slam-dunk favorite as they\u2019ve been in the past to win the East, Love is as confident as ever. \u201cI always feel like when we take the floor we\u2019re going to win every game,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re a really tough out. We\u2019re going to be a tough team to beat in four games and we have the best player in the world and a lot of guys that are hungry to go out and prove what they can do.\u201d MYLES TO GO: Pacers big man Myles Turner struggled so badly down the stretch he asked McMillan to play him in the regular-season finale. It didn\u2019t help. Turner\u2019s struggles continued as he went 1 of 8 from the field and finished with two points in 20 minutes. Turner is now 5 of 26 overall, 0 for 9 on 3-pointers. He had 11 rebounds in Indiana\u2019s last four games. He\u2019s grateful for a fresh start. \u201cThey need me to come out and be the aggressive Myles, like I\u2019ve done during a couple stretches this season,\u201d he said. \u201cI need to score points, rebound and block shots.\u201d REUNITED RIVALS: Lance Stephenson developed a reputation for getting under James\u2019 skin during the Pacers-Heat rivalry. He\u2019s still doing it. Stephenson, perhaps best known for blowing in James\u2019 ear during the 2014 conference finals, baited James into a technical foul earlier this year. This time, though, Stephenson claims he has no plans to rankle King James. \u201cHe\u2019s a tough player, he\u2019s always challenging me,\u201d Stephenson said. \u201cI think your mindset has to be to stop him and to want to win against him. Everybody in the league wants to beat him.\u201d  \u2014  AP Sports Writer Michael Marot in Indianapolis contributed to this report."},{"id":46992,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/playoff-opener-golden-state-warriors-gets-defensive-against-spurs","date":"2018-04-15","title":"In opener, defending champion Golden State Warriors re-introduce themselves in rout of San Antonio Spur","content":"OAKLAND, CALIF. \u2014 It is generally accepted that the Warriors will perspire some, feel a degree of burn in their lungs, receive an urgency slap in the face and get pushed toward the edge of their defending championship throne once they play a team from Texas. Just not this team from Texas. No, not the Spurs, at least that\u2019s what the hunch and the outset of this first-round playoff series says. Common sense, too, wants to chime in and declare the Spurs without Kawhi Leonard are just standing in the way, albeit proudly, of the Warriors\u2019 path to greater things in the post-season. And so, the long and antsy wait for the anticipated and projected Warriors vs. Houston Rockets showdown in the West began in earnest Saturday when the Warriors breezed from jump ball to buzzer against San Antonio, and also torpedoed the notion that they\u2019re somehow vulnerable (at least for now). The playoff tipoff was all about the Warriors re-establishing their muscle flex and their defense and most importantly, their aura, even with Steph Curry still out and ailing, because the rest of the NBA was watching. That\u2019s what a 113-92 wipeout Game 1 win at Oracle Arena accomplished, if nothing else. The combination of the Spurs being overmatched and the Warriors needing to put on a more menacing face than what they showed the last month of the regular season delivered the predictable result: A smackdown. Or, as Spurs coach Gregg Popovich put it: \u201cGot our ass kicked.\u201d Too much Kevin Durant, the sneaky elevation of Andre Iguodala to the starting point guard spot, a JaVale McGee sighting and Klay Thompson getting swishy was exactly what the Warriors needed and received. Seriously, though: Anything less would\u2019ve been a big surprise. The Warriors couldn\u2019t afford to stay locked into the season-ending fog that turned coach Steve Kerr\u2019s hair a lighter shade of gray and created the perception of a fat, too-satisfied winner of two championships in three years. Most likely, they were merely victims of human nature: While going 7-10 down the stretch , the Warriors simply grew bored with the meaningless late season, especially once Curry hurt his knee on March 23 . Seriously, what was left to accomplish, other than to stay healthy? This team was created and molded for the sole purpose of winning in June, not for placing importance on, say, drop-kicking the Sacramento Kings on April Fools. \u201cWe\u2019re a championship ballclub and we know what it takes to win this time of year,\u201d said Draymond Green, applying the perspective. \u201cYou heard, \u2018The Warriors lost it, they\u2019re not together, they\u2019re not the same team without Steph, blase, blase, blase, blah blah blah.\u2019 Well, we know what we\u2019re capable of. There have been series where we\u2019ve won without Kevin, without myself, without our head coach. A lot of people forgot.\u201d In case you\u2019re one of the people Draymond was referring to, here\u2019s a refresher course, courtesy of Game 1: Durant is very long and tough to defend, Thompson usually doesn\u2019t miss when he has three feet of separation from his defender, Iggy always earns his fat paycheck in springtime, and as for McGee?  \u201cHe\u2019s very tall,\u201d said Kerr. Actually, Kerr wasn\u2019t purposely trying to troll his starting center, just stating the obvious when it comes to defending Spurs leading scorer LaMarcus Aldridge. McGee brings four more inches and therefore made it tough for Aldridge, who managed only 14 points and was mainly a ghost. With Aldridge on lockdown, the Warriors\u2019 D had accomplished its main mission, because the Spurs lack a secondary source of punch. What, is Rudy Gay going to turn back the clock? Manu Ginobili? Tony Parker? Because that\u2019s what needs to happen for San Antonio. Without it, well, unfortunately for the Spurs, Kawhi wasn\u2019t limping through that door Sunday. What irritated Kerr was how the Warriors dialed down their defensive intensity in the weeks leading into the playoffs. They spotted 126 points each to the Pelicans and Pacers , and in the season final did a complete no-show, getting spanked by 40 courtesy of Utah . Remember, the Warriors constantly ranked among the better defensive teams during their multiple runs to the NBA Finals. As coaches tend to do in these matters, Kerr jeopardized his vocal chords a few times while trying to get the message across in the disinterested locker room. But deep down, did anyone buy the notion of the Warriors suddenly forgetting how to play defense? With the second-best record in the West secured, and first place conceded to Houston, weren\u2019t they just tapping their toes until the first round? Is that such a crime? Wouldn\u2019t that be understandable, and wise on some levels, given the risk of something bad happening to a hamstring? Anyway, Kerr barely uncrossed his legs on the bench Sunday; no need to scold a team that held the Spurs to 40 percent shooting and claimed the rebounding edge by 21 and never felt threatened. \u201cWe finally got back to defending,\u201d said Kerr. He made sure of that, by inserting Iguodala, his best all-around defender, into the starting lineup and also using McGee extensively instead of Zaza Pachulia. Iggy spread his limbs all over the floor, guarding bigs and smalls, switching on the screen and generally being a pest to the other team, as he generally is this time of year. \u201cI just wanted to put our best defensive lineup on the floor from the beginning,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe last month or so our defense had been subpar. You can\u2019t win in this league unless you defend. You could feel the intensity right from the start. We set a good tone.\u201d To be fair, the awakening of the Warriors\u2019 defense will receive a more accurate measure if and when they advance beyond the Spurs and face, for example, the Blazers with Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum and of course the turbocharged Rockets with James Harden and Chris Paul and all those three-point slingers. But until then, wrapping up the Spurs will serve as necessary preparation. Less worry was the Warriors on the other end of the floor, where Durant assumed the lead and took 17 shots, scoring 24 points. More efficient was Thompson, who missed only twice in 13 shots and finished with 27 points. All of this was necessary with Curry not expected back for the first round; he just received the green light to press the accelerator during rehab and begin lateral movements. If the Warriors, a top-10 team in both offensive and defensive efficiency, continue to get this kind of killer balance, there\u2019ll be some long nights upcoming for the Spurs and a quick series as well. \u201cWe were not as ready to face a team like them,\u201d said Ginobili. \u201cThey were much better than us. Klay got away from us many times. Overall, they were so much better in every aspect that we had no shot. We\u2019ve got to regroup, feel hurt and desperate, got to be smarter \u2026 We understand we\u2019re not favorites. We\u2019re underdogs. To get a win here we\u2019ve got to overachieve. We got to do better than we can.\u201d It\u2019s too bad that the Kawhi Situation continues to follow the Spurs like a dark cloud. He remains stymied by a quad injury that apparently hasn\u2019t healed enough for his liking. The Spurs with Kawhi and the Warriors without Curry would tip the scales in this series toward being somewhat level, or at least invite some suspense. Without Kawhi, the Spurs are shooting spitballs at a tank. Guts and hard work and good coaching can only go so far against the suddenly-refocused and playoff-locked Warriors. So, yes, the Warriors set out to re-introduce themselves and did so Sunday. \u201cWe want to make a statement in Game 2 as well,\u201d said Thompson. \u201cWe hobbled to the playoffs but we know how good we are and what it takes in the post season to win. When our intensity and focus are high, we\u2019re tough to beat.\u201d Well, tough for one team in Texas. We\u2019ll see about the other soon enough.

With a trade for Chris Paul last summer and the addition of additional veterans, the Rockets went all in behind MVP candidate James Harden. And at the conclusion of the regular season, the Rockets look smart for doing so. While the Warriors have dealt with the hangover of three straight trips to The Finals, the Rockets have been the best team in the league, winning a franchise-record 65 games with a potent offense and an improved defense. A meeting with the champs in the conference finals might seem inevitable, but the Rockets won\u2019t have an easy path through the first two rounds. In fact, their first round opponent is a team that was in fourth place in the tough Western Conference before losing its best player for six weeks. Jimmy Butler is back and the Minnesota Timberwolves are back in the postseason after they put an end to the second longest playoff drought in NBA history with an overtime victory in Game 82 . This is the only first round series between two top-five offenses, but it\u2019s a contrast in styles, the team that took the most 3-pointers vs. the team that took the fewest.

And tiebreakers gave them the 4 seed and home-court advantage in their first round series with the Utah Jazz. The Jazz have exceeded expectations, recovering from the loss of Gordon Hayward and a slow start to win 29 of their final 35 games.

Might the league add the concept to its playoff format, formalizing a one-and-done round the way major league baseball did in 2012 with the addition of its wild-card games? \u201cIt continued interest,\u201d NBA commissioner Adam Silver said at a news conference Friday evening. \u201cThere have been proposals that the league has been looking at over the last several weeks.\u201d Silver said the idea has been raised before with the league\u2019s Competition Committee and discussed at a previous Board of Governors meeting. He said he expects it will come up again when the franchise representatives meet again in July in Las Vegas. A play-in round of short series or single-game elimination has been rattling around the NHL for a while, generating support from some of hockey\u2019s general managers . But the NBA, like the NHL, already qualifies more than half its teams for the playoffs. Baseball, even with the added layer of wild-card games, still has only 10 out of 30 teams involved in postseason play. There also is a feeling among some MLB critics that a single game at the end of the 162-game regular season diminishes the accomplishment of the three division winners in the National and American Leagues. What played out between the Timberwolves and the Nuggets was organic, the result of the two Northwest Division teams tying with 46-35 records through their first 81 games. They just happened to be scheduled to meet in the season finale for both clubs, and the overtime thriller \u2013 with Minnesota ending the league\u2019s longest-active playoff drought (2004) by winning, 112-106 \u2013 was a highlight on a night that already offered the drama of first-round matchups being determined on the fly. Whether orchestrating an annual event pitting, say, the eighth- and ninth-place teams in each conference and matching the enthusiasm and TV audience of Wolves-Nuggets would be in question. But Silver sounded game. \u201cThe answer is \u2018yes\u2019 for me,\u201d the commissioner said. \u201cIt was an incredibly exciting game and it does open up those possibilities that we could do something more formalized, but certainly a play-in type of format.\u201d Being on the brink of the 2018 playoffs put a couple other topics in play both at the Governors meeting and at Silver\u2019s media session. Three of the East playoff teams \u2013 the Heat and the Bucks at 44-38, the Wizards at 43-39 \u2013 remain alive even as the 46-36 Nuggets go home. But talk of qualifying the teams with the 16 best records regardless of conference, or of seeding the eight East and eight West clubs 1-through-16, remains just that: talk. \u201cI think we\u2019re at the point right now where nobody has a better solution,\u201d Silver said. \u201cAs we\u2019ve talked about before, it\u2019s a balance of travel issues vs. conference issues vs. how the schedule should be set. \u2026 We\u2019re satisfied with where we are, because when you look at the alternative, the travel becomes overwhelming.\u201d Also, with the NBA\u2019s most emotional time of year coming in the form of 15 best-of-seven series between now and the middle of June, Silver gave an update on the player-referee friction that drew attention earlier this season. The referees and the players held a small \u201csummit\u201d meeting at All-Star Weekend in Los Angeles in February, while the league tackled the issue on a separate front. Michelle Johnson, NBA senior VP, head of referee operations, and longtime game official Monty McCutchen, in his new role as head of referee development and training, have visited with players and coaches from each of the 30 teams in a series of \u201crespect for the game\u201d meetings, accompanied by other league executives. \u201cThe reports back I\u2019ve gotten, both from Monty and Michelle and directly from the teams, is that they\u2019ve been very constructive,\u201d Silver said, \u201cand they\u2019ve been very appreciative that we\u2019ve taken the time to have those discussions and, again, to clarify some of the misunderstandings. But ultimately, I don\u2019t think there are any shortcuts.\u201d Conversations with Michele Roberts, executive director of the National Basketball Players Association deepens Silver\u2019s conviction that player-referee dealings ultimately are about relationships and professional respect. \u201cI feel pretty good going into the playoffs that we\u2019ve made some real progress there,\u201d Silver said. In other business at the spring BOG meetings: \u201cWe recognize that our goal was to put the best competition on the floor, and it\u2019s balanced against legitimate rebuilding of some teams,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I know we\u2019re not there yet, and I certainly wasn\u2019t satisfied.\u201d Changes in the lottery beginning in 2019 will flatten the odds and broaden the number of teams vying for the top picks, and Silver is hoping that improves the situation. \u201cThere can only be so much cajoling out of the league office,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those things that the last place I want to go as the commissioner of the league office is to start dictating minutes and which particular players should be playing at what points in the game. \u201cI recognize that the incentives are not aligned right now. \u2026 My sense is we\u2019re still going to have some work to do.\u201d Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

But this is clearly the worst team that has surrounded James since his move to Miami in 2010. Going back to 2008-09, no James team had outscored its opponents by less than 3.2 points per game. This Cavs team was just a plus-0.9 per game. The last team to outscore its opponents by less than a point per game and reach The Finals was the 1980-81 Houston Rockets (plus-0.3). The Cavs had drama, trades and injuries disrupting their season, and they never got an extended look at their new roster, with injuries lingering through the last game of the season. But their defense was bad throughout and they\u2019ve run out of time in regard to working out the kinks. Their first round opponent is the same as it was last year, except that it\u2019s different. The Indiana Pacers traded their best player last summer \u2026 and got better. They were clearly the most pleasant surprise this season, grabbing the fifth seed with improvement on both ends of the floor. The Cavs may be a bigger first-round favorite than the three teams that finished ahead of them in the East standings. LeBron James has never lost a first round series and hasn\u2019t lost a first round game since 2012. We\u2019ll see if the Pacers are good enough (or if the Cavs are bad enough) to change that.

Philadelphia regained possession with five seconds left after an inbounds pass attempt by Boston\u2019s Bill Russell hit one of the wires that ran down from the ceiling of Boston Garden and helped support the baskets in those days. Hall of Fame guard Hal Greer prepared to toss the ball inbounds under his own basket. The logical target seemed to be massive Wilt Chamberlain in the low post, but Russell fronted Chamberlain and took away that option. K.C. Jones, guarding Greer, leaped along the baseline and frantically waved his arms to distract him as the five seconds ticked away. Havlicek had taken a position several feet off the direct line between Greer and Chet Walker, making it look like Walker was open when he really wasn\u2019t. After counting off a couple of seconds in his head, Havlicek sneaked a peek over his shoulder at Greer just as he prepared to release the ball.

Today, they officially ruled him out for Game 1 against the Miami Heat. Embiid, as well as reserve forward Timoth\u00e9 Luwawu-Cabarrot (right knee patellar tendinitis), are both listed as out for Saturday on the team\u2019s official game notes . Sixers coach Brett Brown said earlier Friday on \u201cThe Dan Patrick Show\u201d that barring \u201csomething remarkable\u201d, his All-Star big man would not suit up. Embiid has been out of the Sixers\u2019 lineup since March 28, when he suffered a broken bone around his left eye in a collision with teammate Markelle Fultz. Here\u2019s Brown\u2019s comments from today: Embiid, who has since been cleared of a concussion suffered from the accidental headbutt, had surgery on March 31. The 7-footer wore a mask during pregame shooting drills and would need one in the postseason. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready to play,\u201d he said. \u201cIt still doesn\u2019t feel all the way right.\u201d The Sixers clearly need their big man if they\u2019re going to make a run in the Eastern Conference playoffs. Embiid leads the team with 22.9 points and 11 rebounds in 63 games, helping Philly clinch its first playoff berth since 2012. Embiid said on Wednesday it\u2019s \u201cunlikely but still a chance,\u201d he plays in Game 1. \u201cI want to play but right now I feel like I\u2019m not ready yet,\u201d Embiid said. \u201cIt\u2019s getting there. I\u2019ve got to keep working every day. With the way it\u2019s been progressing, I\u2019m hopeful I\u2019ll be back soon.\u201d He said the eye was still swollen and he doesn\u2019t suffer from blurred vision. \u201cI\u2019m actually surprised how fast it is getting better,\u201d he said. The Sixers have won a team-record 16 straight games and wrapped up the No. 3 seed in the Eastern Conference with their home victory over the Milwaukee Bucks on Wednesday night . Embiid said he hoped the NBA would allow him to wear a black mask that made him look like the 76ers\u2019 version of Zorro. \u201cWith a clear mask, it kind of feels like there\u2019s so much reflection, and I can\u2019t really see,\u201d he said. \u201cWith the black mask, it kind of gives you a clear vision. Hopefully, it gets approved and I get to play in it.\u201d Embiid has yet to participate in any contact drills and has limited his activities to light workouts. Embiid is used to sitting out with the Sixers \u2014 he missed his first two seasons with a broken foot and played just 31 games last season because of a knee injury. The Sixers had been cautious this season and initially held him out of the back end of consecutive games on the schedule. But he stayed healthy until the freak injury and developed into one of the league\u2019s top defenders (1.8 blocks, 38 double-doubles). On Wednesday, Embiid stumped for Brown to win NBA coach of the year, teammate Ben Simmons for Kia Rookie of the Year and himself, naturally, to win the KIA Defensive Player of the Year Award. \u201cI feel I\u2019ve been the best defensive player in the league this year,\u201d Embiid said. \u201cWe have the resume. We won a lot of games. We\u2019re a top-three defensive team in the league and a lot of that speaks for itself. Last year, I kind of had a knock on me for not playing a lot of games. This year, when I actually do play a lot of games, I don\u2019t know what excuse they\u2019re going to find next.\u201d Anything else? \u201cI should be first-team All-NBA, too,\u201d he said, smiling behind his mask. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m best the center in the league.\u201d Information from The Associated Press was used in this report. * * *"},{"id":47178,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/stephen-curry-golden-state-warriors-report-targeting-western-semifinals-return","date":"2018-04-13","title":"Report: Stephen Curry targeting return in Western Conference semifinals","content":" The Golden State Warriors\u2019 playoff quest for another championship is starting without star guard Stephen Curry .

(AP) \u2014 Kemba Walker knows his future with the Charlotte Hornets is up in the air. But the two-time All-Star said he\u2019s not going to spend the offseason dwelling on where he\u2019ll be playing next season. Walker has one year remaining on a four-year, $48 million contract and while he\u2019d like to remain with the Hornets \u2013 where he\u2019s the franchise\u2019s all-time leading scorer \u2013 he knows nothing is for certain after a second straight non-playoff season prompted team owner Michael Jordan to hire Mitch Kupchak as the new general manager. That means that if Kupchak decides a massive rebuilding project is in order, Walker could be the first one out the door given he\u2019s the team\u2019s biggest bargaining chip and has a favorable contract. \u201cI have no idea,\u201d Walker said Wednesday regarding his future after Charlotte\u2019s regular season finale. \u201cThat is out of my control. I am just going to focus on getting better as a player. That is really all you can do. I don\u2019t know what they are going to do.\u201d The 6-foot-1 Walker is coming off three tremendous seasons in Charlotte where he has averaged more than 20 points and five assists per game. Walker, who led Connecticut to a national championship, has never won a playoff series since his arrival in Charlotte six seasons ago. Kupchak offered no hints over the team\u2019s plans with Walker during an introductory press conference on Tuesday. \u201cMy understanding is he is great in the locker room and great in the community,\u2019 Kupchak said. \u201cI don\u2019t know why you wouldn\u2019t want to have a player like that going forward.\u201d Other things to know about the Hornets heading into the offseason: NOT GOING THERE: While some other star players have been outspoken about what their team needs personnel-wise to get better, Walker refused to go down that path. \u201cI don\u2019t want to answer that question because it could get real ugly,\u201d Walker said. \u201cI will leave it up to the guys upstairs.\u201d CLIFFORD\u2019S FUTURE: Coach Steve Clifford said he felt this was the most talented team he\u2019s had with the Hornets, which made finishing 10 games under .500 all the more disappointing. His future with the team remains uncertain after his teams have failed to get out of the first round of the playoffs the last five seasons. \u201cThe NBA is about winning in the playoffs, so if you want to look back at our five years I do feel very good about where we are and how we are perceived versus where it was five years ago,\u201d Clifford said. \u201cWe made great gains. To be relevant and respected in this league is a long way from where we started.\u201d HOWARD\u2019S BIG SEASON: Hornets center Dwight Howard enjoyed an impressive bounce back season with Charlotte individually, averaging 16.6 points, 12.5 rebounds and 1.6 blocked shots in 81 games after struggling to find his way in Houston and Atlanta the previous two years resulting in him being traded twice. \u201cThis year really showed a lot of people this guy really takes this game seriously,\u201d said Howard, who finished with a franchise-record 53 double-doubles. PLAYING WITH HOWARD: While Howard excelled, several players had to learn to adjust their games to play with him, including Nic Batum. He excelled with Cody Zeller in the pick-and-roll the previous seasons, but Batum spent more time dumping the ball to Howard in the low post and said he had to adjust his own game to play with Howard. \u201cI thought I feed him the ball a lot inside and play through him because he\u2019s so big and has so much potential inside,\u201d Batum said. \u201cIf you have a guy like that you have to use him. \u2026 Did I give up a lot of my game? Yes, maybe. But I don\u2019t care as long as it is good for the team.\u201d HORNETS LACKED SPIRIT: One overriding theme of Clifford\u2019s post-season press conference was that he felt his team lacked \u201cspirit\u201d this season. \u201cWe\u2019ve always had spirit,\u201d Clifford said, \u201cbut we didn\u2019t have that this year.

It\u2019s going to take a while to get there. Getting starting on a painful rebuilding process, the Hawks stumbled through their worst season since 2005, finishing 24-58 to end a 10-year streak of playoff appearances. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in the playoffs every time,\u201d point guard Dennis Schroder said. \u201cTo have a season like that, it was kind of tough for everyone.\u201d Atlanta closed out the season Tuesday night with a loss to the Philadelphia 76ers, who have provided the template for all teams going through a massive overhaul. Just two years removed from a 10-72 debacle, the Sixers are a 50-plus-win team headed to the playoffs with one of the NBA\u2019s most exciting young rosters . \u201cThat\u2019s definitely something we\u2019re going to try to model after in a sense, just having that young talent, building and getting better every year, and getting into the playoffs,\u201d said Hawks forward John Collins, who had a promising rookie season. In his first year as general manager, Travis Schlenk began stripping the roster of veteran players, stocking up on draft picks and clearing out salary cap space that can be used down the line . With only seven guaranteed contracts on the books for next season \u2013 and center Dewayne Dedmon likely to opt out for a better deal elsewhere \u2013 it figures to be another offseason of jarring change. All that losing can make it difficult to come to work each day. But coach Mike Budenholzer got pretty much the most he could out of his limited roster, sending out a team that competed hard every night and rarely got blown out. The Hawks lost 21 games by less than 10 points, while only seven defeats were decided by 20 or more. \u201cWe showed a glimpse of what we could be,\u201d said second-year forward Taurean Prince, another of the building blocks for the future. \u201cWe made a lot teams play harder than they wanted to play.\u201d Some takeaways from the Hawks\u2019 season: SCHRODER\u2019S STUMBLES: Presumably the centerpiece of the Atlanta\u2019s rebuild, Schroder is still dealing with his arrest on a misdemeanor battery arrest just before the start of the season and continues to show signs of immaturity despite this being his fifth year in the league. \u201cTo be the leader of any NBA team, it\u2019s a blessing,\u201d Schroder said. \u201cBut it\u2019s tough to get up in the morning, go to practice and see 12, 13 guys looking up to you.\u201d COLLINS EMERGES: Schlenk\u2019s first draft pick was a winner. After being selected at No. 19, Collins quickly claimed a prominent role with his enormous athleticism and confident presence. Only 20, he should have plenty of upside as he improves his overall game. Prince, the top pick in 2016, also had a solid season. He averaged 14 points a game, improved greatly from beyond the 3-point arc and can expect an even bigger role in the years to come. AUDITION TIME: The Hawks used this season to audition several G League prospects and rejects from other teams, hopeful that their emphasis on player development might yield a few diamonds in the rough. The most promising finds were point guard Isaiah Taylor and forward Damion Lee, who both showed they might have a future in the NBA if they continue to improve. MORE ROOKIES: The upcoming draft will be a major step in the rebuilding process. In addition to their lottery pick, the Hawks could have two other first-round selections acquired through trades as well as a choice early in the second round. Schlenk could package that bounty of picks in a trade or stockpile the roster with even more young talent. Whatever he decides, it\u2019s imperative that the Hawks get maximum value this summer to keep the rebuilding process on track. BUDENHOLZER\u2019S FUTURE: The Hawks coach seemed willing to go along with Schenk\u2019s plan, even though it surely guarantees several dismal seasons before there\u2019s any tangible signs of improvement. Now the question is: Will Budenholzer stick around for the long haul? Already, there have been reports that he might be interested in another job with a team that has a better chance of winning right away. Considering the dynamics in Atlanta \u2013 Budenholzer guided the Hawks to a franchise-record 60 wins just three years ago, only to be stripped of his power over personnel matters after a several questionable moves \u2013 it\u2019s not hard to envision him moving on. Coach Bud was once THE man in Atlanta. Now, he answers to Schlenk, who has full authority to strip this team down before he builds it back up again. \u201cI love what I do. I love this team. I\u2019m focused on what we just did and how we can get better going forward,\u201d Budenholzer said Wednesday, without necessarily denying that he might be willing to look at other options."},{"id":40897,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/injuries-lack-continuity-lead-dismal-memphis-grizzlies-season","date":"2018-04-13","title":"Injuries, lack of continuity lead to dismal Memphis Grizzlies season","content":"MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 A season that opened with such promise for the Grizzlies wound up as one of the franchise\u2019s worst since moving to Memphis. The Grizzlies couldn\u2019t have started better than 5-1, sitting near the top of the Western Conference standings with a pair of early wins over the Houston Rockets and a home victory over the Golden State Warriors. By the end, the Grizzlies\u2019 hopes of an eighth straight postseason appearance turned to hopefully landing a top two pick in June\u2019s NBA draft. When the injuries started, most notably what wound up a season-ending left heel-Achilles tendon injury to point guard Mike Conley, the season imploded. And kept getting worse through multiple double-digit losing streaks. The first long slide cost coach David Fizdale his job after a short tenure and leaving interim coach J.B. Bickerstaff at the helm. The change didn\u2019t help as the Grizzlies lost 19 straight between early February and mid-March \u2013 the longest skid since the team moved to Memphis in 2001. \u201cIt\u2019s been a challenging year, obviously,\u201d center Marc Gasol said. Asked if he had ever endured a 19-game skid, Dillon Brooks, a rookie from Oregon, said, \u201cThere\u2019s not enough games in college to go through a losing streak like that.\u201d Actually, there are. But rock bottom for the Grizzlies came with the largest defeat in franchise history came with a 61-point loss in Charlotte in late March. \u201cIt\u2019s been difficult,\u201d Bickerstaff said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t what we expected when we sat down over the summer and put our plan together and went through training camp. So, there\u2019s always that shock value.\u201d  Some things looking at the Grizzlies\u2019 season and the future: RARELY THIS BAD IN MEMPHIS: The Grizzlies\u2019 win over Detroit in their home finale \u2013 their 22nd of the season \u2013 kept Memphis from notching the worst record since the team moved to Memphis for the 2001-02 season. The Grizzlies had two other seasons with 22 wins since relocating. So how did the Grizzlies deal with all the losses? \u201cRed wine helps at night,\u201d Gasol said. BICKERSTAFF BACK? Bickerstaff was associated head coach when Fizdale was fired in late-November. Bickerstaff says he has discussed his future with management and would like to return next season. \u201cI feel like we have started something,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have started to build a culture. You want to be part of a group that you like. I think there\u2019s going to be a tremendous bump next year, health permitting. I would love to be a part of it.\u201d OWNERSHIP RESOLUTION: One huge offseason concern was answered this week when majority owner Robert Pera said he would retain controlling interest. Minority partners Steve Kaplan and Robert Straus had invoked a buy-sell option in November. That forced Pera to buy out the shares of the other two or sell his interest to them. Pera told select season-ticket holders Monday he was retaining control of the Grizzlies, a move that should provide stability this offseason for Bickerstaff, front office personnel and the draft. DRAFT PICKS: Memphis hasn\u2019t capitalized on draft choices often even when blessed with a high choice. The franchise picked Hasheem Thabeet with the No. 2 pick in 2009, a player who never lived up to his potential. Beyond that, the best first-round choice has been Conley, the fourth overall choice in 2007. The Grizzlies did get serviceable play from a pair of second-round picks last summer in Brooks and Ivan Rabb out of California when forced into greater roles by injuries. INJURIES: Not only did Conley get hurt, but replacements such as Andrew Harrison and Mario Chalmers also suffered injuries. Chandler Parsons played in only 36 games missing 32 games with various knee problems and not counting the nights of Memphis simply sat him for \u201crest.\u201d The strangest situation involved Tyreke Evans, Memphis\u2019 offensive threat when shut down before the trade deadline in anticipation of a deal involving the guard and his expiring contract. But the Grizzlies never consummated a deal. Evans returned for six more games, and has not been with the team for \u201cpersonal reasons\u201d since scoring 16 points in the 61-point loss at Charlotte on March 22."},{"id":40911,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/john-paxson-insists-rebuilding-chicago-bulls-are-better-spot","date":"2018-04-13","title":"John Paxson insists rebuilding Chicago Bulls are in better spot","content":"CHICAGO (AP) \u2014 John Paxson insisted the Chicago Bulls are in a good position. And the Bulls\u2019 top executive hopes they are never in this spot again. \u201cWe did this year what we felt was in the long-term best interests of the Bulls,\u201d Paxson said Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s not a situation that any of us want to ever be in again. It goes against everything as a competitive person that you believe in, but it\u2019s the way the system is set up. To be very honest, we believe we\u2019ve done it the right way.\u201d The Bulls went 27-55, their worst record since the 2003-04 season, and missed the playoffs for the second time in three years. But they are staying the course after going all-in on rebuilding. Paxson, Chicago\u2019s executive vice president of basketball operations, praised coach Fred Hoiberg and said he will \u201cabsolutely\u201d return for a fourth season. He said most of the roster will be back \u201cbecause we\u2019re headed in the right direction\u201d and called this \u201cas important a summer as we\u2019ve had in a very long time.\u201d\u2018 Here are some things to know heading into the offseason: PIECES IN PLACE: The Bulls believe they set themselves up for long-term success when they traded Jimmy Butler to Minnesota for Zach LaVine, Kris Dunn and Lauri Markkanen on draft night last year. All three players they landed showed promise, with Markkanen emerging as one of the league\u2019s top rookies. Throw in a lottery pick as well as another first-rounder this year and the Bulls believe they are positioning themselves to make a jump in the Eastern Conference. LOCKING IN LAVINE: The Bulls didn\u2019t give up Butler only to let LaVine go as a restricted free agent. But there could be some interesting negotiations. Paxson said general manager Gar Forman will talk to LaVine\u2019s agent \u201cat the appropriate time.\u201d \u201cI think the market has tightened up a little bit the last couple years,\u201d Paxson said. \u201cBut we obviously value Zach a lot. We think he\u2019s a part of our future, but he has the opportunity to explore things. The two-time slam dunk champion missed the first 42 games while recovering from a torn ACL in the left knee that he suffered with Minnesota and sat out the final 14 because of tendinitis in the knee. LaVine flashed his explosiveness but clearly had some rust to knock off when he was available, averaging 16.7 points in 24 games. For now, he\u2019s looking forward to a summer without rehab. \u201cI missed the whole last offseason and that\u2019s where I make a lot of my jumps in the summer,\u201d LaVine said. ON POINT: From struggling rookie to solid NBA player in his second season, Dunn made quite a jump. But he remains far from a finished product. Though he averaged 13.4 points in 52 games and tied for fourth in the league in steals (2 per game), Dunn averaged 2.9 turnovers. Paxson said he\u2019s comfortable with him as the No. 1 point guard next season and Cameron Payne as the backup. But did Dunn do enough to establish himself as the Bulls\u2019 long-term starter? \u201cWhat we saw from Kris Dunn this year was really encouraging,\u201d said Paxson, who would like to see Dunn become a stronger finisher. \u201cWhen he was healthy, he showed some real competitiveness.\u201d PRAISING HOIBERG: Paxson had strong praise for Hoiberg, saying he and his staff \u201cset the culture correctly in the summer\u201d and held the team together despite all the losses. Hoiberg is 110-136 in three seasons with the Bulls. But he finally had a roster suited to his pace and space style. \u201cFred and our guys set the tone when our guys came back and they just had the everyday attitude of working,\u201d Paxson said. \u201cThat needs to carry over and it will. Our guys need to continue to buy in which we believe they will.\u201d DRAFT ON TAP: With the sixth or seventh slot in the lottery and a pick from New Orleans in the 20 to 23 range, the Bulls need to hit in the draft this year if they\u2019re going to accelerate the rebuild. Paxson indicated the Bulls will look to add more size and versatility on the wing. Mikal Bridges of Villanova could be a possibility with their higher pick."},{"id":40890,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/sacramento-kings-hope-youth-movement-pays-near-future","date":"2018-04-13","title":"Sacramento Kings hope youth movement pays off in near future","content":"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) \u2014 Coach Dave Joerger strongly believes Sacramento\u2019s commitment to youth this season will pay off down the line in helping develop the Kings into a playoff contender. How soon that happens remains an open question. \u201cIt can be frustrating because we\u2019re a society that wants a quick change and we want it right now,\u201d Joerger said after the final game of his second season in Sacramento. \u201cIt just takes time together to get that chemistry. We all want it to happen as fast as possible and we\u2019re doing everything we can for that.\u201d The Kings took a step back in the standings this season, winning five fewer games on the way to a 27-55 record that left them out of the playoffs for the 12th straight season, the longest active drought in the NBA. But with most of Sacramento\u2019s key players age 25 or younger, there might be some reason for optimism for a franchise that seems to be in perpetual rebuilding mode. \u201cThey\u2019ve seen enough to know how to react now,\u201d veteran Vince Carter said. \u201cThey have a legitimate chance to contend. The challenge now is learning how to sustain leads. That\u2019s the next part.\u201d The Kings are looking to build a pair of rookie guards in last year\u2019s first-round pick De\u2019Aaron Fox and European import Bogdan Bogdanovic. Each showed good flashes at times throughout the season and improved as they got more responsibility when Joerger turned things over to the youth movement. \u201cJust be ready to take on a load,\u201d Fox said about his next step. \u201cI came off the bench, was able to feel out games and it just kind of molded me into a starting point guard. Next year, I just have to be more efficient, just elevate my game.\u201d\u2018 Guards Buddy Hield and Frank Mason III, swingman Justin Jackson and big men Willie Cauley-Stein and Skal Labissiere also got significant playing time as the Kings try to finding building blocks to turn the franchise around. Sacramento went 9-12 after the start of March in what the team hopes is a good sign for the future. Here are some other takeaways from the season and the upcoming offseason: BIG DRAFT: Sacramento enters the draft with the sixth-best chance at winning the top pick. This will be a key draft for the Kings, who don\u2019t have a first-round pick in 2019 because of previous deals. With top free agents hesitant to sign with a struggling franchise, Sacramento needs to find impact players in the draft in order to rebuild. WAITING FOR GILES: The Kings have high hopes for forward Harry Giles, who sat out his rookie season rehabbing a knee injury. Sacramento acquired Giles in a draft day deal but held him out of games all year in order to strengthen his knee. Giles was one of the top recruits coming out of high school before injuring his knee as a senior. He played one year at Duke, starting just six games, but has impressed Kings officials in workouts this season. PROTESTS: The most notable part of another losing season in Sacramento surrounded the protests of a police shooting and the Kings\u2019 reaction to it. Protesters kept most fans from entering the arena for two games following the March 18 fatal shooting by police of Stephon Clark, a 22-year-old unarmed black man. Kings players and owners supported the protesters and partnered with local groups to create a multiyear partnership that supports education, workforce preparation and economic development efforts in the community. ONE MORE YEAR: Carter plans to come back for one more season, whether it\u2019s in Sacramento or somewhere else. Carter, who turns 42 next January, is eligible to become a free agent this summer and wants to play a 21st season in the NBA. Carter averaged 5.4 points and 2.6 rebounds per game in his one season with the Kings. \u201cEvery day I want to be here, I want to play this game,\u201d Carter said. \u201cI enjoy this league and I enjoy this game so much. I want to be able to play and be able to compete with younger guys.\u201d"},{"id":40895,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/los-angeles-lakers-big-summer-looms-after-5-straight-losing-seasons","date":"2018-04-13","title":"Los Angeles Lakers' big summer looms after 5 straight losing seasons","content":"EL SEGUNDO, Calif. (AP) \u2014 And now the real season begins for the Los Angeles Lakers. At least that\u2019s what the fans of the 16-time NBA champions repeatedly have been told while Los Angeles missed the playoffs and finished with a losing record for the fifth consecutive year. Ever since they took over the Lakers\u2019 basketball operations a year ago, Magic Johnson and general manager Rob Pelinka have founded their rebuilding project around the acquisition of one or two elite free agents this summer \u2013 or next summer, they\u2019ve recently amended. Magic firmly believes the Lakers\u2019 championship pedigree, glamorous location and salary cap room for two enormous contracts can attract superstars near the primes of their careers to lift one of the NBA\u2019s cornerstone franchises back to its accustomed heights. The Lakers had only missed the playoffs five previous times in their first 65 years of existence before they doubled that number during this dismal half-decade. But while the pursuit of Paul George and LeBron James constantly loomed on the horizon, the Lakers\u2019 day-to-day development over the past season has been downright intriguing. For all their talk of the Lakers\u2019 irresistible lure, Johnson and Pelinka knew they probably couldn\u2019t attract free-agent stars without an attractive young core, and the last six months suggested they have it. \u201cIf guys want to come here, they come,\u201d rookie Kyle Kuzma said Thursday after his exit interview with team brass. \u201cBut if not, we\u2019re not depending on that. We want to be those great players, those max-level guys. We just think about, `How can we make the team better?\u201d\u2018 Rookies Lonzo Ball, Kuzma and Josh Hart all showed clear NBA ability, while youngsters Brandon Ingram and Julius Randle continued their development into above-average pros. Los Angeles\u2019 35-47 record and 11th-place conference finish in the just-completed season are its best performances by a considerable margin during this woeful five-year stretch. The Lakers aren\u2019t good yet, but the guys who are already in purple and gold could be key pieces in a very good team. Here are more things to watch during another long offseason in LA: PG SWEEPSTAKES: The Lakers are expected to put a full-court press on George, the Oklahoma City Thunder star who grew up idolizing Kobe Bryant in Palmdale, just north of Los Angeles. Even if James decides to stay home in Cleveland instead of becoming a dual-threat Hollywood mogul, the addition of George\u2019s 20-plus points per night almost certainly would make the Lakers very entertaining in coach Luke Walton\u2019s up-tempo system this fall. If George decides to play for a franchise closer to a championship, the Lakers will undoubtedly spin the narrative to the summer of 2019, when another bumper crop of free agents will be on the market. RANDLE\u2019S FUTURE: Randle\u2019s improvement was among the Lakers\u2019 most impressive developments of the season. The formerly inconsistent power forward played in all 82 games, averaging 16.1 points and 8.0 rebounds and emerging as a dependable two-way player. Randle is a free agent this summer after the Lakers decided not to lock him down with a contract extension last year, but Randle\u2019s outstanding year has greatly increased the chances of a long-term deal in LA. \u201cAs far as the summer, who knows what will happen?\u201d Randle said. \u201cI\u2019ve never done this before. All I know is it\u2019s going to be a longer summer than I want it to be, with us not being in the playoffs. I think it\u2019s exciting for me, though.\u201d FREE AGENCY: The Lakers\u2019 desire for plenty of cap room this summer means they\u2019ve got four talented veterans with expiring contracts: Brook Lopez, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Isaiah Thomas and Channing Frye. Lopez had a strong debut season with his hometown team, which won\u2019t be able to afford him unless it comes up empty with the top-shelf free agents. Caldwell-Pope also seems likely to leave, while the market for Thomas\u2019 skills is unpredictable after his injury-plagued year ended with hip surgery. If Thomas doesn\u2019t attract a big offer, he seems amenable to a return to LA \u2013 as does Frye, a dependable veteran backup. BALL GAME: After showing incredible basketball intelligence and a distressingly inconsistent shot, Ball said he is headed into \u201cpretty much the biggest summer of my life.\u201d The UCLA product with the opinionated parent understands the weaknesses in his game, and he seems determined to address his offensive flaws while building his overall strength. If Ball takes significant strides as a scorer, he would quickly become one of the NBA\u2019s most dynamic young guards with his preternatural court vision and rebounding ability. LUKE\u2019S FUTURE: Walton seems extremely likely to return for a third season after his Lakers made a nine-game improvement on last year\u2019s performance. Johnson and owner Jeanie Buss continue to speak glowingly of the young coach, and Walton doesn\u2019t seem satisfied by the Lakers\u2019 incremental improvements. \u201cWe know this is a team that\u2019s supposed to be in the playoffs and to contend for championships, and that\u2019s the goal we\u2019re all trying to reach every day,\u201d Walton said."},{"id":40909,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/numbers-preview-sixers-3-vs-heat-6","date":"2018-04-13","title":"Numbers preview: Philadelphia 76ers (3) vs. Miami Heat (6)","content":"The Philadelphia 76ers are here.

For two months, they looked like a team on the rise in the Eastern Conference during a 19-14 start that included victories at Golden State, Minnesota, Oklahoma City and Boston. Then an ankle injury to point guard Reggie Jackson derailed Detroit\u2019s season, and even a bold trade for Blake Griffin wasn\u2019t enough to push the Pistons to the playoffs. Detroit\u2019s promising start now feels like a long time ago, and the big question for this offseason is the status of Stan Van Gundy, who has just one playoff appearance in four seasons as coach and president of basketball operations. \u201cI think we have to make changes,\u201d owner Tom Gores said earlier this week. It\u2019s not clear if those changes will involve moving on from Van Gundy, who never had much of a chance to coach the Pistons at full strength after Jackson\u2019s ankle injury Dec. 26. He didn\u2019t come back until the latter half of March. After faltering badly following Jackson\u2019s injury, the Pistons acquired Griffin in a blockbuster trade at the end of January. Detroit went on a brief run after that deal but quickly regressed and finished 39-43. The Pistons have made the playoffs only once in the past nine seasons. \u201cHopefully we can have a more healthy year next year,\u201d Jackson said. Jackson has played only 97 games over the past two seasons, a big reason the Pistons have been unable to build on their playoff appearance in 2016. LIMITED FLEXIBILITY: The Pistons now have Griffin and Andre Drummond locked into expensive deals, and they\u2019ll probably need to make that combination work because they sent the Los Angeles Clippers a protected first-round draft pick in the deal for Griffin. Although there are always health concerns with Griffin, his production wasn\u2019t an issue. He averaged 19.8 points, 6.6 rebounds and 6.2 assists in 25 games with Detroit. YOUNGER OPTIONS: The first-round picks Detroit has had under Van Gundy have produced decidedly mixed results. Stanley Johnson can provide a boost defensively but is still limited at the offensive end, and Henry Ellenson played in only 38 games this season. Rookie Luke Kennard shot over 40 percent from 3-point range, but even that felt like a missed opportunity since he was taken one spot ahead of Donovan Mitchell in last year\u2019s draft. BRIGHT SPOT: Drummond came into the season with a lot to prove, and he delivered with perhaps his best season as a pro. Not only did he improve his free throw shooting to a more respectable 60.5 percent, but he also averaged 15 points and a career-high 16 rebounds. NEW ARENA: This was the team\u2019s first season at Little Caesars Arena in Detroit. A glaring number of empty seats early in the season indicated that the Pistons couldn\u2019t expect packed houses just because they were in a new venue, but the team hadn\u2019t been drawing well at its previous home either, and the move downtown could still pay dividends if Detroit wins a few more games. VETERAN: Anthony Tolliver did an impressive job as a role player for the Pistons this season, shooting 44 percent from beyond the arc and averaging 8.9 points per game. He\u2019s carved out a decade-long career after going undrafted out of Creighton."},{"id":40907,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/aging-dirk-nowitzki-young-dennis-smith-want-mavs-be-relevant-again","date":"2018-04-13","title":"Aging Dirk Nowitzki, young Dennis Smith want Mavs to be relevant again","content":"DALLAS (AP) \u2014  Dirk Nowitzki plans to become the first player to spend all 21 seasons with the same NBA franchise. Dennis Smith Jr. will be half the German star\u2019s age when the Dallas Mavericks open next season looking to end the first two-year playoff drought in nearly two decades. The team posted its worst record since 1997-98, the year before Nowitzki arrived. The No. 9 overall pick who turned 20 early in what ended up as a solid rookie season, Smith figures to have a new teammate facing high expectations the way he did. Dallas will pick no lower than seventh in June. Smith will have at least one thing in common with Nowitzki, who turns 40 this summer. They want the Mavericks to be regulars in the postseason again, the way they were before the current swoon. \u201cI\u2019ve been in a couple of arenas that are playoff teams, and I just witnessed the atmosphere,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI can only imagine how it is playoff time.\u201d It\u2019s certainly better than 24-58, tied with Atlanta for the league\u2019s third-worst record. Youth, injuries and a difficult schedule buried the Mavericks early for the second straight year. They spent the last half of the season wondering where they would fall in the lottery, and owner Mark Cuban was fined $600,000 for suggesting that Dallas had been tanking for two seasons. Part of Cuban\u2019s point was that he\u2019d had enough of that approach. \u201cWe do not want to go back to what we just experienced,\u201d president of basketball operations Donnie Nelson said. \u201cThat\u2019s unanimous, from the top on down. When you go through retooling or rebuilding situations like we\u2019re going through now, it\u2019s done with the right people.\u201d For Nelson, two of those three people are in place in Smith and leading scorer Harrison Barnes. The third is coming in the draft. Nelson compared the situation to when he joined his dad, former coach and general manager Don Nelson, in Dallas 20 years ago. Michael Finley was already there. Steve Nash and Nowitzki were on the way. The Mavericks made the playoffs 15 out of 16 years starting in 2001, winning their first championship in 2011. They haven\u2019t won a playoff series since. \u201cWe\u2019re certainly hoping that we\u2019re not in the early stages of a rebuild,\u201d coach Rick Carlisle said. \u201cWe want to get through this as expeditiously as possible. But there\u2019s no way you can skip steps.\u201d Things to consider after the first 50-loss season for Dallas since the last of seven in an eight-season stretch in the 1990s: DIRK FOR 22?: Surgery for bone spurs in his left ankle ended Nowitzki\u2019s season a few games early, but after he had set a record for games in a 20th season with 77. He has had a season-to-season approach for several years now. \u201cI\u2019m hoping the ankle will be tons better than this year,\u201d said Nowitzki , who figures to pass Wilt Chamberlain on the career scoring list but get passed by LeBron James to leave him where he is now \u2013 sixth place. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for me at this point to commit further than one year or say one year\u2019s it.\u201d SMITH\u2019S BACKUPS: J.J. Barea has a year left on his contract after averaging career highs of 11.6 points and 6.3 assists per game. Yogi Ferrell and Seth Curry have expiring contracts, but the Mavericks figure to be interested. Ferrell proved to be a solid role player on a two-year deal earned after a flashy start on a 10-day contract last season. Dallas had high hopes for Curry, but the younger brother of Golden State star Stephen Curry missed the season with a stress fracture in his lower left leg. MORE FIREPOWER: The Dallas roster was loaded with undrafted and\/or G League players, and Carlisle has been praised for the development of some of those younger players. Now it\u2019s time to replace projects with weapons. \u201cGetting Rick ammunition is our No. 1 priority in the offseason,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a great opportunity in the draft. Free agency as you know will be extremely active. There\u2019s trade fronts obviously that will be probed as well.\u201d THE LAST OF NOEL: There was no mention of center Nerlens Noel on the final day of interviews. Suspended the final five games for violating the NBA\u2019s anti-drug program, Noel never developed into the post player Dallas envisioned after getting him at the trading deadline last season. After a lost season on a one-year deal as a restricted free agent, he hits the open market with little or no value."},{"id":40898,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/jeremy-lin-plans-return-brooklyn-nets-new-player-next-season","date":"2018-04-13","title":"Jeremy Lin plans to return to Brooklyn Nets a new player next season","content":"NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Jeremy Lin didn\u2019t even make it through one full game this season. He plans to return next season playing a different way so he can stay on the floor and help the Brooklyn Nets keep building. Lin played in just 36 games in 2016-17 due to hamstring injuries and ruptured his right patella tendon in a loss at Indiana on opening night of this season. His plan to stay healthy focuses on ditching all the on-court motor skills that started Linsanity six years ago across the city with the New York Knicks in exchange for a new range of motion. \u201cSo, like, at every level of ability to be more dynamic, I\u2019m not just looking at whether my knee will hold up. I\u2019m looking at whether I have done enough to completely change pre-existing movement patterns,\u201d Lin said Thursday, a day after the Nets finished 28-54, their third consecutive 50-loss season after three straight playoff appearances. The Nets won seven of their last 13 games after losing 19 of 22. The 29-year-old Lin spent a large chunk of his rehab process at Fortius Sport and Health in Vancouver, British Columbia, under his personal trainer, Rick Celebrini, who in the past worked with former NBA star Steve Nash. Running, shooting and defending will all seem new for Lin, who signed a three-year, $36 million deal with the Nets in July 2016, and in February opted in to his $12.5 million player option. \u201cIt won\u2019t look different to the eye, or on TV any different, but it will be very different in terms of how I do it, and where I move from and what muscles I\u2019m using and what tendons and joints I\u2019m not using,\u201d Lin said. His injury led to the development of others at point guard. Spencer Dinwiddie became a candidate for the Most Improved Player award after averaging career highs with 12.6 points and 6.6 assists. Coach Kenny Atkinson and general manager Sean Marks also got a good look at D\u2019Angelo Russell, who took over Lin\u2019s duties, but then needed knee suffer that forced him out until mid-January. Once the 22-year-old returned to the court, he showed flashes of why the Los Angeles Lakers made him the No. 2 pick of the 2015 draft before including him in the Brook Lopez deal last summer. Add in Allen Crabbe, who struggled at times but set the franchise season-single record of 201 3-pointers made; an improved defender in second-year player Caris LeVert; a young shot-blocker in rookie Jarrett Allen; and the rising play of Rondae Hollis-Jefferson along with the veteran presence of DeMarre Carroll, Lin has a reason to feel optimistic. Other things to know about the Nets: WANTING WINS: Lin was asked how he would define progress in what could be his final season in a Nets uniform.  \u201cI\u2019m a very results-oriented person, and I\u2019m a very wins-oriented person,\u201d he said. \u201cMy answer would be wins. I don\u2019t love moral victories. We just need to win more games, and we need to, hopefully, win a lot.\u201d HARRIS\u2019 HOPES: Joe Harris averaged 10.8 points and enjoyed career-bests in field goal shooting (49.1 percent) and 3-point makes (41.9 percent). The former Cleveland guard is one of four unrestricted free agents and could become too expensive for the Nets, who have about $16 million available in their cap space. He\u2019s already told his agent and the front office his preference to stay. \u201cYeah, I think any time you\u2019re comfortable playing within a system you\u2019re going to play more aggressive, you\u2019re going to play with more confidence,\u201d Harris said. \u201cIt\u2019s not to say you would go someplace else and not be able to adjust quickly, but I think being here and having a familiarity with everyone . it just makes the game easier for you and understanding where you need to be and what they expect out of you.\u201d RUSSELL\u2019S ROLE: Russell fell out of favor in Los Angeles but his teammates in Brooklyn praised his play and work ethic. \u201cHis talent, nobody in this room or arena will question his talent. You just want him to do it consistently\u201d, Carroll said. \u201cD\u2019Angelo is probably the closest thing we have to an All-Star on our team if he did it consistently. Me, being his big brother, being a leader, I just challenge him to come in and hit it hard every day.\u201d Sharing the backcourt with Dinwiddie over the last three months of the season, Russell played on and off the ball and averaged 15.5 points and a career-high 5.2 assists. He often mentioned his commitment to Brooklyn\u2019s long-term future. \u201cI came into this situation, played a few games and got hurt, went down and come back,\u201d Russell said. \u201cI had to earn my stripes all over again and start over. That\u2019s kind of what it really was, the reality of it, the whole situation. I had to gain Coach\u2019s trust back and show them that I was willing to do that again.\u201d"},{"id":47479,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/la-clippers-look-heal-decisions-looming-about-future","date":"2018-04-12","title":"L.A. Clippers look to heal with decisions looming about future","content":"LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 The Clippers are finally out of their misery, a long season marred by significant injuries coming to an end just short of the playoffs. They finished with a winning record of 42-40, but their streak of consecutive postseason appearances ended at six. They closed out the season Wednesday night with a 115-100 loss to the Lakers, dropping their last four games in a row. They kept their playoff hopes alive until the final week of the regular season despite the injuries. Eleven players missed a total of 265 games. Coach Doc Rivers started an NBA-leading 37 different lineups because of the injuries. The Clippers were forced to dip into the G League for starters, most notably C.J. Williams (who was signed to a multi-year deal) and Tyrone Wallace. The season began with nine new players on the roster after the offseason departures of Chris Paul, J.J. Redick and Jamal Crawford. But injuries soon befell the newcomers. Point guard Patrick Beverley was lost for the season after right knee surgery; starter Danilo Gallinari missed 60 games with hand and glute issues; backup guard Milos Teodosic was out 36 games with foot problems; and guard Avery Bradley was out 24 games. Some takeaways from the Clippers\u2019 season: BIG MAN\u2019S FUTURE: DeAndre Jordan has a player option of $24.1 million for next season or he could explore free agency. He and the team have yet to agree on an extension. \u201cI want to be where I\u2019m wanted,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cI want to have a chance to contend. That\u2019s really what I\u2019m looking at.\u201d He averaged 12 points and 15.2 rebounds, but just 0.9 blocks. Jordan has spent his entire 10-year career with the Clippers and he turns 30 in July. \u201cLet\u2019s not write the script yet,\u201d Rivers said of Jordan\u2019s future. DOC\u2019S FUTURE: Rivers is entering the final year of his contract. He could either receive an extension or leave after five years in Los Angeles. He was stripped of his duties as president of basketball operations a year ago, leaving his focus solely on the court. \u201cI love where we\u2019re at as a franchise,\u201d Rivers said. While he has yet to match the success he enjoyed in Boston (two NBA Finals appearances and one title), he pulled off one of his best coaching jobs by keeping the Clippers in contention all season when it would have been easy for them to fold. \u201cI really commend him for sticking with us,\u201d Jordan said. Rivers trusted younger players to produce and swingman Montrezl Harrell blossomed under his tutelage. LOU WILL: Lou Williams led the team with career highs in scoring (22.6 points) and assists (5.3) coming off the bench in his 13th season and first in Los Angeles. His scoring average was the highest of any reserve in the last 25 years. He received a $24 million, three-year deal in February and was a key reason the Clippers remained competitive despite their injuries. \u201cMy job this summer is getting myself prepared,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s always room for improvement.\u201d DRAFT PICKS: Besides their own pick, the Clippers will have Detroit\u2019s pick that they received from trading Blake Griffin in January. FREE AGENCY: Besides Jordan, the Clippers could have decisions to make if starting guard Austin Rivers and Teodosic exercise their player options and become free agents. Rivers averaged career highs in points, assists, 3-point percentage and minutes. Bradley will be an unrestricted free agent. However, injuries blunted his impact. Harrell will be a restricted free agent, which allows the Clippers to match any offer he would receive. He was an energetic force off the bench."},{"id":47414,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/denver-nuggets-improve-6-games-fall-short-playoffs-again","date":"2018-04-12","title":"Denver Nuggets improve by 6 games, fall short of playoffs again","content":" DENVER (AP) \u2014 Nikola Jokic only had a basic outline of his offseason plans: Rest, work out in Denver, return home to Serbia and rest some more. It\u2019s not more elaborate since the Nuggets big man figured he\u2019d be working for a while longer. The Nuggets won six more games than a year ago and yet finished in the same position \u2013 a spot out of the playoffs. This season even came down to a winner-take-all scenario in Minnesota, where the Nuggets came up short in overtime to miss out on the playoffs for a fifth straight season. \u201cI\u2019m not mad. I\u2019m not sad, because I think we played good,\u201d Jokic said Thursday. \u201cWe\u2019re not making the playoffs because we were not focused the whole season, every game.\u201d Still, the Nuggets won six straight down the stretch to climb into contention for a spot, before losing to the Timberwolves in a spirited game. \u201cIf we play with that sense of urgency that we did at the end, then we wouldn\u2019t have even been in this position,\u201d Will Barton said. \u201cIt\u2019s all a part of growing.\u201d Veteran Richard Jefferson had a succinct message to the team. \u201cEmbrace the pain,\u201d Jefferson said. \u201cThe pain is what makes it good.\u201d Soon after, he slung a plastic garbage bag crammed with all his gear over his shoulder and playfully sang \u201cOn the Road Again\u201d as he sauntered down the hallway. This is a team that\u2019s steadily on the rise under third-year coach Michael Malone, going from 33 wins in 2015-16, to 40 last season and now 46. \u201cI\u2019ll continue to think about, going into next year, how I can get better next season. What do I have to do as a head coach and a leader to help this team move from being a ninth seed and out of the playoffs with 46 wins to being a playoff team?\u201d Malone said. \u201cNext year is a year we have to make that jump.\u201d Denver had its share of health issues this season, with Paul Millsap missing 44 games after suffering a left wrist injury that required surgery. Jokic was sidelined six games with a sprained left ankle, and Gary Harris missed 11 contests due to a strained right knee, before returning with two remaining. \u201cThrough it all, I\u2019m still optimistic and feel comfortable with where we\u2019re at,\u201d said Millsap, who signed a $90 million, three-year deal last summer. \u201cStill wish we were still playing. But I\u2019m still happy about our guys and where we\u2019re at.\u201d Things to know following a season in which the Nuggets went 31-10 at the Pepsi Center and 15-26 on the road:   BARTON\u2019S RETURN  Barton did a little bit of everything for the Nuggets, from coming in off the bench to starting, from playing two-guard to small forward. A free agent this summer, Barton hopes to be back next season.  \u201cWe\u2019re building something real special here,\u201d Barton said . MURRAY & MALONE  Jamal Murray\u2019s dad pushes him. John Calipari, his coach at Kentucky, pushes him. So Malone can, too.  \u201cI don\u2019t think he realizes how hard he can get on me, how hard he can push me and demand stuff from me,\u201d said Murray , who turned in quite a second season as he transitioned to point guard.  No joke, Murray said he wants his 3-point shooting percentage (37.8 this season) to match his free throw percentage (90.5).   THE JOKER  Jokic was one of the most dominating big men in the league, averaging 18.5 points, 10.7 rebounds and 6.1 assists. He also had 10 triple-doubles.  No wonder Malone is all for signing him to a long-term deal.  \u201cAs soon as possible, sign that kid up,\u201d Malone said.  PAINFUL EXPERIENCE Although Millsap came back in late February, his wrist wasn\u2019t close to 100 percent. He said doctors told him it will be sore for up to a year.  \u201cI still went out there and gave it all I could,\u201d said Millsap , whose team went 24-20 in his absence.  THIS & THAT  Forward Kenneth Faried didn\u2019t get into a game after nearly 10 minutes on Feb. 1. \u2026 The 37-year-old Jefferson on his future: \u201cIt\u2019s not whether or not I\u2019m here. It\u2019s whether or not I\u2019ll be playing basketball.\u201d \u2026 Guard Devin Harris averaged 8.2 points after being acquired in February. \u2026 Forward Torrey Craig donned a cap Thursday that had one word on it \u2013 \u201cSalty.\u201d Mood of the team? \u201cIt\u2019s tough on all the guys,\u201d Craig said of missing the postseason."},{"id":47053,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/atlanta-hawks-deandre-bembry-diagnosed-fractured-right-wrist-again","date":"2018-04-12","title":"Hawks' DeAndre Bembry diagnosed with fractured right wrist - again","content":"ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 DeAndre Bembry\u2019s season full of injury woes ended with the Atlanta Hawks\u2019 second-year forward being diagnosed with his second fractured right wrist.

The other spot could go to veteran shooter Kyle Korver, who has been slowed by a foot injury and whose status remains uncertain \u201cHe\u2019s getting better,\u201d Lue said of Korver, who also missed time recently following his brother\u2019s death. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if he\u2019s 100 percent yet, but he\u2019s getting better and that\u2019s all you can ask for.\u201d If Korver isn\u2019t ready, Rodney Hood, one of four players acquired at the trade deadline, will likely start. He\u2019s been slowed by a sore left Achilles, but Lue said Hood\u2019s \u201cready to go.\u201d As for Cleveland\u2019s reserves, Jordan Clarkson, J.R. Smith and Jose Calderon are in the rotational mix, with forwards Tristan Thompson and Larry Nance Jr. being used depending on whom Indiana has on the floor. One of the holdovers from Cleveland\u2019s past three Finals teams, Thompson played extended minutes in the second half of Wednesday\u2019s loss to New York while Nance rested, a sign that Lue might be leaning toward him playing more. Thompson was excused from Thursday\u2019s practice because of the birth of his daughter. Lue trusts all his players. He\u2019s had no choice following a turbulent regular season in which he didn\u2019t always know who would be available until moments before tipoff. But Lue has depth and intends to use it. Hall of Fame coach Pat Riley\u2019s philosophy in the playoffs was: \u201cYou rotate eight players. You play seven. You use six and you trust five.\u201d Not Lue. Not this year. \u201cYou usually go nine,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we\u2019ve been nine in the past, but I think it\u2019s going to be important to go 10 for us because I like Clarkson being on the floor with a point guard, so that makes us play 10.\u201d Hill, who has plenty of playoff experience with San Antonio, Indiana and Utah, said Cleveland\u2019s versatility may give the Cavs an advantage. \u201cI\u2019ve been on a team that played a 10-man rotation in the playoffs, but I haven\u2019t been on a team this deep, so I think we\u2019ll have a lot of great guys that we can throw out there on the court with big lineups, small lineups,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we can play any type of style.\u201d For Hill, the matchup against the Pacers represents a homecoming, as he played for IUPUI and spent five years with the Pacers. It\u2019s also a chance to win a championship with James, a former playoff nemesis. Hill played on those Pacers teams that were eliminated in three straight postseasons by James and the Miami Heat. That can\u2019t happen this time. \u201cThe good thing is we got the best player in the world playing for us,\u201d Hill said. \u201cSo I\u2019m very excited about that. I don\u2019t got to get put out by him this year, which I did a lot in my career. So, I\u2019m happy to be on the other side.\u201d"},{"id":47344,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/mikhail-prokhorov-completes-sale-49-percent-nets-tsai","date":"2018-04-12","title":"Mikhail Prokhorov completes sale of 49 percent of Nets to Tsai","content":"NEW YORK (AP) \u2014  Brooklyn Nets owner Mikhail Prokhorov has completed the sale of a 49 percent interest in the team to Joe Tsai, who could become the controlling owner in three years.

This prelude is better than what Moses Malone and Rudy Tomjanovich did. Better than the Towers of Ralph Sampson and rookie Akeem Olajuwon. Better than Hakeem Olajuwon (spelling change) and Big Shot Rob (aka Robert Horry) and Kenny \u201cThe Jet\u201d Smith managed. Better than Olajuwon, Clyde Drexler and Sir Charles. Better than Tracy McGrady and Yao Ming. This team just won a league-and franchise-high 65 games , claimed the 2017-18 regular-season title and home-court advantage for the Western Conference playoffs. And most refreshing of all, emerged mostly free of battle scars from the grind ( get well soon, Luc Mbah a Moute ). This team boasts the strong Kia MVP favorite in James Harden, who could win the award over LeBron James and get little to no blowback from the basketball public if he does. They have Mike D\u2019Antoni, the Professor of Offensive Basketball and reigning Coach of the Year who followed up 2016-17 with a season just as satisfying as that one \u2014 if not more. They bring nine-time All-Star point guard Chris Paul, too. The welcome newcomer had a static-free seven-month bond with Harden and, therefore, threw a javelin through the notion that ball-dominant players and strong personalities can\u2019t share the court, too. The Rockets have pretty much done it all since October, with buckets of 3-pointers , a top-10 defense and a rumble through the NBA that left a trail of scattered bodies (including one in particular from the Bay Area). It was, says D\u2019Antoni, \u201ca special season\u201d that checked all the boxes and set the franchise record for wins and chest-bumps. This was cleanly executed, almost flawlessly performed and noticeably free of setbacks and drama. Yet Harden, speaking for everyone involved, could only summarize it with an obvious observation: \u201cWe haven\u2019t done anything yet.\u201d But of course. The optimism in Houston generated from where the Rockets sit at the table of championship contenders is served with a side dish of hesitation. There is nothing but confidence buzzing inside the locker room \u2026 and a degree of skepticism outside of it. One reason is because the defending-champion Golden State Warriors are still standing in the way, keeping Houston\u2019s dynasty as a work in progress. The other? That would be the playoff ghosts of Paul, of Harden and of D\u2019Antoni, the three most important members of this Rockets run who must distance themselves from previous springtime failures \u2014 or become buried by them. A championship for those three wouldn\u2019t quite have the reverberation LeBron James\u2019 win for Cleveland in 2016 did or even what the Warriors\u2019 title in 2015 did for the Bay Area after a 40-year NBA title drought. But it would have its own special place for three people who\u2019ve helped shape the NBA we see today. Maybe it\u2019s no coincidence, then, that the Basketball Gods put them on the same team and essentially formed the league\u2019s most obvious support group. But don\u2019t expect them to sit around a circle and swap what-if tales. When you raise the subject with Paul, Harden and D\u2019Antoni \u2014 here on the eve of this, their best shot at a title \u2014 they refuse to make a big deal out of what\u2019s undoubtedly a Big Deal. Do they accept accountability for the past? Yes, although in each case, circumstances beyond their control dictated quick playoff exits. Do they dwell on it? Not in public anyway, although a title is clearly the missing piece of their respective legacies. And, your hunch says, an irritating (if not painful) void. \u201cWe know it would mean everything to them,\u201d said Rockets forward and resident tough-guy PJ Tucker. \u201cI mean, they deserve one. Probably should have one by now.\u201d Maybe that changes soon, especially for Paul. Nobody has played in more playoff games (76) and without reaching the conference finals. It is easily the scarlet letter in the career of a future Hall of Famer. With Harden, Paul is blessed with the only NBA top-five teammate he\u2019s ever had (sorry, Blake Griffin). In D\u2019Antoni, he has a coach who\u2019s receptive to suggestions and has an overall better shot at beating the mighty Warriors. Both are things Paul couldn\u2019t manage on the LA Clippers when facing the Steve Kerr-era Warriors. Only once, however, did Paul face-splat in the playoffs. That came in late in Game 5 of the 2014 conference semifinals against the Thunder, as his Clippers blew a big lead and a chance to go up 3-2. Oklahoma City would close out the series in Los Angeles. In the 2015 West semis, the Clippers blew a 3-1 series lead to the Rockets , but Paul was mostly superb in that series. In fact, his playoff averages ( 21.4 points, 9.4 assists, 38.1 percent on 3-pointers ) are in line with his season averages. After that crushing loss to the Rockets came an avalanche of crummy luck. Paul and Griffin suffered injuries that either limited them or knocked them out of the playoffs . With limited scoring options sans Paul and Griffin, the Clippers had no chance. Still, no team that won 60 percent of its games over a six-season stretch failed to make the conference finals \u2026 except the Paul-led Clippers. Paul\u2019s arrival in Houston runs somewhat parallel to Drexler\u2019s back in 1995 . The Hall of Famer spent a 11 1\/2 seasons with the Blazers without winning a title, although he did reach two Finals ( 1990 , \u201992 ). His championship moment didn\u2019t come until he joined Olajuwon and raised the trophy. Drexler, now a TV analyst for the Rockets, feels a kinship with Paul\u2019s path. \u201cI said it 30 years ago, it\u2019s a team sport not an individual sport, and you can have 50 points and 30 rebounds but if I miss two free throws at the end of the game, we don\u2019t win,\u201d Drexler said. \u201cIt\u2019s always nice to be on a team that\u2019s good enough and lucky enough and healthy enough but it doesn\u2019t always happen. \u201cHe\u2019s phenomenally skilled, highly talented, one of the best to ever play the game. He\u2019s tremendous to James, who has another guy he respects and can depend on. Chris can give him a rest off the ball and when that happens we don\u2019t lose the lead; the lead goes up.\u201d After Paul nudged the Clippers to trade him to Houston last summer, Paul made a point to forge a relationship with Harden right away, within days. That was critical as Paul wanted to let Harden know he wasn\u2019t coming to overwhelm Harden, only to help him. It\u2019s no coincidence that Paul\u2019s popular State Farm commercials seized the chance to add Harden this year . \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d said Paul, when asked about the importance of that time together. \u201cThis all started this summer when we spent some time together. We got a tight knit group because of that. And what I\u2019ve learned is James wants this as bad as anyone. His love for the game is strong. He loves to play just as much as anybody I\u2019ve been around. You don\u2019t know about these things until you\u2019re with somebody for a while.\u201d It might be an advantage for Paul in that, probably for the first time in his life, he\u2019s not the most important player on the team. Once this year\u2019s votes are added up, Harden is expected to collect more MVP love than anyone except LeBron. \u201cThere\u2019s no egos,\u201d said Paul, explaining why this has worked. \u201cEverything is collaborative.\u201d The ball is mostly in Harden\u2019s hands, which makes sense, given his ability to create for himself and others. He finished as the league\u2019s scoring champ with 30.4 ppg and ranked third in assists (8.8 apg) , behind only James and Rajon Rondo. Both stats are reflective of Harden\u2019s talent and Paul\u2019s willingness to play the co-star. Harden\u2019s playoff ghosts aren\u2019t as sinister as Paul\u2019s as he has reached the conference finals three times and, as a member of the Thunder, made it to The Finals in 2012 . Yet he evaporated in that championship series, and no-showed in Game 6 of the 2017 West semis when the Rockets were eliminated by the Spurs . Harden had gaudy playoff numbers in the last three postseasons ( 27.5 ppg, 7.8 rpg, 5.5 apg ) without the benefit of a reliable No. 2 guy to absorb some of the heat. Therefore, he sounds relieved, more than anything, when discussing his chances with Paul. \u201cIt\u2019s just his passion, how much he cares, how much he studies,\u201d said Harden. \u201cIt shows up on the court. And if I\u2019m at home and if it\u2019s an off night, he\u2019ll call me and say, \u2018Hey, did you see the game, are you watching the game?\u2019 He loves basketball, and that gives you that extra drive because you know he\u2019s tuned in. Here\u2019s a guy, that\u2019s 13 years in the league, and he still has the enthusiasm like he\u2019s a rookie. He brings so much to this team and obviously to myself. Every day I learn something from him.\u201d Of all coaches, D\u2019Antoni might be the one who has influenced much of what we see from today\u2019s game: torrid offensive pace, an infatuation with the 3-pointer and a spread floor. Before he took over the job and the Rockets began breaking NBA records for 3-point shooting and scoring , he oversaw the Phoenix Suns and their seven-seconds-or-less approach to shooting. It became revolutionary and although those teams were entertaining as heck (and rolled up the score), they produced zero championships. He is 32-38 lifetime in the postseason. That of course led to a chorus about D\u2019Antoni\u2019s basketball-on-steriods system and how it was hamstrung by the slower, defensive-minded pace of the playoffs. This ignored the reality that the Suns then were no match in the playoffs for Dirk Nowitzki\u2019s Dallas Mavericks and Tim Duncan\u2019s San Antonio Spurs (and later Kobe Bryant\u2019s Los Angeles Lakers), no matter how many scoreboards they broke. Also, the offense the Rockets employ is an almost completely different approach to basketball than those Suns\u2019 teams (or the Linsanity teams D\u2019Antoni coached in New York). Phoenix didn\u2019t rely nearly as much on the long ball as they used All-Stars Steve Nash and Amar\u2019e Stoudemire to pick-and-roll folks to a slow death. And the Rockets don\u2019t fast break like those Phoenix teams. If anything, D\u2019Antoni has proved masterful in creating a system that best exploits his team\u2019s strengths, and this year had to tweak it to embrace what Paul brings. He says, with some modesty: \u201cYou go with the skill level of the players, which has gotten so much better lately. The 3-point shot has done that. If you can\u2019t shoot 3s, you better be really good at other things. The 3 has changed the way players have looked at the game, how coaches coach the game.\u201d His system has perhaps inflated the profile of role players such as Ryan Anderson, Eric Gordon and Trevor Ariza. They have a combined zero All-Star appearances but often deliver massive games, thanks partly to the number of open looks at the basket. D\u2019Antoni adds: \u201cYou just try to get the most out of what you got. Everybody\u2019s trying to put a label on things. Sometimes you can\u2019t. The player dictates how they play and we\u2019re trying to allow them to be the best version of themselves. I will say this is the best team I\u2019ve been around. Never had a team this deep.\u201d As for the Rockets\u2019 chances of getting hardware with this approach, D\u2019Antoni doesn\u2019t grit his teeth as much anymore about the question. Rather, he says, why not? \u201cThere\u2019s not a concrete reason of, \u2018Yeah, but it was in the regular season.\u2019 No, it\u2019s all the same,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, there\u2019s no reason why we can\u2019t. We just haven\u2019t proven it. But we haven\u2019t had this team to be able to prove it. Obviously, the playoffs are a different animal. It\u2019s exciting more than anything. Definitely not a worry.\u201d Some Rockets were privately annoyed when Kerr said the Warriors could beat anyone without Stephen Curry ( who finished the season injured ). They also wondered why Golden State still doesn\u2019t have as much respect for the Rockets as they should, even after losing twice to Houston this season. Without a doubt, the Warriors are in the Rockets\u2019 heads, as they should be, since no other team in the West lives in the same area code as these two. \u201cThey know about us,\u201d Gordon said. \u201cThey know. There\u2019s a reason we have the best record. As long as we play together on offense and on defense as we have been, I\u2019ll take out chances against anybody.\u201d Paul said he will enter the playoffs more confident about this team\u2019s chances than any he\u2019s ever been on before, which says plenty, considering the Clippers had three All-Stars in their prime. \u201cWe got so many different weapons,\u201d Paul said, \u201cso many different ways to play. The spirit of our team has just been right.\u201d Harden adds: \u201cThe groundwork that we put in from last year, the additions this year, it\u2019s put us where we want to be.\u201d During the summer together prepping for this season, Harden and Paul envisioned a 2017-18 where they would get the best record in the NBA, grab home court for the playoffs and, in June, finally discover what the Larry O\u2019Brien trophy felt like. They\u2019re two-thirds there to a finish line that always managed to extend just beyond their reach. Are the Rockets the biggest threat to the Warriors? Or a bigger one to themselves? Harden claims a clear sense of what the immediate future will bring for himself, D\u2019Antoni, Paul and the Rockets, and with the regular season they just had, he is expecting to witness this: \u201cGreatness,\u201d he said. * * * Veteran NBA writer Shaun Powell has worked for newspapers and other publications for more than 25 years.

First up is hoping that May 15, Draft lottery day, turns out to be a hoops Christmas. Then comes the June Draft and the selection of what is hopefully the future face(s) of the franchise. And come July, when free agency and Summer League action do their choreographed dance, dreams starting taking a much more realistic shape for lottery squads. So with plenty of time to ponder the possibilities between now and Draft lottery night, we take a look at things the lottery teams can feel good about as they slide off the radar for the next month. So without further ado, a look at the non-playoff crop from 2017-18 \u2026 NOTE: Teams listed in alphabetical order Everything could be new for the Hawks by next season, from the look and feel inside of a renovated Philips Arena (haircut or Top Golf, anyone?) to a roster that is need of a similar makeover. It helps to have a Draft war chest that consists of three first-rounders. But there are already a couple of young building blocks in place in Taurean Prince (who was a force down the stretch of this brutal season) and promising young big man John Collins. Culture. Culture. Culture. That\u2019s what Nets coach Kenny Atkinson is working on building in Brooklyn. That, plus a player-development program that has seen the likes of Spencer Dinwiddie, Rondae Hollis-Jefferson and Caris LeVert develop into productive players. (Young big man Jarrett Allen could be next). If a healthy Jeremy Lin does what the Nets believe he can, this group becomes much more interesting. The Hornets have fallen woefully short of expectations in recent seasons. Doing so cost former GM Rich Cho his job and provides his replacement, Mitch Kupchak , a prime opportunity to show what he learned about championship-level team-building during his years with the Los Angeles Lakers. Charlotte certainly worked for veteran big man Dwight Howard, who had a career resurgence in 2017-18 . All-Star guard Kemba Walker survived trade rumors all season and remains one of the league\u2019s most dynamic backcourt talents. The rebuild from rock bottom will go a lot faster if the Bulls put their trust in Zach LaVine and Lauri Markannen as the headliners for the future. Everything else is negotiable for a franchise that has to identify and empower a point guard\/playmaker comfortable setting the table for two dynamic youngsters with (eventual) All-Star potential. Coach Fred Hoiberg finally free from the shackles of expectations from the previous era should also provide a boost. The good news? Dirk Nowitzki said it\u2019s looking like he\u2019s coming back for another season , perhaps the last of his sure-fire Hall of Fame career. The even better news? That gives rookie Dennis Smith Jr., the future face of the franchise, another season to learn from the all-time face of the franchise. The Mavs have plenty of heavy lifting to do to repair the image of the organization, both on and off the court. Coach Rick Carlisle\u2019s guidance and Smith Jr. leading a seasoned cast in what could be Dirk\u2019s final campaign is a good place to start in 2018-19 Coach Michael Malone\u2019s team was forced to play its final eight regular season games like the one-and-done affairs that they turned out to be. And they battled to the finish, falling on the final night in Minneapolis to a Timberwolves team that was just as desperate to get into the Western Conference playoff mix. The near-miss will only serve to harden these Nuggets, who are stocked with a playoff roster and need only to avoid the injury bug (Paul Millsap early and Gary Harris late) that bit them this season. The world will miss coach Stan Van Gundy\u2019s scowl and five-star mock turtleneck collection if he and owner Tom Gores cannot agree on a way forward for the franchise\u2019s top basketball executive and coach. Even with Blake Griffin and Andre Drummond joining forces, the Pistons\u2019 point guard issues overshadowed everything else. And no one is sure what to make yet of Stanley Johnson or Luke Kennard, whose progress, or lack thereof, might come to define the Stan Van era in the Motor City. Change, of one kind or another, seems on the way. It\u2019s a testament to coach Doc Rivers and his abilities that the Clippers stayed in the playoff chase as long as they did given all of the tumult in ClipperLand since last summer. Now that the \u201cLob City\u201d era is officially over, the Clippers get to chart a new course with all of the framework in place for a quick turnaround. The best sixth man in the business (Lou Williams) and a former All-Star big man (DeAndre Jordan) headline the holdovers. All that\u2019s needed now is executive Jerry West\u2019s magic offseason touch to jumpstart the accelerated rebuild. No team on the lottery list contains a more promising young core of talent than these Lakers. Having Brandon Ingram, Kyle Kuzma, Julius Randle and Lonzo Ball means L.A. is poised for bigger and better things in the near future. Isaiah Thomas is one the mend (again) and wants in on the party, too. If the Lakers\u2019 Draft and free-agent pursuits produce the sort of immediate dividends that will keep Magic Johnson\u2019s megawatt smile shining, the Lakers\u2019 dark days will end sooner rather than later. There\u2019s only one direction to go for the Grizzlies, who will get a healthy (fingers crossed) Mike Conley back to run the show next season alongside former All-Star big man Marc Gasol. That\u2019s a great place to start the franchise makeover. The sideline conductor for said show remains a mystery since a permanent replacement for David Fizdale has not emerged as of yet. A top Draft pick added to an already extremely young mix of talent means there is plenty of heavy lifting still to be done. How quickly the world forgot about the strides Kristaps Porzingis made before going down for the season with that dreaded ACL injury \u2014 that \u201cUnicorn\u201d for MVP campaign was a real thing, briefly. The PorzinGod will return. There are other keepers, too. Tim Hardaway Jr. showed he\u2019s legit. And they might have stumbled on to a real gem in Trey Burke. The promise of a top pick in what is believed to be a deep Draft provides another ray of hope that general manager Scott Perry will right some wrongs of the Knicks\u2019 recent past on Draft night. The ghost of Dwight Howard lingers over this franchise in ways that must make Stephen King cringe. The Magic are still trying to find a breakthrough back to the postseason since the Howard era ended. Rarely does one player alone fuel the fire for that sort of turnaround, but Aaron Gordon is doing his best to do exactly that. When healthy, he looked like the difference-maker the Magic have been looking to build around. His flashes have to turn into a consistent burn if he\u2019s going to take the next steps and finally lead the Magic out of their playoff fog. I know what you are thinking. We are all thinking the same thing after watching these Suns stumble on an extended loop. But a floor-balancing big to pair with budding star Devin Booker (the best non-Splash Brother shooter on this planet) and versatile rookie swingman Josh Jackson will go a long way towards resuscitating things in the Valley of the Sun. If things bounce right on lottery night, the Suns will have their pick from a diverse crop of long, athletic talents. Perhaps the better question is who will be around to guide this crew? Chris Webber and Mike Bibby aren\u2019t walking through that door, Sacramento. Vlade Divac and Peja Stojakovic, however, are already in the building. And the former Kings stars are leading the front-office charge for the Kings, whose assemblage of young talent finally looks like it might fit together. Now comes the hard part: figuring out if De\u2019Aron Fox, Buddy Hield, Bogdan Bogdanovic and Willie Cauley-Stein are the leaders of a renaissance or the latest casualties in the Kings\u2019 seemingly never-ending franchise-renovation project? Player development will continue to be crucial. But there is talent in place with more on the way via the Draft. * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

News of Vogel\u2019s ousting came earlier this morning, per ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski and others who confirmed the move. The team released the following statement on Thursday morning : The Magic hired Vogel after he did not have his contract renewed as coach of the Indiana Pacers after the 2015-16 season . With the Pacers, Vogel took the team to consecutive Eastern Conference finals in 2012 and \u201913, losing to the Miami Heat both times. He spent six seasons with the Pacers, going 250-181 overall and 31-30 in the playoffs. Vogel moved on to Orlando shortly after coach Scott Skiles shocked the team by resigning as coach in May of 2016 . Roughly a week later, the Magic hired Vogel as CEO Alex Martins and then-general manager Rob Hennigan both said they wanted a coach who has strong defensive principles and can connect with the players. At the time, Vogel inherited a young, talented team that featured Nikola Vucevic, Aaron Gordon, Victor Oladipo, Evan Fournier and Elfrid Payton. In Vogel\u2019s first season with the Magic, the team tried to play three big men \u2014 Bismack Biyombo, Serge Ibaka and Vucevic \u2014 at the same time and did not have good results with it. The team eventually dealt Ibaka to the Toronto Raptors in February of 2017 and traded Payton to the Phoenix Suns at the trade deadline this season .

The regular season ended with a flourish. Wednesday\u2019s final night of the regular season was well beyond dramatic \u2014 an overtime game between Minnesota and Denver to decide the last berth, another overtime game between Miami and Toronto to determine some East fates, a 46-point first quarter by Philadelphia, an absurd 20-rebound, 19-assist night from Russell Westbrook. And now, the best time of the NBA year is finally here. \u2022 Complete 2018 NBA Playoff Bracket The playoffs are back, with Golden State and Cleveland \u2014 who\u2019ve met in the last three NBA Finals \u2014 not exactly looking like the overwhelming favorites the league has come to expect. A fourth straight Warriors-Cavs matchup is no guarantee. A fourth straight trip by either of those teams alone is far from certain, either. It all starts Saturday, the 16-team tournament that will be a two-month grind following the six-month grind of the regular season. \u201cI feel pretty ready,\u201d Toronto guard Kyle Lowry said. \u201cWe\u2019re ready to go.\u201d So are 15 other teams. Start with the East pairings: Lowry and the top-seeded Raptors play No. 8 Washington, No. 2 Boston faces No. 7 Milwaukee, No. 3 Philadelphia gets No. 6 Miami and No. 4 Cleveland \u2013 with LeBron James bidding for an eighth consecutive appearance in The Finals \u2013 opening against No. 5 Indiana, a surprise team at the start of the season and one that isn\u2019t a surprise anymore. \u201cWe\u2019re one of 16 teams that have a chance to win a championship,\u201d James said. \u201cThat\u2019s all you can ask for.\u201d Philadelphia, after years of the rebuilding saga known as \u201cThe Process,\u201d has a chance as well. The 76ers are going into the playoffs on a 16-game winning streak. \u201cTake a deep breath, then reload,\u201d 76ers coach Brett Brown said, talking about what he wants his team to do before getting ready for Game 1. Out West, it\u2019s No. 1 Houston meeting No. 8 Minnesota \u2013 which earned its berth by topping Denver in the NBA\u2019s first win-and-get-in, lose-and-go-home regular-season finale in 21 years. No. 2 Golden State opens its quest for a third championship in four seasons against No. 7 San Antonio, No. 3 Portland drew No. 6 New Orleans and No. 4 Oklahoma City opens against No. 5 Utah. \u201cThe playoffs are about moments, and you just want a chance to have those moments,\u201d Miami guard Dwyane Wade said. For the Timberwolves, Wednesday was a moment in itself. They needed overtime to beat the Nuggets and get into the postseason. It\u2019s Minnesota\u2019s first berth since 2004, and ended what was the NBA\u2019s longest playoff drought (which now is bequeathed to the Sacramento Kings, who last played a playoff game in 2006). \u201cThey just made the plays at the end,\u201d Denver\u2019s Will Barton said of the Timberwolves. \u201cGive them credit.\u201d There are some rematches from the 2017 playoffs already waiting. Cleveland swept Indiana in the first round last year, and Boston needed seven games to oust Washington in a thrilling East semifinal series. But the most intriguing should be the Golden State-San Antonio matchup \u2013 because once again, just like a year ago, the Spurs will almost certainly be without Leonard. Those two teams played in the West finals last season, and the Spurs were up by 23 points when Leonard left in the third quarter after getting injured on a play where he tried a jumper and Warriors center Zaza Pachulia closed out aggressively. Leonard got hurt when he stepped on Pachulia on the landing; he and the Spurs haven\u2019t been the same since. Leonard never returned to that series, and played in only nine games for the Spurs this season. \u201cThere is no pressure on us,\u201d Spurs star LaMarcus Aldridge said. There is on Golden State. The Warriors are trying for a third title in four seasons, and will play this first round more than likely without Curry while he continues recovering from a knee injury. Golden State went 7-10 in its final 17 games, and clearly sputtered across the finish line. But the records all reset now, and the Warriors have been waiting to get the postseason started. \u201cIt\u2019ll be our first meaningful game in about a month,\u201d Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. \u201cLooking forward to that.\u201d With good reason. There\u2019s a trophy to go chase now."},{"id":40946,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-new-york-knicks-dismiss-coach-jeff-hornacek","date":"2018-04-12","title":"New York Knicks dismiss coach Jeff Hornacek","content":"The Knicks have cut ties with head coach Jeff Hornacek, the team announced on Thursday morning . ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski and the New York Post\u2019s Marc Berman were first to report the move early Thursday morning. The move came just hours after the Knicks finished the season with a 29-53 record. This season marks the fifth consecutive year the franchise has failed to make the postseason. \u201cWe looked out and we have a plan for what this team should look like over the next three years or so,\u201d Knicks President Steve Mills said. \u201cWe just thought this was an opportunity where we thought it was the right time to make a change.\u201d Mills and general manager Scott Perry said they didn\u2019t see enough improvement on the court and enough communication and accountability off it. They informed Hornacek of their decision at the airport after flying home from a season-ending victory in Cleveland. \u201cWe know the roster is not complete, we understand our roster as well as anybody,\u201d Perry said at a news conference at the team\u2019s training facility. \u201cBut again, just in terms of consistency and then a trend I would say toward consistency, Steve and I thought we fell a little bit short in that area.\u201d Associate head coach Kurt Rambis also was fired. Hornacek\u2019s time in The Big Apple was marred by a messy offseason parting with former All-Star Carmelo Anthony, whom the Knicks traded last summer to Oklahoma City. The team then tried to rebuild around Kristaps Porzingis, who appeared on his way to a breakout year. The 22-year-old\u2019s season was cut short, however, by a torn ACL in early February. At the time, the Knicks were already nine games under .500 and five games out of the playoffs. They spiraled further without Porzingis, enduring eight and nine-game losing streaks on the way to their third sub-30-win campaign over the last 10 years. Hornacek coached just two seasons with the Knicks after a two-and-a-half-year stint with Phoenix. He finishes his New York tenure with a record of 60-104 after going 101-112 with the Suns. The ouster sends the Knicks in search of their 11th coach since Jeff Van Gundy resigned in the 2001-02 season. Mills said he and Perry were evaluating Hornacek and the Knicks this season on 10-game intervals and saw progress in some areas but not in others. They met with Hornacek a couple of weeks ago to discuss where things stood, so Mills said he didn\u2019t think the decision was a complete shock to the coach. \u201cJeff is a positive person and I think he was hopeful that there would be another opportunity, but he\u2019s a pro,\u201d Mills said. \u201cHe\u2019s a good man and he took it well.\u201d Wojnarowski further reported that the Knicks are expected to contact Mark Jackson, David Fizdale, David Blatt and Jerry Stackhouse as candidates for their coaching vacancy.

Their 50th anniversary season was awful, even worse than the two that came before. For the eighth season in a row, the Suns won\u2019t make the playoffs. The win totals the past three seasons: 23, 24 and \u2013 this year 21. That 21-61 mark is the worst since Phoenix went 16-66 in its inaugural 1968-69 season. The season devolved in the final months, with injuries depleting the already exceedingly young roster, leaving a contingent of G League transfers to fill out the lineup in the final days. The Suns lost a franchise-record 15 straight in one stretch. Now, everyone involved is insisting, enough is enough. \u201cI\u2019m done with not making the playoffs,\u201d rising star Devin Booker said as the players cleaned out their lockers and conducted exit interviews Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019m serious. This is probably my last year ever not making the playoffs. If that\u2019s putting pressure on myself, I\u2019m going to take this summer and work that hard so that it doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d His goal is \u201cturning the franchise around and getting it back how it used to be.\u201d  \u201cYou watch the highlights of Barkley, Nash and them and how alive the arena was,\u201d Booker said. \u201cSo one of my goals is to get it back that way.\u201d Booker, T.J. Warren and rookie Josh Jackson form the core of the young talent the Suns have accumulated. Dragan Bender and Marquese Chriss could be part of it, too, although their development has been uneven. But Phoenix needs experienced players, and not just old guys to cheer on from the sidelines. \u201cThe voice in the locker room or the voice when they\u2019re teaching carries a lot more weight when the person is contributing,\u201d interim coach Jay Triano said, \u201cnot just there as a teacher. \u2026 They need those guys on the court to follow.\u201d General manager Ryan McDonough agrees the time is come to ratchet up investment. To begin with, Phoenix has the most ping pong balls in the May 15 lottery and a chance at the No. 1 overall pick. At worst, the Suns will draft No. 4. They will have one, and maybe two, more first-round picks. \u201cWe\u2019ll be one of five or six teams with more than $10 million in cap space,\u201d McDonough said, \u201cand I think we have the ability to create significantly more if we want it.\u201d So the assets are there if they can be translated into needed players, and not teenagers, except that early first-round pick. Three years of concentrating on acquiring this young talent is long enough, McDonough said. \u201cIf you go beyond that I think the losing starts to set in and the guys start to become accustomed to that and the bar is lower,\u201d he said. \u201cNext year we\u2019re going to try to raise the bar. We\u2019re going to try to raise our standards. We won\u2019t be as young. We won\u2019t have nearly as many young players as we had last year.\u201d A couple of things to consider after the Suns\u2019 miserable season. COACH SEARCH: McDonough said the search will begin immediately for a head coach with a list of five to 10 candidates in mind. Triano would like the job. He took over after Earl Watson was fired just three games into the season. McDonough said he would like to have a coach in place before the draft combine and lottery in mid-May. BOOKER\u2019S CONTRACT: The Suns would like to have Booker sign a maximum contract extension in the offseason and he\u2019s open to the idea. Triano knows that Booker is tired of losing and believes things will get better for his budding star with more experienced talent around him. \u201cHe looks around the locker room and sees what it is and he knows that it\u2019s time,\u201d Triano said. \u201cI think the growth that he\u2019s gone through individually as a leader and the capability he\u2019s been able to show as a scorer has set the tone to make this an attractive place and to have him be the focal part of that. People around the league want to play with Devin Booker.\u201d KNIGHT IN WAITING: One of the biggest needs for Arizona is at point guard, and they\u2019ve had one watching from the sidelines all season. Brandon Knight, left over from the old days of three point guards with Eric Bledsoe and Isaiah Thomas, missed the entire season with a torn ACL. Once stuck at the end of the bench with no playing time when he was able to go, he\u2019s being talked about as the starter alongside Booker next year. \u201cAs a competitor, as a winner, I just love to play the game,\u201d Knight said. \u201cI had the game taken away from me by the injuries and due to other things. \u2026 I\u2019m just trying to help the Suns in any way I can.\u201d"},{"id":40942,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/lebron-james-plays-all-82-games-first-time-career","date":"2018-04-12","title":"LeBron James plays all 82 games for first time in career","content":" CLEVELAND (AP) \u2014 LeBron James capped his 15th regular season with yet another record. James played in his 82nd game on Wednesday night against the New York Knicks, completing an end to end run that underscores the 33-year-old\u2019s remarkable consistency. The four-time MVP had never played every game in a regular season as he typically sits out games at the end of the year to rest for the playoffs. Not this year. James\u2019 previous high was 81 games in 2008-09, when then-coach Mike Brown sat him for the Cavs\u2019 regular-season finale. James never made playing every game a goal, but he has said he wants to break the mold for players of his age. Cavs coach Tyronn Lue said he tried to talk James out of playing, but relented. \u201cHe wants to play,\u201d Lue said. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s hard to play 82 games. I was in the league 11 years. Never had a chance to get to 82. Everything has to go absolutely right. He wants to play and I guess in his 15th year to get to 82, it really says a lot. It says a lot about him. But once he gets his 10 points, don\u2019t be surprised if I yank him out. He might get mad, but I don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t care.\u201d And Lue kept his word. After James scored 10 points, extending his NBA record for scoring in double digits to 873 games, Lue sent in Jordan Clarkson for the three-time champion. James will finish the season leading the league in points and minutes played. He entered the finale averaging 27.7 points with career-highs in assists (9.2) assists and rebounds (8.7). He\u2019s not expected to be named MVP as Houston\u2019s James Harden remains the favorite, but James remains the game\u2019s unquestioned best all-around player. James will also lead the Cavs in total points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocks."},{"id":40941,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/russell-westbrook-secures-triple-double-average-second-consecutive-season","date":"2018-04-12","title":"Russell Westbrook secures triple-double average for second consecutive season","content":"Russell Westbrook joined Oscar Robertson last season as the only players to average a triple-double per game over the course of an entire season.

The Sixers have won a team-record 15 straight games and can wrap up the third seed in the Eastern Conference with a home victory over the Milwaukee Bucks on Wednesday night. Embiid said he hoped the NBA would allow him to wear a black mask that made him look like the 76ers\u2019 version of Zorro. \u201cWith a clear mask, it kind of feels like there\u2019s so much reflection, and I can\u2019t really see,\u201d he said. \u201cWith the black mask, it kind of gives you a clear vision. Hopefully, it gets approved and I get to play in it.\u201d Embiid has yet to participate in any contact drills and has limited his activities to light workouts. Embiid is used to sitting out with the Sixers \u2013 he missed his first two seasons with a broken foot and played just 31 games last season because of a knee injury. The Sixers had been cautious this season and initially held him out of the back end of consecutive games on the schedule. But he stayed healthy until the freak injury and developed into one of the league\u2019s top defenders (1.8 blocks, 38 double-doubles). He stumped for Brett Brown to win NBA coach of the year, teammate Ben Simmons for rookie of the year and himself, naturally, to win NBA defensive player of the year. \u201cI feel I\u2019ve been the best defensive player in the league this year,\u201d Embiid said. \u201cWe have the resume.

The Rockets have been the best team in the league all season, seamlessly integrating Chris Paul, P.J. Tucker and Luc Mbah a Moute seamlessly, and Harden was the reason why. And what James has done at age 33, as The Finals team from last season was dismantled, rebuilt, dismantled again in the middle of the season out of desperation and reconfigured again, is crazy. No, I\u2019m not telling you who I\u2019m voting for. Watch the Awards Show on TNT in June . Steve Aschburner :  1. James Harden , 2. LeBron James , 3. Anthony Davis . Whatever the criteria, Harden to me is the clear No. 1 candidate. He\u2019s the best player by far on the best team by far , compared to James or anyone else. He\u2019s a stud in efficiency rating, he\u2019s the league\u2019s leading scorer , he has adapted yet again (last year to be more of a team guy, this season to play alongside Chris Paul) and he has some sentiment on his side after getting steamrolled in 2016-17 by Russell Westbrook\u2019s triple-double express . James\u2019 stats have been remarkable for a player at age 33 (the 15th year \u201cthing\u201d owes to his head start right out of high school, so that matters less to me for historical comparisons). But he also has to own the Cavaliers\u2019 soap-opera sag prior to the trade deadline and a middle-of-the-East playoff seed. Davis helped the Pelicans to a better record after DeMarcus Cousins went down than they had with him, which nary a soul could have expected. Shaun Powell :  First: James Harden. From start to finish he delivered the best performance and elevated his team to the top in the very tough West, even with Chris Paul missing a chunk of action. Second: LeBron James. Quite simply, the best player in the game with the best performance by anyone since the calendar flipped to 2018. We\u2019ve never seen anyone this old this good. Third: Russell Westbrook. Surely, people will howl and ask about Anthony Davis and that is understandable. But if you gave him MVP for averaging a triple-double last season \u2014 which I did \u2014 how do you totally dismiss him for consideration this season when he essentially does the same thing ? John Schuhmann :  1. James Harden: The Rockets have been the best team in the league, and he\u2019s the primary operator of that train. 2. LeBron James: An incredible offensive season. He remains the best player in the world. 3. Anthony Davis: He has always put up numbers, but he took a step forward this season in regard to making the team around him better. Sekou Smith : This is a cruel question for the guy who has been stewing over this order all season on the Kia Race to the MVP Ladder . But I know we\u2019ve finally come to the finish line of this season\u2019s race and it\u2019s time to go ahead and hand out the hardware. James Harden tops my list and will finally get his hands on that Maurice Podoloff Trophy he made space for years ago. Debate it all you want. But it\u2019s his time. LeBron James comes in second , having put together a season worthy of Kia MVP honors yet again. Anthony Davis finishes third on my list, having been the best player on Earth for that six-week stretch after the shock of Cousins\u2019 season-ending injury wore off. Davis helped the New Orleans Pelicans climb back into the Western Conference playoff picture. \u201cThe Brow\u2019s\u201d time is coming. * * *"},{"id":47363,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-first-time-playoff-performer-most-eager-watch-2018-playoffs","date":"2018-04-11","title":"Blogtable: First-time playoff performer you're most eager to see?","content":"* * * Which first-time playoff performer are you most eager to see?  * * * David Aldridge :  Why, Mr. Process, of course! How can you not be geeked to find out what Joel Embiid will do on the big stage? There\u2019s so much that he (and Ben Simmons) have to learn about playoff basketball, and there will no doubt be stumbles and fumbles along the way. But Embiid has Finals MVP talent; he\u2019s capable of dominating games at both ends of the floor and handling the media crush that comes in the postseason with charm and aplomb. He is, as Erik Spoelstra likes to say, built for this. Steve Aschburner : Utah Jazz guard Ricky Rubio , if only because there\u2019s some justice for the feisty point guard in reaching the postseason a few days ahead of the team that discarded him (assuming Minnesota gets there Wednesday night). Rubio has improved as a shooter for the third consecutive year and has had a solid season overall for Utah, a team that potential Western Conference foes are smart to dread. The difference in Rubio\u2019s production from Jeff Teague, the point guard who replaced him in Minnesota (at a considerable bump in pay), was slight, with Teague more stylistically suited to Tom Thibodeau\u2019s Wolves but Rubio the better defender. Based on seeding, Rubio\u2019s season is likely to last longer, too. Shaun Powell :  Joel Embiid is the choice , if only because of everything he has gone through, injury-wise \u2014 and continues to go through, given his eye socket injury . He\u2019s made for the spectacle because of his massive talent and robust personality, which should play favorably on the big stage. The NBA playoffs are better off with the league\u2019s young stars still around to get some shine, and the spotlight will love Embiid. And vice versa. John Schuhmann :  Ben Simmons. I not only want to see how he performs, but also how opponents defend him. Will he be able to play with the pace that he wants to when defenses are more focused on getting back in transition? How will his inability to shoot from distance affect the defense when he doesn\u2019t have the ball? The Sixers have improved offensively as the season has gone on and they keep the ball and bodies moving, so it will be interesting to see what opposing defenses try to take away from them.  Sekou Smith :  The more I see from Ben Simmons, the more intrigued I am by his game. What will his limitations as a perimeter shooter mean for the walking triple-double? How will he adjust in a playoff atmosphere to defenses designed (and daring him) to beat them with outside shots? Is he capable of adjusting and remaining just as effective with the added pressure of the postseason? I apologize for answering a question with a couple questions of my own, but it\u2019s strange for there to be this must intrigue about a player we\u2019ve studied so intently all season. That said, Simmons and Joel Embiid together make the Sixers a must-watch for as long as their maiden playoff voyage lasts."},{"id":47416,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-lebron-james-cleveland-cavaliers-closing-82-games-played","date":"2018-04-11","title":"Blogtable: Your thoughts on LeBron James being on cusp of playing all 82 games?","content":"* * * LeBron James is on the verge of playing in all 82 games for the first time in his career. Is this a big thing, a little thing, or much ado about nothing?  * * * David Aldridge :  MAAN. If it means something to him, fine. It means nothing to anyone else. All that matters is what he and the Cavs do starting this weekend. An eighth straight Finals appearance would be Bill Russel-esque. Who else could you compare that with? Steve Aschburner : Little thing. In this day and age, with the researchers telling us that the very best NBA performances would come from guys who averaged about one game a month and 29 days of rest, there is something notable, maybe even laudable against the low expectations, about those like James and a handful of others who show up for work \u2014 and for the ticket buyers \u2014 every night. But suggesting this should be a factor in Kia MVP voting? Or just swooning in general over his want-to or durability? Please. Michael Jordan played 82 games nine times. So did Karl Malone. A bunch of Hall of Famers routinely punched the clock every night despite facing back-to-back-to-back schedules and a lack of charter flights or cryotherapy chambers. It\u2019s not basketball history\u2019s fault James waited until he was 33 to do it even once. Shaun Powell :  In today\u2019s NBA? This is a very, very big thing. LeBron is doing this with 14 years of wear (including eight Finals runs) on his body and yet volunteers to give everyone their money\u2019s worth by not taking games off, possessions off or even plays off. We as basketball fans should extend a thank-you to LeBron, and while I realize folks don\u2019t deserve a pat on the back for doing what they\u2019re supposed to do (and also, playing 82 was par for the course for Jordan, Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, et al), LeBron is the counter argument to the notion that NBA stars deserve their rest, to preserve them and protect them. Well: Who\u2019s more valuable to the NBA than LeBron? John Schuhmann :  A little thing. It\u2019s cool for him and we shouldn\u2019t take for granted what this guy is doing at the age of 33, having played 9,000 more minutes than any other player since he was drafted. But 82 instead of 78 doesn\u2019t have much of an effect on his legacy, on the Cavs\u2019 season, or on the league as a whole. What matters is whether or not he flips the switch on defense when the Cavs need him to be more engaged on that end of the floor. Sekou Smith :  Symbolically, it\u2019s a huge deal to see LeBron check off yet another item on his \u201cNobody Does It Better\u201d list. For this guy, at 33 \u2014 after 14 seasons and 146 playoff games in the past seven postseasons \u2014 to pull this off is staggering. Sure, he\u2019s showing off. He\u2019s trolling all of the other guys who have been sucker punched by Father Time late in their careers. And he\u2019s certainly taken his fair share of breathers during games this season, especially on the defensive end. But to grind like this so late in his storied career, the feat should not be dismissed as yet another trivial pursuit carried out by a man who has made every detail of his career a potential milestone. This is a feat of endurance and strength that is worthy of whatever praise you are willing to lavish upon this guy."},{"id":47690,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-minnesota-timberwolves-denver-nuggets-season-finale-picks","date":"2018-04-11","title":"Blogtable: Your pick for tonight's Denver Nuggets-Minnesota Timberwolves showdown?","content":" * * * Nuggets or Timberwolves? Who will win tonight\u2019s showdown and grab the final playoff spot in the West?  * * * * Tonight on NBA TV:  Nuggets vs. Timberwolves (8 ET) David Aldridge : I\u2019m going Wolves , with no particular enthusiasm and for no reason other than they\u2019re at home. Denver\u2019s been playing much better ball than Minnesota down the stretch, and maybe a vet like Paul Millsap who\u2019s been in a million playoff games carries them across the finish line tonight. But I\u2019m betting the Wolves get a huge night behind what should be a loud crowd from an unexpected source \u2014 maybe a Jeff Teague \u2014 in support of Karl-Anthony Towns and\/or Jimmy Butler. Steve Aschburner :  Timberwolves. They\u2019ve got the home court in their, and Denver\u2019s, most important game of the season. And Tom Thibodeau has a veteran-driven lineup with at least one young star (Karl Anthony Towns \u2014 not you, Andrew Wiggins) he can count on and, this is key, grind on for 48 minutes. Not a single officer in the Minnesota media-and-fan-base\u2019s \u201cminutes police\u201d will say boo tonight. The offseason, if the Wolves fail to qualify, will hold untold grief for and wailing about what\u2019s wrong with the roster, the porous defense, the \u201cantiquated\u201d offense and Thibs wearing two hats as head coach and president of basketball ops. But he gets to work this game first, with the power to completely change those narratives. Shaun Powell :  In what is essentially a coin flip, I\u2019m taking the Timberwolves. Truthfully, neither team should be in the position of fighting for the final playoff spot in the West. There\u2019s just too much good and emerging talent on both the Nuggets and Wolves, and yes, I realize Paul Millsap and Jimmy Butler did miss chunks of time. But the New Orleans Pelicans (DeMarcus Cousins) and Utah Jazz (Rudy Gobert; Gordon Hayward\u2019s offseason departure) weren\u2019t whole, either, and they didn\u2019t sweat this much. Minnesota needs this more, given their league-long playoff drought and the heat (from the public, mostly) that might be directed towards coach Tom Thibodeau. John Schuhmann :  The Wolves are at home, but the Nuggets have obviously been playing better. Neither team has a reliable defense ( whichever team wins will be the second worst defensive team in the playoffs ), so it may just be a make-or-miss night, and the Nuggets are the better shooting team from the outside. The bottom line is that anything can happen in a single game, so you\u2019re not getting a real prediction here. It\u2019s just amazing that the second-longest playoff drought in NBA history is on the line on the final night of the season. Hopefully, this game goes down to the wire.  Sekou Smith : The Timberwolves have home court on their side and should be able to handle their business in a win-or-go-home contest of this sort. So I am, of course, going with the Nuggets. I think they\u2019ve responded the way you want a team to when they are faced with win-or-it-is-over games basically every night since that March 30 win over the Thunder in Oklahoma City. It doesn\u2019t matter who it is or where they\u2019ve had to play, the Nuggets have shown the sort of mettle it takes to put yourself in a position where you truly control your own destiny. They\u2019re going to do the same in this one, which should be an absolutely knock-down, drag-out affair for both teams. I\u2019m looking forward to watching every second of what should be the game of the final night of this regular season."},{"id":47370,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/denver-nuggets-minnesota-timberwolves-ready-end-season-showdown","date":"2018-04-11","title":"Playoff spot on line for Denver Nuggets, Minnesota Timberwolves tonight","content":" * Tonight on NBA TV:  Nuggets vs. Timberwolves (8 ET) Win and you are in. Five magic words every team hopes to hear at some point in their season when it comes to a playoff spot. For the Minnesota Timberwolves and Denver Nuggets, that phrase is true for both teams as they face each other in the season\u2019s final game. For Minnesota, this is a chance to end a playoff drought that has been in place since 2004. Denver\u2019s postseason dry spell isn\u2019t nearly as long (they last made it in 2013), but they aren\u2019t looking to make offseason vacation plans just yet either. And, this game is just one of many tonight that will shape the run for 11 playoff seeds that are up for grabs. Gina Mizell of The Denver Post writes on the change she\u2019s seen in the Nuggets during their six-game win streak, including their belief in themselves that is as rock-solid as ever. In particular, she reports on how a team meeting after Denver\u2019s back-to-back losses in Toronto and Philadelphia two weeks ago sharpened the team\u2019s resolve : In Minnesota, a February injury to All-Star guard Jimmy Butler, some inexplicable losses and surges by other squads in the Western Conference have put the Wolves in this win-or-go-home situation.

Actually, for Atlanta, Phoenix, Dallas and Charlotte, the end came in their season finales Tuesday. There are nine teams who know Wednesday is the last day of their season. Another 15 teams have already clinched playoff berths. Then there\u2019s Minnesota and Denver. > How Tuesday\u2019s action affected positioning | Complete playoff picture Game 82 for both teams will have a Game 7 feel, which is a fitting way to transition from the regular season to the postseason. Nuggets at Timberwolves, winner to the playoffs, loser to the offseason. It\u2019s the first time since 1997 \u2013 and only the third time since the NBA went to this postseason format in 1983 \u2013 that two teams will play on the season\u2019s final day in such a situation. \u201cIt\u2019s bigger than all of us,\u201d Minnesota star Karl-Anthony Towns said. Minnesota is trying to get into the playoffs for the first time since 2004 \u2013 the longest current drought in the NBA. Denver \u2013 winner of six straight to give itself this chance \u2013 is trying to get to the postseason for the first time since 2013. So there\u2019s only one spot left in the 16-team tournament that will decide whose fingerprints get to put the smudge of a championship celebration on the Larry O\u2019Brien Trophy in June. Much like the race between Minnesota and Denver, the entire tournament bracket itself is going down to the wire. There will be eight first-round matchups, and every single one of those pairings will be decided on Wednesday. So, too, will 11 of the 16 seeds. Portland and Utah will play for the No. 3 seed in the West, in one of the few cut-and-dry matchups. The only order of business that was cleared up Tuesday was the No. 2 overall seed, with Toronto now assured of finishing with the NBA\u2019s second-best record. Here\u2019s 10 other things to note going into the last day of the regular season: A FIRST FOR LEBRON It\u2019s really, really, really hard to find something that LeBron James hasn\u2019t done in his career. But if he appears for Cleveland against New York on Wednesday night, it will mark the first time in James\u2019 15 seasons that he plays in all 82 regular-season games. He will lead the NBA in minutes played, field goals made and total points this season \u2013 at 33 years old. PHILLY RECORD Philadelphia would be the No. 3 seed in the East if it beats Milwaukee, and a franchise that knew nothing but losing (OK, \u201cprocess\u201d losing) in recent years will set a record \u2013 for winning. If the 76ers prevail, it would be their 16th consecutive victory and that would top the record for longest winning streak to end any NBA season. SCORING TITLE Houston\u2019s James Harden has the scoring crown wrapped up. He\u2019ll be the first player to win back-to-back scoring titles since his former Oklahoma City teammate Kevin Durant won three straight from 2009-10 through 2011-12. MORE POINTS Once again, the NBA will see more points than ever (in terms of total, not average per game). There were 259,753 points in the regular season a year ago; that will be surpassed Wednesday night, and the league is on pace to reach somewhere around 261,000 by the time the final whistle blows. TRIPLE-DOUBLE RUSS Oklahoma City\u2019s Russell Westbrook needs 16 rebounds against Memphis to average exactly 10.0 per game this season. If he gets there, he\u2019ll average a triple-double for the second consecutive year. Westbrook has six games this season with at least 16 rebounds, including a season-high, 18-board effort at Miami on Monday night. Westbrook will also lead the NBA in assists per game. STRUGGLING WARRIORS Golden State lost 10 of its final 17 games this season. The Warriors\u2019 regular season ended Tuesday with a blowout loss at Utah. Klay Thompson isn\u2019t worried, and he knows the defending champions \u2013 who have dealt with many injuries, most recently Stephen Curry out with a knee issue \u2013 have plenty of doubters. \u201cWe\u2019re ready to prove people wrong,\u201d Thompson said. TOP SHOOTER The field-goal percentage race between Houston\u2019s Clint Capela and the Los Angeles Clippers\u2019 DeAndre Jordan might look closer than it really is. Capela is shooting 65.3 percent, Jordan 64.3 percent \u2013 but if Jordan is going to catch Capela, he\u2019ll have to shoot 15 for 15 on Wednesday (assuming Capela doesn\u2019t take any shots). Jordan was trying to be the first player to lead the league in shooting for six straight seasons, but it seems like he\u2019ll merely have to settle for tying Wilt Chamberlain and Shaquille O\u2019Neal with five straight crowns. TOP REBOUNDER Another category where Jordan will finish second. Detroit\u2019s Andre Drummond will lead the league\u2019s rebounding race for the second time in three years. WILD NORTHWEST The Northwest Division this season will go down as the most competitive in the current six-division format \u2013 and it\u2019s not even close. The team that finishes last in the Northwest this season will be only three games behind the team that wins the division crown. There\u2019s never been a last-place team within less than 11 games of the winner in this current format, which has been in play for 14 seasons. ROOKIE WATCH There have been 116 rookies in the NBA this season, up 28 from last season, and the latest addition is noteworthy. Andre Ingram is a 32-year-old who debuted Tuesday for the Los Angeles Lakers against Houston. He\u2019s the oldest rookie this season and he more than paid his dues, having logged 384 games in what\u2019s now called the G League \u2013 where he\u2019s the career leader in 3-pointers (713).

In fact, the only order of business that was cleared up was the No. 2 overall seed, with Toronto now assured of finishing with the NBA\u2019s second-best record. All eight first-round matchups will be determined Wednesday night. Sixers 121, Hawks 113 JJ Redick scored 28 points and the surging Sixers set a franchise record with their 15th consecutive victory, holding off Atlanta to move a step closer to locking up the No. 3 seed in the Eastern Conference. The Sixers can secure the No. 3 seed with a win over Milwaukee in the regular-season finale. Jazz 119, Warriors 79 Donovan Mitchell scored 22 points and set the NBA rookie record for 3-pointers as Utah rolled past Golden State. The Jazz can claim the No. 3 seed in the Western Conference with a win over Portland on Wednesday night. Even with a loss to the Blazers, Utah is assured of falling no lower than the No. 5 seed.

The clinched East seeds are No. 1 Toronto, No. 2 Boston and No. 5 Indiana. \u2022 The Portland-Utah winner will finish No. 3 in the Western Conference, but if the Jazz lose they could fall as far as No. 5 depending on the outcome of other games. \u2022 San Antonio, Oklahoma City and New Orleans could all be anywhere from fourth through eighth in the West. Minnesota would finish anywhere from fifth through eighth if it tops Denver, and the Nuggets \u2014 if they beat the Timberwolves \u2014 will be fifth, sixth or seventh. \u2022 Philadelphia and Cleveland will be No. 3 and No. 4 in the East, in some order. \u2022 Milwaukee, Miami and Washington all could finish either sixth, seventh or eighth in the East. 10 other things to note heading into the last day of the regular season: A First For LeBron It\u2019s really, really, really hard to find something that LeBron James hasn\u2019t done in his career.

Hey, if nothing else, it beats wiping away the stench of losing, which is what coach Brett Brown was doing this time the last few years before this club finally grew up and as we now see, blew up. \u201cThis year we exceeded 50 wins and when you do that, you get into NBA elite territory which is something different for us,\u201d he said. \u201cBut what\u2019s interesting is we want more. We have more room to grow and we want to do that now.\u201d Yes, the Sixers, finally sprung free of the dark ages, have crashed the annual spring show and are doing so rather emphatically in addition to surprisingly. Surely you saw this coming this quickly, no? On Christmas Eve they were 14-18. Their sensational big man, Joel Embiid, was getting the kid glove treatment, rarely playing extended minutes or consecutive games because of his brittle injury history. Their top draft pick, Markelle Fultz, was out with a bad shoulder and a broken jumper. Obviously, they\u2019d just emerged from their four years of Tankapalooza with the trepidation of a chick stumbling from the nest. And quite simply, four months ago they just weren\u2019t good enough to be lumped with the lead pack. Yet. But since then, what the hell just happened? \u201cThis group has come together from a toughness standpoint, a spirit standpoint,\u201d Brown said. To say the least. The Sixers are 50-game winners, with a strong Kia Rookie of the Year candidate in Ben Simmons and a top-10 talent in Embiid, whose orbital injury that cost him the final eight regular season games should be healed for the playoffs at some point. Everything has fallen into place to make Philly a basketball destination once again, and these Sixers find themselves in a unique situation heading into the weekend. That\u2019s because the playoff landscape in the East is favorable for someone like Philly to pull a surprise or two. Can they last a round? Of course; they\u2019ll be a favorite initially. How about reaching the Eastern Conference finals? That\u2019s trickier, and it\u2019ll come down to matchups, but stranger things have happened. And, the NBA Finals? Well. Consider that there\u2019s no true beast taking up space in the East and sending shivers everywhere. All of the contenders are showing a scratch or two: Toronto brings a blah playoff history; some of LeBron James\u2019 supporting cast in Cleveland is untested; the Celtics are without Kyrie Irving, not to mention Gordon Hayward. The Sixers are the wild card in the playoff picture. Their wart is their inexperience in these matters. And so: Are they too young to be taken seriously? \u201cI understand why people might think that, but I think we\u2019ll be fine,\u201d said JJ Redick, the resident senior citizen at age 33. \u201cI don\u2019t expect any of us to play differently than we have lately. These young guys are all gamers.\u201d The Sixers are uniquely built; their twin core of Simmons and Embiid has played a combined three NBA seasons. Redick is the only starter with playoff experience and is also the only player in the rotation who ever played a major role in the playoffs. The Sixers are cubs compared to most of the East, even those teams below them. Essentially, the veterans on the Sixers orbit around the youngsters, instead of vice versa. Brown regularly takes the temperature of his players and has yet to pause at the results he\u2019s seeing. For the most part, this has worked out better than he and they expected. \u201cAt this stage you figure how you deliver a team to the playoffs, how do you arrive at the playoffs,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWell, you can check three boxes: Their health, their spirit and their form. And finally: Are they playing good basketball? They\u2019re all very interconnected, they\u2019re all closely intertwined. Those things rule my day when I watch film and see how hard and long we\u2019re going to go in practice. These guys have embraced and improved in those areas. Our defense has been excellent and we\u2019re regularly getting 30 assists as a team, another example of a team enjoying each other\u2019s company.\u201d This makes for an interesting postseason baptism. There\u2019s hope in Philly that Simmons and Embiid and Robert Covington and Dario Saric won\u2019t know the difference between March basketball and May basketball. \u201cWe\u2019ll just come and play the same way we\u2019ve been doing,\u201d Simmons said. The other advantage for Philly is Simmons appears well beyond his years. His expression is stoic, no matter the game circumstances, and his poise has yet to shatter memorably and cost the Sixers when it counts. He\u2019s giving 16 points, eight rebounds and eight assists a night and had at least 10 points, five rebounds and five assists in 58 games, second only to Russell Westbrook and LeBron James. He is the first rookie in NBA history to average eight assists on a 50-win team. It remains to be seen how a 56-percent free throw shooter will respond if he\u2019s put in that situation with the game on the line. Otherwise, his court direction and ability to reach the rim should not suffer from springtime stage fright. \u201cBen sits behind a glass wall and watches everyone else on the other side,\u201d Redick said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing that affects him. He plays with the same demeanor and purpose no matter what\u2019s going on around him. He brings a calm presence, and the maturity he plays with is beyond his years. Impressive.\u201d Brown said: \u201cHe\u2019s the stone cold Rookie of the Year and to me it\u2019s not even close.\u201d Philly\u2019s best player is Embiid, though, and he\u2019ll play with a mask once he does return, perhaps sometime in the first round. If he doesn\u2019t suffer any lasting effects from the facial injury (vision, lack of balance), he\u2019ll be the premier big man on the floor in the East. This allows the Sixers to exploit their low-post advantage over the Celtics, Raptors and Cavs should Philly meet any of those contenders along the way. The Sixers are also working with a pair of bonuses in Fultz and Ersan Ilyasova, two players they didn\u2019t anticipate being in the playoff mix just a few months ago. Fultz is finally free of his shoulder woes and his shooting is starting to come around, to the point where Brown says he\u2019ll find a role for Fultz in the rotation. Basically, the Sixers feel safe enough to put him on the floor, something that would\u2019ve been a reach before he was activated, when he showed a nasty mechanical hitch in a jumper that somehow went south on him. \u201cWe don\u2019t feel we\u2019re going to be caught off guard with him,\u201d Brown said. Ilyasova was gift-wrapped to Philly by the Hawks at midseason and has since been a solid source of scoring (17 points in a two-point win over Cleveland last week) and deepened the Sixers\u2019 bench, allowing Brown to use a variety of different lineups and strategies. In all, the manner in which the season has come together is paying off at the right time for Philly. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have this level of maturity in November and December,\u201d Redick said. \u201cIf you look at some of our losses early in the season I felt they were immature losses. We\u2019re more focused, more together, developed a mental toughness. Sometimes in life and in this league you have to go through things and experience things to grasp how to do them. There\u2019s no better learning tool than the actual experience. So blowing a lead or coming back from a large halftime deficit, you have to do those things to understand that you can do it. Having those lessons early in the season has prepared us to have a great run since Christmas; we have the second best record in the league since then. This is better than what I expected or even hoped for. It\u2019s been a long sustained growth period.\u201d What does it all mean? Well, even though they\u2019re entering the playoffs with the force of a hurricane, this isn\u2019t the NCAA tournament. This is best-of-seven basketball, which means a team must prove itself worthy of moving on, instead of hoping to get lucky or hot. In the case of Philly and others in the East, that means beating LeBron four times in a series, and that hasn\u2019t happened since 2010. You could also make the case the Sixers are playing with house money at this point, no matter what happens; after enduring The Process and painful progress, this is a blessing, a reward. The Sixers aren\u2019t seeing it that way, though, not after growing up in a hurry. They want to seize the opportunity now, and any playoff success will largely depend on how they handle this as first-timers. Your guess is as good as Brown\u2019s. \u201cYou really don\u2019t know what to expect,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThere\u2019s no body of work. I will give our guys the benefit of the doubt. The poise they have shown in the regular season, the poise they\u2019ve shown in big games and key moments, gives me tremendous confidence that we will handle this stage with a greater level of poise than what I might have guessed in October, or what I might have guessed not so long ago if you asked me questions about how will rookies and young guys handle this very different part of the season.\u201d Veteran NBA writer Shaun Powell has worked for newspapers and other publications for more than 25 years.

(AP) \u2014 Quinn Cook has been a remarkably steady fill-in for the injured Stephen Curry, and the Golden State Warriors rewarded the former two-way guard with a new contract Tuesday. The 25-year-old Cook, who has impressed his coaches and teammates with his growth and poise on and off the court, had to sign an NBA contract before the playoffs begin this weekend to be eligible. He received a two-year deal. Going into Tuesday\u2019s regular-season finale at Utah, Cook had reached double figures in scoring in 14 straight games.  \u201cI\u2019m thankful for the opportunity. I\u2019m just humbled, and it\u2019s just more motivation for me to help this team out as much as possible,\u201d Cook told beat reporters in Salt Lake City. \u201cI know they believe in me. It\u2019s just more motivation to get better as a teammate, as a player and just keep growing.\u201d  He was averaging 17.5 points, 4.1 rebounds, 4.9 assists and nearly one steal per game in 35 minutes during that 14-game stretch while shooting 53 percent and 50.7 percent from 3-point range.  Earlier this season, he became the first G League player to shoot at least 50 percent from the field, 40 percent on 3s and 90 percent from the free throw line.  \u201cI knew he had it in him. I knew he was an NBA player that was looking for an opportunity to validate that and take advantage of his talent and his skill and his confidence,\u201d said Curry, the two-time MVP nursing an injured left knee. \u201cI\u2019ve learned a lot from him and about him since he\u2019s been here. Nothing really wavers him. He\u2019s comfortable in his own skin and his ability. He knows he can help us out there and so he\u2019s been doing that. For somebody to take advantage of their opportunity like he has and understand there\u2019s so much pressure on him to keep his foot in the door, it doesn\u2019t seem like he\u2019s playing like that. It\u2019s just like he\u2019s meant to be here.\u201d  Cook\u2019s good-natured approach off the court has been noticeable, too. He goes around Oracle Arena before games with a smile shaking hands with ushers, security and others to introduce himself.  \u201cFirst thing it\u2019s a reminder of is that everybody in this league can play,\u201d coach Steve Kerr said. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s just opportunity. It doesn\u2019t surprise me at all what Quinn\u2019s doing. We\u2019ve watched him in the G League all year lighting it up. We watched him in practice here. He\u2019s one of our best shooters. And all of a sudden he\u2019s playing 40 minutes, this is what he can do. It\u2019s great to have this kind of depth.\u201d  Congratulations for Cook came in via social media.  \u201cDeserved!!!! He paid his dues,\u201d Dwyane Wade posted on Twitter.  Cook continually appears more at ease running the offense and dishing out the ball to an All-Star roster \u2013 not to mention looking for his own shot and knocking it down with confidence.  \u201cWhen I first got up here in December, I had no practice, I wasn\u2019t in training camp, nothing,\u201d Cook said recently. \u201cObviously, just to get thrown in the starting lineup and game situations, it\u2019s new at first, but I\u2019ve been up two months now. Every game I get more comfortable. Obviously, playing now and getting more comfortable every possession. I think that the guys around me help me to get comfortable every day.\u201d"},{"id":40958,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/philadelphia-76ers-forward-dario-saric-exits-lacerated-lip-chipped-tooth","date":"2018-04-11","title":"Philadelphia 76ers forward Dario Saric leaves game with chipped tooth, lacerated lip","content":"Sixers forward Dario Saric suffered a lacerated upper lip and chipped tooth in Tuesday\u2019s 121-113 victory over the against Hawks.

(AP) \u2014 Mitch Kupchak is confident Michael Jordan\u2019s Hornets will become an NBA playoff team again soon, possibly even next season. But just how he intends to help Charlotte get there remains unclear \u2013 for now. The Hornets new general manager and president of basketball operations said during his introductory news conference Tuesday this is a job he coveted. But the 63-year-old Kupchak was vague when it came to pressing questions surrounding the futures of the franchise\u2019s top player Kemba Walker, eight-time All-Star center Dwight Howard and coach Steve Clifford \u2013 as well as whether the team needs to undergo a complete rebuilding process. \u201cI\u2019m limited in my knowledge other than what I have seen on TV and learned in the last 48 hours,\u201d said Kupchak, who accepted the job on Sunday. No details have been released about the terms of his contract. He helped the Los Angeles Lakers win seven NBA titles and has spent 30 years as a front office executive, including 17 as the Lakers\u2019 general manager. He hopes to build a winner in Charlotte too \u2013 with Jordan\u2019s help. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I wouldn\u2019t seek out his opinion,\u201d said Kupchak, adding that Jordan is arguably the greatest player ever to play the game. Kupchak said Jordan is still very passionate about not only the NBA game, but the college game as well \u2013 and keeps up on the talent. \u201cI hope that most of the time we are on the same page and there may be a couple of times we are not,\u201d Kupchak said. \u201cHe may look at me and say, `You know Mitch, we don\u2019t see eye-to-eye on this but you do what is best.\u2019 Or he maybe he will look at me and say, `Mitch we don\u2019t see eye-to-eye on this one but this is my decision.\u2019 And that is his right as an owner.\u201d In Los Angeles, Kupchak inherited a roster from Jerry West where he acknowledged \u201cthe cupboards were full.\u201d Behind Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O\u2019Neal, the Lakers became a dynasty. Things are little different in Charlotte, which lacks the glitz of a big market like Los Angeles, the talent of a Golden State and the history of franchise like Boston. Kupchak inherits a team with 10 players under contract next season leaving the Hornets close the luxury tax threshold \u2013 making turning over the roster a little difficult. Charlotte\u2019s most tradable commodity is Walker, who has played in the last two All-Star games and is making just $12 million a year with one season left on his contract before becoming a free agent. Walker is the franchise\u2019s all-time leading scorer, but he\u2019s also stated that he would prefer to win playoff games rather than go through a rebuilding process. \u201cI like a player that doesn\u2019t want to be somewhere where they\u2019re going to lose,\u201d Kupchak said. \u201d \u2026 I know he\u2019s had an All-Star year. It\u2019s tough to answer the question with any certainty.\u201d He said the same goes for the 32-year-old Howard, who rebounded from two lackluster seasons in Houston and Atlanta with a solid campaign this season for the Hornets averaging 16.7 points, 12.4 rebound and 1.6 blocks in 80 games played. Howard played for Kupchak in Los Angeles when he was GM there, and Kupchak said he didn\u2019t want the big man to leave for Houston as a free agent. He said he\u2019s watched Howard play recently and likes what he\u2019s seen. \u201cHe is as lively and energetic as I have seen him play in years and years and years,\u201d Kupchak said. \u201cI know next year is the last year of his deal so there is some uncertainty with some of the players going forward.\u201d There is also uncertainty surrounding Clifford\u2019s future. Charlotte has made the playoffs twice in five seasons under Clifford, but has never advanced out of the first round. Clifford missed a large portion of this past season dealing with headaches related to sleep deprivation. Clifford spent one season with the Lakers and Kupchak felt at that time he had head coaching potential. But when asked directly about Clifford\u2019s future with the Hornets, Kupchak struck a popular refrain, saying he just got the job two days ago, \u201cso in all fairness I have not had the time\u201d to assess. As for whether the Hornets need to rebuild, Kupchak said, \u201cI don\u2019t know if that is the right word or not. I think our actions in the next three months might answer that question.\u201d"},{"id":40957,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nba-abc-viewership-upoffi","date":"2018-04-10","title":"NBA on ABC viewership up 17 percent for 2017-18 season","content":"The NBA on ABC averaged 3,818,000 viewers across 17 games during the 2017-18 regular season, up 17 percent from 3,265,000 viewers last season, according to Nielsen.

All but one of the 16 playoff spots have been clinched, with the Minnesota-Denver game on Wednesday deciding the final berth in the postseason. But going into Tuesday, the next-to-last day of the regular season, only five of the 16 seeds have been wrapped up. The Portland-Utah winner on Wednesday will finish No. 3 in the Western Conference, but if the Jazz lose they could fall as far as No. 7 depending on the outcome of other games. * Complete look at playoff scenarios for Tuesday night\u2019s games  (PDF) San Antonio, Oklahoma City and New Orleans could all be anywhere from fourth through eighth in the West. Minnesota would finish anywhere from fifth through eighth if it tops Denver, and the Nuggets \u2013 if they beat the Timberwolves \u2013 will be fifth, sixth or seventh. Houston is No. 1 in the West, followed by Golden State at No. 2. The clinched East seeds are No. 1 Toronto, No. 2 Boston and No. 5 Indiana. Philadelphia and Cleveland will be No. 3 and No. 4 in the East, in some order. Going into Tuesday, Milwaukee, Miami and Washington all could finish either sixth, seventh or eighth in the East. The playoffs start Wednesday. Officially, that\u2019s not true. But the Denver at Minnesota game on Wednesday night  (8 ET, NBA League Pass) may as well be considered a play-in game: Winner moves on, loser goes home. Monday started with four spots available out West, and ended with only one still unclaimed. New Orleans, San Antonio and Oklahoma City all won to clinch their playoff berths \u2013 the Spurs doing so for the 21st consecutive year, tying Portland for the second-longest run in NBA history and moving one shy of tying Philadelphia\u2019s league record (which started when the 76ers were the Syracuse Nationals). The funny part about Monday\u2019s triple-clinchings is that nothing changed in the standings. The order of the top eight remains the same, going into the next-to-last day of the regular season. It won\u2019t stay that way. Get ready for craziness. Portland and Utah can still get to No. 3. The Blazers, Jazz, Pelicans, Thunder and Spurs are in the mix for No. 4. The Spurs could also fall as far as No. 8. The Thunder, who are in seventh, cannot finish seventh. There\u2019s at least a dozen more scenarios. Wednesday night will be great fun. Cleveland won the Central Division and locked Indiana into the No. 5 seed with a win at New York. Milwaukee is now up to No. 6 in the East, flip-flopping spots with now-No. 7 Miami. The Bucks beat Orlando, while the Heat could get nothing going and got routed in the fourth quarter on the way to losing to the Thunder.

He was also on the other side of that transaction four years later, when James left the Heat to sign with the Cleveland Cavaliers in the summer of 2014. In a new book written by Ian Thomsen called \u201cThe Soul of Basketball: The Epic Showdown between LeBron, Kobe, Doc and Dirk that Saved the NBA,\u201d Riley opens up about how he felt in those days after James decided to head back to Ohio. ESPN\u2019s Jackie MacMullen got a look at the new book and has details on LeBron\u2019s exit from Miami : From 2010-11 to 2013-14, the Heat made four NBA Finals, winning championships in 2012 and 2013 while playing alongside fellow superstars Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh. In his second season with the Cavs, he led them to the championship and has helped them to The Finals each of the past three seasons. Although Miami was atop the NBA world during that four-season span, things with the Heat\u2019s \u201csuper team\u201d didn\u2019t start out great. Miami went 9-8 to open the 2010-11 season and in the book, Riley tells Thompson that James hinted at getting Riley to return to coaching and replace Erik Spoelstra. In the book, Riley says that the day after the Heat\u2019s loss to the Dallas Mavericks on Nov. 27, 2010 , he asked James, Wade and Bosh to meet him in his office for their thoughts on how the season was going. The book also details the infamous \u201cwelcome rally\u201d James, Wade and Bosh held after signing in which James promised \u201cnot two, not three, not four, not five, not six not seven [championships].\u201d Riley says in the book he was too concerned with the details of working out the deals to land Bosh and James (as well as re-sign Wade) to monitor the details of the celebration. Additionally, sources told ESPN that James and Riley have not spoken to each other since James left town in 2014. Per ESPN, James \u2014 according to a source familiar with his thinking \u2014 would be interested in thawing their relationship, but believes that Riley has no interest in doing so.

He\u2019s got another shot at that feat in 2017-18, but he\u2019ll have to have a monstrous game of sorts on the season\u2019s final night to do so again. Westbrook is averaging 25.6 points, 9.9 rebounds and a league-leading 10.1 assists per game. To make up that 0.1 rpg deficit that\u2019s keeping him from a triple-double average, Westbrook needs to grab 16 rebounds in Wednesday night\u2019s season finale at home against the Memphis Grizzlies ( 8 ET, NBA League Pass ). So far this season, Westbrook has notched six games in which he had 16 or more rebounds , the last one coming on Monday night. He got his 25th triple-double of the season (23 points, 18 rebounds, 13 assists) in last night\u2019s 115-93 win against the Miami Heat , helping the Thunder lock up a playoff berth. Westbrook remains in fourth place on the all-time triple-doubles list with 104, but he is just three shy of passing Hall of Famer Jason Kidd for third place. Hall of Famer Oscar Robertson is the all-time leader in triple-doubles with 181 . In 2016-17, Westbrook entered an April 7 game against the Phoenix Suns averaging 31.8 points, 10.7 rebounds and 10.4 assists. However, he was six assists shy on his overall season total from clinching the triple-double average. He totaled them by early in the third quarter. That made Westbrook the first player since Robertson to average a triple-double. Robertson averaged 30.8 points, 12.5 rebounds and 11.4 assists in 1961-62 , setting a standard many considered unreachable in the modern era. Robertson had a shot at doing what Westbrook seeks Wednesday, but the former Cincinnati Royals star missed out on back-to-back triple-double seasons by just seven rebounds in 1963-64. In addition to averaging a triple-double in 2016-17, Westbrook passed Robertson in the record books in another aspect last season. He logged 42 triple-doubles in \u201916-17 , passing Robertson\u2019s 55-year-old single-season mark with a triple-double against the Denver Nuggets on April 9 . And, in a fitting bit of drama, Westbrook won that game vs. Denver with a 36-foot 3-pointer at the buzzer to cap Oklahoma City\u2019s rally from 13 points down. While the Thunder are assured of a playoff spot in 2018, much of the Western Conference playoff picture remains in flux . There was no word after last night\u2019s win as to how much Westbrook might play in Wednesday\u2019s finale, but the chance for history is there once again for the OKC superstar."},{"id":47503,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nba-playoffs-what-monday-nights-games-mean","date":"2018-04-10","title":"How Monday night's games affected 2018 NBA playoff chase","content":"The playoff picture heading into Monday night was as murky as ever.

That means now it\u2019s down to five teams \u2013 Oklahoma City, San Antonio, New Orleans, Minnesota and Denver \u2013 vying for the final four Western Conference spots. And the only seeds that are locked up remain at the top, No. 1 Houston and No. 2 Golden State. The Jazz haven\u2019t played a Game 1 of any series at home since the West semifinals in 2007, and haven\u2019t played Game 1 of the first round at home since 2001. And after losing Gordon Hayward last summer, plus starting this year 19-28, this postseason berth represents nothing but an amazing job by Jazz coach Quin Snyder. Plenty of clarity in the West race should come on Monday. Oklahoma City, San Antonio and New Orleans can all clinch spots with victories, and Minnesota can also secure its first postseason spot since 2004 with a win and some help. Philadelphia will open the playoffs at home for the first time since 2003, after clinching no worse than the No. 4 seed with its win over Dallas . The 76ers \u2013 now winners of 14 consecutive games \u2013 will finish No. 3 in the East if they close with wins over Atlanta and Milwaukee. Indiana remained in the mix for a top-four seed as well with its win over Charlotte . To reach No. 4, the Pacers will need to win their finale against Charlotte, and need Cleveland to lose both of its remaining games against New York. Otherwise, Indiana will be the No. 5 seed. No. 1 seed Toronto beat Orlando in a game where the Raptors departed with some injury concerns \u2013 Lucas Nogueira strained a hamstring, and Fred Van Vleet left with what the team said was relatively minor back tightness.

The 2018 playoffs are just about here, and Stephen Curry isn\u2019t, and Kyrie Irving won\u2019t be, and Joel Embiid might be, and Jimmy Butler will be \u2014 if his team is, that is. And both conference champions from a year ago are equally unsettled going into the postseason, for different reasons. The Golden State Warriors are banged up, while the Cleveland Cavaliers are brand new. Golden State hasn\u2019t looked like an offensive leviathan, while Cleveland has been one of the league\u2019s worst defenses. And, most importantly, each has legit challengers this year in Houston and Toronto in its respective conferences \u2014 deep, tough, elite defensively, hard to stop offensively, and tempered\/hardened\/driven by recent playoff failures. Which should make late May and early June even more compelling than normal. At the least, we\u2019ll have the Warriors going for three rings in four years, and LeBron James going for an eighth straight Finals appearance \u2014 each representing something special. The postseason, then, should provide some theatre that Meryl Streep will drop what she\u2019s doing to watch. Among the biggest storylines: The Philadelphia 76ers\u2019 scintillating run to end the regular season sets up them for a glorious postseason run, that will finalize a season in which the decisions by former GM Sam Hinkie \u2014 the successful ones, anyway \u2014 are rightly celebrated. (The failures of Jahlil Okafor and Michael Carter-Williams to fire as stars after Hinkie took each high in the first round are not only not ignored by Hinkie\u2019s biggest supporters, they are cited as proof that he had to do what he did for as long as he did, because you\u2019re going to have some misses at the top of the Draft. God, I love Hinkie Stans.) It says here that a healthy Joel Embiid and an exponentially improving Ben Simmons are the one team that can give LeBron\u2019s Cavs true night sweats in the Kyrie-less east playoffs. Embiid is a problem for any team, but especially for the defensively indifferent and ineffective Cavaliers, who have no one remotely capable of keeping \u201cThe Process\u201d from running wild. Since New Year\u2019s Day, only Curry (120.4), Chris Paul (116.1) and Jamal Murray (114.7) have better Offensive Ratings among point guards than Simmons\u2019s 113.9 , per NBA.com\/Stats. Who, from among George Hill (6-foot-3), Jose Calderon (6-foot-1), Jordan Clarkson (6-foot-5) and J.R. Smith (6-foot-5) is Cavs coach Tyronn Lue going to put on the 6-foot-10 Simmons? Yes, Lue could try James on Simmons, who is no threat to shoot from deep or run through a maze of pindowns. But that doesn\u2019t make him any easier to slow down. No matter who Philly plays in the postseason, the Sixers are going to be a problem. It\u2019s taken the Oklahoma City Thunder much longer than any of us thought, but OKC is a win from the postseason (even if the Thunder can\u2019t beat the Heat in Miami tonight, the Cancun-bound Memphis Grizzlies will be in Oklahoma City Wednesday). And that\u2019s when Paul George will determine whether his future is in the 405 or elsewhere . The Thunder\u2019s up-and-down regular season doesn\u2019t provide much clue to how far they could go in the playoffs, thought OKC looked formidable in ending the Rockets\u2019 20-game home win streak Saturday. It was a game that featured Russell Westbrook successfully taking on the challenge of defending James Harden down the stretch. When Oklahoma City plays with pace and gets up and down the floor, it can beat anyone. The Thunder will likely have to take down an elite unit like Houston at some point in the playoffs to convince George to stay. With Irving\u2019s injury, the Washington Wizards\u2019 failure to launch and other maladies to Eastern Conference contenders, the Cavaliers have an increasingly clear path back to The Finals. Doing this is best way to keep LeBron: The Sequel in town for an extended run, but the proof will be in the doing, of course. Cleveland will need Larry Nance, Jr., Rodney Hood and Jordan Clarkson to perform under playoff pressure, which Nance and Clarkson have never had to do and Hood did briefly in the 2017 playoffs with the Utah Jazz The Rockets have been the best team in the league most of this season \u2014 an offensive and defensive juggernaut , the logical extension at both ends of the floor of the standards the Warriors set the last few seasons. James Harden will likely walk away with Kia MVP honors after the season and Chris Paul has been everything Houston hoped he\u2019d be . But Houston must finish the deal with a championship to make its own mark. Everything is set up for Toronto, as well \u2014 the Raptors have the Eastern Conference\u2019s best record and are tied with Houston for the best home record (34-7) in the league. They have home court until The Finals. Their two lynchpins, All-Stars DeMar DeRozan and Kyle Lowry, are healthy. They\u2019ve diversified their offense and learned to love the 3-pointer. They\u2019re back to guarding at an elite level. The East is laid out open for a Toronto run to The Finals. There\u2019s no excuse for the Raps not to. We don\u2019t know for sure that the New Orleans Pelicans will make the playoffs. As of this writing, they haven\u2019t clinched yet, although beating the Warriors in Oakland on Saturday went a long way toward their getting to the postseason. But assuming New Orleans is playing next weekend, its success in the playoffs can only help the franchise as it recovers from the recent death of former owner Tom Benson. \u201cThe Brow\u201d (aka Anthony Davis) may have got us on April Fool\u2019s Day , but the next couple of weeks will be dead serious. What if the Pelicans manage a first-round upset? Don\u2019t say it\u2019s not possible with the way Davis is playing. That would go an awful long way to quieting the \u201cHow the Boston Celtics Will Get Anthony Davis in 2020, Vol. MCMLXXXVII\u201d hot takes. The Celtics as imagined played exactly five minutes together this season. Everything that\u2019s transpired since has been wrapped in gauze and sutured shut. Kyrie Irving\u2019s latest knee procedure has everyone hopping off the Celtics\u2019 postseason bandwagon \u2014 a mistake, unless coach Brad Stevens pulls a hammy before Game 1 in the first round. Stevens has coached up whatever 12 guys are active pretty damn well since he\u2019s come to the NBA, and he\u2019ll still have a lot to work with in the playoffs: Al Horford, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum and Terry Rozier (the Celtics hope they can get Marcus Smart back after the first round). * Blogtable:  Who is Boston\u2019s go-to guy with Irving out? The bigger issue, of course, is Irving\u2019s health going forward \u2014 and into next season, after which he can opt out of the last year of his deal and become an unrestricted free agent in 2019. The current belief in Boston is that Irving\u2019s knee \u2014 the cartilage, ligaments, tendons and bones \u2014 is sound and that he\u2019ll have no long-term issues with it. But Irving and the team thought taking out the tension wire that had helped heal his broken patella after his 2015 surgery would do the trick. It didn\u2019t.  There should be no doubt Boston will be all in on Irving. But after missing these playoffs after going out in Game 1 of the Finals in \u201915 , Irving will again have to show he\u2019s able to handle a season-long campaign and still be able to bring his best to the postseason. We have all worked on the assumption that Leonard isn\u2019t going to play for the Spurs any more this season as he rehabs his quad injury, even though they\u2019ve never quite actually said he\u2019s out for the year \u2014 and he, as per usual, has said next to nothing. The Spurs have ridden LaMarcus Aldridge\u2019s All-NBA-level season to the cusp of the playoffs, but no one has much expectation they\u2019ll be there very long if they make it without their former Finals MVP . \u201cDo I have any expectation I\u2019ll see Kawhi?,\u201d Danny Green said a week ago, repeating my question to him. \u201cAs of right now, my mindset is no. I\u2019m just going to forward without him \u2026 if he does come back, great. Our mindset is this is the group we have today, this is the group we\u2019ll have tomorrow. If somebody does come and join, we\u2019ll have them and it\u2019ll be great. But right now we\u2019re moving forward with the expectation that this is who we have.\u201d But, it\u2019s not like we haven\u2019t seen guys come back suddenly for the playoffs after missing large chunks of a season. A fellow named Michael Jordan played just 18 regular season games in his second season with the Bulls in 1986, recovering from a foot injury and not returning to the lineup until mid-March. True, he did get 15 games under his belt before the playoffs. But that did not prepare anyone for his showing up in Boston Garden in Game 2 of the first round against the Celtics and dropping 63 on the home team . There are, to be sure, issues between Leonard and the Spurs, and maybe they\u2019re insurmountable. But if, somehow, \u201cThe Klaw\u201d wakes up one morning this month and says he\u2019s good to go, and reports for duty \u2026 who doesn\u2019t think San Antonio can\u2019t start assimilating opponents into its collective just like old times? * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

From Zach Garrett: The Wizards look, to me, like the Toronto Raptors did at the end of the 2014-15 season, when Toronto got swept \u2014 ironically \u2014 by Washington in the first round of the playoffs . That team\u2019s defense fell apart the second half of the season and no amount of wishing and hoping and expectations for improvement once the playoffs began changed anything. But despite calls to fire coach Dwane Casey and trade either Kyle Lowry or DeMar DeRozan, Toronto kept its coach and star players, put better role players around them, built up the team\u2019s depth through the Draft and stuck with their guys. It took four years to get Toronto where it is today: at the top of the Eastern Conference. Will the Wizards stay patient or would they look to shake things up if they go out again before the conference finals \u2014 which looks almost certain? I\u2019d vote for patience, with one exception \u2014 if there\u2019s a way to get Kawhi Leonard from San Antonio. I\u2019d trade anyone \u2014 anyone \u2014 on the current roster for him if I knew Leonard was healthy and was willing to sign a long-term deal going forward. Biggggzzzz. From Patrick Cabell: Can only speak for myself: 1. Adams: A beast on the glass, a great individual and team defender \u2014 he does all the dirty work inside while also ranking 10th in the league in contested three-pointers per game (3.9). He throws his body around (second in the league in screen assists, per NBA.com\/Stats, at 4.8 per game) and doesn\u2019t miss much at all (fourth in the league in field goal percentage among players who average 30 or more minutes, .628). 2. Capela:  See everything above, except he leads the league in field goal percentage among 30-plus minutes players at .654, is second in the league both in blocks (1.9) and in contested twos per game (10.2). The lynchpin for how the Rockets dominate defensively while keeping their spacing offensively. 3. Drummond: He\u2019s been the constant in Detroit, about to lead the league in rebounding for the second time in three seasons. Took on more decision making responsibilities at the start of the season with Reggie Jackson hurt, and it worked for a while. But once the Pistons traded Tobias Harris as part of the Blake Griffin deal, Drummond\u2019s assists fell through the floor. Not his fault. 4. Whiteside: Not consistent\/healthy enough this season to be ranked ahead of Adams or Capela, though he\u2019s still averaging a double-double this season and would be top five in blocks (1.7 per game) if he qualified. But part of why he doesn\u2019t qualify is because he\u2019s not seeing the floor down the stretch of games. 5. Nurkic: Nobody loves Big Nurk more than me. But while his improved defense has helped lead Portland\u2019s second-half turnaround at that end of the floor, he still fouls too much. Will be very interested to see who, if anyone, takes a run at the restricted free agent in July. 6. McGee: Does what he does. Can have occasional impact on a game. But nowhere near as good as the five above him you\u2019ve listed here. Scott and I finish . From Scott Young: First. Scott, thank you for your initial letter and your responses. We do not agree on a great deal when it comes to guns. But I will always listen to and respect someone who makes an argument with facts, and does so respectfully. You have done both throughout our correspondence. I appreciate your position and thank you for bringing up a whole lot of cogent and fair points throughout the discussion. Second, I am hearing a \u201cperfect is the enemy of the good\u201d strain in your argument. Again: no one believes that getting rid of one gun, or a lot of guns, or all guns, is going to end all gun violence, or most of it. The question is: are you willing to make changes or make efforts to try and reduce gun violence by getting some of the \u2014 literally \u2014 hundreds of millions of guns off the streets? A 2009 study by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms estimated that year that there were approximately 310 million guns available in the United States: 114 million handguns, 110 million rifles and 86 million shotguns . That was almost a decade ago. And as the number of guns manufactured goes up, never down, one can comfortably assume there are many more millions of weapons in circulation today. You cite the Mother Jones compilation, and we don\u2019t have enough space here to go back and forth on how you or I would define what an \u201cassault weapon\u201d is; it would no doubt be different. But the magazine also noted that, since 2009, unrelenting pressure from the NRA has led to the enactment of almost 100 laws nationwide that have relaxed or eased gun restrictions . If more people can get more guns legally, adding to the \u2014 again, literally \u2014 hundreds of millions of guns that are available for purchase, that may help explain why gun deaths in the United States dwarf those of any other country on earth \u2014 all of which have people who suffer from mental illness, who are fearful of crime, etc. If we are safer (and, of course, that depends on who you are, and where you live), no one has posited convincingly or even unconvincingly that it is because we are awash in all these guns. Accepting your estimate of six to 10 million AR-15s currently in circulation in the United States, if we managed to get them all off the streets and back on the battlefields where they belong, citizens could still hunt, target shoot, protect their homes and do anything else they want with\u2026at least \u2014 at least \u2014 more than 300 million firearms available to them. Is it not worth at least trying? If it reduces one death, if it keeps one wife or husband or cop or child or minister or concertgoer or teacher or diner or churchgoer alive, wouldn\u2019t it be worth it? (An aside: just last week, the Massachusetts Supreme Court held, just as the U.S. Supreme Court \u2014 I think, you would argue, not exactly a bastion of liberal jurisprudence these days \u2014 held last year, that a state\u2019s assault weapons ban does not violate the Second Amendment . This, again, is in keeping with the evidence cited in our discussions before, that there are limits to the reach of the Second Amendment, just as there are limits on the First Amendment.) At any rate, I thank you for your thoughtful responses. I hope we can all be safe and peaceful. Send your questions, comments and .. come on, it\u2019s puppies for 10 minutes to daldridgetnt@gmail.com . If your e-mail is funny, thought-provoking or snarky, we just might publish it! (Last week\u2019s averages in parenthesis) 1) James Harden (29.3 ppg, 6.7 rpg, 8.3 apg, .553 FG, .781 FT): Barring a meteor hitting the earth and\/or dinosaurs returning to roam the land, your 2017-18 NBA Most Valuable Player. 2) LeBron James (34.7 ppg, 10 rpg, 10.3 apg, .587 FG, .656 FT):  Soon, this will be a finals project for every undergrad in every college in every NBA city: make a billboard\/banner for your city to beg for LeBron to come there next year. 3) Anthony Davis (31.7 ppg, 11.7 rpg, 3.3 bpg, .533 FG, .824 FT): Since \u201cBoogie\u201d Cousins was lost for the season Jan. 26 with his Achilles\u2019 injury, Davis\u2019 averages are as follows: 31 games, 30.5 ppg (leads the NBA), 12 rebounds (fifth in NBA), 3.1 blocks (leads the NBA), 2 steals\/game (third in NBA). Monstrous. 4) Kevin Durant (29.8 ppg, 7.3 rpg, 6.3 apg, .459 FG, .912 FT): God, let\u2019s get to the playoffs so we can stop with all the hot takes about how the Warriors can\u2019t win a title without Steph Curry, and what their record is when Durant scores 40 or more. Well, when Durant scores between 35 and 39 points this season, the Warriors are 5-1. Is that any more relevant? 5) Kyrie Irving (DNP: knee surgery): Out for the season. 15 \u2014 Consecutive games in which the Nets have made at least 10 3-pointers, a franchise record. This year\u2019s team has already shattered the franchise record for made threes in a season (877), set last season; after making 24 threes in a win over Chicago Saturday \u2014 one short of the NBA record for threes in a game, 25, set by the Cavs last season \u2014 Brooklyn has made 1,012 threes this season, becoming the first team in franchise history to make more than 1,000 threes in one season. 7 \u2014 Years since the Clippers last missed the playoffs ; L.A. was officially eliminated on Saturday after losing to Denver . This is the first time since the franchise was in San Diego in the 1978-79 season that it will miss the postseason despite having a winning record; the Clippers were 43-39 that season but finished fifth in the Pacific Division, despite the best efforts of Mr. World B. Free, who averaged 28.8 points that season \u2014 the last in the NBA before the league adapted the 3-point shot from the ABA. 40 \u2014 Years, as of Sunday, since the Buffalo Braves played their last game in that city, per the NBA. The Braves moved to San Diego, changing their name to the Clippers, in one of the more bizarre transactions in league history: the teams traded owners. Braves owner John Y. Brown, who bought the team in 1977, liquidated most of the team\u2019s promising core, sending Bob McAdoo, Adrian Dantley and Moses Malone out of town in separate trades. Brown then swapped control of the Braves to Irv Levin, who assumed control of that team while Brown assumed control of Levin\u2019s team \u2014 the Celtics. But Levin was from California and wanted to return there, so once he assumed control in Buffalo he moved quickly to get league approval to move the team to San Diego. The league acquiesced in a 21-1 vote in 1978. 1) If there is a God, succeeding generations, when asked their recollections of Seven Days in May, will speak not of the great book\/film of the same name (film screenplay by Rod Serling!) in the \u201860s about a military coup against the President and government of the United States, but of the Cavaliers-76ers second-round playoff series of 2018. Please, God, give us seven games of Cleveland-Philly next month. 2) The Jazz lost its franchise player eight months ago and got nothing in return. That Utah not only survived, but has thrived behind rookie Donovan Mitchell, and has gotten a Defensive Player of the Year-worthy campaign from Rudy Gobert, is testament to the job both of GM Dennis Lindsey and the front office, and Coach Quin Snyder and his staff \u2014 and the players, who came to work and got through two rough patches while Gobert was injured. Utah\u2019s run to the playoffs, and a potential top-three seed in the west, is a great story, one of the NBA\u2019s best this year. 3) This should be standard operating procedure for every Major League team for the rest of time. And I don\u2019t mean how deftly Sophia Minneart dodged the Gatorade shower. Any reporter who covers baseball regularly and can\u2019t speak Spanish shouldn\u2019t be covering baseball. Two questions, two answers, two quick translations, and we\u2019re done. Perfect. How can you possibly be able to cover a team if you can\u2019t communicate with 31.9 percent of the players on Major League rosters ? 4) Mitch Kupchak will have tough decisions to make in Charlotte brings a lifetime of front office experience to the Hornets as their new President of Basketball Operations and GM. The Bugs have a lot of big contracts without the commensurate big performance from them, and they\u2019ll thus be difficult to move. The one guy who is playing up to his deal, Kemba Walker, will be unrestricted in the summer of 2019, forcing the Hornets\u2019 hand this summer \u2014 can you extend Walker, or do you have to trade him? And Kupchak\u2019s last couple of years in Los Angeles were fruitless ones when it came to convincing free agents to come there. But he\u2019ll obviously have the full backing of fellow Tar Heel Michael Jordan and he\u2019ll bring decades of experience to bear.  1) Tankathon 2018, you will not be missed. 2) Omri Casspi, who\u2019s played 552 NBA games over nine seasons with six teams, was a week from playing in the postseason for the first time in his career when he was waived by Golden State late Saturday . Which was unavoidable; the Warriors needed a playoff roster spot for Quinn Cook, who\u2019s earned it, and Casspi\u2019s been on the shelf with ankle problems. But it doesn\u2019t make it any less hard. 3) Re: LeBron v. Nick Saban and who owns the \u201cintellectual property\u201d of doing a show in a barber shop : when I was at ESPN \u2014 and I haven\u2019t been at ESPN since 2004 \u2014 my colleague Fred Carter did several \u201cbarber shop\u201d segments for the NBA2Night show . Since I\u2019ve been at Turner, Dennis Scott has done several barber shop segments for our various shows. It isn\u2019t exactly a new idea. 4) Beyond sad to see a great newspaper being gutted like this in the name of profits and not journalism. \u2014 Utah\u2019s Derrick Favors ( @dfavors14 ), Friday, 4:54 p.m., joining other existential questions like \u2018if a tree falls in the forest and no one hears it, does it make a sound?\u2019 and \u2018do I look fat in this dress?\u2019 \u201cI felt to have any other goal was borderline, sort of cowardly. I understood that it was going to be a difficult ask. But I think to walk into a locker room and not declare that to be a season goal at the start of the season is not how I\u2019m wired. You would get different people within our organization that sort of advised me not to go there and I wanted to. I wanted to own it.\u201d \u2014 76ers coach Brett Brown , in a terrific piece by Yahoo! Sports\u2019 Michael Lee , on his preseason prediction\/pledge to his team that the Sixers would be going to the playoffs this season. \u201cNobody should get in if he doesn\u2019t get in. They should just say, \u2018you know what, we\u2019re going to close it down. No more coaches get into the Hall of Fame.\u2019 You deserve to be in the Hall of Fame.\u201d \u2014 Washington Wizards coach Scott Brooks , on the failure of former Rockets Coach Rudy Tomjanovich to be elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in this year\u2019s voting . Tomjanovich won two titles coaching the Hakeem Olajuwon-led Rockets in 1994 and 1995 and was a five-time All-Star as a player in 11 NBA seasons, all with the Rockets franchise. \u201cI think just caring, caring in general, that was the main problem. Just in general, it\u2019s hard to win an NBA game if you don\u2019t put forth an effort at all. Yeah, I\u2019m mad. I\u2019m embarrassed. I know that this game doesn\u2019t mean anything in the seeding, but the playoffs start next week. It was an embarrassing effort, a pathetic effort.\u201d \u2014 Steve Kerr , after the Warriors were routed Thursday in Indiana by the Pacers by 20. * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

Dimez, aka DatBoyDimez, aka Artreyo Boyd, was ready for his moment in the sun last week, coming to New York City and Madison Square Garden for a handshake with Adam Silver and all the trimmings a franchise-level player gets when he\u2019s the first overall pick. * Complete NBA 2K League draft results Dimez was taken first overall by Mavs Gaming, the Mark Cuban-owned entry in the NBA\u2019s 2K League, a group of 17 franchises affiliated with actual NBA teams , but whose stars can\u2019t break opponents down off the dribble or fight through screens to stay in front of their man. Well, they can , but they don\u2019t do it on a basketball court; they do it on their couches and in their man caves. But the 2K League is real \u2014 to the NBA, to the owners, to the players and to those who watch those players religiously on YouTube, Twitch and other venues. Tens of millions of people around the world are gamers, and if you have a child or a nephew who sits in front of a console for hours at a time, playing with people around the corner or around the globe, you know what the future is \u2014 it\u2019s leagues like NBA 2K, which hopes to get a share of the eSports market with its signature video game providing the gateway. \u201c From the NBA\u2019s standpoint, this is our fourth league,\u201d Silver said last week at the pre-Draft news conference. \u201cOf course we have the NBA, the WNBA and the [NBA] G League, and now this is the fourth league in our family, and that\u2019s exactly as we\u2019re treating it: one more professional league. And I think what\u2019s so exciting today in particular is that we\u2019ll be welcoming a new generation of athletes, of NBA players, into this fourth league, and I think that \u2014 always that sense of renewal, that sense of the birthing of the whole process is what makes us particularly excited \u2026 it\u2019s a similar process that we go through with the NBA or the WNBA for that matter.\u201d Each of the 17 franchises will have six gamers, one of whom will man each of the traditional basketball positions on the team \u2014 point guard, shooting guard, small forward, power forward and center \u2014 with the sixth player serving as (naturally) the team\u2019s sixth man. The teams will play in custom built gaming houses \u2013 state-of-the-art studios, complete with personal chefs and training tables. The Kings\u2019 2K team will play in a studio that was built inside Golden 1 Center . They won\u2019t be \u201cplaying\u201d with high-tech versions of actual NBA players, as they do when they\u2019re playing the actual NBA 2K video game; they\u2019ll control avatars of themselves. They were the survivors of a year-long process of whittling down hundreds of thousands of gamers who wanted to be considered for the 2K Draft to a 72,000-person \u201ccombine\u201d that the league ran in February . Each of those 72,000 people had to have won at least 50 2K games in January just to qualify for the combine. That group was cut down to 250 finalists who had to pass background checks and be vetted by the league before being made eligible for the 2K Draft. \u201cWhat I would say is the reason we think we have a chance with all demographics is our game, more than any other game in eSports, is globally recognizable,\u201d said Brendan Donahue, the NBA\u2019s Managing Director of the NBA 2K League, last Friday. \u201cWhether you\u2019re in Texas or in Africa, you know the NBA. It\u2019s not intimidating; it\u2019s accessible. And that\u2019s where we think we have a big advantage.\u201d The NBA 2K League regular season starts in May, with 12 weeks of head-to-head matchups on Fridays and Saturdays, followed by three weeks of tournaments. Teams will play 14 regular season games and three tournaments during the year ( including the Tip-Off Tournament that will have a $100,000 prize pool ); the tournaments will serve as tiebreakers for the playoffs. The playoffs will start Aug. 17 and feature the top seven teams, along with the winner of the final tournament. The quarterfinals will be single-elimination, followed by best-of-three series in the semifinals and finals. The league champion will get $300,000 \u2014 half of the playoff pool. The league will serve many different masters and agendas. Yes, the kids who are gamers today could well wind up being even bigger NBA consumers \u2014 season ticket and suite holders, advertisers, and the like \u2014 in the future. But that\u2019s just part of the audience the league and its owners are hoping to attract: \u2022 There are an estimated 1.6 million people, who play NBA 2K every day, at an average of 90 minutes per day; \u2022 There are the 1.4 billion people worldwide who are NBA fans, with whom the league engages daily through its various platforms. The NBA 2K League is indeed hoped to provide a new way to engage with them; \u2022 But there are another 200 million people who are eSports enthusiasts and play regularly. They may be fans of other games and other titles, like the mega-hits \u201cLeague of Legends\u201d, \u201cDota 2\u201d, the \u201cCall of Duty\u201d series and the like. But the NBA thinks it league can engage them as well. (Another 200 million people play occasionally.) These are the folks who sell out NBA arenas like Madison Square Garden and the Staples Center with competitive gaming tournaments, drawing crowds of fiercely loyal and dedicated fans who follow the sports\u2019 stars religiously on social media. https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v \u201cWe do have evidence of crossover,\u201d Donohue said. \u201cWith NBA2K, often times, players who own consoles, an Xbox or PlayStation, if they play NBA2K, often times they cross over and play a game like Call of Duty. We think we can cross over as well.\u201d So do the owners of existing NBA teams who have jumped in with both feet into gaming. \u201cTh ere is a ton of overlap,\u201d Cuban said last week via e-mail. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how many fans know and love the Mavs because they play 2K. They know every player on the roster and want to come to the games to see them play in real life. It\u2019s a great tool for building a fan base among younger demos.\u201d Initially, Cuban balked at buying a team, saying last year that it was a \u201cconfused market\u201d and that too many players burned out too young by playing so much . But, he changed his mind. \u201cThe NBA is taking the lead. That\u2019s the difference,\u201d he said in the e-mail. Other owners have also taken notice. Washington Wizards owner Ted Leonsis, Golden State Warriors co-owner Peter Guber and Los Angeles Lakers president Magic Johnson all invested in Team Liquid , an eSports franchise that competes in games like League of Legends. Team Liquid won the International Dota 2 title last summer, taking the $11 million first place prize. It continued winning this past weekend . Leonsis sees the NBA as a platform, like Facebook \u2014 \u201cthe good Facebook,\u201d he said Monday morning. And he expects 2K teams will become part of that platform, both as a revenue-generator and a content-provider, along with an owners\u2019 NBA, WNBA and G League teams. \u201cIn the short term, it will help us in marketing and help us be more relevant to a younger audience,\u201d Leonsis said. \u201cIt will also help us globally. The Twitches and YouTubes are unwired, and available to people around the world.\u201d Leonsis crossed the virtual Rubicon and became an eSports acolyte when he saw his son Zach, now the Senior Vice President of Strategic Initiatives and General Manager at Monumental Sports Network, growing up with a new paradigm \u2014 learning eSports through watching other gamers on YouTube, and continuing to play into adulthood. \u201cFor me, it obviously watching my son, who was a good athlete, and a good student,\u201d Leonsis said. \u201cAnd he loved playing video games. He kept playing video games after he was captain of his golf team, and he still plays video games \u2014 and he doesn\u2019t play golf anymore. He\u2019s gotten married, and he still plays video games.\u201d Leonsis points out that while gambling on sporting events is still not legal in most of the United States, it\u2019s a fait accompli around the world . The anticipation is that eSports will make inroads domestically with bettors both in Las Vegas and other places where gambling is legal, and into other more casual venues, just as fantasy sports has exploded and driven fan interest. ESPN already has its own subsite dedicated to eSports. Turner Sports (which runs NBA.com) has invested heavily in eSports through ventures like ELeague , broadcast on TBS, with its concurrent social, digital and mobile components.  \u201ceSports will be a boon for traditional media,\u201d Leonsis said. \u201cThe two drivers of revenue and fan affinity will be digital sports and digital gaming and gambling. Outside of the U.S., digital gambling is accepted. You go do digital gambling like you would go to a Starbucks \u2026 if you look at things like Draft Kings, if you put a virtual team together, you watch all of the games. You\u2019re really interested. When casual fans bet on games, like the NCAA Tournament or the Super Bowl, the viewership stays really high.\u201d And the advent of virtual reality will only enhance and strengthen the bonds between gamers, fans, bettors and consumers of eSports. \u201c It\u2019s important that our owners are so savvy that they\u2019re attacking the eSports landscape so broadly,\u201d Donohue said. \u201cWhen League of Legends awarded 10 franchises, and seven of them were awarded to NBA owners, it speaks to how savvy they are and how bullish they are about eSports in general.\u201d Cuban says he hasn\u2019t yet figured out how to weigh the short term versus the long term regarding Mavs Gaming. \u201cIt\u2019s a learning experience,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will get better as we go forward.\u201d Said Leonsis: \u201cWe see great asset appreciation quickly, in a two to three year period. To put it in perspective, when Peter Guber and I bought Team Liquid, it was valued higher than when I bought the Washington Capitals in 1999. At that time, the Caps were 30 years old, and the NHL was 70 years old. These were established brands.\u201d Most sports leagues, Leonsis noted, start with local teams that they hope will be able to then be successful nationally, in leagues. And then, after many years, if those leagues remain solvent and expand, they can have global reach. By contrast, \u201ceSports start global, and work their way to national, and then local,\u201d he said. \u201cThe best players are global right from the get-go. The best players are young. There\u2019s no one-and-dones. There\u2019s no \u2018experience makes you better.\u2019 We don\u2019t know (how long eSports gaming careers will last), because we don\u2019t have enough data yet, but we know the best players are in their 20s \u2026 and, there\u2019s diversity right out of the gate. The first pick for our team was an African-American. It\u2019s not \u2018we\u2019ll develop into it.\u2019 It starts young and global.\u201d One thing that Silver volunteered as a problem at the outset of the league is that all 102 people drafted for the initial season of the NBA 2K League are men. The \u201cGamergate\u201d controversy of just a couple of years ago \u2014 a systematic pattern of online abuse, threats and harassment against female gamers, programmers and other members of the community \u2014 has brought the issue of misogyny in the gaming community front and center . In the case of the 2k Draft, Silver said, the selection process was \u201cblind;\u201d the league was processing the players\u2019 avatars and didn\u2019t know the gender of the potential draftees. Nonetheless, he was disappointed there were no women gamers in the inaugural season. \u201cWhat I\u2019m concerned about, and this is a much larger issue in the gaming community that Strauss (Zelnick, the chair and CEO of TakeTwo Interactive, the creator of the NBA 2K video game) and Brendan and I have talked a lot about, is that something is going on in the gaming community that either is not attracting women or is repelling women from wanting to be part of it,\u201d Silver said. \u201cAnd given what the NBA\u2019s track record has been, especially in the areas of diversity and inclusion, along with the launch of this league, we are making a concerted effort, led by Oris Stuart, who is the head of diversity and inclusion at the NBA, to create a task force designed so that next year when we\u2019re sitting here for the draft, we will have a pool of women who are participating, as well.\u201d The NBA will rawcast all league competition and is talking with Twitch, the streaming video platform owned by Amazon that shows video game live streaming. Impressions and time spent watching will certainly be a major method of determining whether the NBA 2K League is taking off, but there is a bigger picture. In a world where the demand for content has never been greater or more incessant, the 102 people in this new league are going to become even more famous. \u201cCertainly we will help amplify our teams through the game competition,\u201d Donohue said, \u201cbut in addition, we think where the teams are going to have a huge advantage is growing a large grass roots audience as well. We think there\u2019s a huge opportunity, and we\u2019ve seen it in eSports, growing content around the practice house, where they\u2019re living, how they came to be great players. The NBA\u2019s ability to story tell and make them stars globally, we put that formula to this league and we think that\u2019s a dangerous combination.\u201d That must be why Silver, in introducing Donohue at the press conference last week, referred to him tongue in cheek as \u201cthe guy whose job is on the line\u201d to deliver eyeballs and clicks to the new venture. \u201cNo pressure, right?,\u201d Donohue chuckled over the phone Friday. There is, of course. But on the other hand, the audience has revealed itself already. Anyone who has a child or a relative knows the befuddlement of old people \u2014 like me \u2014 watching kids watching other kids play video games on their computers. It\u2019s how they learn now. And that makes sense. The NBA is better those consumers will be ready to watch some more, and that others may watch its newest employees\u2019 stories. \u201cOne of our players was driving a truck, and this is his chance at a new career,\u201d Donohue said. \u201cWe had a college player get injured, and this is his way to stay in the game \u2026 I think people embrace a kid who gets drafted and goes up there and says \u2018my mom was going to kick me out of the house if I didn\u2019t get a job.\u2019 \u201d And with some of the biggest companies in the world all seeing a future with eSports and gaming front and center in their portfolios, guys like Dimez will continue to become mainstream sports celebrities, more accessible in some ways than Stephen Curry. After all, you can watch all the video of Curry behind the arc that you want, but very few people can then walk out on the court and approximate anything close to the production he achieves nightly. \u201cEveryone in media says, when they talk about eSports, \u2018it\u2019s coming,\u2019 \u201d Leonsis said. \u201cBut when you\u2019re in it, and you see the crowds \u2026 write less tonally about \u2018it\u2019s coming.\u2019 In many quarters, it\u2019s already arrived.\u201d * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

At this point last year, we already knew all four of the first-round playoff matchups in the Western Conference.

No matter who finishes 5-8 in the West or how things shake out in the East, there will be some dangerous teams in the lower seeds, and an upset or two may be in the cards. Of course, that wouldn\u2019t be anything new. In each of the last 11 years (from 2007-2017), at least one team with home-court advantage has lost a first round series. Of the 21 first-round \u201cupsets\u201d over that span, 13 came in 4-5 series, but eight did not. When this season started, it was hard to imagine a scenario where the Cleveland Cavaliers and Golden State Warriors weren\u2019t meeting in The Finals for a fourth straight year. Now, it\u2019s much easier. The Warriors are without their most important player, while the Cavs never seem to be fully healthy and very good defensively.

Temple, Vince Carter and former Sacramento Kings star Doug Christie were at South Sacramento Christian Church late last month , at a forum quickly put together to try and give the community a chance to vent, to pray, to witness, and to reach out to the NBA players in attendance. The community needed to let the players know the pain that was roiling the city in the wake of the police shooting death of an unarmed 22-year-old man, Stephon Clark , in his grandmother\u2019s back yard March 18. \u201cWe did a few word association games,\u201d Temple said Saturday night. \u201cOne of them was \u2018safe places,\u2019 and people started saying things to us: \u2018mom\u2019s house,\u2019 \u2018church.\u2019 I yelled out \u2018basketball gym.\u2019 People were yelling out certain musicians, like you go somewhere to listen to certain musicians to feel better. One kid, he had to be 12, and he wrote a rap. He wrote it on the spot. He wrote \u2018the safest place for a black boy is in the grave.\u2019 And when he said that, me, Doug and Vince was like, man, that\u2019s crazy. He just wrote this in the last 10 minutes. That was what was on his mind.\u201d That\u2019s what much of Sacramento is going through after Clark\u2019s death.  Police said Clark matched the description of a suspect who\u2019d been breaking into cars in the neighborhood, and that he ran into his grandmother\u2019s yard after being asked to stop while in another person\u2019s yard nearby. They then claimed that Clark approached them with an object in his hand, and they fired to protect themselves. But the object in his hand was a cell phone, and no weapon was found on him or nearby. An autopsy of Clark commissioned by his family, though, revealed he\u2019d been shot eight times by police, mostly in his back indicating, at best, that there\u2019s some serious question about the police\u2019s initial version of what happened. The community\u2019s anger at Clark\u2019s death spilled into the streets, with a coalition of civic leaders and community organizers staging impromptu protests through the city \u2014 including, twice, just outside Golden 1 Center, where the Kings play. Against the Atlanta Hawks on March 22 and again against the Dallas Mavericks on March 27 , protestors formed human chains around the entrances at the Golden 1 Center, keeping fans who hadn\u2019t yet gotten into the building from being able to get their seats . But the Kings, instead of hiding inside their new, beautiful building, have taken steps toward the community. It started that first night, when owner Vivek Ranadive made impromptu postgame remarks that offered condolences to Clark\u2019s family and pledged that the team would take an active role in trying to bring the city back together. The Kings formally pledged to work with two groups \u2014 the Build. Black. Coalition and the Sacramento chapter of Black Lives Matter \u2014 to find ways the team could invest in the African-American community.  Three days after the Hawks\u2019 game, the Kings hosted the Boston Celtics. Both teams wore black shooting shirts that had been quickly processed, with \u201cAccountability: We Are One\u201d on the front and \u201c#StephonClark\u201d on the back. More impressively, the Kings and Celtics, with Boston taking the initiative, quickly came together in consultation with the NBA to script, shoot and edit a public service announcement the day before they played one another. The 30-second PSA aired in the Golden 1 Center the next day. That\u2019s part of what drove Temple, Carter and Christie \u2014 who played for the Kings during the Chris Webber-Vlade Divac era and who now does the team\u2019s pre- and post-game shows \u2014 to the \u201cKings and Queens Rise\u201d forum March 30 , 12 days after the shooting. (Former Kings player Matt Barnes, who grew up in Sacramento, also organized a rally for Clark\u2019s family and offered to pay Clark\u2019s funeral expenses .) Temple had already been engaged with kids in the city before the Clark killing; he\u2019d adopted Sacramento Charter High School as a mentor to the black and Latino students there . Christie came aboard after Clark was killed. \u201cWhen the first protests came about and they surrounded Golden 1 Center I was just sitting there and I was kind of dumbfounded,\u201d Christie said Saturday. \u201cWhenever you have civic in your mind you\u2019re thinking \u2018what can I do?\u2019 So I called someone I knew was involved in it, and he said \u2018hold on a second,\u2019 and lo and behold, he was able to get hold of Barry (Accius, a prominent local community activist who was leading the protests) outside. From that text we were able to bring Barry in. Then when I got in the building I talked to the head of security of the Kings and I said I might be able to get the head of the protests; would you meet with him? \u201cSo Barry came in and Damien (Barling, a local radio host), Vince, Garrett, we all met with him. We talked for 45 minutes and we talked about doing something like that. Barry said \u2018if I set something up, will you all be able to attend?\u2019 And we all said absolutely.\u201d No one doubts the team\u2019s sincerity. Well before the shooting, former Kings center DeMarcus Cousins, with the help of the team\u2019s Director of Security, Hakeem Sylver, led a town hall discussion in 2016 that brought community members and police from both Sacramento and nearby Rosewood together . Temple started a relationship out of those town halls with Sacramento\u2019s police chief, Daniel Hahn, the city\u2019s first African-American police chief. The team hands out annual scholarships for local youth who do well both athletically and academically. And Ranadive hasn\u2019t been shy since buying the team in 2013 for $534 million , keeping it from being sold to a group that was planning to move it to Seattle. Ranadive worked with former NBA Commissioner David Stern to get a public-private agreement to build the Golden 1 Center in downtown Sacramento . He was one of the first owners to publicly condemn former LA Clippers owner Donald Sterling for racially charged remarks that ultimately led to the NBA stripping the franchise from Sterling and starting the process that led to Steve Ballmer buying it . Ranadive supported the league when it pulled the 2017 All-Star Game from Charlotte because of the North Carolina General Assembly\u2019s passage of the so-called \u201cBathroom Bill,\u201d which prohibited transgender people in the state from using public restrooms that they felt conformed to their gender identity. But this is unchartered territory. And while the organization is committed now, the Kings\u2019 season ends Wednesday. Players will leave town. The chance that the momentum created in the last couple of weeks could begin to dissipate as the Clark case works its way through the judicial system is large. The Kings have a big platform and a big (figurative) microphone, and the outreach matters. But they\u2019re a basketball team, not a lobbying group, investigative force or legislative body. Can they have a real place at the table of possible solutions in the community? They\u2019ve pledged partnerships with Build. Black., a coalition of local grassroots groups including the Sierra Health Foundation, the Greater Sacramento Urban League and NAACP and local activists including Accius, Ryan McClinton of SacACT and Kellie Todd-Griffin of Sistallect , along with Sacramento BLM. The Kings will have to vet potential next steps with those groups and other experts, and have conversations with the community. They\u2019re not in the business of telling people in the community what they need. They don\u2019t make policy. They will have to listen as much as they speak, because those groups have skin in the game \u2014 and, yes, that pun was intended. \u201cThey have a role and a responsibility to be responsive to tragedies like Stephon Clark,\u201d said Chet Hewitt, the president and CEO of Sierra Health, by phone Monday morning. \u201cBut even in a more proactive way, to be a part of the economic renaissance that you see taking place in so many inner-city neighborhoods. You know that part of the emerging NBA business model is downtown stadiums. And as you move back into the urban core, there\u2019s often displacement that takes place, or an infusion of economic opportunity that has positive and negative consequences. \u201cThe positive side is clearly the new building and new investment in those communities that has been lacking for a long time. The downside is increased property values and rental rates that sometimes exclude the people who have been living there. And so the question is, if you\u2019re a thoughtful business owner \u2026 what is your responsibility to the people who have actually been there? How do you create opportunity for them to participate in the economic renaissance that\u2019s already been there that you\u2019ve been a part of, if not a driver of, and do so in a way that\u2019s not only good for your business, but is also representative of your desire to be a good corporate citizen in that particular environment?\u201d The Kings did, after all, get almost $273 million in public investment toward construction of the $558 million Golden 1 Center, Hewitt noted. Hewitt, Accius and other Build.Black members met with Ranadive and with Mavericks owner Mark Cuban before the Kings-Mavericks game March 27, in what Hewitt called a \u201cthoughtful\u201c meeting. \u201cYou can ensure that you have some black vendors in your arena,\u201d Hewitt said. \u201c\u2026You can make sure that\u2019s an opportunity for folks. And you can, as these entities do development in the areas immediately adjacent to these new arenas, they can also make sure that some of the build out of those hotels and new businesses also are made available to African-American vendors, but also other vendors of color as well. You can do that through project labor agreements if you\u2019re doing construction; you can do that through a bidding process if you\u2019re rehabbing buildings to make them new and shiny and presentable again. There are a number of ways you can do that.\u201d Hewitt has also asked the Kings to invest in redoing basketball courts, as they\u2019ve done throughout the city, in the South Sacramento neighborhood where Clark\u2019s grandmother lived. \u201cI see kids with Kings hats,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t see any Kings courts.\u201d He said Ranadive and the Kings were \u201cincredibly receptive\u201d to Build.Black. and its initiatives, and agreed to a three-year process to look at and perhaps implement some of its recommendations. \u201cWe\u2019re not looking for handouts,\u201d Hewitt said. \u201cWe\u2019re not saying put businesses that aren\u2019t up to the standards that you may hold for your business enterprise. What we\u2019re saying is that there are people who are poised and who are ready to both invest their energy and their time and motivation, and who just really want access to opportunity.\u201d And while everyone is coming to this in good faith, Hewitt and the coalition would like to see tangible results, whether after the season ends or soon down the road. \u201cWhat we have now is a commitment, and we\u2019re working off of a basis of trust,\u201d he said. \u201cSeasons do start again. And the conditions that gave rise to the focus on the Kings won\u2019t go away immediately. The community is expecting them to be addressed \u2026 teams often own arenas. And arenas do more than basketball. You can shut down concerts. You can shut down the monster trucks. If the business model is to draw attention to, and people to, those downtown spaces, and the social amenities that everyone enjoys, you don\u2019t want to risk the ability of people to want to be in those spaces after you make deep investments.\u201d In the interim, the onus is on the Kings and the players to help keep driving the agenda once the players scatter to their offseason plans and back to their families. \u201cVivek and the Kings org have done a great job of that and the players have done a good job of continuing the conversation,\u201d Temple said. \u201cAt the end of the day all we can do is put that out there and the people themselves have to push the lobbyists and their legislators to make those changes. When I went to Matt\u2019s rally it was a very diverse crowd, and that\u2019s a great sign.\u201d Temple said he remains in contact with Accius and hopes to keep the momentum going through him. \u201cI\u2019m going to have some conversations when I get to my hometown in Baton Rouge,\u201d Temple said (his father, Collis Temple, was the first African-American basketball player at LSU). \u201cAs we know, this isn\u2019t just a Sacramento issue; this is an American issue. I\u2019m going to continue to keep the conversation going wherever I am in this country. I\u2019m going to stay in Sacramento a little longer than I would in a normal situation because I adopted the high school. The biggest way to keep the momentum going is to make sure we continue to have our conversations no matter where we are.\u201d Christie grew up in Seattle, in the era of the Officer Friendly program. That program brought police officers into the schools at an early age to try and forge better relationships with students and the community in what was standard operating procedure. Police officers there, and then, handed out trading cards to kids of then-Seattle SuperSonics players like Gus Williams , Dennis Johnson and Jack Sikma . Kids would have to walk up to the cops and ask for the cards. Seeds of a relationship were formed and police were in the communities they served. Many still try. But too many encounters are ending like the one with Clark. And the local basketball team, still a point of civic pride in a city that has its own identity separate from the business in the state capital that gleams in downtown, is trying to do more than just dribble and sell tickets. \u201cIt\u2019s odd that the community saved the Kings,\u201d Christie said, \u201cand now it\u2019s coming full circle for the Kings to try and help save the community.\u201d * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

Kerr was in a backtracking mode of sorts on Sunday, acknowledging that he \u201cchose my words poorly\u201d and explained why he was harsh about a club that\u2019s still missing Stephen Curry and has the No. 2 seed in the West wrapped up.

Kupchak, who brings more than 30 years of NBA front office experience to Charlotte, including 17 seasons as an NBA General Manager, will be responsible for leading the organization\u2019s day-to-day basketball operations. \u201cIn every role and in every stop during his tenure in the NBA, Mitch Kupchak has brought the highest levels of success to his teams. He\u2019s a proven winner,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cHaving won championships as both a player and an executive, we have confidence that Mitch is the right person to lead our basketball operations, build a winning culture and bring sustained success to our organization, for our fans and for the city of Charlotte.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m excited to join the Hornets organization and I want to thank Michael for this opportunity,\u201d said Kupchak. \u201cI am well aware of the passion for basketball in Charlotte and throughout the entire state of North Carolina\u200e, and I am confident that we can build the Hornets into a successful team that our great fans can be proud of.\u201d Kupchak joins the Hornets after a very distinguished and successful career as a front office executive and player with the Los Angeles Lakers. He began working in the team\u2019s front office in 1986 under two NBA Hall-of-Famers: legendary NBA executive Jerry West and Bill Sharman, the first person to win a championship as a player, coach and executive. Kupchak was named general manager in 2000, serving in that capacity for 17 seasons. During Kupchak\u2019s tenure as general manager, the Lakers won four NBA Championships and six Western Conference Championships, posting a 747-607 (.552) regular-season record and winning 63 percent (111-66) of their postseason contests. As a player and executive, Kupchak has been a part of 10 NBA Championship teams \u2013 three as a player (one in Washington and two in Los Angeles), and seven as a Lakers executive. While serving as general manager of the Lakers, Kupchak was responsible for the day-to-day management of the team, including personnel decisions, contract negotiations, salary cap strategy and scouting collegiate and international players. The 13th overall pick in the first round of the 1976 NBA Draft, Kupchak played nine NBA seasons in Washington and Los Angeles before a knee injury forced him to retire. He averaged 10.2 points and 5.4 rebounds per game in 510 regular-season contests. Kupchak earned NBA All-Rookie Team honors during the 1976-77 season and averaged a career-high 15.9 points (.512 field goal percentage) and 6.9 rebounds per game during Washington\u2019s championship season in 1977-78. He was traded to Los Angeles in 1981, where he played a key role off the bench in the Lakers 1985 NBA Championship. Kupchak returns to the state where he was an All-American standout collegiately at the University of North Carolina. He became the first freshman to play at the university after the freshman eligibility rules changed prior to the 1972-73 season. Kupchak was named 1975-76 ACC Player of the Year as a senior and is one of 49 UNC standouts to have his jersey (No. 21) honored and raised to the rafters of the Dean Smith Center in Chapel Hill (November 1994)."},{"id":47137,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/washington-wizards-markieff-morris-fined-official-release","date":"2018-04-08","title":"Washington Wizards forward Markieff Morris fined $15,000 for inappropriate comments","content":"NEW YORK \u2014 Washington Wizards forward Markieff Morris has been fined $15,000 for directing inappropriate comments toward a game official, it was announced today by Kiki VanDeWeghe, Executive Vice President, Basketball Operations.

Its end felt much more final on Saturday with the Clippers\u2019 134-115 loss to Denver. The defeat meant LA would miss the playoffs for the first time since that core united in Los Angeles in 2011. It also marks the first time coach Doc Rivers will fail to make the postseason since 2007, when he manned a 24-win Boston Celtics team. After five years of regular season success and postseason shortcomings, the Clippers shipped Paul to Houston last summer and re-engineered the team around Griffin. The results were middling, and LA quickly pivoted toward a more complete overhaul by trading the injury-prone forward to Detroit. Center DeAndre Jordan remains as the only All-Star from the most successful era in franchise history. The future is murky for the less decorated team of Los Angeles. Jordan holds a 2018-19 player option for more than $24 million. It is up to the 29-year-old big man to decide if he wants to take that one-year guarantee or enter unrestricted free agency this summer, when only a handful of teams would have the cap space to pursue him. Point guards Milos Teodosic and Austin Rivers, as well as journeyman Wesley Johnson, also hold player options for next season. Danilo Gallinari, the Clippers\u2019 most notable trade acquisition last offseason, played in just 21 games this season due to injury. He is under contract through the 2019-20 campaign. Tobias Harris, Patrick Beverley, Sam Dekker and Boban Marjanovic all have one more year remaining on their respective deals. The brightest spot of the Clippers\u2019 season was sixth man Lou Williams. The 31-year-old guard enjoyed a career year, averaging 22.5 points per contest despite starting just 19 games, prompting LA to extend his contract through 2020-21."},{"id":41015,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/boston-celtics-kyrie-irving-has-successful-surgery-official-release","date":"2018-04-07","title":"Boston Celtics' Kyrie Irving has successful surgery to remove screws in left patella","content":"The Boston Celtics announced that guard Kyrie Irving underwent successful surgery today to remove two screws in his left patella. \u201cThe surgery went exactly as planned, and we expect Kyrie to be fully healthy for training camp in the fall,\u201d said Celtics President of Basketball Operations Danny Ainge."},{"id":41016,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/even-without-kyrie-irving-boston-celtics-brad-stevens-believes-roster-playoffs","date":"2018-04-07","title":"With Kyrie Irving out, Boston Celtics' Brad Stevens believes in his roster for the playoffs","content":" It \u2019 s been a trying last few days for the Celtics.

And now they \u2019 re watching as teams in the East line up to get the chance to play them, suspecting that the Celtics are weakened without Irving. With Boston locked into the No. 2 spot in the East , suddenly the Nos. 3 and 7 positions look very promising. Seemingly, a good chunk of the fan bases of teams in contention for those spots are feeling good about their team \u2019 s chances. But will it be that easy against Boston? The Celtics have played better than expected without Irving (and for that matter, without Gordon Hayward) and that \u2019 s a credit to their aggressive and disciplined play. A rotation that leans toward youth is giving balanced scoring and solid defense and embracing the philosophy of coach Brad Stevens.

The King went wire-to-wire, proving to all that he has no plans on slowing down, and that age truly is just a number. As we close the books on this season with a big three-week slate of games, the big question for 2018-19 will be whether we\u2019ll see OSPR\u2019s first back-to-back champ. It\u2019ll also be interesting to see whether the two other past champs find their way back onto the list next season. Here\u2019s a quick look at all the OSPR champions: Pau Gasol ( 2015-16 ), Dwyane Wade ( 2016-17 ), LeBron James (2017-18). 1. LeBron James (33), Cleveland Cavaliers Previous rank: 1 Last weeks\u2019 stats: 11 games, 30.4 ppg, 9.5 rpg, 10.4 apg Season stats: 27.5 ppg, 8.7 rpg, 9.2 apg No matter the stat we throw at you, they all make you scratch your head. In addition to setting career highs in both rebounds (8.7) and assists (9.2), James has a career-best 50 double-doubles and 17 triple-doubles (more than his previous two seasons combined). 2. LaMarcus Aldridge (32), San Antonio Spurs Previous rank: 2 Last weeks\u2019 stats: 10 games, 30.2 ppg, 9.4 rpg, 2.2 apg Season stats: 23.3 ppg, 8.4 rpg, 2.1 apg Aldridge, who in his last 12 games has gone for 30 or more five times and 20 or more 11 times, has a chance to break his career best scoring mark of 23.4 set in 2014-15. Right now, he\u2019s at 23.3, so he\u2019d need to finish the season with a couple more 30-point games. 3. Dwight Howard (32), Charlotte Hornets Previous rank: 3 Last weeks\u2019 stats: 8 games, 19.6 ppg, 15.0 rpg, 1.1 apg Season stats: 16.8 ppg, 12.4 rpg, 1.3 apg Howard holds his position to finish the season on the strength of a historic performance in which he went for 32 points and 30 rebounds on March 21. Also of note: At 57.2, Howard is on pace to record his highest free-throw percentage since 2010-11 (59.6). 4. Chris Paul (32), Houston Rockets Previous rank: 4 Last weeks\u2019 stats: 6 games, 18.2 ppg, 5.8 rpg, 6.8 apg Season stats: 18.6 ppg, 5.5 rpg, 7.9 apg With the Rockets looking toward the playoffs, they\u2019ve been resting Paul more. That might help explain the poor shooting over the last six games (42.4 FG%). But Thursday\u2019s game should generate optimism, as he went 11-for-19 for 27 points, his highest scoring output since Jan. 26. 5. J.J. Redick (33), Philadelphia 76ers Previous rank: 6 Last weeks\u2019 stats: 10 games, 17.0 ppg, 2.4 rpg, 2.4 apg Season stats: 16.8 ppg, 2.5 rpg, 3.0 apg Powered by six consecutive games of 19 or more points, Redick is going to set a career high in scoring. His previous best was 16.4 in 2014-15. He\u2019ll also shoot better than 90 percent from the free-throw line (90.6) for the sixth time in his career. 6. Marc Gasol (32), Memphis Grizzlies Previous rank: 5 Last weeks\u2019 stats: 8 games, 12.5 ppg, 4.9 rpg, 3.9 apg Season stats: 17.2 ppg, 8.1 rpg, 4.1 apg It certainly looks like Gasol is going through the motions in what has been a trying season. He has just one double-double in his last eight and four games of less than 10 points (including a dreaded zero) in the last seven. And his 41.9 FG% will easily be a career worst. 7. Paul Millsap (32), Denver Nuggets Previous rank: NA Last weeks\u2019 stats: 10 games, 17.4 ppg, 7.3 rpg, 2.8 apg Season stats: 15.0 ppg, 6.5 rpg, 2.8 apg With the exception of a two-point effort on March 23, it was a productive three-week stint for Millsap, who in the last 10 games went over 20 points four times including a 36-point performance. If he hadn\u2019t missed three months with a wrist injury, Millsap may have finished in the top five. 8. Anthony Tolliver (32), Detroit Pistons Previous rank: NA Last weeks\u2019 stats: 10 games, 14.0 ppg, 3.8 rpg, 1.2 apg Season stats: 8.5 ppg, 3.0 rpg, 1.1 apg Tolliver has been getting serious run lately, notching more than 30 minutes per game in four straight. But his home\/away splits need work. In five home pages, he averaged 19.8 points, 61.0 FG%, 56.7 3PT% and 92.3 FT%. In five road games, he averaged 9.4 points, 41.9 FG%, 42.3 3PT% and 71.4 FT%. 9. Carmelo Anthony (33), Oklahoma City Thunder Previous rank: 8 Last weeks\u2019 stats: 9 games, 12.1 ppg, 5.7 rpg, 1.6 apg Season stats: 16.2 ppg, 5.9 rpg, 1.3 apg The nightmarish regular season is almost over for Anthony, who has just one 20-point game (shot 9-for-21 in that game) in the last nine and is set to finish with career lows in scoring (16.2), FG% (40.3), FT% (76.1) and assists (1.3). 10. Gerald Green (32), Houston Rockets Previous rank: NA Last weeks\u2019 stats: 10 games, 11.9 ppg, 3.5 rpg, 1.3 apg Season stats: 11.5 ppg, 3.2 rpg, 0.7 apg Green saw his string of six consecutive double-digit scoring games end with Thursday\u2019s six-point showing. But that wasn\u2019t the longest such string for Green, who also managed a seven-game run and a nine-game streak of double-digit scoring games.

Los Angeles. Akron. Portland. And now, the Big Apple. New York is the latest city in a trend of recent ones to get a billboard aimed at getting LeBron James\u2019 attention. The sign recently went up and is located near one of the main entrances to Madison Square Garden and has a goal of getting James\u2019 attention when it comes to making his summer decision in free agency. Stefan Bondy of the New York Daily News has more : Similar types of billboards have been launched by other fans, first by a remodeling company in Philadelphia (which put the billboards installed in Cleveland) and also by an attorney in Los Angeles (who had them put up in L.A.) . Additionally, an Akron realtor posted two billboards there, which is also LeBron\u2019s hometown, trying to woo him to stay with the Cavs . Roughly five minutes from the Portland Trail Blazers\u2019 arena, the Moda Center, there now stands a new billboard meant to entice LeBron James to head West this summer . James can become a free agent this summer and many fan bases around the NBA are hoping their team takes a shot at signing him. The Oregonian reported in March that Trillblazin co-founders Ira Lafontaine and Keith Kunis were open the possibility of putting up transit ads in Portland or, perhaps, a sign in Cleveland near Quicken Loans Arena . Personal injury attorney Jacob Emrani put up four billboards around Los Angeles to try and woo James, who can enter free agency this summer . ESPN.com reported the Philadelphia billboards were leased by Power Home Remodeling, a company based in Chester, Pennsylvania. The company\u2019s CEO says the goal is to bring James, a three-time NBA champion, to Philadelphia because \u201cwe think the best athletes should want to play here.\u201d When the billboards in Philadelphia were erected, James couldn\u2019t help but be flattered by them. \u201cYou can say it\u2019s a distraction, it\u2019s not. Not a distraction,\u201d James told reporters on Feb. 27 . \u201cIt is actually very flattering that I\u2019m sitting here at 33 and in my 15th year and teams or guys \u2014 I don\u2019t want to say teams because that becomes tampering \u2014 but people in their respective city want me to play for them. That\u2019s cool I think. That\u2019s dope.\u201d The 33-year-old James can opt out of his contract this summer with the Cavaliers. He\u2019s said in the past that he would like to end his career with Cleveland, but because he hasn\u2019t given the team a long-term commitment, there is constant speculation that he may leave his home state a second time. James famously announced he was taking his \u201ctalents to South Beach\u201d and signed with the Miami Heat in 2010. He won two NBA titles in four years with the Heat before returning to Cleveland in 2014 Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":47591,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/usa-basketball-announces-35-players-2018-20-mens-national-team","date":"2018-04-06","title":"LeBron James, Kevin Durant, James Harden among 35 players on 2018-20 men's national team","content":" COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. \u2014 Featuring 35 players, including 17 Olympic gold medalists and 30 past members of the USA Men\u2019s National Team pool, USA Basketball Men\u2019s National Team managing director Jerry Colangelo today announced the 2018-20 USA Men\u2019s National Team roster of players who are expected to attend the July 25-27 USA Men\u2019s National Team minicamp in Las Vegas.
