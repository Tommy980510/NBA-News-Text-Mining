He was 74. Unseld\u2019s family announced his death via a statement released by the Washington Wizards, the franchise he played for throughout his entire 13-season career. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver issued a statement regarding Unseld\u2019s death, which read in part : \u201c Wes Unseld was one of the most consequential players of his era. An NBA MVP and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer, Wes elevated the game by mastering the fundamentals. https:\/\/www.twitter.com\/NBAPR\/status\/1267865811185799169 \u201cHis competitive drive and selfless approach made him a beloved teammate, a respected opponent and a cornerstone of the Washington Wizards franchise, with whom he won an NBA championship. Wes also set the model of class, integrity and professionalism for the entire NBA family during stints as a player, coach and team executive with Washington and through his dedication to expanding educational opportunities for children.\u201d   In a statement released by the Wizards (who were known as the Baltimore\/Washington Bullets during Unseld\u2019s playing days), the Unseld family said : \u201cIt is with profound sadness that we share that our adored husband, father and grandfather Wes Unseld passed away peacefully this morning surrounded by family \u2026 \u201cHe was the rock of our family \u2014 an extremely devoted patriarch who reveled in being with his wife, children, friends and teammates. He was our hero and loved playing and working around the game of basketball for the cities of Baltimore and Washington D.C., cities he proudly wore on his chest for so many years.\u201d A five-time All-Star and, along with Wilt Chamberlain, one of only two players to win NBA Rookie of the Year and MVP honors in the same season, Unseld instantly made the team then known as the Baltimore Bullets into a winning franchise after it selected him No. 2 overall in the 1968 draft. A decade later, he was the MVP of the NBA Finals as the Washington Bullets beat the Seattle SuperSonics in a seven-game series best known for coach Dick Motta\u2019s proclamation: \u201cThe opera ain\u2019t over until the fat lady sings.\u201d Listed at 6-foot-7 and 245 pounds, Unseld overcame taller players and bad knees with a strong work ethic and lots of grunt work in the paint. He was a tenacious rebounder and strong passer. Unseld was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1988, his first year of eligibility. \u201cI never played pretty,\u201d Unseld said on the day he was elected. \u201cI wasn\u2019t flashy. My contributions were in the things most people don\u2019t notice. They weren\u2019t in high scoring or dunking or behind-the-back passes.\u201d As a player, Unseld seemed to have been chiseled from a block of granite,  with a stoic demeanor and an iron resolve to win. A 6-foot-7 bull of a center, he forged his reputation on relentless rebounding, bone-jarring picks, and laser-beam outlet passes. He did all the unspectacular things that led to glamorous victories. He was the league\u2019s MVP and Rookie of the Year in 1968-69 and a five-time NBA All-Star who captained the Baltimore and Washington Bullets to four NBA Finals appearances in the 1970s and to a championship in 1978. Unseld was intelligent on and off the court, and over the course of his career he came to personify the virtues of hard work, dedication, and courage. After retiring in 1981 he moved into a front office position with the Bullets, then coached the team for seven seasons in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Perhaps the most important figure in the history of the Bullets franchise, Unseld was elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1988. In 1996, he was named to the NBA 50th Anniversary All-Time Team. Wesley Sissel Unseld was born March 14, 1946, in Louisville, Kentucky, where he won two state championship at Seneca High School and then stayed home for college, attending the University of Louisville. He averaged 20.6 points and 18.9 rebounds over his four years with the Cardinals, earning him the prime draft spot right behind No. 1 selection \u2014 and future Bullets teammate \u2014 Elvin Hayes. Unseld made an immediate impact on the 1968-69 Bullets, boosting them to a 57-25 record and first place in the Eastern Division \u2014 a 21-game improvement over the club\u2019s sixth-place finish the previous year. He played in the NBA All-Star Game as a rookie and tallied 11 points and 8 rebounds in 14 minutes of action. He finished the season averaging 13.8 points and 18.2 rebounds (his 1,491 total rebounds were second only to Wilt Chamberlain\u2019s 1,712) and was named both Rookie of the Year and Most Valuable Player. Chamberlain is the only other player in NBA history to have won both awards in the same season, accomplishing that feat in 1959-60. In 1970-71, the Bullets made their first trip to the NBA Finals, narrowly surviving seven-game playoff battles against the Philadelphia 76ers and New York Knicks. Matched up against the Milwaukee Bucks and stars such as Abdul-Jabbar and Oscar Robertson, Baltimore fell in four games. After a sub-.500 campaign in 1971-72, the Bullets picked up superstar forward Hayes from the Houston Rockets for the following season. The high-scoring Hayes would provide a good counterpoint to Unseld over the next several years. During the early and mid-1970s, Hayes and Phil Chenier provided most of the Bullets\u2019 scoring punch, leaving Unseld to do the blue-collar work underneath. In 1974-75, the Baltimore Bullets were renamed the Washington Bullets and Unseld led the NBA with an average of 14.8 rpg. They reached the 1975 Finals but were swept in the series by the surprising Golden State Warriors led by Rick Barry. After back-to-back 48-34 seasons, Unseld\u2019s greatest triumph came in 1977-78, when he led the Bullets to their only NBA championship. It was a true team effort. No Bullets player ranked in the NBA\u2019s top 20 in scoring, but the club had six double-figure scorers, led by Hayes (19.7 ppg) and Bob Dandridge (19.3). For the season, Unseld scored 7.6 ppg (ninth on the team) and yanked down 11.9 rpg (10th in the NBA). During his 13-year NBA career, all with the Bullets, Unseld piled up many accomplishments. He ranked seventh on the league\u2019s all-time rebounding list and was one of a handful of players to have tallied at least 10,000 points and 10,000 rebounds for a career. He played 984 games for the Bullets, the most of any player in franchise history. His total of 13,769 boards (14.0 rpg) currently tops the franchise career list, and his 3,822 assists also is a Bullets record. In 1981, on the heels of his retirement, Unseld was given an executive position in the Bullets organization. In 1988, he was elected to the Basketball Hall of Fame. After a few years in the front office as vice president, Unseld became the team\u2019s head coach. He went 202-345 in coaching the team from 1987-88 to 1993-94, making the playoffs one time (in 1988). At the end of the 1993-94 season, he stepped down from his role, but remained an important figure to the Bullets\/Wizards franchise for the rest of his life. He also had a seven-year stint as general manager from 1996-03, when the team made one other trip to the playoffs. Funeral arrangements were pending.

(AP) \u2014 Longtime Sacramento Kings TV broadcaster Grant Napear resigned Tuesday after he tweeted \u201cALL LIVES MATTER\u201d when asked by DeMarcus Cousins for his opinion on the Black Lives Matter movement. The 60-year-old Napear also was fired by KTHK Sports 1140 in Sacramento. He had co-hosted a show on the AM radio station with former Kings player Doug Christie. Bonneville International, the station\u2019s parent company, said Napear\u2019s \u201crecent comments about the Black Lives Matter movement do not reflect the views or values of Bonneville International Corporation. The timing of Grant\u2019s tweet was particularly insensitive.\u201d There have been demonstrations across the country since George Floyd, a black man, died May 25 after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into Floyd\u2019s neck while Floyd was handcuffed and saying that he couldn\u2019t breathe. Cousins was drafted by Sacramento and played for the Kings for six-plus seasons before he was traded to New Orleans in February 2017. Cousins, who has been criticized by Napear in the past, tweeted at the broadcaster on Sunday night: \u201cwhat\u2019s your take on BLM?\u201d Napear responded: \u201cHey!!!! How are you? Thought you forgot about me. Haven\u2019t heard from you in years. ALL LIVES MATTER\u2026EVERY SINGLE ONE!!!\u201d Cousins posted that Napear\u2019s response was expected. Former Kings forward Matt Barnes then called Napear a closet racist. In response to criticism from another Twitter user, Napear said he apologized if his comment came across as \u201cdumb.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve been doing more listening than talking the past few days,\u201d Napear posted. \u201cI believe the past few days will change this country for the better!\u201d * * *"},{"id":27556,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/judge-rules-zion-williamson-must-answer-eligibility-questions","date":"2020-06-02","title":"Judge denies Zion Williamson's request to block improper-benefits inquiry","content":" A Florida judge has denied NBA rookie Zion Williamson\u2019s attempt to block his former marketing agent\u2019s effort to have the ex-Duke star answer questions about whether he received improper benefits before playing for the Blue Devils. Prime Sports Marketing and company president Gina Ford filed a lawsuit last summer in a Miami Dade County, accusing Williamson and the agency now representing him of breach of contract. That came after Williamson had filed his own lawsuit a week earlier in North Carolina to terminate a five-year contract with Prime Sports after moving to Creative Artists Agency LLC. Ford\u2019s attorneys had submitted questions in filings last month that included whether the New Orleans Pelicans rookie or anyone on his behalf sought or accepted \u201cmoney, benefits, favors or things of value\u201d to sign with Duke. They sought answers within 30 days to establish facts under oath in the pretrial discovery process, while Williamson\u2019s attorneys had argued the questions were \u201cnothing more than a fishing expedition\u201d and sought a stay to stop it. Larry A. Strauss, an attorney on the legal team representing Ford and Prime Sports, said in an email Tuesday to The Associated Press that circuit judge David C. Miller denied the stay request, meaning the discovery process is set to continue. Attorneys for last year\u2019s No. 1 overall NBA draft pick had argued the questions were designed to \u201charass,\u201d damage Williamson\u2019s reputation and attract media coverage to \u201cimproperly gain settlement leverage\u201d in a recent court filing. They had sought the stay while appealing the December denial of their motion to dismiss the Florida case based on lack of jurisdiction, or a protective order as an alternative. Jeremy Watkins, a spokesman for Williamson attorney Jeffrey Klein, did not immediately return a call Tuesday from the AP. The questions in filings by Ford\u2019s attorneys offered no evidence of wrongdoing by Williamson or his family. They referenced Williamson\u2019s mother and step-father as well as apparel companies Nike \u2014 which outfits the Blue Devils team \u2014 and Adidas. The filings also inquire about any improper benefits received from an agent between January 2014 and his April 2019 announcement that he would go pro, as well as asking about a house where his mother and stepfather resided while he played at Duke. Duke spokesman Michael Schoenfeld declined to comment Tuesday since the school isn\u2019t a party to either lawsuit. He again referred to a January statement that the school had reviewed Williamson\u2019s eligibility previously and found no concerns."},{"id":27599,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/stevens-empathy-means-more-basketball-right-now","date":"2020-06-02","title":"Celtics coach Brad Stevens: Empathy means more than basketball right now","content":" BOSTON (AP) \u2014 Celtics coach Brad Stevens believes the best way he can be helpful to his players right now is by listening to them. Boston players including Jaylen Brown, Marcus Smart, Enes Kanter and Vincent Poirier have been among several NBA players to participate in recent protests following the death of George Floyd, a black man who died in Minneapolis last month after a white police officer pressed his knee into Floyd\u2019s neck as he begged for air. Demonstrations have taken place in cities around the country in response to the incident, which was captured in a widely seen video that has mobilized protesters. A medical examiner ruled Monday that Floyd\u2019s heart stopped as police restrained him and compressed his neck. It all prompted Stevens to write a letter to his players over the weekend in which he expressed his support for them. \u201cI think the thing that I wanted them to know is that every decent person is hurting,\u201d Stevens said in a conference call with reporters Tuesday. \u201cEvery decent person feels the pain of the African American community. But I also don\u2019t want to pretend like I know the exact, distinct pain. So what I wanted them to know is that I\u2019m with them.\u201d The Celtics were among several professional sports teams to issue statements in the aftermath of Floyd\u2019s death, saying in part that it and other similar incidents \u201chave left the entire Celtics organization struggling with grief and anger.\u201d The resulting national dialogue has reminded Stevens of the discussions he had with players prior to the 2016-17 season during the height of Colin Kaepernick\u2019s protests when he took a knee during the national anthem prior to NFL games to protest police brutality. Stevens said those protests prompted players to share their own experiences with racial profiling and discrimination. Brown, who grew up outside of Atlanta, drove 15 hours from Boston to lead a march in Atlanta on Sunday. It\u2019s the kind of action Steven has come to expect from the 23-year-old. \u201cI\u2019m not surprised with him taking a leadership role,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cThat\u2019s who he is.\u201d Floyd\u2019s death and the resulting demonstrations come at a time during which NBA leadership is trying to formulate a plan to possibly resume the season amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Stevens said the proposals are promising, but that most talk about basketball has taken a backseat in recent days. Several Celtics players did begin to take part in voluntary, individual workouts at the team\u2019s practice facility Monday. The team is also having regular meetings via video conferencing. But Stevens said they have mostly been focusing on the mental well-being of athletes since the start of the pandemic and that\u2019s continued during the demonstrations. * * *"},{"id":27626,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/hall-fame-mulls-date-class-2020-induction","date":"2020-06-02","title":"Naismith Hall of Fame mulls date for Class of 2020 induction","content":" The Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame was gearing up for a great year: not just the induction of NBA superstars like Kobe Bryant, Kevin Garnett and Tim Duncan, but also a chance to unveil a completely renovated museum. Because of the coronavirus outbreak, the reopening has been pushed back two months to July 1 and the induction ceremony \u2014 which will posthumously honor Bryant along with longtime college coach Eddie Sutton \u2014 is being postponed, either to October or the spring. A commemorative coin that was supposed to be released at the Final Four will instead go on sale on Thursday. \u201cAll of these things are going to happen. It\u2019s just a matter of the timing\u2019s going to be delayed,\u201d Hall president and CEO John Doleva said Tuesday in an interview with The Associated Press . \u201cWe will have the most remarkable class ever, when that happens. We didn\u2019t plan it this way and it\u2019s not the way we would have chosen to do it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019re fortunate that our plans were able to remain in place, even though the timing has changed.\u201d The Hall\u2019s Class of 2020 includes Bryant, Garnett, Duncan and WNBA star Tamika Catchings \u2014 all elected in their first year of eligibility. Also to be honored by the Springfield, Massachusetts, shrine are Sutton, who died last month, and fellow coaches Rudy Tomjanovich, Kim Mulkey and Barbara Stevens, along with former FIBA Secretary General Patrick Baumann. Doleva confirmed that induction weekend will not be held on Aug. 28-30, as originally planned; the Hall is hoping to announce a new date by mid-June. Complicating the potential possibility of a spring 2021 induction: The Hall doesn\u2019t know what the NBA and college basketball seasons will look like then. \u201cFinding a date in that period of time that\u2019s going to work in the new basketball schedule is a bit of a trick,\u201d Doleva said. \u201cIt is correct that the August date is done. The October date is still in play and the spring is the backup for that.\u201d At least one thing will be different for this year\u2019s ceremony: The Hall will \u201cbreak protocol a little bit\u201d and allow family members to speak on behalf of honorees who are being inducted posthumously. Previously, they were presented only on video. Doleva said the exception will be made not just for Bryant, who died in a helicopter crash on Jan. 26, but also for Sutton and Baumann, who died in 2018. \u201cThat recognizes the fairness aspect of it,\u201d Doleva said, adding that it has not been decided if the change is only for 2020 or more permanent. Although Bryant, a five-time NBA champion who is No. 4 on the NBA\u2019s all-time scoring list, was already the biggest star in this year\u2019s class, his death at the age of 41 guaranteed that his induction would dominate this year\u2019s ceremony. Doleva said the Hall decided against inducting Bryant alone and gave no thought to having a separate ceremony for him. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be all about Kobe,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve found is that these classes bond together. \u2026 And I\u2019m hoping that that\u2019s what this class will do with Kobe and his family and Eddie Sutton and his family and those that are still living, they will have that bond. \u201cIt may be a little heavily weighted towards Kobe, frankly, and that\u2019s for obvious reasons. But it will be a memorable ceremony and we\u2019re going to celebrate everybody equally in terms of their accomplishments. They\u2019re all Hall of Famers, and all Hall of Famers are equal in the eyes of the museum.\u201d Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":27607,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/national-basketball-coaches-association-statement-george-floyd","date":"2020-06-01","title":"National Basketball Coaches Association issues statement on death of George Floyd","content":" Our heartfelt condolences and prayers go out to the family of George Floyd.

My heart goes out to the family of George Floyd and to the countless others whose lives have been brutally and senselessly taken through acts of racism and injustice.\u201d"},{"id":27628,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/phoenix-suns-monty-williams-open-letter","date":"2020-05-31","title":"An open letter from Suns coach Monty Williams","content":" I\u2019m angry. I\u2019m afraid. And I\u2019m in pain. When I read those words, I feel like I\u2019m channeling one of my kids. These are the words of a teenager lost and looking for direction in a messed-up world, not the sentiment of an NBA head coach and former player. We\u2019re supposed to have all of the answers. We\u2019re supposed to be seen as grace under pressure. We\u2019re supposed to lead by example. Still, I am angry, afraid and in pain. I don\u2019t have all the answers, but I know the solutions start with love, listening, compassion, service and defending those who can\u2019t defend themselves. And I have definitely lost my cool over the years in the face of abject racism \u2014 dating back to my earliest memories growing up in Colonial Virginia \u2014 and likely more in the days to come. I woke up this morning to our country on fire, AGAIN, and decided the least I can do as so many of us are gripped by anger, fear and pain is to lead by example. Allow my voice \u2014 filled with as much conviction as uncertainty \u2014 to be heard so that others, whether they have a platform or not, will lift their voices as well. I pray for those we have lost but more personally for those who have lost \u2014 the families of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, George Floyd and so many before you. I know how it feels to get that call that someone you love isn\u2019t coming home. The pit in your stomach. The unequivocal feeling of helplessness. Dropping to your knees and imploring God \u201cwhy?\u201d I feel your pain and can truly sympathize and empathize. I wish no one would ever have to receive that call again. To my brothers and sisters from around the sports world, and in full transparency, help me. I\u2019m looking for direction. I may not be the most profound or prolific \u2014 I know there are others with their own platforms out there telling yourself the same things \u2013 but we have an opportunity and I daresay, an obligation. How can we help each other find that direction? I best sum it up in 1 John 3:17\u2026 \u201cBut whoever has the world\u2019s goods, and sees his brother in need and closes his heart against him, how does the love of God abide in him?\u201d We have earned positions of wealth and standing in society. We certainly cannot stand idly by. I\u2019m distraught as I look at my boys \u2014 two are African American and one is Caucasian \u2014 because too many people see them differently. None of them should have to think about how law enforcement will treat them if pulled over for rolling through a stop sign. None of them should be followed through a department store by security. None of them should feel the sweat rolling down their back when a cop follows them for blocks. Alas, their worlds are different, and something is wrong with that. Don\u2019t misread me. I have as much respect for most law enforcement as I do disdain for some of the would-be protesters. To those who have sworn to protect and serve ALL people regardless of color, religion or sexual orientation, I say thank you. We have an institutional problem with pervasive racism. It must end now. To those who are using the fa\u00e7ade of a protest or march by choosing to destroy and tear down, I challenge you to be better. As I tell my players, I\u2019m not calling you out, I\u2019m calling you up. Destruction of property and life is NOT the answer. It IS time to raze the institutional foundations of racism and segregation within politics, law enforcement and society at large. It must happen NOW. Borrowing from C.S. Lewis, \u201cyou can\u2019t go back and change the beginning, but you can start where you are and change the ending.\u201d We must be the change now."},{"id":27601,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/thabo-sefolosha-george-floyd-old-wounds","date":"2020-05-31","title":"George Floyd\u2019s death opens old wounds for Thabo Sefolosha","content":" Thabo Sefolosha knows what it\u2019s like to be a black man, on the ground, being beaten by police officers. Such was the scenario when George Floyd died in Minneapolis last week. And five years ago, Sefolosha found himself in a similarly frightening place. \u201cI was just horrified by what I saw,\u201d Sefolosha said. \u201cThat could have been me.\u201d Time has not healed all wounds for Sefolosha, the NBA veteran who said he was attacked by a group of New York Police Department officers in April 2015 while they were arresting him outside a nightclub in the city\u2019s Chelsea neighborhood. The leg that was broken in the fracas is fine now. The emotional pain roared back last week when he saw video of Floyd, a handcuffed black man who pleaded for air in the final moments of his life as a white police officer \u2014 subsequently charged with murder \u2014 pressed a knee on his neck. Sefolosha has seen the video. He hasn\u2019t watched much news since. His experience with police in New York has left him with a deep distrust of law enforcement, the pangs of angst flooding back even when he walks into NBA arenas and sees uniformed officers. And the latest example of police brutality left him even more upset. \u201cPeople talk about a few rotten apples,\u201d Sefolosha said in an interview with The Associated Press . \u201cBut you know, in my experience and from what we\u2019re seeing, I think it\u2019s deeper than that as a culture that\u2019s deeply rooted in it, to be honest. That\u2019s just my honest opinion. I think it\u2019s really \u2026 part of a culture where it\u2019s deeper than just a few bad apples.\u201d The four officers who were involved in the incident where Floyd died were fired; the one who knelt on Floyd\u2019s neck, Derek Chauvin, has been charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Massive protests have broken out in several cities in recent days, the country torn again over a black man dying at the hands of police. Sefolosha \u2014 a black man of Swiss descent who plays for the Houston Rockets \u2014 considered but decided against joining protests in Atlanta, where he is waiting for the resumption of the NBA season that was shut down in March because of the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cI\u2019m mad, for sure,\u201d Sefolosha said. \u201cThat\u2019s for sure. I mean, it\u2019s 2020. Nobody should have to go through this in this time, especially after black people have given up so much for America. Black people have given up so much and done so much for this country. It\u2019s hurtful to see it this way.\u201d Sefolosha\u2019s perspective changed forever on April 8, 2015. Chris Copeland, an NBA player at the time, was among three people stabbed outside the club where Sefolosha was that night; police arrived and ordered everyone to leave the area. Sefolosha says he complied but began getting harassed by officers anyway. Before long, he was on the ground. Sefolosha\u2019s leg was broken and some ligaments were torn in the fracas, and he was arrested on several charges that a jury needed about 45 minutes to determine were unfounded. He wound up suing for $50 million, alleging his civil rights were violated, settled for $4 million and gave much of that money to a public defenders\u2019 organization working in marginalized communities. \u201cIt changed me a lot, toward the way I see law enforcement in this country,\u201d Sefolosha said. \u201cAnd also toward the way I see the whole justice system. I went to court and I had to do all of this to prove my innocence. It really got me deep into the system and I\u2019m really skeptical of the whole system.\u201d NBA players have used their platforms often in recent years to protest racial inequality. Sterling Brown of the Milwaukee Bucks filed a federal civil rights lawsuit after police used a stun gun on him and arrested him over a parking incident in 2018. On Saturday, Malcolm Brogdon of the Indiana Pacers and Jaylen Brown of the Boston Celtics were among those taking part in Atlanta protests. \u201cYou see what happened in Minnesota where three human beings with a badge are watching another human being killing somebody,\u201d said Sefolosha, who has played in the NBA since 2006 and intends to return to Switzerland when he retires. \u201cAnd instead of saying, \u2018OK, this is my duty as a human being,\u2019 the duty was more toward not interfering with the other officer and saying, \u2018We are clan, we stick together no matter what.\u2019 It should be the other way around.\u201d The NBA is closing in on finalizing a plan to resume the season in late July at the Disney complex near Orlando, Florida. Sefolosha and the Rockets figure to be contenders for a championship when play resumes. For obvious reasons, Sefolosha\u2019s mind isn\u2019t there yet. \u201cI\u2019ll be happy to be with my teammates and reunited with basketball in general,\u201d Sefolosha said. \u201cBut you know, we\u2019re human beings, and the fight has been going on for too long and the same protests have been going on for too long. I think it\u2019s definitely time for change and that should be a priority for all of us.\u201d"},{"id":27600,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/boston-celtics-jaylen-brown-leads-peaceful-protest-atlanta","date":"2020-05-31","title":"Jaylen Brown drives 15 hours to lead peaceful protest in Atlanta","content":" Boston Celtics guard Jaylen Brown organized a peaceful protest march through Atlanta on Saturday.

Brown marched with a sign that read \u201cI Can\u2019t Breathe,\u201d a reference to George Floyd, who died while handcuffed in Minneapolis on Monday after Derek Chauvin, a white police officer, kneeled on his neck for several minutes. Chauvin was arrested Friday and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter.

This isn\u2019t something where we come and [\u2026] we don\u2019t have to burn down our homes. We built this city. This is the most proudly black city in the world. In the world, man.

The people, speaking on condition of anonymity to The Associated Press because no details of the call were publicly released, said Commissioner Adam Silver is still collecting information on multiple options ranging from 16 to 30 teams returning to action when the season begins again at the ESPN Wide World of Sports complex near Orlando, Florida. One person said the idea of bringing back 20 teams \u2014 possibly a few more, but not all 30 \u2014 continues to resonate as the most likely scenario, as of now. Another plan discussed Friday, the person said, would bring any team within six games of a playoff spot back for the resumption of the season, a scenario where based on the current standings 13 teams from the Western Conference and nine from the Eastern Conference would return. Silver, who has been closely working with the National Basketball Players Association, has not revealed when or how a formal decision will ultimately be made. ESPN reported that the league is planning a Thursday vote to ratify whatever proposal Silver recommends. Given the league\u2019s known hope to be back on the court by the end of July, Silver\u2019s decision would likely have to come very soon. Not all team practice facilities have reopened for voluntary workouts, meaning there could be some players who haven\u2019t done any on-court work since the league suspended the season on March 11 in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Jared Dudley of the Los Angeles Lakers wrote on Twitter that Silver has said the season could go into early October before finishing, and added that a later start to next season gives \u201cmore time to (potentially) have some sort of fans\u201d back in the stands. The New York Knicks and Washington Wizards opened their facilities Friday for the first time since the shutdown started, and the Boston Celtics said they will do the same on Monday. The only teams left at this point without a known reopening plan for their practice facilities are Detroit, San Antonio and Golden State. Teams that are open can have a maximum of four players in a facility simultaneously at this point, with none of them allowed to work out together or even play 1-on-1. The belief has been that the league will ramp up what\u2019s allowed within the voluntary workouts before setting a date for a training camp that would precede the resumption of the season. Countless questions remain unanswered after the Board of Governors call, including the playoff format, if additional regular season games \u2014 roughly 21% of the league\u2019s schedule remained when the season was stopped \u2014 would be played and if so, how that schedule would work. Details of what the league\u2019s testing plan would be are also somewhat unclear, though it\u2019s almost certain that any program would involve all players and staff being checked very regularly and possibly even daily once the season resumes. Another very big issue is money. The NBA has the right, per the Collective Bargaining Agreement, to exercise a clause and recoup roughly 1.08% of each player\u2019s salary for every regular-season game that is canceled for unforeseen circumstances such as a pandemic. The NBPA has not responded to requests for comment on how the financial implications of lost games would affect players. But If some teams are not brought back when the season resumes and more regular season games are played, then it would seem possible for some players could lose a much larger percentage of their salary than others would. * * *"},{"id":27633,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nba-together-general-martin-dempsey-qa","date":"2020-05-29","title":"Q&A: Retired Gen. Martin Dempsey on leadership, living a \u2018felt life\u2019","content":" Gen. Martin E. Dempsey concluded his 41 years of military service in 2015, spending the final four years as the 18th Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, where he served as the top military adviser to President Barack Obama. He now teaches leadership and public policy as a Rubenstein Fellow at Duke University and serves as Chairman of USA Basketball. In his new book \u201cNo Time For Spectators: The Lessons That Mattered Most From West Point To The West Wing,\u201d Dempsey calls upon his decades of experience from battlefields in the Middle East to the Situation Room at the White House to examine the relationship between leaders and followers. Dempsey spoke with NBA.com\u2019s Brian Martin to discuss the key themes of the book, how they apply to these challenging times of the coronavirus pandemic, as well as his work with NBA teams and USA Basketball. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. Brian Martin:  When it came time to write a book and tackle the concept of leadership, how did you approach it differently than the many books about leadership that are out there? Gen. Dempsey:  I had actually written a book right after I retired from the military in 2015. One of the many things the military offers is a unique leader development opportunity; it\u2019s one of those professions where you either keep getting promoted and keep accepting positions of greater responsibility or you leave. So I felt I had experiences to share on the topic of leadership. The title of that first book was Radical Inclusion , which I coauthored with Ori Brafman out of Berkeley. We talked about how important inclusiveness was becoming in a world that had, because of technology and social media, become a lot faster, a lot more complex, and created an environment which put leaders under a lot more scrutiny. When I finished that book, I felt like I had neglected the other half of the equation. What I mean by that is the best organizations \u2014 whether they are sports franchises, military organizations, corporate America, or academia \u2014 are organizations where there\u2019s common expectations shared among leaders and followers. In the first book, I didn\u2019t talk much, if at all, about how to learn to be a trusted adviser or a credible, reliable follower. Yet, that\u2019s important because if you work on only one end of the equation that end may pull its weight, but the other end will not. Furthermore, even in the brief period of time between when I published the first book in 2018 and now, I felt like things were beginning to change again and too many people were just content to watch things happen without taking an active interest in them. They were content to \u201csit in the stands\u201d and and criticize without contributing. It seemed to me that we were at risk of becoming paralyzed by so much information and so much divisiveness. So, I decided that I would write a book that addresses the responsibilities of both leaders and followers and try to get everybody in the game. As Gregg Popovich puts it, I would try to convince everyone how important it is in complex times to get \u201ceverybody in the huddle.\u201d Since everyone will be a follower and a leader at different times during their lives, how important is it to understand that duality and the fact that one side has to understand the other in order for the relationship to really work? It\u2019s not just important; it\u2019s critical . When I went back and tried to catalog my different responsibilities and roles over the 41 years in the military, I was a follower and a trusted adviser (those terms are somewhat interchangeable) most of the time and only a senior leader a fraction of the time. Understanding the attributes and qualities that you would want to see in someone senior to you always makes you more likely to be that kind of leader when the opportunity presents itself. Between your experience in the military and your experience with the Joint Chiefs of Staff, how did you find the right balance of having a strong leader\/follower relationship and also be the most productive? As the senior military officer in the armed forces, I had a responsibility to lead the armed forces. But actually the most important part of my job was to be a trusted adviser to the President of the United States on matters of national security. Those can be competing responsibilities, but the idea was to make them complementary. In other words, whatever I did, I had to make sure that I could accomplish both of those responsibilities. And that\u2019s what started me thinking about the attributes that go into a healthy, positive and productive relationship with leaders and followers. And that\u2019s how I came up with the nine chapters of the book. To be clear though, this is not a book built around a checklist. I didn\u2019t want somebody to think you could pull this book off the shelf, look at a checklist, copy it and understand it. I wanted to make sure that I could illuminate these attributes through real life stories and provide readers with an opportunity to compare it to their own experiences. Is there a real-life story you can share with us that illustrates this dynamic? As Chairman, there is the matter of negotiating the defense budget every year on a very predictable timeline. The defense budget is prepared by the service chiefs \u2014 Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines \u2014 based on what they believe they need, and can justify, to do the things that they\u2019re asked to do for national security both today and in the future. T hen the budget goes across to the President of the United States. And the President, of course, as the Commander in Chief, has a sacred responsibility for national security. But he\u2019s got a lot of other things to accomplish for the country as well. He\u2019s got other domestic issues, whether it\u2019s health care or education or transportation, or infrastructure. So, there\u2019s always going to be some friction when that budget process starts and evolves because the chiefs are unlikely in any year to get exactly what they want. And the President in any year is unlikely to get everything he or \u2014 hopefully someday \u2014 she wants. So, where the Chairman comes in is to try to make sure both sides of that equation understand each other. And that they trust each other. If I was able to develop trust among the Joint Chiefs, and if I was able to develop trust from the President of the United States, then I could be effective in finding solutions to this friction and making it creative friction, not destructive friction. And fortunately it mostly played out like that actually.  I love that term creative friction. It reminds me of several phrases used as chapter titles that included some great use of alliteration: limits of loyalty, sensible skepticism, responsibly rebellious, sweat the small stuff. Can you talk about these core tenets of the leader\/follower relationship that you discuss in the book? L et\u2019s take the issue of loyalty , which as it happens is much discussed currently. I thought it was a good time to share what I think loyalty really means. It\u2019s got to be earned. It\u2019s a two-way street. It has limits.  It was important to point out in that chapter that disagreement before a decision is made is not disloyalty and should never be considered disloyalty. Because if a leader were to do that, if a leader were to state or imply that if you disagree with me you\u2019re being disloyal, then effective communications will shut down. It\u2019ll just shut down. And in the absence of those communications, suspicions and fear will take over the organization. If, on the other hand, the leader makes it clear that he or she wants to have discussion, wants to be challenged, wants to know what everyone else around the table is thinking until they make a decision then that\u2019s what they\u2019ll get. And followers need to acknowledge that once a leader makes a decision, unless it\u2019s an illegal decision, you follow it. I mean, that\u2019s just the way it ought to work. I wanted to use examples in that chapter where I had these issues a few times in my career, up to and including in the Oval Office, where loyalty was kind of hanging in the balance. And fortunately, I\u2019ve had the kind of relationships throughout my career where I could make it clear that not only am I not being disloyal by disagreeing, I\u2019m actually trying to help you be the leader you want to be. Sensible skepticism came to mind because we live in an age of ubiquitous information, often contradictory, and always with intense scrutiny. I mean, you just can\u2019t escape things, which is a big factor making this current pandemic so overwhelming. You can\u2019t escape it. I mean, if you have an iPhone, it\u2019s going to populate with news feeds and stories and conspiracies and tweets and Facebook posts. And then you get tired of that and you go turn on your television, and there it is. So in the absence of clarity and in an absence of trust, people simply go to their respective corners, where they\u2019re either completely dismissive of the pandemic or they\u2019re completely consumed by the pandemic. And there\u2019s very little room for a candid discussion, a fact-based conversation about it because everybody\u2019s so polarized. Well, we\u2019d be better off if sensible skepticism were a habit, where you just don\u2019t blatantly accept everything you hear, you apply your own reason to it, you apply your own knowledge to it, you seek knowledge, you apply your own experiences to it. Then you apply that little voice in your head that I call a character, which is also helpful. And with that little bit of sensible skepticism, we become more open minded. And when you become more open minded, the organization benefits. When you look at how organizations actually innovate, it\u2019s normally when somebody pushes on the edges of what\u2019s considered the norm. I describe it as a little responsible rebelliousness.  I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard the phrase \u201cthinking outside the box.\u201d Well, the box got to be the box because it works. But when you need to innovate, you\u2019ve got to push on the edges a bit. And provided you\u2019re doing it not for your own self-aggrandizement or not for nefarious reasons, but rather to innovate for the good of the of the entire organization and within the confines of the intent that\u2019s trying to be delivered, then rebelliousness can actually be responsible. Look, you\u2019re won\u2019t see responsible rebelliousness on a Powerpoint slide describing an organization\u2019s values, but it should be part of the culture. But it only works if the leader reinforces it and creates a positive climate with and for those who are following. That\u2019s what makes things work. You talk about the three main principles of decision-making being constantly gaining knowledge, learning from your experiences and using your character as a moral compass. I imagine that has to be at the forefront both during your time as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs as well as your time leading in combat. Can you tell me how you came to that philosophy and how you utilized that throughout your career? It was first ingrained in me through my education at West Point and then reinforced throughout my career. The Army has a phrase to describe what we need in a soldier. We want them to \u201cBe, Know and Do.\u201d We say that what the country needs of you is for you to be men and women of character, to know your job, and to do it successfully. And I turned that idea into something that might be a little clearer to civilian audiences, which is always working the three \u201cbuckets\u201d you carry with you throughout life for knowledge, experience, and character. The first of the three buckets is knowledge \u2014 you\u2019ve got to keep filling that bucket as you go, and not just with things that are in your comfort zone or in your particular expertise. I talk with college and high school graduates all the time and one of the things I always try to impress on them is they can\u2019t afford to think that their education is now complete. It\u2019s really just starting, and it should never end. The second bucket is experience . For the most part, you seek out experience, and it\u2019s given to you in the jobs for which you\u2019re accepted. One thing I tell [the graduates] is don\u2019t wish away any job or any position, hoping to get to the next one, because you\u2019ll be missing out on gaining the experience you need to keep going and keep growing. The last bucket is character because the last line of defense in making a good decision is character. For the really hard decisions in life, after you\u2019ve accumulated all the information you can, you\u2019re going to have to make a decision based on your heart, which is another way of saying based on the character you\u2019ve developed over time. Our character is challenged and tested frequently in life, almost constantly. If you have character, consider it important, and keep adding to it, you\u2019re going to be a better person and you\u2019re going to be a better leader. Think of it this way. You really control very little in your life. When you think about the things you absolutely control in your life, you realize it\u2019s not very much at all. But character is one. You actually do control your character. And so you ought not let it lie dormant. I\u2019m curious about the work you\u2019re doing with the NBA and with USA Basketball and how you\u2019ve seen this leader\/follower dynamic play out in a team sports setting. I travel around the league and I try to get four, five or six franchises every year during the season and interact with the various parts of each organization. We talk about team-building, leader development, trust, and responsibility.  I\u2019ve got a dream second career going because first I\u2019m a sports junkie, in particular a basketball junkie, and what I get to do is to share ideas with high performing people who genuinely want to make a difference in this world. From players all the way through the team staff and coaches, they are all extraordinarily receptive and welcoming. So, it\u2019s been great. If I had to pick a single message that I that I tried to provide to coaching staffs in particular, it would be that in my experience as a military leader, I always found we produced the best outcomes when I was able to influence someone to a certain conclusion rather than have to wield my authority. It only makes sense. If you can influence someone toward a particular conclusion, then they take some ownership of it, it becomes partly theirs. And then when they go to implement it, whether it\u2019s a particular offense or defense or a particular community outreach, if you influence them, persuade them to do it, they\u2019re going to do it better than if you coerce them into doing it. You can always wield your authority, and sometimes you may have to do so, but you\u2019re not going to get the same enthusiasm, the same ownership, the same commitment. Better to start thinking about leadership as influence rather than authority. There are a couple quotes from the book that I wanted to ask you about. You have a line that you repeat at the end of each of your introduction sections, whether it was deciding to go to West Point, or deciding to continue your military career, or even becoming Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, you say \u201cThere are people in our lives who may know more about what\u2019s good for us than we do.\u201d I thought it was interesting that someone that has had such incredible responsibility as a leader, seeing that major pieces of your life were determined not by you, but by other people helping guide you. T hat\u2019s exactly why I put that repeating phrase in the introduction, because one of the things I worried about was that the book would be interpreted as just about me. This book is clearly partly memoir, partly leadership and partly followership. But the memoir parts are pretty prominent because most of the stories are obviously mine. But I wanted it to be clear right from the beginning that I believe in my heart that there is an \u201cevery man\u201d quality to my life. Yes, I ended up as the senior military leader in the country and was given all kinds of accolades and responsibilities, and all that was really cool. But this is not just a story of how to become the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. I really wanted the book to be as applicable as possible \u2014 to a parent trying to raise a child or to a financial adviser who has 10 clients or to the commissioner of the NBA who leads 30 franchises and 30 different owners. I wanted the book to be universally applicable, useful, and maybe even a bit interesting. And the way I chose to try to send that message was with that repeating phrase at the beginning of the book. A nother line that really stood out to me was the quote of \u201cliving a felt life.\u201d I was hoping you can explain really what you mean by that, how you have been able to do that and why it\u2019s so important. M y publisher and I had a spirited discussion about whether I should use that phrase in the title or subtitle of the book, because it\u2019s a phrase that has haunted me in a positive way my entire life. I heard it in on one of my first days at West Point from the head of the Department of English. We were all dozing off while he was banging on about the literature and composition curriculum. But at the end of the lecture, he said, you know what I want you all to take away from your experiences here at West Point is the quality of a felt life. And I thought, I have no idea what he\u2019s talking about, but I want to know. So, what I believe I\u2019ve learned is that you go through life and you have to know when to be in the moment. If you\u2019re going to be a real contributor, you can\u2019t be too distracted by the iPhone in your pocket that\u2019s buzzing or by this ubiquitous information era in which we live. But it\u2019s also about not wishing parts of your life away. I tell the plebes [freshmen cadets] that are entering West Point each year that those first years in our military academies can be a pretty challenging experience, even to the point of being an unpleasant experience at times. So, there\u2019s a tendency when you\u2019re faced with unpleasant experiences to wish them away. Like this pandemic, I mean, everybody is talking about how good it will be to get back to normal. Well, okay, but how long are you willing to wait before you try to actually confront the life you have and feel it. Life is really short when you come right down to it. But if you can be in the moment and contribute and live the life you have, not artificially speed it up or wish it away, you can and will make a difference. If you try to life a \u201cfelt\u201d life, you\u2019ll do a much better job of building positive, productive relationships. Yeah, I love that phrase, but I also hope that my answer isn\u2019t everyone\u2019s answer. I just hope it provokes a bit of thought about what it really means to feel your life. I wanted wrap things up by going back to the subtitle of your book \u2014 The Lessons That Matter Most from West Point to the West Wing. So, what was the most important lesson you learned from West Point and what was the most important lesson you learned from the West Wing? Oh, that\u2019s a great question. I do think the most important thing about West Point was relationships and learning about the things that contribute to a positive relationship of trust. West Point is kind of purpose-built to cause you to fail on occasion \u2014 whether it\u2019s a physical challenge, a field test, or in an academic setting \u2014 they push you beyond what you think are your limits and help you understand how to make the best use of the limited time available to you. And you figure out that you are much better off with the help of classmates. You develop an uncommon understanding of the importance of trust. So, I would say that at West Point living a \u201cfelt\u201d life included a deep appreciation for the importance of the team.  Four decades later, I think the thing I took away from my time with President Obama was this idea of how to be a trusted adviser, which is now a course I teach at Duke University. I think it\u2019s important to know what it means to be a trusted adviser. And knowing whether you\u2019re trusted turns out to be as much about \u201cfeeling\u201d it as hearing it. Ultimately, I left the job and my 41 years in the military, proud and optimistic about our country. I mean, you get to see things and you get to do things that really help you understand who we are as a nation. We don\u2019t get it right all the time \u2014 I don\u2019t know that any anyone or anything gets it right all the time \u2014 but we try, and I felt very good about that. You\u2019ve touched on the pandemic a few times and I find it interesting that this book seems so timely for the moment we\u2019re in now, even though I know you had to have been working on this long before this crisis was on the horizon. How important do you see these concepts that you\u2019ve kind of laid out here as being so important and present in the time that we\u2019re going through now? I do feel as though the book \u2014 which I wrote over the course of about 18 months \u2014 is even more relevant now than when I started it.  About halfway through my time as Chairman, in 2014, a lot of things changed globally as well as domestically. On the international side, you know, we had been focused like a laser beam on the threat of terrorism. But up until 2014 we had the luxury of dealing with it as a single threat. All of a sudden in 2014, the Russians annexed Crimea, move into eastern Ukraine and start maneuvering on the borders of NATO in a threatening way. China moves into the South China Sea, starts doing oil exploration, and threatens our allies in the region. ISIS rears its head in northern Iraq. Iran ramps up its behavior of acting out in the Gulf and, of course, Kim Jong un begins to threaten the Korean Peninsula, the region, and even our homeland with ballistic missile testing. And our last encounter with a threatening infectious disease, Ebola, began playing out in West Africa.  A ll of a sudden national security became a lot more complex. But so did a lot of other things. Domestically, we still had the economic pressure of climbing out of the 2008 recession. There was an unmistakable feel of the hardening of politics.  It seemed to me that in the face of increasing complexity, the right answer would be for everyone to get involved, everyone to try to develop a sense of belonging, and everyone to commit to trying to become more open minded and to build a little trust. And that\u2019s what this book is all about.  The book suggests that if you face complex and uncomfortable issues, the answer is not to go to your corners and yell at each other. The answer is to actually try to contribute to finding a solution and try to find a way to trust each other more. And I don\u2019t think I\u2019m being pollyanish. I\u2019m being very pragmatic, actually. That is the only way that we\u2019re going to solve some of these problems. You know, our complex and uncomfortable problems are not going to be solved by one political party or the other. They\u2019re not going to be solved by just the medical community. They\u2019re not going to be solved by just the United States of America. So, you\u2019re right, the book feels a little prescient to me. Is there anything else you would like to add before we wrap things up? As I said earlier in the interview, I just couldn\u2019t be more pleased about the role I\u2019ve been given with the NBA. The NBA\u2019s leaders, at the league office and out in the franchises, have shown that they are candid, compassionate, inclusive, and engaged. They exemplify what I believe.

And given the strangeness of this season, playoff basketball may be determined by matchups more than ever. Matchups obviously aren\u2019t just about who\u2019s guarding whom at the start of a possession. Especially in the playoffs, the offense will try to dictate matchups themselves, setting screens to pit their most potent scorer against the opponent\u2019s most vulnerable defender. At the same time, if every other offensive player isn\u2019t a threat to score, the defense can ignore the one that isn\u2019t, and put more focus on defending the ones that are. Every team in the league has at least one player in its rotation that, come playoff time, will be ignored on offense (like the Thunder\u2019s Luguentz Dort) or targeted on defense (like the Celtics\u2019 Kemba Walker). Some have multiple. If you\u2019re a guard or wing who can\u2019t shoot, you\u2019re probably a liability on offense come playoff time. On the other end of the floor, targeting a particular defender can be as simple as forcing a big man to move his feet on the perimeter or a small guard to defend in the post. The LA Clippers have two of the best two-way players in the world. Neither Kawhi Leonard nor Paul George should be ignored on offense nor targeted on defense. And the Clippers could be the most complete team in the league, with minimal liabilities on either end of the floor. There are a few interesting questions regarding the Clippers, though. And maybe the most interesting is whether Lou Williams should be on the floor down the stretch of a close game. Williams leads the Clippers with 46 clutch field goal attempts and his effective field goal percentage on those shots (56.5%) ranks 14th among 64 players who have attempted at least 35. Over the last three seasons, Williams is 8-for-13 on shots to tie or take the lead in the final minute of the fourth quarter or overtime. That includes three buckets in four tries this season (all four attempts came in the month of November). Two of Williams\u2019 three last-minute, go-ahead buckets were catch-and-shoot attempts (in transition) that could have come from somebody else playing alongside George and Leonard, though both were 2-for-1 situations that Williams is particularly fond of. The Clippers have seven of the 76 players who have shot 39% or better on at least 100 catch-and-shoot 3-point attempts this season. The Utah Jazz (six) are the only other team with more than four. But the other two buckets shown above \u2013 Williams\u2019 go-ahead jumper against Portland (somebody tell Hassan Whiteside to put his hands up) and Montrezl Harrell\u2019s tip-in off Williams\u2019 miss vs. Memphis \u2013 were results of Williams\u2019 ability to create a shot off the dribble. And though the ball will primarily be in the hands of Leonard and George down the stretch of close games, it can only help to have more guys on the floor who can do something with the ball. Williams is among the craftiest scorers in the league ( this 2-for-1 scoop around Kyle Kuzma was delicious) and can take advantage of bigs in the pick-and-roll (examples one , two and three from the second of two classic Celtics-Clippers games). Number to know: The tip-in in Memphis was Harrell\u2019s first (and only) career bucket to tie or take the lead in the final minute of the fourth quarter or overtime. Williams\u2019 playmaking doesn\u2019t just get Harrell tip-ins. He has 127 assists to Harrell , the third most from one player to a single teammate this season. The Clippers get 111.9 minutes per game and 44% of their points from reserves. Those are both the highest rates in the league, and Williams (fifth in total points off the bench , second in total assists off the bench ) and Harrell (second in total points off the bench, third in total rebounds off the bench ) are obviously the biggest parts of that equation. They don\u2019t start, but they finish. Here are the six Williams-to-Harrell, pick-and-roll connections against the Lakers this season: That last one, where LeBron James hedged the first screen (from JaMychal Green) and Williams blew by him with a crossover, was particularly tasty. Number to know: Harrell has scored 1.31 points per possession as a roll man, the third best mark among 28 players who have averaged at least 2.5 roll man possessions per game. Williams will also give Harrell some screen assists. If Williams\u2019 man is top-locking him to prevent a dribble-handoff, Williams will just drive him into Harrell\u2019s defender, clearing the way for a Harrell drive to the cup: Harrell is almost guaranteed to be on the floor down the stretch of close games. His 102 clutch minutes played lead the Clippers . Starting center Ivica Zubac has played only two clutch minutes all season and only 5% of Zubac\u2019s regulation minutes have come in the fourth quarter. That\u2019s the lowest rate among 285 players who have played at least 750 minutes in regulation. (Call it the Carlos Boozer Award.) So Williams can handle the ball, make big shots, and has great chemistry with the Clippers\u2019 big man that will be on the floor with the game on the line. So why is his own place in the Clippers\u2019 late-game lineups even a question? First, his true shooting percentage (which measures scoring efficiency) of 54.6% is his lowest mark of the last eight seasons and ranks last among the nine Clippers who have taken at least 300 shots this season. And primarily, there\u2019s another end of the floor in which opponents can take advantage of the three-time Sixth Man of the Year. A common way offenses try to take advantage of smaller defenders is getting them switched onto a post player or roll man. This happens with Williams and the Clippers\u2019 other small guards, but their teammates are very good at rescuing the little guys from those situations (called a \u201cscram\u201d switch). Play 1. Harrell switches a Danilo Gallinari ball screen for Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, and Gallinari takes Reggie Jackson down to the right block. But Leonard meets him there, having switched off of Nerlens Noel. Marcus Morris rotates down to Noel and Jackson retreats to match up with Terrance Ferguson. Gilgeous-Alexander ends up settling for an ugly, step-back 3-pointer over Harrell. Number to know: The Clippers rank second in opponent 3-point percentage (34.1%). Play 2. Williams starts the possession defending Ferguson, but is quickly guarding Gallinari after two screens for Gilgeous-Alexander. Harrell sees the mismatch right away and leaves Noel on the weak side to bail out his pick-and-roll partner. Again, Morris rotates to Noel and Williams scrambles to match up with Ferguson. Alas, Harrell gets caught on a rip-through move from Gallinari. Number to know:  Opponent effective field goal percentage is the only one of the defensive four factors in which the Clippers rank in the top 10. They rank in the bottom 10 in both opponent free throw rate (27.5 attempts per 100 shots from the field, 21st) and opponent turnover percentage (13.8 per 100 possessions, 21st). Play 3. Morris fights through a Ferguson pin-down screen for Gallinari, but the Thunder get the switch on Ferguson\/Gallinari pick-and-roll out of the corner. Again, Harrell identifies it quickly and crosses the paint to replace Williams. This time, Morris isn\u2019t in position to rotate to Noel, who dives to the rim to take advantage of his mismatch with Williams. But Jackson sees that coming and immediately doubles Noel. Leonard rotates to cover Dennis Schroder in the left corner, Williams recovers out to Leonard\u2019s man (Chris Paul) and the ball ends up in the hands of a 30% 3-point shooter (Dort isn\u2019t the only Thunder player that defenses will ignore in the playoffs). Number to know: The Clippers have seen the league\u2019s second biggest drop in the percentage of their opponents\u2019 shots that have come from the restricted area, from 34.4% (seventh highest opponent rate) last season to 30.0% (seventh lowest) this season. Play 4. Small guard and wings can also have issues guarding a big on the move. Here, LeBron James sets a ball-screen for Avery Bradley and seals Patrick Beverley, who has no hope in defending James\u2019 roll to the rim. Leonard helps off the baseline, leaving Anthony Davis under the basket. Number to know: Among the 25 Clipper two-man combinations that have played at least 500 minutes, the defense has been at its best (100.8 points allowed per 100 possessions) with Beverley and Harrell on the floor together (517 minutes) and at its worst (108.2 allowed per 100) with Williams and Landry Shamet on the floor together (754 minutes). Play 5. When James sets another strong ball screen, Williams is able to get between him and his roll to the rim. So James does the Dirk Nowitzki thing, establishing position at the nail (middle of the free throw line). But when Rajon Rondo (the Lakers\u2019 primary \u201cignore him\u201d candidate) picks up his dribble, George sags off and deflects the entry pass. Number to know: The Clippers have been the league\u2019s second most improved defensive team, having allowed 106.6 points per 100 possessions ( fifth ), 3.8 fewer than they allowed last season (110.4, 19th ). With Williams, Beverley, Jackson and Shamet, the Clippers have four guards that opposing bigs (and big wings) can push around. After the All-Star break , they consistently used a five-man bench unit that had Williams, Jackson and Shamet playing together. The overall numbers were good, but when that unit was on the floor late in the first quarter against the Lakers, Jackson got caught guarding James, a situation that led to a Kuzma layup . The Clippers were 7-1 after the All-Star break when they had both Leonard and George in the lineup. The one loss was that game against the Lakers on March 8, the second half of the weekend in which the Lakers beat both the best team in the East (Milwaukee) and the next best team in the West (the Clips). The Clippers cut a 12-point deficit down to six with a little more than five minutes to go, but that was as close they got, because they couldn\u2019t get enough stops when the Lakers targeted Williams in the pick-and-roll on every possession down the stretch. (Keep an eye on Williams\u2019 reactions after plays 2 and 3.) Play 1. Williams is guarding Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, who sets a high-ball screen for James. Williams hedges the screen, but doesn\u2019t stop the ball-handler, allowing James to get a step on Leonard. Of course, Leonard is so strong, he rips the ball out of James\u2019 hands anyway. Number to know: Leonard ranks fifth in both steals (1.9) and deflections (3.6) per game. Play 2. The Lakers run the same action as on the previous possession, but Williams stops James\u2019 momentum. So Caldwell-Pope comes back for a second screen going in the other direction. Williams again stops James, but then has to recover back to Caldwell-Pope\u2019s flare to the right wing. Caldwell-Pope gets him leaning with a quick pump fake and drives by. Number to know: In their first-round series against the Warriors last year, the Clippers allowed 130.9 points per 100 possessions with Williams and Harrell on the floor together. That was the highest on-court mark among 253 two-man combinations that played at least 100 postseason minutes. Play 3. After a timeout, Williams is guarding Danny Green. He switches onto Avery Bradley, who eventually sets another ball screen for James. Williams\u2019 hard hedge again has him late in recovering to his man and Bradley drains an open 3-pointer from the left wing. Number to know: The Clippers have seen the league\u2019s second biggest jump in the percentage of their opponents\u2019 shots that have come from 3-point range, from 33.1% (fifth lowest rate) last season to 39.0% (ninth highest rate) this season. Play 4. Williams is again guarding Green, but switches onto Caldwell-Pope, who sets the ball screen on James. This time, on Caldwell-Pope\u2019s flare to the left wing, George is in position to help and Anthony Davis doesn\u2019t make him pay (with a cut to the basket) for turning his back on his own man (foreshadowing). Williams\u2019 hedge allows Leonard to recover back to James, Harrell helps on James\u2019 drive, and George rotates down to contest Bradley\u2019s corner 3-pointer (after a pretty ridiculous pass from James). Number to know: The Clippers rank third defensively (107.1 points allowed per 100 possessions in 22 games) against the league\u2019s top 10 offenses . Play 5. Again, Williams is guarding Green, who sets the ball screen for James himself. He holds Leonard in the screen, forcing Williams to switch onto James, who licks his chops as he backs out for the iso. The Lakers clear the strong side of the floor, but both Harrell and Leonard stay in position to help. That\u2019s what they do when James bullies Williams into the paint, but Davis sneaks behind George on the baseline and James feeds his big man. Number to know: Williams has defended 42 isolation possessions, tied for fourth most on the Clippers , according to Synergy play-type tracking. The 0.91 points per possession he\u2019s allowed on isolations is right at the league-average mark. Play 6. Williams is guarding Green again, but when Green goes to set the ball screen, Williams signals for George to switch onto the screener. George then switches the James\/Green screen, but gets called for a foul on James\u2019 drive. Number to know: The Clippers have outscored their opponents by 11.6 points per 100 possessions in 760 minutes with Leonard and George on the floor together and by 11.2 points per 100 possessions in 883 minutes with Leonard on the floor without George, but by just 2.2 points per 100 possessions in 462 minutes with George on the floor without Leonard. Williams can sometimes look helpless in trying to stop James and recover back to his own man. But, as is the case when he\u2019s taken into to the post, it\u2019s on his teammates to have his back, zone up, communicate and see the issues before they arise. Still, that was the Clippers\u2019 last game of note before the season was suspended, and those last five minutes had to give them pause in regard to their default late-game lineup. On the Clippers\u2019 possession after Play 6 above, Morris drew a foul and went to the line. Clippers coach Doc Rivers used that opportunity to replace Williams with Beverley for the next defensive possession. The Clippers will obviously make offense\/defense substitutions when they can, but they won\u2019t always have those opportunities and a possession with four minutes to go could be just as important as a last-minute possession after a timeout. The February additions of Morris and Jackson give the Clippers more lineup options than they had earlier in the season, when they closed games with both Beverley and Williams on the floor. Morris is another versatile forward who can, in theory, defend both guards and bigs, though he got burned by James (examples one , two and three ) in the pick-and-roll in that March game, too. Last season, the Clippers were much better offensively with Williams on the floor ( 113.1 points scored per 100 possessions ) than they were with him off the floor (106.9). At times, he absolutely carried them offensively. This season, his importance to the offense is diminished by the presence of the Clippers\u2019 two new stars. And it could be diminished even more in the playoffs if Rivers staggers the minutes of George and Leonard so that one of the two is on the floor at all times. Of course, if Williams isn\u2019t on the floor on a big defensive possession, the opponent will target somebody else. Maybe it\u2019s Morris or Harrell with a quick guard or Beverley with a big wing. When it comes to defending LeBron James, there\u2019s Kawhi Leonard and there\u2019s everybody else. Every team has these choices to make. The Clippers are good enough that their choices could be the most consequential. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

Speaking on a video call Tuesday to discuss his \u201c202 Assist\u201d program to help pay rent for people in the nation\u2019s capital affected by the coronavirus pandemic, Wall said he is \u201cstill taking my time at the rehab\u201d and working to get himself \u201cin the best shape possible.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m 110%,\u201d the five-time All-Star said. \u201cI\u2019m healthy.\u201d He has not played in an NBA game since December 2018. Surgery for bone spurs in his left heel ended that season; while he was working his way back from that, he tore his left Achilles tendon and needed another operation in 2019. That held Wall out for all of the current season, which was suspended in March because of the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cI\u2019m itching to get back out there,\u201d he said Tuesday. When play was halted, the Wizards were 24-40 and ninth in the Eastern Conference, 5.5 games behind the team in the last playoff spot, the Orlando Magic. Wall\u2019s backcourt mate, shooting guard Bradley Beal, was second in the league in scoring at 30.5 points per game. \u201cI\u2019m just focused on getting back out there and watching how Brad has developed, how our team has developed,\u201d Wall said, \u201chow we have made changes in the organization to prepare ourselves for next season and see what we can do.\u201d He thinks NBA Commissioner Adam Silver will put the safety of players and their families first when deciding whether and how to resume this season. If that can\u2019t be assured, Wall said, \u201cI think they\u2019ll stop the season and prepare for next year.\u201d The Wizards\u2019 practice facility is closed because of lockdown measures, so Wall has been working out at home. He uses an app the Wizards gave players with information about weightlifting, rides his bike and works on shooting and ballhandling at a half-court he has at his house. \u201cI understand how quickly this game can be taken away from you,\u201d Wall said. \u201cI try to play through all injuries, because I feel like, \u2018If it ain\u2019t broke, go play.\u2019 For me, if you take all the money away, I\u2019m still going to play the game the same way I do, because that\u2019s how much I love it.\u201d"},{"id":27659,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/damian-lillard-does-not-want-play-no-playoff-chance","date":"2020-05-26","title":"Damian Lillard says he won't play if Blazers have no chance to reach playoffs","content":" The Portland Trail Blazers are among the teams on the playoff bubble who could be on the outside looking in if the season returns in late July. While the league and the players union negotiate the plans to return , Damian Lillard made clear Tuesday that he is not interested in returning to the floor if the Blazers have no shot at reaching the playoffs. \u201cIf we come back and they\u2019re just like, \u2018We\u2019re adding a few games to finish the regular season,\u2019 and they\u2019re throwing us out there for meaningless games and we don\u2019t have a true opportunity to get into the playoffs, I\u2019m going to be with my team because I\u2019m a part of the team,\u201d Lillard told Chris Haynes of Yahoo Sports over the phone . \u201cBut I\u2019m not going to be participating. I\u2019m telling you that right now. And you can put that in there.\u201d The Blazers \u2014 currently the No. 9 seed in the West standings , 3.5 games behind the eighth-seed Memphis Grizzlies \u2014 expected that the returns of starting center Jusuf Nurkic (from compound fractures of his left tibia) and starting power forward Zach Collins (from left shoulder surgery) would help fuel their playoff push over the final stretch of the regular season. But if the season returns for only a limited number of games before the playoffs, then the Blazers would face long odds to make the postseason. \u201cIf we come back and I don\u2019t have an opportunity to make the playoffs, I will show up to work, I\u2019ll be at practice and I\u2019ll be with my team. I\u2019m going to do all that and then I\u2019m going to be sitting right on that bench during the games,\u201d Lillard told Yahoo Sports. \u201cIf they come back and say it\u2019s something like a tournament, play-in style, between the No. 7 and No. 12 seeds, if we\u2019re playing for playoff spots, then I think that\u2019s perfect. \u201cIt would suck not to get in the playoffs because our thing was, we had fought ourselves back into position to get a spot,\u201d the 29-year-old guard continued. \u201cWe had our starting center and starting power forward coming back, so we had a lot to look forward to and for a great reason. Now, they\u2019re healthy and have extra time to train and rehab while everybody\u2019s rusty. So now, they won\u2019t be coming back as the only rusty players. And if everybody\u2019s rusty, we can come in here and beat everybody. I do feel like if we do come back and our mind is right, we can beat anyone. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be hard to get going with no fans, you\u2019ve been off all this time and some people are just ready for summer like, \u2018I haven\u2019t played in a long time and the season is basically over to me. Do I really care like I cared before?\u2019 It\u2019s going to be a lot of those factors going on and that presents a lot of room for a team to [overperform]. Like, really mess around and knock some teams off and then, \u2018Oh, they\u2019re in the Western Conference finals.\u2019 It\u2019s room for that with this situation. So the fact that it\u2019s possible and we wouldn\u2019t get an opportunity at that, that\u2019s weak to me. I ain\u2019t getting no younger.\u201d The league reportedly hopes to issue guidelines about a return to play before June 1, according to ESPN . Many options reportedly are still under consideration. \u201cRight now, I\u2019m just in a space where I want to come back and play. And if we start playing, I\u2019ll be ready to play. But if the league says it\u2019s only taking playoff teams, then I\u2019m off to a head start in my summer training. I\u2019ll be pissed off because I feel like they basically stopped the season and went straight into the playoffs. We\u2019re chasing the team with the toughest schedule in the league and we\u2019re in ninth place.

The EuroLeague, which is composed of 18 teams across 10 European nations, had been suspended since March 12. League officials said they \u201cexplored every possible option\u201d in trying to find a way to resume the season. \u201cWithout a doubt, this is the most difficult decision we have had to take in our 20-year history,\u201d Euroleague Basketball President and CEO Jordi Bertomeu said. \u201cDue to reasons beyond our control, we have been forced to cut short the most successful and exciting season in European basketball history.\u201d The news came only two days after the NBA announced it, along with the National Basketball Players Association, has entered discussions with The Walt Disney Company on a single-site scenario for a resumption of play in Central Florida in late July. Sports calendars around the globe have been ravaged since March because of the pandemic, with about 5.5 million people worldwide having been confirmed to have the coronavirus \u2014 and roughly 350,000 of those dying because of it, according to data culled by researchers at Johns Hopkins University. The EuroLeague is generally considered the second-best basketball league in the world behind the NBA. Former University of Miami star Shane Larkin was the top scorer in the league this season, averaging 22.2 points per game for the Istanbul-based club Anadolu Efes. Larkin made clear in an Instagram post that he didn\u2019t feel it was prudent for the EuroLeague season to continue. \u201cIt is no secret that since postponing the season players haven\u2019t had the ability to remain in top level shape,\u201d Larkin wrote. \u201cOn top of the risk factor of possibly contracting the virus, the possibility of injuries are extremely high. \u201cEvery team deserves and equal opportunity to win the EuroLeague but because of this pandemic many teams and players don\u2019t have the chance to be as prepared as others,\u201d he added. \u201cI don\u2019t think the EuroLeague champions should be decided by who has the ability to train and who doesn\u2019t.\u201d Larkin\u2019s team led the league with a 24-4 record this season but will not be recognized as champions, with that trophy simply not being awarded this season. The EuroLeague, which is basketball\u2019s equivalent of a Champions League in soccer with the top teams from various nations qualifying to take part, is planning to have all 18 teams from this season in the league again next season.

EuroLeague officials plan to start the 2020-21 season on Oct. 1. \u201cAll the league\u2019s stakeholders maintained their determination and exhausted every possible avenue in trying to deliver a complete and uniquely special season to our fans, whose passion is the driving force for all our efforts,\u201d Bertomeu said. \u201cThat is our commitment and our passion every single season, and so falling short due to forces beyond anyone\u2019s control is what saddens us most.\u201d"},{"id":27672,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nba-tv-promo-week-may-25","date":"2020-05-25","title":"'Memorial Day miracle', Game 6 thrillers and more punctuate NBA TV's lineup","content":"Serious planning for the resumption of the 2019-20 NBA season has begun , but we\u2019re still at least several weeks away from live basketball.

Andrew Cuomo says teams in his state can return to their facilities for training after a pause of more than two months. \u201cStarting today, all the New York professional sports leagues will be able to begin training camps,\u201d the Democratic governor said during a news conference Sunday. The New York City area was one of the hardest-hit parts of the U.S. by the coronavirus pandemic, but COVID-19 deaths and new infections in the state have been trending downward. Major League Baseball, the NBA and the NHL are discussing the resumption of their seasons with their players\u2019 unions. \u201cI believe that sports that can come back without having people in the stadium, without having people in the arena \u2014 do it! Do it!\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cWork out the economics, if you can. We want you up. We want people to be able to watch sports. To the extent people are still staying home, it gives people something to do. It\u2019s a return to normalcy. So we are working and encouraging all sports teams to start their training camps as soon as possible.

The 2019-20 season remains on hiatus because of the coronavirus pandemic and, as such, so do any new playoff memories in May. However, that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t reflect on the final week of May and the moments therein from the NBA\u2019s history book. Below are 22 fantastic May moments in NBA history that are worth looking back on. * * * Why it is important: The Jazz made the Lakers\u2019 budding dynasty wait while they tried to take care of unfinished business from their \u201997 Finals meeting with Chicago. The Jazz outscored the Lakers by 13.5 points per game to handle young Shaquille O\u2019Neal and second-year Kobe Bryant (Nick Van Exel and Eddie Jones were L.A.\u2019s other two All-Stars). So we never got precocious Kobe vs. veteran Jordan on the biggest stage. Years later, O\u2019Neal gave Utah credit in a social media account, posting \u201cWe couldn\u2019t beat these boys for nothing.\u201d * * * Why it is important: New Jersey didn\u2019t just sweep Detroit \u2014 it had swept Boston in the previous round. That meant five days of rest before taking on the Pistons, winning two close games on the road before dominating the next two at home in East Rutherford. Run by point guard Jason Kidd, New Jersey earned a second consecutive trip to The Finals but fell this time to San Antonio in six. For the Pistons, this was the first of six consecutive East finals (or better). Good things were ahead, but the quick exit got coach Rick Carlisle fired and made Detroit only the 12th No. 1 seed to that point to get swept. Why it is important: Finals MVP Rick Barry, who averaged 29.5 points in the series, refers to this as the greatest upset in NBA Finals history. The Warriors had surprised simply by winning 48 games and weren\u2019t expected to last long in the postseason. The Bullets won 60 games with stars Wes Unseld, Elvin Hayes and Phil Chenier. But Barry, Rookie of the Year Jamaal Wilkes and a tight group of role players prevailed, coming back from 14 down in Game 4 to secure the title. * * * Why it is important: Snagging a second conference championship trophy was fine, but Dirk Nowitzki wasn\u2019t content with just that as Dallas beat OKC 4-1 to earn its second Finals appearance. The Mavericks crushed the Thunder\u2019s spirit in Game 4, turning a 15-point deficit with five minutes left into an overtime victory in OKC. So digging out of an eight-point hole in the final quarter two nights later was no biggie. Nowitzki and Shawn Marion scored 26 points each, while Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant combined to shoot 19-for-48 for their 54 points. Nowitzki made a sudden exit from the on-court celebration afterward, determined not to follow the Mavs\u2019 2006 pattern. This time, he was focused on beating the Heat. * * * Why it is important: When LeBron James caught and passed Michael Jordan to take over as the career points leader in NBA playoff games, it didn\u2019t settle anything. It merely fanned more flames in the \u201cwho\u2019s better?\u201d debates that persist to this day. James topped his childhood idol with a 3-pointer from the left wing late in the third quarter of Game 5, a subplot in Cleveland\u2019s 135-102 blowout over the Celtics in Boston that won the East title and got the Cavs to their third consecutive Finals. Jordan scored his 5,987 playoff points in 179 games, while James needed 212 to pass him. * * * Why it is important: Toronto made it to the Finals for the first time in franchise history by making life miserable for Milwaukee\u2019s Giannis Antetokounmpo. It used multiple defenders and thwarted \u201cThe Greek Freak\u201d in his attempts to get to the rim and, just like that, the Bucks\u2019 2-0 series lead was lost in a six-game elimination. Leonard had 27 points and 17 rebounds to help Toronto erase a 15-point deficit in the Game clincher. Why it is important: The Celtics were down by a point with five seconds left, on the brink of slipping behind 3-2 in the series against Detroit. All the Pistons had to do was inbound and run out the \u2014 oops! Isiah Thomas\u2019 floating pass for Bill Laimbeer was intercepted when Bird flashed in. He shoveled it to Dennis Johnson and Boston had life. It wasn\u2019t a momentum play, it was a math play \u2014 the Pistons won Game 6 back at home but now had to play a Game 7. Which the Celtics won, giving us our third and final Finals matchup of Bird and Magic Johnson. * * * Why it is important: In hindsight, imagine if Miami \u2014 in the first season of the LeBron James-Dwyane Wade-Chris Bosh \u201cBig Three\u201d \u2014 had not prevailed in the East finals against Chicago. Miami trailed by 12 with 3:53 left in Game 5, then ripped off a 19-4 run to win. The Heat had James defend Chicago star and reigning MVP Derrick Rose, stifling him at the end. The \u201cBig Three\u201d combined for 69 of their team\u2019s 83 points that day (23 from the foul line to 15 for the entire Bulls team). May 27 Why it is important: A 148-114 trouncing in Game 1 of The Finals might have seemed dominant enough to send Boston to the title \u2026 but that\u2019s why the series is best-of-seven. The Lakers outscored the Celtics by 50 points in these Finals and and clinched the title in Game 6. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who looked old in Game 1 with 12 points and three rebounds, averaged 28.4 points and 10.2 rebounds the rest of the way to earn the Finals MVP at age 38. In the opener, though, Boston was a machine. Led by reserve Scott Wedman\u2019s 11-for-11, the Celtics shot 60 percent. * * * Why it is important: The news on this date wasn\u2019t the series sweep but rather Thomas, Bill Laimbeer and a few other Pistons refusing to shake hands with Michael Jordan and the Bulls after Game 4. It apparently led to Thomas being snubbed from the Dream Team in 1992, and it has hung over the Pistons Hall of Famer ever since. As for the game itself, it was a rout (Bulls 115, Pistons 94), as the proud \u201cBad Boys\u201d had their run of three straight Finals appearances clipped. * * * Why it is important: There was no guarantee at that time that the Bulls would get past Orlando, the team that had put them out a year earlier with a rusty Jordan back on board. Chicago\u2019s 72-10 record suggested the \u201996 meeting might be different. Games 1 and 3 were blowouts, but the other two were decided by five points each. Jordan and Scottie Pippen averaged a combined 48 points, while young Shaquille O\u2019Neal and Penny Hardaway topped that at 52.5 ppg. The Bulls were back, but with O\u2019Neal leaving for the Lakers and Hardaway losing 86 games to injury over the next two seasons, Orlando\u2019s dreams fizzled. Why it is important: First of all, that was a Finals record by blocked shots by a guard \u2014 and it remains so. Second, his defense clearly had an impact in a game Seattle won, 93-92, with the Bullets coming just one point short despite shooting 36 of 107. Unfortunately for Johnson and the Sonics, Washington won three of the next four to take the title. But in a rematch a year later, Seattle beat Washington in five games and Johnson was Finals MVP. * * * Why it is important: Trailing at halftime, down 3-2 in the series and playing in OKC, the Warriors\u2019 73-victory season was teetering on the brink. That\u2019s when Thompson ignited for 26 points in the second half, 19 in the final quarter, to spark the Game 6 win that led to a series victory. He hit a record 11 3-pointers, the last one breaking a 101 tie with 1:35 to go. Without Thompson\u2019s eruption, OKC might have advanced \u2014 and maybe beaten LeBron James\u2019 Cavs in The Finals, altering his legacy at least for a year. * * * Why it is important: The Warriors fended off elimination in Game 6 of this series and climbed from a 10-point hole that game. When they were down 54-43 halfway through Game 7 on the road, they erased that deficit in less than 12 minutes, outscoring the Rockets 33-15 in the third quarter. This is the game that threw Houston\u2019s obsession with the 3-ball, and James Harden\u2019s style of play, into serious doubt. The Rockets shot 7-for-44 on 3-pointers, with Harden and Eric Gordon combining to go 4-for-25. Golden State got a 12-for-26 combo platter from the arc from Stephen Curry and Durant. Why it is important: Magic big men Shaquille O\u2019Neal and Horace Grant had fouled out and the home-standing Pacers faced a potential 3-1 series deficit. The two teams traded haymakers in rapid succession: a Brian Shaw 3-pointer, then a Reggie Miller 3-pointer and then a lunging Penny Hardaway 3-pointer with 1.3 seconds left. Pacers center Rik Smits caught an inbounds pass, got aging Magic big man Tree Rollins to bite on a fake, then stepped under for a 14-foot game-winner. The Magic, however, would ultimately win the series in Game 7 at home. * * * Why it is important: To fans of the Jazz and Hall of Fame point guard John Stockton, this looms as arguably the most thrilling moment in franchise history. Stockton\u2019s shot to beat the buzzer snapped Utah\u2019s streak of 13 playoff appearances as a bridesmaid, finally boosting them to The Finals. In sinking the shot, Stockton capped a furious fourth quarter Utah rally that eliminated aging Houston legends Hakeem Olajuwon, Charles Barkley and Clyde Drexler. * * * Why it is important: Something about May 29 appealed to the Lakers, because for three consecutive postseasons, that was the date on which they eliminated their competition out West to advance to The Finals. Didn\u2019t matter if it was the Spurs, the Nuggets or the Suns. Didn\u2019t pack all that much drama, either, since none of the three conference finals rounds produced a Game 7. A scan of the rosters shows that no Lakers player in those three years had a birthday in May, never mind specifically on May 29. Neither did coach Phil Jackson. So it must have been a fluke of the calendar, and a tribute to the talent of Kobe Bryant, Pau Gasol, Derek Fisher, Lamar Odom and the role players, with a touch of triangle and Zen. Why it is important: The Sixers finally broke through after suffering Finals losses in three of the previous six seasons. This wound up being the only championship won by Hall of Famers Julius Erving and Moses Malone. Erving took the Sixers to four Finals before this, but it took Malone\u2019s arrival for 1982-83 to push Philadelphia over the top. This was the postseason of Moses\u2019 \u201cFo\u2019, fo\u2019, fo\u2019\u201d prediction of three spring sweeps, which the Sixers missed only by dropping one game to Milwaukee in the East finals. * * * Why it is important: Sometimes Michael Jordan\u2019s remarkable scoring nights get dismissed as empty calories. That\u2019s wrong most of the time, particularly in this one. The Bulls were at risk of going down 3-1 against the Knicks, which would have derailed their first three-peat. After a 3-for-18 night in Game 3, Jordan outscored New York\u2019s top two players (Patrick Ewing, John Starks) by himself. Momentum shifted, and no Knick besides Ewing scored more than 17 in the last two games of the series. * * * Why it is important: The closest the Jordan-era Bulls ever came to elimination \u2014 and a documentary series-spoiling exit as Eastern Conference finalists \u2014 came against a loaded Pacers team. It was Chicago\u2019s next-to-last dance, in effect, pushed to the limit after Reggie Miller\u2019s clutch 3-pointer evened the series at 3-3. This was a gang effort as Toni Kukoc (21 points) and Steve Kerr were heroes late while Jordan (28 points, nine boards, eight assists) played strong defense on Miller late when Ron Harper\u2019s sore back required the switch. * * * Why it is important: An unremarkable series near the end of a mostly dreary 50-game lockout-shortened season still offered something for the ages: the Memorial Day Miracle. San Antonio trimmed an 18-point deficit in Game 2 to two when Sean Elliott, the Spurs small forward, caught an inbounds pass, battled with his balance and \u2014 as Rasheed Wallace charged at him \u2014 launched from the right side. His heels hovered over the sideline, but his toes (and the shot) were in. From there, Portland never recovered, got swept and San Antonio reached its first Finals (where it won in five games for its first title). * * * Why it was important: Sacramento went an NBA-best 61-21 in 2001-02 behind Chris Webber, Peja Stojakovic and a deep roster. But the Lakers were still busy with their three-peat, fueling speculation that the NBA preferred the defending champs to advance. How else, Kings fans said, to explain the Lakers shooting 40 free throws (27 in the fourth quarter), when they had averaged just 25 through the series\u2019 first five games? How else to explain Mike Bibby getting whistled for grabbing Kobe Bryant, when Bryant elbowed Bibby in the face (maybe a split second later)? Well, first of all, legit whistles. In Game 7, on their own court, in overtime , the Kings lost in part because they missed 14 of 30 free throws. But there\u2019s no denying that Sacramento group would have a different legacy if they had reached one Finals. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

The National Basketball Players Association is also part of the talks with Disney. Games would be held at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex, a massive campus on the Disney property near Orlando. NBA spokesman Mike Bass said the conversations were still \u201cexploratory,\u201d and that the site would be used not only for games but for practices and housing as well. \u201cOur priority continues to be the health and safety of all involved, and we are working with public health experts and government officials on a comprehensive set of guidelines to ensure that appropriate medical protocols and protections are in place,\u201d Bass said. The ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex is a 255-acre campus with multiple arenas that could host games simultaneously and has been home to, among other things, the Jr. NBA World Championship in recent years. ESPN is primarily owned by Disney, one of the NBA\u2019s broadcast partners. Space won\u2019t be an issue, even if Major League Soccer \u2014 which is also in talks to resume its season at Disney \u2014 is there at the same time as the NBA. The entire Disney complex is roughly 40 square miles, with nearly 24,000 hotel rooms owned or operated by Disney within the campus. The NBA suspended its season March 11, becoming the first of the U.S. major pro leagues to do so after it became known that All-Star center Rudy Gobert of the Utah Jazz tested positive for COVID-19. The list of NBA players who were known to test positive eventually grew to 10 \u2014 not all were identified \u2014 and Commissioner Adam Silver said last month that the actual total was even higher. But the league has been working on countless return-to-play scenarios for several weeks, all with the caveat that testing would be an integral part of any resumption of the season. Teams have been allowed to welcome players back to their training facilities for voluntary sessions since May 8, and more than half of the league\u2019s franchises have taken advantage of that opportunity. The next steps would likely include a loosening of the restrictions for those voluntary workouts \u2014 no more than four players are currently allowed inside any facility at a time \u2014 and then a plan for when training camps could open. If the league plans to resume play in late July, then camps conceivably could open around the start of that month."},{"id":27673,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/jerry-sloan-passes-away-78","date":"2020-05-22","title":"Hall of Fame coach Jerry Sloan passes away at 78","content":" Jerry Sloan, the coach who took the Utah Jazz to the NBA Finals in 1997 and 1998 on his way to a spot in the Basketball Hall of Fame, died Friday. He was 78. The Jazz said he died from complications related to Parkinson\u2019s disease and Lewy body dementia. Sloan spent 23 seasons coaching the Jazz. The team \u2014 with John Stockton and Karl Malone leading the way in many of those seasons \u2014 finished below .500 in only one of those years. Sloan won 1,221 games in his career, the fourth-highest total in NBA history. In a statement released by the NBA, commissioner Adam Silver said: \u201c Jerry Sloan was among the NBA\u2019s most respected and admired legends. After an All-Star playing career in which his relentless style shaped the Chicago Bulls in their early years, he became one of the all-time greatest head coaches during 23 seasons with the Utah Jazz \u2013 the second-longest tenure in league history. \u201c He was the first coach to win 1,000 games with the same organization, which came to embody the qualities that made Jerry a Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer: persistence, discipline, drive and selflessness. His more than 40 years in the NBA also paralleled a period of tremendous growth in the league, a time when we benefited greatly from his humility, kindness, dignity and class. Our thoughts are with Jerry\u2019s wife, Tammy, and their family, as well as his former players, colleagues and the Bulls and Jazz organizations.\u201d The Jazz, in their statement, said Sloan \u201cepitomized the organization\u201d and offered their condolences to he and his family. \u201cJerry Sloan will always be synonymous with the Utah Jazz,\u201d the team said in a statement. \u201cHe will forever be a part of the Utah Jazz organization and we join his family, friends and fans in mourning his loss. We are so thankful for what he accomplished here in Utah and the decades of dedication, loyalty and tenacity he brought to our franchise.\u201d Current Jazz coach Quin Snyder said he learned quickly about how important Sloan has been to the organization. \u201cBefore coming to Utah, I was certainly aware of Coach Sloan and what he meant to the NBA and to the coaching world. But, upon living in Utah, I became acutely aware of just how much he truly meant to the state,\u201d Snyder said in a statement. \u201cThe clear identity that he established for Jazz basketball \u2014 unselfishness, toughness and the essential importance of team \u2014 has always left a palpable responsibility to strive for in carrying forward. He will be missed and mourned by the Jazz family, the NBA and beyond.\u201d  Utah went to The Finals twice under Sloan, both times falling to Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls. Sloan was a former player of the Bulls from 1966-76 and his jersey hangs in the rafters of the United Center. \u201cJerry Sloan was \u2018The Original Bull\u2019 whose tenacious defense and nightly hustle on the court represented the franchise and epitomized the city of Chicago,\u201d Chicago Bulls Chairman Jerry Reinsdorf said in statement after Sloan\u2019s passing. \u201cJerry was the face of the Bulls organization from its inception through the mid-1970s, and very appropriately, his uniform No. 4 was the first jersey retired by the team. A great player and a Hall-of-Fame NBA coach, most importantly, Jerry was a great person. Our sympathies go out to the Sloan family and all his many fans.\u201d Sloan entered the Hall of Fame in 2009. \u201cI\u2019m not into numbers and stuff like that,\u201d Sloan said when he passed Pat Riley for No. 3 on the NBA\u2019s all-time win list in 2010; Gregg Popovich has since surpassed him for that spot. \u201cI never have been. I\u2019ve got a great organization to work for that\u2019s given me an opportunity to stay there for a long time. I\u2019m very thankful for that and the coaches that I have with me. It\u2019s not about me.\u201d Popovich offered his condolences on Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s a sad day for all of us who knew Jerry Sloan,\u201d the Spurs coach said. \u201cNot only on the basketball court but, more importantly, as a human being. He was genuine and true. And that is rare. He was a mentor for me from afar until I got to know him. A man who suffered no fools, he possessed a humor, often disguised, and had a heart as big as the prairie.\u201d  He spent 34 years in the employ of the Jazz organization, either as head coach, assistant, scout or senior basketball adviser. Sloan started as a scout, was promoted as an assistant under Frank Layden in 1984 and became the sixth coach in franchise history on Dec. 9, 1988, after Layden resigned. Sloan\u2019s longevity with the Jazz was remarkable. During his time in Utah, there were 245 coaching changes around the league and five teams \u2014 Charlotte, Memphis, Toronto, Orlando and Minnesota \u2014 did not even exist when he took the helm with the Jazz. \u201dLike Stockton and Malone as players, Jerry Sloan epitomized the organization,\u201d the Jazz\u2019s team statement added. \u201dHe will be greatly missed.\u201d The Associated Press contributed to this report."},{"id":27671,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/fsu-devin-vassell-draft-feature","date":"2020-05-22","title":"Devin Vassell ready for next challenge after disproving doubters","content":"When it comes to recruiting, Florida State coach Leonard Hamilton and his staff couldn\u2019t care less about star rankings. \u201cWe like looking under more rocks,\u201d Hamilton says, laughing. \u201cI don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve ever asked one of my assistants where a kid was rated. I\u2019m not even sure the last time I looked at a rating, to be honest with you.\u201d The FSU coaches value character and work ethic more than pre-college accolades. Not that skill level isn\u2019t one of their criteria, too, but it\u2019s a lot easier to develop skill than it is character and work ethic. \u201cWe spend more time coaching their minds and their spirits than their bodies,\u201d Hamilton says. \u201cWhen we grow and develop those mental and emotional skills, it allows them to have a better approach and focus on how to overcome physical challenges.\u201d That approach helps explain the Seminoles\u2019 success under Hamilton \u2014 they won the ACC regular-season championship in 2020 and Hamilton, who just finished his 18th season in Tallahassee, is ranked fifth in league history in career wins and career ACC wins. It also helps explain how FSU found Devin Vassell, who in two years in Hamilton\u2019s system transformed from a scrawny, under-recruited guard into a player widely considered a lottery pick in the 2020 NBA Draft. Before the Seminoles became involved in his recruiting, Vassell had been offered Division I scholarships by only Presbyterian and North Florida. Hamilton gives his assistant coaches unilateral decision-making power in recruiting, which is why when Charlton \u201cC.Y.\u201d Young first heard Vassell\u2019s name, from a trusted source in Atlanta in March 2017, he got fired up. \u201cI\u2019d had some people in Atlanta calling me about a kid from Peachtree Ridge High School,\u201d Young says. \u201cThere hadn\u2019t been a player come out of there in like 100 years. Maybe a couple Division II guys. But I\u2019ve got one source there, anytime he calls me, I catch a flight, because he can evaluate. So he tells me, \u2018listen man, I\u2019ve got one \u2014 he isn\u2019t ranked anywhere, but I\u2019m telling you, he\u2019s a pro.\u2019\u201d The next day Young was in Atlanta, watching a scrimmage arranged just for him. It took Young all of six minutes to agree with the assessment he\u2019d heard a day earlier. Vassell was pro. Young wasn\u2019t the least bit concerned about Vassell\u2019s then 6-foot-5, 163-pound frame. Young gets animated retelling part of what he saw in those six minutes. \u201cFirst possession, a guy drives baseline. Devin rotates and pins it to the glass,\u201d Young says. \u201cThey go the other way, he dribbles into the paint, makes a 10-foot floater. Back on defense, they swing it around, he breaks into the passing lane and takes it the length of the floor, but he doesn\u2019t lay it up. He passes to another guy.\u201d After Young watched Vassell make an open 3-pointer from the corner on another possession and then tip dunk a missed 3 on yet another, he was sold. He didn\u2019t need to call Hamilton. Young offered Vassell a scholarship on the spot. \u201cI thought, this kid\u2019s the truth,\u201d Young says. \u201cI thought he would be a four-year guy, but I thought he\u2019d be a pro. I thought he was Allan Houston. High-character kid, gym rat. Looks like a Huxtable, but the guy wakes up every morning mad as hell because he was ranked like No. 200 in the country.\u201d When Vassell showed up at Florida State, he wasn\u2019t any less angry. If anything, he was even hungrier to prove he belonged. \u201cBefore Devin got here, a lot of people in his community asked him, \u2018why are you going to an ACC school?\u201d says longtime FSU assistant coach Stan Jones. \u201cYou\u2019re never gonna play there. You\u2019re probably gonna redshirt. People were filling him with negativity. So he immediately makes friends with [then junior guard] Trent Forrest. And now they\u2019re the best of friends. Trent showed him how to get in the gym and work on his own. Taught him how to understand and apply scouting reports. Showed him how to get the most out of watching film, and how to conduct himself on campus and the community. Peer leadership put Devin on the fast track.\u201d Vassell\u2019s freshman year statistics were modest \u2014 playing on a deep team, he averaged 4.5 points and 1.5 rebounds \u2014 but his 3-point percentage was proof of how hard he was willing to work. Vassell was a career 21% 3-point shooter in high school. He shot 41.9% on 3-pointers in his first season at FSU. As a sophomore, Vassell led the Seminoles in scoring (12.7 ppg), rebounding (5.1 rpg) and 3-point percentage (41.5%) and was second in steals (42) and blocked shots (29). Everything Young saw in that scrimmage in Atlanta had come to pass \u2014 Vassell was a stat-sheet stuffer. But he wasn\u2019t going to be a four-year player. In March, Vassell declared for the Draft.

Like a Danny Green, who was in San Antonio and Toronto and has stayed in the league a long time. He\u2019s got great basketball IQ. He\u2019s a great finisher in transition. He\u2019s got an unbelievable ability to go left or right, take one or two dribbles and get his primary defender up in the air a little bit. And he\u2019s a killer on mid-range jumpers.

It was only a year ago that the 21-year-old rookie was sharing living space as a college student during his final season at the University of Tennessee. So when Celtics teammate Kemba Walker invited Williams to join him at his home in Charlotte, North Carolina, shortly after the NBA went on its pandemic hiatus, Williams jumped at the offer. \u201cIt\u2019s been amazing,\u201d Williams said. \u201cJust hanging out, relaxing, being able to get to know each other better as well as work out together. We\u2019re here, we\u2019re isolating on our own means. \u2026 It was just a great decision.\u201d Williams, who grew up in the Charlotte area, was initially debating whether to remain in Boston or join his family in North Carolina at the start of the COVID-19 outbreak. But that would have meant being close to his grandparents and potentially putting them at a higher risk of contracting the disease. \u201cFor as much as I talk, I\u2019m glad that he even considered it,\u201d Williams said of Walker\u2019s overture. Warmer weather in Charlotte as compared to Boston has allowed Williams to use Walker\u2019s outdoor court and other spaces to work on his ball handling and his shooting. He\u2019s also been going through workouts given to him by the Celtics\u2019 trainers. \u201cI feel like a lot of us are going to be prepared when we get back,\u201d Williams said. \u201cNo matter how soon it will be, we\u2019re going to speed up to the peak shape that we can be at and as healthy as we can be, too.\u201d One scenario being looked at by NBA officials for a restart is for Eastern Conference teams to be based in Orlando and play their games at the vast Disney Wide World of Sports complex. That facility is already equipped with much of the physical and technical infrastructure the NBA would need, having hosted WNBA preseason tournaments, national AAU championships and other multi-team events. But it remains unclear at this point whether the league would try to resume the season with an abbreviated schedule or proceed to a modified version of the playoffs. Whatever eventually gets ironed out, Williams is confident it will be done putting players\u2019 health and safety at the forefront. \u201cIt\u2019s my first year so I haven\u2019t gotten to play in the playoffs yet. It\u2019s gonna be a fun time if and when we get the season back,\u201d he said. \u201cI just kind of try to go with the flow and respect that the organization and the NBA will do their best to make the wisest and safest decision possible. \u2026 We\u2019re just gonna go with what they give us.\u201d"},{"id":27641,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/marty-mcneal-sacramento-kings-beat-writer-passes-away","date":"2020-05-21","title":"Former Kings beat writer Marty McNeal passes away at age 64","content":" The NBA world mourned the loss of longtime Sacramento Kings beat writer and columnist Martin \u201cMarty\u201d McNeal on Thursday.

No, it wasn\u2019t that she played basketball. Lots of people did that, including girls of Chinese descent growing up in the Bay Area in the 1930s. Her grandmother\u2019s teammate dared something even bolder: She slapped a white opponent who had struck her first. \u201cThis was during segregation, the time of the Yellow Peril [that indicated Asians were a danger to the U.S.] and the Chinese Exclusion Act that prevented Asians from immigrating here,\u201d says Yep, a professor of Asian American Studies at Claremont Colleges. So, what made the woman fight back? \u201cSports allowed [my grandmother and her teammates] to stand up and be empowered. This was a moment that showed what sports could be in this space of segregation.\u201d Yep shared the story at the recent Asians in Sports & Culture Symposium, an annual event jointly run by Asian employee resource groups (ERGs) at MLB, the NBA and the NFL. The symposium, held virtually during Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, was first convened in 2018. This year\u2019s theme was \u201cRepresentation Matters\u201d and attracted more than 200 people from sports, entertainment and business. The hourlong event featured a keynote address by MLB Senior Vice President Jim Small, a U.S. native who lived in Asia for 16 years nurturing baseball\u2019s growth there. He discussed baseball\u2019s outreach outside the United States and how sports helped him and his family find common interests overseas. Yep and three other prominent scholars who have studied the relationship between the Asian diaspora and sports discussed a variety of topics, including the anti-Asian violence that has risen since COVID-19 began spreading around the world. Their main focus, however, centered on how the passion Asians have for athletics has largely been ignored in the U.S., even as that fervent participation has helped immigrants feel more American. \u201cIn U.S. history, baseball, football and basketball have been key sites where people can play into citizenship,\u201d said Stan Thangaraj, a Socio-Cultural Anthropologist at the City College of New York. \u201cFor immigrant and refugee communities that I\u2019ve studied, they all signaled sports as one of those realms \u2014 unlike other reams, where they felt stereotyped as too foreign, too immigrant, not man enough \u2014 where they could claim their own belonging and do it on their own terms. When you have a deadly crossover and you break someone\u2019s ankles, your ethnicity doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d A co-chair of the NBA\u2019s ERG, Asian Professional Exchange (APEX), Gautam Kapur helped conceive the symposium. He was born in Washington D.C., but spent his formative years in Australia, Singapore and India. Despite having never been to a live NBA game or seeing a South Asian NBA player to relate to on the court, Kapur still loved the game. He believes we will soon see more NBA players of Asian heritage, but we must remember the pioneers that paved the way. \u201cMost people tend to think Asian history in basketball starts with Yao Ming or Jeremy Lin. But that\u2019s not the case. In fact, the first NBA player of Asian descent [Wataru Misaka] was drafted over 50 years before Yao Ming,\u201d Kapur, now a Basketball Technology and Innovation Senior Analyst at the NBA, said afterward. \u201cThat\u2019s what inspired us to create the symposium. We wanted to create a platform where our community could share our sports stories and histories. There are very few spaces in which to do that.\u201d During the symposium, Ryan Reft, a Historian and Curator at the Library of Congress , discussed the history and impact of baseball on Japan and Japanese Americans. He revealed how the sport helped build bridges between Japan and the U.S. after World War II, and how Japanese Americans held in internment camps formed baseball teams. Chia Youyee Vang, an associate vice chancellor at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee who has studied Hmong migration, talked about how football has captivated those of Hmong descent, many whose families immigrated to the U.S. in the 1970s and 1980s. Vang played softball growing up, but her son plays for his high school football team and can always hear her cheering. \u201cHe told me, \u2018Mom, you\u2019re the smallest mother but the loudest.\u2019\u201d Even so, each speaker discussed how Asian Americans often face disrespect when it comes to sports. Thangaraj mentioned how Jeremy Lin was a top basketball player in California his senior year of high school but received little attention from major programs. He also said media portrayals of Asians limit them. For instance, South Asians, who have won 11 of the last 13 Scripps National Spelling Bees, are portrayed as \u201call brain,\u201d Thangaraj said, and the infrastructure to acknowledge their athletic talents doesn\u2019t exist. The three sports leagues, they said, can do more outreach to encourage and acknowledge the passion that Asian Americans have for sports. Those who attended the symposium agreed the event was a great start. \u201cI really appreciated the historical context and it was an eye-opener to understand how sports became so big in the Asian demographic,\u201d said Ilene Tsao, who like Yep\u2019s grandmother, grew up playing basketball in the Bay Area. Today she\u2019s an associate manager in Global Partnerships at the NBA and an APEX co-chair. \u201cI hope people walked away with a little more appreciation for how Asians fit into this larger picture of mainstream American sports. As one of the professors said, we often get forgotten,\u201d Tsao continued. \u201cI also loved the community aspect of this event. The fact that we got 200 people to be part of an event that focused on Asians and sports was incredible. I hope people felt that community. And if you left the symposium thinking \u2018Hey, Asians are a bigger part of these sports than I thought,\u2019 then it was a success.\u201d"},{"id":27721,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/jazz-mike-conley-waiting-news","date":"2020-05-20","title":"Players across NBA await news on season's next steps","content":" Mike Conley is waiting for further instructions. So is the rest of the NBA. The league is continuing to work through multiple return-to-play scenarios, with two people with knowledge of the situation saying Wednesday that Orlando \u2014 which has been talked about for several weeks \u2014 along with Las Vegas and Houston remain under consideration. The people spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the league has made no final decisions. More than half of the league\u2019s teams have now opened facilities for voluntary player workouts, with Minnesota expected to be the next to do so on Thursday. Utah is among the teams that has opened, but Conley is still at his home in Ohio and has yet to return to Salt Lake City for those sessions at the Jazz facility. \u201cI\u2019ve been working as if we\u2019re coming back,\u201d Conley said Wednesday. \u201cIf anything, I\u2019d like to know a direction, just to know whether to keep putting the foot on the pedal or, you know, back off a little bit and rest easier if we\u2019re not playing until the following year and following season. So, I think it just is going to be a wait-and-see kind of game. I\u2019ll be ready, one way or another.\u201d Also Wednesday, Jared Dudley of the Los Angeles Lakers said he is \u201c90% confident\u201d that the NBA is coming back this season and that he believes players owe it to the fans to try and finish the year. But Dudley also said that the notion of the league resuming in a \u201cbubble\u201d has been misguided, and that players will be allowed to leave the NBA campus, wherever it is \u2014 knowing they\u2019ll be running a risk by doing that. \u201cIf you come back with corona, you can\u2019t play,\u201d Dudley said. \u201cSo we\u2019re going to be tested all the time, and so it would be smart of teams \u2026 all the top guys that we have, we\u2019ll be wrapping them in bubble and not letting them go anywhere. Let\u2019s just be honest, they can\u2019t leave. And so, you would want that to be a team rule.\u201d Wednesday marked the end of the 10th week since the NBA shut down on March 11 , a move that came once it was known that Jazz center Rudy Gobert tested positive for the coronavirus. The pandemic halted a season that had 259 games left to play, but none of those games have been officially canceled yet. Ordinarily, the NBA would be into the conference-finals portion of the playoff schedule at this point. Players who were paid May 15 saw 25% of those checks withheld in anticipation of some games being canceled, and if no more regular-season games are played they could lose a total of about $850 million in gross salary. The league remains hopeful that some sort of decision on whether the season can resume can be made in the coming weeks. Commissioner Adam Silver detailed a two-to-four-week window when he met with members of the National Basketball Players Association electronically on May 8 , and that window would theoretically end June 5. The next steps would likely include additional guidance from the league on when teams can expand their voluntary workouts; at this point, no more than four players are allowed in a facility at a given time, and some have enacted even stricter policies on their own. From there, a plan for training camps would likely follow, and when those camps \u2014 which will almost certainly be preceded by a quarantine period \u2014 begin, games could follow potentially as soon as three weeks later. Should all that happen, camps could start in June and games may resume in July. There are still a litany of issues to work out, such as all the details surrounding testing , which the league has said would have to be part of any return-to-play scenario. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be back as soon as we hear even more encouraging, positive news from our league,\u201d Conley said. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve heard as far as from the COVID standpoint, I think things have gotten better. So, I think that it eases a lot of our \u2026 reservations of not wanting to leave our homes.\u201d \u2014 AP Sports Writer Greg Beacham in Los Angeles contributed to this story"},{"id":27712,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/timberwolves-leading-leaguewide-coronavirus-study","date":"2020-05-20","title":"Wolves, Mayo Clinic leading leaguewide coronavirus study","content":"The NBA season has been on hiatus since March 11 because of the coronavirus pandemic . The road back to basketball returning is an unknown one, but antibody testing could provide a key piece in that process. Per ESPN\u2019s Malika Andrews and Adrian Wojnarowski, the Minnesota Timberwolves and the Rochester, Minn.-based Mayo Clinic are leading a leaguewide study that aims to show what percentage of NBA players, coaches and executives have antibodies to the coronavirus. The Ringer\u2019s Kevin O\u2019Connor reports that the NBA is looking into \u201cgroup testing,\u201d which aims to examine a large number of people with a few tests. Timberwolves doctor Dr. Robby Sikka is spearheading the antibody initiative, which is expected to have the participation of all 30 teams, ESPN reports. National Basketball Players Association executive director Michele Roberts told The Ringer that players are willing to provide antibody samples. \u201cOur players have embraced the opportunity to contribute to this important public health study that will help researchers better understand the prevalence of COVID-19, potentially improve care for patients, and promote long-term efforts to develop a vaccine and treatment for the virus,\u201d Roberts told The Ringer. Teams are beginning to re-open practice facilities to players around the NBA and teams are seeking information about mitigating the risk of infection for players and staff. Sikka is one of 10 people on the NBA\u2019s sports science committee and has become a key resource for the league in its mitigation efforts. \u201cWe are learning about this disease,\u201d Sikka told ESPN. \u201cWe have learned a lot in two months. So if we can take the next two months, learn on the fly, mitigate risk, then we can move pretty quickly to do the right things to have safe play.\u201d The NBA\u2019s antibody study is expected to be completed in June and in assessing the prevalence of antibodies, NBA personnel will help teams identify which people might have less of a risk of contracting COVID-19. Antibody testing is new and doctors are working to understand what the prevalence of antibodies means. It is mostly unclear that even if a person tests positive for coronavirus antibodies how long they have immunity to coronavirus. The Associated Press reported in early May that NBA teams were told about the antibody study that was seeking players and staff to voluntarily participate in. Teams were told that the study would also help doctors understand the prevalence of COVID-19 among infected individuals who were asymptomatic or experienced only mild symptoms. \u201cFrom a team perspective, and saying this broadly across all teams, participation across the NBA allows for more robust information from the community at large in providing prevalence data,\u201d Dr. Jimmie Mancell, the team physician for the Memphis Grizzlies, told The Associated Press. In group testing, multiple individuals are \u201cgrouped\u201d together into the same lab test. This could be done randomly or by mixing samples from members of the same team. This helps reduce the number of coronavirus tests that would be needed and, if the test is positive, those people\u2019s samples would be retested to locate which individual in the group are responsible for the positive test. In the proposed antibody study, blood samples will be collected from those involved using finger prick methods and blood draws. In a memo that was sent to teams that was reviewed by ESPN, the Mayo Clinic hopes the study will help validate the less invasive method and make widespread antibody testing available for the general public.

And then they got better defensively. When the league suspended the 2019-20 season, the Raptors had allowed 104.9 points per 100 possessions, the league\u2019s second best mark and 1.9 fewer than they allowed last season (when they ranked fifth defensively). This defensive improvement without Kawhi Leonard had the champs on pace to tie the franchise record for regular season wins (59). The Raptors lost Leonard, but they brought back a core of seven guys who played at least 1,300 minutes (regular season and playoffs combined) on that championship squad. From watching the Raptors early in the season (and even in the preseason), it became clear those seven guys came back with a certain level of institutional knowledge, big-game experience, cohesion and trust. Those qualities materialize most on defense. Raptors head coach Nick Nurse will try a lot of things on that end of the floor, but within his different schemes, his team will always come with pressure, always prioritize protecting the basket and always have each other\u2019s backs. That requires effort, which is abundant on this team. The Raptors got their rings, but they\u2019re still willing to do the work to get stops. \u201cFor any defense that you play,\u201d Nurse told NBA.com earlier this season, \u201cif you play smart and you hustle, you\u2019ll be pretty good.\u201d The Raptors\u2019 defense is more than pretty good. Good defense starts in transition. According to Second Spectrum tracking, league-wide effective field goal percentage is 60.0% in the first six seconds of the shot clock, 53.1% in the middle 12 seconds, and 43.9% in the last six seconds. According to Synergy play-type tracking, the Raptors rank 12th (lowest) in percentage of their opponents\u2019 possessions that have been in transition (15.4%). But the 1.04 points per possession they\u2019ve allowed in transition is the league\u2019s lowest mark . The Raptors\u2019 success in transition begins with the fact that they don\u2019t really crash the offensive glass. Toronto ranks 22nd in offensive rebounding percentage, having grabbed 25.9% of available offensive boards. Rondae Hollis-Jefferson and Serge Ibaka rank in the top 50 among individuals , but watch the Raptors and you won\u2019t often see them chasing offensive rebounds. Combine that with how much they space floor offensively and they\u2019re rarely putting themselves out of position in regard to transition defense. (It also helps that only 49% of their own turnovers, the league\u2019s lowest rate, have been live balls.) As they get back on defense, the Raptors will prioritize rim protection. In doing that, they\u2019ll give up some transition 3-pointers (here are some examples \u2013 one , two , three \u2013 from their early-March game in Phoenix). But league-wide, 2-point shots in the first six seconds of the shot clock (1.26 points per attempt) are worth a lot more than 3-point shots in the first six seconds (1.11). Over the last 18 seconds of the shot clock, 3s are more valuable (1.07 vs. 1.01). Here are a few plays to illustrate the Raptors getting stops in transition: Play 1. Patrick McCaw misses a 3-pointer from the right corner, but is able to get back and put pressure on Devin Booker as he dribbles across midcourt, forcing a turnover and generating a transition opportunity for the Raptors themselves. Number to know: The Raptors rank second with 17.2 deflections per game . Play 2. Both Pascal Siakam and Chris Boucher (a rare occasion when a Raptor chases an offensive board) are behind the ball, but McCaw again gets in the ball-handler\u2019s way. When Mikal Bridges attacks the paint, there are three other Raptors there to meet him. On the kickout, Matt Thomas sells out to prevent a catch-and-shoot attempt from Jevon Carter, who has to shoot a side-step 3-pointer instead. Number to know: The Raptors lead the league in opponent 3-point percentage (33.7%). Play 3. All five Raptors are back, but Ibaka never goes to his man, staying focused on the ball. And when Andrew Wiggins gets by Norman Powell, Ibaka is there to help and block the shot. Number to know: Toronto opponents have an effective field goal percentage of just 56.4% in the first six seconds of the shot clock, according to Second Spectrum tracking. That\u2019s the second lowest opponent mark in the first six seconds. Pressure on the perimeter (like that applied by McCaw and Powell in the plays above) does not stop with transition. In fact, it\u2019s a prominent aspect of the Raptors\u2019 half-court defense. Toronto defenders, both on and off the ball, will push the opponent well beyond the 3-point line, often blowing up the play the offense is trying to run, eating valuable time off the shot clock, or forcing turnovers. Here are four plays from a late-February game in which the champs absolutely suffocated the Indiana Pacers: Play 1. Kyle Lowry switches an off-ball screen for Doug McDermott and prevents a pass from T.J. McConnell (it helps that Domantas Sabonis isn\u2019t in position for the second screen). McDermott eventually cuts through and OG Anunoby denies a pass back to Sabonis, forcing McConnell to pick up his dribble. Fred VanVleet denies an easy pass to Malcolm Brogdon and McConnell finally finds McDermott in the corner. But Lowry pushes up on McDermott and draws an offensive foul when McDermott tries to drive by. Number to know: Lowry ranks second in the league with 0.58 charges drawn per game . Play 2. When Myles Turner catches the ball at the top of the floor, Anunoby immediately denies the swing pass to T.J. Warren. Anunoby then switches a Warren screen for Aaron Holiday and denies him . Turner plays catch with Warren and Ibaka forces him into a tough shot. Alas, the biggest issue with the Raptors\u2019 defense is rebounding, and Turner taps the ball back out, leading to a corner 3-pointer for Justin Holiday. Number to know: 33% of the Raptors\u2019 opponents\u2019 3-point attempts, the league\u2019s highest rate, have come from the corners. They\u2019ve allowed a league-high 4.6 corner 3-pointers per game. Play 3. VanVleet seamlessly switches a Brogdon-Warren exchange on the left side of the floor and denies the dribble-handoff from Sabonis. Warren cuts through and Brogdon comes back to the ball, but Anunoby springs forward to intercept Sabonis\u2019 pass. Number to know: The Raptors have seen the league\u2019s third biggest jump in opponent turnover rate, from 14.7 per 100 possessions ( ninth ) last season to 16.6 ( second ) this season. Play 4. VanVleet will not allow Aaron Holiday to get the ball from Sabonis. So Brogdon again comes back to the ball and Sabonis takes Ibaka into the post. Anunoby leaves the weak-side corner to help Lowry as Warren dives to the rim and, when Sabonis throws a strong pass to Holiday in the left corner, Lowry rotates out to run the shooter off the line, forcing a travel. Number to know: The Pacers\u2019 81 points on 103 possessions in this Feb. 23 game account for the second least efficient offensive game for any team this season. The Raptors\u2019 defense is also responsible for the third least efficient game (the Bulls\u2019 84 points on 106 possessions on Oct. 26). VanVleet is a pest defensively, whether he\u2019s guarding the ball or not. In fact, he may be the most aggressive \u201cpinch\u201d defender in the league, leaving his man one pass away to put extra pressure on a ball-handler coming in his direction. It\u2019s a gamble ( here\u2019s an example of a VanVleet pinch leading to an open 3-pointer for the opponent), but it often pays off. Here\u2019s a few plays where VanVleet gets disruptive: Play 1. Anunoby chases Aaron Holiday over two off-ball screens on the left side of the floor. After Brogdon makes the pass, VanVleet leaves Brogdon to knock the ball out of Holiday\u2019s hands. Number to know: VanVleet leads the league with 4.2 deflections per game . Play 2. Anunoby switches a Warren\/Sabonis pick-and-roll and pressures Warren out to the logo. Warren gets by Anunoby, but both VanVleet and Siakam leave strong-side shooters and they come up with another steal that leads to a fast break. Number to know: VanVleet ranks fourth in steals per game (1.9). Play 3. Eric Bledsoe sets a pin-down screen for Giannis Antetokounmpo to catch the ball at the nail (the middle of the foul line). VanVleet again leaves the passer and gets his hand on the ball as Antetokounmpo goes to his spin move. Number to know: 52.5% of Toronto opponent turnovers have been live balls (Raptor steals). That\u2019s the 17th highest opponent rate, just a tick below the league average (52.7%). There\u2019s been an increase in zone defense this season. And no team has seen a bigger increase than the Raptors, who have played 438 possessions of zone, second most in the league, according to Synergy play-type tracking. Toronto zones (they come in different forms) feature more pressure. Here\u2019s the Raptors in a 3-2 zone in Sacramento, with the three high defenders extended to and beyond the 3-point line.  Here are a few more examples of the Raptors in zone: Play 1. The Raptors are in a janky box-and-one defense, with Terence Davis guarding Caris LeVert and the other four defenders in a zone. Lowry pressures Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot\u2019s catch well beyond the 3-point line and Davis denies the handoff back to LeVert at the logo. DeAndre Jordan is the escape valve, but, with Davis continuing to deny, he can\u2019t get the ball back to LeVert either. Garrett Temple is open in the opposite corner, but Siakam rotates from under the basket and runs him off the 3-point line. Hollis-Jefferson rotates from the right baseline to stop the drive and Lowry rotates down to the right corner on the kick out to Wilson Chandler. Chandler swings the ball back to TLC at the right wing and McCaw rotates from under the basket to contest the 3-point attempt. Number to know: The 0.945 points per possession the Raptors\u2019 zone defense has allowed ranks fourth among the 19 teams have played at least 100 possessions of zone. Play 2. After their first made basket in their Feb. 25 game against the Bucks, the Raptors go to a 3-2 zone. The Bucks aren\u2019t quite ready for it and the ball is eventually swung to Wesley Matthews. VanVleet is in his shirt and deflects the ball off Matthews\u2019 leg. Number to know: The Raptors have forced turnovers on 12.6% of their zone possessions, the fifth highest rate among the 19 teams have played at least 100 possessions of zone. Play 3. In a 3-2 zone against the Kings, Lowry\u2019s off-ball pressure forces Buddy Hield to catch the ball well beyond the arc. Alex Len comes up for a ball-screen and Ibaka ventures up from his baseline position to prevent Hield from walking into a 3-pointer, while Siakam sinks to tag Len\u2019s roll to the rim. That leaves De\u2019Aaron Fox wide-open on the weak side and what\u2019s missing here is the next rotation from Powell. Fortunately for him, Fox misses the 3-pointer. Number to know: Toronto opponents have taken 43.5% of their shots from 3-point range. That\u2019s the league\u2019s second highest opponent rate, lower than only that of the Miami Heat (43.7%). Play 4. Two possessions later, Nemanja Bjelica cleverly slips a pick-and-roll into the middle of the zone. But before he can get to the basket, Ibaka is there. Lowry rotates down to the baseline, forcing Harry Giles to put the ball on the floor and allowing Ibaka to recover and block Giles\u2019 shot. Number to know: The Raptors are one of four teams \u2013 the Nets, Clippers and Bucks are the others \u2013 that rank in the top 10 in both opponent field goal percentage in the restricted area (58.9%, third) and the (lowest) percentage of their opponents\u2019 shots that have come in the restricted area (30.1%, eighth). A lot of teams in the league are uncomfortable \u201cin rotation\u201d defensively, where they\u2019re continually chasing the ball and, eventually, allowing an open shot. So they won\u2019t send extra defenders to whatever the offense is running. Pick-and-rolls are the responsibility of the two guys involved in the action. The Raptors are not one of those teams. There was a possession early in the season where Marc Gasol was guarding an Andre Drummond post-up, a situation seemingly calling for the other four defenders to stay at home. But when Bruce Brown cut through the paint, Anunoby left him and doubled Drummond, trusting the three teammates behind him to account for the four other Pistons.  When Drummond tried to get rid of the ball, Gasol took it away. The Raptors aren\u2019t just comfortable in rotation, that\u2019s when they\u2019re at their best, making the ball move, making offenses uncomfortable , forcing turnovers, and contesting the shots that were seemingly open when the last pass was made. \u201cYou only really want to be in rotation,\u201d Nurse said earlier this season, \u201cif you\u2019ve taken something else they really want away, if you\u2019re prioritizing what you\u2019re willing to live with. You got to be willing to give up something to take away things. If you\u2019ve taken away your priority things and it puts you in rotation, you got to go from there.\u201d The Raptors \u201cgo from there\u201d a lot. But they\u2019re the best in the league at plugging leaks, thanks to their cohesion, communication, effort and collective acumen. Rotations can take you out of rebounding position, and the weak spot of the Raptors\u2019 second-ranked defense is on the glass. They rank 25th in defensive rebounding percentage , having grabbed just 71.5% of available defensive boards. If you were to take away opponent second chance points to calculate defensive efficiency on initial possessions, the difference between the Bucks\u2019 (91.0 points allowed per 100 possessions) and the Raptors\u2019 (91.2) defenses would be much smaller than when you do count second chance points (101.6 vs. 104.9). No defense can take everything away. The Bucks have had the league\u2019s No. 1 defense each of the last two seasons, protecting the rim much better than any other team in the league . Last season, they set an NBA record for 3-pointers allowed (1,073) and this season, they were on pace to break it. The Raptors don\u2019t protect the rim like the Bucks, but they\u2019re the only team that ranks in the top five in both opponent field goal percentage in the paint (52.7%, second) and opponent effective field goal percentage on shots from outside the paint (48.2%, third). They also rank second in opponent turnover percentage . You can\u2019t take it all away, but no defense comes closer than that of the defending champs. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

Johnson is working with MBE Capital Partners to offer the loans to those hurt by COVID-19 stay-at-home orders. The loans were funded through Johnson\u2019s EquiTrust Life Insurance Company, of which he is a majority owner, through the Small Business Administration\u2019s Paycheck Protection Program. \u201cThis will allow them to keep their employees and keep their doors open,\u201d Johnson told CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk Box\u201d on Tuesday. News of the program was first reported by The Wall Street Journal . \u201cJohnson\u2019s EquiTrust is providing critical financial support to underserved communities and businesses that have been traditionally neglected,\u201d EquiTrust and MBE Capital Partners said in a joint news release. \u201cThese small and diverse businesses often have difficulty developing strong lending relationships with big banks.\u201d \u201cThese are incredible businesses, small businesses, that have been the pillar of our community that also employ a lot of black and brown people in our community,\u201d Johnson said Sunday on MSNBC . \u201c\u2026 We wanted to make sure that minority-owned businesses got small business loans through the PPP program.\u201d As part of the $2 trillion stimulus package in April, Congress set aside $349 billion in the PPP fund but the money depleted quickly forcing another round of aid. The new funds include $60 billion set aside for small businesses. In an interview with CNBC on Tuesday, Johnson cited the need to keep African-American and Latino-owned businesses in communities viable during the pandemic. \u201cWe have to remember that these businesses have been in urban communities for a long time,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been doing great things, and they probably didn\u2019t have a relationship with the banks when the stimulus package went out. So now, we\u2019re able to say, \u2018Hey, you can have a relationship with us.\u2019\u201d \u201cFinancially, this has really hurt our community as well as health-wise it\u2019s hurt our community, too,\u201d Johnson added. Rafael Martinez, CEO of MBE, told MSNBC\u2019s Jabari Young that the funds would look to help 100,000 businesses in urban communities. Applicants to the program are vetted via SBA guidelines and the application process has been simplified to make the loans easier to acquire. A Hall of Famer who helped the Lakers to five NBA titles in the 1980s, the 60-year-old Johnson has regularly established businesses since retiring. He told CNBC he was surprised the Lakers applied for (and received) a $4.6 million SBA loan, money the team has since returned. \u201cThey did the right thing,\u201d he said. \u201d[Lakers owner] Jeanie Buss is a very good owner, and she\u2019s smart, so I\u2019m glad that she returned the money because there is a lot of companies out here who really need that money and she was smart enough to understand that.\u201d When asked about the NBA and other pro sports returning to action, Johnson supported a safe restart with \u201cempty stadiums.\u201d \u201cWe need it,\u201d Johnson said on CNBC. \u201cWe thrive on our sports. That\u2019s how we escape our everyday life \u2014 is to indulge ourselves in sports.

The Los Angeles Lakers star, speaking on the Uninterrupted platform\u2019s \u201cWRTS: After Party\u201d show that was released Monday, said it remains his wish that the season comes back \u201csooner than later.\u201d The NBA suspended the season on March 11 because of the coronavirus pandemic, and two unidentified members of the Lakers were among the league\u2019s players who subsequently tested positive for the virus. \u201cDefinitely not giving up on the season,\u201d James said. \u201cNot only myself and my teammates, the Lakers organization, we want to play. There\u2019s a lot of players that I know personally that want to play. And obviously, we don\u2019t ever want to jeopardize the health of any of our players or any of the players\u2019 families and so on and so on. \u201cThis is a pandemic that we have no idea (about). We can\u2019t control it,\u201d James added. James was among a group of some of the league\u2019s highest-paid players, National Basketball Players Association president Chris Paul of the Oklahoma City Thunder also part of the group, who met last week to talk about the season. Those players affirmed to one another on that call that they would like to see the season resume. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver told players\u2019 union members on May 8 that he was hoping to make some sort of decision about the future of the season within no more than a four-week window . By that timeframe \u2014 barring any adjustments based on what\u2019s happening with the pandemic \u2014 Silver and the NBA would be hoping to decide upon some course of action by June 5. That said, there has been no definitive timetable from the NBA on when a decision would be made. The league is prepping for many options. As of Monday, just over half of the league\u2019s 30 franchises had reopened their practice facilities for voluntary workouts. But other sports are showing promising signs, with NASCAR restarting its season this past weekend, baseball working through some plans that could lead to a summer opening day, and live golf returning to television Sunday. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot of sporting events, UFC, soccer, we\u2019re hearing baseball\u2019s about to get going in a little bit,\u201d James said. \u201cYou know, I want to get back to playing. I love to play the game of basketball. I know how inspiring the game of basketball is. I know how inspiring sport is, itself. As soon as possible, when we can get back out there, we\u2019d love to bring the game of basketball back to our fans.\u201d James and the Lakers were atop the Western Conference standings when the NBA suspended play. At 49-14, the NBA\u2019s second-best record behind Milwaukee, the Lakers had already clinched what would be their first playoff spot since 2013. \u201cI know we all miss it,\u201d James said. \u201cI\u2019d be sitting here lying if I said we don\u2019t.\u201d"},{"id":27725,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/bojan-bogdanovic-out-rest-season","date":"2020-05-19","title":"Jazz forward Bojan Bogdanovic (wrist) out for season","content":" The Utah Jazz announced on Tuesday that second-leading scorer Bojan Bogdanovic will be out for the season after successful surgery on his right wrist. ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski first reported the news on Monday that Bogdanovic needed surgery on his right wrist to repair an injury he suffered in January. During the season\u2019s hiatus \u2014 which began in mid-March \u2014 Bogdanovic began to experience discomfort from the injury, Wojnarowski reported. His injury, per the team, is a ruptured scapholunate ligament in his right wrist. The team did not confirm the January timeline, rather saying his injury occurred \u201csometime in 2019\u201d and that it continued to bother Bogdanovic throughout the 2019-20 season. Bogdanovic will not come back for any of the 2019-20 season or playoffs if either does resume, according to the Jazz. Shortly after news of Bogdanovic\u2019s injury appeared on Twitter, Jazz All-Star guard Donovan Mitchell tweeted: \u201cSalute to my brother [Bojan] for fighting through for us all year \u2026 one of the toughest dudes I know.

He was fried and needed that baseball break. But stringing together four in a row by coming back in 1998-99?  That should have happened. At least, that group should have had the chance. We got a glimpse of what might have been late in Episode 10 when Phil Jackson talked about Bulls chairman Jerry Reinsdorf asking him back. But we also saw Reinsdorf \u2014 as Jordan watched it on the tablet handed to him by the film crew \u2014 carping about what he might have had to pay the many free agents on that team. Jordan spoke for a lot of Chicagoans and NBA fans when he made clear he, and most likely all those other valuable teammates, would have revved up for one more dance on one-year deals. \u201cI felt like we could have won seven,\u201d Jordan said, calling it \u201cmaddening\u201d that he had to leave at (or near) his peak. \u201cWe may not have. But man, not to be able to try \u2026 that\u2019s something I cannot accept.\u201d It would have been tricky, and far from guaranteed. The 1998-99 season actually got truncated to just the \u201c1999 season\u201d when a labor lockout lasted into January before the balls bounced. The regular season got whacked to just 50 games, an advantage for an older team like the Bulls. The disadvantage was that, sometime during the extended layoff, Jordan cut a finger on his right hand with a cigar cutter. It was an injury that prevented him from palming the ball and reportedly needed surgery, with a two-month rehab. Would that have left enough time for the Bulls to pull it together? Could Chicago have beaten the New York Knicks and the San Antonio Spurs, the two Finals teams that season? Heck, they might have been stymied by Miami or Indiana in the East bracket. But they had earned the right, and the rest of the league deserved, to have that dynasty end on the court. Not in Jerry Krause\u2019s head. Rumors about foul room service, specifically a delivered pizza, sprang up in real time on the night of Jordan\u2019s \u201cflu game,\u201d Game 5 of the 1997 Finals. The Bulls had spent that week in Park City, a ski town outside of Salt Lake City, so limited late-night food options sounded plausible. Jordan and trainer Tim Grover, among others, confirmed Sunday that it was a pizza that only Jordan ate. Hey, at least it wasn\u2019t Monty Python\u2019s killer salmon mousse. \u201cThe flu game\u201d did slip into NBA lore more nicely than something called \u201cthe food poisoning game.\u201d For those among us who have had both \u2014 I had a bout of food poisoning in Salt Lake City a few years later, coincidentally \u2014 many would point to the gastrointestinal disorder as the greater ill. But what was up with five delivery guys showing up to Jordan\u2019s room? And what could they conceivably have put on his pizza that would have been nasty enough to make him sick but not so extreme as to trigger criminal charges? Does the joint Jordan called even exist now? Maybe it was just some bad pepperoni. But all those questions get answered if it happens in 2020. We got some new voices Sunday night, with John Stockton and Reggie Miller taking big roles as storytellers. Larry Bird had a couple of moments too, the best coming in candid footage of his profane exchange with Jordan after Game 7 of the 1998 East finals. We also got cameos from Jordan\u2019s three oldest children, Jeffrey, Marcus and Jasmine, providing the only glimmer of his family then or now in the series. Their mother Juanita, to whom Jordan was married from 1986-2006, never made an appearance. Nor did his current wife Yvette, with whom he has two young twin daughters. The director, Jason Hehir, has said he felt there are plenty of voices in the doc. Their absence does feel a little conspicuous, though. So, for that matter, does the topic of other female attention that came Jordan\u2019s way in his rise to prominence. We got gambling, we saw drinking and smoking, Jordan talked briefly of vices embraced by teammates when he first got to the Bulls \u2026 and that was it. We never got much Charles Barkley, for a rival\/friend who shared Jordan\u2019s era. We heard more from bench guys on those six title teams \u2014 Jud Buechler last week, plenty of Steve Kerr Sunday \u2014 but nothing from starter Luc Longley and precious little across 10 parts from Ron Harper. By the way, hearing Isiah Thomas as a game analyst throughout stood in contrast to the long minutes spent on his and Jordan\u2019s dislike over Pistons and Dream Team snubs. Every time we heard Thomas (working alongside Bob Costas on NBC broadcasts) talk about Jordan, he never let any resentment or envy bleed into his work. Karl Malone didn\u2019t sit down for the filmmakers, apparently. But the clip of Malone on the Bulls\u2019 bus after Game 6 in \u201998, another heartbreaking loss for him, to congratulate the winners oozed class. And of course, we didn\u2019t get much closure on Krause, the effective but irritating GM who undermined his own masterful moves with his unpleasant style. Krause died in 2017 and couldn\u2019t speak for himself. But Scottie Pippen\u2019s praise of Krause so late in the final chapter was jarring, playing like some sort of \u201cwell, we\u2019d better\u201d edit. And it was spectacular. Other episodes were charged with whole seasons or several years of Jordan\u2019s playing career with Chicago. But the last two took the time to drill down first into the Bulls\u2019 near-loss to the Indiana Pacers in the East, then the rematch with the Jazz in the \u201998 Finals. There was a real sense of dread for Bulls fans that their heroes might indeed see their dynasty end on the court, given how well Indiana matched up with them that spring. We even got to see footage of a pivotal jump ball in the clincher vs. the Pacers, with Jordan and Rik Smits grabbing for the ball \u2014 while Jordan\u2019s foot steps on the endline (no call). The severity of Pippen\u2019s aching back in Game 6 of The Finals got fully flushed out, making it clear this was no \u201cmigraine game\u201d or \u201c1.8 seconds gaffe\u201d for him. He had gutted through his own version of the, ahem, pizza game. Moments like Jordan anticipating the Jazz\u2019s defensive help and making sure Kerr was ready for his pass are the reasons we love the game itself. Same with his breakdown of Bryon Russell in \u201997, foreshadowing their climactic moment a year later. We didn\u2019t see the dispute in the final Jazz game about Howard Eisley\u2019s 3-pointer right before halftime that, by ref decree, came late and cost Utah some cushion. But seeing Jordan\u2019s skill, cunning and knack for seizing the moment in the final minute that night \u2014 culminating in his famously held follow-through on the winning shot \u2014 was nostalgic and instructional all at once. After five consecutive Sundays and 10 hours of our lives, it\u2019s funny to think that most of us would welcome another five, another 10. The documentary reminded many of us why Jordan rose so high and loomed so large over the NBA, over sports, over American culture. For others, especially those younger, it was as thorough as any online course they\u2019ve been taking lately. The debate over Jordan\u2019s status as the greatest of all time wasn\u2019t addressed in the series, nor was it answered for a lot of basketball fans. You can toss out five, six, seven names of legendary NBA players \u2014 you know the usual suspects \u2014 and build persuasive cases why each could lay claim to that GOAT title. What Jordan did have going for him that those who have come since, such as Kobe Bryant and LeBron James, haven\u2019t is his originality. He laid down the Air Jordan footprints that they later followed. From his breathtaking basketball exploits to his immense crossover appeal, from the baggy shorts and shaved head to his meticulously planned attire and heady financial success off the floor, he led where the others have followed. When their documentary projects come out, it will be the same, all over again. No one has scored like Jordan and won like him and played both ends like him and looked so graceful and powerful while doing it quite like him. The NBA had marquee stars before him \u2014 George Mikan, Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, Elgin Baylor, Jerry West, Oscar Robertson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Julius Erving, Larry Bird and Magic Johnson \u2014 but none of them transcended the game and opened up the world to the NBA and the sport like Jordan. Since then, we\u2019ve seen players sporting his No. 23, wearing two jersey numbers, sobbing over the Larry O\u2019Brien trophy and targeting the same basketball and business success Jordan staked out. But they\u2019ve had someone to emulate. Jordan just went about being himself. He had a Marques Johnson poster on his dorm wall at UNC, but he invented his own above-the-rim game. And impact. Then he added experience, aggressive leadership and the manic desire to win, at all times and at most costs. \u201cMichael Jordan gave me a dream,\u201d James once said. \u201cHe was like my superhero growing up.\u201d These days the cape is off. Jordan is a billionaire, the owner of the Charlotte Hornets and something of a recluse, at least compared to his so-very-public persona of his playing days. He participated in pulling the curtain back for the series, and our image of him is more fleshed out now. But those late shots Sunday of him sitting in silhouette, not walking in the surf and sand but gazing out from inside his south Florida mansion, left plenty of Jordan story untold. That\u2019s rare these days, too. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

The reports by the Los Angeles County coroner\u2019s office provide a clinical but unvarnished look at just how brutal the crash was, describing broken bones, dismembered body parts and a stench of fuel on what remained of clothing that burned. One of the most popular sports figures in Los Angeles and a celebrity around the globe, Bryant had to be identified by his fingerprints after his body was found in the dirt outside the wreckage of the chopper. The graphic report made it clear: Bryant and the passengers almost certainly were dead in an instant due to blunt trauma. \u201cThese injuries are rapidly if not instantly fatal,\u201d wrote Juan Carrillo, senior deputy medical examiner, in Bryant\u2019s report. The crash that killed the 41-year-old retired Los Angeles Lakers star, his 13-year-old daughter, Gianna \u2014 donning the jersey she would have worn to play that morning, with the word \u201cMamba\u201d on the front and her last name on the back \u2014 pilot Ara Zobayan and the others is considered accidental. Bryant was headed from Orange County to his daughter\u2019s tournament at his Sports Academy in Thousand Oaks on the morning of Jan. 26. The group, including one of his daughter\u2019s coaches and two of her teammates, encountered thick fog in the San Fernando Valley of Los Angeles. Zobayan, an experienced pilot who often flew Bryant, climbed sharply and had nearly succeeded in breaking through the clouds when the craft took an abrupt left turn and plunged into the grassy, oak-studded hills below. When it struck the ground, the helicopter was flying at about 184 mph and descending at a rate of more than 4,000 feet per minute. The impact caused a crater and scattered debris over an area the size of a football field in the Calabasas hills. Flames engulfed the wreckage, but burns on the bodies were determined to have occurred after death. Bryant\u2019s body was found on one side of the wreckage, and his daughter\u2019s was found in a ravine on the opposite side. Although Bryant was unrecognizable, a forensic examination offered reminders of the All-Star who captured the imagination of Lakers fans and who was wearing \u201cmulticolored court shoes\u201d the day he died. The autopsy noted a tattoo of a crown on his right shoulder, above where his wife\u2019s name, Vanessa, was imprinted. On the lower right arm were the names of three of his four daughters: Bianka Bella, Natalia Diamante and Gianna Maria-Onore, the daughter who died with him. The youngest girl, Capri Kobe, only 7 months old when her father died, is not mentioned. The only drug in Bryant\u2019s system was methylphenidate, which is sold under the brand name Ritalin and used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and narcolepsy. The National Transportation Safety Board has not concluded what caused the crash on the outskirts of Los Angeles County but said there was no sign of mechanical failure in the Sikorsky S-76. A final report is not expected for months. The aircraft did not have a device called the terrain awareness and warning system, which signals when an aircraft is in danger of hitting ground. While the NTSB has recommended the system be mandatory for helicopters, the Federal Aviation Administration requires it for only air ambulances. Both of California\u2019s senators have called for the FAA to mandate the devices in the wake of the tragedy. The others killed were Orange Coast College baseball coach John Altobelli, his wife, Keri, and their daughter Alyssa; Christina Mauser, who helped Bryant coach his daughter\u2019s basketball team; and Sarah Chester and her daughter Payton. Alyssa and Payton were Gianna\u2019s teammates. Bryant is the only NBA player to have his team retire two numbers in his honor. He was selected last month for the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. A ceremony is scheduled for late August, though it might be delayed until at least October because of the coronavirus pandemic. Bryant and his daughter were honored at a star-studded public memorial Feb. 24 at Staples Center in downtown Los Angeles, with 20,000 in attendance at the arena where Bryant spent most of his two-decade career with the Lakers. The date 2\/24 corresponded with the No. 24 jersey he wore and the No. 2 worn by Gianna. The same day, Vanessa Bryant filed a lengthy lawsuit alleging that Zobayan was careless and negligent to fly in the fog and should have aborted the flight. She also has filed a claim, a precursor to a lawsuit, against the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department after deputies allegedly shared unauthorized photos of the crash site. Zobayan\u2019s brother, Berge Zobayan, has said in a court filing that Bryant knew the risks of helicopter flying and his survivors aren\u2019t entitled to damages from the pilot\u2019s estate. The helicopter company, Island Express, said it is not responsible for damages, calling the crash, among other things, \u201can act of God\u201d and \u201can unavoidable accident\u201d that was beyond its control."},{"id":27709,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/dwight-howard-coping-death-sons-mother","date":"2020-05-15","title":"Dwight Howard healing after death of son\u2019s mother","content":" LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 The mother of Dwight Howard\u2019s 6-year-old son died nearly six weeks ago due to an epileptic seizure, the Los Angeles Lakers center says. Although Howard has spent the NBA\u2019s hiatus dealing with the difficult task of explaining Melissa Rios\u2019 death to their son, he is also grateful for the chance to heal from the loss without the daily grind of the NBA schedule. \u201cIt\u2019s been one of the toughest things I\u2019ve ever had to deal with,\u201d Howard said. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard, especially during this time. There\u2019s nowhere to go. Usually if things are happening, we have basketball or something to keep our minds going. But a situation like this, it\u2019s a situation that I\u2019ll have to deal with forever because of our child.\u201d Howard spoke Friday about Rios\u2019 death on a video call from his offseason home in Georgia, where he is staying with his children during the coronavirus pandemic. Howard said he had a cordial relationship with Rios, and he was literally texting Rios to invite her to stay with him in Georgia when he learned she had died. \u201cIt was very difficult to handle,\u201d Howard said. \u201cIt was kind of hard to process. It still is. But I did attend the funeral. There was no way that I could not be there for my son, and even for her family. I definitely would have felt like that would have been bad, because she deserves \u2014 he would deserve better if I didn\u2019t do that.\u201d Howard has five children between the ages of 6 and 12, and he is seizing the chance to be a hands-on parent during this unwanted break from his first season back with the Lakers. Howard and his children build bonfires, play card games, work out together and play hide-and-seek on his 23-acre property. \u201cIt\u2019s been bittersweet, because I do want to play basketball, but my son right now needs me more than anything,\u201d Howard said. \u201cIt\u2019s a situation that I would never expect, nobody would ever expect, especially right now, this pandemic. So it\u2019s just kind of given me some more perspectives on life.\u201d Before Rios\u2019 death added a tragic turn, the pandemic had already interrupted an inspiring season for the 34-year-old Howard. The eight-time All-Star selection has improbably become both a valuable reserve for the Western Conference-leading Lakers and a fan favorite at Staples Center, where he was the fans\u2019 most reviled player for the past six years since he initially left the Lakers in 2013. With LeBron James and Anthony Davis leading the way, the Lakers were 49-14 before the pause in their rocky season. They had already persevered through a tumultuous preseason trip to China, followed by franchise icon Kobe Bryant\u2019s death in a helicopter crash. * * *"},{"id":27693,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/detroit-pistons-bruce-brown-thumb-surgery","date":"2020-05-15","title":"Pistons\u2019 Bruce Brown says he had thumb surgery last month","content":" DETROIT (AP) \u2014 Pistons guard Bruce Brown had thumb surgery last month and is ready to play if the NBA season resumes.

But for the banged-up Sixers\u2019 Big Dogs? Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid are coming along just fine from their injuries and should be healthy enough to play if the NBA season resumes \u2014 and end a season Brown expected the Sixers to contend for a championship. \u201cI think this team was built for the playoffs,\u201d Brown said Friday. Brown needs Embiid and Simmons, Philly\u2019s All-Star franchise players, to be in shape and try to salvage a season that saw the Sixers fade from Eastern Conference contenders to just sixth in the standings (39-26) when it stopped March 11 because of the coronavirus pandemic. That made Brown\u2019s job status a hot topic around the NBA and a daily debate in Philly. Brown led the 76ers from the Process \u2014 when the roster was purposefully stripped of real NBA talent to secure better draft picks \u2014 to consecutive 50-win seasons. The Sixers labeled themselves championship contenders this season, only to have a roster of mismatched parts, injuries and an abysmal road record (10-24) push them to the brink of a bust. Brown has had two months to consider what a play-or-stop scenario could mean for his future. \u201cYou\u2019re human, you think about it all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say you think about it to the point where it weights you down. But I get it. I\u2019ve been doing this for a long time. I feel this strongly, as it sits, in my sort of coaching world, this thing is so, for me, incomplete.\u201d The 23-year-old Simmons had missed his eighth straight game and was receiving daily treatment for his nerve issues in his lower back when the season stopped. Embiid was recovering from surgery on his left hand and had just returned after missing five games with a sprained left shoulder at the time of the shutdown. Embiid and Simmons had received permission to rehab at the Sixers practice facility in New Jersey. Simmons, who averaged 16.7 points, 7.8 rebounds and 8.2 assists in 54 games, was hurt in a Feb. 22 game at Milwaukee. \u201cThat was as disturbing a memory as it relates to a player that I can think of,\u201d Brown said. \u201cHe\u2019s lying on his back, he\u2019s vomiting primarily because of pain. Trying to get him back on the plane and build him back up to some level of health where he can play basketball again and with us \u2026 his health obviously ruled the day.\u201d Brown, whose contract runs through 2021-22, said the opportunity for Simmons to rehab and get cleared to play should the season start was a rare positive during the break. Brown also spoke with Embiid for a bit Friday and found the good-natured center determined to get into top physical shape for a potential training camp. Embiid had missed 21 games this season and Brown counted on the big man to play 38 minutes a game in the postseason. \u201cHe\u2019s got a real desire to be at a playing weight that equals his best since he\u2019s been in the league,\u201d Brown said. The Sixers had the best home record in the league at 29-2, the kind of percentage that would naturally make Brown lean toward playing at the Wells Fargo Center, even if meant the arena was empty. \u201cWe were dominant at home,\u201d Brown said. \u201cSomewhere in the middle, I felt like everything was pointing to us landing the plane, getting good health and letting that environment be Judgment Day. I feel very confident, and respectfully, cocky, that we\u2019ve done good work.\u201d The sting of last season\u2019s elimination, when Kawhi Leonard sank the first Game 7-ending buzzer-beater in NBA history to lead Toronto past the 76ers in the East semis, still lingers for the franchise. Al Horford lost his starting job in his first season of a four-year free-agent deal and the Sixers could be headed to a potential playoff matchup with his former team, the Boston Celtics. The break could be just the reset the Sixers needed. \u201cThe mission has been, and will be, we need to hunt for a championship,\u201d Brown said. \u201cIn many ways, I feel like the carpet has been pulled from this team.\u201d * * *"},{"id":27720,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/cleveland-cavaliers-tristan-thompson-wants-season-restart","date":"2020-05-15","title":"Tristan Thompson wants season to restart: 'Guys want to play'","content":" Cavaliers forward Tristan Thompson wants the NBA to have its postseason, even if he and his Cleveland teammates aren\u2019t included in the playoffs. \u201cGuys want to play,\u201d Thompson said Thursday during a Zoom conference call.

While it focuses on the challenges and triumphs of Jordan\u2019s illustrious basketball career, it also delves into personal tragedies, such as the murder of his father, and scandal, such as his public gambling habits. The Associated Press talked with Jasmine Jordan about growing up as his child, his legacy, and what can turn one of the most intimidating players in the history of basketball turn into Silly Putty. The conversation has been edited for brevity and clarity. * * * AP: Everybody\u2019s been going crazy over \u201cThe Last Dance.\u201d What\u2019s been your perspective? Jordan: It\u2019s been incredible to watch. You know, I didn\u2019t get any previews or anything like that, so I\u2019m watching it real time with everyone else and really just taking it in as a fan, essentially. So it\u2019s been really eye opening. I think if you remove the basketball aspect and all the accolades he achieved for obvious reasons, I think I\u2019m definitely learning that my dad was really trying to take in the pressures and the expectations and not allowing it to weigh on him and really manifesting it to his own. \u2026I\u2019ve definitely been seeing him really take on that role and embracing that role and not running from it and really becoming the greatest player to ever play the game. That\u2019s because he always wanted to do that. AP: When you see some of those like emotional moments, do you recognize that person as your dad? Jordan: Some of them, yes. Some of them I do. I know when it comes to the game, his passion is unmatched. His energy\u2019s unmatched. So when he\u2019s going at Steve Kerr or checking Scottie and trying to get that fire and tenacity out of them, I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh, yeah, that\u2019s Dad.\u2019 I mean, he\u2019ll do that to me just so I can get an A out of a test or two. (laughs) And I\u2019m just trying to pass school, I\u2019m not even winning championships. So that is definitely totally him. AP: What type of father was he to you? Jordan: I was definitely a daddy\u2019s girl growing up. And, you know, he still calls me \u2018Princess\u2019 to this day and I\u2019m almost 30. \u2026 He definitely wanted to coddle and protect and nurture and baby me as much as he can. But you also knew the harsh reality of the burden that I was going to have to endure the older I got. So he wanted to make sure I had tough skin. And I understood that, hey, there\u2019s going to be a target on my back. AP: How did your relationship, or did it, change after your dad retired? Jordan: When he was playing, he did his best to be as involved as he could be while I was growing up. He made sure to take me to school when he could or go to my recitals and dance and things like that that I was a part of. So once he retired, it definitely was a change in gears, and it was something that he and I really had a conversation about. It\u2019s like, \u201cOK, you\u2019re done. So how do we work on the relationship? How do we even make it stronger than what it was like?\u201d So we definitely really worked hard and put forth that effort because obviously once you take something you love away from somebody, it\u2019s that hole \u2014 it\u2019s a void. So do you fill it or do you just adjust? He definitely adjusted versus trying to find something else to fill it, and that\u2019s something I appreciated. \u2026 That\u2019s how we\u2019re so close today. AP: What type of grandfather has he been to your son? Jordan: He\u2019s Silly Putty. My son has him wrapped around his fingers already. He\u2019s been very hands on and very involved in my son, even during these crazy times. He FaceTimes everyday or Zoom or something just so that way, that relationship can continue to cultivate and bond and grow. But no, my dad would probably let my son get away with murder at this point. \u2026 It\u2019s an incredible relationship to see them develop. AP: I\u2019m surprised your dad has been this open, just being a fan. So are you surprised at his candor and his openness? Jordan: Absolutely. It\u2019s definitely surprising because my father is very private. He doesn\u2019t like to comment on social matters or he doesn\u2019t like to respond to things when people want him to. He definitely likes to move methodically on his terms and on his time. And then with saying that, seeing the documentary unfold and he\u2019s getting emotional and he\u2019s sharing his insight and perspective, it\u2019s been incredible to really see. And I love it because it gives him that human nature that I think people forget. You know, he is this incredible phenom, and he\u2019s the G.O.A.T., and everything along those lines.

And while there still is no decision about whether the season can resume \u2014 NBA Commissioner Adam Silver, according to a person with knowledge of the situation, has told the league\u2019s players he expects to make that call by mid-June at the latest \u2014 getting back to some semblance of work is generally being considered a positive step. \u201cWe\u2019re kind of just feeling it out, playing it by ear, taking it day by day,\u201d said Toronto assistant coach Brittni Donaldson, who was in the gym with Raptors wing Malcolm Miller when the reigning NBA champions opened their facility again Monday. \u201cHopefully, you know, in a week we can start ramping it up a little more. But to start we\u2019re just keeping it very basic, very simple.\u201d The league has very strict rules about these workouts; no head coaches can be involved, no more than four players can be in the facility at a time \u2014 the Raptors are limiting it to one player \u2014 and intense safety precautions must be taken before, during and after the sessions. When Donaldson was throwing passes to Miller, she did so while wearing a mask and gloves. Heat captain Udonis Haslem was one of Miami\u2019s players to report back to work on Day 1 at their facility, though it wasn\u2019t his top priority. He was sporting a customized mask with the team\u2019s logo earlier Wednesday when he appeared at a food distribution drive that he helped organize near downtown Miami. \u201cThis is first,\u201d Haslem said at the food drive. \u201c This is most important.\u201d Haslem said the workout started well, then he began to fade a bit toward the end. Like most NBA players, he\u2019s been doing individual workouts during the league\u2019s hiatus but said nothing replicates what it takes to get through an on-court workout. Meanwhile, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis let professional leagues know that the Sunshine State is ready to welcome them all if needed. With Orlando often mentioned as a potential centralized site if the NBA resumes play, and it was one of the sites Silver told players late last week that is under consideration, DeSantis said Wednesday that the state is putting a premium on the value of professional sports. \u201cProfessional sports are going to be welcome in Florida,\u201d DeSantis said. \u201cThat may not be the case in every other state in this country, as we\u2019ve seen. And so what I would tell commissioners of leagues is, if you have a team in an area where they just won\u2019t let them operate, we\u2019ll find a place for you here in the state of Florida, because we think it\u2019s important and we know that it can be done safely.\u201d Associated Press Writer Ian Harrison in Toronto contributed."},{"id":27780,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/wilson-nba-partnership-game-ball-official-release","date":"2020-05-13","title":"Wilson to become official game ball of the NBA, WNBA, NBA G League, NBA 2K League and Basketball Africa League","content":"NEW YORK \u2013 The National Basketball Association (NBA) and Wilson Sporting Goods Co. announced a multiyear global partnership today that will make Wilson the official game ball of the NBA, Women\u2019s National Basketball Association (WNBA), NBA G League, NBA 2K League and Basketball Africa League (BAL).

He has the speed of a running back, the body of a defensive lineman, and the quick-thinking brain of a Hall-of-Fame QB. But over his 17-year career, most of James\u2019 teams haven\u2019t played very fast. In his days with Cleveland and Miami, only one of his teams (his last season with the Cavs) ranked in the top 10 in pace, and only one (his first season with the Cavs) ranked in the top 10 in fast break points per game. James himself averaged 5.4 fast break points, second among 503 players who played at least 300 games, over those first 15 seasons. But he never played for a team that ranked in the top five in pace or fast break points until he arrived in Los Angeles. Despite his combination of size, speed and skills, his teams have mostly played slow and deliberate, intentionally so at times. The 2018-19 Lakers played fast, but not very efficiently. They ranked third in the percentage of their shots that came in the first six seconds of the shot clock (19.6%), but 21st in effective field goal percentage on those early-clock shots (58.7%). James himself shot effectively on those shots (63.7%), but the Lakers who ranked first, third and fourth in field goal attempts in the first six seconds of the shot clock \u2014 Kyle Kuzma, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and Josh Hart \u2014 all had marks below the league average (59.7%). Last season\u2019s Lakers ranked 24th in offensive efficiency (points scored per 100 possessions), the lowest ranking for any team James has played for. It was the first time in 11 seasons that any James team ranked outside the top six offensively. This season, the Lakers haven\u2019t played quite as fast. But they\u2019ve been much more efficient, both overall and in transition. They rank fourth in offensive efficiency (112.6 points scored per 100 possessions) and their effective field goal percentage of 64.1% in the first six seconds of the shot clock leads the league. Volume is important, because transition offense is the best offense. For every team in the league, effective field goal percentage is highest in the first six seconds of the shot clock. But when a team employs both James and Anthony Davis, two elite finishers who don\u2019t shoot particularly well from outside the paint, those first six seconds of the shot clock are even more critical. When you watch the Lakers, it\u2019s becomes clear how much they value early offense. They\u2019re relentless in trying to create transition opportunities, and it all starts with the four-time MVP. James ranks third in the league \u2014 behind Russell Westbrook (181) and Giannis Antetokounmpo (164) \u2014 with 136 buckets in the first six seconds of the shot clock, 54 more than any of his teammates. Priority No. 1 for any opposing defense is slowing him down. Here are a few plays highlighting his ability to get to the rim and finish through contact: Play 1. James grabs a rebound in the restricted area with one Sixer behind him and two basically even with him, but coming out of the corners. Those three guys are out of the play and James slices through the other two defenders on the other end of the floor, less than four seconds after he grabbed the rebound. And one. Number to know: According to Second Spectrum, James has shot 67.0% at the rim with a defender there to contest. That\u2019s up from 63.1% last season and the eighth best mark among 49 players (second best among non-centers) with at least 200 contested attempts at the rim. Play 2. When Kuzma grabs the loose ball, James is again in the restricted area, with all five Nets in front of him. But he quickly runs past DeAndre Jordan and into a one-on-one matchup with Wilson Chandler, who can\u2019t stop his spin move. Number to know: Overall, James has shot 68.9% in the restricted area, the 28th best mark among 89 players with at least 200 restricted area attempts and his lowest mark in the last 14 seasons. Play 3. James grabs another rebound inside the restricted area, but again puts Jordan behind him and, this time, only has Caris LeVert between him and the basket. Number to know: 42.6% of James\u2019 shots have come in the restricted area. That\u2019s down only a tick from last season (43.0%) and the sixth highest rate of his 17 seasons in the league. Play 4. This bucket doesn\u2019t take place in the first six seconds of the shot clock, and the Bucks are all back. But Davis is over to set a screen as James (who never stops) enters the frontcourt and the league\u2019s best rim protecting team can\u2019t keep him from getting to the cup. Number to know: James has scored 0.98 points per possession as a pick-and-roll ball-handler, according to Synergy play-type tracking. That\u2019s the ninth best mark among 49 players who have averaged at least five ball-handler possessions per game. His and-one frequency (4.1%) is the highest among the group . James isn\u2019t just looking to run the break himself. While there\u2019s a certain level of ego that comes with being the best player of one\u2019s generation, it doesn\u2019t manifest in James needing to control all aspects of his team\u2019s offense. And if a teammate is running ahead on the break, he\u2019s certainly willing to give up the ball. The Lakers lead the league with 7.8 \u201cpass-ahead\u201d passes per game, according to Second Spectrum tracking. And James leads all individuals with 4.6 per game, 0.9 more than any other player. (James Harden is second with 3.7 per game). Play 1. James is one of three Lakers still in the backcourt paint after JaVale McGee grabs a rebound and gives him the ball. But he spots Danny Green ahead with no Bucks defender in position to guard him. Green walks into an open 3-pointer. Number to know: Green\u2019s 35 3-pointers in the first six seconds of the shot clock are tied for 11th in the league, according to Second Spectrum. Play 2. James stops a Giannis Antetokounmpo drive and quickly passes ahead to Kuzma, who pushes into a 4-on-3 situation for the Lakers and gets an open corner 3-pointer after a pass back from Green. Number to know: Kuzma has an effective field goal percentage of 63.9% in the first six seconds of the shot clock, up from 54.8% last season. Play 3. James grabs a loose ball and gets rid of it before he even takes a step. Khris Middleton stops the break by grabbing James around the waist (ruled a clear-path foul). Number to know: James has drawn 5.1 fouls per game, his lowest rate in the 15 seasons for which we have the stat. Play 4. Just a ridiculous pass from the dotted circle in the paint to a catch-and-shoot 3-pointer on the other end of the floor. Number to know: James ranks second in the league with 219 assists on 3-pointers, two fewer than Ben Simmons. James isn\u2019t the Lakers\u2019 only unstoppable force on the break. Davis is another beast in the open floor, and his zeal for running the floor is a problem for opposing bigs. Play 1. Davis grabs the rebound and goes coast to coast. It helps that the only Pelicans on the floor with any size are Brandon Ingram, who gambles for a steal instead of getting in front of Davis, and Nicolo Melli, who is less than swift in getting back on defense. Number to know: Davis has scored 1.35 points per possession in transition, the fourth best mark among 101 players who have averaged at least two transition possessions per game. Play 2. After a make, Alex Caruso pushes the ball up the floor and Davis establishes position in the paint against the helpless Josh Hart. For some reason, Pelicans center Jahlil Okafor decides to join two teammates in stopping the ball, rather than running all the way back to help his smaller teammate against the 6-foot-10 Davis. Number to know: Davis has an effective field goal percentage of 71.6% in the first six seconds of the shot clock (highest among 71 players with at least 100 field goal attempts in the first six seconds) and 51.7% thereafter, according to Second Spectrum. Among those 71 players, only Pascal Siakam (67.4%, 47.4%) has a bigger differential. Play 3. When Davis contests a shot on the perimeter \u2014 which, because the Lakers switch a lot, he\u2019ll often do \u2014 he has license to leak out. Here, Dwight Howard\u2019s pass is a little behind him, but not enough for the Nuggets to catch up. Number to know: Davis has contested 4.7 3-pointers per game, second most in the league . Play 4. Davis isn\u2019t as quick to run the floor after contesting this Middleton shot, but Green encourages him to keep going. Middleton chooses to pick up Green on the break, Brook Lopez is thinking differently, and Davis runs free for a lob from James. Number to know: James\u2019 172 assists to Davis are 42 more assists than any other player has to a single teammate and 30 more assists than James has had to a single teammate in any of his 16 prior seasons. Play 5. Davis sprints ahead of Antetokounmpo on the break. Their legs get tangled and Davis hits the floor, but the threat of him in the paint takes the attention of two Milwaukee defenders, leaving the lane open for a Kuzma drive around Pat Connaughton\u2019s close-out. Number to know: The Lakers have scored 112.7 points per 100 possessions in 1,317 minutes with James and Davis on the floor together, but just 105.7 in 572 minutes with Davis on the floor without James. Running is a habit, and the Lakers have developed it over the season. Whether they\u2019re retrieving a loose ball, grabbing a rebound, or inbounding after an opponent\u2019s bucket, they are looking to get into their offense early. Whether you\u2019re talking about transition offense or defense, the first few steps are critical. Play 1. James retrieves a loose-ball in the deep corner, gets the ball to JaVale McGee, and immediately starts to sprint up the floor, quickly putting two Nuggets in his rearview mirror. Two other Nuggets try to stop the ball and Davis has himself another lob finish. Number to know: Of James\u2019 172 assists to Davis, 102 (59%) have been on buckets in the restricted area. Play 2. James rebounds Davis\u2019 block and is again in an immediate sprint up the floor, creating an open, catch-and-shoot 3-pointer for Green. Number to know: 24.8% of Green\u2019s points have been fast break points. That\u2019s the highest rate of his career and the fifth highest rate among 265 players who have scored at least 300 total points. Caldwell-Pope has the sixth highest rate ( 24.5% ) Play 3. McGee grabs the loose ball and the center (who averages 0.39 dribbles per touch, 272nd among 294 players with at least 1,000 touches ) immediately puts the ball on the floor. He (wisely) gets the ball to Green and keeps running, putting the Bucks in scramble mode. That leads to Davis blowing by a Robin Lopez close-out and getting an and-one bucket. Number to know: The Lakers have averaged 23.2 fast break points per 48 minutes with McGee on the floor. That\u2019s the highest on-court mark on the team . Play 4. This one is even more awkward than McGee leading the break. Both James and Howard get caught in the air and have to pass the ball backward. But just getting up the floor quickly leads to another mismatch, and James drives past Brook Lopez for a ferocious finish. Number to know: Davis (13.0) and James (12.9) rank eighth and ninth in points in the paint per game among 350 players who have played at least 30 games. They\u2019re the only pair of teammates (or former teammates) in the top 25 that have played at least 1,000 minutes together. The Lakers have been relatively good in late-clock situations. They\u2019re the only team with an effective field goal percentage better than 50% in the last six seconds of the shot clock. But there\u2019s a big difference between their mark 50.4% in the last six seconds and their mark of 64.1% in the first six seconds. Only the Sixers (63.7%, 51.2%) and Warriors (60.3%, 47.9%) have a bigger differential between their effective field goal percentage in the first six seconds of the shot clock and their effective field goal percentage thereafter. With 28.5% of their points, the league\u2019s highest rate, coming via fast break points (16.8%, second highest rate ) or second chance points (11.8%, 12th highest), you could argue that no offense depends on scrambled defenders more than that of the Lakers. They\u2019re 6-8 when their total of fast break points and second chance points is fewer than 28. The difference between their field goal percentage in the paint (61.0%, first) and their effective field goal percentage on shots from outside the paint (48.7%, 25th) is also the biggest in the league by a wide margin. Among 183 players with at least 200 field goal attempts from outside the paint, James (47.2%) and Davis (43.3%) rank 143rd and 172nd, respectively, in effective field goal percentage on those shots from the outside. Slow them down in transition and keep them out of the paint and you\u2019ve gone a long way in getting a stop against the Lakers. Alas, that\u2019s much easier said than done. This team is relentless in its pursuit of early offense, and those first six seconds of possession may be what determines the next NBA champion. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

The poll conducted by the National Basketball Players Association was informal but gave a clear sense that players would like to not only get to the playoffs but also resume at least some of the regular season, according to the person who shared details with The Associated Press on Tuesday on condition of anonymity because it was not to be detailed publicly. The exact results of the poll were unknown, and the methodology behind the poll \u2014 including how many players participated \u2014 was unclear. The NBPA sent a letter to agents Tuesday discussing, among other things, the results of the player polling and some details of the call the union and its membership had late last week with NBA Commissioner Adam Silver. In that call, Silver talked about the possibility of resuming a season without fans and potentially playing at a centralized site \u2014 notions that have been discussed for some time. The NBA suspended its season on March 11 with 259 regular season games remaining. Players have been paid in full on each of the four paydays that have followed, though that will change Friday when most of the league sees a 25% reduction in their paycheck. Players stand to lose roughly $850 million in gross salary if the regular season is not resumed and the NBA exercises its right to withhold roughly 1.08% of each player\u2019s salary for any game that is ultimately canceled. No games have been officially canceled yet; the 25% reduction starting with Friday\u2019s check was negotiated between the league and the union with the expectation that the season will eventually be shortened.

Basketball is his world. The COVID-19 pandemic has deprived Nance of his greatest passion and his profession, which is why the Cleveland Cavaliers forward was grateful to get back on a real court \u2014 even for a short while. Nance is one of the few NBA players who have been able to work out after teams were granted permission to reopen their training facilities, which have been closed nearly two months by a virus outbreak that has paused the season and placed its conclusion in peril. Nance returned to the Cavs\u2019 complex on Friday, and for two hours, the 27-year-old felt whole again. \u201cThis is the longest I haven\u2019t played a game of basketball in my entire life,\u201d he said Tuesday on a Zoom conference call . The Cavs and Portland Trail Blazers were the first teams to reopen their facilities last week for structured, voluntary workouts that are restricted to one player and one coach at each basket. More teams are scheduled to hold workouts this week as more states loosen guidelines that have brought team sports in North America to a standstill. Nance, who acknowledged getting a coronavirus test out of \u201cpanic\u201d in March, said that while the conditions are somewhat surreal for practicing, he felt secure because of masks \u2014 and other safety measures. \u201cFor me that just provides a sense of security,\u201d he said of the facial coverings. \u201cYou get your own two basketballs \u2014 that\u2019s it. You have your one coach wearing masks and gloves that are unique to you. Even in the weight room, you pick up a weight, and if I was using 45s [pounds], nobody else that day was allowed to use the 45s until they were cleaned and sterilized, so to me it was so well regimented that I feel pretty safe going.\u201d Last week, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver spoke with players and presented some plans the league is considering to complete the season. Some of the options include games without fans and games at a centralized location, with Florida among possibilities. Nance said he\u2019s cautiously optimistic about a resumption. And while the Cavs aren\u2019t chasing a title \u2014 they were 19-46 when the season was shut down \u2014 he feels it\u2019s imperative the league crowns a champion. \u201cWe\u2019re not in position to win a championship this year but if I was, if I was Giannis [Antetokounmpo], if I was LeBron [James], if I was Kawhi [Leonard], if I was on one of those championship caliber teams, I\u2019d be pretty upset about it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very rare in this league that a chance like this comes along that\u2019s taken a valuable year off someone\u2019s career. \u201cEverybody in the league, we want to finish this year. One, obviously because we love the game, but at the same time there\u2019s a serious chance of us missing out on, what, 20-plus percent of our contracts, which is for a lot of guys pretty significant.\u201d Like many sports fans, Nance has spent part of his quarantine watching \u201cThe Last Dance,\u201d the 10-part ESPN documentary on Michael Jordan and his final season with the Chicago Bulls. Nance has a unique perspective since his father, Larry Sr., played against Jordan for many years. The episodes have turned into weeklong one-on-one battles between the Nances. \u201cOur whole debate while watching the show is just new versus old,\u201d Nance said. \u201cWhy Michael could have scored more in today\u2019s NBA, but also why LeBron would have been so dominant in that league. And while it\u2019s been about M.J., we\u2019ve been comparing, contrasting eras and players.

Bryant, his 13-year-old daughter Gianna, and seven others were killed as they flew to a basketball tournament Jan. 26 at the Mamba Sports Academy when the chopper crashed in thick fog northwest of Los Angeles. The Thousand Oaks-based facility announced Tuesday it would return to its original name of Sports Academy and retire the \u201cMamba\u201d name to the rafters. The academy was founded in 2016; Bryant, who spent 20 seasons with the Los Angeles Lakers and helped the franchise win five NBA championships, joined in 2018. Games were being played at the academy when the news broke of Bryant\u2019s death. Players immediately stopped and many people in the gym burst into tears when told that Bryant was aboard the helicopter that crashed. The academy is under consideration as a home base for the G League\u2019s new select program, which is scheduled to begin in the fall. The program will serve as a one-year prepping, both on and off the court, for certain elite players who chose to bypass college but are not yet eligible for the NBA draft. Bryant is the only NBA player to have his team retire two numbers in his honor. He was selected last month for enshrinement into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, a ceremony that is still scheduled for late August though may be delayed until at least October because of the coronavirus pandemic. He was chosen in his first year of eligibility, along with fellow longtime NBA greats Tim Duncan and Kevin Garnett. Bryant\u2019s production company, Granity Studios, has remained active since his death. The latest children\u2019s book released by Bryant\u2019s company last month \u2014 \u201cThe Wizenard Series: Season One\u201d \u2014 became his fifth book to reach No. 1 on The New York Times\u2019 best-seller lists.

Also killed  were pilot Ara Zobayan, Orange Coast College baseball coach John Altobelli, his wife, Keri, and their daughter Alyssa; Christina Mauser, who helped Bryant coach the girls\u2019 basketball team; and Sarah Chester and her daughter Payton. Alyssa and Payton were Gianna\u2019s teammates.

She claimed Zobayan failed \u201cto use ordinary care in piloting the subject aircraft\u201d and negligence. Vanessa Bryant also last week filed a claim, a precursor to a lawsuit, against the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department after deputies allegedly shared unauthorized photos of the crash site.

The latter of those broadcasts includes commentary from Pascal Siakam and Fred VanVleet. 6 p.m. ET: This Day in History: Blazers at Suns, May 11, 1992  On their way to the 1992 Finals, the Blazers played the highest scoring game in NBA postseason history, a 153-151, double-overtime thriller in Phoenix in Game 4 of the Western Conference semifinals. Three different players \u2014 Clyde Drexler and Terry Porter for Portland, Kevin Johnson for Phoenix \u2014 registered at least 30 points and 10 assists as Portland took a 3-1 series lead. 9 p.m. ET: Raptors at Sixers, May 20, 2001 (Pop Up Edition) On the same day he graduated from the University of North Carolina, Vince Carter played all 48 minutes of Game 7 of the Eastern Conference semifinals and had the series in his hands in the final seconds. But his left-wing jumper was off the mark. The Sixers eventually reached The Finals, and it would be another 15 years before the Raptors won a best-of-seven series for the first time. The Tuesday schedule includes a couple of Popcast replays from the 2008 playoffs \u2014 Suns-Spurs Game 1 and Cavs-Celtics Game 7 \u2014 at 1 and 3 p.m. ET. 6 p.m. ET:  This Day in History: May 12, 2012  In Game 1 of an Eastern Conference semifinal series that went the distance, Rajon Rondo recorded one of his 10 postseason triple-doubles , scoring 13 points, grabbing 12 rebounds and dishing out 17 assists. The last two of those 17 dimes came on a pair of huge Kevin Garnett buckets as the Celtics came away with a one-point victory. 9 p.m. ET: Pacers at Knicks, June 5, 1994 (Pop Up Edition) Four days after the Knicks choked away Game 5 of the Eastern Conference finals, they were back at Madison Square Garden for Game 7, having saved their season in Indiana. The Knicks trailed by 12 late in the third quarter and by one with less than a minute to go in the fourth. But Patrick Ewing tipped in a John Starks\u2019 miss, Reggie Miller\u2019s shot for the win was off the mark, and the Knicks advanced to The Finals for the first time in 21 years.  6 p.m. ET:  This Day in History: Clippers at Thunder, May 13, 2014 The Chris-Paul-Blake-Griffin Clippers suffered some postseason heartbreak over the years. And Game 5 of the 2014 Western Conference semifinals may have been their most painful loss. With the series tied 2-2 and Game 6 back in L.A., the Clippers led by 13 with less than four minutes to go. But the Thunder finished the game on a 17-3 run, with two brutal Chris Paul turnovers in the final seconds. 9 p.m. ET:  Thunder at Mavs, May 17, 2011 (Pop Up Edition) Game 1 of the Western Conference finals may have been Dirk Nowitzki\u2019s best performance on his way to the 2011 championship. In a game in which Kevin Durant scored 40 points, Nowitzki dropped 48 on the Thunder, making 10 of his first 11 shots and shooting 24-for-24 from the free-throw line. The Thursday schedule includes a couple of big games in 2017 from a few of the league\u2019s best players. At 9 a.m. ET, it\u2019s Rockets-Spurs, with Kawhi Leonard scoring 39 points and hitting the game-winning 3-pointer in the final minute. And at 11 a.m., its Thunder-Warriors, with Kevin Durant scoring 40 points on 13-for-16 shooting in his second game against his old team. 6 p.m. ET:  This Day in History: Celtics at Rockets, May 14, 1981 Watch Larry Bird win his first NBA championship, scoring 27 points, grabbing 13 rebounds, and dishing out five assists in Game 6 of The Finals against Moses Malone (23 points and 16 boards) and the Rockets. 9 p.m. ET:  Heat at Celtics, June 7, 2012 (Pop Up Edition) On the way to his first championship, LeBron James came up big with the season on the line. After losing Games 3, 4 and 5 of the Eastern Conference finals, the Heat were facing elimination in Boston. But James came up with one of the biggest games of his career, registering 45 points, 15 rebounds and five assists as the Heat forced a Game 7 back in Miami. Friday will feature some of the best games between the Oklahoma City Thunder and Golden State Warriors. At 11 a.m. ET, it\u2019s the Feb. 2016 overtime classic that ended with Stephen Curry\u2019s 37-foot game-winner . 6 p.m. ET:  This Day in History: Spurs at Blazers, May 15, 1990 Both Games 5 and 7 of the Western Conference semifinals series between Portland and San Antonio went to overtime. The Blazers led Game 5 by 14 after the first quarter, but couldn\u2019t put the Spurs away until the second overtime. Clyde Drexler and Terry Porter combined for 73 points for the Blazers, who would eventually reach The Finals. while David Robinson had 27 points and 15 rebounds for San Antonio. 9 p.m. ET: Warriors at Thunder, May 28, 2016 (Pop Up Edition) Before they blew a 3-1 lead, the Warriors came back from a 3-1 deficit, and Game 6 in Oklahoma City was the most critical piece of the comeback. The defending champs trailed by as many as 13 points and they were down eight to start the fourth quarter. But Klay Thompson scored 19 of his 41 points in the final period to send the series to Game 7 in Oakland. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

Armstrong might have played a role in the Chicago Bulls getting their 1996, 1997 and 1998 titles \u2014 even though he wasn\u2019t on those teams. Armstrong was the person who, at a breakfast chat over pancakes in Chicago, nudged Michael Jordan to stop by the Bulls\u2019 practice facility one morning late in the 1994-95 season to go see his old teammates. Before long, Jordan ended his retirement; the Bulls won three more titles in Jordan\u2019s second stint with the franchise. Jordan\u2019s first retirement in 1993, the murder of his father James, his stint in minor league baseball and \u2014 after a gentle push by Armstrong, who takes no credit for Jordan\u2019s return \u2014 his comeback were among the themes in the latest installments of the ESPN and Netflix documentary \u201cThe Last Dance,\u201d a 10-part series that showed episodes seven and eight on Sunday night. \u201cI\u2019ve never thought about it, to be honest with you,\u201d Armstrong, the longtime NBA guard and three-time NBA champion with the Bulls who is now a California-based sports agent, told The Associated Press. \u201cI just wanted to be a good friend and I just saw something in him. When you see someone who really loves something \u2026 he loved it. He didn\u2019t like it. He loved it. That\u2019s who he was. And out of respect to the game of basketball, I wanted to be a good friend.\u201d Sensing the time was right, Armstrong suggested Jordan to go to practice with him that day under the auspices of just seeing the guys. Then Jordan went back for another practice. Then another. Before long, Jordan\u2019s baseball days were done. He was back. \u201cI just got him, he got me, and we got each other and you did what was needed,\u201d said Armstrong, who helped the Bulls win titles in 1991, 1992 and 1993. \u201cI didn\u2019t need to tell anyone or talk about it or anything. That\u2019s just what happened. I was just happy for him because I know what the game of basketball meant to him and meant to his life. He kept basketball in a sacred space and it was the most beautiful thing I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d Jordan retired in October 1993, not long after the murder of his father and with the Bulls having just won their third consecutive title. The first season of Jordan\u2019s hiatus became Armstrong\u2019s best season, in terms of numbers. He set career-highs in points (14.8) and minutes (33.8) per game, started all 82 regular-season games for the first time, plus was a starter in what became his only All-Star appearance. He was a fan favorite, finishing third in All-Star voting that year behind only Charles Barkley and Shaquille O\u2019Neal. Armstrong didn\u2019t replace Jordan in the Bulls\u2019 lineup \u2014 he played point guard, while Pete Myers became the answer to the \u2018who took Jordan\u2019s starting shooting guard spot?\u2019 trivia question \u2014 but he did assume a much bigger role, and did so with Jordan encouraging him with occasional phone calls. And when Armstrong was named the All-Star starter, Jordan was the first person to call him with congratulations. \u201cHe was so happy for me,\u201d Armstrong said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t playing to be an All-Star, but when he called, it meant the world to me then and it means the world to me now. I know what it means to have a friend and I always tried to be a good friend.\u201d Unwittingly, Armstrong may have been a friend again in the 1998 playoffs \u2014 when he was with Charlotte, playing against Jordan and the Bulls in what would become their last title run. Armstrong hit what became a game-winning shot in Game 2 of that series for Charlotte in Chicago, and Jordan didn\u2019t like seeing his former teammate celebrating. He took it as a slight, and he always turned slights into fuel. \u201cI felt like B.J. should know better,\u201d Jordan says early in Episode 8. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to high-five and talk trash, now I have a bone to pick with you. I\u2019m supposed to kill this guy. I\u2019m supposed to dominate this guy. And from that point, I did.\u201d The Bulls didn\u2019t lose again in that series. Armstrong \u2014 who got plenty of defensive attention from Jordan over those next three games \u2014 has no regrets. \u201cWhenever you start a series, you\u2019ve got to let the other person know you\u2019re there for a fight,\u201d Armstrong said. \u201cMichael knew exactly what was happening. I knew exactly what was happening. I don\u2019t know if anyone else did \u2026 He didn\u2019t guard the point guards. He went there.\u201d The final two episodes of the documentary series will debut May 17."},{"id":27768,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/last-dance-5-takeaways-episodes-7-8","date":"2020-05-11","title":"'The Last Dance': 5 takeaways from Episodes 7 and 8","content":" Here are five takeaways from episodes 7 & 8 of \u201cThe Last Dance,\u201d the documentary series on Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls\u2019 1997-98 championship season: * * * This wasn\u2019t so much a scoop as it was a drilling-down into Jordan\u2019s psyche and motivation. When he rode his Bulls teammates harder than most Marine drill instructors breaking down new recruits, he was doing it for himself, sure. He wanted to know that the Jordanaires were up to the task of winning championships. But it also was for them. We saw some of the toughest \u201ctough love\u201d you could imagine in Jordan\u2019s demands, mocking and confrontations with fellow Chicago players. And we got Jordan, finally, pulling back the curtain on it. \u201cWinning has a price,\u201d Jordan said in his recent sitdowns with he documentary crew. \u201cLeadership has a price.\u201d And: \u201cOnce you join the team, you lived at a certain standard I played the game. And I wasn\u2019t going to take anything less.\u201d Center Bill Wennington, who had joined the Bulls during Jordan\u2019s initial retirement, got a no-nonsense welcome when the boss returned. Wennington said Jordan told him, \u201cI want you to jump on the cape. But you have to hold on.\u201d  And if that meant punching teammates such as Will Perdue and Steve Kerr, verbally abusing Scott Burrell, or making Dennis Hopson cry (in 1990-91, not included in the doc), so be it. \u201cWith that kind of mentality he had,\u201d B.J. Armstrong said, \u201che couldn\u2019t be a nice guy.\u201d With Jordan \u2014 as podcast king Adam Carolla likes to say \u2014 it wasn\u2019t about you doing your best, it was you doing his best. He got very specific that he never asked a teammate to do anything that he didn\u2019t do. He got very emotional too. \u201cI wanted to win but I wanted them to be a part of winning as well,\u201d Jordan said, his voice thickening. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to play that way, don\u2019t play that way.\u201d At which point he paused and said, \u201cBreak,\u201d calling his own \u201ccut\u201d to the scene. It was inevitable that we were going to be taken through the summer of 1993, when Jordan\u2019s father James was murdered in a random, roadside assault on a Carolina highway. What that portion of Episode 7 showed was that Michael didn\u2019t decide to retire because of his dad\u2019s tragic death \u2014 he already was thinking of pulling the plug after the \u201993 title, possibly as far back as the fall of 1992. But his sojourn into baseball was inspired largely by his father. Jordan had played and loved baseball before his basketball fortunes soared. He had seen uber-athletes such as Bo Jackson and Deion Sanders tackle, pretty successfully, their two-sport careers. Still, it was his family\u2019s embrace of baseball and his father\u2019s lessons to do what makes him happy that sent him \u2014 naked to a skeptical sports world \u2014 down to Birmingham, Ala., to play for the Class AA Barons in the Chicago White Sox system. Two comments by Jordan at his 1993 retirement news conference 10 weeks after his father\u2019s murder resonated. The first was, \u201cThe word \u2018retire\u2019 means you can do anything you want.\u201d The second: \u201cHe saw my last basketball game.\u201d From there, as the documentary jumped back and forth in time, James Jordan\u2019s presence was at his son\u2019s side, a wingman to rival Scottie Pippen. Right up to Game 6 of the 1996 Finals against Seattle. Those of us covering that championship series, in which Chicago grabbed a 3-0 lead and then dropped Games 4 and 5 to force a return to United Center, wondered in hindsight if some invisible hand was writing poetry: The clincher was played on Father\u2019s Day, with Jordan and the Bulls snagging their first title without Michael\u2019s dad in the house. We\u2019ve seen NBA stars crying and emoting when that moment of championship victory really hits them. But Jordan on the trainer\u2019s room floor, sobbing as he hugged the basketball and trying to turn away from the cameras rather than play to them, was a whole \u2018nother level of genuine.  Working in Minneapolis at the time, the cruel irony of Jordan\u2019s first retirement was immediate: The Timberwolves, oddly amusing but basically awful for their first four years of existence, finally were going to step up to the big time, hosting the 1994 NBA All-Star Game in February. And now (gulp) it was getting an All-Star Game without Michael Jordan. That was a parochial outlook, of course. Imagine how Bulls fans felt, having the game\u2019s greatest player take a powder while still in his prime. Both markets were pleasantly surprised. Pippen had the greatest individual season of his career, leading Chicago to a surprising 55-27 season \u2014 c\u2019mon, they\u2019d lost Michael Jordan on the brink of training camp. He finished third in MVP balloting behind Hakeem Olajuwon and David Robinson. And he took care of Twin Cities hoops fans by stepping into Jordan\u2019s role as the star of stars, taking home the All-Star MVP trophy. Pippen was a different player than Jordan, with a different personality. It clicked with his teammates, too. Yet we\u2019ve been so locked into Jordan\u2019s nasty, pushy, obsessive style of prodding his mates, some of those Bulls sounded a little (dare we say) soft for welcoming the release. Anyway, the whole dynamic within that team changed in span of 1.8 seconds when Pippen refused to participate at the end of Game 3 of the East semifinals series vs. New York. Coach Phil Jackson had drawn up the play for Toni Kukoc to take the last shot, with Pippen not even out on the court as a decoy. No, he had Pippen \u2014 the team\u2019s best passer \u2014 inbounding the ball. After years of being No. 2 to Jordan and then finally moving up in the pecking order, Pippen \u2014 as he saw it \u2014 was back in a supporting role to the rookie Kukoc (the Euro find of GM Jerry Krause, already an irritant to Pippen). As right as his reasons might sound now, he was dead wrong. It was fascinating Sunday night to see both the \u201994 footage and the looks back from various Bulls on how grown men behaved in the aftermath of being betrayed by one of their own. Oh, and this was after Kukoc actually drained the buzzer beater to temporarily fend off the Knicks. \u201cHe quit on us,\u201d Steve Kerr said. \u201cIt was devastating.\u201d Center Bill Cartwright was so upset when he called out Pippen in the locker room, he cried. Pippen apologized then and there, and Kerr said the team accepted it. He was ferocious in the final three games of the series, though the Bulls were eliminated. Pippen\u2019s legacy is secure. He\u2019s in the Hall of Fame, he was named one of the Top 50 players in NBA history in 1997 (when his career had another seven seasons left) and he is widely considered the most important No. 2 ever on an NBA team. To this day, though, there are replica jerseys in Chicago that, rather than displaying his customary number 33, read \u201cPippen 1.8.\u201d So the NBA\u2019s best player went off to play minor league baseball for a season and might have kept going if not for that sports extended labor strife into the spring of 1995. It was a different look for Jordan to have his bat wagging at curveballs rather than his tongue wagging on dunks. But he looked like his old self throughout, recalling that detour and re-visiting the footage Sunday. Except he wasn\u2019t. He had traded in his all-world basketball body for one more suited to baseball, and \u2026 did we hear much about that at the time? It seemed back then as if that sliver of a season and postseason from March 1995 through the Bulls\u2019 elimination against Orlando was notable mostly for some echo-stirring performances by Jordan in his comeback. And his brief use of 45 rather than the famous 23 on his Bulls jersey. Turns out, Jordan wasn\u2019t just rusty or too new, Air-dropping in on the reconstituted Chicago roster the way he did. Jordan had trained to be a baseball player rather than a basketball player. And he had to physically transform back again. \u201cLooking back, I didn\u2019t have enough time to get my body back to a basketball body,\u201d Jordan said. No offense, perhaps, to young Shaquille O\u2019Neal and Penny Hardaway or former Bull Horace Grant, though good luck getting Jordan to say that. Jordan\u2019s personal trainer Tim Grover and the Bulls\u2019 Chip Schaefer backed up that explanation. The reflexes, the strength, the agility needed for one sport was significantly different from the other. It might have been more subtle than, say, giving Yankees slugger Aaron Judge, at 6-foot-7 and 280 pounds, a serviceable NBA power forward\u2019s body. But it was real. This part of the doc showed Jordan taking on his role in \u201cSpace Jam\u201d during the summer of 1995, and how driven he was to regain his form. He had the movie studio construct on its lot the \u201cJordan Dome,\u201d a complete court and gym for his two-hour daily workouts. And then in the evenings, he led top-tier pickup games with NBA talent, both honing his game \u2013 and eyeballing theirs.  Not if you want to have a chance to beat him. Jordan\u2019s penchant for spinning slights \u2014 real or concocted \u2014 into white-hot motivation got the full treatment Sunday. We hear all the time in sports that players and teams, well, they might be able to dig a little deeper now and then, plumb the depths of their talents at opportune times and occasionally extend \u201cthe zone\u201d in which they find themselves in particularly focused moments. What they\u2019re not supposed to be able to do is flip a switch the way you would if you hit the nitrous oxide on the drag strip. Except Jordan, apparently. He not only turned instant grudges into remarkable performances, he found ways to conjure them. At which point, he was Bruce Banner going full Hulk mode. The LaBradford Smith story was early legend. That\u2019s when Jordan got so incensed by the Washington guard\u2019s big scoring night against him in Chicago that he torched Smith the very next night of a back-to-back. But the kicker was Smith\u2019s alleged remark ( \u201cNice game, Mike\u201d ) after the first game never happened. Somehow, Jordan convinced himself that it had and got his revenge. That\u2019s the sort of stuff that drove a wedge between Isiah Thomas and Jordan, and we got lots of it Sunday. There was Nick Anderson\u2019s postgame remark after the Magic won Game 1 of their \u201995 playoff series, that \u201c45 isn\u2019t 23.\u201d There was Seattle coach George Karl\u2019s damned-if-he-did, damned-if-he-didn\u2019t restaurant failure to stop by Jordan\u2019s table to pay homage. Carolina guys? Didn\u2019t matter to Jordan. \u201cThat\u2019s all I needed,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it become personal to me.\u201d And finally a reprise of Jordan\u2019s reaction earlier in the series to a Thomas comment, viewing video on a tablet handed to him. This time it was Gary Payton huffing about how the \u201996 Finals might have gone differently had Karl used Payton to defend Jordan before Game 4. \u201cI kept hitting him and banging him and hitting him and banging him. It took a toll on Mike,\u201d Payton said. \u201cThen the series changed.\u201d Never mind Jordan\u2019s cackling. The highlight was how he patronizingly said Payton\u2019s nickname, \u201cThe Glove\u201d as he handed the tablet back. But the cackling was pretty good too. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

Yao told state broadcaster CCTV on Sunday that he hopes as much as the season can be played as possible, but that public health and fairness were the key considerations. A tournament to restart the season was also being considered if not all scheduled games could be played. Teams would also be isolated in hotels and fans barred from stadiums, he said.

Meanwhile, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver took part in a teleconference with members of the National Basketball Players Association on Friday night. Silver, according to a person familiar with the call\u2019s details, told players that the league is still aiming to hold full best-of-seven playoff series should the season resume and that playing without fans is an obvious possibility. Silver also spoke about the well-known notion of having the season resume in a centralized location, though cautioned that no decisions may be made for another several weeks, according to the person who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because details of the call were not publicly released. Cleveland and Portland were open for players who wanted to get voluntary workouts in, with Cavaliers forward Cedi Osman among the first to be back on an NBA practice court since the league ordered those facilities closed seven weeks ago. \u201cGreat to be back,\u201d Osman wrote on Instagram, as he took a selfie standing in what appeared to be an otherwise-empty practice gym. Another good sign: the Orlando Magic revealed that they have been authorized by health officials in Orange County, Florida to test players and staff. In a letter obtained by AP, Orange County told the Magic it has more than enough testing resources for health-care workers and asymptomatic individuals. \u201cWith the Orange County Department of Health authorization, the NBA has advised us that we are able to have our players tested,\u201d Magic spokesman Joel Glass said. The Los Angeles Lakers and Los Angeles Clippers are expected to be able to follow suit and test players and staff with the approval of local officials soon as well. Lakers players were tested several weeks ago and two players were positive; Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said last week that all residents of Los Angeles County are now eligible for free testing. The NBA has yet to implement a full-scale testing program for all teams, a step that must be taken if there is going to be a return to play this season. But the league has also advised teams that they may be permitted to test, with NBA approval, if local health officials say \u201crobust\u201d testing already exists for at-risk healthcare workers in that community and other conditions are met. The NBA, like other major U.S. leagues, also is trying to avoid any sense that it is jumping the testing line by getting players tested in cities where necessary resources are scarce. Orange County health officer Dr. Raul Pino told the Magic that they can \u201crest assured\u201d that would not be the case in Orlando. Toronto said it would welcome players back for workouts starting next week. The Raptors will be using rules even more strict than the NBA mandates right now; only one player will be allowed in the facility at a time, and the court will be the only place open to players. Everything else, including locker rooms and weight rooms, will remain closed. Other NBA teams, when they open, may have as many as four players in the facility at once. \u201cWe thought this was reasonable,\u201d Raptors general manager Bobby Webster said. \u201cWe thought it allowed our guys to start moving and getting out of their apartment a little bit \u2026 maybe more for mental health, for them to start shooting and doing things like that. I don\u2019t think it was necessarily compared to the NBA rule. I think it was more something that we developed internally.\u201d Denver and Sacramento are among the teams planning to reopen for workouts Monday and many more are expected to effort toward reopening facilities for the voluntary workouts in the coming days; roughly half the league could have players working out next week barring any major setbacks or policy changes. All the Friday news, however, wasn\u2019t good: The Utah Jazz ownership group announced it was furloughing 40% of its staff, the second such move by Larry H. Miller Sports & Entertainment since the NBA suspended its season on March 11. \u201cWith no clear indication of when our businesses can fully reopen, we have made the difficult yet necessary decision to furlough a portion of our employees,\u201d Jim Olsen, the organization\u2019s president, said in a statement. The furloughs affect Jazz employees, workers at the team\u2019s arena, a chain of movie theatres and the Los Angeles Angels\u2019 minor league baseball affiliate in Salt Lake. And the Charlotte Hornets said that, even though North Carolina is beginning to reopen, they have no plans to bring players back right away. They said the decision will be evaluated on a week-to-week basis. \u201cWe believe this decision is in the best interest of our players, coaches and staff,\u201d the Hornets said. * * *"},{"id":27756,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/shannon-brown-arrested-shooting","date":"2020-05-08","title":"Former Lakers guard Shannon Brown accused of shooting at 2 people at 'for sale' home","content":" TYRONE, Ga.

He was 84. Storm said her father died at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta of complications from cancer. Known for his hearty laugh and creative mind, Storen rose to executive spots in basketball, football, baseball and tennis during a four-decade career in sports. \u201cI still have a red, white and blue basketball with his name on it,\u201d Storm said. \u201cAll those things the ABA did \u2014 the 3-point shot, cheerleaders, the slam-dunk contest \u2014 those were right up his alley.\u201d Storen was general manager of the Indiana Pacers and Kentucky Colonels and president of the Atlanta Hawks. He owned the ABA\u2019s Memphis Sounds with musician Isaac Hayes, worked for the Cincinnati Royals of the NBA and the Houston Astros, and was commissioner of the Continental Basketball Association. With the Memphis Grizzlies of the World Football League, he brought in the likes of Paul Warfield and Larry Csonka on the field and Elvis Presley into the seats. Storen promoted the Bluebonnet Bowl in Houston and major indoor tennis tournaments featuring Bjorn Borg in Memphis. His last sports job was with the Georgia Force of the Arena Football League in 2002. \u201cFor me and so many other guys that might not have had a chance to continue playing, his influence on the ABA just gave countless kids and coaches to do something they love,\u201d Basketball Hall of Fame coach and ABA alum Larry Brown said Thursday night. \u201cAnd at the end of the day, when you consider the contributions some of those kids and coaches made in the NBA after the ABA was finished, it\u2019s just remarkable. He just cared about the game and cared about the players in the league.\u201d The Pacers also paid tribute. \u201cIt is impossible to overstate the impact Storen had on our franchise and the American Basketball Association,\u201d the team posted on Twitter. \u201cHe paved the way for the Pacers\u2019 eventual entry into the NBA by putting together a talented front office and assembling a roster led by eventual Hall of Famers Roger Brown and Mel Daniels,\u201d the team said, adding Storen \u201cwas instrumental in choosing the name \u2018Pacers,\u2019 designed the team\u2019s first logo and chose its blue and gold colors. Storen was the first captain of the ABA\u2019s flagship franchise and the foundation for the tradition of success the Pacers maintain to this day.\u201d It was a want ad in the newspaper that started Storen\u2019s pro path. He answered that call \u2014 \u201cwithout any appreciable experience but with a lot of charm and gusto,\u201d Storm has said \u2014 for a ticket seller with the Chicago Zephyrs in the NBA in the early 1960s. He stayed with the team when it moved and became the Baltimore Bullets as their promotions director. Storen eventually ascended to become commissioner of the American Basketball Association in the early 1970s. Boosted by stars such as Julius Erving, Storen helped put in motion the ABA\u2019s move toward a merger with the NBA. Brown said Storen\u2019s impact on the game \u2014 both then and now \u2014 should not be understated. \u201cI would see him from time to time and shoot, I always admired him,\u201d Brown said. That\u2019s the thing that stands out in my mind. When you talk to the old guys from the ABA, the pride we all had in being in the league was just the best part of it. And Mike, to me, championed our league. He made people aware it was a special brand of ball with quality players playing.\u201d Tweeted NBA Hall of Famer Alex English, who started his rise to prominence with the Pacers: \u201cRest In Peace to another pioneer in sports, Mike Storen.\u201d Storen, from Michigan City, Indiana, played freshman football at Notre Dame as a defensive back. He later was a U.S. Marine and was involved with the popular Marine Toys for Tots program. Storm followed her father to school at Notre Dame and, instilled with a love of sports, made that her career path. \u201cFrom the time I was a kid, I was always around sports because of my dad,\u201d Storm said. \u201cI remember always having a lot of very, very tall people in the house for Thanksgiving or Christmas or parties. Artis Gilmore, Dan Issel, Dr. J, so many athletes.\u201d Storen is survived by wife Lynn; sons Mark and Duke and daughter Hannah by his first wife, Hannah; two stepdaughters, Susan Duncan and Lisa Roberts; and 14 grandchildren.

Bickerstaff said Wednesday. Cleveland is one of a handful of teams planning to reopen practice facilities on Friday so players can work out as states across the country ease the social-distancing restrictions put in place during the COVID-19 pandemic, which brought sports to an abrupt halt in March. Big man Larry Nance Jr. will head to the team\u2019s practice facility on May 8 when voluntary workouts will open, reports Marc Stein of The New York Times . Nance suffers from Crohn\u2019s disease, which is treated with immunosuppressive medication that can make Cronh\u2019s disease sufferers more vulnerable to infections. However, he told Stein that he has confidence in the drug he takes \u2014 Remicade \u2014 to combat his Crohn\u2019s. Bickerstaff, who took over one of the league\u2019s youngest teams in February after John Beilein stepped down midway through his first season, said the Cavs have been in contact with local and Ohio officials to ensure they\u2019re following the proper protocol to protect personnel. Only four players will be permitted at a time inside the team\u2019s facility in Independence, Ohio, which has been closed for nearly two months. The Cavs intend to hold two-hour sessions during which only one player and one developmental coach \u2014 wearing gloves and a mask \u2014 will be permitted at the same basket. Bickerstaff said safety is paramount. The Cavs\u2019 medical staff will take the temperature of every person before entering the building, and there will be areas off limits. Also, the team intends to designate and mark basketballs for each player so there is no cross-over and everything will be meticulously cleaned. \u201cThe league is recommending that they keep 12 feet between one another, so you\u2019re there basically rebounding for a guy and passing to a guy,\u201d Bickerstaff said during a Zoom conference call. \u201cNo one is being pressured to do anything. If people feel uncomfortable doing this, it\u2019s not mandatory for them to show up. We\u2019ve got some guys on staff that are willing to do it.\u201d The league is trying to ensure that no team has a competitive advantage by opening their facility. Many teams cannot, some of them possibly for several more weeks, because of local governmental regulations. The situation remains fluid. Bickerstaff spoke to reporters shortly after he and other coaches were on a call with NBA Commissioner Adam Silver, who has been invited by the National Basketball Players Association to speak to players in a call on Friday. Bickerstaff remains hopeful the league will be able to enact a plan so the Cavs can get back on the floor. After months of tumult, they were beginning to click and had gone 5-6 under Bickerstaff, who feels his team was meshing and headed in the right direction. \u201cI\u2019m excited about it,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously the further things go, the longer people are separated, you have to do more creative things. With the way we were moving, I think this separation will make people more excited to get back together and I think we can springboard off that excitement whenever it is that we\u2019re able to get back together.\u201d In the meantime, he\u2019s going to stay focused on coaching. His tenure as a stay-at-home teacher during the quarantine was short. \u201cIt lasted about two days and the kids revolted,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cSo I made the decision that was best for everybody was for me to leave them alone and let my wife handle that.

The reigning Kia MVP is relentless in his pursuit of transition dunks and layups. He\u2019ll score around Anthony Davis in either direction \u2013 going left or going right . His Milwaukee Bucks rank third in fast break points (18.6 per game) and second in the percentage of their shots that have come in the first six seconds of the shot clock (19%), according to Second Spectrum tracking. Antetokounmpo himself leads all individuals with 6.1 fast break points per game. But while Antetokounmpo is a seemingly unstoppable force when he\u2019s going downhill, the Bucks aren\u2019t that efficient on the break. According to Synergy play-type tracking, they rank 26th at 1.07 points per possession in transition . And according to Second Spectrum, their effective field goal percentage of 58.7% in the first six seconds of the shot clock ranks 21st. Despite this, the Bucks still rank sixth in offensive efficiency , just a hair behind the fifth-ranked Miami Heat, and they lead the league in effective field goal percentage (55.3%), the most important number on offense. The MVP leads the league with 17.5 points in the paint per game (the most for any player in the last 17 seasons), and the Bucks\u2019 half-court offense has done a lot of the work in getting him to the basket. Only 25% of Antetokounmpo\u2019s shots have come in the first six seconds of the shot clock. Antetokounmpo\u2019s combination of size and skills allows the Bucks to use him as both a guard and a big man. In transition, he\u2019s the primary ball-handler. But in the half-court offense, he\u2019s more of a screen-setter. Let\u2019s take a look at the various ways the Bucks utilize Antetokounmpo on offense. Antetokounmpo isn\u2019t nearly as ball-dominant as other MVP candidates. This season, he\u2019s had possession for 4.6 minutes per game, a rate which ranks 39th in the league . According to Synergy, he\u2019s averaged just 1.8 pick-and-roll ball-handler possessions per game, fourth on the team that ranks 28th in the league in ball-handler possessions. But in his limited ball-handler opportunities, Antetokounmpo has been efficient. He\u2019s scored 1.09 points per possession as a pick-and-roll ball-handler, the third best mark among 121 players with 100 or more ball-handler possessions . He hasn\u2019t been nearly as efficient in isolations (0.87 points per possession), but ranks seventh in the league with 4.0 iso possessions per game. If he can get a half step on his defender, he\u2019s going to attack. Here are a few plays in which Antetokounmpo is able to get to the basket or to the line off the dribble: Play 1. A simple high screen from Brook Lopez allows Antetokounmpo to attack a retreating Daniel Theis, who does a decent job of denying Antetokounmpo the space he needs to elevate. But the MVP is strong enough to finish through contact. Number to know: According to Second Spectrum, Antetokounmpo has shot 69.4% at the rim with a defender there to contest. That\u2019s the fourth best mark among 49 players (and the best mark among non-centers) with at least 200 contested attempts at the rim. Play 2. Kyle Korver doesn\u2019t actually set a screen for Antetokounmpo, but the threat of the screen is enough for Antetokounmpo to catch Semi Ojeleye leaning and get into the paint, execute his left-shoulder spin move, and draw a foul. Number to know: Antetokounmpo has drawn fouls on 12.6% of his drives, the third highest rate among 107 players who\u2019ve averaged at least five drives per game . Play 3. After Theis and Gordon Hayward form a wall to stop Antetokounmpo in transition, he backs out and isolates against Hayward. He isn\u2019t able to get all the way to the basket, but shows a soft touch on a one-foot fadeaway. Number to know: Antetokounmpo has shot 39.4% on non-restricted-area shots in the paint. That\u2019s a tick below the league average (39.9%). Given that he\u2019s shot 72.9% in the restricted area, keeping him away from the basket is good math for the defense. Play 4. On the Bucks\u2019 favorite sideline out-of-bounds play (which we\u2019ll see again later), Khris Middleton tries to post up Danny Green. When he can\u2019t get good position, he sets a screen for Antetokounmpo, who posts up Green after the switch and quickly spins to the cup for an and-one finish over Avery Bradley. Number to know: According to Second Spectrum, Antetokounmpo has shot 58.8% on post-ups, the best mark among 32 players with at least 75 post-up field goal attempts . Post-ups aren\u2019t very popular these days, but the Bucks will run plays to get Antetokounmpo the ball on the block (he prefers the left block) several times a game. Here are a few examples: Play 1. On an after-timeout play that initially looks a lot like the Bucks\u2019 favorite sideline out of bounds play, Antetokounmpo catches the ball outside, but then gives it back to Eric Bledsoe and runs off two back-screens to a post-up on the right block. Green switches the second of the two screens and can only foul Antetokounmpo in the post. Number to know: Antetokounmpo leads the league with 8.2 fouls drawn per game . Play 2. Another popular action in the Bucks\u2019 playbook is a simple cross-screen, here set by Donte DiVincenzo, to get Antetokounmpo position on the left block. We looked at a few different options out of this play early last season , and it certainly helps when Antetokounmpo\u2019s defender is only 6-foot-5. Number to know: Eric Bledsoe\u2019s 82 assists to Antetokounmpo are most from any of his teammates. Play 3. A back-screen from Wesley Matthews allows Antetokounmpo to get post position against rookie P.J. Washington on the left block. From there, he goes to a left shoulder turnaround in the paint. Number to know: The Bucks are the only team that hasn\u2019t had a rookie play for them this season. Play 4. When Deonte Burton switches a George Hill-Antetokounmpo pick-and-roll, the MVP takes the 6-foot-3 Luguentz Dort into the post, where he scores over the non-existent rim protection of Mike Muscala. Number to know: Antetokounmpo is one of four players \u2013 Anthony Davis, Derrick Favors and Rudy Gobert are the others \u2013 who have shot 70% or better on at least 200 restricted-area attempts in each of the last three seasons. Antetokounmpo averages less than two roll-man possessions per game, according to Synergy. But he\u2019s a willing and active screener, and using him as a roll man can force a defense into some tough situations. Here are a few plays with Antetokounmpo rolling to the rim: Play 1. On the Bucks\u2019 first possession against the Thunder in late February, Antetokounmpo\u2019s third screen for Bledsoe turns into a clean roll down the middle of the paint with Lopez\u2019s spacing keeping Steven Adams occupied. Number to know : The Bucks have outscored their opponents by 18.9 points per 100 possessions with Bledsoe and Antetokounmpo both on the floor. That\u2019s the highest on-court NetRtg mark among 308 two-man combinations that have played at least 750 minutes together. Play 2. In transition, Antetokounmpo gives the ball to Middleton and quickly sets a ball-screen to get Middleton toward the middle of the floor. With Lopez again spacing, the only help defender to meet Antetokounmpo\u2019s roll to the rim is the 6-foot Kemba Walker. Number to know: Antetokounmpo has been assisted on 45.4% of his buckets this season. That\u2019s down from 48.7% last season , but isn\u2019t the lowest rate of his career. Play 3. Antetokounmpo first sets a ball-screen for Bledsoe, but then pops out to the top of the floor, with Korver sprinting out of the left corner for a dribble-handoff. Middleton clears out so the left side of the floor is empty for Antetokounmpo\u2019s roll to the rim. Again, the only defender in position to help is a guard. Number to know: Antetokounmpo leads the league (for the second straight season) with 434 total buckets in the restricted area . Of those buckets, 207 (48%) have been assisted. Play 4. Antetokounmpo doesn\u2019t actually set a screen and doesn\u2019t get the ball as he slips to the rim, but the slip draws help from Nicolas Batum, leaving Middleton open for a corner 3. Number to know: Middleton has shot 46.5% on catch-and-shoot 3-pointers, the fifth best mark among 190 players who have attempted at least 100 . Using Antetokounmpo as a roll man isn\u2019t the only way to get him the ball on the move. Here are a few other options: Play 1. On an after-timeout play, Antetokounmpo gives up the ball and gets a back-screen from Korver, discarding poor Jerome Robinson with a swim move that J.J. Watt would be proud of. Number to know: According to Synergy, the Bucks rank third in after-timeout efficiency at 1.00 points per possession. Play 2. Here\u2019s that sideline out of bounds play again, where the ball is entered to the strong-side elbow and the inbounder (Antetokounmpo) gets a back-screen from another perimeter player (Korver) coming up from the strong side block. Shooters make the best screeners, because their defenders (Javonte Green in this case) don\u2019t want to leave them. On this play, Enes Kanter sees the play and is there for help, but loses a wrestling match for the ball and fouls the MVP. Number to know: Antetokounmpo is the only player who has played at least 500 minutes and accounted for more than half the fouls his team has drawn while he\u2019s been on the floor. Play 3. After a timeout, Antetokounmpo sets the baseline cross-screen for Lopez and then gets a pin-down screen from Bledsoe. After LeBron James hedges the first screen, he gets caught in the second one, allowing Antetokounmpo to catch the ball with plenty of space to operate. James wisely closes out in control and Antetokounmpo settles for a mid-range jumper. Number to know: Antetokounmpo has shot 65.7% in the paint and has an effective field goal percentage of 43.7% on shots from outside the paint. That\u2019s the sixth biggest differential among 222 players with at least 100 field goal attempts both in and outside the paint. Play 4. The final play could be put in the roll-man category, but Antetokounmpo clears out after initially rolling to the rim. Bledsoe then \u201cputs the speed on\u201d to collapse the defense, and the ball eventually finds Antetokounmpo for another one of those 434 restricted area buckets. Number to know: With the departure of Malcolm Brogdon, the Bucks have seen the biggest drop in drives per game, from 48.5 ( seventh ) last season to 38.8 ( 28th ) this season. Having different ways to get Antetokounmpo the ball near the basket, especially in a playoff series when the opponent knows what\u2019s coming, will continue to be critical for the Bucks. So will the ability of his teammates to make defenses pay for using multiple defenders to stop the MVP. The Bucks rank just 21st in catch-and-shoot 3-point percentage (36.5%). Brook Lopez is a Defensive Player of the Year candidate and will space the floor offensively, but defenses will allow him to shoot. The 29.7% he\u2019s shot on catch-and-shoot 3s is the third worst mark among 67 players who\u2019ve attempted at least 200 . Korver is one of the best shooters in NBA history and Antetokounmpo\u2019s partner in a lot of effective actions offensively, but is a liability on the other end of the floor. In the Bucks\u2019 loss to the Lakers in early March, Rajon Rondo blew by Korver for two layups , and the 39 year old would surely be a target of the opposing offense in a playoff series. DiVincenzo has shot adequately ( 36.3% ) on catch-and-shoot 3s, but the Bucks\u2019 other back-up wing \u2013 Pat Connaughton \u2013 has not (31.5%). Bledsoe shot 9-for-35 (26%) on catch-and-shoot 3s in last year\u2019s playoffs. George Hill has been the best shooter in the league this year , but doesn\u2019t provide the defense nor the driving ability (needed even more with the absence of Brogdon) that Bledsoe does. The Bucks\u2019 No. 1-ranked defense, featuring elite rim protection , will win them a lot of games. But there will be times when the opponent is knocking down the 3s that the Bucks are willing to give up, and the spotlight will turn to the other end of the floor, Antetokounmpo\u2019s ability to get to the rim, and his teammates\u2019 ability to provide help. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

The league leader in steals was sidelined with nerve issues in his lower back when the season was suspended on March 11 because of the coronavirus pandemic. He is allowed to rehabilitate at the 76ers\u2019 practice facility in Camden, New Jersey, but there seemed to be no guarantee he would have been cleared to play in time for a playoff run. \u201cWe\u2019ve took our time, we\u2019ve been methodical and thoughtful about his recovery and rehab, just to make sure, because we weren\u2019t in a rush,\u201d 76ers GM Elton Brand said Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to speculate. He\u2019s been working hard and I know he\u2019d be close or ready.\u201d Simmons had missed his eighth straight game and was receiving daily treatment for his nerve impingement at the time the season stopped. Brand, speaking to media for the first time since, said he would not speculate on Simmons\u2019 availability had the Sixers still been playing in the postseason. Simmons had yet to play 3-on-3 or 5-on-5 during his rehab. \u201cWhen I FaceTime him during his workouts and his treatments and I see him, I\u2019d be highly encouraged,\u201d Brand said. \u201cHis ramp-up would be different.\u201d The 23-year-old Simmons averaged 16.7 points, 7.8 rebounds and 8.2 assists in 54 games. He and other players undergoing rehab, including All-Star center Joel Embiid, have permission to use the 76ers\u2019 practice facility. Embiid was recovering from surgery on his left hand and had just returned after missing five games with a sprained left shoulder at the time of the shutdown. \u201cHe\u2019s asking about when his trainer can come in,\u201d Brand said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t bet against him. He\u2019s going to be ready and ramped up.\u201d The Sixers have a skeleton staff on hand at the facility when players need rehab, usually a physical trainer or a strength coach, and never more than about six people at a time. Entering a season with NBA championship expectations, the Sixers (39-26) were a disappointing sixth in the Eastern Conference and coach Brett Brown\u2019s job status was a hot topic in Philly. Brown, whose contract runs through 2021-22, may have gained some more time to fix the Sixers because of the shutdown. Al Horford was a free-agent bust coming over from Boston and had lost his starting job. The questions raised during the season may not be answered for months, though a healthy Simmons and Embiid could serve as a course correction, if the NBA resumes its season. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to speculate on what changes would be made if we don\u2019t have a season,\u201d Brand said. Brand said the Sixers have sent players any workout equipment needed and designed workouts to help them stay in shape during the break. \u201cI\u2019m making sure their physical health and also their mental health are in great shape,\u201d Brand said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take a ramp-up. I don\u2019t know how much time that\u2019s going to be once it\u2019s deemed safe, but we\u2019re definitely going to need some time to get back in the gym, to have time to get your legs back and get your wind back.\u201d Like most of the rest of the league, Brand remained hopeful the NBA season would resume and said the Sixers are prepared to play the Boston Celtics in a potential playoff matchup, should the league go that route. Brand also said the Sixers were not in a rush to replace former senior vice president of player personnel Marc Eversley, hired last week as general manager of the Chicago Bulls. Brand has kept busy, participating in both the weekly general manager\u2019s call with NBA Commissioner Adam Silver and a return-to-play committee. With the 76ers holding up to five picks in the 2020 draft, Brand also has met virtually with prospects, their families and agents. There is one Zoom call Brand has missed: the player-organized virtual happy hours. \u201cFor some reason, I\u2019m not invited to those,\u201d he said with a laugh."},{"id":27802,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/clippers-owner-steve-ballmer-closes-deal-forum","date":"2020-05-04","title":"Clippers owner completes $400 million deal for The Forum","content":" INGLEWOOD, Calif.

As we remain patient, NBA TV continues its rewind of some of the best performances and most exciting games in league history. This week\u2019s schedule features the best of Charles Barkley and Chris Paul, Pascal Siakam and Fred VanVleet reliving the highlight of their young NBA careers, and some big Game 7s. The new month also brings us a new feature. With \u201cThis Day in History,\u201d NBA TV will air one of the best games from that date at 6 p.m. ET. * * * Monday is time to celebrate the career of Hall of Famer Charles Barkley, with some of his best and favorite games throughout the day, and chronicling his best plays with a special edition of High Tops at 8:30 p.m. ET. 6 p.m. ET:  This Day in History: Suns at Warriors, May 4, 1994 Did you know that Barkley\u2019s career high came in a playoff game? He never scored 50 points in the regular season , but dropped 56 on the Warriors as the Suns completed a three-game sweep of their first-round series in 1994. He made 23 of his 31 shots, adding 14 rebounds, four assists and three steals. 9 p.m. ET:  Sonics at Suns, June 1, 1993 (Pop Up Edition) As he led the Suns to The Finals in 1993, one of Barkley\u2019s best performances came in a pivotal Game 5 of the Western Conference finals. He registered one of his four career postseason triple-doubles , scoring 43 points, grabbing 15 rebounds, and dishing out 10 assists. The Suns pulled off a late comeback (featuring a huge tip dunk from Barkley) to take a 3-2 series lead. The Tuesday schedule will include a few Game 7s from the conference semifinals, including a pair of Houston-Phoenix games (1994 and 1995) at 10:30 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. ET. 6 p.m. ET:  This Day in History: Jazz at Rockets, May 5, 1995 The defending-champion and sixth-seeded Rockets faced elimination five times in the first two rounds of the 1995 playoffs. The first of those elimination games was Game 4 of their first-round series against the Jazz. They got 40-point performances from both Clyde Drexler and Hakeem Olajuwon to stay alive and force a deciding Game 5 in Utah. 9 p.m. ET: Siakam and VanVleet: Raptors at Warriors, June 13, 2019 (Film Room) Pascal Siakam and Fred VanVleet join the broadcast to relive the night they won their first championship. The pair combined for 48 points in Game 6 and made two of the biggest shots of the game. VanVleet gave the Raptors the lead with a step-back 3 with less than four minutes to go, and Siakam put them up three with a floater in the final minute. 11 p.m. ET:  Mavs at Spurs, May 22, 2006 (Pop Up Edition) On their way to The Finals for the first time in franchise history, the Mavs faced a Game 7 on the road and a three-point deficit with less than 30 seconds to go in regulation. Dirk Nowitzki (37 points, 15 rebounds) saved them with a 3-point play and his teammates put the series away in overtime. Tim Duncan had 41 points, 15 rebounds, six assists and three blocks for the defending-champion Spurs. On Wednesday, we celebrate the 35th birthday of one of the best point guards in NBA history. The day will feature some of Chris Paul\u2019s best playoff performances and will be capped by a special Pop Up Edition of one of the best moments of his career. 9 p.m. ET: Spurs at Clippers, May 2, 2015 (Pop Up Edition) In Game 7 of the first round against the team that had eliminated him from the postseason twice in the past, Paul made one of the more incredible game-winners of the last 10 years, an off-balance bank shot over Tim Duncan with one second left on the clock. During the day, the NBA TV schedule will feature one-hour cuts of some of the best second-round playoff performances of the past 10 years, highlighted by last year\u2019s Raptors-Sixers Game 7 at 5 p.m. ET. 6 p.m. ET:  This Day in History: Nuggets at Sonics, May 7, 1994 The first No. 8 seed to eliminate a No. 1 seed in NBA history had to come back from a 2-0 deficit in a five-game series. The Nuggets won Games 3 and 4 at home and then returned to Seattle. This is a special Pop Up Edition of Game 5, which went to overtime and ended with the iconic image of Dikembe Mutombo lying on his back and holding the game ball in exultation. 9 p.m. ET: Cavs at Celtics, May 18, 2008 (Pop Up Edition) The second of two Game 7s that the Celtics played on their way to the 2008 championship was both a nail-biter and one of the best one-on-one duals in recent postseason memory. LeBron James scored 45 points, but the Celtics got 41 from Paul Pierce, who came up with a huge jump ball in the final minute to help the Celtics advance to the Eastern Conference finals. The daytime schedule on Friday will be a Dunk Contest marathon, with Vince Carter at 7:30 a.m. and Gordon vs. LaVine at 3:30 p.m. ET. Then, in the evening, we get back to postseason memories. 6 p.m. ET:  This Day in History: Lakers at Knicks, May 8, 1970 Game 7 of the 1970 Finals is best known for Willis Reed walking out of the Madison Square Garden tunnel with a torn muscle in his leg to inspire the Knicks and the New York crowd. But it was Clyde Frazier\u2019s 36 points, 19 assists and seven rebounds that propelled the Knicks to their first championship. 9 p.m. ET:  Rockets at Mavs, Apr. 25, 2005 (Pop Up Edition) In Game 2 of the 4-5 series in the West, Yao Ming led the Rockets with 33 points on 13-for-14 shooting. But Tracy McGrady was the star as the Rockets took a 2-0 series lead, finishing with 28 points, eight rebounds and 10 assists. McGrady\u2019s night featured an iconic dunk over Shawn Bradley and the game-winning jumper with 2.2 seconds left. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

Jordan was fried. No offense to the Houston Rockets, who won twice during Jordan\u2019s initial retirement, or the New York Knicks, who seized the first East title after Jordan retired again. But the Jordan who ground his way through the 1992-93 season would have been vulnerable to toppling in a way he wasn\u2019t in the midst of either three-peat. If that Jordan doesn\u2019t get a breather, heck, he and his team might have been done after three. Much of scrutiny, media crush and build-\u2018em-up, tear-\u2018em-down that Jordan faced was his own doing: his gambling in casinos and on golf courses cast him in a light different from everything that had come before. Even his contentious relations within the Bulls as revealed by Sam Smith\u2019s \u201cThe Jordan Rules\u201d book didn\u2019t prepare folks for His Airness heading to Atlantic City the night before a playoff game \u2013 and then ( gasp! ) losing the game. But much of the 24\/7 crush on Jordan \u2014 way before social media, mind you \u2014 was simply a by-product of the new heights of intense global popularity to which Jordan had helped take the league. \u201cFrom the moment Michael Jordan leaves his hotel room, the spotlight is on him,\u201d said longtime Bulls media relations chief Tim Hallam. taking us through a typically packed day. Everybody, Hallam said, \u201cwanted a piece of him in one way or another.\u201d \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to \u2018be like Mike. It\u2019s an impossible task.\u201d It got impossible even for Jordan. Deep into Episode 6, lying on the couch in his hotel room with the documentary\u2019s film crew present, Jordan in 1998 at least had perspective on the price paid for all his riches, glory and fame. \u201cThis is not one of those lifestyles that you envy,\u201d he said, making clear that \u201998 dance would be his last (for a while, at least). \u201cI\u2019m ready for getting out of this life.\u201d But in 1993, it all was seizing up on him for the first time. Rumors swirled about his associations with gamblers such as James (Slim) Bouler and Richard Esquinas. If it wasn\u2019t the debts he incurred \u2013 pocket change relative to his earnings \u2013 it was the character and unsavoriness of those golf partners. Beyond that, the demands on his time, the pressure to be \u201con\u201d all day and night and still produce after tipoff, seemed oppressive. No way he and thus they could have kept it going from 1991 through 1998 or 1999. Bill Russell and the Celtics\u2019 run of eight in a row, and 11 in 13 seasons, would have had nothing to worry about. Makes you realize, too, why he seems to avoid the spotlight now as the owner of the Charlotte Hornets. He did his time, and way more.  That was Jordan\u2019s way of explaining what some assumed was a gambling addiction. And he nailed it. We had seen slices of his obsessive, even maniacal need to win in the first four episodes. But by the end of Sunday night, who wasn\u2019t thinking at least a little, \u201cPoor Toni Kukoc, Clyde Drexler and Dan Majerle.\u201d In discussing all three of them, you could hear echoes of Jordan\u2019s notorious Hall of Fame enshrinement speech in 2009, when he dredged up seemingly every grudge and triumph over nemeses dating back to the kid who stole his milk money. It wasn\u2019t gracious. Frankly, it was vicious. But it was Jordan distilled, a glimpse that his wiring was intact, a reminder of how and why he was who he was. That was made clear again as he added the three aforementioned rivals to the trash bin where he\u2019d tossed Isiah Thomas earlier in the doc. He and Pippen dismantled Toni Kukoc as \u201cDream Team\u201d Dobermans in the 1992 Barcelona Olympics as a surrogate for Bulls GM Jerry Krause. Krause, their resident nemesis in Chicago, was fawning over the Croatian Sensation while he still had the GOAT and his all-world sidekick chasing down championships for him. Jordan made Drexler, Portland\u2019s future Hall of Fame shooting guard, pay in the \u201992 Finals just because they happened to play the same position and other people (not Clyde) had compared the two. With Majerle, it was back to showing up Krause, crushing a player in the \u201993 Finals the GM admired. A curious omission from Episode 6: Based on how personally he took things against Kukoc, Drexler and Majerle, we could have used a few inner-most thoughts on his motivation against Charles Barkley in the Phoenix series. Resenting a regular-season MVP snub was enough for Hakeem Olajuwon against David Robinson in 1995. But given Jordan\u2019s pathological need to destroy people and his long relationship with Charles, there had to be more than we got Sunday. In 1990, Democratic nominee Harvey Gantt first challenged incumbent Jesse Helms in North Carolina for his U.S. Senate seat. Jordan, as that state\u2019s biggest celebrity, declined to endorse Gantt, an African-American who was Charlotte\u2019s first black mayor, against an opponent widely considered to be racist. That\u2019s when a quote uttered in jest trailed Jordan for years: \u201cRepublicans buy sneakers, too.\u201d These days, such a disinclination to take a stand would resonate, and in ways that could potentially impact the bottom line. Even in 1990, folks wondered and media asked if Jordan\u2019s fiscal interests outweighed his civic responsibilities. In the documentary, Jordan explained why he stayed in his lane and simply sent a check to Gantt\u2019s campaign. \u201cIt\u2019s never going to be enough for everybody, I realize that,\u201d he said. \u201cThe way I go about my life, I set examples. If it inspires you, great. If it doesn\u2019t maybe I\u2019m not the person you should be following.\u201d Jordan sure seemed to spend a lot of pregame time in that one room off the Bulls\u2019 locker room at United Center. We\u2019ve seen him time and again in there, usually in street clothes, with pals such as Ahmad Rashad and Quinn Buckner. But mostly, we\u2019ve noticed the guys who made up his security detail in there with Jordan. On Sunday, when he wasn\u2019t entertaining them by giving teammate Randy Brown grief while handing over a game ticket for a Brown associate, Jordan was pitching pennies (or some coin) and razzing those security staffers assigned to him by the organization. He was happy to take their money or give up his in yet another bit of casual competition. Jordan had an easy rapport with those guys, around whom he seemed to let down his guard. Oh, everyone knew he was the boss in those situations, but their roles were so defined, it has looked \u2013 through all six episodes so far \u2013 that he was able to relax around them. More so even than his teammates, who always represented some sort of challenge. If not to his supremacy in the Bulls\u2019 pecking order, then an obstacle to defeat on the practice court or a possible slacker when it would be winning time.  Obviously, some wildly designed sneakers were not the secret to Jordan\u2019s transcendence as arguably the greatest player in NBA history. An old pair of canvas Chuck Taylors still probably would have gotten him to Springfield. But the Air Jordan I and all the variations that came after in his association with Nike did propel him to a level of business success and global popularity rarely, if ever, achieved by an athlete to that point. Jordan and Nike had unveiled the shoes in a November 1984 game at Philadelphia in Jordan\u2019s rookie season. The NBA took umbrage at the individualism in the shoe company\u2019s packaging of the new star and threatened the Bulls and Jordan with a $5,000 fine for every game he wore them. Nike, naturally, would have been happy to write the checks \u2013 it couldn\u2019t buy publicity like that (though the league, the shoemaker and Jordan reportedly reached a compromise agreement before any fines were levied). Working in Milwaukee and writing about the Bucks at the time, I shifted my attention for a Bulls\u2019 matinee bus ride up I-94 to the sneakers that weren\u2019t sneaking up on anybody. Here is an excerpt from the next morning\u2019s column: The column ran with a big photo of Jordan\u2019s shoes. Bookending it, on the other side of the type, was a photo from the game of Bulls teammate Quintin Dailey\u2019s feet, adorned in some worn, unattractive, black-and-gray Pony brand low-cuts. Turns out, when I asked Dailey if he too were getting into shoe entrepreneurship, he just shrugged and admitted he had forgotten to pack his game sneakers for the ride up from Chicago. So against the Bucks that afternoon, in an NBA game, he had used his \u201cwalkin\u2019 around shoes.\u201d We\u2019ve come a long way. And we\u2019ve got four hours to go. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

Whether it was during his rookie season when his stall in the Bulls locker room was adjacent to Jordan\u2019s locker, or at a dinner with the six-time NBA champion and Kobe Bryant about a quarter-century later, Armstrong often found himself with a front-row seat to witness the true cost of fame for arguably the world\u2019s most recognizable athlete. \u201cI remember as a young player I had this dream of playing in the NBA,\u201d Armstrong, the longtime NBA guard and three-time NBA champion with the Bulls who is now a California-based sports agent, told The Associated Press. \u201cAnd I vividly remember when I got to Chicago thinking, \u2018You better be careful what you wish for, because you just might get it.\u2019 Michael was the first person to show me what it meant to be a star \u2026 but you cannot be that star and not accept all the things that came with it.\u201d The strain of Jordan\u2019s practically unprecedented level of stardom was one of the dominant themes in the latest installments of the ESPN and Netflix documentary \u201cThe Last Dance,\u201d a 10-part series that showed episodes five and six on Sunday night. Every story about Jordan always seemed to become a big story, and Jordan felt some things were overblown such as his infamous stances on not wanting to endorse political candidates publicly or going with his father to Atlantic City for a quick gambling trip during the 1993 Eastern Conference finals. \u201cWe understood his pressures, he understood what we needed and that was just a special group of people who got together,\u201d said Armstrong, who was a Jordan teammate for the 1991, 1992 and 1993 championships. \u201cI don\u2019t wish stardom on anyone. When I hear people say, \u2018this guy\u2019s a star,\u2019 I always say, \u2018good luck.\u2019 What it takes to be a star at that level is beyond. Always having security around, dealing with tickets, he always had to be turned on. There\u2019s no preparation for that. \u201cI always say, to this day, that the Air Jordan guy was great and God bless him. But I\u2019ll always just remember Michael, the guy.\u201d Knowing that there would always be an enormous media horde at Jordan\u2019s locker, Armstrong found himself getting dressed and out of the way quickly because otherwise his shoes would get stomped on and his space would be invaded. If he forgot how that exercise went, he got a reminder in 2014. Jordan was in Los Angeles and dinner with Armstrong was arranged. Armstrong got to the restaurant and found a third seat at the table, asked Jordan if a guest was coming and was told that Bryant would be joining them for the meal. Armstrong and Bryant knew each other; they shared an agent, Arn Tellem, at one time. Bryant arrived and before long, he and Jordan were dissecting every nuance of each other\u2019s game. In the end, they decided that Jordan would have a slight edge because his hands were bigger than Bryant\u2019s. \u201cThey were playing a virtual game of 1-on-1 at dinner,\u201d Armstrong said. \u201cI just sat there and listened to them talk about the love they had for the game. They were so sophisticated; they were talking about footwork, how they conditioned themselves, how they would box out. The detail that they had, the respect that they had for the game \u2026 I wish I could have seen them play in their prime.\u201d Word got out over the course of the evening that Jordan and Bryant were in the restaurant. Eventually, one got out through a back door, another through a side door, and Armstrong was left to fight off a crowd. \u201cIt was chaos,\u201d Armstrong said. \u201cAnd they were in basketball heaven.\u201d The seventh and eighth episodes of the documentary will air May 10, with the final two episodes on May 17."},{"id":27786,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nba-family-reacts-last-dance-episodes-5-6","date":"2020-05-04","title":"'The Last Dance': NBA family reacts to Episodes 5 and 6","content":" ESPN\u2019s Chicago Bulls documentary series, \u201cThe Last Dance,\u201d continued Sunday night and the NBA family watched the unfolding saga of Michael Jordan\u2019s ruthless drive toward back-to-back championships, the \u201cDream Team\u201d and the run for a three-peat.

And the reasons you don\u2019t have final regular-season standings by now are the same reasons you can\u2019t have the annual Draft Combine in a few weeks. Both events were postponed Friday, the league announced, as part of the continued shutdown due to the coronavirus crisis and government guidelines. \u201cMore information on each event will be shared at a later date,\u201d the NBA said in a statement . It will continue \u201cto closely monitor the coronavirus pandemic and consult with infectious disease specialists, public health experts and government officials.\u201d The Draft Lottery was scheduled for May 19 in Chicago, the same site as the Draft Combine set for May 19-24. In theory, the lottery could have been conducted remotely, without league executives, representatives of each teams and media members gathering in a hotel ballroom. But because the 2019-20 season remains paused, with the possibility of resuming regular-season play still among the NBA\u2019s many, constantly changing models for a return to action, the actual 14 lottery teams are as uncertain as most of the 16 playoff qualifiers. Mathematically, only the Milwaukee Bucks, Torono Raptors, Boston Celtics in the Eastern Conference and the Los Angeles Lakers in the Western Conference had clinched postseason berths by the time the schedule was suspended March 11. A total of 259 games were left on the schedule, their status \u2014 as well as the playoffs \u2014 on hold. \u201cThere are no target dates,\u201d R.C. Buford, CEO of the San Antonio Spurs, had said earlier this week. \u201cWe just got the early-entry list in the last couple of days. That at least gives some kind of clarity on who the draft pool will be. \u201cBut from there, we don\u2019t have clarity on the Chicago pre-draft or medicals or all the things that go on with draft preparation.\u201d Postponing the combine, where draft-eligible players get evaluated by scouts and executives of the league\u2019s 30 teams, owes more to the calendar, and the travel and social-distancing limitations facing much of the nation overall. Pushing back the date for the combine \u2014 if it gets held at all \u2014 delays the decision-making process for early-entrant players in particular. They currently face an NCAA deadline to retain eligibility of June 3; a similar deadline for international players is June 15. If the combine is not held, medical information traditionally obtained by teams there would need to be procured in some other way. The 2020 NBA Draft is scheduled for June 25.

Golden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry joined \u201cThe Rory & Carson Podcast\u201d on Tuesday hosted by Rory McIlroy and Carson Daly for a wide-ranging interview that included discussions of his quarantine home-schooling efforts, ordering a hoop from Amazon to practice on during self-isolation, golf, and the potential return of the NBA. Perhaps what stood out most from the chat is that the two-time Kia MVP and three-time NBA champion continues to look for ways to improve as a player. That\u2019s the gist taken from Curry sharing his opinion on \u201cThe Last Dance\u201d documentary. \u201cSo, I\u2019m actually learning a lot about leadership, and just really another appreciation for the demands that are put on us as professional athletes,\u201d Curry said, later adding, \u201cSo, with what M.J. is sharing with the world right now \u2013 and I know he said not a lot of people are gonna like him after watching this documentary because his personality was so strong, and he just wanted to be great \u2013 I love that stuff because that\u2019s what that championship is all about, and no better person to tell that story than him.\u201d  Here\u2019s a quick rundown of more of the content generated by players around the NBA as they await clearance to resume the season: * * * LeBron James\u2019 Instagram page is a must-follow if you\u2019re interested in the day to day of arguably the NBA\u2019s top superstar. James dropped a tease Thursday of what appears to be the actual title of the new \u201cSpace Jam\u201d movie, which is a sequel to the original 1996 Looney Tunes film starring Michael Jordan. James posted a boomerang of himself wearing a black hat with the logo of \u201cSpace Jam: A New Legacy.\u201d http:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/B_nkZubgRyI\/ The new film, which stars James and Don Cheadle along with several stars of the NBA and WNBA, is set to release on July 16, 2021.  * * * Washington Wizards five-time All-Star point guard John Wall hasn\u2019t competed in an NBA game since December of 2018 due to suffering a ruptured Achilles tendon, and it\u2019s clear he\u2019s ready to show the world that he\u2019s still got it. Wall joined the \u201cAll the Smoke\u201d podcast on Thursday and discussed his challenging rehabilitation process, while pointing out that perhaps the best is yet to come. \u201cI\u2019m like, I can\u2019t wait to show them what I got, what I\u2019m about,\u201d Wall said. \u201cI\u2019m gonna be better than I was before, and that\u2019s the scary part about it because damn near my whole five years I was an All-Star. But I played with two bone spurs in my knee and my hip. People don\u2019t know that. They ain\u2019t even get the best of John Wall yet. They just got a clip of him.\u201d * * * New Orleans Pelicans rookie Zion Williamson chopped it up Monday with TNT\u2019s Ernie Johnson on NBA Together , and they delved into a variety of subjects, inclu ding the Kia Rookie of the Year race. Williamson paid Morant his due. \u201cJa being a brother of mine, I\u2019m happy for Ja,\u201d Williamson said of his former AAU teammate. \u201cJa has worked for it. He\u2019s earned it. I give respect when it\u2019s due. But you know, as a competitor, I want to win at everything. I\u2019m not going to sit here and say I don\u2019t want to win. I want to win at everything. So, my goal was if I could rally my team into the playoffs, hopefully I could make a run for [Rookie of the Year]. It\u2019s just God\u2019s plan at this point.\u201d Morant appears to be the runaway favorite to capture the award, having played in 59 games to lead his team to the eighth spot in the West prior to the league suspending the season. Williamson, meanwhile, played in just 19 games. But you can\u2019t deny his impact. Williamson (23.6 points per game on 58.9% from the floor and 46.2% from deep) seemed poised to lead the Pelicans to a serious postseason push. New Orleans ranked 10th in the West when the NBA shut down the season. * * * Orlando Magic forward Aaron Gordon released a track called \u201c9 OUT OF 10,\u201d and it\u2019s clear he\u2019s still not over losing the 2020 NBA All-Star Slam Dunk Contest to Derrick Jones Jr. in a second-round dunkoff. Gordon racked up five consecutive dunks that earned perfect scores, but his final jam in the dunkoff \u2013 a slam over 7-foot-5 center Tacko Fall to close the show \u2013 didn\u2019t merit a score of 50. Wade served as one of the judges who scored Gordon\u2019s final dunk with a lower score (9) than Jones\u2019 last jam from just inside the free-throw line. Gordon scored a 47 on his final dunk, while Jones received a 48 for the win. While you could technically call Gordon\u2019s new song a diss directed at Wade, it\u2019s clear the track was done in jest. In fact, Gordon told The Athletic in a phone interview that Wade liked the song. \u201cHe said he liked my song, and I told him I liked his wine, and it\u2019s really not that big of a deal,\u201d Gordon said. \u201cIt\u2019s not that deep. It\u2019s for fun. It\u2019s for entertainment. It\u2019s what the people wanted. I was just expressing another side of myself, showing people creativity, the talent, and keep[ing] people entertained and kind of light and something to take their minds off of the serious of the situation that\u2019s going on around us.\u201d * * * You didn\u2019t read that wrong. Wilbon actually took a bite out of Aldridge, according to this funny story the ESPN commentator shared Tuesday on Twitter from a moment in Game 2 of the 1991 NBA Finals between the Chicago Bulls and Los Angeles Lakers. http:\/\/twitter.com\/RealMikeWilbon\/status\/1255199193108566028?s Sports journalists all over the country understand the unwritten rule that there\u2019s no cheering, yelling or strong reactions allowed from press row. So, when Michael Jordan launched for an apparent dunk, before switching hands in mid-air for a layup off the glass, Wilbon could hardly contain himself. His first reaction was to turn and bite colleague Aldridge on the shoulder. After the game, Aldridge slid off his suit jacket to reveal indentations of the bite mark Wilbon left on his shoulder. Aldridge totally confirmed Wilbon\u2019s story was true. * * * Michael C. Wright is a senior writer for NBA.com. You can e-mail him  here  , find his archive  here   and follow him on  Twitter  .

In this role, Eversley will report directly to Executive Vice President \u2013 Basketball Operations Arturas Karnisovas and primarily be responsible for overseeing the implementation of all elements of the basketball operations process. \u201cI set out to find a General Manager who complemented my vision and values, and who could help implement them at the Bulls in a fresh way. Marc\u2019s background and skills do exactly that,\u201d said Karnisovas. \u201cHe has a history of building strong relationships across the board, identifying talent at organizations that have had success during his time there, and the necessary insight for building a network that will be an asset to our program. He\u2019s ready for this next step in his career, and I\u2019m looking forward to working with him to build the Bulls back into a perennial contender.\u201d Eversley comes to Chicago with 14 years of NBA experience, working for the Toronto Raptors, Washington Wizards and Philadelphia 76ers. In his latest role as Senior Vice President of Player Personnel with the 76ers, he not only oversaw player personnel and talent evaluation, but was also involved in Philadelphia\u2019s recruiting and decision-making process. He was promoted to Senior Vice President after serving the first two seasons as Vice President of Player Personnel. He also oversaw Philadelphia\u2019s scouting department on the collegiate, NBA and international levels. \u201cBecoming a General Manger in the NBA and joining the Chicago Bulls family is a dream come true,\u201d said Eversley. \u201cI\u2019m grateful to be working with someone like Arturas who shares my level of passion and commitment to winning basketball, and having both come from successful programs, we will put in the work and all it entails to become a sustainable and winning team. I want to thank Arturas, as well as Jerry and Michael Reinsdorf, for trusting in my leadership abilities to move this iconic franchise forward.\u201d Eversley was on the 76ers staff when the team selected Ben Simmons first-overall in the 2016 NBA Draft, and he helped Philadelphia transition from a team that won 28 games his first season in 2016-17 to one that won 50-plus games the next two seasons. This year\u2019s team was on pace for 50 wins again before the NBA went on hiatus during the 2019-20 season. He had a hand in acquiring such players as J.J. Redick, Jimmy Butler and Tobias Harris to fortify a roster that included Simmons and Joel Embiid. Prior to joining the 76ers, Eversley spent three seasons with the Washington Wizards as Vice President of Player Personnel. He began his NBA career with the Toronto Raptors where he spent seven seasons as an Assistant General Manager responsible for player development, then personnel scouting and evaluation, and he played a lead role in drafting DeMar DeRozan ninth-overall in the 2009 NBA Draft. Eversley concluded the final two seasons of his Toronto tenure as the Vice President of College Scouting. Before working in the NBA, Eversley spent five years at Nike\u2019s world headquarters in Oregon as its NBA Player Relationship Manager, which advanced his development in managing relationships with athletes, along with team and athlete brand management. He began in retail, managing Nike-owned stores in Ontario, before moving to Nike Canada\u2019s corporate office where he oversaw the basketball assets. Eversley worked for six years with Nike Canada before moving to Oregon. He has participated in the NBA\u2019s Basketball Without Borders program in both September 2011 in Johannesburg, and in August 2017 in Europe. Eversley attended high school in Brampton, Ontario, and went to college at Urbana University in Urbana, Ohio, on a basketball scholarship.

Thousands chanted \u201cWe want Jalen\u201d at the team\u2019s first event that he visited this past season as he nodded in approval and acknowledgement. Even Grizzlies rookie guard Ja Morant was in on the sales pitch, doing all he could to convince Green to come to his city. And then the G League came calling. Before long, everything \u2014 Green\u2019s plans, the trajectory and mission of the G League, perhaps even the landscape of college basketball on some level \u2014 changed. When Green signed to become the first to go straight from high school into the G League\u2019s new developmental program that gives elite players an opportunity to make money while spending a year solely majoring in basketball, a new era for the game officially began. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with college basketball,\u201d Green said. \u201cI have a lot of friends that I played with in college right now. But I just felt this was the best route for me. Being different, I carried that through high school and this was another way that I could carry on being different.\u201d So far, Green \u2014 a 6-foot-6 shooting guard who was considered by some as the top recruit in the country \u2014 is one of three players to take advantage of this new pathway. He\u2019s been joined since by 6-10 power forward Isaiah Todd, and 6-4 point guard Daishen Nix. Todd was committed to Michigan, Nix was actually signed by UCLA. It\u2019s likely that they\u2019ll be joined by at least two more players, with a center and a small forward believed to be the primary targets so the initial group can have one player at every primary position. It is very similar to recruiting: The G League is identifying top talent and trying to sign those players, much in the same way colleges are. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is us in competition with college basketball,\u201d G League President Shareef Abdur-Rahim said. \u201cFor those young men who are looking for alternatives to the natural route, we\u2019re offering an alternative that we believe will be a good program for them.\u201d But in many respects, this very much seems like it will be the G League competing with the NCAA \u2014 at least for the elite players. Green, a person with knowledge of his deal who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because it has not been released publicly, signed a contract that could exceed $1 million when factoring in all available possibilities. The person said the deal includes a college scholarship, which the G League will provide if he chooses to attend school again at some point. That\u2019s big money: The G League was initially planning to offer $125,000 salaries in this program, and most G League players are making just below $40,000. And colleges, which can pay players through stipends and other allowances, simply cannot keep up \u2014 not within NCAA guidelines, anyway. \u201cIf it was a free market where Jalen could go directly to the NBA, he\u2019d have been a top pick this year,\u201d said longtime agent Aaron Goodwin, who advises Green. \u201cThe G League was prepared to do something that no college could do \u2026 center a program around his development. They saw that and the college coaches couldn\u2019t offer that.\u201d There are some who would argue that losing a handful of players \u2014 even elite ones \u2014 won\u2019t hurt college basketball too much. There were 4,806 players who appeared in at least one Division I men\u2019s game this season, and someone will happily take the spots that Green, Todd and Nix would have had on the Memphis, Michigan and UCLA rosters. But even Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski has been sounding the alarm on looming changes for several months, citing the rate of attrition in the college game and saying it \u201ccan\u2019t take that type of a hit\u201d and that \u201cwe have not kept up with it.\u201d And after his team beat Georgia Tech this past season, Krzyzewski likened what\u2019s happening in college basketball to a scene in a Western \u2014 where a cowboy loses the reins on a horse, and the horse just starts to run wild. That\u2019s one of the reasons why Krzyzewski said parity seemed all the rage in college basketball in 2019-20. \u201cIt\u2019s affected our game,\u201d Krzyzewski said. \u201cReally, anybody can win. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s bad. I\u2019m saying that\u2019s what happened. \u2026 If you look at this as a business, the amount of guys going (to the NBA), the amount of guys testing (the NBA waters), the amount of guys transferring, whoa. Whoa. It\u2019s a lot. It\u2019s a lot.\u201d There are many details of the G League plan still being finalized. It\u2019s likely the team will use the Mamba Sports Academy in Southern California its home base, and former NBA coach of the year Sam Mitchell \u2014 who has coached Green in the past on the AAU circuit \u2014 is expected to be part of the coaching staff tasked with working with the group. But the higher salaries and the program specifically designed as a prep school of sorts for the NBA, it made perfect sense to the signees. \u201cI think I would have entered the draft this year if I had the chance to do that,\u201d Todd said. \u201cBecause at the end of the day, ever since I started playing basketball, the goal was always to go to the NBA.\u201d"},{"id":27827,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/qa-spurs-ceo-rc-buford-preparing-all-kind-scenarios","date":"2020-05-01","title":"The Q&A: Spurs executive R.C. Buford says teams have 'every intention' to return to play","content":" SAN ANTONIO \u2014 San Antonio Spurs CEO R.C. Buford spent more than 30 minutes Thursday on a video conference with local media, and made it clear the organization is on board with returning to play as soon as the NBA deems it safe enough. \u201cOur position all along has been we want to do what\u2019s right for the league and for the fans,\u201d Buford said. \u201cI just got off a team presidents\u2019 call before I jumped on with you guys, and every intention is to return to play, and to try to create the best environment we can for the league, and for the fans. We\u2019re all on board for that.\u201d Buford\u2019s video call marked the first time a team official had addressed the media since the NBA suspended the regular season a day after San Antonio\u2019s March 10 win over the Dallas Mavericks at the AT&T Center. Buford also addressed a variety of other subjects, ranging from the team\u2019s preparation for the NBA Draft and virtual workouts and rehabilitation sessions with its current players, not to mention the technological proficiency of Spurs coach Gregg Popovich: Q:You\u2019re sort of coming up on the end of your first year on the job as CEO. Are you still involved on the prospect evaluation side the way you were as this team\u2019s general manager? A: I think we\u2019re all focused on a multitude of issues. First of all, the return to play opportunities for this season, and then supporting the front office and the coaches as I can as we prepare for the Draft, as we prepare for free agency. So, yeah, they\u2019re stuck with me getting in the way I\u2019m sure [in] way too many places. When the league opens back up, are you anticipating fans will be able to attend? We\u2019re having those discussions with the league, and most of those discussions will be league-wide determinations on how we present our games at the point and time when we do present our games. There are committees going on both from the sporting side, from the media side, from the arena operations side, from the ownership side, from team presidents. There\u2019s so much conversation right now about how we can best engage our games and our fans. No decisions have been made. What would be your message to the fans right now sitting in a holding pattern waiting on the NBA to return? I think our message for the fans is the same message that we have for our community and our nation: We miss everybody. I think we\u2019re all probably in that space. This is unchartered territory. We would love to be able to interact with our community in a safe environment. I think the league\u2019s mission is to do that once we have all the information that we need to be able to accomplish that in a way that protects our fans, our players, our staffs, our media, the whole operations that go into how we present our game, how we compete. As the league looks at a potential return, is it too early to tell whether the NBA picks up the season from where it left off or would the end of the regular season be condensed in some form? Until we are clear on the timing for a safe environment, it\u2019s impossible to designate the individual scenarios that might happen. But we\u2019re modeling multiple scenarios that have not only our teams, our league, our players, our media partners, there are multiple people at those tables having those decisions, and we hope we\u2019ll do what\u2019s best for our fans. I think we all know, not only in our community and our region, but around the country and around the world, people are missing sports and we\u2019re missing playing. I think that\u2019s the problem we\u2019re trying to solve. How has the team been able to keep up with the players to keep them prepared to play when the season resumes? Our coaching staff and our performance team were really creative and really proactive early on in this process. The front office, the performance team, and the coaches got together and really systematically set up opportunities that we could get with our guys and help them during this time. We had no idea what we were going into. There\u2019s still a lot of questions that need to be answered around that before there\u2019s a safe environment for our players to get back together. But there have been virtual workouts. [Athletic performance coordinator] Anthony Falsone has been in 15 different garages over the iPads helping guys workout together. We\u2019ve had players in different locations working out together. We\u2019ve had team virtual calls and communications. Getting [Spurs coach Gregg Popovich] on a virtual call was the biggest challenge we\u2019ve faced during the hiatus. But I think our group\u2019s been really creative in keeping the team as connected as we can be, at the same time maintaining safe environments and sheltering from home. Where are the players for the most part, and how do you monitor them health wise during this time? We\u2019re having systematically timed calls with everybody or virtual meetings with everybody. Most of our group is in market. I think we\u2019ve been really fortunate that a big percentage of our group has been in market. We\u2019ve had virtual workouts. We\u2019ve had virtual rehabilitation sessions. So, guys who are fighting through injuries are doing virtual rehabilitation. We\u2019ve had coaching and video sessions. When we\u2019re not all together, I think they\u2019ve done a good job of staying connected. Do you have plans to open the practice facilities once the league actually clears it? We\u2019re gonna make that decision as we get more information, as we have more data around our own local environment as well as the national environment in doing what we can to create a safe place for the team to come back together. We\u2019re not putting any dates on it. It\u2019s gonna be more how we get the information that we need to be comfortable to provide the right atmosphere for our players. What\u2019s been the mindset of the front office as it pertains to preparing for the Draft and free agency? Scenario planning has been really important, and our front office has continued to prepare for the Draft, for free agency, for team building as we normally would be during this time. But there are no target dates, they\u2019re more target responsibilities. We just got the early-entrant candidates list in the last couple of days. That at least gives some kind of clarity on who the draft pool will be. But from there, we don\u2019t have clarity on a Chicago pre-Draft, or medicals or all the things that go along with Draft preparation. It was interesting to watch the NFL Draft and to share some of the learnings that we found observing there depending on where we might find ourselves at a later time. They at least had the opportunity to have their combine before the hiatus started. So, we\u2019re working through the places that we need to fill gaps right now. Isn\u2019t this the time of year the team is doing its usual offseason planning? That planning goes on all the time. But in particular [you\u2019d] just [be getting] through March Madness, the Portsmouth Invitational Tournament is normally in April. You\u2019ve got the Nike Hoops Summit that would be this time [of year], and then early May is when the Draft combine is. So, there\u2019s quite a bit of that that\u2019s gone on during this time of the year. Before this all started, there had been owners discussing changes to the NBA calendar long term. Any chance that could be considered moving forward, that the whole NBA calendar could be permanently changed? Those are decisions that will be made at a league level. There are all kinds of discussions going on now. But we recognize whatever decisions we make currently are going to have an impact on more than just the current season. They\u2019re modeling significant scenarios. There are media partners that have an influence in those decisions as well as teams and league personnel. The Players Association would have opinions around that. So those scenarios are being modeled. The decisions will be made ultimately by the Board of Governors. The one thing I would say though: From now on, I\u2019m doing our Draft on [Dallas Cowboys owner] Jerry [Jones\u2019] boat. Do you have a boat? Not like that. I\u2019ve got a little boat that you float in your bathtub. You mentioned earlier that the Spurs would like to return to play when it\u2019s safe, but what\u2019s the concern level from players in terms of how long it would take for them to ramp up to getting back into full competitive mode after being off so long? You\u2019re asking about issues that we\u2019ve been ideating about for a month. I\u2019ve been included on a competition advisory group, and that\u2019s a big point of emphasis for that group: How can we create an environment that is safe for our players to return to play in? And that\u2019s not just COVID-[19] related. Even in past times where there might have been a lockout, players were able to get together and practice. Where we sit right now, this is uncharted territory. I would guess that there are many of these guys that have never gone two months without being able to get into a gym. That\u2019s the feedback that we\u2019ve gotten, not only within our team, but across the league in the conversations. Can you imagine Manu [Ginobili] not playing for two months? I just use him as an example, but I know [in] conversations with Dejounte [Murray], Lonnie [Walker IV], Derrick [White] and the whole crew [that] everybody\u2019s dying to get in and dribble a ball. But I do think that we can\u2019t just blow a whistle and 10 days later think that we\u2019re gonna put our players in an environment that is safe to return from the time that they\u2019ve had away. Early in this shutdown, the ownership group announced plans to continue paying the hourly employees through the end of the season. Does that continue into May or is it something the organization is still weighing? We took care of the staff through the end of the season. Has the organization had to put employees on furloughs, reduced pay or have there been any reductions in work force? If not, how has the organization avoided that? I\u2019m not an accountant, so I can\u2019t tell you how we\u2019ve avoided it. But we have not made any staffing changes at this time. We think we\u2019ll continue to review the realities of the situation as we go forward. How have you approached the process so far with prospects since you can\u2019t actually meet with them the way the team did in years past? We\u2019ve been active participants in the strategic conversations with the league on how this can happen, when it happens best. There is a large group of players, the early-entry candidates, that we\u2019re not allowed to have any contact with until the announcement of the candidates, which just happened this week. There are the senior candidates that are already eligible for the Draft that were available for virtual interviews. So, it\u2019s really probably gonna be a staged process. We still don\u2019t have a solution around medicals and in-person activation at all. But it\u2019s not just our industry, it\u2019s the world. How do virtual workouts work? Is the entire team on the same Zoom call? Maybe not the whole team. I don\u2019t know if we can get a dozen guys, but we\u2019re bringing groups together, a lot of them in their garages or their living rooms that have turned into a gym now. It\u2019s really just a virtual conversation with Anthony Falsone going crazy. How much has Pop\u2019s technological literacy improved during the last month or so? I know he knows how to use a cell phone still. I\u2019m not sure outside of that. But he has gotten on to a virtual call, or multiple virtual calls. I\u2019ll let you ask him that when we get him back in the gym. What\u2019s been the most enjoyable thing the team has done as a group through all this? Would you say the morale is still good through all of this? This is something that has just a tendency to bring people together. I don\u2019t know that we could\u2019ve asked for a group that has stayed committed to each other like this group has. I think the influences of our coaches, our performance team in being proactive and getting ahead of the activities that we needed to take care of to put these guys in the best position, and then their love of the game and their love of the fans, I think, it\u2019s been fun to see them engage with our community in their own way virtually. I would bet it also has created internal drive to be able to get together as a team. When you play a game one night, and the next night you\u2019re all sent home, that really has a way of wanting to bring you back together. * * * Michael C. Wright is a senior writer for NBA.com.

With the release of his first book \u2014 \u201cTogether: The Healing Power of Human Connection in a Sometimes Lonely World\u201d \u2014 on April 28, Dr. Murthy explores how loneliness is a key factor in many mental and physical illnesses in this country and around the world. Dr. Murthy spoke with NBA.com\u2019s Brian Martin about some of the key takeaways from the book, the importance of recognizing loneliness during the current COVID-19 pandemic and ways to strengthen human connection even during a time of social distancing. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. * * * Why did you feel it was important to write a book about loneliness? When I was Surgeon General, I spent a lot of time talking to people in living rooms and town halls all across the country, and one of the things I started to notice was that behind many of the stories of addiction, violence, depression and anxiety were threads of loneliness. People would say things like \u2018I feel like we\u2019ve got to deal with all of these problems on our own\u2019, or \u2018I feel that if I disappear tomorrow nobody would even notice\u2019, or \u2018I feel like I\u2019m invisible.\u2019 This kept coming up again and again whether I was talking to people in small fishing villages in Alaska, members of congress in DC, or parents in small towns in the Midwest. There was this deeper emotional pain that was often manifest as loneliness. These conversations reminded me of two things: one was my own personal experiences struggling with loneliness, and the second was my experience in medicine, where I saw many patients come into the hospital all alone. Even at critical moments such as a major diagnosis or a key decision about treatment, these patients had no one they could call. And even at the time of death, I remember instances when my colleagues and I were the only ones to witness their passing. I was reminded of these experiences during my travels as Surgeon General. I recognized that what I was seeing across America was part of a much broader wave of loneliness that people in the United States and around the world were experiencing. How do you define loneliness? Is this something that only emerges when we are physically alone or can we experience loneliness when in the company of others? Loneliness is different than isolation and solitude. Loneliness is a subjective feeling where the connections we need are greater than the connections we have. In the gap, we experience loneliness. It\u2019s distinct from the objective state of isolation, which is determined by the number of people around you. You can be surrounded by many people but still feel quite lonely if you don\u2019t have strong connections and if you feel you can\u2019t be yourself with them. Conversely, you can just be around a few people, but feel deeply connected to them. There\u2019s been a greater focus on mental health in recent years, but what is it about our current society that has contributed to the increased prevalence of loneliness specifically? There are several factors in modern society that contribute to loneliness. One is that we are more mobile than we have been in decades past, which is fantastic in many respects, but also leads to us to move away from communities that we grew up with and got to know over time. The second factor has to do with how we use technology. Technology can help or hinder connection depending on how we us it. For example, if I use FaceTime to communicate with my family in India, then that may enable me to strengthen my connection with them. If I post on Facebook or on another social media platform that I\u2019m coming to California and want to meet up with any friends who are available for lunch or dinner and we actually meet up, then that online to offline bridge can be fantastic for strengthening our connection with each other. The challenge with technology is when we use it in ways that take away from the quality of in-person interaction. What I worry about is the sheer quantity of screen time; sometimes it edges out our time in person with people. And even when we are in person, technology can often dilute the quality of our conversation. Our cell phones readily creep into our dinner time conversations. When we\u2019re on the phone catching up with our friends, we might find ourselves flipping through our feed on Instagram, or refreshing our inbox, or Googling the answer to a question that just popped into our heads. We might think we\u2019re still being attentive, but the science is very clear that human beings are not good at multitasking. What we do is task switch. When our attention is on our Instagram feed, it is not on the conversation we\u2019re having. We may be able to remember the words that were said, but words alone are not the full extent of what constitutes communication between two people. We miss the way in which the words were said and the meaning behind those words. A big concern I have with young people and social media platforms is that it can accelerate the culture of comparison in modern society, a culture where we constantly feel that we\u2019re not enough \u2013 not fit enough, not good looking enough, not rich enough, not famous enough, not athletic enough \u2013 you name it. We feel like we\u2019re always chasing an ideal. That ideal is usually framed for us through the media we consume, and it is accelerated on social media platforms, which deliver messages at a speed that we have not seen before. When you\u2019re constantly bombarded with messages that tell you about all the ways that you are not enough, that can chip away at your sense of self and self-esteem. And when you\u2019re at a place where you feel like you\u2019re not enough, where you\u2019re disconnected from your source of self worth, then that can actually make it harder to connect with other people. Perhaps the most insidious and challenging driver of loneliness has to do with modern day culture and how we determine what constitutes success. If I asked you what your top three priorities were in life, my guess is that people and most likely your family and close friends would top that list. But if you look at the way a lot of us live our lives, and I\u2019ll use myself as a prime example, there\u2019s a disconnect between our stated priorities and our lived priorities. If I look at where I put the majority of my time, focus and energy, it is overwhelmingly on work and other concerns, even though I deeply value the people in my life. It\u2019s not to say that I need to be spending the majority of my waking hours with the people I love, but it\u2019s about the quality and quantity of the time; it\u2019s about the energy and focus and attention that you bring to your interactions, so one of the things that I realized is that I need to close that gap in my life. I think many people today grow up receiving the message that success is not determined by your ability to build good relationships with friends and family, but rather on your ability to acquire one of three things: wealth, reputation or power. It\u2019s ironic to me that when I meet people who have achieved in those areas \u2013 and in some cases in all three \u2013 if they don\u2019t have strong relationships in their life, the high of those successes doesn\u2019t last very long, and they often feel quite hollow and quite lonely. All of these factors together are what contribute to loneliness in the modern age. As you can see it\u2019s complicated and cannot be solved by changing one policy or one habit. In general, what are the physical and mental effects of loneliness? Researchers have found that loneliness is associated with an increased risk of heart disease, dementia, depression and anxiety. It\u2019s associated with fragmented sleep, so you may sleep the same number of hours as somebody who\u2019s not dealing with chronic loneliness, but the quality of that sleep is lower; it\u2019s less restful. And we know how important sleep is for our overall health. It also turns out that people that suffer from loneliness appear to have shorter lifespans. The mortality impact of loneliness seems to be similar to the mortality of smoking 15 cigarettes a day, greater than the mortality impact of obesity and sedentary living. I say that as someone who served in a position as Surgeon General in an office that spent an extraordinary amount of time and resources focused on smoking, obesity, physical activity and sedentary living. Yet loneliness was not really on the radar much at all because few of us recognized that this was a significant health challenge, but it turns out that is really is. What are the specific effects for young people? While these effects I\u2019m talking about are true for all of, I particularly worry about loneliness with young people for a couple reasons. First, contrary to most people\u2019s assumptions that loneliness predominantly affects the elderly, it turns out that one of the greatest spikes in loneliness that we see across the age span takes place among young people \u2014 Gen Z and the Millennials. This is counterintuitive for people who may think that the young are connected to others on technology and always seem to be engaged with other people. How could they be lonely? That comes back to what we talked about earlier: it\u2019s about the quality of connections that matter, and sometimes if we use technology in ways that either edge out in-person relationships or dilute our connections or chip away at our self esteem, then it can ultimately harm the ability to connect with others. I also worry when I see the high rates of depression and anxiety among young people. I\u2019m worried that part of the reason we see growing concerns with the mental health of younger generations is the quality of social connection that they are experiencing. One of the key realizations that has stood out for me during my exploration of loneliness is that social connection is an extraordinary resource for improving our health, enhancing our performance and increasing our fulfillment. It\u2019s a resource that we often overlook. As a doctor who has written prescriptions for many powerful medications over the years, I know that science has blessed us with tools that can help improve our health, but that doesn\u2019t mean that we should forget the old resources that we have. Human connection has always been as a powerful resource for us, but it has receded to the background as a tool that is useful for improving our health and our performance. The truth is that social connection is extraordinarily powerful. I realized when I was working on this book that if we really want to address some of the major issues that are confronting society today \u2014 like the addiction crisis, violence, and chronic disease \u2014 if we really want to improve how people are functioning in schools, in the workplace and with their families, we\u2019ve got to think about how we invest in strengthening social connection. What should we be concerned about or particularly focused on in regard to loneliness and mental health generally in the context of the current global pandemic? This is such an extraordinary and difficult time. We will remember what we went through with COVID-19 for the rest of our lives. What I worry about is that as we continue to be physically distanced from each other, that will deepen our loneliness and will potentially lead to a social recession, where we become further and further separated from each other, not just physically but also emotionally. I think that would have serious implications for the health of individuals and the health of society. But we have a choice about whether we go down that path of a social recession, or whether we use this moment to strengthen our social connection. From my own experience during this time, I\u2019ve realized that I not only miss being physically present with my close friends, but I miss basic interactions with strangers at a coffee shop or in the grocery store aisle. I find that when I\u2019m on a walk in the neighborhood, when I pass somebody, who inevitably stays at least six feet away, that they wave vigorously and enthusiastically, and I find myself waving right back enthusiastically because we\u2019re both hungry for company, for being beside another human being. When I think about the experience even over the past few weeks, I recognize that I have not been giving the time, but also the quality of time to my friends and family that I want to be giving and I want to recommit to doing better. And that can start right now; we can take some simple steps that can help us strengthen our connection with other people even when we are physically distanced. We can make it a point to eliminate distraction when we\u2019re talking with others. I\u2019ve been struck in my own life \u2026 how powerful it can be when someone listens to you and they\u2019re fully present in conversation? Imagine being able to give somebody else the gift of your full attention, of being able to share with them openly and to be present fully with them and you start to realize that five minutes of that kind of engagement can often be more fulfilling and more healing than 30 minutes of distracted conversation. One of the realizations I had in writing the book was that service is a powerful antidote to loneliness. I think the time of COVID-19 presents an opportunity for all of us to find ways to serve others. Service could be checking on a neighbor to make sure they\u2019re doing okay, calling a friend whom you know is struggling, or dropping food off to a work colleague who may be having a hard time teleworking and homeschooling their kids at the same time. There are many ways in which we can serve, and this is a particular moment where if we look around us, we\u2019ll realize that all of us are going through challenging times, that all of us are hurting in some way and are struggling to make sense of not just what\u2019s happening now, but also the uncertainty of what lies ahead. So in an environment like this, simply reaching out to others to check on them, simply giving them the gift of our attention and presence, can be acts of service that ultimately strengthen our connection to others. The NBA family (like our global community) is varied and diverse, and this pandemic is impacting communities in different ways. What concerns you most about recent data that shows the pandemic is most severely affecting black and Hispanic communities specifically? It\u2019s deeply concerning because it follows a pattern where minorities and groups that have traditionally been underserved in society continually bear the greater burden of major stressors, whether those are pandemics or natural or man-made disasters. What COVID-19 has done is pull the curtain back on deeper structural inequities that have existed in our system for far too long. We know that in the United States, for example, that black and Hispanic families suffer with a greater degree of poverty than do their white counterparts. We know they experience disease \u2014 like heart disease and diabetes \u2014 at greater rates, and we also know that this is not all about genetics, it\u2019s about social determinants. It\u2019s about poverty, access to health care, access to healthy food, access to education and well-paying jobs. It\u2019s a very complicated web, but it has to do with structural factors that drive so many downstream outcomes that we care about, including health. When stressors like this get applied to society, we start to see where we have failed in supporting segments of our community, which often are minority communities. Unfortunately we\u2019re seeing that now and it\u2019s heartbreaking, but it should be a call to action for all of us to ensure that health equity is a guiding principle in how we design our health policies and how we run our health care institutions and how we think about public health and prevention. Unless we\u2019re making sure that everybody has access to good health and the tools to live a healthy life, then I don\u2019t think we\u2019re doing our job in society. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re fulfilling our responsibility to each other, and that\u2019s the message I\u2019d take away from these terrible inequities that we\u2019re seeing when it comes to the COVID-19 outcomes. For the millions of people around the world who play and watch, sports can provide a sense of community and belonging and also serve as an outlet for stress and anxiety. How can we fill that void and stay connected in this time of physical distancing and sometimes, reduced physical activity? As a sports fan, I miss sports a lot. Sports are an incredibly important part of community and I\u2019m really hopeful that we\u2019ll be able to get back to experience sports in the way we did before. But in this time, it\u2019s especially important that we reach out and stay connected to the people in our lives, to our friends, to our family, even some we may not have been in touch with for a long time. In addition, physical activity is exceedingly important, not just for our physical health but also for our mental well-being. One of my concerns is that as people stay at home and as they find themselves on video conference calls for hours and hours throughout the day that they may not be getting as much physical activity as they normally get. It\u2019s important in this time to see if you can build activity into your life, both your social and work life. While you may have to do some calls by video conference, if you can do others by phone so you can be walking while you do them, that\u2019s great. If you can work out with a friend while you\u2019re on the phone with them that\u2019s good too. If you can do virtual dance parties, as I\u2019ve found a growing number of friends and work colleagues doing, as ways to substitute what used to be coffee breaks, that\u2019s a creative way to be social and also be physically active. This is really important because when we come out of this pandemic, when we start to resume our lives, we need to be healthy \u2014 both physically and mentally \u2014 and the measures we take now to stay socially connected to each other and stay physically active will keep us in better shape so we\u2019re more readily able to get back on track once the pandemic is over. What do you hope people learn or takeaway from reading the book? I thought about this so much as I was writing the book, and it really only became totally clear to me at the end. If I had a credo for this book it would be three simple words: put people first. One of the things I learned is that we are social beings that derive so much from our relationships with others, but we have drifted further and further away from relationships \u2014 and we\u2019ve done so at the expense of our health, our happiness and overall well-being. In the absence of strong relationships, our ability to talk to each other breaks down. We become more divided. Our ability to show up fully and demonstrate our full potential in the workplace or in school is diminished. And our overall health and happiness on an individual level is compromised. And that\u2019s why, as I left my time in government and began to think about what I could work on that would address the deeper root cause of so much of what ails us, I kept coming back to this issue of loneliness and social connection. As common as loneliness is, as consequential as it is, I ultimately am optimistic of our ability to build people-centered lives and a people-centered society because this is how we evolved to be. This is really who we are. We\u2019re social beings. We\u2019re people-oriented creatures, and we seek out relationships. To me, this quest to build a people-centered life is not an effort to transform us into something we\u2019re not, but it\u2019s really a call to return us to who we really are. If we have concerns about someone in our personal lives, concerns that they may be feeling lonely or isolated, what can we do to engage them? Given how common loneliness is, it\u2019s exceedingly likely that we all know people who are lonely even if they don\u2019t express that to us. One of the most important things we can do for others who are lonely is simply to show up in their lives, to ask them how they are doing, to spend time with them, give them our full attention, sharing ourselves and being open and vulnerable. These are all key components to strengthening our connection with others and helping them feel seen and valued. It\u2019s not easy to be vulnerable in the modern world where displaying emotion is often equated with weakness. But the reality is that we\u2019re all struggling in some way, in some portion of our life. We may not talk about it, and we may be ashamed about it, but it\u2019s true. In those unguarded moments where we\u2019re able to open up and be honest with others about what we\u2019re dealing with, we often find that it not only makes us feel better, but it also empowers them to be open and vulnerable as well. That\u2019s one of the great gifts you can give someone else too: that permission to share and to feel, and you can do that by demonstrating that yourself. As we look ahead to Mental Health Awareness month, is there anything you\u2019d like to share or a closing message that you would like to leave with us? I would simply say that our mental health is as important as our physical health and that we\u2019re mental, emotional and physical beings. Our mental and physical health are deeply connected to each other so you cannot be healthy without being both mentally healthy and physically healthy. The truth is that we all have struggles from time to time when it comes to our mental health. If we recognize that, it will make it make it easier for people to come forward and to share when they\u2019re struggling as well. We\u2019ve got to make it clear that talking about your mental health challenges is not a sign of weakness, it\u2019s a source of strength. It\u2019s a demonstration that you recognize that all of us are vulnerable when it comes to our health, and it\u2019s a demonstration that you have the courage to stand up and to share what you\u2019re going through. I really applaud people in sports that are standing up and openly sharing what they are dealing with in terms of their mental health challenges. They give courage to the rest of us to be open as well. A big part of addressing mental health challenges has to do with removing that stigma around mental illness, and it has to do with building relationships, recognizing that our social connections to each other are an extraordinary source of healing both for our mental and physical health."},{"id":27784,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/ap-lebron-james-honor-class-2020","date":"2020-04-30","title":"LeBron James to honor Class of 2020 with all-star event","content":" NEW YORK \u2014 LeBron James is putting together an all-star event to honor and celebrate the high school class of 2020, which has had its graduation season upended by the coronavirus pandemic.

The long layoff since Golden State\u2019s last game on March 10, however, has left Warriors coach Steve Kerr feeling like 2019-20 is already over. Kerr said Tuesday in an hour-long video conference call in conjunction with the University of San Francisco that he can place how he\u2019s feeling about the season these days. \u201cIt feels like the offseason,\u201d Kerr said , per The Mercury News . \u201cAnd in fact we had a Zoom call, (general manager) Bob Myers and I got on a Zoom with our players, our whole roster last week. And it was just a chance to check in, but it was also a chance for Bob to update the players on his contact with the league and the latest news, but it also kind of felt like our annual team exit meeting. \u201cOur coaching staff and I have been undergoing staff evaluations, offseason plans, so we are absolutely in offseason mode right now. However, Kerr and his staff are not fully embracing this \u201coffseason mode\u201d, even as it seems to be the prevailing mood. https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/watch\/live\/?v \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing now is planning for that moment when our practice facility is opened back up,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cOnce that happens, we want to be ready with a plan. And the plan has to include all the guidelines that will be put in place. \u2026 We\u2019ve got to have all the safety and health precautions mapped out.\u201d Granted, Golden State\u2019s season has not been on par with its previous five campaigns in which it reached The Finals. At 15-50, the Warriors have the worst record in both the Western Conference and the NBA and are on pace for their worst season since a 19-63 finish in 1999-2000. Injuries sacked the Warriors\u2019 hopes in 2019-20, as All-Stars Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson were injured for either part or all of the season. Kerr said the season\u2019s hiatus was a little easier to handle given the Warriors\u2019 current plight, but said he spoke with other coaches on teams in a different state than his. \u201cThe suspension came at an interesting time, and it really made a difference, depending on where your team stood in the standings,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cSo I\u2019ve talked to some of my fellow coaches who are coaching teams that are right in the thick of the playoff hunt. They\u2019re trying desperately to stay in touch with their team, some of them are even doing group workouts on Zoom with their training staff, and they\u2019re trying to find hoops for their players to shoot at where they\u2019re able to do so. \u201cIt\u2019s different for us because we were down to 17 games, but we were out of the playoffs. It feels like the end of the season for our team. It just does.\u201d Tuesday\u2019s call, led by basketball Hall of Famer Jennifer Azzi, included Warriors president and COO Rick Welts, who outlined how he has been trying to stay in contact with his employees since the season stopped. That has included virtual town hall meetings that have included guests like Kerr, NBA commissioner Adam Silver, and Warriors owners Peter Guber and Joe Lacob. \u201cWe have a lot of 20-somethings who are living alone right now, who aren\u2019t like Steve or me, when we\u2019re home with our families every day and have some space, but are really isolated socially,\u201d Welts said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of the untold story, I think, we focus on the truly medical side of the virus. The mental health side, I think, is increasingly important to address because we as human beings, we were not wired to operate this way. And you can start to see the frustration that people are having in following guidelines as best we can, but we need more than that as human beings.\u201d The season hiatus has not been all negatives for Kerr, though. Given the Warriors\u2019 record, they figure to have a top pick in the 2020 NBA Draft and Kerr said he and his staff are trying to look ahead to 2020-21, regardless of what happens to the rest of the 2019-20 campaign. \u201cI think what we\u2019ve tried to do as a staff is take more time than we\u2019ve ever had before to really self-reflect, to really examine what we\u2019ve done, what we\u2019d like to do going forward,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re in a pretty unique position because we\u2019ve come off an incredible five-year run and then this season, where we had the worst record in the NBA and we went through all kinds of injuries and everything else. And so this whole experience, this last six years for us, as a coaching staff, as an organization, we\u2019ve pretty much seen everything, and yet what I realize now is very rarely have we had the chance to actually sit down and examine everything.\u201d The NBA announced on Monday that May 8 would be the earliest it would allow limited workouts at team facilities in select cities. And when those facilities reopen, the rules will be strict. The May 8 date is far from firm, the NBA said, warning teams that it \u201cmay push this timing back if developments warrant.\u201d The league planned on giving teams the option of reopening facilities as early as Friday, though ultimately decided more time was needed across the league for many reasons.

The Lakers applied for the loan under the Small Business Administration\u2019s Paycheck Protection Program, a part of the federal government\u2019s $2.2 trillion stimulus package. The Lakers\u2019 request was granted in the first round of distribution, but after the fund ran out of money in less than two weeks, the team returned its loan, as did several wealthier business including Shake Shack and AutoNation. The Lakers issued a statement Monday confirming what happened. \u201cThe Lakers qualified for and received a loan under the Payroll Protection Program,\u201d the statement read. \u201cHowever, once we found out the funds from the program had been depleted, we repaid the loan so that financial support would be directed to those most in need.

The Treasury Department issued further guidance for the loan program last week, asking companies not to apply for the funds if they don\u2019t need the cash to survive. The Lakers qualified for the program because they have only about 300 employees. But the team is thought to be the NBA\u2019s second-most valuable franchise, with Forbes estimating a value of roughly $4 billion. The 16-time NBA champions play in the nation\u2019s second-largest media market, and their current roster led by superstars LeBron James and Antony Davis was on top of the Western Conference when the NBA suspended play last month.

He had flamed out in Detroit, a ball of emotions for whom Pistons teammates and coach genuinely were worried. Traded to San Antonio, Rodman entered a new phase: \u201cDemolition Man\u201d-inspired blond mohawk, enough tattoos for a carnival midway and a habit of checking into games before lacing up his sneakers. He spent one season, 1993-94, indulged by coach John Lucas and misbehaving his way to fines and suspensions. Rodman spent the next seriously chafing with coach Bob Hill \u2014 at whom Rodman allegedly threw a bag of ice one night \u2014 and then-Spurs general manager Gregg Popovich. So when the Chicago Bulls decided to add Rodman for 1995-96 in the role played by Horace Grant in the franchise\u2019s first three-peat, it smacked of desperation. Expecting the great Michael Jordan, coaching mastermind Phil Jackson and sensitive sidekick Scottie Pippen to nurse-maid the unpredictable and attention-starved Rodman seemed a tall task, one that could backfire during their quest to resume winning NBA titles. Then there was Rodman\u2019s record with the Pistons, a rival that had tormented and physically ambushed the Bulls postseason after postseason. But as we learned \u2014 or were reminded \u2014 in Episode 3 of \u201cThe Last Dance,\u201d Chicago knew what it was getting and accepted the combination of TLC, tough love and a leash of ever-changing length required to keep Rodman around and involved. Jackson had a pet project upon whom to work his Zen Buddhism and Native American psychological coaching ways. Jordan and Pippen seemed almost to welcome Rodman\u2019s energy as a change in the dynamic. Rodman? He probably could not have focused and behaved long enough to play for any of the league\u2019s other 28 teams at the time. But joining the Bulls\u2019 rock-star tour and kicking it to a new level, that suited him. And they won. And won. And won. As Pippen put it, Rodman fit \u201clike a hand in a glove.\u201d \u2026 Even when that glove would lose itself on a 48-hour bender in Las Vegas and need to be retrieved out of a hotel room with actress\/model Carmen Electra by Jordan himself. You can find plenty of videos online that capture the physical play in the NBA in the 1980s, some little more than a tightly edited montage of \u201cBang!\u201d \u201cOof!\u201d and \u201cPow!\u201d moments. All the highlights are there, from Kevin McHale\u2019s clothesline takedown of Kurt Rambis, to Julius Erving and Larry Bird grabbing each other by the throat, to Robert Parish\u2019s beatdown of Bill Laimbeer that wasn\u2019t even called a foul. No one did the rough stuff better than Detroit\u2019s \u201cBad Boys,\u201d of course, and they saved their nastiest for Jordan. About the only thing the Pistons did not do was undercut Jordan when he was three or four feet off the court. Otherwise, everything went. Elbows after whistles, shoves in the small of his back, whacks across the head or neck, Detroit put the wood to Jordan like Walmart shoppers as the doors open on Black Friday.  \u201cEvery time he goes to the basket, put him on the ground,\u201d Rodman reflected. \u201cWe tried to physically hurt Michael.\u201d That Jordan avoided a career-crippling injury through the abuse was astounding. But he did way more than that, committing to strength workouts to add muscle so he could \u201cadminister pain\u201d rather than merely absorbing it. Now imagine, under today\u2019s rules, the Pistons or any other team in the NBA dishing out to LeBron James or Steph Curry what the \u201cBad Boys\u201d got away with against Jordan. It might end careers, all right \u2014 of the perpetrators. Collins coached the Bulls for three seasons, replacing Stan Albeck in 1986 and yielding to Phil Jackson in 1989. He played a pivotal role in Jordan\u2019s saga as a coach he so appreciated that Jordan made sure Collins was on the bench for those final two seasons in Washington. Collins\u2019 passionate style and grasp of the game were assets \u2014 until they weren\u2019t. In \u201cThe Last Dance,\u201d it seems as simple as the Bulls maxing out under Collins, but failing to get past Detroit. It\u2019s a scenario not unlike Toronto butting heads with LeBron James every spring, to the point Raptors management fired Dwane Casey after his Coach of the Year season to promote Nick Nurse. There was a little more to it, though, with Collins\u2019 departure from the Bulls. Chairman Jerry Reinsdorf was the boss behind the heave-ho, and former Chicago Tribune beat man Sam Smith wrote an analysis days later that spelled out some of the reasons: The Bulls majority owner nearly hired Collins again in 2008, and has employed him as a consultant in recent seasons. But Reinsdorf pre-empted what he felt was his coach spinning out of control and avoided yet another possible setback to the Jordan express. Heck, Jordan said in Sunday night\u2019s episodes that sweeping Detroit to reach the 1991 Finals might have felt better than winning the championship a couple weeks later. The joy so evident after Chicago beat Magic Johnson\u2019s Lakers for the franchise\u2019s first title clearly is missing in what we\u2019ve seen so far of that 1997-98 swan slog. We go from watching Jerry Krause dancing in the aisle of the team plane home from Detroit to seeing Krause drop another turd in the punch bowl when he reminds the sports world who\u2019s in charge come February 1998. \u201cIf Michael chooses to leave because there is another coach here, then it is his choice, not ours,\u201d Krause was quoted in the Chicago Tribune while the team was prepping for a Finals preview in Salt Lake City. Leave it to good ol\u2019 Hubie Brown, who counters while working the TNT telecast that night: \u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s very cold. It\u2019s sad. And if you really think about this, performance and loyalty by the coaches and players are being just thrown out the window.\u201d Don\u2019t panic, you didn\u2019t nod off and miss this Sunday night. It must have wound up on the cutting room floor, but it\u2019s remembered by fans of the Timberwolves as the first time their team beat Jordan\u2019s Bulls after an 0-16 start to the series (Jordan scorched the Wolves for 45 points at the Metrodome in Minnesota\u2019s first-ever home game in November 1989). But Minnesota\u2019s 99-95 victory on Dec. 30, 1997 deserves an asterisk of epic proportions, because of the crank phone call made to the Target Center switchboard claiming Jordan\u2019s mother Deloris had been hospitalized. The caller, saying he was Jordan\u2019s brother Larry, left the message in the first half. Jordan was informed at halftime and missed the first 3:14 of the third quarter before he was able to verify that his mother was fine and his brother had not called. The hoax rattled Jordan, and he missed all five of his shots in the third. Minnesota outscored the Bulls 52-39 in the second half as Kevin Garnett, Stephon Marbury and Tom Gugliotta combined for 66 points. \u201cIt was one of those things that you don\u2019t want to just let it fall by the wayside. Anything can happen,\u201d said Jordan, whose father James had been slain in 1993. Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski and NBC Sports Chicago\u2019s K.C. Johnson reported early Monday morning that Chicago has come to terms with Philadephia 76ers Vice President of Player Personnel Marc Eversley, who will join Arturas Karnisovas in a reshaped front office aiming to turn around the Bulls. Once the move becomes official, Eversley will become the first black general manager in Bulls history. Chicago previously had seen former Bulls players B.J. Armstrong and Randy Brown hold assistant general manager roles years ago. Eversley joined the 76ers front office in 2016, helping turn Philadelphia into a playoff contender. He was part of the group that acquired J.J. Redick, Jimmy Butler and Tobias Harris, additions that helped the 76ers extend eventual champion Toronto to Game 7 of the 2019 Eastern Conference semifinals. Since taking over as Chicago\u2019s executive vice president of basketball operations in mid-April , Karnisovas has been busy. He reached agreements with former Pelicans front office official J.J. Polk to become the Bulls\u2019 assistant general manager and for Pat Connelly to join the team as vice president of player personnel, Wojnarowski and Johnson both report. Before working in front-office roles with the Sixers, Eversley spent time with the Washington Wizards and Toronto Raptors and worked at Nike for a decade. The Bulls came into the season thinking they were poised to contend for a playoff spot. Instead, they were 11th in the Eastern Conference at 22-43 and on the way to their third straight losing record when the NBA suspended play because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Now that his general manager is in place, Karnisovas has another important decision to make. That would be whether to keep coach Jim Boylen. With a 39-84 record since replacing Fred Hoiberg early last year, he could be on shaky ground. Though Zach LaVine was averaging a career-high 25.5 points, Lauri Markkanen\u2019s scoring and rebounding dipped in his third season. The 7-footer from Finland was averaging 14.7 points and 6.3 rebounds \u2014 down from 18.7 and 9.0.

Later that year, Cooper, Earl Lloyd and Nat \u201cSweetwater\u201d Clifton would break the NBA color barrier and lay the groundwork for a league that welcomes all players, from all backgrounds, from all around the world. To celebrate this anniversary, Cooper\u2019s son Chuck Cooper III has co-authored a new book about his father\u2019s life, retracing his journey from winning state titles in high school, to playing collegiately at Duquesne, to his professional career in the NBA, all of which culminated in an enshrinement into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2019. Cooper III spoke with NBA.com\u2019s Brian Martin about the importance of preserving his father\u2019s legacy through this book and his work with the Chuck Cooper Foundation. * * * Why was it important for you to write this book and what do you hope people take away from reading it? I\u2019m so excited to finally get the opportunity to tell my dad\u2019s story, from start to finish.  First, I think the story of my father all the early African-American pioneers of the NBA \u2014 which are all mentioned in the book \u2014 the story is really underappreciated. When people do think about them, I don\u2019t think they get credit for being the tremendous ball players that they were. When my father came out of Duquesne University, he was a consensus All-American, only the second consensus African-American All-American in the history of college basketball; the first being Don Barksdale, and the second my father and Sherman White out of LIU. Many people think it was a surprise when the Celtics took my dad with the 14th overall pick in the NBA Draft, but after his junior year he was offered contracts with the Chicago Stags, the New York Knicks and the Harlem Globetrotters, so he was someone that was on the national map already. At that time, the biggest games were being played at Madison Square Garden with the top college teams drawing 18,000 fans. My father\u2019s best games were at The Garden, and he was voted during his senior year as the second best player to play in The Garden. Then after the NIT Tournament, it was reported that if they took the vote at that moment, he would have been the top visiting player to play in The Garden. Even after basketball, he went on to accomplish great things. He has a legacy of firsts; not only was he the first African-American drafted into the NBA, but he became the first department head for the city of Pittsburgh when he was appointed Director of Parks and Recreation. He later became Pittsburgh National Bank\u2019s first Urban Affairs officer, where he put community banking on the map, with some of the practices he did to develop the communities were adopted across the country. Today marks the 70th anniversary of your father being drafted by the Celtics. What does that moment mean to you? I\u2019m incredibly proud. I know it\u2019s something that he was very proud of himself. It really indicated how great of a player he was. Whenever you\u2019re a trailblazer and you\u2019re the first \u2014 even in today\u2019s world, when you\u2019re an African-American you have to be better to get that position, to get that job. It just validates how great a player he was and we\u2019re incredibly proud and to be able to honor this great American sports history with a book, I\u2019m almost at a loss for words. I\u2019m just grateful. What did your father tell you about those times, when he entered the NBA back in 1950 and the challenges he faced being one of the first African-American players in the league? It was tough. He always said the NBA was ready to integrate in 1950 but they weren\u2019t ready for a black star. He was someone that was extremely confident in his abilities, so it was tough because he thought he could have put up better numbers and been more of a focal point with the teams he played for. But at the same time, he was incredibly grateful to the Celtics organization. I always tell people, when you look at how Jackie Robinson was treated, Jackie didn\u2019t even get support from people on his own team, where the Celtics, with owner Walter Brown and coach Red Auerbach, made sure that my father was treated with dignity and respect and then he developed a great friendship with Bob Cousy and many of the players. So from that perspective, he was supported by his team, so he had a much easier time than Jackie Robinson, but it was tough for those guys. In talking with Bob Cousy, he said that my father and Barksdale were some of the original athletes, precursors to the modern-day small forwards in today\u2019s game. When you watch his highlight reel, you see he\u2019s a right-handed player and he\u2019s shooting a spinning left-hand hook shot, he\u2019s crossing over, he\u2019s finger rolling, he\u2019s touch passing and then he launches a shot that would be a modern-day 3-pointer . Kevin Lloyd tells the story of when his father [Earl Lloyd, the first African-American to play in an NBA game] was spit on. I don\u2019t remember my father being spit on, but he was certainly called names and that had to be tough. You think about today\u2019s basketball world and teams hire psychologists and motivational speakers to bring teams together and back then, these people were ostracized from their teams. They couldn\u2019t go eat with the team at the team dinner, couldn\u2019t catch a cab ride to go watch a movie together while they had some off time in many of the cities. So for my father and Earl Lloyd, Sweetwater Clifton, Don Barksdale and all those early African-American pioneers, for them to perform at the level that they did while dealing with all the hatred and the racism, to endure that and still perform at the level they did is pretty incredible. In addition to writing this book, I know you do a lot of work with the Chuck Cooper Foundation to keep your father\u2019s legacy alive. Can you speak about that work and the impact it is having in your community? After his NBA career, my father went to the University of Minnesota and got his Master\u2019s Degree. We wanted to continue to honor his legacy here in Pittsburgh because he was really big on giving back to the community and instilled that in me as well. And we wanted our impact to center around education. Back in the 1990s I started an after-school program, where we used basketball as the hook to get kids to come in and focus on their education. At the time, Pittsburgh was having a pretty serious gang problem. In 2009, Duquesne University came to me and said they wanted to do a Chuck Cooper Classic basketball game. I agreed that we could do a basketball game but anything I do in my father\u2019s name has to have an educational component attached to it. We thought what better way to honor his legacy than to grant graduate level or higher scholarships to African-Americans who have demonstrated financial need, but have also demonstrated the capacity and commitment of giving back to the community and are already high achievers in school. Since 2013 when we started awarding scholarships, we\u2019ve awarded over $250,000 in scholarships. They don\u2019t just get the money, they have to come into the community with me and speak to high school and middle-aged students about the importance of education, not only to them, but also for generational success. Can you speak about the pride you have in preserving your father\u2019s legacy? We\u2019re living in a tough world and I was blessed to have a great father, a great role model, and a great mother. I grew up with a great family. The communities near where I grew up were filled with gang violence and people were underachieving and I always wanted to give what my father gave to me back to other people. Everything I do I try to do it in his name to really just share the lessons that he taught me. I try to pour that into as many young people as I can. I know that we\u2019ve had some success stores. We\u2019ve had our after school program, we lost some people that were very close to me, some of our participants to gang violence, but we also have an orthopedic surgeon, we have a judge, we have school teachers that came out of that program and some of these young people tell me that if it wasn\u2019t for the Chuck Cooper Youth Development Association, I don\u2019t think I would be here now. So to preserve his legacy and be able to provide a teachable moment to young people about the importance of education, the importance of being good citizens, to being supportive to other people is something that is incredibly important to me and something that I\u2019ll always do. Can you take me back to his Hall of Fame induction and the incredible collection of Hall of Famers on stage to welcome your dad into the Hall? The group included Bill Russell, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Ray Allen, Elgin Baylor, Larry Bird, Julius Erving, Tommy Heinsohn, Mannie Jackson, Isiah Thomas and Dominique Wilkins. Those guys were all game changers and I looked and there were multiple Mount Rushmores of NBA greatness on that stage with us. The love and support that they gave us behind the scenes, we were just truly blessed and it just speaks to their appreciation of my father\u2019s legacy and it was representative of their appreciation of what all the early African-American pioneers and trailblazers had to go through. We were incredibly moved, deeply touched by that outpouring of support to welcome our father to the Hall of Fame; it\u2019s something that we\u2019re blessed with at that moment and it will last forever. Everyone [on that stage] was connected to my father in some way. It was either a team that they played for, or people he had an incredible amount of respect for like Bill Russell and Elgin Baylor. Russell and Baylor were the first two African-American pioneers that were good enough that they could start to speak up about the way that black players were being treated. He always told me that he was really proud of those guys. You don\u2019t have to speak up; it takes courage to speak up against any wrongdoing that is going on out here. They were there and then Larry Bird and Tommy Heinsohn, two great Celtics, and I was happy to have a diverse group present my dad into the Hall. We think about this world and diversity and my father brought diversity to the NBA, but there is no Jackie Robinson without [Brooklyn Dodgers General Manager] Branch Rickey, there is no Chuck Cooper without Walter Brown, Red Auerbach and the great Boston Celtics organization. When I speak to my kids and young people I tell them when you do the right thing, good things happen. The Celtics, because of their mindset and the courage they had as an organization that still lives today, they are 17-time world champions, so what a great lesson to learn. The Boston Celtics are tremendous partners with our foundation, they annually contribute $25,000 to the organization and also provide a fellowship opportunity for one of our scholarship recipients. Unfortunately this was going to be their first year, so that is getting delayed [due to the coronavirus pandemic]. But to have partners like the NBA and the Boston Celtics as well as my father\u2019s former employer PNC Bank and Duquesne University \u2014 I call them our legacy partners \u2014 we wouldn\u2019t have been able to climb to the mountaintop without the great support we get from those partnerships. Congratulations on the release of the book. Where can people find it? The book is available now on Amazon . And before we finish I have to give a shout out to my co-author, David Finoli. There\u2019s about 2,000 hours of research that went into the book and he did an incredible job as it walks you through my father\u2019s life and really chronicles his time on the court."},{"id":27833,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/memphis-precious-achiuwa-enter-nba-draft","date":"2020-04-24","title":"Memphis freshman Achiuwa plans to enter NBA Draft","content":" MEMPHIS, Tenn.

Embarking on a season-long farewell tour during the 2015-16 NBA season, Bryant hired a personal camera crew to chronicle the journey, and as the season progressed, he utilized as many as six camera crews, according to the report. Those crews received \u201cunprecedented\u201d access, according to former Lakers vice president of public relations John Black. The camera crews followed Bryant through locker rooms at home and on the road, the training room, the team\u2019s charter plane and its practice facility. \u201cThey had unprecedented and, by far, greater access than anyone else ever,\u201d Black said, per ESPN. \u201cWe certainly allowed them to do everything we could within what the league would allow, and sometimes, with a wink and look-the-other-way, allowed them even more.\u201d The 2015-16 season culminated with Bryant treating fans to a 60-point night in a Lakers victory over the Utah Jazz in his final game. According to the ESPN report, plenty of Bryant footage has already been in editing stages for \u201ca potential documentary to be released years from now.\u201d In fact, Bryant had reportedly seen some of the edited footage, and was providing feedback on some of the material before his tragic death in January. The report said that plans to release the all-access footage have unlikely changed in the wake of his death. Cleveland Cavaliers forward Larry Nance Jr. spent his rookie season with the Lakers playing alongside Bryant and said the various camera crews took some time to become accustomed to. \u201cIt was like, \u2018All right, we got to really watch what we\u2019re saying, watch what we\u2019re talking about, because you have no idea who\u2019s watching or editing this,\u2019\u201d Nance told ESPN. \u201cThat\u2019s something we all kind of talked about as a team is like, \u2018Hey, you never know where this is going. So, let\u2019s just keep it mellow around the cameras.\u2019 But the longer the year went on, you just forget about them and just kind of stopped caring.\u201d That could make for plenty of compelling content for the world to view in the future, when the footage is ultimately released as a documentary. Before his death, Bryant was already delving into multiple projects involving storytelling. In 2018 his production company won an Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film for Dear Basketball, a project based on the letter Bryant wrote to announce his intention to retire after the 2015-16 NBA season.

No, but does it really matter? At this point, I don\u2019t think anybody is going to have a quarrel with what happens, as long as people\u2019s health is first and foremost, which we know it probably won\u2019t be. \u201cIf our league is going to be a leader in terms of public health and public safety and player safety, you\u2019ve got to follow the guidelines of what the virus is speaking to you, so the odds are probably against us in terms of that,\u201d VanVleet added. \u201cBut money, right? So, I think they\u2019ll find a way somehow, some way and try to make it happen. I could definitely see it going either way. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we didn\u2019t come back and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we do come back.\u201d NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has said player safety will be a top priority in whatever decision is made about this season while stressing that everything is on the table. After last week\u2019s Board of Governors meeting, Silver said \u201cwhen you\u2019re dealing with human life, that trumps anything else we could possibly talk about.\u201d Chris Paul, the Oklahoma City guard and president of the National Basketball Players Association, has spoken with Silver often since the shutdown. Paul said Wednesday that the union and the league are seeking answers, but they just don\u2019t exist yet. \u201cThis is a situation where no one knows,\u201d Paul said. \u201cThe virus is actually in complete control.\u201d The coronavirus pandemic also will also have an impact on free agency. VanVleet was set for free agency this summer and acknowledged that he\u2019s thought about it, but said he tries to keep it in perspective during the pandemic. He was averaging career-highs of 17.6 points and 6.6 assists in 48 games before play was suspended in March. \u201cI think the league and the union will try to do a good job to make sure that the free agents this summer get a fair shake and there\u2019s fair negotiating,\u201d said VanVleet, who signed a two-year, $18-million deal to stay with Toronto before the 2018-19 season, when the Raptors won their first NBA title. \u201cObviously, we\u2019ll probably all take a hit at some point, and hopefully the hit is just kind of minimized to this year.\u201d Still, VanVleet was philosophical about the impact of lost wages for star athletes in an environment where millions of people worldwide are suddenly facing far more serious financial hardships. \u201cI think people\u2019s health and well being, and frame of mind, is a lot more important than a couple of million here or there, because we\u2019re filthy rich compared to what we came from in the first place,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s crying over it.\u201d * * * "},{"id":27843,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/marcus-smart-provide-meals-frontline-workers-official-release","date":"2020-04-22","title":"Marcus Smart's foundation to provide meals to frontline workers throughout New England","content":" BOSTON \u2014 Celtics guard Marcus Smart, on behalf of his YounGameChanger Foundation, is collaborating with several local restaurants to provide over 425 meals to frontline workers across various hospitals throughout New England.

Also making an appearance was former NFL player Myron Rolle, who went on to become a doctor and is now treating COVID-19 patients at Massachusetts General Hospital. Celtics President of Basketball Operations Danny Ainge says Rolle has a \u201cfascinating story\u201d that he shared with the team. Wahlberg, a Boston native frequently seen courtside at Celtics games, told stories from his acting and singing career. \u201cHe was a lot of fun. Our players got a kick out of him,\u201d Ainge said in a conference call with reporters on Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019ve had some very inspirational speakers.\u201d Ainge said he is trying to get ready for the NBA draft while still holding out hope that the season will be able to resume. If that has to happen without fans, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s not as much fun. It\u2019s not ideal.\u201d \u201cBut it\u2019s better than not playing,\u201d he said, adding that he\u2019s seen exciting games in college or high school gyms with just a few dozen fans. \u201cI\u2019ve been involved in practices where there are zero fans in the room, and it\u2019s intense. It\u2019s a battle. I think it\u2019s not ideal, but I think it could work.\u201d Ainge also said that he and his family have been watching the ESPN documentary on Michael Jordan\u2019s final season with the Chicago Bulls. Ainge made an appearance in the first episodes because he played golf with Jordan before a playoff game in which the Bulls star scored 63 points. But the former Celtics guard said it was all new to his family. \u201cIt was fun because they didn\u2019t have too much recollection of it. When I tried to chime in and make a comment on what was happening, they gave me the hush,\u201d Ainge said. \u201cThat was fun, to see how excited they were, and how little they knew of the era, and how little they knew about Michael. They were just intrigued by who he was."},{"id":27920,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/milwaukee-bucks-george-hill-marvin-williams","date":"2020-04-22","title":"Bucks' George Hill, Marvin Williams not sweating possible loss of chance at NBA title run","content":" Given the persistent unknowns, the potential cancellation of this NBA season due to the threat of the coronavirus \u2014 including the loss of the 2020 playoffs \u2014 would be a worst-case scenario for the entire league. The Milwaukee Bucks, though, might feel the impact more than most. For a lot of teams, shifting into offseason mode might be somewhat simple. But the Bucks, like a handful of top contenders, could lose a championship without ever stepping on a court. Milwaukee had the league\u2019s best record last season and was in front of the pack again last month when the balls abruptly stopped bouncing. Now the franchise\u2019s best shot at its first NBA title in 49 years could be lost to the pandemic. With stakes as high as the level of prevailing uncertainty, you might expect a veteran such as guard George Hill to be worried about the Bucks\u2019 chances of resuming their drive to The Finals. Hill, in his 12th season, is a veteran of 107 games in 10 postseasons, still in search of a ring. He wants it, the Bucks want it, fans in Milwaukee want it \u2014 and right now, there\u2019s nothing any of them can do about it. So Hill\u2019s frustration must be growing, right? \u201cThe world is bigger than just NBA fans,\u201d Hill said Tuesday afternoon in a media conference call arranged by the Bucks. He was joined on the call by teammate Marvin Williams, a 15-year veteran who has yet to reach a conference finals.  \u201cTo our fans,\u201d Hill said, \u201cit will be exciting to get the season back, to get up and going and get something to watch on TV. But if this is the cost for safety and health, what we have to ask is, \u2018Is it worth it? Is it worth putting yourself on the line, putting your family and kids on the line to make a couple more dollars?\u2019 For me, personally, no.\u201d Some of Hill\u2019s response is about treading lightly at a time when sports has dropped on so many folks\u2019 priority lists. Some of it is expected, too, from his long-established, low-key, calm nature. But some of it is perspective based on the virus crisis hitting awfully close to home. As Hill tells it, his wife Samantha\u2019s 85-year-old grandmother contracted the coronavirus recently. The in-laws live in Brownsville, Texas, four hours away from the Hills\u2019 home in San Antonio. \u201c[She] had the chills, fever of 106 I think, really high, didn\u2019t eat for a while, lost her smell, her taste,\u201d Hill said, \u201cand ended up beating it. Her grandmother is one of those hard-nosed, don\u2019t-want-to-take-medicine, let-God-heal-me [types].\u201d The grace of God, Hill said, did just that, delivering another of those reminders we shouldn\u2019t need about what\u2019s important. \u201cIt just kind of gives you a sense of where life is,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel like sometimes we take things for granted and things can go sideways with the snap of a finger. One day you see someone doing well, and the next day they\u2019re not.\u201d For Hill and Williams, that includes their Milwaukee teammates, scattered across the country while the world waits. Hill and his family booked a private plane down to Texas several weeks ago. Williams, who only joined the Bucks on Feb. 10 after being waived by the Hornets, went from Charlotte to a Milwaukee hotel, to the All-Star break, back to the hotel, then finally to more permanent digs. No sooner had his fianc\u00e9e and their kids joined him than the season was put on hold. They only recently drove right through from Wisconsin back to North Carolina, a 13-hour trek with a pit stop in Lexington, Kentucky.  \u201cThe most interesting couple of months of my NBA career,\u201d Williams called it Tuesday. But now? Not so much. \u201cThis situation is a little different than the lockout,\u201d said Williams, whose seventh NBA season started late and was cut to 66 games due to stalled labor talks in 2011. \u201cWhen the lockout happened, we weren\u2019t allowed to work out at our facilities. But [now], we literally cannot play basketball. You can still go somewhere else and work out, but you\u2019re scrambling to find places even to train.\u201d Both Milwaukee players have cobbled together daily routines that start with their respective kids \u2014 each has two, ages 4 and younger. They play educational games, do a little pre-K schooling and spend the sort of family time NBA players rarely get in March or April. Hill said his children have begun learning some Spanish, a nod to his wife, the former Samantha Garcia. After that, it\u2019s individual workouts. In Hill\u2019s case, he trains in his driveway with a boxing instructor on Tuesdays and Thursdays. On Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, he drives to the ranch he owns outside San Antonio to tend to the animals, the barn and the grounds there. His hobby, he calls it. Both have been active in community efforts at this time of need. For example, Hill has helped first responders and medical personnel by distributing meals from a friend\u2019s outlet, Bush\u2019s Chicken. In addition to taking food to a police station and three hospitals, he opened a $1,000 tab at a local restaurant where virus fighters could \u201cget a meal on me.\u201d This week he\u2019s helping a nearby children\u2019s home score cleaning supplies through another friend\u2019s business. Besides watching the Michael Jordan documentary, \u2018 The Last Dance ,\u201d Hill and Williams have heard the possible scenarios for the NBA\u2019s return. Arenas without people in the stands? One neutral site where all 30 teams might compete? Hard for these players to get their heads around. \u201cIt would be different, it would be awkward,\u201d Williams said. \u201cIf you\u2019re talking about the playoffs, I feel like the crowd is probably the most exciting thing out there. The atmosphere, the environment when you go out there, I think players would really miss that.\u201d Said Hill: \u201cIf there\u2019s a way, it\u2019d be cool. But to say, go to Vegas and stay in a hotel for a month-and-a-half, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible. I think tourists and people are going to be there. It\u2019s hard to sit in your house, let alone to sit in Vegas in the hot weather for a month-and-a-half.\u201d The longer Hill spoke, the more his grounded view of an NBA player\u2019s place in this plight wavered a bit. With all the talk about loved ones, well, to him, his Bucks teammates are loved ones. \u201cI truly love those guys as brothers,\u201d Hill said. \u201cOur team has been very special this year. The camaraderie we have, the relationships we have with each other have been really special.\u201d More than the 53-12 record, more than Giannis Antetokounmpo\u2019s likely repeat Kia MVP performance, more even than the opportunity awaiting them (or not). \u201cWe\u2019re a big family, our team. We all get along, we enjoy being around each other. To not have that, it\u2019s weird. It doesn\u2019t feel right. \u201cBut everyone is separated right now,\u201d Hill said. \u201cNow that I\u2019m back in Texas, it seems like I\u2019m so far away. The bad part is just not knowing. You wake up every morning not knowing if you\u2019re going to play again this year or not.\u201d * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Green, a guard from Napa, California who was considered by some as the No. 1 overall recruit in this year\u2019s high school class, will be eligible for the 2021 NBA draft and seems a strong candidate to be among the top picks. \u201cThe ultimate end goal is to get to the NBA,\u201d Green said on his Instagram Live story. \u201cWith that being said, I have decided to partner with the NBA G League\u2019s new team for elite players. The main reason for this is I want to get better, I want to develop a better game. I want to work on my craft, get stronger and things like that. That way, I can be better for the NBA. This is the best route to prepare myself to get one step closer so I can be ready when that time comes.\u201d As an elite prospect, Green will make $500,000 for one season, according to ESPN . He will play for a still-being-developed program, but not for any G League team or with affiliation with an NBA franchise. He, and any others who follow, will play under the G League umbrella, focusing on draft preparation, basketball readiness and life skills. NBA players across the league reacted to Thursday\u2019s announcement. Green\u2019s deal will also include a college scholarship and living arrangements. Five-star prospect Isaiah Todd, who decommitted from the University of Michigan, reached a deal with the NBA G League as well on Friday. The program the G League announced in 2018 would offer \u201d select contracts \u201d to players who did not want to play college basketball but were not yet eligible for the Draft. But none of those deals were ever executed for a variety of reasons \u2013 feedback the G League got included that players thought the $125,000 salary was too low, did not like not knowing where they would play, and the uncertainty of how they would be allocated to teams. Oklahoma City Thunder forward Darius Bazley announced in 2018 that he would forego college and go straight to the NBA G League, but later opted to participate in a three-month internship with New Balance worth reportedly $1 million. Bazley was selected in the first round of the 2019 draft at 23rd overall.

The second one came as a direct result of Colorado\u2019s Tyler Bey being a good listener. With 6.3 seconds left in a Dec. 21 game in Chicago\u2019s United Center and Dayton ahead, 76-75, Colorado point guard McKinley Wright IV threw a pass to the 6-foot-7 Bey in the paint. He took one dribble but was immediately surrounded, with just 3.1 seconds to play, by two defenders. Somehow Bey saw over them all the way out past the 3-point line, where he zipped a pass to teammate D\u2019Shawn Schwartz, who rose from the right wing and knocked down a shot at the buzzer . The Buffaloes won, 78-76. Dayton didn\u2019t lose again the rest of the season, and at 29-2 would have entered the NCAA tournament, had there been one, as a No. 1 seed. \u201cAnd let\u2019s understand this,\u201d raved CBS color analyst Steve Lappas as he described a replay of those final seconds. \u201cA tremendous pass from Tyler Bey. They got him in the low post, they threw him the ball, and the kid made a great pass. Watch that pass. It\u2019s right on the money.\u201d Bey, who some NBA Draft analysts view as a possible first-round pick, could have used the workout and interview circuit this spring to prove he belongs among the top 30 selections. But like every other Draft prospect, he\u2019s been grounded by the coronavirus pandemic. NBA teams would do well to watch that pass against Dayton, over and over again, because it\u2019s indicative of how Bey plays the game. https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v https:\/\/www.espn.com\/video\/clip\/_\/id\/28348587 https:\/\/www.espn.com\/video\/clip\/_\/id\/28348587 As a teenager on the AAU circuit and again at Colorado, where he was coached by Tad Boyle, Bey received an abundance of good advice, and more important, put it into practice. Bey\u2019s coach with the AAU Las Vegas Knicks was Lamar Bigby, who\u2019s involved the game for the right reasons \u2014 helping players become better by building character and a solid grasp of the fundamentals. Any player who wants to run with the Knicks quickly learns two facets of the game \u2014 defense and rebounding \u2014 are non-negotiable. Those areas were no problem for Bey, but his offense wasn\u2019t nearly as developed. Bigby thought basketball IQ could become Bey\u2019s secret weapon. That pass Bey threw against Dayton didn\u2019t surprise Bigby. \u201cThat\u2019s the IQ part of his game,\u201d Bigby says. \u201cYou pass out of double teams. You make the right play. [In the Dayton game] they threw it to him in the post. He made his move to the basketball and could easily have tried to shoot it. But out of the corner of his eye, Tyler sees D\u2019Shawn Schwartz, who\u2019s wide open. He makes the shot and they win the game.\u201d Thanks in large part to Bigby\u2019s guidance, Bey signed with Colorado, where Boyle knew exactly what the freshman was capable of doing. \u201cHe told me my freshman year I could be one of the best defensive players in the nation,\u201d Bey says. \u201cAnd he taught me how \u2014 staying in your stance, head on a swivel, just talking and doing the little things.\u201d Boyle\u2019s prediction was on the mark. This season, Bey led the Pac-12 in rebounding (9.0 rpg) and was also among the league leaders in steals and blocked shots. He was an easy pick for Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Year, which certainly means he was one of the best defensive players in the nation. https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v \u201cTyler knows who he is,\u201d Boyle says. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t try to do things he can\u2019t do. He knows where his bread\u2019s buttered, and that\u2019s pretty rare today. He\u2019s coachable. He listens.\u201d Boyle cites a good example of that latter point. Between Bey\u2019s freshman and sophomore seasons, he worked tirelessly on improving one of the weaknesses in his game \u2014 the lack of a consistent 3-point shot. As a sophomore, he was determined to show his efforts paid dividends. \u201cThe first seven or eight games, he came out firing,\u201d Boyle says. \u201cBut all that work he put in, it just wasn\u2019t translating into games. After about 10 games, we went to him and said, \u2018look, Tyler, you can\u2019t be hunting your 3s. If they come, they come. Be ready to take them.\u2019 Once again, he listened. He quit shooting 3 balls the last two thirds of his sophomore year.\u201d https:\/\/www.ncaa.com\/video\/basketball-men\/2020-02-06\/di-mbk-highlights-california-colorado But Bey never stopped working on his shot. Last summer, he launched more than 500 3-pointers a day and in his final season at Colorado, he shot 41% on 3-pointers. It was a small sample size (13 of 31), but once again, his basketball IQ was on display. Bey took only shots within the flow of the game. He didn\u2019t force them. Boyle thinks Bey will become ever more confident from behind the arc. \u201cThat\u2019s the one skill guys can continually get better at,\u201d Boyle says. \u201cIn the NBA, he\u2019s not going to have eight hours of study hall, 15 hours of classes. He\u2019s going to be able to work as much as he wants, and you\u2019re going to see his jump shot get better and better.\u201d Boyle thinks Bey, who was asked to guard all five positions at Colorado, will be a multi-position defender in the NBA. And Bigby, the man Bey calls a \u201cfather figure,\u201d thinks his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 has a high ceiling. \u201cI\u2019ve told him he can work on his jump shot and become a guy who can make corner 3-pointers,\u201d Bigby says. \u201cA 3 and D guy. If he can defend and rebound and make a corner 3, he might mess around and become an NBA All-Star. Not a superstar. But he can defend the other team\u2019s best player and get eight or nine rebounds a game. Superstars need a guy like Tyler Bey on their team.\u201d Bey is ready to put in the work. He had a year of eligibility remaining, but he thought now was the time to leave Colorado and make his NBA aspirations a reality. The fact his travel is uncertain because of the pandemic didn\u2019t deter him from making the jump. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s always been about taking advantage of every opportunity I have,\u201d Bey says. \u201cI had a coach in AAU who was there for me every step of the way. Coach Boyle, he\u2019s the biggest reason why my defense is at the level it is. I had nothing else to show in college. It was my time to take the next step.\u201d * * * Chris Dortch is the editor of the Blue Ribbon College Basketball Yearbook .

He scored more points in the restricted area (24) than the Jazz did as a team (16) and the Bucks overcame a 13-point deficit in what was their eighth of 18 straight wins. 10:30 p.m. ET: Lakers at Mavs, Nov. 1, 2019 There have been 30 30-point triple-doubles this season, and two of them happened in the same game. In what was one of the best head-to-head matchups of the season, LeBron James put up 39, 12 and 16, while Luka Doncic almost matched him with 31, 13 and 15.

And what we saw just in the first two chapters was thrilling, one part \u201cHoop Dreams,\u201d another part \u201cHard Day\u2019s Night.\u201d I kept looking for Michael Scott and Dwight Schrute to pop up. But the film and video mined from other, older sources is special, too. If it doesn\u2019t qualify as \u201cnever before seen\u201d like much of the 1997-98 work, it often seems that way. We\u2019re seeing stuff in this doc that definitely feels fresh, whether it\u2019s Jordan biking around campus as a Tar Heel, sitting restlessly on the bench with that broken foot in his second season or getting lauded by Larry Bird in the Celtics\u2019 locker room after dropping 63 points in that 1986 playoff game . The old stuff is a trip down memory lane for those of us who were around in real time \u2013 I was in Milwaukee writing about Don Nelson\u2019s Bucks teams when Jordan arrived as a rookie \u2013 offering glimpses of former players, coaches, announcers, staff and media colleagues. It\u2019s also handy to introduce a couple of generations of younger fans to some of the league\u2019s key characters. Every coach who has ever tried to cultivate an \u201cus against the world\u201d atmosphere as a way of motivating and bonding his team can get graduate credits by watching \u201cLast Dance.\u201d This is a tale of coach Phil Jackson and that elite group of Bulls aligned against a general manager, Jerry Krause, and an owner, Jerry Reinsdorf. Reinsdorf led the group that purchased the franchise after Jordan was drafted and continues to this day as its chairman. Everything he has been in those 36 years, not just with the Bulls but with the Chicago White Sox on the city\u2019s South Side, came through loud and clear in the very first episode Sunday. He is a businessman first, sportsman second, and loyal to the executives who run his clubs. Coaches and players? Somewhat less so. The degree to which he was entertaining the idea of breaking up the Bulls prematurely, as the 1997 Finals ended, was striking. Jordan\u2019s belief that \u201cwe\u2019re entitled to defend what we have until we lose it\u201d definitely was not shared by the top boss. Krause, whose tenure with the Bulls ran from 1985 to 2003, comes across even worse as Jackson\u2019s and the players\u2019 greatest foil. He made a bevy of critical moves to seed the first three-peat and enable the second, but the fact that Jordan already was a Bull when Krause arrived seemed to feed an insecurity about his contribution to the dynasty. Krause was the one who needlessly butted heads with Jackson, decreeing this would be the coach\u2019s final season in Chicago. He was the one who felt Jordan\u2019s and the others\u2019 zingers, the one in a hurry to show he could construct his own contender by \u2026 wooing Tim Floyd from Iowa State to coach and flipping Elton Brand for Tyson Chandler and Eddy Curry? The former baseball scout made it into the basketball Hall of Fame posthumously, but when Jordan is telling the world he\u2019ll only play for Jackson with the Bulls, maybe the smart move is, you blink. \u201cHe deserves a lot of credit,\u201d guard-turned-Golden State coach Steve Kerr said. \u201cBut he couldn\u2019t get out of his own way.\u201d Expect more evidence of that over the next eight episodes. Much was made of Pippen, Jordan\u2019s ultimate sidekick, earning less than he might have in his time with the Bulls. Sixth highest-paid player on the Bulls. Ranked 122nd in the NBA in annual salary. But nobody undervalued Pippen more than Pippen and his representatives. This got touched on some in the doc, but there still was a whiff of victimhood attached to Pippen\u2019s contracts. Fact is, he chose security over flexibility every time he got to the bargaining table. In pro sports, even then, that meant huge downside risk as a great first-year salary looked puny by year six or seven. Even Reinsdorf warned him against long deals, but Pippen locked in while the market moved. So he was making $2.8 million in 1997-98 just months after second-year pro Kevin Garnett shooked the NBA\u2019s underpinnings with a $126 million extension. By the way, the NBA \u2014 then as now \u2014 has rules prohibiting teams from renegotiating, so the Bulls hands largely were tied. As Krause told The New York Times in November 1997 : \u201dWe\u2019d like to pay him more money \u2014 he deserves more money. But all we could do now is extend his contract by a maximum of 20 percent a year. But we know he\u2019s looking for a much larger payday.\u201dPippen\u2019s unhappiness with his pay provides a lot of early-season context for the Bulls \u2014 including his unprofessional decision to delay foot surgery until the brink of training camp \u2014 but that part of the drama is all on him. Kinda quaint, didn\u2019t you think, when we were reminded of how badly Jordan burned to play in his second season in spite of a broken foot? Compare that to the safe vs. sorry approach in 2020 of teams sitting out healthy players. Jordan missed 64 games from Oct. 29 to March 15 that season and, left to the Bulls, it would have been more if the budding superstar had not pressured his way back to work. Management brought him back on a laughable limit of seven minutes per half, but he stretched that almost immediately as the Bulls snagged a playoff spot. In the three first-round games vs. Boston, he logged 43, 53 and 39 minutes, respectively. Here\u2019s a short clip of Jordan and Jerry Reinsdorf discussing the conversations they had. In Jordan\u2019s 11 other seasons with Chicago, he missed a total of seven games, eight times playing all 82. He knew he was the NBA\u2019s No. 1 gate attraction and lived up to it. (Kudos here too to Tim Grover, Jordan\u2019s personal trainer extraordinaire, for making injury avoidance their No. 1 regimen.) SIDENOTE: Bulls teammate John Paxson talked about Jordan\u2019s minutes restriction in the doc. Twenty-four years later, Paxson \u2013 as the team\u2019s VP of basketball \u2013 got into a physical confrontation with coach Vinny Del Negro over a minutes restriction on rehabbing Joakim Noah. As NBA writer Sam Smith noted on SportsCenter after the first two episodes, it was nice to see Jordan involved in telling his own history. That typically had been left to biographers who got precious little help or access to the Bulls star. It indicated, as Smith said, a more open, relaxed MJ. Maybe that made the contrast so stark, then, when Jordan got busy talking about his competitive fire, his unparalleled and even unhealthy drive to win. We got some of the usual stuff about getting cut from his high school team as a sophomore, and the zeal with which he simultaneously learned from and outplayed his teammates at North Carolina. But when he talked about physically fighting his brother Larry after losing a game to him \u201cfor my father\u2019s attention,\u201d it felt a little like breaching a therapy session. When he dissected the foolish group of Bulls players he joined as a rookie in Chicago in 1984 and told how easily he seized control of that team, it was intriguing. But things got downright chilling with a few remarks he made about competition. Like \u201cIt drives me insane when I can\u2019t [win].\u201d And \u201cIf you\u2019re trying to maintain dominance over somebody, you don\u2019t want to do anything to give them confidence.\u201d That\u2019s well beyond Bobby Knight or Vince Lombardi, into the realm of Sun Tzu or George Patton. And I\u2019m betting we get plenty more over the remaining eight hours. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

The new coronavirus and subsequent postponement of the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo isn\u2019t making it any easier. The 35-year-old Bogut, a 2005 No. 1 draft pick by Milwaukee and who won an NBA championship with the Golden State Warriors in 2015, was planning to retire after playing for Australia at the Tokyo Games in three months. Those games have been delayed until July 2021. But Bogut, who has played for Sydney in the National Basketball League the past two seasons, isn\u2019t sure he can take the training and discipline needed to go another year. \u201cI\u2019m not doing much, I can tell you that,\u201d Bogut told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. Offsiders program aired on Sunday. \u201cTo be able to kiss your kids goodnight and put them down every night \u2026 I\u2019ve appreciated doing that.\u201d Bogut has two boys, Luka, 3, and Nikola, 2, with his wife Jessica. \u201cI haven\u2019t done any basketball since the season ended and it feels good waking up, getting out of bed and not feeling like I\u2019m walking on glass,\u201d Bogut said. \u201cIt\u2019s (my career) all been thrown into a washing machine essentially \u2026 but there\u2019s a decision to be made probably by mid-May.\u201d Bogut, who played a key role in Australia\u2019s fourth-place finish at last year\u2019s World Cup in China, has been on the Australian team\u2019s roster since the 2004 Athens Olympics. The Melbourne-born Bogut was named The Associated Press college basketball player of the year in 2005 while playing for Utah, just before being chosen No. 1 in the NBA draft by the Bucks. The World Cup fourth-place finish for Australia came without NBA all-star Ben Simmons, who could play for Australia at Tokyo in 2021. Bogut hopes Simmons is in the squad, but whether Bogut is there to partake in the experience is still up in the air. \u201cWe\u2019ve been tantalizingly close and the squad we\u2019re going to have is arguably going to be the best squad in the history of the Boomers, on paper at least,\u201d Bogut told the ABC program. \u201cTo be part of that, selfishly, is something I really want to do, but the body is what it comes down to. \u201cI can get up for a basketball game any day of the week, but it\u2019s hard to get up for five, six days of training a week and lifting weights.\u201d Bogut has never been one to hold back on his opinions. After his Sydney Kings refused to fly across Australia to play the Perth Wildcats in the fourth game of the five-game NBL finals because of the coronavirus, a series the Kings trailed 2-1, the NBL awarded the title to Perth. Bogut said the players were \u201cused like pawns\u201d in the process. He\u2019s also had some dust-ups with players and officials on Twitter, including fellow Australian and WNBA star Liz Cambage. But this past week in virus-forced isolation, he was more concerned with the location of his television remote. Could he be mellowing close to a potential retirement? \u201cOK, a TV remote has been lost. I have a 2 year old and 3 year old. Turned whole kitchen and lounge room upside down. Any guesses to where else these hoodlums could of \u201cplaced\u201d the remote,\u201d he first tweeted. Later came the good news. \u201cWow. So older brother hid from little brother so he couldn\u2019t change channel,\u201d Bogut tweeted. \u201cBest hiding place: Behind drapes, on window sill in bedroom near lounge room.

Andy Thompson had an idea. Adam Silver liked his plan. Neither had any clue what they concocted. The ESPN and Netflix documentary \u201cThe Last Dance\u201d \u2014 the story based around Michael Jordan and the 1997-98 Chicago Bulls \u2014 premieres Sunday night with the first two episodes of the 10-part series. And the images from that season exist because of the notion that Thompson had and Silver, now the NBA commissioner but then the person in charge of NBA Entertainment, helped arrange. Thompson, who already had been working at NBA Entertainment for about a decade, suggested embedding a crew with the Bulls. Silver made some phone calls. They were off and running. \u201cIt\u2019s almost hard to understate how famous Michael was and how popular this Bulls team was,\u201d Silver told The Associated Press . \u201cAnd so, Andy\u2019s view was, \u2018We need to find a way to capture this team in its glory.\u2019 And there were no such things as multi-part documentaries on sports on television back then.\u201d But there had been some examples of the storytelling that Thompson \u2014 the brother of former NBA player Mychal Thompson, the uncle of Golden State Warriors guard Klay Thompson \u2014 was pitching to Silver. Specifically, Thompson was moved by the tale of the 1986-87 Edmonton Oilers, a video called \u201cThe Boys On The Bus,\u201d which chronicled a season with Wayne Gretzky and the eventual Stanley Cup champions. \u201cNo one in the NBA had ever done this,\u201d Andy Thompson said. \u201cAnd you\u2019re not just doing this with a run of the mill NBA team. You\u2019re doing this with the greatest player in the history of the game in Michael Jordan, who was very protective of his image and his privacy.\u201d He got to know Jordan a bit while working at the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona. He had worked closely with Ahmad Rashad, a Jordan confidant, through \u201cNBA Inside Stuff,\u201d a show Rashad hosted. And Andy Thompson knew Jordan once idolized his brother, so much so that he wore puka shell necklaces and once scribbled his name on a notebook as \u201cMychal Jordan\u201d until his mother saw it and wasn\u2019t pleased. \u201cBecause of his respect and admiration for my brother, obviously, Michael and I connected,\u201d Andy Thompson said. Silver approached Bulls owner Jerry Reinsdorf first, then had to convince then-coach Phil Jackson \u2014 who also agreed, albeit with some conditions that if he didn\u2019t want the crew around at certain times they would give him space. And in the end, Jordan  had to sign off as well. Silver also made the financial aspect work, running that part past then-Commissioner David Stern. The project had plenty of other people involved and was costly; high-definition video used today didn\u2019t exist at that time, but Thompson had already made the decision to chronicle the season on very costly, high-quality film. \u201cI\u2019ll take David\u2019s quote and apply it to Andy,\u201d Silver said. \u201cAndy had an unlimited budget, then he exceeded it.\u201d Thompson\u2019s crew shot hundreds of hours of film. They knew every trick; if cigar smoke was in the air, it meant Jordan was nearby. The crew captured him one day in the locker room, cigar in his mouth, baseball bat in his hand. Another interview that Thompson won\u2019t forget is one with guard Steve Kerr, who escaped to the shower area and was seated alone before what became the final game of the season. Having a brother in the NBA had familiarized Thompson with locker-room culture, when to push, when to back off. \u201cWhen to shut up, when to be a fly on the wall,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cThat gave me a huge advantage in dealing with players. I wasn\u2019t afraid, I wasn\u2019t intimidated. I could speak their language, so I could develop relationships quicker because of that. And that\u2019s what helped me navigate the course of the season because access didn\u2019t just happen overnight. There was a feeling out process for us and the team and the team for us.\u201d The footage, until it was unearthed for this project, had been locked in a vault at NBA Entertainment. Silver said many people \u2014 Spike Lee, Danny DeVito and more \u2014 expressed interest in putting together the documentary over the years and that it became a running joke between him and Jordan if it would ever be seen. Nearly a quarter-century later, the big moment has finally arrived. \u201cWe made it happen, but I would only say in all seriousness, this would not have happened if we had a specific project budget,\u201d Silver said. \u201cWe would have had a zero under revenue and a large number under expense. I think it was more a gut feeling we had that it was our obligation to do this and we would spend what was necessary to capture what we knew was one of the greatest athletes and one of the greatest teams of all time.\u201d"},{"id":27875,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/hang-time-podcast-tommy-sheppard","date":"2020-04-18","title":"Hang Time Podcast: Tommy Sheppard on Wizards","content":"Sekou Smith is joined by Tommy Sheppard, General Manager of the Washington Wizards, on the latest episode of the Hang Time Podcast.

But with these being anything but normal circumstances, due to the COVID-19 pandemic that has shut down sports, the economy and much of society, the prospect of resuming in some form what\u2019s left of the regular season still is among the league\u2019s options. \u201cEverything is on the table,\u201d NBA commissioner Adam Silver said in a conference call with media Friday afternoon, after the annual spring Board of Governors meeting was held via video conference earlier in the day. \u201cThe direction that the league office has received from our teams is that all rules are off at this point,\u201d Silver said. \u201cIf there is an opportunity to resume play, even if it looks different from what we\u2019ve done historically, we should be modeling it.\u201d Any restart will push the completion of this 2019-20 season past the traditional end date in mid-to-late June. It\u2019s even possible the NBA would bump the start of next season deeper into the calendar to accommodate what\u2019s left of this one. One incentive in playing at least some regular-season games is that it would turn the league\u2019s lights back on in all 30 markets, restoring some semblance of normalcy for itself and entertainment for its fans after this harrowing period. The traditional playoff format of 16 teams would leave nearly half the franchises dark until 2020-21. Silver stressed multiple times, however, that none of them \u2014 the teams, the players, NBA headquarters \u2014 can control, for now, whatever comes next. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a good enough understanding of exactly what those standards are that we need to meet in order to move forward,\u201d he said. \u201cThe experts don\u2019t necessarily either.\u201d As models for the coronavirus\u2019 spread and impact change from day to day, as U.S. governors face re-opening decisions based on uncertain (in the absence of widespread testing) infection and recovery rates, Silver said the NBA is left to balance the health of its employees and fans with the economic realities faced by its teams and what he estimated as 55,000 jobs dependent on the league. Last week in a #NBATogether interview with \u201cInside the NBA\u201d host Ernie Johnson streamed on Twitter, Silver said decisions about the business of basketball would be on hold at least through April. Any timeline update Friday? \u201cIt\u2019s about the data and not the date,\u201d the commissioner said, crediting those words to Disney chairman Bob Iger, a guest on Friday\u2019s conference with the owners.  Silver added: \u201cWe are not in a position to make any decisions and it\u2019s unclear when we will be.\u201d Asked to describe the tone of Friday\u2019s tech-style meeting, Silver spoke of the \u201croll-up-your-sleeve, can-do attitude\u201d of the successful businessmen and entrepreneurs who own sports franchise. But he acknowledged \u201ca fair amount of angst\u201d and frustration too, given what anyone actually can do about the virus\u2019 spread and impact. Silver spoke of the symbolism attached to sports, and how the NBA \u2013 which led most sports enterprises and much of the culture in taking the extreme precaution of suspending play on March 11 \u2013 would like to play a lead role in the eventual comeback. Toward the end of the media session, however, some of the harsh realities faced in this country over the past five weeks, into an undetermined future, demanded comment. That included the NBA, a $7 billion industry that ground to a halt. \u201cOur revenue in essence has dropped to zero,\u201d Silver said. \u201cThat\u2019s having a huge financial impact on the team business and the arena business. \u201cWhile this virus is of course a dire public health issue, so of course is shutting down the economy. I think it\u2019s why the league sees it as our obligation, to the extent we can resume play in a safe way, to look at every potential way of doing so. That\u2019s what we\u2019re doing now.\u201d Earlier Friday, the league and the National Basketball Players Association agreed on a plan to withhold 25 percent of each player\u2019s paycheck beginning on May 15. The gradual reduction in player salaries would anticipate or adjust for the cancellation of regular-season or playoff games. Withholding a portion of players\u2019 pay in advance would avoid a situation where players go without paychecks for entire pay periods, for weeks or months to come. Typically, NBA players are paid on the 1st and 15th of each month, with salary payments since the league\u2019s March 11 shutdown through May 1 made in full. Each game, per the collective bargaining agreement, represents about 1.08 percent of a player\u2019s salary. Withholding a portion of pay also would eliminate the need for teams to seek reimbursement from players for salaries paid beyond the number of games already completed this season. If, for example, no more regular-season or playoff games are played, a typical player would lose approximately 22 percent of his salary. The cancellation of games would trigger the \u201c force majeure \u201d clause in the collective bargaining agreement between the owners and the players\u2019 union. This \u201cact of God\u201d provision covers catastrophic circumstances, including a pandemic such as the coronavirus crisis, and stipulates that league can reduce player compensation. (It also allows the NBA to cancel the CBA, though that is not in the plan as of Friday.) The deal ratified by the NBA and the NBPA helped both sides prepare for further delays, even cancellations. It did not help with finding a date or a way back. \u201cIt frustrates me that I\u2019m not able to say, \u2018If we do A, B and C, therefore we can jump the ball,\u2019\u201d Silver said. \u201cAs I\u2019ve said, we don\u2019t have enough information to do that.\u201d Silver said two guests spoke to the Governors on the video conference call. One was Iger, the media executive and longtime partner of the NBA through ABC, ESPN and Disney, who spoke about the many challenges they all face in getting back to business. The other guest was Dr. David Ho, an infectious disease specialist at Columbia University who has worked with the league since Magic Johnson\u2019s HIV diagnosis in 1991 brought that issue into the NBA. Dr. Ho made a presentation on the coronavirus and took questions from the owners. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

The product launch follows the Center for Disease Control\u2019s (CDC) recommendation that cloth face coverings be worn in public settings to help slow the spread of COVID-19. \u201cAs a global community, we can all play a role in reducing the impact of the coronavirus pandemic by following the CDC\u2019s recommendation to cover our nose and mouth while in public,\u201d said Kathy Behrens, NBA President, Social Responsibility and Player Programs. \u201cThrough this new product offering, NBA and WNBA fans can adhere to these guidelines while joining in the league\u2019s efforts to aid those who have been directly affected by COVID-19.\u201d The face coverings, manufactured by FOCO and Industry Rag, will be available on NBAStore.com and WNBAStore.com and feature league logos as well as designs for all 30 NBA and 12 WNBA teams.

As part of a multi-year partnership announced on Thursday, the NBA and Microsoft are teaming up to re-imagine the way that fans experience the NBA and to do so in a much more personalized way. \u201cThis partnership with Microsoft will help us redefine the way our fans experience NBA basketball,\u201d NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement . \u201cOur goal, working with Microsoft, is to create customized content that allows fans \u2014 whether they are in an NBA arena or watching from anywhere around the world \u2014 to immerse themselves in all aspects of the game and engage directly with our teams and players.\u201d At the core of this partnership, Microsoft and NBA Digital \u2014 which is co-managed by the NBA and Turner Sports \u2014 will develop a new direct-to-consumer platform on the Microsoft Azure cloud service that will use machine learning and artificial intelligence to deliver personalized game broadcasts as well as other content offerings that will allow the NBA\u2019s global fanbase to customize and localize their experience. \u201cFirst and foremost, we want to make it easy to be an NBA fan,\u201d said Chris Benyarko, NBA Executive Vice President, Direct to Consumer. \u201cBy creating a new platform that brings together all the things that make up being an NBA fan \u2014 whether that\u2019s watching games, buying a ticket, participating in fantasy or buying merchandise, we can use that platform to re-imagine and diversify what it means to be an NBA fan. One of our key focus areas will be to innovate and rethink how we present NBA games to fans and to really leverage technology to personalize and deepen those experiences and make them more engaging.\u201d Through its current League Pass offering, the NBA has experimented with different camera angles; multiple game audio options, whether that was in the form of an influencer calling the game or listening to the game in a different language; and interactive trivia and questions during game telecasts. \u201cImagine all of those features now being on a platform that\u2019s able to use deep machine learning artificial intelligence capabilities to serve those up to a user; so instead of the fan having to pick and choose and turn them on or off one by one, the platform is now starting to behave like a game producer, automatically selecting and presenting the game in a different way,\u201d Benyarko said. In addition to delivering live and on-demand game broadcasts through the Microsoft Azure platform, the NBA\u2019s vast offering of statistics, data and historical video archive will be curated and presented to fans through state-of-the-art machine learning, cognitive search and advanced data solutions. This will create a more personalized fan experience that tailors the content to the preferences of the fan, rewards participation, and provides more insights and analysis than ever before. Deb Cupp, Corporate Vice President of Enterprise and Commercial Industries at Microsoft, gave an example of a fan frequently searching for statistics while watching games on the platform and how the new platform\u2019s artificial intelligence would use that behavior to enhance the fan experience. \u201cThe AI eventually learns that I like to learn about stats, so it\u2019s going to start presenting me more information about stats as I go into the game,\u201d Cupp said. \u201cIt\u2019s this experience where instead of just watching a game, it actually has the opportunity to interact in a way that matters to me as that fan; it\u2019s enriching the experience and frankly just makes it more valuable to me.\u201d Fans will be able to set up an account and enter their preferences \u2014 whether it is favorite team, favorite players, interest in statistics, history, trivia, gaming and more \u2014 in order to provide some direction to the content the platform provides, while it also learns from your viewing habits. \u201cIt allows you to tell the platform what you like and also the platform will learn what you like by what you do,\u201d Cupp said. If a fan is traveling or unable to follow the games on a particular night in real time, the platform will quickly catch up the fan on games and information that mean the most to that fan, without having to search through all of the scores, headlines and highlights available. \u201cThings like that, to me, is what describes the fan engagement,\u201d Cupp said. \u201cIt allows me to interact the way I want to interact, at the time I want to interact.\u201d This is especially important for the NBA\u2019s global fanbase that consumes the game differently than fans in America due to distance and time zone differences. A fan in London or Australia may have a much different type of fandom than a fan in New York or California. Even fans that live next door to one another could have different interests and thus want a different experience. By personalizing their content, the NBA looks to serve all of its fans equally. \u201cIf we\u2019re able to solve the needs for all different people with varying interests, then we\u2019ve done a great job,\u201d Benyarko said. The visible efforts for the 2020-21 season will be the league\u2019s collaboration with Microsoft around the creation and presentation of NBA stats in the league\u2019s telecasts. Also beginning next season, Microsoft will become the Official Artificial Intelligence Partner and an Official Cloud and Laptop Partner for the NBA, WNBA, NBA G League, and USA Basketball. \u201cWe are thrilled to serve as the official AI partner of the NBA,\u201d Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in a statement. \u201cTogether, we\u2019ll bring fans closer to the game and players they love with new personalized experiences powered by Microsoft Azure.\u201d"},{"id":27937,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nba-microsoft-official-partnership-official-release","date":"2020-04-16","title":"NBA announces new multi-year partnership with Microsoft","content":" NEW YORK \u2014 The National Basketball Association (NBA) and Microsoft Corp. on Thursday announced a new multiyear alliance, which will transform the way fans experience the NBA.

Jordan appeared on the show via video conference from his home in Florida to promote the \u201cThe Last Dance,\u201d a 10-part documentary series focused on the final year of the 90\u2032s Bulls dynasty that won six NBA titles in eight years. \u201cThe beginning of the season, it started when (general manager) Jerry Krause told (coach) Phil Jackson that he could go 82-0 and he would never get a chance to come back,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cKnowing that I had married myself to him, and if he wasn\u2019t going to be the coach, then obviously I wasn\u2019t going to play. So Phil started off the season saying this was the last dance \u2014 and we played it that way.\u201d The series will debut Sunday night on ESPN in the United States and on Netflix internationally over five consecutive Sundays through May 17. There will be two hour-long episodes each of those nights. Jordan said Thursday that after Jackson told the team it was to be the final season together, the Bulls focused on completing the task of a second three-peat. \u201cMentally it tugged at you that this had to come to an end, but it also centered our focus to making sure we ended it right,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cAs sad as it sounded at the beginning of the year, we tried to rejoice and enjoy the year and finish it off the right way.\u201d The documentary was originally scheduled to be released in June during the NBA Finals, but ESPN made the decision to accelerate its release due to the lack of live sports programming because of the coronavirus pandemic. The series has been billed to include never-before-seen footage from that season, during which the team chased its sixth championship. But the documentary covers more than just the final season. The documentary shows Bulls owner Jerry Reinsdorf and Jordan arguing about a foot injury he suffered during his second NBA season. Jordan wanted to play through the injury after doctors told the team there was a 90% chance he would recover. Reinsdorf, however, did not want the star guard to play for fear it might ruin his career. \u201cI said to Michael, you\u2019re not thinking about the risk-reward ratio,\u201d Reinsforf said in the clip aired by GMA. \u201cIf you had a terrible headache and I gave you a bottle of pills and nine of the pills would cure you and one of the pills would kill you, would you take a pill?\u201d Jordan replied that \u201cit depends on how (expletive) bad the headache is.\u201d Reinsdorf ultimately won out; Jordan sat out 64 games that season before returning for the playoffs. Jordan also talks about his time at the University of North Carolina where he would write his mother asking for money for postage stamps so he could send her letters and to pay his phone bill. \u201cIt\u2019s a little different today,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cI had a phone bill in college that was $60 or less, but I only had $20 in my account. The thing that people will learn, and my kids will laugh about when they see it, is we used postage stamps back in those days. Looking at the video you will see things that people have forgot, that life was this way. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have Instagram or Twitter, so you had to live life as it came. \u2026 Spending time with friends and family, it wasn\u2019t the phone. It was in presence \u2014 and you wrote letters.\u201d Jordan discussed his parents during the interview with Good Morning America, saying they were the biggest influence in his life. He said he learned many valuable lessons from them, including the ability to learn from the negatives in life and turn them into positives. He also praised his older brother, Larry. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be here if it wasn\u2019t for my brother Larry,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cLarry pushed me. We used to fight me every day. But through that fight emerged someone like me. He\u2019s right next to me and supports me.\u201d The series will also include extensive profiles of Jackson, and some of Jordan\u2019s key teammates, including Scottie Pippen, Dennis Rodman and Steve Kerr."},{"id":27926,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/hang-time-podcast-andy-thompson","date":"2020-04-16","title":"Hang Time Podcast: Andy Thompson on 'The Last Dance'","content":"Sekou Smith is joined by Andy Thompson, an executive producer of ESPN\u2019s new documentary, \u201cThe Last Dance\u201d, on the latest episode of the Hang Time Podcast.

But LaMarcus Aldridge doesn\u2019t regret shooting off an eyeball emoji in acknowledgement of seeing that Portland Trail Blazers star Damian Lillard at some point would like to rejoin forces.

When you heading over to Portland? (Laughing). You would start it off like that, right away. Low blow, right away. (Laughing). Jokes aside, you had to figure that no matter how you responded to  Damian Lillard\u2019s tweet  off Portland\u2019s official account, people would take that and run with it in any number of ways, right? Yeah, but I actually didn\u2019t mind it. I was bored. I did it. So, I don\u2019t regret it. But was the eye emoji a joke, knowing that people would run with it? Yeah, man. You can\u2019t do anything these days. [The emoji] was like, \u201cOh, I see it.\u201d That was it. You think any of this goes back to when you said something last year about possibly  finishing your career in Portland  ? It is what it is (laughing). So, what have you been doing throughout your time quarantining to keep yourself sharp for a possible return back to the court if the NBA decides to finish the season? Man, it\u2019s tough. I\u2019m trying to work out at the house. I was going to the track. But they closed all the tracks down because people were hanging out there. So they closed down all the tracks. I\u2019m just trying to ride the bike, the treadmill, just working out at the house. What\u2019s the daily routine? Man, it\u2019s boring. I\u2019m just playing. But I wake up, try to get some breakfast in me, workout, try to keep some mobility stuff in my workout, then try to lift some weights at the house. After that, I go to the movie room and watch TV; binge watch something, hopefully I can find something good to watch and make the use of my time with that. You\u2019re a big-time hermit anyway. So, you should be cool with this whole staying at home situation, right? Oh, I am. I\u2019ve got no problem with it, but everyone wants to get out of the house every now and then. I do love being at home. But when it\u2019s forced, it\u2019s a little bit different. But I\u2019ve been fine. It\u2019s just, I want to hoop now. At first, it was like, \u2018cool, I like being at home. So, this is perfect.\u2019 It went from that to like, \u2018OK, now it\u2019s time or I\u2019d like to try to get back to basketball now.\u2019 But I\u2019m trying to stay ready. You talked about hitting up your movie room earlier. Any new music you\u2019re into now, or any shows you\u2019re binge watching? I haven\u2019t been on the music lately. I\u2019m late to the party. But I just started that show \u201cAll American.\u201d I tried to watch it a while back, but I wasn\u2019t really feeling it or whatever. So, I started again, and I\u2019ve been hooked man. I just finished Season 1. I\u2019m on Season 2 now. That\u2019s been my latest show. I watched \u201cOzark\u201d before that. I binge watched that whole season before that, and that was pretty good. Those are the last two shows I\u2019ve been watching. Everybody\u2019s too pretty on \u201cAll American\u201d, right? It\u2019s Beverly Hills, man. That\u2019s why. Let\u2019s get a little heavier here. Does it matter to you ultimately where your NBA career ends? As I think about it, I think I would be cool with it ending in two places, either with San Antonio or in Portland. I think either one would be fine with me. I feel like I\u2019ve made some good memories in San Antonio. I feel like I\u2019m in a really good family in San Antonio. They understand me. I understand them. So, I like that. I feel I have a lot of history in Portland. So, going back there to finish would be fine also. I\u2019m perfectly fine with finishing my career in San Antonio riding it out until my next chapter, or if things have to change there, and if they decide to go young, then I wouldn\u2019t mind going to Portland. It seems like your attitude about Portland has changed quite a bit from when you first left there in 2015 to come to San Antonio. I remember how tough the fans were when you went back to play in Portland for the first time. What\u2019s changed? The fans were rough because they felt like what I did wasn\u2019t right. I left, and I feel like they wanted me to stay and see what could be. But a lot has changed. Like they say, as you grow older hindsight is 20-20. People mature. It\u2019s no secret that Dame and my relationship has gotten a whole lot better. We\u2019ve had some good talks over the years, and we definitely understand each other better. It was well-documented about us just talking and us figuring out that it wasn\u2019t us. It was people around us. So, of course when your relationship gets better with the main guy, then it\u2019s gonna have a different feeling. I feel like I had nothing but good times there. There were ups and downs like there\u2019s going to be anywhere, but I came into the league there, grew into who I am there. So, of course, as you get older, you place value on those things. Obviously, the biggest part of everything is Dame and I fixing what wasn\u2019t really broken by us really just talking it out. Going back to the current situation around the world, have you found different ways now to unwind compared to when you\u2019re grinding in the midst of an NBA season? It\u2019s a little bit difficult really because you\u2019re so limited in things you can do because everything you have to do is basically at home right now. But I\u2019m trying to read when I can, which is what I\u2019ve always tried to do; watching movies, just trying to find ways to help myself grow. Trying to stay sharp is really all I can do right now. I\u2019ve reached out to the NBAPA to try to take a business course while I\u2019m free. Hopefully, I\u2019m not free for too much longer. But I think it\u2019s best to try to maximize this time and work to try to better ourselves. That\u2019s something I would like to do. So, I\u2019m looking into trying to take a business class just to try to come out of this with something more than when all of this started. Because if we just sit at home not doing anything, then I feel like it\u2019s No. 1, I\u2019ll go crazy. Then, for No. 2 it\u2019s like we have to find a way to take advantage of being at home basically. The Spurs sit at 27-36 looking up at a few teams in the Western Conference standings. If the season is resumed, what\u2019s a realistic expectation for how this team will finish the season? That last game (against the Dallas Mavericks), we won. So, you\u2019ve got to go off of that. I feel like we were trying to figure it out. I had been out a few games. I was all of a sudden fresh. We\u2019re all just trying to do what we can to win. I think if it plays out the rest of the way, we have as good of a chance as anyone to be in that eighth spot. That eighth spot doesn\u2019t have to be a crazy record this year. So, I think that makes it even more possible to go on a little run at the end and try to get in there. Any pressure to keep San Antonio\u2019s 22-year playoff streak alive? I\u2019m different. I don\u2019t know how everyone else is. So, I can\u2019t speak for them. But you don\u2019t want to be the team that ended the streak. That\u2019s for sure. I think the pressure should be on ourselves to just make the playoffs, for this team, for this moment, for ourselves and all the work that we put in. That streak is definitely big-time, and you don\u2019t want to be the team that ends it. But you should also want to make it for yourself; just for all the things that we\u2019ve done, we\u2019ve been through, and we\u2019ve battled through. I definitely would love to keep [the streak] going, but I think we have to do it for this team that we have right now more than anything else. When you signed to play in San Antonio in 2015, you were sort of joining the team as Hall of Famer Tim Duncan was on the way out. Was it ever on your mind when you came to San Antonio that you\u2019d have the task of following a legend like Duncan? I think everyone wrote articles differently during that time. I wouldn\u2019t say I followed him there. I feel like I\u2019ve always had an interest. It was more about the organization than just Tim. I came to the Spurs because of the organization, because of my interest since college [at the University of Texas]. We used to go up there and watch games. To play with Tim, and to see what that\u2019s like, to play with Manu [Ginobili], to play with Tony [Parker], it was the whole picture. It was playing for [Spurs coach Gregg Popovich], and seeing how that would be and just being in that organization that I felt like puts its players first. I\u2019m not saying that other teams don\u2019t, but just being a part of that team and that culture was important to me. I think that\u2019s why I felt like they always fit my personality. They\u2019re more about, let\u2019s just do our work and go home, and not do all of that other stuff. It was more of an interest of the whole picture. Of course, playing with Tim was an honor. I had nothing but fun playing with him. But I think I can say it was the whole picture of playing with Tony and Manu and playing for Pop and playing for San Antonio since I grew up in Texas. What\u2019s it like to play for coach Duncan? It\u2019s the same, really, you know? He\u2019s pretty laid back. He coached when he played. He was like a player-coach on the court. So, I feel like it\u2019s the same. He\u2019s still gonna shoot jokes at you. He\u2019s still gonna come in and try to play five-on-five any time he can. He\u2019s still going to point things out if he sees anything. It\u2019s the same for me because we were always talking things over as far as things in the game, how things look, what he sees and vice-versa. So, it\u2019s the same. Even when he was playing, he was trying to help me feel comfortable in the new system, on a new team and things like that. He\u2019s been great at it, and it\u2019s been fun. Can he still cook on the floor? Cook? You mean, can he get some buckets? He can still get some buckets. When you have that IQ, and you have a tiny bit of skill left [you can score]. He can\u2019t move like he used to, but he has skill and he has a tiny bit of mobility left. (Laughing) That\u2019s all I have to say. But when you have that, you can score. He definitely still scores. He\u2019s definitely not moving like he used to, for sure. Speaking of that, what\u2019s it like for you now? What\u2019s the difference when it comes to managing your body at age 24, compared to now at 34? It just takes more of a focus, more of a pregame, pre-practice routine as far as knowing what you have to do to get your body ready, knowing that it takes more time. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a bad thing. I think it actually helps you be more proactive about injuries and things like that. My biggest thing I\u2019ve learned is just putting time into getting ready. When we\u2019re young, you just go on the court and just hoop. But I think as you get older, it\u2019s more about, making sure everything is firing and making sure everything is ready to go and warmed up. For me, I\u2019ve put together a little pre-game routine to get warm, to get my body going. I do that every game. It\u2019s about lifting more. As you know, post-game, I try to always lift so I can keep everything strong and activated. So, it\u2019s more about just putting more time in and learning what your body needs, and just going with it.  Yeah, you take forever to come out to talk to the media postgame. You sure you\u2019re not trying to wait out the media, because as you know, I can wait all night? (Laughing) So, what I do is if I find something I tweaked or something that\u2019s sore, I get treatment, and then I lift. If I\u2019m not tweaked, I lift, do hot tub [treatment], cold tub, back and forth, and then I come out and see y\u2019all. But what I\u2019ve learned and what works for me is getting that lift in after the game just keeps everything strong, keeps everything going, and I don\u2019t have to worry so much about nagging injuries. If I can keep everything firing, then I\u2019ll be good to go. I\u2019m not waiting 30 or 35 minutes behind to [keep from] seeing y\u2019all. It\u2019s me in there lifting weights, trying to make sure I\u2019m getting things back firing and working. I\u2019m not just sitting around. Man, I\u2019m pretty spoiled in San Antonio. I don\u2019t do media every day. So, I don\u2019t really complain about it. It\u2019s just me trying to be more proactive with my body because when you stop and sit down, then it\u2019s hard to just get up and go lift again. So, I just try to do it right after the game so I can just get it done while my body is ready. Ever since you\u2019ve been in San Antonio, your commitment to being in this city has always been in question for whatever reason. Why is that? I don\u2019t know why. I have no clue. I\u2019ve done nothing but try to give what I can and try to do everything I can to help us win, try to do what I can for the team to help the team grow. I\u2019ve tried to change my game to make the team better. I started really shooting 3\u2019s this year to try to make us better and open up the floor for DeMar [DeRozan]. So, it\u2019s like I don\u2019t know why it happens that way. But I\u2019ve been just fully committed. I think it was just that one thing that Pop and I talked about (Aldridge met with Popovich in the summer of 2017 to request a trade ). Ever since, I feel like people just won\u2019t let that go. But we talked that out, and that\u2019s been done, been gone. So, I don\u2019t know why people are still thinking about that. But ever since then, I\u2019ve been locked in. I\u2019ve been all-in. I\u2019m just really looking forward for if we get a chance to try to get back in that eighth spot. If not, then I\u2019m still looking forward to next season and seeing what we can do with the young fellas getting better. Speaking of Pop, you talked to him lately? Yeah, I think last week. He doing OK? He seemed like he was fine. But I can\u2019t speak for him. Man, you know he probably wants to be on the floor as much as the players. Yeah, he\u2019s definitely missing it, I would say. We all want to go back out there for sure. What are your thoughts about some of the things the league has been doing with players such as the NBA 2K20 tournament and the NBA HORSE Challenge? I\u2019ve been watching it. It\u2019s fun. It\u2019s giving guys a way to be competitive, for one. Then two, you\u2019re trying to give the fans something to do as far as watching basketball in whatever capacity they can. I feel like it\u2019s been good for both sides. The fans are stuck at home, so why not watch it? We\u2019re stuck at home, and this gives us something to do, too. So, it\u2019s been good. I can\u2019t do video games because I don\u2019t do them. But the HORSE Challenge, maybe one day I can get into that one. But you can\u2019t do any dunks. That\u2019s fine. I\u2019m a shooter. What you mean? I ain\u2019t gotta dunk. If you\u2019re really practicing social distancing, what does your hairline look like right now? (Laughing) Man, everybody\u2019s hair is torn up right now. You don\u2019t know how to cut your own hair? Man, I wouldn\u2019t even try that. I\u2019d come back from this break looking like I\u2019ve messed myself up. Nah, I\u2019m good. But isn\u2019t this the time to learn? You don\u2019t have to be out in public now with a bad haircut. As soon as I do it, they\u2019d be like, \u2018back to practice tomorrow.\u2019 (Laughing). * * * Michael C. Wright is a senior writer for NBA.com.

The crossroads metaphor is apt, but a little overdue. Consider what it has taken for the franchise, through the eminently forgettable past five seasons and recent history before them, to reach this fork in a horribly pot-holed road: \u2014 A 154-239 record since the organization fired Tom Thibodeau in May 2015. \u2014 One playoff appearance in that time, a first-round dismissal by Boston in 2017. \u2014 Two mixed-message years ushering in a new, alleged \u201cHoiball\u201d era under coach Fred Hoiberg, mashed up with veterans whose games bore little resemblance to a Golden State Lite style. \u2014 Three more seasons of angling for lottery position, then waiting for players (drafted later than hoped) to develop and stay healthy. The core at least of an ensemble cast \u2014 Zach LaVine, Lauri Markkanen, Kris Dunn, Wendell Carter, Coby White \u2014 has sputtered along one or both curves. \u2014 Twenty-two seasons overall since the Bulls\u2019 last championship, and a cumulative 179 games under .500 in that span. There was a giddy stretch in there for a while \u2014 from Derrick Rose\u2019s lottery arrival in 2008 to, well, the young MVP\u2019s blown ACL in April 2012 \u2014 but also a lot of passive-aggressiveness from upstairs before, during and after. \u2014 A 12 percent decline in attendance at United Center, from an average of 21,343 five years ago to 18,804 this season. Going back 10 seasons, the Bulls finished first in NBA attendance the first eight, slipped to second in 2018-19 and fell all the way to 11th this season. \u2014 Oh, and an unprecedented pandemic that has shuttered the NBA, plunging the league into uncertainty as a sport and instability as a business, at least for the short term. Good for the Bulls that only now do they feel they\u2019ve reached a crossroads. Some might have seen a dead end a few years back. There\u2019s no turning around now, though, with Chicago opting to clean house. In the works for weeks, Reinsdorf and his father (and team chairman) Jerry shunted John Paxson into an advisory role, fired general manager Gar Forman and hired Karnisovas for the acumen and promise he\u2019d shown as first lieutenant to the Nuggets\u2019 Tim Connelly. The pair had been in Denver since 2013, steering the Nuggets through a rebuild in the post-Carmelo Anthony era. Finding, adding and gambling on players such as Nikola Jokic, Will Barton, Gary Harris, Jamal Murray and Michael Porter Jr., Connelly, Karnisovas, their staff and coach Michael Malone have driven the Nuggets to steady improvement in each of the past five seasons. They missed the playoffs in Game 82 in 2018, reached the West semifinals in 2019 and, at 43-22 (.662) last month when the Big Pause came, were headed for possibly their best finish yet. It wasn\u2019t all winners for the Denver front office; the Nuggets missed on Emmanuel Mudiay in 2015 and were in position to keep both Rudy Gobert and Donovan Mitchell rather than shipping them to Utah on their respective Draft nights. But Karnisovas, a native of Lithuania, got high marks from those who knew the 48-year-old when Michael Reinsdorf began inquiring, and even higher ones after the two had a series of phone conversations in recent weeks. \u201cIt was so clear Arturas checked every box,\u201d Reinsdorf said. As a player, Karnisovas faced Bulls legend Michael Jordan and the rest of the Dream Team in 1992 (his job: guard Charles Barkley!) while playing in Europe from 1987 to 2002. He hooked up with the NBA in 2003, joining the Rockets as a scout in 2008. Karnisovas offered a lot of expected boilerplate Monday as to the style of play and the structure of the front office he envisions for the Bulls. He isn\u2019t about to give away any trade secrets now with the season in limbo. Besides, that\u2019s what new bosses do, talking in generalities about spacing, defense and rebounding until they can actually roll up their sleeves, flesh out their staffs and nail down their roster\u2019s strengths and deficiencies. Evaluating the new guy similarly will require some time \u2014 and further test the patience of Bulls fans who feel the rebuild they\u2019d been sold has dragged a season or two too long. This organization is at a crossroads. Michael Reinsdorf What was most significant Monday was the sense of relief, even rebirth, in a market somewhat beaten into submission by the elder Reinsdorf\u2019s unwavering loyalty to Paxson and Forman (along with a long-rumored priority on profits over winning). The Chairman has run his MLB team, the White Sox, that way, keeping exec Kenny Williams around beyond his effectiveness \u2014 or so it seemed \u2014 while moving around deck chairs beneath him. Baseball is Reinsdorf\u2019s first sports love, and his management team has produced a 2005 World Series title and, lately, the rumblings of a contender. Letting Karnisovas work freely with minimal oversight from Paxson is considered the key to getting anywhere close to the Sox\u2019s success. Michael Reinsdorf, in relating a conversation he had with Paxson, acknowledged that the Bulls\u2019 front office has been a) small by modern NBA standards and b) too set in its ways. The time when teams could be run like Mom-and-Pop operations should have ended with the last century. Sounds like it\u2019s ending for Chicago with this hire \u2014 with Forman\u2019s departure and Paxson\u2019s slide to the side, too. And at some point, with a decision on coach Jim Boylen\u2019s fate. It\u2019s hard to imagine \u2014 unless Karnisovas just wants to buy time before he can make his first headline move \u2014 that Boylen will last long once the season (or next?) is up and running. So much newness \u2026 and you\u2019re going to roll the new ride off the lot with your trade-in\u2019s old tires? You either press a reset button or you don\u2019t. Karnisovas\u2019 stated goal Monday was to bring a championship to Chicago. He might as well have said \u201canother,\u201d because no one ever forgets the first six in this city. A better measure of success, though, will come from changing leaguewide perceptions about the Bulls. They are viewed by so many as a top-down, suits-friendly operation, a culture that lingers from the Jordan\/Phil Jackson\/Jerry Krause tussles and is blamed for turning off free agents to this day.  That\u2019s the crossroads really facing Chicago now, with the Reinsdorfs at least looking up the right path. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

He watched from afar as Michael Jordan set out on a path that turned Chicago into a championship dynasty and a global brand. Now it\u2019s his job to direct Jordan\u2019s old team back to the top of the NBA. The Bulls fired general manager Gar Forman on Monday, while officially hiring Karnisovas as their executive vice president of basketball operations and moving John Paxson into an advisory role. The struggling Bulls handed the keys to the 48-year-old Karnisovas last week, convincing him to leave his job as GM of the Denver Nuggets. By making the move now rather than waiting until the season resumes or is called off, they believe they are giving him more time to evaluate the organization. \u201cThis is my dream,\u201d Karnisovas said during a conference call. \u201cOur ultimate goal is clearly to bring an NBA championship to the city of Chicago. \u2026 A firm foundation is absolutely vital. I will build that here in Chicago. No skipping steps. There is a systematic approach to success.\u201d Paxson is moving into a background role as senior advisor of basketball operations after nearly two decades running the department. He took over as general manager for Jerry Krause in 2003 and was promoted to vice president of basketball operations in May 2009, with Forman \u2014 who joined the Bulls as a scout in 1998 \u2014 becoming GM. Chief operating officer Michael Reinsdorf said Paxson told him and his father Jerry Reinsdorf, the team\u2019s chairman, in December the front office needed to be restructured and it was time for someone else to lead the operation. Paxson offered to change his role and even step down. \u201cThat\u2019s really the kind of person John is,\u201d Michael Reinsdorf said. \u201cI\u2019ve always said that: When the time came to make a change, John would be the one to let us know. That is indeed what ended up happening.\u201d Jerry Reinsdorf said in a statement that Paxson \u2014 who hit the championship-winning 3-pointer for Chicago against Phoenix in 1993 \u2014 showed why he is \u201cforever a willing teammate on and off of the court\u201d by putting the Bulls\u2019 interests first and deciding to step aside. While Paxson remains with the organization, Forman is out. And coach Jim Boylen\u2019s future remains unclear. Karnisovas said he sees Paxson as \u201can asset\u201d who can be a \u201chuge help\u201d as he adjusts to his new job. As for Forman? \u201cAfter some consideration and conversations, it was apparent we have different philosophies that would prevent us from moving forward,\u201d Karnisovas said. \u201cI\u2019m sure Gar gave his best to the Bulls\u2019 organization. But those decisions are never easy. I was hired to affect change.\u201d Karnisovas prefers a quick pace and players who can handle multiple positions. He offered no timetable for hiring a general manager or deciding the future of Boylen and his staff, saying he will \u201cdo a comprehensive evaluation of every department.\u201d He did confirm he has hired New Orleans salary-cap specialist J.J. Polk and Denver player-personnel director Pat Connelly for front-office positions. The Bulls thought they were ready to contend for a playoff spot after combining for just 49 wins the past two seasons. Instead, they were 11th in the Eastern Conference at 22-43 when the NBA suspended play because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Denver is third in the Western Conference and leading the Northwest division with a 43-22 record. Karnisovas starred at Seton Hall and had a successful international career that included two Olympic bronze medals for Lithuania. He worked in basketball operations for the NBA from 2003 to 2008 and spent five years as an international scout for the Houston Rockets before joining Denver\u2019s front office in 2013. He became the Nuggets\u2019 general manager four years later, with Tim Connelly promoted from GM to president of basketball operations. Michael Reinsdorf said Karnisovas\u2019 name kept coming up in discussions with other owners, current and former general managers, league officials, ex-players, agents and even media members. He said Nuggets president Josh Kroenke told him he would have \u201cabsolutely\u201d put Karnisovas in charge had Connelly not passed on an opportunity last year to run the Washington Wizards. That carried plenty of weight, considering Kroenke\u2019s hires to lead Denver\u2019s front office \u2014 Masai Ujiri and then Tim Connelly. Michael Reinsdorf said he called Karnisovas the night before their interview last week. What he thought would be a quick hello turned into about a 90-minute conversation. Over several more talks the next few days, it became clear to him this was the right person for the job. Michael Reinsdorf just needed his dad\u2019s OK. And after a final interview with Jerry, he got it. \u201cI think what my dad said to me after the meeting when we reconvened was \u2018I never thought you would find anyone as great as Arturas,\u2019\u201d Michael Reinsdorf said. \u201cSo I knew we were done.\u201d"},{"id":27927,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/chicago-bulls-part-ways-gar-forman","date":"2020-04-13","title":"Bulls relieve GM Gar Forman of his duties, give John Paxson new role","content":" After 22 years with the Chicago Bulls, Gar Forman was relieved of his duties as General Manager and will not be involved in the Basketball Operations Department.

Prior to this season\u2019s suspension of the NBA schedule, the Nuggets were on pace to improve their winning percentage for a fifth consecutive season. While with Denver, he was also involved with USA Basketball, serving as an International Personnel Scout for the 2014 FIBA World Cup squad that claimed gold in Spain. He spent five years with the Houston Rockets (2008-13), starting as their Director of Global Scouting before being elevated to Director of Scouting. During his time in Houston, the team drafted Marcus Morris (14th overall, 2011) and Chandler Parsons (38thoverall, 2011).

He played for P.J. Carlesimo at Seton Hall, where he became the first player from the Soviet Union to play college basketball in the United States. He went on to enjoy a decorated career for the Pirates, where he was a four-year starter and helped the Hall claim two Big East Tournament titles and make four trips to the NCAA Tournament. He finished his collegiate career with 1,509 points and was a two-time Big East Basketball Scholar-Athlete of the Year. In 2016, he received Seton Hall\u2019s Most Distinguished Alumnus Award, the university\u2019s most prestigious alumni award which is presented to an individual who has been recognized as an outstanding leader in his or her professional field.

Here\u2019s a quick rundown of some of the content generated by players around the NBA as they await the all-clear to resume the season: Touching tales starring Kobe Bryant continue to circulate through social media long after the star\u2019s tragic death, with Adam Morrison sharing the latest Thursday on the Rejecting the Screen podcast. The No. 3 overall pick of the 2006 NBA Draft, Morrison played four seasons in the NBA and was released by the Los Angeles Lakers in 2010. That represented a low point in his career, but Morrison \u2014 a fan of Premier League club Chelsea \u2014 explained how Bryant lifted his spirits by gifting him a game-worn, signed Didier Drogba jersey. \u201cI wasn\u2019t playing obviously, career was in the [expletive],\u201d Morrison said. \u201cMy personal life wasn\u2019t great. I was really depressed. I was basically a hermit in my own house. I didn\u2019t go out in the community at all, and if you did it was people asking you, \u2018Why aren\u2019t you playing?\u2019 I was 26 at the time or whatever I was, No. 3 pick, just a really low point in my life, and I got a text from Robert Lara, the Lakers security and one of Kobe\u2019s best friends. He said \u2018Hey, what\u2019s your address, I\u2019ve got something in the mail for you.\u2019\u201d To Morrison\u2019s surprise, Bryant seemed to know exactly what would lift his former teammate\u2019s spirits. \u201cI get the package, and it\u2019s an autographed jersey from Didier Drogba, who is my favorite player,\u201d Morrison explained in a story that has since been shared by Chelsea\u2019s official website . \u201cI\u2019m a Chelsea fan. It was from Kobe. A game-worn jersey, signed, \u2018Didier Drogba, To Adam, Best Wishes.\u2019 I always thought Kobe made a phone call, which would be fine, still cool as [expletive], unbelievable.\u201d On the night of Bryant\u2019s death in a helicopter crash, which also included the star\u2019s daughter, Gianna, and seven other passengers, Morrison would find yet another surprise while perusing Chelsea\u2019s page on Instagram. \u201cThe night he passed, I\u2019m scrolling through, reading everything, and I\u2019m emotional, and on Chelsea\u2019s Instagram page,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cIt\u2019s him with Didier Drogba holding up a jersey, and it says, \u2018To Adam, Best Wishes.\u2019 So, he went up to my favorite player, got it signed for me without even asking, and sent it to me when he knew I was low. It\u2019s unbelievable. I still have the jersey. That\u2019s what Kobe Bryant was. He\u2019s just one of those dudes who understood his own aura and could sense when people were down.\u201d * * * Boston Celtics forward Jayson Tatum revealed his top three players during a chat on Instagram Live, in addition to pointing out that he believes Houston Rockets guard James Harden is deserving of more than just one Kia NBA Most Valuable Player Award. Tatum called LeBron James \u201cthe best player,\u201d and ranked Kevin Durant at No. 2, followed by Kawhi Leonard at No. 3. \u201cThis is LeBron\u2019s 28th year in the league, and he was probably gonna win the MVP [if the season hadn\u2019t been put on hiatus],\u201d Tatum joked. When it was mentioned that Giannis Antetokounmpo captured last season\u2019s MVP award, Tatum immediately stepped up in support of Harden. \u201cJames Harden should\u2019ve won MVP last year,\u201d Tatum said. \u201cHe definitely should\u2019ve won back-to-back MVPs.\u201d Tatum also revealed who he considers to be the top players at each position. At center, Joel Embiid receives Tatum\u2019s nod. Anthony Davis is Tatum\u2019s top power forward, and James is the best small forward. Tatum\u2019s starting guards would be Harden and Stephen Curry. http:\/\/twitter.com\/Rockets_Insider\/status\/1247909198421282817 * * * Here\u2019s a lighthearted conversation between former teammates Stephen Curry and JaVale McGee. What can\u2019t be denied here is Curry\u2019s supreme confidence. But was he joking or serious? Seems like a little of both from this vantage point. Anyway, McGee played the role of interviewer here, and asks Curry, \u201cWhat team or player on that team that you know is guarding you do you look at it and be like, \u2018Oh yeah, I\u2019m getting 60 tonight?\u2019\u201d \u201cOoooh,\u201d Curry responded. \u201cEverybody.\u201d Curry\u2019s answer sent McGee running around the room yelling while the Warriors guard cracked up laughing. \u201cWhat is going on?\u201d McGee asked. \u201cSteph Curry just sent shots at every player.\u201d Curry\u2019s response: \u201cQuarantine done changed me, huh? * * * For the record, Sexton hasn\u2019t all of a sudden become quarantine cocky. This interview with Sexton was conducted before the NBA season was put on hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Sexton covers a variety of subjects in this wide-ranging interview from learning to playing off-ball to changing the culture in Cleveland with new coach J.B. Bickerstaff. But what stuck out the most about this interview was Sexton\u2019s response to when the Cavaliers would make it back to the postseason. Cleveland hasn\u2019t advanced to the playoffs since 2018, but Sexton expects the Cavs to be back in it soon. \u201cNext season,\u201d Sexton said when asked when the Cavs would make it back to the playoffs. The interviewer then asks whether Sexton is serious. His response: \u201cYes. Next season.\u201d In his second season, Sexton, 21, was averaging 20.8 points, 3.1 rebounds and 3.0 assists per game in 2019-20. He also averaged 30 ppg in the five games before the season went on hiatus. At 19-46, the Cavaliers currently rank last in the Eastern Conference. * * * Michael C.

It\u2019s the Wildcats\u2019 annual Red-Blue scrimmage, but instead of joining his teammates as they gather for the playing of the national anthem, Nnaji is at midcourt, squeezing his 6-foot-10, 240-pound frame onto a chair in front of an electric piano. He\u2019s not there to observe the anthem; he\u2019s getting ready to perform it. Much like he does everything else in life, Nnaji has prepared for this moment. He\u2019s a perfectionist by nature and has worked on his unique arrangement of the song for more than a month. Now, as he\u2019s getting ready to play, Nnaji is trying to chase away any self doubt flickering through his brain. Little wonder he had a few jitters. \u201cThat was the biggest crowd I had ever played in front of,\u201d Nnaji says. Once Nnaji\u2019s fingers began flying over the keyboard, the nearly 15,000 spectators inside Arizona\u2019s McKale Center were no longer in his focus. He was locked in on the song, and it was incredible. Somehow, Nnaji had taken the national anthem from Baltimore, where Francis Scott Key wrote it in 1814, down to New Orleans, where pianist Ferdinand Joseph LaMothe, better known as Jelly Roll Morton, became a legend playing his rousing brand of jazz and ragtime. That Nnaji\u2019s musical hero and primary influence began performing in 1900 and died in 1941 is significant and bears further examination, because it reveals much about the young man\u2019s intelligence, character, work ethic and, well, good taste. But for now, let\u2019s stay focused on the national anthem, just as Nnaji was that late September evening. \u201cYou sit down and you\u2019re thinking about everything,\u201d says Nnaji, a certain first-round pick in the NBA Draft, whenever it will be conducted. \u201cBut then you start playing and you get into a zone and this rhythm. You\u2019re not really not thinking about anything; you\u2019re just watching yourself play. Toward the end, you start to come back, and once you\u2019ve finished, you see the crowd cheering. I had practiced a lot; worked my butt every day. I was confident in my preparation. I just took a deep breath, calmed myself, and started playing.\u201d When Nnjai finished, a huge smile flashed across his face as the McKale Center crowd roared its approval. Nnaji, who has played the piano since he was four and began taking formal lessons when he was eight, brings the same level of dedication and preparation to basketball. The piano is a difficult instrument to master. Developing the skillset needed to play in the NBA is even harder. Learning to play the piano helped Nnaji learn to play basketball. \u201cIt\u2019s all about preparation,\u201d Nnaji says. \u201cThe same kind of preparation and time I spent for the national anthem, I bring that dedication and focus every day to basketball. Whether it\u2019s ball handling, shooting, lifting or cardio, it all boils down to how focused you are and determined you are to prepare yourself to become better.\u201d Those who know Nnaji best have no doubt there\u2019s a direct correlation from the piano to the court. \u201cHow Zeke approaches the piano and his practice is very similar to basketball,\u201d says Arizona assistant coach Danny Peters, who recruited Nnaji from his native Minnesota, where despite playing for famed Hopkins High School and a strong AAU program, he was overshadowed and underrated. \u201cZeke\u2019s personality is very much a perfectionist, which comes from his playing the piano. His dad told me that before he ever got here. \u201cBut ultimately, there\u2019s a big difference between playing an instrument and playing basketball. The piano doesn\u2019t fight you back. So when Zeke first got here, we talked a lot about playing through mistakes, and assuring him he wasn\u2019t always going to be perfect, and that that was OK.\u201d Jay Fuhrmann, coach of Nnaji\u2019s AAU team Division 1 Minnesota, is once again tutoring Nnjai as he prepares for the Draft. He has a theory that music and basketball go together like French fries and ketchup. \u201cThere\u2019s a complete correlation,\u201d Furhmann says. \u201cEven when I\u2019m training kids. I\u2019ll tell them, pretend you\u2019re dancing right now. You want to have flow and move your hips. All the really good athletes have that. Flow. Zeke has it. And on top of that, he\u2019s got discipline. You just don\u2019t become a great piano player overnight. You\u2019re got to work at it. You\u2019ve got to fail. He plays so effortlessly. Just like he plays basketball.\u201d Nnaji, who wound up leading Arizona in scoring (16.1 ppg), rebounding (8.6 rpg) and field-goal percentage (.570), has another advantage when it comes to basketball. He plays with a chip on his shoulder the size of a baby grand piano. Five freshman who made the McDonald\u2019s All-American team, including Arizona teammates Josh Green and Nico Mannion, played in the Pac-12 this season. Nnaji thought he deserved McDonald\u2019s accolades, too, but most of the recruiting analysts didn\u2019t see it that way. Nnaji is proof that star ratings aren\u2019t a reliable measure of future success. Only one recruiting analyst rated him a five-star prospect. Others considered worthy of four stars, certainly nothing to be ashamed of. But Nnaji thought he deserved better. He was eager to prove that in what turned out to be his only season at Arizona. And when the regular season ended, it was Nnaji, not any of those five McDonald\u2019s All-Americans, who earned Pac-12 Freshman of the Year honors. He was also voted first-team All-Pac-12. Making Nnaji\u2019s accomplishments all the more impressive was the fact he was a focal point. \u201cHe was the biggest target to take away,\u201d Peters says. \u201cAs the season went along, the double teams came. He got better and better at handling them. It wasn\u2019t the easiest thing to do.\u201d Though Nnaji was disappointed he didn\u2019t play in the McDonald\u2019s All-Star game and was cut last summer from the USA Basketball U19 team tryouts, in retrospect he views both snubs as a blessing. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t been overlooked,\u201d Nnaji says, \u201cI might not have had the kind of motivation I did to show what I could do.\u201d Now the evaluation process begins all over again. Holed up in Minnesota, where, Nnaji is quick to point out, he and Fuhrmann are practicing safe social distancing, he\u2019s preparing for the draft. One skill he\u2019s working on, because some scouts view him as a tweener\u2014neither a legitimate stretch four nor five man\u2014is shooting. \u201cWhere he\u2019s going to wow the scouts is his shooting ability,\u201d Fuhrmann says. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t asked to do that at Arizona. He\u2019s got the ability to shoot the 3. We\u2019re really working on him getting comfortable from that NBA 3-point line, and it\u2019s been fun to watch. If you\u2019ve never stood at the NBA 3-point line and shot two or three hundred in a row, you don\u2019t realize how far away it is and the leg strength it takes. \u201cThe first day we started, Zeke was OK at it, and the second day, he was even better. By the third day, I was looking over at his dad and I got big eyes. He\u2019s going to be an exceptional shooter in the NBA. It\u2019s hard to develop the touch. Zeke has it. And he\u2019s got the footwork down where his foundation is solid. Now it\u2019s just about repetition.\u201d When he\u2019s not practicing, Nnaji passes away social isolation time by listening to and playing music. He\u2019s in a serious Stevie Wonder phase, and he\u2019s never too far away from his idol, Jelly Roll Morton. How could a 19-year-old have such an appreciation for an artist who died years before even his parents were born? \u201cGrowing up my parents exposed me to different genres of music,\u201d Nnaji says. \u201cI have an appreciation for all kinds. Even playing the piano. I play jazz, ragtime. My favorite genre is ragtime. It\u2019s got that New Orleans feel. That\u2019s why I wanted to incorporate that into the national anthem.\u201d Nnaji has no plans to follow in the footsteps of the late Wayman Tisdale, the former University of Oklahoma and NBA star who, after his playing days were finished, became a smooth jazz bass player of considerable skill and renown. \u201cI see it as more of a hobby,\u201d Nnaji says. \u201cNothing I\u2019d like to try professionally. It\u2019s an escape for me, a way to relax.\u201d * * * Chris Dortch is the editor of the Blue Ribbon College Basketball Yearbook .

The league gave teams the directive on Thursday in a memo that was obtained by The Associated Press . The league and the National Basketball Players Association has been in talks for weeks about the status of salaries during the game\u2019s shutdown. The last NBA games were played March 11, the day that Utah center Rudy Gobert became the first player in the league to test positive for the coronavirus. The pandemic will lead to the delay of at least 259 regular-season games through April 15, what would have been the end of the regular season. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said earlier this week that no decisions about the rest of the season, including whether play can resume, would occur before May. None of the games have been canceled yet. The playoffs were to begin on April 18, and the losses in revenue should the season either be shortened or not finished could easily reach hundreds of millions of dollars. Being paid in full now also doesn\u2019t mean that things will stay that way for players. What the collective bargaining agreement between the league and its players describes as a \u201cForce Majeure Event\u201d \u2014 the legal term for unforeseeable circumstances, such as an epidemic or pandemic \u2014 could still come into play. Per the Collective Bargaining Agreement, players could lose 1.08% of their annual salary for each game that is canceled. Most NBA players are paid on the 1st and 15th of each month. The next scheduled payment comes on May 1, and it remains unclear if those checks will be affected by the possibility of either shortening the season or have it not resume at all."},{"id":27988,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/clippers-working-out-together-virtually-during-shutdown","date":"2020-04-09","title":"Clippers working out together -- via video -- during shutdown","content":" LOS ANGELES ( AP ) \u2014 The LA Clippers are getting together for workouts while the NBA season is suspended \u2013 via video conference calls.

The plan did not unfold the way they envisioned, and now, they have a new leader in the front office. The Bulls hired Denver Nuggets general manager Arturas Karnisovas to run their basketball operation, a person familiar with the situation said Thursday night. The person, who confirmed reports by several outlets, spoke on the condition of anonymity because the move has not been announced. Longtime executive John Paxson was expected to move into an advisory role. The futures of general manager Gar Forman and coach Jim Boylen were unclear. The move allows the Bulls to have their new top executive in place if the season resumes from the COVID-19 pandemic suspension. The 48-year-old Karnisovas starred at Seton Hall and had a successful international career that included two Olympic bronze medals playing for Lithuania. He worked in basketball operations for the NBA from 2003 to 2008 and spent five years as an international scout for the Houston Rockets before joining Denver\u2019s front office in 2013. He became the Nuggets\u2019 general manager four years later, with Tim Connelly promoted from GM to president of basketball operations. Karnisovas had big roles in Denver taking two-time All-Star center Nikola Jokic in the second round of the 2014 draft with the 41st overall pick, as well as recent lottery selections Jamal Murray and Michael Porter Jr. Karnisovas and Connelly also have constructed a highly respected international scouting operations. Denver is third in the Western Conference and leading the Northwest division with a 43-22 record. Reports that the Bulls would shake up their front office surfaced during the All-Star break in Chicago. They thought they were ready to contend for a playoff spot with a young nucleus but were 11th in the Eastern Conference at 22-43 when the season was suspended. Paxson, who hit the championship-winning 3-pointer for Chicago against Phoenix in 1993, is stepping aside after 17 years running the front office. He took over as general manager in 2003 after Jerry Krause resigned following a failed rebuild in the wake of the Michael Jordan-Scottie Pippen era. Paxson was promoted to vice president of basketball operations in May 2009 with Forman \u2013 who joined the Bulls as a scout in 1998 \u2013 taking over as GM."},{"id":28009,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/lebron-james-closure-not-likely-unless-lakers-finish-season","date":"2020-04-09","title":"LeBron: No closure if we can't finish this season","content":" LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Instead of preparing for a playoff run, LeBron James is mostly spending the spring playing hoops with his teenage sons and enjoying tea time with his young daughter. And when he isn\u2019t binge-watching \u201cTiger King\u201d with his wife, he is scanning the news for information on whether the coronavirus pandemic will allow the Los Angeles Lakers to finish their impressive season chasing an NBA championship. James is still optimistic about the Lakers\u2019 future, but he also knows safety comes first. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to have any closure if we do not have an opportunity to finish this season,\u201d James said from his home Wednesday on a conference call with Lakers beat reporters. The Lakers were cruising toward their first playoff berth since 2013 when the NBA season was suspended March 11. They have the Western Conference\u2019s best record at 49-14, leading the second-place Clippers (44-20) by 5 1\/2 games and trailing only Milwaukee (53-12) in the overall league standings. The Lakers did it despite a thorough roster turnover last summer headlined by the arrival of Anthony Davis. They also persevered through a stressful preseason trip to China, followed by the death of franchise icon Kobe Bryant in a helicopter crash in January. James\u2019 17th NBA season is obviously unique for many reasons, but he is uncommonly proud of what the Lakers have accomplished so far. \u201cI can have some satisfaction on what our team has been able to do this year (with) a first-year coach, first-year system, a whole new coaching staff, bringing on so many new pieces to our team this year,\u201d James said. \u201cI honestly didn\u2019t think that we would be able to come together as fast as we did, just having so many new pieces (and) bringing in Anthony. He spent seven years in New Orleans, so he was coming into a new system, playing along with myself, and how we would be able to come together? I thought it would take us a lot longer than it did, but I was wrong. I was very wrong about that.\u201d And then all that good work abruptly stopped four weeks ago. Two unidentified Lakers players subsequently tested positive for coronavirus , but the Lakers say James and his teammates are all healthy after they completed their 14-day isolation. James will be deeply disappointed if the Lakers don\u2019t get a chance to test themselves during a playoff run, yet he realizes what\u2019s most important in the upcoming weeks and months. James initially expressed reluctance about playing games in empty arenas, or the possibility of NBA teams gathering in the same city to complete the season in a form of sports quarantine. The 16-time All-Star selection now says he is up for anything that\u2019s safe and smart. \u201cIf it\u2019s in one single, isolated destination, if it\u2019s Las Vegas or somewhere else that can hold us and keep us in the best possible chance to be safe, not only on the floor but also off the floor as well, then those conversations will be had,\u201d James said. \u201cOnce this thing gets a good handle on it and the people in the higher ranks understand it, if they know we are safe, then we can make the next step. But the safety is always the most important, and then we go from there.\u201d James isn\u2019t yet back at work with Mike Mancias, his personal trainer. Instead, he says he is training with his wife, Savannah, and playing plenty of hoops with Bronny James, their 15-year-old son, at a thoroughly sterilized court owned by a friend. He also shoots hoops outside at his own home with the whole family. James is doing weekly meditation, but says his mental state is outstanding thanks to his family. He has frequently spoken about missing time with loved ones during the grind of the NBA season, so he is enjoying this intensive togetherness with his kids. \u201cThey wake up every day in a positive mind frame,\u201d James said with a laugh. \u201cMaybe one reason is they\u2019re not actually in school, so I know they get to sleep in a lot more now. But also they\u2019re just so appreciative of life. \u2026 Just being able to see my kids wake up with that positive attitude helps. For me, I wake up, I\u2019m able to get a nice breakfast, and then I train. And when I\u2019m training, I\u2019m always in a very positive state of mind.\u201d"},{"id":27975,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/kobe-bryant-latest-book-debut-atop-best-seller-list","date":"2020-04-08","title":"Kobe's latest book to debut atop best-seller list","content":" Kobe Bryant is back atop the best-seller lists, days after the late Los Angeles Lakers superstar was selected to the Hall of Fame .

He played in 27 games there during his NBA career, leaving the court as a winner only eight times. He remembers those days. And respects them, too. In a wide-ranging interview this week with The Associated Press, Garnett covered plenty of topics, including the announcement over the weekend that he officially is a member of the Class of 2020 for the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, his relationship with fellow inductee Kobe Bryant, the coronavirus pandemic, and his plans for the next five and 10 years. But there was also a surprise: Garnett revealed a deep affinity for Seattle, to the point where he said he\u2019d like to see the NBA return to that city \u2014 and said he would bring a team there if he could. \u201cIf I have a dream, I would say that I would love to give be able to go and buy the Seattle SuperSonics and reactivate the Pacific Northwest,\u201d Garnett said. \u201cSeattle was huge to our league. I would love to be able to do that. That\u2019s what\u2019s up. If there\u2019s one thing I could do tomorrow, it would be that.\u201d These days, it\u2019s not that uncommon for Garnett to be thinking big. He found out late last week that he had been officially selected to the Hall of Fame, part of a nine-person group that will include four going in as players \u2014 himself, Bryant, Tim Duncan and Tamika Catchings. He raved about each for various reasons; Bryant for his competitive fire, Duncan because they were elite at the same position, Catchings for her body of work. He said he still savors his battles with Bryant and Duncan. \u201cI like to think that steel sharpens steel, and I like to think that all three of us pushed each other to be the best that we could be,\u201d Garnett said. \u201cTo be going in such a class like this, I\u2019m more than honored.\u201d And the news came at a time where the coronavirus pandemic overshadows everything. Garnett has even limited how much news he can absorb, saying too much of what he sees is \u201cscary.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll be honest, I\u2019ve just been feeding myself things to stay stimulated and I exercise a lot,\u201d Garnett said. \u201cI should be able to run a marathon when this (is) over with. \u2026 I\u2019ve unplugged from the overall beast of it. I\u2019m feeding myself with books, feeding myself with documentaries.\u201d They are a necessary distraction, in what has been a trying year. Garnett does not have great things to say about 2020, with the pandemic coming when he is still personally reeling from Bryant\u2019s Jan. 26 death in a helicopter crash. \u201cI ain\u2019t going to front, man, since Kobe died, it\u2019s been like upside down. 2020 has been (awful),\u201d Garnett said. \u201cSo, I\u2019ve just been trying to maintain and \u2026 appreciating some of the small intangible things and actually enjoying life a little bit or trying to and be productive.\u201d For Garnett, that passion intersects with one of the passions Bryant had: Creating content. Bryant was connecting with people through children\u2019s books, documentaries and other projects, and Garnett has a similar diversity in his content plans these days. Garnett has a company called Content Cartel that he\u2019s working hard to continue building now, even when basketball is in its hiatus for at least another several weeks. \u201cI got stories for every event it feels like,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to share that. They\u2019re fun stories, they\u2019re stuff that I\u2019ve survived, they\u2019re stuff that I think is compelling, I think it\u2019s stuff that younger generation or younger people, or even people period can take from and use as a solution or as influence.\u201d And if he had one piece of advice for players today, as they deal with these uncertain times, it was this: Stay ready. \u201cTomorrow is everything,\u201d Garnett said. \u201cSo I think players obviously need to be locked into tomorrow and trying to create a tomorrow for not just them, but for their families. You\u2019ve got to stay ready. I would stay as sharp as I could. It\u2019s always something that you can do. We\u2019re in this all together, man. This ain\u2019t someone or one single individual going through it. We, everyone around the globe, are going through this.\u201d"},{"id":28004,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/coping-uncertainty-coronavirus-pandemic","date":"2020-04-08","title":"The Q&A: Bob Delaney and Dr. Joel Fish on coping with uncertainty of coronavirus pandemic","content":" Imagine you\u2019re about to ride on the world\u2019s most amazing roller coaster, and savoring every moment. From the long line that lets you watch as your excitement grows, to getting buckled in, to the slow crawl to the top, finally to the incredible plummet and manic twists and turns. Now imagine someone jamming an iron bar in the gears. That\u2019s the metaphor Bob Delaney and Dr. Joel Fish use in a new article that looks at the abrupt halt in our lives due to the coronavirus pandemic. And offers a game plan for getting through it. Life has its ups and downs but there typically is a rhythm to it, something that can be anticipated and dealt with. But this? All new with little to prepare us, throwing up challenges that don\u2019t play favorites in terms of NBA players, coaches, staff or fans. If the virus represents a threat to our health and the shuttering of businesses and widespread unemployed represent threats to our wallets and futures, this particular strategy of sheltering-in-place poses some emotional and psychological threats of its own. Delaney is a former NBA referee of 25 seasons and an officiating supervisor for four more. He bookended his hoops career at the front by working as an undercover New Jersey state trooper and at the back as an expert and consultant in post-traumatic stress disorder. He was the 2020 winner of the NCAA\u2019s President Teddy Roosevelt Award . Dr. Fish is a psychologist specializing in sports for the past 25 years, working with athletes of all ages and levels of play. Based in Philadelphia, he has consulted with the 76ers, the NHL Flyers, baseball\u2019s Phillies, the U.S. Women\u2019s National Soccer Team and many others. He has consulted with college and university sports programs, and speaks nationally on the topic. Their piece has appeared in the past two weeks on the TAPS web site (Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors) focusing on Armed Forces families and on Referee.com . It sprang from a chance meeting early last month in Nashville \u2013 both were there for the SEC basketball tournament, until it got cancelled along with the NCAA\u2019s \u201cMarch Madness.\u201d As they talked, they came up with the rough outline for the article, \u201cThe Game of Life,\u201d designed to help people cope with some sudden and relentless issues stemming from COVID-19 concerns. It delves into the trauma and stresses of this particular crisis, identifying the cumulative effects as the lockdown of commerce and normal daily life heads toward a second month. And it offers a series of steps \u2013 A Game Plan \u2013 that might help individuals deal with so much upheaval and separation. Delaney and Fish spoke this week in a three-way call with NBA.com\u2019s Steve Aschburner to discuss elements in their analysis and game plan. As NBA stars slip out of shape and fans ache for live sports and a return to normalcy, Delaney and Fish\u2019s article offers some ways to cope, maybe even thrive. (Editor\u2019s Note: The following 1-on-1 conversation has been condensed and edited). * * * NBA.com : Before you lay out your actual game plan for navigating this crisis, you talk about the idea that for many, \u201cwe are what we do.\u201d Considering how many people were suddenly sidelined from jobs and roles in society, what might they face along those lines? Bob Delaney : I first heard those words from [motivational author and corporate coach] Bob Moawad, whom I met courtside at a game in Seattle back in the day. He would whistle, loudly, while the game was going on. I told him, \u201cYou have to stop.\u201d And I said, \u201cRather than you and I going back and forth, why don\u2019t we get together for dinner one time when I\u2019m up here?\u201d I was intrigued by his insights. We developed a friendship. He underlined the words at that first dinner we had. He said, \u201cYou\u2019re not \u2018Bob Delaney, NBA referee.\u2019 You\u2019re \u2018Bob Delaney who happens to be a referee.\u2019 You\u2019re not \u2018Bob Delaney, retired state trooper.\u2019\u201d All of us in our lives put that title next to our names. And while it\u2019s important, we have to remember it\u2019s not who we are, it\u2019s what we do. I think it\u2019s important in so many ways, because when we get stripped of that, whether it\u2019s by retirement or being fired or being sidelined because of the coronavirus, that has a psychological impact. Joel Fish : It reminds me of dealing with an NBA guy last year who was injured badly enough, it could have been career-ending. He was in his seventh year, I think, and he said, \u201cIf you asked me the first day I came into the NBA, \u2018Who are you?\u2019 I would have said, \u2018I\u2019m John Smith, a basketball player.\u2019 But during the last seven years, I\u2019ve used the NBA as a chance to learn about myself and network and develop other relationships. Now I\u2019d say \u2018I\u2019m John Smith, who likes to play basketball.\u2019\u201d You hear the difference. He had grown, he had changed, he had matured. He\u2019s someone who might not be able to play basketball again, but he\u2019s much better positioned to move onto the next phase of his life.  How might this apply during the virus crisis to NBA players and coaches, who are sports people and celebrities? Their sport is shut down. And celebrities seem to matter a lot less when everyone is facing this threat. JF : It\u2019s just that our rhythms have been thrown so out of whack here. You\u2019re going 100 miles per hour in your season and then having the brakes slammed on and you\u2019re going 0 miles per hour. We\u2019re all experiencing it. We may be used to being home a certain number of hours and then working certain hours. Now we may be with our significant person 24\/7. Or an athlete has worked out a relationship in being a parent, being a spouse \u2013 all of a sudden that unique rhythm has been thrown upside down. The same thing with a coach. How do we develop positive coping mechanisms to deal with those feelings, as opposed to negative ones? We\u2019re at a point now in hunkering down where, according to your paper, we\u2019re liable to see or engage in bad behavior, even destructive things that will only make this tougher.  JF : That\u2019s where I think we all sit now, as we enter Week 3 or 4 of this. When it comes to anxiety, depression, risky behaviors \u2013 drinking, drugs, food \u2013 it\u2019s like a snowball going downhill. It gets bigger and bigger. So you might be able to tolerate it for one week, two weeks, being home 24\/7. But Week 3, Week 4, I think we become more vulnerable to the frustration in our relationships. We can go from frustration to irritation to anger to rage. As a way to cope with our free time, two cans of beer can become a six-pack. A six-pack can become six beers and hard liquor. A neighbor as I walked by said, \u201cWe\u2019ve gained 20 pounds in the last three weeks because we\u2019re just home eating.\u201d \u2026 We have to be mindful that there is a cumulative effect of the emotions I\u2019ve talked about. This is a time we need self-awareness and conversations. You\u2019ve noted how different this is from something like a storm or natural disaster, where the threat comes and goes in relatively short period of time. This is open-ended and \u201cout there\u201d somewhere. What effect does that have on people? BD : When there\u2019s no time frame. If we prepare for a hurricane that\u2019s coming or fires in California, there\u2019s a feeling of containment at some point and then 48 to 72 hours later, the sun\u2019s out and people are reconstructing their lives. Without that, there\u2019s the feeling of \u201cI\u2019ve lost control.\u201d JF : I think we\u2019re wired where if we\u2019re told, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be four weeks, then there\u2019s light at the end of the tunnel,\u201d we can hang in there and do the right things for ourselves. But when there\u2019s uncertainty, limbo, a lack of clarity, we\u2019re not wired to respond to that. The game plan that you two came up with, was that something generic one of you pulled out of a file drawer. Or did you brainstorm specifically for this? JF : Bob and I had been friends for a long time. What emerged from our conversation [in Nashville] was the idea for our article. That we were entering uncharted territory. Based on our experiences, what could we offer people that would help them develop some certainty? We both were drawing from our experience in sports, where the goal is always to control what you can and let go what you can\u2019t. What does it look like to be a great teammate in this time of uncertainty? BD : I couldn\u2019t imagine working undercover without knowing who the targets of the investigation were. Knowing the bad guys from the good guys. With this, we\u2019re flying under the hood. We don\u2019t see where the enemy is, but we know it\u2019s there. In the steps you suggest, you have some fundamental stuff. Like developing a daily plan, to bring certainty into some part of your life. BD : The daily plan was a conversation we had early, about actually writing down what you plan to do the next day. Maybe you don\u2019t do it, but at least you had a plan. I even got to the point where I planned out what clothes I was going to wear, because I didn\u2019t want to be in my pajamas at 4 o\u2019clock in the afternoon. JF : To go back to sports, if you have a game plan, you\u2019re going to feel more in control. If you feel more in control, you\u2019re going to be more confident. If you\u2019re more confident, you\u2019re going to make better decisions. You must be able to relate to that, Bob, from your officiating career. BD : Calm confidence, in speaking with referees, allows for better decision-making. When a referee is excited or gets caught up in the intensity of the game, they need to push themselves below that to maintain a calm confidence. To me, Danny Crawford and Steve Javie were the two who were the best at that. One decision you recommend is to limit our time on social media. Some of us live these days on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. Can too much information be bad? BD : What we\u2019re interacting with is the virus, the market and the politics, to be honest. Because that\u2019s what\u2019s being pushed out by all media. No matter what channel we turn to, we\u2019ve all become either the Yankees or the Mets. You root for one team or the other, but right now, this is about all of us. We know from being involved in sports, the teams that are great have that \u201cwe\u201d attitude.   Finding that \u201cwe\u201d on social media is a lot more rare than finding it in real relationships you have with family and friends. How do those help? BD : You need a space of trust with another person to speak about your true feelings. With our families, though, you might put on even a stronger face. I heard this all the time from firefighters after 9\/11 \u2013 they\u2019d be on the pile for 12 hours a day, they\u2019d get in the car and cry the entire way home, but when they walked in the house they\u2019d put the face on to show strength because they didn\u2019t want their families to be afraid. I think there\u2019s a level of that that takes place in all our lives. It\u2019s OK to be vulnerable. We all like to think we can leap tall building in a single bound. I can handle this. And by having this game plan when the rhythm of life has been disrupted, we can create another rhythm that gives us discipline. Some of the steps are skills to use today. Others \u2013 like \u201cBe open to trying new leisure time activities\u201d or \u201cRecognize that change is difficult\u201d \u2013 sound like things we can take with us into tomorrow. JF : I believe at the interpersonal level, there is opportunity to learn more about ourselves and more about somebody else. Set goals for certain skills we can improve, especially things like patience, listening, empathy, compassion. Or even to be more assertive, to advocate more for ourselves in certain situations. BD : I read a book many years ago called \u201cTransitions: Making the Most of Life\u2019s Changes\u201d by William Bridges. A part I highlighted and read to myself quite often says, \u201cChange is situational. Transition is psychological.\u201d Understanding change is moving the furniture around. The actual transition is embracing the new look that has taken place. Another 9\/11 parallel.  BD : We are not going to flip a switch after this and go back to what we were. This is changing us fundamentally. Embrace it. I said the same things to referees when the Replay Center was being put in: \u201cEmbrace the technology. It\u2019s not going away.\u201d If you fight it, you\u2019re going to be left behind. So become knowledgeable about it and become welcoming to it. We\u2019re learning about some friends and family members on several new scales now, such as fear to bravado, risk aversion to risk tolerance, pessimism to optimism. JF : I think positive thinking is a skill. You can either see that cup as half full or half empty. Many of us are worried, what if things get worse? But let\u2019s take a chance to think, what if something good happens today? What if you were pleasantly surprised tomorrow, what might that be? That fits with your suggestion to find opportunities during this shutdown, and carry them forward when we come out of it. JF : I hope we\u2019re able to hold onto some of the clarity we have now, so we don\u2019t fall back into habits where we\u2019re thinking \u201cme vs. we\u201d or taking things for granted and losing perspective on things. We all have heard about the retired or injured player who says, \u201cIf I could play just one more game.\u201d Or a fan who says, \u201cIf I could go to just one more game.\u201d I just hope the leagues and the players and the fans are able to hold onto the perspective of how much sports means to our lives when it\u2019s back. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Terrapins coach Mark Turgeon was appreciative of Smith\u2019s contribution and looked forward to seeing him perform at the next level. \u201cFrom the minute we started recruiting Jalen, we knew the kind of quality player and person we would be getting and he lived up to it in every way,\u201d Turgeon said. \u201cAs incredible of a player Jalen is on the court, he is that and more as an individual off the court.

Since that March 11 decision, he, the league\u2019s Board of Governors, players and coaches and NBA fans globally have watched as timelines, tactics and medical responses at the federal and state levels change, often day to day. Not quite four weeks in, with the league still on hold Monday as one thread in this international shutdown, Silver offered an honest but sobering update, not just on the $7 billion industry of NBA basketball but perhaps for Americans\u2019 short-term way of life. \u201cSitting here today, I know less than I did then,\u201d the commissioner said. Silver was working from home, as was Ernie Johnson, host of TNT\u2019s \u201cInside The NBA\u201d show. They came together Monday evening for an interview streamed on Twitter under the league\u2019s @NBA handle. The social-media \u201ctalk show\u201d was billed as the first of a series under the banner \u201c#NBATogether with Ernie Johnson.\u201d The idea is that Johnson, the award-winning host of TNT\u2019s studio show, will interview notable guests on Mondays and Wednesdays during the league\u2019s hiatus. Portland All-Star Damian Lillard is scheduled for Wednesday. Highlights will be available after each show at the @NBAonTNT account. In advance of his questions, Johnson noted to Silver how trying this season already had been after a controversy in the fall over the league\u2019s relationships with China, followed by the deaths of former commissioner David Stern and Lakers legend Kobe Bryant in January. Then, with the breaking news on a Wednesday night in Oklahoma City that Utah Jazz center Rudy Gobert had tested positive for the virus, the 2019-20 season changed irrevocably. Silver had answers in the interview that lasted about a half-hour. He just didn\u2019t have answer answers. Remember, after the initial pause and consultation with the league\u2019s owners, Silver threw out a marker of at least 30 days for what already was a great unknown for the sport and its business. That milestone will come and go Friday, with no new cutoff offered by anyone. \u201cWhat that means in terms of our ability to (return) at some point in late spring or summer is still unknown to me,\u201d Silver said. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve told my folks is that, we should just accept at least for the month of April, that we won\u2019t be in position to make any decisions. I don\u2019t think necessarily that means on May 1 we will be.\u201d Silver has seen reports that the virus, and its curve of infection, might be moving \u201cfaster than we thought.\u201d Models have been revised again and again. But the uncertainty crowds out whatever internal planning the NBA has done for finishing the remainder of the regular season, jumping right into the playoffs or setting up some entirely new format. \u201cYes, in a perfect world, we would try to finish the regular season in some form and then move on to the playoffs,\u201d Silver said. \u201cBut what I\u2019ve learned over the last two weeks is we just have too little information to make those predictions. \u201cAs I look out into the summer, there would come a point where we start impacting next season.\u201d So the speculation prevalent on the Internet and social media about how the NBA could return \u2013 televised games without fans in the stands, practice facilities deployed rather than arenas, or some single, neutral site where all games will be played \u2013 is merely that. Silver has maintained from the start \u201cthe health of everyone in the NBA has to come first.\u201d Yet he did address sports as a valued part of American and global life, and an eagerness to lead the way back similar to how he and others led the way in taking precautions. Silver and the commissioners of other major U.S. sports \u2013 including baseball\u2019s Rob Manfred, the NFL\u2019s Roger Goodell, the NHL\u2019s Gary Bettman, the WNBA\u2019s Cath Engelbert and seven others \u2013 took part in a conference call Saturday with President Trump. As Silver described it, it was an opportunity to discuss sports\u2019 place in society, with Trump expressing his longing for live games and the role the leagues might play in America\u2019s recovery from the virus and the resulting economic hardship. \u201cI said when we were all on the call with the President,\u201d Silver said, \u201cwe would love to be part of the movement to restart this economy. That can\u2019t compromise safety. [But] it\u2019s a public health matter to shut down the economy and leave tens of millions of Americans unemployed. It\u2019s a public health matter to isolate people. \u201cWe know our priorities in terms of health and safety. But factoring those things in, where will we be in May? Beyond the virtue of crowning a champion, what will the symbolism be of major league sports starting back up in this country?\u201d Trump and other members of his administration were updated on current measures, such as the NBA\u2019s series of roughly 30 public service announcements encouraging fans to heed the Center for Disease Control\u2019s guidelines. The current \u201cnormal\u201d for most Americans hits home for Silver\u2019s family. He and his wife Maggie are expecting a second daughter in mid-May. That means some anxiety in accessing care in New York area hospitals. Also, their first child, Louise, will turn 3 years old this month. She can\u2019t grasp the reason she\u2019s not able to hug her nearby grandparents, so it\u2019s Skype or FaceTime or other ways of staying connected. \u201cWe just can\u2019t bring her there,\u201d Silver said. Then there is the commissioner\u2019s other \u201cfamily\u201d \u2013 the roughly 55,000 people whose jobs hinge on the NBA. They are of particular concern, he said, on top of \u201ctens of millions\u201d thrown suddenly into unemployment. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s keeping me up at night,\u201d Silver said. \u201cThose people\u2019s jobs. Their safety when they come back to work.\u201d Silver\u2019s silver lining? That the stay-at-home instructions have led to more time for him to think this forward, imagining the league and the culture once this crisis subsides. He has made a hobby, he said, of exploring new technologies for communicating and imagining how they might affect this league. \u201cHow will this change the NBA experience? What will game production look like?\u201d he said. \u201cWe will get through this as a country. There will be a vaccine. \u2026 What will the NBA world look like (beyond)  this coronavirus? Will there be more virtual ways for people to experience the game? \u201cI also have tremendous belief in this country. What\u2019s amazing about Americans is not only their resilience, but their innovation.\u201d Virtual can be good. Real, live, in the stands and on TV screens will be better. At some point. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

He returned to the Cardinals and was named Atlantic Coast Conference preseason player of the year before going on to average 18 points and 7.7 rebounds per game while shooting 44% from the field. The 6-foot-7 Nwora was named to the AP\u2019s All-ACC first team. The Buffalo, New York, native said on his verified Twitter account that the abrupt end to the season was \u201cheartbreaking and awful\u201d because he believed No. 14 Louisville (24-7) was ready to win the NCAA championship. But he noted that community health and safety should be the priority because of the coronavirus pandemic. Nwora called Cardinal teammates and coaches his family in his post and added, \u201cI will proudly represent Louisville wherever I go.\u201d"},{"id":27990,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nba-together-ernie-johnson-official-release","date":"2020-04-06","title":"NBA Digital launches '#NBATogether with Ernie Johnson' on Twitter","content":" WHO \u2022 Ernie Johnson , TNT\u2019s Inside the NBA host \u2022 Upcoming guests include NBA Commissioner Adam Silver and five-time NBA All-Star and Portland Trail Blazers guard Damian Lillard WHAT :     NBA Digital, jointly managed by the NBA and Turner Sports, will launch \u201c#NBATogether with Ernie Johnson,\u201d a new social talk show hosted by TNT\u2019s Inside the NBA host Ernie Johnson, featuring high-profile guests from across the basketball community. \u201c#NBATogether with Ernie Johnson\u201d will stream on the NBA\u2019s Twitter account ( @NBA ) Monday and Wednesday nights during the season hiatus as part of the new #NBATogetherLive initiative.

Asked who would win the 2020 NBA championship, Young didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cThe Lakers, for sure,\u201d Young said. \u201cBron was on a different mission. It was the craziest thing I\u2019ve ever seen. That\u2019s why he\u2019s the greatest in my eyes, bro.\u201d Before falling 104-102 to the Brooklyn Nets in their last game before the NBA suspended the season, the Lakers had won four straight games, and 13 of their last 16 dating to Feb. 1. Here\u2019s a quick rundown of some of content generated by players around the NBA as they await the all-clear to resume the season: * * * Vince Carter isn\u2019t spending time pondering whether he\u2019s taken his last shot in the NBA. The 22-year veteran made that clear Wednesday on The Ringer\u2019s \u201cWinging It with Vince Carter and Annie Finberg\u201d podcast. Near the end of Atlanta\u2019s 136-131 overtime loss on Mar. 11 to the New York Knicks, news started to spread around State Farm Arena that the NBA had suspended the season. The reality of the situation, and the fact Carter was playing his final season, led the crowd to start chanting the veteran\u2019s name. \u201cI didn\u2019t really think about it potentially being my last game or anything like that until our great friend Dewayne Dedmon [said something],\u201d Carter explained on the podcast. \u201cHe\u2019s like, \u2018Man, this might be your last one. They could possibly end the season right here.\u2019 I was just like, \u2018That would be crazy.\u2019 Then all of a sudden you start hearing cheers because I guess it kind of hit everybody else. DeAndre\u2019 Bembry was like pushing me on the court. I\u2019m like, \u2018Nah, chill man, I\u2019m good.\u2019\u201d Then the crowd started chanting again. \u201cRight then, it\u2019s like a chill just hit me. As I checked in, it was kind of like the reality of it. I just wanted to get a shot off. Obviously, you always want to make your last one because you never know. They were like, \u2018Dunk it, dunk it.\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018Look, I was sitting on the bench too long to attempt a dunk.\u2019 At this point, sitting there that long, I\u2019m like, \u2018Three points is more than two any day of the week. I\u2019m gonna shoot the 3-ball.\u2019 I was just happy I was able to get the ball there. It was just mind over matter at that point. So, Trae [Young] throws the ball, and I take my one-two step and just shoot it like I\u2019ve been playing the whole game. It\u2019s giving me chills right now.\u201d Carter nailed the shot \u2014 all net. http:\/\/twitter.com\/ringernba\/status\/1245367314750545920?s http:\/\/twitter.com\/ringernba\/status\/1245367314750545920?s http:\/\/twitter.com\/ringernba\/status\/1245367314750545920?s  * * * Former teammates DeMar DeRozan and Pascal Siakam caught up with one another via Instagram Live for a wide-ranging conversation . While they agree that Kyle Lowry is the greatest player in Toronto franchise history, DeRozan believes Siakam can pass up the point guard at some point. DeRozan said he makes it a point to tell people that, too. \u201cYou got the full blueprint, bro, to even pass [Lowry],\u201d DeRozan told Siakam. \u201cYou got the full blueprint, you done seen it all. People forget your rookie year, [Jared Sullinger] was hurt, and you started with us and we was hooping. I tell everybody, people forget Pascal played with us. Then you\u2019ll go play in the G-League, hoop, then come back and play with us. You were always consistently hooping. Then to see how much we were hooping, how serious we took it, and you just fell in with it. That\u2019s the ultimate cheat code you have. I tell everybody that story.\u201d * * * Butler and Carmelo Anthony conducted a \u201cWhat in Your Glass\u201d Instagram chat, and the pair discussed wine, and wine culture around the NBA, as well as the ways they\u2019re coping with the suspension of the season. \u201cWhen I tell you I ain\u2019t been doing nothing but drinking wine and working out, I mean I ain\u2019t been doing nothing but drinking wine and working out,\u201d Butler said. \u201cI\u2019m waiting for this thing to blow over.\u201d Butler jokingly admitted \u201cI\u2019m losing my damn mind here\u201d due to the time away from the court, adding that he trains intensively to maintain some level of normalcy as he and the rest of the league continues to practice social distancing. Interestingly, Butler said the doesn\u2019t \u201ceven have a video game console.\u201d So, he\u2019s spending extra time with his family, in addition to drinking wine and training. In the conversation, which lasted more than 50 minutes, Butler also explained to Anthony how he became a fan of Sassicia wines. Butler said he\u2019s got between 500 and 600 bottles of Sassicia 2010 in his collection. Butler said he tried it for the first time in 2013 in Chicago with actor Mark Wahlberg on the set of a Transformers movie. \u201cIt\u2019s because that\u2019s the first wine besides Mad Dog 20\/20, when I wasn\u2019t supposed to be drinking it, that I ever had,\u201d Butler said. \u201cSo, I\u2019m biased to that because that\u2019s what I was introduced to. So, I was introduced to what\u2019s one of the best wines in the world. That\u2019s not all I drink. 2010 is probably the most that I have. That\u2019s what wine is about: to be able to tell the story that goes with that wine. The first wine that I had: 2010 Sassicia with Mark Wahlberg. Damn, I got to have wine with Mark Wahlberg.\u201d * * * Leave it to King James to put out a tweet that would whet the world\u2019s appetite for more of his unique insight. James posted that he\u2019s \u201cthinking about maybe sitting down and breaking down some of my most memorable games and moments in my career\u201d on Instagram Live or just filming his thoughts to hold on to it \u201cfor another time.\u201d http:\/\/twitter.com\/KingJames\/status\/1245542627082039296?s If you\u2019ve ever spent any time around James, you\u2019ll quickly learn that he\u2019s got a near-photographic memory of every play in a given game and can discuss those moments with tremendous insight and clarity. James has played in 1,258 games and captured three championships, so he\u2019s got plenty of moments to ponder ranging from his early career in Cleveland to the days in Miami and then back to the Cavaliers for a title. Stay tuned. http:\/\/twitter.com\/KingJames\/status\/1245542627082039296?s * * * Oklahoma City point guard Chris Paul played for the LA Clippers from 2011-17, spending seven seasons competing alongside former teammate Blake Griffin. Talking to Stephen Jackson and former Clippers teammate Matt Barnes on the duo\u2019s \u201cAll the Smoke\u201d podcast, Paul admitted he appreciates Griffin much more now. Reminiscing about the Lob City days with the Clippers, when they tossed alley-oops with ease to high-risers Griffin and DeAndre Jordan, Paul called the situation \u201cone of those things you don\u2019t realize what you have until it\u2019s gone.\u201d Paul is in his first season with the Thunder, while Griffin is in Year 3 with the Detroit Pistons. \u201cI think about it at times,\u201d Paul said. \u201cAnd me and Blake Griffin absolutely had our issues here and there. But I actually appreciated Blake probably a lot more after I left.\u201d The Clippers traded Paul to the Houston Rockets in June of 2017. * * * Despite currently being out of the league, Isaiah Thomas continues to maintain an optimistic perspective. A two-time NBA All-Star, Thomas took part in a 21-minute interview on the Wizard Talk podcast , and expressed confidence that he\u2019ll receive another opportunity soon in the league, where he plans to play until he\u2019s 40 years old. Thomas joined the Wizards on a one-year deal last summer, but the team traded him to the LA Clippers at the trade deadline. The Clippers, to Thomas\u2019 surprise, waived him in February, opting instead to sign Reggie Jackson. \u201cI have a lot left in the tank and my goal has always been to play until 40,\u201d Thomas said, \u201cand I\u2019m going to try everything I can to reach that.\u201d Thomas averaged 12.2 points per game during his 40-game tenure with the Wizards, shooting 40.8% from the floor and 41.3% from 3-point range, while averaging 3.7 assists. Thomas produced arguably his best game as a Wizard on Dec. 16, when he scored 23 points on 9-of-13 from the floor and 5-of-7 from deep to go with six assists. Thomas is confident he can return to playing at that level consistently. Thomas underwent surgery after suffering a torn hip labrum in the 2017 playoffs and has struggled to regain form in stints with the Cavaliers, Lakers, Nuggets and Wizards. He\u2019s not giving up hope. \u201cRight now, physically, I\u2019m great,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to stay physically sharp as best as I can throughout this situation, and what\u2019s next for me is waiting for the next opportunity in the NBA.\u201d * * * Michael C.

It goes something like this: We\u2019ll never see another like him again.  And this is often taken and accepted as gospel until one day in the future when greatness comes in another human form and sure enough, we\u2019re witnessing someone like him again. Therefore, these bold statements simply aren\u2019t true. Well, OK, perhaps in the isolated case of Muggsy Bogues, because it\u2019s hard to fathom another 5-foot-3 player lasting 14 years on the highest level of a tall man\u2019s game. But, sticking to the topic with regard to truly great players, they eventually regenerate at some point, mainly a few generations in the future, wearing uglier sneakers. \u2022 Complete list of 2020 Hall of Fame honorees So let\u2019s all agree on that much. However, do not wait for the next Tim Duncan and Kevin Garnett and Kobe Bryant to come down the lane. None of us will ever be around that long. Duncan is an outlier because players who stay four years in college these days are lucky to last that long in the NBA. Also: Will the next superstar who doesn\u2019t care about creating a brand or compiling Twitter followers and is willing to take below-market money to keep his team in championship contention for more than two decades please take one step forward? Hello? Meanwhile, Garnett and Kobe are almost impossible to copy for the complete opposite reason; they bypassed college altogether and yes, there is ongoing discussion in power circles to lift the one-and-done restriction and give high school seniors the right to jump straight to the NBA again. That said, the journey is treacherous; the basketball graveyard is overflowing with teens who tried that leap and missed the ledge completely, let alone found safe landing in the Hall of Fame . Oh yes, the Hall of Fame. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve gathered here today, to study the slam-dunk inclusions of Timmy, Kobe and KG, and that actually doesn\u2019t involve much brain intensity at all. These are three players who captured imaginations in their own distinct ways, became all-time greats at their positions and arguably were the league\u2019s finest players from beginning to end of the 2000 decade (for you LeBron James worshippers, remember he didn\u2019t crash the party until 2003-04, so pipe down). These three won 11 championships, four MVPs, were named All-NBA First Team 25 times, made All-Defensive First Team 26 times and were All-Stars a combined 48 times. Meanwhile, the level of respect they carried can\u2019t be categorized or described using pure numbers or stats. Duncan was the epicenter of a Spurs\u2019 dynasty that kept the team locked in the championship hunt year after year after year, and from a consistency standpoint was second only to the Bill Russell Celtics. Garnett by himself was worth the price of admission in Minnesota \u2014 even during lean years \u2014 and then proved an instant jackpot in Boston the moment he arrived to bolster the Celtics. Kobe teamed with Shaquille O\u2019Neal to form a historic 1-2 punch and then years later managed to win back-to-back titles without Shaq while setting a high standard for scoring along the way. While it is proper to scan their careers and regurgitate all the significant data that made them legends, perhaps it\u2019s more meaningful to cite why these three players will be difficult to mutate as the league moves onto the next batch of superstars-in-waiting. Therefore, we begin \u2026 Tim Duncan Had his growth stopped at a more normal height, Duncan would\u2019ve stuck with swimming while growing up in St. Croix in an effort to compete with his two sisters, one of whom, Tricia, made the 1988 Summer Olympics for the U.S. Virgin Islands. And because Tim was reasonably good but not Phelpsian, his athletic life likely would\u2019ve died on the vine right there in the pool. Also, only a handful of colleges knew of Duncan and none were hoops powerhouses. It\u2019s exceedingly rare, in the age of specialized scouting and AAU travel ball and high school national tournaments, that a future Hall of Famer can slip through the cracks. But here we are. Because Duncan was not overly gifted athletically, he leaned on fundamentals for survival at Wake Forest. That would serve him well and set him apart from rivals for the next 20 years. Again, it will be some time before a player of Duncan\u2019s level manages to thrive mainly on post moves and a bank shot; those are now considered your grandfather\u2019s style of play. And of course, Duncan stayed all four years in college. Jerry West said Duncan would\u2019ve been the first overall pick had he left after his sophomore season. That was the unspectacular 1995 draft when Joe Smith, a tweener forward, was taken first overall. One reason Duncan delayed the NBA was a promise made to his late mother that he would get his degree, and he saw a continuation at Wake as a more sensible option, rather than leaving early and returning to campus in multiple summers to get the credits. Duncan stayed with one NBA team his entire 19-year career. Only Dirk Nowitzki (21 years with Dallas) and Kobe (20 with the Lakers) had longer time with one franchise. That singular connection is now almost non-existent in a league obsessed with free agency. Duncan\u2019s loyalty to the Spurs was tested only once, in the 2000 offseason. A grand plan by Orlando to place Duncan next to Grant Hill and Tracy McGrady was nixed when Duncan\u2019s teammate, David Robinson, cut short a Hawaiian vacation to fly home and convince Duncan to stay put. Duncan also put the Spurs ahead of his financial well-being in order to keep the small-market team competitive in the salary cap era. Well, first, some perspective: Anyone who earned almost $250 million in salary didn\u2019t exactly starve. Still, Duncan was never the highest-paid player in any single season, and in his prime he made less than Jermaine O\u2019Neal, Michael Finley, Rashard Lewis and Stephon Marbury, among others. When Duncan made All-NBA First Team and averaged 17.8 points, 9.9 rebounds and 2.7 blocks at the still productive age of 36, he ranked 61st in salary. Finally, he was refreshingly anti-commercial despite playing his prime in the soaring technology of 24-hour sports TV and, near the end of his run, social media. He never desired to have his own line of sneakers and refused to market himself for endorsement cash. Again, with personal branding and attention-getting all the rage now, he will be next to impossible to replicate. The only NBA coach he ever knew, Gregg Popovich, said after Duncan\u2019s retirement: \u201cI would not be standing here if it wasn\u2019t for Tim Duncan \u2026 He\u2019s made livings for hundreds of us, staff and coaches, over the years, and never said a word. Just came to work every day. Came early. Stayed late. Was there for every single person, from the top of the roster to the bottom of the roster because that\u2019s who he was, in all those respects. \u201cYou don\u2019t see Timmy beating his chest as if he was the first human being to dunk the basketball, as a lot of people do these days. He\u2019s not pointing to the sky. He\u2019s not glamming to the cameras. He just plays, and we\u2019ve seen it for so long it\u2019s become almost mundane. But it\u2019s so special that is has to be remembered. He\u2019s irreplaceable. It can\u2019t happen. We\u2019re all unique \u2014 I guess each one of us is unique \u2014 but he\u2019s been so important to so many people it\u2019s just mind-boggling.\u201d Kevin Garnett As the NBA decade left the 1990s and blew into the 2000s, there was a shift in philosophy. The age of specialization took hold and players, especially big men, weren\u2019t required to develop more than one or two skills. The term \u201cone dimensional player\u201d was embraced and often handsomely rewarded; for example, Ben Wallace never worked on dribbling, shooting or passing and made a fortune anyway. But, KG was having none of that. His refusal to \u201csettle\u201d is what separated him from many in his generation. Garnett was further along defensively than offensively when he arrived as a raw 18-year-old; surprising in hindsight he only made second team All-Rookie. But within a few years he became a force with the ball. Once he reached his peak years, KG was capable of dominating at both ends \u2014 again, quite uncommon among big men at that time. He is one of only four players to win MVP and Defensive Player of the Year. He brought the same intensity to both ends of the floor; KG could rattle players with a blocked shot and then follow with his own dunk on the other end. At his peak, he led the league in rebounding four straight years. And obviously he rejuvenated the Celtics franchise by becoming the emotional and spiritual furnace in Boston, providing interior defense as a 6-11 power forward not seen in that city since Bill Russell. What made Garnett truly unique was his NBA launching. The league hadn\u2019t chosen a player straight from high school in 20 years when Garnett was taken fifth overall in 1995. His gradual success was good for Minnesota, but the copycat league quickly became disillusioned with the idea of drafting teenagers. Too many preps were simply not ready physically or mentality for a grown man\u2019s game and a large majority either flamed out or never reached expectations. Basically, teams rolled the dice, paid out big salaries, and wound up cutting their losses. Here\u2019s the raw data. Before the league and the union instituted age limits in 2005, there were 45 players drafted straight from high school. Only three won MVPs (Garnett, Kobe, LeBron). This doesn\u2019t include dozens of other players who didn\u2019t jump directly from high school but never played college ball, such as Shawn Kemp and Brandon Jennings. It\u2019s hard to place a universal definition on success \u2014 does a 10-year-career as a role player count? \u2014 but in terms of prep players reaching the Hall, that distinction likely whittles down to a half dozen or so who are either already in (Tracy McGrady, Moses Malone) or on their way (LeBron, Dwight Howard). Garnett dodged all the traps. Fortunate enough to play in small market Minneapolis, he was able to mature without much media glare, and he took care of his body. He had solid mentors, most notably teammate Sam Mitchell, who steered him straight. And Garnett also had a second act. Once freed from the chill of Minnesota, where he stayed 12 years with the Timberwolves but was never blessed with enough help to win a title, Garnett paid off instantly in Boston. The Celtics won a championship in his first year and arguably could\u2019ve had multiple titles had it not been for other mishaps, most notably when Garnett suffered a knee injury that caused him to miss the entire 2009 playoffs. Here\u2019s his coach in Boston, Doc Rivers , after the Celtics announced his jersey retirement: \u201cI\u2019ve often said about him, he\u2019s the greatest superstar role player ever. He was a superstar, but he played his role for the team anyway, somehow. I don\u2019t know how he did that, but he did it. He changed the culture of the Celtics franchise. He really did. We needed a guy like that to come to the franchise, and he did that and it\u2019s still there. It hasn\u2019t left since. That was all Garnett.\u201d  Kobe Bryant In a generation that began to gravitate not only towards the NBA but certain players who came with identifiable swagger and an \u201cit\u201d factor, Kobe connected on multiple levels. He was a teen idol at first, then someone who tried to be like Michael Jordan and damn near succeeded, and finally an icon known for a combustible mixture of talent and tenacity. That\u2019s a lot to digest and tough to duplicate. Basically, Kobe was a big winner and an international box office smash. Many players in the Hall of Fame are one or the other, not both. That\u2019s only one reason why \u201cthe next Kobe\u201d is so far in the future you\u2019ll need to squint. Here are other reasons: Skipped college, two decades with only one team, three straight titles and five overall, 81 points, 60 points. Sadly, his appeal was so vast that he had millions around the world dropping tears when he died Jan. 26 in a tragic helicopter crash. Plus, it\u2019s fairly accurate to say Kobe had only one season out of 20 that could be considered a down year. That was his rookie season when Lakers coach Del Harris wanted to bring him along slowly, so Kobe only played 15 minutes a night off the bench and averaged 7.6 points. Imagine, discounting the 2013-14 season when he tore his Achilles, each of his other 18 seasons ranged from supernova to very good. How many others have had that success percentage? How many will match in the future? Kobe rarely distanced himself from the moment or the ball with the game on the line. Even Hall of Famers aren\u2019t wired that way. He was willing to accept the grief and fallout that came from missing the big shot; actually, none of that factored into his thinking with the game clock winding down. That\u2019s one of the ingredients that separate all-time greats from the rest. Despite the slow start to his career, Kobe still finished third on the all-time scoring list when he retired (since passed by LeBron) and made All-Defensive First Team nine times. That two-way balance is enjoyed by a select few. Also consider the depth to Kobe\u2019s game. He had few if any weaknesses, none that made him vulnerable at either end of the floor. He could finish at the rim with his left or right hand. He was an emphatic dunker. His turnaround jumper was solid from mid-range. While his career three-point accuracy of 33 percent is considered average, Kobe was better from that distance in his prime years and always seemed to make them in big moments. On defense, he cut down passing lanes with his quickness and almost always ranked among the league leaders in steals. In his 17th season, before his Achilles injury, Kobe averaged 27.3 points on 46% shooting, 5.6 rebounds and six assists while burning 38 minutes a night. That\u2019s a workload beyond many 34-year-olds, his age at the time. Finally, keep in mind that Kobe was just 6-foot-6 and 212 pounds. On the all-time scoring lists and also among most players who are considered the greatest of all time, Kobe comes up small in terms of size. Inch for inch and pound for pound, he has few peers. The coach for much of his career, Phil Jackson, had battles with Kobe, but said: \u201cI\u2019ve always seen Kobe as a truly great player, an intelligent guy and a remarkable person. He was often misunderstood, but there was no doubting his competitive fire and his desire to win games.\u201d And so: Kobe Bryant, Kevin Garnett and Tim Duncan up for induction to the Hall of Fame in the same year? We\u2019ll never see anything like this again. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years. You can e-mail him  here , find his archive here   and follow him on  Twitter  .

What the reigning MVP isn\u2019t doing very often is shooting baskets since the NBA has closed team practice facilities. \u201cI don\u2019t have access to a hoop,\u201d the Milwaukee Bucks forward said Friday during a conference call. \u201cA lot of NBA players might have a court in their house or something, I don\u2019t know, but now I just get my home workouts, [go] on the bike, treadmill, lift weights, stay sharp that way.\u201d The hiatus is forcing thousands of athletes, pro and otherwise, to work out from home as they try to keep in shape. Equipment varies from player to player, too. \u201cIt all comes down to what they have and what they\u2019re capable of doing,\u201d Atlanta Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce said. \u201cWe can do a lot of body weight stuff. That\u2019s how they stay ready. That\u2019s the most I can offer as a coach for them to stay ready. I can\u2019t say \u2018Hey, can you find access to a gym?\u2019 That would be bad management on my part.\u2019\u201d For instance, Pierce said Hawks guard Kevin Huerter has access to a gym in New York and guard Jeff Teague owns a gym in Indiana. Other players face different situations. \u201cI\u2019ve seen LeBron\u2019s Instagram,\u201d Pierce said of Los Angeles Lakers superstar LeBron James. \u201cLeBron has a house with a full weight room and he has an outdoor court. He\u2019s got a different reality right now that gives him a little more access to continue the normal. [Hawks rookie] Cam Reddish lives in an apartment and it\u2019s probably a two-bedroom apartment. He can\u2019t go in the apartment weight room because it\u2019s a public facility. So he\u2019s limited in all things.\u201d Bucks coach Mike Budenhlolzer said he wanted his players to focus on keeping their bodies in shape and conceded that logistics surrounding the pandemic would make it tougher for them to do any basketball-specific activities. The Bucks are still finding ways to stay sharp. Bucks players said team officials have made sure they all have the necessary exercise equipment. Antetokounmpo noted the Bucks also had a catering company bring food to make sure they maintain a proper diet. Center Brook Lopez said workout plans have been sent to them via a phone app. \u201cThey\u2019ve done a really good job of getting everything taken care of and still having tailored workouts for each individual player despite the situation,\u201d Lopez said. But it\u2019s difficult for them to work on their shooting without access to a court. \u201cSince the practice facility is closed down, I don\u2019t have any access to a basketball goal unless I go to one of my neighbors\u2019 houses and shoot outside,\u201d Bucks forward Khris Middleton said. \u201cThere\u2019s really no basketball for me. It\u2019s basically like Giannis said. Treadmill, jump rope, some weights and that\u2019s it. I have a couple of basketballs I can dribble in my house or outside, but no actual goal to shoot on.\u201d Pierce noted that Huerter recently asked him when players would be able to get back into the Hawks\u2019 practice facility. \u201cI told him, \u2018I\u2019ll tell you when we won\u2019t,'\u201d Pierce said. \u201cWe won\u2019t in April.\u201d * * * AP Sports Writer Charles Odum in Atlanta contributed to this report. * * *"},{"id":28007,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/wnba-postpone-start-2020-regular-season","date":"2020-04-03","title":"WNBA to postpone start of 2020 regular season","content":"NEW YORK \u2013 WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert released the following statement: \u201cAs developments continue to emerge around the COVID-19 pandemic, including the extension of the social distancing guidelines in the United States through April 30, the WNBA will postpone the start of its training camps and tip of the regular season originally scheduled for May 15.

Of course, nobody knows what they\u2019re planning for \u2014 or when these plans will get used. A stoppage in play doesn\u2019t mean vacation time has arrived for NBA coaches, especially those like Clifford in position to take their teams to the postseason \u2014 assuming this pandemic-interrupted season is able to resume. They\u2019re all spending more time at home, not able to run practices, but none seem to be sitting idly either. \u201cNot knowing the restart date is the toughest challenge professionally,\u201d Clifford said. \u201cObviously, we\u2019re all limited in what we can do, and basketball takes a back seat right now to family and health. But I will say this: When I talk to our guys, the one common question that comes up is \u2018When do you think we can start again?\u2019\u201d And that\u2019s a question with no answer. The waiting game is the only game in town right now. Miami coach Erik Spoelstra was coaching the fourth quarter against Charlotte on March 11 when the NBA announced it was suspending the season, a move made once it became known that Utah center Rudy Gobert was the league\u2019s first player to test positive for COVID-19. Spoelstra found out right after the final buzzer, as he walked to the Heat locker room. He instantly realized that losing to the Hornets that night didn\u2019t ultimately matter much. Spoelstra and his staff are holding Zoom meetings every other day, but he\u2019s also enjoying the benefits of time away \u2014 getting more time with his two young sons, his wife and grilling for the family most nights \u2014 and is emphasizing to his coaches and players that this is a time to help those less fortunate. He\u2019s checking the news as well, on a limited basis. \u201cMy routine is checking after dinner, and I usually get on my computer, watch a little bit of what\u2019s going on,\u201d said Spoelstra, who often wears a T-shirt emblazoned with \u201cStay Positive\u201d and like many coaches he taped a video telling fans the importance of hand-washing and other precautions. \u201cSo, I\u2019m staying abreast of the current status of things, but I definitely do not try to start my day that way and I do not obsess about it during the day.\u201d Dallas coach Rick Carlisle also went the video-message route, doing one for the going-stir-crazy crowd to demonstrate his \u201cBalance, Balance, Shot Drill\u201d that allows players to work on their shooting form even when they don\u2019t have access to a court or a rim. Oklahoma City coach Billy Donovan took advantage of downtime to appear on a virtual coaches clinic, and had a safety message for those who attended \u2014 online, of course \u2014 before spending about an hour breaking down his philosophy. This is the first in-season stoppage of its kind in NBA history, but Milwaukee coach Mike Budenholzer is equating the unknown \u2014 in terms of when the next game will be \u2014 to what the league went through with lockout-shortened seasons in 1998-99 and 2011-12. His message to his staff: Things may be slow now, but when the suspension ends the pace of everything will be frantic. So while some projects like things in the video room and breakdowns of his roster are being tackled, Budenholzer is also having staff get ready for potential playoff opponents with a first-round series against either Brooklyn or Orlando likely for the NBA-leading Bucks. \u201cThings happen really fast, whether it\u2019s three games in three nights, or playoff series are shorter or the time between the end of the regular season to the first playoff game, everything can be shorter or can happen quicker,\u201d Budenholzer said. \u201cWe can put a little bit of money in the bank now with preparation for first round but also if you go a little bit deeper, the East.\u201d For 30 teams, 30 coaches, there\u2019s many ways to spend the down time. And they all know that they\u2019re in the same boat \u2014 waiting and wondering. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for all of us,\u201d Clifford said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to set a plan for yourself that will have you ready.

In response to the COVID-19 crisis, Josh Harris and David Blitzer \u2014 co-founders of Harris Blitzer Sports and Entertainment (HBSE), which owns both the Philadelphia 76ers and the New Jersey Devils \u2014 have stepped up to help their communities in the areas of hunger relief, education and supporting the medical community with multi-million dollar commitments to organizations across the cities of Philadelphia,  Camden and Newark. \u201cAs so many around the country look to their neighbors for help, I\u2019m proud of the Sixers for being a part of our city\u2019s unified COVID-19 response effort,\u201d Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney told NBA.com. \u201cTheir support for the most vulnerable in Philadelphia \u2014 providing technology for children learning at home, meals to people experiencing hunger, and aid for healthcare workers on the front lines of the crisis \u2014 is an example of not just corporate citizenship, but of brotherly love.\u201d Feeding the Hungry On Monday, Harris, Blitzer, the Sixers and the Sixers Youth Foundation made a six-figure donation to Philabundance \u2013 a local nonprofit organization aimed at feeding the hungry in the Philadelphia community. The Sixers\u2019 donation will be used to provide 20,000 boxes of food that will feed 160,000 people during this critical time of need. \u201cThis amazing show of support from the 76ers and its leadership will go a long way to helping us continue to purchase food and distribute it to our network of partners to help feed those in need,\u201d said Philabundance Executive Director, Glenn Bergman . Philabundance is part of \u2018The Philly Pledge,\u2019 a group that Sixers star Ben Simmons helped establish last week to highlight verified non-profit organizations in the Greater Philadelphia area that are helping during the COVID-19 crisis. Last Friday, HBSE and the Devils Care Foundation made a six-figure donation to the city of Newark for a program that provides groceries to city families in need during the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cThis food relief program, which will benefit thousands of families in Newark, would not have been possible without a critical donation from Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment and the New Jersey Devils,\u201d said Newark Mayor Ras Baraka in a statement .

This included nearly 7,000 pairs of gloves, more than 10,000 hand sanitizer units, soap, sprays, wipes and cleaning supplies. In addition to giving the supplies that were on hand at the Devils\u2019 home arena, the team also made a significant financial contribution to the RWJBarnabas Health Emergency Response Fund.

The NBA makes every effort to discover that talent, and a new app is helping the league achieve that goal. NBA Global Scout is a mobile AI basketball training application the league launched last month in partnership with NEX Team Inc, the company behind HomeCourt. The free app offers opportunities for players of all skill levels to not only improve their games but also showcase their talent to be discovered for basketball events organized by the NBA and WNBA. The app especially benefits players who might lack resources or not get much exposure because they live in regions where basketball isn\u2019t as popular, said Alex Wu, founding team member and VP of Strategy and Partnerships of NEX Team. \u201cWe believe talent is evenly distributed \u2013 we want opportunity to be evenly distributed as well,\u201d said Wu. \u201cIf you\u2019re a kid who loves basketball, but opportunities to develop your game aren\u2019t available, we asked \u2018How do we bridge that gap?\u2019 That\u2019s the audience we\u2019re trying to reach.\u201d The NBA and HomeCourt worked together to develop the NBA Global Scout program. With only an iPhone or iPad, athletes can compete in drills inspired by the NBA Draft Combine. The app uses artificial intelligence to measure an athlete\u2019s wingspan vertical leap and agility and evaluate shooting ability and overall skills. Over the long term, HomeCourt and the NBA will integrate other types of scouting content into the platform like game video, highlights, statistics and more. The app helps the NBA\u2019s longstanding effort to spread the game of basketball around the globe. The league has NBA Academies in five countries that provide year-round development for elite international prospects, a Jr. NBA program that reaches millions of children worldwide and annual Basketball Without Borders (BWB) camps around the world that have seen nearly 70 former campers drafted into the NBA or signed as free agents. Almost 25 percent of NBA players were born outside the United States. The NBA Global Scout program was launched at the Basketball Without Borders Global Camp at NBA All-Star 2020. Oliver-Maxence Prosper, a Montreal native in his final year at the NBA Academy Latin America in Mexico City, was among the first to use the new \u201cVirtual Draft Combine\u201d product features.  \u201cIt was really fun,\u201d said Prosper, 17. His metrics have been measured many times, but using his phone was simple \u2013 and accurate. \u201cI was skeptical at first \u2013 how was it going to work, really. But it was easy to do and the numbers lined up with where I thought they should be. If you don\u2019t have all the equipment to do your measurements, having your phone to do them is a good thing.\u201d Prosper, who will play basketball at Clemson University in the fall, continues to use the app in his private workouts. \u201cIt really helps with shooting,\u201d he said. \u201cIt records you then shows the percent you made, your arc height and whether your shot is too flat, your release time. It\u2019s a great way to know specifically what you need to improve.\u201d NBA Global Scout got its start at the 2019 NBA Combine. The NBA and NEX Team were close to officially announcing their partnership and the league invited Alex Wu and his colleagues to attend the Combine. While there, Wu and the others began wondering how technology could replicate the experience for a wider audience. \u201cProspects go to the Combine to show scouts what they\u2019re capable of. This is the same principle,\u201d said Wu. \u201cThis shows the time you put in, the work ethic, the drive, all those intangibles. We know people are putting in the work. The app gives them credit for it.\u201d The NBA evaluates nearly 1,000 prospects each year for programs such as BWB and the academies, said Chris Ebersole, Elite Basketball Lead with the league. The NBA\u2019s International Basketball Operations team spends a lot of time on the road and the app helps them be more efficient, which is especially important now that the coronavirus has curtailed international travel. \u201cWe\u2019re focused on discovering talent at a pretty young age and evaluating as many players are we can. It\u2019s a resource-intensive process,\u201d Ebersole said. \u201cNBA Global Scout allows us to meet the players where they are \u2013 and where they are is on technology. Giving them the opportunity to showcase their skills without us having to see them in person is valuable because we can see athletes that we might not otherwise have heard of.\u201d Ebersole and his International Basketball Operations colleagues put themselves through the drills before NBA All-Star. During the BWB camp, they posted each camper\u2019s metrics on a leaderboard that everyone could see. Out of the 40 male campers who participated, Prosper ranked No. 4 overall, including top five performances in the vertical jump, shuttle run and 300 dribble combo. \u201cThat really got them going,\u201d Ebersole said. \u201cTo see them engage with the app, to compete and try to improve so they could reach the top of the leaderboard, that was a microcosm of what we expect.\u201d * * * Earlier this month, Nex Team Inc. and the NBA announced that Homecourt and all of its features will be free to the public through April to help the global basketball community stay connected and active in response to the coronavirus pandemic."},{"id":28015,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/arizona-state-white-declares-draft","date":"2020-04-02","title":"Arizona State's White declares for NBA Draft","content":" TEMPE, Ariz.

The Sun Devils made the NCAA Tournament each of his first two seasons and were in position to make it three straight for the first time since 1980-81 before the college basketball season was canceled during to the coronoavirus. \u201cI strongly support Mello\u2019s decision to explore the NBA draft process!!\u201d Arizona State coach Bobby Hurley tweeted. Should White and Martin remain in the Draft, the Sun Devils will have several holes to fill next season. Arizona State lost seniors Rob Edwards and Mickey Mitchell to graduation and have had three players enter the transfer portal so far. Khalid Thomas, Elias Valtonen and walk-on Kyle Feit all played sporadically, but their transfers lave Hurley with a thin roster, particularly if White and Martin don\u2019t return."},{"id":28012,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/washington-isaiah-stewart-declares-draft","date":"2020-04-01","title":"Washington's Isaiah Stewart declares for Draft","content":" SEATTLE (AP) \u2014  Washington freshman Isaiah Stewart declared for the NBA Draft Wednesday after becoming a bright spot in an otherwise disappointing season for the Huskies. Stewart was expected to leave Washington after one season even before he set foot on campus. He arrived to huge expectations that he would further Washingtons resurgence under coach Mike Hopkins but the team underachieved and suffered numerous painful close losses. Stewart, a bruising 6-foot-9 forward, was named to the all-Pac-12 first team after averaging 16.6 points and 8.7 rebounds in the regular season, even while opposing defenses focused on stopping his interior game. Stewart also blocked 65 shots and averaged a team-high 32 minutes per game. He is projected as a mid-to-late first-round pick in the June Draft. Announcing his decision, Stewart wrote, Thank you coach Hopkins for always believing in me. I can\u2019t express enough gratitude for the coaching staff that invested in my future and prepared me for the next level. Even with Stewart\u2019s stellar season, the Huskies finished in last place in the Pac-12 at 5-13 following the regular season. They swept the Arizona schools on the road to close out the regular season, but ended the Pac-12 campaign 1-9 in games decided by six points or less. The Huskies lost to Arizona in the first-round of the Pac-12 tournament and finished the season 15-17 overall. Isaiah exemplifies everything you want from a student athlete. He wears his heart on his sleeve, in the way he plays, how he interacts with the community, our fans and everyone he comes into contact with,\u201d Hopkins said in a statement. As a coach, you want to see your players\u2019 dreams come true. His dream of playing in the NBA is becoming a reality.\u201d Stewart is the latest on a list of one-and-done players for Washington that includes Markelle Fultz, Dejounte Murray, Marquese Chriss, Tony Wroten and Spencer Hawes. There could be another name added to that list since freshman Jaden McDaniels could declare for the draft as well. McDaniels is also projected to be a first-round pick."},{"id":28047,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/former-nba-referee-steve-javie-goes-hardwood-homilie","date":"2020-04-01","title":"From hardwood to homilies: Steve Javie's message of hope","content":" The medical threat of COVID-19 is real, with ripple effects breaking like a tsunami. Shuttering citizens indoors. Slamming livelihoods. Crashing an economy that was so robust just weeks ago. With emotional and psychological effects nearly as profound as the physical, the new coronavirus afflicts both the tested and the untested with anxiety, fear and even loneliness that almost hits as hard as the coughing or the fever. Where, in this dreadful time, might folks turn for counsel and a sense of calm? For a segment of people outside Philadelphia, to one of the NBA\u2019s most widely known former referees, an on-court adjudicator considered for many of his 25 years to be one of the league\u2019s toughest officials and quickest whistles. Dread not, says Steve Javie, ordained deacon at St. Andrew\u2019s Catholic Church in Newtown, Pa. \u201cPeople are afraid of what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Javie said in a phone interview last week. \u201cThey\u2019re afraid of the economics, they\u2019re afraid to go out of the house. You have to give them hope that this thing will pass. Now\u2019s the time \u2014 this was a lot of my [recent] homily \u2014 to trust in the Lord.\u201d Javie, 65 and retired from active duty as a referee since 2011, gave his homily a week ago in an empty church. The service was taped on Saturday and streamed on Sunday to parishioners who were sheltering-in-place during the coronavirus outbreak . They could not be there in person, but then, in Javie\u2019s current pursuit, in spirit is what really matters anyway. \u201cUse the time now not just to watch things on Netflix or spend idle time on your computer, but to get closer to the Lord,\u201d Javie responded when asked for isolation tips. \u201cTake time with the family, set time aside to read scripture and talk about it. \u2018What does it mean?\u2019 \u201cMy role is about giving hope, saying \u2018trust in the Lord\u2019 and then reconnecting at a time when they\u2019re telling us to disconnect with each other.\u201d Fans might feel they never really have disconnected from Javie, despite the time that has passed since he \u201cleft the floor,\u201d as old refs tend to say. For one, he has worked since 2012 as a rules analyst and officiating expert on ESPN game broadcasts, a job that puts him in the league\u2019s state-of-the-art Replay Center while regularly delivering him in high def into your family rooms and man caves.  For another, Javie\u2019s profile as a referee was as high as any of his contemporaries, from Joey Crawford to Dick Bavetta. He was notorious, even, in his early years for his temper, for his quick trigger on technical fouls and for ejecting not just Portland\u2019s play-by-play announcer one night but tossing the then-Washington Bullets\u2019 mascot from the game on another. An \u201cenfant terrible\u201d with a \u201cprison warden\u2019s mindset\u201d \u2014 so described by Sports Illustrated \u2014 after reaching the NBA at 30, Javie cooled off, calmed down, became more secure in his calls and in himself and generally matured. He followed a path, in other words, similar to most players as they journey from rookies to veterans. \u201cWatching games on TV with my buddies, they\u2019d be blasting Steve Javie,\u201d longtime NBA ref Danny Crawford said. \u201c\u2018Does he think he\u2019s a cop?\u2019 But I\u2019d tell them, \u2018He runs the game. And he takes no grief. Off the court, he\u2019s the nicest man you\u2019d ever want to meet.\u2019 He just had that take-care-of-business style on the floor.\u201d Bob Delaney spent 24 years officiating in the NBA after being an undercover New Jersey state trooper \u2014 every bit as unexpected as Javie\u2019s post-retirement gig. He started in the NBA one year after Javie and they exited together in 2011. \u201cI never thought Steve was hot-headed,\u201d Delaney said. \u201cHe was a strict disciplinarian. He took an approach similar to what I had, that it was a privilege to play [in the NBA], it wasn\u2019t a right. \u201cAlso, in that time frame, the league had more fights. So we were more pre-emptive. \u2026 It was about controlling the game. Steve, Joey or myself would lead the league in [assessing] technical fouls, but it was from the standpoint of control.\u201d Over time, Javie became one of the NBA\u2019s most respected refs and crew chiefs. Yet the leap from where Javie was to what he\u2019s doing now was a big one, truly a leap of faith. \u201cI\u2019ve been a sports junkie my whole life,\u201d said Javie, who has been self-quarantining more assiduously than most at their home outside Philadelphia \u2014 his wife Mary-ellen visits and cares for her 85-year-old father. \u201cI made a living in sports. I\u2019ve got money in retirement because of sports. When I was a kid, I followed my dad around and my godfather in sports.\u201d Stan Javie worked for 30 years as an NFL back judge, officiating in four Super Bowls. Johnny Stevens, Javie\u2019s godfather, was an American League umpire for nearly as long, working four World Series. \u201cI\u2019d been blessed \u2014 I blow a whistle, I call fouls on millionaires, I travel around and I get paid \u2014 that\u2019s pretty cool. I\u2019ve never had a \u2018Monday morning\u2019 in my life.  \u201cBut I\u2019ve also been blessed with a wife who reminds me to have gratitude and be thankful for what you\u2019ve had. I thought, \u2018I have to leave this Earth doing something better than just this.\u2019 \u201d Javie was in Los Angeles, awaiting surgery to repair a torn cartilage in his right knee in 2000, the first time he had that thought. He had surgery again the next year. He wound up refereeing over 1,500 games, along with 243 playoff games while appearing in 23 NBA Finals games. But by the 2009-10 season, Javie barely was working, his knee so painful that, after games, he\u2019d have to stop for relief halfway between the hotel lobby and his room. To that point, he was living the dream that took shape from his family influences, then got channeled into baseball as a pitching prospect signed into the Baltimore Orioles\u2019 farm system. An arm injury sent him into umpiring instead, from which he veered into basketball officiating following a hiccup with Florida State League baseball administrators.  Javie soon landed in the raggedy Continental Basketball Association in 1981 and stuck there for five seasons. His frustration over limited chances to advance grew, but the CBA was a great, ramshackle place to gain experience and dial up his assertiveness. (An Albany coach named Phil Jackson once chased him down a flight of stairs after Javie had T\u2019d up the future Bulls\u2019 and Lakers\u2019 Zen Master). In 1986, the NBA called. Javie found himself working alongside officiating legends and seeking wisdom from Joey Crawford, Jack Madden and Jake O\u2019Donnell. After games, though single in his first few years, he would huddle on the road with the married vets over beers to pick their brains about the game they\u2019d just worked and so many before that. Once Javie\u2019s temperament caught up to his craft, even the players and coaches he had tossed couldn\u2019t deny him respect.  \u201cI worked with the greatest referees ever \u2014 [Earl] Strom, [Darell] Garretson, [Hugh] Evans, Jake, all those guys \u2014 and Steve was the best referee I ever worked with,\u201d said Joey Crawford, another native of Philadelphia, long a hotbed of NBA officials. \u201cBecause he knew the rules inside and out, he managed the game, and he got plays right. All three of those things, he was fabulous at. And managing the game was probably his best [skill]. He did his job. He went to the next play. If you look at his ejections, he wasn\u2019t like me, going off, screaming at somebody.\u201d  Javie\u2019s new gig involves a whole \u2018nother level of peace. A deacon\u2019s role is to assist the priests at Mass. They can officiate at weddings and baptisms, give Communion and lead prayer at grave sites and funeral homes. Typically deacons lead ministries within the church, such as young adult groups or marriage encounters. At St. Andrew, monsignor Michael Picard schedules the deacons to preach twice a month. In non-virus times, Javie tries to preach once a week, too, at the daily Masses he long has attended. \u201cThe homilies don\u2019t come easy for me,\u201d Javie said. \u201cI do a lot of praying and reading of scriptures, and also commentaries you can look up to give you some ideas. So I would say a Sunday homily that they say should last from five to seven minutes, for me it\u2019s probably two hours [prep and writing] for every minute. Ten to 15 hours.\u201d Standing at the pulpit, ministering to worshipers, would seem quite different from reading-and-reacting through the hundreds of in-the-moment calls of an NBA game. Javie was ordained on June 8, 2019, after seven years of study, a more exhaustive process in the Philadelphia archdiocese than many others. Joey Crawford, who considers Javie his best friend, was there. The fellow NBA officiating legend also recalled the deacon\u2019s first crack at a homily. \u201cEverybody was looking around going, \u2018Is this for real?\u2019 I kept telling them, \u2018This is him.\u2019 \u201d said Joey Crawford, a fellow Catholic. \u201cSteve\u2019s one of those guys that commands the room. And he\u2019s always been like that. He walks in, he starts talking, he\u2019s awesome.\u201d Said Delaney: \u201cI always knew him to be a religious guy. He would go to Mass on Sundays and sometimes during the week, especially later in his career. On the road, where you have life conversations, I remember him saying to me, very vividly, \u2018When our time here on Earth is done, we\u2019re not going to be judged by whether we got the block\/charge right.\u2019\u201d It\u2019s one thing, though, to base one\u2019s earthly authority on the dictates of a rulebook. It\u2019s quite another to rely on, yes, a greater book but one that seems to many to offer constant, confounding wiggle room. \u201cThis is not black and white. It is something that does take faith,\u201d Javie said. \u201cThere\u2019s faith and reason both. Plenty of friends I play golf with say, \u2018Well, that\u2019s what you believe.\u2019 I say, \u2018That\u2019s what I believe the Bible is telling us.\u2019 \u201cSee, I can relate to where they\u2019re coming from a lot of times. When I speak to them, I try not to just quote the Rule or quote the scripture reading. As the Lord did when He was walking this Earth, He accepted people where they were. Then you work through it.\u201d Javie specifically was a lapsed Catholic when he met his future wife in his frequent NBA comings and goings at the Philadelphia airport where she worked. Mary-ellen was a devout church-goer, more than the young referee realized when \u2014 for their second date \u2014 he suggested they attend Mass together, followed by brunch. When he muttered something about not getting much out of that morning\u2019s service, she asked him: \u201cWhat did you put into it?\u201d Said Javie: \u201cShe opened my eyes to look at it in a way that I never had before.\u201d He dialed up his church attendance and devotion. He and Mary-ellen, while not blessed with children, started a foundation to put their faith to work for local charities. But he craved more of, well, he wasn\u2019t quite sure. It tugged at him for the next decade, right into the season where he was essentially sidelined by his knee pain.  Admittedly, Javie\u2019s prayer game needed work. He had been doing more talking than listening, and mostly in vague terms. After going to confession one day, though, he was kneeling to say penance when his wife handed him a flyer encouraging folks to \u201cbe specific\u201d in their prayers. So Javie got real specific: He wanted to work one more season, rounding off his NBA career at 25 seasons. \u201cMost of the doctors thought I was done at that time,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it just came about through prayer. Talking to the Lord, saying, \u2018Help me out here, if that\u2019s possible, and after that, I\u2019m yours.\u2019\u201d Javie\u2019s primary orthopedist suggested he rehab his bone-on-bone knee, er, religiously, and suggested that if the NBA would work with him on scheduling \u2013 two days off between games \u2013 he might make it through the 2010-11 season. The league\u2019s priority is to have the top officials available for the playoffs, anyway, so it complied. Javie made it to The Finals, worked Game 1 and again in Game 6, which proved to be the clincher in Dallas\u2019 victory over Miami. \u201cI remember thinking,\u201d Javie recalled, \u201cnear the end of the game with family members there, knowing it would be my last, \u2018I wonder what the Lord has planned for me now.\u2019\u201d It was six months later, in January 2012, as he and Mary-ellen listened in church to Catholic speaker Jeff Cavins , that the word \u201cdeacon\u201d flashed through Javie\u2019s mind. It happened a few more times in the coming days. Javie never had thought about that level of commitment, especially after hearing about the diocese\u2019s seven-year course study. \u201cI thought, \u2018Good luck, brother.\u2019 The whole studying thing and me never got along too well,\u201d said the alumnus of Temple. But he sought out his pastor\u2019s advice anyway, to help him grapple with the powerful impulse. His wariness apparently made his quest seem more genuine. \u201cMy pastor laughed,\u201d Javie said. \u201cHe said, \u2018If you came in here with a Bible under your arm saying you definitely were going to be a deacon, I would have thrown you out of this office. But God works in mysterious ways.\u2019 \u201cThe best advice he gave me was, \u2018Obviously God is calling you to do something. Right now it\u2019s to become a deacon. Let\u2019s just put one foot in front of the other and see where this takes you.\u2019\u201d Seven years later, Javie once more was putting one foot in front of the other, walking down the aisle at Cathedral Basilica of Ss. Peter and Paul. \u201cI\u2019m looking up at the crucifix, and I could see St. Peter and St. Paul on the walls as I\u2019m going to my ordination,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m saying to myself, \u2018Lord, I guess you really mean this.\u2019 \u201cI\u2019d be lying if I told you I didn\u2019t think, \u2018Holy Cow, look where I\u2019m at.\u2019\u201d From 2012 to 2019, Javie \u2014 the oldest of the seven men in his program \u2014 took weekly classes on Wednesday nights, 6:30-9:30 p.m. These were master\u2019s level classes in the history of the Church, philosophy, theology and more. Every other Monday, they would write homilies and preach to the class, with criticism to follow. Once a month, they would work-shop different topics of interest to their community. \u201cSteve and I spoke once every couple weeks about his studies,\u201d Joey Crawford said. \u201cIt interested me. Because he\u2019s one of those guys that, if he\u2019s interested in something, he becomes the best. At golf? Tremendous. Referee? Tremendous. God? Tremendous.\u201d Javie\u2019s humility, certainly in its current form, doesn\u2019t engage that \u201ctremendous\u201d talk. What qualifies for that adjective now is the place he\u2019s at spiritually, a place he\u2019s so actively trying to share. \u201cI know one thing: I want everybody to feel the way I do about my faith,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it wasn\u2019t where someone was forcing it down my throat. I\u2019m not going to force it down anybody else\u2019s throat. I\u2019ll just say, my life \u2014 and I always thought I was happy \u2014 I knew there was something missing. I knew I wasn\u2019t being fulfilled. You\u2019re enjoying what you\u2019re doing, but you\u2019re looking forward to something else. \u201cMy friends at my golf course, we\u2019ve talked more about faith than we ever did. Now that I\u2019m ordained, I\u2019ve almost given them the OK to talk about their faith. It might be good or bad, and a lot of times it is bad, but at least it opens their hearts up to talk about something that\u2019s gnawing at them.\u201d One question possibly is gnawing at NBA fans: Would Javie have been a different referee, had he been ordained as a deacon 20 or 30 years ago? His answer, after a moment\u2019s reflection: Nah. \u201cI have thought about that,\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cHere\u2019s the reason why: I\u2019m obviously competitive. Even when I\u2019m in the Replay Center and referees aren\u2019t doing their jobs in handling players and coaches, or when Jeff Van Gundy is wrong about \u2018This shouldn\u2019t be a technical foul!\u2019 I get so incensed I\u2019m yelling \u2018Put me on! Put me on! I\u2019m gonna talk about this!\u2019 That leads me to believe I wouldn\u2019t be any different. I think I\u2019d call a game exactly as I did before.\u201d Preach, deacon. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Superstar forward Kevin Durant was reportedly among that group of players, but as of two weeks ago he was asymptomatic. Per Newsday  , GM Sean Marks said Wednesday that the team\u2019s entire traveling party completed their 14-day home isolation after the team announced on March 17 that one player was exhibiting symptoms. Additionally, Marks said he hasn\u2019t spoken with coaching candidates as the team parted ways with coach Kenny Atkinson in early March . Per Newsday , Marks said he will take a collaborative approach by speaking with Durant, Kyrie Irving and others while adding the final decision on the new coach will be made by Marks and team management. Durant and Irving are both out for the season. Durant ruled himself out for the season in late October and has yet to play a game for Brooklyn as he recovers from a ruptured Achilles tendon. Irving played in just 20 games before being shut down on Feb. 20 for the rest of 2019-20 with a shoulder injury. Marks said he didn\u2019t know if Durant or Irving would be able to play if the playoffs took place later this summer. \u201cI couldn\u2019t give an answer on when they\u2019ll play this season,\u201d Marks said, per ESPN. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to those athletes nor the performance team to put a timeline on it. I think everyone is dealing with bigger, far more pressing things.\u201d A potential extra couple of months could benefit the injured players. But with all team practice facilities shut, the time it takes to rehab may be lengthened. \u201cI think something we have to think about is our facilities are closed and just by getting time off, yes, does that make your body heal and so forth?\u201d Marks said. \u201cBut there were several of our players that need the facilities, need game reps, need to be playing, and you could take the other side of this and say that this hiatus has set their rehabilitation back and it\u2019s slowed them.\u201d And without the team being able to see them, only the players know for sure where they are. \u201cWe\u2019re talking to them and FaceTiming them and so forth, but it\u2019s quite different to having those guys on the court,\u201d Marks said. \u201cAnd they know their bodies better than anyone else, so at the right time and when they\u2019re a hundred present and they\u2019re up for it, I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be making those decisions.\u201d Brooklyn\u2019s most recent game was March 10 in Los Angeles against the Lakers. After the Nets announced their test results, the Lakers \u2014 who have the NBA\u2019s second-best record this season and two of the game\u2019s biggest stars in LeBron James and Anthony Davis \u2014 indicated that their team will now be tested. The Lakers said Tuesday that their players completed their 14-day home isolation and that all players are currently symptom-free of COVID-19. Boston Celtics guard Marcus Smart took to social media on Monday to declare he has been cleared of the coronavirus. Utah Jazz stars Rudy Gobert and Donovan Mitchell, the first two NBA players to test positive for coronavirus, were cleared of it on March 27 . Detroit Pistons big man Christian Wood \u2014 who matched up against Gobert in Utah\u2019s March 7 road win \u2014 reportedly tested positive for coronavirus as well. Wood also reportedly showed signs of full recovery last week, too. For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from the new virus.

Dr. Ho first worked with the NBA when Hall of Famer Magic Johnson announced that he had been diagnosed with HIV . Today, Dr. Ho spoke with NBA.com\u2019s Brian Martin about the coronavirus pandemic to emphasize best practices for slowing the spread of COVID-19 , clarify common misconceptions about the virus and discuss the work he and his team of researchers at Columbia University are doing to help find an answer to this global threat. * * I wanted to begin by discussing how the virus spreads. Everyone keeps talking about washing your hands. Why is that so important in terms of how the virus is spread? The virus lives mostly in the airway of an infected person, which includes the mouth, nose and all the way down to the lungs. So when a person coughs, sneezes, or even talks with droplets coming out of the mouth, that is potentially infectious. And quite often the droplets will land on surfaces and we now know that the virus can survive on surfaces for hours to days. Therefore if one touches the surface, then brings it to one\u2019s mouth, nose, or eyes, that could then allow the infection to take place. Seldom do you witness someone coughing into someone else\u2019s face. Obviously that is more direct, but we know from many other respiratory viruses that quite often hand hygiene is the most important. Of course, covering up the person who is infected helps, so an infected person wearing a mask will also help decrease the risk of transmission. A lot of people are saying young, healthy people aren\u2019t affected that much, and if we get it, we\u2019ll just feel flu-like symptoms. Is that true or more of a misconception? It is largely true, with one caveat. Let me just say that the death rate, the mortality rate, is much, much higher in people over 65-70 years old; there is no doubt about that. So the elderly and those with cardiac pulmonary conditions generally do worse. If you look at all the cases that are in the ICU with severe [complications], you will see predominantly elderly folks or people with underlying problems. However, there are cases of people who are in their 20s, 30s, 40s and 50s, and we don\u2019t quite understand why a small minority of the younger folks get severely ill. It could be genetics, it could be something else, we don\u2019t know that yet. So one should not say \u2018Well, I\u2019m young, I\u2019m not going to have any problems,\u2019 because you\u2019re rolling the dice. It is true that a large majority of young people will just suffer a cold or flu-like illness and recover and do just fine, but there is a small percentage that will suffer a great deal and possibly die.  What does \u2018community spread\u2019 mean? Before we had cases in the U.S., we were concerned about importing cases, but we\u2019re way past that now. You could say just about 99% of our cases are community spread, that is new cases acquired within our own communities. Another term that we hear a lot is \u2018flatten the curve\u2019 in order to slow the spread of the virus. Can you talk about not only what \u2018flatten the curve\u2019 means, but why it is so important and if you are seeing any indicators about where we currently are on that curve? When you have an epidemic, let\u2019s take influenza or flu, any given season as the winter approaches you\u2019ll see the case number rise, which is typically exponential. As the season continues and enough have caught it, the number generally comes back down as the weather warms up. So you almost get like a bell shaped curve. Here, in this case, we are trying to flatten it, so we\u2019re trying to take that bell shaped curve and push it down so the peak is not so high. So instead of having a few million infections, we want to keep it under that, let\u2019s say hypothetically a hundred thousand cases. When you push the peak down, you avoid the surge in the number of really sick people presenting to hospitals and really overwhelming the hospital system. When you overwhelm the hospital, you have greater mortality because the hospitals cannot provide adequate supportive care. So flattening the curve means pushing that peak down and letting it spread out over a much longer period of time so that the health care system can absorb the caseload. Something that is generally not understood very well is that if you don\u2019t have a solution for this infection through medical science, while you flatten the curve, the curve will continue, meaning that you\u2019ll continue to accumulate cases. So flattening the curve is also buying time for science to deliver potential solutions, treatment and vaccines. You mentioned earlier that the virus could live on surfaces for hours or days. Is it OK to touch things like doorknobs, cell phones and keys? Are there preventative measures that we should be taking? This is teaching us to frequently clean, in particular, things that many people will touch each day \u2014 doorknobs, handrails, elevator buttons and such items where you can have hundreds or thousands of people touching them. They need to be cleaned frequently, but more importantly, each individual should take care, if they have touched those things, to wash their hands, or if there isn\u2019t water and soap convenient, to use the hand sanitizers, so the hands are always kept clean and you\u2019re not going to bring virus to your nose, mouth or eyes and mucosal surfaces. I still have to go to the grocery store from time to time to buy food. Can the virus live on fruit that is handled by others? What about the credit card kiosks? Bag handles? Are there precautions that we should be taking to avoid risk? First, make those runs for essential items as infrequently as you can to minimize exposure. And when you\u2019re there, you just have to be very, very mindful of what you\u2019re touching and then be sure to clean your hands afterwards. I know that many supermarkets, for example, will only allow in a certain number of people at any given time. I think that\u2019s a good practice, and if there is a line outside, the line should be quite spread out so that people are not tightly packed; all of those things will help minimize contact. The probability of infection is a reflection of how many contacts you have and the nature of those contacts, so if you have fewer contacts and you also protect yourself, then you can increase the likelihood of not catching the virus. And with items you bought, if you\u2019re going to cook them, then they\u2019re probably going to be fine because the virus is easily killed by high temperature, and anything that will cook our food will kill the virus. Foods that you eat fresh obviously need to be washed properly. I\u2019ve heard if I have a wet cough or a runny nose, those are signs that I don\u2019t have the virus. Is that true, and is there a way to know the difference between having a cold, a regular flu and having the coronavirus? I think if your symptoms are predominantly a runny nose without a fever, that\u2019s unlikely to be COVID-19 infection because runny nose or sniffles have not been reported as a common feature of the clinical symptoms of COVID-19 infection. We have to bear in mind that people could be asymptomatic. However, [for people] who are symptomatic, fever and dry cough are the most common symptoms, and for some cases, there could be some gastro-intestinal symptoms. You may have heard that a lot of COVID-19 patients complain that they lose their smell and taste, which is something we don\u2019t understand yet. But it is a common complaint by patients. If I\u2019m home and feel sick, what should I do? What should others in my home do? If you\u2019re sick with fever and cough, and at home with your family, you likely should stay home, but away from the rest of your family. Given the current testing situation, the medical system probably would not put you as a high priority for testing, which is tragic and sad, but that\u2019s where we stand. You should monitor yourself, and the major [symptom] to look out for is shortness of breath. If you find yourself having trouble breathing, then you should contact your physician, and if the physician deems the shortness of breath severe enough, then you would need to be seen at the hospital. But short of that, based on current information, approximately 80 percent of infected people will just have milder or no symptoms and recover on their own without ever having to go to the hospital. What should I do if I feel flu-like symptoms but cannot get tested? Should I treat it the way I would the flu with lots of liquids and medicine to keep the fever down? The majority of cases will resolve on their own without any specific treatment, other than taking Tylenol or one of the anti-inflammatory drugs to reduce fever and make oneself more comfortable. And yes, hydrate and rest. That is going to be the case for most cases. If shortness of breath becomes a concern, you should seek additional care. If you get the virus but then become symptom free \u2014 I know a few NBA players have gone through this where they had it and have fully recovered \u2014 can you get it again? I think you are asking a very important question that is not yet fully answered. We know that 17 years ago there was the SARS outbreak, and in that outbreak we could not find any evidence of reinfection, the kind you are talking about, catching it more than once. Now, for [the coronavirus], we still don\u2019t have the answer for that. One experiment has been done in monkeys where they were given the virus; the monkeys got infected; and then after they recovered, the monkeys were given the virus a second time. That second time, the virus did not take. So that may suggest that there is immunity that protects us against reinfection. Another term that has been discussed is \u2018herd immunity\u2019 where if many people get the virus, recover from it and become immune to it, then the virus would not be able to continue to spread. Would \u2018herd immunity\u2019 help, so once we pass this first peak that it wouldn\u2019t peak again? Herd immunity definitely could help. Say you are the one person who has never been exposed, but you are surrounded by 99 others who have immunity and the virus comes in. Unless it hits you directly first, if it hits the other people, the virus would not penetrate into this community. That\u2019s what is meant by herd immunity: you\u2019re protected, even though you yourself do not have immunity, simply because those around you are pretty well protected. Herd immunity works well when a large percentage of the population has immune response to the virus, which would mean probably something north of 50 percent, or 70 to 80 percent, in order to be somewhat protected. But by then, that also means that a large fraction of our U.S. population would be infected already. So while herd immunity is something that could be built up over a long period of time, in the short term, if we build up herd immunity in 75 percent of our population, that\u2019s going to mean over 200 million people are infected this time, and that, of course, would come with terrible consequences. We know that your team at Columbia University is working on strategies to cure and prevent the coronavirus in the future, what can you tell us about your work? We\u2019re trying to do a number of things. First, we\u2019re trying to find drugs that block the replication of COVID-19 and we\u2019re going after two critical sites in the virus. The virus needs some of these important enzymes to replicate and one of them is called protease, which is a chemical scissor that cuts the viral proteins from big chunks to smaller pieces, which can then fit into the virus particle itself. And somehow, if you\u2019re able to use a drug to gum up this chemical scissor, then the virus can no longer cut the proteins, and therefore the progenies that are made by the virus will be dead. And so we can interrupt the replication cycle that way. Another target is what we call polymerase, which is the enzyme the virus uses to replicate its genetic material. So, in this case, it\u2019s RNA to more RNA, and we can find drugs that will inhibit that copying of the genetic information. We picked these targets because both areas have been well worked on in the past for HIV and Hepatitis C drug development, and many, many drugs are already available that block one of those two enzymes for HIV and Hepatitis C. So we\u2019re bringing a lot of knowledge and experience from those areas to coronavirus. That is one principal area that my group is involved with. Another area that I would just put out there is we\u2019re trying to study people who have recovered and have developed a very strong antibody response to the virus. We are trying to fish out the very cells that make the strong antibody response so we can clone those cells and clone the antibody, and produce it in large quantities to be administered as treatment or as prophylactic for patients. Those are some of the principal activities; we\u2019re doing more, but that covers a pretty broad territory in the area of treatment and prevention efforts. Is there any sense of a timeline between the research you\u2019re doing, to something that could be tested and then something that could be implemented? Normally, I would tell you if we are not pressured to move fast, this would be a 5- to 10-year endeavor. But now, because of the urgency of the situation, we are all trying to move at a faster pace to see if we can contract this [timeline] to one to two years. I think if we are really lucky we may have something in a year or year-and-a-half. But I think as a society, we need to prepare that, in all likelihood, some of the scientific solutions that will be brought forward will not arrive until about two years from now. And that is why we need to flatten the curve and keep it under better control, and hopefully science will solve the rest of the problem. As difficult as the situation currently is, we\u2019d like to end on a positive note. What can you tell us or have you observed that we can be hopeful about? Let\u2019s look at what has transpired in China and in South Korea. They both had substantial epidemics and both implemented very harsh measures to either lock down or mitigate the spread of this virus. And China went from a peak of 4,000 new cases per day down to a point where a few days ago [there were] zero new reported cases. South Korea also had a very bad outbreak in part of the country, and then without implementing lockdown, but instead everybody carrying out good practices of social distancing and hygiene and so forth, it too has largely brought the epidemic under control. So I think these two examples tell us it can be done. And there are other places in Asia \u2014 in Taiwan and Singapore \u2014 that have done a fantastic job of keeping the epidemic curve essentially flat. So we know it could be done, but at enormous sacrifice obviously. And it\u2019s important that the practices are carried out by everyone throughout the country. I think we are seeing varying degrees of responses by states in the U.S. We are seeing wave after wave of epidemics; obviously the two coasts got hit first but the center of the country is now beginning to experience the next wave and this will move to rural America as well. The positive news is that [improvement] could be done, but we need to hunker down and put up with it for a good six to eight weeks. That\u2019s what it takes to drive the infection down to a low level and then we can begin to relax and try to return to some semblance of normalcy."},{"id":28083,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/last-dance-chicago-bulls-release-date-moved","date":"2020-03-31","title":"'The Last Dance' documentary set to air April 19 on ESPN","content":"Today it was announced that the premiere of \u201cThe Last Dance,\u201d the highly anticipated 10-part documentary series will air on ESPN in the U.S. on Sunday nights over five weeks from April 19 through May 17. The series will also be available outside of the U.S. on Netflix. The series, directed by Jason Hehir (\u201cThe Fab Five,\u201d \u201cThe \u201985 Bears,\u201d \u201cAndre the Giant\u201d), chronicles one of the greatest icons and most successful teams in sports history, Michael Jordan and the 1990s Chicago Bulls, and features never-before-seen footage from the 1997-98 season as the team pursued its sixth NBA championship in eight years. ESPN statement: \u201cAs society navigates this time without live sports, viewers are still looking to the sports world to escape and enjoy a collective experience. We\u2019ve heard the calls from fans asking us to move up the release date for this series, and we\u2019re happy to announce that we\u2019ve been able to accelerate the production schedule to do just that. This project celebrates one of the greatest players and dynasties ever, and we hope it can serve as a unifying entertainment experience to fill the role that sports often play in our lives, telling a story that will captivate everyone, not just sports fans.\u201d I n the fall of 1997, Michael Jordan, Bulls owner Jerry Reinsdorf and head coach Phil Jackson agreed to let an NBA Entertainment film crew follow the team all season long. The result would be a remarkable portrait of an iconic player and a celebrated team \u2013 a portrait only now being revealed, more than two decades later, in \u201cThe Last Dance.\u201d As the series weaves its way through the tumultuous 1997-98 season, viewers will be transported back to how it all began \u2013 from Jordan\u2019s childhood roots, the Bulls\u2019 dire circumstances before his arrival and how the team was built after drafting him in 1984, to the struggles that eventually led to the team\u2019s first NBA championship. As the series takes the audience through the Bulls\u2019 first five championships, viewers will experience the off-court challenges, struggles and triumphs that were a part of the culture-shifting phenomenon created by Jordan and the Bulls. It\u2019s an unlikely scenario that serves as a fascinating backdrop for the inside tale of the 1998 championship run, with extensive profiles of Jordan\u2019s key teammates including Scottie Pippen, Dennis Rodman and Steve Kerr, head coach Phil Jackson, and featuring dozens of current-day interviews with rivals and luminaries from basketball and beyond. All throughout, the tension and conflict that defined that final championship run are very much on display. \u201cMichael Jordan and the \u201890s Bulls weren\u2019t just sports superstars, they were a global phenomenon,\u201d said director Jason Hehir. \u201cMaking \u2018The Last Dance\u2019 was an incredible opportunity to explore the extraordinary impact of one man and one team. For nearly three years, we searched far and wide to present the definitive story of an era-defining dynasty and to present these sports heroes as humans. I hope viewers enjoy watching our series as much as we enjoyed the opportunity to make it.\u201d The result is one of the most fascinating sports documentary series ever produced \u2013 a series viewers won\u2019t want to miss.

Anyone logging onto Instagram has noticed the recent spike in live streams, many of them featuring star athletes. Golden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry provided the latest, and perhaps most beneficial use of social media by interviewing infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci , who answered several questions about the coronavirus and the approach we should all be taking. Other NBA stars such as LeBron James, Giannis Antetokounmpo and Carmelo Anthony have blessed the fans with insightful basketball stories and discussions to help us all get through this. * * * LeBron James sat down for more than an hour on Thursday for his first-ever Instagram Live video , providing a look on the day to day in his family\u2019s home as it self-quarantines. Fans caught a glimpse of James\u2019 children Bryce and Zhuri dancing, James playing cards with his wife Savannah, in addition to the NBA star joking with eldest son Bronny. James also took the time to answer questions from the fans, and revealed his mindset going into Game 6 of the 2012 Eastern Conference Finals with his Miami Heat behind 3-2 to the Boston Celtics in their best-of-seven series. James feared that Heat president Pat Riley would break up the team, including the vaunted Big Three of himself, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh the next season if Miami failed to deliver a title. \u201cMy mentality was like, if we lose, Pat Riley may break us all up and I don\u2019t want that,\u201d James said. \u201cIt may be the quickest breakup in basketball history. And not only might they break it all up, my legacy going to take a huge, huge hit if I don\u2019t go out here and perform at an all-time high. Win, lose, draw, I had to be focused. I had to be locked in and lead us to victory. I didn\u2019t know if it was going to happen that way, but that was my mindset.\u201d James racked up 45 points that game to go with 15 rebounds and five assists in Miami\u2019s 98-79 win, which forced a Game 7. James and the Heat closed out that series with a 101-88 win over the Celtics to advance to the finals, where he averaged 28.6 points, 10.2 rebounds and 7.4 assists on the way to winning Finals MVP and his first NBA title , as Miami defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder 4-1. * * * We\u2019ve seen the beef brewing between Antetokounmpo and Harden going back to when the reigning MVP joked in February while picking the All-Star teams that he selected Kemba Walker because he \u201cwanted somebody that\u2019s going to pass the ball.\u201d Even after that game in which Team LeBron defeated Team Giannis , Antetokounmpo explained his team\u2019s strategy late was \u201cto find whoever James Harden was guarding. That\u2019s who we thought we had an opportunity to score on.\u201d Harden countered later in an interview with Rachel Nichols when expressing frustration about Antetokounmpo winning the Kia NBA MVP award over him last season: \u201cBut I wish I was 7-feet, and could run and just dunk. Like that takes no skill at all,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cat the end of the day, if that\u2019s what he believes, that\u2019s what he believes.\u201d But Antetokounmpo made it clear he respects Harden , the 2018 MVP. Asked who is the most difficult player in the NBA to guard right now, Antetokounmpo took his time pondering the options, before stating, \u201cI gotta go with James Harden.\u201d Antetokounmpo also ranked his all-time top NBA players on Instagram Live, and interestingly, James was the only active player on the list. Five of Antetokounmpo\u2019s top six players all donned Lakers purple and gold in James, Kobe Bryant, Magic Johnson, Shaquille O\u2019Neal and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Antetokounmpo also mentioned Michael Jordan among his top six. * * * Portland Trail Blazers forward Carmelo Anthony joined Dwyane Wade in an Instagram Live session on Friday. During the discussion, Anthony revealed to fans a story about how close friend LeBron once saved his life after he was nearly pulled out to sea by a rip current in the Bahamas. \u201cRemember, we jumped off the boat in the Bahamas,\u201d Anthony explained to Wade. \u201cEverybody swam to the little grotto underneath. Then we came out. All of y\u2019all went to the boat. It was my fault though because I was trying to see the last little bit of the barracudas snorkeling and all of that. It was my fault. I look up. The current is taking me in[to] the middle of the ocean, opposite from the boat. All types of [expletive] was going through my head. I\u2019m gonna be honest with you. I look up at the boat, and I see \u2018Bron jumps off the boat like he\u2019s MacGyver. He jumped off the boat into the water. He was bringing me back with one arm. He\u2019s swimming with the other arm, and he\u2019s carrying me in one arm.\u201d Both Wade and Anthony then burst into laughter. \u201cI\u2019ve told people this story before,\u201d Wade added. \u201cI say: \u2018Listen, I\u2019ve seen \u2018Bron do a lot of amazing things on the court. Off the court, when he went and saved \u2018Melo\u2019s life.\u2019\u201d \u201cThat was special,\u201d Anthony interjected. \u201cHe saved my life. I can\u2019t hold you. He saved my life. LeBron, I appreciate that. You saved my life that day. Them little flippers wasn\u2019t working for me.\u201d Anthony also mentioned to Wade that he believes his 2009 Nuggets squad could\u2019ve and should\u2019ve won the NBA title, if only they could have defeated the Lakers in the conference finals. Denver finished that season with a 54-28 regular-season record, good for second in the West, with a squad featuring stars such as Anthony, Allen Iverson, Chauncey Billups and Kenyon Martin. Ultimately, the Nuggets would fall 4-2 to the Lakers in the Western Conference finals with Anthony and Bryant going head-to-head. \u201cI was sick because we were supposed to beat them that year. I don\u2019t like saying all that, but when you re-evaluate everything, we really wanted Orlando in The Finals that year,\u201d Anthony told Wade. \u201cWe were like: \u2018If we get Game 1 in L.A. or Game 2, we\u2019re going back to Denver. We\u2019re sweeping them.\u2019 We were going to beat them that year if we would\u2019ve won in L.A. If we would\u2019ve won both games, we would\u2019ve beat them. We would\u2019ve swept Orlando that year.\u201d http:\/\/youtu.be\/b6gpN0Aewnk Atlanta Hawks guard Trae Young hit up Instagram Live with Maria Taylor of ESPN on Mar. 25 to discuss what he\u2019s been doing while in self-quarantine. In the nearly 20-minute video, Young also discussed what it was like to finally play against Houston Rockets guard Russell Westbrook.  Young grew up in Oklahoma as a fan of the Thunder, where Westbrook played his first 11 seasons before joining the Rockets. \u201cGoing up against Russ the first time back in OKC, he dribbled at me in transition, and then just turned around and started backing me down in the post. He did something. I was like, \u2018O.K., alright. Now it\u2019s my turn. We\u2019ve got to go back at it.\u2019 It was fun. That was probably my welcome to the NBA moment though.\u201d  Plenty of players on social media are discussing James. Irving was no different in talking about his former Cleveland Cavaliers teammate. The first pick in the 2011 NBA Draft after James left Cleveland to join the Miami Heat, Irving took to Instagram Live on Friday, where he was interviewed by friend and former high school teammate Jeremiah Green. According to Irving, he connected with James during the 2011 NBA Finals when Dallas defeated the Heat 4-2 in the series. \u201cI was actually doing a little mini internship before I got drafted,\u201d Irving explained. \u201cI had met \u2018Bron around that time, as well as in high school (at James\u2019 basketball camp). So, we had a close relationship then, and it was strictly about transferring knowledge. You know, like what does this level look like for you? And I saw it up close. I got a chance to see it up close, and it inspired me. Obviously, Miami lost that year. Dallas won on a really, really miraculous playoff run. \u2018Bron played well. D-Wade played well. It was just very challenging, and I learned a lot from that. Then they went on to win back-to-back championships after that. And you come into the league during that time, and they\u2019re just dominating everything. Then, you get a chance to play with \u2018Bron on that same team? At that level? You better believe if that shot comes to me, I\u2019m going to be ready to take it.\u201d Irving would make good on those words in Game 7 of the 2016 NBA Finals by hitting the game winner to deliver Cleveland a championship. Irving also discussed his first experience of trying to size up Kobe Bryant. \u201cThis is your time,\u201d Irving said. \u201cSo, I get at the top of the key and I make a move, he stutters a little bit, and I spin. When I spun, this dude was waiting for that.\u201d  As Young jammed to music on his Instagram live feed last Saturday night, a familiar opponent hopped in the comments. It was Luka Doncic, who was laughing at Young\u2019s singing and dancing. The two 21-year-old stars have been linked following their Draft night trade in 2018. \u201cNext time I\u2019m in Dallas bro, we got to get some wine, chill and talk about our trade together,\u201d Young said. \u201cYou the brodie, bro. People want us to hate each other, we can\u2019t.\u201d Shortly afterwards, Damian Lillard interjected in the comments and asked Young to change the music he was playing to himself, better known as Dame D.O.L.L.A. \u201cMan better spin that D.o.l.l.a \u2026 luka stop playing lol,\u201d Lillard wrote. Young obliged and later committed to doing a joint live stream with Doncic one day soon. * * * Michael C. Wright is a senior writer for NBA.com.

Tokyo organizers said Monday the opening ceremony will take place on July 23, 2021 \u2014 almost exactly one year after the games were due to start this year. \u201cThe schedule for the games is key to preparing for the games,\u201d Tokyo organizing committee president Yoshiro Mori said. \u201cThis will only accelerate our progress.\u201d Last week, the IOC and Japanese organizers postponed the Olympics until 2021 because of the coronavirus pandemic. This year\u2019s games were scheduled to open on July 24 and close on Aug. 9. But the near exact one-year delay will see the rescheduled closing ceremony on Aug. 8. There had been talk of switching the Olympics to spring, a move that would coincide with the blooming of Japan\u2019s famous cherry blossoms. But it would also clash with European soccer and North American sports leagues. Mori said a spring Olympics was considered but holding the games later gives more space to complete the many qualifying events that have been postponed by the virus outbreak. \u201cWe wanted to have more room for the athletes to qualify,\u201d Mori said. After holding out for weeks, local organizers and the IOC last week postponed the Tokyo Games under pressure from athletes, national Olympic bodies and sports federations. It\u2019s the first postponement in Olympic history, though there were several cancellations during wartime. The Paralympics were rescheduled to Aug. 24-Sept. 5. The new Olympic dates would conflict with the scheduled world championships in track and swimming, but those events are now expected to also be pushed back. \u201cThe IOC has had close discussions with the relevant international federations,\u201d organizing committee CEO Toshiro Muto said. \u201cI believe the IFs have accepted the games being held in the summer.\u201d Muto said the decision was made Monday and the IOC said it was supported by all the international sports federations and was based on three main considerations: to protect the health of athletes, to safeguard the interests of the athletes and Olympic sport, and the international sports calendar. \u201cThese new dates give the health authorities and all involved in the organisation of the Games the maximum time to deal with the constantly changing landscape and the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic,\u201d the IOC said. \u201cThe new dates \u2026 also have the added benefit that any disruption that the postponement will cause to the international sports calendar can be kept to a minimum, in the interests of the athletes and the IFs.\u201d Both Mori and Muto have said the cost of rescheduling the Olympics will be \u201cmassive\u201d \u2014 local reports estimate billions of dollars \u2014 with most of the expenses borne by Japanese taxpayers. Muto promised transparency in calculating the costs, and testing times deciding how they are divided up. \u201cSince it (the Olympics) were scheduled for this summer, all the venues had given up hosting any other events during this time, so how do we approach that?\u201d Muto asked. \u201cIn addition, there will need to be guarantees when we book the new dates, and there is a possibility this will incur rent payments. So there will be costs incurred and we will need to consider them one by one. I think that will be the tougher process.\u201d Katsuhiro Miyamoto, an emeritus professor of sports economics at Kansai University, puts the costs as high as $4 billion. That would cover the price of maintaining stadiums, refitting them, paying rentals, penalties and other expenses. Japan is officially spending $12.6 billion to organize the Olympics. However, an audit bureau of the Japanese government says the costs are twice that much. All of the spending is public money except $5.6 billion from a privately funded operating budget. The Switzerland-based International Olympic Committee is contributing $1.3 billion, according to organizing committee documents. The IOC\u2019s contribution goes into the operating budget. IOC President Thomas Bach has repeatedly called the Tokyo Olympics the best prepared in history. However, Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso also termed them \u201ccursed.\u201d Aso competed in shooting in the 1976 Olympics, and was born in 1940. The Olympics planned for 1940 in Tokyo were canceled because of Japan\u2019s war with China. The run-up to the Olympics also saw IOC member Tsunekazu Takeda, who also headed the Japanese Olympic Committee, forced to resign last year amid a bribery scandal."},{"id":28052,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/marcus-smart-cleared-coronavirus","date":"2020-03-30","title":"Marcus Smart says he has been cleared of coronavirus","content":" Boston Celtics guard Marcus Smart has been cleared of the coronavirus, he announced Sunday on Twitter.

It is part of the new status quo for coaches and players across the NBA since the coronavirus pandemic sparked a rolling shutdown of professional sports across the globe. The league suspended its season March 11 after Utah Jazz All-Star Rudy Gobert became its first player to test positive for the COVID-19 strain. It has left the 42-year-old coach, like everyone else, searching for ways to adjust to a new reality and daily routine. The new coronavirus has caused a global pandemic that has sickened at least 597,000 and killed more than 27,000 worldwide, crippled economies and forced restrictions on the movement of millions of people in an effort to stop the virus from spreading further and overwhelming health care systems. The NBA has lost 100 games so far with no clear timeline for when the season might resume \u2014 if at all. Stevens said he\u2019s passing the time the same way many are across the country. \u201cI try and do everything that we\u2019re asked to do,\u201d he said. \u201cWe get out and we go for walks. \u2026 But, my thoughts are with everybody who\u2019s really facing this thing. And, it\u2019s just that you feel so bad.\u201d Stevens spends his days trying to stay connected to both his family and Celtics\u2019 family the best he can. He and his wife, Tracy, put together a PowerPoint presentation for his 14-year-old son and 10-year-old daughter to help explain the scope of the pandemic both in New England and worldwide. He\u2019s also been hopping on video conference calls with his players and coaching staff, though he said they\u2019ve been light on basketball and heavy on just making sure everyone is staying safe. \u201cWe\u2019re like the rest of the world, you know that basketball is taking a far back seat,\u201d he said. Celtics guard Marcus Smart divulged he\u2019d been diagnosed with COVID-19 on March 19. Boston played the Utah Jazz on March 6. Stevens said the day Gobert\u2019s positive test became public \u201cwill be something that I think we all remember.\u201d As a precaution, Celtics players and staff were also tested, but those tests all came back negative. Stevens said Smart is also doing well. \u201cObviously the days following that we enter this kind of new world,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cWe\u2019re calling sitting at home an inconvenience. What a joke like this is. There\u2019s so many people that are working so hard every day to try to help our communities and help the secure putting their own selves at risk. And, I think any time you turn on the TV, it hits home more.\u201d While Stevens doesn\u2019t think it would be appropriate right now \u201cto be hammering basketball\u201d with his players, they are getting some work done during their downtime. All of the players have received exercise bikes and a personal set of weights they can use to do voluntary home workouts. Stevens is also getting some of the postseason film study he normally wouldn\u2019t complete until after the season done now. \u201cIt helps us dial in to what we need to do should we be able to resume playing and what we need to focus on when we get back to practice,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be a unique situation to be off for as long as we\u2019re gonna be off to have the re-acclimate and recondition. But you do already have a system in with those 15 guys.\u201d For now, Stevens said he\u2019s just concentrating on keeping busy rather than trying to predict when he might be able to dive back into basketball full-time. \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot to determine,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think you can\u2019t determine any of that until you have a timeline. And it\u2019s just almost impossible to get a timeline right now.\u201d"}]
