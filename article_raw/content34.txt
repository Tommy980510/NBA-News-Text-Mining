After trailing by as much as 12 late in the third, Toronto came back strong, establishing as much as a 17-point lead midway through the fourth quarter. Strong three-point shooting helped bolster the Toronto\u2019s offense, as the Raptors went 12-of-28 from beyond the arc.

The final score was in no way indicative of how the game started, as the Pacers (1-3) doubled up the overmatched Hawks (2-2) by a 32-16 margin in the first quarter. Although Atlanta was much more competitive in the second, they still headed to the halftime locker room facing a 62-40 deficit. The Hawks chipped another nine points off the Pacers\u2019 lead during the third quarter, setting up a final period where they avenged the lopsided start to the contest. Atlanta would trounce Indiana, 35-16, to close out the comeback win. There were only four lead changes overall, with the Hawks playing catchup the majority of the game. Atlanta won the rebounding battle, 45-38, and ended up draining 54.8 percent of their 73 attempts, including 39.3 percent of their 28 tries from distance. Dorsey added eight rebounds, five assists, two steals and one block to his team-leading 24 points. Young, meanwhile, supplied 23 points, eight assists and two steals.

Detroit took a commanding lead after the first half, 36-17, which included limiting Minnesota to just six points in the second quarter. However, using a plus-eight offensive rebounding advantage, the Wolves were able to gain extra possessions and keep the game close. The third quarter went to Minnesota, 26-11, but the team couldn\u2019t seal the game, losing the final period 17-16.

(AP) \u2014 Rob Pelinka says the Los Angeles Lakers aren\u2019t trying to beat the Golden State Warriors at their own game. Instead, they\u2019re building a team around LeBron James to do something different. Pelinka spoke publicly Wednesday for the first time since the Lakers\u2019 remarkable offseason overhaul began, and the irrepressibly optimistic former agent radiated excitement about the future for a team that hasn\u2019t made the playoffs in five seasons. \u201cTo get the commitment from LeBron James to come to the Lakers for four years was really the culmination of everything we\u2019ve been working towards,\u201d Pelinka said. \u201cWhen LeBron chose to come here, it was the ultimate validation for the moves we\u2019ve made and what we\u2019ve been building since we started.\u201d The longest postseason drought in franchise history could be finished after James chose the Lakers in free agency . The club also added veterans Rajon Rondo, JaVale McGee and Lance Stephenson alongside their young core while parting ways with Julius Randle and Brook Lopez, among others. Pelinka and top executive Magic Johnson hope the result is a sturdy, defense-minded team with enough up-tempo offense to trouble the Warriors, the Houston Rockets and every other contender for the title. \u201cI think to try to play the Warriors at their own game is a trap,\u201d Pelinka said. \u201cNo one is going to beat them at their own game, so that is why we wanted to add these elements of defense and toughness and depth and try to look at areas where we will have an advantage.\u201d Pelinka said the Lakers focused their free agency recruitment efforts on versatile, playoff-tested talents who can score and defend, instead of looking for elite players with only one specialty. He hopes the result will be a flexible, dangerous team under coach Luke Walton \u2014 and a different look around James, whose Cleveland Cavaliers teams often looked like a collection of perimeter shooters whose deficiencies were exposed by Golden State and others. Pelinka praised Rondo as a gritty guard whose championship pedigree will fill a void on the roster. He also described Stephenson as providing \u201can extreme toughness and an edge,\u201d comparing his skills to Dennis Rodman\u2019s contributions to Michael Jordan\u2019s Chicago Bulls, or Metta World Peace\u2019s work with Kobe Bryant\u2019s late-career Lakers. \u201cThe road to the NBA championship has to go through the team that won last year, and we all know the guys up north have a special group,\u201d Pelinka said. \u201cBut one of the ways to attack what they have is with defensive toughness. I think we saw that in the Houston series with some of the players that Houston has.\u201d Pelinka\u2019s desire for flexibility extended to the payroll as well. After years of trading away draft picks and acquiring high-priced veterans in an effort to win now with Bryant, the Lakers were overextended until Pelinka and Johnson spent the past 16 months creating enough salary cap space to sign two elite free agents. They only got one, although the Lakers still appear to be in contention for disgruntled San Antonio star Kawhi Leonard, who has a year left on his contract with the Spurs. No matter what happens, Pelinka said the Lakers\u2019 series of one-year contracts around James will put them in position to have ample cap space again next summer, when several stars could be available to join James. Pelinka said the Lakers will have \u201can open training camp\u201d in September, with only James guaranteed to be a starter. That means Rondo and second-year pro Lonzo Ball will compete to be Los Angeles\u2019 starting point guard, a possibility that was welcomed by Rondo after he signed. Pelinka also said Ball will be fully healthy for training camp. The point guard has a torn meniscus in his left knee. Pelinka\u2019s idiosyncrasies shone through again Wednesday, with the GM beginning his news conference by reading a passage from Brazilian author Paulo Coelho\u2019s \u201cThe Alchemist,\u201d a book recommended to him by former client Bryant and carried by James throughout the playoffs. The passage describes the process of making a decision being \u201conly the beginning of things.\u201d \u201cHopefully it will lead to things \u2026 happening that are bigger than our dreams could ever imagine,\u201d Pelinka said."},{"id":39400,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/moritz-wagner-lakers-out-knee-contusion-update-release","date":"2018-07-12","title":"Los Angeles Lakers' Moritz Wagner (knee contusion) to miss rest of Summer League","content":"EL SEGUNDO, Calif. \u2014 Lakers center Moritz Wagner, who was injured in the second quarter of Tuesday night\u2019s summer league game against the New York Knicks, underwent an MRI on Wednesday.

The key stretch was a 19-3 run spanning between the third and fourth quarters, as that gave the Cavaliers a game-high 20-point lead with only seven minutes remaining. The Kings simply couldn\u2019t recover from that and they never got the game within a single-digit margin from there. The shooting disparity was the difference in the game, with Cleveland connecting on 46.5 percent from the field, 34.8 percent from three-point range and 82.6 percent from the free-throw line.

A flip of the card, pull of the switch or roll of the dice can make or break souls. Which brings us to NBA Summer League , the Golden State Warriors and the field. The league is holding its annual gathering of executives, coaches and player hopefuls here, and 29 of the 30 NBA teams are wondering about their chances this upcoming season and why the Warriors are the Chosen Ones. Meanwhile, the Warriors, winners of three of the last four championships, are no doubt doing some head-scratching about how a key injury is once again helping their cause and making them stronger. This is about luck, then, and why those chasing the Warriors can\u2019t seem to get a break, and how the Warriors managed to make themselves both good and lucky. There is considerable buzz among the basketball throng in Vegas regarding the Warriors, who are less than a month removed from a convincing sweep of LeBron James and the Cavaliers in the NBA Finals and how they won twice this summer: championship and then free agency. The collective moan from the rest of the NBA seems to say: What the hell? DeMarcus Cousins agreed to a one-year deal with the Warriors for the NBA equivalent of loose change in a sofa: $5.3 million. Just like that, the Warriors added a dominant and versatile center, maybe the best in the game, which made coach Steve Kerr wisecrack about how the Warriors \u201cneeded another All-Star.\u201d This was made possible because of a quirky circumstance that caused Cousins a lot of pain, which translated into plenty of gain for Golden State. When Cousins tore his Achilles last spring with the Pelicans, his market value in free agency fell to the floor right along with him. Suddenly, the rest of the league, including the Pelicans, became wary about investing heavily in a hulking center who most certainly would need most of the 2018-19 season to rehab, without any guarantee Cousins would return to form once medically cleared to play. Cousins averaged 25.2 points , 12.9 rebounds, 5.4 assists and 1.6 blocks last season, perhaps the best of his career. He turns 28 in late August. Had he avoided injury, he would\u2019ve been far too expensive for the Warriors to afford. They\u2019re well over the luxury tax and are limited to exceptions, which allow them to sign players but only on the cheap. A healthy Cousins was destined to command in excess of $20 million a season, more had he stayed with the Pelicans. \u201cIf he\u2019s healthy, he\u2019s the best player at his position in the league,\u201d said Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry. Well, when free agency opened, Cousins\u2019 phone didn\u2019t ring, and you probably know the story by now: He personally called the Warriors and signed up on the spot. His reasoning: If my only choice in this league is a short-term deal, might as well be with the team in the midst of a dynasty. The Warriors understandably were shocked, but why would they be? This isn\u2019t the first time an injury went their way. Steph Curry\u2019s chronic ankle sprains once threatened his career. He underwent surgery in the summer of 2011 and played only 26 games the next season. At that time, Curry was a good player, but far from the superstar who\u2019d win a pair of MVPs and destroy 3-point shooting records. So the Warriors were understandably worried, especially once Curry was due a contract extension. The two sides made a compromise that protected both parties: Four years, $44 million. The risk the Warriors took is Curry would continue having ankle issues and never see a full season. Curry\u2019s risk: He\u2019d remain healthy and see his production swell and spend most of that contract as a bargain. A bargain, for sure: At the end of that deal, Curry was the fourth-highest-paid player. On his own team. The upside for the Warriors and Curry: That contract helped them extend Draymond Green, Klay Thompson and Andre Iguodala and more importantly, add Kevin Durant. When you\u2019re good and lucky \u2014 remember, the Warriors won their first title over the Cavs when Cleveland was largely without Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love, and beat the Rockets last spring after Chris Paul suffered a series-ending hamstring injury \u2014 then you get plenty of rings. The beauty of the Cousins situation is the Warriors don\u2019t need him during the regular season. This was mentioned more than a few times by rival general managers and coaches in Vegas. Cousins\u2019 rehab is expected to require another five or six months \u2014 full recovery form Achilles surgery is usually a year \u2014 yet there\u2019s no rush. Golden State won 73 games a few years ago without him and won 58 games last season on cruise control. They can wait until next spring, where Cousins could return, say, in March and use the final few weeks as a warm-up for the playoffs. After using the likes of the plodding Zaza Pachulia and quirky JaVale McGee in the middle, the Warriors are legit at center. Cousins fits the Warriors\u2019 style because he can shoot 3s and is a willing and efficient passer from the high and low post. \u201cThat\u2019s really an area where they\u2019ve struggled and been inconsistent,\u201d said Gentry, a former Warriors assistant coach before taking the top job in New Orleans. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a position where they make an upgrade.\u201d Meanwhile, Houston lost Trevor Ariza and Luc Mbah a Moute , a pair of athletic swingmen, this summer from free agency and therefore aren\u2019t a better team on paper than last season, although the Rockets might soon add Carmelo Anthony , for whatever that\u2019s worth. The Lakers welcome LeBron, but they didn\u2019t get Paul George, who stayed in Oklahoma City, and the idea of trading for Kawhi Leonard this season remains a fantasy, at least for now. Which means the Warriors are once again the odds on favorites across town in the Vegas casinos to sip champagne next June. \u201cHey, that\u2019s the NBA,\u201d said Gentry with a shrug. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be that way. You\u2019re supposed to put out the best team you can. It\u2019s up to the rest of us to catch them. They\u2019ve put together a great team, drafted great, and guys in free agency wanted to come there. That\u2019s what it\u2019s all about. We have to pick up our game, it\u2019s not that they should say, \u2018Oh we\u2019re too good, let\u2019s give away players.\u2019 We all have to find a way to catch them, not them coming back to us.\u201d Damian Lillard, the star guard for the Trail Blazers, spoke for the field when he said: \u201cIt\u2019s just going to get tougher and tougher. It is what it\u2019s always been, but just a little tougher. But you know what? Once the season starts, we gotta go. Nobody\u2019s got time to be out there, not having fun and being stressed and all that BS. We gotta find to make it happen.\u201d Twenty-nine teams, and especially the contenders in the West, are at a disadvantage regarding the Warriors because of a lack of All-Stars; not only do the Warriors now have five, but they\u2019re all in their prime years. It\u2019s one thing to try to be as good as the Warriors. Nowadays, you must rise to their level of luck as well. * * * Veteran NBA writer Shaun Powell has worked for newspapers and other publications for more than 25 years.

Next, backlash to the backlash. By Tuesday, much of the whipsawing over competitive balance \u2014 or more accurately, imbalance \u2014 as an NBA problem rising to the level of crisis had calmed down. Yet powerful voices from the league\u2019s summer nerve center could not dismiss it entirely as an issue meriting closer inspection. \u201cI\u2019m not here to say we have a problem,\u201d NBA commissioner Adam Silver said Tuesday after the Board of Governors meeting. \u201cAnd I love where the league is right now. [But] I think we can create a better system.\u201d Neither Silver nor Michele Roberts, the executive director of the National Basketball Players Association, sounded an alarm in their separate news conferences about what many see as a widening gap between the league\u2019s haves and have-nots. Roberts, in fact, seemed to feel that all is well and that talent inequality is in the eye of the beholder. \u201cCompetitive balance, it almost depends on what your favorite team is,\u201d said Roberts, who was rehired as head of the players union in another four-year contract announced Tuesday. \u201cI don\u2019t hear anybody in the Bay Area worrying about competitive balance. I also don\u2019t hear the people in Philadelphia worrying about competitive balance, or Houston. \u201cWe\u2019ve got great teams. And it\u2019s never been the case, as far as I\u2019m concerned, where I was not able most of the time to predict what teams were going to be in the Finals.\u201d  The topic came up in precisely that context before the Finals last month when Silver was asked about Golden State and Cleveland meeting in the championship series for the fourth consecutive year, a first in any of the major professional sports leagues. It reared its head again this month soon after free agency opened on July 1, with events conspiring to make insiders wonder about a growing disparity among teams. LeBron James\u2019 signing with the Los Angeles Lakers was the biggest move in what appeared to be a continuing shift of strength into the league\u2019s Western Conference. That was followed by the news that DeMarcus Cousins, New Orleans\u2019 All-Star center, had joined the champion Warriors. That signing sparked the initial backlash, a rich-getting-richer cry that pointed not to Cousins\u2019 one-year deal for $5.3 million in 2018-19 salary but the fact that the Warriors will spend in excess of $20 million for it when luxury taxes are counted. Golden State had the NBA\u2019s fattest payroll in 2017-18 of $137.5 million, despite a $99 million salary cap, thanks to various exceptions in the prevailing \u201csoft cap\u201d system. \u201cI don\u2019t necessarily think it\u2019s per se bad that the Warriors are so dominant,\u201d Silver told reporters, not long after discussing the \u201ccompetitive landscape\u201d with the owners. \u201cAs I\u2019ve said before, we\u2019re not trying to create some sort of forced parity. What we really focus on is parity of opportunity. And a fair point could be made in the tax system, when certain teams are spending significantly more than others, that that\u2019s not parity of opportunity.\u201d The counter-backlash came from folks who rushed to the Warriors\u2019 and Cousins\u2019 defense, correctly noting that neither did anything wrong, conducting their business within the rules as specified by the collective bargaining agreement between the owners and the players.  That CBA is the object of endless study and imagined revision, with amendments possible if negotiated prior to the end of the current deal after the 2023-24 season. Shooting for a \u201chard cap\u201d likely would be a tough sell to players accustomed to the freedom of movement they currently enjoy. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily [Roberts\u2019] issue,\u201d Silver said in response to the union director\u2019s characterization. \u201cI think it\u2019s on me and our Labor Relations Committee, ultimately, to sit with the players and their committee and convince them that there may be a better way of doing things.\u201d Silver mentioned Charlotte owner and legendary NBA superstar Michael Jordan, chairman of that Labor Relations Committee, as a valuable resource in addressing owners\u2019 and players\u2019 competition concerns. Both sides have valid arguments. Interest in the NBA never has been higher by almost any metric chosen, from selected TV ratings and licensing revenues to the game\u2019s growth globally. Attendance at the MGM Resorts Las Vegas Summer League keeps pushing higher, with fans eager to see top rookies, second-year players and relative free-agent unknowns chasing their pro hoops\u2019 dreams. The valuations of the 30 NBA franchises, of course, all have soared beyond $1 billion, according to Forbes.com, with the Knicks, the Lakers and the Warriors all estimated to be worth more than $3 billion. Longtime NBA observers such as TNT\u2019s David Aldridge wrote a column this week that argued on behalf of dominant teams, anyway, saying that they actually drive rather than depress fan interest. As for any inability to win games or titles, he laid the blame for that on poor franchise management. The Knicks and the Clippers have all sorts of big-market advantages but haven\u2019t won any championships lately (or at all in the Clippers\u2019 case). For Roberts, whose players reap 51 percent of NBA basketball-related income that tops $7 billion annually, business is good, period. \u201cI\u2019m excited about this new season,\u201d she said Tuesday. \u201cThis free agency, there\u2019s been a lot to write about so we\u2019re all, I think, looking forward to what\u2019s going to happen come October. \u201cTo the extent that people are predicting the end of the game, I just don\u2019t think so. I would be surprised if Adam called me to say, \u2018What the hell are we going to do?\u2019 I think he\u2019s as happy as I am. \u2026 I think we\u2019re in good shape.\u201d Critics note Golden State\u2019s on-court dominance in winning the last two championships. It only took nine NBA Finals games \u2013one over the minimum \u2014 while facing arguably the league\u2019s best player in LeBron James. But those same critics seem to foget that the Warriors were pushed to the full seven games in the conference finals, and actually faced elimination twice before beating the Rockets. \u201cI recognize what Michele\u2019s saying,\u201d Silver said. \u201cBut at the same time, if you talk to players in the league, and I\u2019ve talked to plenty of individual players as well, they want to be in the most competitive league possible too.\u201d For every player on the Warriors\u2019 roster \u2014 or the Rockets, the Thunder, the Celtics or the Sixers \u2014 there are five or six on teams that realistically have no chance of chasing a ring or the Larry O\u2019Brien Trophy. Cleveland went to four straight Finals thanks to James; no one envisions the Cavaliers getting back any time soon. \u201cMaybe there are some players who think they\u2019re on a second-class team,\u201d said Sacramento wing Garrett Temple, one of the NBPA vice presidents. \u201cBut most players I\u2019ve played with or been around, their thought process is, \u2018We\u2019re gonna get our team to become one of those first-class teams.\u2019 It\u2019s more of a challenge. More so than, \u2018We need them to disband so we can make everybody equal.\u2019 Because we\u2019re competitors.\u201d That really is the crux of the issue. Silver and some franchises want most of the competition to come on the floor, in games, in full view of fans who believe their teams can sufficiently compete. The league\u2019s current title contenders are fine with a system that allows them to compete all the way to the top, with an owner stroking gargantuan checks to crowd out rivals. \u201cLet me make clear that under the current system we want teams to compete like crazy,\u201d Silver said. \u201cSo I think the Warriors within the framework of this deal should be doing everything they can to increase their dominance. That\u2019s what you want to see in a league. \u201cYou want teams to compete in every way they can within the rules.\u201d Silver addressed a variety of topics that were came from the BOG agenda, including: \u2014 Change is coming on multiple fronts, most notably in the league\u2019s age limit. That seems likely to be re-set back to 18 years old from 19, permitting players to enter the league from high school. It\u2019s a move that the NBA should be better equipped to handle with a near 30-for-30 farm-system affiliation with its G League. It also fits with the findings of an NCAA task force that cites dissatisfaction with \u201cone-and-done\u201d college players. Said Silver: \u201cMy personal view is that we\u2019re ready to make that change.\u201d \u2014 The start of free agency, annually triggered at midnight ET on July 1, will be moved to a daytime or prime time opening bell. It\u2019s one of those traditions that no one thought to change, Silver said. \u2014 The league\u2019s investigation into the Dallas Mavericks\u2019 sexual harassment issues should be completed by the end of the month.

Some are easy. Others, not so much. Speaking after the NBA\u2019s Board of Governors meeting on Tuesday night, Silver said he thinks the league is ready to scrap the rule requiring players to be out of high school for a year before becoming eligible to enter the draft. That one should be relatively simple to move forward now, while notions such as how to find more competitive balance are still a puzzler to the league and its commissioner. \u201cI\u2019m not here to say we have a problem,\u201d Silver said. \u201cAnd I love where the league is right now. But I think we can create a better system.\u201d Part of that better system, he thinks, will be reverting back to the policy that will allow players to go into the league right out of high school \u2014 something that should be in place in time for the 2021 NBA Draft, though that timeline has not been formally announced. Silver was a proponent of making the eligibility age older, up to 20 instead of the current 19, though has changed his stance on that in recent weeks. \u201cMy personal view is that we\u2019re ready to make that change,\u201d Silver said. \u201cIt won\u2019t come immediately. But when I\u2019ve weighed the pros and cons, given that Condoleezza Rice and her commission have recommended to the NBA that those one-and-done players now come directly into the league and in essence the college community is saying `We do not want those players anymore,\u2019 I think that tips the scale in my mind.\u201d Michele Roberts, the National Basketball Players Association\u2019s newly re-elected executive director \u2014 the players\u2019 union announced a new four-year deal for her earlier Tuesday \u2014 has had talks with Silver on the topic, though she stopped short of revealing specifics. Any change to the rule would require that the league\u2019s Collective Bargaining Agreement be amended. \u201cStay tuned,\u201d Roberts said, adding, \u201cI suspect that we\u2019ll have some news in the next few months.\u201d Now that Silver is on board, that switch should be painless. So, too, will be a relatively minor tweak to free agency rules, that being a likely change to what has been the traditional 12:01 a.m. EDT start time on July 1. Silver said he\u2019s no fan of the all-night news cycle that has accompanied the official start of free agency, and without divulging what will happen he made clear that it\u2019ll be different for 2019. But creating parity, that one isn\u2019t going to be simple. Golden State has won three of the last four NBA championships, and this summer saw the Warriors land DeMarcus Cousins for a $5.3 million \u2013 a mere pittance by NBA standards for an All-Star, even one recovering from an Achilles\u2019 tear. LeBron James left Cleveland for the Los Angeles Lakers, which will likely make the loaded Western Conference even more competitive. Making the playoffs out West will probably be much tougher than getting there out of the East. \u201cIt\u2019s on me and our labor relations committee ultimately to sit with the players and their committee and convince them that there may be a better way of doing things,\u201d Silver said. \u201cBy that, meaning change ultimately in the Collective Bargaining Agreement. \u2026 I don\u2019t necessarily think it\u2019s, per se, bad that the Warriors are so dominant. We\u2019re not trying to create some sort of forced parity. What we\u2019re really focused on is parity of opportunity.\u201d Roberts said she sees no shortage of good teams in the league. \u201cCompetitive balance, it kind of almost depends upon what your favorite team is,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cI don\u2019t hear anyone in the Bay Area worrying about competitive balance. I also don\u2019t hear people in Philadelphia worrying about competitive balance, or Houston. We\u2019ve got great teams. It\u2019s never been the case that I was not able, most of the time, be able to predict who was going to be in the finals.\u201d Among other matters Silver addressed Tuesday: \u2014 The governors were briefed on the ongoing talks the league is having with the gaming industry, with sports betting now able to be offered by each state following a ruling in May by the U.S. Supreme Court. \u2014 Silver called it \u201cembarrassing\u201d that the league currently has only one female referee, and said he\u2019s hopeful that will be changed before long. There are 19 female referees at summer league in Las Vegas this month. \u2014 The investigation into allegations of workplace misconduct against the Dallas Mavericks should be completed by the end of July, Silver said."},{"id":39442,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/lakers-knicks-vegas-summer-league-recap","date":"2018-07-11","title":"Game Recap: Lakers 109, Knicks 92","content":"By Joel Bartilotta, RotoWire LAS VEGAS \u2014 The Los Angeles Lakers defeated the New York Knicks 109-92 in the Las Vegas Summer League at Cox Pavilion on Tuesday.

In fact, Los Angeles blew a 25-point second half lead at one point, as New York ended the third quarter on a 28-3 run to tie the game. The Knicks were able to grab their largest lead of three points to start the fourth quarter, but the Lakers responded with 16 unanswered to re-take control and cruise to victory.

However, Sacramento came out of the halftime locker room dominating on both ends of the floor, which allowed them to stretch their lead to 18 points entering the final period. The Grizzlies (1-2) were able to put together their best offensive quarter in the fourth by scoring 29 points, but they\u2019d only made a five-point dent in their deficit by game\u2019s end. The contest featured 11 ties and eight lead changes, but the Grizzlies\u2019 last advantage came in the latter stages of the second quarter.

(AP)  Lance Stephenson always felt his famed rivalry with LeBron James was rooted in mutual respect. When James called Stephenson last week to pitch him on teaming up with the Los Angeles Lakers, Stephenson\u2019s feelings were confirmed \u2013 and he quickly accepted the invitation. The Lakers formally announced the signings of Stephenson, center JaVale McGee and second-round draft pick Svi Mykhailiuk on Tuesday. Coming off a productive season in his latest stint with the Indiana Pacers, Stephenson agreed to a one-year, $4.5 million deal to join James, McGee and Rajon Rondo in the Lakers\u2019 influx of veteran talent. Stephenson has been one of James\u2019 most famed antagonists during their careers, and even Stephenson is surprised they\u2019ve become teammates. But it only took a phone call from LeBron to persuade Stephenson to join the Lakers. \u201cI was actually surprised he made the move to LA,\u201d Stephenson said. \u201cI guess he needed a new look, and I just feel like him reaching out and showing he likes what I bring to the game, it\u2019s amazing. I\u2019m just happy to be on a team that wants to win.\u201d Stephenson and James competed fiercely in the Eastern Conference over the years, with Stephenson applying tough defense and creative tactics to the four-time NBA Most Valuable Player. Stephenson created multiple memes during the 2014 East finals between the Pacers and James\u2019 Miami Heat by blowing in James\u2019 ear and making a famously exaggerated flop. \u201cIt\u2019s actually funny that I\u2019m actually on the same team as him,\u201d Stephenson said. \u201cI\u2019m very excited to see what that brings. Just playing with him, one of the best players in the game, I can\u2019t wait to get on board with him and have a fun season this year.\u201d Stephenson appeared in all 82 games for Indiana last season, averaging 9.2 points, 5.2 rebounds and 2.9 assists per game. The Lakers are his seventh NBA franchise entering his ninth season. Stephenson is eager to run with the up-tempo Lakers and their young core, including Brandon Ingram and Lonzo Ball. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be amazing,\u201d Stephenson said. \u201cEspecially playing with the talent I\u2019m playing with, the high tempo, just playing without thinking too much and playing in the flow of the game and having fun at the same time, a team that run and guns, that\u2019s basically how I love to play.\u201d McGee joins the Lakers from the Golden State Warriors, where he won his second straight NBA championship ring. The 7-foot veteran could be the starting center for the Lakers, who have only young big men Moe Wagner and Ivica Zubac under contract after allowing Brook Lopez to leave. \u201cJaVale changes the geometry of the game,\u201d general manager Rob Pelinka said. \u201cHis unique combination of incredible length and foot nimbleness will allow us to play fast at both ends. His ability to both protect the rim and create angles with rim rolls will present a number of advantages in coach (Luke) Walton\u2019s system.\u201d The Lakers chose Mykhailiuk with the 47th overall pick in last month\u2019s draft. The Ukrainian shooter averaged 14.6 points, 3.9 rebounds and 2.7 assists per game for Kansas last season while setting the Jayhawks\u2019 single-season record with 115 3-pointers. Mykhailiuk has been impressive early in Las Vegas summer league play, and the Lakers decided they didn\u2019t need to wait to sign him later in the offseason."},{"id":39439,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/oklahoma-city-thunder-grant-permission-carmelo-anthony-no-trade-clause","date":"2018-07-10","title":"Report: Oklahoma City Thunder grant Carmelo Anthony permission to meet with other teams","content":" Carmelo Anthony and his representatives met with the Houston Rockets and Miami Heat at NBA Summer League in Las Vegas over recent days, according to a report from Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN .

Sure, there\u2019d be players getting up shots and warming up. A few could be seen stretching. You\u2019d see little clusters of two, three or four fraternizing away with opponents (despite what old-school guys today might claim). And back when no one had ever heard of a \u201cstretch five,\u201d you\u2019d have 7-footers launching 3-point attempts just for the fun of it, without any chance of ever hoisting one in a game. Heck, you\u2019d have players routinely jacking up the equivalent of 4-point shots, working on their H-O-R-S-E games from midcourt or seated on the bench or from behind the backboard. But after Grgurich joined the Seattle SuperSonics in 1992, bringing his work ethic, no-nonsense approach and wealth of coaching techniques to the league? It became a classroom, a workshop and a practice court extended to the last possible minute. And that\u2019s why Grgurich, 76, was chosen as recipient of the 2018 Tex Winter Assistant Coach Lifetime Impact Award , announced here Tuesday by the National Basketball Coaches Association (NBCA). \u201cNow,\u201d said Dallas Mavericks coach and NBCA president Rick Carlisle, \u201cthat pregame period is a time for game simulation with assistant coaches for guys who are going to be featured players on a given night. And it\u2019s conditioning and skill development for depth players or inactive.  \u201cIn an NBA season, there\u2019s so much going on, you\u2019ve got to make the most of every second. When Gurg started doing this stuff for Seattle, it was a total game-changer. He had a lot to do with getting other NBA coaches out on the floor with their players.\u201d Grgurich, a longtime assistant coach at UNLV where the Las Vegas Summer League is held, will be honored during tonight\u2019s game between the Los Angeles Lakers and New York Knicks ( 8:30 p.m. ET, ESPN2 ). Other nominees for the award were current and former assistants Ron Adams, Jim Boylan, Hank Egan, Jim Eyen, Dick Helm, Brian Hill, Jim Lynam, Brendan Malone, Bob McAdoo, Brendan Suhr and Bob Weiss. Phil Johnson, Jerry Sloan\u2019s longtime wingman, was the inaugural winner in 2016 and Ron Rothstein won the Winter award last year. \u201cI am humbled by this recognition. I always felt Tex Winter was the gold standard for all coaches,\u201d the notoriously media-averse Grgurich said in a statement. \u201cI am pleased to accept this award in honor of his great legacy.\u201d Even rabid NBA fans who have followed the league for decades might have trouble identifying Grgurich, who has stayed behind the curtain and (by choice) under-covered while working for nearly 10 teams and consulting elsewhere. Among the many players and coaches Grgurich has helped, men who swear by his know-how and approach: Gary Payton, Shawn Kemp, Scottie Pippen, Carmelo Anthony, Allen Iverson, LaMarcus Aldridge, Chauncey Billups, Marcus Camby, Kenyon Martin, Bill Cartwright, Terry Stotts, Steve Kerr, George Karl and Weiss. Karl hired Grgurich as a member of his staff multiple times (twice in Seattle, later in Milwaukee and Denver). He later referred to his work with players as a \u201ctaller, more intense Yoda.\u201d \u201cBrief, wise observations delivered in a hoarse voice,\u201d Karl wrote in his 2017 book, \u201cFurious George: My Forty Years Surviving NBA Divas, Clueless GMs, and Poor Shot Selection.\u201d \u201cGurg had an intensity that was so bright it was like looking into the sun. And he hated taking a day off.\u201d Karl said that he often used Grgurich as a \u201cpermanent mediator\u201d with players Karl found difficult, such as Payton early in his career, with every profane bit of advice and response going through the assistant. \u201cThe workaholic Gurg always preferred to be working out a player or working out himself,\u201d Karl wrote. \u201cHis intensity made players trust him and they confided in him, too. A great assistant coach.\u201d Grgurich was a coach twice. In 1975, after a decade as an assistant coach at the school, he was promoted to coach at the University of Pittsburgh and stayed for five years before heading to UNLV. In 1994, he left Seattle to return to the Runnin\u2019 Rebels, where he had spent 12 years (1980-92) as a Tarkanian assistant. But Grgurich\u2019s run there lasted only seven games \u2013 he stepped down citing both the stress of the job and leftover bitter feelings about the school\u2019s handling of Tarkanian in his recurring battles against the NCAA. His greatest work, however, has come in the 49 of 54 years he spent sitting one or more seats over from the boss. And most of it came apart from the games, filling up all the hours before and after with prep work and reviews. Mark Warkentien, a longtime NBA executive, told Sports Illustrated in 2004 , \u201cBefore Gurg, NBA assistants didn\u2019t normally work with players individually, because the mentality was, either the players are good enough or they\u2019re not. At that time, the players coming into the league were getting younger and in greater need of coaching. And Gurg was a college guy who helped bridge the gap.\u201d Another area of Grgurich\u2019s impact is his summer camp, a relatively well-kept secret in the very-public NBA. Each August for four days in Las Vegas, about 50 players (mostly rookies but some veterans) and about 35 coaches (mostly assistants) participate in drills, game situations, tutorials from NBA referees and more. But no agents and no media. It is heavy on instruction. \u201cIf you can\u2019t teach, you can\u2019t coach,\u201d Grgurich has said. There also is no cost to participants, one of Grgurich\u2019s many idiosyncrasies driven by his dedication to the game. He has worked on a series of one-year contracts, allowing him to move on if he feels ineffective or that his work with a particular team is done. These days he probably is best described as a \u201cspecial assignment\u201d coach, offering guidance where he sees the need. Grgurich hasn\u2019t been seen on the bench during games in a while now, preferring to watch from the shadows of an arena tunnel or some other backstage vantage point. He will work this season with the Pistons, new Detroit coach Dwane Casey confirmed the other day. \u201cCoach Gurg is one of those guys who stays under the radar,\u201d Casey said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t like the limelight, doesn\u2019t like talking to the media. He does all his work without people seeing who he is. But as far as a coach who has helped more players, developing them and working with them, I\u2019ve never known anyone who\u2019s done more than that guy.\u201d Casey, who first worked with Grgurich on Karl\u2019s staff in Seattle and volunteered at Grgurich\u2019s Vegas camp for years, added: \u201cI know he\u2019s going to help us a lot. Just a great motivator, a great communicator with young players and a great teacher.\u201d Grgurich\u2019s most recent NBA stint was with Milwaukee as a member of Jason Kidd\u2019s staff prior to Kidd\u2019s midseason dismissal in January. \u201cKnowing who he is and his work ethic and what he means to the game of basketball, he should be in the Hall of Fame,\u201d Kidd told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in 2016 . \u201cFor what he\u2019s done \u2026 let\u2019s just round it up to a million [basketball people he has influenced]. You might be short-changing him. He\u2019s responsible for why we have development coaches.\u201d Said Bucks center John Henson: \u201cHe\u2019s a big voice for me. He\u2019s always with the bigs. He breaks film down. His perspective is almost always brutally honest, which is great. He\u2019s going to tell you how it is.\u201d Carlisle had Grgurich on board in 2010-11 when the Mavericks won their only NBA championship and considered the assistant\u2019s work essential to that title. \u201cHe was amazing, across the board,\u201d Carlisle said. \u201cHe really helped us create a total team environment that helped get us on a roll to the championship. \u201cBased on his impact on our game, he\u2019s the greatest assistant coach in the history of NBA basketball.

That news was madly celebrated in that city \u2026 although not quite to the degree it shook Boston, Washington, Toronto and other NBA destinations on the East coast. Yes, the Lakers are happy. But an entire conference is downright delirious. Finally free from LeBron Lockdown, the Eastern Conference is feeling emancipated and flush with opportunity. \u201cThe King\u201d is gone, which is another way of saying the cat\u2019s away and everyone else finally has a chance to play. \u201cOh, it\u2019s wide open now,\u201d said Washington Wizards forward Otto Porter Jr., his eyes and smile swelling simultaneously. \u201cLike, definitely wiiide open.\u201d LeBron ran the East much like Capone once ran Chicago. First with the Miami Heat and then with the Cleveland Cavaliers, James greedily took all the East\u2019s trips into June since 2010. Eight straight East titles certainly qualify as a basketball dictatorship as James\u2019 teams kept the rest of the East from Finals runs. The last non-LeBron team from the East to reach The Finals was the 2010 Boston Celtics. Only three players from those Celtics played in the NBA last season and Rajon Rondo, one of that triumvirate, is on his fifth team since after signing with the Lakers this summer . There is joy mixed with relief mixed with enthusiasm among the East contenders. This proved evident here in Las Vegas, the unofficial offseason gathering spot for every team as the NBPA and owner\u2019s meetings all happen under one very scorching sky. Executives, coaches and players from East teams are in a noticeably good mood. Their palms are red from being rubbed together. They know they have a chance now. \u201cA lot of teams are thinking, \u2018Hey, why not us?\u2019 There\u2019s a lot of that going on,\u201d said Nick Nurse, the newly-hired coach of the Toronto Raptors. That\u2019s interesting, because there\u2019s a very good chance Nurse would still be a Raptors assistant coach if not for LeBron. When the Raptors won 59 games last season and claimed the East\u2019s No. 1 seed, there was sense of cautious optimism in Toronto. Yes, LeBron ended the Raptors\u2019 previous two playoff runs. But maybe this was different. James was older, his Cavs team weaker, Toronto cockier. Only LeBron punched them in the gut again, and harder this time, sweeping the Raptors for the second straight postseason . Because of that, Dwane Casey, the winningest coach in Raptors history and the 2017-18 Coach of the Year, was shown the door and replaced by Nurse. Although that coaching change remains the Raptors significant change this summer, constant rumblings suggest a roster shakeup could soon be in the works. There\u2019s another possible scenario, too: since LeBron is gone (and therefore Toronto can rid itself of those \u201cLeBronto\u201d wisecracks), why not stay the course with DeMar DeRozan, Kyle Lowry and Co. \u2026 at least for another year? Those decisions are above Nurse\u2019s pay grade, so he\u2019s assuming the status quo will remain unless it doesn\u2019t. Meanwhile, he\u2019s not taking something else for granted. \u201cYou can\u2019t automatically say, `Oh geez, we lost to LeBron every year and this is guaranteed for us.\u2019 There\u2019s a lot of other good teams. I think the competitive nature will spread across the East now. We put a couple pieces together, have great chemistry, and if we stay healthy? OK. We\u2019re in the upper echelon, we know we\u2019ll have a shot. We just have to go out and do it.\u201d Those LeBron scars run deeper for the Indiana Pacers. They lost to James\u2019 teams five times in the playoffs since 2012, including a Game 7 loss in the 2013 Eastern Conference finals . And LeBron, doing the damage with the Heat and Cavs, ruined some solid Pacers squads comprised of Paul George, David West, Danny Granger, George Hill , a short window of stardom from Roy Hibbert and the ear-blowing Lance Stephenson. Pacers coach Nate McMillan said: \u201cWhen you look at what this guy has done to us, and how he was a nemesis to us, yes, we all say, `Bye bye.\u2019 Him leaving is a good thing.\u201d But almost reflexively, McMillan adds: \u201cIt\u2019s still going to be tough.\u201d The Pacers are an interesting piece in the East mix. Two years ago, they were in ruins after James\u2019 teams ended so many of their playoff runs. George, sensing doom there, leveraged a trade to the Oklahoma City Thunder last summer . Sometimes, basketball life comes at you quickly. And it breathed life into the Pacers with Victor Oladipo arriving in the George trade to take a star turn and become a franchise player. Behind McMillan\u2019s coaching and a solid supporting cast, the Pacers pushed LeBron\u2019s Cavs to a Game 7 in the first round . They had chances to win that series, which would\u2019ve been delicious irony. Indiana\u2019s important pieces are back next season, along with offseason additions Doug McDermott and Tyreke Evans. Suddenly their ceiling is higher. McMillan even suggested the style of play could be different in the East because of LeBron leaving and the strengths of the teams that will be in the hunt. \u201cThe East could go back to more of a grind type of play and not that spread-the-floor play,\u201d McMillan said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talent and some of that talent is concentrated in the post. We might go back to the old NBA where the West was up-tempo and the East was a grind. You\u2019ve got Blake Griffin in Detroit, Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons in Philly, Boston has size and Toronto can play more of a half-court style.\u201d In multiple ways, then, the East will look different. There\u2019s high anticipation in Boston, where the Celtics forced Game 7 in the East finals vs. the Cavs despite not having Kyrie Irving and Gordon Hayward. The Sixers have Embiid and Simmons and maybe more if they can trigger a trade for San Antonio Spurs star Kawhi Leonard. The Wizards added Dwight Howard and Porter Jr. says Washington will be in the East mix should everyone stay healthy. \u201cWith the pieces we added this summer, there\u2019s definitely an opportunity,\u201d he said. \u201cDwight has a present in the post. That alone is going to open up lanes and 3-point shots. Guys I\u2019ve talked to are excited for a fresh start. We didn\u2019t end the year the way we wanted. But there\u2019s a whole new beginning now.\u201d It\u2019s a fresh start for all involved in the East. \u201cThe King\u201d has been deposed, rather, displaced. It is only July, barely into summer, with a new season still months away. Yet the regime change is already causing a stampede. * * * Veteran NBA writer Shaun Powell has worked for newspapers and other publications for more than 25 years.

He won\u2019t suit up in Las Vegas and, just yesterday, he signed his first NBA deal . And yet, he\u2019s far more impressive than Trae Young. This isn\u2019t fact, of course. This is based purely on the public\u2019s perception and fascination with summer basketball, which exists to give us a first chance to see rookies and a license to crystal-ball about their impact in the league. Perspective tends to get buried in summer ball, which in and of itself is an amazing success story for the NBA. The public interest in seeing a bunch of basketball dreamers is almost as intense as the scorching heat that greets fans who come in droves. The games at Thomas & Mack Arena and Cox Pavilion are usually packed and two networks (ESPN and NBA TV) show every tipoff in prime time, which generates curiosity. For the first time, all 30 teams are repping Vegas and, with the start of the next season three long months away, the appetite for the NBA is temporarily quenched. The dirty little secret is most of these players \u2014 say, 75 percent \u2014 won\u2019t be on a roster when LeBron James makes his debut with the Los Angeles Lakers this fall. And of the remaining players, only a handful \u2014 say, five or six \u2014 will make noise as rookies. That said, Young isn\u2019t tearing it up in summer ball and the armchair experts are eating that up. He\u2019s the most-watched player in Vegas mainly because he\u2019s the most polarizing player in Vegas. Young went viral last season in college at Oklahoma twice: first, when he constantly hit buckets from 30 feet for about two months, and then again when he couldn\u2019t buy a shot from anywhere. Folks howled and punished Young for being compared to Golden State Warriors star Stephen Curry \u2014 even though Young didn\u2019t do the comparing. That was done by some \u201cexpert analyst\u201d on TV and suddenly, the bar was impossibly and unfairly raised. Matching Young with a two-time MVP only because of their shared size and shot selection is like always comparing one white player to another white player. Then came draft night, and the Hawks swung a deal with the Mavericks , giving Doncic, the legendary European teenager, to Dallas for Young and a top-5 protected 2019 first-round pick. That trade went down in Atlanta like unsweetened tea. Fans wanted Doncic, someone that few ever saw play except for video highlights, which of course always edit out the bad parts. As for Young? Everyone saw him on TV and all his faults. He finished poorly in college despite leading the country in scoring and assists (a first), is barely six feet tall and needs to toughen up on defense (like most rookies). While the mystery about Doncic continues as he watches Summer League from the bench, Young is causing a stir back in Atlanta and not for all the right reasons. He\u2019s shooting 25 percent overall and 18 percent from deep. On Sunday he missed his only two shots and had a sloppy turnover before tweaking his quad and calling it a night. (Curry, in his Summer League debut in 2009, averaged 17.4 ppg while shooting 32.5 percent overall and 34.5 percent on 3-pointers . The top two Summer League scorers for Golden State in \u201909 were Anthony Morrow and Anthony Randolph. Take that for what it\u2019s worth.) It\u2019s not the missed shots that are perplexing, though, as volume shooters can sometimes brick them in bunches. Young isn\u2019t creating much space between himself and his defender, which tends to confirm concerns about his lack of first-step quickness and athletic ability. What happens when he sees far better defenders in the 2018-19 season? With the exception of his passing skills \u2014 which are sharp and often entertaining \u2014 this first impression overall isn\u2019t going well. However, he\u2019s handling that well. \u201cEverywhere I\u2019ve ever played, everyone\u2019s watching,\u201d Young said. \u201cThis is normal. But I\u2019ve worked extremely hard to get to that point where people watch. Everything else comes with it, the good and the bad. When I miss a few shots, I try to make the next shot. To me, it\u2019s all about the next shot, next play. I don\u2019t dwell on it. I know I\u2019ve progressed here and every game has gotten better.\u201d Hawks forward John Collins, who survived some Summer League jitters in 2017 and had a solid rookie season, said: \u201cI know things are going to come at him pretty fast, so I tell him to relax. Tell him to breathe. I know he has a lot of pressure on him. Whenever I see him make a good play, I know what he\u2019s capable of doing. He\u2019ll be fine. I tell him it\u2019s just Summer League, there\u2019s still time to develop and get ready.\u201d And that\u2019s sound advice for Young and anyone who takes this summer ball too seriously. Last summer in Vegas, Lonzo Ball was Trae Young: a point guard made polarizing by his overbearing father who shot poorly initially before finishing strong and winning Summer League MVP honors . Ball was destined for instant stardom, at least according to the level of applause from Laker fans. Then he shot 36 percent and 30.6 percent on 3-pointers last season. With LeBron in the fold, the Lakers just signed Rajon Rondo to help with, or take over, the point guard duties. What do Jerryd Bayless, Glen Rice Jr., Tyus Jones and Randy Foye have in common? All were Summer League MVPs. None did anything in the NBA that anyone can remember. While Young clanked shot after shot, another player the Hawks bypassed in the Draft had a strong start. Jaren Jackson Jr., taken fourth by Memphis, showed a 3-point touch and solid instincts as a rim protector. The reaction was all positive. Then on Sunday, Jackson missed eight of his nine shots and collected five fouls. As is usually the case, Summer League fame can be fleeting. Maybe the best place to be is on the bench, like Doncic, and keep people guessing that you\u2019re really good. Such is life in Summer League, especially in a social media age. Young will always be compared to Doncic because of that draft-night trade, although that\u2019s not entirely fair. Remember, the Hawks also got an extra first-round pick, and suppose the player taken with that pick turns out better than Young and Doncic? The verdict from that trade won\u2019t be known for years, although that doesn\u2019t prevent anyone from declaring a winner right now. That brings us back to Summer League and this disclaimer for those consumed by it: Enjoy what you see, but don\u2019t believe what you see. * * * Veteran NBA writer Shaun Powell has worked for newspapers and other publications for more than 25 years.

They failed to defend their Southeast Division championship, finished eighth in the Eastern Conference (after a No. 4 finish in 2016-17) and lost in the first round of the playoffs (after narrowly falling in Game 7 of the 2017 East semifinals). A large part of that 2017-18 swoon could be attributed to the time All-Star guard John Wall missed after having knee surgery in January . While Washington did manage to go 15-12 during his absence, the Wizards had just seven games with Wall before the playoffs quickly began (and quickly ended) against the top-seeded Toronto Raptors. Although the Wizards did not have much in the way of salary cap room to spend this summer, they were able to make some changes to their roster. First, they acquired guard Austin Rivers in a trade with the LA Clippers (for center Marcin Gortat). They also reached a reported deal with veteran free agent forward Jeff Green . Lastly, days ago, they reached a reported deal with former All-Star center Dwight Howard . (Howard must first reach a buyout agreement with his current team, the Brooklyn Nets, before he can enter free agency and sign with Washington). With All-Star Bradley Beal, versatile forwards Otto Porter Jr. and Kelly Oubre Jr. \u2014 as well some capable depth at other positions \u2014 already in the fold, Wall is optimistic about the Wizards\u2019 roster for 2018-19. In a interview on the Wizards Tipoff podcast on NBCSportsWashington.com , Wall talks with Chris Miller about his outlook on the team\u2019s depth and potential for next season. \u201cJust with the starters coming back, those guys (the bench) \u2014 hopefully everybody will come back healthy and in better shape \u2014 we can focus and understand what we want to be,\u201d Wall said on the podcast. \u201cIt\u2019s a good opportunity where (the starters) won\u2019t have to play as many minutes \u2026 that\u2019s the key. \u201cAt the end of the year, you\u2019re kind of fall short because you\u2019re fatigued \u2014 and nobody uses that as an excuse, you play and you try to get in the best shape possible. But when you play 24 minutes of the whole [first] half and 24 minutes of whole other half, you kind of get tired at some point. I think those guys can take a little of the burden and pressure off us sometimes.\u201d Last season, Wall and Beal combined to average 35.4 minutes per game and both ranked in the top 20 in the NBA in overall mpg . The looming addition of Howard is something Wall sees as a benefit for Washington \u2014 provided Howard can fulfill his role. \u201cI just feel like he\u2019s just that\u2019s trying to recreate his career. He\u2019s trying to change all the negative stuff people say about him,\u201d Wall said. \u201cWe know he likes to have fun, we know he likes to joke around and do those type of things. I think he\u2019s kind of locked-in and focused [now]. All we can do as teammates and a coaching staff and as an organization is try to make it comfortable for him and make him he\u2019s welcome, at home, and tell him the things we need him to do for our team to make us get better. He has to buy into that and not try to say it\u2019s all about him or try and do this for himself. You do this for the whole team and I think we\u2019ll be fine.\u201d Last season, Howard averaged 16.6 points and 12.5 rebounds for the Hornets, his 14th in the league. Wall said he spoke with Howard and thinks the center still has plenty left in the tank. \u201cWith Gortat gone, we needed somebody else to step in and be that guy for now,\u201d Wall said. \u201cWe talked and he said what he wanted and I was like, \u2018this is what our team wants and this is what we need.\u2019 \u201cEven though he\u2019s older, he\u2019s still an athletic big and still has respect in this league. He\u2019s a guy that can score in the low post. He\u2019s a guy that blocks shots. He\u2019s a guy that gets a lot of rebounds and a guy that can catch lobs and do things when teams switch against us \u2026 If you don\u2019t crack down on him it\u2019s an automatic layup or a lob. I think that benefits us a lot.\u201d Rivers, who turns 26 in August, averaged a career-best 15.1 points and four assists last season while playing for his father, Doc, the Clippers\u2019 coach. Wall is anticipating that Rivers will provide a consistent scoring punch off the bench while freeing up Oubre Jr. and backup point guard Tomas Satoransky. \u201cHe\u2019s a high-volume shooter and once he gets it going, he\u2019s going,\u201d Wall said. \u201cI think it gives us that guy we never really kind of had off the bench that can create for himself and create for his teammates at the two-guard position. He can just go out there and be the scorer for us and let Tomas [Satoransky] run the show. He can help KO [Kelly Oubre] out in transition and then having Jeff Green is another guy that can be there for them \u2026 I think that gives our second unit a deeper bench.\u201d As for the biggest move of the Eastern Conference this summer \u2014 LeBron James moving to the Los Angeles Lakers \u2014 Wall says it changes things in the East for everyone. \u201cHe did what he said he was going to do for the city of Cleveland. Now, I feel like this move is more important just for his family and kids. He\u2019s going to live life,\u201d Wall said. \u201cBoston is a tough team that\u2019s there. You have Philly that\u2019s there, Milwaukee, Toronto is there for sure. We\u2019re there. Indiana is definitely there. \u201cI just feel like it\u2019s open, that anyone of these teams can get to that [top] spot if you go out there and play and produce.\u201d"},{"id":39470,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/boston-celtics-marcus-smart-says-he-has-no-clue-about-future-team","date":"2018-07-10","title":"Marcus Smart says he has 'no clue' about where he stands with Boston Celtics","content":" Boston Celtics guard Marcus Smart is still awaiting his payday in free agency. The lack of progress on a new deal with the Celtics has been upsetting to Smart, according to those close to him . After his brief interaction with Celtics president of basketball operations Danny Ainge yesterday, Smart said he he doesn\u2019t know what his future is with the Celtics. Adam Himmelsbach of the Boston Globe reports that Ainge spotted Smart at last night\u2019s NBA Summer League game in Las Vegas between the Celtics and Charlotte Hornets at Cox Pavillion . Ainge walked down the aisle behind Smart and playfully twisted around the baseball cap Smart was wearing. Smart initially did not know who had done that to him and when he saw it was Ainge, the two briefly smiled before Ainge kept moving down the aisle and left the gym. Himmelsbach has more on what followed from that point on : Smart was one of several players to receive a qualifying offer on June 29, just before free agency opened. However, if he doesn\u2019t get an offer from elsewhere or a bigger deal from Boston, he will enter unrestricted free agency next summer. Said Celtics coach Brad Stevens yesterday: \u201cI saw him a couple days before free agency. He was in town for his camp. I saw him over at the new practice facility. I\u2019ve talked to him a bunch. I\u2019m not involved in all the negotiation part of it and all the numbers part of it, and he knows that. He also knows we really want him back. So I know our front office has worked hard to be communicative, and go from there.\u201d Via Twitter, A. Sherrod Blakely of NBCSportsBoston.com reports the Sacramento Kings are readying an offer sheet for Smart : Smart had surgery on March 16 to repair a torn ligament in his right thumb and returned in Game 5 of the Celtics\u2019 first-round series against the Milwaukee Bucks . He averaged 10.2 points, 4.8 assists, 3.5 rebounds and 29.9 minutes per game last season.

The Mavs said then that they were hopeful they could complete that transaction and, hopefully, allow Doncic to play in NBA Summer League in Las Vegas . \u201cHe has not had a live practice yet, but he will be in Vegas,\u201d Mavs coach Rick Carlisle said last week. \u201cHe is going to continue to ramp up his workload and there remains a possibility that he could play.

In an interview earlier this week with NBA TV at NBA Summer League, Carlisle said the Mavs had not been able to get Doncic into any practices but that the rookie did participate in some non-contact workouts. Dallas moved up two spots in the NBA draft last month to get the versatile Slovenian guard, who was selected by Atlanta at No. 3.

LeBron is a Laker. The Los Angeles Lakers announced the signing of LeBron James as a free agent Monday night , confirming the seismic shift created by the four-time NBA Most Valuable Player\u2019s decision to leave Cleveland for the 16-time champion franchise on the West Coast. James\u2019 representatives at Klutch Sports Group tweeted a photo of James signing his contract with Lakers general manager Rob Pelinka . The Lakers have missed the playoffs in a franchise-record five consecutive seasons, while James has played in the past eight NBA Finals with the Miami Heat and the Cleveland Cavaliers, winning three titles. The 33-year-old budding entertainment mogul immediately becomes the focus of the Lakers franchise and a possible foundation for the NBA\u2019s next superteam, depending on whether James and the Lakers can persuade more superstars to join him in the next year or two. Magic Johnson, the Lakers\u2019 president of basketball operations, called James \u201cthe best player in the world\u201d in a news release. \u201cHe loves to compete and is an awesome leader who is about winning and making sure that his teammates are successful,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThe Lakers players are excited to have a teammate who has been to nine NBA Finals. It\u2019s a huge step closer to returning the Lakers to the playoffs and to the NBA Finals.\u201d James is coming off one of his greatest NBA seasons, playing in all 82 regular-season games for the Cavaliers while finishing third in the NBA with 27.5 points per game and hitting career highs with 8.6 rebounds and 9.1 assists. He then carried Cleveland to its fourth consecutive NBA Finals, where the Cavs were swept by Golden State. Last season, James had a league-high 2,251 total points scored and became the first player in NBA history to accumulate at least 30,000 career points, 8,000 rebounds and 8,000 assists. In addition, the 15-year NBA veteran currently holds the longest-ever double-digit scoring streak at 873 games. \u201cThis is a historic moment for the Lakers, and we could not feel more grateful and honored,\u201d Pelinka said. \u201cWhen LeBron James \u2013 a perennial NBA MVP and champion who is playing at the most astonishing levels of his career \u2013 chooses to join the Lakers, it serves as the ultimate validation for what we are building here. However, we all know that the work is not yet done.\u201d A four-time NBA MVP (2009, \u201910, \u201912, \u201913), James has played in 1,143 career regular season games (1,142 starts) for Cleveland and Miami, holding averages of 27.2 points, 7.4 rebounds, 7.2 assists and 1.6 steals per game. With one of the most storied careers in NBA history, he currently ranks seventh in total points scored (31,038), 11th in all-time assists (8,208) and 16th in career steals (1,865). The Akron, Ohio, native has been named an NBA All-Star in each of the last 14 seasons, earning First Team All-NBA honors on 12 occasions, including the last 11 consecutive seasons. The 2003-04 Rookie of the Year is a five-time First Team All-Defensive Team member, a two-time Olympic Gold Medalist for Team USA (2008, \u201912) and the 2016-17 J. Walter Kennedy Citizenship Award winner. James\u2019 arrival is indeed validation for Johnson and Pelinka, who took over the Lakers\u2019 front office in February 2017 with a specific plan to rebuild the franchise by persuading established superstars to join as free agents. The Lakers already have begun assembling a revamped team around James by acquiring Rajon Rondo, JaVale McGee and Lance Stephenson in free agency while retaining guard Kentavious Caldwell-Pope. Los Angeles also assembled a reasonably talented young core before James\u2019 arrival with Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball, Kyle Kuzma and Josh Hart. But they didn\u2019t even get a meeting with star scorer Paul George before the Southern California native re-signed with Oklahoma City, and their efforts to acquire disgruntled two-way superstar Kawhi Leonard from San Antonio haven\u2019t borne fruit so far. The Lakers don\u2019t appear to be planning a public event to welcome James to Los Angeles, where he already owns multiple homes and spends summers with his family. But Blaze Pizza \u2014 the growing pizza chain in which James is an investor \u2014 announced a three-hour pizza giveaway on Tuesday to welcome James to LA. LeBron responded with a tweet , his first since June 26: \u201cHaven\u2019t been to a pizza party in a minute \u2026 Culver City?\u201d Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":39468,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/cavaliers-pacers-summer-league-recap","date":"2018-07-09","title":"Game Recap: Cavaliers 93, Pacers 88","content":"By Joel Bartilotta, RotoWire LAS VEGAS \u2014 The Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the Indiana Pacers, 93-88, in the Las Vegas Summer League at Cox Pavilion on Monday. There were seven ties and seven lead changes in this tightly contested game, with neither club ever leading by double digits. With that said, Cleveland held the advantage for the entirety of the fourth quarter, as Indiana couldn\u2019t get within a two-point margin. The second quarter was decisive for the Cavaliers, marking the only quarter decided by more than three points with Cleveland winning it, 26-18. Shooting was key for the Cavaliers, considering they hit 50 percent from the field and 35 percent from three-point range. They did that while holding Indiana to a 44.4 percent clip from the field and just 30 percent from long range. Ball movement was also critical for Cleveland, as they out-assisted Indiana, 17-11. The Pacers (1-2) were led by T.J. Leaf, as he collected 20 points, nine rebounds and two blocks on 8-of-21 shooting. Edmond Sumner returned from injury and finished with 14 points, two assists and two steals. Aaron Holiday was extremely inefficient, as he tallied 12 points, five rebounds, eight assists and eight turnovers on 4-of-14 from the field. The Cavaliers (2-1) got another gem out of Cedi Osman, who led the way with 25 points, six rebounds and six assists. Collin Sexton was the only other starter in double figures, accruing 21 points and four assists. Billy Preston led the bench with 12 points, four rebounds and two steals.

At that time, Tyson was 34-0, at the peak of his destructive, malevolent powers. He\u2019d just annihilated his previous two opponents, former champ Larry Holmes (fourth-round knockout, and the only time Holmes was KOed in his celebrated career) and Tony Tubbs (TKO, second round). At that point in his career, Tyson had knocked out or TKOed 30 of his 34 opponents. He was brutal, unsentimental and foreboding when it came to his business. The fear in the eyes of his opponents as they climbed into the ring with him was palpable. Tyson\u2019s violent past \u2014 his time spent robbing and assaulting people in Brooklyn until he fell under the tutelage of the late trainer Cus D\u2019Amato \u2014 seemed to be well-suited for his profession. \u201cMy mission,\u201d Tyson said in his post-fight interview with Larry Merchant after dispatching Tubbs , \u201cis to go and destroy, and not to let anything get involved. You get punched, you get hurt. I refuse to be hurt, knocked down or knocked out. I can\u2019t lose. I refuse to lose.\u201d Spinks had plenty of thunder in his gloves, too \u2014 he\u2019d just knocked out Gerry Cooney in the fifth round of his last fight before fighting Tyson. And he was undefeated as well at 31-0. But Spinks had been a light heavyweight before moving up to the heavyweight division; he\u2019d famously put on weight before his fight with Larry Holmes by training with Mackie Shilstone two years prior, eating fruits and wheat, lifting weights and doing sprints instead of the traditional miles-long runs boxers undertook to make weight . And while Spinks was no choir boy himself growing up in St. Louis \u2014 \u201cI embarrassed my mom a lot,\u201d he told The New York Times in 1982 , early in his pro career \u2014 he\u2019d straightened himself out, teaming with his more famous brother, Leon, to win a gold medal at the 1976 Summer Olympics .  \u201dI grabbed myself before it was too late,\u201d he told The Times . \u201dI asked for the only reality that could help me, and that was a supreme being, the Good Lord. The Good Lord was the only thing that I had to depend on to give me the confidence in myself to accomplish this feat I was challenging. And this challenge was me. I was trying to beat me. In the Bible, it says that the worst enemy you have in the world is yourself.\u201d These two forces climbed into the ring against one another on June 27, 1988. I was at the Capital Centre in suburban Maryland, which was one of the venues showing the fight on what was then known as \u201cclosed circuit\u201d TV. Basically, if you wanted to see the fight live, you had to go to an arena and pay to see it. (There were a handful of cable companies around the country that were showing the fight on what is now the traditional pay-per-view model. One of them was co-owned by the late, great Lakers owner, Jerry Buss. Would you believe much of the country didn\u2019t yet have cable?) Anyway, I was covering the fight for The Washington Post . Of course, I wasn\u2019t at the fight, which was in Atlantic City; I was there to document the reaction of fans to the fight, however it went. It went quickly. Tyson inhaled Spinks in about a minute and a half , sending him to the canvas for a first-round knockdown off a vicious left hand cross followed by a right to the body. Spinks, who\u2019d looked like he\u2019d rather have been anywhere else before the fight began \u2014 \u201che has a look of concern,\u201d said announcer Bob Sheridan as Spinks walked toward the ring \u2014 popped up at the count of three, got the standard \u201care you okay?\u201d inquiry from the referee, then waded back into battle, looking, quite reasonably, to duck. Unfortunately, as he lowered his head, Tyson brought an uppercut somewhere from the Catskills, which hit Spinks square in the noggin. Fans \u2014 I am not kidding \u2014 started racing for the exits at Cap Centre before Spinks\u2019 butt hit the canvas. And not a one of them, as best I can recall, said he or she was disappointed, or angry, at the lack of competition. No one said that it was so unfair that Tyson was so good, and his opponents so intimidated and queasy in the ring with him. No one said they didn\u2019t get their money\u2019s worth in 91 seconds\u2019 worth of action. No one said Tyson\u2019s obvious dominance over the heavyweight division was bad for boxing. * * * Thirty years have passed since that night. But while boxing has since lost much of its luster and significance amongst much of the sporting public \u2014 the occasional Floyd Mayweather event notwithstanding \u2014 the NBA hasn\u2019t. In fact, by almost every metric, the NBA is as popular a sport as it\u2019s ever been, despite the Golden State Warriors clearly being the best team in the league, having won three of the last four NBA titles. This was not the context in which many around the NBA greeted the news last week that the Warriors were going to sign DeMarcus Cousins, the All-Star free agent center. Cousins cold-called Golden State after not finding any offers to his liking on the first day of the free agent negotiating period. The Warriors were stunned \u2014 \u201cit came out of nowhere,\u201d one member of the organization said \u2014 but they quickly agreed to a one-year deal with Cousins for a little more than $5 million, the taxpayer exception. Players on other teams took the unusual step of publicly decrying the perceived increase in the Warriors\u2019 advantages on the floor by adding Cousins, he of the career 21.5 points and 11 rebounds per game \u2014 no matter that almost no one other than him expects he\u2019ll be back on the floor any time soon to the start of next season. And some fans, of course, took to social media in a 24\/7 howl of angst at how unfair it all was, and didn\u2019t Adam Silver have to do something about this, and that the Warriors had \u201cruined\u201d basketball, and how no one would watch the NBA next season \u2026 just like they said nobody would watch the NBA this past season. Television ratings for Finals games were higher during the Jordan years, to be sure, and they were higher the last two years before this year\u2019s 4-0 Golden State sweep . But there was no mass exodus of viewers during what became a fourth straight Warriors-Cavaliers Finals \u2014 this one with almost no drama or memorable moments after the bang-bang block on LeBron James and J.R. Smith\u2019s mental implosion in Game 1 . (The sweep also muted, for at least one June, the annual convention of the Tinfoil Society, which sees every Finals as an opportunity to test out their latest ref conspiracy\/league-fixing theories . What happened this year, folks? Did the NBA not need to ensure The Finals went seven games by making sure the ball was filled with boron whenever Kevin Durant had the rock?) But what of \u201ccompetitive balance,\u201d which the league went to great pains during the last lockout to signal was in peril if the former economic system was not radically fixed? The creation of the \u201csupermax\u201d deal for home grown players, ratcheting up the repeater tax, hard-capping teams that went above the luxury tax apron, limiting sign and trade deals \u2014 all of these tools were supposed to make it impossible for elite teams to hoard great players, and spread difference-making talent around the league. How\u2019s that working out so far? We have used significant bandwidth over the years knocking the myth of competitive balance in the NBA out of the sky, but it appears a refresher is in order. Once again: the NBA, with one brief exception, has never had competitive balance at any point in its 72-year history. Never. The league\u2019s first great player, George Mikan, anchored the league\u2019s first dynasty, the Minneapolis Lakers, which won five of the league\u2019s first eight championships . The NBA has been, and always will be, a league in which the very best players tend to win championships, and continue to do so through the meat of their careers. Once again: eight franchises \u2014 the Boston Celtics (17 championships), the Lakers (16, in Minnesota and L.A.), the Chicago Bulls (6), the Warriors (6, in Philadelphia and Golden State), the San Antonio Spurs (5), the 76ers (4, in Syracuse and Philadelphia), the Detroit Pistons (3) and Miami Heat (3) \u2014 have won 60 of the 72 titles in the history of the league. I wasn\u2019t a math major in college, but my calculator reports that 60 out of 72 is, roughly, 83.3 percent. So, to repeat: eight teams have won 83.3 percent of all the championships in the history of the NBA. There are currently 30 teams in the NBA. That leaves 12 more titles for the other 22 franchises over 72 years (I am not including the 17 franchises that folded in the early days of the league, all of which were defunct by 1954).  Once again: there was only one period in the history of the league that was, relatively, democratic, in the sense that there was no obvious dynasty dominating the game. From 1970-80, eight teams split up the titles: the Milwaukee Bucks (1971), the Lakers (\u201972 and \u201980), the New York Knicks (\u201970 and \u201973), the Celtics (\u201974 and \u201976), the Warriors (\u201975), the Portland Trail Blazers (\u201977), the Washington Bullets (\u201978) and the Seattle SuperSonics (\u201979). And that decade was so successful, so beloved by fans, so consumed by viewers that never knew who was going to win a title in a given season \u2026 that the NBA had to put its playoffs and Finals on tape delay to run at 11:30 p.m. Eastern time. When the NBA had no dynasties \u2026 You. Didn\u2019t. Watch. (And, before you start making excuses, there were plenty of future Hall of Famers in the game then: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, George Gervin, Bill Walton, Rick Barry, Walt Frazier, John Havlicek, Pete Maravich, David Thompson, Wes Unseld, Calvin Murphy, Bob Lanier and more.) Fans say they want parity. What they really want is to be able to watch great teams like the Warriors with familiar household names: Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson. Just as they watched Magic Johnson\u2019s Lakers against Larry Bird\u2019s Celtics, and watched Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, Dennis Rodman and coach Phil Jackson, over and over and over. Some have blamed the Warriors\u2019 hegemony on the players\u2019 union, for not accepting the league\u2019s \u201csmoothing\u2019 proposal in 2016, that would have rolled in the increase in revenues \u2014 mainly driven by the then-new $24 billion national television deal \u2014 gradually, rather than all at once. When the union rejected the smoothing concept , the cap spiked from $70 million in 2015 to $94.1 million in 2016, creating cap room for almost every team in the league, including the Warriors \u2014 who otherwise would never have had the financial wherewithal to sign Durant. I was not aware Michele Roberts held a machete to Laker management\u2019s neck at or near July 1, 2016, when the Lakers agreed to pay Timofey Mozgov $64 million and Luol Deng $72 million . The Lakers had the room to sign Durant, like everyone else. But they signed Mozgov and Deng. The Hornets had the room to sign Durant. But they re-signed Nicolas Batum . The Wizards had the room to sign Durant . But they signed Ian Mahinmi and Andrew Nicholson . The Magic had the room to sign Durant. But they signed Bismack Biyombo and D.J. Augustin . (The Magic traded Biyombo to the Hornets yesterday as part of a three-team deal that moved Mozgov to Orlando .) The Celtics, too, had the room to sign Durant. They signed Al Horford. Cue \u201c Sesame Street. \u201d The Celtics weren\u2019t yet a budding powerhouse when they signed Horford. They were a good team on the rise, but nothing that scared people. One could make the case that the Wizards were a more compelling team in the East at the time. But Boston got Horford, and Washington didn\u2019t. It was close as Horford almost signed with the Wizards. But no one cares about close. This wasn\u2019t, and isn\u2019t about smoothing. It\u2019s about decisions. It\u2019s always about decisions. NBA owners have proven, consistently over decades, that there is no economic system that can be devised that will check their competitive nature \u2014 or for their okaying really, really bad basketball decisions. And today\u2019s NBA owners, especially the new breed of venture capitalists\/hedge fund guys, are even more competitive, willing to be Processed only for so long before they again start spending like there\u2019s no tomorrow. Consider: six years ago, Oklahoma City was excoriated when it traded James Harden to the Houston Rockets , in large part because Thunder ownership was not willing to go into the luxury tax to keep its team together. Five years later, OKC is the first team in league history that crossed the $300 million mark in salary and projected tax payments for 2019. The tax payment portion will be cut by almost $100 million when the Thunder stretches Carmelo Anthony\u2019s contract , but OKC\u2019s still staring down $60 million in tax payments after getting Paul George to join Russell Westbrook in a long-term commitment.  Under the current system, everyone has to spend. But you still have to spend on the right people. The Rockets have given James Harden two contracts since 2016 that will total $228 million, and just gave Chris Paul a new $160 million max deal . The Milwaukee Bucks and Phoenix Suns have each made perfectly reasonable decisions to give extensions to their young stars, Giannis Antetokounmpo ( $100 millioon in 2016 ) and Devin Booker ( $158 million, this past weekend ). The Wizards have paid premium costs to maintain backcourt continuity with their two All-Stars, John Wall ( $204 million extension ) and Bradley Beal ( $128 million ). The Indiana Pacers\u2019 ownership is famous for avoiding the tax at all costs, but the Pacers took on Victor Oladipo\u2019s $84 million extension when they traded for him and Domantas Sabonis in the Paul George deal last summer. Whatever you think of Dan Gilbert, he came out of pocket again and again the last four years to keep James surrounded by good players \u2014 much better ones than in his first go-round in Cleveland. Warriors owner Joe Lacob may drive everyone around the league batty with his \u201clight years ahead\u201d bravado , but he\u2019s backing it up with his treasure \u2014 privately funding the $1 billion Chase Center in downtown San Francisco while going deep into the tax to keep his championship roster intact. And we haven\u2019t really seen what the league\u2019s richest owner, the LA Clippers\u2019 Steve Ballmer, is willing to do in Los Angeles. He presided over the teardown of \u201cLob City\u201d in order for his team to be a significant player in the 2019 market, but has already spent millions upgrading offices and team facilities \u2014 and paid top dollar to get Jerry West to leave the Warriors and join him as a consultant . Conversely, the Kings decided not to give DeMarcus Cousins a $200 million extension in 2017, trading him instead to the Pelicans . Which is where we came in. Cousins said no one offered him anything when free agency started, so he cold called the Dubs, looking for a gig. If so \u2026 what are we arguing about? A guy was unemployed. No one was hiring him. He thought he could still do the work. He called a shop with a spot that he thought could use him. They agreed to hire him. No one else did. The End. Nobody made Michael Spinks get in that ring with Mike Tyson. He made a decision, one whose central essence has been amplified over the years by one Richard Morgan Fleihr, from Memphis Tennessee. Mr. Fleihr is somewhat famous for his animated take on life. If you want to be the man, Mr. Fleihr says, you got to beat the man . Whining about how unfair it was that the man had all the talent on his side was nowhere mentioned. * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

Kristaps Porzingis begat Joel Embiid, who begat this year\u2019s group of young big men who have grown up facing the basket rather than with their backs to it. Among the most intriguing of the 2018 Draft class is Mo Bamba, the 20-year-old from Texas via Harlem, where he grew up \u2014 fast, as city kids tend to do, learning the game on the hardtops around New York City, while his parents, natives of Ivory Coast, wondered what the increasing fuss was around their son. He, on the other hand, has tended to handle the attention with aplomb and a smile. In a group full of long, tall people, Bamba still stands out, with an insane wingspan of 7-foot-10 that allows for court coverage the likes of which hasn\u2019t been seen. Bamba has been in the spotlight for a while \u2014 the Westtown (Penn.) High School team on which he played featured teammates like Cam Reddish, a blue-chip guard who\u2019ll play for Duke next season \u2014 and played against the likes of the No. 1 pick in 2018, Deandre Ayton . At Texas, he starred for Coach Shaka Smart, himself among the biggest names in the sport. After one season in Austin, where he shattered the school record for blocked shots in a season, Bamba declared for the Draft, assured he\u2019d be a high Lottery pick. But Bamba has also shown a willingness to work on what he doesn\u2019t \u2014 or, at least, didn\u2019t \u2014 do that well. He went to California for weeks with noted player development coach Drew Hanlen, who deconstructed Bamba\u2019s jumper from the ground up. Hanlen lowered Bamba\u2019s shot pocket, adjusted his fingers on the ball and eliminated a hitch Bamba had before shooting. Bamba displayed much improved form before the Draft, but even if he couldn\u2019t hit the broad side of a barn, he was going high \u2014 and, he did, to the Orlando Magic with the sixth pick overall. Desperate to regain relevance in the East, the Magic hired Steve Clifford after he was fired by Charlotte to try and improve their awful defense. At the least, Clifford inherited ridiculous size on his roster, with Bamba joining 6-foot-10 second-year forward Jonathan Isaac and newly re-signed 6-foot-9 forward Aaron Gordon. Bamba must show he can be a killer on the floor like Embiid, and will work to make that happen. The only significant question about him coming into the Draft was the consistency of his motor at Texas. In Las Vegas this week for Summer League with his new team, Bamba is getting his feet wet while keeping them firmly planted to the ground. Me: I know you\u2019ve spent a lot of time with Drew on the shot. What feels better now? Mo Bamba: Everything. The mechanics are so much cleaner now than they were in college. I think the difference between college and now is just a matter of just repetition, being able to change my jump shot dramatically because of how much I\u2019ve gone in and worked on it. Me: So with time, you can basically improve anything? MB: Yeah, my jump shot is night and day. Me: He also told me that one thing he wanted to keep working with you on after the Draft was, you have a little jump to your left when you shoot? MB: Yeah, that\u2019s a bad tendency that I have. That\u2019s something Drew didn\u2019t want to change. He changed a lot of things, and that\u2019s one of the best things about working with Drew \u2014 he knows boundaries, and he knows how much is too much. That\u2019s one of the things he didn\u2019t want to change right off the bat. But that\u2019s something I\u2019ve been conscious of and something I\u2019ve been working on since he pointed it out. Me: Given where you played high school, was there more pressure on you playing for Westtown or playing for Texas? MB: I\u2019d say there was more pressure playing \u2014 well, actually, it was both, equal. My sophomore year at Westtown, there was a lot of pressure, because I was at a program that had never won a state championship, and had gotten to the finals three or four years in a row. At Texas, I was coming to a team that hadn\u2019t made the NCAA Tournament the year before. So I\u2019d say it was pretty equal. Me: I would imagine playing on a team like that in high school, with Cam and all the others, maybe prepared you not only for college, but playing in the pros. MB: Yeah, Cam can go. He\u2019s a really good basketball player. And I know for a fact I\u2019ll see him here next year. Me: What was Harlem like to grow up in, day by day? MB: It was, when people ask that, I pretty much tell them that you just grow up fast. You\u2019re making decisions at a very young age that most kids don\u2019t even come close to making. I credit a lot of my success to being from Harlem, growing up there. Me: Harlem\u2019s changed a little the last few years. MB: Yeah, gentrification is real. It\u2019s real. Me: What was it like seeing that demographic shift? MB: Well, I was kind of there before gentrification kind of really hit. Obviously there was a bunch of condos that went up and it was pretty cool to see. It was every time I came back home \u2014 I\u2019d see a new development going up. Me: Best advice your parents ever gave you? MB: I wouldn\u2019t say it was direct advice or a quote. I\u2019d say the best thing my parents passed on to me was to let me make my own mistakes and figure out on my age how to kind of see the world on my own. Growing up as the youngest child, one or two years after your siblings, obviously that\u2019s great. You\u2019re learning without truly making the mistakes on your own. But at some point in your life, you\u2019re gonna have to learn on your own. You\u2019re gonna have to fall to rise. Me: Conversely, then, what\u2019s the biggest mistake you\u2019ve made so far? MB: I\u2019d say that the biggest mistake I\u2019ve made so far was not committing to Texas earlier. I think waiting was awesome. I was very methodical about waiting, very strategic about what I wanted in a university. But at the same time, if I could go back, I probably would have committed my junior year, so I could hit the ground running and build the relationships, get to know people. Me: How much freedom did Shaka give you when you were there to try things on the floor that might not necessarily be good for the team, but could be good for you individually down the road? MB: Coach Smart, he\u2019s given me so much freedom to sort of grow into who I was. That\u2019s been a big thing in my life \u2014 my parents and all of my coaches. Coach Smart did a great job of just letting me come to terms with myself, as a basketball player and a person. Me: I saw in one of your interviews before the Draft that you don\u2019t think people really understand you when you say you\u2019re a unicorn. So define that for me as you see it. MB: Well, I mean, people kind of have a concept of what it means. To me, it\u2019s just someone who makes plays that have never been seen before \u2014 a 7-foot big guard, those are all unicorns to me. Me: You played against Ayton and guys like Jarrett Allen (the Nets\u2019 first-round pick in 2017) in high school, and I know how much you\u2019ve looked at Joel Embiid on tape. Are you guys the new normal when it comes to the next generation of bigs? MB: Yeah, I think this is becoming a theme, and you\u2019ll see it more and more with guys coming out of high school. One of the guys you\u2019ll see coming up is James Wiseman (the 6-foot-11 rising senior center currently playing at East High School in Memphis, and who is considered by many to be the top college prospect in the Class of 2019). He\u2019s younger, but he does a lot of the things that I do, that Deandre does, that Jarrett does. It\u2019s refreshing to see so many people that can do what I do. Me: If you were 6-feet tall instead of seven, what would you be doing? MB: I\u2019d have to be around the game, like a scout or a GM, something around the game. Me: How did the basketball bug bite you so hard growing up? MB: Honestly, it\u2019s just my competitive nature. It bleeds over into other aspects of my life. But basketball is just something that I really excelled at, and whenever I hit kind of adversity, or whenever I do something that makes me vulnerable enough to get better and to ask for help, I just took this and ran with it. Me: Since you\u2019re a kid, I have to ask you how good you are at Fortnight? MB: I play recreationally. One of my best friends is really good at it, and whenever I play him I get Ws. \u2014 Hornets\u2019 rookie Miles Bridges ( @MilesBridges ), Tuesday, 5:32 p.m., who was apparently baptized by old man\/second-year teammate Dwayne Bacon \u2014 a whopping two-plus years older than the 20-year-old Bridges. \u201cHave you ever been unemployed?

They\u2019re back. From Buddy Phipps: There\u2019s another shoe to drop next summer, Buddy \u2014 with all due respect, LeBron didn\u2019t leave Cleveland and his home because of Lance, Rondo, etc. With James on the ground in L.A., the Lakers are all but assured to get one of the group of elite players who\u2019ll be unrestricted in 2019 \u2014 Kawhi Leonard, Klay Thompson, Kemba Walker or someone else who shakes free or is otherwise available. In the interim, James will be surrounded by tough-minded, veteran, defense-centric players (along with the re-signed Kentavious Caldwell-Pope) who\u2019ll create turnovers and allow LeBron to take a break at that end of the court \u2014 where his effectiveness has dropped off significantly the last couple of seasons. They\u2019ll all help the young guys advance their learning curves. I wouldn\u2019t pencil them in for a Western Conference finals just yet, but they\u2019re just starting their rise back up to the top. This will be a 2-3 year process. Indy Films Are Almost Always Compelling. From Nicholas Small: Indy\u2019s had a productive offseason, to be sure \u2014 Evans was a great pickup, and Kyle O\u2019Quinn might be even better for the cost outlay. (I hope McDermott can stick; I still think there\u2019s a good player in there.) Definitely agree that a top three finish is possible; the Pacers can score, will have quality depth and are well coached. When D.C. doesn\u2019t stand for Disappointing, Constantly. From Tucker Morris: Considering their cap limitations, the Wizards did fine \u2014 though I wouldn\u2019t be thrilled with an option year for 2019 for Howard if I were a Wizards fan. Next summer is so crucial for them. If they don\u2019t make a major move to upgrade their talent, it\u2019s going to be very, very difficult to do so any time later, with John Wall and Bradley Beal eating up increasingly large chunks of the cap. And any dollar already spoken for hurts that effort (though I suppose it\u2019s possible an opted-in Howard could have some trade value next summer). But, to your point: bringing in Howard, Rivers and Green should give Washington a more versatile nine-man rotation to use in a more navigable East next season. Pencil me in. From Roderick Moy: Normally, it comes out in early August. My guess is it\u2019s not yet finalized, given some of the player movement we\u2019ve seen already \u2014 starting obviously with LeBron opting for the Lakers. The Lakers tend to be close to maxed out every year with national TV appearances no matter how good or bad they are, such is their national appeal; but LeBron leaving Cleveland means his old team, the Cavs, are now being excised with haste from ESPN and TNT master schedules. And if the Spurs decide to trade Kawhi Leonard, my guess is they\u2019ll also not be a priority for the networks and have their TV footprint reduced as well. So, another few weeks. Send your questions, comments and cool drinks when it\u2019s too hot for the hot tub  to daldridgetnt@gmail.com . If your e-mail is funny, thought-provoking or snarky, we just might publish it! 6,829 \u2014 Career assists for Tony Parker, 19th all-time in NBA history and the Spurs\u2019 franchise leader, after reportedly agreeing to a two-year deal last week to join the Charlotte Hornets after spending 17 seasons in San Antonio. Parker is second on the Spurs\u2019 all-time list in games played (1,198) and minutes played (37,236), and is fourth in points (18,493). 14 \u2014 Players in Lakers franchise history who have worn the number 23, the latest being Gary Payton II. LeBron James will be the 15th after reportedly agreeing to a four-year deal in Los Angeles last week , joining Ed Kalafat, Boo Ellis, Jim Barnes, Stu Lantz (the team\u2019s long-time TV analyst), Lou Hudson, Tony Jackson, Jerome Henderson, Reggie Jordan, Cedric Ceballos, Mario Bennett, Mitch Richmond, Von Wafer, Lou Williams and Payton II. $50,000,000 \u2014 Potential luxury tax payments the Nuggets saved for 2019 by agreeing to trade Wilson Chandler and future Draft picks to the 76ers last week for cash . After agreeing to a max extension for center Nikola Jokic, the Nuggets had to shed at least one significant contract \u2014 one of either Chandler or Kenneth Faried ($13.7 million next season) \u2014 to avoid significant luxury tax jail next year. Philly says it plans to keep the31-year-old Chandler rather than re-route him in any potential trade packages. 1) I wouldn\u2019t plan a parade down Beale Street just yet, but the Grizzlies have had a good couple of weeks, drafting Jaren Jackson, Jr., and Jevon Carter, and then getting Spurs forward Kyle Anderson after San Antonio declined Sunday to match the Grizzlies\u2019 four-year, $37 million offer sheet for the third-year forward. Memphis lost Tyreke Evans to Indiana in free agency, and that\u2019s not nothing; the Grizzlies, as everyone around the league watched in shock, didn\u2019t move Evans at the trade deadline last February while in full tank mode, when they could have gotten a good asset for him, insisting they\u2019d be able to re-sign him. But getting Jackson, Carter and SloMo are a good recovery, and if Mike Conley, Jr., is back and healthy next year, the debut of Grit-N-Grind 2.0 shouldn\u2019t be too far away. 2) Dan Gilbert used both the right tone and the right font this time in his statement after LeBron James announced he was leaving Cleveland for a second time , this time to play for the Lakers. As Gilbert wrote, no one can ever take away the Cavs\u2019 historic 2016 championship \u2014 and both James and Gilbert were chiefly responsible for making that happen. They\u2019ll be linked forever. 3) Congrats to the Lynx\u2019s Rebekkah Brunson on becoming the WNBA\u2019s all-time rebounder last week . 3a) And congrats to the Mystics\u2019 Mike Thibault , who became the first coach in WNBA history to win his 300thgame in the league last week, a big road triumph over the L.A. Sparks. 4) The President of the United States refers to people like this in my business as The Enemy of the People . 1) You lose the ability to be stunned if you work in this business long enough, but hearing that former UCLA star Tyler Honeycutt was killed in a shootout with Los Angeles police Friday is hard to process. When he came out of Westwood, I thought Honeycutt had a real shot to make an NBA roster. It never worked out for him, though, after being taken high in the second round in 2011 by Sacramento; he played briefly in two years there before being traded to Houston in 2013. He never played for the Rockets, though he did play briefly for their G League affiliate, but had been playing well overseas the last few years. We will find out in due course what led him to where he was Friday in L.A., and what happened there. It will not erase the monumental sadness at contemplating the end of a life far too soon. 1A) RIP as well to Cliff Rozier,  who passed last week to a heart attack at age 45 . The former first-round pick of the Warriors in 1994 played in 173 games over three-plus NBA seasons, mostly for Golden State. 1B) And, RIP to Hall of Famer Frank Ramsey,  who passed away Sunday . The seven-time NBA champion was one of the great Celtics in the Bill Russell era, playing all nine of his pro seasons in Boston from 1954-64 (he served in the Army during the 1955-56 season). On a Celtics roster full of All-Stars, Ramsey was one of the first NBA players to thrive in what came to be known as the \u201csixth man,\u201d totaling 8,378 points, 16thmost in franchise history. His number 23 was retired by the Celtics in 1964 after his final season with the team. 1C) What an awful week. 2) Almost every NBA career ends the way Tony Parker\u2019s will \u2014 not with the team with whom he became famous and will be remembered when he goes into the Hall of Fame. But they almost all end this way. So, Parker will reportedly play for the Hornets this coming season and next , and hopefully after that will re-sign for a valedictory in San Antonio, where he was one of the best point guards of his generation \u2014 a Finals MVP in 2007 and a fierce competitor at the highest level, the winner of four championships and a central figure with one of the best organizations in the history of team sports.  3) The sudden and startling end of microfracture surgery for almost all NBA players . 4) I like Thon Maker, a lot.

Adding a big man of his caliber to the two-time defending NBA champions doesn\u2019t seem fair to most \u2014 but it\u2019s worth remembering that Cousins is still recovering from the Achilles injury that halted his season with the New Orleans Pelicans in late January. Cousins recently told ESPN\u2019s Marc J. Spears that he\u2019s shooting to return by training camp in late September. Whenever he does step back on the court, the Warriors will have an almost unprecedented collection of talent featuring two MVPs (Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry), three career 20-point scorers (Durant, Curry, Cousins), another career 19-point scorer (Klay Thompson) and a Defensive Player of the Year (Draymond Green) with 27 All-Star appearances between them, all under the age of 30. For Warriors GM Bob Myers, the long-term goal \u2014 Cousins contributing in the 2019 playoffs \u2014 is what matters most. He said as much yesterday, writes Mark Medina of The Mercury News : The Warriors lost free-agent center JaVale McGee to the Los Angeles Lakers on July 1 and fellow backup big man\/free-agent Zaza Pachulia is reportedly headed to the Detroit Pistons . That leaves second-year center Jordan Bell and third-year center Damian Jones in line for the lion\u2019s share of center minutes while Cousins mends. The Warriors are expected to re-sign restricted free agent Patrick McCaw and add forward Jonas Jerebko, who was waived by the Utah Jazz recently.

Yet, this summer, a report surfaced that the Los Angeles Lakers might try to trade for Lillard . Lillard himself, though, isn\u2019t having such talk and made sure to discourage any notion he is unhappy in Portland. While he was indeed disappointed to see Ed Davis leave via free agency (he signed with the Brooklyn Nets this summer), Lillard is overall pleased with the Blazers and the direction of the team. Joe Freeman of The Oregonian has more : In 2017-18, Portland made it to the playoffs for the fifth straight year after finishing the season 49-33 and winning the Northwest Division title for the seventh time in franchise history. The Blazers were boosted by a 13-game winning streak that started with a victory over the Golden State Warriors just before the All-Star break, and secured the third seed in the Western Conference. The team\u2019s streak matched the franchise record. Lillard drove the team\u2019s success during that span. In March he averaged 27.9 points, 4.6 rebounds and 6.5 assists. He also set a franchise record by making 64 straight free throws. He was named the West\u2019s player of the week twice. And, at season\u2019s end, he was named All-NBA first team for the first time in his career. Aside from sharing his thoughts on the Blazers\u2019 offseason and his happiness with being in Portland, Lillard also recently commented about the WNBA \u2014 specifically how much the league\u2019s players are paid. In an interview at Saturday\u2019s Connecticut Sun vs. Las Vegas Aces game, Lillard spoke with HerHoopStats on Twitter about WNBA wages : In addition, Toronto Raptors star guard DeMar DeRozan spoke out about WNBA wages, too, in an interview with HerHoopStats : Information from The Associated Press was used in this report. * * *"},{"id":39486,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/lakers-bulls-summer-league-recap-2","date":"2018-07-09","title":"Game Recap: Los Angeles Lakers 69, Chicago Bulls 60","content":"By Juan Carlos Blanco, RotoWire LAS VEGAS \u2014 Josh Hart scored 19 points to lead the Los Angeles Lakers to a 69-60 victory against the Chicago Bulls in the Las Vegas Summer League at Thomas and Mack Center on Sunday.

The rest of the league likely agrees. Cousins signed his contract Friday to join the two-time defending NBA champion Warriors for this coming season, one in which he\u2019ll make $5.3 million. He isn\u2019t sure when his surgically repaired Achilles will allow him to start playing with his new team \u2013 being ready for the start of training camp seems quite doubtful \u2013 but he can already envision what might happen when he returns to form. \u201cOf course it\u2019s going to take a lot of hard work, a lot of hard work and dedication, and also a lot of sacrifice from not only myself but other guys on the team as well,\u201d Cousins told reporters Friday night at the NBA Summer League. \u201cThat\u2019s something that we all are aware of and that\u2019s something we accepted already.\u201d When he returns, something he says he won\u2019t do until he\u2019s back to 100 percent, the Warriors could have a starting five composed entirely of 2018 All-Stars \u2013 Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson at guard, Kevin Durant and Draymond Green at forward, Cousins at center. It\u2019s mindboggling even for Warriors coach Steve Kerr to think about. \u201cWe just felt like we didn\u2019t have enough All-Stars,\u201d Kerr deadpanned in an in-game interview with ESPN\u2019s Mark Jones and Doris Burke during the Warriors\u2019 summer league game Friday. Kerr told the story of his meeting with Cousins and how he asked him the following first question: When seven consecutive possessions go by and Curry and Thompson take all the shots, how will you feel? If it was a test, Cousins passed easily. He assured Kerr that wouldn\u2019t be a problem. \u201cWe wanted to make sure it made sense for both sides,\u201d Kerr said. Cousins has been an All-Star in each of the last six seasons, averaging at least 24 points per game in each of those. With the Warriors, he knows the scoring numbers will likely dip. Again, he apparently has no problem with that. He said he can see some nights where he takes only four shots, even though that\u2019s happened only four times in his 535-game career. \u201cIt may be some games where I\u2019m the leading scorer,\u201d Cousins said. \u201cI look at that as a positive. I don\u2019t have to be the guy every night. I\u2019ve always wanted a team where everything doesn\u2019t rely on me and now I\u2019m in that position.\u201d He\u2019s going to be in playoff position as well. Cousins has never lost an NBA playoff game, because he\u2019s never appeared in an NBA playoff game. His last postseason playing experience was with Kentucky and its run to the Elite Eight of the NCAA Tournament in 2010. \u201cI\u2019m coming in just playing my part,\u201d Cousins said. \u201cI\u2019ll do whatever it takes to help this team win. Of course, I\u2019m in a position where I\u2019m able to play for a championship and every NBA player\u2019s goal is to win a championship.

Two teams featuring rosters with solid NBA regular-season experience unsurprisingly put on a competitive show for all four quarters, with one performance especially standing out. Furkan Korkmaz, a 2016 first-round pick of the Sixers (0-1), exploded for 40 points on the strength of eight three-pointers. His impressive sharpshooting almost enabled the Sixers to pull out a victory in a game they trailed in at the end of each quarter.

Rondo agreed to a one-year deal worth $9 million earlier this week to suit up alongside James, whose signing hasn\u2019t yet been announced by the Lakers. The veteran point guard is eager to be a mentor to Lonzo Ball, and he sees a chance for immediate success with the thoroughly revamped club. The Lakers haven\u2019t made the playoffs for a franchise-record five consecutive seasons, but Rondo believes they\u2019ll make immediate strides back toward contention for a 17th NBA championship. \u201dYou put any group of players around LeBron James, as he has done (eight) straight times, he went to the finals,\u201d Rondo said. \u201dSo my expectations are the exact same thing. Even with the Warriors adding (DeMarcus Cousins) and the Rockets being who they are, I think we fit right up there in the mix. It is early, obviously, and I\u2019m not promising anything, but at the end of the day, I expect to win. Nothing else.\u201d Rondo is a familiar figure to Lakers fans, and not necessarily in a good way. He played a major role for the Celtics when they met the Lakers in the NBA Finals, winning a ring with Boston in 2008 and losing to LA in 2010. Seeing Rondo on the other side of that enduring NBA rivalry won\u2019t be as weird to Rondo as it might be to some Lakers fans. \u201dDoes it feel strange? Um, no,\u201d Rondo said. \u201dMy battles with the Lakers were over a decade ago, and none of the players I was battling with are on the same roster.\u201d The 32-year-old Rondo expressed no concerns about playing with Ball, the precocious passer chosen by the Lakers with the second overall pick in last year\u2019s draft. Ball will be sidelined for most of the summer with a torn meniscus in his left knee, but Rondo is eager to work on their chemistry in the fall. \u201dI\u2019m excited to get a player that age and try to help him as much as I can,\u201d said Rondo, a starter for all but small portions of his first 12 NBA seasons spent with five franchises. Rondo sees the Lakers\u2019 potential surplus of ball-handlers as an advantage.

Rather than spend time and money trying to make a splash by bringing in a high-profile free agent, the Jazz are banking on continued internal development and continuity to boost a team that finished the 2017-18 season on a tear. That approach is reflected in the team\u2019s decision to bring back free agents Derrick Favors, Dante Exum, and Raul Neto under new multi-year contracts. \u201dChemistry is a hard thing,\u201d Jazz GM Dennis Lindsey said at a press conference on Friday announcing the three free-agent signings. \u201dIt\u2019s a hard thing to predict. You can get five great people in the room and have it just not click for whatever reason, so we didn\u2019t want to overthink that.\u201d Terms of the contracts were not disclosed. Keeping Utah\u2019s roster virtually intact going into the 2018-19 season appears to be a sound move given how the Jazz finished this past NBA season. Utah earned the fifth seed in the West with a 48-34 record, going 29-6 over their final 35 games, and advanced to the conference semifinals for the second straight year. Utah became the first team since the 2004-05 New Jersey Nets to end the regular season with a winning record after being nine games below .500 on Jan. 22. The Jazz were 19-28 before their season-changing turnaround began. That strong finish helped convince Favors to return to Utah rather than seek a larger role elsewhere. \u201dIt was very important,\u201d Favors said. \u201dI saw what we had and what we could accomplish in a full season when everyone\u2019s healthy.\u201d Bringing back Favors became a top priority for the Jazz front office. Last season, Favors became just the 12th player to appear in at least 500 career games for Utah and returned to form after enduring a spate of injuries in the previous two seasons. He appeared in 77 games, his most since the 2012-13 season, and averaged 12.3 points and 7.2 rebounds in averaging 28.0 minutes, posting 15 double-doubles and scoring 20 or more points six times. Lindsey acknowledged that the veteran forward played an indispensable role in getting the Jazz out of the first round in each of the last two seasons. The team\u2019s continued loyalty has made an impact on Favors. \u201dThey stuck by me through the ups and downs,\u201d he said. \u201dThey believed in me. When Kevin (O\u2019 Connor) traded for me in 2011, he told me from day one he wanted me here for the long run. He wanted me to retire as a Jazz man. Hopefully, it happens.\u201d Despite injuries that have robbed Exum of nearly two full seasons (a torn ACL forced him to miss 2015-16), continued belief in his skills and potential made bringing him back another priority. The 22-year-old point guard out of Australia made an impact off the bench last season in a limited role after undergoing preseason surgery on his left shoulder. He averaged 8.1 points, 3.1 assists and 1.9 rebounds in 14 games. Now, with a new contract and better health in this offseason, he feels like he\u2019s in a good place. \u201dWith the ACL year, I didn\u2019t get the opportunity to play at the end of the season and connect with the team,\u201d said Exum, who was selected fifth overall in the 2014 NBA draft. \u201dI got that opportunity this last season, and I got film to go off of where I can get better, but it\u2019s the same mentality \u2013 trying to get better in every aspect of the game. \u201dI need to keep improving on the stuff I\u2019m already good at.\u201d Neto has spent three seasons with the Jazz as their No. 3 point guard. He played in 41 games last season and averaged 4.5 points, 1.8 assists and 1.2 boards while averaging 12.1 minutes. For Neto, coming back to a team where he\u2019s comfortable and familiar with his role felt like a no-brainer. \u201dI\u2019m always going to be ready to play, if it\u2019s one minute or 20,\u201d Neto said."},{"id":39547,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/former-nba-player-clifford-rozier-dies-after-heart-attack","date":"2018-07-06","title":"Former NBA player Clifford Rozier dies after heart attack","content":" BRADENTON, Fla.

The Suns spent virtually all of their cap space on the 14-year veteran NBA forward, who agreed to a one-year, $15 million contract. On Friday, he was introduced as the newest member of a team that believes it is close to turning the corner after years of losing. \u201dThey are a young team with a lot of talent that don\u2019t know how to win,\u201d Ariza said. The 6-foot-8 forward will go from Houston, the team with the best record in the NBA last season, to the Suns, who had the worst and haven\u2019t made the playoffs in eight years. \u201dWe need his defensive ability and versatility, his shooting ability,\u201d McDonough said, \u201dbut I think as much as anything, maybe more than anything, we need his leadership and his winning pedigree.\u201d When the Suns had their first interview with new coach Igor Kokoskov, they asked what free agent out there would fit the team\u2019s needs. \u201dI swear the first words out of his mouth was Trevor Ariza,\u201d McDonough said. Ariza, who turned 33 last Saturday, played for the Rockets the past four seasons. Before that, there were stops in Washington, New Orleans, Houston (the first time), the Los Angeles Lakers, Orlando and the New York Knicks. He averaged 11.7 points per game last season, shooting 37 percent from 3-point range. He\u2019s a career 35 percent 3-point shooter averaging 10.5 points per game. Ariza has made the playoffs nine times and is looking to show the young Suns, with talents such as Devin Booker, Josh Jackson and this year\u2019s No. 1 overall pick Deandre Ayton, what it takes to succeed. \u201dIn order to be a great team you have to be selfless,\u201d Ariza said. \u201dYou have to be a real live dog to come out there and compete every night.

It\u2019s practice. It\u2019s the way he approaches the game, the way he approaches the off days, film, just everything.\u201d Ariza credited the Suns\u2019 approach for his signing. \u201dPhoenix was the most aggressive team, and the team that showed the most interest,\u201d he said, \u201dand, as human beings, we all want to feel appreciated and wanted. When a team just shows that much appreciation with what you do, naturally you\u2019re just attracted to something like that.

Parker, the 2007 NBA Finals MVP, is expected to sign a two-year deal with the Hornets and informed the Spurs of his decision, according to ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski ( via Twitter ). The only coach Parker has only known during his career, Gregg Popovich, later released a statement on the impact the point guard had on the franchise. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to put into words how important Tony Parker has been to the Spurs franchise over the past two decades,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cFrom his first game in 2001 at age 19, TP has impressed and inspired us \u2013 day-after-day, game-after-game, season-after-season \u2013 with his passion, dedication and desire.

In March, a frustrated Parker told the media that his injury was \u201ca hundred times worse\u201d than Leonard\u2019s. And per Wojnarowski\u2019s report, that was that with Leonard and the Spurs. According to Wojnarowski, Leonard was upset with Parker\u2019s comments about Leonard\u2019s injury, where he missed most of last season coping with a quad injury. The Undefeated\u2019s Marc J. Spears caught up with Parker on Friday, who wanted to clarify his position on Leonard ( via Twitter ). Parker hoped to make it an even 20 seasons with the Spurs , which would require the team to re-sign him for three years. Parker willingly gave up his starting role to youngster Dejounte Murray last season. In his final season with the Spurs, Parker played 55 games averaged 7.7 points and 3.5 assists. During his career, the six-time All-Star averaged 15.8 points and 5.7 assists. He was part of 137 playoff wins with Popovich, the second most by any coach and player in NBA history. Popovich and Spurs star Tim Duncan combined for 157 playoff wins. Parker was part of the Spurs\u2019 Big Three with Duncan and Manu Ginobili.

Thunder general manager Sam Presti said at the end of the season that he doesn\u2019t expect Anthony\u2019s role to change. \u201dI give him an enormous amount of credit for the fact that he put both feet in,\u201d Presti said. \u201dI personally think he did an excellent job in his first year transitioning his game, working to becoming more of an off-the-ballplayer, being more reliant on other people to generate his offense, and sacrificing a lot. At the same time, I think every player is entitled to take a step back after the season, reflect on the year they had, and in his case have to make a determination about whether or not this is a role that he wants to continue to be functioning in.\u201d Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":39586,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/houston-rockets-luc-mbah-moute-wants-return-team","date":"2018-07-06","title":"Luc Mbah a Moute still hoping to remain with Houston Rockets","content":" Last season, Luc Mbah a Moute proved to be a key piece to the Houston Rockets\u2019 run to a franchise-record 65 wins.

In 2016, they added unrestricted free-agent big man Al Horford of the Atlanta Hawks and last summer, they plucked Gordon Hayward from the Utah Jazz in free agency. Boston hasn\u2019t made a splash this summer and has yet to re-sign guard Marcus Smart, who is a restricted free agent. Smart is one of the few \u201cname\u201d players yet to reach a deal in free agency and, per Mark Murphy of the Boston Herald , he is reportedly upset about the lack of talks with the Celtics. Someone close to the Smart camp, who requested anonymity from the newspaper in speaking about Smart\u2019s situation, told Murphy that Smart isn\u2019t upset about the limited offers he has received. For Smart, it seems to be more about what Boston has not done so far in free agency : Smart was one of several players to receive a qualifying offer on June 29, just before free agency opened. However, if he doesn\u2019t get an offer from elsewhere or a bigger deal from Boston, he will enter unrestricted free agency next summer. According to the source who spoke to the Boston Herald , Smart seems to have made his peace with that option, too. Smart had surgery on March 16 to repair a torn ligament in his right thumb and returned in Game 5 of the Celtics\u2019 first-round series against the Milwaukee Bucks . He averaged 10.2 points, 4.8 assists, 3.5 rebounds and 29.9 minutes per game last season. In the playoffs, he averaged 9.8 ppg, 5.3 apg, 3.7 rpg and 29.9 mpg, appearing in 15 games (and starting four). * * *"},{"id":39583,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/jazz-hawks-summer-league-recap","date":"2018-07-06","title":"Game Recap: Jazz 92, Hawks 87","content":"By Joel Bartilotta, RotoWire SALT LAKE CITY \u2013 The Utah Jazz defeated the Atlanta Hawks, 92-87, in the finale of the Utah Summer League at Vivint Smart Home Arena on Thursday.

And who\u2019s the best team?  * * * Steve Aschburner :  Giannis Antetokounmpo is now the best player in the East \u2014 and if he develops a reliable perimeter shot, he soon could restore some balance as the best player in the NBA. With Mike Budenholzer taking over for drama king Jason Kidd (and interim man Joe Prunty) as the Milwaukee Bucks\u2019 coach, hopefully we\u2019ll see the \u201cGreek Freak\u2019s\u201d talents blossom in all their glory and be put to proper team use. The best team figures to be the Boston Celtics , presumably with Kyrie Irving back at point guard, Gordon Hayward feeling like a brand-new free agent signee all over again and coach Brad Stevens and basketball boss Danny Ainge sorting out the rotation and depth chart. Now, if Philadelphia manages to acquire Kawhi Leonard without stripping away too many helpful role players, the Sixers might push up hard from their No. 2 status as \u201cbest team\u201d even as Joel Embiid challenges Giannis for \u201cbest player.\u201d Shaun Powell :  Best player is Giannis Antetokounmpo by a whisker over Joel Embiid, only because Giannis can play multiple positions. He\u2019ll need to prove he can take the Bucks a bit deeper in the playoffs. A healthy Boston Celtics squad qualifies as the best team, although if the \u201cstar-hunting\u201d Sixers are successful this summer, that could change. John Schuhmann :  Giannis Antetokounmpo and Joel Embiid have the most talent, but in the playoffs, they both got outplayed by the same guy: Al Horford . He doesn\u2019t have the numbers that stand out, but he is the fulcrum on both ends of the floor for what is now the best team in the East. And even with the returns of Gordon Hayward and Kyrie Irving, he will be the Celtics\u2019 most important player next season , because his skill set remains unique on their roster. Maybe Antetokounmpo and\/or Embiid surpass him in the next year, but for now, I\u2019ll go with the guy who just had one heck of a postseason run.  Sekou Smith :  It\u2019s a two-man battle between Giannis Antetokounmpo and Joel Embiid with the \u201cGreek Freak\u201d sitting just a notch above  \u201cThe Process\u201d on my list, due to the limited sample size we have from Embiid. Antetokounmpo has such a high ceiling (as his outside shot continues to improve and his handle evolves) that he could challenge for the title of NBA\u2019s best overall player in the coming years. Embiid could do the same if what we saw from him this season is an indication of what\u2019s to come. As for the best team, I\u2019m going with the Boston Celtics . From coach Brad Stevens to the quality and depth of that roster, they have to be No. 1. They\u2019ve made back-to-back trips to the Eastern Conference finals without anything close to their full complement of (healthy) stars.

I was surprised because George had put in the time for what seemed a heartfelt decision to go home to southern California. He logged an emotional year in OKC while the team he left, the Indiana Pacers, reveled in the return it got for him in trade (Victor Oladipo, Domantas Sabonis). Then the Thunder got bounced in the first round , dragging Carmelo Anthony as near-dead weight. George\u2019s dynamic and friendship with Russell Westbrook apparently trumped any dissatisfaction, though. With the subsequent hysteria over DeMarcus Cousins climbing aboard the Golden State juggernaut , it was a welcome counterbalance that the small-market Thunder hung onto their All-Star sidekick. Shaun Powell :  With all due respect to Boogie Cousins, it\u2019s Trevor Ariza\u2019s reported one-year deal with the Phoenix Suns . Not sure I understand this one from either side. The Suns surrendered a future No. 1 pick belonging to the Miami Heat to get Mikal Bridges and also have Josh Jackson and TJ Warren at small forward. The idea for Phoenix is to develop young players, right? Why, then, do they need a veteran \u2014 and for only one season? Also, doesn\u2019t Ariza want to win at this stage of his career? Yes, he does have one championship ring, but he\u2019s not getting another in Phoenix (which will be lucky just to make the playoffs). John Schuhmann :  I don\u2019t get the Trevor Ariza deal from Ariza\u2019s perspective , from the Suns\u2019 perspective, or from the Houston Rockets\u2019 perspective. I don\u2019t know why he would want to play with the Suns, why the Suns would want him in the way of Josh Jackson and Mikal Bridges on a team that has absolutely no shot of making the playoffs, or why the Rockets would let him get away on a one-year deal. Obviously, their first priorities were\/are bringing back Chris Paul and Clint Capela, but Ariza was a vital piece for that team on both ends of the floor. In regard to the two best teams in the league, the Rockets losing Ariza is more significant than the Warriors adding DeMarcus Cousins.  Sekou Smith :  DeMarcus Cousins to the Warriors for $5.3 million has to qualify as the biggest shocker, so far. We all had a feeling LeBron James would be on the move to Los Angeles as we talked about it all season. And Paul George\u2019s decision was pretty well defined in terms of the options he had between Los Angeles and Oklahoma City. But no one saw Boogie to the Bay coming. The Warriors didn\u2019t even see it coming until Cousins reached out to GM Bob Myers and proposed coming to the two-time defending champions on a one-year deal that gives both sides the ultimate curveball for this wild free agent summer. Biggest surprise?

Yahoo Sports\u2019 Shams Charania has more ( via Twitter ) about the deal \u2014 which was reported by multiple outlets: In his three seasons with the New York Knicks, O\u2019Quinn appeared in 221 of a possible 246 games and was a dependable reserve there. He averaged 6.1 points and 5.2 rebounds per game in 15.3 minutes per game during his time in New York. O\u2019Quinn is entering his seventh NBA season, after spending three with Orlando and three with the Knicks. He averaged a career-high 7.1 points per game last season and has yet to appear in a postseason game. \u2014 July 6, 11:11 a.m. * * * Dallas\u2019 efforts to gear up for a resurgent season reportedly continued on Thursday. According to Shams Charania of Yahoo Sports, the Mavs have come to an agreement on a two-year deal with Australian forward Ryan Broekhoff: The 6-foot-7 forward averaged 12.3 points and 5.5 rebounds per contest for Lokomotiv Kuban of the VTB United League last season, shooting 54.9 percent overall and a scorching 50.6 percent from 3-point range. The Melbourne native and Valparaiso (2009-13) product earned 2018 Euro Cup First Team honors. \u2014 7:10 p.m., July 5 * * * Philadelphia has added to its already deep frontcourt after reportedly agreeing to a deal with former Minnesota Timberwolves swingman Nemanja Bjelica. Per ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski and Jessica Camerato of NBC Sports Philadelphia , the deal is for one year: Last season, Bjelica averaged 6.8 points and 4.1 rebounds per game in 61 games. In March, Bjelica was a starter as Wolves\u2019 star Jimmy recovered from a meniscus injury. In 13 starts that month, Bjelica averaged 11 ppg, 6.8 rpg and shot 43.4 percent from 3-point range. \u2014 9:53 a.m., July 5 * * * Philadelphia 76ers center Amir Johnson has agreed to return to the team on a one-year deal, according to Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN . Johnson played in 74 regular-season games last season with averages of 4.6 points, 4.5 rebounds and 1.6 assists in 15.8 minutes. \u2014 3:30 p.m., July 4 The LA Clippers have been busy in the frontcourt this offseason, trading for Washington Wizards center Marcin Gortat and, shortly thereafter, reportedly letting incumbent center DeAndre Jordan leave for the Dallas Mavericks. Montrezl Harrell appeared in 76 games last year \u2014 mostly in a backup role \u2014 for the Clippers. Per Broderick Turner of the Los Angeles Times , the Clippers are wanting to keep Harrell around : \u2014 10:52 a.m., July 4 * * * Veteran point guard Raymond Felton has agreed to return to Oklahoma City on a one-year, $2.4 million deal, according to ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski.

Felton played in all 82 games as the reserve guard behind Russell Westbrook, averaging 6.9 points and 2.5 assists in 16.6 minutes per game. The 34-year-old is entering his 14th season.

According to The Mercury News \u2018 Mark Medina, Looney had other offers in free agency but chose to stick with the defending NBA champions : On Monday, the Warriors made a splash by agreeing to terms with All-Star center DeMarcus Cousins on a one-year, $5 million deal. Cousins is recovering from an Achilles injury and center JaVale McGee left for the Lakers in free agency, which means Looney is likely to see more minutes. Looney, 22, averaged 4.0 points and 3.3 rebounds in 66 games last season. Golden State\u2019s roster is now set to have 12 players under contract once the moratorium period is over July 6. \u2014 8:27 p.m., July 3 * * * The Utah Jazz are showing they want to keep working with their young talent on the team. Earlier on Tuesday, the team reportedly agreed to an extension with Raul Neto, and now, the team has agreed to an extension for restricted free agent Dante Exum. According to multiple reports, Exum has landed a three-year, $33 million deal. Tony Jones of The Salt Lake Tribune has more on Utah\u2019s latest move of the summer : Exum, who was drafted with fifth overall in the 2014 Draft , missed most of last season with a shoulder injury. However, he showed promise in his last 14 games of the regular season and was solid in key stretches in defending Houston Rockets star James Harden in the Western Conference semifinals. Exum was sacked by injury in that series, picking up a hamstring injury before Game 4 that kept him from playing the rest of the series. Exum, 22, who missed the entire 2015-16 season with a torn ACL, averaged 8.1 points per game in 14 games last season. \u2014 6:09 p.m., July 3 * * * Utah Jazz guard Raul Neto has agreed to a contract extension, according to Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN and Shams Charania of Yahoo!

But today, the point guard has agreed to a one-day with the Indiana Pacers, according multiple reports. J. Michael of the Indianapolis Star has more on why the Pacers reached a deal with up Evans : He had a career resurgence of sorts last season, averaging 19.4 points, 5.1 rebounds and 5.2 assists per game \u2014 stats that were among his best since his early career days with the Sacramento Kings . Aside from talking with the Lakers and Thunder, Will Guillory of The Times-Picayune reported on Monday that the New Orleans Pelicans also may have interest in Evans, too . \u2014 4:02 p.m., July 3 * * * Jeff Green is going back home. The forward, a former star at Maryland\u2019s Northwestern High School and at Georgetown, has reached a one-year with the Washington Wizards, per multiple reports. Candace Buckner of The Washington Post has more on Green\u2019s homecoming to the Washington, D.C., area : Green played for the Cleveland Cavaliers last season and averaged 10.8 points per game. \u2014 3:15 p.m., July 3 * * * Former Kia Rookie of the Year winner Michael Carter-Williams is heading to the Western Conference, it seems. Per multiple reports, Carter-Williams \u2014 who spent last season with the Charlotte Hornets \u2014 has reached a one-year, minimum deal with the Houston Rockets. Jonathan Feigen of the Houston Chronicle has more on the Rockets\u2019 latest offseason move : Carter-Williams went 11th overall in the 2013 NBA Draft, averaging 16.7 points, 6.2 rebounds, 6.3 assists and 1.9 steals per game in 2013-14. However, injuries have hampered him since then and he played in just 52 games for the Hornets last season. He had surgery in mid-March for a torn labrum in his left shoulder and missed the rest of the 2017-18 season. \u2014 2:07 p.m., July 3 * * * As free agency began, DeMarcus Cousins was seen as one of the most intriguing names to watch this summer. However, Cousins tells The Undefeated\u2019s Marc J. Spears that he did not receive offers once free agency officially began at 12:01 a.m. ET Sunday. Cousins was at his offseason home in Las Vegas and up early in the morning yesterday when an idea struck him, Spears writes . \u2014 11:10 a.m., July 3 * * * The Boston Celtics are flush with young talent and have some movable contracts, two things that make them a potential player in just about any free agency scenario. However, when it came time to make a push for big man DeMarcus Cousins, it seems Boston may have simply missed out its chance to truly pursue him. Adam Himmelsbach of The Boston Globe reports ( via Twitter ) that by the time the Celtics started to look into making Cousins an offer, it was too late. Additionally, Chris Mannix of Yahoo Sports reports ( via Twitter ) that the Celtics\u2019 interest in Cousins should not be overstated: The Warriors stunned the NBA world last night by reaching a reported one-year, $5.3 million deal with Cousins . Once Cousins is fully healthy and recovered from his Achilles injury, he would join a Golden State starting lineup that features All-Stars Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson. \u2014 10:47 a.m., July 3 * * * East Player Movement | West Player Movement | Free Agent Tracker"},{"id":39611,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/kings-warriors-summer-league-recap-3","date":"2018-07-04","title":"Game Recap: Warriors 71, Kings 54","content":"By Joel Bartilotta, RotoWire SACRAMENTO, Calif. \u2014 The Golden State Warriors defeated the Sacramento Kings, 71-54, at the California Classic Summer League at Golden 1 Center in Sacramento on Tuesday.

John Collins, Atlanta Hawks With the team\u2019s top draft pick Trae Young struggling to find his shot (he\u2019s 9 for 36 from the field after two games), Collins has been a bright spot for the Hawks. The second-year center from Wake Forest powered his way to 19 points and seven rebounds in 23 minutes against the Spurs, shooting 50 percent from the floor. Jaron Blossomgame, San Antonio Spurs Blossomgame \u2013 who has the perfect name for a developing player \u2013 picked up a double-double, collecting 16 points and 10 rebounds.

Calls to change the system were renewed this week when LeBron James left Cleveland for the Los Angeles Lakers, which could create another strong Western Conference team after Houston and Golden State had the league\u2019s top two records last season. They met in a thrilling West final before the Warriors swept the Cavaliers in the NBA Finals. Commissioner Adam Silver has said ideally there would be a format allowing the two best teams to meet for the title, but has repeatedly expressed concern about the additional travel that would be created if teams were seeded 1 to 16 in the postseason, instead of the current format in which it\u2019s the top eight teams in each conference. \u201cI think, as I\u2019ve said in the past, the obstacle is travel, and it\u2019s not tradition in my mind, at least,\u201d Silver said at the All-Star break . \u201cIt\u2019s that as we\u2019ve added an extra week to the regular season, as we\u2019ve tried to reduce the number of back-to-backs, that we are concerned about teams crisscrossing the country in the first round, for example. We are just concerned about the overall travel that we would have in the top 16 teams.\u201d The league says it averages about 90,000 miles of total travel in the postseason and estimates that would increase to about 130,000. It estimates, based on historical data, an average of 2 + series per year matching teams separated by three time zones before the NBA Finals, with about a 90 percent chance of at least one per season. The WNBA switched its playoff format to the top eight teams instead of by conference in 2016. A 1 to 16 format would likely mean the league would have to balance the schedule so teams played the same amount of games in the regular season against East and West teams, instead of playing more against the teams on its side. That would create about 150,000 additional miles of travel in the regular season, the league estimates, from the 1.4 million miles of total travel in 2017-18. \u201cIt\u2019s still my hope that we\u2019re going to figure out ways,\u201d Silver said. \u201cMaybe ultimately you have to add even more days to the season to spread it out a little bit more to deal with the travel. Maybe air travel will get better.

The center, who has had past issues with technical fouls, reportedly agreed to a one-year deal with the Warriors last night . He is set to join a starting lineup of two-time MVP Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, fresh off his second straight NBA Finals MVP, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green. As free agency began, Cousins was seen as one of the most intriguing names to watch this summer. However, Cousins tells The Undefeated\u2019s Marc J. Spears that he did not receive offers once free agency officially began at 12:01 a.m. ET Sunday. Cousins was at his offseason home in Las Vegas and up early in the morning yesterday when an idea struck him, Spears writes : Cousins\u2019 Pelicans lost to the Warriors in a five-game Western Conference semifinals while Cousins was injured. The 27-year-old Cousins played in New Orleans for coach Alvin Gentry, a top assistant for Steve Kerr when the Golden State won the 2015 championship \u2014 the franchise\u2019s first title in 40 years \u2014 and still a close friend and confidant of Golden State\u2019s head coach. Cousins tore his Achilles in late January and underwent surgery. He has posted regular updates on social media with the hash tags \u201cThe Resurgence\u201d and \u201c0 Doubt.\u201d \u201cI been grinding since a youngin in the trenches this ain\u2019t nothing new to me,\u201d he wrote last month on Twitter. Before his injury in February, Cousins expected to receive a five-year, $150 million contract extension from the Pelicans. Cousins, however, tells Spears that wasn\u2019t the case shortly thereafter : Per Spears, Cousins spoke with several stars on the Warriors about considering a move there, which was more than well received by them: According to the Elias Sports Bureau, the Warriors would be the first team since Boston in 1975-76 to play five All-Stars from the previous season at the same time. That group was Jo Jo White, Charlie Scott, Dave Cowens, Paul Silas and John Havlicek. The Warriors reportedly lost center JaVale McGee on Sunday to the Lakers, who landed LeBron James with a reported $153.3 million, four-year contract as the NBA\u2019s free agency period began. However, in adding Cousins, the Warriors may have added the best center yet into this contending squad they boast. Green, for one, is a huge fan of Cousins. \u201cHe\u2019s incredible. He can score the ball,\u201d Green said in January 2017 at Sacramento when Cousins was still with the Kings. \u201cI think DeMarcus is the best center in the game. A lot of times people don\u2019t give him that credit. A part of it is they try to downplay his status because of his reputation or getting technical fouls or things like that. He is the best big man in the game hands down. It\u2019s always interesting to watch, interesting to play against, interesting to play with, because he\u2019s so incredibly talented.\u201d Just how unlikely was Cousins\u2019 decision? According to Yahoo Sports\u2019 Shams Charania, the Warriors didn\u2019t quite believe he was truly interested in joining them as contact first began. But talks developed rapidly on Monday, with Charania crediting phone calls from Green (on vacation in Greece), coach Steve Kerr and general manager Bob Meyers for sealing an improbable deal almost nobody saw coming.

The second overall pick in this year\u2019s Draft, Bagley hit a hook shot with 1:04 to play to give the Kings a 91-87 lead. Bagley, who had six rebounds and three blocks, then knocked down a free throw for a five-point margin, 92-87. A Frank Mason 3-pointer sealed the deal, as he drilled a 26-foot trey to help put the game out of reach with 22 seconds remaining.

He finished with eight 3s overall, including one from midcourt to beat the halftime buzzer . Jackson, the Big Ten Freshman of the Year and Defensive Player of the Year last season at Michigan State, added three rebounds and two blocked shots to his 29-point total and soundly outplayed Atlanta\u2019s John Collins, who was an All-Rookie second team selection last season. Marvin Bagley III, Sacramento Kings Second-year guard De\u2019Aaron Fox was the Kings\u2019 best all-around player with 23 points, eight rebounds and six assists in their 98-93 victory over the Lakers. But all eyes were on Bagley, and the second pick in this year\u2019s draft impressed with 18 points, six boards and three blocks. Bagley showed a little bit of everything in his Summer League debut, throwing down a huge dunk over fellow rookie Moritz Wagner (23 points), stepping outside to drill a 3-pointer and providing excellent rim protection. Josh Hart, Los Angeles Lakers The Lakers are in desperate need of shooting to support LeBron James, and Hart, coming off a solid rookie season, showed he could be ready help in that department with four 3-pointers en route to 23 points. Spot duty at point guard wasn\u2019t quite as successful, as he offset four assists with five turnovers before being ejected late in the fourth quarter to nullify the Lakers\u2019 comeback hopes.  Georges Niang, Utah Jazz Playing on Utah\u2019s Summer League roster as a restricted free agent, Niang may have helped his cause on Day 1, scoring 17 points in a 92-76 victory over the Spurs. Niang, a second-year pro out of Iowa State, played in only nine games (32 minutes total) for the Jazz last season. But he flashed his shooting touch Monday night, hitting 7 of 12 field goal attempts, including a pair of 3s. Derrick White, San Antonio Spurs The 29th pick for the Spurs in the 2017 draft out of Colorado, White was easily the best player on the floor for San Antonio, scoring 22 points and collecting seven rebounds and six assists in a losing effort. White made 9 of 21 shots, including three 3-pointers, and patiently tried to get his teammates involved on the offensive end. Kobi Simmons, Memphis Grizzlies The former Arizona standout who went undrafted in 2017, Simmons made 8 of 13 shots, including 2 of 3 3-pointers, to finish with 21 points in the Grizzlies\u2019 103-88 win over the Hawks. Simmons, who averaged 15.1 points per game last season in the G League, got going early, hitting seven of his first 10 shots. Derrick Jones Jr., Miami Heat Jones celebrated his first NBA contract, signed on Sunday, with a 24-point, 11-rebound outburst in the Heat\u2019s 79-68 loss to the Warriors. In addition to drilling four 3-pointers in five attempts, Jones threw down a huge slam in the fourth quarter as the Heat tried to mount a late comeback.

Yahoo! Sports\u2019 Shams Charania was the first to report the deal . ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski reports that the deal is for one season at $5.3 million . Cousins himself confirmed the news, too, via a video posted on Showtime Sports\u2019 Twitter account . In the video, Cousins is walking about, talking on his phone and says at the end of his conversation: \u201cI\u2019m a Warrior.\u201d Perhaps most amazingly of all, Cousins alleges that he received \u201cno significant contract offers\u201d after free agency opened on July 1, and initiated contact with the Warriors himself. Cousins is in the midst of recovering from one of the most catastrophic injuries in sports, a ruptured Achilles tendon that ended his second season with the Pelicans at 48 games. He had been averaging 25.1 points, 12.8 rebounds and 5.3 assists alongside fellow All-Star Anthony Davis, putting him in line for a massive contract extension that promptly evaporated. The Warriors, predictably, were thrilled by a move that gives them a player who averaged 25.2 points last season before getting hurt and has averaged 21.5 points and 11 rebounds for his career. \u201cThe 3rd splash Brother,\u201d Curry tweeted . The rest of the league, they didn\u2019t seem so thrilled. Philadelphia\u2019s Richaun Holmes mused on Twitter if the NBA could veto the signing, much in the way then-Commissioner David Stern blocked a Chris Paul trade to the Los Angeles Lakers in 2011. And New York\u2019s Enes Kanter couldn\u2019t resist poking some fun at the league\u2019s current commissioner. \u201cAdam Silver has agreed to a Mid Level Extension with the Golden State, league sources tell ME,\u201d Kanter wrote. Fears about Cousins\u2019 recovery obviously didn\u2019t scare off the Warriors, who were only too happy to add yet another talent for a pittance to a team already heavily favored to win a third straight championship this season. Initial reports had Cousins sitting out until at least December, but he told Spears that he\u2019s shooting to return by training camp in late September. Whenever he does step back on the court, the Warriors will have an almost unprecedented collection of talent featuring two MVPs (Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry), three career 20-point scorers (Durant, Curry, Cousins), another career 19-point scorer (Klay Thompson) and a Defensive Player of the Year (Draymond Green) with 27 All-Star appearances between them, all under the age of 30. According to the Elias Sports Bureau, the Warriors would be the first team since Boston in 1975-76 to play five All-Stars from the previous season at the same time. That group was Jo Jo White, Charlie Scott, Dave Cowens, Paul Silas and John Havlicek. Durant has again reportedly agreed to a two-year deal with a player option to sign a more a lucrative contract next summer, which also provides the Warriors financial flexibility as general manager Bob Myers builds the roster to go after another title. Golden State will play its final season at Oracle Arena in Oakland before a move to new Chase Center in San Francisco\u2019s Mission Bay neighborhood. The Warriors lost center JaVale McGee on Sunday to the Lakers, who landed LeBron James with a $153.3 million, four-year contract as the NBA\u2019s free agency period began.

O\u2019Connell served as the AP\u2019s national college basketball writer since 1987 and was a fixture at major events from the Final Four to the Big East Tournament to the Maui Invitational. \u201cFor more than 30 years at The Associated Press, Jim O\u2019Connell represented the very best in sports journalism. His tireless and unparalleled coverage of college basketball elevated our entire sport,\u201d Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski said. \u201cWe all owe Oc an incredible amount of gratitude for the way he handled himself, the way he covered our game and for the positive impact he had on so many,\u201d he said. Oc covered the Dream Team at the Barcelona Olympics and worked as a desk supervisor, overseeing the entire sports operation for the world\u2019s largest news-gathering organization. In 1982, Oc was the one who pushed the button that told the sports world that tiny Chaminade had beaten No. 1 Virginia and Ralph Sampson in Hawaii, still considered the greatest upset in college basketball history. \u201cHe was the source on college basketball,\u201d said Terry Taylor, the AP\u2019s sports editor from 1992-2013. \u201cHe knew coaches, players, games, dates of games and final scores \u2013 all manner of factoids \u2013 off the top of his head. And when you looked it up, he was always right.\u201d He was a mentor to journalists in the AP and elsewhere. For decades, he coached young reporters in bureaus around the AP on how to cover a game, making sure the play-by-play, the NCAA Tournament implications and the star performances were all put into context. O\u2019Connell built deep relationships with colleagues, players, executives, referees and coaches, including fellow Hall of Famers Jim Calhoun, John Thompson and Lou Carnesecca. \u201cOc and his wife, Annie, were great friends to my wife, Patty, and me when we moved to Long Island to take the job at Hofstra,\u201d said Jay Wright, coach of current NCAA champion Villanova. \u201cOc is the most knowledgeable, ethical, humble college basketball expert ever. He is dependable as a friend and as writer.\u201d A stick boy for the New York Islanders as a teen, O\u2019Connell went to St. John\u2019s and joined the AP\u2019s sports department in the mid-\u201970s, soon turning a part-time job into a career covering a sport he loved. After leaving to become sports information director at Fordham \u2013 where he met his wife, Anne Gregory, the best female basketball player in school history \u2013 Oc returned to the AP in 1978. By 1979, he was boosting the AP\u2019s coverage of the Final Four as Magic Johnson and Larry Bird went head-to-head in Salt Lake City. O\u2019Connell had a long chat about basketball with Bird, who was famously reticent about speaking with the media. It was only when O\u2019Connell pulled out a notepad that the Indiana State star clammed up. O\u2019Connell covered every Final Four from then on, until this year. He kept his Final Four streak alive in 2015, just months after an operation that required partial amputation of his leg. The NCAA made sure O\u2019Connell had a seat at the end of the media table, so he could stretch out his prosthetic. O\u2019Connell was just as knowledgeable about teams like Rider and Wagner as he was about powerhouse programs like Duke and Kentucky. If a fan asked him about any team, he could tell them what he thought of their chances. For decades, if there was a college basketball game in the New York area, Oc would probably be courtside \u2013 whether he was working or not. Oc\u2019s creativity wasn\u2019t solely applied to his writing \u2013 he did delight, though, in a preseason preview he once began with: \u201cIt will be a declaration of independents. \u2026\u201d So much a jokester that he once convinced a colleague in the office that World War III had broken out, Oc could make an entire staff of writers and editors crack up even while on deadline. \u201cPerhaps most importantly, he was beloved by his AP Sports colleagues,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cHe told funny stories like no one else, and he always had one. He lit up the room when he walked in for his night shift.\u201d AP Executive Editor Sally Buzbee said: \u201cOc was a true gentleman: Funny \u2013 sometimes bitingly so, but gentle, calm, and totally dedicated to his craft. He was loved by his colleagues and by people far, far beyond the AP.\u201d Oc was especially popular around March Madness time, when his pals \u2013 even other college basketball experts \u2013 would check in to see if he had a sleeper pick for their pools. For three decades, through Magic-Bird, the birth of the Big East, Coach K\u2019s entire Duke career, to the one-and-done era, whomever made it to the Final Four, Oc was there to see how it ended and to add more stories to his bottomless supply. O\u2019Connell is survived by his wife, Anne; sons James and Andrew; and sisters Winnie and Mary."},{"id":39648,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/brawl-mars-australia-philippines-game-thon-maker-involved","date":"2018-07-02","title":"Brawl mars Australia-Philippines game; Thon Maker involved in scuffle","content":"MANILA, Philippines (AP) \u2014 FIBA has opened disciplinary hearings against Australia and the Philippines after a wild brawl that included Milwaukee Bucks forward Thon Maker broke out in their Basketball World Cup qualifying game Monday.

Reaching a reported four-year deal with LeBron James \u2014 the news of which broke via Twitter by James\u2019 management agency \u2014 will do that for a franchise. Unlike his two previous forays in free agency, James did not drag out his decision and made the announcement less than 24 hours after NBA free agency opened. But how exactly did the Lakers go from contender for James\u2019 services to agreeing to a deal with him? The Los Angeles Times \u2018 Tania Ganguli and Broderick Turner report on how a Saturday meeting between James and Lakers president of basketball operations Magic Johnson helped James make his reported choice: That conversation between Johnson and James were key in this decision James made. But so, too, were ones James had with those close to him, reports Lee Jenkins of Sports Illustrated . Three days after James\u2019 Cleveland Cavaliers faltered in the 2018 Finals , he had a root canal done and was recovering at home in Ohio. While his wife and children were out of town for an AAU tournament, James was at his Ohio mansion pondering his next career move and how to top the champion Golden State Warriors, Jenkins writes. From there, James made a thorough-yet-quick decision in free agency , writes Jenkins: All told, James is saying goodbye to the Cavs for the second time in his career. They drafted the teenage sensation from Akron in 2003 and have to be satisfied with winning just one title in the 11 years they had him. James isn\u2019t planning any more comments and there won\u2019t be a welcoming press conference or celebration in Los Angeles, a person familiar with his plans told The Associated Press on Sunday night on the condition of anonymity. James will make his next public comments on July 30 in Akron when he opens a public school started by his family foundation. The game\u2019s biggest star will now lead a young Lakers team \u2013 run by Johnson, a Hall of Famer and Lakers legend \u2013 that has been overmatched in recent years while rebuilding. But the Lakers will instantly rise with James, a three-time champion who after being swept by the Warriors in this year\u2019s NBA Finals said he is still driven and very much in \u201dchampionship mode.\u201d James and Bryant were Olympic teammates and there has been a perceived rivalry between the pair of alpha males. They\u2019re now linked like never before and if James wants to prepare for his eventual life after basketball, who better to learn from than Johnson, who has made a fortune as a business entrepreneur, or Bryant, an Academy Award winner. The massive Los Angeles market will also provide James with a grander platform for his philanthropy and social activism. He already owns two homes in Southern California and has a film production company. This is the third time in eight years James has changed teams. After bolting from Cleveland in 2010, he returned in an emotional homecoming four years later, determined to make the Cavs champions. The 33-year-old had previously said he wanted to finish his career in Ohio, and although he\u2019s leaving again, Cavs fans are more forgiving after he ended the city\u2019s 52-year sport title drought in 2016. Shortly after the announcement, James posted a three-photo tribute to Cleveland fans on his Instagram account. \u201dThank you Northeast Ohio for an incredible four seasons,\u201d James wrote. \u201dThis will always be home.\u201d Information from The Associated Press was used in this report. * * * East Player Movement | West Player Movement | Free Agent Tracker"},{"id":39670,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nba-free-agency-2018-buzz-july-2-roundup","date":"2018-07-02","title":"NBA Free Agency 2018: July 2 roundup","content":"NBA free agency is officially open for business and, if you missed it, several big deals that were reportedly agreed to throughout Sunday: * LeBron headed to Lakers * Reports: Stephenson going to L.A. * Reports: Caldwell-Pope staying with Lakers * Reports: Gordon to re-sign with Magic * And much more \u2026 As NBA free agency rolls along, keep up on all the latest news and reports from around the league \u2026 * * * Combo guard Avery Bradley will return to the Clippers with a two-year, $25-million contract, per multiple reports. \u2014 1 a.m. * * * No one can accuse the Warriors of resting on their laurels. Already heavily favored to win their third straight championship, they added to their galaxy of stars with a reported one-year, $5.3-million contract agreement with six-time All-Star center DeMarcus Cousins. Yahoo! Sports\u2019 Shams Charania was first to report the blockbuster news, with ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski adding contract details. Via the Showtime Sports Twitter account, Cousins also confirmed the move . Cousins\u2019 hopes for a massive extension were dashed with his ruptured Achilles tendon midway through last season with the Pelicans. With Cousins reportedly receiving no offers after free agency opened on July 1, the door was open for the Warriors to pounce, giving them an eventual starting lineup featuring five All-Stars: Cousins, Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson. Cousins, who averaged 25.2 points, 12.9 rebounds and 5.4 assists last season, isn\u2019t expected back until at least December. But given the Warriors\u2019 wealth of talent and experience, there will be no need to rush their latest free-agent coup. \u2014 9:10 p.m. * * * The rich get richer? Already loaded for bear in the LeBron-free Eastern Conference, the Celtics announced the signing of Philadelphia native Brad Wanamaker from Turkey\u2019s Fenerbahce Ulker. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. A 6-foot-4 guard from the University of Pittsburgh, Wanamaker was named Second Team All-Euroleague after averaging 16.7 points and 4.7 assists during Europe\u2019s premier basketball competition. He also helped Fenerbahce win its third straight Turkish title, earning Finals MVP along the way. \u2014 8:20 p.m. * * * Seth Curry is headed to the Northwest, agreeing to a two-year deal with the Trail Blazers per ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski. Curry averaged 12.8 points for the Mavericks in 2016-17 but missed all of last season with a leg injury. \u2014 8:10 p.m. * * * The Wizards have claimed 6-foot-10 center Thomas Bryant off waivers. Recently released by the Lakers, Bryant played sparingly for the parent club but averaged 19.7 points in 37 appearances for the G League\u2019s South Bay Lakers. \u201cThomas is an intriguing young prospect with size and athleticism who showed he has 3-point range during his time in the G League last season,\u201d Wizards president Ernie Grunfeld said via statement . \u201cHe will be able to continue his development process as he gains experience and works with our staff.\u201d \u2014 7:50 p.m. * * * That didn\u2019t take long. Mere hours after the Lakers renounced Julius Randle to pick up Rajon Rondo, the Pelicans returned fire by agreeing to a reported two-year, $18-million deal with Randle. Per ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski : Wojnarowski also reported that Pelicans star Anthony Davis was integral in coaxing Randle to the Big Easy. Randle, an undersized but active power forward at 6-foot-9, averaged a career-high 16.1 points per game with the Lakers last season, his fourth in the NBA. \u2014 7:30 p.m. * * * The Lakers stayed busy on Monday, reportedly agreeing to a deal with point guard Rajon Rondo, according to Yahoo\u2019s Shams Charania. Rondo returned to a high level of play with the New Orleans Pelicans last season with averages of 8.3 points, 8.2 assists and 4.0 rebounds . To afford Rondo, the Lakers had to renounce the rights to forward Julius Randle, which they did on Monday afternoon, according the ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski: \u2014 5:45 p.m. * * * Mike Scott, who had a breakout season in playing a key role off of the Washington Wizards\u2019 bench, will join the LA Clippers, according to ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski ( via Twitter ): The six-year veteran averaged 8.8 points, shooting 40.5 percent from three-point range in 18.5 minutes during his first season in Washington. The 6-8 forward played his previous five seasons with the Atlanta Hawks. \u2014 4:55 p.m. * * * Free agent point guard Jose Calderon is staying in the Midwest moving on from the Cleveland Cavaliers to the Detroit Pistons, according to ESPN\u2019s Chris Haynes ( via Twitter ): \u2014 4:08 p.m. * * * Derrick Favors has spent eight seasons with the Jazz, playing a key role in Utah\u2019s playoff runs in 2016-17 and \u201917-18. According to reports, the big man will soon make it an even 10 years in Salt Lake City. ESPN\u2019s Marc Spears , The Salt Lake Tribune \u2018s Tony Jones and Yahoo Sports\u2019 Shams Charania report (via Twitter) that Favors has agreed to return to the Jazz. Per Charania and Jones, the sides agreed to a two-year deal: \u2014 3:35 p.m. * * * Anthony Tolliver has agreed to join the Minnesota Timberwolves for a second stint with the franchise, according to Shams Charania of Yahoo! Sports ( via Twitter ). The 6-8 forward played 79 games for the Detroit Pistons, where he averaged 8.9 points and shot 43.6 percent from three-point range. Meanwhile, Minnesota withdrew qualifying offer on Nemanja Bjelica, according to ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski ( via Twitter ): \u2014 3:34 p.m. * * * Free agent Nerlens Noel has agreed to a two-year deal with the Oklahoma City Thunder according to Shams Charania of Yahoo! Sports ( via Twitter ). The 6-11 center, who played only 30 games with the Dallas Mavericks, averaged 4.4 points, 5.6 rebounds in 15.7 minutes. \u2014 3:03 p.m. * * * Few players in the NBA have the track record of scoring in a reserve role that Jamal Crawford has. The 18-year NBA veteran declined his option with the Minnesota Timberwolves weeks ago and is an unrestricted free agent this summer. Crawford may have a suitor in the Eastern Conference, it seems, according to Keith Pompey of Philly.com ( via Twitter ): The Sixers were not able to reach an agreement on a deal with Marco Belinelli, whom Philadelphia added late last season. Belinelli reportedly reached a deal with the San Antonio Spurs shortly after free agency opened. Crawford has won the Kia Sixth Man Award three times in his career and is the reigning Twyman-Stokes Teammate of the Year Award winner . Last season, Crawford averaged 10.3 points and 2.3 assists per game for the Wolves in 80 games \u2014 all of which came in a reserve role. \u2014 2:32 p.m. * * * Before free agency got rolling, the Phoenix Suns waived one young player \u2014 guard Tyler Ulis (a move that didn\u2019t sit well with budding star guard Devin Booker ). After reaching a reported deal with Trevor Ariza in free agency\u2019s opening hours , the Suns have apparently cut another young player. Scott Bordow of The Arizona Republic  reports via Twitter that the Suns are waiving forward\/center Alan Williams . A meniscus injury in his right knee limited Williams to just five games last season, but in the 2016-17 season, Williams played 47 games and averaged 7.4 points and 6.2 rebounds per game. \u2014 1:37 p.m. * * * Guard Tyreke Evans had a career resurgence of sorts last season, averaging 19.4 points, 5.1 rebounds and 5.2 assists per game \u2014 stats that were among his best since his early career days with the Sacramento Kings . The former Memphis Grizzlies guard is an unrestricted free agent and has been linked to several teams, per reports. Chris Haynes of ESPN reports (via Twitter) that Evans will meet with the Los Angeles Lakers today : In addition, Will Guillory of The Times-Picayune reports the New Orleans Pelicans also may have interest in Evans, too. Here\u2019s more from Guillory via Twitter : \u2014 12:29 p.m. * * * As a team on the rise in the Eastern Conference, the Philadelphia 76ers boast impressive youngsters in Ben Simmons, Dario Saric, Joel Embiid and Robert Covington. However, their first reported move of free agency was one to keep one of their veterans \u2014 sharp-shooting guard J.J. Redick. According to ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski, Redick has agreed to stay with the 76ers on a one-year deal : The deal was also reported via Twitter by Keith Pompey of Philly.com . Last summer, the Sixers added Redick on a one-year deal as well. He was a valuable piece for Philadelphia as it ended a five-year playoff drought last season. Redick averaged a career-best 17.1 points per game while shooting 42 percent on 3-pointers. His addition helped the Sixers finish 12th in 3-pointers made last season . \u2014 12:13 p.m. * * * The Los Angeles Lakers had themselves quite a Sunday, reaching reported agreements on deals with LeBron James, Kentavious Caldwell Pope, JaVale McGee and Lance Stephenson . While those players are all seemingly headed for L.A., one of the Lakers\u2019 key free agents is awaiting a deal from the team. Forward Julius Randle, a restricted free agent, has yet to receive an offer from the Lakers. But Yahoo Sports\u2019 Shams Charania reports via Twitter that tthe Lakers are hopeful they can keep Randle around . Randle is still just 23 years old and developed into a pretty efficient scorer in the final year of his rookie deal. Among 126 players with at least 500 field goal attempts in each of the last two seasons, he saw the fifth biggest increase in true shooting percentage ( from 54 percent to 61 percent ). \u2014 11:45 a.m. * * * The Utah Jazz have reportedly met with power forward Derrick Favors to try and keep him in town. Now, they await his decision. Favors has spent eight seasons with the Jazz, playing a key role in Utah\u2019s playoff runs in 2016-17 and \u201917-18. He averaged 12.3 points, 7.2 rebounds and 1.1 blocks per game last season, all improvements for him after his production dipped slightly in \u201916-17. The Deseret News \u2018 Eric Woodyard reports the Jazz are now waiting to see what Favors will decide as an unrestricted free agent . \u2014 10:51 a.m. * * * Don\u2019t expect to hear much, if anything, from LeBron James until sometime at the end of this month. That\u2019s the word from those in the know after James\u2019 agent announced yesterday that his client agreed to a deal with the Los Angeles Lakers . Many will wonder between now and then how James and his new team will fit together and so forth on the court. There\u2019s also the question of which jersey number James might wear next season. He wore No. 23 in his two stints with the Cleveland Cavaliers (2004-10 and 2015-present) and wore No. 6 during his Miami Heat days (2011-14). ESPN\u2019s Darren Rovell did some sleuthing around the Fanatics.com web site and found James may likely wear No. 23 come 2018-19 in Los Angeles. Here\u2019s what Rovell reports (via Twitter) : \u2014 10:35 a.m. * * * Last season, the Utah Jazz emerged as the season wore on, amassing an 18-6 record after the All-Star break and upsetting the star-laden Oklahoma City Thunder in the first round of the playoffs. The Jazz did all this without defensive swingman Thabo Sefolosha, who was lost for the season in mid-January to knee surgery . Sefolosha had a non-guaranteed contract for 2018-19, but it appears the Jazz are bringing him back for another run at things. Tony Jones of The Salt Lake Tribune reports via Twitter that Sefolosha was not waived yesterday, thus guaranteeing his deal : Sefolosha took to Twitter shortly thereafter himself to celebrate the news : \u2014 10:10 a.m. * * * The Los Angeles Lakers, as of last night, have reason to be excited about their future. Reaching a reported four-year deal with LeBron James \u2014 the news of which broke via Twitter by James\u2019 management agency \u2014 will do that for a franchise. Unlike his two previous forays in free agency, James did not drag out his decision and made the announcement less than 24 hours after NBA free agency opened.

In 2017-18, he led the Suns in scoring (24.9 points per game) and was among the league-leaders in 3-pointers made and 3-point percentage . Those kinds of stats and development make him a player Phoenix wants to build around. As such, the Suns are reportedly talking with his agent about a rookie extension, reports ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski (via Twitter) : The Suns were active on the first day of free agency, reaching a reported agreement with former Houston Rockets forward Trevor Ariza . Phoenix also boasts the No. 1 pick in the 2018 Draft, Deandre Ayton , as part of a burgeoning young core it is building around. \u2014 8:38 a.m. * * * The Golden State Warriors, like the rest of the NBA world, watched as unrestricted free agent LeBron James reportedly reached a deal to join the Los Angeles Lakers . In addition to that, the defending-champion Warriors also saw their own free-agent big man, JaVale McGee, reportedly head to the Lakers, too . While McGee\u2019s departure isn\u2019t a back-breaker for the Warriors, that and the Lakers\u2019 restocking has Golden State aware it can\u2019t simply stand pat in the Western Conference.

Which is to say, the Cavaliers will be just fine going forward as long as they snag the No. 1 overall pick in the Draft three times in the next four years and then lure James back home for a third stint in the wine and gold. Failing any or all of that? It\u2019s strictly uncharted. Possibly unimaginable. The news Sunday that James \u2013 arguably the NBA\u2019s best player and once again its most significant free agent \u2013 had agreed to sign a four-year, $154 million deal with the Los Angeles Lakers immediately had the Cavaliers and their fans looking forward and backward. Forward to the great unknown of their short- and long-term futures, heading into the NBA wilderness without their MVP, their perennial All-Star and the iconic Finals frequenter who ranks as the greatest player in franchise history. And backward, too, not just to the most successful four-season run in Cavs history but to the four years that preceded that. Those seasons are the ones that serve now as a model for how to survive and recover from what they\u2019re suddenly facing. Or, maybe, as a cautionary tale for not tempting fate like this more than once. In hindsight, what Cleveland went through the first time James left in 2010 wasn\u2019t so bad at all. Sure, the Cavaliers went subterranean, winning only 19, 21, 24, and 33 games in the four years he was in Miami, on the heels of amassing 50, 45, 66 and 61 victories with deep playoff runs in the four years immediately before that. But the Cavs\u2019 rebuilding plan got traction almost instantly, with a roster of mismatched toys feeble enough to deliver Kyrie Irving as the first pick in the 2011 draft. A year later Anthony Bennett arrived via the No. 1 pick \u2013 hey, Cleveland at least got the right to select first, even if it whiffed \u2013 and Andrew Wiggins was nabbed first overall in 2014. Tristan Thompson showed up with Irving, the point guard who quickly established himself as one of the league\u2019s most explosive, creative scorers and an All-Star MVP. After James abruptly signed back with Cleveland in 2014, the Cavs packaged Wiggins and Bennett to Minnesota for All-Star forward Kevin Love to form a new Big Three. The result, after considerable tweaking around the edges: A squad that won 53, 57, 51 and 50 games from 2015 to last season, even as it shifted focus to the playoffs for four consecutive runs to The Finals. In 2016, it all came together for the NBA title, the Cavaliers becoming the first Finals team to overcome a 3-1 deficit in the championship round. Bigger than that, James & Co. ended Cleveland\u2019s title drought that stretched back to the NFL Browns\u2019 last title in 1964. The resurgence was so complete, so satisfying, that had Cavs fans been offered this deal at the outset \u2013 LeBron is going to leave for four years and win two titles with another team, but ultimately will return to Cleveland for four Finals appearances and a championship \u2013 most happily would have taken it. No one had that vision then, of course, and no one knows what the Cavaliers are facing now. Irving is gone, having force a trade to Boston last summer to set in motion this whole LeBron-less scenario. Love remains, still an All-Star, his full potential available to be unleashed now that he\u2019s no longer cast as a sidekick or a third option. The roster is clogged with role players \u2013 Thompson, George Hill, J.R. Smith, Kyle Korver, Jordan Clarkson \u2013 who look like the Jackson 5 minus Michael, with salaries that crept higher in the fat Finals times and now mostly seem burdensome. So the question is, do the Cavaliers try to make it back to the playoffs for a fifth consecutive time, their first without James since 1998? Or do they go all-in on another rebuild, trying to catch lottery lightning in a bottle again for a fan base that skirted the down times faced by teams such as Minnesota or Sacramento? Keep in mind, the Cavaliers traded their 2019 first-round pick \u2013 with top-10 protection \u2013 to Atlanta in the deal that brought Korver aboard in January 2017. If they decide to push toward a playoff spot and make it, or miss by a few slots, they\u2019ll forfeit the pick. The same protections apply in 2020. Owner Dan Gilbert privately is said to be OK moving into this post-LeBron era \u2013 especially since he won\u2019t be the one paying James that $154 million \u2013 and might want to keep the playoff streak alive. The odds of securing such elite draft position again, repeatedly, are slim. And the rules of the lottery have changed, making more elusive the reward for teams that tank. Trading Love, who has the most market value of the Cavs\u2019 veterans, for another overhaul would bring some payroll and luxury tax relief. But it might send the team into a lottery spiral that lasts far longer this time. The alternative, though, is to chase mediocrity, to get stuck in the teens where first-round picks talented enough to change the franchise\u2019s fortunes are rare and to slide slowly backward in the Eastern Conference.

That\u2019s why he\u2019s going to the Los Angeles Lakers. It\u2019s time, you see. LeBron James left the Cleveland Cavaliers for the Miami Heat in 2010 because hooking up with Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh presented his best chance to finally win a championship. He returned to the Cavs four years later to fulfill a broken promise and give Cleveland the chance to throw the world\u2019s happiest block party when that suffering city finally snapped its 52-year professional sports championship spell, making him a civic immortal in the process. And now the four-time MVP and 14-time All-Star is headed to the Lakers , the tinsel franchise, and this choice is equal parts personal and professional. This is the city where his iconic basketball career will most likely end and his post-career will begin. This is where he can play for a man he respects, Magic Johnson, and on a team that can be built into a beast. This is where his family enjoys living and his teenaged son, Bronny, can become engaged in the competitive Southern California prep basketball scene. This is where LeBron, who has a film production company, can gain a firmer foothold in the entertainment business, which by all accounts is where he wants to make his next fortune. Yes, it\u2019s time, for LeBron and obviously the Lakers, and this sense of clockwork just might work out tremendously for both. Their paths were careening towards a welcome collision that shook the NBA Sunday when LeBron announced he will sign a free agent deal with the Lakers. And not a short-term deal, either, as he did in Miami and throughout his second tour with the Cavs. No, LeBron is locked in for four years, and that means he\u2019s willing to give Magic enough time to stitch together a good enough squad to make the Golden State Warriors twitchy. He joins a bunch of green bananas that\u2019s not quite ready for June \u2026 but wait another 15 minutes because Magic isn\u2019t done yet. The Lakers missed out on Paul George , who announced plans to re-sign with Oklahoma City. And Chris Paul, best buds with LeBron, took the Rockets\u2019 money and stayed put . But there\u2019s enough salary cap flex and assets to re-arrange the furniture overnight if the Lakers choose. They\u2019re still in the sweepstakes for disgruntled star and LA-native Kawhi Leonard and have interest in signing free agent center DeMarcus Cousins. If neither of those options are in play this year, Magic seems more than willing to keep his young team intact and wait until the summer of 2019. Why the patience? Well, Leonard will be an unrestricted free agent then, if he doesn\u2019t have a change of heart and signs a contract extension with San Antonio (or wherever he spends the 2018-19 season). There\u2019s Jimmy Butler and Kemba Walker ready to reach the marketplace. Also, Klay Thompson, whose father Mychal draws a Laker paycheck as a team broadcaster, hits free agency next summer, and signing him would weaken the Warriors in the process. Anyway, who knows, maybe Kyle Kuzma or Brandon Ingram or Lonzo Ball (or Julius Randle if he re-signs) will by then develop into potential stars or important pieces on a contender. What\u2019s great about the Lakers\u2019 situation is they have options, and most are good and promising, and half of their problems are already solved because they have LeBron, a licensed one-man NBA Finals hauling crew. It says plenty about Magic and owner Jeanie Buss that LeBron found the Lakers intriguing enough to leave Cleveland and sign up. When Buss assumed controlling interest of the franchise three years ago, she sought Magic\u2019s counsel and then hired him to run the basketball operations. It was a solid match, these old friends, with Jeanie Buss providing the necessary resources to polish a franchise gone stale, and Magic radiating with appeal and still carrying clout among potential free agents. He promised Buss that the necessary steps would be taken to develop stars and acquire stars, something the Lakers have done habitually and brilliantly in their history and especially under the late Jerry Buss. This is where Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Shaquille O\u2019Neal arrived and tasted success, and where Jerry West and Kobe Bryant spent their entire careers. No question, Jeanie Buss and Magic Johnson sold all that glam to LeBron. They probably all but promised him a statue outside the crowded Staples Center entrance and the chance to have a third jersey retired (after Cleveland and Miami eventually do what\u2019s right and expected). On Sunday, the first day of free agency, Magic was at LeBron\u2019s home in LA, no doubt in full charming mode. Although that probably wasn\u2019t terribly necessary. As a student of the game with an appreciation for history, LeBron already had a measure of admiration for Magic the player. But it was Magic the executive who sealed LeBron\u2019s signature by moving mountains in a matter of mere months on the job. Magic cleared the salary cap of lead poison (with only Luol Deng\u2019s remaining $38 million clunker left) while loading up on percolating young talent in Ingram, Kuzma, Ball and Josh Hart. The blueprint to fetch LeBron was done quickly, early and smoothly, allowing the Lakers to improve from within and beyond. When you consider the entire enthralling package \u2014 on-hand talent and room to add another A-list player or two, and star-struck Hollywood heavyweights sitting courtside and willing to do business with the game\u2019s best player \u2014 it just seemed the right move for LeBron at the right time. If you wish to cast a wary eye at an all-time great who\u2019s on the move once again, at least applaud him for taking the harder road this time. He could\u2019ve remained in the Easy East and joined the up-and-coming Sixers or stayed in Cleveland and made a ninth consecutive run for the Finals. Instead, he\u2019s venturing West and just down the street from the Warriors, and doing it \u2014 at the moment, anyway \u2014 without a fellow superstar riding shotgun. And there\u2019s risk. He brings 15 seasons of heavy wear from deep runs into June at a high level. He\u2019ll turn 34 next season; while LeBron was brilliant at age 33, sometimes Father Time comes knocking without warning or compassion. In that sense, he\u2019s on the clock, and the closer he creeps to the last year of that contract, the more help he\u2019ll need to keep playing into June. Regardless where and how far he goes yearly with the Lakers, LeBron stressed how much his family would have a major voice in his next stop. The move to Miami was mainly selfish. The return to Cleveland was more out of a sense of duty and to gain a measure of public acceptance. Here, the family weighs in. They love the lifestyle and obvious advantages of being in LA. This was a group decision after a huddle. Plus, it\u2019s not lost on LeBron how Magic became a corporation after retirement, thanks to powerful LA connections. LeBron wants to produce movies and documentaries and be on the forefront of a changing entertainment landscape. He can now rub the same shoulders as he begins to build an empire that\u2019s heavily influenced by Hollywood and technology. So this feels right, seems right for LeBron James, who\u2019ll likely hold multiple major NBA career records and basketball achievements before he\u2019s done. This move represents a twist to his legacy, an opportunity to align himself among the long line of Laker greats and a win-win for his family and business interests. It\u2019s his final basketball lap which he hopes turns into a victory lap. It\u2019s the right place, right time and right team for yet another superstar who\u2019s just right for the Lakers. * * * Veteran NBA writer Shaun Powell has worked for newspapers and other publications for more than 25 years.

The Los Angeles Lakers have a new superstar \u2013 L.A.-Bron. The four-time NBA MVP announced Sunday night that he has agreed to a four-year, $154 million contract with the Lakers, joining one of the league\u2019s most storied franchises and switching conferences to try and dethrone the Golden State Warriors and grow his own legacy. According to ESPN\u2019s Brian Windhorst, the fourth year in James\u2019 deal is a player option . For the second time in his career, James is saying goodbye to the Cleveland Cavaliers, who drafted the teenage sensation from Akron in 2003 and have to be satisfied with winning just one title in the 11 years they had him. Unlike his two previous forays in free agency, James did not drag out his decision and made the announcement less than 24 hours after NBA free agency opened. This Summer of LeBron was barely a fling. His management agency, Klutch Sports Group, announced his agreement with the Lakers with a simple, short release. It was a stark contrast from eight years ago, when a poorly conceived TV special to announce his departure from Cleveland backfired and damaged James\u2019 image. ESPN reports Paul called Lakers president of basketball operations Magic Johnson minutes before he sent the announcement tweet. Paul then called Cavs general manager Koby Altman as soon as he got off the phone with Johnson. James isn\u2019t planning any more comments and there won\u2019t be a welcoming press conference or celebration in Los Angeles, a person familiar with his plans told The Associated Press on Sunday night on the condition of anonymity. James will make his next public comments on July 30 in Akron when he opens a public school started by his family foundation. It was all different this time. The game\u2019s biggest star will now lead a young Lakers team \u2013 run by Johnson, a Hall of Famer and Lakers legend \u2013 that has been overmatched in recent years while rebuilding. But the Lakers will instantly rise with James, a three-time champion who after being swept by the Warriors in this year\u2019s NBA Finals said he is still driven and very much in \u201dchampionship mode.\u201d In reaching this deal to leave the Cavs, James becomes the first player in NBA history to lead a playoffs in scoring and switch teams the following offseason. The Lakers\u2019 rich legacy is something that appealed to James and it wasn\u2019t long after his announcement that he heard from Kobe Bryant, who won five titles during 20 seasons with Los Angeles. James and Bryant were Olympic teammates and there has been a perceived rivalry between the pair of alpha males. They\u2019re now linked like never before and if James wants to prepare for his eventual life after basketball, who better to learn from than Johnson, who has made a fortune as a business entrepreneur, or Bryant, an Academy Award winner. The massive Los Angeles market will also provide James with a grander platform for his philanthropy and social activism. He already owns two homes in Southern California and has a film production company. This is the third time in eight years James has changed teams. After bolting from Cleveland in 2010, he returned in an emotional homecoming four years later, determined to make the Cavs champions. The 33-year-old had previously said he wanted to finish his career in Ohio, and although he\u2019s leaving again, Cavs fans are more forgiving after he ended the city\u2019s 52-year sport title drought in 2016. Shortly after the announcement, which came in a surprising manner, James posted a three-photo tribute to Cleveland fans on his Instagram account. \u201dThank you Northeast Ohio for an incredible four seasons,\u201d James wrote. \u201dThis will always be home.\u201d In contrast to James\u2019 previous departure, to which he responded with an angry missive, Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert lauded James for leading the team to its first championship. \u201c LeBron, you came home and delivered the ultimate goal,\u201d he said via statement . \u201cNothing but appreciation and gratitude for everything you put into every moment you spent in a Cavaliers uniform. We look forward to the retirement of the famous #23 Cavs jersey one day down the line.\u201d But there will always be a portion of Cleveland fans disappointed that James left again and that he wouldn\u2019t give the Cavs a longer commitment. His deal with the Lakers is his longest since he signed for six years with Miami in 2010. James informed the Cavs on Friday that he was not exercising his $35.6 million option and becoming a free agent. While in Los Angeles following a family vacation, he spoke to Altman moments after free agency opened on Sunday , and it appears that was more a courtesy than a chance for Cleveland to make one last pitch. Cleveland\u2019s roster was exposed during this year\u2019s finals, and James may not have seen a way for it to improve enough to win a fourth title. The decision to join the Lakers was not a surprise to his innermost circle, with one person telling AP that it had been presumed for some time that he was headed to Los Angeles next season. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because no one authorized that detail be released publicly. James gave Cleveland something to remember in his final season. He played in all 82 regular-season games and then somehow carried a team that underwent several transformations to a fourth straight conference title and matchup against the Warriors. As has been the case in the past, James didn\u2019t have enough help as the Cavs were swept, dropping him to 3-6 in the NBA Finals \u2013 a record sometimes used to compare him to Michael Jordan. His stay with the Cavaliers will best be remembered for 2016, when he rallied the Cavs from a 3-1 deficit in the finals to stun the Warriors. James helped seal a Game 7 win with a chase-down block of Andre Iguodala, the signature moment of a career that has shown no signs of decay. With the Lakers, James will be playing in the Western Conference for the first time and just down the Pacific Coast Highway from the Warriors, the team that has stymied him three times in the past four finals. The chance to play for one of America\u2019s most storied franchises is a new challenge for James, who prides himself on knowing the game\u2019s history. In Los Angeles, championships are the standard and he\u2019ll feel new pressure in upholding the legacies of Johnson, Bryant, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Jerry West and other Lakers greats. It\u2019s now his turn.

Months later, Booker is reportedly angry at the Suns for failing to do just that. According to Shams Charania of Yahoo Sports, Booker is displeased that Phoenix released his friend and former college teammate Tyler Ulis without communicating the move to him. Bordow later confirmed the report, writing : Phoenix drafted Ulis in 2016 with the 34th overall pick, and he averaged 7.3 points and 3.7 assists per game in 2016-17. Offseason ankle surgery affected the start to his second NBA season and, eventually, the Suns had to rely on stop-gap solutions at the point in 2017-18. The Suns will reportedly use most of their cap space on Houston Rockets free agent Trevor Ariza, who came to terms with Phoenix on a one-year deal early Sunday morning. Booker is eligible this summer for a maximum contract extension worth more than $150 million, which Bordow indicates Booker would likely still sign despite his anger about Ulis\u2019 release.

According to multiple reports, representatives from the team will meet Sunday with James\u2019 agent Rich Paul in Los Angeles. James, however, will not be at this meeting. Here\u2019s more from ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski on the meeting and what looms ahead for James and the Sixers: For the Sixers to land James, they would have to pull off some creative work with their roster to create the salary cap space needed to add him, writes Joe Vardon of Cleveland.com : Any notion, though, that this meeting between James\u2019 representatives and the Sixers is being done as a favor should perhaps be dispelled. Keith Pompey of Philly.com reports that James has real interest in joining up with Philadelphia : The New York Times \u2018 Marc Stein reports ( via Twitter ) the Sixers believe they still have a real chance, as well, to land the disgruntled Leonard. According to The Associated Press\u2019 Tom Withers and ESPN\u2019s Dave McMenamin, the Cleveland Cavaliers spoke with James when NBA free agency opened at 12:01 ET Sunday . According to the reports, Cavs general manager Koby Altman spoke on the phone to both James and his agent Rich Paul. Per Vardon, a source close to James said James would not be involved in any of these initial meetings with teams. While there was a feverish flurry of activity involving big-named players in the opening hour of what has been billed as the Summer of LeBron, James did not announce where he\u2019ll play next season and it\u2019s not known if other moves, such as Paul George staying in Oklahoma City and Chris Paul staying in Houston , have affected his thinking. The Sixers can offer James a chance to play alongside budding, young stars Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid as well as stay in the Eastern Conference, where the path to the NBA Finals is far easier than out West. Philadelphia hasn\u2019t hid its desire to land James, a three-time champion who would instantly make the club a championship contender. Earlier this season, James was flattered when a Pennsylvania company paid for three billboards in Ohio urging James to come to Philadelphia, where the club has been abiding by a \u201cTrust The Process\u201d mantra while rebuilding. James isn\u2019t expected to drag his choice out over several days. He knows what he wants and he\u2019s very familiar with the Cavaliers after leading them to four straight NBA Finals since returning as a free agent in 2014 following four seasons in Miami. Because they own his \u201cBird rights\u201d the Cavs can offer James more money than any other team \u2013 a five-year, $207 million deal. But the 33-year-old has interests beyond basketball and the massive Los Angeles market would give him a bigger stage and platform. The Lakers have a young, talented but inexperienced roster and they were hoping to land both James and possibly George. But the All-Star forward opted to stick with the Thunder and will sign a four-year deal when teams are permitted to finalize contracts on June 6. George\u2019s choice could sway James to sign a short-term deal with Cleveland, but the Lakers are determined to get their hands on the four-time MVP. The Cavs, on the other hand, have been mostly operating in the dark. While there had been dialogue between Paul and Altman since the season ended, James had not given the team any sense of his plans. That\u2019s made it tough for Cleveland to upgrade its roster, but the Cavs remain committed to bringing back James even for just one more year. On Friday, James formally became a free agent when he informed the Cavs he would not exercise his $35.6 million contract option for next season, making him an unrestricted free agent and the prize catch in the 2018 class. Now that some of the early dust has settled, the battle for him appears to be down to two teams: Cleveland vs. Los Angeles. Home vs. Hollywood. Wine-and-gold vs. Purple-and-gold. But while the Cavs and Lakers appear to be the front-runners for James, the Sixers aren\u2019t ready to give up the fight. Well, at least young and outspoken center Embiid isn\u2019t. Embiid posted a message on Twitter that seemed to be directed at No. 23 and what it might be like to walk in the footsteps of Lakers legends like Johnson, Kobe Bryant, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Wilt Chamberlain, Jerry West and Shaquille O\u2019Neal. \u201cThe Lakers are FOREVER gonna be Kobe\u2019s and Magic\u2019s team,\u201d Embiid wrote, referring to Kobe Bryant and Johnson. \u201cProcess that.\u201d George\u2019s move has given James more to process, but the chance to restore Los Angeles to prominence may be just what he needs at this point in his career. And while he has long been compared to Michael Jordan, Johnson is the one whose game more closely resembles his own. For now, though, he\u2019s not attached to anyone.

All three leagues run separately, and the bulk of the games will be played in Las Vegas \u2013 where, for the first time, all 30 NBA franchises will be sending squads. \u201cIt\u2019s become the center of basketball in the month of July,\u201d Vandeweghe said. The scores will likely soon be forgotten \u2013 such is the nature of summer league \u2013 but the challenge experiment will be followed closely by just about everyone involved, especially the league\u2019s competition committee that will ultimately decide if the twist comes to the NBA in the future. Among the plays that coaches will be able to challenge: if a basket or foul occurred before the shot clock expired, who the ball went off when it\u2019s out of bounds, if a foul meets clear-path criteria, if goaltending or basket interference was properly called, and if a player was in the act of shooting when fouled. Coaches will also be able to challenge if a player was in the restricted area on block-charge calls, such as the one in Game 1 of the NBA Finals where Golden State\u2019s Kevin Durant and Cleveland\u2019s LeBron James collided in the lane at a very pivotal moment in that series. Referees will be the only ones who can initiate a review of potentially flagrant fouls and end-of-period situations. In the last 2 minutes of regulation, only referees can seek review to check if a shot was a 2- or 3-pointer, and if a shot hit the rim and whether the shot clock should be therefore adjusted. \u201cYou see the level of competitiveness that\u2019s at these summer leagues,\u201d the Los Angeles Lakers\u2019 Josh Hart said. \u201cGuys dream about making it to the NBA and when they get out there, every possession, you have to go hard or you\u2019re going to get exposed.\u201d Here\u2019s some more of what to know about summer league: The Kings decided this year to add a summer league at their Golden 1 Arena, and will be playing host to Miami, Golden State and the Lakers. Games in Utah will feature the Jazz, San Antonio, Atlanta and Memphis. ESPN and NBA TV will also be experimenting in Las Vegas. ESPN will be using a SkyCam for all games, including two where the overhead view will be considered the main camera angle on the broadcast. There will also be a \u201cvertical view\u201d production for two games that will be shown internationally, a move the NBA decided to utilize based on research among viewers in China. Players get 10 fouls before fouling out in summer league games, until the playoff portion begins in Las Vegas and the rule reverts to the conventional six-and-you\u2019re-out. Quarters last 10 minutes, overtime is 2 minutes and in some games there will be a first-point-wins rule if a second OT is required. No. 1 pick Deandre Ayton could make his debut on Friday at 9:30 p.m. EDT, when the Phoenix Suns take on the Dallas Mavericks. Sacramento and Utah will not have playoffs in their short leagues. The NBA Summer League in Las Vegas will crown a champion on July 17."},{"id":39702,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/reports-derrick-rose-agrees-deal-minnesota-timberwolves","date":"2018-07-01","title":"Reports: Derrick Rose agrees to one-year deal with Minnesota Timberwolves","content":" Derrick Rose\u2019s reunion tour with coach Tom Thibodeau will apparently continue.

However, the Cleveland Cavaliers have apparently made it known early on they want their superstar forward to stay with them going forward. According to The Associated Press\u2019 Tom Withers and ESPN\u2019s Dave McMenamin, the Cavaliers spoke with James when NBA free agency opened at 12:01 ET Sunday. According to the reports, Cavs general manager Koby Altman spoke on the phone to both James and his agent Rich Paul. Multiple reports surfaced on Sunday as well that the Philadelphia 76ers are meeting with LeBron James\u2019 representatives today in Los Angeles. James, however, will not be in this meeting. James is an unrestricted free agent and the Cavs are hoping to re-sign the three-time champion, who is weighing whether to change teams for the third time in eight years. James is also being pursued by the Los Angeles Lakers, who have enough salary-cap space to sign him and another star player. There was a flurry of big-name signings in the first hours of free agency, but James remained noncommittal.

Keep up on all the latest news and reports from Day 1 of free agency below: * George verbally commits to Thunder * Reports: James, Cavs spoke at 12:01 a.m. ET * Jordan, Mavs reportedly agree to deal * Reports: Durant to re-sign with Warriors * Reports: Paul, Rockets reach four-year deal More Free Agent roundup:  July 1 * * * After reportedly coming to terms with Chris Paul and losing Trevor Ariza to the Phoenix Suns, Houston will try to keep another key piece of its Western Conference Finals team later on Sunday. According to ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski (via Twitter), the Rockets will meet with restricted free agent Clint Capela: Capela was a vital part of Houston\u2019s record-breaking offense in 2017-18, serving as the ultimate roll man after setting screens for James Harden and Chris Paul. The former 25th overall pick averaged 13.9 points, 10.8 rebounds and 1.9 blocks per contest in his fourth season in the league. Still just 24 years old, Capela could very well improve over the length of his next NBA contract. With that in mind, the Rockets appear intent on keeping him in Houston for the foreseeable future. \u2014 3:22 a.m. * * * According to ESPN\u2019s Dave McMemanim, LeBron James and his agent spoke with the Cavaliers right as the free agency period opened . However, it appears unclear if LeBron and the Cavs\u2019 brass will meet face-to-face during the free agency period: James declined his player option for the 2018-19 season on Friday. The three-time champion is now the most coveted prize in an NBA free-agent class . The decision to decline the option for 2018-19 was expected by James because it gives him more options, which includes him re-signing with the Cavs, who can offer him a five-year, $209 million contract. James can also sign a short-term deal with Cleveland, something he has done each year since returning in 2014. In 2010, he bolted for Miami and spent four seasons with the Heat , winning two titles, before returning home to Northeast Ohio \u2014 2:25 a.m. * * * At the start of free agency, there are reportedly at least two teams heavily interested in DeMarcus Cousins. Marc J. Spears of ESPN\u2019s The Undefeated reports that Cousins took phone calls from his current team \u2014 the New Orleans Pelicans \u2014 and the Los Angeles Lakers. Says Spears : With Paul George reportedly ready to re-sign with Oklahoma City, the Lakers appear to be shifting their offseason focus to other free agent talent. Kevin O\u2019Connor of The Ringer reported on Saturday that DeMarcus Cousins could be one such option for the Lakers. The four-time All-Star is coming off a torn Achilles, but at just 27 years old could be entering his prime if he returns healthy. Says O\u2019Connor on Twitter : The Lakers have been connected with the biggest available names leading up to the start of free agency on Sunday, including George and LeBron James. They have also reportedly been in talks with San Antonio to acquire two-time Kia Defensive Player of the Year Kawhi Leonard. Los Angeles is hoping to inject several All-NBA talents with the hope of lifting the franchise from a five-year postseason absence, the longest in team history. New Orleans, meanwhile, appears intent on testing the feasibility of keeping Cousins paired with All-NBA big man Anthony Davis. The duo appeared to be verging on consistent chemistry when Cousins went down with a torn Achilles in a January game against Houston. The 6-foot-11 center was averaging 25.2 points, 12.9 rebounds, 5.4 assists, 1.6 steals and 1.6 blocks per contest through 48 games in his first full season with the Pelicans. \u2014 2:11 p.m. After snapping a 13-year playoff drought, Minnesota is all too eager to keep its core intact. According to Marc Stein of The New York Times , the Timberwolves hope to ink Jimmy Butler to a maximum four-year contract this offseason. Stein tweeted : Butler is coming off his fourth consecutive All-Star season and his first with the Timberwolves. Minnesota acquired the 6-foot-8 swingman last summer in exchange for Zach LaVine, Kris Dunn and First Team All-Rookie forward Lauri Markkanen. Butler immediately sparked the young Timberwolves to a 47-win season while averaging 22.2 points, 5.3 rebounds, 4.9 assists and 2.0 steals per contest. Along with Karl-Anthony Towns, Butler was also Minnesota\u2019s first All-Star since Kevin Love in 2014. \u2014 1:55 a.m. * * * The Denver Nuggets have designs on making the playoffs in 2018-19 and want to make that run with the core group of players they had last season. Per ESPN\u2019s Chris Haynes, the Nuggets and guard Will Barton have agreed to a four-year, $54 million deal. This deal comes shortly after reports that the Nuggets and big man Nikola Jokic are closing in on a max extension. Here\u2019s more from Haynes on Barton\u2019s deal : In 2017-18, Barton averaged career highs in scoring (15.7 points per game), assists (4.1 assists per game), field goal percentage (45.2 percent) and 3-point percentage (37 percent).. \u2014 1:39 a.m. * * * After showing he still has plenty of bounce in his step following ACL surgery, Zach LaVine reportedly has multiple suitors for his services. Vincent Goodwill of NBC Sports Chicago reports the Atlanta Hawks could be in play for the 6-foot-5 guard: Kevin O\u2019Connor of The Ringer adds that the Sacramento Kings \u201care also showing interest in Zach LaVine, per sources.\u201d LaVine is a restricted free agent, which allows Chicago to match any offer he receives from another team. That may not stop such offers from coming for the 23-year-old, who averaged 16.7 points per contest last season. \u2014 1:22 a.m. * * * After reportedly losing Trevor Ariza to Phoenix, the Rockets will hang on to another sharp-shooting swingman in Gerald Green. Multiple reports have the veteran guard returning to Houston on a one-year deal. Michael Stotto of The Athletic tweeted: Green averaged 12.1 points in just 22.7 minutes per contest for the Rockets, his highest output since the 2013-14 campaign. \u2014 1:11 a.m. * * * Eager to add shooting around their new big man duo of Marc Gasol and Jaren Jackson Jr., the Grizzlies have reportedly agreed to contract terms with veteran swingman Omri Casspi. Per ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski: The 6-foot-8 forward shot 45.5 percent from 3-point range in 53 games with Golden State last season. Memphis would mark the sixth different Western Conference team for which has played. \u2014 1:04 a.m. * * * Derrick Rose and Tom Thibodeau will remain together with the Timberwolves. Multiple reports surfaced early Sunday saying the former Kia MVP has agreed to re-sign with Minnesota on a one-year deal. Adrian Wojnarowski tweeted: Rose averaged a career-low 8.4 points per game on 43.5 percent shooting last season, his 10th in the league. \u2014 12:56 a.m. * * * After spending three years apart, Marco Belinelli and San Antonio could finalize an NBA reunion. ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski reports that the two sides have come to terms on a two-year deal that would add extra perimeter shooting to the Spurs\u2019 roster. According to Wojnarowski : Belinelli was a key member of the Spurs\u2019 2014 NBA championship team and is a career 37.7-percent shooter from 3-point range. He played a vital role in Philadelphia\u2019s playoff run to the Eastern Conference semifinals last season, averaging a career-best 12.1 points per contest. \u2014 12:50 a.m. * * * After adding two top-10 picks via the draft, Phoenix decided some veteran experience was in order. According to multiple reports, Rockets free agent forward Trevor Ariza has agreed to a one-year, $15 million deal with the Suns. Per Shams Charania of Yahoo Sports: The move would deplete a significant member of the core that took Houston to Game 7 of the Western Conference Finals. Phoenix, meanwhile, now adds Ariza to a stable of forwards that includes Josh Jackson, Mikal Bridges and TJ Warren. \u2014 12:45 a.m. * * * While the Celtics are certainly looking forward to Kyrie Irving and Gordon Hayward returning from injury, they were just as eager to bring one of their free agents back. According to Yahoo Sports\u2019 Shams Charania \u2014 and seemingly confirmed by Baynes himself \u2014 the six-year big man will come back to Boston on a two-year, $11 million deal, the second of which will be a player option. Baynes expressed his excitement on Twitter over the deal: Baynes averaged 6.0 points and 5.4 rebounds in 18.3 minutes per contest for a Celtics squad that advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals. \u2014 12:43 a.m. * * * Seeking to fortify its frontcourt, Brooklyn has reportedly come to terms with veteran big man Ed Davis. The former lottery pick will join the Nets on a two-year deal per ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski : Davis averaged 5.3 points and 7.4 rebounds in just 18.9 minutes per contest for Portland last season. \u2014 12:40 a.m. \u2014 Minutes after word surfaced that Paul George would return to the Thunder, Jerami Grant is reportedly following suit. The four-year forward, according to multiple reports, will re-sign with Oklahoma City on a new three-year deal. TNT\u2019s David Aldridge detailed Grant\u2019s new deal as follows: \u2014 12:36 a.m. * * * It appears likely that Kevin Durant will extend his stay in the bay \u2014 for one more year, anyway. According to multiple reports, the recent NBA Finals MVP plans to sign a two-year deal with Golden State shortly after negotiations open at 12:01 a.m. The deal will include a player option for the 2019-20 season. Here\u2019s more : Chris Haynes of ESPN and Shams Charania of Yahoo Sports later confirmed Stein\u2019s report. Charania detailed the following: \u2014 12:23 a.m. * * * After making the plunge to acquire Chris Paul a year ago, the Houston Rockets weren\u2019t about to let him go. ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski and the Houston Chronicle \u2018s Jonathan Feigen report that Houston and Paul have agreed to a four-year deal worth $160 million that will keep him with the team that came within one game of the 2018 NBA Finals. Here\u2019s more from Feigen on the deal : Paul averaged 18.6 points, 7.9 assists and 1.7 steals per contest while teaming up with recently crowned Kia MVP James Harden to lead Houston to its most successful regular season in franchise history and deepest playoff run since 1995. \u2014 12:19 a.m. * * * Paul George was considered one of the most talented and unpredictable free agents of 2018. Despite the Oklahoma City Thunder\u2019s first-round exit in the playoffs, however, the five-time All-Star has committed to returning to OKC long-term. George will re-sign with the team that gambled on him last summer despite the lone year remaining on his contract. The Thunder, it appears, will be rewarded for the risk with a longer commitment from the 6-foot-9 swingman. Here\u2019s more : The Thunder\u2019s odds of keeping George appeared strengthened on Saturday when ESPN.com\u2019s Royce Young reported superstar guard Russell Westbrook would host a \u201csummer hype house party\u201d in Oklahoma City on Saturday night with George having just arrived in town. While attending that party, George was reported to have announced his commitment to re-sign to those in attendnace. Film later surfaced on Twitter of him doing so: As for George\u2019s other options, the call of home ultimately was not strong to the California native. The Los Angeles Lakers were one of the teams most often linked to George, especially in conjunction with fellow free agents LeBron James and Kawhi Leonard. \u2014 12:05 a.m. * * * After adding playmaking guards via the draft the last two summers, Dallas could be closing in on an elite big man to join them. Clippers free agent center DeAndre Jordan has verbally agreed to sign a one-year contract with the Mavericks, per Marc Stein of The New York Times and Eddie Sefko of the Dallas Morning News . Jordan nearly signed with Dallas in 2015 before ultimately changing his mind and returning to Los Angeles. The Clippers, however, are shifting from the \u201cLob City\u201d era after having dealt Chris Paul and Blake Griffin over the previous 12 months. After declining his 2018-19 player option, it appears Jordan is the next and final member of that core to leave. Here\u2019s more from Sefko on the deal : \u2014 12:10 a.m. * * * Coming off a surprise season that nearly saw them beat the Cleveland Cavaliers in the first round, the Indiana Pacers are reportedly adding a dash of shooting to their overall mix. According to ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski and the Indianapolis Star \u2018s J. Michael, Indiana has come to terms with Mavericks free agent Doug McDermott. The former lottery pick boasts a career mark of 40.3 percent from 3-point range, including a scorching 49.4 percent during his 26 games with Dallas last season. Wojnarowski said of the agreement: \u2014 12:08 a.m. * * * After spending his first seven NBA seasons with the Bucks, Ersan Ilyasova will return to Milwaukee according to multiple reports. The Turkish forward would add a flare of outside shooting next to Bucks superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo and point guard Eric Bledsoe. According to Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN: ESPN\u2019s Zach Lowe adds that the third year of Ilyasova\u2019s contract will not be guaranteed. The 6-foot-10 forward averaged 10.8 points per game with the Hawks and 76ers last season. * * * While the fate of one forward is still up in the air, San Antonio decided to keep another around for at least one more year. Multiple reports have Rudy Gay returning to the Spurs on a one-year, $10 million deal. The veteran forward averaged 11.5 points, 5.1 rebounds and 1.3 assists in his first year with San Antonio last season. Yahoo Sports\u2019 Shams Charania was the first to report the deal: \u2014 12:07 a.m. * * * The Brooklyn Nets will reportedly re-sign swingman Joe Harris. According to multiple reports, Brooklyn has come to terms with the 6-foot-6 swingman on a two-year deal. ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski reports: Harris averaged a career-high 10.8 points on 49.1 percent shooting last year for the Nets, his fourth season in the league. \u2014 12:04 a.m. * * * The Nuggets have long considered Nikola Jokic a franchise-level talent. Now the franchise is ready to pay him like one. According to ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski, the 22-year-old will sign a five-year maximum contract to remain with Denver. The Nuggets declined his team option for 2018-19 to make him a restricted free agent rather than allow him to enter unrestricted free agency next summer. It looks like the move will pay off for both Denver and Jokic. Wojnarowski tweets : \u2014 12:01 a.m. The Denver Nuggets could have the inside track on retaining one of the best scoring sixth men in the league. According to Chris Mannix of Yahoo Sports, Will Barton and the Nuggets will come to terms on a four-year deal shortly after free agency negotiations open at 12:01 a.m. TNT\u2019s David Aldridge later confirmed the report. The six-year guard is coming off a season in which he averaged career highs in points (15.7), rebounds (5.0), assists (4.1) and steals (1.0) per contest, as well as shooting percentage (45.2) and 3-point shooting percentage (37.0). Mannix detailed the deal as follows: ESPN\u2019s Chris Haynes later added that the contract would be for four years and $54 million, with a player option on the fourth year. Earlier on Saturday, ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski reported that \u201cstrong momentum\u201d had developed between the two parties in an effort to reach a new contract. The Ringer\u2019s Kevin O\u2019Connor added that an agreement between Denver and Barton would impact the free agency plans of Indiana, who are reportedly interested in the 6-foot-6 guard\u2019s services. Should Barton no longer be available, Wojnarowski tweets that the Pacers could shift their attention to Doug McDermott or Joe Harris. \u2014 11:03 p.m. * * * Fred VanVleet put himself on the NBA map as a young, dependable sixth man for the top-seeded team in the Eastern Conference. The problem for Toronto now is that the 23-year-old restricted free agent is now firmly on other teams\u2019 radars. The Phoenix Suns are reportedly one of the teams interested in VanVleet\u2019s services, and for good reason. Phoenix is well-stocked at every position except point guard, where they currently have Brandon Knight (recovering from ACL surgery) and second-round draft pick Elie Okobo. According to Josh Lewenberg of TSN, the Suns could be the \u201cbiggest threat\u201d to sign VanVleet to a contract that cap-strapped Toronto might not want to match. Lewenberg says via Twitter : \u2014 7:43 p.m. * * * After an inspiring run to the Western Conference semifinals, the Utah Jazz will reportedly attempt to keep the band together as soon as possible. According to Tony Jones of The Salt Lake Tribune , the franchise will meet with free agent big man Derrick Favors on Sunday. The eight-year veteran played an instrumental role in Utah\u2019s midseason turnaround, averaging 12.3 points, 7.2 rebounds and 1.1 blocks per contest. Jones reports via Twitter : \u2014 7:27 p.m. * * * In an effort to further define their roster around its young talent, Denver is reportedly making veterans Wilson Chandler, Darrell Arthur and Kenneth Faried available to trade. The report comes form Marc Stein of the New York Times: \u2014 7:08 p.m. * * *  Report: Warriors looking at Ariza, Bradley, Howard?  A lack of cap space may not prohibit Golden State from being a factor in free agency. According to USA TODAY\u2019S Sam Amick , the Warriors will see if their limited funds and championship pedigree is enough to add difference-making rotation players to their star-studded roster. According to Amick, Dwight Howard has \u201cserious interest in joining the Warriors.\u201d The eight-time All-Star and three-time Kia Defensive Player of the Year is reportedly set to be traded from Charlotte to Brooklyn, then bought out of his contract, which would make him an unrestricted free agent. Amick also mentions Rockets swingman Trevor Ariza and Clippers guard Avery Bradley as potential targets for the two-time defending champions. \u2014 6:50 p.m. * * * The Los Angeles Lakers have requested waivers on center Thomas Bryant, it was announced today.  Bryant appeared in 15 games for the Lakers, averaging 1.5 points and 1.1 rebounds in 4.6 minutes per game. The move reportedly helps clear space for the team in its pursuit of free agents this summer, according to ESPN\u2019s Bobby Marks. \u2014 4:12 p.m. * * * The Phoenix Suns released point guard Tyler Ulis, who just completed his second year with the team, in a salary cap move, according to ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski . The former Kentucky guard will be a free agent once he clears waivers. \u2014 4:08 p.m. * * * The Minnesota Timberwolves opted to waive center Cole Aldrich instead of guaranteeing his $6.9 million contract, according to ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski. Aldrich, who has played nine seasons in the league, will become a free agent. \u2014 4:00 p.m. * * *  When the free agency period begins on Sunday morning, LeBron James or any of his representatives will have an in-person meeting with Cleveland Cavaliers officials, according to a report by ESPN\u2019s Dave McMenamin . According to the report, it is unclear that the two sides have set up a meeting.

He could be there longer than usual. Hours before NBA free agency opened with the three-time champion as its most coveted prize, James returned Saturday to Southern California, where he has two homes and a film production company. The Lakers are hoping they can persuade him to sign with them and return them to glory. Los Angeles is among the teams in the mix to land James after his agent told the Cleveland Cavaliers on Friday that he will not exercise his $35.6 million contract option for next season. At 12:01 a.m. Sunday, James will be an unrestricted free agent, and agent Rich Paul is expected to contact several teams with the Lakers and Cavs atop his list. By declining his option, James positioned himself to be able to choose where he\u2019ll play next, and Cleveland, just up the road from his home near Akron, remains a strong possibility. But there are at least three other teams \u2013 and maybe an outsider or two \u2014 with legitimate shots at landing James, who made it clear following this year\u2019s NBA Finals that he\u2019s still driven to win championships. While every team dreams of being ruled by King James, only a few have a legit chance of signing him. Here are the cases \u2014 for and against \u2014 the leading contenders: CLEVELAND WHY: Home; money. James came back four years ago to a hero\u2019s welcome, something that seemed unimaginable when he left in disgrace four years earlier for Miami. But he vowed to do everything he could to deliver a title to championship-starved Cleveland. He delivered in 2016, erasing past sins and raising James to a worshipped level few athletes in any sport have experienced. His family is comfortable here and it\u2019s where he has complete control. The Cavs can also offer him the most lucrative package, a five-year, $209 million contract. WHY NOT: Flawed roster; blemished relationship with owner Dan Gilbert. Last summer\u2019s stunning trade of guard Kyrie Irving left the Cavs without a quality running mate for James, who was forced to carry a heavier offensive load throughout the regular season and playoffs. Cleveland has deep salary-cap issues \u2013 partially caused by James\u2019 failure to commit long-term \u2013 and the Cavs currently lack enough talent to unseat the champion Golden State Warriors. Gilbert and James mended some fences for his return in 2014, but they remain distant other than a shared commitment to winning. Gilbert has gone above and beyond financial barriers to appease James, but the well could be running dry. LOS ANGELES LAKERS WHY: Salary-cap space; business interests; iconic franchise. With some savvy moves, the Lakers are poised to potentially add two superstars \u2013 James and Paul George and maybe Kawhi Leonard \u2013 to a team featuring up-and-coming talents like Kyle Kuzma, Brandon Ingram and Lonzo Ball, who is reportedly dealing with a knee injury. James loves the Hollywood lights, and with two homes in the Los Angeles area as well as a film production company, he has already established some roots in the land of movie stars and slow-moving traffic. The appeal of playing for one of the league\u2019s most storied teams is another allure. WHY NOT: Youth; the Western Conference. There\u2019s little doubt James has some quality years ahead of him. But does he have enough time to let a group of unproven players with no postseason experience develop into a title contender? And if he jumps conferences for the first time in his career, the path to the Finals is far more treacherous. PHILADELPHIA WHY: Rising team; staying in the East. In Sixers guard Ben Simmons, James sees a younger version of himself and he\u2019d relish the chance to play alongside the 21-year-old while mentoring him. The Sixers also have center Joel Embiid, 24, projected to become the game\u2019s next dominant big men. Philadelphia would instantly vault from conference contender to favorite with James, who could make a strong run at his ninth straight Finals in Year One. WHY NOT: Too young; front-office dysfunction. Much like the Lakers, the Sixers lack postseason experience and James would be surrounded by players who have barely tasted the postseason. General manager Bryan Colangelo\u2019s resignation following an investigation into whether he created Twitter accounts to criticize his own players, has given the impression that the team isn\u2019t operating in concert and then would turn off James quickly. OTHER CONTENDERS Houston: While the Rockets once seemed a good fit, James declining his option all but eliminated the chances of him joining up with close friend Chris Paul and MVP James Harden. If James had opted in with the Cavs, they could have worked out a sign-and-trade with Houston. San Antonio: James reveres Spurs coach Gregg Popovich, but living in Texas doesn\u2019t seem appealing to the star\u2019s family and the Spurs are still trying to figure out what to do with Leonard, who can become a free agent after next season.

That\u2019s what they did. The Heat and Pacers could have done the same with Mickey and Young, but did not, so they\u2019re each unrestricted free agents. Some players were eligible for restricted free agency. This group includes 2014 first round draft picks who had their third and fourth-year options picked up and just completed their rookie contract, as well as other players who have played three or fewer seasons in the league. Restricted free agency allows the team to match any offer the player receives from another team. But in order to have that right, the team must have issued the player a qualifying offer by Saturday night. If a qualifying offer wasn\u2019t issued, that player is an unrestricted free agent instead. The qualifying offer is binding as a one-year contract. If the player signs it, he\u2019s under contract for next season. He could also sign an offer sheet from another team (which his team would have the ability to match), and he and his team could agree on a new, multi-year contract.

Much like a year ago, Durant declined to opt in for the second year of his deal, allowing him to work on a more lucrative contract once the signing period begins Saturday night. Durant only had to inform the Warriors if he planned to opt in, and the team had long been prepared for this move \u2014 merely a procedural decision \u2014 knowing his plans for months. The 29-year-old Durant could sign for as many as four years and about $160 million. He has made clear all along his commitment to the Warriors, especially after winning a pair of championships in his first two seasons with Golden State. A year ago, Durant declined to opt in for the second year of his contract to become an unrestricted free agent. That also was expected as he wanted to do whatever he could to give the franchise financial flexibility to keep the core of the team intact to chase more titles.

Jordan has opted out of the final year of that contract he signed with LA in 2015, and the Mavericks intend to pursue him as an unrestricted free agent, a person with knowledge of the decision told The Associated Press on Friday. Dallas also intends to decline the $5 million club option on Dirk Nowitzki\u2019s contract and re-sign him once its salary structure is more settled, the person told the AP on condition of anonymity because the sides are not publicly commenting on moves ahead of free agency opening Sunday. The move on Nowitzki is designed to create more room under the salary cap, as were the decisions to rescind qualifying offers to shooting guard Doug McDermott and center Salah Mejri, making both unrestricted free agents. Jordan was set to make $24.1 million under the four-year, $87.6 million contract he signed to stay with the team that drafted him in 2008. Seven years later, the Mavericks made a strong play for Jordan, who agreed to sign with them as a free agent. The Houston native changed his mind, and the saga played out on social media the day before Jordan could sign. Former teammate Blake Griffin and coach Doc Rivers were part of a contingent that went to his house and stayed with him until the deal was official. The reversal was a stunning setback for Dallas, which made the playoffs without Jordan the following year but lost in the first round and now is coming off consecutive losing seasons for the first time in nearly 20 years. Circumstances are much different now, with the former All-Stars who helped persuade Jordan to stay no longer around. Chris Paul engineered a trade to Houston last summer, and the Clippers shipped Griffin to Detroit in January in a sign that rebuilding years could be ahead. The Mavericks are two years into their own reconstruction, with 2017 first-round pick Dennis Smith Jr. joined by another player who will begin his NBA career as a teenager in European standout Luka Doncic. Dallas moved up two spots in the Draft last week to get the Slovenian guard, who was taken third overall by Atlanta while the Mavericks selected former Oklahoma scoring sensation Trae Young for the Hawks. Mavericks owner Mark Cuban refused to accept an apology from Jordan after the reversal, but later said he was moving on and never ruled out acquiring a player despite what was seen as a betrayal. Now the billionaire wants to get the Mavericks back to winning as soon as possible. Cuban was fined $600,000 last season for public comments admitting the club tanked for better draft picks, but his point was that he was telling his players he wanted to get away from that strategy. A long-term deal for Jordan, who turns 30 in July, would be a strong sign of that. Jordan, who was second in the NBA at 15.2 rebounds per game last season, shores up an area that has long been a weakness for a franchise that hasn\u2019t won a playoff series since winning its first NBA title in 2011. He averaged 12 points per game last season. His arrival would be an odd twist for Dallas fans, who booed him steadfastly in each of his five trips to Dallas after that summertime saga. Jordan\u2019s presence also could mean Nowitzki comes off the bench in what is expected to be his record 21st season with the same franchise. Since the change of heart by Jordan, the most productive center for the Mavericks was their immediate replacement \u2013 Zaza Pachulia in 2015-16. Dallas hoped Nerlens Noel could become a significant piece after trading for him at the deadline in 2017. But the sixth overall pick by Philadelphia in 2013 never blossomed. * * * East Player Movement | West Player Movement | Free Agent Tracker"},{"id":39718,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-dallas-mavericks-dirk-nowitzki-mutually-opt-out-contract","date":"2018-06-29","title":"Report: Dallas Mavericks, Dirk Nowitzki mutually opt out of contract","content":" Dirk Nowitzki and the Dallas Mavericks mutually declined the option on the 20-year veteran\u2019s contract, according to the New York Times\u2019 Marc Stein .

James joined fellow All-Stars Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh in Miami to form a super team that reached the NBA Finals in four-straight seasons from 2010-14. After falling to the Dallas Mavericks during the 2011 NBA Finals, the Heat won back-to-back titles in 2012 and 2013.

Today, though, Celtics president of basketball operations Danny Ainge said he didn\u2019t think a second such mega-trade would happen again this offseason. Ainge spoke with reporters after the Celtics introduced their first-round Draft pick, Robert Williams, at the team\u2019s practice facility. The Celtics have been rumored to be in the mix of teams pursuing trades for disgruntled San Antonio Spurs forward Kawhi Leonard . Boston has a treasure trove of assets \u2014 from its young players to future Draft picks \u2014 to facilitate trades. ESPN\u2019s Chris Forsberg was at today\u2019s news conference and has more from Ainge and his viewpoint on this summer : Ainge also told reporters that the Celtics are not looking to fill a specific need in free agency ( which begins on July 1 ). Instead, he said he and the rest of the front office are looking to find role players for the Celtics this summer. On May 31, the Celtics were minutes away from their first Finals berth in eight years. However, they lost in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference finals to the Cleveland Cavaliers \u2014 a remarkable feat considering they reached that game without injured stars Hayward and Kyrie Irving. Irving missed the final 15 games of the 2017-18 season and the entire playoffs to repair his left knee. Roughly a week ago, Celtics coach Brad Stevens told reporters he is hopeful that Irving could return to the court sometime in August .

In an interview with the team\u2019s web site about a variety of topics , Walker addressed his name being mentioned in trade talks in January last season . The 28-year-old Walker has been the subject of possible NBA trade talks as he prepares to enter the final year of his contract with the Hornets. That speculation has amped up recently because it is a practical impossibility for Charlotte to sign Walker to an extension before he becomes a free agent in July of 2019 since the Hornets are so tight under the salary cap. However, Walker says he was happy to hear new GM Mitch Kupchak recently say Walker is a focal point of the franchise going forward . \u201cIt means a lot. It means a lot,\u201d Walker said. \u201cI want to feel wanted, of course. It feels good. I\u2019m excited he did it. He\u2019s a good man and I\u2019m getting to know him every single day. I\u2019m a Hornet. I\u2019m going into my eighth year and I\u2019m excited like it\u2019s my rookie year. I\u2019m here right now and that\u2019s all I can really think of. \u201cI\u2019ve got to control what I can control \u2026 that\u2019s really about it. I\u2019m not even thinking about it. I see it all the time. I hear about it all the time. I hear about the rumors, but I could care less. I\u2019m a Hornet and that\u2019s really all that matters.\u201d Kupchak said last Friday that Walker is \u201crevered\u201d in the Charlotte community, and that he and owner Michael Jordan look at the two-time All-Star as a fixture for the team going forward. Walker also addressed the team\u2019s offseason overhaul, which included parting ways with coach Steve Clifford and his staff and firing GM Rich Cho . The Hornets hired Kupchak as their new GM and, shortly thereafter, named San Antonio Spurs assistant coach James Borrego as their new coach . \u201cI was here for a while with Cliff and the rest of his staff, especially guys like [former assistant] coach [Stephen] Silas. I was pretty upset when those guys got let go, but that\u2019s the nature of the business,\u201d Walker said. \u201cYou kind of have to understand the things that go on with our league and what happens in organizations. People have to make decisions and people have to make tough decisions as well. \u201cCliff\u2019s a great coach and he\u2019s helped change this organization tremendously. I know to let him go was a tough choice for Mitch. It was tough for me to see him and the rest of the staff go as well. But, you get over it and you\u2019ve got to look ahead to the future.\u201d Clifford was hired by the Orlando Magic on May 30 as their new coach. He went 196-214 in five seasons there and led the Hornets to playoffs in two of his first four seasons after the team qualified for the postseason just once in the previous 10 seasons. The Hornets reportedly traded center Dwight Howard to the Brooklyn Nets in one of the first moves of the offseason. He is expected to be waived by Brooklyn once the league\u2019s free-agent moratorium ends on July 6. Aside from that move, the Hornets traded for rookie Miles Bridges on Draft night and selected Devonte Graham from Kansas in the second round, too. As the opening of free agency nears, the Hornets will enter it with mostly the same roster it fielded last season. Walker, however, has been happy with the roster at hand and is looking forward to 2018-19 in Charlotte. \u201cThings are different around here. There\u2019s some great, positive energy,\u201d Walker said. \u201cI feel good, I\u2019m healthy \u2026 it\u2019s my first time having a healthy summer in the last three years. So, I\u2019m not rehabbing every day \u2026 I\u2019m getting better and it\u2019s exciting.\u201d Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":39744,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-lebron-james-declines-option-cleveland-cavaliers-2018-19-season","date":"2018-06-29","title":"LeBron James declines option for 2018-19 season","content":"LeBron James is apparently headed into unrestricted free agency this summer. According to multiple reports, James is declining his $35.6 million contract option for next season. The news was first reported via Twitter by Joe Vardon of Cleveland.com . James had until 11:59 p.m. to express his intentions to the Cavs and his agent Rich Paul informed the team Friday morning, said the people who spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the sides are not publicly commenting on moves ahead of free agency opening Sunday. The three-time champion is now the most coveted prize in an NBA free-agent class that includes All-Stars Paul George and Chris Paul. Teams can begin negotiation with free agents at 12:01 a.m. Sunday. The decision to decline the option for 2018-19 was expected by James because it gives him more options, which includes him re-signing with the Cavs, who can offer him a five-year, $209 million contract. James can also sign a short-term deal with Cleveland, something he has done each year since returning in 2014. In 2010, he bolted for Miami and spent four seasons with the Heat , winning two titles, before returning home to Northeast Ohio. While the decision may cause some anxious feelings in Cleveland, ESPN\u2019s Dave McMenamin reports (via Twitter) that James\u2019 decision to not opt in isn\u2019t a harbinger of the end of LeBron\u2019s time with the Cavs : David Aldridge of Turner Sports reports via Twitter LeBron\u2019s opt-out makes it harder for the Houston Rockets to acquire him this summer, but may help the Los Angeles Lakers in landing him . Additionally, reports ESPN\u2019s Ramona Shelburne (via Twitter), James\u2019 move helps other teams interested in him as well: James said he\u2019ll factor family into his next choice and there\u2019s still a chance he\u2019ll re-sign with the Cavs, who were swept by Golden State in this year\u2019s Finals. With the ability to sign two maximum-contract players, the Lakers can build a \u201cSuper Team\u201d with James if they are able to also land George or work out a trade with San Antonio for Kawhi Leonard. James already has some shallow roots on the West Coast with two homes in the Los Angeles area and a film production company. The chance to join one of the league\u2019s most iconic franchises has an appeal to James, who just completed his 15th season and said following this year\u2019s Finals that he remains in \u201cchampionship mode.\u201d He has long been linked to the Lakers, partly because he has two homes in the Los Angeles area along with a film production company. There\u2019s also the fact that the Lakers have enough salary-cap space to sign James and another maximum-contract player like Leonard or George and form a \u201cSuper Team\u201d capable of competing with the reigning champion Golden State Warriors. The first major free-agent domino fell Thursday as George reportedly decided not to exercise his $20.7 million option for next season with Oklahoma City. For now, George is set to hit the market when free agency officially begins at 12:01 a.m. Sunday, but he may not go anywhere. The Thunder can offer him more money and George could get a five-year, $176 million and stay in Oklahoma. It\u2019s unclear what affect, if any, George\u2019s decision has had on James and his plans. The two are good friends and there\u2019s little doubt they would relish the opportunity to play together after competing against each other for years. As for Leonard, there\u2019s little clarity on his troubled relationship with San Antonio. It remains unclear if the Spurs are willing to trade him and if they are willing to part ways with him, where he would land. For James, the dilemma is whether to leave his home again. Upon his return to Cleveland four years ago from Miami, James said it took time away to realize what he was missing. \u201cMy relationship with Northeast Ohio is bigger than basketball,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize that four years ago. I do now.\u201d James also said he always felt like he would come back to Cleveland to finish his career where it began. But that was before the Akron native led the Cavs to four straight Finals and won Cleveland\u2019s first professional sports title since 1964. If Decision 3.0 is to go, James feels content. \u201cI came back because I felt like I had some unfinished business,\u201d he said following Game 4 of the NBA Finals. \u201cTo be able to be a part of a championship team two years ago with the team that we had and in the fashion that we had is something I will always remember. \u2026 It ended a drought for Cleveland of 50-plus years, so I think we\u2019ll all remember that in sports history.\u201d Information from The Associated Press was used in this report. * * * East Player Movement | West Player Movement | Free Agent Tracker"},{"id":39747,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-new-york-knicks-enes-kanter-leaning-toward-opt-2018-19","date":"2018-06-29","title":"Report: Enes Kanter plans to opt in for 2018-19 with New York Knicks","content":" New York Knicks center has until 11:59 p.m. ET to exercise his option for next season. According to Yahoo Sports\u2019 Shams Charania, he is planning to stick with the team for another 2018-19. Via Twitter, Charania reports Kanter plans to opt in for next season : ESPN\u2019s Ian Begley reported yesterday that Kanter\u2019s opt-in seemed to be something he was leaning heavily toward doing. Kanter\u2019s opt in means the Knicks have an $8.6 million non-tax midlevel exception and a $3.4 million biannual exception to offer free agents this summer, writes Bagley . Last season, Kanter averaged 14.1 points per game and 11 rebounds per game on 59.2 percent shooting. He served as a vocal leader at times for the Knicks and someone who had his teammates\u2019 backs throughout 2017-18 . The Knicks were 29-53 last season, missing the postseason for the fifth straight season, and have posted four winning seasons since 2000 . Kanter was acquired by the Knicks with Doug McDermott in a trade last summer that sent Carmelo Anthony to the Oklahoma City Thunder . Kanter has established himself as one of the better scoring big men in the league, holding career averages of 11.7 ppg and 7.3 rpg in 516 career NBA games. He was taken third overall in the 2011 draft by the Utah Jazz and then dealt to OKC in 2015 as part of a three-team deal with the Thunder and Detroit Pistons. Recently, Kanter had told the New York Post he was looking forward to playing for new coach David Fizdale . Fizdale had spent eight seasons before going to the Memphis Grizzlies in Miami, where the Heat reached four straight NBA Finals. He is the 11th Knicks coach since Jeff Van Gundy resigned in the 2001-02 season. Fizdale went 50-51 with the Grizzlies, leading them to the postseason in his only full season before getting fired early last year after clashing with star Marc Gasol. He becomes the 29th coach in franchise history, hoping to lead the Knicks out of what is now a five-year postseason drought. He replaced Jeff Hornacek, who lasted two seasons in New York before getting fired hours after the 2017-18 season finale.

To George, the pursuit of a championship opportunity is the driving focus in whatever choice he makes. And in expressing this in the second of his three-part ESPN special , George doesn\u2019t seem to rule out a return to the Thunder \u2014 or perhaps a move back to his hometown Los Angeles Lakers. George opens up talking about his love for Los Angeles, the Lakers and former star Kobe Bryant drove him to succeed as a basketball player. In addition, he talks about entering free agency as a milestone moment of sorts in his career. George\u2019s agent, Aaron Mintz, features prominently in the episode and explains George\u2019s various contract options, including how re-signing with Oklahoma City would give George significantly more money than any other team can offer. For Thunder GM Sam Presti, this opportunity to re-sign George is one the team is glad to have, he says. At the end of the special, George meets with Miami Heat guard Dwyane Wade on June 15. Over glasses of wine, the duo discuss their careers and George asks Wade how he would approach George\u2019s situation this summer. Wade recalls his free agency of 2010, in which he was one of the NBA\u2019s marquee names, and how a conversation with LeBron James shifted his entire career. Wade ended up re-signing with the Heat in 2010 as the team also added James and Chris Bosh via sign-and-trade deals . That trio made four straight NBA Finals from 2010-14, winning championships in 2012 and \u201913. As for George\u2019s interest in the Lakers, he sounds intrigued by the possibility of a homecoming.

ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski and the San Antonio Express-News \u2018 Jeff McDonald report that the Spurs are engaged in trade talks with several teams on Leonard, including the Los Angeles Lakers and Boston Celtics. Here\u2019s more from Wojnarowski : In short, it appears the Spurs are ready to move on from Leonard, writes McDonald, and the Lakers and Celtics appear to be the most compatible trade partners at this point : Additionally, The New York Times\u2019 Marc Stein reports (via Twitter) that league sources indicate the Spurs are \u201cready\u201d to move on from Leonard : The Lakers and Spurs reportedly re-engaged in trade discussions surrounding Leonard on Wednesday. ESPN\u2019s Ramona Shelburne, Adrian Wojnarowski and Brian Windhorst reported on Wednesday night that, despite the Spurs\u2019 attempts to make peace with their disgruntled star, an overwhelming offer from the Lakers could spark a deal. Both teams also believe a Leonard trade would \u201clikely clinch\u201d a commitment from LeBron James to join the Lakers as a free agent, per ESPN. James has until Friday at 11:59 ET to decline his player option with the Cleveland Cavaliers to become an unrestricted free agent. It had been reported by ESPN that the Lakers were feeling pressure to quickly land Leonard in an effort to lure James, who is reportedly hesitant to join the team without another star in place. The Celtics have been reported to have an interest in Leonard, too. However, Steve Bulpett of the Boston Herald reported on Wednesday that the likelihood of the Celtics landing Leonard seems slim at best . As for the discussions held Wednesday, Los Angeles Times\u2019 Tania Ganguli said a source described the call as \u201cproductive.\u201d Aside from the Leonard chatter, the Lakers gave young forward Julius Randle a qualifying offer yesterday , ensuring he will be a restricted free agent this summer. That move, too, could play into what happens next for the Lakers in free agency, writes Ganguli: Leonard played in just nine games for San Antonio in the 2017-18 campaign due to a quad injury he initially suffered in Game 1 of the 2017 Western Conference finals . The two-time Kia Defensive Player of the Year\u2019s absence was especially notable late in the season, when he went to New York to continue rehab and chose not to be with the team during its playoff run. San Antonio was defeated 4-1 in the first round of the playoffs by eventual-champion Golden State. The two-time All-Star Leonard can enter unrestricted free agency in 2019 if he does not sign a contract extension with the Spurs this summer. Leonard is due just over $20 million next season. The tension surrounding the situation between Leonard and the Spurs intensified when, after opting to not be with the team for rehab reasons, Leonard was spotted three weeks later attending a Dodgers game in Los Angeles. San Antonio is hoping to regain the usual good footing it holds with its stars in order to maintain the standard of excellence they have maintained since drafting Tim Duncan No. 1 overall in 1997. The Spurs had won at least 50 games in every season until 2017-18, when they went 47-35 and finished seventh in the Western Conference. * * * Information from The Associated Press was used in this report. * * * East Player Movement | West Player Movement | Free Agent Tracker"},{"id":39724,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/mexico-shocks-usa-basketball-world-cup-qualifying","date":"2018-06-29","title":"Mexico shocks USA Basketball in World Cup qualifying round","content":"MEXICO CITY \u2014 Jeff Van Gundy warned the Americans that they were in for a serious challenge. To his chagrin, he was right \u2013 and the U.S. was handed a rare loss. Francisco Cruz scored 24 points, Mexico opened with an 18-0 run and went on to beat the United States 78-70 on Thursday night in a qualifying game for next year\u2019s FIBA World Cup. According to USA Basketball, it was just the second loss by the U.S. in 30 games against Mexico \u2013 with the other defeat coming in the 2011 Pan Am Games. Orlando Mendez-Valdez added 20 points for Mexico, which held the U.S. scoreless for the first 5:51 and forced the Americans into missing their first 10 shots from the floor. Marcus Thornton scored 14 points for the U.S., which is using a roster composed primarily of G League players for the qualifying rounds. Xavier Munford added 11 points while David Stockton and Reggie Hearn each had 10 for the Americans. The U.S. lost for the first time in 10 contests under Van Gundy, who is coaching this team that\u2019s tasked with getting the team of NBA stars that will be coached by Gregg Popovich to the World Cup. \u201cWe can\u2019t underestimate how hard it is going to be to play on the road, at altitude, and against a team desperate to qualify for the FIBA World Cup,\u201d Van Gundy said leading up to the game. \u201cWe have to make sure we match that type of intensity and passion that we know they\u2019ll bring.\u201d By the time the U.S. found its stride, it was already in deep trouble. Mexico led 31-10 after the first quarter, then staved off a big second-half rally try by the U.S. Trey McKinney-Jones\u2019 basket late in the third quarter capped a 15-1 run and put the U.S. within 53-51. Thornton made a pair of 3-pointers about a minute apart in that burst, and Hearn\u2019s 3-pointer early in the fourth cut Mexico\u2019s lead to 56-54. But the U.S. never got the lead. The Americans (4-1) \u2013 who have already ensured a spot in the second round of qualifying that starts in September \u2013 end the first-round series of games Sunday when they go to Havana to face Cuba (0-5). It\u2019ll be the first time a U.S. men\u2019s national team has played in Havana since the 1991 Pan American Games. Mexico (3-2) also wraps up its first round on Sunday, when it plays at Puerto Rico (3-2). David Huertas had 18 points, Angel Rodriguez and JJ Barea each had 15 and Puerto Rico rallied in the fourth quarter in another qualifying game Thursday to top Cuba 84-80. Under FIBA\u2019s new qualifying format, teams are playing home-and-home games against teams in their region to earn places in the World Cup in China, which begins on Aug. 31, 2019. That tournament will qualify seven teams for the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo. This was the first time the U.S. played a true road game during this tournament. The Americans opened qualifying in November with an 85-78 win in what was a \u201chome\u201d game for Puerto Rico \u2013 but the contest was actually played in Orlando, Florida because of continued problems in San Juan following Hurricane Maria. And this was very much a real road atmosphere. Not only was the game played at Mexico City\u2019s 7,500-foot altitude, but in a filled 5,000-seat arena that Mexican officials said sold out in only 45 minutes. The tone was set by the U.S. turning the ball over on each of its first three possessions, and Mexico was off and running. The U.S. routed Mexico back in November, winning by 36 points. That was a very different Mexico team. Only four players from the Mexican roster then were in uniform on Thursday night, with the team now able to add those who were playing in their various professional leagues and unable to take part when the qualifying rounds began. Cruz and Mendez-Valdez each had 13 points by halftime, and Gustavo Ayon was a big factor even without big numbers \u2013 four points, four rebounds and five assists by the break. If their names are familiar to U.S. basketball aficionados, it\u2019s for good reason. Ayon appeared in 135 NBA games in parts of three seasons with four different franchises, and just helped Spanish powerhouse Real Madrid win the EuroLeague. Mendez-Valdez was part of the Western Kentucky team that went to the Sweet Sixteen in 2008, and he won the Sun Belt\u2019s player of the year award in the following season.

In an article breaking down various developments as NBA free agency approaches, Lowe writes that Golden State is interested in signing with Jamal Crawford, and that the feeling is mutual. Crawford, a three-time Kia Sixth Man of the Year, is coming off his lowest-scoring season (10.3 ppg) since the 2002-03 campaign. He upped his production, however, in the 2018 postseason by averaging 11.8 points per game while shooting 41.2 percent from 3-point range. In addition, Marcus Thompson of TheAthletic.com reports that Warriors stars Kevin Durant and Draymond Green are lobbying GM Bob Myers to pursue Crawford . The Warriors, who could face the prospect of signing star forward Durant to a lucrative new contract, will be looking for efficient ways to fill out their roster for next season. Crawford could potentially reinforce a backcourt that will see Nick Young and Patrick McCaw hit free agency this weekend. Crawford played 54 games for the Warriors during the 2008-09 season after being traded from the New York Knicks in exchange for Al Harrington. Golden State then traded him during the 2009 offseason for Speedy Claxton and Acie Law. * * * East Player Movement | West Player Movement | Free Agent Tracker"}]
