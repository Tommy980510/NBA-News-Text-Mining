We say that because Minnesota currently ranks 25th in defensive efficiency and 26th in points allowed. That\u2019s a recipe to success for Lowry, with Kyle averaging nearly 40 FD points per game across his last eight full games. Chris Boucher (C \u2013 TOR) vs. MIN $7,200 Boucher has had two amazing stretches and one horrific one, but he finds himself in the midst of one of the majestic ones right now. The big man has scored at least 33 fantasy points in five straight games while averaging 39 FanDuel points per game in that span. We obviously adore those numbers, with Minnesota surrendering the fourth-most fantasy points to opposing centers as well. Ja Morant (PG \u2013 MEM) at SAC $7,100 Morant has actually been slumping a bit, but it\u2019s lowered his price way too much. We\u2019re still talking about a guy who\u2019s averaging over 36 FanDuel points per game in his 12 healthy outings this season. He\u2019s also cracked 42 fantasy points in four of those and happens to be coming off one of those against the best defense in the NBA. That\u2019s certainly not the case here, with the Kings owning the NBA\u2019s worst defensive rating right now. Jakob Poeltl (C \u2013 SAS) vs. CHA $5,800 Poeltl should continue to start for LaMarcus Aldridge, making him a great value at the center position. In this role last season, he averaged over 25 FD points per game. He\u2019s been even better this year, scoring at least 38 fantasy points in three of his five starts en route to a 33-point average. We love that he faces a weak Charlotte frontcourt too. Kenrich Williams (PF \u2013 OKC) vs. MIL $5,500 Williams has quietly been a revelation for the Thunder. He\u2019s now averaging 29 FD points per game across his last six outings and should continue to play big minutes with Oklahoma City being so short-handed. We also don\u2019t mind that he faces a Milwaukee team that ranks sixth in pace. Miles Bridges (SF \u2013 CHA) vs. SAC $5,400 While the Hornets have a ton of depth at the guard positions, that\u2019s not the case at forward. They recently lost P.J. Washington, which has forced Bridges into his role. That\u2019s allowed Miles to record double-doubles in back-to-back games, and as long as he\u2019s playing the 31 minutes a night we\u2019ve seen over the last four fixtures, Bridges should build off of his 30-point average in that span. Grayson Allen (SG- MEM) at SAC $4,900 Memphis could be without Desmond Bane, Jaren Jackson Jr, Brandon Clarke, and De\u2019Anthony Melton here. That\u2019s going to force Allen into a significant role, which was on full display when he had 34 FD points across 35 minutes on Friday. Surprisingly, he\u2019s scored at least 28 fantasy points in five of his last seven games, and that\u2019s likely to happen again versus the worst defense in basketball. Josh Richardson (SF \u2013 DAL) vs. POR $4,900 Richardson has quietly turned his season around since coming off the COVID list. Over his last seven games, J-Rich is averaging 27 FD points per game across 33 minutes a night. That looks even more attractive when you consider this superb matchup, and we\u2019ll go over that more later on! Michael-Carter Williams (PG \u2013 ORL) at PHO $4,400 Orlando could be without Evan Fournier, Markelle Fultz, Cole Anthony, Frank Mason, and Aaron Gordon here, leaving MCW as the only true ball-handler left. In a rare start on Friday, Carter-Williams collected 21 points, seven rebounds, and seven assists. He\u2019s shown those stat-stuffing ways in the past, and if all these guys remain out, MCW is hard to fade in this price range. Isaiah Stewart (PF \u2013 DET) vs. NOR $4,000 If Mason Plumlee is out again, look for Stewart as a great GPP play. In his two starts he\u2019s made for Mason, Stewart is averaging 26 FD points in 27 minutes a night. This is a guy who\u2019s averaging 0.9 FD points per minute for the season, and if he plays 25-plus minutes, he\u2019ll provide great value at this price.

(AP) \u2014 Bubba Wallace was more of a fan of Michael Jordan from \u201cSpace Jam\u201d than watching the NBA. He was just a kid when Jordan was in his prime with Chicago, so it seemed natural Wallace was more captivated by MJ shooting hoops with Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck than with the Bulls. Jordan has been a pitchman, an NBA team owner and a t equila connoisseur \u2014 and on Sunday, with Wallace at the wheel, he makes his official debut as a NASCAR team owner with 23XI Racing in the Daytona 500. Jordan and team co-owner Denny Hamlin, a three-time Daytona 500 champion, might have more nerves than Wallace on the eve of NASCAR\u2019s biggest race. The 27-year-old Wallace has answered countless questions about what Jordan was like since the formation of the team was announced late last year. It was kind of hard to answer: Because of the coronavirus pandemic, Jordan and Wallace had never met. Jordan, who won six NBA championships over a Hall of Fame career, hit town this week and was spotted playing golf at a country club. Wallace was in awe when he met the man responsible for leading Tune Squad to their freedom with a last-second win over the Monstars in the 1996 movie. Wallace, Hamlin and Jordan all filmed a promo scheduled to air Sunday on Fox before the race. \u201cWhen he walked in the room it was like, \u2018Oh wow, this is for real,\u2019\u201d Wallace said. It\u2019s gut check time. Wallace is the only Black full-time driver at NASCAR\u2019s top level and in June successfully called for the series to ban the display of Confederate flags at racetracks. His activism caught the attention of corporate America, which raised enough funding through five companies to sponsor the entire Cup season. Wallace spent the last three seasons driving the iconic No. 43 for Richard Petty Motorsports, a team that struggled to compete at the highest levels because of sponsorship woes. As Wallace\u2019s profile expanded, he was able to raise funds that were tied to him and able to move with him. Wallace is winless in 112 career Cup starts, all at RPM. His runner-up finish in the 2018 Daytona 500 was the best finish by a Black driver in the race. Wallace flashed speed in the No. 23 Toyota \u2014 yes, Jordan\u2019s old Bulls number \u2014 at Speedweeks and topped the only practice session this week. He starts sixth Sunday and even Hamlin, who drives for rival Joe Gibbs Racing, might want to switch cars. \u201cOur car is super fast. It\u2019s one of the fastest cars in the garage,\u201d Wallace said. No plans have been perfect amid the pandemic. The Daytona 500 is usually a who\u2019s who for trying to spot actors, musicians and other famous athletes, who mill around the starting grid and create a party scene like no other in the sport. NASCAR fans and media would have mobbed Wallace\u2019s car in the final hour before the race hoping to catch a glimpse of or a photo with Jordan. But COVID-19 protocols will keep Jordan from watching at the No. 23 pit box. \u201cWith COVID, it\u2019s kind been a bummer,\u201d 23XI crew chief Mike Wheeler said. Wheeler appreciated the perks of working for Jordan \u2014 like owning the nicest swag (\u201cour nice shoes, fancy equipment\u201d) in the garage. But MJ will still find a seat at Daytona International Speedway. \u201cHe\u2019s humble enough, too, that he\u2019s like: \u2018OK, that\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll just hang outside,\u2019\u201d Wheeler said. \u201cI think he wants to go next week to sit on the pix box. But this week here\u2019s in Daytona watching from the suites.\u201d Scott is still the only Black driver to win a Cup race. Wallace won six times in the Truck Series and knows \u2014 relaxed or not in front of Jordan \u2014 that it\u2019s time to win. \u201cI just know the opportunity is there and what\u2019s on the line,\u201d Wallace said."},{"id":493411,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/fanduel-dfs-values-of-the-night-saturday-feb-13","date":"2021-02-13","title":"FanDuel DFS Values Of The Night: Saturday (Feb. 13)","content":"Rudy Gobert (UTA) $8,600: While this isn\u2019t the best matchup on paper, Gobert excels at a thing Miami struggles mightily with, and that\u2019s rebounding. The Heat have no one capable of keeping him off the glass, so he should have no issue producing in that area. On the other hand, the center position is a wasteland Saturday, so I am all for spending up to get Gobert in your lineup. Draymond Green (GS) $7,600: The injuries to James Wiseman and Kevon Looney have done wonders for Draymond Green\u2019s fantasy value. He\u2019s averaging just under 40 FanDuel points over his last six games and gets a terrific matchup against the Nets. This game is certainly one to attack as it seems destined to be the highest-scoring on the slate. DeMarcus Cousins (HOU) $6,200: Cousins is fresh off a double-double in Thursday\u2019s loss to the Heat and now gets a Knicks squad on the second night of a back-to-back who just lost Mitchell Robinson for the foreseeable future. Also, Victor Oladipo has been ruled out with a foot\/ankle injury, and Boogie has posted a 25% usage rate in 254 minutes without Oladipo on the floor this season. Eric Gordon (HOU) $5,600: As previously mentioned, Victor Oladipo is out with a foot\/ankle injury, which should open up a larger role for Gordon. He\u2019s scored 20 or more points in 10 of his last 14 games, and the Rockets will need his offense against a stout Knicks defense. Similar to Boogie Cousins, Gordon is seeing a 27% usage rate and is averaging just under 1.0 FanDuel point per minute in 381 minutes without Oladipo on the floor. T.J. McConnell (IND) $5,400: McConnell has scored at least 27.4 FanDuel points in five of his last six games and gets a Hawks team allowing the third-most FanDuel points to opposing point guards. The point guard position really drops off once you get past Malcolm Brogdon ($7,200) and McConnell offers enough upside to warrant value status. The IND\/ATL matchup boasts an over-under of 226.5 and is second only to GS\/BKN. Kendrick Nunn (MIA) $5,300: Miami has really relied on Nunn for offense over the last four games, and he\u2019s averaged 33 minutes per game as a result. He\u2019s been the biggest beneficiary of Goran Dragic\u2019s ankle injury and has scored at least 35.5 FanDuel points in two of his last four games. Juan Toscano-Anderson (GS) $5,200: Toscano-Anderson has been a pleasant surprise for the Warriors in February and is averaging 28.6 minutes over his last six games. He\u2019s been producing nicely as well, averaging just over 1.0 FanDuel point per minute during that span. As mentioned above, he enjoys the luxury of playing in the game with the highest over-under on the slate, giving him plenty of opportunities to produce. Joe Ingles (UTA) $4,900: Ingles\u2019 value is tied directly to Mike Conley\u2019s status, who is questionable to play after missing the last three games. Still, it\u2019s hard to wonder how he\u2019s priced at only $4,900 as his value increases tremendously without Conley in the lineup. If Conley sits again, Ingles will spend a ton of time with the ball in his hands as the playmaker for the Jazz. He\u2019s averaged just under 36 FanDuel points over his last two games and is seeing a 20% usage rate during that span. Jordan Clarkson (UTA) $4,700: Clarkson gets a matchup against the Heat, who have been struggling to maintain scoring guards this season. They are surrendering the third-most FanDuel points to opposing shooting guards, and Clarkson has seemingly found his rhythm after dropping 25 points in Friday\u2019s win over the Bucks. Priced at only $4,700, he very well could be the best value on the slate. Nerlens Noel (NYK) $4,000: Noel is about to see a massive role increase after Mitchell Robinson went down with a fractured hand in Friday\u2019s win over the Wizards. This is most likely the last time he\u2019ll be priced as low as $4,000 for the foreseeable future, so take advantage while you can."},{"id":492689,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/kevin-durant-is-back-for-the-nets-most-crucial-stretch-yet","date":"2021-02-13","title":"Kevin Durant is back for the Nets' most crucial stretch yet","content":"The last time Kevin Durant played a game on the Warriors\u2019 home court was the start of his troubles. On May 8 of 2019, third quarter, Game 5 of the Western Conference semifinals against the Rockets, Durant launched a baseline jumper, as he had thousands of times in his stellar career. The shot fell. And so did Durant, awkwardly. He immediately grabbed his right calf and limped to the locker room. Consider the state of Durant at that very moment: He had scored 22 points and the Warriors were on their way to a hard-fought win and 3-2 series lead over the stubborn Rockets led by James Harden and Chris Paul, easily the biggest threat to Golden State\u2019s dynasty. It appeared Durant and the Warriors were primed for a third championship together and a comfy place in history. Well, fate took a wicked turn that day, for Durant, for the Warriors. An Achilles injury in the 2019 Finals followed by his departure as a free agent that summer brought an end to a brief yet bountiful championship pairing. And as they meet again Saturday in the Bay Area, nearly two years later, not in Oakland but San Francisco, on separate benches, they\u2019re definitely headed in separate destinations this season at least. \u201cI had some great years in Golden State, and I\u2019m looking forward to being back in the Bay Area,\u201d said Durant, adding that he wishes fans were there. The Warriors without Durant are what you might expect, especially considering Klay Thompson is on the mend from a second major injury. It\u2019s been a quirky 2020-21 journey so far. Stephen Curry has been reasserting himself back into the Kia MVP conversation by flirting with the NBA scoring lead, but inconsistent play from young players has the Warriors mired in mediocrity. Far more interesting is the current state of Durant and the company he\u2019s now keeping. Durant is on pace to make a remarkable recovery from Achilles surgery. He\u2019s once again a dangerous offensive threat and late-game hero who\u2019s also in the MVP discussion and currently the leading vote-getter in the East for the All-Star Game. That in itself is one of the best stories of the NBA as the 2020-21 season lurches toward the midway point. Then there\u2019s another story also dripping with drama: His team, the Nets, is built to travel deep into the postseason, yet face persistent issues as they travel for a West Coast trip. Durant and his future Hall of Fame teammates, Kyrie Irving and James Harden, can exhaust any team trying to match their offensive lava flow. But can Brooklyn stop anyone \u2014 not necessarily now, but in the playoffs, when it truly matters? Furthermore, can the trio develop a smooth working relationship to fully unleash their potential as playmakers and shot-makers? This road trip is replete with potholes. After playing Curry and the Warriors, the Nets make stops in Sacramento for the red-hot Kings, then the rising Suns, then see both L.A. teams. If the Nets emerge from this without a blemish, which is possible, that would be a powerful if not scary flex for the rest of the league to see. Of course, the Nets could also stumble \u2014 consider, for example, that they were 7-6 before Harden arrived and are just 8-6 since. That speaks of a team still searching for a system that works and roles that need to either be defined or refined. Obviously, other factors have contributed; Durant missing games because of health protocols and Irving sitting out for personal issues. That\u2019s why it\u2019s crucial for the Nets to, at some point, play a long stretch of games where everyone\u2019s in the lineup and on the floor and developing the flow they\u2019ll need once the postseason arrives. Coach Steve Nash said the Nets need to \u201cdecide what type of team they want to be\u201d and appealed to the desire of the players, saying: \u201cHaving played the game, a certain amount of that comes down to team-building within that locker room, and deciding if they want to come together and be a force, or if that\u2019s not as important. Right now they\u2019ve been tested here, whether they want to become that team that\u2019s tough and connected and competitive every single night. And that\u2019s got to come from within that room.\u201d Durant is placing no great sense of urgency on the Nets, realizing that there\u2019s plenty of time ahead, and added: \u201cWe got a lot of potential. Each and every game we play good in spurts. We have to put together a full game \u2026 it\u2019s about execution. I think we\u2019re trending in the right direction.\u201d Of course, defense is the No. 1 bugaboo impacting that trend. Interestingly, the Nets\u2019 worst defensive games occur against the lowliest of opponents, meaning the Nets aren\u2019t generating or applying the same level of urgency against the bottom class. Those aren\u2019t the type of opponents they\u2019ll be facing during their longest road trip of the season\u2019s first half. They\u2019re embarking on a slate against the Pacific, which has just one team below .500 (Kings\u2019 loss Friday night dropped them to 12-13). Making an attempt to slow down Stephen Curry, De\u2019Aaron Fox, Devin Booker, Chris Paul, LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Kawhi Leonard and Paul George in a span of 12 days will be their biggest test yet. Meanwhile, because they\u2019re bringing three of the most lethal offensive forces in the game \u2014 all still in their prime \u2014 the Nets have the one strength to camouflage most if not all of their soft spots. On any given night, the pecking order between Harden, Durant and Irving can shuffle, making them the most flexible and dangerous offensive trio since \u2026 Durant was with the Warriors. In due time, Durant will almost certainly get his jersey retired by the Warriors, a steep honor for someone who played only three seasons with Golden State. In the meantime, the Warriors will show a video tribute of Durant in Saturday\u2019s game, although when that happens, there will be an echo instead of applause in the Chase Center, which will be devoid of fans. \u201cI wish our fans could be in the building for that game so we can give Kevin a proper welcome and a proper celebration for his three years,\u201d Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. \u201cI know we\u2019re all looking forward to seeing him.\u201d Not only did Durant help the Warriors reach the Finals three straight years, he meshed well with Curry, dropped a massive and clutch 3-pointer to secure one of the two championships, and helped make Warriors basketball the best show in the NBA if not all professional team sports. In hindsight, as you examine the three seasons Durant and the Warriors had together, he was just passing through the Bay Area, a superstar who ultimately wanted something\u2014 perhaps a bigger challenge \u2014 that he couldn\u2019t find with the Warriors. Maybe he discovers that, and more, with Brooklyn.

Curry is coming off his third 40+ point game of the season (tied with Bradley Beal for most in the league), including two of the top three scoring performances of the season (career-high 62 points on Jan. 3, 57 points on Feb. 6). \u2022 Kevin Durant is set to suit up for a game in the Bay Area for the first time in 647 days as his final home game as a member of the Warriors came on May 8, 2019 in Game 5 of the Western Conference Semifinals against Houston at Oracle Arena in Oakland. In his three seasons with the Warriors, Durant played in 208 regular season games and 48 playoff games , winning two championships and two Bill Russell NBA Finals MVP awards. While three seasons was not enough to rank among the Warriors franchise leaders in terms of stat totals, when looking at per-game numbers, Durant fares very well in his 256 games played. In regular season games, Durant ranks 2nd in PPG (25.8), 10th in APG (5.4), 9th in BPG (1.5), 4th in FGM (9.1), 4th in 3PM (2.1), 7th in FTM (5.5). In playoff games, Durant ranks 2nd in PPG (29.6), 10th in APG (4.5), 3rd FGM (10.1), 4th 3PM (2.5), 2nd in FTM (6.9). \u2022 Durant is set to return to the Nets\u2019 lineup for the first time since Feb. 5 . In 18 games this season, Durant is averaging 29.5 points, 7.4 rebounds and 5.2 assists while shooting 52.9% from the field and 44.9% on 5.9 3-point attempts per game. He is averaging 35.9 minutes per game, which is on pace for his highest mark since his MVP season in 2013-14 (38.5 mpg). \u2022 In his first meeting against his former team on opening night (Dec. 22), Durant had 22 points, five rebounds, three assists, three steals and a block in 25 minutes of Brooklyn\u2019s 125-99 rout . While Golden State\u2019s most used defenders on Durant held their own \u2014 Durant had no points on 0-1 shooting in 2:16 (27.5% of matchup time) against Juan Toscano-Anderson, and just two points on 1-2 sooting in 1:47 (21.5% of matchup time) against Kelly Oubre Jr. \u2014 Durant was able to do his damage when matched up with Andrew Wiggins (7 PTS, 2-5 FG, 1-1 3P, 2-2 FT in 1:46) and Eric Paschall (8 PTS, 3-4 FG, 2-2 FT in 0:44). \u2022 Both the Nets and Warriors enter Saturday averaging 14.4 3-pointers made per game, with the Nets holding the edge in 3-point accuracy , hitting 39.6% of their 3-point attempts (4th in NBA), while Golden State shoots 37.6% as a team (11th). \u2022 Individually, Stephen Curry leads all players in 3-pointers made per game (5.0) and total 3-pointers made (131, the only player with 100+ 3PM), and is shooting 43.5% on his 3-point attempts, which ranks 28th in the NBA. For Brooklyn, Joe Harris ranks 11th in 3-pointers made per game (3.3), tied for fourth in total 3-pointers made (89) and third in 3-point percentage (49.2%). Harris has the fewest 3-point attempts (181) of any player ranked in the top 12 in 3-pointers made. \u2022 On Thursday, Stephen Curry joined James Harden as the only players in NBA history to make at least four 3-pointers in 13 straight games , according to the Elias Sports Bureau. Curry can extend the streak to 14 on Saturday when the Warriors host Harden and the Nets. Curry has only six games this seaso n in which he\u2019s made fewer than four 3-pointers; the last time it happened was on Jan. 18 against the Lakers when he shot 3-12 on 3-pointers. \u2022 Draymond Green has tallied 10 or more assists in each of his last five games, all of which he started at center. The only other player to post at least 10 assists in five straight games in which they started at center is Nikola Jokic, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. (Note: starters began being tracked in 1970-71). Green ranks seventh in the NBA in assists at 8.0 per game, which is on pace to set a new career high for the ninth-year forward\/center. Nearly half of Green\u2019s passes (49.6%) and 2.9 of his assists per game go to Stephen Curry, who is shooting 54.4% from the field and 51.4% on 3-pointers off passes from Green. \u2022 This matchup features three of the top eight scorers in the NBA, led by Stephen Curry (30 ppg, 2nd in NBA), followed by Kevin Durant (29.5 ppg, 3rd) and Kyrie Irving (27.9 ppg, 8th). However, neither Durant nor Irving currently meet the games-played minimums to qualify as a league leader (playing at 70%+ a team\u2019s games) as both have only played 18 of Brooklyn\u2019s 27 games (66.7%). Since returning to the Nets lineup on Jan. 20, Irving has averaged a team-high 28.4 points on 53.4% shooting from the field, 39.3% from 3-point range and 93.1% from the free throw line. \u2022 James Harden leads the NBA in assists with 11.0 per game, which would be just shy of his career high of 11.2 from the 2016-17 season with Houston. However, since joining the Nets on Jan. 16, Harden has averaged 11.3 assists per game. Kevin Durant averages 2.2 assists per game from Harden and is shooting 61.4% from the field and 60.0 on 3-pointers off passes from Harden since the two became teammates again in Brooklyn."},{"id":492882,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/pelicans-forward-zion-williamson-shoots-10-for-10-in-1st-half-to-match-rare-feat","date":"2021-02-13","title":"Pelicans forward Zion Williamson shoots 10-for-10 in 1st half to match rare feat","content":"Pelicans forward Zion Williamson enjoyed not just the best first half of his young career Friday against the Mavericks, but one of the best first halves of any young player in recent NBA history.

Williamson finished the half with 23 points, his career high for one half and nearly matching his season scoring average of 23.8 points per game. All 10 of his buckets came at the rim, including four dunks. Williamson finished with 36 points on 14-of-15 shooting, with his lone miss coming from 3-point range.

Getting players into and out of the pared-down and concentrated NBA G League season during a pandemic is expected to significantly reduce the number of assignments and call-ups between the minor league clubs in Orlando and their parent teams. The calendar is tight, with a 15-game regular season that began Wednesday squeezed into 25 days. A single-elimination playoff will begin on March 8 for the top eight teams, with the G Final set for March 11. All of which makes it impossible for someone to experience a season like Toronto\u2019s Bruno Caboclo in 2016-17, when he was sent out to the G League Raptors 905 club 33 times for a total of 105 days. That year, 92 different players were designated for 479 G League assignments. This year, there will be some movement but the majority of players are expected to stay put \u2014 either in the bubble at the ESPN Wide World of Sports complex at the Walt Disney World or with their parent team. Some players working on two-way contracts will get farmed out as is customary for the reps and game experience that makes the G League so helpful to developing young talent. Others will keep working at their team\u2019s NBA facility, providing roster insurance if the health & safety protocols that have sidelined players and postponed games come calling. \u201cWe are conscious about it,\u201d Matt Riccardi, general manager of Brooklyn\u2019s Long Island Nets G League affiliate, told reporters in a recent Zoom call from Florida. \u201cAnd I think every team has a different kind of perspective on what their two-ways are used for and how they are needed on both teams. \u201cThat is something that changes year to year, month by month, day by day, as we go through everything. COVID situation is no different. We are all still trying to figure it out ourselves.\u201d The Cleveland Cavaliers, for instance, have decided to hedge their bets by sending one of their two-way players, center Marques Bolden, into the bubble. The other, forward Lamar Stevens, is sticking with the Cavs as an \u201cin case of emergency\u201d option. \u201cWe\u2019re fairly healthy,\u201d said Mike Gansey, Cleveland\u2019s assistant GM, \u201cbut we always want to make sure we\u2019re leaving Coach [J.B. Bickerstaff] with enough bodies.\u201d A long list of instructions, requirements and quarantines was provided to all 17 participating G League franchises, along with Ignite elite team of top 2021 draft prospects. And they are strict. Entering the bubble for a player sent out on assignment, or clearing it for a call-up to the NBA, will require planning and time. There are expedited vs. general entry or exit rules that differ based on one\u2019s \u201ctier\u201d of involvement, with mandated numbers of negative daily lab-based coronavirus test results required. Previous exposure matters too. For example, a player who has recovered from COVID within 90 days must quarantine in his G League bubble \u2014 \u201cGubble,\u201d many are calling it \u2014 hotel room until he has two consecutive negative tests. Those arriving without a prior case of the virus need to return four consecutive negative tests. Then there is the geography of it all, with the entire enterprise held at the same complex where the NBA completed its 2019-20 regular season and playoffs last summer. According to the protocols set forth by the NBA and the National Basketball Players Association, arrivals and departures are different for those using commercial air travel, private air travel or travel by private car. So these four weeks aren\u2019t going to be simple as driving from Toronto or Chicago to the suburbs to play for Raptors 905 or the Windy City Bulls, respectively. No easy 90-minute hauls from Charlotte to Greensboro or Milwaukee to Oshkosh, either. \u201cWe had 10 guys who we wanted for Canton come to Cleveland, and they had to quarantine in the hotel for a week,\u201d Gansey said. \u201cThen when they got here [Orlando], it was another three or four days. That basically meant two weeks of doing nothing.\u201d All of the restrictions and changes gave several NBA and G League teams enough pause that they aren\u2019t participating in the bubble. Others deliberated whether to go. \u201cAs a group, Mitch [Kupchak], Larry Jordan, myself, and [Greensboro GM] Cam Twiss, we tried to figure out,\u201d said Buzz Peterson, the Charlotte Hornets assistant GM and president of the Greensboro Swarm. \u201cWe said, \u2018All right, 15 games for $500,000 or $700,000 \u2013 is it worth it?\u2019 That focused our thinking: \u2018Should we do it or not.\u2019 \u201cIn the past, what\u2019s really helped us out [with guys like] Devonte\u2019 Graham, Jalen McDaniels, the Martin twins [Caleb and Cody], those guys have really benefitted from playing in Greensboro and coming back. We\u2019ve used it heavily as a development tool. \u201cWhen we didn\u2019t have it this year, we were like, \u2018Oh boy, it hurts.\u2019 Because of the two big kids we signed in Nick Richards and Vernon Carey. We wanted them to spend time down there, just have great years developing.\u201d So the Swarm are in Orlando, coached by Hornets assistant Jay Hernandez. \u201cVery valuable guy,\u201d Peterson said. \u201cHe\u2019s our head guy for development. So it works out perfect to have him with this team. It\u2019s something he wanted to do, to get some head coaching experience. So it was a no-brainer to send him down for six weeks to be with these guys.\u201d The audibles called across the NBA this season \u2014 for scheduling, available players and more \u2014 are every bit as necessary at the G League level. Scouting will be a challenge, with personnel either embedding in the bubble or limited to watching players and games from a distance. \u201cOur scouts are just like you are, wearing the sofa out,\u201d Peterson said. \u201cLarry [Jordan, Charlotte\u2019s director of player personnel] has our pro scouts, Drew Parry and Gary Sacks, assigned to [the G League] games, watching everything on TV just like they were there. \u201cAnd then Larry will go down and watch. But the thing is, they won\u2019t let you get but, like, 25 rows close to the floor.\u201d As scouts throughout the NBA have found, that means missing out on certain intangibles, what Peterson talked of as the communication, intensity and vibe a player brings to the court. \u201cIf I\u2019m sitting 25 rows up, I might as well just sit here in my living room and watch the game,\u201d he said. To meet NBA roster minimums and prepare for an outbreak within the Hornets, Peterson said the team will rotate McDaniels, Richards and Carey in the bubble. Their two-way players, Nate Darling and Grant Riller, will be with the Swarm for the duration, he said. Other teams will deploy their available talent as they see fit. \u201cBut with this COVID stuff, you never know,\u201d Peterson added. \u201cWe\u2019ve told these guys, \u2018Don\u2019t be surprised if you get a call \u2014 boom! \u2014 and you\u2019re out of there. Or you\u2019re going there. We\u2019re all dealing with that right now.\u2019 * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

The second-year guard was flagged after a test result Thursday, then cleared after returning subsequent negative tests. Herro was not permitted to play in Miami\u2019s win over Houston on Thursday night while the matter was sorted out. He then was able to join the team for its flight to Salt Lake City after the game. The reigning Eastern Conference champion Heat, winners of a season-best four straight, play Utah on Saturday night. The Jazz entered Friday with the NBA\u2019s best record; they were to play Milwaukee at home Friday night. Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said he learned Herro would not be available for Thursday\u2019s game \u201c17 seconds before I was going to speak to the team\u201d pregame. Max Strus got the bulk of what would have been Herro\u2019s minutes, scoring a career-high 21 points and helping Miami beat the Rockets 101-94. Herro was tested again Friday morning, part of the usual player routine this season. The Heat announced a few hours later he\u2019s no longer dealing with the protocols. Miami has had 10 of its 17 players miss at least one game this season for virus-related reasons. Jimmy Butler missed a team-high 10 games, Avery Bradley missed eight games and later revealed he tested positive for COVID-19, Kendrick Nunn missed one game because a test result was delayed, and Bam Adebayo, Goran Dragic, Moe Harkless, Udonis Haslem, KZ Okpala and now Herro have missed because of various reasons related to the protocols. \u201cIt\u2019s the norm now,\u201d Butler said after Thursday\u2019s win. \u201cGuys missing games, it\u2019s not a good thing, obviously. \u2026 We know what we\u2019re capable of. We know what we\u2019ve got to do.\u201d Injuries have also been an issue, part of the reason why Miami has used 16 starting lineups through 25 games. Dragic and Bradley, both rotation players, are not with the Heat on their seven-game trip right now because of injuries. Dragic has a sprained ankle and Bradley a strained calf. \u201cLook, we\u2019ve been dealing with this for five weeks,\u201d Spoelstra said. \u201cEverybody has this twisted about this team, saying that there\u2019s a lack of whatever. Whatever the narrative, stupid narrative that\u2019s out there, we have incredible mental toughness and stability in that locker room and as a staff because we\u2019ve been dealing with it. We\u2019re not making any excuses for it. This has been going on for five weeks.

He entered the game as a reserve and then had to depart the game in the third quarter to eventually face seven days of quarantine. Per The Associated Press, Durant drove in a car with a team employee three times last Friday, according to a person with knowledge of the details. The final time was to the arena, where Durant was removed from the starting lineup, later cleared to play and came off the bench for the first time in his career.

Across his last four, the rookie has averaged 18.8 points, 4.8 assists, 3.8 3-pointers and 1.8 steals. Terry Rozier (PG \u2013 CHA) vs. MIN $6,400 Back and healthy in the lineup, Rozier\u2019s minutes and usage aren\u2019t going anywhere. Since returning from a two-game absence, Terry has scored 22.5 ppg (including four 3-poitners per contest) to go with a full line. His price is far too low for this spectacular spot against the Wolves. Al Horford (C \u2013 OKC) at DEN $6,200 Shai Gilgeous-Alexander will sit again due to his knee, and Horford should take on another strong workload. Across his last three games played, the veteran posted 21.7 points, 6.7 rebounds, 6.3 assists and 4.0 combined blocks\/steals per game. Jarrett Allen (PF \u2013 BKN) at POR $6,000 Allen\u2019s shared frontcourt time with Andre Drummond is problematic, but the two have actually started Cleveland\u2019s last two games together. In those contests, Allen has averaged 16.0 points, 7.5 rebounds and 1.5 blocks across 30 minutes per game. At $6K, he\u2019s worth a shot against a soft Portland frontcourt. Buddy Hield (SG \u2013 SAC) vs. ORL $5,900 Just like Haliburton above, shooting guards excel against Orlando and Hield is certainly in play tonight. Both he and Haliburton are logging heavy minutes, and Sacramento\u2019s propensity for deploying three-guard lineups has allowed both players to succeed. Kemba Walker (PG \u2013 BOS) vs. DET $5,500 Across his last four games, Walker is shooting a woeful 31.7% from the floor, but he\u2019s still averaging better than 30 minutes. Will tonight be the night he breaks out of his ice-cold slump? Michael Porter (SF \u2013 DEN) vs. OKC $5,500 In his third game back in the starting lineup, Porter posted a big 19\/5\/2 stat line to go with two blocks and two steals. He\u2019s another guy I\u2019ll shy away from in cash lineups given his high and low swings throughout the season, but the upside \u2014 especially in this matchup \u2014 is undeniable. Carmelo Anthony (PF \u2013 POR) vs. CLE $5,300 Melo has been scoring like the Melo of old recently, going for at least 21 points in three of his last four games. After moving into 12th place on the NBA\u2019s all-time scoring list, he\u2019ll look to keep his offense rolling in another solid matchup with Cleveland. Kenrich Williams (SF \u2013 NOP) at DEN $5,200 Williams has been stellar for the Thunder, averaging 34 minutes across his last four games (three starts).

Utah Jazz guard Donovan Mitchell broke it down as best he could Tuesday, when asked what type of player deserves mention in the conversation regarding the Kia MVP. Keep in mind, he\u2019d just carried Utah to its fifth straight win and 16 th in its last 17 outings against a formidable Boston Celtics squad. He scored a game-high 36 points with nine assists while dominating the last 5 minutes and 25 seconds by scoring 10 of the team\u2019s final 18 points, while dishing dimes for the other eight. Leery of the question posed by Sarah Todd of the Deseret News , Mitchell paused for a tick. \u201cI think first and foremost, the biggest thing is team play,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cIt\u2019s the MVP award for sure, but you don\u2019t get there without a team, and we\u2019ve been playing well. I think for me, looking at it as on the best team, we\u2019re doing our thing, we have a lot of room for improvement. But we\u2019re definitely doing our thing right now, just making plays. It\u2019s not necessarily having 35 [points], 10 [rebounds], and 10 [assists]. It\u2019s doing whatever is needed. And I feel like my teammates trust me. I trust them. And I\u2019m not worried about it. I know what it is. [I\u2019ve] been here four years and the fans know that we don\u2019t necessarily get all the credit we deserve, and that\u2019s not just singling out me. \u201cI feel like we use that as a chip on our shoulder,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m just very fortunate to be in this position where my teammates trust me to go make plays like that. The other stuff, if it happens, it happens. I think the biggest thing is winning. Winning takes care of everything. Winning heals everything. The outside stuff is what it is. It\u2019s not up to me. I\u2019m just going to go out there and be the best teammate I can be and go from there.\u201d I tried very hard to get Donovan Mitchell to subtly say that he deserves to be in the MVP conversation. It almost kinda maybe worked? pic.twitter.com\/ndMCOfAVw8 \u2014 Sarah Todd (@NBASarah) February 10, 2021 He\u2019s not wrong here, nor is anybody else voicing strong opinions about what\u2019s shaping up to be one of the tightest races for the MVP award in recent memory. With Mitchell as the headliner, the Jazz head into Friday\u2019s game against Milwaukee with the NBA\u2019s best record. He\u2019s averaged 28.6 points, 6.2 assists, 4.8 rebounds and 1.2 steals during Utah\u2019s five-game winning streak. Still, it won\u2019t move up Mitchell in this week\u2019s Kia Race to the MVP Ladder, which is a testament to the quality of the field. LeBron James remains No. 1 with a couple of changes in the hierarchy of the second and third tier of candidates. Will Utah be able to maintain its perch atop the West all season? Stephen Curry moves up some after lighting up Orlando for 40 points Thursday in his 17 th career game and second this season with 10 or more 3-pointers , before he walked off the floor like this . Damian Lillard creeps up, too, after putting up 19 of his 30 points in the first quarter of an overtime win over Joel Embiid and the 76ers, while Jazz big man Rudy Gobert makes his Ladder debut. And now, the Top 5 this week in the 2020-21 Kia Race to the MVP Ladder: Season stats: 25.5 ppg, 7.9 rpg, 7.9 apg Last week\u2019s ranking: No. 1 The minutes are piling up, but 36-year-old LeBron James is still producing at an elite level for the Lakers. James didn\u2019t shoot it particularly well in Wednesday\u2019s overtime win against the Thunder, but he came through in the clutch . He\u2019s a big reason the Lakers are still riding a season-high six-game win streak, as they\u2019ve captured wins in nine of their last 11 games. In all three of Los Angeles\u2019 OT wins this season, James clocked in with at least 40 minutes, making him the first player age 35 or older in league history to play 40-plus minutes in three straight OT victories. Season stats: 29.1 ppg, 11.0 rpg, 1.3 bpg, 1.3 spg Last week\u2019s ranking: No. 2 Philadelphia's star center finished with 35 points in a loss to the Blazers on Thursday. Embiid ran off to another fast start against Portland with 23 points in the first two quarters for his NBA-best eighth game this season with 20-plus points in the first half, before scoring just 12 more in the second half of Thursday\u2019s OT loss. He\u2019s scored 25-plus points in 10 consecutive games, becoming just the fourth 76er to accomplish that feat . The loss to Portland marked the first time Philadelphia suffered a defeat this season with its full starting lineup of Embiid, Ben Simmons, Tobias Harris, Seth Curry and Danny Green. Last week\u2019s ranking: No. 3 Season stats: 26.9 ppg, 11.3 rpg, 8.6 apg, 1.6 spg Take a super slow-mo look back at the best plays and moments from Nikola Jokic's career-best game. The day after last week\u2019s Kia MVP Ladder dropped, Jokic hit Sacramento with a 50-piece despite the Nuggets missing their starting back court. The 50 points represented a career-high, but Jokic also contributed 12 assists, eight rebounds and three blocks to become the first center since Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (1975) to put up 50 points and 10-plus assists. Jokic enters Friday\u2019s game against OKC ( 9 ET, NBA League Pass ) averaging 32.3 points in his last three games, but the Nuggets need to stack some wins as they\u2019ve lost three of their last four. Last week\u2019s ranking: No. 4 Season stats: 29.5 ppg, 7.4 rpg, 5.2 apg The Nets' star has scored 20 or more points in every game he's played so far in 2020-21. In an MVP field this competitive, you can\u2019t miss games unnecessarily. But Durant gets a pass here because of the reasoning behind his absence . Durant is expected to return Saturday against his former team, the Golden State Warriors. Durant hasn\u2019t played with James Harden and Kyrie Irving since Brooklyn\u2019s Feb. 5 loss to the Toronto Raptors. When KD misses time, the return games are scary. In the four contests this season he\u2019s played coming off missed games, he\u2019s averaged 34.3 points, shooting 54.3% from the field, 41.7% from deep and 90.7% from the free-throw line. Last week\u2019s ranking: No. 5 Season stats: 26.5 ppg, 5.9 rpg, 5.1 apg, 1.8 spg Kawhi Leonard dropped 36 points on Minnesota to fuel the Clippers' win. Coming off 17-of-40 shooting and 0 of 7 on 3-pointers in two straight losses, Leonard racked up a season-high 36 points Wednesday against Minnesota to help the Clippers snap their skid. Going into Friday\u2019s game in Chicago ( 8 ET, NBA League Pass ), Leonard is averaging 28.2 points through his first five games of February. The Clippers will need to lean on him more with Paul George (right toe) out for the current road trip. Leonard has a reputation as a closer, but we need to see more in winning time since he\u2019s 4-6 this season in clutch situations. 6. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks 7.

LeBron is back where he belongs. Or, at least, where he\u2019s accustomed to being and we\u2019re accustomed to seeing him in this All-Star voting thingamajig. Last week, Kevin Durant ranked first overall in votes, though his position had at least a little to do with getting out of the Western Conference and having an MVP-level season so far in his comeback with the Brooklyn Nets. Durant\u2019s lead over LeBron after Week 1 was a mere 14,029 votes, just 0.6% of his total. James\u2019 advantage over Durant in Week 2 was 10 times the size of last week\u2019s gap \u2013 149,129 \u2013 vaulting him to the status of top vote-getter with a week to go. That\u2019s a perch James has enjoyed seven times previously in his All-Star career, good for second place all-time behind Michael Jordan\u2019s nine since fan voting began in 1975. 2. Too early to call some races? Premature prognostication can be downright embarrassing. In this particular case, we\u2019ve got an unknown number of votes still to be cast and counted. We\u2019d hate to discourage some voters from exercising their James Naismith-given right. We\u2019d hate even more to guess wrong. Still, some outcomes are looking awfully certain. James and Durant are locks to be voted as starters in the West and East frontcourts, respectively. The Lakers superstar already has more than three times the number of votes than the No. 4 finisher last year, Nikola Jokic, garnered. The 2020 fourth-place finisher in the East, Jimmy Butler, wound up with nearly 1.5 million fewer votes than Durant already has. Fact is, the entire East frontcourt seems pretty set. After the likely starting front line of Durant, Giannis Antetokounmpo and Joel Embiid, the step down to Jayson Tatum at No. 4 is more than 1.3 million votes. Put another way, Tatum has only 56% of No. 3 Embiid\u2019s vote total. That\u2019s a lot of ground to make up. Out West, the jockeying behind James looks to be limited to three guys in search of two starter spots. Denver\u2019s Jokic (3,006,981) has the sixth-most votes through two weeks of returns, with the Clippers\u2019 Kawhi Leonard (2,462,621) and the Lakers\u2019 Anthony Davis (2,329,371) tightly grouped for the next two spots. From there, the step down to Leonard\u2019s teammate Paul George is a considerable 1,305,138 votes, more than double what it was last week. It raises the question, which L.A. fanbase will be able to power their star into the final three? 3. Beal winning, Wizards less so. Granted, it is more of a coaches\u2019 thing than a fans\u2019 thing that All-Stars are best drawn from teams with winning records. The people want what they want, and in the case of Bradley Beal\u2019s mounting lead as the top vote-getter among East backcourt players, they might get exactly that. Washington won only one of four games since last week\u2019s returns were made public. Beal sagged, too, averaging 24.3 points on 37.5% shooting overall and 22.2% on 3-pointers. But it didn\u2019t matter to those casting ballots \u2013 the 6-foot-3 shooting guard and two-time All-Star still leads the NBA in scoring at a gaudy 32.8 ppg, and that was good enough for the fans. Beal\u2019s lead over Brooklyn\u2019s Kyrie Irving expanded from 180,206 to 424,589. Irving (2,104,130) and Nets mate James Harden (1,829,504) appear to be locked into an either-or battle for the East\u2019s second backcourt spot. Boston\u2019s Jaylen Brown (1,062,888) is the only other guard in the East for now with more than 1 million votes. In the West, it\u2019s Golden State\u2019s Steph Curry (4,033,050) with what probably is an insurmountable total. Then Dallas\u2019 Luka Doncic (2,484,552) and Portland\u2019s Damian Lillard (2,095,157) playing musical chairs for the final seat. Utah\u2019s Donovan Mitchell (479,241) is in fourth place and would need to double and double again his total, just to see Doncic and Lillard from where he\u2019d be sitting. 4. Double the time, double the votes. OK, so it\u2019s not a triple-double and not even a double-double. But 19 of the players who ranked among the Top 10 vote getters at their positions last week doubled their totals by this week. In the West, 10 players enjoyed 100+% boosts, six of them in the backcourt. In the East, the breakdown was nine overall and seven in the frontcourt. None of them, of course, was the leading vote-getter in his category, since the huge number of ballots cast already for James, Durant, Curry and Beal make it exceedingly difficult to double. There weren\u2019t even any place changes in the two conferences\u2019 Frontcourt returns. Same 10 players, same 10 spots, with only the vote totals ticking up. The backcourts offered a bit more maneuvering. In the East, Toronto\u2019s Fred VanVleet \u2013 as predicted here! \u2013 opened enough voters eyes with his 54-point explosion against Orlando Feb. 2 to snag the 10th spot. That mean Philadelphia\u2019s Ben Simmons dropped down. Out West, Mitchell rode Utah\u2019s 20-5 start to a flip-flop with Memphis\u2019 Ja Morant, the Jazz guard moving to No. 4 and Morant to No. 5. Meanwhile, OKC\u2019s Shai Gilgeous-Alexander dropped out of the Top 10 while dealing with a knee injury and playing only two of the Thunder\u2019s five most recent games. Who snuck in for the open spot? Lakers guard Alex Caruso, who has been hurt lately too. He\u2019s averaging 5.5 points, 2.1 assists and 18.6 minutes while coming off the bench for all 19 appearances. 5. Klay makes his move. It was duly noted last week that Golden State\u2019s Klay Thompson was benefiting from some combination of loyalty, habit and chicanery by showing up in the No. 10 spot among West backcourt players. Remember, Thompson hasn\u2019t played in an NBA game since June 13, 2019, Game 6 of The Finals against Toronto, the night he suffered a torn ACL in his left knee. He missed all of last season, then wiped out this season with a torn right Achilles injury at a November workout. Didn\u2019t matter to the voters. Thompson\u2019s total shot up from 99,094 to 225,169 and he went from 10th place to No. 8 in the West. It\u2019s hard to know exactly what\u2019s driving the Thompson candidacy. Name recognition? Voter loyalty? Or an alternative to the Nielsen TV ratings system from folks who were delighted by the return of \u201cSideline Klay\u201d during the broadcast of the Warriors\u2019 game against Detroit a couple weeks ago? * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

During the streak, Kelly Olynyk has averaged 17.3 points on 61.3% shooting from the field, 54.2% on 3-pointers , and has scored at least 15 points in each game. This season, the Heat are 7-1 when Olynyk scores 15 or more points. \u2022 Houston enters Thursday looking to snap a three-game losing streak that includes the team\u2019s two most lopsided defeats of the season as they fell to Charlotte by 25 and New Orleans by 29 on back-to-back nights this week. The Rockets have averaged 100.3 points over the past three games, down nearly 11 points from their 111.2 ppg through the first 21 games of the season. \u2022 Duncan Robinson ranks 11th in the NBA with 3.3 3-pointers made per game. His 39.4% shooting on 3-pointers (72nd in NBA) this season is down 5.2 percentage points from last season\u2019s 44.6% (4th in NBA). A contributing factor to this drop is the attention Robinson is getting from opposing defenses this season. Last season, 67.3% of Robinson\u2019s 3-point attempts came with the closest defender at least four feet away. This season that percentage has dropped to 58.1% . \u2022 The Rockets rank third in the NBA in scoring on isolation plays at 9.9 points per game with an effective field goal percentage of 46.6% (13th in NBA). The Heat allow the fourth-most points on isolation plays (7.4 ppg) and the third-highest eFG% (51.4%). \u2022 Miami\u2019s Tyler Herro ranks fourth in the league in distance traveled per game (2.77 miles) and third in average speed (4.62 miles per hour). Herro ranks sixth among guards in contested shots (7.3 per game).  10 p.m. ET, TNT \u2022 The Sixers enter Thursday having won two straight and six of their last seven , with their lone loss during that stretch coming against Portland on Feb. 4. Carmelo Anthony and Gary Trent Jr. combined for 46 points to lead the short-handed Blazers (no Damian Lillard or CJ McCollum) to a 121-105 win despite 37 points from Joel Embiid. Enes Kanter grabbed 18 rebounds to help Portland to a 53-37 advantage on the boards and 22-8 edge in second-chance points. \u2022 Ben Simmons leads the NBA in deflections (4.0 per game) and ranks sixth in steals (1.7 per game). The Sixers rank seventh in opponent turnovers per game (15.3) and convert those miscues into 17.3 points off turnovers per game. \u2022 Portland\u2019s Gary Trent Jr. scores 0.482 points per touch , the highest mark among the 223 players that average at least 20 minutes per game so far this season. Joel Embiid leads the Sixers at 0.396 points per touch (25th among qualified players). \u2022 The Sixers are a league-best 11-1 in games that feature clutch time (score inside five points in final five minutes), outscoring their opponents by 51 points in 44 clutch minutes.

Before the next rankings drop on Monday, here are some of the storylines he\u2019s keeping an eye on this weekend. With apologies to Bill Parcells , a team\u2019s record doesn\u2019t tell us the whole story. On Wednesday, we passed the 1\/3 mark of the season, with 368 of 1,080 games played. We\u2019ve learned from history that a team\u2019s record after 20 games can tell us a lot . In the 20 full (82-game) seasons from 1997-98 to 2018-19, 92% of the teams that won at least 12 of their first 20 games made the playoffs. On the other end of the spectrum, only 9% of teams that won fewer than eight of their first 20 games would go on to reach the postseason. But this season is unique in a number of ways. And beyond the pandemic-related issues, the playoff system is different. Instead of a hard cut-off after the top eight teams in each conference, there\u2019s a cut-off after the top six (those that automatically qualify for the playoffs) and another after teams 7-10 (aka \u201cthe Play-In Club\u201d). Through Wednesday\u2019s games, the Eastern Conference has the 11th-place Miami Heat within a game and a half of the Toronto Raptors, who are suddenly in fifth place with a 12-13 record. In the West, only two and a half games separate the fifth-place Blazers (13-10) from the 13th-place Houston Rockets (11-13). To help us delineate one team hovering around .500 from another, we can look at a handful of numbers that might tell us just how real their record is: (* There\u2019s some overlap between the second and third items above. If you\u2019ve played a tougher schedule, you\u2019ve probably played the better shooting teams.) To get a better idea of which teams might be due for a surge and which records might be a tad inflated, we ranked them all in regard to the four factors above and totaled those rankings up. For health, we looked at games missed by the team\u2019s top eight players in minutes per game, weighted for the top four (so a Karl-Anthony Towns absence counts more than a Mike Scott absence). Players out for the season (i.e. Spencer Dinwiddie) were not counted, because they wouldn\u2019t affect future performance. Players who haven\u2019t played yet, but will likely be in the top eight when they do (i.e. Jaren Jackson Jr.) were counted. Here are the 3 teams showing the most signs that they\u2019re better than their record: 1. Indiana (12-13) \u2013 T.J. Warren has played in just four games, and Caris LeVert has yet to play for his new team. The Pacers rank 25th in opponent 3-point percentage, so they could see better results going forward. Their point differential says they should have one additional victory and they\u2019ve played one of the league\u2019s 10 toughest schedules. Their game in Detroit on Thursday is the start of five straight against teams no better than the 11-13 Hawks and Rockets. 2. Detroit (6-18) \u2013 The Pistons have the league\u2019s second worst record, but they\u2019ve played its toughest schedule (they have wins over the Celtics, Suns, Sixers, Lakers and Nets) and they have the point differential of a team that\u2019s 8-16. They\u2019re 2-12 in games that were within five points in the last five minutes and 4-6 otherwise. 3. Memphis (10-10) \u2013 The Grizzlies have played the league\u2019s sixth toughest schedule and have had some bad luck with opponent shooting, ranking 28th in opponent 3-point percentage. They\u2019ve also been without Jackson for the entire year and Ja Morant for eight of their 20 games. The next three: Denver (second toughest schedule, two fewer wins than their point differential would indicate), Minnesota (Towns has played in just five games, relatively tough schedule), and Dallas (tough schedule, health issues). Here are the 3 teams showing the most signs that they\u2019re not as good as their record: 1. Utah (20-5) \u2013 The Jazz have established themselves as a contender, but have been fortunate in regard to health, with just 10 total games missed from their top eight guys. They rank fifth in opponent 3-point percentage and have played one of the league\u2019s 10 easiest schedules, with 15 of their 25 games having come against teams that currently have losing records. 2. L.A. Lakers (20-6) \u2013 The Lakers rank third in opponent 3-point percentage, so we could see some slippage from that No. 1 defense at some point. They\u2019ve been very healthy and have played a relatively easy schedule, with 16 of their 26 games having come against teams that are currently at or below .500. 3. Orlando (9-16) \u2013 We\u2019re not counting injuries to Markelle Fultz and Jonathan Isaac, because those guys aren\u2019t coming back this season. The Magic have had injury issues beyond those two, but they\u2019ve played the league\u2019s second easiest schedule and have the point differential of a team that\u2019s 6-19. The next three: Philadelphia (league\u2019s easiest schedule to date), and Phoenix (relatively easy schedule, luck with opponent shooting), New York (first in opponent 3-point percentage, sixth in opponent free throw percentage), and Oklahoma City (10-14, with the point differential of a team that\u2019s 7-17). With their win in Sacramento on Tuesday, the Philadelphia 76ers are 14-0 when they\u2019ve had their full starting lineup. When one or more of their five starters has been out, the Sixers are 4-7, with the most recent of those losses having come last Thursday, when, playing without Ben Simmons, they lost at home to the Portland Trail Blazers, who were without Damian Lillard. Overall, the Sixers have been better on defense ( where they rank second ) than on offense ( 13th ). But that starting lineup has rather potent offensively. The 120.1 points per 100 possessions that the Sixers\u2019 starting lineup has scored ranks third among 23 lineups that have played at least 100 minutes this season. It has the second highest turnover rate among the 23 (15.6 per 100 possessions), but the second highest free throw rate (33.1 attempts per 100 shots from the field) and, most important, the highest effective field goal percentage (60.8%). Interestingly, where the Sixers\u2019 starting lineup has been most potent is outside the paint. On shots from outside the paint, the league average effective field goal percentage is 51.9%, while the Sixers\u2019 starting lineup\u2019s is 64.1%. The lineup has shot 42-for-77 (54.5%) from mid-range and 78-for-171 (45.6%) from 3-point range, including 25-for-50 (50%) on corner 3-pointers. Sixers\u2019 shooters from outside the paint with the starting lineup: With other lineups: Those numbers are likely unsustainable. But the shooters obviously benefit from Ben Simmons (who leads the league with 97 assists on 3-pointers) bending the defense with his pushes in transition and from Joel Embiid drawing attention in the post . The Sixers also avoid stagnation. They rank seventh in ball movement (350 passes per 24 minutes of possession), having seen the fifth biggest jump from last season (333, 14th). They\u2019re in the middle of the pack in regard to player movement (11.2 miles traveled per 24 minutes of possession, 18th), but have seen an increase there as well. And with that starting group, there can be a clear intention of moving the ball from side to side. Here, as the ball moves to the left side of the floor and Harris comes out of the corner for a handoff from Embiid, Green clears to the right side, removing a defender and giving Embiid a clear roll to the rim \u2026 The Sixers\u2019 four-game trip only gets tougher as it goes . They\u2019ll have an opportunity for revenge against the Blazers in Portland on Thursday ( 10 p.m. ET, TNT ). They\u2019re in Phoenix on Saturday ( 3 p.m. ET, NBA TV ) and complete the trip in Utah on Monday ( 9 p.m. ET, League Pass ). It was noted in this week\u2019s Power Rankings that the Brooklyn Nets had, not surprisingly, seen drops in ball and player movement since acquiring James Harden. But on the other side of that trade, the Houston Rockets haven\u2019t exactly turned into the 2014 Spurs. At the time of the trade (through Jan. 13), the Rockets ranked 27th in ball movement (313 passes per 24 minutes of possession) and last in player movement (10.4 miles traveled per 24 minutes of possession). They have seen increases in both, but since Jan. 14, they rank just 23rd (317) and 28th (10.8). The Rockets have a couple of guys \u2013 David Nwaba and Jae\u2019Sean Tate \u2013 who play with a ton of energy, but there can still be some standing around in their offense. This was an after-timeout possession in their ugly loss in Charlotte on Monday \u2026 Houston hasn\u2019t had much continuity. Since Victor Oladipo made his Rockets debut on Jan. 18, only Tate, DeMarcus Cousins and P.J. Tucker have played in all 13 of their games . John Wall and Oladipo have played just 102 minutes together and just 53 minutes with Christian Wood, who\u2019s currently out with an ankle injury. So it\u2019s understandable that guys aren\u2019t yet on the same page. It can\u2019t be forgotten that the Rockets rank fourth defensively , second (105.8 points allowed per 100 possessions) since the Harden trade . But their last two games (losses in Charlotte and New Orleans) have been their two worst defensive games of the season ( 126 per 100 allowed over the two games), and if you\u2019re looking for a free-flowing offense unencumbered from Harden\u2019s isolation game, you may have to wait a while. The Rockets should have both Wall and Oladipo in the lineup when they host the Heat on Thursday ( 7:30 p.m. ET, TNT ). LaMelo Ball takes some chances with his passing. Late in the first quarter of their win over Houston on Monday, the not-so-mobile DeMarcus Cousins was able to leave his man and easily intercept a lob pass from Ball to Miles Bridges. In the fourth quarter, the Hornets ran the same play and Ball was able to squeeze the pass between Tate and Mason Jones \u2026 But later in the fourth, as the Hornets were blowing the game open, Ball showed a little more caution. Bismack Biyombo was running free down the right side of the floor, but Ball waited until Biyombo (only 28, but not quite as explosive or coordinated as Bridges) had both feet under him before tossing a more cautious lob \u2026 Perhaps Ball was a little more prudent in that situation because he was looking for assist No. 10. Ball\u2019s 31 assists to Bridges ( watch them all here ) are the most he has to a single teammate (he also has 30 to Gordon Hayward), but aren\u2019t enough to crack the top 25 in regard to most assists from one player to a single teammate. Here\u2019s the top 15, headlined by a pairing featured in this space last week , along with the rate of assists per 36 minutes on the floor together: Most assists from one player to a single teammate, 2020-21 MIN = Minutes on the floor together Per 36 = Assists per 36 minutes on the floor together * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

Apparently so, as he\u2019s averaged 28 minutes per contest over his last three while double-doubling in every outing. Coach Nick Nurse has spurned hopeful fantasy managers repeatedly this season by limiting Boucher\u2019s minutes without a moment\u2019s notice. He\u2019s a huge upside play in tournaments but one who comes with plenty of risk. Josh Jackson (SG \u2013 DET) : $5,500 vs. IND Jackson has averaged just under 32 FD points across his last five games, taking on a prominent role in the Pistons\u2019 offense. He\u2019s not a sexy name, but he continues to put up quality numbers for a team in desperate need of playmakers. It\u2019s hard not to gravitate to a guy with 40-point upside priced way down at $5.5K. Terrence Ross (SG \u2013 ORL) : $5,200 at GSW Ross has tremendous scoring upside, but his floor is one of the lowest in the league. With Orlando missing Aaron Gordon and potentially Evan Fournier and Cole Anthony, Ross could help fill the scoring void in a solid spot against the Dubs. Juan Toscano-Anderson (SF \u2013 GSW) : $5,200 vs. ORL Toscano-Anderson continues to play heavy minutes in Golden State\u2019s rotation, and until his price goes up significantly, I\u2019m going to keep rolling with him as a clear value. In four starts over the last week, he\u2019s averaged 8.8 points, 9.3 boards, and 3.0 dimes. Kelly Olynyk (C \u2013 MIA) : $5,100 at HOU Olynyk is a guy to look at in cash lineups, as his FD points have been in the mid-20s in each of his last four games. The big man has seen some increased run for Miami, and the excellent matchup with Houston should only bolster his already-secure floor. Kendrick Nunn (PG \u2013 MIA) : $5,000 at HOU With Goran Dragic out, Nunn should again be in the starting lineup. The matchup with Houston is favorable, and while Nunn can run hot-and-cold, he\u2019s liable to go off for a huge performance on any given night. Chuma Okeke (PF \u2013 ORL) : $4,800 at GSW Okeke has scored 46.4 FD points across 49 minutes across his last two games, and he\u2019s done a bit of everything in the box score over that span. Tonight\u2019s matchup with Golden State\u2019s depleted frontcourt offers a great opportunity for the 2019 first-round pick. Derrick Jones (SF \u2013 POR) : $4,500 vs. PHI Jones is back and shouldn\u2019t have a minutes restriction tonight in a favorable matchup. In his last game out, he went 8\/10 across 29 minutes. He\u2019s certainly a guy to roster in some tournament lineups. Frank Mason (PG \u2013 ORL) : $4,200 at GSW Cole Anthony is questionable tonight, and Mason is in line to start if the former is unable to go. I\u2019ll make sure to have some shares in tournament lineups tonight. Eric Paschall (C \u2013 GSW) : $4,200 vs. ORL Paschall has seen limited run in his last two games back, but he posted 25.2 FD points across 15 minutes against the Spurs on Tuesday. He\u2019s not a guy I\u2019ll look to in cash games, but he deserves some consideration in tournaments given his per-minute upside."},{"id":491984,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/raptors-to-finish-2020-21-season-in-tampa","date":"2021-02-11","title":"Raptors to finish 2020-21 season in Tampa","content":" The Toronto Raptors will play the rest of their home games in 2020-21 at Tampa\u2019s Amalie Arena. The Toronto Raptors aren\u2019t going back to Toronto this season. Ongoing challenges related to the coronavirus pandemic and how that affects the process of crossing the border between the U.S. and Canada will keep the Raptors in their adopted Tampa, Florida, home for the remainder of the regular season, the team said Thursday. \u201cIt took us a while to get settled in,\u201d Raptors coach Nick Nurse said Thursday before Toronto played at Boston. \u201cI think to pick up shop and go back and try to re-settle in, kind of like you would at the start of the fall \u2026 we\u2019re just kind of getting settled in, we might as well finish it out now.\u201d The Raptors are 6-5 in their \u201chome\u201d building this season, Amalie Arena, which they\u2019re sharing with the Stanley Cup champion Tampa Bay Lightning. Tampa also has the reigning Super Bowl champion Buccaneers and the Tampa Bay Rays played in the World Series last season. \u201cFlorida has been really welcoming to us and we\u2019re so grateful for the hospitality we\u2019ve found in Tampa and at Amalie \u2014 we\u2019re living in a city of champions, and we intend to carry on the tradition of winning for our new friends and fans here,\u201d Raptors President Masai Ujiri said. \u201cBut home is where the heart is, and our hearts are in Toronto. We think often of our fans, of our Scotiabank Arena family, and all those we are missing back home, and we can\u2019t wait until we can all be together again.\u201d The decision is hardly unexpected given the state of the pandemic in the U.S. and Canada. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced Tuesday that starting next week any nonessential travelers arriving in Canada by land will need to show a negative PCR-based COVID-19 test or face a fine if they don\u2019t have one. That wouldn\u2019t be an issue for NBA teams; traveling parties are tested daily, players multiple times a day. The bigger issue is logistics. The land border already remains closed to nonessential travelers who are not Canadian citizens; Canada requires those entering the country to isolate for 14 days, which wouldn\u2019t be feasible for NBA teams, and the Canadian government has also strongly discouraged nonessential travel for any reason. Toronto made the move south last fall, knowing Thursday\u2019s decision was a real possibility. The Raptors haven\u2019t played in Toronto since Feb. 28, 2020; they had just finished a five-game trip when last season was suspended for the pandemic on March 11, then went to the NBA\u2019s restart bubble at Walt Disney World in Lake Buena Vista, Florida for the end of the regular season and the playoffs. If the Raptors play their full allotment of 72 games this season and then go into the postseason this spring, it will mean Toronto will have played at least 100 straight games outside of Toronto. \u201cHope we can get back there and start next season from Day 1, for sure,\u201d Nurse said. The Raptors tried to simulate the comforts the team has at home in Toronto, at least as much as possible. \u201cWe The North\u201d \u2014 the team motto \u2014 signage is everywhere in the hotel that the Raptors are using as a practice facility in Tampa, from the elevator doors to the ballroom wall behind one of the baskets. The court that the Raptors use for games was shipped down from Toronto. And there\u2019s a 2019 world championship banner swaying from the rafters, alongside the Lightning\u2019s retired jerseys for Vincent Lecavalier and Martin St. Louis, at the same end of the court as the Raptors\u2019 bench. \u201cThey did a great job,\u201d Raptors guard Fred VanVleet said earlier this season. The NBA is preparing to release the schedule for the second half of the season \u2014 mid-March through mid-May \u2014 later this month. The playoffs will run from mid-May through mid-July."},{"id":491781,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/qa-tobias-harris-on-76ers-father-figures-and-the-tuskegee-airmen","date":"2021-02-11","title":"Q&A: Tobias Harris on 76ers, father figures and the Tuskegee Airmen","content":"If you haven\u2019t noticed, there\u2019s an Eastern Conference takeover in progress here as mid-season approaches, and the Philadelphia 76ers are behaving as though this isn\u2019t a temporary development. Showing plenty of grit and a renewed sense of confidence, the Sixers are aiming to put distance between themselves and the other contenders. In the \u2026 process, that should help further distance themselves from their last year\u2019s disappointing playoff exit. Plenty of changes happened in the aftermath to help the Sixers right now \u2014 Doc Rivers became the coach, Daryl Morey the president and Joel Embiid decided to go full beast-mode \u2014 but another factor cannot be overlooked. Tobias Harris is having himself quite a season \u2014 the best, actually, of this 10-year career. He\u2019s become a problem for the other bench, more forceful and more comfortable here in his second full season in Philly. Harris is providing an ample source of the outside shooting the Sixers so desperately crave, and doing it with amazing consistency and reliability: 20.3 points per game on 51.5% overall and 43.8% from deep. He\u2019s also one of the better rebounding forwards, pulling down 7.5 per game. Yes, on most nights, Embiid is the heavy for the Sixers. Yet Harris is thriving and willing and able to provide important buckets and moments when needed. It\u2019s why Harris is, and should be, a candidate for All-Star consideration in 2021. Aside from his current production, he bounced back terrifically from last season\u2019s playoffs in the bubble, where the Sixers were dismissed in a first-round sweep and Harris struggled with the jumper, hitting just 38.3% overall and 13.3% on 3-pointers. Harris is also one of the league\u2019s most conscientious players, always managing to say and do the right things, an inspiration to his teammates and easy on his coach. In that sense, he\u2019s worry-free and low-maintenance. After a career launched in Milwaukee before detouring through Orlando, Detroit and L.A. with the Clippers, Harris has found a safe spot in Philly, where the team and player seem comfortable with each other, especially now, as they enjoy the view from the East penthouse. Here\u2019s a Q-and-A with Harris where he touches upon a variety of topics that are meaningful to him, and the last question is a really big one \u2014 7-foot-4 even: Q: The strong start by the Sixers is generously caused by your performance. What\u2019s going right for you? A: Just me getting to my spots on the floor, the system and the structure here has been great for my game and the way I play, the hard work I put in throughout the off-season to be the best player I can be for our team to win. When you win, things are a lot better. And I\u2019m being efficient out there is a result of all of those things adding up. Speaking of the offseason, it was so short and unusual, given the pandemic. How did you manage to put in a plan, given all that? After the bubble I took a month off, then got straight back after it. I changed things in my game where I needed to get better at. To be as efficient as possible. The playoffs were disappointing in the way we went out. I really got back to the drawing board with the fundamentals. I wanted to get better in all areas \u2014 shooting, 3-point percentage, trying to get to the free-throw line, midrange game and isolation situations. Defensively, I wanted to get better. Usually, with a normal off-season, you can go 5-on-5, but I wasn\u2019t trying to risk that with the virus. It was strategic in the way I had to train. I was with my strength coach back home in New York, my basketball trainer back home, getting me to be quicker, explosive, faster and more efficient in my movements on the floor and it\u2019s really paid off. Is it just a coincidence that all of this is falling in place with Doc Rivers as your coach again? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a coincidence. Coach knows my game, he knows things that I do very well. When we were in L.A., he was the coach who put me in those positions, so he\u2019s doing the same thing here. He\u2019s always pushing me to be better and be decisive on the court, be a leader for our team and be my best self night in and night out. He expects a lot of me and that\u2019s what I want as a player. How Doc Rivers has impacted the 76ers since taking over. You and Doc shared something in common in the bubble in that both of you finished your seasons disappointingly. Had Doc and the Clippers not gone out that way, he probably wouldn\u2019t be your coach now. Do you think about that weird fate? I do. But things happen the way they\u2019re supposed to happen. I\u2019m happy he\u2019s here coaching this team and you could see it working for both sides, him being a coach and us as a collective group. After the experience what we both had in the bubble, us with the Sixers and him with the Clippers, we want to be in position to win a championship together. What would it mean if you\u2019re selected as an All-Star, which would be your first? It would mean a lot. When I was in L.A., I thought for sure I was playing at an All-Star level. The team was playing for first in the West, and then about a month before All-Star, the team slipped down to about seventh and I missed the game. I felt I didn\u2019t make the game because we weren\u2019t a top team in the West. But here we are this year sitting at No. 1, I\u2019m playing the best basketball of my career. So it would mean a whole lot, that the work I put in, the time and due diligence I put toward the game and my body and a good teammate and a player, is paying off. I\u2019m playing at that level consistently. It would be great to be rewarded for that. Do the Sixers have a \u2018Big Three\u2019? Oh, 100 percent. But we\u2019re also one of those teams where we really don\u2019t care about what people have to say. I think we came under the radar this season \u2026 we\u2019re fine with that. You can see we have a Big Three for sure. Tobias Harris\u2019 grandfather served as one of the Tuskegee Airmen. I noticed you\u2019re a scorer who\u2019s comfortable at various spots on the floor, not just at the 3-point line and the rim. Why has the mid-range shot become a lost art? Just the way the game is shaped now, where the 3-ball is king. That\u2019s not to say it\u2019s not right; if you\u2019re an efficient shooter from 3, why not let it go? It\u2019s simple math. But I also know myself, how I grew up playing, guys I watched, I modeled my game after: Carmelo Anthony, that\u2019s where he made his living, on the low block. That\u2019s something that\u2019s always been part of my game and something I\u2019m always going to have. You\u2019ve been traded five times, and what\u2019s weird is those teams really liked you and wanted to keep you. Which trade caught you off-guard the most? The Detroit trade surprised me a bit. But at the same time, I understood it, just because of the way the team was. Some teams like to shake things up. I look at all the trades as successful because I learned a lot from all of them. Moving from one team to another is part of the game now. It\u2019s rare for one guy to be on one team his whole career. Your father has meant so much to you and your brothers and also your sister, grooming you as athletes and stressing the importance of education. He was so hands-on, and still is, as your agent. How would you describe his impact on your life? I would be doing a disservice to measure it. From being my coach as a kid, and starting his own AAU team for myself and my brothers to play \u2026 my father was a father figure for a lot of people I grew up with. We\u2019ve done amazing things together. It\u2019s the type of father-son bond that nothing will separate us. He\u2019s a person that has been in my corner since Day One and saw my potential when a lot of people didn\u2019t. I admire him not only for being an amazing parent who would do anything for his kids, but I could not ask for a greater father. You come from good bloodlines because your grandfather was a member of the Tuskegee Airmen. How old were you when you realized the significance of that? Probably about 19, when I really knew the impact. You study Black history as a kid, but when I got older and we started having those conversations, you start to think like, wow. He was a Tuskegee Airman but he was also somebody that looked at generational wealth. He had a bunch of companies, real estate, he was in the realm of a businessman. For a Black man, you don\u2019t really see a lot of figures like that. One of the greatest things I take from his life is how he looked at generational wealth for his children and for his grandchildren. You executed one of the all-time business moves by declining a $80 million extension with the Clippers, only to make an extra $100 million with the Sixers just five months later. That was quite a bet on yourself, right? My father said before the (Clippers offer) that \u201cYou\u2019re a max player. Be ready to put the work in being a max player.\u201d We had a plan and that\u2019s how we went by it. My father is a hell of an agent and hell of a businessman. It just goes to show, like I always tell guys, we have to put our people in position to be successful. That\u2019s why my father is my agent. He put the hours in to know the game. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s someone who came into the game as an amateur. He came with experience. I\u2019d rather give my percentage to somebody in-house rather than somebody who doesn\u2019t know. You\u2019re watching Joel Embiid from a close distance these days. How would you describe what we\u2019re all seeing from him? An MVP. He\u2019s playing at awesome level every night. Best shape of his career. He\u2019s dominating and being a force. We\u2019re seeing a beast out there and we\u2019re letting him roll. I\u2019m happy with the success he\u2019s having. We talked after the bubble about how we can have success as a team, and he said, \u201cI got to get back to being dominant.\u201d I said, \u201cYou know you can do it.\u201d And he\u2019s doing it. The Sixers made a lot of changes in the structure of the team, aside from hiring Doc. They brought in Daryl Morey to run the basketball operations and made other adjustments. What did you expect from this shuffle? I knew it would be a good group who knew what it took to win and would put the right pieces in place. I knew it would be a great year. That\u2019s how I looked at it. We made some moves and we\u2019re in a great position with a great roster and great upper management. It\u2019s been a while since you were teammates with 7-foot-4 center Boban Marjanovic, now on the Mavericks, and the two of you formed a tight if unusual friendship . Who\u2019s your Boban on these Sixers? (laughs) I just bond with all these guys. A lot of young guys, I\u2018m just trying to show them the way, make sure they have successful careers and I\u2019m having fun doing it. To be clear, though, nobody can take Bobi\u2019s place. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

Doncic leads all players in scoring (13.7 ppg) and assists (2.8 apg) off drives. Young ranks seventh in points (9.5 ppg) and fourth in assists (2.6 apg) off drives. \u2022 The Hawks rank first in the NBA in free throws made (21.2 per game), third in attempts (25.8) and fifth in accuracy (82.0%). Individually, Trae Young ranks second in free throws made (9.3 per game) and attempts (10.5). His 89.1 FT% ranks 13th in the NBA. \u2022 Clint Capela leads the NBA in rebounding (14.6 rpg), including a league-high 4.8 offensive rebounds per game. Capela ranks seventh in second-chance points (3.8), helping the Hawks rank third as a team with 14.7 second-chance points per game. \u2022 The Hawks offense is 16.7 points per 100 possessions better when Trae Young is on the court (115.5 offensive rating in 724 minutes; would rank 4th in league) than when he\u2019s off (98.8 offensive rating in 390 minutes, would rank last in league by 5.5 PTS). That is the second-largest on\/off court differential in the league, trailing only Denver\u2019s Nikola Jokic (18.0). \u2022 This is the second game in a week between the Mavericks and Hawks, with Dallas winning the first meeting 122-116 behind 27 points and 14 assists from Doncic to snap a six-game losing streak. The Mavs limited Young to 21 points \u2014 his sixth-lowest scoring game of the season. Josh Richardson was the primary defender on Young for a team-high 4:47 (42.2% of matchup time) and held Young to five points on 2-5 shooting, with two assists, one turnover and one blocked shot. 10 p.m. ET, ESPN \u2022 Milwaukee enters Wednesday on a five-game win streak, winning games by an average of 20.8 points. During the streak, Khris Middleton is averaging 18.6 points on 11.0 shots per game. He is shooting 58.2% from the field, 50% from 3-point range and 95% from the free throw line. He is one of seven Bucks scoring in double figures during the streak. \u2022 Giannis Antetokounmpo is one of two players (along with Denver\u2019s Nikola Jokic) to average at least 25 points, 10 rebounds and five assists this season. Giannis was the only player to reach those marks in each of the past two seasons \u2014 he won Kia MVP honors both times. \u2022 The Suns enter Wednesday having won three straight and six of their past seven games. During that stretch, Devin Booker is averaging 25.2 points on 49% shooting from the field and 40.6% from 3-point range, while Deandre Ayton is averaging a double-double with 13.1 points and 14.0 rebounds. \u2022 The Bucks rank fourth in 3-pointers made per game (15.4) and third in 3-point percentage (40.1%).

Per 36 minutes played , anyway. It\u2019s all about the pro-rating. Woodward, a 6-foot-6 forward from Mississippi State and the 40th pick in November\u2019s 2020 Draft, actually has scored 13 points for Sacramento in six appearances. But if you extrapolate that out to 36 minutes \u2013 a common standard for basketball stats \u2013 the work Woodard did in a total of 17 minutes becomes an eye-popping 27.4 scoring average. Ditto for Carey and Mannion. Carey, a 6-foot-9 center out of Duke, has logged only about six minutes for Charlotte. But based on the three rebounds he grabbed in that time, he\u2019s got a gaudy rebounding average of 17.2. Based on a hypothetical 36 minutes per game, which has been deemed to be beyond his means at the moment. Mannion? He\u2019s distributing 12.0 assists nightly, if only he could get on the court more than Steph Curry. What he theoretically could do in 36 minutes in fact has been 12 assists (to two turnovers, pretty good ratio) in 36 minutes this season rather than per game. This isn\u2019t simply an idle musing about Fun with Math. It shows how roles and needs and fit with a team contribute to a player\u2019s productivity. That\u2019s especially true for rookies, newcomers who often aren\u2019t trusted playing more than small roles, particularly for teams with aspirations of winning and contending. The opportunities for veteran players vary widely, too, but over a few seasons, you\u2019d expect a guy\u2019s potential and\/or limitations to show themselves and establish whatever role he\u2019s slotted. For the new guys, they\u2019re still learning the league and only starting to harness their skills. How often and how much they participate can have as much to do with the rest of the roster and other players\u2019 availability as their own demonstrated ability. What are we to make, say, of Oklahoma City\u2019s Theo Maledon and Philadelphia\u2019s Tyrese Maxey? Their contributions so far this season are pretty close by numbers. Maledon, a 6-4 guard who was the 34th pick in the Draft, was averaging 7.5 points, 2.6 rebounds and 2.9 assists in 22.7 minutes . Maxey, the 21st pick, was at 9.0 points, 2.1 rebounds and 1.9 assists in 17.7 minutes . But they were trending in different directions over the week between Kia Rookie Ladders. Maledon averaged 33.4 minutes for the Thunder to Maxey\u2019s 9.4 minutes. Does that mean the former is a better rookie, given the workload he presumably has earned? Or is Maxey losing opportunity on a team that currently is all about winning, with an 11-3 mark since Jan. 12? Take their seasons out to 36-minute averages, and here\u2019s how they look: Maledon is at 11.9 points, 4.2 rebounds and 4.5 assists, with 2.9 turnovers and 3.4 fouls. Maxey is at 18.3 points, 4.2 rebounds, 3.8 assists, with 1.4 turnovers and 2.6 fouls. So while Maledon has been shouldering a bigger role lately, Maxey\u2019s surgical production for the Sixers still is valuable. Other per-36 standouts in the Class of 2020: San Antonio\u2019s Tre Jones (24.4 points), Denver\u2019s R.J. Hampton (9.6 rebounds), Dallas\u2019 Tyler Bey (11.4 free throws), Utah\u2019s Trent Forrest (4.1 steals and 8.2 fouls) and the Jazz\u2019s Elijah Hughes (4.0 3-pointers made). Neither of them have been entrusted with anything resembling a rotation spot. Then there are shooting percentages, which don\u2019t change according to 36-minute pro-rating. They would in real life, most likely, factoring in fatigue, game-planning and more. But for now, Boston\u2019s Payton Pritchard is flirting with becoming the first rookie to join the vaunted 50\/40\/90 club for shooting percentages, based on his current 48.5 field goal percentage, 42.9 3-point percentage and 90.0 free throw percentage. Whether Pritchard, back after missing six games with a sprained knee, can do that over a full season \u2013 perhaps in a growing role vs. 336 minutes in 16 appearances \u2013 remains to be seen. The Top 5 this week on the 2020-21 Kia Rookie Ladder: (All stats through Monday, Feb. 8) Season stats : 13.8 ppg, 5.9 rpg, 6.0 apg  Since last Ladder: 24.8 ppg, 6.3 rpg, 6.5 apg  Last Ladder\u2019s rung: 1 Many have called the Hornets a must-see team on NBA League Pass, and this guy is the No. 1 reason why. Lately, his 3-point shooting \u2013 not so productive and criticized for less-than-Ray Allen form \u2013 has perked up. He has hit 51.3% from the arc since the last Ladder, including seven of them against Houston Monday. That left him at 21-of-40 in a six-game span. You do that well, you can shoot from down by your knees, not just from chest height. \u201cThe kid is confident and believes it is going in,\u201d coach James Borrego said. \u201cAnd that is at least half the battle.\u201d Season stats : 11.9 ppg, 3.7 rpg, 5.4 apg  Since last Ladder: 19.0 ppg, 3.0 rpg, 5.3 apg  Last Ladder\u2019s rung: 2 The 12th pick in the 2020 Draft keeps raising questions about his age and tender experience, given the savvy and willingness to tackle pretty much any chore on the court. Sacramento forward Harrison Barnes recently said of the rookie, \u201cTy has that \u2018it\u2019 factor. He\u2019s going to be special in this league for a long time on and off the floor.\u201d Easy for a teammate to say? Then listen to Denver coach Michael Malone over the weekend. \u201cHe\u2019s kicked our [bleep] every time we\u2019ve played him. He has poise and confidence you don\u2019t see from many rookies. He\u2019s not afraid to take and make big shots.\u201d Check it out: In his splits against the Nuggets, Haliburton is averaging 16 points, 3.0 rebounds, 5.3 assists, with 16 assists and just two turnovers. Season stats : 14.0 ppg, 3.3 rpg, 2.2 apg  Since last Ladder: 16.3 ppg, 4.5 rpg, 3.8 apg  Last Ladder\u2019s rung: 4 Back-to-back 20 points games at OKC and at Dallas included some other category stuffing: 16-of-35 shooting overall, 5-of-13 from the arc, 10 rebounds, eight assists, three steals, three blocks and just one turnover, combined. His 5-for-8 foul shooting was as encouraging as anything else, because getting to the line has been a challenge \u2013 particularly the way Edwards can put the ball on the floor and attack the rim. Asked if the No. 1 pick overall was getting \u201crookie\u201d treatment from refs, coach Ryan Saunders kept his money and said that Edwards\u2019 ability to play through contact will earn him more free throws in time. Season stats : 11.3 ppg, 4.5 rpg, 3.9 apg  Since last Ladder: 14.7 ppg, 4.7 rpg, 5.3 apg  Last Ladder\u2019s rung: 6 Anthony is said to be his own toughest critic, but most people would be fine with a guy ranking in the top six among rookies in scoring, rebounding, assists, free-throw percentage and minutes. His field-goal shooting showed signs of improvement, too (18-of-32 in a three-game stretch). But he suffered a shoulder strain and left early against Portland, adding to Orlando\u2019s injury woes. Season stats : 11.8 ppg, 2.3 rpg, 2.7 apg  Since last Ladder: 8.7 ppg, 2.0 rpg, 2.3 apg  Last Ladder\u2019s rung: 5 Quickley\u2019s world seemed to get rocked on Sunday with news that the Knicks were re-acquiring Derrick Rose . Sure, Rose, 32, is a proven veteran capable of imparting some court wisdom to the New York rookie, but he still aches to play and to shine. And their coach is Tom Thibodeau, a Rose devotee. But for those nervous that Quickley\u2019s reps at point guard will get stomped, Rose and their coach quickly began saying the right things about his development. Rose in theory can do for Quickley what Detroit had positioned him to do for Killian Hayes. 6. James Wiseman, Golden State Warriors Season stats : 12.2 ppg, 6.1 rpg, 0.7 apg  Since last Ladder: DNP  Last Ladder\u2019s rung: 3 Out since Jan. 30.

Usually, it\u2019s young players, some barely 20 years old, displaying the talent and skill and impact to help their teams right away. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re listing here: The best players still on their rookie contracts. These players are worth their weight in gold. Not only are they immediate contributors, but their long-term potential is so promising that their teams can use resources to improve other areas and positions. Some of these players, or maybe most of them, are staring at solid 10-year careers or longer. They\u2019re one less worry for their teams, many of whom are in the process of rebuilding. So: Here\u2019s a top-10 list of such players, in no specific order , who are paying off now and will certainly cash in later when their contract is up: Age: 21 2020-21 stats: 27.8 points, 8.7 rebounds, 9.3 assists The buzz on Doncic: He is largely seen as the future of basketball, a global phenom whose skillset and smarts is so seasoned that you forget he\u2019s only 21. In rapid time, Doncic has gained the respect of the NBA\u2019s current and former greats, no easy feat, especially for Euros who enter the league with initial skepticism from folks who never saw them play. Doncic thrives because, in addition to his sharp basketball basics and instincts, he uses his body well. At a somewhat chunky 6-foot-7, Doncic can back his man down in the post to draw fouls or secure the three-point play. He brings a near-textbook shooting form, although his accuracy from deep this season is faltering. He already has the reputation for being a whiner, and there\u2019s perhaps some truth in that, considering Doncic racks up the technical fouls and hard glares from opponents. But it\u2019s also the competitive spirit, too, that separates him from most. His future contract negotiations will be quick. As in, give Luka whatever amount he wants. Age: 22 2020-21 stats: 26.7 points, 4.0 rebounds, 9.2 assists The buzz on Young: He\u2019s not exactly Stephen Curry, the player he was often (and unfairly) compared to once he arrived in the NBA. But Young is carving out an image of his own, and it\u2019s mostly favorable. His shooting range is expansive and Young isn\u2019t bashful about aiming from the midcourt logo, which can drive his defender nuts (and sometimes the Hawks, too, when he forces those shots, which is often). Perhaps more impressive than his range is his ability to draw fouls. Armed with a tricky dribble and a fearless attitude regarding attacking bigger defenders, Young drives to the hoop to draw contact and also get the sympathy of referees. In all, he\u2019s a rising offensive force who also passes extremely well, even between the legs of defenders if necessary. His defense is, in a word, poor. It doesn\u2019t help that Young is a light-weighted 6-foot-1. Yet in due time, he can patch up that flaw in his game as he gets stronger and wiser. He\u2019s the centerpiece the Hawks need as they look to build around him and become a contender. Age: 20 2020-21 stats: 23.5 points, 7.1 rebounds, 2.9 assists The buzz on Williamson: Burly and ballistic, Zion is already a box-office draw because fans and TV executives are drawn to his unconventional style. He\u2019s a 6-foot-7 forward who rarely takes 3-pointers yet generates offense anyway, mainly by bullying defenders near the rim. The power is awe-inspiring, for sure, and Zion uses his body well, leveraging it for points or trips to the free throw line. Is it too soon to suggest Zion is on his way to becoming a folk hero? Maybe. Thankfully for the Pelicans, that body has held up well this season after the Pelicans treated him with kid gloves in 2019-20 following knee issues. Of course, he\u2019s not the perfect player, not at age 20, and there\u2019s room to grow defensively, first and foremost. Eventually, he\u2019ll also need to improve his shooting beyond 15 feet to keep the defense guessing and off-balance. And there are scattered intangibles that could use sharpening. In all, though, Zion is perhaps the league\u2019s best player at his age, and with seasoning can be better in the very near future. Age: 23 2020-21 stats: 17.8 points, 7.8 rebounds, 1.0 blocks The buzz on Collins: Consistent and steady, Collins has made himself into a reliable 6-foot-9 combo forward who seems comfortable near the rim and at times beyond the arc. He rarely takes bad shots, as evident by his career 56.9% shooting (37.7% from deep) and doesn\u2019t make many mistakes. He\u2019s the most notable player of the 2017 draft class who hasn\u2019t signed a rookie extension. Word is Collins wanted the rookie max last fall, and the Hawks, perhaps wisely, decided to wait until this summer to reevaluate. Atlanta might allow him to fetch an offer as a restricted free agent and simply match it. Strangely, the Hawks gave big money last offseason to free agent Danilo Gallinari, who plays the same position, yet Collins has outplayed Gallo since. Collins has a solid playing relationship with Young; the two are on the same page, especially with the pick and roll, and make for a promising one-two punch. Age: 21 2019-20 stats: 17.4 points, 4.6 rebounds, 1.4 assists (in 2019-20) The buzz on Jackson: Still looking to break a sweat this season while mending from offseason knee surgery, Jackson is the Robin to Ja Morant\u2019s Batman in Memphis. Prior to his injury, he displayed plenty of promise as a stretch-4, shooting at a respectable 38.4% from deep in his two seasons. In quick time, Jackson and Morant clicked favorably and clearly they\u2019re the foundation of the ongoing Grizzlies rebuilding plan. Jackson does bring a gentle touch around the rim, and at 6-foot-11 he perhaps should utilize that more often instead of falling in love with the 3-pointer. Also on the flipside, he\u2019s a so-so rebounder for his size, and that\u2019s probably due to him being positioned so far from the rim; his appetite for the boards seems low anyway. As a defender, though, Jackson is developing and brings agility and quickness to guard smaller players if necessary. His personality and attitude is solid, which means he\u2019s easy to coach and will take the time to learn. Age: 22 2020-21 stats: 14.0 points, 12.8 rebounds, 1.1 blocks The buzz on Ayton: Anyone taken with the No. 1 overall pick is always subject to lofty expectations and Ayton is no different. However, in his situation, this is amplified because the Suns passed on Doncic. Meanwhile, Ayton struggled to rise among the league\u2019s better big men in his first few years, and the hefty suspension he earned in 2019-20 for using a banned substance didn\u2019t help. The trick for Ayton is to become a useful low-post center in a league that places a higher value on perimeter players. It\u2019s certainly possible \u2014 Joel Embiid is the best example \u2014 but it\u2019s all up to Ayton and his desire. It would help if he doubles his aggression, which is merely passable right now. The Suns don\u2019t want Ayton to be a pick-setter; they want him to command and demand the ball. The good news is this season, with the help of Chris Paul, Ayton is dropping positive hints. His rebounding is solid and when he\u2019s not timid, he\u2019s getting quality shots at the rim. What\u2019s a bit more troublesome is he\u2019s not yet a defensive force at the rim. Phoenix is being patient, though, and could be rewarded for that. Ayton seems to be on the upswing; question is, how high can he go? Age: 21 2020-21 stats : 18.5 points, 2.2 rebounds, 7.4 assists The buzz on Morant: The reigning Kia Rookie of the Year brings most of the elements you want in a player, namely: desire, smarts, entertainment value. Morant is all that, and he\u2019s on his way to being special. His vertical leap, impressive for someone who\u2019s just 6-foot-3 and 174 pounds, allows him to get bigger in stature as he approaches the rim. His dunks are crowd-pleasing and often momentum-changing. His 3-point shooting is a work in progress and he\u2019ll need to improve on his career 32.6% from there to take the next step as a player. Strange thing is, Morant will take that shot in big moments, evidence of the confidence he has in himself and his willingness to accept the consequences either way. In addition, he\u2019s popular among his teammates and the coaching staff, which is necessary for someone who\u2019s ready to step into a leadership role. He may need to get stronger if only to lower any fears of him being in the line of injury. Age: 22 2020-21 stats: 22.6 points, 5.5 rebounds, 6.5 assists The buzz on Gilgeous-Alexander : There may not be room on the back of his jersey for any more letters, but SGA is starting to put space between himself and many of the other guards taken in his class. After acquiring him from the LA Clippers in the Paul George trade, the Thunder gave him the opportunity to become the primary option of the club and SGA is taking full advantage. After being schooled by Paul last season, he\u2019s now the man and looks comfortable in that role and with more shots and responsibility. He\u2019s shooting 50.6% overall and 38.2% on 3-pointers this seasons and brings quick hands for defense. What\u2019ll be interesting is where he fits best: on the ball or off it? He\u2019s showing an ability to do both and as the Thunder begin to search for his perfect backcourt mate, that gives OKC plenty of options when the time comes to make trades, sign free agents or use the plethora of picks it secured from the Clippers (and the Rockets for that matter). Age: 22 2020-21 stats: 14.6 points, 6.5 rebounds, 42.9% 3-pointers The buzz on Porter: After dropping with speed following a collegiate career cut short by back surgery, Porter is making good with his improved health. His status was also upgraded when the Nuggets passed on re-signing Jerami Grant last offseason, which created more minutes in the rotation. Porter used the 2019-20 restart as a springboard to this season, where he\u2019s a solid contributor and some nights a primary player for the Nuggets. His shooting from deep is among the best in the league, and at 6-foot-10, his size is utilized wisely near the rim. Porter needs to improve his ball-handling, and his body needs more hours in the weight room. He\u2019s not a great passer and he could use more maturing. All told, the Nuggets are thrilled he fell to them in the Draft \u2026 it\u2019s rare when a title-contender gets rich with a mid-first-round pick. Age: 22 2020-21 stats: 23.6 points, 2.5 rebounds, 4.1 assists The buzz on Sexton : There\u2019s a reason why the Cavaliers, for the first time, could make the playoffs in the post-LeBron James era \u2014 and it\u2019s primarily because of Sexton\u2019s development. After going through the usual developmental gymnastics while learning the point guard position, Sexton has emerged as the Cavs\u2019 go-to player. His ability to take his man off the dribble is improving, which is why the Cavs call plenty of isolation plays for him. Sexton seems fearless and never intimidated by the player or team he\u2019s facing. That serves him well as he makes a solid attempt at becoming a franchise-type player, or at least the core piece in the Cavs\u2019 rebuilding plan. He needs to be a better passer for a point guard, though that can be improved in time, and as his teammates get better.

But in getting there by besting the Boston Celtics 122-108 on Tuesday , the Utah Jazz hope they\u2019re building a roadway to destinations beyond the first-round exits yielded from the last two trips to the postseason. \u201cI told y\u2019all at the beginning of the year: We got bounced out of the first round two years in a row. We\u2019ve got to get past that. That\u2019s it,\u201d Jazz guard Donovan Mitchell said. \u201cThen, from there, we\u2019ll continue to push our goals. Our mind is stuck on the championship. We\u2019re not here to kind of say, \u2018Let\u2019s just be in first,\u2019 and get the accolades that come with that. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to win the whole thing, and that\u2019s been the mindset of this team and this group. You see it with our play, you see it with our grit and determination.\u201d Mitchell certainly embodied all of that in leading the team\u2019s fifth straight victory \u2014 and 16 th in Utah\u2019s last 17 contests \u2014 by scoring a game-high 36 points to go with nine assists, including a stretch of sheer dominance over the last 5 minutes and 25 seconds in which the guard scored 10 of the team\u2019s final 18 points, while dishing dimes for the other eight. Led by Joe Ingles\u2019 season-high 24 points, the Jazz supporting cast did its part, too. Rudy Gobert contributed 18 points and 12 rebounds, while Bojan Bogdanovic logged 16 points and eight boards to help Utah improve to 20-5 for the league\u2019s best record, while tying for the best 25-game start in franchise history. The Jazz accomplished the latest feat without starting point guard Mike Conley (hamstring) against a quality opponent in Boston that was missing Marcus Smart, as it welcomed back star wing Jaylen Brown , who had missed the Celtics\u2019 last two games due to left knee soreness. With Brown (33 points, eight rebounds) back in the fold, Boston jumped out to a hot start. The Celtics drained their first five shots from distance to start the game, as Brown hit three consecutive 3-pointers. With three minutes left in the first quarter, Boston took a 27-19 lead \u2014 its largest of the game \u2014 on a Payton Prichard 3-pointer. \u201cWe just didn\u2019t let that impact us,\u201d Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. \u201cWe started defending better.\u201d The Celtics\u2019 early advantage would turn out to be short-lived as Utah weathered the early storm to go into intermission up one point as Mitchell and Ingles combined for 23 points in the first half and five assists. Going into the matchup, the Jazz owned a record of 15-1 when leading at halftime, and they improved it Tuesday to 16-1 by outscoring Boston 74-61 in the second half. Mitchell scored 24 points in the second half on 7 of 11 from the floor and 4 of 7 from 3-point range. Mitchell has now racked up 30-plus points in three of his last five games, and he\u2019s dished 20 dimes over his last two outings. Since Mitchell came into the league in 2017, the Jazz own a record of 50-12 when he finishes with six assists or more. \u201cHe\u2019s been locked in possession by possession,\u201d Snyder said. \u201cI think his efficiency in pick-and-roll is something he takes great pride in. I thought his ability to get people involved and then pick his spots, particularly when he feels the game and not forcing himself on the game. \u201cHe\u2019s not gonna be satisfied. \u2026 I think we forget sometimes that he\u2019s such a young player because really from his rookie year he\u2019s been asked to do so much. So, you put yourself in that situation, and you hold yourself accountable as much as anything, and that\u2019s what he has done.\u201d But Mitchell wasn\u2019t the only one. With Conley out of action, both Mitchell and Ingles served as Utah\u2019s main ballhandlers against the Celtics. Ingles responded to the extra responsibility with a season-high in scoring, in addition to six assists while knocking down 5 of 11 from 3-point range. Gobert, meanwhile, produced his 22 nd double-digit rebound game of 2020-21 while also shooting 8-for-9 overall and blocking three shots. But even in the midst of the team\u2019s current run of success, the Jazz readily admit to carrying over feelings of disappointment from last season\u2019s disappointing finish in the NBA bubble. Utah led 3-1 in the opening round of the playoffs against the No. 3-seeded Denver Nuggets, before dropping the final three games of the series in an epic duel between Mitchell and Jamal Murray. One of lesson coming from that was the need to maintain focus at all times. \u201cI think it was a great learning experience for us. It definitely made us grow as a team,\u201d Gobert said. \u201cI think every struggle, every tough moment in life in general really helps you grow. I think you really embrace them. I really felt like we came back this year with a purpose. \u201cLike I\u2019ve been saying: there\u2019s still a much higher level that we can reach. There\u2019s still a lot of ways we can get better and better. I really feel like we have a chip on our shoulder, and we need that if we want to do what we\u2019re trying to do this year.\u201d Utah also needs to continue to find multiple ways to defeat opponents based on the matchups and circumstances presented from night to night. The Jazz entered the matchup Tuesday as the only team in the NBA to rank in the top five in both offensive rating (115.4) and defensive rating (107.0), while also holding the league\u2019s second-best net rating (8.4). \u201cI think this year compared to other years I\u2019ve been here, we\u2019ve been able to win in different ways,\u201d Ingles said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t just won because we\u2019ve shot the ball well. We\u2019ve won on the defensive end. We\u2019ve won with different styles, different guys. I think we\u2019ll keep learning along the way different ways to win, different things to work for. We\u2019ve got a way longer-term goal in mind which keeps us pretty focused.\u201d Utah\u2019s next slate of games should help in that department, too. The Jazz face Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Milwaukee Bucks at home on Friday, followed by a clash on Saturday against Jimmy Butler and the Miami Heat. From there, Utah takes on the Philadelphia 76ers on Feb. 15, followed by back-to-back games that Feb. 17 and 19 against the LA Clippers. The Jazz tip off the following week with games on Feb. 22 and Feb. 24 against the Charlotte Hornets and Los Angeles Lakers, respectively. \u201cIt\u2019s been only 25 games. We\u2019ve got plenty more left, and this is a great start,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cWe\u2019d rather be there at the end as opposed to starting out great. This is the first game of a big stretch we\u2019ve got coming up. We\u2019ve got teams that have deep playoff experience, high-level players. We\u2019ve just got to go out there and do what we do. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we\u2019re saying this is a make-or-break stretch for us. But we\u2019ve just got to go in there and continue to play the way we\u2019ve been playing; share the ball, move the ball, defend at a high level, and everything will take care of itself. Because we\u2019re not playing to be ready by February. We\u2019re playing to be ready in March, April, May, June, July, whatever. These are good tests for us. That\u2019s gonna be our biggest thing: just passing each test one by one just to see where we\u2019re at, see what we can build on and things we need to improve on.\u201d * * * Michael C.

The Hawks have been without guard Bogdan Bogdanovic for a month due to a knee injury. Hunter, enjoying a breakout season as the starting small forward, missed four games before Monday\u2019s arthroscopic procedure on his right knee. His status will be updated in two weeks. Atlanta (11-12) will be without the two starters when it plays at Dallas on Wednesday night. Hunter has emerged as one of Atlanta\u2019s top players in his second season. He is third on the team with 17.2 points per game, adding important scoring balance behind Trae Young and John Collins. Hunter\u2019s breakout has been especially important while the team awaits the return of Bogdanovic, who had been expected to provide scoring punch from the wing before fracturing his right knee. Coach Lloyd Pierce has been forced to make constant changes to his rotation. Forward Danilo Gallinari and rookie center Onyeka Okongwu also have missed significant time with injuries. \u201cWe\u2019re basically missing our starting 2 and 3,\u201d Pierce said Monday, adding that Gallinari and Okongwu \u201care just now coming along.\u201d Bogdanovic has shed his knee brace, raising hopes he could return soon. Another free-agent addition, guard Kris Dunn, hasn\u2019t played this season as he continues his recovery from right ankle surgery on Dec. 29. Bogdanovic, Gallinari, Dunn, Rajon Rondo and Tony Snell were Atlanta\u2019s aggressive offseason additions. The aim was to add outside shooting, defense and experience to the foundation of draft picks led by Young, Collins, Hunter, Cam Reddish and Kevin Huerter. Because of the injuries, the Hawks still don\u2019t know how all the new pieces might fit with the young returning players. \u201cIt\u2019s been tough,\u201d Huerter said. \u201cWe\u2019re bringing back five or six guys from last year\u2019s team that played a lot of minutes and were a big part of that team and adding all the guys we have this year.\u201d The Hawks expected COVID-19 could complicate attempts to establish momentum. Instead, injuries have been the culprit. \u201cWe\u2019re still trying to jell,\u201d Huerter said. \u201cObviously there have been a lot of lineups that have not played a lot of minutes together. \u2026 We won\u2019t truly know until guys come back and be healthy.\u201d Huerter sank five 3-pointers and scored 19 points as the Hawks snapped a three-game losing streak with their 132-121 win over Toronto on Saturday night. The Hawks are relying on Huerter, who has scored in double figures in five consecutive games, and Reddish, who has struggled with poor shooting while filling in for Hunter. Reddish made two of four 3s against Toronto after making only 1 of 16 in his previous four games. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re going to replace De\u2019Andre,\u201d Pierce said. \u201cYou just have to have other guys step up and that\u2019s what we\u2019re looking for.\u201d Hunter\u2019s absence only encourages teams to double-team Young, forcing the Hawks to look elsewhere for scoring. Dallas successfully used that strategy in its 122-116 win at Atlanta on Feb. 3. Only a late surge allowed Young to score 21 points. He leads the team with 26.7 points per game. \u201cWe\u2019ll pick it up,\u201d Huerter said. \u201cWe\u2019ll find it somewhere else. Guys will fill in.

It was a head-scratching move, especially considering there was more than five seconds left on the clock, but Green isn\u2019t a guy to host a pity party. He should be back and fired up for a chance at redemption tonight. Across his last three games, he\u2019s averaged 13.3 assists. Gary Trent (SG \u2013 POR) : $6,600 vs. ORL  Orlando has been smoked by shooting guards this season (paging Fred VanVleet), and Trent continues to play a key role on offense for the Blazers. He\u2019s well worth his $6.6K salary tonight in what could be a Tuesday-night eruption. Tyrese Haliburton (G \u2013 SAC) : $6,400 vs. PHI  Haliburton continues to light up the box score, as the rookie has shown his ability to contribute strong numbers in multiple categories. PHI\/SAC has one of the highest over\/unders on the slate tonight, and it\u2019s a great matchup to target from a DFS standpoint. DeMarcus Cousins (C \u2013 HOU) : $6,000 at NO  Boogie\u2019s price has remained pretty stable around the $6K range, so why not keep going back to him? With Christian Wood still out and Victor Oladipo now sitting tonight, Cousins should enjoy plenty of run alongside former Kentucky teammate John Wall. Mason Plumlee (C \u2013 DET) : $5,700 vs. BKN  A pretty good DFS strategy in 2020-21 has been \u201cattack Brooklyn,\u201d so that\u2019s what we\u2019ll do. The Nets are one of the worst teams defensively in the entire NBA, and Plumlee makes a fine value play at his sub-$6K price tag. Jakob Poeltl (C \u2013 SAS) : $5,500 vs. GSW  Poeltl has finally cracked San Antonio\u2019s starting lineup, and his new role has been abundantly fruitful. Across his last three games, Poeltl has averaged 11.7 points, 10.0 boards, and 3.0 blocks. He\u2019s always been an efficient per-minute player, but his newfound playing time is finally giving him some tangible fantasy value. He\u2019s a huge value tonight against Golden State\u2019s undersized frontcourt. Juan Toscano-Anderson (SF \u2013 GSW) : $5,300 at SAS  It\u2019s #JTASZN for fantasy managers as the forward has averaged 8.0 points, 9.7 boards, and 3.0 dimes across his last three games while logging 34.3 minutes of court time in that span. Even with Eric Paschall back in action, JTA played 29 minutes Monday to Paschall\u2019s 14. Kendrick Nunn (PG \u2013 MIA) : $5,000 vs. NYK  With Goran Dragic out, expect Nunn to see significant playing time against the Knicks tonight. Nunn is certainly a risky option with a super-low floor, but his scoring ability gives him a high ceiling that\u2019s worth a look in tournaments at this affordable price. Dwayne Bacon (SG \u2013 ORL) : $4,100 at POR  No Evan Fournier? No problem. Bacon started Saturday with Fournier ailing from a back injury, and the former scored 16 points in 31 minutes. He\u2019s expected to start again tonight, and getting him in your DFS lineups could mean bringing home the bacon on a winning entry. Saben Lee (PG \u2013 DET) : $3,500 vs. BKN  This is completely dependent on injury news tonight, so keep an eye on that. Delon Wright is questionable with an ankle injury, while newly-acquired Dennis Smith may not play due to COVID-19 protocols.

Konchalski had spent 43 years evaluating college basketball prospects and wrote and ran the High School Basketball Insider Report since 1979. He also took over ownership of the Five-Star Basketball Camp , which has seen NBA legends including Michael Jordan, Patrick Ewing, Dominique Wilkins, LeBron James, Chris Paul, Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, Kyrie Irving and more participate in the camp in their high school days. The HSBI Report was written on Konchalski\u2019s typewriter and was mailed out 16 times a year the more than 200 college coaches who subscribed to it. It served as a scouting report, evaluation and rankings list hundreds of prospects. \u201cTom just tried to help everybody,\u201d Iona College coach Rick Pitino told the New York Post . \u201cHe was just a very humble, kind, special man. \u2026 If you asked him about a player, he would give you the mother, father, nephew, nieces, he would know every single person in the family, and he would know the connections, what you would have to do to get the kid.\u201d He was known to many as \u201cThe Glider\u201d because of his ability to slip into a gym unnoticed and assess players on his trademark yellow notepad. Konchalski was also known for his incredible memory and the fact he never had a cellphone, VCR or answering machine. His detail in describing players in his HSBI was the stuff of legend as well. Of former NBA star Jamal Mashburn, Konchalski wrote in the HBCI that Mashburn had \u201cthe body of a blacksmith and the touch of a surgeon.\u201d Future All-NBA guard Penny Hardaway, he said \u201cdeals like Trump, dishes like Julia Child and delivers like Domino\u2019s.\u201d He also once said of Kenny Anderson\u2019s college prospects: \u201cOnly the Father, Son and Holy Ghost are ahead of him.\u201d NBA stars Donovan Mitchell and Tobias Harris \u2014 both of whom were born and raised in New York \u2014 took to Twitter on Monday to pay homage to Konchalski, as did several other players and others in the basketball world.

The National Transportation Safety Board said poor visibility probably led pilot Ara Zobayan to become so disoriented in thick fog north of Los Angeles that he could not perceive up from down. The five board members also said Zobayan, who also died in the crash, ignored his training and violated federal regulations during the 40-minute flight. The agency announced its findings during a four-hour hearing aimed at pinpointing probable causes of the tragedy \u2014 which led to widespread public mourning for the retired basketball star, launched several lawsuits and prompted state and federal legislation. Bryant, his 13-year-old daughter Gianna and six other passengers were flying from Orange County to a youth basketball tournament at his Mamba Sports Academy in Ventura County, when the Sikorsky S-76 helicopter encountered thick fog in the San Fernando Valley on Jan. 26, 2020. There was no sign of mechanical failure and the crash was believed to be an accident. Investigators said they believed Zobayan experienced a spatial disorientation known as \u201cthe leans,\u201d which occurs in the inner ear and causes pilots to believe they are flying aircraft straight and level when they are in fact banking. The agency criticized Zobayan\u2019s decision to fly into the clouds, saying Federal Aviation Administration standards require that pilots are able to see where they are going under what is called Visual Flight Rules. Board members, in a unanimous vote, also cited the self-induced pressure Zobayan likely felt to finish the flight for his star client, whom he flew often, instead of landing at a nearby local airport when the weather became worse than he had expected. Zobayan also failed to file a backup flight plan before departing. \u201cThe closer you get to the destination, the more you think just maybe you can pull this off,\u201d NTSB Vice Chairman Bruce Landsberg said. The agency also faulted Island Express Helicopters Inc., which operated the aircraft, for inadequate review and oversight of safety matters. Just before the crash, Zobayan told flight controllers he was climbing in the helicopter and had nearly broken through the clouds. But NTSB investigators said that the helicopter was in fact banking and beginning to descend quickly, investigators said. The aircraft had climbed sharply and nearly succeeded breaking through the fog and clouds when the helicopter made an abrupt left turn and plunged into grassy, oak studded hills in the city of Calabasas. When it hit the ground, the Sikorsky S-76B helicopter was flying at about 184 mph (296 kph) and descending at a rate of more than 4000 feet (1,219 meters) per minute. The impact caused a crater and scattered debris over an area the size of a football field. The victims died immediately. There were 184 aircraft crashes between 2010-2019 involving spatial disorientation, including 20 fatal helicopter crashes, the NTSB said. NTSB member Michael Graham said Zobayan ignored his training and added that that as long as helicopter pilots continue flying into clouds without relying on instruments, which requires a high level of training, \u201ca certain percentage aren\u2019t going to come out alive.\u201d \u201cWhat part of cloud, when you\u2019re on a visual flight rules program, do pilots not understand?\u201d Landsberg added. The helicopter did not have so-called \u201cblack box\u201d recording devices, which were not required. The NTSB is an independent federal agency that investigates transportation-related crashes but has no enforcement powers. It submits suggestions to agencies like the FAA or the Coast Guard, which have repeatedly rejected some board safety recommendations after other disasters. Over the past year, experts have speculated that the crash could lead to requiring Terrain Awareness and Warning Systems, devices that signal when aircraft are in danger of crashing, on helicopters. The helicopter that Bryant was flying in did not have the system, which the NTSB has recommended as mandatory for helicopters. The FAA requires it only for air ambulances. However, NTSB investigator-in-charge Bill English said Tuesday that the system would likely not have been helpful in the scenario in which Bryant\u2019s helicopter crashed. The hilly terrain, combined with the pilot\u2019s spatial disorientation in the clouds, would have made the warning system \u201ca confusing factor,\u201d English said. \u201cThe pilot doesn\u2019t know which way is up,\u201d English said. The others killed in the crash were Orange Coast College baseball coach John Altobelli, his wife, Keri, and their daughter Alyssa; Christina Mauser, who helped Bryant coach his daughter\u2019s basketball team; and Sarah Chester and her daughter Payton. Alyssa and Payton were Gianna\u2019s teammates. The crash generated lawsuits and countersuits. On the day that a massive memorial service was held at the Staples Center, where Bryant played most of his career, Vanessa Bryant sued Zobayan and the companies that owned and operated the helicopter for alleged negligence and the wrongful deaths of her husband and daughter. Families of other victims sued the helicopter companies but not the pilot. Vanessa Bryant said Island Express Helicopters Inc., which operated the aircraft, and its owner, Island Express Holding Corp., did not properly train or supervise Zobayan. She said the pilot was careless and negligent to fly in fog and should have aborted the flight. Zobayan\u2019s brother, Berge Zobayan, has said Kobe Bryant knew the risks of flying in a helicopter and that his survivors aren\u2019t entitled to damages from the pilot\u2019s estate. Island Express Helicopters Inc. denied responsibility and said the crash was \u201can act of God\u201d that it could not control. The company also countersued two FAA air traffic controllers, saying the crash was caused by their \u201cseries of erroneous acts and\/or omissions.\u201d Vanessa Bryant also sued the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department, accusing deputies of sharing unauthorized photos of the crash site. California now has a state law prohibiting such conduct.

And, speaking of elevation, he\u2019s also being placed on the level of franchise savior \u2014 as premature as that might be. Except in this case, it\u2019s not orbiting around Lonzo Ball anymore. It\u2019s now the younger sibling, LaMelo, who has singlehandedly made the Charlotte Hornets must-watch TV and who is swiftly collecting respect and Kia Rookie of the Year attention with every no-look pass. The ongoing LaMelo-fication is a neat development and a welcome one to spice up an NBA regular season, and it\u2019s enough to make folks forget how all this Ball business started. That other development in the family is intriguing, too. Because it\u2019s not just about where Lonzo Ball\u2019s been and where he\u2019s at, but also where he\u2019s headed. Nobody\u2019s totally sure how to classify or quantify any of it. In three seasons after Magic Johnson, of all people, predicted Lonzo\u2019s jersey would someday hang in the rafters with the Lakers\u2019 greats, Lonzo was traded and the hysteria he initially caused was downgraded. He\u2019s the starting point guard for the New Orleans Pelicans, which is a vote of confidence, but the team didn\u2019t offer him a rich rookie contract extension, which isn\u2019t. His teammates and coaches speak fondly of him \u2026 all while the trade rumor pipeline is also shouting his name once or twice. While LaMelo is generating the interest that was once reserved for him, what do we make of Lonzo here in the first pivotal intersection of a young career that\u2019s taken a quieter turn? He\u2019s obviously an NBA talent, but after 181 career games nobody\u2019s quite sure if he\u2019s on the path to being special or just good enough. He\u2019s one of the main components of a rebuilding New Orleans team, yet clearly, the foundation belongs to Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram. It\u2019s possible that Lonzo\u2019s best fit is elsewhere. That would mean another relocation, especially if the Pelicans are unwilling to meet the asking price for an extension and would rather cut ties now and get something for him. That initial contract stalemate last December gives some juice to the trade possibilities floated lately. About those trade trial balloons, Lonzo said: \u201cI just stay the course. I\u2019ve been playing basketball for a long time. I put a lot of work in and just try to play my game. That\u2019s how I play. I just try to stay away from all the noise and just go out there and try to help my team win games.\u201d Curiously, he\u2019s having the best stretch of his career, dropping hints that he\u2019s finally turning the corner as a player and shedding some of the flaws that slowed his growth. As the Pelicans prepare for a Tuesday game with the Rockets, Ball is making more of an impact in games and also moments that ultimately decide games. While this season, so far, has been somewhat of a disappointment for the 10-12 Pelicans, Ball is averaging 16.8 ppg, 5.8 rpg, 4.8 apg and 1.3 spg in wins (and 10.4 ppg, 3.0 rpg, 4.5 apg and 1.4 spg in losses). His best outing this season was 27 points, eight assists and only two turnovers in a win against the Milwaukee Bucks (and former teammate Jrue Holiday), and 20 points and nine rebounds against Malcolm Brogdon and the Indiana Pacers . Over the last seven games he\u2019s shooting 49.1% on 3-pointers \u2014 evidence that his quirky, once-unreliable jumper has been reworked and improved. Ball is taking 7.3 3-pointers per game, easily a career high and a necessary jump as well. Scouting reports have long urged defenders to give him as much space as possible. Pelicans coach Stan Van Gundy said: \u201cI push the need for him to take every open shot and to continue to work at being aggressive in attacking the basket and making plays. We need him to do both of those things in addition to organizing our team.\u201d It\u2019s that gradual progression of Ball that has the Pelicans feeling confident with him. Shooting was his most glaring weakness and there\u2019s more consistency and confidence now than in his three previous seasons (he\u2019s shooting a career-best 50.6% on 2-pointers). His court vision remains sharp, although the Pelicans do run some of their offense through Ingram and Williamson. \u201cI don\u2019t want to put a ceiling on him,\u201d said Van Gundy. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say at 23 he\u2019s anywhere near to what he can be. I think he\u2019ll continue to get better. He\u2019s just been consistently good, more solid, not taking chances.\u201d But the question remains: How solid and sold is New Orleans on him? The Pelicans used their No. 1 pick, the 13th overall, on point guard Kira Lewis Jr. He\u2019s not ready to take the reins now, but perhaps later. And while Ball\u2019s shooting is on the uptick, it\u2019s probably not good enough yet for him to play off the ball, at least not the majority of the time. Ball\u2019s recent surge could be good news not necessarily for the Pelicans, but for the price he\u2019ll fetch on the trade market. In that sense, he could be more valuable to them on another team. The player drafted before Ball in 2017, Markelle Fultz of the Orlando Magic, had his contract extended (though not at a max rate). So did the player taken right after, Boston Celtics All-Star forward Jayson Tatum. So, too, did Sacramento Kings guard De\u2019Aaron Fox \u2014 taken three spots later \u2014 whom Ball was once compared to. Players who aren\u2019t immediately extended don\u2019t always get tossed aside. Ingram wasn\u2019t once he became eligible, but the Pelicans rewarded him last offseason. Still, it at least raises the possibility of a parting of the ways between Ball and New Orleans. Would the Clippers, who have a non-playmaking starter in Pat Beverley, have enough goods (or the desire) to bring Ball back to L.A.? Suppose the Golden State Warriors want to add backcourt depth? What about the rebuilding Detroit Pistons, who just traded Derrick Rose? Here\u2019s the catch: Any team trading for Ball would most likely want to sign him long-term, or else the trade makes little sense. Speaking on local radio recently, Pelicans GM David Griffin said: \u201cIn his situation, it\u2019s a good thing that people bring up your name because it means you\u2019re coveted by other teams.\u201d Of course, the Pelicans can also sit tight, negotiate in the summer, or let Ball see what he can get as a restricted free agent. In these situations, everything\u2019s on the table and all options are explored. In the meantime, the hope is Ball will keep helping himself and the Pelicans. That happens with elevated performances, a firmer grasp of leading the club and continued upswing with his shot-making. In that scenario, everyone wins. The goal for Lonzo, then, is to create as much chatter as LaMelo is getting, if possible. Amazingly, that family bar already has been raised. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

But you couldn\u2019t tell from watching Monday as Ball tied a rookie franchise record with seven 3-pointers in the Charlotte Hornets\u2019 119-94 rout of the Houston Rockets. Ball tied the team mark set by DJ Augustin in 2008 and matched by P.J. Washington last season. He finished with 24 points, 10 assists and seven rebounds against Houston, allowing Ball to join elite company with LeBron James and Luka Doncic. Per Elias Sports, the 19-year-old Ball became just the third player that age or younger to register multiple games of 20 points, 10 assists and five rebounds. Ball also became the first rookie since Stephen Curry in 2010 against the LA Clippers to post a stat line in a single game of at least 24 points, 10 assists, seven rebounds and seven 3-pointers. \u201cI\u2019m not sure where the respect level is for his shot yet,\u201d Hornets coach James Borrego said. \u201cEvery team\u2019s a little bit different with him. But he\u2019ll continue to prove that he can shoot it. He shoots it with confidence.\u201d Ball certainly showed it on the way to helping Charlotte capture its fifth win in seven games. The Hornets inserted Ball into the starting lineup on Feb. 1 in a win over Miami. Charlotte now owns a record of 3-2 with Ball in the starting lineup, and the Hornets are averaging 120.8 points over their last six outings after averaging 107.7 points in the first 19. The 25-point victory over Houston marked back-to-back 20-point wins for the Hornets, a feat they hadn\u2019t accomplished since 2017. Charlotte held Houston to just seven points in the fourth quarter as the Rockets shot 2 of 19. \u201cThis is a fun group. I love coaching them. They inspire me,\u201d Borrego said. \u201cI love the joy they play with, the unselfishness, the spirit that they have. Even when things aren\u2019t going well, they have a calm spirit about themselves, a positive spirit. I\u2019m just proud of them. They\u2019re a joy to be around.\u201d Ball contributed heavily to Borrego\u2019s warm, fuzzy feelings in the first half by hitting 4 of 6 from deep in addition to dishing five assists as the rookie and Gordon Hayward contributed 15 points apiece. Ball and Hayward represented just two of six double-figures scorers for Charlotte, which produced that many scorers in double figures for a league-best 12 th time this season. With Ball pushing the pace and testing his range from deep, Charlotte finished with a 25-13 advantage in fastbreak points to go with 19 3-pointers. The Hornets are 5-1 this season when they knock down 16 3-pointers or more. Ball\u2019s performance in that department against the Rockets certainly eased one of the major concerns Borrego and the Hornets coaching staff harbored when they first evaluated the rookie in the pre-Draft process. \u201cThere was concern on my part,\u201d Borrego said. \u201cBut when we went to L.A. to interview him and watch him, there was just a confidence about him in his shot. I think as I sat there with [general manager] Mitch [Kupchak], I looked over at him and said, \u2018He\u2019s gonna be fine.\u2019 The kid oozes confidence. He believes it\u2019s going in. That\u2019s at least half the battle in this thing. He\u2019s gonna continue that. He\u2019s fearless.\u201d Ball admitted that when he first arrived at Hornets training camp \u201cthey low-key tried to adjust\u201d his shot, but that\u2019s one of what he called \u201ca ton of stories\u201d about teams on virtually every level trying to coax the rookie into altering his stroke. \u201cI always stick with it myself. I said, \u2018This is how I shoot. I\u2019m confident in it. I\u2019m good, let me go,\u2019\u201d Ball said. \u201cSo, pretty much my whole life, [I] just stuck with it.\u201d It\u2019s paying off tremendously for Charlotte, as Ball is firing the long ball from way beyond the arc on many occasions. Ball is 19 of 37 from deep over the last five games as a starter, and Borrego believes the rookie\u2019s confidence to shoot the 3-ball from deeper range opens up Charlotte\u2019s offense. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult on a defense. If he\u2019s gonna make those shots, it\u2019s gonna be difficult to stay in front of him,\u201d Borrego said. \u201cIt opens up the court for everybody. You see that when ballhandlers, point guards can step out and shoot it with range. I guess the range he shot it with is really surprising. The way he shoots it with ease from range, it\u2019s almost the same effortless shot whether he\u2019s at the line or two feet behind the line.\u201d It\u2019s apparently effortless with limited pregame warmup time, too. \u201cThey had me waiting at my house because the COVID[-19] testing, something went wrong or something,\u201d Ball said. \u201cCame late, and I guess I was just hitting, for real. I really didn\u2019t get my same routine, none of it.\u201d * * * Michael C. Wright is a senior writer for NBA.com. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here  and follow him on Twitter .

LeVert still has not played and the Pacers have not announced a timetable for his return. Bayno, a longtime NBA assistant, also worked on McMillan\u2019s staff with the Portland Trail Blazers from 2009-11. Kevin Pritchard first hired Bayno as an assistant when he took over as Portland\u2019s interim coach in 2005. Pritchard is now the Pacers president of basketball operations. Bayno also spent time with the Minnesota Timberwolves and Toronto Raptors, worked in the now defunct Continental Basketball Association, the American Basketball Association and the Philippine Basketball Association and made college stops at Seton Hall, Kansas, Massachusetts and Baptist College, which was later renamed Charleston Southern.

Graham has scored 25 points on 8-12 (66.7%) shooting from the field and 7-10 (70%) from 3-point range, while dishing out eight assists with only one turnover when the game is on the line. \u2022 The Hornets enters Monday with a league-high 69.9% assist percentage and are tied for third in assist\/turnover ration (1.95). The last team to assist on at least 70 percent of their baskets over the course of a season was the 2016-17 Warriors . 9:30 p.m. ET, NBA TV \u2022 Nikola Jokic finished Saturday\u2019s loss to Sacramento with a career-best 50 points to go with 12 assists, eight rebounds and three blocks \u2014 a statline unmatched in NBA history (note: b locked shots have been compiled since 1973-74). The closest a player came to matching it was Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in 1975 when he finished 50 points, 11 assists, 15 rebounds and three blocks. \u2022 This is the first meeting of the season between the Nuggets and Bucks. Last season, the Nuggets were one of two teams (along with the Mavericks) to sweep the season series with the Bucks, who finished the season at a league-best 56-17 (0.767). \u2022 Milwaukee enters Monday riding a four-game win streak \u2014 tied with Utah, Los Angeles and Sacramento for the longest active streak in the league. During this four-game stretch, the Bucks have five players averaging at least 14 ppg, four players shooting at least 59% from the field and three players shooting at least 58% from 3-point range. \u2022 The Bucks (118.9) and Nuggets (115.0) rank 1st and 5th, respectively, in offensive efficiency this season. Individually , Giannis Antetokounmpo ranks 5th the league with a 120.6 offensive rating, while Nikola Jokic ranks 14th at 118.6. \u2022 Which team will win the battle of the paint?

And a little over a week ago, the league hit a milestone in regard to the latter. Last season was the most efficient in NBA history, with teams averaging 110.1 points scored per 100 possessions. This season, with the schedule a little less than 33% complete, the league has already surpassed that mark, scoring 110.7 per 100 through Sunday. Maybe it\u2019s the empty gyms. Maybe the lack of practice time has made it harder for teams to get on the same page defensively. Maybe the more condensed schedule is making it tougher to players to expend the requisite energy on on that end of the floor. And maybe, players are just more skilled every year. It\u2019s probably a combination of all that. But NBA offense has never been as efficient as it has been this season. And in the last two weeks, we\u2019ve seen six of the highest individual scoring games of the season. Fred VanVleet had 54 on Tuesday, and then Nikola Jokic and Stephen Curry had 50 and 57, respectively, on the same night. Both of their teams lost because the opponent\u2019s offense was better. With all this offense, the No. 1 spot in the Power Rankings is back in the hands of the team with the league\u2019s No. 1 defense. The Clippers and Sixers failed to hold onto their spots in the top two, so the champs are back in the top spot, with the red hot Utah Jazz right on their heels.

Note: All stats and records through games played on Sunday, Feb. 7 Warriors (12-11) at Spurs (13-10) 8:30 ET, NBA League Pass There have been five 50+ point games in the NBA this season \u2026 and Stephen Curry has two of them as he has posted the top two scoring performances of his career in 2021. Curry put up 57 points and 11 3-pointers against Dallas on Saturday, but it was not enough for the Warriors to get the win. How will he follow up that game? We\u2019ll see when the Warriors take on the Spurs on NBA League Pass. Curry leads the NBA in 3-pointers made with 111 and is shooting 42.5% from deep. Meanwhile, the Spurs allow the 5th-highest 3-point percentage in the league (38.9%). 76ers (17-7) at Kings (12-11) 10 ET, NBA League Pass The Kings enter Week 8 having won four straight and seven their last eight games. De\u2019Aaron Fox is making a push for his first All-Star selection with his play during this stretch \u2014 27.0 ppg (10.0 in the fourth quarter), 7.8 apg, 3.8 apg and 2.6 3pg. They face a Philadelphia team with the best record in the East and one of the league\u2019s top Kia MVP candidates in Joel Embiid , who enters this week averaging 29.3 ppg, 10.7 rpg and shooting 55.3%. The Sixers have won eight of their last 10 games, and are coming off a 16-point win over Brooklyn. Magic (9-15) at Trail Blazers (12-10) 10 p.m. ET, NBA League Pass Carmelo Anthony can climb as high as 10th on the NBA\u2019s all-time scoring list this season. He can take his next step up the leaderboard on Tuesday as he needs 12 points to pass Oscar Robertson (26,710) for 12th in career scoring. Melo\u2019s Run to the Top 10 Pacers (12-12) at Nets (14-11) 8 ET, NBA League Pass The Nets and Pacers enter this week ranked 3rd and 5th, respectively, in the East. Both teams looking tto get back on a winning track as the Pacers have lost three straight and five of their last six , while the Nets have lost two in a row and three of their last four . Brooklyn will have to do it without one member of the Big 3 as Kevin Durant is not expected to rejoin the team until Friday due to health and safety protocols. Even with the No. 2 scorer in the league sidelined, the Nets still have two of the top 20 scorers in the league in Kyrie Irving (7th, 27.5 ppg) and James Harden (18th, 24.1 ppg). Indiana is looking to bounce back from its lowest-scoring game of the season as they put up just 95 points in a loss to Utah \u2014 which entered the game with the top record in the NBA. Bucks (15-8) at Jazz (19-5) 9 p.m. ET, NBA League Pass Can I interest you in a matchup between the team with the best record in the NBA (Utah at 19-5) and the team that finished with the best record in the NBA in each of the past two seasons (Milwaukee, currently 15-8, 2nd in East)? The Jazz enter the week have won 15 of their last 16 games dating back to Jan. 8. During that stretch, Donovan Mitchell has averaged 24.8 points on 47.7% shooting from 3-point range. He is one of five Jazz players averaging at least eight points and shooting better than 40% from 3-point range. The Jazz (40.3%) and Bucks (40.1%) rank 2nd and 3rd, respectively, in 3-point percentage this season. Defensively, the Jazz allow the 5th-lowest 3-point percentage (35.0%), while the Bucks allow the 7th-highest (38.2%). The Jazz made a team-record 25 3-pointers in 53 attempts in their first meeting of the season with Milwaukee en route to a 131-118 win. Celtics (12-10) at Wizards (5-15) 1 ET, NBA League Pass This matchup features three of the top 12 scorers in the NBA this season. Bradley Beal leads all players at 33.2 ppg \u2014 nearly four points higher than any other player in the league. The Celtics duo of Jayson Tatum (10th, 27.0 ppg) and Jaylen Brown (26.4 ppg) are one of three pairs of teammates to each average over 25 ppg this season \u2014 joining Brooklyn\u2019s Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving and Portland\u2019s Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum. In their first meeting of the season, Tatum (32 points) and Brown (27 points) combined for 59 points to help the Celtics hold off Beal (41 points) and the Wizards for a 116-107 win.

Rose reunites with Tom Thibodeau, who coached him in Chicago and Minnesota. \u2014 Adrian Wojnarowski (@wojespn) February 7, 2021 Rose was one of the NBA\u2019s most explosive players early in his career, the superstar who led Thibodeau\u2019s defensive-minded teams to the best record in the league. But a series of knee injuries followed and neither he nor the Bulls could duplicate that early success. But Rose remains a productive player as a reserve, averaging about 18 points in each of the two previous seasons. He was scoring 14.2 per game in 15 games this season. Most important, he\u2019s familiar with Thibodeau, who could use some more scoring punch in his first season in New York. \u201cHe\u2019s one of those guys, he\u2019s been around the system just like myself,\u201d said Knicks forward Taj Gibson, who also played in Chicago and Minnesota. \u201cWe know kind of what Thibs basically wants.\u201d Elfrid Payton is the Knicks\u2019 starting point guard and first-round pick Immanuel Quickley has played well off the bench. Smith, a former top-10 pick, could never make an impact in New York after being acquired from Dallas as part of the Kristaps Porzingis trade just over two years ago. He was not in Thibodeau\u2019s rotation and was planning to play for the Knicks\u2019 G League affiliate just to get some games. Instead, he leaves after averaging just 8.7 points in 58 games. The deal continues the Pistons\u2019 total overhaul of last season\u2019s roster, having already moved on from players such as Andre Drummond, Luke Kennard, Reggie Jackson and Christian Wood. Rose gave the Pistons a lift at times last season, but wasn\u2019t much use to a rebuilding team in this one. His scoring and minutes were down this season as Detroit looked to rookie Killian Hayes at point guard before he was hurt, with Delon Wright also playing solidly at the position.

CHICAGO (AP) \u2014 The Chicago Bulls expect forward Lauri Markkanen to miss two to four weeks because of a sprained right shoulder, another setback for a 7-footer off to his best start as a pro. The Bulls said Monday an MRI confirmed he has a sprained acromioclavicular joint. Markkanen was hurt Friday at Orlando when he was fouled by Magic forward Gary Clark early in the third quarter. The Bulls were scheduled to host Washington on Monday. Coach Billy Donovan described the injury as a \u201cbit freakish\u201d with Markkanen \u201cdriving to the basket, being physical.\u201d Markkanen is averaging a career-high 19.1 points and 6.1 rebounds coming off a disappointing season. He is shooting 51% overall and about 40% on 3-pointers \u2014 both personal bests. Markkanen had back-to-back outings with 30 or more points against Portland and New York on Jan. 30 and Feb. 1. He missed seven consecutive games early in the season because of COVID-19 protocols. The No. 7 overall pick in the 2017 draft, Markkanen has not played in more than 52 games the past two seasons. He appeared in 50 last year as Chicago stumbled to a 22-43 record. Markkanen is set to become a restricted free agent after he and the Bulls were unable to agree to a contract extension prior to the deadline in December. \u201cI don\u2019t know if organizationally, they\u2019ll be evaluating it as \u2018Well, this guy got hurt a couple years ago.

Center Wendell Carter Jr. has been sidelined since Jan. 18 and is not expected back until at least the end of the month. The injuries complicate the Bulls\u2019 efforts to limit veteran Thaddeus Young\u2019s minutes. Forward Otto Porter Jr. missed his fourth consecutive game Monday because of back spasms.

The deal, initially reported by The Athletic on Sunday, sent Rose to New York for guard Dennis Smith Jr. and a 2021 second-round pick (via Charlotte). Rose spent one season with the Knicks in 2016-17, sputtering together on and off the court to a 31-51 record. Now the 2011 NBA Most Valuable Player re-joins coach Tom Thibodeau, with whom Rose worked during his most successful period in Chicago prior to suffering a left ACL knee injury in April 2012. The two were together, too, for parts of the 2017-18 and \u201918-19 seasons in Minnesota. Now Thibodeau gets a 32-year-old who, while still athletic, adapted his game to sixth-man duty with the Timberwolves and the Pistons. Rose averaged 18.1 points in 26 minutes in 2019-20 for Detroit, and was at 14.2 points in 22.8 minutes through 15 Pistons appearances this season. His role in New York immediately generated some controversy, pitting fans encouraged by the team\u2019s 11-13 start, good for 7 th place in the Eastern Conference, against those focused on an obvious rebuild. With Smith gone, Thibodeau\u2019s options at point guard are inefficient starter Elfrid Payton, little-used Frank Ntilikina or rookie Immanuel Quickley. Turning over Quickley\u2019s developmental minutes to Rose would make little sense, even if the Knicks are desperate for their first postseason berth in eight years. Relying on Rose as a model and mentor for the newcomer from Kentucky, though, could pay off. That, after all, is how the Pistons envisioned Rose working with lottery pick Killian Hayes until Hayes suffered a hip labral tear in his seventh game. Hayes started, Rose came off the bench \u2013 a pecking order that some Knicks faithful, excited by Quickley\u2019s scoring skills (17.7 ppg in seven games prior to Sunday vs. Miami), might prefer for Thibodeau\u2019s rotation. Smith had been seen as a Rose-like scoring point guard when Dallas picked him ninth in the 2017 Draft. The product of North Carolina State averaged 14.5 points and 4.9 assists while starting 101 games for the Mavericks prior to being traded in January 2019 in the Kristaps Porzingis deal. But shaky shooting in Dallas (40.6%) got worse in New York (37.9), and between injuries and poor performances, Smith\u2019s court time and opportunities to earn more dwindled. The 5-18 Pistons might be able to give the 23-year-old guard enough reps and attention to revive his game. Rose had his own frustrations in his first stint in New York. He put up some solid individual numbers, averaging 18.0 points and 3.3 assists in 32.5 minutes. But he also generated distracting headlines as the defendant in a sexual assault trial, then went AWOL for one game in January 2017. Now in his 13 th NBA season (counting the 2012-13 year lost entirely to recover and rehab), Rose\u2019s offensive instincts are intact. He averaged a career best 1.2 steals for Detroit and his per-36 scoring rate of 22.4 points per game is only slightly off what it was as the 2011 MVP (24.1). None of it translated into winning, especially with the Pistons ranked near the bottom in both offensive (.500) and defensive (.561) effective field goal percentage. Rose playing out this season as a free agent-to-be with the going-nowhere Pistons would have been a waste. The Knicks for know at least offer a sniff of the playoffs, especially with the play-in mechanism extending to teams in 10 th place. But other teams rumored to have had interest \u2013 the Clippers, Heat, Nets and Bucks \u2013 could have thrust Rose into top playoff contention. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

The Yahoo database will be utilized, and only players rostered in less than 50% of leagues will be mentioned. Justin Holiday (SG\/SF \u2013 IND) : 47% rostered Since T. J. Warren went down with a foot injury, Holiday has started 14 games and put up top 90 production on a per-game basis. Over the last four games, though, he\u2019s been a top 35 player, as he\u2019s averaged 32.6 minutes, 13.3 points, 3.3 three-pointers, five rebounds, 1.8 assists, 1.8 steals, and 0.8 blocks while shooting 47% from the field and 85% from the line. The shooting efficiency has been an eye-opener as he shot 42%, 38%, and 37% in the last three seasons. Some regression could be in order but, as of now, ride the hand. He\u2019s also playing a ton of minutes, which is half the battle. Juan Toscano-Anderson (SF\/PF \u2013 GS) : 10% rostered Kevon Looney is out two weeks with an ankle injury, while James Wiseman will miss the next two games due to a wrist injury. Therefore, Toscano-Anderson should make his third and fourth consecutive starts. He did start two games early in the season but only played 19 and 24 minutes in those contests. Over the last three games when he\u2019s filled in due to injuries, Toscano-Anderson has averaged 33.4 minutes, 10.7 points, 1.7 three-pointers, 6.7 rebounds, 2.7 assists, one steal, and one block while shooting 72% from the field. He\u2019s been a top 50 player! He\u2019s not going to shoot over 50% from the field every game, but he\u2019s going to play a ton of minutes and contribute across the board. Just realize that when Wiseman returns, Toscano-Anderson will likely return to being a pumpkin. Derrick Favors (PF\/C \u2013 UTA) : 12% rostered Favors has played over 20 minutes in a game just three times this season. He\u2019s scored in double figures just twice. Over the past four games, though, he\u2019s been a top 60 player. Why? He\u2019s averaging 6.3 rebounds, 1.3 steals, and 1.5 blocks while shooting 56% from the field and 91% from the line on three attempts per game. He\u2019s a career 66% shooter from the line, so don\u2019t expect that efficiency to continue, but if you need rebounds and defensive stats, do yourself a Favors. Kelly Olynyk (PF\/C \u2013 MIA) : 29% rostered Olynyk is frustrating to roster because of the inconsistency. While he\u2019s started 15 of the last 16 games, he has a high of 45 minutes played with a low of 18. He\u2019s scored in double figures 10 times while contributing five or fewer points in five games. With that said, he provides three-pointers from the big man position, grabs rebounds, and can dish out some assists. He even chips in some defensive stats from time to time. The floor is low, but if you like to live dangerously, Olynyk can access ceiling games. He has highs of 19 points, five three-pointers, 11 rebounds, eight assists, three steals, and two blocks in a game this year. Kendrick Nunn (PG\/SG \u2013 MIA) : 30% rostered Avery Bradley is out for a few weeks, but much of this recommendation has to do with the health of Goran Dragic, who is dealing with an ankle injury. When the Heat are healthy, Nunn rarely sees the floor. When he plays, though, he plays a ton of minutes, often in the mid-30s. Over the last nine games that he\u2019s actually played, Nunn has averaged 33.9 minutes, 17.3 points, 2.1 three-pointers, 4.7 rebounds, 2.7 assists, and 1.3 steals while shooting 50% from the field and 78% from the line. He averages a usage rate of around 22, but that can spike up closer to 30 when guys are missing. Royce O\u2019Neale (SF\/PF \u2013 UTA) : 39% rostered The vanilla ice cream of fantasy, O\u2019Neale doesn\u2019t look or taste particularly special, but it\u2019s still ice cream! He\u2019s posting top 100 value on a per-game basis because he contributes a little something in every category without hurting in any. He also plays over 30 minutes per game.

Andre Drummond (C \u2013 CLE) : $7,200 at PHO  I\u2019ll keep highlighting him as a value until they fire me from this article (or until his price starts to climb again, whichever comes first). Despite sharing time in the frontcourt with Jarrett Allen, Drummond still has massive upside. He\u2019s averaged 43 FD points across his last two. Malik Beasley (SF \u2013 MIN) : $6,900 at DAL  D\u2019Angelo Russell could miss his second straight game tonight, and if he does, Beasley stands to benefit the most. His offense will be needed tonight against a Luka-led Dallas squad that can put up points in bunches. DeMarcus Cousins (C \u2013 HOU) : $6,000 at CHA  With Christian Wood on the shelf, it\u2019s time to boogie over to Cousins at just $6K on tonight\u2019s slate. He logged 30 minutes his last game out, and he should see some quality playing time moving forward. The matchup with Charlotte\u2019s frontcourt is juicy, as well! Anthony Edwards (SG \u2013 MIN) : $5,800 at DAL  After a slow start to the season, the 2020 No.1 overall pick has been on a roll as of late, being more aggressive while seeing stable playing time. Across his last five, the rookie has averaged better than 30 minutes while posting two games with at least 41 FD points. He\u2019s a great value tonight against Dallas, especially if D-Lo sits this one out. Derrick White (PG \u2013 SAS) : $5,500 vs. GSW  White made his way back to the Spurs\u2019 starting lineup Saturday, and that\u2019s where he should remain moving forward. He\u2019s missed 18 games this season, but his minutes and production have been steadily ramping up over the last week. I\u2019m more than willing to pay $5.5K for a starter in a great matchup. Juan Toscano-Anderson (SF \u2013 GSW) : $5,300 at SAS  Juan T has averaged just under 33 minutes per game over his last three with Kevon Looney and James Wiseman out of action, and he should be expected to see similar court time tonight in an exploitable matchup with the Spurs. I love the price tag here. Michael Porter (SF \u2013 DEN) : $5,200 vs. MIL  Has there been a more frustrating player than MPJ this season? He\u2019s got a ton of potential, but his playing time has fluctuated all season, while JaMychal Green has been a staple in the Nuggets\u2019 rotation. Still, Jamal Murray could be out tonight, and if he is, MPJ is a huge value here. Donte DiVincenzo (SG \u2013 MIL) : $4,300 at DEN  Across his last three games, DDV has averaged 11.3 points, 7.3 boards, 3.3 dimes, 1.0 combined blocks\/steals, and tonight\u2019s matchup with Denver features one of the highest over\/unders of the night. If I\u2019m really looking to save some coin, DiVincenzo is my man here.  Monte Morris (PG \u2013 DEN) : $4,200 vs. MIL  Jamal Murray is a GTD, and if he sits, Morris should start at PG. Morris started Saturday against the Kings and scored 28.5 FD points in 34 minutes of action. He comes in at a rock-bottom price on tonight\u2019s slate."},{"id":489934,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nba-players-react-to-super-bowl-lv","date":"2021-02-08","title":"NBA players, legends react to Super Bowl LV","content":"It\u2019s hard to script two quarterbacks more recognizable than Patrick Mahomes and Tom Brady going head-to-head in the Super Bowl.

Here are five things to watch during this matchup: Utah is 14-1 in its last 15 games dating back to Jan. 8. That\u2019s a pretty strong month of hoops. During this stretch, the Jazz rank third in points scored (118.1 per game) and points allowed (only 104.0), giving them a league-high 14.1 differential . All but one of their games during this run have been decided by double-digits . Led by Donovan Mitchell\u2019s 24.6 ppg, the Jazz have four players averaging at least 16 ppg during this 15-game stretch, with Jordan Clarkson (18.7 ppg off the bench), Bojan Bogdanovic (18.0 ppg) and Mike Conley (16.0 ppg) joining Mitchell. And that list doesn\u2019t include Rudy Gobert, who has been strong on both ends of the court, averaging 12.7 points, 13.7 rebounds and 2.8 blocks. Joe Ingles is the sixth Jazz player averaging in double figures at 10.4 ppg, while appearing in 11 of the 15 games. Can Utah keep this momentum in Indianapolis? The Jazz are 9-3 on the road this season, trailing only the Los Angeles Lakers for the best road record in the league. Donovan Mitchell ranked fifth among Western Conference guards in the first NBA All-Star ballot returns , trailing Stephen Curry, Luka Doncic, Damian Lillard and Ja Morant in the fan vote. Whether he\u2019s voted in as a starter or not \u2014 we have to wait for the final fan returns, which account for 50 percent of the vote, as well as the 25 percent apiece from current players and media \u2014 it is highly likely that Mitchell will earn his second straight All-Star nod. The fourth-year pro is averaging 23.3 points and is shooting a career-best 41.5 percent from 3-point range on a career-high 8.4 attempts per game, and also dishing out a career-high 4.6 dimes a contest. The Jazz lead the NBA with 17.1 3-pointers made per game and have the second-highest 3-point percentage at 40.7%. Utah is on pace to make the most 3-pointers per game of any team in league history. The Houston Rockets currently hold the top three marks \u2014 coming in each of the past three seasons \u2014 but Utah is ahead of that pace by 1.0 3-pointer made per game. Utah could be in a for a big night behind the arc as the Pacers allow the highest 3-point percentage in the league (39.7%). They do hold their opponents to the sixth-fewest 3-point attempts (32.5 per game). However, the Jazz have attempted fewer than 32 3-point attempts only once this season \u2013 in their last game, which was a 21-point win over Atlanta. Another player looking for his second straight All-Star selection is Indiana\u2019s Domantas Sabonis, who is currently ranked seventh among Eastern Conference front court players in the fan vote. Here is the list of players currently averaging at least 20 points, 10 rebounds and 5 assists : two-time reigning MVP Giannis Antetokoumpo, Nikola Jokic, Julius Randle and Sabonis. There have been only 14 players in league history that have averaged those numbers for an entire season. Sabonis ranks second in the league in double-doubles with 20 in his first 23 games of the season. After putting up back-to-back 30-point double-doubles, Sabonis was held to a season-low eight points in a loss to New Orleans on Friday. Can Sabonis bounce back with a big performance against Gobert and the Jazz? When it comes to setting screens, there aren\u2019t many that do it better than Sabonis and Gobert. The two are tied for the league lead in screen assists with 6.7 per game each. The Jazz average 16.5 ppg off Gobert screens, while the Pacers average 15.9 ppg off Sabonis screens. Between the 21.0 points that he scores , the 15.0 points created by his traditional assists and the 15.9 points created by his screen assists , Sabonis is involved in 51.9 of Indiana\u2019s 113.9 points per game (45.6%). According to Synergy play type data, the Jazz lead the league with 25.0 ppg coming from pick-and-roll ball handler plays thanks in large part to Gobert\u2019s screens. Mitchell accounts for a team-high 8.7 of those points."},{"id":489169,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nikola-jokic-scores-career-high-50-points-in-losing-effort","date":"2021-02-07","title":"Nikola Jokic first center since Kareem to put up 50 points, 10 assists","content":"Just another day at the office for the incomparable Nikola Jokic: 50 points, 12 assists, 8 rebounds and 3 blocks on 20-for-33 shooting .

And if they do watch with others, keep the invite list basically to family only. Teams spending Sunday on the road will not be permitted to leave their hotel to watch the Kansas City-Tampa Bay game, according to the memo obtained by The Associated Press. Watching in a pre-arranged, private area with a small number of family members who have been tested is permitted under certain circumstances, the NBA said. There are five games on Super Sunday: Washington at Charlotte, Miami at New York, Utah at Indiana, Boston at Phoenix and Sacramento at the Los Angeles Clippers. All will start between 1 p.m. and 3 p.m. Eastern, meaning all should be done long before kickoff between the Chiefs and Buccaneers. Some of those road teams may be flying to their next destination during the Super Bowl. Washington plays in Chicago on Monday night, and the Wizards are hoping to get there from Charlotte by halftime of the Bucs-Chiefs game. \u201cI love watching it,\u201d Wizards coach Scott Brooks said. \u201cI love being a part but this year is obviously different. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re going to have a Super Bowl party. I definitely like that atmosphere year to year and a lot of times if you do have it on the road you can have a big team activity and enjoy the game together. But this is obviously different.\u201d The Heat plan to be in the air for at least some of the game, flying home after their matchup with the Knicks. In past years, when on the road, Miami has delayed flights or made other accommodations for Super Bowl team gatherings \u2014 but not this year. The league had 27 players test positive in a two-week span of January \u2014 a period in which the NBA expected numbers to rise following Christmas and New Year\u2019s gatherings. Those results, combined with other players having to miss games because contact tracing showed that they may have been exposed to a person positive for the virus, were why 21 games were postponed between Jan. 10 and Jan. 27. Test results since have been trending the right way, with only one new player testing positive in results released by the league between Jan. 20 and this past Wednesday. But the virus is still very much a concern, as evidenced most recently by the contact-tracing situation that snagged Brooklyn\u2019s Kevin Durant on Friday night. The Super Bowl plan is designed to avoid more potential contact-tracing pratfalls as one of the top priorities. Clubs are instructed to not host in-person Super Bowl gatherings at a team facility. Having people together for that long would violate the league\u2019s stricter protocols that went into effect last month and will remain in place into next week at least."},{"id":488970,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/tune-in-tidbits-abc-saturday-primetime-feb-6-2021","date":"2021-02-06","title":"Tune-In Tidbits: ABC Saturday Primetime, Feb. 6, 2021","content":"5 key stats to know about the Warriors-Mavericks matchup on ABC Warriors (12-10) at Mavericks (9-14), 8:30 p.m. ET, ABC \u2022 Golden State won the first meeting of the season with Dallas on Saturday with a 147-116 blowout . The Warriors\u2019 147 points matched the second-highest scoring output in the league this season.

Coby White (PG \u2013 CHI) $5,600 at ORL  White\u2019s salary is remarkably lower than his average price of $6,800, and it\u2019s hard not to take advantage of this considering the Bulls will be without Lauri Markkanen in this one. Despite the up and down production, White has seen 30+ minutes in 17 of the last 21 games and should see increased usage on Saturday. He\u2019s averaged just under 1.0 FanDuel point per minute in 365 minutes without Markkanen on the floor and has seen his usage rate bump up to 22.8%. Juan Toscano-Anderson (SF \u2013 GS): $5,400 at DAL JTA has been rewarded some extra playing time over the last two games, and he\u2019s answered the call. The 27-year-old forward has seen 32.5 minutes across his two previous games and has posted 61 total FanDuel points. Vegas has Saturday\u2019s game against the Mavericks pegged for a shootout, as it\u2019s boasting the second-highest over\/under on the slate at 231. It\u2019s also worth noting that JTA just posted 14 points, eight rebounds, five assists, and two blocks in 39 minutes during Thursday\u2019s win over the Mavericks, in which there were 263 total points scored. Cole Anthony (PG \u2013 ORL) $5,000 vs. CHI Anthony is seeing a 24.8% usage rate with Aaron Gordon out of the lineup and has reached 30 or minutes in each of his last eight games. He just went for 37.3 FanDuel points in Friday\u2019s win over the Bulls and gets a rematch with a team giving up the fourth-most FanDuel points to opposing point guards this season. Chris Boucher (PF \u2013 TOR): $4,700 at ATL Boucher has been one of the most frustrating fantasy players this season, but it\u2019s becoming clear that he\u2019s entirely matchup dependent. He won\u2019t get too much run against skilled bigs who can stretch the floor and shoot the ball. Fortunately for him, Clint Capela is mostly a lob threat on offense, and the Hawks won\u2019t typically run the offense through him. Boucher just posted 17 points, nine rebounds and two blocks in 27 minutes during Friday\u2019s game against the Nets and could be in line for similar production on Saturday. Bruce Brown (SG- BKN): $4,300 AT PHI Brown was thrust into the starting lineup on Friday, with Kevin Durant battling the league\u2019s Health and Safety Protocols. Durant was ultimately ruled out for Saturday\u2019s game against the Sixers, and Brown should once again garner the start. He\u2019s been productive when given the playing time and could easily push for 30+ minutes in this one. Not to mention Saturday\u2019s tilt against the 76ers has the highest over\/under on the slate at 238.5. Brown has averaged just under 0.80 FanDuel points per minute in 190 minutes with Durant off the floor this season and just posted 25.2 FanDuel points in his place on Friday. Kenrich Williams (SF- OKC): $4,000 vs. MIN Williams has been one of the few Thunder players benefiting from the plethora of injuries currently plaguing the team. He\u2019s seen just under 30 minutes over his last two games and has averaged 24 FanDuel points during that span. It\u2019s hard to pass up on his $4,000 price tag as he\u2019ll likely log more than 30 minutes and see a 25% usage rate on Saturday. Isaiah Roby (PF \u2013 OKC): $3,900 vs. MIN Roby enjoyed some fantasy relevance earlier this season but was relegated to the bench when Al Horford returned to the team. With all the injuries currently facing the team, Roby was inserted into the starting lineup alongside Horford on Friday. He responded with nearly 37 FanDuel points in 33 minutes of action. We know he can produce when given the minutes, and that should be the case in Saturday\u2019s rematch against the Timberwolves."},{"id":488802,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/rockets-center-christian-wood-week-to-week-with-right-ankle-sprain","date":"2021-02-06","title":"Rockets center Christian Wood week-to-week with right ankle sprain","content":"Houston Rockets center Christian Wood, who left Thursday night\u2019s game in a wheelchair after rolling his right ankle, underwent an MRI on Friday and was diagnosed with a sprained ankle.

Durant wasn\u2019t available at the beginning of Friday night\u2019s game against Toronto, eventually being cleared to enter in the first quarter. Once he did, it became his first appearance as a reserve in his 867 NBA games. The strange situation \u2014 Durant had originally been listed in the starting lineup before being removed \u2014 had the Nets dealing with a number of emotions. \u201cConfusing, frustrating. I mean, it\u2019s bizarre,\u201d teammate Joe Harris said. The questions continued well after Toronto\u2019s 123-117 victory. The Nets were cleared to travel to Philadelphia for their game scheduled for Saturday, but Durant wouldn\u2019t accompany them while the team awaited word on contract tracing. He voiced his anger through social media, notably tweeting \u201cFree me\u201d. NBA spokesman Tim Frank said in a statement that Durant had tested negative three times in the last 24 hours, including two negative PCR tests Friday. He said someone whom Durant interacted with in the afternoon had an inconclusive test result return shortly before the game. Durant was initially held out while that result was being reviewed. \u201cUnder the league\u2019s health and safety protocols, we do not require a player to be quarantined until a close contact has a confirmed positive test,\u201d Frank said. \u201cDuring the game, a positive result was returned for the person Durant interacted with. \u2026 Once that test was confirmed positive, out of an abundance of caution, Durant was removed from the game.\u201d Frank said contact tracing is underway to determine if Durant was in close contact of the individual who tested positive. Durant helped the Nets rally to take the lead before he was informed in the third quarter that he needed to exit the game. Replays showed coach Steve Nash appearing to give the news to Durant, who walked toward the locker room area and threw a water bottle in frustration. The Nets then announced he was out for the rest of the night. \u201cI don\u2019t get it. It\u2019s frustrating obviously,\u201d the Nets\u2019 Jeff Green said. \u201cI mean, they let him play, then they take him out. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t get it.\u201d Durant had already missed three games this season related to the Health and Safety protocols. He tested positive for the virus in March while he was recovering from Achilles tendon surgery. According to the Elias Sports Bureau, Durant had the fourth-longest streak of games started (866) before coming off the bench since 1970-71 (when starts were first tracked). Only Patrick Ewing (1,118), Carmelo Anthony (1,054) and Chris Paul (1,041) had longer streaks than Durant. Durant finished with eight points. He had scored at least 20 points in all of his 17 games thus far, the longest streak to begin a season in his career."},{"id":488367,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/fanduel-dfs-values-of-the-night-friday-feb-5","date":"2021-02-05","title":"FanDuel DFS Values Of The Night: Friday (Feb. 5)","content":"Andre Drummond (C \u2013 CLE) : $7,500 vs. MIL Drummond is purely a tournament play tonight. He\u2019s seen his minutes fluctuate since Jarrett Allen was added to the lineup, and Drummond went for just 19.5 FD points in his last game. Even sharing the frontcourt with Allen, that kind of production is not the norm for Drummond. He\u2019s got 60-point upside and is sure to be extremely low-rostered. Thaddeus Young (C \u2013 CHI) : $6,600 at ORL  Young has been a revelation for Chicago as of late, going for 41.6 FD points across his last four games. With Wendell Carter still on the shelf, it\u2019s Thad\u2019s world, and we\u2019re just living in it. He\u2019s come just shy of a triple-double in three games during that remarkable span, and I\u2019m more than willing to spend $6.6K for that kind of upside. Kemba Walker (PG \u2013 BOS) : $5,700 at LAC  This hasn\u2019t been the season many in the fantasy community envisioned from Walker, but\u2026 it\u2019s still Kemba Walker. He went for 34.9 FD points in his last game and will be playing fresh tonight after taking Wednesday off for rest. Any time he\u2019s priced this low, Walker is worth a shot in tournament lineups. Darius Bazley (PF \u2013 OKC) : $5,600 vs. MIN  Bazley nearly went for 40 FD points in his last game, and with Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Lu Dort, and George Hill out, expect Bazley to see some heavy usage against the Wolves. Devonte\u2019 Graham (SG \u2013 CHA) : $5,400 vs. UTA  Graham continues to play heavy minutes for Charlotte, having played no fewer than 32 minutes in a game since Jan. 6. The emergence of sensational rookie LaMelo Ball has overshadowed Graham\u2019s solid play in his third season, and he likely won\u2019t be highly rostered on tonight\u2019s slate. Theo Maledon (PG \u2013 OKC) : $4,800 vs. MIN  With the Thunder down so many players again, Maledon should slot back into the starting lineup against the T-Wolves. He\u2019s scored better than 33 FD points in two of his last three games, yet he\u2019s still priced under $5K against a Minnesota team that plays no defense. Miles Bridges (SF \u2013 CHA) : $4,800 vs. UTA  With PJ Washington out again, Bridges should be in Charlotte\u2019s starting lineup tonight. In his last game, Bridges went for 31.9 FD points, and he\u2019s averaged 24 across his last three. The matchup isn\u2019t ideal, but for DFS, we\u2019re looking for minutes, opportunity and an affordable salary. Bridges checks all the boxes. Frank Kaminsky (PF \u2013 PHO) : $4,500 vs. DET  Kaminsky has seen his production tick up over the last week, averaging better than 25 FD points across his last four games. Dario Saric remains out, and Jae Crowder may not take the court either. That leaves Kaminsky staring at some additional opportunity against Detroit. Jordan Clarkson (SG \u2013 UTA) : $4,500 at CHA  Clarkson has cooled down a little bit since Donovan Mitchell returned from his two-game absence, but you shouldn\u2019t forget the quality of play he\u2019s put forth this season. Clarkson has legitimate 40 FD-point upside, and he may be back on a heater after scoring 23 real-life points against Atlanta last night. There\u2019s no reason he should be priced at just $4.5K. Kenrich Williams (SF \u2013 OKC) : $3,500 vs. MIN  Williams has logged at least 20 minutes in each of his last two games, and he\u2019s expected to see plenty of run tonight. In his last game out, Williams went 19\/6\/2, and you\u2019d be hard-pressed to find another player with this kind of upside at the bare-minimum price on this slate."},{"id":488322,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/tune-in-tidbits-espn-friday-feb-5-2021","date":"2021-02-05","title":"Tune-In Tidbits: ESPN Friday, Feb. 5, 2021","content":"Get ready for Friday\u2019s ESPN doubleheader with five key stats to know about each matchup. \u2022 Fred VanVleet is coming off a career-high and Raptors franchise-record 54 points in Toronto\u2019s win over Orlando on Tuesday. It was the third 50+ point game in the NBA this season with VanVleet joining Bradley Beal (60) and Stephen Curry (62). While Beal and Curry are both top five scorers this season, VanVleet ranks 34th at 20.4 ppg \u2013 a career best for the fifth-year guard. \u2022 James Harden leads the NBA in assists at 11.2 per game. There has been an added emphasis on his playmaking since joining the Brooklyn Nets on Jan. 16. In eight games with Houston, Harden averaged 10.4 assists and 16.9 shot attempts per game. In nine games with Brooklyn, Harden has averaged 12.0 assists and 15.4 shot attempts per game. \u2022 One quarter of James Harden\u2019s 12 assists per game are going to Kevin Durant, who is shooting 58.9% from the field and 66.7% on 3-pointers off passes from Harden . After Durant\u2019s 3.0 assists per game, Harden\u2019s most frequent assist parters have been Joe Harris (2.4 per game) and Jeff Green (2.3 per game). \u2022 Kyle Lowry leads the NBA in charges drawn so far this season with 12 in 18 games played. Since Hustle Stats debuted during the 2016-17 season, Lowry has led the league twice ( 2019-20 and 2017-18 ) and finished outside the top six only once in four seasons. \u2022 This is a matchup of two of the top 3-point shooting teams in the league. Brooklyn ranks second in 3-point percentage (40.1%) and ranks sixth in 3s per game (14.7), while Toronto ranks eighth in 3-point percentage (37.8%) and second in 3s per game (16.1). The Raptors lead the NBA in 3-point attempts (42.5 per game) \u2013 nearly six more per game than Brooklyn. Defensively, the Nets hold their opponents to 36.0% shooting from three (8th lowest allowed), while the Raptors rank 14th by allowing 36.8% shooting from three. \u2022 Among the top 300 players in minutes played, Kawhi Leonard ranks first in the league in offensive efficiency with the Clippers scoring 124.5 points per 100 possessions while he is on the court. \u2022 There are five players in the NBA this season putting up 50-40-90 shooting splits (FG%-3P%-FT%), with two of those players on the Clippers. Kawhi Leonard (51.3 FG%, 40.4 3P%, 90.9 FT%) is shooting a career-best from the free throw line and posting his second-best shooting percentages from the field (52.2%, 2013-14) and from three (44.3%, 2015-16) \u2013 both of which game during his time in San Antonio. \u2022 Paul George ranks seventh in the league in 3-point percentage with a career-high mark of 47.8%, which is a 6.6 percentage point increase from his previous career best from last season. George ranks fifth in the league in 3-pointers made per game (3.8) and 14th in 3-pointers attempted per game (7.9). Among high-volume 3-point shooters (5+ 3PA per game), George\u2019s 47.8% accuracy ranks third among the 85 qualified players. \u2022 Which team will be better coming out of halftime? The Clippers lead the NBA with an average of 31.0 ppg in the third quarter , outscoring their opponents by league-best 4.7 points . The Celtics rank fifth at 30.4 ppg, but average just a 0.3-point advantage after the quarter. \u2022 The Celtics rank second in the league in most unassisted baskets , with only 54.4% of their field goals being generated by an assist. The Celtics rank fifth in the league in field goal attempts coming after seven or more dribbles by the shooter (11.4 per game). Kemba Walker accounts for 6.0 of those attempts ( 10th in NBA ), followed by Jayson Tatum at 3.7 per game."},{"id":488301,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/kia-mvp-ladder-feb-5-2021-edition","date":"2021-02-05","title":"Kia MVP Ladder: LeBron James continues to prove his greatness","content":"Nikola Jokic dryly doused us with jokes ahead of Thursday\u2019s showdown against LeBron James, only to catch a serious reminder of why the Los Angeles Lakers star remains atop this week\u2019s Kia Race to the MVP Ladder. \u201cGuys, he\u2019s the best player in the league,\u201d Jokic said of James on Wednesday. \u201cHe\u2019s a guy who [has been] doing this for a long time and affects the game in every possible way.\u201d James provided plenty of evidence in the Lakers\u2019 113-93 win over the Nuggets by reeling off his second triple-double (27 points, 10 rebounds, 10 assists) of the season \u2014 not to mention the 96 th of his NBA career \u2014 while also sliding past Wilt Chamberlain for third place all-time in career field goals made (12,691), as Los Angeles captured its 11 th victory in 14 games. \u201cAnytime I\u2019m in the category of some of the greats that have ever played this game is just very humbling,\u201d James said in his TNT postgame interview . \u201cTo hear me linked with the great Wilt Chamberlain is an unbelievable feat.\u201d James capped his highlight-filled night with this nasty dime to Talen Horton-Tucker. \u201cFor me to go out here and do the things I do every single night is a testament to the man above, and also my loved ones, who have given me the support every single night to go out and do what I love to do,\u201d James said. \u201cSo, I just try to give back to the game. The game has given me so much over this 18-year career so far, and I hope I just continue to give back to it.\u201d We do, too. But let\u2019s remember we\u2019re nearly just a third of the way into the season, which means there\u2019s still plenty of time for players to move up and down the MVP Ladder. On a more somber note, as you all know, just 11 days ago we lost dear friend Sekou Smith, our MVP here at NBA.com . In continuing this feature that Sekou made special for so many of us all over the world, we can only hope to constantly honor him, his family, and his boundless love for the game. We miss you dearly, boss. The Top 5 this week in the 2020-21 Kia Race to the MVP Ladder: Season stats: 25.0 ppg, 7.7 rpg, 7.5 apg At 36 in Year 18, the King continues to show no signs of slowing down, as he\u2019s now notched at least 15 points, five rebounds and five assists in all 23 games to start the season. That breaks his own league record set in 2011-12 for the most such games to start a season. We can debate whether James deserved more than the four Kia MVPs already in his trophy case (he did), but if he keeps this up, it\u2019s going to be tough to deny this man MVP No. 5. Season stats: 29.1 ppg, 11.1 rpg, 1.3 bpg, 1.2 spg With Ben Simmons out due to left calf tightness against the shorthanded Blazers on Thursday, Embiid dropped 31 points in the first half, including 25 of his team\u2019s 29 points in the second quarter on 8-of-11 shooting, on the way to a 37-point night. Before the setback against Portland, the 76ers were 11-0 when Embiid scored 25 or more. But they\u2019re winless (0-3) without Simmons on the floor. Embiid has racked up 34 or more in six of his last seven outings. As a result, Philadelphia had won seven of eight before running into Portland. Season stats: 26.8 ppg, 11.8 rpg, 8.6 apg, 1.7 spg Rough night against the Lakers, as Jokic shot 6 of 16. But the big man has produced a double-double in all 21 games, which is the longest such streak to start a season since Bill Walton put on a double-double clinic for 34 straight games to start the 1976-77 season for Portland. Jokic is just the fourth player in NBA history to put up 500-plus points and register 200-plus rebounds to go with 150 or more assists through his first 20 games of a season, according to Elias Sports Bureau . Season stats: 30.8 ppg, 7.5 rpg, 5.2 apg You know who he is. The man is on a mission , averaging 32.3 ppg over Brooklyn\u2019s last 10 games as it prepares to host the Toronto Raptors tonight at the Barclays Center ( 7:30 ET, ESPN ). So, it\u2019s no surprise Durant came out No. 1 in early returns from NBA All-Star voting. The Nets own a record of 4-1 whenever Durant, James Harden and Kyrie Irving play in the same game, and you can bet the trio\u2019s chemistry will continue to build into something nightmarish for opponents once the postseason hits. Season stats: 26.2 ppg, 5.3 rpg, 5.3 apg, 1.9 spg Durant called Leonard a \u201csavant\u201d and \u201cHall of Fame player,\u201d on Tuesday after the Nets edged the Clippers. But it seems we don\u2019t hear much mention of the Clippers star in the MVP conversation. That should stop. He\u2019s the winningest player in the regular season in league history (408-135) going into tonight\u2019s game against the Boston Celtics ( 10 ET, ESPN ). He\u2019s scored 31 or more in four of his last seven games, knocking down 50% or better from the field in five consecutive outings. There\u2019s a reason some call him \u201cMr. Leonard.\u201d 6 .

And so you know how the Brooklyn Nets feel whenever their defense springs a geyser, which happens far too often for a high-priced, superstar-stuffed and championship-hopeful team. As the Nets progress toward midseason, leaving behind a trail of victims but also question marks, their ability to make a stand will ultimately dictate their ability to make a run at a title. The good news for Brooklyn: The Nets are coming off a big victory where they temporarily turned the volume down on that concern, and they also realize there\u2019s plenty of time to apply a more permanent fix before springtime, when the real test begins. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be a good team if we can do that every night,\u201d Nets coach Steve Nash said. He meant the way the Nets, at various moments of truth Tuesday, handcuffed an elite team in the West and produced their most impressive win of the season , all things considered. The LA Clippers had no real answers late in the fourth quarter, which was a relief for a Brooklyn team fresh from being traumatized by the Washington Wizards, of all teams, in the final and frantic seconds of a demoralizing defeat a few nights earlier. Quite simply, the Nets are bringing the level of offensive lava that\u2019s rare and enviable and in some ways historic. With the exception of the LeBron James-Dwyane Wade-Chris Bosh Heat, and the Stephen Curry-Klay Thompson-Kevin Durant Warriors, has any team in the last decade or so featured the scoring brilliance of the Durant-Kyrie Irving-James Harden Nets? This three-headed hoops monster is a one-on-one terror, with three of the best isolationists in the game, all in their prime, all healthy. The Nets present a matchup nightmare for the poor souls on the opposite benches, and that\u2019s why, based on that muscle alone, they\u2019re gearing up for what could become an NBA takeover. They can score 130, 135, even 140 points most nights. Problem is, on some of those very same nights, they can lose the game. Do the math, and it\u2019ll explain how the Nets, who squander the most points by far (allowing 117.8 opponent ppg) of any contender, are contesting and sweating out games that have no business being close. They\u2019ve given up 129 and 125 to Oklahoma City, 123 and 149 in two losses (!) to Washington, 135 to Cleveland and 128 to Atlanta. The common thread is none of those teams, from a talent standpoint, are anywhere near Brooklyn\u2019s level. And that indicates the Nets\u2019 defensive concentration and intensity against lesser teams is criminally low and inconsistent. What\u2019s a team to do \u2014 between now and the playoffs \u2014 to fix their biggest if only flaw? The answer lies squarely with the team\u2019s strength. It starts with the Notorious Big Three. Durant, Irving and Harden must also be the Nets\u2019 best defenders, if that\u2019s possible. They must bring that same energy at the other basket, and if that means sacrificing a bit of offense, so be it. That\u2019s because the Nets are in no shape to swing a trade for a top-flight defender \u2014 most of their assets were spent in the Harden trade \u2014 and the chance of grabbing a defensive savior from the upcoming buyout market are slim. They\u2019re locked in with this team and this core. They did bring back Iman Shumpert recently to address some defensive issues. But Shumpert is beyond his prime and almost guaranteed to be on the bench in the fourth quarter of a big or close game. Same goes for center DeAndre Jordan, who was once an elite interior defender. He often has those flashbacks, but is too anemic offensively to get much floor time in the fourth. In fact, since the team traded for Harden on Jan. 13, Jordan ranks last in fourth-quarter minutes (3.2 mpg). Jeff Green and Joe Harris often round out the Big Three late in games. Because of their obvious status and presence, Irving, Durant and Harden will command those tense, late-game minutes and also be assigned defensively to the other team\u2019s A-listers. Can you picture, for instance, Nash benching Harden, the weakest defender of the three, for Shumpert in the fourth quarter for defensive purposes? That\u2019s not going to happen. Same goes for Irving, as his playmaking and shot-making are far too important. \u201cOffensively, we\u2019re one of the best teams in this league,\u201d Harden said. \u201cBut can we man up and get stops individually? And then \u2026 can we have each other\u2019s back on a consistent basis?\u201d Harden was encouraged by what the Nets did against the Clippers, and clearly, the three stars have challenged each other to be better defenders. For almost three minutes during a fourth-quarter stretch when the Nets staged a comeback, they held the Clippers scoreless. \u201cWe took it upon ourselves as individuals to get stops,\u201d Harden said. \u201cAnd once we get that down pat \u2026 that\u2019s what it has to be for us to be playing at the end.\u201d Shots were contested, energy was spent, and the Nets discovered what they\u2019re capable of doing if attention to defense was paid. It was a small sample size that must swell into something larger and more commonplace in the coming weeks. \u201cWe have the desire to go out there and do it,\u201d Irving said. That said, there are nights when the Nets won\u2019t require constant defensive stops. Remember, they\u2019re bringing a pair of all-time scorers in Harden and Durant, and Irving can break free on any given moment, as he did against the Clippers with 39 points . As Nash said: \u201cWe can be a solid defensive team at minimum \u2026 but they have to guard us as well.\u201d Yes, sometimes, a great offense can minimize the need for great defense. If Durant, Harden and Irving are combining for 80-85 points, good luck to the other team keeping up with that. But this regular season is just prep for the playoffs for teams such as the Nets, who essentially have a bye. Therefore, this is the time to hide the flaws as much as possible, or at least minimize them. The Nets will never achieve historical greatness defensively \u2014 it\u2019s not in their DNA. They didn\u2019t group Durant, Irving and Harden together to win games 85-80. The purpose is to run up the score to the point where opponents are collapsing trying to keep up. Every now and then, though, the Nets must make stops. And this will magnify in the playoffs when the court shrinks, the score tightens and maybe the points don\u2019t come as easily for Brooklyn. What then? Offense will certainly get them a high seed, and maybe the best record, in the East. Defense will determine what happens from there. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here  and follow him on Twitter .

It didn\u2019t take James long to make history, hitting three field goals in the first quarter. He officially passed Chamberlain on a driving layup in the first quarter en route to a 27-point, 10-rebound, 10-assist night in the Lakers\u2019 114-93 win. Not only did he pass Chamberlain but he also recorded his 96th career triple-double. Below is a look at where LeBron stood in field goals made entering the game vs. Denver. LeBron had already passed Wilt in on the all-time scoring list back in November 2018 thanks to three important factors: LeBron has scored an additional 3,377 points due to 3-pointers and free throws. But on Thursday, LeBron will have officially hit more baskets than Wilt and trail only Karl Malone and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar on both the field goals made list and the all-time scoring list. When it comes to comparing Wilt and LeBron, what stands out most is the meteoric rise of Chamberlain, which included a seven-year peak unmatched in league history, and the steady consistency and longevity of LeBron. Both players peaked in field goals made in their third NBA season. Wilt made an NBA record 1,597 baskets that season (an astounding 20 FGM per game average), while LeBron made 875 field goals (a career-best average of 11.1 per game). Wilt has the top four individual seasons in terms of field goals made, and seven of the NBA\u2019s 18 total seasons when a player made at least 1,000 baskets. Players With At Least 1,000 FGM in a Single Season While LeBron came nowhere close to matching Wilt\u2019s volume of buckets early in their respective careers, there has been little variance in LeBron\u2019s output season over season. Only in his rookie season did LeBron not average at least 9.0 field goals per game \u2014 a mark he is currently at in his 18 th season. Take a look at that chart again. Wilt\u2019s top seven seasons in field goals made came in his first seven seasons in the league \u2014 peaking in season three. LeBron also peaked in season three, but his third-highest average of field goals made came in season 15 \u2014 a season Wilt never reached as he retired after 14 seasons. That is the third key to LeBron\u2019s ability to pass Chamberlain in both scoring and field goals made \u2014 longevity. Just like how Wilt put up numbers that the league had never seen before (and have not seen since) during his first seven NBA seasons, LeBron is putting up numbers that the league has never seen so late in a player\u2019s career. Wilt averaged fewer than 8.0 FGM in three of his final five seasons as his career followed a more traditional trajectory that sees a player steadily decline after reaching their peak during the first half of their career. Meanwhile, LeBron continues to play at an elite level nearly two decades into his career \u2014 he is averaging at least 25 points per game for the 17 th consecutive season. While there are clear differences in the paths to the top four in field goals made for Wilt and LeBron, the two players also have some key things in common. In addition to being outstanding scorers, both have proven themselves as playmakers \u2014 each winning an assist title late in their careers (LeBron last season; Chamberlain in 1967-68). Of the top 20 players all-time in field goals made, LeBron and Wilt are the only two to have won an assist title. They are also two of just six players in NBA history to have won both a scoring title and an assist title. LeBron James Wilt Chamberlain James Harden Russell Westbrook Tiny Archibald Jerry West LeBron\u2019s milestone field goals made on climb to No. 3 all-time On Thursday, LeBron should reach at least 12,682 career field goals made and set his sights on Malone (who holds second place at 13,528) and eventually Abdul-Jabbar (the all-time leader at 15,837). With a career average of 9.85 FGM per game, it would take approximately 86 games to pass Malone and 321 games to pass Kareem. Based on his current play, LeBron should challenge Malone\u2019s mark at some point in 2021-22, but LeBron will have to defy Father Time for about four more seasons to have a shot of catching Kareem. But before we look ahead to the next milestone, let\u2019s look back at LeBron\u2019s run to the No. 3 spot on the all-time list. 2,500 \u2013 Dec. 16, 2006 : LeBron reached the 2,500 career field goals mark in his 261 st career game \u2014 an 81-74 Cavaliers loss to the Magic that saw LeBron score a game-high 29 points on 10-for-19 shooting. 5,000 \u2013 Jan. 3, 2010 : LeBron scored 29 points on 13-for-21 shooting to surpass 5,000 career field goals, but the Cavs were upset by the Charlotte Bobcats 91-88 in his 508 th career game. 7,500 \u2013 March 27, 2013 : LeBron\u2019s 7,500 th basket came at the end of the second-longest win streak in NBA history as Miami\u2019s run of 27 straight wins was snapped in a 101-97 loss to the Bulls in LeBron\u2019s 760 th career game. 10,000 \u2013 Jan. 8, 2017 : LeBron became the 14 th player in NBA history to reach 10,000 career field goals as he finished with 28 points on 11-for-17 shooting in Cleveland\u2019s 120-116 win against Phoenix in LeBron\u2019s 1,020 career game. 12,500 \u2013 Dec. 27, 2020 : In his third game of his third season with the Los Angeles Lakers, LeBron reached 12,500 career field goals to inch closer to Chamberlain for third on the all-time list. In is 1,268 th career game, LeBron scored 18 points on 6-for-13 shooting in 26 minutes of the Lakers\u2019 blowout win against Minnesota."},{"id":488075,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/10-takeaways-from-warriors-thursday-rout-of-the-mavericks","date":"2021-02-05","title":"10 takeaways from Warriors' rout of the Mavericks","content":"The Mavericks had no centers available Thursday for the Warriors. As you might expect, the game quickly became a rout: There was no need to play Steph Curry or Draymond Green in the fourth. Because Golden State rolled, 147-116 . Health and injury issues limited the tallest starter for the Warriors to 6-foot-7. Figuratively, though, the tallest was Kelly Oubre, who had perhaps his best game as a pro (a career-high 40 points) and proceeded to keep the Mavericks toiling in what\u2019s shaping up, so far, as a miserable season for Dallas. Here are 10 takeaways \u2026 Kelly Oubre finds 40 Kelly Oubre\u2019s career night boosted the Warriors output. Remember early in the season when Oubre missed 28 of his first 30 shots from deep? It wasn\u2019t exactly a great initial impression for the swingman, who arrived from the Phoenix Suns with hopes of minimizing the loss of Klay Thompson. Well, he just had quite the moment, with a 40-piece and an unconscious display from deep, shooting 7-for-10. Let\u2019s be frank: One game, as solid as it was, doesn\u2019t make a season, and Oubre still has a hill to climb \u2014 he was averaging just 12 points and shooting 38% prior to Dallas. He probably won\u2019t hit 40 again and might struggle for 30. Still, the Warriors will need a smattering of impact games from Oubre to rattle the cage in the West. Kristaps Porzingis, flinging \u2019em from 3 He stands 7-foot-4. On this day, roughly 7 inches taller than the tallest defender on the floor, and \u2026 his first five shots were 3-pointers. Half of his total shots were 3s. Go figure. It was a weird strategy by Porzingis and Mavs coach Rick Carlisle, especially given the Warriors were shorthanded. This was simply taking analytics a bit too far. Or maybe Porzingis just doesn\u2019t have any post-up DNA in his body. For those who cringe at the sight of someone this tall spending so much time far away from the basket \u2014 essentially, you forfeit all that height when you do \u2014 this made you want to turn off the TV. Draymond Green, filling stat sheets He\u2019s having a sub-par season, no matter how many folks want to scream \u201cBut he does things that don\u2019t end up in the box score!\u201d Well, maybe Green should do more of what does end up in the box score, especially for a team that needs production. Much like Oubre, Green had a night that he needed to have. His passing was on point, finding teammates cutting to the hoop or over by the corner for 3-pointers. Draymond Green\u2019s 15 assists helped catalyze the Warriors\u2019 offense. This was Green of four seasons ago, when the offense ran through him, he made sharp decisions and added some defensive stops. Green entered averaging 4.6 points, 5.0 rebounds and 6.6 assists. He managed 15 assists (and 11 points) against only one turnover Thursday \u2026 in just three quarters. The missing Mavericks\u2019 offense Last year, the Mavericks set an NBA record for offensive efficiency, plenty more positive than what they\u2019re managing this season. If you\u2019re looking for reasons why the Mavericks record ranks among the more disappointing developments of 2020-21, you can arrive at their last-in-the-NBA 3-point percentage. They began the game shooting 18-for-36. Then they only made two of their next 14. That\u2019s why, by early in the fourth quarter, the game was a rout. All-Stars, apparently Stephen Curry and Luka Doncic met, a matchup of what appears to be the starting backcourt for the West in the All-Star Game based on the first All-Star voting returns . It\u2019s easy to see why: both are having solid seasons and rate highly among fan approval. Those who watch Damian Lillard closely might disagree, but not too strongly. Once Curry returned healthy this season, someone was going to suffer in terms of All-Stardom, and it looks like Lillard\u2019s fate is in the hands of the coaches. Mavs backpedal from expectations If you\u2019re keeping score at home in Dallas, that\u2019s seven losses in the last eight games. And, yes, it\u2019s all so confusing for a team that played well in the Orlando bubble last fall and came into this season with solid expectations. Doncic is having a good season \u2014 only his 3-point percentage has left much to be desired \u2014 but nobody else is playing at or above their respective level. Josh Richardson (six points vs. Warriors), for one, hasn\u2019t been the help that Dallas expected after he arrived from Philly. And the 9-14 Mavericks are next-to-last in the NBA in rebounding. The only team worse than Dallas from this time last year is Miami. Luka\u2019s body language is getting worst by the day \u2014 and night. And he didn\u2019t meet the media afterward. Hardaway Jr. decision looming The Mavericks obviously need a third wheel \u2014 assuming Porzingis is actually a No. 2 \u2014 yet there\u2019s no one on the current roster who fills that role. This isn\u2019t a slight to Hardaway, who\u2019s a valued member of the rotation, mainly for his distance shooting. Still, Hardaway\u2019s contract is up after this season and it\u2019s easy to conclude the Mavericks will use that money elsewhere. There will be pressure to stockpile better talent if only to keep Doncic from pouting \u2014 or entertaining any thoughts of delaying his signature on a contract extension. Wiseman ceding ground in rookie race The TNT audience was deprived of getting another glimpse of James Wiseman, the intriguing young big man who\u2019s off to a pretty decent start, but sat with a sprained left wrist. And while it\u2019s too early to make a firm judgment on the race, where does Wiseman stand so far regarding the Kia Rookie of the Year award? Probably right where he was drafted: Second. Now that he\u2019s starting for the Hornets and his minutes are rising, LaMelo Ball is getting more chances to throw no-look passes and inflate his stats. If this continues, there won\u2019t be much suspense about the award, with all due respect to Wiseman. Carlisle\u2019s cushion collapsing? If the Mavericks crash and burn this season, could any of this fall on Carlisle? He\u2019s one of the better coaches in the NBA, and has a championship \u2026 but as we\u2019ve seen constantly, anything can happen in pro sports. Mavs owner Mark Cuban seems to be patient and obviously respects Carlisle. The next few months, and Luka\u2019s mood, will dictate where this is going. Boban. Blocked. As if he didn\u2019t do enough damage to the Mavericks with his shooting, Oubre stayed in the game long enough to play with the garbage-time crew, among them Boban Marjanovich, the lovable Mavs reserve center. That provided Oubre the opportunity to deliver a block that awakened social media, swatting Boban right near the rim, obviously was a trophy block for someone who gives away 10 inches in height. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

Team LeBron, meet Team KD. All Kevin Durant had to do to see his name atop the All-Star vote totals was switch from the Western Conference to the Eastern (most importantly to get out of LeBron James\u2019 neck of the woods). Then he had to come back from a scary, potentially career-ending Achilles tendon injury that wiped out his 2019-20 season. Next Durant had to play so well for his new team, the Brooklyn Nets, that he isn\u2019t merely an easy choice as an All-Star but he\u2019s a serious early candidate for Kia NBA MVP, even with the big-name help (James Harden, Kyrie Irving) on board in Brooklyn. Oh, and then he had to take a snapshot of Thursday\u2019s tallies. Because with two weeks remaining and millions of votes still to be cast, this king-of-the-hill stuff is extremely fluid. Durant ranked first overall with 2,302,705 votes to James\u2019 2,288,676. That put the two Frontcourt candidates atop the East and West totals, respectively (please, no nit-picking about LeBron\u2019s playmaking, ballhandling role with the Lakers). Here\u2019s why the above matters, in this particular world: If Durant somehow were to maintain his No. 1 status overall, he would unseat James, who has been the overall vote leader for five consecutive seasons and seven years overall dating back to 2007. Durant has been an All-Star 10 times, but he never has garnered the most votes. In the backcourt, Golden State\u2019s Steph Curry tops all West guards with 2,113,178 and Dallas\u2019 Luka Doncic was next with 1,395,719. The top East guard, Bradley Beal of the Wizards, slotted in next with 1,273,817 votes. Things will change, certainly, and players will move up or down in the Top 10 finishers as ballots are counted. But \u2013 if there is indeed an All-Star Game next month and the recent format continues \u2013 we may see Team LeBron picking second to Team KD or Kevin or whatever. 2. Beal better be a starter. That\u2019s not an ultimatum to any fan, player or media member filling out a ballot between now and the cutoff date. It\u2019s a sense of the reality that intrudes when the seven reserve spots on each All-Star roster is fleshed out by the conference coaches. Coaches traditionally put more weight on the W-L record of a player\u2019s team, with many using .500 as the lowest acceptable winning percentage. Makes sense, from their point of view \u2013 they labor all season to remind their guys that winning matters most and that the best rewards are the team rewards. Whereas All-Star recognition is almost entirely an individual accolade (never mind how sincere the \u201cmy team made this possible\u201d rhetoric sounds at times). So considering Washington\u2019s 5-13 record as of Thursday morning, it\u2019s quite possible that Beal \u2013 in spite of his remarkable league-leading and career-best 34.8 ppg average \u2013 could be snubbed again. Last year, the Wizards guard averaged 29.1 points before the break but Washington was 16-31 when the All-Star reserves were announced, and he wasn\u2019t invited to Chicago as a member of the East team. Curiously, in the two seasons Beal did get selected, Washington was 26-21 when the 14 backups were announced in 2018 but 22-29 when he made it anyway in 2019. 3. No tears yet, but tiers, yes. It\u2019s hard to know how vote totals will swing from week to week to final results, simply because game attendance is limited or non-existent this season. Historically, and especially in the paper ballot days, the teams who played at home the most in a given week could expect to see bumps for their All-Star candidates. Going electronic, spreading the balloting among fans, players and media members and, finally, soliciting voting during the pandemic shutdown makes such bumps unpredictable. What we did see, though, in the first week\u2019s returns is some stratification. Frankly, in the Frontcourt returns, Durant and James are prohibitive favorites to lock up starting spots. Milwaukee\u2019s Giannis Antetokounmpo (1,752,185) and Philadelphia\u2019s Joel Embiid (1,584,028) have sizable early leads as a two-man second tier in the East. Boston\u2019s Jayson Tatum is alone on tier three, with 48% fewer votes (822,151) than Embiid. Yet Tatum also had 150% more votes than No. 5 man Jimmy Butler of the Heat. Among the East\u2019s guards, Beal and Brooklyn\u2019s Kyrie Irving (1,093,611) and James Harden (1,014,763) are a solid first tier. Then it\u2019s Boston\u2019s Jaylen Brown (590,195), Chicago\u2019s Zach LaVine (486,547) and Atlanta\u2019s Trae Young (368,126) on the next level. James is unchallenged among West Frontcourt players, with three rivals running close for the other two starting spots: Denver\u2019s Nikola Jokic (1,477,975), the Clippers\u2019 Kawhi Leonard (1,285,777) and the Lakers\u2019 Anthony Davis (1,192,881). The step down to tier three is a big one, with Clippers wing Paul George (549,280) and New Orleans\u2019 Zion Williamson (411,668) well ahead of any other challengers. There are essentially three players chasing two starting backcourt spots out West. Doncic has two-thirds as many votes as Curry, and Portland\u2019s Damian Lillard (998,853) has 72% of Doncic\u2019s total. But No. 4 Ja Morant is way back at 257,743, joined on a third tier of candidates by Utah\u2019s Donovan Mitchell (236,850) and in a stretch Phoenix\u2019s Devin Booker (173,755). Booker\u2019s teammate Chris Paul was in seventh place at 128,127. Tiers are an artificial construct but there\u2019s a high probability 20 or 21 of the final All-Stars will come from the first three tiers in each conference. 4. Fan favorites still move the needle. In 1992, it didn\u2019t matter to voters that Lakers legend Magic Johnson had retired abruptly in November 1991 upon learning he carried the HIV virus. They kept punching ballots for him anyway, earning Johnson a starting spot for the West. Seizing on the moment, the NBA allowed him to play in the 42nd All-Star Game in Orlando, never mind that Johnson didn\u2019t play another game that season. He wound up scoring 25 points, making the game\u2019s last shot in a West blowout of the East and earning MVP honors. Well, nobody is anticipating anything near the drama of that this year. But it\u2019s worth noting \u2013 at least through the first returns \u2013 that Golden State\u2019s Klay Thompson got nearly 100,000 votes to start in the Western Conference backcourt. The Warriors\u2019 sharpshooter is expected to be out all season following surgery in November to repair his right Achilles tendon. Thompson isn\u2019t the only star feeling the embrace of fan loyalty \u2013 or at least widespread name recognition. Detroit\u2019s Derrick Rose (183,899) ranked eighth among East guards despite modest stats (14.2 ppg, 4.2 apg) coming off the bench for a last-place team. Portland\u2019s Carmelo Anthony (179,310) is a shell of his 10-time All-Star self but lots of folks want to see his 11th selection, in spite of career worst scoring (12.1 ppg) and shooting (37.2 field goal percentage). They call this the fans\u2019 game, right? Who are any of us to quibble with the favorites so many folks want selected. 5. Teammates can siphon votes. Taking the first returns as a snapshot, there would be no team among the NBA\u2019s 30 with more than one All-Star starter. That might change, and certainly there\u2019s no rule against that. It especially doesn\u2019t hold in an era when Super Teams sometimes roam the Earth. James and Davis started for the West last year. Curry and Durant did it from 2017-2019, James and Irving in 2017, Durant and Russell Westbrook in 2016, and Curry and Thompson in 2015. In 2013, James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh were 60% of the East\u2019s All-Star starting lineup. But most of those guys have been All-NBA players, perhaps even future Hall of Famers. When divvying up a half season\u2019s worth of credit on an All-Star ballot, names do slip through the cracks. Among those missing from the Top 10 in the first fan returns: Milwaukee\u2019s Khris Middleton, Utah\u2019s Rudy Gobert and Indiana\u2019s Malcolm Brogdon, far behind teammates Antetokounmpo, Mitchell and Domantas Sabonis. Sixers guard Ben Simmons (117,993) eked into 10th place among East guards but had less than 8% of his buddy Embiid\u2019s vote total. A couple of players worthy of more consideration than their vote totals so far: Orlando big man Nikola Vucevic and Sacramento\u2019s De\u2019Aaron Fox. Meanwhile, the Toronto Raptors had no one in the Top 10 just 20 months removed from their 2019 championship. Fred Van Vleet\u2019s 54-point outburst against the Magic Tuesday might get his name clicked a few more times by next week\u2019s returns. Fan balloting accounts for 50% of the vote in selecting All-Star starters. Current players and a media panel account for 25% each. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Nuggets (12-8) at Lakers (16-6), 10 p.m. ET, TNT \u2022 This is a meeting of the 4th-ranked offense (115.8 offensive rating, 55.6 eFG% ) taking on the league\u2019s top ranked defense (104.8 defensive rating, 51.3 eFG% allowed). \u2022 LeBron James needs three made baskets to pass Wilt Chamberlain for 3rd place in career field goals made. The last time LeBron finished a game with fewer than three field goals made was on Halloween 2007. \u2022 The Lakers rank 3rd in the league in second-chance points (14.8 per game) and tied for 6th for points in the paint (49.3 per game). However, the Nuggets only give up a league-low 10.2 second-chance points in addition to 44.8 ppg in the lane (T-8th in the NBA for fewest allowed). \u2022 The Lakers offense has been 15.2 points per 100 possession better with Kentavious Caldewell-Pope on the court (120.4 offensive rating in 433 minutes) than when he\u2019s off the court (105.2 offensive rating in 623 minutes). Caldwell-Pope has the 7th-highest on\/off court differential of any player that has logged at least 200 minutes \u2013 trailing only Damian Lillard (19.0), Kawhi Leonard (18.9), Luguentz Dort (17.0), Joel Embiid (16.7), Nikola Jokic (16.5) and Trae Young (16.0). \u2022 The Nuggets enter Thursday ranked 5th in 3-point percentage (38.4%) and 12th in 3-pointers made per game (13.2). They will face a Lakers team that allows the 3rd-lowest 3-point percentage in the league (34.0%), which is 2.4 percentage points lower than their opponents\u2019 normal average."},{"id":487742,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/raptors-sign-gm-bobby-webster-to-extension","date":"2021-02-04","title":"Raptors sign GM Bobby Webster to extension","content":"The Toronto Raptors announced Thursday they have signed general manager Bobby Webster to a multi-year contract extension.

Before the next rankings drop on Monday, here are some of the storylines he\u2019s keeping an eye on this weekend. Stephen Curry became a star with his ability to shoot off the dribble. This season, he\u2019s one of nine players who have shot better than 40% on at least 50 pull-up 3-point attempts. But over his first 10 seasons in the league, Curry saw a steady climb in the percentage of his 3-pointers that were assisted, from just 33% as a rookie to 60% two seasons ago. That rate has dipped down to less than 56% this season, but Curry off the ball remains more entertaining than the threat of him pulling up as he crosses the midcourt line. (This season, Curry ranks second with 11 3-pointers from 30 or more feet, behind Damian Lillard\u2019s 14). Curry has been assisted on 58 of his 3-pointers this season, with 20 of the assists coming from Draymond Green. In their ninth season together, Curry and Green probably read each other better than any two teammates in the league. And what makes the Warriors most fun to watch is the improvisation between the Warriors\u2019 two healthy cornerstones, whether it results in open 3-pointers or layups. Here are a few examples: 1. With Mikal Bridges top-locking Curry, he flares to the left wing, using Bridges\u2019 own teammate as a screen \u2026 2. A common set for the Warriors is for a player to enter the ball into the post and then set a cross-screen for Curry to curl to an open 3-pointer. Here, Ricky Rubio knows what\u2019s coming and is top-locking Curry after Green enters the ball to Eric Paschall. Curry reads the defense and cuts through the middle, taking both Rubio and Jarred Vanderbilt with him. Green is WIDE open at the top of the key, but he calls for Paschall to screen Curry as he curls around to a right-wing 3-pointer \u2026 3. Curry draws a crowd in the corner, so he kicks the ball, Kelly Oubre gets out of the way, and Curry sets a ball screen for Green. Edmond Sumner doesn\u2019t want to leave Curry (shooters make the best screeners) and Myles Turner gets hit by the screen, allowing Green to drive, draw help, and toss a lob to James Wiseman \u2026 Through Wednesday, there are 14 teams with winning records, five in the East and nine in the West. There have been 67 games played between those 14 teams, and here are their records in those 67 games. Games played between teams currently over .500 With their win against the LA Clippers on Tuesday, the Brooklyn Nets are 7-2 against the other 13 teams that currently have winning records. And with their stunning loss in Washington two nights earlier, the Nets are 7-7 against teams that currently have losing records. (They\u2019ve yet to play the 10-10 Rockets.) But that 7-2 record against the good teams? Those two losses were both to the Memphis Grizzlies , who lost Ja Morant in the first half of the first meeting and didn\u2019t have him at all in the second meeting. So the discrepancy is worse than it looks on the surface. The Nets have scored a very efficient 116.2 points per 100 possessions in their nine games against teams currently over .500. Still, the bigger difference, by far, between \u201cgood Nets vs. good teams\u201d and \u201cbad Nets vs. bad teams\u201d has been on defense, where they\u2019ve allowed 12.2 fewer points per 100 possessions in the nine games against the teams that currently have winning records (105.5) than they have in their other 14 games (117.7). Nets efficiency, by strength of opponent OffRtg = Points scored per 100 possessions DefRtg = Points allowed per 100 possessions NetRtg = Point differential per 100 possessions But there\u2019s a big difference between the Nets\u2019 early games against other good teams and what they\u2019ve done more recently. In their first four wins within the group (Week 1 wins against Golden State and Boston , Week 3 wins against Utah and Philly ), they allowed 94.5 points per 100 possessions and won by an average of 25 points. Over their last three ( vs. Denver, Milwaukee and the Clippers ), they\u2019ve allowed 119.3 per 100 and won by an average of four points. So it\u2019s not like they\u2019ve been locking these good teams down of late. They\u2019ve just been focused enough on that end of the floor and remain ridiculously good offensively. The Nets and their opponents have each scored more efficiently than the league average (about 110 points per 100 possessions) in 12 of their last 13 games . The Nets are currently enjoying just their second two-day break since that first week of the season, but they have a couple of back-to-backs in the next six days. On Friday ( 7:30 p.m. ET, ESPN ), they\u2019ll host the 9-12 Raptors at Barclays Center. And on Saturday ( 8 p.m. ET, League Pass ), they\u2019re in Philadelphia, where the Sixers are 10-0 with Joel Embiid . Here are your biggest jumps in effective field goal percentage among 184 players with at least 250 field goal attempts last season and at least 100 this season, starting with one guy who left the Milwaukee Bucks and one guy who joined them. Biggest jump in effective field goal percentage from last season Minimum 250 FGA in 2019-20, 100 FGA in 2020-21 eFG% = (FGM + (0.5 * 3PM)) \/ FGA At the bottom of the list are JaVale McGee (-18.7%), JJ Redick (-14.2%), Brandon Clarke (-12.9%), Davis Bertans (-12.3%) and Aron Baynes (-11.1%). When Becky Hammon made history by taking over for an ejected Gregg Popovich back in December, she drew up an \u201cElevator Doors\u201d play out of a timeout \u2026 Lonnie Walker IV first curls around screens from Keldon Johnson and Jakob Poeltl, who then form the elevator doors on the left wing. From the paint, Walker runs through the elevator doors, which close on defender Kentavious Caldwell-Pope. The issue is that the two screens are set just inside the 3-point line, so when Walker catches Dejounte Murray\u2019s pass on the other side, he\u2019s not quite in shooting range. A couple of weeks later, the Spurs ran another Elevator Doors play for Patty Mills. This one looked more like the play the Warriors ran a lot for Stephen Curry when they were coached by Mark Jackson. Mills gives the ball up, does a \u201cUCLA\u201d cut toward the left block and then sets a cross-screen for what looks to be a Rudy Gay post-up. But that\u2019s just setting up Mills\u2019 dash through the elevator doors toward the top of the arc. These screens (Johnson and Poeltl again) are set lower, but Devin Vassell is late with his pass to Mills and Kenyon Martin Jr. (who was originally guarding Gay and switched the cross-screen) runs through the doors like he\u2019s the Kool-Aid Man. The Spurs are not the only team to have run \u201cElevator Doors\u201d this season. The Hornets ran it off a baseline out-of-bounds play a couple of weeks ago, and it bore fruit \u2026 Hayward simply inbounds the ball to Terry Rozier (curling to the corner off a Cody Zeller screen) and darts through the elevator doors, which flatten Patrick Williams as he tries to chase through. Note that both screens (Zeller and Miles Bridges) were set inside the paint, giving Hayward plenty of space to shoot with his feet just beyond the 3-point line. \u201cElevator Doors\u201d can be a really fun play. But it can also be difficult to execute. In a pre-bubble breakdown of the Boston Celtics\u2019 off-the-dribble offense last June, one highlighted element was the roll-and-seal (aka \u201cGortat\u201d) screen from Daniel Theis, where the Celtics\u2019 center would screen his own defender as a teammate was driving to the basket\u2026 NBA officials also took note of these screens, realizing that they weren\u2019t always legal. And when the Celtics hosted the Nets on Christmas, it became apparent that the refs were viewing roll-and-seal screens a little differently this season. Late in the first quarter, Tristan Thompson was called for an offensive foul when he rolled into the paint and set a second (moving) screen on Jarrett Allen as Jayson Tatum drove to the rim \u2026 Midway through the second quarter, Theis was called for an offensive foul on a very similar play \u2026 NBA.com recently reached out to Monty McCutchen, the league\u2019s head of referee development and training, and he confirmed that his group did indeed address these screens in the offseason. \u201cWe have a rule book and it states very clearly what is legal and illegal when it comes to screens,\u201d McCutchen said. \u201cWhat happens, though, is that the game evolves.\u201d He compared these roll-and-seal screens to step-back jumpers. The rule book states that \u201ca player who gathers the ball while dribbling may take two steps in coming to a stop, passing, or shooting the ball.\u201d For a long time, those two steps were always in a forward direction. But when players started taking step-back jumpers, officials had to realize that the rule doesn\u2019t say anything about in what direction those two steps were taken. Two steps backward or to the side are no different than two steps forward. The refs needed to confirm what they were seeing, while it looked strange, was legal. A similar mental adjustment was needed with these roll-and-seal screens. \u201cOur visual syntax gets to where we expect a screen to be set,\u201d McCutchen said. \u201cThe rule book is much more antiseptic, much more clear, much more stark. And when we, as a group, recognize that the game is evolving to now, on the roll, we have people that are setting a screen or sealing.\u201d It\u2019s a different kind of screen, but it should be judged the same as any other on or off-ball screen. While it may be disguised as a roll to the rim, it\u2019s still a screen that needs to be set legally. \u201cWith screens, you must give someone the time, if they can\u2019t see it coming, to stop or change direction,\u201d McCutchen said. \u201cIf I\u2019m coming up and setting a screen on the side, and that [defender] can see me and it\u2019s a stationary player, then I can go right up to before contact, because the player can see me. \u201cBut if we\u2019re both moving, the screener has to stop in time for the defender to stop or change direction. That\u2019s how the rule is written. It doesn\u2019t say where on the floor those conditions have to come to pass.\u201d To be clear, screening your own man in the paint as your teammate drives can be a legal screen. On Monday, Grizzlies rookie Xavier Tillman used such a screen to keep Jakob Poeltl from contesting Morant at the rim \u2026 But the roll-and-screen guy may not be able to get away with as much as he has in the past, because officials have adjusted to how the game has evolved. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

Expect the veteran guard to take on a heavier offensive load while going toe-to-toe with another one of our value plays, Ja Morant Ja Morant (PG \u2013 MEM) : $7,400 vs. HOU  He\u2019s coming off a dud, but what better way to bounce back than by facing a Houston team that has been generous to opposing point guards? Morant has nightly double-double upside and can get hot from the field in an instant. This price tag is beautiful for a superstar looking to get right in a fantastic matchup. John Collins (PF \u2013 ATL) : $6,900 vs. UTA  Collins has taken a step back in his production this season in Atlanta\u2019s crowded rotation, but make no mistake about it \u2014 the talent and upside are there. Across his last six games, Collins has posted at least 41 FD points three times. Clint Capela will have his hands full with Rudy Gobert, which should leave Collins with some more room to operate and some additional offensive opportunities. I love the sub-$7K price tag on tonight\u2019s slate. Gary Trent (SG \u2013 POR) : $6,300 at PHI  Trent has cemented himself as Portland\u2019s second option on offense behind Lillard (abdomen), and the latter is a GTD tonight. Even if he goes, Lillard is likely to be less than 100%, making Trent a highly-attractive option in what is projected to be the highest-scoring matchup of the night. Eric Gordon (PG \u2013 HOU) : $5,400 at MEM Gordon gets PG eligibility tonight, and with Victor Oladipo likely sitting, it should be Gordon and Wall manning the backcourt for Houston in a friendly matchup with Memphis. Gordon can get hot quickly, especially if his 3-point shot is falling, so he makes a fine tournament target. Kelly Oubre Jr. (SF \u2013 GSW) : $5,300 at DAL  Oubre gets a great matchup with Dallas tonight, and while his production has been up and down this season, he\u2019s got 40-point upside. At just $5.3K, I\u2019ll certainly grab some shares in tournaments. Juan Toscano-Anderson (SF \u2013 GSW) : $4,900 at DAL  Toscano-Anderson scored 25.9 FD points across 26 minutes of action Tuesday with both James Wiseman and Kevon Looney out of action. With both of those players out tonight, we should see more minutes from Toscano-Anderson and Eric Paschall, and both make great salary-saving options with sub-$5K price tags. Kevin Huerter (SG \u2013 ATL) : $4,500 vs. UTA  With De\u2019Andre Hunter out of action, it\u2019s been Huerter \u2014 not Cam Reddish \u2014 who has seen the biggest bump in playing time and production. He\u2019s logged at least 38 minutes in back-to-back contests since Hunter left the lineup, and Huerter went off for 46.1 FD points in his last outing. Atlanta\u2019s matchup with Utah isn\u2019t the most friendly, but Huerter\u2019s price tag is far too low to ignore. Eric Paschall (C \u2013 GSW) : $4,500 at DAL  As mentioned above with Toscano-Anderson, Paschall should find himself looking at more minutes with the Warriors\u2019 frontcourt hit hard with injuries. The second-year man has proven quite valuable off the bench already, but a bump in minutes should only make him that much more appealing. What\u2019s even better is his eligibility at center, giving you plenty of flexibility elsewhere if you want to pay down at the position. Anfernee Simons (PG \u2013 POR) : $4,400 at PHI  Simons got banged up Tuesday and failed to provide any fantasy value, but we\u2019re going back to the well with him tonight. Portland\u2019s matchup with Philly has the highest over\/under on the slate, and with Damian Lillard (abdomen) a GTD, we should see more of Simons tonight."},{"id":487619,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/bradley-beal-joins-elite-company-with-17th-straight-game-of-25-points","date":"2021-02-04","title":"Bradley Beal joins elite company with 17th straight game of 25+ points","content":"The Washington Wizards are showing some resiliency of late. They rallied to defeat the Miami Heat 103-100 on Wednesday, and did so thanks to the play of All-Star Bradley Beal, who scored 32 points in the win. The victory \u2014 the Wizards\u2019 second in their last three games \u2014 was sweet for the Wizards in one sense and historic in another because of Beal. In scoring those 32 points, Beal has scored at least 25 points in 17 straight games to open 2020-21, which is the most to start a season since 1976-77. In fact, Beal\u2019s run of games with 25 or more points broke the previous mark to open a season held by Hall of Famer Michael Jordan in 1988-89. Beal needs six more such games to move into fourth place on the list and unseat Los Angeles Lakers legend and Hall of Famer Elgin Baylor. However, he has a long way to go for the all-time mark. Hall of Fame center Wilt Chamberlain holds the top spot with an astounding 80 consecutive games of 25 or more points back in the 1961-62 season. It was in that season Chamberlain averaged 50.4 ppg and 25.7 rpg and had his iconic 100-point game . Via Elias Sports, here\u2019s a look at the most consecutive games with 25 points or more to begin a season in NBA history: Aside from his unique place in NBA history, Beal\u2019s 15th point on Wednesday gave him 12,000 for his Washington career. He became the second player to score that many for the franchise, joining only Elvin Hayes (15,551). Beal is also the 21st player in NBA history with 40 consecutive games of at least 20 points.

Domantas Sabonis led the Pacers with 32 points, 13 rebounds and five assists. Only four players have hit those marks in a game this season: Luka Doncic (three times), Nikola Jokic (two) and Sabonis\u2019 opponent on Wednesday, Giannis Antetokounmpo. \u2022 The Pacers lead the NBA in points in the paint (54.9 ppg), but face a Bucks team that ranks second in fewest points in the paint allowed (39.9 ppg). Individually, Giannis Antetokounmpo ranks second in points in the paint (16.1 ppg) and Domantas Sabonis ranks fifth(14.3 ppg). \u2022 Milwaukee\u2019s Jrue Holiday and Indiana\u2019s TJ McConnell both rank in the top six in steals (Holiday is fourth, McConnell sixth) and in the top 11 in deflections (McConnell 10th, Holiday 11th). The Pacers rank fifth in points off turnovers (19.7 ppg) while the Bucks rank 19th (16.5 ppg). \u2022 The Bucks (21.6 per game) and Pacers (20.0 per game) rank fourth and sixth, respectively, in wide-open 3-point attempts per game. The Bucks have taken advantage of these open looks as they shoot 42.4% from 3-point range when the closest defender is at least six feet away (fourth in NBA). The Pacers have shot just 36.2% on these open looks (28th in NBA). \u2022 Indiana is playing its fourth back to back of the season \u2014 the Pacers are 3-0 on the second night of a back-to-back so far this season, winning by an average of 8.3 points.  \u2022 After missing four games with a hamstring strain, Devin Booker made his return on Monday night against Dallas and capped off the night with the fifth game-winning shot of his career (and second against the Mavericks). Here\u2019s the list starting with the most recent: \u2022 During the Suns\u2019 three-game win streak, Chris Paul is averaging 25.3 points , 8.3 assists, 5.0 rebounds and 2.7 steals. He is shooting 54.9% from the field, 50% on 3-pointers and 93.3% from the free throw line. \u2022 Zion Williamson leads the NBA in points in the paint (17.9 ppg). Of his 284 field goal attempts, only 14 have come from outside the paint . Williamson is shooting 62.8% (137\/218) inside the restricted area, 46.2% from the rest of the paint (24\/52), 25% (1\/4) from mid-range and 30% (3-10) from 3-point range. \u2022 The Pelicans average 25.0 free throw attempts per game, which ranks fourth in the league and first in the Western Conference. However, they are shooting a league-low 71.4% on those attempts. Conversely, the Suns average just 18.9 free throw attempts per game (29th in the league), but shoot 83.3% when they do get to the line (second in NBA). \u2022 The Suns are scoring 13.2% of their points on mid-range shots \u2014 the third-highest percentage in the league \u2014 and up from the 10.4% the Suns posted in each of the past two seasons.

Marvin Bagley III (PF \u2013 SAC): $5,900 vs. BOS  The 6-foot-11 Bagley should exploit a relatively small Celtics team tonight. Boston surrenders the eighth-most FanDuel points per game (FDPPG) to power forwards, too, which helps Bagley\u2019s case. He needs just 29.5 points to hit value, and that\u2019s very attainable as long as he can stay out of foul trouble. Jakob Poeltl (C \u2013 SAS): $4,800 vs. MIN  With Aldridge out for the Spurs, Poeltl is in line for expanded minutes tonight. He\u2019s in a fantastic spot for them, too, as the KAT-less Timberwolves give up the most FDPPG to centers. He\u2019s easily the best value at center tonight. Theo Maledon (PG \u2013 OKC): $4,800 vs. HOU  The Thunder won\u2019t have guards George Hill or Shai Gilgeous-Alexander tonight, and that leaves Maledon as the primary ball-handler for Oklahoma City. Maledon exploded for 24 points and 34.1 FD points against the Nets last Friday, and I expect similar production from him against the fast-paced Rockets. Rui Hachimura (WAS) at MIA: $4,700  The Heat give up the ninth-most FDPPG to power forwards (where Hachimura plays 73% of the time) and the seventh-most FDPPG to small forwards. That leaves Hachimura in a strong position for tonight, especially since he\u2019s hit 5x value against this price in six of his 10 appearances. Goran Dragic (SF \u2013 MIA): $5,800 vs. WAS I love Dragic here. He came very close to hitting value against them last time, finishing with 27.9 FD points over just 19 minutes. My main concern with him is that he shot poorly in his first game back, so there is some risk that his struggles from the field continue. Davis Bertans (PF \u2013 WAS): $4,300 at MIA Again, the Heat have been vulnerable to opposing forwards, and I expect plenty of points in what Vegas projects to be a high-scoring battle between these two squads. Bertans\u2019 minutes make him an appealing volume option, as he\u2019s played 30-plus over his last two games. Hamidou Diallo (SG \u2013 OKC): $4,300 vs. HOU  I\u2019ll wrap up with two fliers from the Thunder and Rockets. Diallo posted 26.4 FD points against Houston on Monday, and he played just 15 minutes. He\u2019s sure to get more run with both Hill and SGA sidelined, so look for him to hit 5x value against this surprisingly low price point. Danuel House Jr. (SF \u2013 HOU): $3,900 at OKC  House posted 25.3 FD points in the first matchup between these teams, and he\u2019s played at least 25 minutes over his last two games. At just $3,900, House doesn\u2019t even need to score 20 points to hit 5x value, and he\u2019s a great punt at shooting guard who won\u2019t lose value even in a blowout."},{"id":486935,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/kia-rookie-ladder-feb-3-2021-edition","date":"2021-02-03","title":"Kia Rookie Ladder: Tyrese Haliburton climbs to No. 2; LaMelo Ball takes back top spot","content":"Through the first two editions of the Kia Rookie Ladder , Tyrese Haliburton was underrated, just like he was when he slid to No. 12 in the Draft in November. Oh, his early play was strong enough to get the Sacramento Kings\u2019 combo guard to No. 3 in the rankings, but there he stayed behind Charlotte\u2019s LaMelo Ball and Golden State\u2019s James Wiseman in one order or another. Rookies have little control, except in occasional head-to-head matchups, over the performances of their peers, and Ball and Wiseman made early impacts with the Hornets and Warriors, respectively. But Haliburton\u2019s consistent play and obvious contributions to the Kings\u2019 backcourt in rotation with De\u2019Aaron Fox and Buddy Hield earned him a bump this week to the No. 2 rung. Two big factors played roles in the rookie from Iowa State\u2019s rise. First, Haliburton was crowned the Western Conference\u2019s first Rookie of the Month this season, covering games in December and January. And his recent work translated into winning, with the Kings going 3-1 since last week\u2019s Ladder. Having an impact on winning is kind of the last frontier in assessing rookies. Individual stats are nice, per-36 minute splits can be revealing, but when a team using a rookie regularly in the rotation gets some traction in the standings, well, that\u2019s what the whole Draft concept is about, right? Get the most help to the teams that need the most help. The 6-foot-5 Haliburton \u2013 a 20-year-old born on Feb. 29, 2000 \u2013 has started only once, but his 28.8 minutes per game rank second only to Cleveland\u2019s Isaac Okoro. His scoring and shooting accuracy from the arc (5 of 22) and overall (34.2%) dipped in the past week. Yet his rebounds and passing have been up, with 30 assists to just eight turnovers in the four games through Feb. 1. For the season, his 3.38 assist-to-turnover ratio is better than star ball handlers such as Chris Paul (3.3), Luka Doncic (2.40) and Stephen Curry (1.79). Taking care of the ball means fewer lost possessions and more opportunities for Haliburton and, especially, his teammates. Lately, he and the Kings have been taking advantage of them where it counts most. The Top 5 this week on the 2020-21 Kia Rookie Ladder: (All stats through Monday, Feb. 1) Season stats : 12.2 ppg, 5.9 rpg, 6.1 apg  Since last Ladder: 16.3 ppg, 5.0 rpg, 7.0 apg  Last Ladder\u2019s rung: 2 First Ball dominated play for Charlotte in their upset victory over the weekend vs. Milwaukee: 27 points, five rebounds, nine assists, three steals, 8-for-10 shooting and a plus-37 in the 12-point triumph. Then he got rewarded with his first start of the season at Miami Monday as Terry Rozier nursed a sore ankle. This time, Ball shot 3-for-11, had five fouls and was a minus-6, yet the Hornets won their third in a row. Properly named the Eastern Conference\u2019s Rookie of the Month for December and January, his per-36 numbers (17.4 ppg, 8.3 rpg, 8.7 apg) are better than what made Philadelphia\u2019s Ben Simmons (16.7, 8.4, 7.8) an All-Star the past two years. 2. Tyrese Haliburton, Sacramento Kings Season stats : 10.7 ppg, 3.8 rpg, 5.4 apg  Since last Ladder: 8.0 ppg, 6.5 rpg, 7.5 apg  Last Ladder\u2019s rung: 3 Considering how much praise Haliburton has earned for his steady, veteran-like-beyond-his-years play for Sacramento, he has had his share of highlight moments, too. Sure, he has scored in double figures 13 times in 18 games and led the Kings in assists six times, with one points-assists double-double. But he scored 15 points in the fourth quarter against Chicago Jan. 6. Haliburton has shown a knack for hitting big shots late, whether inside or (way) outside the arc. He is averaging 1.4 steals for every 36 minutes played, which is appropriate for the steal of the 2020 Draft so far. 3. James Wiseman, Golden State Warriors Season stats : 12.2 ppg, 6.1 rpg, 0.7 apg  Since last Ladder: 13.7 ppg, 7.0 rpg, 1.0 apg  Last Ladder\u2019s rung: 1 Wiseman snagged the Ladder\u2019s top rung last week, in spite of his move to the Golden State bench. And he was doing well in that role, boosting his major stats \u2013 until landing awkwardly against Detroit on Jan. 30 and spraining his left wrist. Getting sidelined for 7-10 days explains what may be a temporary drop to No. 3. 4. Anthony Edwards, Minnesota Timberwolves Season stats : 13.6 ppg, 3.0 rpg, 1.9 apg  Since last Ladder: 19.0 ppg, 4.0 rpg, 2.8 apg  Last Ladder\u2019s rung: 5 If the No. 1 pick in the Draft, any Draft, can\u2019t start for the worst team in the conference, something seems out of synch. That\u2019s the better-late-than-never realization up in Minnesota, where Edwards had been in a bench role for his first 17 appearances. That wasn\u2019t getting any of the Wolves anywhere fast. Edwards\u2019 move into the starting lineup paid off quickly. He is clicking with teammates D\u2019Angelo Russell and Malik Beasley. His shooting has picked up \u2013 47.5\/47.4\/1.000 as a starter vs. 35.5\/30.4\/81.6 as a reserve. And his defensive gaffes have been fewer. 5. Immanuel Quickley, New York Knicks Season stats : 12.6 ppg, 2.4 rpg, 2.8 apg  Since last Ladder: 18.0 ppg, 4.5 rpg, 3.5 apg  Last Ladder\u2019s rung: 6 Quickley already is giving Knicks fans something that Frank Ntilikina and Kevin Knox rarely did as rookies, and that\u2019s some reason for hope and excitement. Those two recent lottery picks became part of the woebegone culture that predated them in New York. Quickley is a source of optimism for his scoring, his ability to play point guard and his court smarts so far. The No. 25 pick is averaging 23.0 minutes on 18.4 shots per 36 minutes and moving up the Ladder weekly, while making squirm scouts who projected him as strictly a second-rounder. 6. Cole Anthony, Orlando Magic Season stats : 10.8 ppg, 4.4 rpg, 3.7 apg  Since last Ladder: 9.7 ppg, 3.7 rpg, 6.0 apg  Last Ladder\u2019s rung: 4 Providing floor leadership while shooting 36.2%. 7. Isaac Okoro, Cleveland Cavaliers Season stats : 8.3 ppg, 2.3 rpg, 2.1 apg  Since last Ladder: 8.0 ppg, 2.0 rpg, 3.3 apg  Last Ladder\u2019s rung: 7 Rookie minutes leader hit 12 of 23 shots to help Cavs go 2-2. 8. Precious Achiuwa, Miami Heat Season stats : 7.5 ppg, 4.8 rpg, 0.8 apg  Since last Ladder: 7.5 ppg, 4.0 rpg, 0.0 apg  Last Ladder\u2019s rung: N\/A A double-double (16.7 ppg, 10.8 rpg) producer per 36 minutes. 9. Desmond Bane, Memphis Grizzlies Season stats : 9.1 ppg, 2.9 rpg, 1.1 apg  Since last Ladder: 12.5 ppg, 3.5 rpg, 1.5 apg  Last Ladder\u2019s rung: N\/A Hitting 50.9% of 3-pointers for streaking Grizzlies. 10. Isaiah Stewart, Detroit Pistons Season stats : 4.8 ppg, 5.4 rpg, 0.7 apg  Since last Ladder: 5.3 ppg, 5.7 rpg, 0.3 apg  Last Ladder\u2019s rung: N\/A Banging his way to 5.4 offensive rebounds per 36 minutes. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Here\u2019s a closer look at the stats to know from his 54-point barrage: According to the Elias Sports Bureau, VanVleet\u2019s 54 points were the most points in an NBA game for an undrafted player \u2014 eclipsing the 53 scored by Hall of Fame big man Moses Malone on the exact same date 39 years earlier. Via Elias Sports, these are the top five highest-scoring games by an undrafted player in the modern Draft era (since 1966): Editor\u2019s note: Malone\u2019s professional career began in the ABA with the Utah Stars. He was then brought into the NBA through the ABA Dispersal Draft in 1976 when he was taken fifth overall by the Portland Trail Blazers. He never played for Portland and was later sent to the Buffalo Braves for a 1978 first-round pick. He played two games with Buffalo before being dealt to the Houston Rockets for two future Draft picks. Toronto has not been short on its share of great players, with Vince Carter, Kyle Lowry, DeMar DeRozan, Kawhi Leonard and Chris Bosh holding down places on the franchise\u2019s all-time leaderboard. However, none of them can claim the No. 1 scoring game in Toronto history as that honor is now solely VanVleet\u2019s. He eclipsed the previous mark, a 52-point showing by DeRozan against the Milwaukee Bucks back on Jan. 1, 2018. Here are the four highest-scoring games in Raptors history: VanVleet entered Tuesday\u2019s game shooting 35.1% on 3-pointers in 2020-21, well below the 39% he posted in 2019-20 and off from his career 39.1% mark. That was atoned for against the Magic thanks to an 11-for-14 showing (78.6%) that helped him make some additional history as well. (For the record, VanVleet\u2019s outburst helped boost his 3-point percentage this season to 38.3%.) He made eight of those 11 3-pointers in the first half, which set a Raptors franchise record for most 3-pointers made in any half. The mark had previously been held by Danny Green (set on Jan. 19, 2019 vs. Memphis) and Terrance Ross (set on Jan. 25, 2014 vs. the LA Clippers), when both players hit seven 3-pointers. Additionally, those 11 3-pointers VanVleet made came on 78.6% shooting, allowing him to become the third player in NBA history to make 11 or more 3-pointers in a game while shooting 75% or better. The other players on that list? Stephen Curry and Zach LaVine. Lastly, another bit of undrafted player history belongs solely to VanVleet now, too. His 11 made 3-pointers are the most in a single game by an undrafted player, surpassing the previous mark of 10 held by Miami\u2019s Duncan Robinson (set on Dec. 10, 2019 against Atlanta) and the Lakers\u2019 Wesley Matthews (set on Dec. 6, 2015 when he played for Dallas).

The French forward has been impressive as of late, but he could be even better in this one. Reggie Jackson (PG \u2013 LAC) : $5,500 at BKN  Jackson should get another start tonight with Patrick Beverley out of action, and at just $5.5K, he could be a huge value in what figures to be a tremendous game environment. Xavier Tillman (PF \u2013 MEM) : $5,400 at IND  I\u2019ll keep going back to Tillman as long as he\u2019s this cheap. Across his last five, Tillman has scored no fewer than 25 FD points in any game, posting at least 33 FD points twice. Gorgui Dieng (C \u2013 MEM) : $5,300 at IND  Dieng is a great pivot at center if you\u2019re looking to save some coin. Across his last two games, he\u2019s scored 67.2 FD points in 50 minutes of action. Joe Harris (SF \u2013 BKN) : $5,000 vs. LAC Despite committing an egregious turnover that led to an improbable Wizards\u2019 win, Harris scored 30 his last time out. James Harden sat that one out, but Harris is a staple in the Nets\u2019 starting lineup and deserves tournament consideration for a game with a massive over\/under. De\u2019Anthony Melton (PG \u2013 MEM) : $4,800 at IND  Melton has quietly averaged 37.5 FD points and 25 minutes across his last two games. The $4.8K price tag is way too cheap for a guy playing at this level. Mo Wagner (PF \u2013 WAS) : $4,800 vs. POR  Wagner went for 32 FD points in his last game, and he\u2019ll look to build on that tonight against Portland. This is the other game on the slate with a 240+ over\/under, and I want some exposure to this one, especially when the price is sub-$5K. Khem Birch (PF \u2013 ORL) : $4,500 vs. TOR  Birch has been extremely valuable off the bench for Orlando this season, averaging just over 20 FD points per game, including 24 per game across his last four. With Aaron Gordon set to miss the next 4-6 weeks, Birch should see some additional run moving forward. Kevon Looney (C \u2013 GSW) : $3,900 vs. BOS  Playing a Golden State center is always a risky move, but Looney can\u2019t be ignored in tournaments tonight at just $3.9K. James Wiseman will sit this one out, and Looney will presumably soak up starter\u2019s minutes. He\u2019s averaged nearly a double-double per-36 minutes this season, and I\u2019ll definitely have some shares tonight. Anfernee Simons (PG \u2013 POR) : $3,800 at WAS  Simons has played at least 27 minutes in each of his last four games while scoring 30+ FD points twice in that span.

Clippers (16-5) at Nets (13-9), 7:30 p.m. ET, TNT This matchup features the two most accurate 3-point shooting teams as the Clippers shoot 41.6% from beyond the arc, followed by the Brooklyn Nets at 40.1%. The last time a team shot over 40% from 3 over the course of a season was Golden State back in 2015-16 . Individually, LA\u2019s Paul George (3.6) and Brooklyn\u2019s Joe Harris (3.4) rank 5th and 9th, respectively, in 3-pointers made per game. Harris ranks 6th in the league in 3-point percentage (49.0%), while George ranks 14th (45.4%) \u2014 career-best accuracy from both players. Since James Harden\u2019s Brooklyn debut on Jan. 16, the Nets have averaged 127.3 points per game , which is 6.3 ppg higher than any other team during that stretch. By comparison, the Clippers are averaging 115.6 points in that same period. While the Nets\u2019 offense has been outstanding, their defense has allowed a league-high 124.6 ppg , thus giving them the 11th-best point differential (plus 2.8 per game). Per Synergy play type data, the Nets have the top three isolation scorers in the league; led by James Harden (8.0 ppg, 61.7 eFG), followed by Kyrie Irving (5.5 ppg, 71.4 eFG%) and Kevin Durant (4.4 ppg, 62.5 eFG%). Kawhi Leonard leads the Clippers at 3.9 ppg, with ranks fifth in the league. So far this season, there are four players averaging at least 15 points while posting 50-40-90 shooting splits . Three of those players will be in this game: Kyrie Irving (27.6 PPG, 52.5 FG%, 42.1 3P%, 94.5 FT%), Kawhi Leonard (25.9 PPG, 50,8 FG%, 41.0 3P%, 91.8 FT%) and Paul George (23.6 PPG, 50.2 FG%, 45.4 3P%, 91.3 FT%). Celtics (10-8) at Warriors (11-9), 10 p.m. ET, TNT The Warriors are 8-4 at home and have won three straight at Chase Center entering Tuesday\u2019s game with Boston. Golden State averages 7.5 more ppg, shooting 4.8 percentage points better from the field, 4.5 percentage points better from three, and dish out 3.2 more apg at home compared to the road. Kelly Oubre Jr. has been much better at home than on the road this season. In 12 home games, he is averaging 13.6 points on 43.1% shooting from the field, 29.8% from three and 75.7% from the line. In 8 road games, those numbers drop to 9.6 ppg, 28.9 FG%, 13.6 3P% and 71.4 FT%. The Celtics are expected to be without Marcus Smart for 2-3 weeks while he nurses a calf injury. Not only will the Celtics need to replace his 13.1 ppg (4th on team), but also their leader in assists (6.1 per game, 20th in NBA) and steals (1.8 per game, T-4th in NBA). Jaylen Brown has scored at least 20 points in 10 straight games ; not only is that the longest streak of his career, it is the fourth-longest active streak in the league, trailing only Kevin Durant, Bradley Beal and Nikola Jokic. Stephen Curry (4.5 per game) ranks second to only CJ McCollum (4.8 per game) for the highest average of 3-pointers made per game. Curry is shooting 40.8% from beyond the arc so far this season, which is 1.6 percentage points below his career average of 43.4%."},{"id":485826,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/paul-george-has-answer-for-critics-after-challenging-bubble-stint","date":"2021-02-02","title":"Paul George has answer for critics after challenging bubble stint","content":"The previous NBA postseason was a bizarre basketball bazaar held inside an insulated \u201cbubble\u201d and it pummeled him and shook him but, as we\u2019ve seen since then, didn\u2019t break Paul George. Having fallen off that hoops summit ever so spectacularly in so many ways, he\u2019s displaying the skill and impact at both ends of the court that many have come to expect from him. George is once again delivering that for the LA Clippers here in what\u2019s shaping up as an All-NBA level regular season. Of course, it\u2019s those last two cautionary words \u2014 \u201cregular season\u201d \u2014 that imply George is typically marvelous from fall until spring, and then gets exposed for being less than a superstar when it truly counts. The results are the results: George has had some bitter playoff eliminations and is still looking for his first NBA Finals. There\u2019s nothing he can say or even do about that right now, nothing except bide his time, keep the Clippers elevated in the West, then deal with those demons when the playoffs arrive in late May. Then, there will be plenty at stake: The fate of a team built to win now, and the reputation of their wing player who must somehow repair all the damage from the slander thrown his way lately at 100 miles per hour. As he mentioned recently, George has felt these missiles not only from the usual sources \u2014 social media mainly \u2014 but some of his peers who chose to break ranks and openly criticize a fellow member of the NBA family. Usually whenever it\u2019s player vs. player, it\u2019s because of an incident that spilled over from a game. In the case of George, players who never had beef with him have mocked him and his history of playing subpar in the playoffs, either directly or through social media. It came into view most vividly last month during a game with the Phoenix Suns. That\u2019s when Chris Paul and Devin Booker had words with George, and Booker was particularly salty. George revealed then how he \u201cdidn\u2019t hear none of this in my first 10 years in the league\u201d and chalked it up as \u201cpeople just living in the past\u201d \u2014 mainly, what happened in the bubble \u2014 and later issued the vow that\u2019s designed to put him squarely on the spot: \u201cI\u2019m coming back with a vengeance.\u201d As he and the Clippers prepare for the Brooklyn Nets on Tuesday in a game where the four key players involved \u2014 George, Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving and James Harden \u2014 bring a combined 34 All-Star appearances, George is fulfilling that bold declaration. His play so far is stellar if not borderline MVP-ish. In terms of true shooting percentage this season, George\u2019s 66% ranks among the NBA\u2019s best and is No. 2 among players who were All-Stars last season (Joel Embiid is No. 1 at 66.9%). He\u2019s scoring well (23.6 ppg) and enjoying his best shooting season both overall (50.2%) and from 3-point range (45.4%). That\u2019s an amazing stretch of efficiency and evidence that George, whenever given the chance to score, is mostly making the best of it. And that\u2019s not even mentioning his defense, which once again is top shelf. George is the rare player who can guard multiple positions, and he\u2019ll have a steep assignment Tuesday with Harden or Durant, and may spend time guarding both. George cites his healthy shoulder, which was surgically repaired two summers ago, as a reason for his current play. His turnovers remain problematic as his 3.8 per game is a career high and he\u2019s ninth in the league in overall turnovers. Much of that is due to the Clippers lacking a true point guard, forcing George and Leonard to assume play-creating duties for themselves and others. \u201cI\u2019ve got to be better, I\u2019ve got to take care of the ball a lot better,\u201d George said. \u201cBut for me, it\u2019s fun. I play for my teammates so it\u2019s not going to be perfect, but I thrive on being on the floor and trying to make my teammates better.\u201d New Clippers coach Ty Lue is stressing ball movement, and George is buying into that philosophy (as his 5.4 apg average \u2014 a career-high \u2014 proves). \u201cI love connecting the team, I love getting guys shots,\u201d he said. \u201cOne guy makes a play for another, and our whole team just plays that same style.\u201d He served notice this season right from jump, with 33 points in the season-opening win against the Lakers. Since then: 39 points against the Suns in a chippy win against Booker and Co. on Jan. 3; 25 and six steals in a loss to the Jazz on Jan. 1 and a career high 12 assists against the Kings on Jan. 20. The Brooklyn game will be a must-watch, as George will get a highly anticipated matchup with Harden in one of those games that will command the attention of the NBA world. It\u2019s the same world that watched George struggle last fall in Orlando, and it\u2019s not a stretch to suggest he helped drag down the Clippers. He shot 35.8% against Dallas \u2014 including a three-game stretch in which he made just 10 of his 47 shots \u2014 in a series the Clippers won 4-3. George went public about the mental challenges he felt then. Some of that was perhaps brought upon by George\u2019s decision to engage in a social-media spat with Damian Lillard after the Blazers star missed a pair of last-second free throws in a restart game and endured laughter from the Clippers\u2019 bench by Pat Beverley and Marcus Morris. When George joined in, he was universally mocked for his own playoff failures, starting in Indiana, then OKC. While Lillard has spent his entire career with one team and resisted any urge to leave and join a \u201csuperteam,\u201d George has negotiated his way out of two franchises. The weight on his shoulders grew heavier when he and the Clippers collapsed against Denver in the Western Conference semfinals after leading the series 3-1. Leonard and George combined to shoot two for 18 after halftime in the Game 7 loss, and George was faced with a short offseason of soul searching. \u201cI had a tough year last year,\u201d George conceded. \u201cPeople think it\u2019s sweet. I gotta answer that \u2026 It\u2019s fine. I\u2019ve got to play up through that. I\u2019ll go through the fire.\u201d It was just two seasons ago when George finished No. 3 in Kia MVP voting. He and Russell Westbrook made for a dangerous duo in OKC, until Lillard waved them both good-bye with a series-clinching shot over George from nearly mid-court. While appearing on the podcast \u201cAll The Smoke\u201d in December, George said he feels as good physically as he did in 2018, while also declaring himself washed clean of all the mental pain from the bubble. The multiple challenges of making the Clippers feel no buyer\u2019s remorse after giving him a four-year, $190 million extension, and helping the club bounce back from the bubble experience, and mainly from all the \u201cchatter\u201d directed to him, is fueling George now. \u201cI didn\u2019t like, not so much of the noise and everything around it, but just the fact that people saw weakness,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I had to address that. I had to answer that. That fueled me. That put me in a place where I wanted to come back and be myself again.\u201d Morris said: \u201cI\u2019m happy to see that aggressiveness and I know for a fact that he had something to prove, and I know that\u2019s the way he\u2019s feeling. So we\u2019re excited, man.\u201d The biggest challenge for George and the Clippers is to keep that excitement flowing through the late summer. That\u2019s a long time, and the playoffs seem far down the path, and true redemption must wait until then. At the very least, George is putting himself in position for redemption to happen. \u201cAfter the tough year last year, it was the only way I could respond,\u201d George said. \u201cThat was the only thing on my mind and the only thing was to get better.\u201d * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

Memphis tipped off the action with an inactive list featuring Grayson Allen (health and safety protocols), Jaren Jackson Jr. (left meniscus surgery recovery), Sean McDermott (left shoulder bone bruise), Jontay Porter (right knee soreness), Killian Tillie (left foot soreness), Jonas Valan\u010di\u016bnas (health and safety protocols) and Justise Winslow (left hip displacement). Yet for the fourth consecutive outing, the Grizzlies finished with at least seven players scoring at least 10 points, which registers as the NBA\u2019s longest such streak since the 1990-91 Portland Trail Blazers. \u201cI feel like it just shows how deep we are with our roster,\u201d said Ja Morant, who finished with 13 points, eight assists and two steals. \u201cWe have a lot of guys who can go out and produce on the floor. Obviously [we\u2019re] missing the guys who are hurt. It\u2019s kind of tough. \u201cBut we\u2019ve been saying all season we have this next-man-up mentality, and to be ready when your number is called. I feel like everybody who is going out on that floor is helping us big time.\u201d They\u2019re also quietly setting up the league\u2019s hottest team for what should be a fruitful February as it awaits the return of Jackson and Winslow, who are expected to rejoin the lineup \u201cvery soon,\u201d according to Grizzlies coach Taylor Jenkins. \u201cOur depth is what we always talk about,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cThese guys have done a tremendous job all season long.\u201d They\u2019ve done it in the face of daunting circumstances, too. Morant sat out of eight games with an ankle sprain, one of three starters to miss significant time. Yet somehow Memphis has found a way to put together its best road start in franchise history (6-1), while setting new franchise bests for margin of victory in back-to-back wins over the Spurs, who they\u2019ve faced on 102 occasions in the regular season. In Monday\u2019s lopsided affair, the Grizzlies dished 37 assists as Tyus Jones led with 14 individually. Memphis has dished 32 assists or more in five consecutive road games, one fewer than the 1990-91 Denver Nuggets\u2019 league record streak. \u201cIt\u2019s very exciting for me because it just shows we have a lot of guys on this team that can make plays for not only themselves, but for others,\u201d Morant said. \u201cI feel like every night it shows how unselfish we are. I\u2019m a pass-first guy. I love assists. So to see everybody sharing the ball and making plays is something good to see.\u201d What Morant didn\u2019t like watching during his time away with an ankle injury was the naysayers ready to write off 2020-21 not even a week into the season, after he went down three days after Christmas against the Brooklyn Nets. During Morant\u2019s absence from Dec. 30 to Jan. 13, the Grizzlies fought to a 4-4 record, losing four out of five immediately after the injury before starting the club\u2019s current winning streak. This from a team that came into the season with the NBA\u2019s second youngest average age at 24.3 years old. \u201cWith me being out and still seeing guys make plays, that tells all the people earlier in the season who [were] doubting them and talking about them to just shut up,\u201d Morant said. Against the Spurs, which they destroyed 62-32 in the paint, the young Grizzlies let their play on the floor crank the volume inside San Antonio\u2019s AT&T Center. Gorgui Dieng led Memphis with 19 points, hitting 3-of-3 from deep. Brandon Clarke contributed 18, followed by Kyle Anderson and De\u2019Anthony Melton with 17 apiece, while Dillon Brooks chipped in 13 points. Jones logged 11 points, and rookies Desmond Bane and Xavier Tillman each poured in 10. Tillman finished only one rebound shy of his first career double-double. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of depth on this team,\u201d Jones said. \u201cI think that was one of the things going into the year that we looked at and kind of knew. We just knew we\u2019ve got to use that to our advantage night in and night out. It\u2019s a long season. [With] COVID[-19], we knew that our depth was going to come in handy. So, we\u2019re just trying to make the most of it.\u201d They\u2019re definitely succeeding, especially when factoring in the Spurs using all 14 of the players they suited up for this matchup. \u201cWe just play together,\u201d Dieng said. \u201cWe share the ball. We don\u2019t care who scores.\u201d What\u2019s important now given all the experience gained from players stepping up due to various injuries and the league\u2019s health and safety protocols is how Memphis takes advantage as the season progresses. The Grizzlies are looking to make the postseason for the first time since 2016-17. The club\u2019s injury report has stayed full for the majority of the season, and the Grizzlies aren\u2019t even a week removed from sitting through a 12-day layoff due to the league\u2019s health and safety protocols. In a way, all the setbacks might prove beneficial with so many players gaining valuable experience, which in turn should allow the Grizzlies to take their time in bringing back Jackson and Winslow. Jackson hasn\u2019t yet played a game for the Grizzlies this season, and Winslow hasn\u2019t yet made his Memphis debut since joining the team last February. Winslow spoke to the media Monday for the first time since July, and said he hopes to return to the lineup sometime this month. Jenkins said the club is ramping up both players\u2019 work as the team preps for their return. \u201cWe\u2019re super excited. I give those guys a lot of credit,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cAs we\u2019ve said all season long: these guys are still on target, on schedule, and they\u2019ve been ramping up since we\u2019ve gotten back in action just only a couple of days ago. These guys have fully bought into the return-to-play plans. They\u2019ve been attacking it both on and off the court. And how connected they\u2019ve been with their teammates has been awesome. \u201cIt gives us a lot of excitement knowing that very soon here with Justise and Jaren, those guys will be back in the fold. That means so much to us. They\u2019ve dialed back in, and as we ramp them up over the next couple of weeks here and over the course of the month, we\u2019re excited to get them back in the fold.\u201d * * * Michael C.

The Yahoo database will be utilized, and only players rostered in less than 50% of leagues will be mentioned. De\u2019Anthony Melton (PG\/SG \u2013 MEM): 6% rostered Melton played 32 minutes last game and contributed 20 points, four 3-pointers, five rebounds, two assists, and two blocks. The game was a blowout, and the Grizzlies were down a few players. I have no idea if this is the New World Order, as he was playing around 20 minutes per game in the prior six games. There\u2019s upside here, especially since he\u2019s only 22 years old, but there\u2019s a risk as well because his role and playing time are not assured. Thaddeus Young (PF \u2013 CHI): 23% rostered Over the last two games, Young has played 29 and 31 minutes. He\u2019s scored eight and 16 points while notching a steal in each game, which is what he\u2019s known for. The eye-popping numbers have been the 11 and 9 rebounds and 11 and 9 assists. He had never averaged more than two assists in any of the last five seasons, so this looks to be an outlier. With that said, with Wendell Carter Jr. out for a few weeks, Young should continue to see significant playing time. JaMychal Green (PF\/C \u2013 DEN): 16% rostered Green only averages 20 minutes per game. Yuck. With that said, he provides points, 3-pointers, and rebounds. Green has scored double figures in 10 games, provided at least two 3-pointers in 12, and grabbed at least five rebounds in 13 contests. How many 10\/2\/5 games, you ask? 11. He\u2019s also garnered a usage rate of at least 20 in 10 games. Royce O\u2019Neale (SF\/PF \u2013 UTA): 24% rostered O\u2019Neale is the opposite of sexy. His wife or girlfriend would beg to differ, but it\u2019s the truth from a fantasy perspective. The usage rate is often sub-10%, and he will never win a week for you. What he does do, though, is contribute a little something in every category without hurting you in any. And he plays over 32 minutes per game. On the season, he\u2019s averaging 32.4 minutes, 7.8 points, 1.7 3-pointers, 6.6 rebounds, 2.3 assists, 0.6 steals, and 0.6 blocks while shooting 47% from the floor and 81% from the line. Gary Trent Jr. (SG\/SF \u2013 POR): 31% rostered With the injury to C. J. McCollum, Trent has started the last three games and played 37, 38, and 41 minutes. He\u2019s scored 18, 23, and 22 points while contributing four, seven, and four 3-pointers. He has also grabbed four, one, and two steals. This has translated to top 20 production for fantasy! Now, he doesn\u2019t contribute much outside of points, 3-pointers, and steals. There are also issues with his efficiency as he can go ice cold from the field. He\u2019s shot sub-40% in six games this season. With that said, he\u2019s going to play a ton while McCollum is out. James Johnson (PF\/C \u2013 DAL): 3% rostered Johnson only plays around 22-23 minutes per game, but he provides across-the-board production when he\u2019s out on the court. Think of him as swap meet Royce O\u2019Neale. He\u2019s averaging 7.3 points, 0.7 3-pointers, 3.5 rebounds, 1.9 assists, 1 steal, and 1 block on the season. The field goal percentage is a respectable 49%, but the free throw shooting is his only bugaboo, as he\u2019s converting 54% of his attempts. The volume is low at 1.2 per game, so the effect is mitigated. Justin Holiday (SG\/SF \u2013 IND): 39% rostered Holiday has started the last 10 games and is averaging around 34 minutes per game. He will grab some rebounds but is primarily a 3-point and steals specialist. He\u2019s shooting 48% from the field on the season, but there are plenty of stretches in which he shoots sub-40%. Half the battle for fantasy is minutes, and Holiday is getting a ton of those. Jarred Vanderbilt (SF\/PF \u2013 MIN): 23% rostered Vanderbilt had started six consecutive games before coming off the bench last game. It made no difference to his playing time, though, as he received 24 minutes in either capacity. Vanderbilt won\u2019t provide 3-pointers but can score, rebound, and provide defensive stats. The field goal percentage is robust (64% on the season), but the free-throw shooting is an eye-sore (45%). Now, Vanderbilt has been receiving a lot of playing because Juancho Hernangomez has been out of action. He\u2019s expected to return soon from COVID protocols, so it will be interesting to see what direction the coaching staff takes. Will they prefer Hernangomez\u2019s shooting ability to space the floor or Vanderbilt\u2019s defensive prowess? Immanuel Quickley (PG \u2013 NYK): 35% rostered This is a more speculative suggestion because the production and playing time have been all over the map for Quickly. He\u2019s played 23-24 minutes in each of the last three games. Before that, though, he played 17, 11, and 15 minutes. Before that stretch, he received 21, 28, 22, and 29 minutes. Shrug. He\u2019s shown the ability to score and initiate the offense, but Coach Thibideau continues to play Elfrid Payton due to his defensive and veteran presence. He\u2019s also been inconsistent with his scoring. Over the past four games, he\u2019s gone for 25, six, 31, and eight points. With all that said, he\u2019s shown that he can play in the league, and there\u2019s a chance that he overtakes Payton at some point. If that happens, then the sky is the limit. Jeff Green (SF\/PF\/C \u2013 BKN): 27% rostered After languishing for much of the early season schedule, Green has been a fixture in the lineup over the last 13 games. Even though he\u2019s been coming off the bench for the past five games, Green has been averaging 29 minutes and scored double-digits in each game. Nash has been utilizing Green as the small-ball center when he wants to space the floor, and he\u2019s often been in the closing lineup. Outside of points, Green can contribute some 3-pointers, rebounds, assists, and steals. Cody Zeller (C \u2013 CHA): 26% rostered Zeller missed 13 games this year, so it took him some time to get back up to speed. In his return, he played 11 minutes, then 15 the next, and 18 after that. In the fourth game, he received his first start and played 30 minutes. Last game, he played 34 minutes and looks completely healthy and raring to go. He\u2019s pulled down 15 and 14 rebounds while dishing out seven and four games in two separate games. The scoring isn\u2019t a huge part of his game, but he has attempted nine, 11, and 10 field goal attempts in each start. As we advance, the question is the playing time, as he averaged 23, 25, and 19 minutes per game in each of the last three seasons and has never played more than 28 minutes per contest."},{"id":485809,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/quin-snyder-doc-rivers-named-nba-coaches-of-the-month","date":"2021-02-01","title":"Quin Snyder, Doc Rivers named NBA Coaches of the Month","content":"Utah Jazz coach Quin Snyder and Philadelphia 76ers coach Doc Rivers have been named the NBA Coaches of the Month for games played in December and January.

The league was smart to schedule only (a little over) half of 1,080 games they proposed to play this season. But even with that planning, they\u2019ve called an audible. With 22 games having been postponed because teams didn\u2019t have enough healthy and non-quarantined players, and with two teams having been hit particularly hard by absences, the league has started adding games back into the schedule. Over the last week, they\u2019ve inserted six games back into the last five weeks of the schedule, shifting a couple others around to accommodate the additions. What\u2019s below is where things stand on Feb. 1, with the possibility that more changes could come in the coming days. Two teams have been hardest hit by COVID issues. The Washington Wizards had six straight games postponed from Jan. 13-22. The Memphis Grizzlies had a postponement on Jan. 15, and then five straight from Jan. 20-27. The three sets of schedule changes last week added three games back to Wizards\u2019 schedule, reducing their deficit from six to three. The Grizzlies just got back to work on Saturday and have had one game added back. So there could be more modifications forthcoming, with Feb. 23 as another possible make-up day that would avoid a back-to-back-to-back scenario for Memphis. Beyond the Wiz and Grizz, six teams have two-game deficits. Another six teams have played all their scheduled games this far. The Utah Jazz won 11 straight games before losing in Denver on Sunday and currently sit in second place in the Western Conference at 15-5. They\u2019re the only team in the league that ranks in the top six in both offensive and defensive efficiency. The Jazz haven\u2019t played a particularly difficult schedule \u2013 10 of their 20 games have come against teams that currently have losing records \u2013 but they have plenty of quality wins. The Jazz have the second best record (7-3) in games played between the 15 teams that are currently over .500. More games within that group are coming. The Jazz have the West\u2019s toughest remaining first-half schedule in regard to cumulative opponent winning percentage (0.538). Their 16 games over the next five weeks are fairly balanced between games against teams that currently have winning records (9) and teams that don\u2019t (7), but six of the 16 are against the other six teams that are at least three games over .500: the Clippers (x2), the Lakers, the Sixers (x2) and the Bucks. Beyond those three against the L.A. teams, the Jazz have only one remaining first-half game within the Western Conference. They\u2019re scheduled to play 12 of their 16 (including each of their next eight) games against the other conference, holding a 5-2 record against the East thus far. H, R = Home, Road B2B = Back-to-backs RA | RDA = Rest-advantage, Rest-disadvantage games OppPCT = Cumulative opponent winning percentage >.500 = Games against teams that entered Feb. with winning records OppO = Games against teams that entered Feb. in the top 10 & bottom 10 in offensive efficiency OppD = Games against teams that entered Feb. in the top 10 & bottom 10 in defensive efficiency Rest advantage = Didn\u2019t play the day before. Opponent is playing the second game of a back-to-back. Rest disadvantage = Playing the second game of a back-to-back. Opponent didn\u2019t play the day before. Through Sunday, teams are 37-27 (.578) in rest-advantage games, 19-12 at home and 18-15 on the road. Western Conference notes : The Cleveland Cavaliers are one of the surprise teams of the season thus far, sitting in seventh place in the Eastern Conference at 9-11 through Sunday. More surprising than their record is that the Cavs rank eighth defensively after ranking 30th in each of the last two seasons. The Cavs haven\u2019t played the easiest schedule in the league thus far, and they have three wins over the Sixers (1) and Nets (2). But things are about to get much tougher. After the Cavs complete a back-to-back, home-and-home series against the 5-14 Minnesota Timberwolves on Monday, they will play nine straight games against teams that enter February with winning records. That stretch includes two games each against the 16-5 LA Clippers and the 11-8 Milwaukee Bucks. And those four games are part of a stretch where the Cavs are playing six of seven against teams that rank in the top six in offensive efficiency. So that eighth-ranked defense will be tested. In regard to cumulative opponent winning percentage (0.566), the Cavs have the toughest schedule over the next five weeks. Of their 16 remaining games, 14 are against the 16 teams that are currently at or above .500. So when we get to the All-Star break on March 5, we\u2019ll have a much better idea of just how real the Cavs\u2019 improvement is.

Sacramento Kings (8-11) at New Orleans Pelicans (7-11) 8 p.m. ET, NBA League Pass To get the week started, we have the second meeting of the season between the Kings and Pelicans. Based on their first game on Jan. 17 \u2014 a 128-123 Pelicans win \u2014 this is a must-see matchup. The Pelicans got the best of the Kings in Sacramento thanks to Zion Williamson\u2019s dominant performance. Zion finished with 31 points on 13-15 shooting from the field \u2014 all of his buckets came in the paint, including a few rim-shaking dunks. For the Kings, De\u2019Aaron Fox scored career-best 43 points and dished out 13 assists for the first 40-point, 10-assist game of the Sacramento Kings era (since 1985). Portland Trail Blazers (10-8) at Washington Wizards (4-12) 8 p.m. ET, NBA League Pass Bradley Beal vs. Damian Lillard. It\u2019s a matchup of the No. 1 and No. 3 scorers in the league headed into Week 7. Beal is averaging a league-high 34.9 ppg (a 4.5 ppg jump from last season) and is coming off a 37-point night in Washington\u2019s wild win over Brooklyn on Sunday. Lillard is averaging 29.6 ppg (nearly matching his career high of 30 ppg from last season) and is coming off a season-high 44 points , including the game-winning three at the buzzer, in Chicago on Saturday. There have been 28 40-point games across the NBA so far this season; Beal leads the way with three of those performances, followed by Lillard, who is tied for second two a pair of 40-point games in the books. It\u2019s not just about this season\u2019s leading scorers, this game could also see Carmelo Anthony make another step up the all-time scoring leaderboard . He enters the week needing 21 points to pass Dominique Wilkins for 13th on the all-time list. The Blazers open the week against the Spurs on Monday, so Melo may have already passed Wilkins or may be on the verge when the Blazers face the Wizards on Tuesday. Dallas Mavericks (8-12) at Atlanta Hawks (10-9) 7:30 p.m. ET, NBA League Pass From the NBA League Pass Season First Half Watch Guide : Luka Doncic vs. Trae Young. The two young stars will forever be tied thanks to the Draft-night trade that landed them in their respective cities. Moreover, Young and Doncic are two of the most dynamic young players in the game today as they finished last season fourth and sixth, respectively, in NBA scoring and second and third, respectively, in assists \u2026 in just their second season. LA Clippers (16-5) at Cleveland Cavaliers (9-11) 8 p.m. ET, NBA League Pass The Clippers enter Week 7 with best record in league (16-5) and own the top spot in this week\u2019s Power Rankings . The Clippers have won three straight and 10 of their last 11 games dating back to Jan. 10. After each missing five days due to health and safety protocols, Kawhi Leonard and Paul George have been back in the lineup for the past two games and have the Clippers rolling. They now face a Cavs team with a penchant for knocking off top tier teams, with a pair of wins over the Brooklyn Nets and a win against the Philadelphia 76ers. Collin Sexton has been one of the breakout stars of the 2020-21 season and his scoring is imperative to Cleveland\u2019s success. The Cavs are 6-1 when Sexton scores at least 25 points \u2026 and 1-7 when he\u2019s held below 25 points. Houston Rockets (9-9) at Memphis Grizzlies (8-6) 9 p.m. ET, NBA League Pass The Grizzlies (six games) and Rockets (five games) enter Week 7 riding the two longest active win streaks in the league. Can they keep those streaks alive before they clash on Thursday? Memphis opens the week with road games in San Antonio and Indiana before returning home to host the Rockets. Houston opened a four-game road trip with a win in New Orleans on Saturday and has a two-game series in OKC before concluding the trip in Memphis on Thursday. The Rockets have gone 6-3 since trading former franchise-star James Harden. Christian Wood (25 ppg, 12.3 rpg, 58.8 FG%, 51.7 3P%) and newcomer Victor Oladipo (22 ppg, 5 rpg, 5.2 apg) have led the Rockets on offense in Harden\u2019s absence. The Grizzlies were riding a five-game win streak when they had a trio of games postponed due to health and safety protocols. The time off did not slow their momentum as they beat San Antonio by 17 points in their first game in 12 days on Saturday. The key for the Grizzlies has been balance with six players averaging at least 12 points per game during their six-game win streak. Brooklyn Nets (13-9) at Philadelphia 76ers (15-6) 8 p.m. ET, NBA League Pass The top two teams in the Eastern Conference meet for the second time this season. Brooklyn won the first meeting with Philly on Jan. 7 despite not having any member of the Big 3 on the court \u2014 Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant both missed the game, and this game took place prior to the James Harden trade. The Nets are 3-1 when Irving, Durant and Harden share the court. With this game on Saturday, hopefully Harden (thigh contusion) and Joel Embiid (back soreness) will be in the lineup as both missed games this past Sunday. In what could be a potential playoff preview, we want to see both of these teams at full strength to get a real sense of how they match up against one another. When Embiid has been on the court, he\u2019s been an absolute monster, averaging 28.3 points, 11.1 rebounds, 2. 8 assists. 1.2 steals and 1.3 blocks entering Week 7. The Sixers are 14-2 when Embiid plays and 1-4 when he\u2019s out of the lineup. This game also takes place in Philly, as the Sixers own the league\u2019s top home record at 10-1. So far this season, the Nets are just 4-5 outside of Brooklyn. Memphis Grizzlies (8-6) at New Orleans Pelicans (7-11) 9 p.m. ET, NBA League Pass From the NBA League Pass Season First Half Watch Guide : It is a matchup of the top two picks in the 2019 draft \u2014 No. 1 Zion Williamson of New Orleans and No. 2 Ja Morant of Memphis. That order is flipped when it came to Kia Rookie of the Year voting as Morant edged out Williamson after he was limited to just 24 games due to injury. Both players enter the 2020-21 season with a clean bill of health and an ability to create a season-shaking highlight at any given moment."},{"id":485704,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/power-rankings-2020-21-week-7","date":"2021-02-01","title":"Power Rankings, Week 7: Clippers jump Lakers for No. 1 spot; Nuggets enter Top 5","content":"Here we go again \u2026 In the last 21 years (from the 1999-00 season through last season), the Eastern Conference has had a winning record in interconference games only once. That was in the 2008-09 season, when the East went 231-219 (.513) against the West. In each of the last 21 seasons, the West has been better. And we\u2019re almost certainly going to make it 21 of 22. Only 96 (21%) of the 450 interconference games have been played thus far. But the West has already built a big advantage, going 59-37 (.615) through the first six weeks of the season. That would be the West\u2019s fourth-best mark of the last 22 years, and its best since the 2013-14 season (.631). Through January, only six East teams are at or above .500. In the West, there are 10 teams no worse than 9-9. And the discrepancy could get bigger. With the shortened season, the league removed in-conference games, rather than interconference games. In a normal season, interconference games account for 37% of all games played. This season, they account for 42%. So get ready for a lot more. Over the last five weeks of the first-half schedule (between now and March 5), 17 of the league\u2019s 30 teams are scheduled to play more games against the opposite conference than they are against their own. And this week\u2019s schedule features a tasty, TNT double-header on Tuesday: Clippers-Nets and Celtics-Warriors. The Celtics will also visit the Clippers on Friday and the Suns on Sunday.

Suns (10-8) at Mavericks (8-12), 8:30 p.m. ET, NBA TV The Suns lead the season series 2-0 with both games decided by six points or less. So far this season, the Mavericks are 1-4 in games decided by six points or less, while the Suns are 4-6 . The Suns won the opening game of a two-game set on Saturday as they rallied from a 15-point third quarter deficit to finish with a 111-105 win. Chris Paul scored 16 of his 29 points in the fourth quarter to lead the comeback. It was the first time in eight games this season that the Mavericks led by at least 11 points and lost the game. The Suns are 2-2 over their last four games, all of which have been played without Devin Booker as he nurses a hamstring injury. In 14 games with Booker this season, Chris Paul has averaged 13.3 points per game. In the four games without Booker , Paul has increased his scoring to 23.8 ppg \u2013 a 10.5 ppg improvement. The Mavericks enter Monday looking to snap a five-game losing streak \u2013 their longest losing streak since dropping seven straight in March 2019. During the streak, Luka Doncic has averaged a team-high 29.0 points, but Dallas has only two other double-digit scorers as they have averaged 106.2 ppg as a team, which ranks 25th in the league over that stretch. The Suns rank fifth in the league in assist percentage with 64.8% of their baskets being assisted, including 87.3% of their 3-point field goals. Meanwhile, the Mavericks rank 27th in assist percentage at 55.6% as Luka Doncic leads all players with 10.8 field goal attempts per game coming after seven dribbles or more \u2013 this accounts for 52.8% of his shot attempts."},{"id":485717,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/fanduel-dfs-values-of-the-night-monday-feb-1","date":"2021-02-01","title":"FanDuel DFS Values Of The Night: Monday (Feb. 1)","content":"Harrison Barnes (SF \u2013 SAC) : $6,100 at NO  All he does is produce. Barnes has come out of nowhere this season with a revived game that has made him highly valuable in season-long formats as well as a typically-affordable DFS play. Prior to Saturday\u2019s dud, he averaged 22.7 points, 6.7 rebounds and 5.3 assists per game across his last three games. The game environment is too juicy to pass up Barnes at this price. Lonzo Ball (PG \u2013 NO) : $5,700 vs. SAC  He has turned it on in his last two games, averaging better than 38 FD points per contest. Ball doesn\u2019t need to score a lot of points to hit value, as he\u2019s doing it across the board with assists, rebounds, and steals. Jarred Vanderbilt (PF \u2013 MIN) : $5,500 at CLE  Karl-Anthony Towns and Naz Reid will be GTDs tonight, and if one or both are out, there should be additional run available for Vanderbilt. The rookie has impressed this season, and while there have been some ups and downs in his production, he has legitimate 40-point upside at a discounted price. Gary Trent Jr. (SG \u2013 POR) : $5,500 at MIL Trent has become a staple in the Blazers\u2019 starting lineup, and he\u2019s made good on his bevy of minutes, averaging over 31 FD points across his last three games, including a season-high 37.2 Saturday against the Bulls. Tonight\u2019s matchup with the Bucks projects as the highest-scoring game on the slate. Tyrese Haliburton (SG \u2013 SAC) : $5,400 at NO  Both Haliburton and Buddy Hield have been balling over the last couple of weeks, though Hield comes in $1.1K more expensive. I\u2019d rather pay down for Haliburton \u2014 a guy seeing similar minutes who possesses similar upside in a fantastic matchup. Immanuel Quickley (SG \u2013 NYK) : $5,200 at CHI  Quickley has balled out recently, plain and simple. He\u2019s scored at least 33 FD points in three of his last four games and piled up at least 25 real-life points in each of his last two. What\u2019s most encouraging is that he\u2019s averaged just under 24 minutes over the last week after playing sparingly to start the season. As long as he continues to see minutes in this range, Quickley makes a great tournament target. His $5.2K price tag is quite appealing here. Xavier Tillman (PF \u2013 MEM) : $5,100 at SA  Tillman has posted at least 20 FD points in six straight, taking advantage of Jonas Valanciunas\u2018 absence along the way. He\u2019s got a stellar matchup with San Antonio on tap, and Valanciunas will sit this one out. Cam Reddish (SG \u2013 ATL) : $4,600 vs. LAL  With De\u2019Andre Hunter out of the lineup, Reddish should enjoy some additional run and his price is far too low for a guy who is likely to see minutes in the low 30s. Hassan Whiteside (C \u2013 SAC) : $4,000 at NO  Whiteside is a constant risk this season, but there\u2019s reward to be had. He\u2019s seen his minutes trend up over the last week and played 20 in two straight. The per-minute production is what we\u2019re looking for, and at only $4K, he makes a nice pivot in tournaments. I\u2019m not touching him in cash games, though."},{"id":485599,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/aaron-gordon-exits-game-with-ankle-injury-will-be-evaluated","date":"2021-02-01","title":"Aaron Gordon exits game with ankle injury, will be evaluated","content":"After this third-quarter play, the Magic await further information on one of their top players.

Herro is listed as questionable on the team\u2019s injury report for Monday\u2019s game against the Charlotte Hornets, that announcement coming Sunday afternoon \u2014 less than 24 hours after Herro learned of the positive test and his potential exposure. The reason the Heat cited for having Herro on the report is the NBA\u2019s health and safety protocols, which only means it is a virus-related reason and does not suggest that he tested positive. Herro was not with the team for practice Sunday. Miami \u2014 off to a 7-12 start after going to the NBA Finals last season \u2014 has already had eight players miss a combined 30 games for virus-related reasons, including a 10-game absence for All-Star forward Jimmy Butler. If Herro cannot play Monday, he\u2019d become the ninth Heat player on that list. \u201cBy any means necessary right now,\u201d Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been through so much. I think everybody is able to adapt to this. This is what\u2019s required right now.\u201d Not long after Miami beat Sacramento 105-104 to snap a five-game losing streak Saturday night, Herro publicly stated that someone living in his home had just tested positive. Herro is tested daily and obviously had not tested positive Saturday, since the NBA and Heat permitted him to be on the floor; he played a team-high 40 minutes and scored 15 points. But even being around someone who has the virus sets the NBA\u2019s contact-tracing wheels into motion, to determine if Herro could have been exposed. That investigation will determine if Herro \u2014 who had the virus last season, before the NBA\u2019s restart bubble at Walt Disney World was launched \u2014 will have to quarantine and if so, for how long. Such absences have typically been about a week, some a bit shorter. \u201cWe all know how crazy this time is going,\u201d Herro said Saturday. \u201cSomeone who lives with me tested positive before the game and I found out at halftime. I don\u2019t know; hopefully, I don\u2019t have to quarantine. It\u2019s just crazy what\u2019s going on. It\u2019s crazy.\u201d Herro is averaging 17.5 points this season. He missed seven games in January because of neck spasms. Butler returned from his virus-related hiatus with a season-high 30 points, the last two of them coming with 42.1 seconds left in Saturday\u2019s win. Part of the NBA probe into Herro\u2019s situation will determine if he is a close contact, as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That would mean he would have been within 6 feet of an infected person \u201cfor a cumulative total of 15 minutes or more over a 24-hour period\u201d in the past two days. The Heat could get three guards back on Monday. Kendrick Nunn didn\u2019t play Saturday; he wasn\u2019t cleared by game time while awaiting the results of a COVID-19 test, though he did get the negative result back during the game. Avery Bradley (knee) and Goran Dragic (groin) also may be able to return from injuries. \u201cEver since the pandemic hit, everything\u2019s been kind of in the air,\u201d Nunn said. \u201cYou take every day for what it is. Adversity \u2026 things happen.\u201d Miami has used 14 starting lineups in its first 19 days, because of all its virus and injury issues. If Herro can\u2019t play Monday, a 15th lineup would seem possible. \u201cWe\u2019re living with the punches right now,\u201d Heat center Bam Adebayo said.

So far, it\u2019s been like pulling on a slot machine and seeing the cherries, bars and bells line up rather randomly. The latest iteration of the trio \u2014 Durant and Harden in Brooklyn, Westbrook in Washington \u2014 would have played out Sunday night ( 7 p.m. ET, NBA TV ), when the Nets and Wizards meet at D.C.\u2019s Capitol One Arena. But Harden is out with a left thigh contusion. It would have been the first time, aside from All-Star Games, that all three were on the court together in a legit NBA game in nearly five years. Since April 3, 2016, to be exact, a 118-110 Houston victory when Harden\u2019s Rockets were settling into an eighth seed while Durant and Westbrook were in OKC futilely chasing the 73-9 Golden State Warriors. Durant did hit the jackpot twice after that, winning championships with the pedigreed Warriors in 2017 and 2018 after making one of the league\u2019s most opportunistic \u2014 some would say mercenary \u2014 moves ever. Joining Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, coach Steve Kerr and the league\u2019s most committed front office made Finals success more of a foregone conclusion than a competitive question those two years (and only injuries may have derailed a third). As teammates, though, the trio and then a couple of tandems still haven\u2019t won it all. The bandit has given back smaller payouts \u2014 27 total All-Star selections, 25 All-NBA berths, 12 scoring titles, three assist titles, four All-Star MVPs and one regular-season MVP for each of them. As teammates, the trio was together for three years in OKC, reaching the Finals against Miami in 2012. Then Harden was off to Houston, when the Thunder flinched on the prospect of paying three maximum-salary contracts. That left Durant and Westbrook to twice get the Thunder to the West finals over the next four years. Harden led the Rockets that far once, establishing himself as the franchise player few saw when he understudied the other two in OKC. During their time together, Harden started only seven of 220 games, averaging 12.7 points, 3.4 rebounds and 2.5 assists. He was voted the league\u2019s Sixth Man Award in 2012. But since he left, his production has ballooned to 29.5 ppg, 6.0 rpg and 7.8 apg. For three seasons \u2014 2016-17 to 2018-19 \u2014 they were scattered, each on a different team. Westbrook racked up the most loyalty points in fans\u2019 eyes, sticking 11 years with the Thunder as another All-Star, Paul George, came and went. Six days after George was traded to the Clippers in July 2019, Westbrook sought and got a trade, too \u2014 joining Harden in Houston. The results were mixed. The Rockets finished 44-28 in the pandemic-interrupted season, with Harden averaging 34.3 points to Westbrook\u2019s 27.2. But they got bounced in five games in the West semifinals against the Lakers, with the pair combining for 12 fewer points in the series than in the regular season. They had 61 assists but 44 turnovers in the five games. (And by the way, they never played against Durant, who was out last season rehabbing from right Achilles surgery.) Westbrook got traded again, swapped to Washington in December for point guard John Wall and a 2023 first-round pick. Then it was Harden\u2019s turn to move again, a relocation he requested, when Houston three weeks ago shipped him to Brooklyn in a blockbuster four-team deal. Where does that leave everyone as they finally meet again? Durant and Harden are thriving with the Nets, the former earning MVP consideration and the latter racking up triple-double highlights. Westbrook? Not so much. His four triple-doubles in his first four Wizards appearances had an \u201cempty stats\u201d feel as Washington dropped all four games. And his overall play is stirring doubts about limitations in his game at age 32, his $41.3 salary this season and the $97.2 million he has guaranteed through 2022-23 season. Westbrook\u2019s 18.9 ppg scoring average is his lowest in a decade. His 38.1 field-goal percentage is the worst of his 14 NBA seasons. He\u2019s hitting 33.3 of his 3-pointers, which makes his accuracy on 2-pointers \u2014 39.7% \u2014 especially atrocious. At 18.1 field goal attempts per game, he is shooting more often than LeBron James, Nikola Jokic and Joel Embiid, MVP candidates enjoying stellar seasons. Meanwhile, his free throw attempts (5.5 per game) are his fewest since his second year and about half what they were just four years ago, when he got to the line 10.4 times nightly. Westbrook ranks 11th in drives with 16.0 per game, according to NBA.com stats . But that\u2019s a drop from last season, when the led the NBA with 20.8 while playing alongside Harden. As intense as Westbrook is on the floor on any given night, he went at it verbally with Wall on Tuesday in Houston. Then he got ejected against Atlanta with his team down by 18 in the fourth quarter Friday, after getting chippy with Hawks guard Rajon Rondo. Some of Westbrook\u2019s dip can be attributed to his and the team\u2019s hiccups. He has been coping with a left quad muscle injury, on top of a dislocated ring finger on his right hand that is said to have healed. The Wizards also went 13 days without playing and are tied for the dubious league lead with six postponed games so far this season. Coach Scott Brooks \u2014 another OKC connection to Sunday night\u2019s game, along with Nets forward Jeff Green \u2014 believes that Westbrook will find his rhythm with his new team, alongside scoring star Bradley Beal, when he can get on the floor more consistently. \u201cHe\u2019s gonna play better,\u201d Brooks has said. And he had better, as the 3-12 Wizards schedule gets tougher in February. All three former Thunder pals are in the East now, vying for the same things, Durant and Harden out in front with Westbrook far behind. If all goes right for Brooklyn this season, Durant and Harden could be the first combination of the trio to deliver on the goal they set for themselves when they became teammates in 2009 \u2014 win a championship. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Joel Embiid (PHI) $9,900: Embiid might be the best bet for 50 FanDuel points on this slate, and we\u2019ll discuss that more in the next section. Andre Drummond (CLE) $9,000: Drummond has seen limited minutes, but he has too much upside to fade at this price. We\u2019ll discuss that more later. Collin Sexton (CLE) $7,100: Sexton is averaging 36 FD points per game since returning from injury, and it\u2019s hard to overlook that against one of the worst defenses in the NBA. D\u2019Angelo Russell (MIN) $7,500: Russell has a usage rate north of 30 percent with Towns off the floor this season. That has led to him averaging 38 FD points per game across his last 10 outings. Naz Reid (MIN) $6,300: Reid has been starting for Karl-Anthony Towns and has been fantastic in his absence. In fact, Naz has scored at least 27 FanDuel points in seven of his nine starts this season. Aaron Gordon (ORL) $5,500: Gordon has been playing a lot of point guard for the Magic, and it\u2019s led to one of the best stretches of his career. Over his last 13 games, AG is averaging 14.7 points, 7.8 rebounds, and 5.5 assists per game. We can\u2019t ask for any more out of a player south of $6K. Jeremy Lamb (IND) $5,400: Lamb has been a pleasant surprise off of his injury, averaging 26 FD points per game across 27 minutes of action since his debut. That\u2019s all you can ask for from a sub-$6K player. Darius Garland (CLE) $5,200: Garland is easily my favorite value play of the day. The sophomore guard saw a limited workload after an injury but has been astounding aside from that. If you take out the four games he was limited, Garland is averaging 34 FanDuel points per game across 34 minutes a night. That\u2019s ridiculous from someone this cheap, especially against a 29th-ranked T\u2019Wolves defense. DeAndre Jordan (BKN) $4,900: DJ is one of the best values at the center position. Since they traded Jarrett Allen, Jordan is averaging 26 FD points per game across his last seven outings. We obviously love that against the worst defense in basketball."},{"id":485214,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nba-league-pass-spotlight-sixers-at-pacers","date":"2021-01-31","title":"NBA League Pass Spotlight: Sixers at Pacers","content":"Sunday features a four-game slate on NBA League Pass highlighted by a matchup between two of the top teams in the Eastern Conference \u2013 the Philadelphia 76ers at the Indiana Pacers. Here are five things to watch when the game tips off at 7:00 p.m. ET on NBA League Pass. 1. Joel Embiid Playing Like an MVP The reigning Eastern Conference Player of the Week is among the Kia MVP favorites as the 2020-21 season rounds the quarter pole. Embiid is one of just two players to rank in the top 10 in both scoring (4th) and rebounding (8th) this season; the other is two-time reigning MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo. Appearing in 16 of Philly\u2019s first 20 games, Embiid is averaging a career-high 28.3 points as well as 11.1 rebounds, 2.8 assists, 1.2 steals and 1.3 blocks. Here is the list of players that have averages those numbers or better for a season: Charles Barkley in 1987-88 and Bob McAdoo in 1975-76. Embiid isn\u2019t just averaging a career-best 28.3 ppg, he\u2019s also scoring more efficiently than he has in any of his previous four seasons. Embiid is shooting career-best percentages from the field (54.4%), from three (40.4%) and the free throw line (84.0%). And as good as Embiid has been all season long, he has been on fire over his past five games, upping his scoring average to 35.6 ppg and shooting 56% from the field and 42.9% from three. 2. The Embiid vs. Turner Matchup The key matchup to watch in this game will be between Joel Embiid and Myles Turner. Embiid is a top-five scorer in the league, who gets his points all over the court. He leads the NBA with 9.6 points per game on post-ups as he excels on the block and the high post. He can bully an opponent in the paint or face up and shoot a mid-range jumper over them. He gets out in transition and has extended range out to the 3-point line, where he\u2019s shooting over 40%. The task of defending Embiid, trying to slow him down and make him work for his points, and doing so without fouling is a gargantuan task. And one that the Pacers were unable to complete last season when Embiid averaged 36.5 ppg on 60.5% shooting and 16.0 rpg in two games against them. In Turner, the Pacers have the league\u2019s top shot blocker (4.1 bpg) and top rim protector (41.7% shooting allowed at the basket) so far this season. Can Turner replicate those numbers against Embiid, who got the better of Turner last season? Turner was plagued with foul trouble in both matchups with Embiid in 2019-20; he finished with five fouls in 29 minutes in the first meeting (Turner 3 pts, 3 reb, 1-8 FG; Embiid 32 pts, 11 reb) and fouled out in 20 minutes in the second meeting (Turner 9 pts, 2 reb, 2 blk; Embiid 41 pts, 21 reb, 3 blk). The head-to-head matchup data shows that Embiid scored 23 points in 9:06 of total matchup time against Turner over the two games. Embiid shot 6-11 from the field and drew six shooting fouls, which led to 11-12 shooting from the foul line. 3. Pacers Sharing the Rock Keep an eye on the Pacers ball movement as they have been one of the top teams in creating shots for one another with the pass. The Pacers are tied for fourth in assists per game (26.8) and rank sixth in assist percentage as 62.9% of their baskets come off an assist. Indiana ranks third in the league in points created by assists (69.9 per game, which equals 61.7% of their total points). There are two keys to the Pacers playmaking. First, despite ranking fourth in total passes made (304.8 per game), the Pacers only turn the ball over 12.7 times per game, which is tied for the fifth-lowest average in the league. Indiana\u2019s 1.95 assist\/turnover ratio is the second-highest in the league, trailing only San Antonio. The second key is that they have multiple players dishing out assists as opposed to one player dominating the category. The Pacers are tied for fourth in assists per game, but their leader in assists \u2013 Malcolm Brogdon \u2013 ranks 9th among all players with his 7.2 apg. The Pacers are the only team with three players ranked in the top 25 in assists as Domantas Sabonis and TJ McConnell each average 5.8 assists per game. 4. Can Sixers Break Through Away from Philly? At 10-1, the Sixers have the best home record of any team in the NBA; earlier this week they became the first team to hand the Lakers a road loss after they opened season with 10 straight road wins. But the Sixers have been a different team on the road, where they are just 4-5 on the season. The Sixers are shooting five percentage points lower from the field (49.6% at home, 44.6% on road) and four percentage points lower from three (38.1% at home, 34.1% on road). The Sixers\u2019 assists drop by 6.5 per game, their free throw attempts drop by 2.6 per game, and their steals drop by 2.2 per game when they play away from Philadelphia. This was a similar theme from the Sixers last season before the league relocated to the Orlando campus for the restart. In the first 65 games of the season, the Sixers were a league-best 29-2 at home and just 10-24 on the road. The Sixers enter Sunday with the top record in the Eastern Conference and have aspirations of a deep playoff run and their first trip to the Finals in 20 years. In order to get there, the Sixers will have to improve on the road. 5. Who Delivers with Game on the Line? Three of the four matchups between the Sixers and Pacers last season were decided by six points or fewer. If the past is any indicator, we may be in store for a close game on Sunday, which begs the question of which teams and players will deliver in the clutch. So far this season, the Sixers are an NBA-best 8-1 in games with clutch time \u2013 score within five points in the final five minutes \u2013 outscoring their opponents by 29 points over 37 clutch minutes. The Sixers haven\u2019t shot particularly well in the clutch, but their defense has been great with 12 blocks, 9 steals and an 86.6 defensive rating. The Pacers have gone 6-5 in clutch games this season; they have been outscored by a total of three points in 52 clutch minutes, which are the fourth-most clutch minutes of any team in the league. Malcolm Brogdon has been the Pacers\u2019 leading scorer in clutch situations with 28 points on 37.0% shooting from the field, 40% from three and has also dished out 11 assists while playing all 52 clutch minutes. Embiid has been the leading scorer for Philly in clutch moments; he has 36 points on 45.5% shooting from the field, as well as four of Philly\u2019s dozen blocks in 26 clutch minutes."},{"id":485184,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/marcus-smart-slated-for-mri-on-injured-leg","date":"2021-01-31","title":"Marcus Smart to miss 2-3 weeks with calf injury","content":"An MRI on Boston Celtics guard Marcus Smart revealed a \u201cGrade I tear\u201d in his left calf and he is expected to miss 2-3 weeks, according to an injury update from the team. Smart underwent the MRI on Sunday morning to determine the severity of the injury he suffered late in Saturday\u2019s 96-95 loss to the Los Angeles Lakers. The Celtics played the final 10:28 without Smart, who was helped off the court with what the team said was a left calf strain following a collision with Lakers forward Montrezl Harrell underneath the basket. Harrell tipped in a missed layup and stepped on Smart\u2019s foot as he came down. Smart crumpled to the court. He was helped to his feet but couldn\u2019t put any pressure on his leg as trainers carried him to the locker room. The Lakers surged following the injury, with LeBron James putting the Lakers ahead on a 3-pointer with 5:25 to play. Smart\u2019s injury was the latest blow to a Boston lineup that was playing with its projected starting lineup of Smart, Kemba Walker, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown and Daniel Theis for just the second time this season. Walker missed the first 12 games of the season recovering from a procedure on his left knee and Tatum missed multiple games earlier this month with COVID-19. \u2014 The Associated Press contributed to this report."},{"id":485061,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/10-takeaways-as-lakers-edge-celtics-in-early-season-clash","date":"2021-01-31","title":"10 takeaways as Lakers edge Celtics in early-season clash","content":"The outcome wasn\u2019t decided until the last tick, when a step-back jumper by Kemba Walker fell in favor of the Lakers and not inside the bucket for the Celtics. What more could anyone want from a pair of teams who, whenever they get together, usually deliver something entertaining, if not memorable? Saturday\u2019s Celtics-Lakers matchup had a national network TV audience but not a packed house at TD Garden, which it deserved. Well, whatever: Flashes of brilliance by LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown carried the night, which eventually belonged to the Lakers , but not until the last breath and just by a hair, 96-95. Here are 10 observations and takeaways from the latest result of a deep and rich rivalry: We\u2019re officially on Marcus Smart watch.  Is it just a left calf strain, which was the initial diagnosis? Or something more sinister? Anyway: It was an unsettling moment when Smart landed strangely going for a rebound early in the fourth. It was a non-contact incident, which often prove the most dangerous, and he had to be helped off the floor. Any lengthy injury, or a serious one, would be costly for Boston, because he\u2019s a valued playmaker and clearly their best defender and also because \u2026 Gordon Hayward is in Charlotte.  Remember just a few months ago when Hayward bolted for the Hornets and all those riches? Anyone who thought the Celtics would be just fine without him really didn\u2019t see the big picture too clearly. Hayward was an asset, and he provided depth at the swing positions, and that stability was crucial in times like this. The Lakers\u2019 long trip winds down.  The long 7-game road trip finally ends Monday in Atlanta, and all things considered, it\u2019s been decent for L.A. True, the Lakers did lose two straight games, but such happens during the course of a regular season, even to championship contenders. Winning in Boston was one of those bounce-back checkpoints that strong teams need, and the Lakers showed their mettle, especially in the final tense moments.  Jayson Tatum\u2019s 30 points led Boston on Saturday. Jayson Tatum takes it away.  The growth of a solid star continues this season, with Tatum showing a thirst for showing up in the clutch. His pair of mid-range baskets in the final few minutes rescued the Celtics just when it seemed L.A. had pulled away for good. Unfortunately for the Celtics, the ball didn\u2019t find Tatum in the final seconds, though Walker did have a good look. Tatum finished with 30 points and once again was a dangerous tandem with \u2026 Jaylen Brown, looking like an All-Star.  With 28 points against the Lakers, he now has 10 straight games with 20-plus points. No question, Brown is off to an impressive start and will undoubtedly get his first All-Star honors. However, he\u2019d like to have those two missed free throws back with the Celtics down four with two minutes left. LeBron just. keeps. coming. Once again, with 21-7-7, another solid display from LeBron, and the reason this deserves mention is because they\u2019re taken for granted, even this deep into his career, here in Season 18. Celtics coach Brad Stevens said: \u201cI think I\u2019ve learned not to doubt the greats of all time. There aren\u2019t many guys like him that can play this well this late. But there weren\u2019t many like him before.\u201d Tatum threw a spectacular, no-look, behind-the-back pass in transition. That Pass.  It was a highly entertaining six seconds that awakened the game in the third quarter. Actually, it was two passes \u2014 two behind-the-back passes \u2013 that made it possible. LeBron threw behind the back to Anthony Davis, but it was errant, and Tatum grabbed the loose ball. But Tatum\u2019s momentum was pushing him out of bounds. So, he threw the no-look behind-the-back and caught a streaking Robert Williams III perfectly in stride for a dunk. The post-script to this play? It was Williams who finished it. Last fall, the Celtics signed Tristan Thompson to be their blue-collar big man next to Daniel Theis, and this was seen as a vote of low confidence for Williams, who after two seasons should\u2019ve been ready for that role and those minutes. Instead, he\u2019s playing behind Theis and Thompson, at least at the moment. Boston would like to see more consistency from the 23-year-old before giving him a larger role and responsibility. Kemba Walker, ice cold all evening.  He was 1-for-12 shooting and for the Celtics\u2019 sake, they\u2019d better hope it was simply rust from missing the first 11 games with a problematic knee. The good news is: there\u2019s no pain issue in a knee that made Walker a spectator early. The other issue? There\u2019s still inconsistency, mainly with his 3-point shooting. That\u2019s currently at its lowest percentage in six years, ever since Walker made a big improvement in that area. Saturday was only his sixth game of the year, so there\u2019s time. If Walker can join Brown and Tatum as a feared option on offense, Boston will bring a set of weapons that will produce big dividends come playoff time. About the 1-for-12, Stevens said: \u201cIt just wasn\u2019t his night. But more often than not, it is his night, and we believe strongly in that.\u201d Davis: \u2018We for sure weren\u2019t losing three in a row.\u2019 Anthony Davis\u2019 phantom falloff.  At 22 points per game, this is his lowest scoring average in six years and a four-point drop from last season. His rebounds, blocks and steals \u2014 all down. And with the exception of a sprinkling of games, most notably his 37-point homecoming in Chicago last week, AD\u2019s impact has been scattered. Is Davis having a down season \u2014 for him? Sure, that\u2019s a question that could be asked. And so can this question: Does it really matter? Well, three things: 1) This is such a small sample size, and the Lakers are winning, and this is the regular season; 2) It seems a bit of a stretch to be even mildly concerned about a player who remains in his prime, isn\u2019t injured and, just maybe, is wisely pacing himself for the long haul; 3) With the exception of losing the ball in the final 15 seconds that was nearly costly, he was impressive against the Celtics, with 27 points (18 in the first half) and 14 rebounds. Bench splinters for Wesley Matthews.  He racked up his first DNP-CD (did not play, coach\u2019s decision) of the season, as coach Frank Vogel continues to sift through a rather deep roster in a quest to settle on a regular nine-man group. Matthews is exclusively a 3-point shooter \u2014 he offers little else offensively \u2014 and that may not be enough to keep him in the rotation, especially since he\u2019s not getting volume looks. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

McCollum. Having squandered a 19-point lead, defeat was staring them in the face as Coby White\u2019s free throws gave the Bulls a 122-117 advantage with 11.5 remaining. Enter Damian Lillard. GAME SITUATION: With 38 points to that point, Lillard quickly splashed a 37-footer with 8.2 seconds left to cut the deficit to two. The Blazers then trapped Zach LaVine in the corner on the ensuing inbound pass, forcing a jump ball. Gary Trent Jr. managed to fumble the loose ball over to Lillard after the jump, where he picked it up, dribbled back behind the line just above the right break and sank a drifting, fading 3 over Lauri Markkanen as the horn sounded. DIFFICULTY: Insane. We\u2019ve seen this type of skill and game awareness from Lillard many times before. But that doesn\u2019t make it any less remarkable as he finished with a Reggie Miller-esque six points in 8.2 seconds to burnish his legend as one of the decade\u2019s best clutch shot-makers. CELEBRATION: The usual swarm-the-dude-who-won-the-game scrum. The real fun came in the locker room after Lillard finished up his courtside interviews, where the Blazers showed their obvious affection for their team leader with an exuberant ice-water shower.

Ahead of their first meeting of the season, we look closer at the rivalry and the significance of the number 18 in this matchup. Chasing Championship No. 18 When the Lakers defeated the Miami Heat in the 2020 NBA Finals, they clinched their 17th NBA championship, tying them with the Celtics for the most titles in league history. The race for championship No. 18 is on with both the Lakers and Celtics considered among the contenders for the 2020-21 championship. The defending champion Lakers were favored by the league\u2019s GMs to repeat as champions, while the Celtics are looking to reach The Finals after being eliminated in the Eastern Conference Finals in three of the past four seasons. Forty-one of the NBA\u2019s 74 championship series have featured either the Lakers, the Celtics or both teams. The Lakers have the most Finals appearances in history at 32, followed by the Celtics at 21, and the two have met with the championship on the line 12 times. The Celtics hold a 9-3 edge in head-to-head meetings in the Finals, but L.A. won the most recent meeting in 2010. LeBron In Season No. 18 While the rivalry between the Lakers and Celtics remains strong, the rivalry between LeBron James and Father Time has been dominated by LeBron, who continues to play at an MVP level in his 18 th season in the NBA. LeBron enters Saturday averaging 25.5 points, 7.8 rebounds and 7.5 assists. He joins Nikola Jokic and Luka Doncic as the only players in the league to average at least 25-7-7 so far this season. Luka is 21 years old and in his third NBA season; Jokic is 25 in his sixth season; LeBron is 36 and performing at a level never seen before by a player in season No. 18. Kobe Bryant (22.3 ppg in 2014-15) and Karl Malone (20.6 ppg, in 2002-03) are the only other players in league history to average at least 20 points in their 18 th season or later. LeBron is on pace to average at least 25 points for his 17 th consecutive season. Five players have averaged at least seven rebounds in their 18 th season or later \u2013 Tim Duncan (2x), Karl Malone (2x), Kevin Garnett, Robert Parish and Moses Malone. Of that group, only Malone averaged at least 20 points in the same season. John Stockton (7.7 apg in 2002-03, 8.2 apg in 2001-02) is the only other player to average at least seven assists in his 18 th season or later. Reaching any one of these three marks in season 18 puts you in rare and elite company. For LeBron to do all three in season 18 leaves him no company at all. At 36, LeBron has a chance to become the oldest player to ever win MVP honors, eclipsing Malone, who won the 1998-99 MVP at the age of 35. In that season, Malone averaged 23.8 points (3rd in NBA), 9.4 rebounds (14th), and 4.1 assists (32nd) in 37.4 minutes per game and led the Jazz to a 37-13 record (tied with San Antonio for the league\u2019s top record) during the lockout-shortened season. Through 20 games so far this season, LeBron ranks 15 th in scoring, 27 th in rebounding and 7 th in assists while playing a career-low 33.1 minutes per game. LeBron is also shooting a career-best 41.7% from beyond the arc on a career-high 6.6 3-point attempts per game. Celtics Game No. 18 This is Boston\u2019s 18th game of the season, but just the second with the trio of Kemba Walker, Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown sharing the court together. Walker missed nearly the entire first month of the season following offseason knee surgery before returning to the court on Jan. 17. In five games back, the four-time All-Star has averaged 16.4 points, 4.2 assists, 2.6 rebounds and 2.0 steals in 24.2 minutes per game. Walker\u2019s return came in the middle of a two-week absence for All-Star wing Jayson Tatum after he tested positive for COVID-19 in early January. Tatum made his return on Jan. 25, which came on the second night of a back-to-back for the Celtics, so Walker was held out as the Celtics manage his workload. On Wednesday, the trio took the court together for the first time this season as they faced the Spurs in San Antonio. Tatum scored a game-high 25 points, Brown added 24, and Walker had 14, but it was not enough as the Spurs held on for a 110-106 win. \u201cIt\u2019s been an interesting season,\u201d Brown said following the game. \u201cWe\u2019ve had guys out, guys hurt. We are just trying to put everything together. Tonight wasn\u2019t our best night.\u201d Dynamic Scoring Duos While players have been in and out of the Celtics lineup, Brown has been the constant. He\u2019s played in all 17 games and is having a breakout season, scoring 27.1 points per game (8th in NBA), shooting 52.2% from the field and 44.1% from 3. Brown has scored at least 18 points in every game this season and has set and tied his career high with two 42-point games in the past month. While it was Walker and Tatum that represented the Celtics at the 2020 NBA All-Star Game, Brown is on track to add the All-Star accolade to his resume in 2021. Not far behind Brown in scoring is Tatum at 26.5 ppg, which ranks 12 th in the league and represents a career high for the fourth-year pro. Brown and Tatum are the third-highest scoring duo in the league at 53.6 combined points per game, with the top three duos each having both players averaging at least 25 ppg. The Lakers duo of James and Anthony Davis ranks ninth at 47.4 combined ppg. Since Tatum and Brown became teammates, the Celtics are 26-8 (+18 wins) when both players score 20 in the same game. Since Davis and James became teammates, the Lakers have won 18 of the 21 games in which both players scored at least 25 points. One of those Lakers wins came in the last meeting between these teams on Feb. 23, 2020 as Davis scored 32 points and LeBron score 29 to lead the Lakers to a 114-112 win . On the other end, both Tatum (41) and Brown finished with at least 20 points, but came away with the loss as both dynamic duos combined to score 61 points. Rivalry History \u2013 Celtics Once Won 18 Straight We touched on the Finals history between these two franchises earlier, but the rivalry dates back to 1948 when the Minneapolis Lakers and Boston Celtics first met on Nov. 9, 1948. Since then, the two teams have met 292 times in the regular season, with the Celtics holding a 161-131 advantage all-time. The Celtics dominated this rivalry in the first three-plus decades of the NBA. From their first meeting in 1948 until the end of the 1978-79 season, the Celtics went 127-85 against the Lakers, including winning 18 games in a row from Nov. 6, 1957 to March 3, 1959. However, the rivalry and the league changed significantly beginning in the 1979-80 season. Not only did that season add two of this rivalry\u2019s biggest stars in Larry Bird and Magic Johnson, the league also adopted the 3-point line and adjusted the schedule to emphasize divisional matchup, meaning the Lakers and Celtics from opposing conference would only meet twice per season as opposed to more than five games per season as they had done for years in the 1950s, \u201860s and \u201870s. While the Celtics dominated the early decades of this rivalry \u2013 and the rest of the NBA, for that matter, with a run of 11 championships in 13 seasons \u2013 the Lakers have tilted the scales the other way since the 1980s. Over the past 40 seasons, the Lakers own a 46-34 advantage in head-to-head meetings during the regular season, and a 3-2 advantage when the teams have met in the Finals."},{"id":484652,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/tune-in-tidbits-abc-saturday-primetime-jan-30-2021","date":"2021-01-30","title":"Tune-In Tidbits: ABC Saturday Primetime, Jan. 30, 2021","content":"The Lakers and Celtics square off in the first ABC Saturday Primetime of the season (8:30 p.m. ET). Here are five key stats to know about the matchup. \u2022 The Celtics enter Saturday with two of the top 12 scorers in the league in Jaylen Brown (27.1 ppg, 8th) and Jayson Tatum (26.5 ppg, 12th). They will face a Lakers team with the league\u2019s top defensive rating (105.0) and allows the 4th-lowest effective field goal percentage (51.1%). \u2022 A key part of the Lakers\u2019 defensive success is limiting 3-point attempts and 3-point percentage . The Lakers have held teams to 34.3% shooting on 32.2 3-point attempts per game, ranking 3rd and 6th in the league, respectively. \u2022 Over the past five games , LeBron James is averaging 30.6 points, 7.6 rebounds and 7.4 assists while shooting 53.7% from the field and 52.8% from beyond the arc. Through the first 20 games of the season, LeBron is averaging career highs in both 3-point attempts (6.6 per game) and 3-point percentage (41.7%). \u2022 The Celtics average 19.6 points off turnovers per game (5th in NBA), partially due to their 9.1 steals per game (T-3rd in NBA) and 17.3 deflections (T-4th in NBA). Jayson Tatum (5.3 ppg) and Jaylen Brown (4.5 ppg) rank 2nd and 6th, respectively, in player points off turnovers . \u2022 After opening the season with 10 straight road wins, the Lakers have lost back-to-back road games in Philadelphia and Detroit before heading to Boston for Saturday\u2019s game.

Over his last three games in which Booker missed, Crowder has produced 18 points and 7.6 rebounds while seeing his usage rate climb to 20.3%. Things should be more of the same with Booker already ruled out of Saturday\u2019s tilt against the Mavericks. Dallas is also playing on the second night of a back-to-back set, which indicates that their middle-of-the-pack defense could be lacking. Remarkably, Crowder remains under $6,000 after averaging 34.2 FanDuel points over his last three games, so he appears to be a lock for 6x value once again on Saturday. Keldon Johnson (SF \u2013 SA) : $5,700 Johnson has scored greater than 32.5 FanDuel points in three of his last four games and gets a juicy matchup against a Grizzlies team that hasn\u2019t played in nearly two weeks. On top of that, they are surrendering the second-most FanDuel points to opposing small forwards so far this season, presenting Johnson with plenty of upside on Saturday. Surprisingly, he\u2019s played the most minutes (560) out of every Spurs player this season and sees just over 31 minutes per game, so he should have no problem hitting 6x value in this one. Lonzo Ball (PG \u2013 NO) : $5,400 Amid rumors that he is actively being shopped, Ball made his presence felt with a 27-point, eight-assist outing in Friday\u2019s win over the Bucks. He now gets a Rockets team who just allowed the combination of Damian Lillard, Gary Trent Jr., and Anfernee Simons to combine for 67 points, 10 assists, and 16 threes earlier this week. He does have Nickeil Alexander-Walker breathing down his neck for more playing time, but Ball\u2019s showing on Friday will certainly earn him a big role against the Rockets on Saturday. This game also has the fourth-highest over\/under at 223.5, so there should be plenty of points on the board. Steven Adams (C \u2013 NO) : $5,400 Adams has been unreal as of late, ripping down 14.2 rebounds over his last four games and posting at least 30 FanDuel points in three of his last four. He now gets the Rockets on Saturday, who have given up the eighth-most rebounds and the third-most offensive rebounds per game to opposing teams this season. For whatever reason, his price is over $500 less than his season average, so he\u2019s worth playing on a night when the center position doesn\u2019t have a ton of elite options. Gary Trent Jr. (POR): $5,000 Trent is coming off of a 23-point game in which he drilled seven threes in 37 minutes of action and is averaging 39 minutes over his last two games. He\u2019s knocked down 14 threes over his last three games and is heading into a matchup against the Bulls, which has the highest over\/under on Saturday\u2019s slate. There will be tons of points scored in this one, and Trent is feeling it at the moment. It\u2019s also worth noting that his usage rate over the last four games without CJ McCollum in the lineup is now up to 19%. Tyrese Haliburton (SG \u2013 SAC) : $4,900 Haliburton might be the best value on Saturday\u2019s slate as it\u2019s hard to find a guy averaging 32.8 FanDuel points over his last three games priced below $5,000. Miami has surrendered the most FanDuel points to opposing guards this season and could be without one or both of Tyler Herro and Goran Dragic due to various injuries. The rookie has averaged 11 points, 4.3 rebounds and 6.6 assists over his last three games and just fell four rebounds shy of notching his first-career triple-double on Friday. He\u2019s a lock for 6x value and has the upside to produce even more. Get him in your lineups. Xavier Tillman (PF \u2013 MEM) : $4,600 The rookie power forward was seemingly finding his stride before Memphis was forced to postpone five games due to Health and Safety Protocols. They are set to return to action Saturday against the Spurs, and Tillman should once again see a large role with Jonas Valanciunas ruled out while remaining under protocols. He\u2019s averaged just under 30 FanDuel points and 1.2 FanDuel points per minute over his last three games, while San Antonio is surrendering the second-most FanDuel points to opposing power forwards this season. Thaddeus Young (PF \u2013 CHI) : $4,200 Many people flocked to Daniel Gafford after Wendell Carter Jr.\u2019s injury, and rightfully so. Surprisingly, Young has been the biggest beneficiary of Carter\u2019s absence thus far, and he gets a juicy matchup on Saturday. He\u2019s averaged over 31 FanDuel points across his last five games and fell just one assist and one rebound shy of recording a triple-double in Monday\u2019s loss to the Celtics. In addition to his strong play, Portland has given up the eighth-most FanDuel points to opposing power forwards this season, and as previously mentioned, Saturday\u2019s game has the highest projected over\/under on the slate at 232. Abdel Nader (SF \u2013 PHO) : $3,800 Nader is quietly averaging 22.5 minutes of playing time over his last four games and seeing a 20.8% usage rate with Devin Booker off the court this season. If you are looking for a cheap flier who will likely see less than 5% ownership, Nader is your guy. With Dallas dropping each of their last four games and playing on the second night of a back-to-back set, the hope would be that Phoenix can put the game away early and allow Nader to rack up the points in garbage time. Anfernee Simons (POR): $3,600 Simons is seeing a 24% usage rate in 167 total minutes without CJ McCollum on the floor and is averaging just under 27 minutes over his last three games. As mentioned above, I want to attack this matchup as it has the highest over\/under on the slate, and Simons\u2019 cheap $3,600 price tag allows me to go after some studs in this one as well. It\u2019s nearly unheard of for a guy seeing as much usage as Simons is to be priced under $4,000. As if you needed any more convincing, Chicago is surrendering the sixth-most FanDuel points to opposing guards this season.

He was 89. The university said he died after a short, unspecified illness. He celebrated his birthday last week. Chaney led Temple to 17 NCAA Tournament appearances over 24 seasons, including five NCAA regional finals. Chaney had 741 wins as a college coach. He was twice named national coach of the year and his teams at Temple won six Atlantic 10 conference titles. He became a de facto father to dozens of his players, many coming to Temple from broken homes, violent upbringings and bad schools. He often said his biggest goal was simply to give poor kids a chance to get an education. \u201cCoach Chaney was like a father to me,\u201d said Temple coach Aaron McKie, who played for Chaney. \u201cHe taught not just me, but all of his players more than just how to succeed in basketball. He taught us life lessons to make us better individuals off the court. I owe so much to him. He made me the man I am today.\u201d Chaney was an imposing presence on the court \u2014 restless, cranky, his otherwise natty clothes in shambles by the end of the game. Often, as he exhorted his team, he put himself in situations he later regretted. He was known for a fiery temper \u2014 sending a player into a 2005 game to commit hard fouls. Chaney served a suspension and apologized. In 1994, he had a heated exchange following a game against UMass in which he threatened to kill coach John Calipari. Chaney apologized and was suspended for a game. The two later became friends. In 1984, Chaney grabbed George Washington coach Gerry Gimelstob by the shoulders at halftime during a game. Chaney, whose deep eyes seemed fitting for a school whose mascot is the Owl, was intense on the sidelines. After an especially bad call, he would stare down referees. He once gazed at a referee for an entire timeout with a look he dubbed the \u201cOne-Eyed Jack.\u201d His loud, booming voice could be heard across an arena, and his near-perfect designer clothes were in shambles after most games. Though he seemed permanently cranky, especially during games, Chaney was often tender and funny. He loved telling stories. His postgame news conferences were sometimes more entertaining than the games that preceded them. His retirement news conference in March 2006 wasn\u2019t about hoops but about education\u2019s role in helping the poor and disadvantaged. They included amusing anecdotes, pokes at the school administration and playful threats to slap the mayor. After losing to Michigan State in his last trip to the NCAA regional finals, in 2001, he was the same old John Chaney \u2014 with water-filled eyes, wearing a tie torn open at the collar and waxing poetic about another missed chance at the Final Four. \u201cIt is something we all dream about, but very often dreams come up short,\u201d he said. \u201cVery often you don\u2019t realize everything. But you have to realize that the growth you see in youngsters like these is probably the highest accomplishment you can reach.\u201d Temple\u2019s style of play under Chaney\u2019s guidance was never as pretty as that of Duke or North Carolina. Slow, patient and disciplined, his best teams rarely made errors, rarely turned the ball over and always played tough defense. Chaney was simply fearless in all aspects of his work. He refused to load his schedules with easy teams, and instead traveled to hostile courts to play teams supposedly brimming with talent. He was outspoken about the NCAA\u2019s recruiting rules, which he said hurt players trying to improve their standing in life. \u201cJohn Chaney was more than just a Hall of Fame Basketball coach. He was a Hall of Famer in life,\u201d said Chaney\u2019s successor, Fran Dunphy. \u201cHe touched countless lives, including my own.\u201d Chaney arrived at Temple before the 1982-83 season. Perched in one of Philadelphia\u2019s toughest neighborhoods, Temple was the perfect match for a coach who prided himself on helping players turn their basketball skills into college degrees. He was 50 and already had success at Cheyney State University, where he had a record of 225-59 in 10 seasons. He led Cheyney, in suburban Philadelphia, to the 1978 Division II national championship and was named Division II national coach of the year twice. Chaney was born on Jan. 21, 1932, in Jacksonville, Florida. He lived in a neighborhood there called Black Bottom, where, he said, flooding rains would bring in rats. When he was in the ninth grade, his family moved to Philadelphia, where his stepfather got a job at a shipyard. Though known as a Hall of Fame coach, he also was one of the best players ever to come out of Philadelphia. He was the Philadelphia Public League player of the year in 1951 at Benjamin Franklin High School. A graduate of Bethune-Cookman College, he was an NAIA All-American and an NAIA tournament MVP before going pro in 1955 to play with the Harlem Globetrotters. With black players still being discriminated against in the NBA, he spent 1955 to 1966 in the Eastern Pro League with Sunbury and Williamsport, where he was a two-time league MVP."},{"id":484010,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/tune-in-tidbits-espn-friday-jan-29-2021","date":"2021-01-29","title":"Tune-In Tidbits: ESPN Friday, Jan. 29, 2021","content":"Zion Williamson (8.1 per game) and Giannis Antetokounmpo (7.2 per game) rank 1-2 in field goals made inside five feet so far this season. Giannis is shooting 75.2% (115-153) at the basket, which ranks second among the 22 players with at least 100 attempts inside five feet. Williamson is shooting 61.0% (122-200), which ranks 13th in that group. With each team having a dominant force scoring at the basket, rim protection will be paramount in this matchup. The Bucks rank second in rim protection , allowing opponents to shoot 58.5% at the basket. The Pelicans rank 30th, allowing 68.8% shooting at the basket. The Bucks (22.6) and Pelicans (16.5) have both excelled in the first quarter of play, ranking first and second, respectively, in net rating in the game\u2019s first 12 minutes. The second quarter has been a different story for the Pelicans as their net rating drops to minus-19.8 (30th), while the Bucks remain in the top five at 8.7. Giannis Antetokounmpo is drawing a career-best 10.1 f ree throw attempts per game (3rd in NBA), but is shooing a career-low 58.4% from the free throw line so far this season. Brandon Ingram enters Friday coming off back-to-back 30-point games ; if he reaches 30 tonight it would be the first time in his career with three straight 30-point games. He is shooting 59.0% from the field, 47.4% from three and 100% from the free throw line over the past two games . The Jazz enter Friday riding a 10-game win streak; it is their longest win streak since winning 11 straight from Jan. 24 to Feb. 14, 2018. Utah\u2019s longest win streak is 15 games, which they achieved twice (Nov. 13 to Dec, 10, 1996 and March 12 to April 11, 1997). The Jazz earned win No. 10 of the streak (and may have to try to reach No. 11) without Donovan Mitchell, who is currently in concussion protocol. Without Mitchell against Dallas on Wednesday, Rudy Gobert was dominant with 29 points, 20 rebounds, three steals and three blocks. Andre Drummond is the only other player in the last 15 years to reach those numbers in a game. During the win streak, Utah is averaging 116.7 points (3rd in NBA over this stretch), 18.4 3-pointers made (1st) and is shooting 41.9% from beyond the arc (2nd). Utah\u2019s average margin of victory during the streak is 15.3 points, and they have only one game decided by single digits . Luka Doncic not only leads the NBA in triple-doubles this season with six, he is close to averaging a triple-double through 17 games with 27.4 ppg, 9.4 rpg and 9.7 apg. Doncic is tied with Ben Simmons and John Havlicek for 13th place all-time with 31 career triple-doubles. Doncic made the climb in just 150 career games, while Simmons has played 234 and Havlicek player 1,270 in his career.

Powell has started four straight and scored at least 20 points and 30 FD points in each of those contests (including at least 40 in each of his last two). Powell is a quality play regardless of who else is in the lineup, but if OG Anunoby (calf) is forced to miss a second straight game, Powell would get another boost. Jordan Clarkson (SG \u2013 UTH): $5,800 vs. DAL Clarkson erupted for a season-high 31 points and 43.4 FD points Wednesday with Donovan Mitchell (concussion) sidelined. If Mitchell, who is questionable again tonight, misses this one, Clarkson should see another boost in minutes and usage, making him a stellar value at this salary. Naz Reid (C \u2013 MIN): $5,800 vs. PHI Reid has been fantastic across his last four games, averaging 15.7 points, 7.2 boards, and 3.0 blocks. He\u2019s finally started turning it on after a slow start to the season, and with Minnesota\u2019s frontcourt still rocked due to injury, expect Reid to have another hefty dose of minutes and usage. His matchup gets even better if Joel Embiid (back) sits. Reggie Jackson (PG \u2013 LAC): $5,800 at ORL It\u2019s yet unknown if Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, or Patrick Beverley will return for the Clippers tonight, but if they\u2019re all out, I\u2019m going back to Reggie yet again. Across his last two games in the starting lineup, he\u2019s posted 82 FD points in 75 minutes. He\u2019s the most reliable option for the shorthanded Clips, and his price is far too low. LaMelo Ball (PG \u2013 CHA): $5,500 vs. IND After a run of massive stat lines to kick off the new year, Ball has cooled off considerably over the last couple of weeks. Make no mistake about it, he\u2019s still got 50-point upside. I\u2019m not going to him in cash lineups, but I\u2019ll certainly get some exposure in tournaments at this rock-bottom price. Al Horford (C \u2013 OKC): $5,500 vs. BKN The line on Thunder\/Nets is as high as 230.5 depending on where you look, and it\u2019s no secret that Brooklyn shies away from playing defense. Horford went off for 49.2 FD points Wednesday after returning from a six-game absence. He\u2019s averaged 28.1 FD points this season, so big games like this will not be the norm. However, his price and this matchup make him an attractive play. Joe Ingles (SF \u2013 UTH): $5,200 vs. DAL Ingles drew his first start of the season Wednesday with Donovan Mitchell out, and the Australian posted a season-best 36.8 FD points. Mitchell\u2019s status is still up in the air, and if he\u2019s ultimately ruled out, Ingles could once again find himself in the starting five. Dwight Howard (C \u2013 PHI): $4,800 at MIN Joel Embiid (back) could be out tonight against the league\u2019s most generous defense to opposing big men. Howard isn\u2019t the same dominant force he was in his heyday, but he\u2019s no scrub. In four starts this season, he\u2019s averaged 8.3 points, 9.0 boards, 1.3 assists, and 1.0 blocks across 24.3 minutes. He posted one double-double in those games, and went for 18 rebounds in another. There\u2019s risk here, but at a sub-$5K price, you\u2019ve got to love the potential. Nickeil Alexander-Walker (SG \u2013 NO): $4,200 vs. MIL Lonzo Ball was forced out of Wednesday\u2019s game early with an ankle injury, and if he sits tonight, expect NAW to see increased run and potentially enter the starting lineup. Despite coming off the bench, he\u2019s eclipsed 25 FD points in three of his past five games. What\u2019s great about those three is that he didn\u2019t reach double-digit scoring in any of them. He\u2019s shown what he can do on offense (37 points against the Clippers on Jan. 13), but NAW can get it done across multiple categories, which is what we like to see in DFS. If Ball is out, Alexander-Walker should be understandably chalky at this ridiculously-low price. Theo Maledon (PG \u2013 OKC): $3,600 vs. BKN Brooklyn is a team to attack for DFS, and tonight is no different. With George Hill (thumb) out again, Maledon should get another start in a great matchup. He posted 22.2 FD points in 29 minutes Wednesday at Phoenix, and he only needs 20.4 tonight to hit 6x value. I\u2019ll definitely have some shares in tournament lineups."},{"id":483943,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/no-magic-formula-to-developing-a-potential-unicorn-like-zion-williamson","date":"2021-01-29","title":"No magic formula to developing a potential 'unicorn' like Zion Williamson","content":"No unicorn before its time. That\u2019s a variation of an old wine commercial , in which legendary actor Orson Welles explained the values of aging and patience before uncorking (or maybe unscrewing) a bottle of Paul Masson\u2019s finest. The same sales pitch might be applied to some of the NBA\u2019s most rare, intriguing players. Such as Zion Williamson, the New Orleans Pelicans\u2019 forward who has been amassing some impressive statistics, strong reviews and pointed criticism, too. So maybe it\u2019s worth recalling a fellow mythical creature who hit the NBA a half dozen years before Williamson and needed some time to develop, too. Frankly, as fine as Milwaukee\u2019s Giannis Antetokounmpo already is, his game still is clarifying and maturing back then as well. Williamson arrived as literally the league\u2019s Next Big Thing. The No. 1 pick in the 2019 draft had a resume crammed with jaw-dropping plays, given his 6-foot-7, 284-pound frame. He drew comparisons to LeBron James, only beefier, with a humble, engaging personality and the potential to thrive in this era of positionless basketball. His rookie season offered a glimpse, but was limited after knee surgery to just 24 appearances. He didn\u2019t make his debut until Jan. 22, New Orleans\u2019 45 th game and he played just five times in the Orlando bubble as the Pelicans went 2-6 to miss the playoff berth. His numbers were solid \u2014 22.5 ppg in 27.8 minutes per game, with 6.3 rpg, 2.1 apg, 58.3% shooting and a 6-for-14 showing on 3-pointers. That earned him a spot on the All-Rookie team, though Williamson\u2019s limited participation made Memphis\u2019 Ja Morant a runaway Kia Rookie of the Year winner. This season, the air around the Pelicans is different, the assessments of both the team and Williamson a bit tougher. They\u2019re two years removed from Anthony Davis\u2019 undermining trade demands, a season-plus beyond Williamson\u2019s and VP of basketball operations David Griffin\u2019s arrivals. That\u2019s about as much honeymoon as sports people get in these cranky, pandemic times \u2014 actually, in the old, normal times, too \u2014 and the team\u2019s 6-10 start under new coach Stan Van Gundy sure hasn\u2019t extended it. After Williamson and teammate Brandon Ingram each scored 32 points in a victory against Washington Wednesday, the big fellow\u2019s achievement was duly noted on social media. It was followed almost immediately by comments wondering why, in nearly 33 minutes, he grabbed only two of New Orleans\u2019 50 rebounds that night. And then this from one critic, who linked Shaquille O\u2019Neal, Kevin Garnett and Williamson in another, less flattering way: \u201cWhich means NO NBA Championship until you request to be traded to a contender.\u201d While the Pelicans are 14 th in the Western Conference, it\u2019s more than the W-L mark that has some folks concerned. They rank in the bottom half of the NBA in offensive and defensive rating and the bottom 10 in points per game, opponents points per game and pace. They are 26 th in 3-point field goal attempts (30.8), 27 th in 3-point percentage (33.7), 30 th in the number of 3-pointers their opponents take (41.6) and 22 nd in the percentage (37.8) given up. That has Van Gundy\u2019s crew being outscored by more than 16 points per game from the 3-point line. Williamson is toting his own raggedy numbers. He leads the NBA in 2-point field goals made (140), but his sample size of 3-pointers is shrinking in every way \u2014 he\u2019s 1-for-6 on them (16.7%) this season. He\u2019s underwater in his ratings at 108.6 offensively and 113.9 defensively. After being a plus-2.6 in his limited action in 2019-20, Williamson is a minus-2.9 so far this season. And the Pelicans have been 3.1 points better when he\u2019s been off the floor. Defensively, he has given up size when used at center. But even when used next to Steven Adams, Van Gundy\u2019s most frequent alignment, Williamson frequently has gotten burned by ball-watching and losing his man. With nits getting picked, some have returned to wondering about Williamson\u2019s body mass and how suited it ever will be to wing play or heavy mileage. It\u2019s a fine line between unicorn and \u2018tweener. Earlier this month, Van Gundy met with Williamson and Ingram to remind them how some of the league\u2019s top tandems \u2014 James and Davis with the Lakers, as well as Antetokounmpo and Khris Middleton with the Bucks \u2014 thrive. \u201cThey\u2019re all guys that play both ends of the floor,\u201d Van Gundy said. \u201cThey\u2019re two-way guys. My challenge is to create a better offensive framework and spacing for [Williamson and Ingram]. Their challenge is to take the responsibility defensively, that they step forward and become better defenders and part of the solution at that end of the floor.\u201d Antetokounmpo is a fine rabbit for Williamson to chase in more ways than that. When you\u2019ve still got a \u201cshock the world\u201d tweet from four and a half years ago pinned under your profile , following a role model who racked up two Kia Most Valuable Player awards, four All-NBA selections and trophies as both Kia Defensive Player of the Year and Kia Most Improved in his first seven seasons seems to fit. It\u2019s worth remembering, though, that Antetokounmpo didn\u2019t arrive as a fully formed All-Star. That horn in the middle of his forehead was a mere bump when the Bucks picked him 15th overall in 2013. Antetokounmpo\u2019s rookie production \u2014 6.8 ppg, 4.4 rpg, 1.9 apg \u2014 was meager, but his tremendous wingspan and lateral quickness meshed swiftly with a nose for defense as coached by Larry Drew and Jason Kidd. Yet in season No. 2, his production was small compared to Williamson\u2019s: 12.7 ppg, 6.7 rpg, 2.6 apg and 49.1% shooting. What has distinguished Antetokounmpo has been steady year-over-year improvement. His scoring and rebounding averages stepped up in each of his first seven seasons, as did his efficiency until his per-36 stats were 34.9 ppg, 16.1 rpg and 6.6 apg in 2019-20. Differing aspirations in Antetokounmpo\u2019s early years (the Bucks made the playoffs once in his first three seasons) and the added intensity for Williamson of being drafted No. 1 rather explain some difference in the criticism levels. But for the league\u2019s best and most promising, that remains a constant. Coach Mike Budenholzer, general manager Jon Horst and a committed ownership have built the Bucks around Antetokounmpo. That\u2019s a process only beginning in New Orleans, where perimeter shooting is a dire need. The trade deadline might help, but otherwise Williamson and the Pelicans will work with what they have. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to create more situations for him,\u201d Van Gundy said. \u201cHaving the ball on the perimeter and being able to attack. Whether he\u2019s handling on pick-and-rolls or getting opportunities to drive the ball \u2026 that\u2019s going to take some time. Not only for him, but for our team. \u201cThis guy is one of the most unique talents that I\u2019ve seen in the league. Trying to create a package for him is challenging yet fun at the same time.\u201d * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

NEW YORK \u2013 Utah Jazz guard Donovan Mitchell has received the Offseason NBA Cares Community Assist Award presented by Kaiser Permanente in recognition of his continued efforts to advance social justice and champion education between the 2019-20 and 2020-21 NBA seasons, the NBA announced today. This is the fourth year the NBA and Kaiser Permanente have presented the offseason award to an NBA player for his impactful work from the end of the regular season to the start of the following season. Mitchell is committed to providing educational access and support for young people of all backgrounds, particularly from communities of color. In December, the Mitchell family pledged $12 million to Greenwich Country Day School, Donovan and his sister Jordan\u2019s alma mater and the school where their mother, Nicole, taught for more than a decade. The contribution was the largest single donation in the school\u2019s history and will be used to create the Mitchell Family Scholarship Fund to aid students from pre-K-12 th grade, the Nicole Mitchell Faculty Support Fund to assist teachers who demonstrate the same passion for teaching as Nicole, as well as the new D.O.N.! The Determination Over Negativity Mitchell Family Athletic Center. This past summer, Mitchell also donated the proceeds of his Adidas D.O.N. Issue #2 sneakers to support the education of Jacob Blake\u2019s children, students of color at the University of Louisville and teachers at preschools in Connecticut and the Bronx, totaling more than $300,000 in scholarships and academic assistance. Following his unwavering commitment to speak out against racial injustice during the 2019-20 NBA season restart, Mitchell continued the conversation during the offseason, joining then vice-presidential candidate Sen. Kamala Harris, Portland\u2019s CJ McCollum and Philadelphia\u2019s Tobias Harris for a discussion on educational, economic and social inequities. Mitchell was also named to the inaugural board of the National Basketball Social Justice Coalition, which will leverage the game\u2019s influence to raise awareness, educate and advocate for meaningful reform, and regularly gives back to those most in need through his SPIDACARES organization. \u201cI\u2019m honored to receive the NBA Community Assist Award. We, as athletes, have a responsibility to do our part to give back to our communities and raise the bar for the next generation,\u201d said Mitchell. \u201cNot too long ago I was one of those kids that looked up to professional athletes, and I recognize how blessed I am to be in this position to give back to the multiple communities that have contributed to my growth not only as an athlete but as a person. My goal is to continue to inspire and encourage youth, from coast to coast with an emphasis on the importance of education.\u201d Mitchell was presented with the award during a special virtual ceremony with league, Kaiser Permanente and Jazz officials, including the team\u2019s new Governor Ryan Smith, as well as members of The Children\u2019s Village on Monday, and will also be recognized during the Jazz\u2019s home game tonight against the Dallas Mavericks (10:00 p.m. ET on ESPN). In addition, Kaiser Permanente and the NBA will donate $10,000 on Mitchell\u2019s behalf to The Children\u2019s Village in New York. The NBA Cares Community Assist Award presented by Kaiser Permanente recognizes an NBA player each month who best reflects the passion that the league and its players share for giving back to their communities. It honors the standard set by NBA Legend David Robinson, who improved the community piece by piece. At the end of the 2020-21 regular season, the Seasonlong NBA Cares Community Assist Award winner will be announced.

Trail Blazers (9-7) at Rockets (7-9), 7:30 p.m. ET, TNT The Blazers rank third in the NBA in 3-pointers made with 15.8 per game. They are 8-1 on the season when making at least 15 threes and just 1-6 when they finish with fewer than 15 threes. Christian Wood is set to return after missing the past three games with an ankle injury. Wood leads the Rockets in scoring (23.5 ppg, 24th in NBA), rebounding (10.8 rpg, 11th in NBA) and blocks (1.8 bpg, 6th in NBA) and is one of five players to average 23-10 so far this season. In Wood\u2019s absence, DeMarcus Cousins started at center for the Rockets and averaged 17.3 points, 14.3 rebounds, 4.7 assists, 3.0 3-pointers (on 40.9% shooting) and 1.7 steals in 31.9 minutes per game to help Houston win all three games. The Blazers are 6-2 in clutch games (score within five points in final five minutes) so far this season, with Damian Lillard leading the way. Lillard has 44 clutch points (tied for third-most in the league) and is shooting 11-17 (64.7%) from the field, 3-7 (42.9%) from 3 and a perfect 19-19 from the free throw line. The Blazers have outscored their opponents by 29 points in Lillard\u2019s 29 clutch minutes . Carmelo Anthony needs 31 points to pass Dominique Wilkins (26,668) for 13th place on the NBA\u2019s all-time scoring list. Anthony is coming off a season-high 22 points against OKC on Monday. His last game with at least 31 points came on Feb. 23, 2020 against Detroit. Warriors (10-8) at Suns (8-8), 10:00 p.m. ET, TNT Warriors rookie James Wiseman is coming off the best game of his young career as he finished with a career-high 25 points on 9-14 shooting from the field and 3-3 from 3-point range, grabbed six boards and blocked two shots in Golden State\u2019s win over Minnesota on Wednesday. The Warriors are 3-4 on the road this season and have allowed 121.6 points per game \u2014 the second-highest mark in the league, ahead of only Minnesota. However, the Suns enter Thursday on a three-game losing streak \u2014 with all three games at home and two without Devin Booker (hamstring). Phoenix scored a season-low 97 points on Wednesday against OKC. Both teams played on Wednesday so Thursday\u2019s game will be the second night of a back-to-back. So far this season, the Suns are 3-1 in those games, while the Warriors are 1-1 . Which team will be able to dictate the pace of play on Thursday? The Warriors play at the third-fastest pace in the league (104.25 possessions per 48 minutes), while the Suns play at the second-slowest pace (97.86). Chris Paul enters Thursday ranked sixth in the NBA with 8.8 assists per game. He is on pace to become only the fifth player to average at least eight assists in their 15th season or later, joining Jason Kidd (3x), John Stockton (2x), Steve Nash (2x) and LeBron James (last season)."},{"id":483324,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/hawks-kris-dunn-ankle-to-miss-at-least-2-more-weeks","date":"2021-01-28","title":"Hawks' Kris Dunn (ankle) to miss at least 2 more weeks","content":"ATLANTA \u2014 Atlanta Hawks guard Kris Dunn will be out at least another two weeks as he continues his recovery from ankle surgery.

Tonight\u2019s matchup with Houston offers the best game environment on the slate, so Kanter should be a popular center in the mid-tier salary range. Kendrick Nunn (SG \u2013 MIA): $6,200 vs. LAC Which Miami player should be in your sights tonight? Nunn other than Kendrick! He\u2019s seen heavy playing time and usage as of late thanks to Miami\u2019s litany of absences. The Clippers will be without three of their best defenders tonight in Leonard, PG13, and Pat Bev, making Nunn an even more attractive play. Delon Wright (PG \u2013 DET): $6,000 vs. LAL Wright has scored at least 36 FD points in three of his last four games, including a season-high 55.9 Monday against Philly. He\u2019s a fine scorer, but his ability to fill up the stat sheet is what\u2019s kept his fantasy value so inflated. In that four-game span, Wright has averaged six boards, six assists, and nearly three combined blocks\/steals while playing a key role in Detroit\u2019s offense. This is the wrong time to fade Wright. Jae Crowder (PF \u2013 PHO): $5,200 vs. GSW Crowder has started for Phoenix in each of the team\u2019s last two games, and he\u2019ll likely do that again tonight if Devin Booker remains out. Crowder has scored at least 34 FD points in both games, and tonight\u2019s matchup with Golden State offers a friendly game environment to extend that streak of quality fantasy performances to three. James Wiseman (C \u2013 GSW): $4,800 at PHO Wiseman\u2019s playing time is obviously a concern, as is the fact that he hasn\u2019t started either of the Dubs\u2019 last two games. Still, he\u2019s averaged 29.0 FD points across his last five contests while eclipsing 30 FD points twice in that span. I like that value for tournaments. Gary Trent (SG \u2013 POR): $4,800 at HOU Trent started for Portland on Monday against the Thunder, and he logged 41 minutes in the process. I want to get as much exposure to the Rockets\/Blazers as I can on this slate, and drafting Trent allows you plenty of flexibility to jam in multiple studs. Reggie Jackson (PG \u2013 LAC): $4,700 at MIA Jackson went off for 47.4 FD points Tuesday thanks to a robust 20\/8\/7 line, yet his price hasn\u2019t changed in the last two days. He\u2019s still just $5K, even with Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, and Patrick Beverley out again tonight. Terance Mann (PG \u2013 LAC): $4,500 at MIA Mann played 33 minutes and scored 34.3 FD points Tuesday, and he\u2019ll look to keep that momentum going tonight against the Heat. With the Clippers\u2019 primary offensive options out again and Lou Williams continuing to struggle, it\u2019s time to Mann up with Terance on this slate. Jae\u2019Sean Tate (SF \u2013 HOU): $3,800 vs. POR David Nwaba seems like the safer play, but at $5.3K, he\u2019s $1,500 more than Tate, and that ain\u2019t great. I\u2019d rather spend down to this beautiful sub-$4K price tag and take a chance on a guy who\u2019s averaged better than 26 minutes per game this season. Usage and opportunity will take a hit with Houston beginning to return its starters, but Tate has established himself as a regular part of Coach Silas\u2019 rotation. Marc Gasol (C \u2013 LAL): $3,600 at DET Detroit has surrendered the fourth-most FD points to opposing bigs this season (58.11) and the most blocks per game to opponents (6.6). Those numbers bode well for Gasol, given his ability to produce solid lines in limited minutes. His playing time and usage are too erratic to warrant cash-game consideration, but if you need a cheap GPP target, Gasol should be a great option at center. Marc my words!

Gobert racked up season highs in points (29) and rebounds (20), and Jordan Clarkson came off the bench to flame the Mavericks for a season and game-high 31 points. Joe Ingles chipped in a season-high 21 points, knocking down a career-high tying seven 3-pointers , and dished eight dimes. \u201cHere, it\u2019s a different vibe,\u201d Clarkson explained. \u201cEverybody just knows their role, and everybody\u2019s happy for each other. It\u2019s almost like we get more happy when we get our teammates a shot than when we\u2019re scoring the ball. It\u2019s just a crazy feeling, a crazy vibe that we have and that we preach here. The ball doesn\u2019t stick. We\u2019re all just playing off energy and synergy. \u201cThat flow and everything just comes from outside the court, practice, everybody just having that free mindset, and knowing what we\u2019re gonna do, and knowing what the next man is capable of down the line. That\u2019s where it all comes from. We\u2019re gonna keep that vibe running and keep doing what we\u2019re doing.\u201d That sounds like bad news for Utah\u2019s upcoming opponents. The Jazz host the Mavs again on Friday ( 10 ET, ESPN ). Utah hit the floor for this one without their leading scorer in Mitchell, who is in the NBA\u2019s concussion protocol after experiencing symptoms Wednesday morning coming off the team\u2019s win Tuesday night against the New York Knicks. Dallas, meanwhile, welcomed Josh Richardson back into the lineup along with Dwight Powell and Dorian Finney-Smith after the trio finally cleared the NBA\u2019s COVID-19 protocols. Ingles started in Mitchell\u2019s place, and paired with Gobert throughout the game to make for a lethal combination on pick-and-rolls against Kristaps Porzingis, who played center in an attempt to draw the Utah big out of the paint on defense. Seven of Ingles\u2019 eight assists contributed to Gobert buckets, with Clarkson and Mike Conley (17 points, six assists) feeding the Jazz big man heavily, too. \u201cThose synergies with different guys really develop over time,\u201d Utah coach Quin Snyder said. \u201cRudy and Joe have played together for a while and look for each other. I think everybody feels that way about the bigs, and the same thing is true of guys looking for each other. It\u2019s nice to see those partnerships and that unselfishness all the time. I think it\u2019s something that all of our guys feel good about being part of our identity.\u201d In a wire-to-wire Utah win in which it led by as many as 25 points, Ingles and Gobert quickly established their presence. Ingles drained two 3-pointers in the opening frame in addition to serving up two assists, as the Jazz seized a 32-19 lead on the momentum of Gobert\u2019s 10 points in the quarter. Clarkson caught fire in the second quarter, scoring 13 of the team\u2019s first 16 points on the way to pouring in a game-high 22 points in the first half to go with Gobert\u2019s 20 first-half points on 8-of-11 shooting. \u201cI think I just went with the flow of the game, and my teammates Joe [Ingles] and Mike [Conley], everybody really did a great job of looking for me,\u201d Gobert said. \u201cI just tried to dominate, be patient. They weren\u2019t really helping on the shooter, so it was on me tonight to finish at the rim. Joe is always looking for others before he looks for himself. There\u2019s not many players in the league that you have to remind them to shoot the ball. \u201cHe\u2019s a very smart player. He\u2019s always able to put me and other guys in a great position to score. I believe that when he\u2019s aggressive, too, he\u2019s very hard to guard because you know he\u2019s a great passer.\u201d Gobert would finish the game with three blocks and three steals, too, as Utah limited Dallas to 46.2% from the field and 34.3% from 3-point range. On the glass, Utah destroyed the Mavericks 50-36. \u201cDifferent guys stepped up in different ways,\u201d Snyder said. \u201cGuys stay ready. We ask that of them. Sometimes, when you come in a game, there\u2019s little things and simple things that have a big impact on the game and just trying to fit into the group and make plays within the structure of what everybody\u2019s doing. So, we\u2019ll continue to need that.\u201d They\u2019ll also keep focusing on improvement on the defensive end, while not buying into the hype that accompanies owning the league\u2019s best record. Gobert, Clarkson and Ingles all made it a point to downplay the team\u2019s hot start. But let\u2019s not forget or a second that nine of Utah\u2019s 10 wins in this current streak have come by 10 points or more. \u201cTo be honest with you, it\u2019s great to be winning games. We\u2019re playing at a high level. But I just don\u2019t think we\u2019re kind of satisfied. I think we just want to keep pushing,\u201d Ingles said. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to be playing at this level. It\u2019s obviously early in the year. But we\u2019ve figured out the style, the pace and stuff that we want to play at. \u201cTen, 20, 30, winning, losing streak, whatever it is, we\u2019ve just got to keep pushing, keep getting better each day. I don\u2019t remember in my seven years how well we\u2019ve started every year. But it\u2019s nice to start well. \u2026 We have guys that kind of have their roles, but a lot of nights we have different guys step up at different times, and again was another one with guys out. We play for each other. There\u2019s no egos involved. It\u2019s just a really cool group. We\u2019re not gonna get over-hyped over one win or 10 in a row, whatever it is.\u201d * * * Michael C.

Portland will now visit Washington on Tuesday, a game that was originally set for the second half. Washington will play at Charlotte on Feb. 7, a game that was rescheduled from Jan. 20. And that means the Blazers, who were scheduled to visit the Hornets that day, will now go to Charlotte in the second half of the schedule. The league has postponed 22 games so far this season, 21 of them since Jan. 10. The original intent was to push all those postponed games into the second half, when possible; now, the league said it would move some games into the first-half schedules, \u201cwith a specific focus on the teams with the most postponed games to date.\u201d That would certainly include Washington and Memphis, both of which have seen a league-high six games postponed. The Wizards went 13 days without games after six players tested positive for COVID-19 and three others had to sit out because of contact tracing. The Grizzlies will have gone 12 days without games if they play, as planned, in San Antonio on Saturday. Some good news for the league on Wednesday: The Grizzlies said they were returning to practice. And even better news: The NBA and the National Basketball Players Association said Wednesday that only one player in the league tested positive for COVID-19 in the past seven days, down from 16 two weeks ago and 11 last week. It remains possible that some of the stronger protocols put in place earlier this month, such as not allowing players to leave hotels on road trips for almost any reason other than games or practices, may be somewhat loosened soon as well. Without the schedule changes by the NBA, the Wizards and Grizzlies may have been looking at playing 41 times in 67 days during the second half of the season \u2014 which will stretch from March 11 through May 16. Boston and Phoenix have had three games postponed apiece so far, and it\u2019s not yet known publicly how their first-half schedules will be adjusted. \u201cI\u2019ve heard about one. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m supposed to say, so I won\u2019t,\u201d Celtics coach Brad Stevens said Wednesday. \u201cMy preference is that they consider our travel appropriately. So, that\u2019s the only thing I have to say about it. We obviously know in this condensed schedule anyway that we were going to be nonstop. \u201cWe\u2019re just going to try to do our best to be ready for the next night, wherever that may be, whoever we may be playing and hopefully improve ourselves a little bit,\u201d Stevens added. Teams also began arriving Wednesday at Walt Disney World in Lake Buena Vista, Florida, to begin quarantine and prepping for the G League season, which \u2014 like the NBA did last season \u2014 will utilize a bubble. The G League released its 135-game schedule for the 18 teams that will be taking part. All teams will play 15 games from Feb. 10 through March 6. The top eight will go to a single-elimination playoff, and the G League championship game is set for March 11 \u2014 the same day the NBA\u2019s second half is set to open and the one-year anniversary of the day the league suspended play last season because of the pandemic."},{"id":482527,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/1-player-tests-positive-in-latest-covid-19-test-results-2","date":"2021-01-27","title":"1 player tests positive in latest COVID-19 test results","content":"NEW YORK \u2013 Of the 492 players tested for COVID-19 since Jan. 20, one new player has returned a confirmed positive test.

But, that\u2019s for later. In the meantime, the candidates are starting to crystalize and make themselves known. Others are cancelling themselves out; Russell Westbrook, for example, could become the highest-paid non-All Star ($41 million) in league history. With the season barely more than a month old, this is a premature look at the possible starters and reserves. Keep in mind that, because of games missed, it\u2019s unfair to give Kyrie Irving and Ja Morant, for instance, much consideration right this very minute. By the middle of next month, provided they stay on the floor, that will change. Each team will have two backcourt players and three front court players, plus a pair of wild cards among the reserves. These are the players currently holding pole position. LeBron James, Lakers. No suspense, no debate, no fuss here. LeBron in his 17th season remains among the very best, if he\u2019s not the best. Some of the greats earned ceremonial All-Star spots as they aged. There will be none of that, at least for now, with LeBron. Nikola Jokic, Nuggets. He\u2019s still a triple-double threat and a certifiable problem for most teams. But for some reason, the Nuggets are off to a perplexing start. No worries, there\u2019s plenty of time to change that; in the meantime, \u201cThe Joker\u201d will be their lone All-Star rep. Kawhi Leonard, Clippers. Not only is Kawhi off to a terrific start (25.9 points, 50.5% shooting), it appears the previous and controversial trend of \u201cload management\u201d is a thing of the past. Maybe the embarrassing way the Clippers exited the playoffs last season changed that approach. Damian Lillard, Blazers. In the past, he always took exception to slights, whether real or imagined. Some folks gave Dame a hard time about it, but he\u2019s a prideful player who demands respect. Well, he\u2019s getting it here. Luka Doncic, Mavericks. This hasn\u2019t quite shaped up to be the Kia MVP campaign that Luka worshippers had hoped for (that 28.4% shooting from deep is problematic), yet it appears he\u2019s in for another solid season, nearly averaging a triple-double. Paul George, Clippers. Notice how the snickers have subsided since the bubble, when George didn\u2019t exactly endear himself. Anyway, not only is he off to a strong start (almost 50-50-90), he evidently has put all the misery well behind him. While we wait to see what the playoffs bring, he deserves to be saluted now. Stephen Curry, Warriors. You say he should start over Dame or Luka? Fine. It\u2019s a close call either way , and there is no wrong or right answer. Anyway, the Warriors are simply thrilled that, after a virtual absence in 2019-20, Steph is still Steph. Anthony Davis, Lakers. Imagine AD making second team in any scenario? It just shows how deep and strong the West front-line candidates are this season. Davis is probably still too busy staring at his championship ring to notice or care, anyway. Zion Williamson, Pelicans. It\u2019s his time and turn to make a star run, and this is made possible by the Pelicans\u2019 decision to stop spoon-feeding him minutes. Now that he\u2019s unleashed, Zion is a solid candidate to be an All-Star, even over his teammate, Brandon Ingram. Rudy Gobert, Jazz. His offense remains a work in progress and his hands aren\u2019t the softest, but Gobert obviously didn\u2019t just earn a massive contract extension because of his post-up moves. Donovan Mitchell, Jazz (wild card). His development into a star has gone hitch-free, especially now that his confidence and consistency with his shooting range (39.5% from deep on eight shots per game) is soaring. Mitchell represents all that\u2019s right with basketball. Devin Booker, Suns (wc). He should give an assist to Chris Paul for freeing him from constant playmaking responsibilities and allowing him to roam. That said, Booker\u2019s spot on this All-Star team seems the most tenuous. Still in play: De\u2019Aaron Fox, Kings; Brandon Ingram, Pelicans; CJ McCollum, Blazers; Ja Morant, Grizzlies. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Bucks. He was the leader of Team Giannis last year and the unquestioned best player in the East, although now, there\u2019s company and competition for that throne. Anyway, the two-time MVP remains a virtual lock to start. Move on, nothing else to see here. Kevin Durant, Nets. The journey from a torn Achilles was once a limp, now a sprint, as Durant is acing all the tests and looking very much like the Durant of old. He\u2019s back among the scoring leaders (currently No. 2) and demanding to be double teamed. The only issue now is whether he can stay healthy and how many votes will he collect to possibly win his second MVP award. Joel Embiid, Sixers. After a distressing end to last season, Embiid did some self-inspection and returned a better player. That, and new coach Doc Rivers built a system designed for Embiid to flourish and position himself for the MVP consideration. Embiid is often the best player in any games at both ends, and the Sixers are better off for that. The All-Star starter appointment seems like an afterthought at this stage. Bradley Beal, Wizards. His ego was bruised last year when he wasn\u2019t given any All-NBA consideration, and while the Wizards are still trapped near the basement of the East, it\u2019s not because of Beal, who leads the league in scoring. He\u2019ll rep Washington now, but will he wear that Wizards logo the next time he gets voted into the game? Jaylen Brown, Celtics. James Harden truthers will strongly disagree with this, and over the next month, maybe they\u2019ll be right. But unlike Harden, Brown has done his work exclusively in the East \u2014 which should count for something \u2014 and he\u2019s arguably having just as good a season by playing both ends . It\u2019s also a salute to a player who has elevated himself among the very best in short time. Jayson Tatum, Celtics. Durant\u2019s migration to the East effectively bumps Tatum from being in the starting five. That said, he\u2019s definitely worthy and should make the East lineup anyway. Domantas Sabonis, Pacers. The Son Of Arvydas is not only rounding into a reliable post player \u2014 opponents still haven\u2019t figured how to stop him from going left \u2014 but the Pacers are making him their go-to resource. Julius Randle, Knicks. Good luck trying to find a handful of East forwards with a better first month than Randle (23-11-6), who has done the unthinkable and helped elevate the Knicks into the ranks of the middle-of-the-packers. James Harden, Nets. There\u2019ll be no argument made for anyone who insists the league leader in assists deserves to start for the East. Harden has shaken off a sloppy exit from the Rockets and now seeks to find peace and a place in the Nets\u2019 Big Three blueprint. Trae Young, Hawks. He went through a tough shooting spell for about a week, then collected himself and recovered. While Young brings the excitement, it\u2019s astonishing how often he\u2019s also getting the respect of the whistles and getting to the free throw line (roughly 10 per game, virtual tie with Embiid for league most). Zach LaVine, Bulls (wc). Criticism of his play might have carried some weight in the past, but not this season, where LaVine is more consistent and steadier than ever. He\u2019s dangerous at the 3-point line and the rim. He could still be in 50-40-90 territory by the All-Star break. Bam Adebayo, Heat (wc). In a season that otherwise is underwhelming for the defending East champs, Adebayo is looking more like he belongs in the top tier of NBA frontcourt players. Most encouraging is that he finally sees himself as a first option for Miami. Still in play: Khris Middleton, Bucks; Ben Simmons, Sixers; Malcolm Brogdon, Pacers; Kyrie Irving, Nets; Collin Sexton, Cavaliers; Gordon Hayward, Hornets. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

Lakers (14-4) at Sixers (12-6), 7:30 ET, ESPN \u2022 With their win in Cleveland on Monday, the Lakers improved to 10-0 on the road , becoming just the sixth team in NBA history to open a season with at least 10 straight road wins. The Lakers go for No. 11 on Wednesday in Philadelphia where the Sixers are an NBA-best 9-1 at home . The Lakers have outscored their opponents by an average of 12.5 points on the road, while the Sixers own a point differential of 7.8 at home. \u2022 LeBron James scored a season-high 46 points in the Lakers win against the Cavs on Monday, increasing his season average to 25.2 ppg. Since his second year in the NBA (2004-05), LeBron has never averaged fewer than 25 points in a season. \u2022 Sixers center and reigning Eastern Conference Player of the Week Joel Embiid enters Wednesday as the only player in the NBA to rank in the top 10 in both scoring (27.7 ppg, fifth) and rebounding (11.5, seventh). \u2022 The Sixers rank second in the NBA in fast break points (16.4 per game), led by Tobias Harris, who ranks second among all players with 4.8 fast break points per game. However, the Sixers also allow the most fast break points per game to their opponents (17.1 per game). \u2022 The Sixers lead the NBA in rim protection , allowing opponents to shoot just 57.3% while defending the basket. That defense will be tested against a Lakers team that shoots 67.6% inside the restricted area (4th in NBA) and are led by two players in the top 12 in restricted area field goals made \u2014 LeBron James (4.4 per game, 71.2% FG) and Montrezl Harrell (4.2 per game, 76.8%). Timberwolves (4-12) at Warriors (9-8), 10 ET, ESPN \u2022 This is the second meeting in three days for these teams with Golden State striking first with a 130-108 win over Monday behind 36 points from Stephen Curry. The Warriors are 6-2 this season when Curry scores at least 30 points; and 4-1 when he reaches 35 points. \u2022 Curry spent 5:40 (49.3%) of his offensive matchup time being defended by either Ricky Rubio or Jordan McLaughlin and was held to seven points on 3-for-8 shooting from the field and 1-for-4 from 3-point range. However, when Curry was able to find matchups with Jarred Vanderbilt (1:50) and Josh Okogie (0:42) he could not miss . In that 2:32 of matchup time, Curry scored 21 points on 6-for-6 shooting from the field, including four 3-pointers. \u2022 Malik Beasley led the Timberwolves with a season-high 30 points in the loss. It was the just the second 30+ point game of Beasley\u2019s career and the first since Feb. 1, 2019 as a member of the Denver Nuggets. Similar to Curry, Beasley took advantage of specific matchups . In 6:45 against either Andrew Wiggins, Draymond Green or Mychal Mulder. Beasley scored 12 points on 4-for-9 shooting. In just 56 seconds against either Kent Bazemore or Kevon Looney, Beasley scored 15 points on 5-for-5 shooting, with three 3-pointers. \u2022 Andrew Wiggins finished with 23 points, six rebounds, three steals and three blocks in 30 minutes against his former team. Wiggins has 42 career games with at least three steals and 19 games with at least three blocks , but this was the first game of his career with at least three in both categories. \u2022 In the first meeting of the top two picks in the 2020 NBA Draft , Anthony Edwards finished with 15 points and three rebounds in 27 minutes for the Wolves, while James Wiseman had 13 points, four rebounds and two blocks in just 16 minutes for the Warriors."},{"id":482495,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/fanduel-dfs-values-of-the-night-wednesday-jan-27","date":"2021-01-27","title":"FanDuel DFS Values Of The Night: Wednesday (Jan. 27)","content":"Michael Porter Jr. (DEN): $6,800 The Heat have struggled against small forwards this year (where Porter plays 52% of the time) and Porter is a low-risk play below $7,000. He dropped 44.6 FD points the last time he was on the court. Jarred Vanderbilt (MIN): $5,400 Vanderbilt hasn\u2019t scored fewer than 29.8 points over his last three games, so he\u2019s a safe bet to hit 5x value \u2014 especially since the Warriors give up the third-most FDPPG to opposing power forwards. Bojan Bogdanovic (UTH): $5,300 Bogdanovic makes this list because he\u2019s the freshest Jazz starter heading into tonight. He played just 24 minutes last night, while every other member of the starting five played 30-plus. As a result, he may get some extra minutes, and those would be extra valuable against the Mavericks\u2019 10th-worst defense against small forwards. Steven Adams (NOR): $5,000 The Wizards continue to collapse late in games, and they\u2019re giving up the fourth-most FDPPG to opposing centers. Adams should demolish them tonight, especially since they\u2019re on the wrong side of a back-to-back. Cole Anthony (ORL): $5,000 The Sacramento Kings give up the most FDPPG to opposing point guards. With Markelle Fultz out for the season, Anthony has been starting at point guard for the Magic. He\u2019s hit at least 5x value against this price in his last two matchups. Joe Harris (BKN): $4,700 Look for Harris to post a ton of points in what should be a high-scoring game \u2014 especially because he dropped 30-plus FD points in both of his earlier games against the Hawks. Donte DiVincenzo (MIL): $4,400 DiVincenzo has hit 5x value against this price in five of his last eight games, a stretch that included a three-game cold streak. However, he recovered with 25.3 FD points against the Hawks. Since the Raptors give up an above-average number of FDPPG to opposing shooting guards, I\u2019m sticking with DiVincenzo tonight. DeAndre Jordan (BKN): $4,300 Jordan didn\u2019t do a whole lot the last time these two teams met, but Jarrett Allen was still a Net then, so Jordan will have to compensate for his absence. Raul Neto (WAS): $4,200 Neto is one of the Wizards\u2019 fresher players considering they played last night. He got just 22 minutes to Russell Westbrook\u2019s 28 and Bradley Beal\u2019s 35. As a result, look for him to see some extra run in the rotation at guard. Nickeil Alexander-Walker (NOR): $4,200 Alexander-Walker has gotten a vote of confidence of late from the Pelicans, which I\u2019ll ride into tonight\u2019s slate against the Wizards (who give up the fifth-most FDPPG to shooting guards).

Rushmore types Oscar Robertson and Jerry West went 1-2 way back in 1960. But it does make for a little contemporary intrigue, based on the scouting reports and debates that might have hung over the most recent Draft. And this week, in a scheduling quirk based on virus concessions, we get it twice with the Minnesota Timberwolves playing the Golden State Warriors in consecutive games at San Francisco\u2019s Chase Center. Anthony Edwards, whom the Wolves picked No. 1 overall in November, went head-to-head if not position-to-position Monday with Warriors center James Wiseman, the No. 2 pick. They\u2019ll do it again Wednesday ( 10 p.m. ET, ESPN ) to determine \u2026 well, nothing official or momentous. But it will provide another glimpse of the guys judged a couple of months ago \u2014 in a Class of 2020 with an unclear pecking order \u2014 to have the most talent, the most potential or some combination thereof. Wiseman won Round 1. Golden State beat Minnesota 130-108 and the 7-foot big man had the better stats line: 13 points on 4-for-5 shooting with four rebounds and two blocks. Edwards scored 15 points but did so on 4-for-13 shooting, with three boards, one assist and a steal. Wiseman was a minus-2 in 16 minutes while the 6-foot-4 wing from Georgia was minus-10 in 27. One wrinkle Monday was that Wiseman came off the bench, doing for the first time this season what Edwards has done every game for Minnesota. Warriors coach Steve Kerr wanted to change his rotation in hopes of getting more robust starts. So Kevon Looney swapped spots with Wiseman for what could be a short- or long-term tweak. Kerr said Wiseman took the news like a pro and then he played like it. Edwards has handled his reserve role smoothly too. But with Minnesota sputtering at 4-12 with Karl-Anthony Towns sidelined by health and safety protocols following a positive virus test, and D\u2019Angelo Russell missing time with a sore quad muscle, some in the team\u2019s fan base have pushed for longer minutes for the prize rookie. \u201cA lot of times, people look way too hard into starting lineups and when guys come in,\u201d Wolves coach Ryan Saunders said. \u201cBut we know this is a unique year. If you stay true to the process of making sure the individual has growth, you\u2019re going to what\u2019s best. \u201cWe\u2019ve explained to \u2018Ant\u2019 that, \u2018Hey, we think it\u2019s better for you coming off the bench, letting you see the game go for a few minutes.\u2019 And then for some of the guys he\u2019s playing with as well, giving that group a little more offensive firepower. You\u2019re probably able to handle the ball a little more too.\u201d Edwards, who has averaged 24.8 minutes to Wiseman\u2019s 21.1, had a monstrous dunk over the No. 2 pick Monday, the stuff of highlight reels and posters. But Saunders talked of more subtle contributions on which he\u2019s being evaluated and coached. Like play in transition, defense and rebounding, as veteran guard Ricky Rubio helps mentor on and off the court (Rubio has played in the second unit in nine of 14 games). For some perspective on these meetings of No. 1 and No. 2 rookies, it\u2019s worth noting that New Orleans\u2019 Zion Williamson and Memphis\u2019 Ja Morant faced each other only twice in six-plus months last season. The 2018 top two, Phoenix\u2019s Deandre Ayton and Sacramento\u2019s Marvin Bagley, met twice in six weeks. The top two selections in 2017 (Markelle Fultz and Lonzo Ball) and 2016 (Ben Simmons and Brandon Ingram) didn\u2019t square off at all in their rookie seasons, due to somebody\u2019s injury. That same reason limited or waylaid completely eagerly anticipated showdowns in 2014 (Andrew Wiggins vs. Jabari Parker, one game) and way back to 2007 (Greg Oden vs. Kevin Durant, none as rookies). So there is a little something-something to Edwards and Wiseman meeting twice in three nights. The Top 5 this week on the 2020-21 Kia Rookie Ladder: (All stats through Monday, Jan. 25) Season stats: 11.9 ppg, 5.9 rpg, 0.6 apg  Since last Ladder: 14.2 ppg, 5.2 rpg, 1.3 apg  Last Ladder\u2019s rung: 2 Wiseman nearly snagged the top rung on the Ladder last time, based on his contributions and some \u201cimagine this guy in five years\u201d projections. He got it this time not just by handling well his flip from starter to the Warriors\u2019 bench, but for his increasing involvement at both ends. His 7-foot-6 wingspan leads a flock of Golden State pterodactyls who have their team third in contested shots per game (59.6) and fifth in deflections (17.2). Season stats: 11.3 ppg, 6.1 rpg, 5.9 apg  Since last Ladder: 9.3 ppg, 4.3 rpg, 5.7 apg  Last Ladder\u2019s rung: 1 A drop in shooting accuracy (already low), a tick up in turnovers and a 1-5 stretch for his team were enough to unseat Ball at the same time, coincidentally, his brother Lonzo\u2019s reviews in New Orleans are flagging. Charlotte coach James Borrego might have cut LaMelo more slack if he had contributed more in other ways. \u201cIf you\u2019re turning the ball over five times in 16 minutes, that ain\u2019t gonna cut it for me,\u201d was Borrego\u2019s constructive criticism for the rookie. \u201cIf you\u2019re doing that on the offensive end, you better be bringing something defensively.\u201d Still leads the Class of 2020 in rebounds and assists, though. Season stats: 11.4 ppg, 3.0 rpg, 4,9 apg  Since last Ladder: 10.2 ppg, 3.6 rpg, 4.0 apg  Last Ladder\u2019s rung: 3 Haliburton\u2019s confidence, acknowledged in the last Ladder, showed up again when the Kings beat the Knicks last weekend. He admitted that he got motivated to face a New York team that, at No. 9, could have drafted him three spots ahead of Sacramento. And he showed up, scoring 16 points off the bench with a late, crucial 3-pointer. The Iowa State product has scored in double figures 11 times, and ranks Top 5 among newbies in scoring, assists, overall shooting percentage and 3-point percentage. Season stats: 11.0 ppg, 4.6 rpg, 3.3 apg  Since last Ladder: 13.4 ppg, 5.1 rpg, 3.7 apg  Last week\u2019s rung: 9 Opportunity is one thing; being ready to seize it is another. The Magic\u2019s rookie guard makes the biggest leap in our rankings by making the most of increased playing time since Markelle Fultz was lost to injury. Anthony has averaged 30.3 minutes lately compared to 23.3 through the first Ladder. His other numbers have bumped up accordingly, to 13.4 points, 5.1 rebounds, 3.7 assists in his past seven games, with 15 of 29 shooting (51.7%) from the arc. He scored 21 against Charlotte after hitting a game-winning three at Minnesota. 5. Anthony Edwards, Minnesota Timberwolves Season stats: 12.3 ppg, 2.8 rpg, 1.6 apg  Since last Ladder: 10.0 ppg, 2.5 rpg, 1.0 apg  Last Ladder\u2019s rung: 4 It\u2019s enough that Edwards\u2019 offensive numbers have sagged in the past couple weeks, including 26.9% on 3-pointers and 26.7% overall. But then there are the tough rookie lessons a fellow learns as he navigates his first NBA season, such as the woes his Wolves team endured dealing with Stephen Curry in the first of their consecutive meetings this week. \u201cHe\u2019ll just take on dribble and pull up from deep and shoot it like it\u2019s nothing,\u201d Edwards said, a little awed by the two-time MVP after their first brush. One positive lately: Edwards got to the foul line 13 times in his past two games, equaling his total for the previous eight. 6. Immanuel Quickley, New York Knicks Season stats: 10.7 ppg, 1.9 rpg, 2.5 apg  Since last Ladder: 15.0 ppg, 2.4 rpg, 3.1 apg  Last Ladder\u2019s rung: N\/A Career-high 31 (21 in 4Q) in 24 minutes in Portland. 7. Isaac Okoro, Cleveland Cavaliers Season stats: 8.3 ppg, 2.4 rpg, 1.8 apg  Since last Ladder: 9.2 ppg, 2.8 rpg, 1.7 apg  Last Ladder\u2019s rung: N\/A Defensive wing leads all rookies in minutes (35.9 per). 8. Xavier Tillman, Memphis Grizzlies Season stats: 8.6 ppg, 3.9 rpg, 1.6 apg  Since last Ladder: 13.0 ppg, 5.0 rpg, 2.0 apg  Last Ladder\u2019s rung: N\/A Overachieving big, with Desmond Bane, gives Grizzlies another 1-2 rookie punch. 9. Jae\u2019Sean Tate, Houston Rockets Season stats: 8.3 ppg, 4.8 rpg, 1.7 apg  Since last Ladder: 8.9 ppg, 4.9 rpg, 2.0 apg  Last Ladder\u2019s rung: N\/A First Rockets rookie with 5+ starts since Tarik Black in 2014-15. 10. Patrick Williams, Chicago Bulls Season stats: 9.4 ppg, 4.0 rpg, 1.0 apg  Since last Ladder: 7.6 ppg, 5.2 rpg, 1.0 apg  Last Ladder\u2019s rung: 5 Indecision on offensive end called out by coach Billy Donovan. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

He gave them a title. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, boss?\u201d He genuinely meant every one of those three words, because he wanted to know the state of your life at that very moment (the good, not so good, whatever) and by assigning you the highest of designations, he purposely raised your status, spirit, and self-esteem in his presence. Is there any better way to express your humanity than to take an interest in a friend or co-worker or even a stranger, and instantly make them feel \u2026 wanted? Such was Sekou, in any environment, be it inside the NBA TV studios where he worked, among his fellow journalists at an event he covered as a reporter, or in a locker room where he carried uncommon clout among players and coaches. Russell Westbrook, who rarely says anything to anybody before a game, rose from his locker stool unprompted last season and walked across the room to shake Sekou\u2019s hand and make small talk. To borrow a Sekou-ism, that\u2019s a boss move that maybe only Sekou could create. Every reporter is assigned a press credential that\u2019s necessary and mandatory for games and other sporting events, although with regard to Sekou, it was worthless. With him, no identification was necessary. \u201cWorking on the road with Sekou was an incredible experience because he knew everybody,\u201d said Steve Quintana, executive producer at NBA.com. \u201cNot only players and coaches, but security guards, parking attendants, equipment managers, doormen at the hotel. Everybody knew him and Sekou always stopped to talk to them.\u201d This personality, professionalism, and work ethic was rooted in Grand Rapids, Mich., where he was born (and became a die-hard University of Michigan fan) . Those qualities were taken to Jackson State University, where he attended school and was bitten by the journalism bug. His talent was quickly evident, and before long, Sekou was in the major leagues of sports writing, starting at the The Clarion-Ledger in Jackson, Miss., then covering the Pacers for the Indianapolis Star . Job offers and promotions followed, and the chance to work for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and cover the Hawks was too strong to resist. In Atlanta, he doggedly broke stories on the Hawks\u2019 beat mainly because players and coaches trusted him, not to get the story first, but to get it right. Then, a wonderful development enhanced his career: Sekou was a natural on TV, displaying the same poise, news judgment and fairness that marked his print work. His easy personality \u2014 full of laughter, storytelling, clever reactions to news and just simple conversation \u2014 was an added plus, and that bundle was too strong for Turner Sports to resist. And so, late in 2009, he was hired as a senior analyst for NBA.com and NBA TV and later developed and hosted the popular Hang Time Podcast. Sekou\u2019s signature weekly column , the \u201cThe MVP Ladder\u201d on NBA.com, was read by millions of NBA fans all over the world. At NBA Digital, Sekou collected countless friends and admirers, all of whom were served well by someone who made everyone comfortable in his presence. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the writers who gets it,\u201d said Dennis Scott, the former player and currently an analyst on NBA TV, \u201cone who dug deeper for the story. Sekou got into who we were as athletes and as people.\u201d There were numerous times when Scott walked into the TV studio, maybe feeling flat that particular day, and received an unsolicited pep talk. The voice and statement was always the same: \u201cC\u2019mon boss, be on time! Let\u2019s do this show,\u201d Sekou would shout. As a journalist, Sekou didn\u2019t subscribe to gimmicks and shock to gain an audience and seek validation. In that sense, here in the age of social media where so much goes unchecked, he was very much and refreshingly old school. He never slandered a subject or spread half-truths and rumors, and any criticism he issued was balanced and fair and on-point. NBA.com senior writer Steve Aschburner: \u2018I don\u2019t know anyone who moved more easily than Sekou through the many layers of the NBA.\u2019The amount of friends and colleagues and casual acquaintances multiplied over time and cities and jobs \u2026 and that\u2019s why the hurt and the shock and the sorrow run so deep and vast today. Sekou Smith died in Atlanta on Tuesday at 48. He left behind Heather, his wife; sons Gabriel and Cameron, and a daughter, Rielly. It\u2019s also a tough loss for the sports journalism community and his Turner and NBA families. This is just a sampling from those he touched and left an impression: Turner Sports president Lenny Daniels: \u201cTo anyone who knew Sekou, he was the utmost professional and someone who was so dedicated to his craft. He was well connected throughout the industry and his passion and love for the game was unwavering \u2026 beyond his many professional accomplishments, Sekou will be remembered as being such a wonderful person. His closest friends describe him as \u201ceveryone\u2019s best friend\u201d for how much he genuinely cared for others at all times. He had such a warm, engaging personality and an ability to truly connect with people.\u201d NBA commissioner Adam Silver: \u201cThe NBA mourns the passing of Sekou Smith, a beloved member of the NBA family. Sekou was one of the most affable and dedicated reporters in the NBA and a terrific friend to so many across the league. He covered the game for more than two decades, including the past 11 years with Turner Sports, where he showed his full range of skills as an engaging television analyst, podcast host and writer. Sekou\u2019s love of basketball was clear to everyone who knew him and it always shined through in his work. Our heartfelt condolences go to his wife, Heather, and their children, Gabriel, Rielly and Cameron.\u201d Steve Aschburner, senior writer for  NBA.com : \u201cI don\u2019t know anyone who moved more easily than Sekou through the many layers of the NBA, from players to coaches to front-office executives to agents to billionaire owners to fans to fellow media folks, all the while maintaining his integrity as a reporter and his great upbeat nature as a man \u2026 he was a true life force.\u201d Marc Spears, senior writer for The Undefeated: \u201cSekou was truly a brother to me. We started covering the NBA around the same time and been close for as long as I can remember. He always showed me a brotherly friendship, humility, honesty and humor. We debated on hoop, but always respected each other\u2019s opinion. He truly cared about how I was doing even during his tough days and rooted for your success and happiness. I\u2019m so glad we got to spend some time together in the (Orlando) bubble. So glad we were able to tell each other we love each other two weeks ago. Sekou truly made the world a better place. I\u2019m just stunned.\u201d John Schuhmann, senior writer, NBA.com : Sekou was my brother from another. We bonded from Day 1, mostly because he bonded with everybody from Day 1. I looked forward to every trip to The Finals or All-Star Weekend because I was going to spend extended time with my favorite person outside my own family \u2026 I will treasure every moment, even when I was talking to him and then turned to realize that he fell asleep. That dude had a remarkable ability to take naps anytime, anywhere, even when the BART train, with its hard plastic seats, was screeching along the path from San Francisco to Oakland. When something crazy happened in the NBA, it was Sekou whom I was immediately texting or calling. But our conversations went well beyond basketball and they helped me become the man, the husband and father that I am today. We were contemporaries, but I wanted to be like Sekou. I\u2019m going to miss him desperately.\u201d  Tim Frank, senior vice president, NBA communications: \u201cI think the word that you can\u2019t stress enough with Sekou is kindness. This business has become so fast paced with deadlines, story breaking, the rush of everything and it\u2019s easy to forget the human side, to go out of your way to just be nice to people. He never forgot that step. Ever. Always smiling, always laughing, always giving you that look when he thought you were BS\u2019ing him. But never anything but kind. He was everything that was right about this business and the NBA.\u201d There\u2019s so much more from so many others; their words and sentiment are aligned and shared. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so difficult to put these words together. It\u2019s nothing but angst when suddenly writing and speaking in the past-tense about someone you knew and admired. But it does allow you to relive memories and emotions and absorb the mammoth of good from this particular person. His wife and children and family need to know that, contrary to what Sekou Smith believed, it was he, not us, who was held in highest esteem in the company he kept. It was he who deserved the signature designation he freely gave to others. One boss. Our loss. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

LeVert will be out indefinitely and is expected to make a full recovery from the procedure, the Pacers said in a statement. LeVert was acquired by the Pacers in the four-team blockbuster trade that sent James Harden from the Houston Rockets to the Brooklyn Nets. During LeVert\u2019s physical to complete the trade, an MRI revealed a mass on his left kidney. He has not played in a game for the Pacers this season. LeVert was expected to replace Victor Oladipo (who was traded to Houston) and help replace forward T.J. Warren, who is out indefinitely after having surgery to repair a stress fracture in his left foot. Indiana is also dealing with an injury to All-Star forward Domantas Sabonis, who exited Monday\u2019s 129-114 win against the Toronto Raptors with a left knee contusion . Center Myles Turner, the NBA blocks leader, went down last weekend with a fractured right hand . Team officials said surgery won\u2019t be necessary and Turner has played and started each of Indiana\u2019s last three games.

Clippers (13-4) at Hawks (8-8), 7:30 p.m. ET, NBA TV \u2022 The Clippers begin a six-game road trip in Atlanta without Kawhi Leonard and Paul George due to health and safety protocols. Leonard and George have combined for 49.8 points per game this season. In 96 minutes with both Leonard and George off the court this season, the Clippers have been outscored by 38 points . Can the Clippers extend their seven-game win streak without their two All-Stars? \u2022 The Clippers have only three five-man lineups that have played at least 10 minutes together this season and do not include either Paul George or Kawhi Leonard. The most successful of those lineups \u2014 Lou Williams, Reggie Jackson, Ivica Zubac, Luke Kennard and Terance Mann \u2014 scored 31 points in 10 minutes on court together and outscored their opponents by six points. \u2022 Trae Young enters Tuesday ranked 13th in scoring (25.3 ppg) and fifth in assists (8.7 apg) with those assists creating 22.1 ppg. John Collins (1.9), De\u2019Andre Hunter (1.9) and Clint Capela (1.8) each receive nearly two assists per game from Young so far this season. \u2022 Clint Capela is second in the NBA in rebounding (14.5 rpg) as his average got a nice boost from his previous two games. After grabbing a career-best 26 rebounds in a win over Detroit, Capela collected 19 more two days later in Minnesota. Capela\u2019s 27-point, 26-reobund performance was the first of its kind in over a year in the NBA (Karl-Anthony Towns, Jan. 12, 2019) and just the 17th in since the 1983-84 season. The last Hawks player to put up those numbers in a game was Dikembe Mutombo (Dec. 14, 1999). \u2022 The Hawks rank second in the league in both offensive rebound percentage (30.3%) and second-chance points (15.4 per game). However, the Clippers rank seventh in defensive rebound percentage (75.6%) and allow the fewest second-chance points of any team this season (9.8 per game). The Clippers will be without two of their top three defensive rebounders \u2014 Paul George (5.7 per game) and Kawhi Leonard (4.4)."},{"id":482040,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/warriors-andrew-wiggins-benefiting-from-change-of-scenery","date":"2021-01-26","title":"Warriors' Andrew Wiggins benefiting from change of scenery","content":"Andrew Wiggins disappointed the Timberwolves and their fans Monday night, and he fully intends to do it again Wednesday. At this point, though, it\u2019s right there in his job description. Wiggins did to Minnesota what an actual opponent is supposed to do, playing well \u2014 23 points on 10-for-19 shooting, six rebounds, three steals, three blocks \u2013 in Golden State\u2019s 130-108 victory Monday at the Chase Center. The No. 1 pick in the 2014 Draft, who is facing his former team this week for the first time after spending his first seven seasons with the Wolves, will try to do as well or better Wednesday ( 10 p.m. ET, ESPN ). His performance might be cast as some sort of a \u201cTake that!\u201d to the organization that traded him last February to Golden State for point guard D\u2019Angelo Russell and a top-three protected 2021 first-round pick (it becomes unprotected in 2022 if it doesn\u2019t convey this year). Except for two things: 1. Wiggins has been having these types of games for a month now. 2. The Wolves rightfully should have as much of a beef with Wiggins as he might have with them. After his work Monday, Wiggins pointed to differences between the Warriors\u2019 and the Wolves\u2019 basketball operations as the primary reason for his more fully realized potential. Through 17 games, the 6-foot-7 wing is averaging 17.8 points, 5.1 rebounds, 2.2 assists and a career-best 1.6 blocks. He is scoring more efficiently, with a 55.5 true-shooting percentage built off his 40.7 percent 3-point accuracy. He\u2019s been lauded, too, by Warriors coach Steve Kerr and teammates for his defensive work, an area of some neglect during his time in Minnesota. \u201cIt\u2019s very positive over here, very positive, everyone\u2019s getting along,\u201d Wiggins said after his fourth 20-point performance this season. \u201cNo egos, nothing like that. Everyone just wants to win. It\u2019s just a winning attitude, winning culture, everything is about winning. And we all want to get better, everyone is lifting each other up, cheering for each other, so it\u2019s all love over here.\u201d Golden State acquired Wiggins into the void left by free agency, retirement, injuries and other trades. He had only 12 games to adjust before the NBA\u2019s virus shutdown in March. An extended layoff followed as the Warriors were not invited into the Orlando bubble restart. So with a training camp and preseason, quick as they were, the 25 year old finally is in sync with his new team. \u201cHe just fit what we needed desperately after the departures of Kevin [Durant], Shawn Livingston, Andre Iguodala, the injury to Klay [Thompson],\u201d Kerr told reporters before Monday\u2019s game. \u201cWe just had no size and athleticism on the wing. \u201cTotally different role than what Minnesota was asking of him. I always say, there\u2019s maybe 10 or 15 players in the league who determine the circumstances on a team. The other 450 are \u2026 people who excel based on their circumstances. With Andrew, our circumstances are perfect.\u201d One of Wiggins\u2019 four coaches in Minnesota, Tom Thibodeau, saw him up close last week when Thibodeau\u2019s Knicks team beat Golden State. Afterward, he talked with The Athletic\u2019s Ethan Strauss about Wiggins\u2019 improvements . \u201cHuge difference. He\u2019s grown,\u201d Thibodeau said. \u201cI think this environment is perfect for him. I think the job that Steve and his staff has done, they\u2019ve challenged him to grow. \u201cHis defense is vastly improved. His all-around play, too, and it will get better and better. Playing with guys like Steph and Draymond [Green] and when Klay\u2019s back, that\u2019s going to be a big bonus for him.\u201d It already has been. With Curry, Wiggins doesn\u2019t have to be Golden State\u2019s first offensive option the way he often was in Minnesota, and when Thompson gets back, he won\u2019t even need to be No. 2. With Green as Golden State\u2019s captain defensively, barking alignments and demanding effort, and with rookie James Wiseman as a rim protector allowing others to gamble or lock in on their men, Wiggins can focus on his specific matchups. As he sees it, though, it\u2019s a culture thing. The woebegone franchise in Minneapolis has had one winning season in 16 years. The one by the Bay went to five Finals every year from 2015 to 2019, won three titles and rapidly is picking itself up from last season\u2019s 15-50 record. Many of the pieces from the floor to the front office remain in place. \u201cFor sure it\u2019s different because everything here is organized,\u201d Wiggins said. \u201cYou know what you\u2019re doing every night, you know what you\u2019re getting yourself into, you know the minutes you\u2019re going to play, you know your rotation.\u201d Wiggins did carve out an exception Monday for Thibodeau with a little mutual admiration. \u201cThere was a couple years like that in Minnesota where you know everything,\u201d he said. \u201cThibs was very organized. And Thibs was very clear. He was very straightforward. \u201cThat\u2019s one thing they do here. They\u2019re very straightforward. They\u2019re not going to sugarcoat nothing. There\u2019s no trick questions. So it\u2019s good.\u201d Here, however, is where Wiggins and those telling his story get into the weeds a bit on his resurgence. Thibodeau was his coach in Minnesota for 204 of the player\u2019s 442 games there. He came in as a rookie in 2014 under Flip Saunders, who took the Wolves to eight consecutive playoff appearances in his first (1995-2005) stint with them. In 2015-16, when Saunders died from Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, Wiggins worked with one-time Coach of the Year Sam Mitchell. Then it was Thibodeau, who \u2013 despite Wiggins\u2019 praise \u2013 got the same \u201cempty calorie\u201d scoring and indifferent defense from him. The most familiar image of Wiggins, hands on hips during stoppages in play, says Mick Jagger more than Mike Jordan or even an NBA All-Star. No doubt, Wiggins\u2019 placid demeanor on the court has hurt him with fans and critics eager to see intensity to go along with his obvious skills. It\u2019s the same demeanor he shows off the court, too, never seeming to scowl at the guy in the mirror as Minnesota\u2019s losses mounted. Showing and saying more might have convinced people he cared as much as they did. \u201cAndrew\u2019s not an emotional guy,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cHe just sort of methodically does his job. He\u2019s done that in a really consistent manner for us. \u2026 Andrew is Andrew. He\u2019s going to go out there and do his job, and nothing much is going to bother him.\u201d Part of it, too, is that Wiggins wasn\u2019t the one who drafted him No. 1 (that was Cleveland) or traded for him that summer with the expectations he would be a franchise cornerstone. Had that 2014 Draft gone according to current NBA value, Joel Embiid, Nikola Jokic, Marcus Smart, Clint Capela and a few more would have bumped Wiggins and No. 2 pick Jabari Parker down to deep lottery status. Viewed that way, Wiggins shapes up as a fine Harrison Barnes surrogate for Golden State. He just happens to be getting paid like he\u2019s an all-NBA max guy (about $90 million for this season and two more on the five-year, $147 million extension he signed in October 2017). As it is, Wiggins has scored 2,267 more points and logged 4,157 more minutes than anyone else in the Class of \u201914. Ryan Saunders, Flip\u2019s son and Minnesota\u2019s coach who was on the bench through Wiggins\u2019 whole stay here, said: \u201cThey\u2019ve done a nice job, what they\u2019ve been able to do with him and with the guys they have surrounding him. It allows Andrew to play a role and expend maybe more energy on the defensive end. \u2026 Offensively, I think he\u2019s able to get action more in the flow of the offense, when teams are so keyed in on a guy like Steph. \u201cAnd hey, sometimes a change of scenery is good. Good for anybody.\u201d The Wolves saw Wiggins as the star they needed and were disappointed. The Warriors needed him as the complementary piece they saw and are delighted. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Denver coach Michael Malone seized control of the postgame Zoom call after Monday\u2019s 117-113 win over Dallas to extol the clutch performance of budding star Michael Porter Jr., who lit up the Mavericks for 30 points off the bench \u2014 including 18 in the second half \u2014 to emerge as the leading man in a blockbuster featuring Kia MVP candidates Luka Doncic and Nikola Jokic. \u201cUsually, you guys ask the first five questions about Michael,\u201d Malone said. \u201cSo, since you guys haven\u2019t brought it up, I\u2019ll speak about Michael: he was tremendous tonight. We don\u2019t win the game without Michael Porter having the game that he had.\u201d No doubt about that, as the Nuggets captured their third victory in four nights to run their winning streak to four. They accomplished the feat in the face of Doncic reeling off his 31st career triple-double, which tied John Havlicek for 13th most in NBA history. They did it without Jamal Murray on the floor in a back-and-forth game featuring six lead changes that was tied at 104 with just 4:58 left to play. \u201cThe bench played really good today,\u201d said Jokic, who registered his sixth straight game with 20 points and 10 rebounds. \u201cThey were amazing. He\u2019s making shots. I think the main thing is the confidence that he has. If he takes a tough shot, we kind of think that it can go in. He\u2019s really talented.\u201d Thanks to Porter\u2019s career-high tying 30 points off the bench in 28 minutes on 10-for-18 from the field and 6-for-10 from deep, Denver\u2019s reserves outscored Dallas\u2019 backups, 63-29. \u201cI definitely don\u2019t back away from the moment.\u201d Porter said. \u201cI\u2019m just as confident when there\u2019s two minutes left on the clock as when there\u2019s 20 minutes. Sometimes, you\u2019ll make those shots. Sometimes, you\u2019ll miss them. But I know I can get my shot off. So, I\u2019m gonna shoot it if I\u2019m open. That\u2019s what my team expects me to do.\u201d Denver\u2019s drama all started with 4:51 remaining in the third quarter with it leading 80-73, when Murray was ejected for a flagrant 2 foul after delivering a vicious shot to the groin area of Tim Hardaway Jr. Murray contributed 16 points on 7-for-11 shooting in 25 minutes prior to the ejection. But Hardaway seemed to turn the ejection into a momentum flipping run for Dallas by scoring nine straight points, helping the Mavericks take a two-point lead in just 1:12 of gametime. That wouldn\u2019t stop Porter from lifting Denver with his seven points in the third quarter, as the Nuggets trailed by just two entering the final frame. Porter shot on 3-for-5 from deep in the fourth quarter for 11 points, including a corner dagger with 41.8 seconds left to put Denver ahead by seven, 114-107. \u201cI would say as opposed to appreciating it, I expect it,\u201d Malone said. \u201cMichael Porter was a starter at the beginning of the year. Obviously, he missed a ton of time due to COVID[-19] protocols. I think he missed 10 games to start the month of January. We were playing really well at the time. So, I decided to keep him coming off the bench; stay with that group. Everybody gets caught up in who starts. If you have a chance to close a game, that\u2019s more important than hearing your name before a game in an arena with no fans. \u201cI\u2019m not surprised by anything Michael does. He\u2019s supremely talented. That\u2019s why he earned that starting small forward position. This is one of the games where Michael took over and had big, big plays that allowed us to stay close and ultimately allowed us to win the game at the end.\u201d That\u2019s quite the turn. During the time away, Porter, who averaged 19.5 points and 6.8 rebounds over the first four games, couldn\u2019t even practice or work out with the team. \u201cHe didn\u2019t skip a beat,\u201d said JaMychal Green, who had 17 points and eight rebounds in 22 minutes off the bench. \u201cI don\u2019t know if he\u2019s got a gym at his own house or whatever, but it seems like he hasn\u2019t missed a game; came back and he\u2019s been playing big for us.\u201d Porter, 22, entered the league\u2019s health and safety protocol on Dec. 29, and he returned to Denver winning four of six games. With Porter leading the way Monday, the Nuggets bench knocked down 11 of the team\u2019s 15 3-pointers. The bench also accounted for seven of Denver\u2019s nine steals, with Porter chipping in two. The Nuggets are 9-3 over their last 12 games, and 3-0 with Porter back in the mix. \u201cMy whole mindset just since I started playing was just contribute in any way I can,\u201d Porter said. \u201cComing back into the rotation, I had been out so long, that was my mindset. I just wanted to come in and give a spark off the bench. Some nights, it\u2019ll be my night. Some nights, it\u2019ll be other people\u2019s night.\u201d * * * Michael C.

What followed was arguably James\u2019 most impressive game since joining the Lakers. James started fast with 17 points in the first quarter and went on tear in the fourth on his former home court, scoring 23 of his 46 points to keep the Los Angeles Lakers unbeaten on the road with a 115-108 victory over the Cavaliers. James\u2019 season-high 46 came on 19-of-26 shooting from the field, including 7-of-11 from beyond the arc. He also added eight rebounds, six assists, two blocks and two steals.   With the game in doubt, James made 9 of 10 shots over the final 12 minutes, posing to hold his form after draining a 34-footer from the Cavs\u2019 logo as the shot clock expired to put the Lakers ahead 103-98. James followed that with a step-back 3 and then buried a fadeaway turn-around jumper in the corner before shaking his head at Cleveland\u2019s bench.

The official closest to the contact blew the whistle to stop play with 4:51 left in the third quarter and conferred with the other referees. The initial call was a foul on Murray, and it was upgraded to a flagrant-two foul on a video review. Murray had 16 points when he was ejected, his same team-leading total from halftime.

And Monday was that day. Natalie Sago and Jenna Schroeder made up two-thirds of the crew assigned to the Charlotte at Orlando game, the first time in NBA history that two women were assigned to work a regular-season contest together. Sean Wright was picked to be crew chief, Sago the referee and Schroeder the umpire. Sago and Schroeder have worked games together before; they were part of three-woman crews in the G League. But at the NBA level, it\u2019s a first \u2014 and it\u2019s a game they\u2019ve been looking forward to since they saw it on the internally distributed schedule a month ago.

The Yahoo database will be utilized, and only players rostered in less than 50% of leagues will be mentioned. James Ennis (SG\/SF \u2013 ORL): 0% rostered Ennis has started eight games this season, but over the past three games, he\u2019s played 24, 28, and 28 minutes. Before that, he had played 20 minutes just once. Now, Ennis is a low usage player and hasn\u2019t scored in double-figures yet, but he provides some 3-pointers and rebounds and can trip into some counting stats by just being out there on the court. Taurean Prince (SF\/PF \u2013 CLE): 18% rostered Since being traded to Cleveland, Prince has played 32 and 22 minutes. He\u2019s stuffed the stat sheet and scored double-figures in each game. Now, he\u2019s shot 55% and 60% from the field, which isn\u2019t going to continue, considering Prince is a career 41% shooter. He has benefitted some from the injuries that the Cavs are experiencing, but he\u2019s providing across-the-board production for now. Naz Reid (C \u2013 MIN): 22% rostered It ain\u2019t hard to tell that Naz can produce when given a chance. He has started the past four games as Karl-Anthony Towns has dealt with both a wrist injury and COVID. We aren\u2019t sure when Towns will return, so Reid should continue to start and play around 28 minutes per game in the interim. In his seven games as a starter, he has averaged 13.6 points, 1.3 three-pointers, 4.4 rebounds, 1.7 assists, 0.9 steals, and 1.6 blocks while shooting 57% from the field and 93% from the free-throw line. Wayne Ellington (SG\/SF \u2013 DET): 18% rostered It\u2019s Wayne\u2019s World, and we\u2019re all just living in it. Ellington has started the past six games and played 28, 33, 33, 28, and 26 minutes the past five games. Over the past four games, he\u2019s averaged 18.8 points, 5.3 3-pointers, 2.8 rebounds, 1.8 assists, and 0.8 steals. He\u2019s converted 55% of his 10.8 shot attempts. What in Wayne\u2019s World is going on here? Regression is coming, as Ellington is a career 41% shooter from the field, but as long as he\u2019s playing over 30 minutes a game, he has utility. Jeff Green (SF\/PF\/C \u2013 BKN): 25% rostered Green had started nine straight games before relinquishing that role when Kevin Durant returned. He has still been an integral part of the rotation, though, as he\u2019s played 26 minutes the past two games and played some small-ball center. Green has scored in double figures in both games and provided some three-pointers, rebounds, and excellent field goal percentage. The Nets are playing at the fifth-fastest pace, and their defense hasn\u2019t been good, so many shootouts and offensive possessions make for a juicy fantasy environment. Joe Ingles (SG\/SF \u2013 UTA): 34% rostered Ingles can provide points, three-pointers, and assists. Unfortunately, he\u2019s played fewer than 20 minutes in each of the past three games. Now, he did have an Achilles injury that forced him to miss four games this season, so there\u2019s a chance he\u2019s just getting ramped up again. He did play over 32 minutes in two games earlier in the season. With that said, a floor of 18 minutes seems likely with the upside for more. Carmelo Anthony (SF\/PF \u2013 POR): 37% rostered With CJ McCollum down, Anthony has been asked to pick up some of the slack, as he\u2019s played 26 and 29 minutes the past two games. Before that, he was playing around 20-21 minutes. We know what Anthony can do, which is get buckets. He\u2019s also provided some steals and blocks this season. The shooting efficiency is volatile, though, as he will shoot 36% in one game then 45% the following night. Rudy Gay (SF\/PF \u2013 SA): 30% rostered On the season, Gay is averaging 22.6 minutes per game. He has a high of 28 minutes and played 26 last game, but he will often play just 17 minutes. With that said, he\u2019s been mighty productive when he\u2019s been on the court, contributing points, 3-pointers, and rebounds. He\u2019s heavily involved and has attempted more than 10 shots in nine games. Rodney Hood (SG\/SF \u2013 POR): 16% rostered Hood received the start for McCollum and played 25 minutes. He scored 21 points and contributed two 3-pointers, two rebounds, two assists, and one steal. The Trail Blazers had keep Hood under wraps for most of the season as he was recovering from Achilles and quad injuries, so it\u2019s encouraging they felt comfortable giving him the start with an elevated workload. It remains to be seen if this will be the New World Order, but it doesn\u2019t hurt to find out. Jeremy Lamb (SG\/SF \u2013 IND): 39% rostered Since returning from injury, Lamb has played 19, 28, and 20 minutes. He\u2019s also scored in double-figures in every game, with a high of 22 points. Lamb can provide 3-pointers, rebounds, and some defensive stats. He\u2019s also shot at least 50% in each game, which likely won\u2019t continue since he\u2019s a career-44% shooter, but it\u2019s a good sign nonetheless. With TJ Warren out, Lamb could soak up most of his minutes when he\u2019s up to speed. Devin Vassell (SG \u2013 SA): 4% rostered Need steals? Look no further. Vassell has 20 steals on the season and has gotten one in 12 straight games. He has a streak of at least two steals in four consecutive games. Over the past six games, Vassell has averaged 23 minutes per game with two games over 26. The points won\u2019t be voluminous since he\u2019s a low usage player, but Vassell will contribute some three-pointers and rebounds to go along with the steals."},{"id":481428,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/fanduel-dfs-values-of-the-night-monday-jan-25","date":"2021-01-25","title":"FanDuel DFS Values Of The Night: Monday (Jan. 25)","content":"George Hill (OKC) at POR: $4,300 Hill is coming off a 22-point performance \u2014 his highest scoring output of the season. He\u2019s reasonably priced in an excellent game environment. Carsen Edwards (BOS) at CHI: $3,700 With Kemba Walker (rest) and Payton Pritchard (knee) out against Chicago, Edwards should see a boost in usage tonight. At just $3.7K, he\u2019s a solid value in a game with a 229.5 over\/under after scoring 18 points in Sunday\u2019s win. Kendrick Nunn (MIA) at BKN: $6,500 Across his last four games, Nunn has averaged a healthy 37.4 FD points while handling a heavy offensive workload for Miami. Facing a weak Brooklyn defense, he makes a great play on tonight\u2019s slate. Rodney Hood (POR) vs. OKC: $5,000 Hood has started both of Portland\u2019s contests since CJ McCollum has been sidelined, and he scored 21 points in his first game with the starting five a week ago. Wayne Ellington (DET) vs. PHI: $4,700 Ellington has been on fire as of late, averaging 18.8 points and 25.7 FD points across his last four games. In that span, he\u2019s knocked down 21 triples. He comes in as a huge value at this price point. Malik Beasley (MIN) at GSW: $6,400 Beasley has been a primary scoring option for Minnesota this season, and he\u2019s got 45-point upside. If D\u2019Angelo Russell (quad) is unable to play, Beasley becomes an even more valuable play. Michael Porter (DEN) at DAL: $6,400 In his second game back, MPJ went 14\/11 with a block and steal across 35 minutes. He\u2019ll look to build on that performance with a quality matchup against Dallas tonight. Luguentz Dort (OKC) at POR: $4,900 Dort is an inconsistent scorer, but when his shot is falling, he\u2019s got 50-point upside thanks to heavy minutes and defensive abilities. He\u2019s worth a look in GPPs against Portland\u2019s barely-there defense. Jarred Vanderbilt (MIN) at GSW: $5,400 Vanderbilt has started each of the Wolves\u2019 last four games, logging 23.8 minutes and 28.3 FD points per contest in the process. He went off for 16\/11 with two steals and a block Saturday, and he\u2019ll look to build on that solid showing in a great matchup with the Warriors tonight. Isaiah Roby (OKC) at POR: $4,500 Across his last five games (all starts), Roby has put up 26.3 FD points across 26 minutes per game while averaging 10.6 points, 7.2 boards, 3.0 assists, and 1.2 swipes. With Al Horford still out due to the birth of his child, expect Roby to log another start. Enes Kanter (POR) vs. OKC: $6,500 Kanter should continue to play solid minutes for Portland as its frontcourt anchor, and with CJ McCollum still out, the big man could find additional opportunities on offense. There\u2019s a lot to like for Kanter tonight as he faces his former team \u2013 the rebuilding Thunder. Naz Reid (MIN) at GSW: $5,000 After a slow start to the season, Reid has turned it on as of late, averaging 32.5 FD points across his last three games. With Karl-Anthony Towns still out due to health and safety protocols, Reid has a chance to smash value at his meager price. James Wiseman (GSW) vs. MIN: $4,900 Wiseman has averaged just under 30 FD points across his last three games, and tonight he faces one of the Association\u2019s most generous defenses to opposing big men.

Adebayo scored 11 points on 5-6 shooting against Jordan and had 17 points on 6-8 FG, 5-5 FT against Green. \u2022 Brooklyn enters the week as the highest scoring team in the NBA, averaging 120.3 points per game, while Miami ranks 21st at 109.3 ppg. The Nets own the top true shooting percentage in the NBA at 61.3%, which would be the top mark since at least 1996-97. The only team to post a TS% above 60% for a season since 1996-97 was the 2017-18 Warriors (60.3%). \u2022 Since the Nets acquired James Harden, Joe Harris has averaged 6.5 open 3-point attempts per game \u2013 with the closest defender at least four feet away. Harris is shooting 14-26 (53.8%) on those open looks. Prior to the Harden acquisition, Harris averaged 4.5 open 3-point attempts per game. Timberwolves (4-11) at Warriors (8-8), 10:00 p.m. ET, NBA TV \u2022 This is the first ever meeting between the top two picks in the 2020 NBA Draft \u2013 No. 1 Anthony Edwards of the Wolves and No. 2 James Wiseman of the Warriors. They rank the same way in rookie scoring with Edwards first (12.1 ppg) and Wiseman second (11.8 ppg). Wiseman also leads all rookies in blocks (1.4 rpg) and ranks second in rebounds (6.1 rpg). \u2022 The shorthanded Timberwolves snapped a four-game losing streak on Saturday with a 120-110 win over New Orleans. Naz Reid matched his career high with 20 points; Jarred Vanderbilt posted career highs of 16 points and 11 boards; and rookie Anthony Edwards had 18 points, his highest scoring game since his career-high 26 on Jan. 7. \u2022 Stephen Curry leads the Warriors in scoring at 27.9 points per game ( 4th in NBA ), followed by Andrew Wiggins at 17.4 ppg. The 10.5 ppg gap between Golden State\u2019s first- and second-leading scorers is the second largest in the NBA. The only larger gap comes from Washington, where league-leading scorer Bradley Beal (34.5 ppg) averages 16.5 more points than the Wizards\u2019 second-leading scorer Russell Westbrook (18.0). \u2022 On Saturday, Stephen Curry passed Reggie Miller for second place on the NBA career 3-point list . With 2,562 career triples entering this week, Curry trails Ray Allen by 411 for the all-time record of 2,973. At his current pace ( 4.2 3s per game ), Curry would need 98 games to catch Allen. \u2022 The Wolves allow the second-highest field goal percentage at the rim this season (66.9%), while the Warriors allow the eighth-lowest (60.2%)."},{"id":481367,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nba-players-week-5-nikola-jokic-joel-embiid","date":"2021-01-25","title":"Nikola Jokic, Joel Embiid named NBA Players of the Week","content":"Denver Nuggets center Nikola Jokic and Philadelphia 76ers center Joel Embiid were named the NBA Players of the Week for Week 5.

That will be Friday, unless several more games are postponed. The quarter pole is usually when teams can make a real determination of where they stand. But things are obviously different this season. Not only have there been postponements and extended absences due to the coronavirus, but this is the first season of the new play-in rules. So instead of drawing just one line after the top eight teams in each conference, we have to imagine two lines: one that separates the top six from the rest of the group, and another for the play-in teams from seventh to 10th place. That makes everything more cloudy, especially in the East, where the defending conference champs currently sit in 13th place at 6-9 . Only five East teams have winning records and those 13th-place Miami Heat are just a game and a half behind the sixth-place Cleveland Cavaliers. The situation in the West is a little more clear and perhaps a lot more sobering for the 5-10, 14th-place New Orleans Pelicans. Where things are really interesting is at the top, where the LA Clippers, Los Angeles Lakers and Utah Jazz all have just four losses. Those three teams lead this week\u2019s rankings, with the champs remaining at the top for the sixth straight week after a big win in Milwaukee.

And then, after he finished a brilliant sequence of shot-making, there was an anonymous voice from the crowd that yelled something in his direction, two words actually, which somehow came through clear and concise amid all the other noise: \u201cYoung Bull!\u201d The players on the Pebblebrook High School basketball team suddenly got rabbit ears and hesitated, as did their coach, George Washington, and their heads made a collective swivel in the direction of the teenager about whom the outburst was intended. After the game, those two words, that complimentary nickname, stuck with them, and they made sure it stuck on him. Young Bull! the players repeated, laughing admirably while pointing and teasing. \u201cEveryone else on the team already had a nickname,\u201d Washington said, \u201cand that was his, from that day forward.\u201d And so \u201cYoung Bull\u201d it was for Collin Sexton, then and especially now, five years later and two levels of basketball higher. That\u2019s because: He is indeed young, just 22, and definitely bullish, his stock rising with the Cavaliers after his 42-point takedown of Kyrie Irving and the Brooklyn Nets last week, banging the drum on what appears to be a breakout season, his third in the league. Everything is up for Sexton: Scoring, shooting, maturity, impact, presence. Here in the second of two rebuilding projects following the two departures of LeBron James, Sexton is the foundational piece the Cavs crave and need as they seek respectability and a better place in the standings. Surely, LeBron himself will notice the change in the mood surrounding his former team when he and the Lakers visit Cleveland on Monday ( 8 ET, NBA League Pass ). The Cavs, currently No. 6 in the Eastern Conference, have hope \u2014 perhaps even more than they did when LeBron took his talents to Miami in 2011 and the club cratered. What\u2019s curious about that unremarkable stage is the Cavs used the No. 1 overall pick in 2011 on Irving, who was unable to take the club anywhere special. The Cavs never made the playoffs with Irving until LeBron became homesick and returned in 2014. Maybe this time sans LeBron will be different and better. If so, it starts with Sexton, who isn\u2019t physically imposing at 6-foot-1 or gifted with Kyrie-like handles or astonishing quickness. Yet his instincts serve him well, and he\u2019s becoming better at creating space between himself and the defender. Plus, his comfort spots on the floor have multiplied. \u201cHe\u2019s a walking bucket,\u201d Cavs coach JB Bickerstaff said. \u201cThere are certain people who have a knack for putting the ball in the basket all sorts of ways. The kid is not afraid of the biggest moments.\u201d As for self-belief? \u201cConfidence is one thing that kid does not lack \u2026 and for good reason,\u201d said Cavs forward Larry Nance Jr. This surge actually began in Sexton\u2019s high school junior year. He and his family moved a short distance to Mableton, just outside Atlanta, partly so Sexton could transfer and be teammates with Jared Harper, now a two-way player with the Knicks. His new coach had an inkling that Sexton could be special, a bolt of lightning that hit Washington quickly. \u201cIt was the first time I saw him, pretty much the moment he walked into the gym that August, because he had a certain presence right away,\u201d Washington said. \u201cBy September, the very next month, I called eight colleges and said the best guard who ever played for me is in the gym and y\u2019all need to come see him play.\u201d Sexton and Pebblebrook lost the state championship game and the kid was crushed \u2026 and determined. The sweat equity from that tough ensuing summer resulted in Sexton becoming one of the top players in the country and getting invites to camps held by Chris Paul and LeBron James and a spot on the 2016 FIBA U17 national team . Washington said Sexton would invent ways to motivate himself, and when those tactics were exhausted, Washington would create others. \u201cMe or one of my assistant coaches would say, \u2018Hey Collin, there\u2019s a guy in the stands who thinks you stink and he don\u2019t understand all the hype.\u2019 Collin would say \u2018Who, where?\u2019 Then he\u2019d run off some points. Once I told him, \u2018You can\u2019t get 10 assists.\u2019 He\u2019d say, \u2018What? You crazy.\u2019 By halftime he\u2019d have 10 assists. There were a lot of times I\u2019d put him on the worst team in practice and he always won.\u201d At Alabama, Sexton was tutored by former Spurs guard Avery Johnson for a one-and-done. From there, it was off to the NBA, where the Cavs took him eighth in the 2018 draft. Each season since, Sexton\u2019s numbers across the board have increased. He\u2019s averaging 25.5 points per game, up from 20.8 ppg in 2019-20 and 16.7 ppg as a rookie. He\u2019s now the first option on the Cavs, the player with the ball whenever the game\u2019s on the line. And around the league, his visibility and respect is rising. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t care about none of that,\u201d said Washington. \u201cHe says, \u2018OK, whatever.\u2019 All he wants to do is work out and play the game. That\u2019s all.\u201d True enough, Sexton remains rather soft-spoken and seemingly unaffected by it all. In that sense, he\u2019s much older than he appears. That said, he obviously knows his worth to the Cavs and how crucial his development is to their future. His 42-point game last week was one of the best in team history. At one stretch he scored 20 straight points, a wrecking ball that the Nets couldn\u2019t avoid, and the irony of doing that against Irving wasn\u2019t lost on him. \u201cI am in Cleveland, I do wear No. 2, and I do wear Kyrie\u2019s (shoes),\u201d Sexton said. \u201cThat\u2019s gonna be linked together. I just got to take it. I can\u2019t control what people say, but I can control what I do. I definitely accepted the challenge, and I knew it wasn\u2019t gonna be easy.\u201d Two nights later, Sexton followed up with 25 points and nine assists in the Cavs\u2019 second straight win over Brooklyn. That continued a streak in which he scored at least 20 points in every game. \u201cWhen I\u2019m out there, I play with a chip on my shoulder regardless of the situation,\u201d Sexton said. \u201cI know what I want to be in the future \u2026 I fuel myself. I know I want to be pretty good. And I want to do whatever it takes for the team to win. I\u2019m more like a team person. I want to win.\u201d As the Cavs move toward the future, they\u2019re stuck with a pair of elephants in the room. Andre Drummond and Kevin Love, at this point, are relics: outdated veterans who don\u2019t fit the movement and whose bloated salaries would be best relocated elsewhere. It\u2019s not like the Cavs haven\u2019t tried to trade either in the past and perhaps this time they\u2019ll get lucky before the March trade deadline. (Drummond comes off the books this summer, while Love\u2019s contract \u2014 $31.3 million this season and next and $28.9 million in 2022-23 \u2014 is more cumbersome). After cutting their losses on troubled Kevin Porter Jr. via a trade last week , Nance, Sexton, Isaac Okoro, Cedi Osman, Jarrett Allen and Darius Garland are the young core for now and the future. Sexton, at this point, is the centerpiece. He could become the first Cavaliers player not named LeBron or Kyrie to be named an All-Star since Zydrunas Ilgauskas in 2003. There\u2019s a big push for that in Cleveland, and also in a school on the outskirts of Atlanta. \u201cObviously,\u201d Washington said, \u201cwe want him to be a perennial All Star and make the playoffs. And there are goals he set that he has yet to accomplish. He wants to be the face of the franchise and he wants to win. That\u2019s well within his reach, and we expect it to happen.\u201d * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

The Memphis Grizzlies aren\u2019t ready yet. Washington played at San Antonio on Sunday night, the Wizards\u2019 first game in 13 days after seeing six players test positive for COVID-19 and three others having to miss several days following contact tracing. The Grizzlies won\u2019t play until at least Saturday, after the NBA called off yet another game \u2014 the 20th since Jan. 10 and the 21st postponement this season. Memphis was scheduled to play Sunday and Monday at home against Sacramento. Those were called off late last week and now, the Grizzlies\u2019 home game against Chicago that was scheduled for Wednesday is off as well. The NBA said the Wednesday game was called off \u201cdue to contact tracing within the Grizzlies and the length of time preceding the game during which Memphis will be unable to practice.\u201d It was the sixth postponement for the Grizzlies, matching Washington for the most in the NBA. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a challenge,\u201d Washington coach Scott Brooks said Sunday night in San Antonio. \u201cIt\u2019s not where we want to be \u2014 but we get to play again and that\u2019s the bottom line. It\u2019s been a long time. We missed it. It\u2019s good to be back.\u201d The earliest Memphis will play again is Saturday, also in San Antonio. Having six games called off in the season\u2019s first half means, if the Grizzlies and Wizards are to play the full 72-game schedule, they would have 41 games in a 67-day span in the second half. \u201cI just hope that we never have to deal with this again,\u201d Brooks said. Later this week, the NBA and National Basketball Players Association are expected to consider whether the stiffer protocols that were put in place Jan. 12 can be loosened in some way. They were originally put in place in an effort to curb travel to anywhere except games, practices and workouts as the league\u2019s number of virus-related issues started climbing. No fewer than 75 players \u2014 roughly 16% of the league \u2014 have already been on injury reports this season in accordance with the league\u2019s health and safety protocols. Reasons for missed games can include positive COVID-19 tests, inconclusive tests and contact tracing showing that a player may have been exposed to someone who had contracted the virus. Some players have missed 10 games already, including Denver\u2019s Michael Porter Jr. and Chicago teammates Tomas Satoransky and Chandler Hutchison. Porter and Satoransky played Friday; Hutchison was eligible to play that night as well but did not get into the Bulls\u2019 game. Other top players still out because of virus-related reasons include Boston\u2019s Jayson Tatum, Miami\u2019s Jimmy Butler and Minnesota\u2019s Karl-Anthony Towns \u2014 who revealed earlier this month that he tested positive, the latest blow to his family after seven of his relatives, including his mother, have died from COVID-19 since the pandemic began. In all, 23 teams have seen at least one game called off so far this season. The only exceptions: Brooklyn, New York, Toronto, Denver, San Antonio, the Los Angeles Clippers and the Los Angeles Lakers. And the league last week announced that it was pushing back start times for 20 upcoming games, moves made in large part to allow additional time for game-day tests to be processed and returned. A similar move was made last week when a Detroit-Miami game was delayed five hours. Postponed games, when possible, will be made up in the second half of the season that starts March 11 and runs through May 16. Players who test positive must go through a battery of cardiac and other tests before being cleared to return. Those who miss time for contact tracing must quarantine for a number of days as determined by the league based on their situation and continue to return negative COVID-19 tests before being able to play again."},{"id":480937,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/bulls-grizzlies-game-postponed-for-health-and-safety-protocols","date":"2021-01-25","title":"Bulls-Grizzlies game postponed for Health and Safety Protocols","content":"The National Basketball Association game scheduled for Wed., Jan. 27 between the Chicago Bulls and Memphis Grizzlies at FedExForum has been postponed in accordance with the league\u2019s Health and Safety Protocols.

The Heat will use coronavirus-sniffing dogs at AmericanAirlines Arena to screen fans who want to attend their games. They\u2019ve been working on the plan for months, and the highly trained dogs have been in place for some games this season where the team has allowed a handful of guests \u2014 mostly friends and family of players and staff. Starting this week, a limited number of ticket holders will be in the seats as well, provided they get past the dogs first. \u201cIf you think about it, detection dogs are not new,\u201d said Matthew Jafarian, the Heat\u2019s executive vice president for business strategy. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen them in airports, they\u2019ve been used in mission critical situations by the police and the military. We\u2019ve used them at the arena for years to detect explosives.\u201d The first Heat game with ticket holders is set for Thursday against the Los Angeles Clippers. Monday is the first day that season ticket holders will be able to start securing their seats. The Heat have sold out 451 consecutive games, the sixth-longest streak in NBA history. Sellouts, obviously, aren\u2019t happening this year. The Heat will keep attendance under 2,000 for now, or less than 10% of the building\u2019s typical capacity. \u201cPlease note that seating will be very limited, as we will be observing proper physical distancing,\u201d the team said in its letter to season ticket holders. The coronavirus-sniffing dog idea has been put into place at airports in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, and Helsinki, Finland, in recent months. At Heat games, fans arriving for the game will be brought to a screening area and the detection dogs will walk past. If the dog keeps going, the fan is cleared; if the dog sits, that\u2019s a sign it\u2019s detected the virus and the fan will be denied entry. Other protocols the Heat will use: A health screening questionnaire will be mandatory for all guests, masks must be worn continually and only soda and water will be sold. All transactions will be cashless and if a fan feels ill during a game, isolation rooms will be available. And if a fan is allergic to or afraid of dogs, the Heat are offering an option to skip the dog screening and submit to a rapid antigen test instead. The Heat say those tests can be processed in less than 45 minutes. Dogs have a superior sense of smell, which is why they\u2019re often used by law enforcement to find everything from drugs to bombs to missing people. Medical researchers have long reaped the benefit of canine sniffing, training some dogs to detect when a human is dealing with things like too much stress, too little blood sugar and even certain cancers. A German study last year found that dogs there were right 94% of the time when it came to coronavirus detection. \u201cResearchers are finding that specially trained dogs can detect COVID on humans quickly and accurately,\u201d Jafarian said."},{"id":480781,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/fanduel-dfs-values-of-the-night-sunday-jan-24","date":"2021-01-24","title":"FanDuel DFS Values Of The Night: Sunday (Jan. 24)","content":"Damian Lillard (POR) vs. NYK: $9,700 Lillard should go crazy with so many injuries in Portland and that will land him a spot in the studs section later on.

Miller made 2,560 3-pointers over 1,389 regular season games during his 18-year NBA career; Curry passed him in his 715 th career game, coming early in his 12 th NBA season. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty dope,\u201d Curry said after the game (the Jazz beat the Warriors 127-108 ). \u201cWe got our head beat tonight, but I was trying to still enjoy it. After I made the third one, I knew that was a big one, and then to make that fourth one in the third quarter was pretty special. Something I\u2019ve been looking forward to for a very long time.\u201d With Miller in his rearview, the only player that stands between Curry and the title of 3-point king is another legendary shooter \u2014 Ray Allen, who holds the top spot with 2,973 career 3s. With a cushion of over 400 3-pointers made, Allen\u2019s title should remain safe for 2021, but it\u2019s only a matter of time before Curry claims the record for himself. At Curry\u2019s current 3-point pace (4.1 3PM per game), he would need just over 100 games to catch Allen. With only 57 games remaining in this shortened 72-game season, Curry would likely not challenge Allen\u2019s record until the second half of the 2021-22 season. What separates Curry from Miller and Allen is the pace at which he has climbed the all-time leaderboard. While Miller and Allen utilized the 3-point shot as part of their game, Curry was part of a 3-point revolution thanks to his shooting ability and a rising emphasis on the 3-point shot. To put it simply \u2014 he changed the game. Over the past six seasons, Curry has averaged at least 9.8 3-point attempts per game each year and has three seasons averaging at least 11 3s per game. By comparison, Miller\u2019s career-high in 3-point attempts for a season was 6.6 in 1996-97 (3 rd in NBA), while Allen\u2019s was 8.4 in 2005-06 (1 st in NBA by 1.6 3PA). But Curry\u2019s rise is not only attributed to a higher volume of 3-point attempts. The reason Curry is nearly universally regarded as the greatest shooter of all time is that he matches his high volume with historic accuracy. Curry is a career 43.3% shooter from distance, compared to 39.5% for Miller and 40.0% for Allen. Curry\u2019s 43.3% career 3-point percentage ranks seventh all-time and leads all players ranked in the top 200 in 3-pointers made. Curry has a strong connection with the top two players on the all-time 3-point percentage list: No. 1 is his head coach Steve Kerr (45.4%) and No. 2 is his younger brother Seth (44.9%), who is shooting a league-best 59.6% this season from 3 for the Philadelphia 76ers. It\u2019s his combination of high volume and incredible accuracy that are the key reasons why Curry needed only 715 games to surpass the career total that Miller accumulated over 1,389 games. And it\u2019s also the reason why Curry will be the first player to eclipse 3,000 career 3-pointers made and will set the standard that all other shooters will have to chase.  Assuming Curry does catch and pass Allen to establish a new record for career 3-pointers, there are two lingering questions that will remain: 1. How high will he set the mark? 2. Which current players will have a shot at catching him in the future? Let\u2019s go back to the all-time leaderboard for 3-pointers made, but rather than track totals we\u2019ll look at per game averages instead. The 14 players with the highest 3-pointers made per game are all active players before we get to Allen at No. 15. Let\u2019s take a closer look at the top 10 on that list and see which players may have a shot at catching Curry. With the lead that Curry currently holds and showing no signs of slowing down, it is tough to see fellow veteran players catching him. Harden is currently fifth all time and trails Curry by nearly 200 3-pointers made. After making 3s at a ridiculous pace during his final two seasons in Houston (4.8 per game in 2018-19, 4.4 per game in 2019-20), Harden is now adjusting to a new role in Brooklyn and has averaged 3.2 3PM so far this season. If we remove the veterans from the list (Thompson, Lillard, Harden and George), then we can focus on the younger players that were influenced by Curry\u2019s game as they watched him on their journey to the NBA. These players have not only been influenced by Curry, they are spending their entire careers in an NBA that has embraced the 3-point shot like never before. Earlier this week, Donovan Mitchell passed Buddy Hield\u2019s record for fewest games needed to reach 600 career 3-pointers \u2013 hitting the milestone in 240 games compared to Hield\u2019s 244. Mitchell is not known as a 3-point specialist, but because the 3-point shot is such a big part of everybody\u2019s game now, his pace is faster than the players that came before him \u2014 similar to how Curry has passed Miller and is set to pass Allen. Two players to keep an eye on are the two youngest players on that top 10 list \u2014 Atlanta\u2019s Trae Young (22) and Dallas\u2019 Luka Doncic (21). Both players are in their third season in the league and can drain 3-pointers at will. Their combination of 3-point volume and youth give them the best chance to challenge Curry.  1. Double-Digit 3-Point Shooting Games Curry has 15 of the 56 games in NBA history when a player has made at least 10 3-pointers in a game. The next ranked player is his teammate Klay Thompson with five, followed by the trio of Damian Lillard, James Harden and JR Smith with three each and Zach LaVine with two. No other player has more than one game with at least 10 3-pointers made. Thompson holds the record for most 3-pointers made in a single game (14) with Curry and LaVine right behind him with 13 3s. Curry was the first player to reach 13 3-pointers as he set a new record on Nov. 7, 2016 when he shot 13-for-17 from beyond the arc in a win over the Pelicans. Thompson would top the record two years later and LaVine would tie Curry in 2019. 2. Playoff 3-Pointers Made Keep in mind that all of the numbers discussed so far are for regular season games only, and do not count Curry\u2019s record 470 3-pointers made in the NBA Playoffs. Curry racked up his 470 3s over 112 career playoff games (4.2 3PM per game); he is followed by LeBron James, who has 414 3s in 260 career playoff games (1.6 per game). As for the legend he just passed, Reggie Miller ranks sixth in playoff 3s with 320 in 144 games (2.2 per game); and the legend he\u2019s still chasing in regular season 3s, Ray Allen, ranks third in playoff 3s with 385 in 171 games (2.3 per game). 3. Most 3-Pointers Made in a Season There have been four seasons in NBA history when a player has made at least 300 3-pointers \u2013 Curry accounts for three of the four, with James Harden being the only other member of the club. In 2015-16, Curry not only became the first-and-only unanimous selection for the Kia Most Valuable Player award, he also set the record for 3-pointers made in a season as he shot 402-for-886 (45.4%) from beyond the arc over 79 games. Harden ranks second with 378 3s in 2018-19; in the same season Curry posted the third-most 3s in a season with 354; and in 2016-17 Curry made 324. Not only does Curry own three of the top four seasons in total 3-pointers made, he also holds six of the top 20 spots on the list. Harden holds four of the top 20, while Buddy Hield and Klay Thompson are the only other players with more than one spot in the top 20. 4. Most Consecutive Games With a 3-Pointer Curry holds the record with 157 consecutive games with at least one 3-pointer made, a streak that spanned three seasons from Nov. 13, 2014 to Nov. 3, 2016. Kyle Korver is the only other player to reach 100 straight games with a 3-pointer at 127 games. Curry does not have the longest active streak in the league, that belongs to Sacramento\u2019s Buddy Hield at 82 straight games, followed by Curry and Brooklyn\u2019s Joe Harris each with 77 consecutive games. Toronto\u2019s Fred VanVleet and Brooklyn\u2019s James Harden are the only other players with an active streak of at least 40 games.  Curry\u2019s journey to the No. 2 spot in career 3-pointers made began in 2009 after he entered the league as the No. 7 overall pick out of Davidson College. Here is a look back at the major milestones he achieved as he climbed the ranks. 1 \u2013 Oct. 30, 2009 : After missing his only 3-point attempt in his NBA debut, Curry shot 2-for-3 from beyond the arc in his second career game, a 123-101 loss to Phoenix. 100 \u2013 Feb. 27, 2010 : Curry\u2019s 100 th 3-pointer came in his 58 th career game as he shot 3-for-6 from beyond the arc and finished with a game-high 27 points in a 95-88 win over Detroit. 500 \u2013 Jan. 26, 2013 : Curry reached 500 career 3-pointers in his 221 st career game with No. 500 coming on a night when he scored 26 points on 5-for-9 shooting from 3-point land in a 109-102 loss to Milwaukee. 1,000 \u2013 Jan. 7, 2015 : Curry became the fastest player to ever reach 1,000 3-pointers made as he reached the century mark in just his 369 th career game. He reached the milestone during a 117-102 win over Indiana when he shot 4-for-8 from deep and finished with 21 points. 1,500 \u2013 March 11, 2016 : The theme of Curry being the fastest to reach a 3-point milestone continued as he hit the 1,500 mark, this time shattering the previous record held by Ray Allen. Curry needed only 477 games to reach 1,500 3-pointers made, while Allen needed 661 games. Enters Top 10 \u2013 March 5, 2017 : Curry entered the top 10 on the all-time 3-pointers made list at Madison Square Garden in New York \u2013 the same arena where he set his career-best scoring mark of 54 points four years prior (he topped that mark with a 62-point game earlier this season). Curry scored 31 points and shot 5-for-13 on 3s in a 112-105 win, ending the night with 1,833 career 3-pointers, passing Chauncey Billups (1,830) to crack the top 10. 2,000 \u2013 Dec. 4, 2017 : Curry became the eighth player in NBA history to reach 2,000 career 3-pointers and did so faster than any other player , needing only 597 games to hit the milestone. Curry scored 31 points and shot 5-for-11 on 3s in Golden State\u2019s 125-115 win, but the achievement was marred by a sprained ankle late in the game that would cost Curry nearly four weeks of action. Enters Top 5 \u2013 Oct. 24, 2018 : Curry entered the top five on the all-time 3-point list in style as he scored 51 points and made 11 3s during Golden State\u2019s 144-122 win over Washington. With his third 3-pointer of the night, Curry (2,162) passed Jamal Crawford (2,153) for fifth place in career 3s made. 2,500 \u2013 Dec 27, 2020 : In the third game of the 2020-21 season, Curry became the third player in NBA history to reach the 2,500 career 3-pointers made milestone, joining Reggie Miller and Ray Allen. Curry scored 36 points and shot 5-for-15 from deep to help the Warriors earn their first win of the season."},{"id":480355,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/devin-booker-ruled-out-vs-nuggets-with-left-hamstring-injury","date":"2021-01-24","title":"Devin Booker ruled out vs. Nuggets with left hamstring injury","content":"PHOENIX (AP) \u2014 Phoenix Suns All-Star guard Devin Booker sat out Saturday night against the Denver Nuggets because of a left hamstring injury he suffered in overtime Friday night.

The people told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the final list has not been revealed publicly. The additions mean at least 60 players could be on the player-pool list that will be released by USA Basketball in the coming weeks. Most of those are holdovers from the finalists list that was announced in February 2020 in anticipation of an Olympics last summer. There were 44 players on that list and almost all of them, with the exception of injured Golden State guard Klay Thompson, are expected to remain in the pool this year. ESPN first reported that USA Basketball has sent approximately 60 invitations to be part of the player pool. The U.S. men have won gold at the last three Olympics. Most of the league\u2019s biggest American stars \u2014 LeBron James, Stephen Curry, Damian Lillard, James Harden, Jimmy Butler, Kyle Lowry, Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant among them \u2014 were part of the player pool last year as well. James told AP last month he will consider playing in Tokyo and said that playing for Gregg Popovich \u2014 the San Antonio Spurs coach who will lead the U.S. in these Olympics \u2014 was one reason why. \u201cIt\u2019s still possible,\u201d James said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a 0% percent chance, I will say that. I love Coach Pop.\u201d But it remains unclear how the NBA playoffs will affect the team-selection process. The NBA is planning that the latest possible date for the NBA Finals would be July 22, one day before the opening ceremony for the Tokyo Games. USA Basketball is planning a training camp and exhibition games. Camp, if past form holds, would start in early July. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said last month that this season\u2019s schedule was slotted \u201cto give our players the opportunity to participate in the Olympics should they choose to do so.\u201d \u201cI see that very much as an individual decision,\u201d Silver said. \u201cClearly in the case of the United States, we have a deeper pool of talent than other countries. So I think it\u2019s less likely \u2014 although it will impact the U.S. team, it affects them not as dramatically as it will some of these other teams, where if a particular player or two doesn\u2019t participate, it could decimate a team.\u201d USA Basketball is not planning tryouts and instead is expected to pare the list to a 12-player Olympic team in the coming months, those decisions to be made by a selection committee and based in part on player availability and health. The U.S. is one of eight teams to already have clinched a spot in the 12-team Olympic men\u2019s field. There are 24 teams left in the running for the four spots, those to be decided in qualifying tournaments that will end in early July.

Cleveland completed its trade with Houston on Friday, sending Porter to the Rockets for a second-round draft pick, a deal the Cavs had no choice to make after running out of patience with a player they once viewed as a possible franchise cornerstone. The teams agreed to the swap on Thursday night, less than a week after Porter\u2019s outburst in Cleveland\u2019s locker room convinced the team it had to part with the 20-year-old. \u201cAfter careful and thoughtful evaluation, we made the very difficult and collective decision to make this trade,\u201d Cavs general manager Koby Altman said. \u201cGiven the culture and environment we have worked to cultivate here in Cleveland, we feel this move is in everyone\u2019s best interest. \u201cKevin has a bright career ahead of him as a professional basketball player and, at his core, is a good person. We wish Kevin and his family well in Houston.\u201d Porter posted a message on Twitter, thanking Cleveland fans, the Cavs\u2019 organization, his teammates and coaches. \u201cThank you for being there & welcoming me as family every step of the way,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMaking a Seattle youngster feel at home in Ohio. Forever grateful for the moments we created and best of luck to you all!\u201d The Cavs positioned themselves to draft Porter in 2019, selecting with with the No. 30 pick after he slid past numerous teams who were scared off by his issues while at USC. And while he was far from a finished product, the team was mesmerized by the 6-foot-4 swingman\u2019s potential and considered him one of the core pieces of its rebuild. Porter averaged 10 points, 3.2 rebounds and 2.2 assists as a rookie and was one of Cleveland\u2019s few bright spots in a 2019 season ended prematurely by the COVID-19 pandemic. But starting last summer, Porter\u2019s off-the-floor issues began to mount. He was accused of punching a woman in August, and two months later sent the Cavs looking to help him after a cryptic Instagram posting. Porter was arrested on gun and marijuana possession charges in November following a single-car accident. Those were eventually dropped. Porter was not with the team during training camp, but the Cavs wanted to make it work and always planned to bring him back. That happened last week when Porter practiced with the team for the first time and was on Cleveland\u2019s bench during a win over New York. However, his career with the Cavs essentially ended after the game when he became upset the team had given his locker room space to newly acquired forward Taurean Prince. Porter reportedly had a heated verbal confrontation with Altman. The Cavs decided then it was over with Porter. They looked to make a trade to get something in return rather than releasing him. Cavs coach J.B. Bickerstaff personally worked with Porter over the past year. The coach said earlier this week he hoped Porter would be able to sort things out. \u201cWe all want to see Kevin be successful, and I still feel that way,\u201d Bickerstaff said. \u201cSo whatever it is that happens in the future for him, I hope nothing but the best for him.

In this era, he\u2019s an elite player with a mustard stain on his jersey. He is, as you know, a non-shooter in a league that \u2014 for better or worse \u2014 has drifted away from the rim. In that sense, that part of Simmons\u2019 game is outdated much like an 8-track player, floppy disk and rotary phone. He\u2019s the rare player who doesn\u2019t stand behind the 3-point line on offense, and who doesn\u2019t instinctively sprint to the corner on a fast break instead of filling the lane. There are seven-foot centers who spend more time on the perimeter than Simmons, a guard who out of necessity doesn\u2019t stray too far from the painted comfort zone. This is the issue: Does Simmons need to change his game and therefore fall in line \u2014 as in, the 3-point line \u2014 with everyone else? Can he be him \u2014 and still help the Eastern Conference-leading Philadelphia 76ers reach their destination, wherever that may be? Simmons is a different kind of unicorn, a player who manages to thrive without shooting from deep or more than a handful of times each game. This says plenty about his other skills: ball handling, court vision, instincts, quick hands and the ability to defend. Simmons seems comfortable in his own skin, but the Sixers and their fans, while understanding, aren\u2019t always comfortable about his limited shooting range or reluctance to shoot. Simmons took just two shots recently against the Miami Heat in a game that went into overtime, and his shot attempts per game (8.8), field goal percentage (49.6%) and scoring average (12.2 ppg) are all down from last season. He entered 2020-21 with 24 career 3-point attempts (with two makes) and is 1-for-5 on 3-pointers (which represents a drastic uptick for him) entering Friday\u2019s game against the Boston Celtics. Not to compare him to Magic Johnson, but Magic spent his first few years much the same as Simmons is now: deferring to teammates, scoring mainly on layups, dunks, hooks and runners. Magic won titles that way, but the NBA then wasn\u2019t the NBA now. A few factors conspired to make Simmons this way. First: Bad mechanics that weren\u2019t fixed during his early development, and as a teenager he was so effective and dominant without shooting that there was no urgency to address that. He\u2019s also a two-time All-Star and All-NBA player who was given a $177 million contract extension without having a shooter\u2019s mentality or touch. Therefore, on the surface, if you\u2019re Simmons, why bother to change? When Doc Rivers took the Sixers\u2019 coaching job, he assigned assistant coach Sam Cassell to work with Simmons on shooting. Cassell, therefore, became the latest \u201cshot doctor\u201d for Simmons \u2026 although Cassell represents somewhat of a switch. During his playing days, Cassell mastered the mid-range shot, which is a lost art in today\u2019s NBA but could serve as a compromise for Simmons. Given Simmons\u2019 height (6-foot-9), length (7-foot wingspan) and coupled with the reality that teams don\u2019t defend the mid-range anymore, he might discover an unprotected part of the court that\u2019s to his liking \u2014 provided he gravitates to those spots and isn\u2019t reluctant to add that shot to his game. Until then, Simmons continues to adopt the same mentality that he\u2019s kept since entering the NBA and hearing the fuss about his shooting. \u201cThe one thing about me is I can score no points, and if we\u2019re up 50, I\u2019m happy,\u201d said Simmons. \u201cI\u2019m not coming out here trying to have a certain average or score 50, 40, 30 points. I\u2019m coming out here to win, I\u2019m going to try to get it done whether it\u2019s defensively or making the right reads and getting the team set.\u201d When asked about Simmons and shooting, Rivers isn\u2019t placing a premium on change. Privately, those conversations between him, Simmons and Cassell on the subject might be different. But the new coach, by all accounts, is taking the slow road with Simmons on shot depth, selection and frequency. \u201cI really don\u2019t care,\u201d Rivers said about the number of shots Simmons takes (and doesn\u2019t take). \u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t even look. I let the world look at it \u2026 everyone\u2019s gonna tell you anyway. I\u2019m not that concerned with it yet.\u201d The potential downside to Simmons\u2019 reluctance and ability to shoot with range is complicated. The most obvious: He has the ball more than anyone. Second: center Joel Embiid, the Sixers\u2019 other All-Star, could operate with more room in the paint if Simmons isn\u2019t there. Teams are also cheating when defending Simmons and are more liable to leave him open. They\u2019re daring him to shoot and hoping he takes the bait (which he often doesn\u2019t). But the Sixers are designed to minimize Simmons\u2019 shooting issues. That\u2019s why they added Seth Curry and Danny Green in the offseason and re-signed Tobias Harris in 2019. A few bonuses along the way in scoring-minded Shake Milton and Tyrese Maxey have been discovered. They offer better shooting options even though they aren\u2019t better players. The mid-range shot could help encourage Simmons to shoot, provided he adopts it. Cassell was a master of the 15-foot, off-the-dribble pull-up jumper when he played for a pair of championship teams in Houston. He also helped train the Clippers\u2019 shooters when he and Rivers were in L.A (2014-20) after spending time as an assistant with the Washington Wizards (2009-14). He comes fully endorsed by Rivers, who feels Simmons can only be helped by Cassell\u2019s tips and tutoring. \u201cSam, you give him to players, he has done a great job,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cHe\u2019s had a lot of success with players. It is more than just shooting. It is his post game, his passing. How to play the unique position that he plays.\u201d Rivers cautions that Simmons is unlike any player Cassell worked with before, though. \u201cHe is not a point, not a two, not a three, he is a ballplayer,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cWe put him in every spot on the floor, literally every spot on the floor. Having a guy like Sam explain to him what we are looking for is really what we are trying to do here.\u201d Simmons, 24, has room to grow and learn. Jason Kidd wasn\u2019t comfortable shooting with volume and range until he turned 28. Coincidently, that\u2019s when Kidd achieved his greatest success, finishing second in the MVP vote and leading the Nets to back-to-back appearances in The Finals. The Sixers obviously value Simmons highly even though his shooting mentality remains a work in progress. \u201cI\u2019ll let you guys talk about what Ben doesn\u2019t do,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cI just want Ben to keep playing great defense, running our team and winning games.\u201d * * *"},{"id":479109,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nikola-jokic-embodies-qualities-of-hard-to-define-kia-mvp","date":"2021-01-22","title":"Nikola Jokic embodies qualities of hard-to-define Kia MVP","content":"Nikola Jokic listened intently with a thumb in his mouth. Then, for 9 seconds, eyes darting back and forth, he pondered the question. \u201cHow would you define what a Most Valuable Player is in the NBA?\u201d a reporter asked. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Jokic mumbled. \u201cThe most, uh \u2026 I really don\u2019t know. The top scorer? I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s a really good question. I really don\u2019t know. For real, I don\u2019t know.\u201d See, it\u2019s difficult to process and even tougher to articulate the true definition when you already embody such a superlative. But that\u2019s where we are with Jokic, who leads the Denver Nuggets into Friday\u2019s back-to-back set against the Phoenix Suns as a legitimate candidate to win the 2021 Kia NBA Most Valuable Player Award. He\u2019s just the second player in NBA history to average at least 20 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists (25.1 ppg, 11.4 rpg and 10.0 apg) through their team\u2019s first 14 games in a season. Oscar Robertson accomplished the feat in 1961-62, averaging 31.6 ppg to go with 13.0 apg and 12.9 rpg. \u201cAs his teammates, we all knew that he was capable of this; capable of playing at the MVP caliber like he is,\u201d Nuggets reserve guard P.J. Dozier said. \u201cWe\u2019re just excited to be able to see it night in and night out. Him being so consistent with his numbers, with his stat line, helps us as a team a lot. Just individually, we\u2019re excited for him, for him being such a force on the offensive end and also being a competitor at the defensive end. He\u2019s taken pride on both ends of the court, putting up MVP numbers.\u201d The team\u2019s 119-101 win against Oklahoma City on Tuesday served as evidence with Jokic racking up 15 points in the first quarter alone. Jokic didn\u2019t even play in the fourth quarter after churning out his sixth game this season with 25 points or more and 10-plus rebounds. Before the game, Thunder coach Mark Daigneault used football analogies to explain how to best defend Jokic. \u201cYou want to pressure the quarterback,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you just let him sit back and pick you apart, that\u2019s what he\u2019ll do.\u201d Jokic has produced a double-double in all 14 games and is tied with Dallas Mavericks MVP candidate Luka Doncic for the league-high in triple-doubles (5). As the only player in the league currently averaging a triple-double, Jokic also ranks No. 5 in the NBA in steals per game (1.9), and if you\u2019re into this sort of thing, he\u2019s tops in fantasy scoring (57.1 points per game), too. Nuggets coach Michael Malone jokingly attributed Jokic\u2019s rise in production to an application of tough love. \u201cYeah, I locked him in my office one day,\u201d Malone said Tuesday night after the win over the Thunder. \u201cAnd I beat him with a pillowcase filled with soda cans and said, \u2018You\u2019ve got to score more.\u2019 You know how he is. He\u2019s a great player. He\u2019s playing at an MVP level. He goes out there tonight: 27, 12 and 6; only one turnover. Early on, they were playing him one-on-one. Sometimes, I get frustrated because I don\u2019t think we give him the ball enough, especially when he\u2019s being guarded one-on-one. \u201cNikola has seen every possible double team, and so have we as a team. He\u2019s always gonna take what the defense gives him, but he is being a lot more aggressive, which is what we need from him.\u201d With Denver\u2019s offense flowing through Jokic firing water polo passes all over the floor with precision, the Nuggets rank third in the league in offensive rating (115.3), fifth in net rating (4.0), fifth in points (115.6), tied for second in assist ratio (19.2) and sixth in assist percentage (63.3). The Nuggets also sit at No. 3 in second-chance points (14.9), No. 9 in percentage of points in the paint (43.2%) and sixth in points in the paint (50.0). Still, the gaudy offensive numbers haven\u2019t consistency pushed Denver into the win column. Starting wing Michael Porter Jr. \u2014 in his first season as a full-time starter \u2014 has missed 10 consecutive games due to the league\u2019s coronavirus protocols, but Malone said there\u2019s a chance he could join the Nuggets on their upcoming five-game road trip. Porter averaged 19.5 ppg and 6.8 rpg over four games. So, his absence saps Denver of some of its offensive firepower. That has led to some lineup tinkering by Malone, who believes the Nuggets might finally be on the way to picking up from where they left off this past summer in the bubble. Denver became the first team in NBA playoff history to overcome 3-1 series deficits twice in the same postseason with dramatic wins over the Utah Jazz and LA Clippers in the first two rounds on the way to its first conference finals run since 2009. Even after the Nuggets lost three of their best defenders in Jerami Grant, Torrey Craig and Mason Plumlee in the offseason, the expectation \u2014 based off the team\u2019s playoff run and star power in Jokic and Jamal Murray \u2014 was that Denver could be a serious contender for years to come. But the Nuggets stumbled out of the gates, dropping four of their first five to start the season. They\u2019ve now won four of their last six outings. \u201cWe haven\u2019t figured it all out yet,\u201d Malone said. \u201cWe\u2019re going on a road trip coming up that\u2019s going to be a hell of a challenge; nine days, five games. So, we\u2019ll try to continue to figure it out on the road. We\u2019re 7-7. Obviously, we have a lot of work to do. But I like this team a lot. They have a competitive spirit. They have gelled really quickly, considering you brought in seven new players. \u201cWe\u2019re getting closer and closer. We\u2019ve had some tough losses; bounces haven\u2019t gone our way. But hopefully, I think we\u2019re 6-3 in our last nine games, and I feel like we\u2019re getting back closer to the team that I believe we can be.\u201d Of course, Jokic plays a major role in that along with Murray. That\u2019s why Jokic\u2019s teammates continue to make sure the veteran big man receives his flowers for a job well done in carrying the Nuggets through an up-and-down season. Nuggets guard Monte Morris made it a point to grab Jokic in the weight room recently after a game to explain just how much he means to the team\u2019s success. Morris told Jokic that he compares favorably to former MVPs Kevin Durant, LeBron James and Giannis Antetokounmpo, and called the center a Hall of Famer. Phoenix Suns coach Monty Williams believes \u201cthere\u2019s really no weakness in his game.\u201d As for Jokic, he just takes all the praise in stride, and grinned when asked about Morris\u2019 comments. No long pause this time like when Jokic was asked how he would define an MVP in the NBA. \u201cIt means a lot, just to have my back. I know that they trust me. I know that they\u2019ve got my back,\u201d Jokic said. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to hear something like that.\u201d * * * Michael C. Wright is a senior writer for NBA.com.

At least Washington is back at practice, no small step in the right direction for a club dealing with so much uncertainty amid the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit odd. Pausing our season for a little bit while everybody else plays. \u2026 It feels almost like an unscheduled All-Star break or sort of like an extra All-Star break. Except everybody else is playing,\u201d Lopez said Thursday after nine players were able to participate in practice for a second day in a row after going nine days with no in-person work. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to keep everybody engaged right now.\u201d Even the first two sessions back together were far from ideal. Coach Scott Brooks described some of what the Wizards did as \u201c5-on-zero offense,\u201d because there weren\u2019t enough players to have two sides of five apiece. \u201cOur mindset today is a lot better,\u201d Brooks said Thursday, when Lopez was the only healthy center available. \u201cI\u2019m excited about it now. Last night I wasn\u2019t in the best place. I don\u2019t get there often. But today, seeing the guys coming back \u2014 we had a good practice today with the guys we had.\u201d The Wizards started this season 0-5 and now are 3-8; they haven\u2019t played at all since a victory against Phoenix on Jan. 11. Their past six games were scrapped, including what was supposed to be a trip to face the Milwaukee Bucks on Friday. But after Beal, who leads the NBA in scoring at 34.9 points per game, complained about needing to play in Milwaukee, the league acknowledged Washington was too short-handed and too short on preparation. All of the time off, Beal said, \u201calters guys\u2019 rhythm, shape; that\u2019s just like a recipe for injury, honestly.\u201d The earliest Washington will play now is Sunday at the San Antonio Spurs. In addition to six positive COVID-19 tests, three other players were sidelined after contact tracing determined they might have been exposed to the illness. Plus, starting center Thomas Bryant is done for the season with a left knee injury and point guard Russell Westbrook is still dealing with a left quadriceps injury. \u201cNot a lot of bodies. It\u2019s going to be a juggling act with minutes,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cAnd you hope that nobody gets in foul trouble.\u201d Brooks said he doesn\u2019t know whether Westbrook can play Sunday. \u201cWe\u2019re in no rush,\u201d the coach said. Both Brooks and Lopez said they expect the league to figure out a way to have Washington play its entire 72-game schedule eventually. And neither thinks there is a danger of any member of the Wizards writing off the season, despite how bleak things are. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t even cross my mind with this group,\u201d said Brooks, who is in the final season of a five-year, $35 million contract. \u201cWe know that we\u2019ve got some tough luck this season.\u201d"},{"id":479064,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/tune-in-tidbits-tnt-thursday-jan-21-2021","date":"2021-01-21","title":"Tune-In Tidbits: TNT Thursday, Jan. 21, 2021","content":"Get ready for Thursday\u2019s TNT doubleheader with five key stats to know about each matchup. \u2022 The Bucks enter Thursday\u2019s game with the top-ranked offense in the league, scoring 117.7 points per 100 possessions; while the Lakers have the top-ranked defense , allowing just 104.6 points per 100 possessions. \u2022 The Lakers rank seventh in the league for most field goals made in the restricted area , averaging 18.9 per game. This is largely thanks to Montrezl Harrell who ranks fourth in the league in FG% (63.7%), with over 76% of his field goal attempts occurring within five feet of the basket. \u2022 The Bucks continue to have strong interior defense, holding teams to only 15.9 field goals made per game in the restricted area (sixth lowest in the league) and 58.8% within five feet (eighth lowest in the NBA). \u2022 The Lakers enter Thursday looking to extend their team record for best road start to 8-0. Through their first road seven games of the season, the Lakers have averaged 113.9 points (10th) while allowing a league-low 99.6 . The Lakers have outscored their opponents by an average of 14.3 points \u2013 nearly double the average point differential of the second-best road team (LA Clippers, plus 7.7). \u2022 Alex Caruso (55.6%) and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope (53.7%) rank second and third in the league, respectively, in\u2022 3-point shooting so far this season. For Caruso, 23 of his 27 3-point attempts have been wide-open (closest defender at least 6 feet away) and he has shot 60.9% on those attempts. For Caldwell-Pope, he has shot 46.2% on his 26 wide-open 3s and 66.7% (10-15) on open looks (defender within 4-6 feet). \u2022 In his past two games , Zion Williamson has scored 31 points on 86.7% shooting (at SAC) and 32 points on 73.7% shooting (at UTA). Since the 1983-84 season, only Shaquille O\u2019Neal and Kevin McHale have posted at least three straight games with 30+ points on 70+ percent shooting. \u2022 Donovan Mitchell scored a team-high 28 points in Utah\u2019s win over New Orleans on Tuesday. Mitchell scored 19 points and shot a perfect 7-7 from the field and 4-4 from 3-point range in the 3:35 of matchup time against Eric Bledsoe . In 3:27 against Lonzo Ball , Mitchell had just 2 points on 0-2 FG, 2-2 FT. \u2022 Zion Williamson ranks first in the league in points in the paint (18.8 per game) and ranks second in second-chance points (4.1 per game). New Orleans ranks third in offensive rebound rate (29.9%) with two players ranked in the top nine in offensive rebounding \u2013 Steven Adams (3.8 per game, 5th) and Williamson (3.2 per game, 9th). \u2022 Rudy Gobert will be important in limiting New Orleans\u2019 offensive rebounds and second-chance points as he did in their first meeting on Tuesday. Gobert ranks second in the NBA in defensive rebounds per game (10.1), and collected 12 on Tuesday as the Jazz held the Pelicans to 10 offensive rebounds and 10 second-chance points, just one shy of matching the Pelicans\u2019 season low . \u2022 In Tuesday\u2019s game, Royce O\u2019Neal defended Brandon Ingram for 10:22, which was 80.6% of Ingram\u2019s offensive matchup time. O\u2019Neal held Ingram to 8 points on 4-12 shooting. No player has defended Ingram for longer in a single game than O\u2019Neal so far this season."},{"id":479006,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/power-rankings-notebook-week-5","date":"2021-01-21","title":"Power Rankings Notebook: Bucks tweak offense, Nets' Big 3 debuts and early on-off court leaders","content":"Each week during the season, NBA.com writer John Schuhmann surveys the league to compile stats and notes for his in-depth Power Rankings . Before the next rankings drop on Monday, here are some of the storylines he\u2019s keeping an eye on this weekend. When the Los Angeles Lakers visit the Milwaukee Bucks on Thursday ( 7:30 ET, TNT ), it will be a matchup between the league\u2019s No. 1 offense and its No. 1 defense . The Bucks led the league in defensive efficiency (points allowed per 100 possessions) in each of the last two seasons, but they\u2019re the team with the No. 1 offense this time. The improvement is about more than just personnel changes, because the Bucks have made a schematic adjustment as well. Rather than placing shooters all around the perimeter \u2026 \u2026 they\u2019ve more often placed someone in one of the dunker spots (on the baseline, just outside the paint). Putting a teammate and his defender in or near the paint can cut off Giannis Antetokounmpo\u2019s path to the basket. And Antetokounmpo has seen a drop in the percentage of his shots that have come in the restricted area (where he shoots 74%), from 53% last season to 49% this season. But the Bucks have made up for that in a couple of ways. First, they\u2019ve shot 40.3% from 3-point range ( second best ), up from 35.5% (18th) last season. A greater percentage of their 3s have been uncontested, according to Second Spectrum tracking. With a player in the dunker spot, there\u2019s one fewer perimeter defender, making it more difficult to rotate to above-the-break 3s\u2026 In the 41 seasons of the 3-point line (prior to this one), only 10 teams have shot better than 40% from beyond the arc. The last was the 2015-16 Warriors . One other benefit to having a player in the dunker spot (and maybe a more sustainable one) is that guy is in great rebounding position. And with the change to their offense, the Bucks have seen the league\u2019s biggest jump in offensive rebounding percentage. Last season, the Bucks ranked 28th , grabbing 24.1% of available offensive boards. This season, they rank sixth at 28.6%. That may not seem like a huge change, but it has made a big difference in the Bucks\u2019 offense. Milwaukee had a top-10 offense last season and has seen the league\u2019s biggest jump in points scored per 100 possessions, from 111.9 (eighth) to 117.7 (first). And the increase in second chance points, from 11.6 to 14.6 per 100 , accounts more than half of that overall jump (5.8 per 100). Biggest jump, points scored per 100 possessions The Bucks\u2019 leader in offensive rebounds with 32 is new back-up center Bobby Portis, who has made good use of that dunker spot placement to angle himself into rebounding position underneath the defense \u2026 League-wide, offensive rebounding percentage has dropped quite a bit over the last 10 years, with teams prioritizing transition defense over crashing the glass. But the Bucks have been able to get extra points on second chances without seeing their transition defense suffer. In fact, they\u2019ve seen the league\u2019s biggest drop in the percentage of their opponents\u2019 possessions that have come in transition, from 15.4% ( 11th lowest ) last season to just 12.6% ( second lowest ) this season. The Lakers rank second in defensive rebounding percentage , so the matchup on Thursday is strength vs. strength in more ways than one. And, though both teams lost on Monday, it could very well determine No. 1 in next week\u2019s Power Rankings. We often hear that a player \u201chas seen every kind of defense,\u201d and it\u2019s almost always about a great scorer. But what about great shooters? In his 15th season, it\u2019s fair to say that JJ Redick has seen every scheme for defending his off-ball movement. And it can be fun to watch Redick continue to find paths to an open 3. Here\u2019s one from the Pelicans\u2019 loss to the Clippers last Wednesday \u2026 The initial action is a Jaxson Hayes screen for Redick on the right wing. Paul George top-locks Redick to prevent him from getting over the screen cleanly. So Redick continues into the paint and, when Brandon Ingram pitches the ball to Hayes, feigns a back-screen for Ingram. George switches that screen, but Patrick Beverley never feels it and stays with Ingram. Redick is now unguarded as he takes a handoff from Hayes, whose man (Ivica Zubac) is playing too far back to go contest the Redick 3. Here\u2019s the overhead replay\u2026 This is why watching Redick can be more fun than watching the ball. The Pelicans are in Utah to face the Jazz in the second game of TNT\u2019s doubleheader on Thursday ( 10 ET ). Here are the early \u201cleaders\u201d in regard to how their teams have performed with them on and off the floor \u2026 Biggest on-off-court NetRtg differential On\/Off Court = Team\u2019s point differential per 100 possessions w\/ player on or off floor Minimum 200 minutes on the floor w\/ one team (236 players) Through Jan. 20, 2021 We won\u2019t make any grand conclusions this early in the season, though you might see why the Suns moved Cameron Johnson into the starting lineup (replacing Jae Crowder) this week. The original starting lineup (which has still closed both of the Suns\u2019 games this week ) has allowed 118.9 points per 100 possessions, the worst mark among 16 lineups that have played at least 100 minutes. At the bottom of this on-off list is DeAndre Ayton, with the Suns having been 25.4 points per 100 possessions better with him off the floor (+19.4) than with him on the floor (-6.0). The only team with two players in the top 10 is the Spurs, who, for what seems like the umpteenth straight season, have been better in bench minutes. They\u2019ve been outscored by 10.9 points per 100 possessions with their two former All-Stars on the floor, but have outscored their opponents by 13.7 points per 100 in 131 minutes with all four of their regular reserves \u2013 Patty Mills, Devin Vassell, Rudy Gay and Jakob Poeltl \u2013 in the game. The only superstar in the top 10 is Damian Lillard, and the Blazers will obviously be depending on him more than ever with by CJ McCollum and Jusuf Nurkic out. But there are others not far behind. Kawhi Leonard is 11th, with the Clippers having been 19.1 points per 100 possessions better with him on the floor. Nikola Jokic ( 18.0 ), Kevin Durant ( 17.5 ), Kyrie Irving (15.9) and Joel Embiid ( 14.4 ) are also near the top of the list. The Brooklyn Nets lost their first game with their new Big Three on Wednesday, because Collin Sexton went off in the second overtime in Cleveland. But the Nets also lost, while being forced to play the big three big minutes \u2014 Kevin Durant and James Harden each played more than 50 minutes, while Kyrie Irving played more than 48 \u2014because their defense was bad well before Sexton scored an incredible 22 points in the 10 extra minutes. The Cavs entered the game with the league\u2019s worst offense by a healthy margin, having barely scored a point per possession through their first 13 games. They were missing Sexton for the previous five games and have now been without Darius Garland for eight straight, but in ending the Nets\u2019 four-game winning streak, Cleveland had its most efficient offensive game of the season (147 points on 120 possessions). The Nets played a big role in that, and it was much more about effort than scheme or communication within a group that just got together. Take these 4 plays from early in the third quarter, when the Cavs scored 15 points on their first seven possessions \u2026 1. On a simple baseline out of bounds play, Durant is guarding inbounder Cedi Osman, but doesn\u2019t react when Osman steps onto the floor and into the strong-side corner. Also, after Larry Nance Jr. flips the ball back to Osman, Irving just stands where he is, neither switching out to Osman (with Durant able to guard Nance\u2019s dive to the basket) nor staying with Nance to keep him off the glass \u2026 2. All five Nets are back, but they simply don\u2019t match up in transition, with Isaac Okoro wide open in that same right corner. 3. James Harden packed his patented transition defense (idly swiping at a dribble or pass without moving his feet) for the move to Brooklyn. Irving makes only a slightly better effort as Sexton cruises to a transition layup. 4. Harden\u2019s weak-side tag on Andre Drummond\u2019s roll to the rim is, well, weak. And Irving certainly isn\u2019t ready to make the next rotation (to Okoro) should Harden stop the roll and force a kick-out. The Nets led the league in defensive efficiency after the first week of the season, but that was clearly fool\u2019s gold. They\u2019ve since fallen to 21st and could have saved themselves from playing 10 extra minutes (with no pay-off) by just playing a little harder earlier in the night. They were saying the right things afterward. \u201cThat\u2019s gonna be the tale of our season,\u201d Irving said, \u201chow committed are we to that end of the floor.\u201d \u201cDefensively,\u201d Harden added, \u201cwe got to be a lot better.\u201d Time will tell if they can back up their words with better effort. They get another chance to slow down the Cavs\u2019 30th-ranked offense on Friday ( 7:30 ET, League Pass ), before returning home for two games against the Miami Heat (Saturday and Monday, both on NBA TV at 7:30 ET).

He\u2019s averaged 31.7 FD points in 31.5 minutes across his last six games, and tonight\u2019s matchup with the Bucks has the highest over\/under of the three games on the slate (228.5). Lonzo Ball (NOP) vs. UTA: $5,500 I\u2019m going back to the well with Ball tonight, even after he scored just 23.2 FD points in Tuesday\u2019s return. What\u2019s important to note is that he scored those 23.2 points in just 23 minutes of action. His playing time is expected to increase tonight, and if Ball can get on the court for closer to the 32.4 minutes he\u2019s averaged thus far, he could be a great value. There\u2019s plenty of both risk and reward in plugging Ball into your lineups. Jordan Clarkson (UTA) vs. NOP: $6,300 Clarkson continues to roll as he\u2019s averaged 20.1 points, 5.3 rebounds and 2.7 dimes across his last seven games. He scored 33.2 FD points in Tuesday\u2019s matchup with New Orleans, and he\u2019ll look to show up for another strong performance in tonight\u2019s rematch. Immanuel Quickley (NYK) vs. GSW: $4,500 Aside from a 15.2-FD-point performance Tuesday, Quickley has been lights out over the last week. In three games prior, he averaged better than 33 FD points, and across his last five contests, the rookie is averaging a robust 1.119 FD points per minute. As long as he can see playing time in the low-to-mid 20s, he\u2019s got a great chance to be a huge value at his affordable price tag. R.J. Barrett (NYK) vs. GSW: $6,700 Barrett\u2019s FD point totals have increased in each of his last four games, culminating in a 22\/10\/4 line against Orlando on Tuesday (40.0 FD points). Tonight\u2019s matchup with Golden State\u2019s lackluster defense provides Barrett the opportunity to far exceed value, even as his price continues to climb. Kelly Oubre (GSW) vs. NYK: $5,600 After a rough start to the season, Oubre has turned it on over the last week. He\u2019s provided at least 35 FD points in each of his last two games, and the forward has averaged 3.0 combined blocks\/steals across his last three outings. Oubre has 40-point upside, and at this price point, he\u2019s a solid value. Draymond Green (GSW) vs. NYK: $5,400 Across his last six games, Green has eclipsed 30 FD points three times while failing to hit 20 FD points three times. Those totals make him a riskier option in DFS lineups tonight, but at just $5.4K, he could easily smash value. Bobby Portis (MIL) vs. LAL: $4,900 Bobby P has been huge off the bench for Milwaukee. He\u2019s averaged nearly one FD point per minute this season, but that number has climbed to a healthy 1.195 FD points per minute across his last five \u2014 seventh-best mark in the NBA. Tonight\u2019s matchup between the Bucks and Lakers sports the highest over\/under on the slate at 228.5, so Portis could certainly be a value in this one at his sub-$5K price tag. James Wiseman (GSW) vs. NYK: $4,400 Wiseman went off against the Spurs last night to the tune of 20\/6\/4, and tonight, he\u2019ll face the NBA\u2019s most generous defense to opposing centers. The rookie\u2019s playing time has been hit-or-miss thus far, but on the second night of a back-to-back, it\u2019s possible the No. 2 overall pick sees a little more playing time in favor of getting Golden State\u2019s veterans some rest.

Anthony cut the deficit to 96-94 with a 3-pointer with 34.6 seconds remaining. And with 4.6 seconds left, Anthony fouled Vanderbilt, who missed both free throws and opened the door for the improbable finish. CELEBRATION  Anthony\u2019s momentum carried him to the Magic bench, where he was immediately mobbed by his teammates. The party continued moments later in the locker room after the team doused Anthony with water . GRADE  After a 6-2 start, not much has gone right for the Magic this season. This was a big moment for Anthony, who took over starting point guard duties in the wake of Markelle Fultz\u2019s season-ending injury. Perhaps this will give the rookie more confidence and help turn Orlando\u2019s season around. 3 Horrys."},{"id":478796,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/wizards-bucks-game-postponed-for-health-and-safety-protocols","date":"2021-01-21","title":"Wizards-Bucks game postponed for Health and Safety Protocols","content":"NEW YORK \u2014 The National Basketball Association game scheduled for Fri., Jan. 22 between the Washington Wizards and Milwaukee Bucks at Fiserv Forum has been postponed in accordance with the league\u2019s Health and Safety Protocols.

U.S. District Judge Loretta Biggs in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, ruled on Wednesday that marketing agent Gina Ford\u2019s contract with Williamson was void because Ford was not a licensed agent in the state at the time she met with Williamson and because the contract did not comply with key requirements outlined by the state\u2019s sports agent law, the Uniform Athlete Agents Act. The act requires that the contract include warnings explaining how hiring agents causes athletes to forfeit their amateur status. It also requires such contracts to include a disclaimer giving athletes 14 days to cancel. \u201cWe are grateful that the court invalidated the contract based on the merits of the case, in line with the clear, relevant requirements under North Carolina law,\u201d Williamson lawyer Jeffrey S. Klein said in a written statement. \u201cThe court confirmed that actual facts matter, which hopefully will serve as a cautionary tale for unscrupulous agents looking to prey on student athletes.\u201d Attorney Willie E. Gary, who is part of Ford\u2019s legal team, noted that the order \u201cimpacts only some of the claims in the North Carolina case.\u201d \u201cMost of the counterclaims remain, and we intend to vigorously pursue them,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are also reviewing all options for appeal.\u201d The counterclaims include allegations of tortious interference, or that CAA interfered with the business relationship between Williamson and Prime Sports, as well as unjust enrichment and theft of trade secrets. \u201cWilliamson\u2019s new agent should not be able to benefit from Ms. Ford\u2019s considerable efforts,\u201d Gary said. It remains to be seen how the federal ruling affects a separate but related lawsuit filed by Ford in Florida state court seeking damages for breach of contract. Williamson filed the federal lawsuit in North Carolina in June 2019 to terminate a five-year contract with Ford\u2019s agency, Prime Sports Marketing, after moving to Creative Artists Agency LLC. Attorneys for Ford and Prime Sports had alleged that North Carolina\u2019s athlete agent law should not apply to Williamson because Williamson and his family had accepted improper financial benefits while he was still enrolled at Duke. Ford\u2019s attorney\u2019s filed an affidavit alleging a $400,000 payment was made to Williamson\u2019s family before the former Duke star began his lone college season. Klein asked the court to disregard the affidavit, arguing that the allegations were false, that supporting documents were fraudulent and that the facts in the case remained that Williamson completed his lone season at Duke in good standing and had never been ruled ineligible by the NCAA. The judge agreed, noting that there was no legal basis for the courts to decide whether Williamson had violated NCAA rules. \u201cDefendants have provided no authority, caselaw or otherwise, that suggests that it is for a court to adjudicate the details of a student-athlete\u2019s eligibility under NCAA rules,\u201d Wednesday\u2019s ruling stated. \u201cRather, in applying the statute, it would appear that the Court\u2019s role is to determine whether the student-athlete has been either determined to be or declared \u2018permanently ineligible\u2019 by the governing body authorized to do so. Defendants have not alleged that this has occurred.\u201d In the state court case in Florida, Ford\u2019s attorneys have sought to have Williamson, the NBA\u2019s 2019 No. 1 overall draft pick, answer questions under oath about whether he received improper benefits before playing for the Blue Devils. A Florida appeals court in June granted a stay to pause the proceedings there, shifting the focus to the North Carolina case. Duke has repeatedly declined to comment on the case because it isn\u2019t involved in the litigation, but issued a statement in January that school had reviewed Williamson\u2019s eligibility previously and found no concerns.

The NBA apparently agreed with him. Not long after the league\u2019s leading scorer said he believes the short-handed Wizards \u2014 who have six players who have tested positive for COVID-19 \u2014 may be following \u201ca recipe for injury\u201d if they played Milwaukee as scheduled Friday night, the NBA said that game would be postponed in a move that simply gives Washington more time to get game-ready again. That move, along with the postponement of Wednesday\u2019s Memphis at Portland game, push the total to 17 games this season that have been pushed back because of the virus \u2014 those decisions coming on the same day the league revealed that 11 more players in the past week have tested positive for COVID-19. The NBA said Washington\u2019s Friday game would be called off \u201cdue to the number of unavailable players for the Wizards, contact tracing for other players on their roster, and the length of time preceding the game during which the team was unable to practice.\u201d That\u2019s exactly what Washington wanted. The Wizards had eight bodies for their first practice in nine days Wednesday night, after which Beal sounded the alarm and said he hoped the NBA would allow the team time to get in some semblance of game shape before playing again. \u201cThe health of us is the most important thing, and the safety of us, and that goes far beyond the virus,\u201d Beal said. \u201cIt\u2019s our physical health, too. \u2026 It\u2019s unfair that other teams have been going and practicing and playing and having their constant rhythm. We haven\u2019t played in a week and some change. It\u2019s going to be tough on us. It\u2019s going to be real tough on us.\u201d The earliest Washington will play now is Sunday in San Antonio \u2014 13 days after the Wizards\u2019 most recent game. The latest postponement means the Wizards have had six games pushed back in the last two weeks. Their Wednesday practice was mostly some 5-on-0 offense and shooting. Wizards coach Scott Brooks isn\u2019t expecting any of the six players who have tested positive back in the next few days at least, and Russell Westbrook is still out with a leg injury. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely not an ideal situation,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cIt\u2019s great to be back, though.\u201d Contact tracing issues for the Grizzlies meant they would not have enough players eligible to play in Portland. Of the 17 postponements, 16 have come since Jan. 10 and the number could rise again soon \u2014 since Memphis is also scheduled to play in Portland on Friday. By NBA rule, teams must have eight eligible players for games. The Wizards didn\u2019t expect to have more than eight available on Friday because of a combination of the virus and injuries. Meanwhile, the league is hoping players do a better job being safe. Starting with Wednesday\u2019s games, in a memo obtained by The Associated Press, the NBA told teams to have their security officials \u201cstationed near the half-court line during pre-game warmups and post-game to provide reminders to players and staff and encourage compliance\u201d with the rules regarding interaction. The NBA wants players to maintain six feet of distance as much as possible during pre-game warmups and post-game chats \u2014 a policy that has not been followed in many circumstances, even with the additional urging from the league about its importance. Players, the NBA reminded Wednesday, may elbow-bump and fist-bump, but hugs and handshakes are not permitted. Players exchanging pleasantries after games are \u201cstrongly encouraged to wear facemasks during any such interactions,\u201d the league said. The league reminded players that speaking face-to-face while unmasked raises risks of transmission. The league has also said that should a player test positive after such an interaction, the other player could have to quarantine because of possible exposure. The postponements involving Portland and Milwaukee push the total to 21 NBA teams that have had at least one game called off in the last two weeks. Memphis had its game at Minnesota last Friday called off after Timberwolves center Karl-Anthony Towns revealed that he tested positive for COVID-19. Towns and Ricky Rubio were among the Timberwolves still sidelined by the league\u2019s virus protocols Wednesday for a game against Orlando. Dallas played with four players still out for the same reason. Miami played in Tampa, Florida against Toronto with Jimmy Butler and Avery Bradley out for a fifth consecutive game because of protocols \u2014 with the likelihood there being that they will each miss at least three more games, since they\u2019re not on the current Heat road trip. Boston is still without Jayson Tatum as well. \u201cIt\u2019s important to always have a contingency plan,\u201d Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said, when asked what it\u2019s like coaching without knowing who will be available from one day to the next. Postponed games, when possible, will be made up in the second half of the season. Players who test positive must undergo a battery of exams before being cleared to return to play, such as cardiac tests. Those ruled out by contact tracing may return after a quarantine period, provided they continue to test negative for COVID-19. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a blueprint for this,\u201d Brooks said."},{"id":478441,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nikola-jokic-taking-game-to-another-level-this-season","date":"2021-01-21","title":"Nikola Jokic taking game to another level this season","content":"DENVER (AP) \u2014 Nikola Jokic faced a situation he couldn\u2019t pass, shoot or dribble his way through. The Denver Nuggets big man was befuddled by a simple yet complicated question: How does he define an NBA MVP? \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Jokic answered after a long pause. \u201cProbably the best player in the NBA? The top scorer? I don\u2019t know.\u201d By any measure, the 7-footer who views himself equal parts center and point guard has definitely put himself in the early Kia MVP conversation. After all, he is averaging a triple-double this season. Not only that, but he\u2019s displaying an array of dunks \u2014 he\u2019s never been known for his dunks \u2014 and a newfound aggressive shooting mentality that his coach certainly appreciates \u2014 and playfully takes credit. \u201cI locked him in my office one day, and I beat him with a pillowcase filled with soda cans, and said, \u2018You\u2019ve got to score more,'\u201d coach Michael Malone cracked. \u201cHe\u2019s a great player. He\u2019s playing at an MVP level.\u201d Reserve point guard Monte Morris believes Jokic fully belongs in the same company as Milwaukee\u2019s Giannis Antetokounmpo, Brooklyn\u2019s Kevin Durant and James Harden and LeBron James of the Los Angeles Lakers. Morris\u2019 assertion is buoyed by the stats: Jokic is first in field goals this season, total assists, player efficiency rating and triple-doubles. His 46 career triple-doubles are already the most in team history. \u201cHe produces just as much, if not more, than anybody in the NBA,\u201d Morris said. \u201cI\u2019m amazed every night.\u201d And now Jokic is adding a rim-rattling element \u2014 dunks. The player from Serbia nicknamed \u201cJoker\u201d already has nine slams, which is a big step up considering he had 15 all last season, 11 in \u201918-19 and eight (along with a miss) in \u201917-18. He even got called for a technical during a dunk this season, when he basically did a pull-up on the rim. \u201cI just like the excitement the guys have on the bench when I dunk,\u201d said Jokic, a second-round pick in 2014 who\u2019s averaging 25.1 points, 11.4 rebounds and 10 assists in \u201920-21. \u201cI dunk for them.\u201d And they appreciate it. \u201cEvery game, he adds an inch or two on his vertical,\u201d said forward Paul Millsap, whose Nuggets (7-7) begin a five-game trip Friday in Phoenix. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable to watch. It\u2019s great to watch a guy like that, a young guy, come to the gym every single day with his hard hat on, training and shooting. Even a guy that good comes in and works every single day.\u201d Jokic, who turns 26 next month, tries to deflect the attention. The two-time All-Star simply prefers not to be in the center of it. \u201cI know that they trust me. I know they\u2019ve got my back,\u201d said Jokic, who along with Jamal Murray was a big reason the Nuggets made the Western Conference Finals inside the NBA bubble last season. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to hear something like that.\u201d Or something like this, from Suns coach Monty Williams: \u201cHe\u2019s a unique player in that there\u2019s really no weakness in his game.\u201d That\u2019s partly due to the fact Jokic plays with a quarterback\u2019s mentality. He sees the entire floor \u2014 evidenced by his full-court passes \u2014 and it\u2019s why Oklahoma City coach Mark Daigneault put it in football terms in trying to defend him. \u201cYou want to pressure the quarterback,\u201d said Daigneault, whose team lost 119-101 to Denver on Tuesday as Jokic had 27 points, 12 rebounds and six assists in just three quarters. \u201cIf you just let him sit back and pick you apart, that\u2019s what he\u2019ll do.\u201d Before a recent game in Denver, Golden State coach Steve Kerr gave his rookie center James Wiseman a little encouragement in facing Jokic. \u201cThat Jokic is one of the best centers in the league,\u201d Kerr said. \u201d[Wiseman] will learn some hard lessons.\u201d Wiseman did, too, with Jokic going for 23 points, 14 rebounds and 10 assists in a Nuggets victory. \u201cHe\u2019s got a lot of tricks,\u201d Wiseman said. \u201cI just had to make sure I paid attention every second I was guarding him.\u201d About the only small quibble with Jokic this season has been his turnovers. He\u2019s among the league leaders in that category, too. \u201cThe best players in the NBA have the ball in their hands a ton. Much is asked of them,\u201d Malone said. \u201cNikola\u2019s been phenomenal.\u201d Which is why Morris campaigns for his big man: \u201cHe definitely should be highly talked in the MVP race,\u201d Morris said."}]
