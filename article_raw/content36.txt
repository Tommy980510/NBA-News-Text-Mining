There\u2019s no book to prove it. No Tex Winter textbook to dust off and revive the way Phil Jackson did with the triangle offense. No newer, shinier \u201cSeven Seconds Or Less\u201d account of Mike D\u2019Antoni\u2019s high-revving system crafted in Phoenix and practiced these days in Houston. There\u2019s no book dedicated to Moe\u2019s preferred style of play for the San Antonio Spurs and the Denver Nuggets in the 1970s and \u201880s. And even if there was, it would be a richly bound volume of blank pages. \u201cNobody knew what the hell we were doing,\u201d Moe said back then. \u201cOther coaches were diagramming our plays on the blackboard, and we weren\u2019t running any.\u201d The man who turned nothing into a real cool hand and usually had the last laugh on Sunday was named the 2018 recipient of the Chuck Daly Lifetime Achievement Award, presented by the National Basketball Coaches Association. Moe, 79, was scheduled to be honored at Oracle Arena about an hour before tipoff of Game 2 of The NBA Finals. A former ABA star who broke into coaching as an assistant to Hall of Famer Larry Brown, Moe compiled a 628-529 (.543) record in four seasons with the Spurs (1976-1980), 10 with the Nuggets (1980-1990) and one with the 76ers (1992-93). He did it with a system built on ball movement, screens, cuts and a commitment to players holding the ball for no longer than two seconds. It relied more on instinct, reflexes and athletic ability in reacting to whatever look the defense gave, rather than on some high-minded philosophy of Xs & Os. Among the Hall of Fame players who thrived in Moe\u2019s style: George Gervin, David Thompson and Alex English.  \u201cIn the 1970s and 80s, Doug Moe established a pace-and-space game that was decades ahead of its time,\u201d said Dallas Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle, also president of the NBCA who made the presentation. \u201cCongratulations to a true visionary on this special recognition of innovation and accomplishment.\u201d Moe called his offense \u201cthe passing game\u201d only because that sounded better \u2013 at least to the owners signing his paycheck \u2013 than describing it as the freelancing, read-and-react style it was. He playbook, as he described the style Sunday, was about this thick: \u201cGo out there, do what you want. Have a good time. Just make sure we win the game.\u201d \u201cPeople think we just roll the ball out there and play, and to some extent that\u2019s true,\u201d Moe told the Chicago Tribune in January 1988 , midway through his NBA Coach of the Year award season. Denver went 54-28 in 1987-88 and reached the playoffs, marking the 10th of 12 appearances there for Moe-coached teams. \u201cBut it takes discipline to play in our system,\u201d Moe said. \u201cBasically what we`re trying to do is keep teams off balance, not let them get set. We`re pretty good defensively. We`re not a great shooting team. But we get up more shots than our opponents, which allows us to shoot a little poorer. Our whole philosophy is to attack.\u201d In the decade that Moe coached the Nuggets, they led the NBA in scoring six times, finished second twice and ranked third once. The 1981-82 team averaged 126.5 points per game, which remains the highest single-season scoring average in league history. Of course, they gave up 126 points per game, also a record. Moe was Denver\u2019s coach on Dec. 13 1983 when the Nuggets scored 184 points \u2013 and lost to Detroit, which scored 186 in the triple-overtime affair. The Pistons were coached that day by Daly. Moe also grasped early what so many basketball experts have come to only recently: the concept of pace and how it related to the game\u2019s numbers. \u201cMost of my career, we\u2019ve been first in offense and last in defense,\u201d Moe told Sports Illustrated during his time in Denver . \u201cBut what people don\u2019t realize is that total scores have nothing to do with defense or offense, just the pace of the game. It\u2019s the dumbest statistic ever, totally wacko, and yet everyone uses the total scores as an indication of the kind of defense you play. \u201cI may not be the smartest guy in the world, but as long as people go by that stat, I know there\u2019s someone out there dumber than I am.\u201d The above quotes provide a glimpse of Moe\u2019s other distinguishing characteristic as an NBA coach. He was in it as much for the fun as for the competition or the cash. While any book on his offense might be nothing more than blank pages, an anthology of his wit and street-variety wisdom might require a second volume. \u201cDoug was the original free spirit,\u201d said longtime NBA writer Mike Monroe, who spent most of his career in Denver and San Antonio. \u201cHe was the ringleader of all kinds of stuff.\u201d Moe was notorious for his short and casual practices. He irritated the more button-down, whistle-toting types among his coaching brethren. He could get furious on the sideline while a game hung in the balance \u2014 one broadcaster called him \u201cbilingual,\u201d for Moe\u2019s mastery of both English and profanity \u2014 and in 1979 former NBA commissioner Larry O\u2019Brien once fined him $5,000 for suggesting in a postgame remark that the night\u2019s referees \u201cbe set before a firing squad.\u201d After a sufficient cooling-off period, though, that and every other game was over. Moe had an ability to move on almost blithely, like few in his profession. \u201cWhen Doug gets on you, his voice cuts through to your soul,\u201d Kiki Vandeweghe, currently NBA Executive Vice President, Basketall Operations, once said while playing for Moe in Denver. \u201cIf you play poorly, he\u2019ll yell and scream and hate you during the game. But after the game you can still be the best of friends.\u201d Monroe talked about Moe\u2019s penchant for needling anyone and everyone, particularly those of whom he was most fond. \u2018\u201cDips\u2019 is what he called you,\u201d Monroe said. \u201cAnd he\u2019s the head dip[bleep]. He has his \u2018Dip lunches,\u2019 where everybody was insulting and busting on each other. The only rule: no basketball talk. And Doug would always pick up the tab.\u201d A native of Brooklyn born in 1938, Moe was recruited to the University of North Carolina. While home one summer, he was offered a bribe to participate in a point-shaving scheme. He declined it but traveled out of friendship with another player to meet with the gambler. When Moe accepted $75 offered for his traveling expenses to and from the meeting, he put himself in the crosshairs of a legal crackdown on collegiate basketball at that time. Drafted by the Chicago Packers in 1961, Moe \u2014 though cleared \u2014 wound up blackballed in the NBA. He played professionally for a couple of seasons in Italy, then came back to the States when the American Basketball Association opened for business in 1967. He was a three-time All-Star in that upstart league, playing for four teams in five seasons, before knee problems ended his playing career. That\u2019s when his pal Larry Brown sought him out as an assistant coach, a role Moe, without any prodding, would have been happy to hold for life. Ambition is not high on his list of life\u2019s priorities. \u201cMy big advantage over other people,\u201d Moe said when he was 50, \u201cis that I\u2019ve always been less mature than my age. Even though my body is old and I can barely walk, mentally I\u2019m still 12.\u201d For instance, he has always called his wife \u201cBig Jane\u201d for \u201cno particular reason\u201d despite her normal stature. Despite his career-long quest for fun and flippant approach to many topics, Moe does sound proud of his place in crafting an offensive approach more embraced than ever in the NBA. He was thrilled back in the \u201870s when the league adopted the ABA\u2019s 3-point shot, the cornerstone of today\u2019s game. The question is inevitable: If the 3-pointer were more widely embraced in the 1980s, would Moe\u2019s have exploited it? Keep in mind, those 1981-82 Nuggets that averaged 126.5 point took a total of 149 3-pointers that season, making just 40. The average team in 2017-18 shot 2,378 3-pointers and made 860 \u2013 yet averaged 106.3 points. \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Moe said Sunday at the Daly presentation. \u201c[Our players] could shoot a 3-pointer anytime they wanted. It was up to the players. The problem is, you\u2019ve got to be able to [make] \u2018em. \u201cWe only had one or two guys who ever shot threes. Then we had great scorers in [Alex] English, Kiki Vandeweghe and Dan Issel. So at that time, we didn\u2019t need quite as many threes. But they were free to do whatever they wanted. \u201cIt was a fun way to play and, after you play it a while, the players don\u2019t want to run plays. If things started going bad, I\u2019d threaten to run plays and they\u2019d always start playing better.\u201d The NBCA Daly award, which honors the Naismith Basketball Hall of Famer and original \u201cDream Team\u201d coach, is chosen by the Award Selection Committee.

One is Andre Iguodala (2015), who has a bone bruise, didn\u2019t suit up for Game 1 and perhaps won\u2019t be healthy for Game 2 , (8 ET, on ABC) either. The second is LeBron James (2016), who went nuclear in the opener with 51 points and his searing post-season run has the Warriors on high alert. And the third is Kevin Durant (2017) who right now is flip-flopping between Iguodala and LeBron: Half-missing, half-dangerous. If not for the follies of the referees, George Hill and especially JR Smith in Game 1, the player on the griddle right now would be Durant, who remained drifting in and out of a mysterious shooting funk and was bailed out by an overturned call, a missed free throw and a forgetful Cavaliers guard. Taking it a step further, Steph Curry took the mic from Durant and is now the Warriors\u2019 lead singer at least until further notice, or when Durant remembers what the summer of 2017 was like for him. He\u2019s not the Durant of last year\u2019s Finals, not yet anyway, and you wonder if this could cost the Warriors a game or two, or even the series if Klay Thompson\u2019s bum ankle becomes a problem and LeBron stays locked in his trance of a historic level. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t probably been as consistent as he was last year,\u201d said Warriors coach Steve Kerr, \u201cbut neither have we. I would say that about every one of our guys. It\u2019s been a little different vibe, but that\u2019s OK. Every trip is a little different. We\u2019re where we want to be and we\u2019re all very confident that we\u2019re going to get better from here.\u201d The opening game of this series reflected Durant\u2019s entire postseason. Sharp one moment and flawed the next, these lapses are alarming only because it\u2019s quite a contrast from the Durant who was the best player in a series that included LeBron in Warriors-Cavaliers III. And also because James is on such an elevated level right now, ripping through defenses and strutting while Durant often struggles. The contrast between the two is wider than expected. Durant\u2019s fingerprints were all over the final crazy seconds of Game 1, where he could\u2019ve easily been the goat. First: After apparently losing confidence in his jumper after missing seven of eight 3-point shots, Durant forced his way to the rim and drew contact with LeBron, who provided late help. The initial call of an offensive foul was overturned only because another referee mistakenly thought LeBron was in the restricted area, which gave the refs a chance to use instant replay and call LeBron for blocking instead. Second: After Hill missed a free throw that would\u2019ve given the Cavs a one-point lead with 4.7 seconds left, Durant forgot to box out Smith, who snuck in for the rebound. Warriors coach Steve Kerr at that moment was incredulous, but unless you\u2019ve been living in a cave, you\u2019re aware of what Smith did right after that , taking Durant off the hook. Also: With Iguodala sidelined, Durant didn\u2019t offer much resistance against LeBron, who shot a high percentage against a player who claimed he deserved mention for the league\u2019s all-defensive team. Interestingly, the Warriors were plus-17 with Durant on the floor of that overtime game, which seems to contradict plenty, but even Durant knows he wasn\u2019t completely himself. \u201cI didn\u2019t take smart shots,\u201d he said. \u201cI took risky shots. I took some shots I know I can hit, but I\u2019d rather get better ones than that.\u201d When Durant led the Warriors to their second title in three years last summer, it was a coronation for him. He took some public grief after leaving Oklahoma City but it turned out well; the Warriors were energized by his presence, went undefeated in the Western Conference playoffs and then beat LeBron and the Cavs in five games. Plus, in that championship series he enjoyed the rarefied air of a true superstar, outplaying LeBron and winning series MVP after averaging 35.2 points on 55 percent shooting. The signature play was his go-ahead pull-up jumper from 3-point range with 45 seconds left in Game 3 , which he swished with LeBron in his face. After that experience, Durant didn\u2019t dispute the growing notion that he was one of the game\u2019s top five players, or perhaps No. 2 after LeBron. Blessed with a long wingspan, a high release point on his jumper, shooting range of 30 feet and the dexterity to execute a crossover dribble to swoop to the rim at 6-11, Durant made a compelling case. Plus, his defense vastly improved and increased his value at the other rim. Something changed since then. His 2017-18 regular season numbers were in line with his career marks, but then the Rockets stumbled upon something that stumped Durant in the West finals. He scored 37 and 38 points in the first two games, then shot 9-24, 8-22 and 6-17 over the next three. The Rockets used a switching defense to keep Durant under control. Only once in the last five postseason games has he made half his shots, and in a pair of fourth quarters he had just one basket combined. \u201cI\u2019m not worried about my makes or misses,\u201d he said. \u201cAm I getting good, quality shots? After that, the rest will take care of itself.\u201d Kerr makes a point to mention the tough shots Durant took and made in the clincher against the Rockets, yet admits this: \u201cHe knows he didn\u2019t play well in Game 1. He\u2019s excited for Game 2.\u201d Durant had the benefit of Iguodala last year and therefore didn\u2019t need to burn so much energy guarding LeBron. With Iguodala still questionable, Durant must help on LeBron, and like all the others who chipped in, failed to distinguish himself in Game 1. The Warriors are fortunate that unlike Durant, Curry is near peak form. He finished strongly against the Rockets and that carried over to the Cavs. Bouncy and frisky, Curry is on pace to cause trouble for Cleveland, with 29 points and nine assists in the opener, including a big reverse layup in the final seconds. Keep in mind that Curry\u2019s no longer worrying about guarding Kyrie Irving, and therefore isn\u2019t costing himself calories at both ends. If not for some unfortunate late-game incidents, though, the Cavs could\u2019ve beaten Golden State anyway. That\u2019s how much of a beast LeBron is, and there\u2019s the realistic possibility of little or no drop-off in production from James. Speaking of possibilities: Thompson is still wincing from a sore ankle after being undercut Thursday by Smith. He returned and played the final three quarters and overtime, but surprisingly wouldn\u2019t rule himself in for Game 2. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said, and as for the pain? \u201cNot good.\u201d When Curry was out mending from a knee injury and Thompson went hot and cold with his shooting in the first few playoff rounds, Durant was consistently good and even great, carrying the club in scoring and delivering in close games. Can he be that player again, with the trophy on the line? \u201cWe\u2019re all a victim of expectations that we\u2019ve set,\u201d said Curry. \u201cI mean, the fact they\u2019re saying KD had a bad game is kind of funny, just with what you expect from him every night. \u201cBut we\u2019re all in this together. We know we won Game 1 by the skin of our teeth. Now we\u2019ve got to go play better, take control of the series. And KD is going to have a huge part in that, for sure.\u201d * * * Veteran NBA writer Shaun Powell has worked for newspapers and other publications for more than 25 years.

Smith's impact on Finals grows","content":" OAKLAND, Calif. \u2013 Maybe J.R. Smith won\u2019t be such a goat for the Cleveland Cavaliers after all. Smith, whose mental mistake late in regulation contributed to the Game 1 defeat Cleveland suffered in overtime Thursday, was responsible for a play earlier in the night that could benefit the Cavaliers in Game 2 of The Finals . Golden State All-Star guard Klay Thompson limped and moved slowly before and after meeting with reporters Saturday, acknowledging that his left lateral leg contusion had gotten worse over the previous 24 hours. It\u2019s possible Thompson won\u2019t be able to play in Game 2 or might be limited in his effectiveness if he does. And Smith is the man who inadvertently caused Thompson to get hurt in the first place. Smith, 32, lunged for a loose ball midway through the first quarter of the series opener, but appeared to slip and slammed into Thompson\u2019s legs. The angle and impact suggested a serious injury, possibly to one of Thompson\u2019s knees, but the sharpshooting guard returned by the start of the second quarter and finished Game 1 with 24 points in 45 minutes. But Thompson\u2019s healing process, encouraging from Thursday to Friday, had reversed itself by Saturday. \u201cJust swelling, stiffness,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cI kind of expected it when the game ended because the adrenaline is not kicked in and you aren\u2019t moving as much as you were. Because right when it happens, you can play. I\u2019ve done it before. You can play on it; once you stop and go to bed that night, it kind of swells up.\u201d Thompson said he planned to do what he could in the hours leading up to Game 2 to stay loose and reduce swelling in what he\u2019s calling a high ankle sprain. He admitted that, in watching replays of the mishap, he got angry. \u201cThat\u2019s a tough play on the ball, and then just to tumble into somebody\u2019s legs like that,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to move past it. It\u2019s just life, and I\u2019m going to be better from it. It\u2019s just a minor setback. But I don\u2019t think it was intentional.\u201d Reckless as Smith\u2019s maneuver was, he did show concern for Thompson as the Warriors player writhed on the court. \u201cYeah, he was remorseful, so I don\u2019t think he meant to do it. It just sucks,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cIt\u2019s a part of the game. It just sucks for the timing, during The Finals. But no one is going to feel sorry for us or me. I\u2019ve just got to do everything I possibly can these next 24 hours to be right for [Game 2].\u201d Said Smith: \u201cI was just trying to go for the ball. It looked like an opportunity for me to get a steal. Unfortunately, I didn\u2019t. I fouled him. They called the foul. I don\u2019t know what more he was looking for.\u201d No one is going to laud Smith for hurting an opposing player. But the reality is, if Thompson is hobbled and Warriors defender Andre Iguodala \u2013 listed as doubtful with a similar bone bruise suffered in the West finals \u2013 isn\u2019t available, Golden State\u2019s ability to deal with LeBron James and other Cleveland scoring threats is hampered. So if Smith can contribute in that way to an advantageous Cavs\u2019 position for Game 2, it might soothe some of the sting from Game 1. He\u2019s the guy, remember, who grabbed teammate George Hill\u2019s missed free throw late in regulation but oddly dribbled away from the basket to squander a chance to win and avoid overtime. Despite appearances, what even some Cleveland players concluded \u2013 that Smith must have thought his team was ahead, rather than tied at 107-107 at that moment \u2013 and a personal history of making similar gaffes, Smith claimed after the game that he indeed did know the score. He backed off that version Saturday. \u201cAfter thinking about it a lot the last 24 hours or however many since the game was over,\u201d Smith said, \u201cI can\u2019t say I was sure of anything at that point.\u201d Now that has the ring of truth to it for Earl Smith III. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Smith eager to atone for Game 1 gaffe","content":"OAKLAND, Calif. \u2014 Two days later, there is still no clarity on what J.R. Smith knew when he grabbed that offensive rebound in the final seconds of regulation of Game 1 of the NBA Finals. Not even in Smith\u2019s own mind. \u201cI can\u2019t say I was sure of anything at that point,\u201d Smith said. All he and the Cleveland Cavaliers are sure of now is this: They\u2019re down 1-0 to the Golden State Warriors in the NBA Finals, with Game 2 on Sunday night and Smith knowing that he\u2019s going to be booed, made fun of, mocked and probably worse by the crowd at Oracle Arena. Smith became one of the big Game 1 stories for all the wrong reasons. He grabbed an offensive rebound off a missed free throw in the final seconds of regulation with the game tied, then r an toward midcourt as if he was running out the clock and thinking Cleveland had a one-point lead. The Cavaliers wound up losing in overtime. \u201cHe probably took that loss as hard as anybody on the team,\u201d Cavs star LeBron James said Saturday. \u201cBut one thing about J.R., he has an uncanny ability to bounce back. I think people have seen that throughout our postseason runs, where he hasn\u2019t played well or played to his ability that he thinks he should have played, and then the next game he comes on and shoots the ball extremely well.\u201d That bounce-back tendency for Smith will be tested now like perhaps never before. This wasn\u2019t just a gaffe. This was a huge gaffe, in the final seconds of the fourth quarter of Game 1 of the NBA Finals with the game on the line. And in the immediate aftermath, it appeared Smith said to James on the court that he thought the Cavs were leading \u2014 something he denied afterward. \u201cI might have said that,\u201d Smith said. \u201cNot sure, but I might have.\u201d To say Smith was the reason Cleveland lost Thursday night isn\u2019t right, or fair. There\u2019s no guarantee that Cleveland would have scored to win the game in those final seconds if Smith had done anything differently. Still, he was blamed. \u201cI\u2019m glad it happened to me as opposed to anybody else on my team,\u201d Smith said. \u201cTo be in that situation is tough and it\u2019s not a situation everybody can handle, so I\u2019m glad it happened to me.\u201d Smith spent Friday in his hotel room for the most part, watching the Memorial (\u201cTiger played really well,\u201d Smith said), talking with Kyle Korver and visiting with his kids over FaceTime. He knows he\u2019s a punch line. He\u2019s been there before. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty much who I\u2019ve been my whole life,\u201d said Smith, who bonded with a therapy dog earlier this season during a rough stretch. \u201cI\u2019ve always been the one guy who\u2019s the butt of the jokes, or that one guy who does something crazy and everybody\u2019s got to look at or whatever the case may be. And then I come back and be myself and play the next day. I don\u2019t really dwell on things too much. It\u2019s been like that my whole life. That\u2019s what it looks like it\u2019s going to continue to be.\u201d The Cavs have made clear that they\u2019re not quitting on Smith. They need him. \u201cHe\u2019s going to start. And no, I haven\u2019t lost confidence,\u201d coach Tyronn Lue said. \u201cJ.R. can shake off anything, and when everybody tends to count J.R. out, that\u2019s when he comes through. So he\u2019s definitely going to start again. He\u2019s a big part of what we do. That last play is over, it\u2019s behind us and now we\u2019ve got to move on.\u201d A bounce-back game would be more than welcomed by Cleveland. When Smith is good, the Cavs are really good. Cleveland is 10-1 this season, including playoffs, when Smith scores more than 15 points. The Cavaliers are 19-5 when he makes more than half his shot attempts. They\u2019re 20-9 when he makes at least three 3-pointers. Those are some of the many reasons why Lue still has confidence in him, and Smith clearly appreciates that. \u201cI\u2019ve been playing like dogcrap all year and he\u2019s stuck with me,\u201d Smith said. \u201cSo he\u2019s one of the people who gives me the most confidence.\u201d And he\u2019s due, too. Smith has missed more than half his shots in eight straight games \u2014 his longest such cold streak since November. The Warriors expect that Smith and the rest of the Cavaliers will be more than ready for Game 2. And Smith said his teammates still believing in him is helping. \u201cEverybody says it\u2019s not just the one play or the reason why we lost,\u201d Smith said. \u201cTake it however you want it. My teammates have been great. Very supportive.\u201d"},{"id":40186,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/cleveland-cavaliers-determined-bounce-back-crushing-game-1-loss","date":"2018-06-02","title":"Cleveland Cavaliers determined to bounce back from crushing Game 1 loss","content":"OAKLAND, Calif. \u2014 All the chatter is that underdog Cleveland could be completely deflated from the way it flopped in Game 1 of the NBA Finals. Determined and as motivated as ever might be more appropriate and fitting whenever LeBron James is in the mix. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the toughest losses I\u2019ve had in my career,\u201d James acknowledged Saturday, \u201cbecause of everything that kind of went on with the game and the way we played. Obviously, we all know what happened in the game.\u201d There were miscues aplenty, most notably J.R. Smith\u2019s offensive rebound in the final seconds of regulation that he dribbled back toward half-court in a tie game rather than shooting for a chance to win it \u2014 later insisting he knew the score, though that remains a huge mystery. The decision baffled a frustrated and stunned LeBron, who signaled at his teammate with arms pointed toward the basket. \u201cThe game\u2019s over. There\u2019s nothing we can do about it,\u201d Cavs coach Tyronn Lue said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to move on, move forward.\u201d James has done so all postseason with an edge, intensity and ability to all-out carry the Cavs \u2014 will them to win after win, if you wish. Yes, with King James on the other side in this familiar June rivalry, Golden State knows much better than to fall into such a trap that the Cavs might be down and out, even if the defending champions have some momentum going into Game 2 on Sunday night back home at Oracle Arena. The Warriors learned that lasting lesson two years ago, when James led the Cavaliers back from the brink \u2014 a daunting 3-1 series deficit \u2014 to capture a title in Game 7 on the Warriors\u2019 home floor. \u201cI know it\u2019s not the exact same team, but we had them down 3-1 a couple years ago. They might have been deflated, and they came back and won, so we\u2019re expecting another great effort from them,\u201d Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been through this too many times. We beat Houston on the road in Game 1 and the narrative was, you know, series is over. It seems to always be that way. There is just overreaction after a game.\u201d Draymond Green didn\u2019t sugarcoat it: Golden State got a little lucky to win Game 1 on a night James scored 51 points and the defending champions caught some big breaks. The Warriors hope to be far better with a chance to take a 2-0 series lead before the series shifts to Northwest Ohio. \u201cSometimes you need a little luck. It\u2019s good to be lucky sometimes,\u201d Green said. \u201cI\u2019ll take it.\u201d Kevin Durant wants the Warriors to remove the luck factor going forward. He even nit-picked that offensive board that Smith secured as something he should have done. \u201cAs you try to lock in on the details as much as possible, that luck factor \u2014 good luck, bad luck \u2014 you don\u2019t have it creep in if you figure out the detail parts,\u201d Durant said. \u201cTo be good at those parts of the game, then you don\u2019t let the luck creep in.\u201d Golden State gave up 19 offensive boards in all while getting only four. The Warriors know James is going to score his share of points. They just want to make it harder for him to get good looks, something that is a top priority going into Sunday. James, in his eighth straight NBA Finals and ninth overall, shot 19 for 32 to go with eight assists and eight rebounds in the opener. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to make them work harder in general,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cI thought our defense was subpar the other night.\u201d James said he is taking antibiotics and using eye drops after getting poked in the eye by Green in the first half. The outer area of James\u2019 eye was still red Saturday. Klay Thompson expects to play though is listed as questionable with what he called a sprained left ankle while Andre Iguodala remained doubtful as he works back from a bone bruise in his left knee suffered in Game 3 of the Western Conference finals against Houston and has cost him the last five games. Cleveland\u2019s J.R. Smith slid into Thompson\u2019s left leg in the first quarter of the series opener Thursday night. Thompson was dealing with stiffness, swelling and more pain Saturday. \u201cIt is a Finals game, and I\u2019m going to do everything I possibly can to play,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cIt\u2019s something you definitely don\u2019t want to have in the NBA championship.\u201d Nor does James want blood in his eye to affect his vision or alter his view of the basket. So, did he go off for 51 with only one good eye? \u201cNo, I had some points before that already,\u201d a good-natured James said, chuckling."},{"id":40182,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/hang-time-podcast-nba-finals-game-2-preview","date":"2018-06-02","title":"Hang Time Podcast: NBA Finals Game 2 preview","content":"* Sunday on ABC: NBA Finals, Game 2 (8 ET) John Schuhmann joins me in Oakland to discuss the latest NBA Finals storylines before Game 2 of Cavaliers-Warriors on Sunday ( 8 ET, ABC ). * * * Subscribe to the Hang Time podcast on Apple Podcasts or iHeart Radio for a new episode after each NBA Finals game!"},{"id":40157,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/klay-thompson-ankle-injury","date":"2018-06-02","title":"Golden State Warriors' Klay Thompson dealing with left ankle injury, 'optimistic' for Game 2","content":"Golden State Warriors guard Klay Thompson is dealing with a high left ankle sprain, but is expecting to play in Sunday\u2019s Game 2 of the NBA Finals.

In the Western Conference finals , the Houston Rockets tried to get Stephen Curry switched onto James Harden as much as possible, so that Harden could attack Curry in isolation. In the Eastern Conference finals , the Cleveland Cavaliers tried to get Terry Rozier switched onto LeBron James, so that James could back Rozier down into the post. Appropriately, we now have the Cavs trying to get Curry switched onto James in The Finals . And if you watched the end of Game 1, you saw a lot of just that. The Cavs looked for a Curry switch onto James on their last seven possessions of regulation and their first five possessions of overtime. In total, there were 36 occasions on Thursday where the guy Curry was guarding set a screen for James or James set a screen for the guy Curry was guarding. Sometimes, the Cavs got the switch, and sometimes they didn\u2019t. And overall, the results were better for the Warriors than they were for the Cavs. On the 31 possessions in which one of those James-Curry screens were set, the Cavs scored just 31 points, a rate of exactly one point per possession. Cleveland scored 83 points (1.28 per possession) on their other 67 possessions of Game 1. Overall, it wasn\u2019t a great defensive performance for Golden State. Through the conference finals, the Warriors were the best defensive team in the postseason , allowing less than a point per possession over their 17 games. They held the San Antonio Spurs, New Orleans Pelicans and Houston Rockets well below their regular-season marks in offensive efficiency. With that in consideration, the Cavs were rather efficient in Game 1. James scored 51 points on 19-for-32 shooting, and also had eight of Cleveland\u2019s 18 assists. But it wasn\u2019t really because of all those James-Curry screens. In fact, only 23 of the Cavs\u2019 114 points (and 19 of James\u2019 51) were a direct result of a screen involving both James and Curry. Of course, 10 of those 23 points came on the last seven possessions of regulation, when the Cavs came back from a six-point deficit to \u2026 almost win. If you focus on crunch time, the James-Curry actions may have seemed more successful than they were overall. The string of 12 straight Cleveland possessions with a screen involving both James and Curry began with less than four minutes to go in regulation. And it began with the Warriors trying to avoid the switch (what they had been doing for most of the night) by having Curry \u201chedge\u201d on the screen. With J.R. Smith setting the screen for James, Curry stepped out to make James pause, so that Kevin Durant could recover\u2026 But Durant never got back in front of James, who had a direct line to the basket for a layup\u2026 From that point on, the Warriors chose to switch the screen, with the idea that a defender, even if it was Curry, would be in front of James at all times. On the very next possession, Cleveland set a staggered screen for James, with Curry as the target\u2026 Curry made the switch\u2026 But James acted quickly and got around him for a dunk\u2026 A few possessions later, there was another switch after Smith set a screen for James\u2026 When Curry turned his shoulders so that they were more parallel to the sideline, James saw an opening\u2026 He attacked and powered through Kevon Looney for an and-one that put Cleveland ahead by two. On the Cavs\u2019 final possession of regulation, with Golden State up by one, the Warriors double-teamed James for the first time in the game after George Hill (guarded by Curry) set a screen\u2026 After that, both teams were kind of scrambled. James got the ball back with Curry defending him, but with Durant and Draymond Green zoned up at the foul line\u2026 Hill smartly cut to the basket to force Klay Thompson to either leave him open for a layup or leave Kyle Korver open for a corner 3-pointer. Thompson instead fouled Hill, giving him the opportunity to win the game at the line. Of course, Hill missed the second free throw, Smith didn\u2019t know the score, the Warriors won in overtime, and the brilliance of Hill\u2019s cut was lost in the aftermath. And of course, the Cavs weren\u2019t always so successful with screens involving James and Curry as they were late in the fourth quarter. Late in the first quarter, the Cavs got a Curry-onto-James switch with a staggered screen. Initially, the Cavs weren\u2019t spaced well, allowing Nick Young to hang out in the paint\u2026 With Smith clearing out to the right wing, *James attacked once Young started moving in that direction. * A common theme here: James attacking at the exact moment a defender\u2019s movement creates a sliver of an opening. In the first example above, it was when Curry started to recover back to his man. Then, it was when Curry opened up his defensive stance. Here, it\u2019s when the help-defender (Young) starts to vacate his spot in the paint. But the Warriors collapsed into the paint before James could get into the basket, leaving three shooters open on the right side of the floor\u2026 In Game 1, the Warriors did not pay for this kind of attention on James, as his teammates shot 7-for-30 (23 percent) from 3-point range. On this possession, Jeff Green missed a three from the corner. Midway through the second quarter, the Cavs got the switch again, but it took two screens from Jordan Clarkson before the Warriors yielded, so there were only nine seconds left on the shot clock\u2026 James drove past Curry, but Durant helped off of Green to keep James from getting all the way to the basket (where he shot 9-for-10 on Thursday)\u2026 Jordan Bell was able to close out and run Green off the 3-point line. He eventually found Clarkson at the top of the key, but Clarkson had a rough night. Both the Green shot and the Clarkson shot took place with six or fewer seconds left on the shot clock. The Cavs had the ball for almost six more minutes than the Warriors did in Game 1 , and they obviously want to play more deliberately than Golden State. But according to Second Spectrum tracking, Cleveland shot 4-for-19 (including 0-for-9 from 3-point range) in the last six seconds of the shot clock. They also had a 24-second violation after a Curry switch onto James later in the second quarter. The Warriors preferred to hedge those screens in Game 1, so that Durant could continue guarding James. But the good thing about the switches was that (for the most part) it kept a defender in front of James and forced him to use more clock. (They also forced him to use more clock by fighting through an initial screen and making Cleveland re-screen to get the switch.) Cleveland probably won\u2019t shoot 4-for-19 in the last six seconds of the shot clock again. But league-wide, shooting is worse in the last six seconds (effective field goal percentage of 43 percent) than it is with 7-12 seconds left on the clock (51 percent). Every second counts. James has more than twice as many late-clock buckets as any other player in the postseason , but his teammates have not shot well in those situations . So if, after a switch, the Warriors can make him use more clock and then force the ball out of his hands, they should be pretty happy with the results. * * * John Schuhmann is a staff writer for NBA.com.

As we get going here, let\u2019s be candid and admit that the only reason we\u2019re sticking with the \u201cFive things \u2026\u201d concept is because it\u2019s a Finals tradition around here. Fact is, we could have redubbed it \u201cFourteen things \u2026\u201d and still have had to cram in a few combo items to do justice to every crazy moment, crucial play and instance of high drama or low comedy in this one. We\u2019re starting with a macro take on the night\u2019s most hotly debated play, namely, the block\/charge call in the final minute that swung from Cleveland\u2019s advantage to Golden State\u2019s. The aftermath, in volume of commentary and in intensity, suggests we\u2019ve hit on a big-picture issue that relates not just to this Warriors-Cavaliers redux. It cuts across all sports and reaches into the culture and society, too, if we let it. The issue essentially is: Do we want to get things \u201cright?\u201d Or do we want to follow the rules? Folks incensed that the referees in Game 1 were able to go back in time and get a do-over on a judgment call when LeBron James\u2019 defensive collision with lane-attacking Kevin Durant was ruled first a charge, then overturned after replay review and labeled a blocking foul. It does not seem to matter to those upset by the process that the final outcome seemed to be correct \u2014 James had not established proper \u201cguarding position\u201d and was both moving and turning sideways at the time of contact. So what, skeptics say. It\u2019s wrong to overturn some calls and not others. Well, the referees did follow the rules, as we wrote about here . Trouble is, it\u2019s a tricky rule \u2014 a compound rule, if you will, with cascading consequences \u2014 only recently (2012-13) instituted. And it flies in the face of what preceded it by more than six decades, as far as unblowing whistles and unseeing infractions. Kind of like the use of video replays in the moment themselves. Now that it\u2019s here, though, who willingly would go back and do without it? Like air conditioning, DVRs or any other technological advancement. Here are some random thoughts on the play and its aftermath: \u2022 Everyone who says James\u2019 sneakers \u201cclearly\u201d were not in the restricted area saw a replay that confirmed it. Why shouldn\u2019t the referees, working at court level, get the same views? \u2022 Referee Ken Mauer, near the baseline with the play moving toward him, hesitated in making his charge call. It looks like he noticed colleague Tony Brothers, on the left wing, about to call James for a block. That difference in how they saw the play \u2014 besides illustrating how 50\/50 such calls can be \u2014 might have been enough, human nature intruding, to send them to the replay machinery. That, and the fact that the convergence of three pairs of feet (James\u2019, Durant\u2019s and initial defender Jeff Green\u2019s) might have planted doubt about someone stepping on the semi-circle. \u2022 People livid at Mauer for changing the call, chill. It was veteran referee Mike Callahan in the Replay Center in Secaucus, N.J., who overturned Mauer\u2019s charge call. \u2022 What\u2019s so special about block\/charge calls that they should be eligible to be overturned, based on the technical matter of feet-in-restricted area? Why is that one replay \u201ctrigger\u201d larded up with the extra options? That isn\u2019t the case on out-of-bounds plays, for instance. If someone whacks the arm of the player who last touched the ball, the refs aren\u2019t allowed to call that foul off replay. It creates the opportunity for a bogus claim about the restricted area, just to get another bite at the apple of the tough block\/charge decision. \u2022 What\u2019s so special about the final two minutes of the game that none of this applies to the first 46? The best way to address that last point: Allow. Coaches. Challenges. If both sides got two opportunities per game to ask the referees to review a play, a whole bunch of equally pivotal moments that get brushed aside through the first 95.8 percent of any game. Cleveland point guard George Hill sat for a long time after the game at his stall in the visitors\u2019 dressing room staring at his phone. He trudged around the shower\/sink area for a while, grimacing here, flailing an arm there, by himself, the other Cavs occupied with their own postgame business, his body language some mix of disgust and frustration. Hill \u2014 a career 80 percent free-throw shooter \u2014 had missed a chance with 4.7 seconds left to win Game 1, in a Finals for which he\u2019s waited his whole career. If Hill completes that simple (for him, most of the time) basketball task, J.R. Smith\u2019s subsequent brain cramp as the clock ran out in regulation, the block\/charge controversy, the skirmishes at the end of OT that might impact Game 2 \u2014 none of that matters or even happens. While Smith and Tristan Thompson took their turns standing in front of and taking questions about their antics from a glut of reporters and camera wielders in the Cavs\u2019 locker room, Hill slipped out. He got a pass on addressing his plummet from potential hero to goat. Hill expressed his feelings about the missed free throw at a media conference call Friday afternoon. We get it. Nobody in sports likes being \u201cshown up.\u201d It\u2019s understandable to not be pleased when an opponent adds an unnecessary flourish to their victory, like a pitcher staring down a batter he\u2019s just struck out or, in this case, like Golden State\u2019s Shaun Livingston firing up a shot with only a few seconds left in a game his team led by eight. But do you rumble over and foul Livingston the way Thompson did, earning himself a flagrant 2 foul and instant ejection? Brothers, the ref on that play, saw Thompson\u2019s elbow coming up high and cocking, at least from his point of view. Keep in mind, the shot clock was expiring before the game clock, and Warriors coach Steve Kerr instructs his guys to shoot rather than take intentional turnovers in such circumstances. What follows, though, is Thompson \u2014 already ejected from the game \u2014 staying on the floor long enough to push the basketball into Draymond Green\u2019s face, while making hand-to-head contact. Cue histrionics and extracurriculars, including Kevin Love appearing to come off the Cavs\u2019 bench in the kerfuffle. That\u2019s strictly prohibited, prompting some on social media to call for Love as well as Thompson to face suspensions from Game 2. In Love\u2019s case, he already had stepped on the floor, inside the 3-point line, to make some other point. So he ought not face any repercussions. Thompson? Well, he had no business still being on the court at all when he engaged Green. A swifter exit might have saved him from himself. But the larger point here is, enough with the \u201ccodes\u201d by which players (and baseball managers) temporarily lose their minds over some stupid, perceived affront to their pride in the dwindling seconds of a decided game. Pushing back against that nonsense is a waste of time and potentially detrimental to the next game. Beat them. That\u2019s it. To the victors go the spoils. Players show themselves up if they let that into their heads. If a legendary NBA player scored 51 points in nearly 48 minutes on the floor, with eight rebounds and eight assists, and everyone was too distracted or agitated to notice properly, did it happen?Like the tree falling in the proverbial forest, yes, yes it did. James turned in a Finals performance for the ages, only the sixth game of 50 points or more in NBA playoff history \u2014 and the first for a team that lost. James no doubt would have preferred to finish with 49 points and a minus-3 in plus\/minus for the game, if only Hill had scored eight points instead of seven. James was 0 for 4 with two free throws, one rebound, one block and a minus-10 in the extra five minutes. Also overshadowed: Love looking fine after missing Game 7 of the East finals at Boston and spending a week in the NBA\u2019s concussion protocol program. The Cavs forward had 21 points and 13 rebounds in 39 minutes, All-Star numbers that will need to be replicated through the series if Cleveland hopes to recover and win it. Klay Thompson\u2019s 24-point night also got neglected in most accounts, notable because most of it came after his services appeared to be lost to Golden State for the night, perhaps for the Finals. That came midway through the first quarter when Smith recklessly dove for a loose ball, slamming into Thompson\u2019s left leg and bending it in a way that screamed out \u201cACL damage!\u201d The Warriors didn\u2019t just get lucky when J.R. did his J.R thing near the end. By returning, Thompson also was able to chip in superior postgame quotage: \u201cMy spot-up ability will always gravitate the defense.\u201d This wasn\u2019t like Pete Carroll \u2014 oops! \u2014 calling a pass play for the Seahawks near the end of Super Bowl XLIX. Plenty of time here for the various miscues and controversies to be righted or forgotten in a best-of-seven series. Whether they are or not depends on the Cavaliers\u2019 resiliency vs. temptation to feel sorry for themselves. On the Warriors\u2019 understanding that they caught nearly every break and still scrambled to win at home. And on the continued healing process of Golden State\u2019s chief LeBron defender, Andre Iguodala, from the bone bruise in his left leg that kept him sidelined Thursday. James likes to call Game 1 of any series a \u201cfeel-out game,\u201d and often dials up his production from there. What, in the name of all that\u2019s holy, if he does that again? For the record, teams that win Game 1 of the Finals are 50-21 (.704) through the years at actually winning the championship. Those who snag the opener at home are 42-12 (.748). Finally, we\u2019ll exit on this, a different camera angle than the one seen on the official postgame broadcasts. Instead of cutting away to the questioner, relating info about Smith, it stays on Green in all his comedic mugging glory. # # # Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

The person spoke on condition of anonymity Friday because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter. Beilein led the Wolverines to the NCAA championship game this past season, the second time in six years he\u2019d accomplished that. Michigan lost to Louisville in 2013 and Villanova this year. The Pistons are searching for a new coach after Stan Van Gundy\u2019s ouster. Van Gundy spent four seasons as their coach, and he was also in charge of basketball operations. Detroit now has to fill both those roles. The 65-year-old Beilein has been at Michigan for 11 seasons. ESPN first reported Beilein\u2019s interview with the Pistons. In addition to his two Final Four appearances, Beilein has won Big Ten titles at Michigan in 2012 and 2014, and he won the Big Ten Tournament in 2017 and 2018. Long considered one of college basketball\u2019s top offensive minds, Beilein produced a team this season that was one of the best in the country at the defensive end. Michigan now has to replace big man Moe Wagner, who left school early for the NBA, but Charles Matthews announced this week he was staying with the Wolverines. Michigan is also bringing in a top-20 recruiting class this coming season, according to Scout.com.

The incident took place with five seconds left in the Warriors\u2019 eventual 124-114 win . Per Yahoo Sports\u2019 Chris Mannix, the NBA will not suspend Cavs forward Kevin Love for leaving the bench in the closing seconds of that game : The news was also reported by the San Francisco Chronicle and ESPN.com . As the clock was winding down in Game 1, there were only 2.5 seconds left on the shot clock. Warriors guard Shaun Livingston took a midrange jumper and Thompson contested the shot. In doing so, Thompson appeared to connect with the right side of Livingston\u2019s chest. Thompson was whistled for a Flagrant 2 foul, which warrants an automatic ejection. After being ejected, Thompson and Green exchanged words and Thompson shoved the ball in Green\u2019s face. ESPN\u2019s Dave McMenamin reports via Twitter that as of Friday afternoon the NBA is still reviewing Thompson\u2019s actions at the end of Game 1. If a suspension is forthcoming for him, it will be announced later today. Here\u2019s more from McMenamin, via Twitter : According to ESPN\u2019s Chris Haynes, Thompson was unsure about why he was being ejected : Love told ESPN he was not worried about facing a potential suspension for Sunday\u2019s Game 2 ( 8 ET, ABC ). In an interview with NBA TV after Game 1, Livingston said he wasn\u2019t trying to disrespect the Cavs with his late shot. He also didn\u2019t think he was fouled flagrantly by Thompson. \u201cWe don\u2019t ever take the turnover. We finish the game out. That\u2019s just how we play. That\u2019s no disrespect to any team, whether its preseason or The Finals,\u201d Livingston said. \u201cKevin [Durant] threw me the ball in my sweet spot and the clock was going down so I took the shot. \u201cI thought he was just trying to take the foul.

According to ESPN.com and Philly.com, the investigation is ongoing, but it may not end well for Colangelo. According to both websites, some league sources say that Colangelo may lose his job as Sixers president as a result of the incident. The Ringer website alleged in a report Tuesday night that Colangelo is connected to anonymous Twitter accounts that have revealed sensitive team information and criticized players and coach Brett Brown. Per ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski and Zach Lowe, the Sixers have focused their investigation on Colangelo\u2019s wife, Barbara Bottini, and her possible connection with the burner Twitter accounts : Keith Pompey of Philly.com reports that Colangelo has not been absent for the last two days of the agent-run predraft workouts being held on the West Coast this week. In addition, a league source told Pompey that Colangelo was visably shaken when the report broke while he was attending the workout in Los Angeles . According to ESPN\u2019s league sources, the Sixers also commissioned an outside law firm to investigate the matter, an investigation that has already included Colangelo surrending his cell phones. In addition, league sources told ESPN that Colangelo has told close associates he knows who made the tweets. But he also insisted to those inside and outside of the investigation that he had nothing to do with the tweets and was unaware of them until The Ringer brought them to the team\u2019s attention prior to publishing the story. NBA commissioner Adam Silver responded the Colangelo\/Sixers issue at his Finals news conference Thursday, saying the investigation will be get done, but not by cutting corners. \u201cWell, for the league there is always that balance of speed and doing things in a deliberate and appropriate way,\u201d Silver said. \u201cSo I have talked to management at the 76ers, and the notion here was let\u2019s find out what\u2019s going on. * Aschburner:  Silver weighs in on cap system, parity \u201cSo, of course, from the league standpoint, here we are, Game 1 of The Finals, it\u2019s not necessarily something we want to be talking about, but it\u2019s the reality of this league,\u201d Silver added. \u201cSo I have no information beyond that other than that investigation is underway.\u201d The Sixers started their investigation into tweets linked in a report to Colangelo that criticized Sixers players Joel Embiid and Markelle Fultz, among other NBA figures. The burner accounts also took aim at former Sixers general manager Sam Hinkie, Toronto Raptors executive Masai Ujiri and former Sixers players Jahlil Okafor and Nerlens Noel, according to a report by The Ringer website . \u201cThe allegations are serious and we have commenced an independent investigation into the matter,\u201d the Sixers said Wednesday in a statement. \u201cWe will report the results of that investigation as soon as it is concluded.\u201d The website asked the team about five Twitter accounts it suspected Colangelo was operating. He said in a statement that he used one of the accounts to monitor the NBA industry and other current events, but that he was \u201cnot familiar with any of the other accounts\u201d brought to his attention and that he didn\u2019t know who was \u201cbehind them or what their motives may be in using them.\u201d Embiid, the 24-year-old All-Star center, tweeted that he didn\u2019t believe the report. \u201cI don\u2019t believe the story. That would just be insane,\u201d he wrote. Colangelo was hired as president of basketball operations for Philadelphia in April 2016. He served as Toronto\u2019s general manager from 2006-2013. Colangelo, the son of longtime sports executive Jerry Colangelo, stepped in with the Sixers after Hinkie resigned. He lost his GM job in Toronto after the Raptors missed the playoffs for the fifth consecutive season, and Ujiri took over basketball operations. According to The Ringer, one of the Twitter accounts it connected to Colangelo downplayed Hinkie\u2019s role in the franchise\u2019s turnaround. It also lamented in another post that Ujiri hadn\u2019t done anything to make the Raptors better. Another account accused Embiid of \u201cplaying like a toddler having tantrums,\u201d and one criticized Fultz for his work with his \u201cso called mentor\/father figure.\u201d Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":40239,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/lebron-james-overshadowed-36-befuddling-seconds-cleveland-cavaliers","date":"2018-06-01","title":"LeBron James' greatness overshadowed by 36 befuddling seconds","content":" OAKLAND, Calif. \u2014 An extended opening game of the NBA Finals showed the enormity of what LeBron James is up against and must overcome: the defending champion Warriors and his own teammates. Oh, and toss in a critical referee flip-flop that also worked against him, and you can understand how LeBron can deliver an epic performance , even for him, and still walk away empty. Years from now, history will stammer to explain how the final crazed seconds of regulation in Game 1 robbed a man who literally had blood in his eye, scored 51 points, disrupted all of those projections of doom for the heavily-underdog Cavaliers and shook everyone at Oracle Arena. \u201cWe got lucky,\u201d admitted Warriors coach Steve Kerr. An offensive foul drawn by LeBron with 36 seconds left and Cleveland up two being overturned after video review and resulting in two Warriors free throws? Yep. A missed second free throw attempt by George Hill, in his first Finals appearance, that would\u2019ve put the Cavs up a point with 4.7 seconds left in regulation? Uh-huh. An offensive rebound of that miss by JR Smith, who then suffered a brain cramp and dribbled out the clock for some still-unexplained reason? Um, the game was tied. Whoops. So of course, after being bailed out, the staggered Warriors recovered and reverted back to form, seized control of the overtime period and escaped with a 124-114 win. Nobody from nearby Alcatraz ever swam to safety like the Warriors did Thursday. \u201cThere was just some plays that were taken away from us,\u201d LeBron said. \u201cSimple as that.\u201d Here\u2019s the good news for LeBron: It took some funky stuff to deny him, and none of it is liable to happen again in this series. Of course, there\u2019s the flip side as well: Did the Cavs blew one of the few chances they\u2019ll get? And does he need to score fiddy every game to give himself and Cleveland a chance. Is that even possible, with all due respect to his greatness? LeBron was angry, annoyed, stunned and confused, an emotional gumbo that plainly showed on his face and in his voice post-game. \u201cWe had opportunities,\u201d he said through gritted teeth. All night, LeBron blew through the Warriors no matter whom they threw his way and jumped them from the start. The Warriors needed a 40-foot heave from Curry at the buzzer just to keep from trailing at halftime. The anticipated Golden State response and big lead never materialized \u2014 even in the third quarter which has been their playoff wakeup call \u2014 because LeBron refused to let an opportunity slip away. Nothing bothered him, not even a first-half fist to the face (courtesy of Draymond Green) which sent LeBron to the floor and damaged his left eye, which remained visibly red the rest of the night. Imagine: LeBron missed only two shots in that half, and finished 19 of 32, while staring through a fog. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty much blurry and it got worse as the game went on,\u201d he said. Still, the buckets kept coming\u2026 a pair of sprint-to-the-rim dunks\u2026 a pull-up three-pointer from 35 feet \u2026 assorted post-ups and then, with 50 seconds left, a blast by Steph Curry on an isolation play that resulted in a three-point play after getting hacked at the rim by Kevon Looney. Cavs up two. Then, insanity happened . Kevin Durant wasn\u2019t sharp from the outside all game; he eventually missed seven of his eight three-pointers and seemed rattled, as he has through a portion of these playoffs. Plus, the 2017 Finals MVP was clearly being outplayed by LeBron. So Durant, closely checked by Jeff Green, tried to attack the rim. LeBron gave help and slid into the lane, just outside the restricted circle. He stuck out his left hip and it struck Durant, causing both to fall. Lead official Ken Mauer blew his whistle and then paused briefly while striking a charging pose, as if he wasn\u2019t sure. The three referees consulted the video and determined that while LeBron was beyond the restricted area, he wasn\u2019t in legal guarding position. A charge became a blocking foul and went from Cavs\u2019 ball to a pair of game-tying free throws by Durant. Lebron: \u201cI thought I read that play as well as I\u2019ve read any play in my career. It\u2019s a huge play. A huge play.\u201d Durant: \u201cI knew I had my man beat and he came over late. So when they called the charge, I was surprised. But I\u2019m glad they reviewed it.\u201d A LeBron layup and Curry three-point play later, the Warriors were up a point and Hill was at the line. A make, a miss and a JR rebound and fateful dribble-out. LeBron frantically pointed to the basket and tried to get Smith to reverse field and shoot, then after the buzzer was clearly mystified and demanded to know: what the heck were you thinking? Perhaps the best explanation is this was JR being JR. His career is peppered with head-scratching moments and events and behavior patterns that can only be described as\u2026 loopy. The Warriors laughed at JR\u2019s expense, after the fact of course. Green in particular took delight in Smith\u2019s pain. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the game, being locked in,\u201d the Warriors forward said. \u201cI mean, you got to know the score. That\u2019s just basketball. You\u2019ve got to know if you\u2019re winning or losing or tied.\u201d Smith only added to the confusion by saying afterward, \u201cI tried to bring it out and get enough space to get a shot off. I looked at LeBron and he looked like he was trying to get a timeout. So I stopped, and the game was over\u2026 I knew it was tied. If I thought we were ahead I would\u2019ve just held onto the ball and let them foul me.\u201d Smith claimed he was spooked by Durant standing in the lane, and yes, there was no guarantee Smith would\u2019ve made a basket even if he immediately shot or found Lebron, who was 25 feet from the basket, in time for a 3-pointer. Durant: \u201cIf he had tried a layup, I was right there. I had a good chance to contest it.\u201d But why would Smith dribble out knowing time would expire quickly? Either he forgot the score, or he forgot the time remaining, or he poorly misjudged the time. \u201cHe thought the game was over,\u201d Cavs coach Ty Lue said. \u201cHe thought we were were up one.\u201d OK, then. JR mystery solved. Or maybe not.  Anyway\u2026 The reversed call and missed free throw weren\u2019t as dramatic as Smith\u2019s memory lapse, which will be the water-cooler talk today and live forever on video. But the first two were costlier because Smith didn\u2019t have a clean look once he grabbed the rebound, and a miss was possible. If the call remained a charge or Hill made the free throw, the Cavs likely win the game. The Warriors had their moments. They missed only one shot in OT and locked up the Cavs. Curry scored 29. Klay Thompson had a scary first-quarter collision with Smith, who slipped under him, causing Thompson\u2019s leg to buckle, but Thompson returned and finished with 24 points. Oh, and there was a JaVale McGee sighting. He scored a pair of quick baskets and triggered a third-quarter run before missing an uncontested dunk. Which means, McGee can do certain feats that make you go, wow! And then he can do others that make you go \u2026 wow. Who knew that McGee\u2019s missed dunked would ultimately be one-upped by a bigger and crazier play by Smith and a missed free throw by Hill and a reversed call? In the end, although they owned the score, the Warriors know the deal. \u201cSometimes you need a little luck,\u201d Green said . \u201cIt\u2019s good to be lucky sometimes. We\u2019ll take it.\u201d Curry: \u201cIt was a crazy game. The Finals, man, anything is liable to happen. All that matters is you win the game and turn the page to Game 2.\u201d That\u2019ll be harder for LeBron to do. His masterpiece had mustard squirted on it. A brilliant display of basketball and a near-single-handed takedown of the defending champs and their four All-Stars was in the process of being completed. Then, ruined. LeBron was in a forgiving mood regarding his teammates. \u201cI don\u2019t give up on any of my players,\u201d LeBron said. \u201cI would never give up on JR. That\u2019s not my MO. We\u2019ve got to move on.\u201d The game\u2019s most dominant player served notice in Game 1 with a career high for the Finals and fifth-highest scoring game ever in the championship series. He just put the Warriors on alert. After watching his sprint through the Eastern Conference playoffs from afar, they know whom they\u2019re dealing with, and it is real. \u201cWe held back a lot of strategy tonight,\u201d joked Kerr. \u201cWe\u2019ve got so many things up our sleeves. We\u2019re going to shut (him) down next game.\u201d Well, for a series that began so unconventionally and took a wickedly wacky turn, there\u2019s one thing that should remain constant, and that\u2019s LeBron James. Especially on two days\u2019 rest before Game 2 on Sunday. \u201cI always live in the present,\u201d LeBron said. \u201cI mean, we take this one. We know how difficult and challenging this task is \u2026 you wake up tomorrow with a fresh mind.\u201d Fresh mind, perhaps \u2026 but wounded soul, for sure. * * * Veteran NBA writer Shaun Powell has worked for newspapers and other publications for more than 25 years.

(AP) \u2014 LeBron James defied belief with another brilliant playoff performance and was in utter disbelief at the officials and a play by teammate J.R. Smith down the stretch that sent the Cleveland Cavaliers to a 124-114 overtime loss to Golden State in Game 1 of the NBA Finals on Thursday night. James posted the first 50-point game in the finals since Michael Jordan did it 25 years ago and had the Cavaliers in position to stun the heavily favored Warriors in the opener before a disputed replay overturn and Smith\u2019s blunder turned the tide in Golden State\u2019s favor. \u201dTonight we played as well as we\u2019ve played all postseason, and we gave ourselves a chance possession after possession after possession,\u201d James said. \u201dThere were just some plays that were kind of taken away from us. Simple as that.\u201d James finished with 51 points in the highest scoring finals game in a losing effort and had the Cavaliers in position to win when his pass down low to George Hill drew a foul on Klay Thompson with 4.6 seconds left and Cleveland trailing 107-106. Hill hit the first shot to tie the game but missed the second. Smith secured the rebound but dribbled to half court, a play usually made with the lead. James was calling for the ball that entire time and could only hold his arms out in shock before walking back to the huddle for overtime. While coach Tyronn Lue said Smith thought the Cavs were up by a point, Smith insisted he knew the score. \u201dI knew it was tied,\u201d he said. \u201dI thought we were going to take a timeout because I got the rebound. I\u2019m pretty sure everybody didn\u2019t think I was going to shoot it over KD right there. \u2026 I tried to bring it out and get enough space to maybe get a shot off. I looked over at LeBron and he looked like he was trying to get a timeout. So I stopped, and the game was over.\u201d James said he didn\u2019t know what Smith was thinking and walked out of the postgame news conference after growing tired of repeated questioning about whether Smith knew the score. \u201dI don\u2019t know what J.R. was thinking,\u201d James said, refusing to speculate on Smith\u2019s thought process. \u201dI don\u2019t know the question you\u2019re trying to ask.\u201d The Cavaliers were not able to recover from Smith\u2019s blunder. The Warriors scored on their first possession of overtime when Durant drew a foul from Hill that upset James once again and never looked back, outscoring Cleveland 17-7 in the extra session. The game ended with James jawing with Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson and then teammate Tristan Thompson getting ejected for a flagrant foul after he got upset when Shaun Livingston attempted a shot when the game was already in hand instead of taking a shot-clock violation. There were several calls down the stretch that angered James, with the biggest coming after James drove past Stephen Curry for a three-point play that put Cleveland up 104-102 with 50 seconds left. James appeared to draw a charge on Durant. But officials went to the replay to see if James was in the restricted area which would make it a block. While James was clearly outside the restricted area, officials also had the chance to review whether James was in legal guarding position and changed the call to a block. \u201dI thought I read that play just as well as I read any play in my career, defensively,\u201d James said. \u201dI saw the drive, I was outside the charge line, I stepped in, took the contact. It\u2019s a huge play. It\u2019s a huge play.\u201d James answered with an impressive drive, changing hands in midair before scoring to give the Cavs the lead. But it wasn\u2019t enough when Curry answered with a three-point play followed by Smith\u2019s miscue. The opener of the fourth straight finals between these teams followed a familiar script with the deeper Warriors overcoming a sensational individually effort by James the way they did in winning the past two titles. James had his highest-scoring playoff game ever, tied Jerry West for the most 40-point games in a single postseason with eight and almost single-handedly led the Cavs to the win. He made 19 of 32 shots, added eight rebounds and eight assists and played nearly 48 minutes for a third straight game. But the lasting image of this game will be of James calling for the ball behind the 3-point line as Smith dribbled out the clock in a play reminiscent of one made by Dallas\u2019 Derek Harper in a playoff loss to the Lakers 34 years ago. \u201dIt was epic,\u201d Lue said \u201dHe did enough to carry this team to a victory. We just came up short. But this is LeBron James, that\u2019s who he is. That\u2019s why he\u2019s the best player in the world. He\u2019s been doing it for us all season. \u201dTo do what he did tonight and come out robbed, it\u2019s just not right.\u201d"},{"id":40238,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/cleveland-cavaliers-lament-reversal-critical-late-charge","date":"2018-06-01","title":"Cleveland Cavaliers lament reversal of critical late charge","content":"OAKLAND \u2013 Sometimes toothpaste does go back into the tube. Veteran NBA game officials past and present will tell you that few plays on the court are more difficult to adjudicate than block\/charge call. The challenge of getting that play right \u2013 after first getting it wrong, apparently \u2013 was pivotal in the outcome of Golden State\u2019s 124-114 overtime victory over Cleveland in Game 1 of the 2018 Finals Thursday at Oracle Arena. In the final minute of the fourth quarter, his team trailing 104-102, Warriors forward Kevin Durant drove toward the basket with Cleveland\u2019s Jeff Green at his side. Coming in from Durant\u2019s left, LeBron James moved into his path and took the hit, falling on his back to the floor. The initial call appeared to be a charge on Durant. But in the chaos of the moment, there also seemed to be conflicting views by two of the three referees. Next thing you knew, the refs were headed to the scorer\u2019s table for a replay review. [Insert intense impatience on both sides here. Tick. Tock.] When crew chief Ken Mauer emerged from the replay huddle, in consultation with the NBA\u2019s Replay Center in Secaucus, N.J., the ruling was \u2026 Blocking foul on James. Two free throws for Durant. The frustration and disagreement was apparent on the faces of James and Cavs coach Tyronn Lue as ref Tony Brothers relayed the decision on the sideline. Durant hit both foul shots. What could have been the lead and possession of the ball for the Cavaliers instead became a tie game at 104-104, 36.4 seconds left. From there, amid further twists and turns , the game went to overtime at 107-107. And Golden State controlled those five minutes, with a 17-7 scoring edge in those five minutes that blurred what happened in the first 48. It hit hard on the Cavaliers, who felt mistreated by the review and the verdict. \u201cFor our team to come out and play their hearts out and compete the way we did, man, I mean, it\u2019s bad,\u201d Lue said. \u201cIts never been done before where you know he\u2019s outside the restricted area and then you go there and overturn the call and say it\u2019s a block. It\u2019s never been done, ever, in the history of the game.\u201d Only since the 2012-13 season, according to the NBA Official web site, have refs been permitted to review such block\/charge situations. The \u201ctrigger,\u201d to use the league\u2019s replay terminology, is uncertainty over the defensive player\u2019s position either in or outside the restricted area (that semi-circle under the rim). That\u2019s the explanation offered by Mauer late Thursday. \u201cThe reason for the trigger is that we had doubt as to whether or not James was in the restricted area,\u201d Mauer told a pool reporter. \u201cWhen over at the table, we then are allowed to determine whether or not he was in a legal guarding position. It was determined he was out of the restricted area, but he was not in a legal guarding position prior to Durant\u2019s separate shooting motion. So we had to change it to a blocking foul.\u201d Letter of the law? Guess so. But given the reluctance historically of NBA refs to un-call a foul or otherwise reverse a judgment call, the switch stood out to many as extremely rare. James did seem to turn his shoulder to Durant as he slid over, so \u201clegal guarding position\u201d might have been hard to prove. But the Cavaliers \u2013 who saw on replays that their star and leader clearly was outside the semi-circle \u2013 immediately doubted how much doubt the refs actually had. \u201cLeBron was clearly four feet outside the restricted area,\u201d Lue said. \u201cSo it doesn\u2019t make sense to go review [it].\u201d Said James, who posted an historic Finals stats line of 51 points, eight rebounds and eight assists while making 19 of 32 shots, said: \u201cI thought I read that play as well as I read any play in my career, defensively.\u201d For the Warriors, the reversal was like a reprieve from the governor. They still had time, but life would have been much more difficult had Durant been called for a charge. \u201cIt looked like a block to me,\u201d Golden State guard Klay Thompson said. There still were misadventures to come. Cleveland\u2019s George Hill got to the line at 107-106 and 4.7 seconds left. An 80 percent foul shooter, Hill made his first free throw. Then missed his second. But wait, there\u2019s more: Cavs gunner J.R. Smith slipped in to grab the miss. Only, instead of going right back up for a shot, Smith dribbled to the right wing. Even as James implored Smith to pass him the ball or head toward the basket, the veteran shooting guard shoveled the ball to Hill in the right corner. Hill\u2019s awkward fling looked late and wasn\u2019t close as time expired. The way it looked, Smith seemed to think his team had the lead. Not true, he said. \u201cI tried to bring it out and get enough space to maybe get a shot off,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I thought we were ahead, I would have just held onto the ball and let them foul me.\u201d Said Lue: \u201cHe thought it was over. He thought we were up one.\u201d Oh, and as something to enflame emotions and liven up media coverage before Game 2 Sunday, there was a kerfuffle in the final seconds involving Tristan Thompson, Shaun Livingston, Draymond Green, violations of various \u201ccodes\u201d and unwritten rules and some likely verdicts issued from NBA headquarters in the next 72 hours. But for Cleveland, as frustrated as the Cavs might have been with Smith, as bummed as they were over Hill\u2019s missed free throw and as badly as it stung to squander James\u2019 masterful performance, the block\/charge overturn was the one that stuck. That\u2019s the one that\u2019ll leave a mark. \u201cMan, it ain\u2019t right,\u201d Lue said. \u201cIt ain\u2019t right.\u201d * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Star power, 3-point marksmanship, continuity at least at some minimal level, crafty and dedicated coaching staff, and a know-how that has grown with each subsequent championship showdown. There\u2019s one other thing, though, that should not be overlooked. The Golden State Warriors and the Cleveland Cavaliers rank Nos. 1 and 2 in team payroll, each spending a few exotic motor cars north of $137 million on the players competing in the 2018 Finals. Warriors guard Steph Curry ($34.7 million) and Cleveland forward LeBron James ($33.3 million) are the league\u2019s two highest paid stars this season, and they have a combined total of seven teammates each being paid more than $15 million in 2017-18. It\u2019s no coincidence, then, that in terms of on-court success, the Golden State and Cleveland owners are getting what they paid for. Or, perhaps inversely, paying for what they get. This bang-for-the-big-bucks aspect came up Thursday in NBA commissioner Adam Silver\u2019s annual pre-Finals news conference. Silver was talking about the oddity of the same two teams meeting in the championship round for the fourth consecutive time \u2013 unprecedented across the four major U.S. pro team sports. The fact is, beyond talent and strategies, being able and willing to spend top dollar undeniably is a major factor. That goes right to the heart of the league\u2019s economic model. What gives? The salary cap gives, that\u2019s what. Unlike the \u201chard\u201d cap system used by the NFL, the NBA has a \u201csoft\u201d cap that makes it painful and pricey, but not impossible, for a team owner to exorbitantly overpay for success. The official cap figure this season was $99 million, with a $119.2 million luxury-tax threshold. Both the Warriors and the Cavaliers payouts dwarf those numbers. The difference between hard and soft is one reason the NFL is known for its parity while the NBA is dealing these days with two dominant franchises and 28 wannabes.  \u201cYou still have two teams that are significantly above, not just the cap, but the tax,\u201d Silver said. \u201cNow [the hard cap is] something that we\u2019ll continue to look at. There are pros and cons to doing it. Historically, one of the issues in our league was we didn\u2019t necessarily want to break up teams. There is a different sense in the NBA than the NFL, and the chemistry and dynamic that comes together with a group of players.\u201d Any changes in the cap system would need to be collectively bargained, of course, with the National Basketball Players Association. \u201cYou could do more to achieve parity, but you also don\u2019t want parity of mediocrity either,\u201d Silver said. The NBA wants its Larry O\u2019Brien Trophy to still celebrate excellence, not participation. And excellence isn\u2019t only a function of finance. \u201cNot to take anything away from strong coaching and general managing and ownership,\u201d Silver said, \u201cbut you have certain players in our league that are so transcendent that their team is always probably going to be in the hunt.\u201d Take this for data, from the commissioner via a story on TheRinger.com. \u201cI looked this up: LeBron, now over the course of the last eight Finals, has played with 59 different players,\u201d Silver said. \u201cIt means that presumably the team LeBron is on is going to be a dominant team.\u201d So to get back to the original question: Is it a good thing for the NBA to have the same two teams in the Finals four years in a row? \u201cThe greater the competition you can create, the greater their interests will be,\u201d Silver said at one point. \u201cAt the same time, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s inconsistent to celebrate greatness and to say, my God, look what these two teams are doing.\u201d As usual, Silver fielded questions on a variety of topics, including: \u2014 Regarding the furor in Philadelphia in which chief basketball exec Bryan Colangelo is accused of using multiple cloaked Twitter accounts to anonymously take on critics, defend his reputation and even question players\u2019 performances and off-court activities, Silver deferred to an independent investigation undertaken by the Sixers. \u201cHere we are, Game 1 of The Finals, it\u2019s not necessarily something we want to be talking about,\u201d the commissioner said, \u201cbut it\u2019s the reality of this league. So I have no information beyond that other than that investigation is underway.\u201d \u2014 As the league embraces the looming prospect of legalized sports betting, one issue is the NBA\u2019s expectation of a royalty or \u201cintegrity fee\u2019\u2019 \u2013 1 percent of all bets made is an estimate floated by some \u2013 to compensate the league for its intellectual property and\/or the costs of keeping competition on the up-and-up. Some gaming enterprises already have balked at the idea. \u201cTheir view is we\u2019re not entitled to that integrity fee,\u201d Silver said. \u201cAnd my response to those gaming organizations is, \u2018If that\u2019s your view, then we will negotiate with you directly.\u2019 Because I think many of them desire to get official data feeds from the league. They desire to use our trademarks for placing bets.\u201d \u2014 One-and-done might not be around much longer. That eligibility rule for players to enter the Draft could give way to the league\u2019s development league (G League), nearly a 30-to-30 affiliate system now, and its use of two-way contracts to move players up and down as needed. A wrinkle in the debate pertains to a study chaired by former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice that asserted one-and-done prospects might be more trouble \u2013 in the form of recruiting and eligibility infractions \u2013 than they\u2019re worth. Said Silver: \u201cTheir view that players at 18 who are of NBA caliber \u2026 should not be in college and they should be playing either directly in the NBA or in our development league. And I will say that if you have, in essence, college saying, \u2018We don\u2019t want these players, it would be hard for us not to respond.\u201d \u2014 A recurring cry to reduce the NBA\u2019s regular season from 82 games, allegedly to cut down on injuries, got no traction with the commissioner. He noted that some of this season\u2019s most debilitating injuries \u2013 such as season-enders suffered by San Antonio\u2019s Kawhi Leonard and New York\u2019s Kristaps Porzingis \u2013 came after those players had appeared in very few games. \u201cIf we had any data, hard data suggesting that a season that was 75 games or 72 games instead of 82 games would reduce injuries other than just playing fewer games,\u201d Silver said, \u201cwe\u2019d be taking a hard look at shortening our season. We just don\u2019t have that data right now.\u201d * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

The Warriors\u2019 attack was more balanced, with Stephen Curry (29 points), Kevin Durant (26) and Klay Thompson (24) leading the way.

The stat  6 \u2014 Consecutive possessions the Warriors scored on to start overtime. The context  After building a six-point lead with less than five minutes to go in regulation, the Warriors got stagnant, going to Durant and Curry isolations and scoring on just one of their next five possessions to allow the Cavs to take a two-point lead. But a reversal of a block\/charge call, a Curry drive, and J.R. Smith\u2019s mental error in the closing seconds allowed the Warriors to get to overtime, where they found themselves \u2014 and found Thompson. On their first possession of OT, Durant backed George Hill down late in the clock and drew a foul. Then, off a Cleveland miss, Draymond Green found Thompson circling to the right corner for a three, his first field goal attempt since the 10:07 mark of the fourth quarter. One possession later, Curry ran pick-and-roll, got into the paint to draw an extra defender, and tossed the ball over his head to Shaun Livingston to put the Warriors up seven. Then, when the Cavs got mixed up on an off-ball switch, Green found Livingston cutting to the basket for a dunk. Green saved the Warriors with a buzzer-beating three on the next possession, and then Green slipped to the basket, caught a Curry pass, and found Thompson in the left corner for another three that put the champs up 11 with just a minute to go. Going into The Finals, the Warriors ranked second (behind Philadelphia) in both ball movement (361 passes per 24 minutes of possession) and player movement (10.9 miles traveled per 24 minutes of possession) in the playoffs, according to Second Spectrum tracking . After struggling through some stagnant offense late in the fourth, bodies moved and the ball moved in overtime, where the Warriors assisted on all five of their buckets. They finished with 31 assists and just seven turnovers on the night. Thompson finished 5 of 10 from 3-point range.

Brown, who has served as the team\u2019s head coach since 2013, will be under contract with the 76ers through the 2021-22 season. \u201cBrett has done a terrific job over the past several years building and cultivating a program, but the substantially positive growth in the win column these past two seasons has proven he is the right man to continue leading this team in our quest for an NBA championship,\u201d Colangelo said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be more thrilled for Brett, his family and the organization to be moving forward for several years to come.\u201d Under Brown\u2019s leadership, Philadelphia has increased its win total by 42 games since the start of the 2015-16 season, a run that tied Boston (2006-08) for the largest turnaround within a three-year span in NBA history. \u201cBrett has done a remarkable job in helping build a family-like culture centered around player development, work ethic and a commitment to long-term winning. We made incredible strides this past season with 52 wins and a playoff run,\u201d said Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment and Philadelphia 76ers Managing Partner Josh Harris. \u201cWith a dynamic young core and opportunities to further strengthen our team, the 76ers are well-positioned for the future and we\u2019re thrilled to reach this agreement with Brett to continue as our head coach.\u201d \u201cBrett\u2019s commitment to player development and culture-building is exceptional. With this contract extension, we look forward to the 76ers\u2019 continued growth under his leadership. He has helped develop some of the NBA\u2019s brightest young stars, and we\u2019re excited for what awaits as we continue to add to this talented roster,\u201d said Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment and Philadelphia 76ers Managing Partner David Blitzer. The 76ers finished the 2017-18 season with a record of 52-30, good for third place in the Eastern Conference. The third-place finish was their best since finishing first in 2000-01 and marked the team\u2019s first postseason appearance since 2012. Brown led the team to a 4-1 series win over the sixth-seeded Miami Heat in the first round of the 2018 NBA Playoffs. The series victory marked the first time Philadelphia won a best-of-seven playoff series in five-or-fewer games since sweeping Milwaukee in 1985. The 76ers also set a new franchise playoff record, converting on 18 three-pointers in Games 1 and 3 against Miami; the previous team best was 11, which had been accomplished twice. Brown, the Eastern Conference Coach of the Month for March\/April, guided the 76ers to 16 straight wins to end the season, which set an NBA record for the longest winning streak by a team heading in the playoffs. The 16-game winning streak is a single-season team record. \u201cI am especially grateful to my coaching staff and my players,\u201d said Brown. \u201cIt takes a village. I feel a tremendous responsibility to owners Josh Harris and David Blitzer to help grow and lead our program. They have treated my family and me with integrity and care. They are great owners to work for. The city of Philadelphia deserves a parade and this evolution is all that is on my mind. I am excited to partner with Bryan Colangelo and Scott O\u2019Neil to continuously strive for this elusive goal.\u201d A native of Maine, Brown has developed an identity of \u201cpace, space and defend\u201d during his tenure in Philadelphia, which led the 76ers to top-three rankings in both assists and defensive rating this past season. Under Brown\u2019s direction, the team finished ninth in offensive rating, posted the most home wins in a season since 1988-89 (30) and advanced to the Eastern Conference Semifinals. Philadelphia posted an Eastern Conference-best 27.1 assists per game, a mark topped only by the defending NBA champion Golden State Warriors (29.3). It was the 76ers\u2019 best such mark in a single season since posting 27.6 per contest in 1981-82. From March 16-April 1, the 76ers posted at least 30 assists in nine straight games. The nine-game streak was a franchise record and is tied for the third-longest such streak in league history. With an overall defensive rating of 102.0, the 76ers ranked third in the NBA and second in the Eastern Conference. The only teams with lower defensive ratings than Philadelphia, were Boston (101.5) and Utah (101.6), which both qualified for the NBA Playoffs. Anchoring the defense were NBA All-Defensive selections forward Robert Covington (First Team) and center Joel Embiid (Second Team). Covington, Embiid, forward Dario \u0160ari\u0107, guard JJ Redick and guard-forward Ben Simmons made up the team\u2019s most frequently-used starting lineup, which held a record of 32-15 in its 47 games together. This lineup outscored its opponents by a league-leading 269 points on the season. No other five-man lineup outscored its opponents by more than 169 points. Simmons was selected to the All-Rookie First Team last week. Coach Brown has had at least one player selected to the All-Rookie First Team in each of his five seasons at the helm. Under Brown\u2019s tutelage, Embiid blossomed into a first-time All-Star starter in 2018, while Simmons produced a historic rookie season as the team\u2019s primary ball handler, posting 12 triple-doubles, the second-most ever by a rookie. Since the start of the 2013-14 season, when Brown first took over the reins, Philadelphia leads the NBA in steals, with a total of 3,608. Houston is the next closest team with 3,588, while the closest Eastern Conference foe is Atlanta, which has posted 3,481 steals over the past five seasons. Brown, an ambassador to youth coaches in the Philadelphia and Camden communities, hosts an annual coaching clinic, which is a part his Brett Brown Coaches Circle initiative that provides outreach and resources to local basketball coaches. An advocate for autism awareness and inclusion, this past season, Brown hosted the second annual Bounce Out the Stigma Autism Awareness Clinic. He and Bounce Out the Stigma Founder and Director Mike Simmel, led more than 50 children with sensory needs in passing, shooting and dribbling drills. Bounce Out the Stigma is a nonprofit organization that holds basketball camps for youth with unique needs in 20 states designed to empower children. During the regular season, Brown frequently meets with 76ers season ticket members for a pregame \u201cchalk talk.\u201d These informal interactions are held prior to home games and serve as a time for 76ers fans to connect with the team\u2019s head coach."},{"id":40209,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/cleveland-cavaliers-kevin-love-ok-play-game-1-nba-finals","date":"2018-05-31","title":"Cleveland Cavaliers' Kevin Love starts Game 1 of NBA Finals","content":" The Cleveland Cavaliers began Game 1 of The Finals at full strength The team announced today that All-Star forward Kevin Love has completed the NBA\u2019s concussion protocol and was OK to suit up and play against the Golden State Warriors in Game 1.

To play in the NBA\u2019s third game in Africa is truly special to me, and I can\u2019t wait to take the floor in front of our fans in Africa. Toronto Raptors guard\/forward DeMar DeRozan (U.S.): \u201cI am proud to represent Team World in the third NBA Africa Game. Some of my teammates played in the previous two games, and I have heard a lot of great things about South Africa and our fans there. I\u2019m looking forward to visiting the continent for the first time this summer.\u201d About the NBA The NBA is a global sports and media business built around four professional sports leagues: the National Basketball Association, the Women\u2019s National Basketball Association, the NBA G League and the NBA 2K League.

The announcement for this year\u2019s exhibition was made by NBA vice president and managing director for Africa Amadou Gallo Fall in Johannesburg. The NBA has held two Africa games previously, in 2015 and last year. They were both in Johannesburg, South Africa\u2019s biggest city and commercial hub, and pitted a team of American and international NBA stars against a team of NBA players from Africa, or with African heritage. This time, Team World and Team Africa will play at the 8,500-seat Sun Arena in Time Square as the NBA pushes out to a new city, albeit only about 40 miles up the highway from Johannesburg. The NBA confirmed DeRozan, who plays for the Toronto Raptors, will take part along with Dallas Mavericks forward Harrison Barnes and San Antonio Spurs forward Rudy Gay on the Team World roster. Embiid, who plays for the Philadelphia 76ers, will play for Team Africa along with Portland Trail Blazers forward Al-Farouq Aminu and Orlando Magic center Bismack Biyombo. Embiid, who is from Cameroon, was a product of the NBA\u2019s Basketball Without Borders development camp in South Africa in 2011. The NBA has sought to capture a new market in Africa over recent years and Commissioner Adam Silver made the trip to Johannesburg for the inaugural Africa game in 2015. Then, Silver said the NBA was looking to hold a pre-season and ultimately a regular-season game in Africa. The NBA also opened an academy in Senegal last year, the first in Africa. Basketball is generally more popular in West Africa than South Africa, but South Africa\u2019s sports facilities \u2013 the best on the continent \u2013 have drawn the NBA to the country. The two previous Africa games in South Africa drew crowds of about 5,000 in 2015 and just over 7,000 last year."},{"id":40224,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/houston-rockets-mike-dantoni-daryl-morey-plan-keep-core-team-together","date":"2018-05-31","title":"Houston Rockets' front office hoping to keep core players in free agency","content":" The Houston Rockets\u2019 season came to an end on Monday with their Game 7 loss to the Golden State Warriors in the Western Conference finals.

Obviously that paraphrase of the old Mark Twain quote about New England weather swaps minutes for years as it pertains to this Finals IV of Golden State vs. Cleveland for the league\u2019s 2018 championship. But this stuff flies by so fast \u2013 on the calendar, we haven\u2019t hit three years yet since Team LeBron and Team Curry met in the 2015 Finals , with the opener of that one on June 4. * Complete NBA Finals coverage And for those who still might feel bored by the sameness of the matchup, rest assured, says Golden State general manager Bob Myers. Change is coming, inevitably so. \u201cI definitely know this is ending,\u201d Myers said Wednesday, talking with reporters on the floor at Oracle Arena on the eve of Game 1. \u201cI don\u2019t need any reminders. I know a lot of people in the Bay Area think this is going to go on forever. On the record, it won\u2019t. \u201cIt can\u2019t. Nothing does,\u201d Myers continued. \u201cEspecially in a sport where the competition is so great. There\u2019s financial pressures. There\u2019s all kinds of things \u2013 injuries, personalities, everything, that don\u2019t allow you to\u2026 No team should last forever. It\u2019s not good for anybody.\u201d  Fans of the Warriors and the Cavaliers would argue otherwise, but there is a reason what we\u2019re seeing now \u2013 two franchises butting heads for the fourth consecutive time in a championship round \u2013 never has happened in the four major U.S. professional sports. Staying on top, holding teams together, overcoming injuries, coping with age and egos and constant challenges from a field of rivals can wear even on a champion. Notice how both the Warriors and the Cavaliers worked through less-than-fulfilling regular seasons and had to overcome 2-3 deficits in the conference finals to reach this stage this time. \u201cI didn\u2019t need a reminder from Houston to know how fragile this whole thing is,\u201d Myers said. \u201cThat\u2019s part of it. That\u2019s why you\u2019ve got to appreciate it. The notion that these things go on forever? At one point, players get older. Teams get broken up. It always happens. You never know when.\u201d Invariably, that sizes up an executive in Myers\u2019 position for a black hat. He is the one charged with renewal, which often means shedding players with whom fans have fallen in love through the high times. Or maybe Myers ends up as the bad guy because he doesn\u2019t refresh the roster soon enough and a team of former champs gets old together. \u201cMy day\u2019s coming at some point,\u201d said Myers, one of the NBA\u2019s acclaimed \u201cgolden boys\u201d through this Warriors run. \u201cEverybody gets hammered for something they do or not. It\u2019s part of the deal. Who knows? You\u2019d like to treat the players with respect \u2013 they\u2019ve earned it. Our fans are very important. You just do the best you can. \u201cI had no idea we were going to win any championships. \u2026 Every decision, signing players, keeping a team together is difficult. Not keeping a team together is difficult. Making trades, not making trades. It\u2019s all part of it.\u201d So give it time. Change will come. Now, for how that relates to this Finals and its opponents, so familiar with each other and to the world, the real question ought to be: What was the alternative? Should Cleveland and Golden State have laid down and gotten out of the way of new blood just \u2026 because? \u201cIt may not be as suspenseful as a lot of people want it to be or as drama-filled, but that\u2019s what you\u2019ve got movies and music for,\u201d Golden State\u2019s Kevin Durant said. \u201cI think this is a great display of basketball on the court from both sides, and if you\u2019re a real lover of the game, you can enjoy how both teams play it, even though it may be different. \u201cIt\u2019s still organic and true to the game, pure to the game. So if you enjoy basketball, I don\u2019t feel like you should have any complaints because it\u2019s a great set of players on both teams.\u201d Cleveland star LeBron James was more blunt and business-focused. A Rockets-Celtics Finals might offer new storylines and fresh faces, but there\u2019s always appeal \u2013 and marketability \u2013 to the defending champions taking on the game\u2019s best player, again. And again. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to ask Adam Silver,\u201d James said, referencing the NBA commissioner as the fellow whose opinion matters most on the sameness of this Finals. Then he elaborated. \u201cTeams have had their opportunities to beat the Cavs over the last four years, and teams have had the opportunities to beat the Warriors over the last four years,\u201d James said. \u201cIf you want to see somebody else in the postseason, then you got to beat them.\u201d Warriors guard Klay Thompson echoed that view. \u201cI think the rest of the NBA has got to get better,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not our fault. \u201cThe only people I hear saying that are fans from other teams, which is natural. I don\u2019t blame them. But as long as our fan base is happy, that\u2019s all that matters.\u201d * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Or will LeBron James defy odds and pull this off and make his case for the greatest player of any generation? Those are the only options. It\u2019s one conclusion or another on the line here with the fourth installment of Nobody Else In The NBA Could Stop Them And That\u2019s Why We Get Warriors-Cavs In The Finals. * Complete NBA Finals coverage Yes, already there are whines and groans and slumped shoulders in the basketball world because a portion of the population claims to suffer from Cavs-Warriors fatigue. Which in itself is unusual: This is a battle between a collection of four All-Stars vs. LeBron. Purely from an entertainment standpoint, what matchup would\u2019ve been tastier? The Young-And-Not-Ready Boston Celtics? The Houston Rockets without Chris Paul? The Indiana Pacers, Toronto Raptors, Utah Jazz or New Orleans Pelicans? Those teams simply weren\u2019t up to the task and were doomed by their faults and imperfections, and so this re-re-re-repeat became a reality. Perhaps it was destined from day one of the season because LeBron never reached for a body part \u2014 the 33-year-old hasn\u2019t sat out a single game, regular season or playoffs, 101 straight \u2014 and the Warriors didn\u2019t quite die from total boredom, although it was close for a minute. The public fear with this series lies with a Warriors wipeout. Meaning, if the Cavs with Kyrie Irving were erased in five games by Golden State last summer , how can Cleveland possibly put up a better fight without him this time? The soul of the 2018 NBA Finals, therefore, centers around LeBron and his limits as a basketball player. He can push the bar beyond anyone\u2019s imagination by stringing together four unfathomable performances, or his season stops here, abruptly. He\u2019ll enter The Finals with one advantage: Andre Iguodala will not play Game 1 because of a persistently painful bone bruise. Iguodala normally is the Warriors\u2019 first line of defense on LeBron, someone who did a good enough job in that area to earn Finals MVP three years ago . Iggy is smart and athletic and therefore could make LeBron work harder than normal. But he can\u2019t do that from the bench in a suit and tie. This will be the fifth straight postseason game missed by Iguodala, who says he isn\u2019t beating himself up over it. \u201cThat\u2019s just wasted thoughts and energy,\u201d he said. \u201cThose negative thoughts can weigh on your mood and keep you from healing. I have really good days and really bad days. You can get impatient. It\u2019s just a process to get through. I\u2019m not that far away.\u201d LeBron applauded Iguodala\u2019s quick hands and ball reaction and also revealed this on the eve of The Finals: \u201cWe were one pick away from drafting him when Philly took him. Then we selected Luke Jackson from Oregon .\u201d We\u2019ll save you the trouble of research: Jackson lasted two seasons in Cleveland and is now coaching in NAIA Division II. Iguodala\u2019s still going, albeit with a limp currently. The Warriors will toss other bodies in LeBron\u2019s direction, including Kevin Durant, who must avoid foul trouble in that situation. Iguodala knows what his replacements will deal with. \u201cLeBron\u2019s a very cerebral player,\u201d Iguodala said. \u201cHe does a good job of always being a threat whether he\u2019s on the ball or off the ball and does a good job of making his teammates threats. You can\u2019t take any possessions off.\u201d LeBron\u2019s 2017-18 run isn\u2019t the best of his career, yet perhaps the most challenging. He\u2019s doing it without Irving, who requested a trade last summer. Isaiah Thomas came in return, and left almost as quickly. A midseason trade brought George Hill, Jordan Clarkson and Larry Nance Jr., players who needed to be weaved into the club. And coach Tyronn Lue took a leave of absence for health-related reasons. In addition, LeBron endured Game 7s in the first round and conference finals in the East playoffs. Through it all, he maintained an exceptional high level of play, especially considering this is his 15th season. Scoring, rebounding, bringing the ball upcourt, finding teammates, creating shots for teammates, leading the club in tense moments and dropping game-winners \u2026 nobody at his age has done this in the NBA. LeBron may need to average 40-plus minutes a game in this series, and he\u2019s OK with that. He\u2019s had three days off leading into Game 1, and will play only one game in five days between Games 1 and 3. Doing the math, that\u2019s two games in eight days. That schedule works in his favor. \u201cI\u2019ve been blessed to be available, and that\u2019s what I take pride in more than anything,\u201d James said about his durability. \u201cI\u2019ve never bought into a \u2018ceiling,\u2019 either. I don\u2019t really have a ceiling. I want to try and maximize as much as I can and be as good as I can.\u201d LeBron has a new toy: A fading, elevating half-turnaround mid-range jumper that he used to punish the Pacers, Raptors and Celtics. It has become part of his arsenal and it allows him to create space after backing his man down first. Michael Jordan developed a similar shot late in his career \u2014 a turnaround jumper along the baseline \u2014 and it helped make him dangerous in his early 30s. Of course, there\u2019s the passing which sets LeBron apart from the game\u2019s other great scorers. He\u2019ll need plenty of that if the Warriors throw a double his way, as expected without Iguodala. \u201cEverything starts with LeBron and trying to throw up as much resistance as you can,\u201d said Warriors guard Stephen Curry. \u201cWhen he\u2019s on the floor, he\u2019s the factor that you\u2019ve got to worry about, and try to take the other guys out, too.\u201d LeBron must also guard Durant, something that didn\u2019t work out so well for Cleveland last summer. Durant averaged 35.2 ppg in The Finals and was named series MVP . As a defender, LeBron is better at offering help than man-to-man as his his frequent run-down blocks ( most notably on Iguodala in Game 7 of the 2016 Finals ) can attest. Last year, though, LeBron had to labor on both ends, and it\u2019s a very fair and real question whether he can do that again without Irving around to absorb some of the offensive slack. Kevin Love, coming off concussion protocol, is expected to be cleared . Whenever he suits up, he\u2019ll be a factor, obviously. But in order to give themselves a chance, the Cavs need reasonable production from everyone: Tristan Thompson double-digit rebounds, JR Smith hitting multiple 3s, George Hill absorbing some of the playmaking duties, Clarkson scoring off the bench. Those chip-in performances would keep Cleveland competitive in games. If it\u2019s all or mostly LeBron, good as he is, this could be quick. \u201cThey still play a grind-out, physical game,\u201d Durant said. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a well rounded team with a lot of athletic guys. It\u2019s different, obviously, without Kyrie in the mix but it does present a different challenge for us that we\u2019ve got to be focused on.\u201d But even if the Cavs and LeBron are at their finest, is that enough? Unlike Cleveland, the Warriors return to The Finals fully intact from a year ago. Durant, Curry, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson have all been here multiple times. They\u2019re coming off a Western Conference finals that tested their will, and they survived. There\u2019s also the good chance they won\u2019t see a defense as tricky and switch-happy as the one Houston threw their way. The Rockets had PJ Tucker, Trevor Ariza, Chris Paul (for five games anyway) and rim-protector Clint Capela, all with solid and varying defensive skills. Cleveland offers none of that. Durant was often flummoxed by that defense and zoned out for a few fourth quarters but finished strongly in Game 7. Curry appears fully recovered from a bum knee that made for a late playoff debut , and Thompson can produce hot stretches. The Warriors work best, however, when Green directs the offense and looks for teammates cutting or running off picks. The Warriors got away from that against Houston and lapsed into isolation ball but perhaps learned from their mistake. Also: The Warriors haven\u2019t played solidly in the playoffs for four full quarters; maybe that\u2019s about to happen. Matchups will determine how deep each coach reaches down the bench, but that\u2019s minor. The stars will ultimately decide this one, as always in The Finals. Golden State has more of them, Cleveland owns the biggest. That equation steeply favors the Warriors, who also own home-court advantage, for whatever that\u2019s worth. For someone who struggled against the Celtics without Irving and the Pacers and needed every fiber from LeBron\u2019s middle-aged body to get this far, winning four against the defending champions seems somewhat unrealistic. \u201cI don\u2019t think we need that as motivation,\u201d said Lue. \u201cWhen you get to the NBA Finals, there is no added motivation. You\u2019re trying to win a championship.\u201d So that\u2019s the state of the series before it begins. Warriors-Cavs IV is the NBA Finals matchup you expected to get, even if repetition isn\u2019t everyone\u2019s idea of a compelling stage. \u201cIt may not be as suspenseful as people want it to be or as drama-filled,\u201d said Durant, \u201cbut that\u2019s what you\u2019ve got movies and music for. If you enjoy basketball, I don\u2019t feel like you should have any complaints.\u201d * * * Veteran NBA writer Shaun Powell has worked for newspapers and other publications for more than 25 years.

And mouths, apparently. That\u2019s how it was for Cleveland forward Kevin Love Wednesday. Love did not participate in the 2018 Finals \u201cmedia day\u201d interview availability at Oracle Arena because he remains in the NBA\u2019s concussion protocol. He wasn\u2019t even the topic of much conversation. That\u2019s probably a good thing for the Cavaliers, with so many people in and around the league presuming Love will be cleared and available for Game 1. The alternative wouldn\u2019t be as upbeat, suggesting Love either misses the championship series opener ( 9 p.m. ET, ABC ) or plays but has little impact in his return to Cleveland\u2019s rotation. But from the chatter around Oracle Arena Wednesday, that seemed a distinctly minority view. * Complete NBA Finals coverage Love got hurt early in Game 6 of the Eastern Conference finals when he and Boston\u2019s Jayson Tatum collided and banged heads. Tatum was jarred but stayed in the game and was fine for Game 7. Love, on the other hand, fell to the floor, missed the rest of Game 6 and still hadn\u2019t cleared the league\u2019s concussion protocol standards in time to play in the clincher Sunday. Three days later, the doctors hadn\u2019t signed off on the 29-year-old even playing questions and answer with reporters from around the globe. Which has nothing to do with his actual status to be back in the Cavaliers\u2019 rotation. Of the 20 Cleveland or Golden State players whose interviews were transcribed and posted in full or part on an NBA.com media site, only one, Stephen Curry, made even a passing reference to the 6-foot-10, five-time All-Star. \u201cWe\u2019ll see if Kevin Love is healthy or not,\u201d Curry said. That\u2019s it. Otherwise, it was left to Cleveland coach Tyronn Lue to offer the latest on Love as of Wednesday afternoon. Asked if he hoped Love would play in Game 1, Lue said: \u201cI hope so. I\u2019m still not sure. He\u2019s going to go do some things today and see how he feels. But he is in the protocol still, so we\u2019ll see how he feels.\u201d To exit the concussion protocol, a player must be free of symptoms of the head trauma, must be evaluated by a physician and must play a series of physical exertion and agility drills. Only then, after a consultation of team medical staff with the NBA\u2019s director of the program, the final call gets made by the team physician. Those hurdles matter and, clearly, are beyond any ambition or grittiness on Love\u2019s part. That\u2019s part of this situation too: Love has dealt with and been waylaid by a variety of injuries through the years, with some critics making assumptions about his desire or toughness. Love averaged 13.9 points and 10.0 rebounds in Cleveland\u2019s first three rounds this postseason, while making just 38.8 percent of his shots. A year ago in The Finals, he averaged 16.0 points and 11.2 rebounds and shot 38.7 percent from 3-point range. Considering Kyrie Irving\u2019s absence now \u2014 the point guard chipped in 29.4 points per game in the 2017 Finals \u2014 Love\u2019s role as a secondary scorer to James and a rebounder for Cleveland looms large. Then again, he averaged just 8.5 points and 6.8 rebounds in the 2016 Finals, ranking fifth behind James (29.7), Irving (27.1), J.R. Smith (10.6) and Tristan Thompson (10.3) among Cavs scorers. He even missed Game 3 of that series with a concussion. But Cleveland beat Golden State in seven games for the title, becoming the first Finals team to overcome a 1-3 deficit. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

The burner accounts also took aim at former Sixers general manager Sam Hinkie, Toronto Raptors executive Masai Ujiri and former Sixers players Jahlil Okafor and Nerlens Noel, according to a report by The Ringer website. \u201cThe allegations are serious and we have commenced an independent investigation into the matter,\u201d the Sixers said Wednesday in a statement. \u201cWe will report the results of that investigation as soon as it is concluded.\u201d The website asked the team about five Twitter accounts it suspected Colangelo was operating. He said in a statement that he used one of the accounts to monitor the NBA industry and other current events, but that he was \u201cnot familiar with any of the other accounts\u201d brought to his attention and that he didn\u2019t know who was \u201cbehind them or what their motives may be in using them.\u201d Embiid, the 24-year-old All-Star center, tweeted that he didn\u2019t believe the report. \u201cI don\u2019t believe the story. That would just be insane,\u201d he wrote. Colangelo was hired as president of basketball operations for Philadelphia in April 2016. He served as Toronto\u2019s general manager from 2006-2013. Colangelo, the son of longtime sports executive Jerry Colangelo, stepped in with the Sixers after Hinkie resigned. He lost his GM job in Toronto after the Raptors missed the playoffs for the fifth consecutive season, and Ujiri took over basketball operations. According to The Ringer, one of the Twitter accounts it connected to Colangelo downplayed Hinkie\u2019s role in the franchise\u2019s turnaround. It also lamented in another post that Ujiri hadn\u2019t done anything to make the Raptors better. Another account accused Embiid of \u201cplaying like a toddler having tantrums,\u201d and one criticized Fultz for his work with his \u201cso called mentor\/father figure.\u201d"},{"id":40273,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-what-watch-game-1-cleveland-cavaliers-nba-finals","date":"2018-05-30","title":"Blogtable: What happens in Game 1 that could prove Cleveland Cavaliers have a chance?","content":"* * * If I see _____ during Game 1, I know the Cavs have a chance to win the NBA Finals. * * * Steve Aschburner : Steph Curry or Kevin Durant rolled off on a gurney. Too harsh? I can\u2019t put a lot of stock in a strong Game 1 performance by any particular Cavaliers player \u2014 other than LeBron James \u2014 because their issues have been consistency and reliability, not capability. A big game one night, vanished the next. I suppose this might be a decent litmus test, though: Kevin Love  plays in Game 1 , which means he\u2019s freed from the concussion protocol of the East finals , and  puts up numbers reminiscent of his Minnesota days , something in the 25 points, 15 rebounds range. Remember, Kyrie Irving in last year\u2019s Finals averaged 29.4 points and sank nearly 42 percent of his 3-pointers. The role of James\u2019 wing man is a void into which none of his teammates has stepped. So if I see Love do that in Game 1, then sure, the Cavs would have a pretty good chance against Golden State. Shaun Powell : If I see Kyrie Irving in a Cavs uniform at tipoff and the last 10 months were all a dream and he never demanded a trade to the Celtics \u2014 which I figured was not believable, anyway. OK, in all seriousness: If I see Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant each grabbing a body part  in pain and sitting, then yes, the Cavs have a chance. Otherwise, no. John Schuhmann : Pigs fly? The great thing about sports is that anything can happen and we\u2019ve certainly had some unexpected results in these playoffs already. But in regard to per-game point differential through the regular season and playoffs, the Cavs (plus-1.0) are the worst team to reach The Finals in the last 37 years (since the 1980-81 Rockets reached The Finals with a point differential of plus-0.8). Even if you just consider the playoffs (the Cavs have flipped the switch, right?), they have the worst point differential since the 1993-94 Knicks (plus-1.2). The Warriors aren\u2019t as good as they were last year, but the Cavs are much worse. Sekou Smith : The ghost of a healthy Kyrie Irving from 2016 \u2026 too much? Yes, that\u2019s going a bit far. Tyronn Lue could unload his entire bench, every single player against the Warriors, and I\u2019m still not convinced the Cavaliers will have a chance to win this series. I know what they\u2019ve done to the Eastern Conference field in the playoffs. I recognize the power LeBron wields over the rest of the conference (think Thanos, snapping his finger and making the competition disappear). But his powers don\u2019t work against the Western Conference. He\u2019ll need some  divine intervention to lift the Cavaliers up and over the Warriors this time. And the bearded, clutch-shooting partner in crime that aided him in 2016 no longer works in Cleveland.

Who wins this series and in how many games? * * * Steve Aschburner : This was a no-brainer for me, if only because I didn\u2019t have to think about it here. I went on the record in our Finals preview with my pick and can\u2019t very well change now without seeming more like a politician than a prognosticator. I\u2019m seeing Warriors in five games , in basically a repeat of last June\u2019s outcome. To me, the relative gap between Golden State and Cleveland hasn\u2019t changed, having four All-Stars is better than two, and too many Cavaliers will be dipping their toes into Finals water for the first time. Shaun Powell : The Cavs only took one game from the Warriors last year with Kyrie Irving. Now there\u2019s no Irving, so \u2026 Let\u2019s give LeBron a little more respect this year and say he\u2019s good for a game without Kyrie. Same result, though. Warriors in five . John Schuhmann : Calling Warriors in 5 (again) is too easy and should be forbidden to make these prediction things interesting. So\u2026 Warriors in four . They\u2019re the better team on both ends of the floor, they\u2019ve had the best defense in the playoffs (with multiple guys who can make things as tough as possible on LeBron James), and they\u2019ll have a much easier time offensively against the Cleveland defense than they did against that of the Rockets. I\u2019ve been wrong before and Warriors in 5 is probably the best way to go, but what\u2019s the fun in that? Sekou Smith : Warriors in five . I know, I know, I\u2019m not exactly living on the edge with this pick. But I see no pathway for the Cavaliers to pull off this upset, not even with LeBron playing at his zenith at 33 and 15 years into his career. There is not enough help, healthy or otherwise, on hand to assist LeBron with the heavy lifting against a team like the Warriors. That said, I\u2019m going to enjoy every single dramatic moment of this series. Because I expect the competition to be fierce, when possible. And when you have two teams that know each other as well as these guys do, there has to be a little extra juice in play for both sides. * * *"},{"id":40257,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-lebron-technically-mvp-every-year","date":"2018-05-30","title":"Blogtable: Is LeBron James technically the league's MVP every year?","content":" * * * We likely won\u2019t hear his name announced when they hand out the MVP award next month, but everyone knows LeBron James is the most valuable player in the NBA, right? * * * Steve Aschburner : Wrong. LeBron James is the best player in the NBA. He is a guy who\u2019s thumbing his nose at our expectations for a massive-mileage player in his 15th season. He\u2019s also the one player capable of carrying his team through an entire postseason with minimal help. But he\u2019s not the MVP of 2017-18 in my opinion because A) it\u2019s a regular season award, playoffs not included; B) James\u2019 squad finished with fewer victories than five other teams, and C) James Harden\u2019s continued transformation as a team guy adapting to Chris Paul\u2019s arrival while leading the NBA in scoring made him the top candidate. A lot of this comes down to the fuzzy, ever-morphing definition of \u201cvaluable\u201d \u2014 which I think gives the award and all the debates it inspires a special status. Shaun Powell : From an NBA visibility standpoint both domestically and abroad, from a league bottom-line standpoint from ticket sales, merchandising and ratings, from a franchise valuation standpoint especially with the Cavaliers and from a common-sense standpoint, yes,  LeBron James is the most valuable player in the NBA no matter who wins MVP. John Schuhmann : I\u2019ve consulted twitter (both standard and burner accounts ) and I can reveal that no, not everyone knows that LeBron James is the most valuable player in the NBA (or they know it and just don\u2019t want to admit it). This is the worst team that James has taken to The Finals, because that 2007 team had a top-five defense and this one ranked 29th on that end of the floor (though James is partly responsible for that). There\u2019s nobody else who could do what he\u2019s done \u2014 both in regard to individual performance and team success \u2014 in these playoffs. Maybe things are different if the Celtics make a couple of open 3s in Game 7, but there are probably 10 Eastern Conference teams that James could have taken to The Finals if he was on those rosters. That\u2019s how valuable he is. Sekou Smith: Right. Yes. Absolutely. Whatever confirmation is needed, feel free to use it. LeBron is the most valuable player in the league this and just about every season for the past 10 years. It doesn\u2019t mean he always has the most outstanding season. But show me another player who has led his team to eight straight trips to The Finals and then we can talk about who is the real MVP. James Harden is probably going to sweep the awards, both the Kia official honor and the trophy handed out by the players association tomorrow. And it\u2019s hard to argue against him after the Houston Rockets\u2019 65-win regular season and the way Harden performed. But let\u2019s be real about this: LeBron\u2019s the single greatest force in the league right now and until further notice. He doesn\u2019t need a trophy to prove it either.

Clifford becomes the 14th head coach in franchise history. Clifford returns to Orlando after spending the previous five seasons (2013-18) as head coach of the Charlotte Hornets. He was named Charlotte\u2019s head coach on May 29, 2013 and compiled a record of 196-214 (.478). Clifford led Charlotte to the NBA Playoffs in two of his first four seasons at the helm after the team qualified for the postseason just once in the previous 10 seasons. \u201c We are very excited to welcome Steve (Clifford) back into the Magic family,\u201d Weltman said. \u201cSteve is widely regarded throughout the NBA community as an elite coach and developer of players at all stages. His teams have always been disciplined and prepared, and have embraced the concept of playing for each other .\u201d During Clifford\u2019s first season in Charlotte (2013-14), the team saw a 22-win improvement from the previous season, finishing 43-39 and earning a playoff berth for the first time since 2009-10. In 2015-16, the Hornets went 48-34, their best record since 1999-2000. Charlotte again made the NBA Playoffs, eventually falling in seven games to third-seeded Miami. A native of Island Falls, Maine, Clifford arrived in Charlotte after spending the 2012-13 season as an assistant coach with the Los Angeles Lakers, first under Mike Brown and then under Mike D\u2019Antoni. Prior to the Lakers, Clifford spent five seasons as an assistant coach with Orlando from 2007-12. As a member of Stan Van Gundy\u2019s staff, he helped the Magic to a 259-135 record (.657) and five straight playoff appearances, including a trip to the 2009 NBA Finals. The team won 50 games or more in four straight seasons from 2007-11, winning three consecutive Southeast Division titles (2007-08, 2008-09 and 2009-10). Before going to Orlando, Clifford spent four seasons as an assistant coach under Jeff Van Gundy with the Houston Rockets from 2003-07. He began his NBA career with the New York Knicks, serving as the team\u2019s advance scout in 2000-01 before moving to the bench as an assistant coach from 2001-03. Prior to the NBA, Clifford spent 15 years coaching at the collegiate level, including four years as head coach at Adelphi University in Garden City, New York from 1995-99. He posted a record of 86-36 (.705) at Adelphi, leading the school to four straight 20-win seasons, becoming the first coach in school history to record consecutive 20-win campaigns, and four straight appearances in the NCAA Division II Tournament. His winning percentage remains the second-best of the 12 head coaches in the program\u2019s 65-year history. Clifford began his college coaching career at Saint Anselm College in New Hampshire, where he spent four seasons as an assistant coach. He then served as an assistant coach for one year at Fairfield University, four seasons at Boston University and one season at Siena University before becoming the head coach at Adelphi. Clifford also spent one season as an assistant coach at East Carolina University in 1999-2000 before moving to the NBA. Clifford\u2019s first coaching experience came at Woodland High School in Maine, where he coached for two seasons after graduating from the University of Maine at Farmington with a degree in special education. He played four years for the Beavers, being named Best Defensive Player in his final two seasons while serving as team captain."},{"id":40265,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/liangelo-ball-lonzo-ball-lakers","date":"2018-05-30","title":"LiAngelo Ball works out for Los Angeles Lakers with Lonzo looking on","content":" LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Just about everything the Ball family does gets attention, and LiAngelo Ball\u2019s pre-draft workout with the Lakers on Tuesday was no exception. About two dozen members of the media watched Ball\u2019s final drills while Magic Johnson and Lakers coach Luke Walton looked on. Lakers guard Lonzo Ball, LiAngelo\u2019s older brother, was there for the workout as well. \u201cI feel like it went good,\u201d the younger Ball said. \u201cIt\u2019s always fun being in here doing things I want to get better at. It was a good workout.\u201d LaVar Ball has been outspoken about his desire for all three of his sons \u2013 Lonzo, LiAngelo and LaMelo, the youngest \u2013 to play for the Lakers. The Lakers have the 25th pick in the first round next month, though LiAngelo Ball\u2019s draft prospects are uncertain. He wasn\u2019t even scheduled to be a starter at UCLA before leaving the program after being indefinitely suspended for an international incident last year in China. He also had a stint with the professional Lithuanian team Vytautas. \u201cIt was good that (Lonzo) was here, but if he wasn\u2019t here I would\u2019ve been doing the same thing,\u201d LiAngelo Ball said. \u201cI don\u2019t really pay attention to who\u2019s here and who\u2019s not. I just do what I do.\u201d \u201cI showed I can knock down shots and get some wins within the 2-on-2 and 3-on-3s,\u201d LiAngelo said. \u201cI showed I can play together.\u201d LiAngelo Ball confirmed that he has an upcoming workout with the Golden State Warriors. He also said he\u2019ll play in the NBA summer league, but he is not sure which team he\u2019ll play for yet. As far as what he believes his NBA draft prospects are, Ball said: \u201cI\u2019m not sure what\u2019s going on with the draft. I\u2019m just playing my hardest and whatever team thinks I can produce for them, that\u2019s who I\u2019ll play for.\u201d Ball and two teammates became an international story when they were arrested for shoplifting during UCLA\u2019s exhibition basketball trip to China last year. They were all suspended indefinitely, and LaVar Ball pulled his son out of school while he was serving that suspension. Asked what he\u2019ll tell NBA teams about why he left UCLA, Ball said: \u201cI don\u2019t really remember too much about that. That\u2019s a closed chapter in my life. I just moved on. Went overseas. Just learned from over there. Came back.\u201d LaVar had already pulled LaMelo out of high school to homeschool him and the two went to play professionally in Lithuania. The move was heavily scrutinized. \u201cI think it prepared me a little better as far as going against grown men that care about their job every day,\u201d LiAngelo Ball said. \u201cIf you\u2019re not producing out there, they\u2019ll fire you real quick.\u201d During the workout, Ball was reunited with former UCLA teammate Thomas Welsh, a 7-foot center who played for the Bruins for four years. They practiced together at UCLA but didn\u2019t play together there. \u201cI think he\u2019s the same guy,\u201d Welsh said. \u201cHe\u2019s a hard-working kid. We had a chance to play with him on 3-on-3 and 2-on-2 live action stuff. He\u2019s a lot of fun to play with. He works his tail off. It was really good to be back on the court with him again today.\u201d Among others at the Lakers workout Tuesday were guard Jaylen Adams (St. Bonaventure), guard Devon Hall (Virginia), guard Tyus Battle (Syracuse) and Dusan Ristic (Arizona)."},{"id":40261,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-brett-brown-philadelphia-76ers-reach-agreement-extension","date":"2018-05-30","title":"Report: Philadelphia 76ers, Brett Brown reach agreement on three-year extension","content":" PHILADELPHIA (AP) \u2014 The Philadelphia 76ers will continue to put their trust in coach Brett Brown.

The matchup of Eastern and Western winners that we\u2019ve gotten, the one so many experts and \u201cinsiders\u201d envisioned back in October, finally is here. It\u2019s like a new season of \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d or \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d or some other recurring, limited TV series. With a lower attrition rate of recognizable characters, at least. Some NBA aficionados might have preferred a championship round featuring the Houston Rockets, the Boston Celtics or both, just to freshen things up and introduce some new blood to this ultimate playoff round. The media folks who\u2019ll be covering it surely would have welcomed new storylines behind fresh faces. But there is an equally compelling argument to be made on behalf of Cavaliers-Warriors IV. Sports thrive on rivalries, and with four consecutive Finals clashes, this Cleveland-Golden State re-re-rematch arguably rates second only to the storied Celtics-Lakers struggle over the past 60 years. Until these two franchises locked horns for the first time in 2015 , NBA opponents had only butted heads in consecutive Finals 12 times. Never had the same teams made it to three in a row. So history already has been made, with more likely to come. This might be, as some have suggested, the stiffest test yet for LeBron James in his nine Finals appearances. He leads a team with a predictably unreliable, or reliably unpredictable, supporting cast and is down one star sidekick, Kyrie Irving, from the Cavs squad that got dispatched in five games by Golden State a year ago. Yet at age 33, in his 15th season, James has appeared in all 100 Cleveland games so far and arguably produced \u2014 \u201cenjoyed\u201d is too loaded a word given the Cavs\u2019 many ups and downs \u2014 his best performance ever. For Golden State, a season marked by boredom and a desire to manage injuries snapped into focus courtesy of a 2-3 deficit in the West finals . The Warriors\u2019 famous offense hasn\u2019t looked as well-oiled as in the past three years, though defensively they have dialed up the efforts and results as needed. The casts are as beloved or, er, be-hated as stars of an aging drama or comedy series: James, Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, Kevin Love (expected back from his concussion protocol of the East finals ) and coaches Steve Kerr and Tyronn Lue. That sameness probably will keep this Finals strong with viewers nationally and globally, as everyone waits to see if Golden State goes up 3-1 or Cleveland ties 2-2 in the trophy count. If it\u2019s the latter, of course, there will be clamoring for a tiebreaker, as in 2019 Finals. So be careful what you wish for. 1. Who guards LeBron? This is the first question (or should be) of every preview of every playoff series every year of James\u2019 career since he first started qualifying in 2006. So far in this postseason, James has dealt with Indiana\u2019s Bojan Bogdanovic and Lance Stephenson, Toronto\u2019s OG Anunoby and Pascal Siakam and Boston\u2019s Marcus Morris with Jaylen Brown, Marcus Smart and other helpers. Now it\u2019s old familiar \u2014 wait a minute! If Andre Iguodala, the Warriors\u2019 primary James assignment, isn\u2019t recovered from the bone bruise that sat him down in the Houston series, we will see Draymond Green, maybe some David West and younger defense-committee members. Iggy is Golden State\u2019s preferred option, not just to pester and deny the Cavs\u2019 star at one end but to attack to make James work as a defender himself. 2. Who guards Kevin Durant? And as soon as you answer that question, tell us who guards Steph Curry and Klay Thompson and Green and\u2026 That\u2019s always the problem with the Warriors, the sheer number of scoring weapons they can throw at any defensive game plan. Since Cleveland ranked 29th of the 30 teams in defensive rating, it will rely more on individual matchups and adjustments \u2014 the way Lue went to Tristan Thompson or Larry Nance up front as he saw fit to prompt or counter Boston\u2019s tactics. Still, as far as Durant goes, Jeff Green is a mobile wing new to this series and Rodney Hood might have been as well, if he hadn\u2019t dropped out of Lue\u2019s rotation weeks ago. 3. Does this whole thing get decided in the third quarter? The old clich\u00e9 about the NBA was that you could watch the last five minutes and see everything you need. Updated to 2018 with these combatants, those first 12 minutes after halftime loom as pivotal. The Cavaliers have had a bad habit of coming out flat in the third quarter this postseason \u2014 they have been outscored 438-437 in their 18 playoff games and have hit just 34.6 percent of their shots. Golden State, by contrast, is relentless in the third. In their 17 playoff games to this point, the Warriors outscored teams by 130 points in the third quarter, compared to a total of 20 points in the other three quarters combined. They hit 51.9 percent of their shots while averaging a lethal 30.5 points in that period. Fixing their leaks while slowing down the Californians just in the third quarter could swing a couple games. 4.5 \u2014 The Warriors have been the postseason\u2019s most improved defensive team, having allowed 4.5 fewer points per 100 possessions in the playoffs ( 99.7 ) than they did in the regular season ( 104.2 ). It was on defense where the Warriors fell off (and ranked ninth) in the regular season, but they\u2019ve had the No. 1 defense in each round of the playoffs thus far. They\u2019ve held their three opponents \u2014 San Antonio, New Orleans and Houston \u2014 to 5.2, 9.2 and 11.9 fewer points per 100 possessions than they scored in the regular season, respectively. The Cavs have had the second most improved defense in the playoffs, having allowed 3.6 fewer points per 100 possessions (105.9) than they did in the regular season (109.5). Of course, they had more room for improvement, having ranked 29th, and their best round defensively in regard to holding an opponent under its regular season mark for offensive efficiency (they held Boston to 3.2 fewer points per 100 possessions than it scored in the regular season) wasn\u2019t as good as the Warriors\u2019 worst round. Still, since the league started counting turnovers in 1977 (41 seasons), no other team had ranked in the bottom three defensively in the regular season and gone on to win a playoff series. So the Cavs have already made history in winning three. \u2014 John Schuhmann In a brief interview with TheAthletic.com immediately after the Warriors\u2019 Game 7 victory in Houston Monday, team owner Joe Lacob said: \u201cSort of tired of Cleveland, to be honest. But having said that, LeBron James is an immense challenge, an incredible player. It\u2019ll be fun.\u201d Familiarity might grow more respect between the principals in this series \u2014 James seems to get along swimmingly with Durant, while no NBA player past or present denies James\u2019 talents and achievements \u2014 but it also famously breeds contempt. Green and James have a history, fans on both sides have honed their heckling over three years and probably both the Warriors and the Cavaliers would have welcomed a change of foe. The regular-season series went handily 2-0 to Golden State, but they faced each other way back on Christmas Day and MLK Day \u2014 and, in fact, it was Cleveland\u2019s low-energy performance in the second meeting that led to its big roster makeover at the trade deadline. Those moves, exciting at the time, have meshed slowly and inconsistently, leaving James to again shoulder too great a burden. He carried a 2015 Cavs team subbing in Matthew Dellavedova for Kyrie Irving to six games vs. Golden State, but the Warriors were new to this themselves then. This time may go down like a rerun \u2014 or \u201cencore presentation,\u201d as they say in the world of TV series \u2014 of 2017.

This was sweat. This was Seven, as in games they were forced to play this deep into May. So the defending champions, humanized by chilly stretches and careless play at times over the last month, are hardly a finished product. But for the fourth straight year, they\u2019re a product of the NBA Finals . Isn\u2019t that what counts? In the end, the sheer force of their four All-Stars was too much for the Rockets, who were down a star of their own in the game that decided the Western Conference crown. Trailing by as many as 15 points in the first half, the Warriors rode another lethal third quarter to 101-92 victory in Game 7 of the Western conference finals . Therefore, the task of figuring out this stubborn Golden State dynasty is once again left to LeBron James, the only human to do so since the Warriors became a Big Deal. \u201cWe\u2019ve got one series to go,\u201d said Kevin Durant. What the Warriors did repeatedly when twice faced with elimination in the West series was recover quickly enough to save themselves. They fell behind by double digits in the first halves of Games 6 and 7 and fought back, desperately and decisively, using killer shots. The Warriors flipped the score in their favor in a matter of minutes, a stealth reaction that only they\u2019re capable of doing. It helped that each time Houston was without Chris Paul, hurting with a strained right hamstring, and because of that, the West title comes with the unflattering affixed asterisk. Yes, luck was involved. Still: Champions did what champions do. Steph Curry and Klay Thompson both figured heavily into those rescue attempts, and they finished off the Rockets with a rat-a-tat succession of big buckets. It was quick and painless torture, and the Rockets simply wore down trying to prevent the counterpunch. Eventually, they caved. James Harden was gassed trying to pull off a solo scoring act with Paul on the bench, and as a team the Rockets shot just 7 of 44 from deep in Game 7 \u2014 missing an astonishing 27 consecutive 3-pointers at one point. So it was that combination of a strong response and a whipped victim that made Golden State the conference bully once again and produced Warriors vs. Cavaliers, Part IV. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens,\u201d Kevin Durant said. \u201cHopefully we\u2019ll figure it out and get it done.\u201d What makes the Warriors so unique, of course, is their wealth of stars in their prime. What other team can call plays for Durant, Curry, Thompson and Draymond Green? More importantly, that A-list depth allows the Warriors to survive if one or two are having a crummy night. When Durant was flummoxed by the Rockets\u2019 switching defense, Thompson took over that share of the load. When Curry turned to vapor for a spell, Green assumed the playmaking chores. And when Andre Iguodala suffered a knee injury and missed the last four games, those stars simply worked longer and harder to hide his absence. That\u2019s luxury on a historic level, perhaps not seen since those loaded title contenders in the Golden \u201880s. So they go into the Finals with the same core as last summer, just a bit more dog-eared around the corners. The next series will reveal whether the Warriors\u2019 problems were due to a Houston team that had the best record in the West, or their own self-inflicted problems. Or maybe just too much LeBron. He won\u2019t test them. They\u2019ve already been tested. The Warriors fell behind by 15 in the first half of a Game 7 on the road described as \u201cbizarre\u201d by Kerr. That\u2019s usually deadly. And it was also the manner in which they dropped into a hole; the Warriors had four fouls in the first 55 seconds with Thompson drawing two and subsequently getting heavy bench time. P.J. Tucker and Clint Capela were punching them in the gut. Clearly, the urgency and burden weighed on the Warriors. \u201cThere was a moment in the first half where Draymond turned it over in transition,\u201d Curry said. \u201cThat\u2019s a point where you can have guys doing a lot of finger pointing and blaming. [But] everybody was like, let\u2019s move on. There was a calmness at halftime in the locker room because we knew how bad we were playing, [but] we were in this situation before. \u201cI think it was a level of experience and maturity from our group that helped us get to the finish line.\u201d Kerr said: \u201cShots are harder to make, tougher to execute. It\u2019s a Game 7. Everybody\u2019s tense. We lost our composure. Houston was outperforming us and out competing us. I didn\u2019t recognize the group we were seeing. [But] we have three of the best shot makers in the league.\u201d The third quarter was owned quickly by the Warriors. Curry scored 14 of his 27 in the third and gave the Warriors the lead for good with one of his four threes in the period. The Warriors scored 35 points with Thompson on the bench for all but three minutes. Again, how many teams can pull that off? In the second half, the Warriors shot 53 percent overall and 55 percent from distance. It was an ambush. Oh: Thompson returned in the fourth quarter, quickly drilled a pair of threes and that was a wrap. \u201cOur talent took over,\u201d said Kerr. \u201cSimple as that.\u201d What next? Well, we\u2019ve seen this movie before. The Warriors beat LeBron and the Cavs last summer in five games because Durant, in his first year with Golden State, went ballistic. Here in the fourth installment, LeBron is playing better \u2014 at age 33, no less \u2014 and the Warriors, who lost only once in the 2017 playoffs, are perhaps a bit more vulnerable. Durant struggled against the Rockets for about 60 percent of the series and a pair of fourth quarters where he shot 1 for 8. He gave all the credit to the Houston defense, which he didn\u2019t solve until the second half of Game 7, where he scored 21 of his 34 points. Can Cleveland muster a similar Durant-proof system? Surely, the Cavs\u2019 scouting department has cable TV. They\u2019ve seen the last two weeks and the fog Durant was trapped inside. \u201cWhen I just decided to say, forget it, and just hoop and play ball, tonight I just tried to come out and play hard on the defensive side of the ball and let my offense come around,\u201d he said. \u201cMentally, I just tried to figure myself out.\u201d There\u2019s also the issue of Iguodala, who normally would draw the first line of defense against LeBron and won the Finals MVP three years ago for that work. Kerr wasn\u2019t sure if or when Iguodala would return to action, and when asked after the game Monday about his status for the Finals, Iggy said: \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Without Iguodala against the Rockets, the Warriors sifted through Jordan Bell, Quinn Cook and Nick Young with mostly mild results. But what the Warriors have shown here in the spring of 2018 is their ability to survive imperfection. They weren\u2019t 2017 solid, not even close. And the Rockets, arguably, were a bigger threat in the West finals than the Cavs will be in the NBA Finals. Perhaps the worst is behind the Warriors but LeBron will have the ultimate say in that. Today the Warriors are thrilled to see LeBron. Yes, the West didn\u2019t come easy. \u201cThis is a true testament to how hard it is to get to the Finals, how hard it is to have a chance to play for a championship,\u201d said Curry. \u201cThe fight that [Houston] put up this whole series to really, really challenge us all the way down to the fourth quarter of a Game 7 \u2026 we had to work for it. It\u2019s really hard.\u201d * * * Veteran NBA writer Shaun Powell has worked for newspapers and other publications for more than 25 years.

For Mike D\u2019Antoni, for Chris Paul, James Harden and the rest of the Houston Rockets. All of the demons of playoffs past that the were to be eradicated with one game, Game 7 of the Western Conference finals on their home floor against the reigning champion Golden State Warriors, and all of the noise would be silenced. But it wasn\u2019t to be. The team these Rockets were built to beat, would not be denied. The Rockets\u2019 record-setting season, the best regular season in franchise history, was undone by another record they ran into head on in what turned out to be the final night of their would-be magical campaign. The Rockets shot a jaw-dropping 44 times from beyond the 3-point line, making just seven while enduring a cover-your-eyes stretch that saw them miss a staggering 27 straight. The 37 misses from deep are a playoff record. They broke their own record of 36, which they set in the first round against the Minnesota Timberwolves when they shot 16-for-52 in Game 2 and won by 20 points. You can go cold as ice from deep in a first-round series against an overmatched opponent and still win in a runaway. You can\u2019t do it against the best shooting team in NBA history in a game with everything on the line. And as the Rockets sputtered in the third quarter the Warriors heated up. A Kevin Durant 3-pointer tied the game at 61 with 4:34 to play in the third and a corner 3 from Curry with 36 seconds later gave the Warriors a 64-61 lead they\u2019d never surrender. \u201cThese guys, you think you\u2019ve got them or you think you are guarding them okay, and it\u2019s just, if you take a deep breath one time, it\u2019s a 3,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said. \u201cThat\u2019s why they\u2019re so good.\u201d P.J. Tucker\u2019s corner 3 late in the game was the Rockets\u2019 only made basket from distance after halftime, an ugly 1-for-21 effort that precipitated their collapse from an earlier 15-point lead. \u201cMan, it hurts bad,\u201d said veteran Rockets forward Trevor Ariza, who had perhaps the most brutal night of all, going scoreless on 0-for-12 shooting from the floor, including 0-for-9 from deep. \u201cWe played hard, though, we fought hard. I\u2019m just hurt right now. Yeah, this one hurt real bad.\u201d Their early lead provided even more false security for a team that already had to work without Paul in Games 6 and 7; that right hamstring strain suffered in the final minute of the Rockets\u2019 Game 5 win ending his season prematurely. The Rockets\u2019 season-long focus on the Warriors provided the ultimate incentive, from Daryl Morey\u2019s obsession with the four-time Western Conference champs as he put this Rockets team together last summer, until the final buzzer Monday night. But now the after taste of being so close but just not quite healthy or good enough will linger into another offseason that begins before June. The manner in which they lost cuts particularly deep for a team that bragged about its \u201cswagger\u201d all season, from opening night at Oracle Arena when they spoiled ring\/banner night for the Warriors right up until their fall in Game 7, when the strength they\u2019d relied on all season failed them. \u201cOne half of basketball,\u201d Harden said. \u201cTwo games, Game 6 and 7. One half of basketball. We just didn\u2019t have the same energy that we had in the first half or the pace. So it\u2019s extremely frustrating \u2026 we had an opportunity tonight and last game without Chris. Obviously he\u2019s a big part of why we are here, but we had opportunities, especially in the first half of both games.\u201d D\u2019Antoni praised his team after it was all over, refusing once again to measure them based solely on the results of this series and this postseason. He stayed true to his word before the playoffs began, insisting that what happens now would not define the careers of Harden or Paul. It\u2019s a noble thought, a fine gesture from an accomplished coach who helped revolutionize the game but is lacking that one breakthrough trip to basketball\u2019s biggest stage: The Finals. If that\u2019s the way it looks and feels from the inside, fine. But externally, the results are all that matter. And D\u2019Antoni, Harden and Paul go into the offseason with the same whispers, the same doubters wondering about their readiness for the magnitude of these sorts of moments. D\u2019Antoni is still the great coach without a signature accomplishment. His team had a 3-2 edge in this series and home-court advantage in their back pocket, and couldn\u2019t finish against a team that has mastered the style of play he introduced to the league during his days in Phoenix with a two-time Kia MVP running the show. D\u2019Antoni\u2019s confidence, however, will not be shaken by yet another postseason failure. \u201cNo, because the other team\u2019s doing it,\u201d he said. \u201cNo, not at all. That\u2019s where the game\u2019s going. Now we should have made some more (3s) but no, I don\u2019t lose confidence in that. We\u2019ve got the right formula. We\u2019ve got to execute it. We\u2019ve got to do a little bit better and it would be nice if they would help out a little bit, but it seems like they\u2019re not. We\u2019ll get better.\u201d Paul is still the all-time great point guard who can\u2019t seem to stay healthy long enough to fulfill his destiny on a championship stage. \u201cWe knew it was going to be tough on him,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said. \u201cMostly I hate it for him. He\u2019s probably more devastated than anybody. But again, I know the fans of Houston, especially myself, to have him on your side is incredible. He\u2019ll be back. Like I said, he\u2019ll be even better. We\u2019ll be better.\u201d Harden, the likely Kia MVP this season, is favored to join an unfortunate cast of players with the most valuable hardware but without a championship ring to go with it. After scoring 41 points in Game 1, his numbers continued to slide. He averaged 26.7 points on 38 percent shooting from the floor, including 20 from beyond the arc, over the final six games. And since Paul was relegated to a sideline motivator role for the final two games, the burden Harden carries into the offseason for this latest setback is magnified. But like his coach, Harden said there was no turning back. Even with a record blizzard of 3-point misses, there was never so much as a passing thought to change up and try something different. \u201cI mean, we had a lot of open shots,\u201d Harden said, confident to the bitter end. \u201cI think we competed, and competed the best we can.\u201d The Rockets\u2019 best would have been good enough to beat anyone else in the NBA Monday night. Just not the one team they were supposed to built for. * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

"},{"id":40312,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/morning-tip-national-anthem-history-first-amendment","date":"2018-05-28","title":"National anthem is inseparable from politics","content":" We are, again, forced to contemplate the meaning of the First Amendment and the national anthem with regard to sports, and those who play them. The decision last week by NFL owners (owners? Doesn\u2019t anyone see the complexity of using that terminology alone?) to require players on NFL teams to stand during the playing of the national anthem re-ignited the debate on what to do about players who kneeled or made other expressions during the playing of the song to protest police brutality against people of color and other injustices. The NFL said that players who didn\u2019t want to stand during the anthem were free to remain in their teams\u2019 respective locker rooms while the song was played. But kneeling or other gestures would subject both players and their teams to a fine. According to the league\u2019s language in announcing the policy , NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell \u201cwill impose appropriate discipline on league personnel who do not stand and show respect for the flag and the Anthem.\u201d In doing so, the NFL again conflated the issue. The original protest by then-49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, in which he sat during the playing of the anthem before an exhibition game in 2016, had nothing to do with the anthem, as he has made abundantly clear since.  \u201cI am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,\u201d Kaepernick told the NFL Network\u2019s Steve Wyche after that game. \u201cTo me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.\u201d Two days later, Kaepernick told reporters , \u201cultimately, it\u2019s to bring awareness and make people realize what\u2019s really going on in this country. There are a lot of things that are going on that are unjust (that) people aren\u2019t being held accountable for, and that\u2019s something that needs to change. That\u2019s something that \u2026 you know, this country stands for freedom, liberty, justice for all. And it\u2019s not happening for all right now \u2026 I\u2019m going to continue to sit. I\u2019m going to continue to stand with the people that are being oppressed.\u201d Again, Kaepernick was clear. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of things that need to change,\u201d he said. \u201cOne, specifically, is police brutality. There\u2019s people being murdered unjustly, and (police) not being held accountable. Cops are getting paid leave for killing people. That\u2019s not right. That\u2019s not right by anyone\u2019s standards.\u201d Later, Kaepernick started kneeling while the anthem was played \u2014 an idea suggested by U.S. Army veteran and former NFL player, Nate Boyer . And when he was specifically asked about the flag and the military in the context of his protest, Kaepernick said: \u201cI have great respect for men and women who have fought for this country. I have family, I have friends who have gone and fought for this country. And they fight for freedom. They fight for freedom; they fight for the people and for liberty and justice, for everyone. And that\u2019s not happening. I mean, people are dying in vain because this country isn\u2019t holding their end of the bargain up, as far as, you know, giving freedom and liberty and justice to everybody. It\u2019s something that\u2019s not happening. I\u2019ve seen videos, I\u2019ve seen circumstances where men and women that have been in the military have come back and have been treated unjustly by the country they fought for, and have been murdered by the country they fought for. On our land. That\u2019s not right.\u201d Of course, in contrast, the NBA has already had, and continues to enforce, a longstanding rule requiring players to stand during the playing of the anthem. And, this season, every player has stood \u2014 though many have done so while interlocking arms with their teammates. But, there have been no player protests in the NBA. Some have criticized the NBA and its players for not engaging the issue as so many NFL players did last season, and point out that the careers of former players Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf and Craig Hodges \u2014 Abdul-Rauf refused to stand for the anthem while playing for the Nuggets; Hodges was extremely critical of American involvement in the first Gulf War \u2014 were shortened in much the way that Kaepernick\u2019s seems to have been, by every team simply refusing to sign them to contracts. Yet the more recent history of both the league and its players has been one in which players, team officials and league officials speak up on the issues of the day without repercussions. \u201cI think it\u2019s just typical of the NFL,\u201d Warriors Coach Steve Kerr said last Thursday, before Game 5 of the Western Conference finals in Houston. \u201cThey\u2019re just playing to their fan base, and they\u2019re just, you know, basically trying to use the anthem as fake patriotism, nationalism, scaring people,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt\u2019s idiotic, but that\u2019s how the NFL has handled their business. I\u2019m proud to be in a league that understands patriotism in America is about free speech and about peacefully protesting. I think our leadership in the NBA understands that when the NFL players were kneeling, they were kneeling to protest police brutality, to protest racial inequality. They weren\u2019t disrespecting the flag or the military, But our president decided to make it about that. The NFL followed suit, pandered to their fan base, created this hysteria. It\u2019s kind of what\u2019s wrong with our country right now; people in high places are trying to divide us, divide loyalties, make this about the flag, as if the flag is something other than what it really it. It\u2019s a representation of what we\u2019re about, which is diversity, peaceful protests, the ability, the right to free speech. It\u2019s really ironic, actually, what the NFL is doing.\u201d A day later, the Milwaukee Bucks issued a very strong statement, on the team\u2019s official stationary and sent out on its website, condemning police brutality in all forms after video of Bucks guard Sterling Brown, who was tasered by Milwaukee police in January while being questioned in a Walgreen\u2019s parking lot, was released . Brown is suing the Milwaukee police, whose chief has already apologized for his officers\u2019 actions. The Bucks\u2019 statement was ultimately approved by the team\u2019s ownership group led by Wes Edens, Marc Lasry and Jamie Dinan, along with team president Peter Feigin. \u201cUnfortunately, this isn\u2019t an isolated case,\u201d the team said in its statement. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t require an incident involving a professional athlete to draw attention to the fact that vulnerable people in our communities have experienced similar, and even worse, treatment. \u201cWe are grateful for the service of many good police officers that courageously protect us, our fans and our city, but racial biases and abuses of power must not be ignored. \u201cThere needs to be more accountability.\u201d The statement  falls in line with other recent gestures of support for marginalized and oppressed people. There were the \u201cI Can\u2019t Breathe\u201d warmup shirts worn by LeBron James and other stars before games in 2014 in support of the late Eric Garner, who spoke those words as he was being choked by New York police arresting him for selling cigarettes earlier that year. Garner died after being put in a headlock by a police officer for 15 to 19 seconds and then pushed face down into the sidewalk; the medical examiner\u2019s report listed the cause of death as compression of neck, compression of chest and prone positioning during physical restraint by police,\u201d and ruled the death a homicide. However, a grand jury declined to indict the officers involved. Minnesota Lynx players and others in the WNBA wore \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d warmup shirts in 2016 , and players in New York, Indiana and Washington refused to answer reporters\u2019 questions after games unless they related to BLM or other social justice issues. There was the opening segment of the ESPYs in 2016 , after the police shootings the week before of Philando Castile in Minnesota and Alton Sterling in Louisiana, in which James, Chris Paul, Dwyane Wade and Carmelo Anthony decried both police shootings and the murder of people of color by people of color in Chicago and other cities. https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v A pause here. You understand that there are people of good will who don\u2019t want to abridge anyone else\u2019s rights, but just want to forget their lives for a couple of hours by watching the best athletes in the world do whatever it is they\u2019re doing that day \u2014 catching a football, throwing a baseball, crossing over a defender with a basketball, blasting a slapshot from the dot. And I get that. But the very notion of playing the national anthem and standing while it plays is a political act . The anthem, a poem written by the attorney Francis Scott Key as he witnessed the attack on Fort McHenry just outside of Baltimore in 1814 as he tried to arrange for the release of a physician being held by the British, is most certainly a paean to the triumph of the U.S. forces defending the Fort. Standing and singing the anthem is, at the least, supporting that. And it\u2019s okay to do so. But it is, nonetheless, political. \u201cThe song itself was a call to arms, ad it has a very political message to it, which is why a lot of people have objected to it over the years,\u201d says Dr. Christopher Olsen, the Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at Indiana State University. \u201cIt is an odd national anthem, because it is so particularly focused.\u201d Key wrote four stanzas in his poem. We only sing the first (\u201c\u2026and the rockets\u2019 red glare,\u201d etc.); few people probably know there are three more stanzas. ( This is how the whole song probably was meant to be sung \u2014 the original Key poem was, almost from the beginning, connected to the British drinking song \u201cTo Anacreon in Heaven.\u201d But at more than five minutes in length, the whole poem\/song would cut into the first quarter!) For brevity\u2019s sake, let\u2019s not argue about the second stanza \u2014 a reference to the British seeing the still waving American flag from their shores \u2014 or the fourth, a paean to \u201cfreemen\u201d who stand \u201c Between their lov\u2019d home and the war\u2019s desolation!,\u201d and to \u201cthe power that hath made and preserv\u2019d us a nation!\u201d Fairly boilerplate, patriotic stuff \u2014 neither of which, also, are almost ever sung. It\u2019s the third, also almost never sung, stanza that catches your eye \u2014 if your eyes are ones that are interested in catching such things: Understanding the meaning of the stanza requires some background. During the War of 1812, some slaves who escaped their masters in the United States opted to fight for the British in exchange for their freedom after the war. Those slaves formed what was called the British Corps of Colonial Marines . The British Navy Admiral George Cockburn, motivated perhaps both by belief and pragmatism, helped rescue more than 6,000 slaves ; after the war, the British honored their promise, resettling more than 700 former U.S. slaves on the island of Trinidad . It was a practice that the British had begun during the Revolutionary War with Dunmore\u2019s Proclamation, issued by John Murray, the fourth Earl of Dunmore, in 1775, promising freedom for slaves who left any owner fighting against the crown and joined the British to fight for them. One estimate is that 20,000 former slaves wound up fighting for the British during the Revolutionary War, while just 5,000 fought in the Continental Army. The Colonial Marines were among the British forces that bombed Fort McHenry. Also among the British forces were mercenaries, soldiers paid by the British to fight on their side. Those are the \u201chirelings\u201d to which Key refers in the third stanza, along with the \u201cslave\u201d that fought as a member of the Colonial Marines. There is significant difference of opinion, as you might expect, about what Key was getting at in the third stanza. Some historians have a benign interpretation , saying Key\u2019s antipathy to the \u201chireling and slave\u201d was not racist but an expression of his anger at their fighting for the other side in the War. Others, though, citing Key\u2019s reference to the British forces as a \u201cband\u201d rather than an Army , believe the third stanza to be a racist insult. Olsen believes Key wrote the poem while he was both in \u201cfear for his life and unbelievably angry.\u201d  Dunmore\u2019s Proclamation and the resulting flood of ex-slaves to fight against the Americans could have well been in Key\u2019s mind. Very fresh in his mind, without a doubt, was the Haitian Revolution, the 13-year struggle for freedom on the part of people of color on that island, culminating in its independence from French rule in 1804. That victory would have been eye-opening to Americans seeing ex-slaves throw out their former masters. \u201cWhites were incensed that the British would incite slave rebellion, in their mind, by offering freedom,\u201d Olsen said. \u201cThe Patriots, to use the language of today, played the race card. They offered free land for people who killed Indians. They knew the history of the British appealing to slaves, and they were terrified by it. And between the Revolution and this, there was the Haitian Rebellion. The specter of that, those things were terrifying. My gut reading was (Key) was taking pleasure and really expressing his visceral hatred and fear at the same time of the what the British were trying to do.\u201d Key\u2019s, and by extension, the anthem\u2019s, place in American history is, as with almost everything else during that time, extremely complicated and contradictory. Key owned slaves, but freed many of them during his life. He represented individual people of color in various cases in which they sought their freedom, yet his views on slaves as a whole seem quite clear: he viewed African slaves as \u201ca distinct and inferior race of people, which all experience proves to be the greatest evil that afflicts a community.\u201d . He prosecuted abolitionists, and represented slave owners in court seeking return of their \u201cproperty\u201d \u2014 human beings in bondage. Yet he also represented hundreds of slaves above the Spanish slave ship Antelope that was captured off the coast of what was then Spanish Florida in 1820 ; Key argued for their release and return to Africa. But this seemingly schizophrenic positioning on race was not an outlier in Key\u2019s time. \u201cTo me, Key is not that unusual, in the sense that he was very much like a lot of wealthy, especially border state, white southerners,\u201d Olsen said. \u201cPeople have argued the complexity of him because he opposed the slave trade. Sometimes it was humanitarian, but most of the time it was economic. They were selling slaves south and west, and they didn\u2019t want cheaper slaves coming in from Africa \u2026 today, the trade, to us, seems like part of the story. At the time, people saw it as very different, and almost unrelated. They didn\u2019t see the trade as part of slavery. They felt like people should be glad being in the U.S. however they got here \u2026 it was relatively easy for whites like Key who weren\u2019t involved in the daily violence and torture of slavery to take the moral high ground.\u201d Didn\u2019t mean to go all history professor tweed jacket on y\u2019all. I\u2019m just trying to make a point. The anthem itself is political. So was the man who wrote it. To tell NFL players and NBA coaches and NBA owners to shut up, stop speaking out\/making gestures and stick to sports seems to indicate the preference for only one side of a discussion and debate to be heard. And if an NBA player kneels during the playing of the anthem next season, one hopes their voice and arguments will be heard rather than shoved into the quiet safe space of a locker room where no one else can hear them. *** Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

At various other times of the year it rises first at Maine\u2019s Cadillac Mountain, or West Quoddy Head Lighthouse in the city of Lubec, population 1,359. But, always, it rises. Apparently, then, an epoch did not have to take place before true competition returned to the NBA. The last two years have been filled with caterwauling about that subject that would make the Magical Mr. Mistoffelees from Cats blanch. Kevin Durant\u2019s decision to join the Warriors in 2016, combined with LeBron James\u2019s dominance with the Cavaliers in the Eastern Conference, had both veteran team officials around the league and many who cover it in a state of panic about the supposed end of real battles for championships. And three straight Warriors-Cavaliers Finals only added fuel to the perception that the Dubs had become unbeatable, and the Cavaliers unthreatened in the East. But just two years after Durant disclosed his next chapter in The Players\u2019 Tribune, his Warriors were staring down a seventh game on the road against the Rockets, a team built specifically to take Golden State down. James and the Cavs were also in an elimination game on the road, in Boston, against the upstart Celtics, whose future looks limitless in the East, and which beat an equally emerging power in Philadelphia in the second round. It marked the first time there were two Game 7s in the conference finals since 1979. That James and his Cavs, even without Kevin Love, still triumphed over Boston to clinch an eighth straight Finals appearance for his Eastern Conference teams since 2010, is further testament to his greatness. But it doesn\u2019t mean he wasn\u2019t stretched almost to the breaking point this postseason, having been taxed to the limit by Indiana in the first round before having to go seven against Boston \u2014 which, it must be stated, made it to the seventh game of the Eastern Conference finals with a bunch of kids leading the way \u2014 and without Kyrie Irving and Gordon Hayward. It did not take a generation for someone to figure out how to threaten the Warriors\u2019 hegemony, and create a team that could jam up the gears of Golden State\u2019s point scoring, league-changing machine. With the Celtics and 76ers rapidly rising in the East, James does not look to have an unending string of Finals appearances in the future. Challenging Golden State and Cleveland didn\u2019t take a miracle or an act of Congress. It took planning, aggressive dealmaking and some good fortune. The rise of the Rockets and Celtics does not mean building such a team is easy, or sustainable; everyone is an ACL away from the Lottery. But it can be done. \u201cIt obviously gives hope,\u201d one Western Conference executive said over the weekend, \u201cbut I think you have to dig deeper and see how each of them were able to build their respective teams.\u201d True. Each was built completely differently from the other. Boston, of course, picked the Nets clean in that 2013 trade that centered on Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett going to Brooklyn in exchange for a sack full of first-round picks \u2014 in 2014, 2016 and 2018, with the right to swap firsts with Brooklyn in 2017. The Celtics didn\u2019t hit on all of them; the first first-rounder was used in 2014 on James Young, who didn\u2019t pan out for the Cs after two-plus seasons. But Celtics president Danny Ainge took Jaylen Brown with what became the third pick overall in the 2016 Draft, then used the flipped 2017 pick from Brooklyn \u2014 which became the top pick overall in the \u201917 Draft \u2014 in a deal with Philly to move down to three, where Ainge took Duke\u2019s Jayson Tatum. (Ainge got yet another first out of the deal, from Philly, that will be conveyed to Boston in 2019 \u2014 either the Sixers\u2019 own pick or the first-round pick Philadelphia has via Sacramento, whichever is better). And Boston took the 2018 first from Brooklyn and put it in the package that netted Irving from Cleveland last summer.  Yet Boston\u2019s successful pursuit of Al Horford (2016) and Gordon Hayward (2017) in free agency was just as important. The Celtics didn\u2019t get Durant, but they got the next best prizes available in successive years. And Ainge\u2019s biggest, boldest acquisition, of course, was getting Brad Stevens out of Butler and watching him blossom into one of the NBA\u2019s top three or four coaches seemingly overnight. \u201cBoston having lottery picks without bottoming out and selecting the right players and having a high performing culture driving veteran with Horford has been critical to their success,\u201d the Western Conference executive said. \u201cThe Brooklyn trade is the gift that keeps giving. The fact that Boston is winning with such young players in high pressure situations gives young teams hope.\u201d Houston\u2019s build started with the acquisition of James Harden from Oklahoma City in 2012, along with the ascension of GM Daryl Morey and his belief in the primacy of the three. The Rockets have built Harden\u2019s supporting cast mainly through trades (Chris Paul, Trevor Ariza) and free agency (P.J. Tucker, Luc Mbah a Moute), but they hit big in the Draft in 2014 with Clint Capela, taken late in the first round. \u201cOnce they landed two stars, they have done an excellent job of surrounding them with enough shooting and toughness,\u201d the West executive said, \u201calong with the continued emergence of Capela who has become a top 7-8 center in the league.\u201d  Teams other than Houston and Boston hadn\u2019t completely abandoned ship in pursuit of the Warriors and Cavs. Oklahoma City went all in to compete this year with its acquisitions of Paul George and Carmelo Anthony; Toronto maxed out in the regular season; New Orleans was a buyer at the trade deadline, bringing in Nikola Mirotic after DeMarcus Cousins\u2019s season-ending Achilles\u2019 injury. But the Raptors flamed out again against the Cavs in the playoffs , costing Dwane Casey his job, and the Pelicans were game but ultimately not good enough to beat Golden State in the second round . The question for those teams now \u2014 and for upstarts like Indy in the East and Portland in the West \u2014 is what their next steps will be to continue improving and to provide potential real challenges to the elite teams in their conferences. It\u2019s hard enough to build a team good enough to consistently win 50 games every year; San Antonio\u2019s 18-year streak of 50-win seasons is an outlier of gigantic proportion. The meat of the Nowitzki Era in Dallas \u2014 11 straight years of 50 or more wins between 2000 and 2011 \u2014 is such a hard thing to consistently sell to everyone if you don\u2019t break through for championships: to ownership, to fans, to media (though Mark Cuban, Donnie Nelson, Rick Carlisle and Nowitzki managed to do so in Dallas for the most part before finally being rewarded in 2011). The fog of history tends to obscure the details and gray areas of all of us. The Bulls, if you listen to some who weren\u2019t there at the time, were never challenged during the Jordan Era, never met opponents who competed with them at the highest level. And that\u2019s just so much nonsense. The Knicks and Heat and Pacers each pushed Chicago in the East before the Bulls triumphed, and the Jazz were seconds away from forcing a seventh game in 1998, which would have been played in Salt Lake City. But those Jazz teams led by Hall of Famers John Stockton and Karl Malone \u2014 11 50-win seasons, two Finals appearances, three Western Conference finals appearances \u2014 would likely never get that much time today, to just be really good for a decade, because that\u2019s no longer acceptable in most places. Boston\u2019s rise wasn\u2019t linear. Ainge took a lot of flak for not cashing in those picks, rolling them over year after year, waiting for the right guys to take, rather than packaging a couple of them for an All-Star he could have paired with, say, Isaiah Thomas and Avery Bradley and won a comfortable 45-50 every season. But Ainge was willing to wait, to turn his roster over and over again until he found potential difference makers. And the Celtics\u2019 ownership backed him. Teams can either compete for titles today, or be in teardown mode. There doesn\u2019t seem to be a place for a team like the Jazz, or the Bucks teams of Don Nelson in the \u201980s. You are either at the apex of your very short window as a true contender, or you have to be in complete teardown\/tank mode, with no guarantee you\u2019ll ever get back to the level you were at before. The Process, ultimately, worked in Philadelphia. It required an inordinate amount of patience from ownership, which ultimately still didn\u2019t stay patient long enough for Sam Hinkie to keep his job. Oklahoma City built a championship level team with Durant, Harden and Russell Westbrook, stayed at that level after trading Harden, and has remained a playoff team after losing Durant for nothing. That\u2019s a decade of success in a small market, and it\u2019s not the norm. Indiana\u2019s George window opened and closed, and the Pacers should get all the credit in the world for a remarkably quick rebuild. But will these Pacers get back to a conference finals soon? And if they don\u2019t, how patient will everyone involved be? The league is strewn with recently successful playoff teams that quickly have reached various crossroads \u2014 Washington, Milwaukee, Charlotte, Memphis. (I want to write \u201cSan Antonio.\u201d I should write \u201cSan Antonio.\u201d I\u2019m afraid to write \u201cSan Antonio.\u201d) Will they keep plugging at it, trying to make their teams marginally better, or rip up their current plans and take gambles with big trades involving their current star players? That doesn\u2019t include recent perennial playoff teams that have gone full teardown \u2014 Atlanta, Chicago, Brooklyn, Dallas, Phoenix, the Clippers. It\u2019s not a criticism of any of those teams to ask: how long will it take before the Hawks win 60 games in a regular season again? How long will it take the Suns to make another conference final? Can you stay in the game, spending money (either as the owner or as the season ticket holder) when your team isn\u2019t likely to be playing in June? Because sticking with it, and staying at it, is the only way you\u2019ll even get a chance to have a shot at Golden State or Cleveland, much less knock them off. *** Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

From Jordan Taff : I think a short deal is possible, but again: there just aren\u2019t that many teams who have the means or the interest in doing so. Dallas could; the Mavs have long been rumored to have strong interest in Cousins, and their roster and style of play are fits for him. The Bulls have the room but I don\u2019t hear anything indicating they have interest. Robin Lopez has a year left on his deal and I think Chicago is happy with him; the Bulls want to play fast going forward, and that\u2019s not Cousins\u2019 strength. Miami wants to move Hassan Whiteside, but I can\u2019t see New Orleans being interested in a sign-and-trade deal for him involving Cousins. Down in Utah\/The guys and I dig a city called Salt Lake\/It\u2019s got the grooviest kids\/That\u2019s why we never get tired of Salt Lake. From Landon Leetzow : Well, Cali is home for PG13, so it\u2019s not so much \u2014 or, maybe, not just about \u2014 glitz and glamour. But I don\u2019t think Utah is going to make his cut. Could be wrong. The good news for you and other Jazz fans is that Utah doesn\u2019t need to get a \u201cname\u201d free agent this summer, IMHO; it already has Donovan Mitchell, whose ascension to superstar in one year changes everything for the franchise. If the Jazz braintrust remains convinced that Dante Exum can be a legit starting point guard down the road, I\u2019d say Utah\u2019s main need is frontcourt depth; Derrick Favors is unrestricted this summer and will get some strong interest. The Jazz would need to replace him with quality if it can\u2019t re-sign him. A guy like Boston\u2019s Aron Baynes, unrestricted as well this summer, would be a nice plug-and-play option that Utah could probably put off the Celtics\u2019 re-sign range with a strong push. Like Clarence Clemons, these Big Men could jam in any era. From Tommaso Atzeni : Great chicken and egg questions, Tommaso. But, as with all variations on this type of question that I receive about different eras, the answer is all about what rules you\u2019re playing under. The NBA of the \u201880s and \u201890s emphasized low-post scoring and big-man play because the rules of the time gave big men primacy over guards. You could hand check then. You could bump and hold cutters who came through the lane. The game was so much more physical then, you had to have a great center or power forward who could handle the pounding and still produce, because it was so relatively hard for guards to control games. That\u2019s why what Isiah Thomas did, at his size, in leading the Pistons to back-to-back titles in 1989 and 1990 was so remarkable. So, a talented big like AD or KAT would have thrived in those days. There would have been less interest in their developing 3-point range because the three wasn\u2019t emphasized back then. But their combinations of quickness and skill would have translated, I think; guys like KG and David Robinson who had similar body types and games did great. As for your other question, I think the primacy of the 3-pointer today, combined with the rules changes in the NBA over the last 15 years, has completely changed everything about the job description of everyone playing on a pro court. To me there\u2019s no question that the emphasis on running and shooting has made the \u201ctraditional\u201d big man of yesteryear a dinosaur. I always say, though, that somewhere out there, the next Shaq is eating and lifting and growing, and that at some point the pendulum will swing back toward that end because of that fact. I asked for Moonlighting questions , because \u2026 I loved Moonlighting. You delivered. From Joe Morris : Let me go on the record as saying I hated that episode , painting Agnes in such a horrible (if imaginary) light. But if I turned right instead of left and entered some sort of time portal\/wormhole, I\u2019d be a moderately popular high school history teacher, the guy that kids thought was cool and could always be counted on to volunteer for fundraisers and other projects by the faculty.

(Last week\u2019s averages in parenthesis) 1) James Harden (27 ppg, 4.7 rpg, 5.7 apg, .366 FG, .957 FT): He can shut everyone up starting at 9 p.m. Eastern, 8 p.m. Central. 2) LeBron James (37.8 ppg, 10.3 rpg, 6.5 apg, .495 FG, .692 FT) : Played 94:06 of the possible 96 minutes available for Cleveland in Games 6 and 7 of the Eastern Conference finals. At age 33. After playing all 82 regular season games, and leading the league in minutes played (36.9 per game). In his 15th NBA season. And in beating Boston Sunday in Game 7 , he made an eighth straight Finals appearance , which only five other men who\u2019ve ever played the game have done \u2014 none since 1966, when Bill Russell\u2019s Celtics played in their 10th straight Finals. 3) Anthony Davis: Season complete. 4) Kevin Durant (26.3 ppg, 7.7 rpg, 2.3 apg, .365 FG, .875 FT): The Rockets have stymied what looked like an unbreakable flow from Durant in the first two rounds against the Spurs and Pelicans. 5) Russell Westbrook: Season complete. 1 \u2014 Number of times this season the Celtics had scored fewer than 80 points in a game \u2014 last April 4, when Boston put up just 78 points in a 96-78 loss to Toronto. But in Boston\u2019s final game of the season, it managed just 79 points in 48 minutes against Cleveland in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference finals Sunday. $100,000 \u2014 Money raised by the Rockets for the Santa Fe High School Memorial Fund by selling 10,000 tickets to a watch party at Toyota Center for Game 6 of the West finals Saturday. 46 \u2014 Days since the Orlando Magic fired Frank Vogel, who was dismissed on April 12, the day after Orlando finished its season at 25-57. The Magic have interviewed several coaching candidates, most recently former Hornets coach Steve Clifford. 1) A blessed Memorial Day to all. May we never forget those who served to protect us all and who made the ultimate sacrifice \u2014 and those who served, and who have returned home. May they find peace and know how much we thank you for what you\u2019ve done for us. 2) We\u2019ve all been waiting eight months for Warriors-Rockets, Game 7, to decide the West for this season. And, tonight, we get it . 3) Dwane Casey would make all kinds of sense for the Pistons , given his recent history being directly involved in the patient, gradual building of the Raptors into a legit contender. It\u2019s going to take Detroit a while to get out of the hole the franchise is currently in. But one wonders if Casey wants to put himself through that kind of painstaking project when he\u2019s more than established himself as a coach worthy of taking over an already good team and trying to make it great. 4) HINKIE!!!!!! 5) Good luck with the comeback, STAT . Any time I can break out what may be my all-time favorite NBA dunk in tribute is a good day. 6) What I know about hockey can fit in a thimble. But I\u2019m so happy for Alex Ovechkin, who will finally get to play in Stanley Cup finals tonight with the Washington Capitals, after he waited more than a decade to get there for the first time and the franchise waited more than 20 years to get back after its lone appearance in 1998. 1) Hate this for Chris Paul. Hate it. He was playing with so much heart and was on the verge of taking the Dubs out of the playoffs. It just makes you sick to see him go down now. 2) A great, poignant and difficult read by ESPN\u2019s Brian Windhorst on the sudden death of Kirk Korver, the 27-year-old brother of Cavs guard Kyle Korver, last March. 3) We \u2014 and by \u201cwe,\u201d I mean men \u2014 can be awfully creepy sometimes . I can\u2019t imagine what a day in Danica Patrick\u2019s life is like. Just had a great conversation on the phone with Coach Fiz. Man im excited!!!!! Lets gooo!!! \u2014 Knicks forward Kristaps Porzingis (@kporzee), Thursday, 1:38 p.m., detailing his contact last week with new head coach David Fizdale. \u201cIt probably killed him more than anything sitting over there with us. So, he\u2019s just getting his taste of \u2018I don\u2019t think coaching is for me.\u2019 He wants to be on the floor.\u201d \u2014 Rockets Coach Mike D\u2019Antoni, lamenting the state of his star guard Chris Paul, sidelined with a pulled hamstring, and sitting on the bench during Game 6 of the Western Conference finals Saturday against Golden State. \u201cKyle Korver can block my shot 10 times and I\u2019m still walking him down in the post and still using my advantage against him. I don\u2019t care if he blocks it 15 times. I know in my mind he can\u2019t guard me. Period.\u201d \u2014 Celtics guard Jaylen Brown, to the Boston Globe , on how he deals with getting a shot blocked, as Korver did to him during the East finals last week. \u201cI\u2019m sure the same way everybody else here in this room feels: What the hell are you talking about? I think that was my reaction, as is everybody else\u2019s reaction.\u201d \u2014 Kobe Bryant, asked by a high school student what his reaction was to Kanye West\u2019s TMZ interview in which West said that the enslavement of Africans over centuries in the United States \u201csounds like a choice\u201d made by the Africans. * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

They can say that, in the last eight years, no Eastern Conference opponent has had a bigger lead over LeBron James\u2019 team with the chance to eliminate him. They can say that they made it to Game 7 of the conference finals without two of their three best players. They can say with confidence that their best years are ahead of them. They can also say that they blew a great opportunity to be the team that ended James\u2019 run atop the East and to be thought of as, perhaps, the most resilient team to ever make The Finals. The Celtics won 16 straight games shortly after seeing Gordon Hayward go down with a horrific injury. They improved offensively in the playoffs, despite the absence of leading scorer Kyrie Irving. They won their first 10 home games of the postseason. But they did not win their 11th and the Celtics\u2019 season of resilience came to an end in brutal fashion. Sometimes it really is a make-or-miss league, and the Celtics missed many shots on Sunday, losing 87-79 to the Cleveland Cavaliers in Game 7. They had their chances. And maybe it was just a young team unable to handle the moment. But the shot that will haunt them the most came from their most reliable veteran. With the Cavs up three and less than 3 1\/2 minutes to go in the fourth quarter, Jeff Green doubled Marcus Morris in the post, putting Cleveland in rotation. The ball found Al Horford behind the 3-point line, between the top of the key and the right wing. J.R. Smith, the nearest defender, had his head turned. Horford, a 42-percent 3-point shooter this season, was wide open. His shot hit the back of the rim and the Celtics wouldn\u2019t have another chance to tie or take the lead. \u201cWe put ourselves in position,\u201d Horford said. \u201cWe were one or two shots away from being there, and it just wasn\u2019t enough.\u201d Their effective field goal percentage of 38 percent was their third-worst mark in 101 total games this season. They shot a brutal 7-39 (18 percent) from 3-point range, and according to Second Spectrum tracking, 36 of those attempts were uncontested. \u201cJust one of those nights\u201d was a phrase uttered multiple times in the Boston locker room afterward. It was a bad time for \u201cjust one of those nights.\u201d The Celtics scored 35 points on their first 27 possessions of the game and took a 12-point lead on a Morris 3 with 8:52 left in the second quarter. Prior to Sunday, the largest in-game deficit James had faced while also facing elimination in the East over the last eight years was 11 (in the second quarter of Game 7 vs. Boston in 2012). Though the Celtics would hold a brief lead early in the fourth, the game may have been lost when that 12-point lead didn\u2019t become 15 or 16 with the Cavs going scoreless on their next five possessions. This was another slow-paced game (85 possessions per team) and neither team was shooting well from deep, making rallies that much more difficult. \u201cWe were in really good shape, really good shape,\u201d Celtics head coach Brad Stevens said. \u201cAnd then we just couldn\u2019t quite extend the lead.\u201d Missed shots and turnovers allowed the Cavs to climb to within four at halftime, and the Celtics\u2019 offense never really recovered. They scored 44 on their last 58 possession, an anemic rate of 0.76 points per trip. In the end, Irving\u2019s absence was felt. Celtics point guards Terry Rozier and Marcus Smart shot a combined 3-24, including 0-14 from 3-point range. Few expected the Celtics, without Irving, to get this far. But they just kept getting better through these playoffs and won their first three home games in this series by a total of 51 points. Stevens couldn\u2019t say that he was surprised that they were here. \u201cIt\u2019s funny how kind of the lens changes when you\u2019re sitting up here disappointed,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that\u2019s how much belief these guys instilled in all of us.\u201d He even thought they could win a game shooting so poorly. Smart, in true Marcus Smart fashion, was a plus-2 despite missing 9 of his 10 shots. \u201cThis team was the only team that I\u2019ve been around at this level,\u201d Stevens said, \u201cthat I thought we might shoot 36 percent and win the game.\u201d They did not. And no matter how impressed we all were with the Celtics this season, no matter what anybody\u2019s expectations were six weeks ago, the end still hurt. This Cleveland team, missing Irving just as much as the Celtics, was clearly the most beatable team James has had over the past eight years. When Boston led by 12 on Sunday, the Cavs\u2019 cumulative point differential for the postseason was a paltry plus-2. Taking this team to The Finals, with Kevin Love missing most of Game 6 and all of Game 7, may be James\u2019 greatest accomplishment. He averaged 36.7 points (on an effective field goal percentage of 61 percent), 9.3 rebounds and 8.3 assists over the last six games of the series. You have to tip your cap to the best player in the world, but you also have to think about the opportunity that slipped through your hands. \u201cThe pain is part of the path,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cAnd so we have to let it motivate us.\u201d The future is brighter in Boston than in any other NBA city. Hayward and Irving will be back next season, and Jayson Tatum \u2014 a rare offensive bright spot with 24 points \u2014 and Jaylen Brown will only get better. It would be a shock if the Celtics weren\u2019t back in the conference finals again next year. But, of course, nothing is guaranteed. There have been plenty of young teams in this league\u2019s past that failed to get back to the top after falling short. \u201cI could take a couple of days to kind of get away from it,\u201d Stevens said, \u201cbut training camp can\u2019t come soon enough.\u201d * * * John Schuhmann is a staff writer for NBA.com.

They have failed. Miserably and spectacularly. And that\u2019s even spotting them the first couple of summers to get their bearings after the whole \u201cSuper Team\u201d genesis in Miami back in 2010-11. James\u2019 domination of the conference continued Sunday when he and the Cleveland Cavaliers persevered in Game 7 against the Boston Celtics at TD Garden. Clawing back from 2-0 and 3-2 deficits in the series, and playing the final seven quarters without their second All-Star, forward Kevin Love (concussion protocol), the Cavaliers hung around in an ugly game. They took advantage of a Boston team on training wheels \u2013 7-39 on 3-pointers, oh my! \u2013 and snagged a ticket to their fourth consecutive NBA Finals . For James, it\u2019s eight in a row and nine overall, these Cleveland four added to the four he reached with the Heat from 2011-14. It\u2019s a run unprecedented since Bill Russell\u2019s Celtics were winning 11 championships in 13 years, a stranglehold on half of all Finals opportunities this decade. He has a 6-2 record in Game 7 situations, with nothing but triumphs after dropping his first two. \u201cI mean, the bigger the stage, the bigger the player, and he\u2019s been doing it for us since we\u2019ve been here,\u201d Cavs coach Tyronn Lue said. \u201cThe great quote from the great [Clippers coach] Doc Rivers is, \u2018You always want to go into the Game 7 with the best player,\u2019 and we have the best player on our team going into a Game 7. I like our chances. And he delivered again.\u201d Next year at this point, maybe by league proxy, James will have one hand tied behind his back. That\u2019s the next logical step in handicapping him against the field. He has made it to The Finals without his most talented sidekicks. He has taken or dragged along an ever-changing cast of teammates. This time, he did with arguably the Cavaliers\u2019 barest cupboard since first dipping their collective toes in The Finals water back in 2007. Two All-Star point guards, Kyrie Irving (with whom James won a ring in 2016) and Isaiah Thomas (from whom James won his freedom after five awkward weeks), already were long gone when Love went down. And now he was facing elimination with a shaky crew and a huge, inflated question mark hovering over his and Cleveland\u2019s offseason, whenever it comes. Then again, the Celtics were facing him. Like the Raptors, the Pacers, the Bulls, the Hawks and several others before them, Boston well understood the player through whom its playoff ambitions had to go. \u201cI think we\u2019ve played now until May 25th and May 27th the last two years and we started on September 25th. That\u2019s every day,\u201d Boston coach Brad Stevens said about his team\u2019s 2017 and 2018 tangles with Cleveland in the East finals. \u201cEvery day you\u2019re totally focused on this, and he\u2019s gone past that eight straight times. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous. And he does it at this level and with the pressure, with the scrutiny \u2013 doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d Plenty of the foes chasing James when his Finals streak began have headed into retirement ringless and unfulfilled. Others were in high school or grade school. Celtics forward Jayson Tatum, for instance, was 13 years old when James began his streak against Dallas in 2011. There are so many others like Horford, with tire tracks on their backs, no mercy coming their way from James and very little hope on the horizon. At age 33, James played all 82 games in the regular season for the first time in his 15-year career. He made it an even 100 with Sunday\u2019s appearance and he did it with aplomb, staying on the floor for all 48 minutes. \u201cOur goal going into the series was to make him exert as much energy as humanly possible, and try to be as good as we can on everybody else,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cFor the most part, I thought we were pretty good at that. Multiple games now in TD Garden, held them under 100, three games in the 80s \u2013 but he still scored 35. It\u2019s a joke.\u201d James\u2019 stats line \u2013 35 points, 15 rebounds, nine assists \u2013 was enough this time because he got a reasonable amount of help. Three other Cavaliers scored in double figures, including Jeff Green, the journeyman forward who started in Love\u2019s spot. Being one of James\u2019 teammates requires a thick skin for when things don\u2019t go well. It also carries a sense of obligation, to occasionally come through the way Green did in Game 7 (19 points, eight rebounds) given the debt they all owe their resident superstar. \u201cYou want to be there for him,\u201d Green said. \u201cYou want to be in the trenches, in the battle, helping him achieve the ultimate goal. For me, it\u2019s a no-brainer to go out there and give it all I have.\u201d Green was a part of James\u2019 most tumultuous campaign yet, with so many twists and turns \u2013 the shotgun Irving trade, Thomas\u2019 bad fit, a rash of injuries, a desperate reset at the trade deadline and a bumpy learning curve once the new guys arrived \u2013 that James and Lue casually referred to it as \u201cfive seasons\u201d crammed into one. \u201cIt\u2019s now six seasons in one,\u201d James said after midnight. \u201cI guess this is the last chapter for our team in this season. It\u2019s been a whirlwind. I mean, it\u2019s been [a rollercoaster]. It\u2019s been good, it\u2019s been bad, it\u2019s been roses. There have been thorns in the roses. There\u2019s been everything that you can ask for.\u201d For eight years, a conference full of rivals has targeted one player, who happens to be the league\u2019s best, the first among alleged equals with the Heat and clearly the leader when he headed back home to Ohio. In that time, the players have worked, the coaches have schemed and the GMs have plotted. No one has found the answer. None have stopped him. Fact is, nobody\u2019s really laid a glove on him. It\u2019s his conference, seemingly for as long as he wants it. \u201cIt\u2019s been a satisfaction in the fact that I like to be successful,\u201d James said. \u201cBut more importantly, just the work that I put into it. I mean, it\u2019s an every-single-day work ethic that I have while I\u2019m playing this game, while I have the ability to play this game at this level. I love the competition. \u201cI think about the teams that I\u2019ve played over this run and the players that I\u2019ve played over this run, slightly. But more importantly, me just being healthy. I\u2019ve been healthy throughout this run. I put a lot of work into my body, into my craft. Being available to my teammates and being available to my franchise, the two franchises I\u2019ve been with, and throughout this run is what\u2019s been more important to me than anything. Always being available.\u201d It was late. James was weary. Another Game 7 in less than 24 hours would determine his and the Cavaliers\u2019 next playoff challenge. \u201cI\u2019ll be available for at least four more games,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Reputations and images and legacies also can and will be determined in this winner-take-all battle between the Warriors and Rockets. Such is the way of professional sports and instant analysis and fortunes, both teams and players and coaches. That said, here\u2019s what\u2019s on the line for the main figures in Game 7 of the Western Conference finals : He can make a solid case for being the second-best player in the NBA over the past three seasons, having finished top three in Kia MVP voting twice and will perhaps take home the award this season. But LeBron James went to The Finals three times in that span and won once. Harden, on the other hand, doesn\u2019t know what June basketball feels like since he joined the Rockets. He\u2019ll have his best chance Monday. He\u2019ll be on his court, playing before his crowd, 48 minutes away from facing LeBron and the Cavaliers for a championship. If he loses against the Warriors, then Harden will keep the crown as Best Active Player Without A Championship, which isn\u2019t an honor he embraces. With the possibility of playing this game without Chris Paul , Harden might need to explode for 40 points or more. And that still might not be enough. He\u2019s still in his prime, but reaching The Finals, much less winning, isn\u2019t guaranteed to happen. Remember how Oklahoma City was \u201cdestined\u201d to return to The Finals when Harden played there? His championship demons were destroyed last summer when he joined a loaded team and did exactly what everyone expected. Yet Durant didn\u2019t sign up for a one-and-done. The only way to justify leaving OKC is by winning multiple titles. His performance in this series has gone hot and cold. This isn\u2019t the same Durant who tore through everyone last spring and summer; he seems bewildered at times by the Houston defense. If he comes up flat and the Warriors lose, the sensitive Durant might want to stay off social media. Warriors coach Steve Kerr said what everyone feels about Paul and his hamstring injury: It stinks. Paul deserves so much more, especially after such a solid run through the playoffs in every round, including outplaying Steph Curry until the injury. Paul never reached the conference finals until now and at 33 is running out of chances to play for the championship. He\u2019ll become an instant hero in Houston if he pulls a Willis Reed and inspires the Rockets in Game 7, then again if he beats his pal LeBron in The Finals. If not? Then he\u2019ll wonder why the Basketball Gods are against him. A fourth straight trip to The Finals would make Curry the LeBron of the West. He shook himself free from a shooting slump to recover nicely in this series and save the Warriors from elimination in six games. Validation would come finally for D\u2019Antoni should he mastermind a victory over the four All-Star Warriors, especially so should he do it without Paul in Game 7. D\u2019Antoni heard too often about how his offenses weren\u2019t built to last in the postseason but nobody\u2019s saying that now. Anyway, the Rockets employ a far different system than the one he used in Phoenix. Translated: Give him credit for adjusting and cooking up an offense to suit the talents of his players and not vice versa. Also, with the help of lead assistant coach Jeff Bzdelik, the Rockets\u2019 defense is causing plenty of issues for the Warriors this series. Overall, D\u2019Antoni has pushed all the right buttons. Has he already done enough for induction into the Basketball Hall of Fame as a coach just off two championships alone? If not, then a fourth straight trip to The Finals might be the trick. But Kerr hasn\u2019t always convinced his players to remain calm in fourth quarters. Why did the Warriors\u2019 offense suffer costly breakdowns in Games 4 and 5? Yes, Houston\u2019s defense rose up, but adjustments by Golden State were slow to come, if at all. He\u2019s officially out for Game 7 and if the Warriors advance, you wonder if he\u2019ll be ready for another shot at LeBron. The Warriors gave him a nice contract extension here in his twilight because of what he means to them in spring and summer. They could use his on-court leadership. The Warriors are still looking for a breakout game in this series from their emotional leader. It\u2019s not that Green has been a ghost; rather, he just hasn\u2019t stood out in the small lineup or made his presence known in a big way, other than with the referees (as usual). It would help if Green began hitting those open 3-pointers the Rockets are generously giving him. Often celebrated as one of the top general managers in the game, Morey built this Rockets team with beating the Warriors in mind. He traded for Paul and signed P.J. Tucker last summer, and those two have repaid that faith with solid playoff performances. How many more times must Morey tweak the Rockets here in the Harden era before Houston finally strikes gold. For his sake, hopefully, this was the final time. But again, much depends on Paul\u2019s hamstring. Sometimes, the fate of your team is beyond your control. Sometimes, you need luck. This city endured a deadly flood, then lifted itself with the help of ordinary citizens and a handful of local athletes and celebrities, then celebrated its first World Series triumph courtesy of the Astros. For the last several months, therefore, Houston has been in the headlines, and would like to add another late Monday night. * * * Veteran NBA writer Shaun Powell has worked for newspapers and other publications for more than 25 years.

So what else is new? OK, so this time there is a difference. LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers are back facing not merely an unwelcoming attitude but a personnel crisis. Kevin Love, All-Star forward and the Cavs\u2019 generally acceded second-best player since Kyrie Irving switched sides in this heated Eastern Conference rivalry, was placed in the NBA\u2019s concussion protocol Saturday and has been ruled out of Game 7 of the East finals Sunday night at TD Garden ( 8:30 ET, ESPN ). On paper, stripping away Cleveland\u2019s top rebounder (9.8 per game) and second-leading scorer (12.5) from an elimination game would seem to deal a severe blow to his team\u2019s shot at winning and reaching a fourth consecutive NBA Finals. On parquet, maybe not so much. Love shot 37.5 percent overall and made only seven of his 26 3-point attempts in the series\u2019 first six games. Per NBA.com\/stats , he had a net rating of minus-7.4, the amount by which Cleveland has been outscored by Boston per 100 possessions. From the timeout that followed Love\u2019s head-to-head collision with Boston forward Jayson Tatum to the game\u2019s end three-and-a-half quarters later, the Cavaliers outscored the Celtics 103-89. It would be folly to suggest that not having Love long term would be a gain for Cleveland or any other team for which he might play. But short term? There were signs in Game 6 Friday that Love being held out from Game 7 might be a net gain for the Cavaliers at both ends of the court. Once the 6-foot-10 power forward headed back to the locker room at Quicken Loans Arena, coach Tyronn Lue\u2019s player rotation and tactics changed. Backup forward Jeff Green, who had averaged 22.6 minutes and 5.6 points in the first five games, logged 31 and scored 14 Friday. Green will start in place of Love in Game 7 on Sunday. Larry Nance, another backup, scored 10 points with seven rebounds, including 6 and 4 in the fourth quarter. Point guard George Hill, aware that his role in the offense suddenly had been dialed up, responded by scoring 20 points. His backup, Jordan Clarkson, had been a cipher in the series but chipped in six points and five rebounds. Defensively, where Love\u2019s lack of quickness undercuts his want-to, the Cavaliers were more mobile and capable of switching assignments or double-teaming and covering for it. The Celtics tried to attack Love whenever they can, which is why Lue turned to Tristan Thompson as the guy to cover and slow Boston\u2019s playmaking big, Al Horford. Now, no individual Cavs defender has a target on his back like that. That\u2019s a challenge for Celtics coach Brad Stevens and his staff. For a sense of how this all might play out in Game 7, NBA.com talked with a veteran advance scout and a longtime assistant coach about what they anticipated with Love out. Here is the coach\u2019s assessment: Cleveland won big in Boston in February, 121-99 , when Love was out with a fractured hand. Otherwise the Cavs were 12-10 in games Love missed. The strict home-and-home adherence of this series and the Celtics\u2019 10-0 mark at the Garden this postseason may matter little, set against the Game 7 backdrop. Here is the scout\u2019s report: James has a personal mark of 6-2 in Game 7s, and the most recent time he tackled one on the road was at the end of the 2016 Finals. He won that one, but with Irving making the clutch shot and Love standing strong late in a defensive stop of Steph Curry. Those guys will be in street clothes and of no value at all this time, replaced by helpers of lesser repute. Someone might, someone might not. Doesn\u2019t change the fact that the onus is on \u201cthat guy.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t put too much added pressure on myself,\u201d said James, who already has scored 40 points or more in seven of the Cavaliers\u2019 17 playoff games, including two buzzer-beaters. \u201cI know what I\u2019m capable of doing, and I\u2019m going to trust everything I put into it.\u201d * * *"},{"id":40295,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/toronto-raptors-ettore-messina-ime-udoka","date":"2018-05-27","title":"Report: Raptors to interview Spurs assistant coaches Ettore Messina and Ime Udoka","content":" All is quiet on the Kawhi Leonard front in San Antonio.

This is the route the GPS mapped out back in October and never had any reason to recalculate from since. Warriors at Rockets in a winner-take-all . Never in doubt, no? A pair of championship-quality teams will go 48 minutes and the previous six games in this series tells us to expect a tense jump ball-to-buzzer affair. With or without Chris Paul. Paul\u2019s inflamed right hamstring is a significant flaw, no question, yet the Rockets do have home-court advantage and will hear a crazed crowd trying to fill the void with noise if as expected Paul misses a second straight game. The Rockets didn\u2019t have their point guard and spiritual leader Saturday and still sent an early chill through the defending champions on enemy soil, going up 17 after the first quarter and 10 at halftime. Oracle Arena and the Warriors were confused. Then Game 6 flipped suddenly and drastically in the second half, as the Warriors rolled to a 115-86 victory . and here we are. Rockets coach Mike D\u2019Antoni: \u201cWe got what we want, a seventh game on our home court, now it\u2019s up to us to go get it.\u201d Warriors guard Klay Thompson said: \u201cI feel like we\u2019re the best team in the world.\u201d The Rockets constructed this team specifically to challenge and beat the Warriors. Meanwhile, the Warriors paced themselves through the regular season partly to conserve their attention and energy for Houston, which has Golden State\u2019s attention like no team before in the West playoffs. \u2022 Complete coverage of Western Conference finals Both are causing each other irritating problems. The Rockets\u2019 defense with its switching and hand-in-the-face pressure is forcing Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry to work hard for their shots. The Warriors\u2019 ability to thrive even if not all four of their All-Stars are clicking is testing Houston\u2019s limits; such was the case in Game 6 when Thompson, the No. 3 Guy, broke loose for 35 points with nine threes. That\u2019s what makes the Warriors tough to erase: They don\u2019t need to be perfect, and good for them, because they haven\u2019t been in this series, with the exception of their 41-point victory in Game 3. About Thompson: He was locked in, emotionally and physically, popping off screens, catching and shooting, creating space to get good looks and punching the air after big 3s. The energy and the shots saved the Warriors from a lackluster and potentially deadly start. Thompson stayed in rhythm most of the night while Curry (29 points) and Durant (23) went through off-and-on cold stretches and afterward joked how he was \u201cborn\u201d for this. \u201cMan, that felt good, to be honest,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cI just wanted to play with as much passion as I could. I probably sounded more vocal than I am.\u201d There was a natural link to the last time Thompson was this splashy in a Game 6 elimination game, two summers ago when he dropped 41 on Oklahoma City to trigger a comeback from 3-1 down. Durant was on the wrong side of that performance. \u201cPlease don\u2019t go there,\u201d begged Durant, bowing his head. \u201cNext question.\u201d Mindful of what happened right after that series \u2014 the Warriors would blow a 3-1 lead of their own to Cleveland \u2014 Curry said: \u201cI think we both blocked that whole year out of our memory.\u201d Actually, that volcanic performance by Thompson helped convince Durant to leave Oklahoma City, which led to last year\u2019s championship and helped build a solid case for the Warriors to repeat next month. Thompson\u2019s latest piece of work helped awaken the Warriors from being trapped in an extended state of stun, courtesy of how fierce the Rockets came at them right from the start. The Houston lead grew to double digits within minutes and stayed that way through the break. This was further evidence that the Rockets, in this game and actually for the series so far, refuse to concede anything and believe this West title is realistic even with Paul\u2019s status uncertain. \u201cI saw a lot of things that I liked,\u201d said D\u2019Antoni, \u201cand I think we\u2019re in a good position.\u201d Eric Gordon, a strong candidate to win the Kia NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award, started in place of Paul and was a concern for the Warriors, drilling deep shots and scoring 19 points. Also, Harden rediscovered his own touch from that distance; he\u2019d missed 22 straight threes in this series but made four and scored 32 points. Houston missed Paul\u2019s composure and steady point guard hand, which could be expected. The Rockets had 22 turnovers, with the Harden-Gordon backcourt combining for 14. The other issue for the Rockets was depth. With Gordon in the starting lineup, D\u2019Antoni was forced to give minutes to Luc Mbah a Moute, still struggling after hurting his shoulder just prior to the playoffs. He wasn\u2019t a factor and neither was the bench. Assuming Paul sits another game, the Rockets will undoubtedly need major scoring and playmaking from Harden, solid shotgun work from Gordon and at least two members of the support group \u2014 Trevor Ariza, P.J. Tucker, Clint Capela \u2014 to break loose in order to make Game 7 interesting. Remember, the Rockets have now gone four straight games without breaking 100 points, and Harden appeared beaten in the fourth quarter Saturday where he went scoreless. The Warriors are also dealing with a missing part, with Andre Iguodala\u2019s inactive streak now at three. They\u2019re crossing fingers whenever Kevon Looney, Jordan Bell and\/or Nick Young are pressed to play more than 15 minutes. None of them have distinguished themselves since Iguodala suffered a bone bruise on his left knee in Game 3. So that\u2019s the tale of the tape. Between now and tipoff, the Rockets\u2019 therapy staff will work on Paul\u2019s hamstring, hoping for some intervention from the Medical Gods. In the perfect basketball world, Paul and Iguodala would be fit to play; why should the finish of this series be deprived of them, of less than what it should be? Last fall, before training camp, Paul, Harden and Tucker vacationed in the Bahamas for one last moment of chill before preparations for a season of big expectations. Obviously, they talked shop. They set goals and their sights on the Warriors. Tucker asked Paul and Harden: Imagine if we get them on our court for a Game 7. They all nodded and agreed it would be a logical scenario to launch themselves into the NBA Finals. \u201cObviously we hope to have our starting point guard back,\u201d Tucker said. \u201cIf not, we need to be ready.\u201d The Warriors held no such pre-camp huddle \u2014 champions have what others want \u2014 yet knew that once the Rockets added Paul, Houston would be their toughest test since Durant signed up. Warriors vs. Rockets in a single-game elimination is the proper stage, then, to determine who reps the West in the NBA Finals. D\u2019Antoni said: \u201cIt should be a great game.\u201d Curry: \u201cIt should be fun. This is what you play for, to be in a situation where you\u2019re one win away from going to The Finals. You\u2019ve got to want it.\u201d Truthfully, neither team would rather be in a winner-take-all. Sweeping would be vastly preferred. But the other part about what Curry said is definitely true: Who wants it? * * * Veteran NBA writer Shaun Powell has worked for newspapers and other publications for more than 25 years.

I hate to see Kevin Love last night, Kyrie [Irving]. These guys train so hard and they\u2019re here and they\u2019re competing, and you want everybody to be healthy, but just the reality is it usually doesn\u2019t work out that way.

Love was placed in the NBA\u2019s concussion protocol and the All-Star forward will miss Sunday\u2019s series finale of the Eastern Conference finals, a personal blow and yet another challenge for Cleveland to overcome. The Cavaliers said Love, who inadvertently bashed heads with Celtics rookie Jayson Tatum in the first quarter of Game 6, experienced concussion-like symptoms Saturday before the team\u2019s flight to Boston. Moments before the Cavs sent a news release updating Love\u2019s status, coach Tyronn Lue held a confusing teleconference during which he said the 29-year-old was still being evaluated and there was a possibility he could play. However, like everything else in this erratic, convoluted season for Cleveland, things changed quickly. Now, the Cavs will be without their second-leading scorer and top rebounder as they try to win their fourth straight conference title against a younger team that is 10-0 at home in the playoffs. \u2022 Complete coverage of Eastern Conference finals Love is averaging 13.9 points and 10.0 rebounds in 17 playoff starts, and he\u2019s the No. 2 scoring option for the Cavs, who have leaned on James harder than ever this postseason. Celtics coach Brad Stevens believes the Cavaliers are dangerous even without Love. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to prepare our team to play well, regardless of who plays for them,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cObviously, they\u2019ll run a little bit less of the Love stuff, and more of the other stuff \u2026 probably more opportunities for LeBron, more opportunities for [Kyle] Korver and [JR] Smith, more opportunities off those pick and rolls. All of them were very effective for them last night.\u201d There is statistical data to support that the Cavaliers have been more effective in the series when Love has been out. But while Cleveland may be better defensively, Love\u2019s shot-making ability helps the Cavs spread the floor and open driving lanes for James. \u201cYou can switch more,\u201d Lue said. \u201cI think when Jeff [Green] is in there playing that position, it makes you more versatile defensively. But we miss his rebounding. We miss his offensive ability. It kind of all cancels out.\u201d James scored 46 points in Friday\u2019s victory, his latest jaw-dropping performance in what has been perhaps the greatest postseason of the superstar\u2019s storied career. James is averaging 33.9 points, 8.9 rebounds and 8.8 assists and has had seven 40-point games and two-buzzer beaters. The 33-year-old\u2019s next challenge: finding a way to beat the Celtics, who have played at another level on their home floor. It\u2019s interesting that as James tries to advance to his eighth straight NBA Finals \u2014 a feat accomplished only by legendary Celtics center Bill Russell and three other Boston players \u2014 that Love will be in street clothes on Cleveland\u2019s bench and Kyrie Irving will be sitting on Boston\u2019s. The Cavs relented to Irving\u2019s request and traded him to the Celtics last summer, but the All-Star point guard didn\u2019t play in this postseason after undergoing knee surgery. At one time, James, Irving and Love comprised Cleveland\u2019s \u201cBig 3,\u201d a power trio that won an NBA championship together and went to three straight Finals before fracturing. After Love went down Friday, James, who played the final eight minutes on a sore right knee, got help from George Hill (20 points), Green (14 points) and Larry Nance Jr. (10 points) as the Cavaliers fought off elimination for the second time in these playoffs. Lue said he wasn\u2019t concerned about James, who favored his leg while slowly walking out of Quicken Loans Arena early Saturday after Game 6. For Love, the concussion is another setback in a tough season. He missed seven weeks with a broken hand and revealed he has had bouts of panic attacks. Love has suffered at least two other known concussions in his career \u2014 one that kept him out of Game 3 in the 2016 NBA Finals. He also missed a game at Charlotte on March 28 with a head injury. Love missed the majority of Cleveland\u2019s 2015 run to the Finals after separating his shoulder in the first round against Boston."},{"id":40347,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/versatile-jacob-evans-could-be-perfect-fit-position-less-nba","date":"2018-05-26","title":"Versatile and driven Jacob Evans could be perfect fit for today's position-less NBA","content":"A friend of Cincinnati associate head coach Larry Davis called one day in 2014 to tell him about a player in Louisiana that had been somehow overlooked by power conference schools, even though he played practically in LSU\u2019s backyard. \u201cYou need to go check him out,\u201d Davis\u2019 friend said. As soon as the NCAA\u2019s summer recruiting period opened, Davis traveled to Myrtle Beach, S.C., where he first laid eyes on Jacob Evans, a Baton Rouge native who was playing for a small AAU team, the kind that doesn\u2019t get offered shoe deals. Within a couple of minutes, Davis, who has been a college assistant and head coach for 35 years, knew the 6-foot-5 Evans could play. Then Davis glanced around the stands to see what other coaches from upper echelon Division I schools were watching the kid. \u201cI\u2019m looking around and I\u2019m thinking to myself, there should be a lot of [other coaches] here,\u201d Davis says. \u201cAnd I\u2019m glad there\u2019s not.\u201d When Davis got back to Cincinnati, he spent time on the phone with Evans\u2019 mother and high school coach, his two closest advisors. The picture they painted of the hard-working, humble Evans intrigued Davis even more, so the next weekend he went New Orleans, where Evans\u2019 AAU team had put on a tournament of its own. That\u2019s when Davis decided to get his boss, Mick Cronin involved. \u201cI called Mick and said this dude can really play,\u201d Davis says. \u201cWe need him.\u201d The first thing that stood out to Davis was Evans\u2019 shooting ability and size. Evans could play and guard all three perimeter positions \u2014 another huge plus. The fact Evans was lightly recruited didn\u2019t bother Davis a bit. \u201cOur thing is we try to get kids who are under recruited, have a little chip on their shoulder, and want to compete and get better,\u201d Davis says. Evans checked off all those boxes. The next weekend, Davis brought Cronin with him to an AAU tournament in Las Vegas, where Evans was again playing. \u201cTwo minutes in, Mick looked at me and says, \u2018can we get this guy?\u2019 \u201d Davis says. \u201cHe was just nervous looking at all the different coaches who were walking in and out of the gym.\u201d As it turned out, Cincinnati could get Evans, though by the latter stages of his recruitment, South Carolina and Auburn were also involved. By that time, it was too late. Davis had built a relationship. Just as Davis and later Cronin suspected, Evans epitomized the typical Cincinnati player. \u201cI kind of saw myself as an underdog,\u201d Evans says. \u201cI didn\u2019t have the hype behind my name. From the day I got on campus, the coaches made sure I worked hard every day, as hard as I could, controlling what I can control. What you put into this game is what you get out. You can never be a perfect basketball player, and you can never be satisfied.\u201d Four years after Davis first saw Evans, the latter is still a bit of an underdog, though after receiving assurances from some NBA teams that he wouldn\u2019t fall out of the first round of the Draft, he gave up his final season of eligibility and is ready for the challenges ahead. The last two years, Evans helped lead Cincinnati to a 61-11 record as he played shooting guard, small forward, occasionally the point. Cronin and his staff taught Evans to defend any position, even the post. The player that evolved is perfect for today\u2019s position-less NBA. \u201cI know right now I can knock down shots and play great defense,\u201d Evans says. \u201cThat\u2019ll help me get my feet wet. Then I\u2019ll start working off the dribble more than a lot of teams have seen me do. And just because I played off the ball a lot at Cincinnati, I grew up playing point guard. As I get older, there\u2019s a lot more I can show.\u201d Evans has chosen his role models wisely. The first was his mother, who raised three boys by herself. \u201cWe never lacked for shoes or clothes or food,\u201d Evans says. \u201cWe\u2019d see her go to work in the dark and come home at dark. That\u2019s how hard she worked. She drilled the value of that into us without ever really talking about it. She taught us not to settle.\u201d Evans also admires Jimmy Butler, who played at Marquette, squeezed into the first round of the 2011 Draft (No. 30 by the Chicago Bulls) and became an All-Star. \u201cHe\u2019s a guy I compare myself to,\u201d Evans says. \u201cHe was the 30th pick in the draft, came into the league and worked his butt off. Now he\u2019s seen as one of the best two-way players in the game.\u201d Evans has a similar work ethic, and he\u2019s also got toughness going for him. During a February game against UCF, he brushed up against a player he was guarding and the index finger of his right (shooting) hand got bent backward. At the time, he was shooting 41 percent from 3. He shot 28 percent after that, but he never even considered coming out of the lineup. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to let my team down,\u201d Evans said. \u201cAt the time, we were trying to put ourselves in the best situation we could to earn a high seed in the NCAA Tournament and win a national championship. Our trainers tried to tape it, but I didn\u2019t like that. I didn\u2019t get a shot or really any pain medication. I just kind of gutted it out, mentally and physically fighting through the pain.\u201d That guy, says the coach who first spotted him in Myrtle Beach, is someone every NBA team should want on its roster. \u201cHe\u2019s the real deal when it comes to versatility,\u201d Davis says \u201cHe\u2019s not Kyle Korver as a shooter. He\u2019s not Kyrie Irving as a scorer. He\u2019s not as good as those guys at either one of those things, but he\u2019s pretty good at both. I tell scouts all the time, he can play one, two or three, and guard them, too. If he gets switched off onto a four, he can fight them off. He\u2019s got ball skills, and in 35 years of doing this, he might be in the top three guys I\u2019ve had in terms of intelligence. He\u2019s off the charts.\u201d With that praise, Davis doesn\u2019t mean to suggest he sees a utility-man, reserve kind of role for Evans. Neither does Evans. \u201cMy goal is to become an All-Star,\u201d Evans says. \u201cNot just a role player. I\u2019m willing to do whatever it takes to get there.\u201d * * * Chris Dortch is the editor of the Blue Ribbon College Basketball Yearbook .

In Game 3 of the Eastern Conference finals , the Celtics trailed 32-17 after the first quarter. Game 4: 34-18. And in neither game did they cut the deficit to less than seven points thereafter. So, heading into Game 6, with an extra level of desperation in the Cleveland Cavaliers facing elimination, there was an obvious \u201csurvive the first quarter\u201d thought from pundits as priority No. 1 for the Celtics. And they did it. The Celtics scored 11 points on the last five possessions of the period to close it with a 25-20 lead. They survived the first quarter, but they did not survive the second. And after a 109-99 Cavs victory on Friday, the series is heading back to Boston for a deciding Game 7 on Sunday ( 8:30 ET, ESPN ). A 25-point quarter isn\u2019t huge, but in what was a very slow-paced game (89 possessions for each team), it was efficient. The Celtics went to Al Horford in the post eight times in the opening 12 minutes and the Cavs mostly sent an extra defender at Horford, which seemed to play into the Celtics\u2019 hands. Horford surveyed the floor, his teammates moved without the ball, and the results were generally good. The first Horford post-up was on the Celtics\u2019 second possession. LeBron James joined Tristan Thompson for the double-team and the ball swung to Terry Rozier, who got into the paint and found Jaylen Brown for a corner three. A few minutes later, there was no double-team, but Horford found Brown cutting to the basket for an and-one. Midway through the first, a double-team on Horford resulted in a short jumper for Marcus Morris. Later, Horford found Marcus Smart on a cut, and Smart made a brilliant pass out for another corner three from Brown. On the next possession, Brown snuck behind Kyle Korver on the baseline for a layup. The Celtics didn\u2019t score on all those Horford post-ups, but the eight in the first quarter produced 12 points on good shots. Horford didn\u2019t score a single point in the first, but having the offense run through him generated a strong quarter on the road against a desperate opponent. \u201cI thought our spacing was excellent,\u201d Celtics coach Brad Stevens said of the early execution. \u201cThe way we moved it out of the double.\u201d The Celtics had a lead after the first quarter and Kevin Love was done for the night after a collision with Jayson Tatum. The door was open for the Celtics to put their postseason road woes behind them and close the series out. Horford was off the floor to start the second quarter, and the Celtics took their foot off the gas. They scored five points on their first three possessions of the period, but the shots weren\u2019t good and the ball didn\u2019t get into the paint until possession No. 7. Smart took an ill-advised 3-pointer and then looked confused when Morris did the same on the very next possession. \u201cWe missed some opportunities,\u201d Stevens said about the second quarter. \u201cBut I thought we also just got lax a little bit offensively. When we get lax offensively, we open up transition opportunities for them, and that\u2019s a problem.\u201d The Celtics couldn\u2019t recapture their first-quarter rhythm, they didn\u2019t get Horford in the post once in the second quarter, and a 20-4 Cleveland run was ultimately the difference in the game. \u201cWe stopped getting the ball inside,\u201d Rozier said. \u201cThe second quarter definitely killed us today.\u201d James had himself one of those nights, shooting 10-for-17 from outside the paint (where Boston wants him shooting from) on his way to 46 points . He finished the Celtics off with two ridiculous, step-back threes from the left wing. \u201cHats off,\u201d Stevens said of the daggers. \u201cThe first one, that was ridiculous.\u201d The Cavs scored 89 points on just 67 possessions (1.33 points per possession) after the first quarter and the Celtics couldn\u2019t keep up. They didn\u2019t try to get Horford in the post nearly as much in the second half as they did in the first quarter. \u201cWe weren\u2019t looking for them as much as we were earlier,\u201d Horford said of the post-up opportunities. A few post-ups did result in free throws, but the Celtics left some points at the line, shooting 11-for-20. \u201cThe question about did we go to him enough, probably a good question,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cAnd one that when we review it, we\u2019ll look at it and figure out if we need to do more.\u201d If you asked the Celtics at the beginning of the postseason if they\u2019d like to have one game on the floor for a trip to The Finals, they\u2019d surely have accepted it. \u201cIt\u2019s an absolute blast to prepare for as a coach,\u201d Stevens said of Game 7, \u201cand to play in as a player.\u201d But the Celtics may have let one get away on Friday, and though they\u2019re 10-0 at home in these playoffs, anything can happen in a Game 7, especially with the best player in the world on the other side. James has won the last five Game 7s that he\u2019s played in and scored 45 points in Game 7 against Indiana in the first round. Maybe he doesn\u2019t shoot so well from the outside on Sunday, but maybe he does. Maybe the Celtics shouldn\u2019t even be here, given that they\u2019re missing two of their three best players. But they\u2019ve made it this far, and they\u2019d best keep their foot on the gas on Sunday. * * * John Schuhmann is a staff writer for NBA.com.

James took his seat with the idea of resting as much as he could, as quickly as he could. That\u2019s about all he gets this time of year, when subbing James out of the game too often is like the Cavaliers loosening their grip on a balloon they\u2019re blowing up but have yet to tie off. If the air went out of Cleveland\u2019s balloon at Quicken Loans Arena, it was going to be out for months. Heck, given James\u2019 possible departure in free agency this summer, the air might have been gone for good. \u201cObviously [if] I get a minute, couple minutes here per quarter, would be great. But it\u2019s not what our team is built on right now,\u201d James said after yet another remarkable performance to keep the Cavs\u2019 postseason alive. With what was left of the third on the game clock and how it played out, followed by the break between quarters, the Cavaliers\u2019 star got about five minutes in real time to catch his breath. Then promptly subbed back in for the fourth. \u201cOur team is built on me being out on the floor to be able to make plays, not only for myself but make plays for others,\u201d James said. \u201cIt\u2019s just the way we\u2019ve been playing, and we\u2019ve been succeeding with it. \u201cI was able to play 46 minutes today. I got my couple minutes, I guess.\u201d He got another 57 seconds to be exact. They were less hurried, less nervous and absolutely earned, coming as they did at the very end. When James exited for good, his work was done. The Cavs had pushed this home-dominant series to its max, with Game 7 at Boston\u2019s TD Garden Sunday (8:30 p.m. ET, ABC). James\u2019 stats line was one of those gaudy\/ordinary types he has spoiled his team and NBA fans with for so many years: 46 points, 11 rebounds and nine assists. He also had three steals and one blocked shot, racing back in the third quarter to deny Boston\u2019s greyhound guard Terry Rozier after finishing a Cavs fast break an instant before. James went down as if shot early in the fourth, his team up 89-82; teammate Larry Nance fell into the future Hall of Famer\u2019s right leg. But after a few tentative, anxious moments both for him and the folks in the arena, James was back to moving, pivoting and launching as if nothing had happened. \u201cI felt some pain throughout my entire right side of my ankle into my leg,\u201d said James, who seems to go through more histrionics and drama than the average player when he gets clobbered, without enduring the same level of injury. \u201cI was just hoping for the best, obviously, because I\u2019ve seen so many different injuries, and watching basketball with that type of injury, someone fall into one\u2019s leg standing straight up.\u201d Not long after that, though, James was draining two Back Bay-breaking 3-pointers on consecutive trips, burning young Celtics forward Jayson Tatum both times from deep on the left wing. The second sent Boston scurrying into a timeout with 1:40 to go, and had James going a little primal along that far sideline, pounding his chest and hollering out. \u201cThe love of the game causes reactions like that,\u201d James said. \u201cUnderstanding the situation and understanding the moment that you\u2019re in. It was just a feeling that you can\u2019t explain unless you\u2019ve been a part of it.\u201d James has been a part of it plenty. This was the 22nd elimination game of his career, his eighth since returning to Cleveland in 2014. He is 13-9 overall and 6-2 in this Cavs 2.0 version. His production in these win-or-go-home games is unsurpassed in NBA history. James is averaging 34.1 points, 10.8 rebounds and 7.4 assists, performing best when it matters most. That wasn\u2019t always the case \u2013 James had some rough-shooting, high-turnover nights in elimination games early in his career. More recently, though, he\u2019s everything you want but cannot get in a mutual fund: His past performances definitely are a guarantee of future results. \u201cI\u2019ve watched him play a lot of really great games, but that one\u2019s right up there towards the top,\u201d said Kyle Korver, Cleveland\u2019s 37-year-old sniper. \u201cIt\u2019s just so much heart. He wanted this game so bad. \u201cI think he just craves those moments. He loves those moments. When the game is on the line, when the season is on the line, he\u2019s just been rising up, and that\u2019s what the great players do.\u201d Iconic players like James and, before him, Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant are the ones who block whole NBA generations from achieving their dreams, hoarding Finals appearances and championship rings for them and theirs only. Celtics Brad Stevens, young as he is, has had to gameplan against James\u2019 greatness and ability to dominate three times in playoff series now. \u201cDoes that ever come into our minds? Yeah, every time we watch,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cEvery time you\u2019re standing out there. Every time you watch him on film. Best player in the game. Special night tonight and special night in Game 4 [44 points]. I can\u2019t say enough good things about him.\u201d At least one of James\u2019 own teammates didn\u2019t always feel that way. \u201cI\u2019ve been in the league for some years and ran across him on the other side and really hated his guts,\u201d said George Hill, the former Indiana Pacers guard who never beat James in postseason basketball before joining him via trade in February. \u201cBut to have him on our side, it kind of lets me take a deep breath of fresh air. It\u2019s just something that you really can\u2019t explain what he\u2019s doing night in, night out.\u201d The view from the Cavaliers\u2019 side isn\u2019t just safer, it\u2019s illuminating for George. \u201cY eah, I thought the best was when he always put us out,\u201d the veteran said. \u201cBut to actually see it when he\u2019s on your team, I can\u2019t even put it into words. Sometimes I just think, \u2018How did he make that shot?\u2019 Or \u2018How did he make that move?\u2019 Or \u2018When did he see that pass?\u2019 Just making big plays and big shots. People always list him as not a shooter, but he\u2019s making big shots down the stretch. If it\u2019s 3-pointers, layups, dunks, passes, he can do it all.\u201d James wasn\u2019t always so complete as a player. In some of his early forays into the playoffs, critics would pounce. Passing off a potential winning shot, for example, to less-decorated teammate Donyell Marshall. Getting ousted by a savvier, saltier Celtics crew in seven games in 2008 and in six two years later. A couple years after that, though, James would return the favor with his new crew in Miami. He dropped 45 points with 15 rebounds on Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett, Ray Allen and the rest right on the hallowed parquet in Game 6, then backed it up with 31 in Game 7. Now he\u2019s tormenting a whole new set of Celtics. \u201cLike I said, I haven\u2019t always done it in my whole career, but I\u2019ve never shied away from it,\u201d James said. \u201cThat\u2019s either making a shot or making a play. I was taught the game the right way ever since I started playing.\u201d So it\u2019s talent to start, fundamentals ladled onto that and then time and experience to percolate, to ferment, to ripen James into what he is now: No one to be trifled with when there\u2019s something to be won or to be staved off. Getting a little more introspective than usual, James talked about the maturation journey he has taken since arriving on the NBA scene still a teenager in 2003. \u201cI\u2019ve embraced a lot of situations as you grow up,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, I love being a husband now. Did I embrace that at 18, 19? I don\u2019t think so. \u201cAs you get older, you just grow into more things. I didn\u2019t love wine until I was 30 years old, and now every other [social media] post is about wine, National Wine Day. So you learn and you grow and you know what\u2019s best for you as you get older. That\u2019s just all of us.

The Cavaliers All-Star forward may have to sit out Game 7 of the Eastern Conference finals after injuring his head Friday night during the first quarter of Cleveland\u2019s 109-99 win over the Boston Celtics. Love was kept out of the second half of Game 6 following his violent collision with Celtics rookie Jayson Tatum. Cleveland\u2019s medical staff checked Love for a concussion, and the team announced at halftime the 29-year-old would not return to the game as a precaution. Love has not been placed in concussion protocol, but that could change if he has an onset of symptoms \u2013 headaches, dizziness, sensitivity to light \u2013 in the hours ahead. He will be re-examined Saturday before the team flies to Boston. Cavs coach Tyronn Lue did not know if he would have his second-best player for the season\u2019s biggest game as the Cavs try to win their fourth straight conference title. Following Game 6, Love told a reporter it was \u201da toss-up\u201d whether he would be able to face the Celtics. Love is Cleveland\u2019s most reliable scoring option after LeBron James, who scored 46 points in another tour-de-force performance in Game 6 \u2013 possibly his last home game with the Cavs. James, too, is hurting. Teammate Larry Nance Jr. fell into James\u2019 right leg in the fourth quarter, and the three-time champion said there was a moment when he feared his injury was serious. \u201dI felt some pain throughout my entire right side of my ankle into my leg,\u201d said James, who played 46 of 48 minutes. \u201dI was just hoping for the best, obviously, because I\u2019ve seen so many different injuries, and watching basketball with that type of injury, someone fall into one\u2019s leg standing straight up. Luckily, I was able to finish the game.\u201d James doesn\u2019t have much time to recover, and sleep will be imperative. \u201dIt\u2019ll be around-the-clock treatment, and we\u2019ll see what happens,\u201d he said. James walked slowly, almost shuffling his feet as he left Quicken Loans Arena early Saturday morning. Love and Tatum inadvertently collided midway through the quarter and both immediately dropped to the floor. Love, who has a history with concussions, raised his left arm as if to signal he needed help. He stayed down for several minutes and sat rubbing his head before he was pulled to his feet. Love walked unsteadily to the bench with guard George Hill holding one of his arms. He spent a few moments on the bench before heading to the locker room for further evaluation. Love didn\u2019t score and had five rebounds before getting hurt. Tatum was checked on the bench and stayed in the game. \u201dI didn\u2019t see him coming, it was bad,\u201d Tatum said. \u201dI have a knot on the back of my head, I should be all right. I wish the best for Kevin Love because he\u2019s a great player, and it\u2019s been a long season.\u201d The Cavs appeared to be in big trouble when he went out in Game 6, but Cleveland got 20 points from Hill, 14 from Jeff Green and 10 from Larry Nance Jr. to offset losing Love. \u201dVery encouraging,\u201d Lue said of the contributions. \u201dI think when you lose an All-Star like Kevin and our second go-to guy, pivotal part of what we try to do, and when he goes down and then you help your brother up, that\u2019s what they did. Kevin left the game. He didn\u2019t come back, and guys got together and they played. They played for Kevin. They played for each other and were able to get the win.\u201d For Love, who missed most of the 2015 playoffs with a separated shoulder, the head injury is the latest blow in what has been a challenging few months. In March, he disclosed that he had suffered a panic attack during a game in November, and he experienced a similar episode in January. Following the second incident, several players challenged Love in a team meeting that came shortly after he had left that game and missed a subsequent practice. Love, who has suffered at least two prior concussions, was also sidelined seven weeks with a broken left hand. He\u2019s had a fairly steady 2018 postseason, averaging 14.8 points and 10.4 rebounds but his critics have often insisted he should be doing more. Now he may not be able to do anything."},{"id":40355,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/most-intriguing-free-agents-2018","date":"2018-05-25","title":"The 10 most intriguing free agents this summer","content":" * 2018 Free Agent Tracker The summer of 2018 promises to change the landscape of the NBA. It starts with the best player in the world having the ability to choose his next team, but it continues with good teams in Minnesota, Portland and Washington that might feel the need to shake things up, as well as a situation to monitor in San Antonio. The trade market can be unpredictable. It wasn\u2019t until late July last year that we learned that Kyrie Irving wanted out of Cleveland, and it wasn\u2019t until late August when he was dealt to the Boston Celtics, who finished the summer with only four players remaining from the team that reached the conference finals. The free agent market is a little more predictable, in that there are only so many teams with the available cap space to sign a premium free agent outright. Most of the big contracts signed in 2016 (when almost every team had cap space) are still on the books and a lot of teams just don\u2019t have much flexibility. But the trade market and the free agent market are tied together. In 2014, the Cavs created the space to sign LeBron James by trading Jarrett Jack and Tyler Zeller. And after signing James, they traded for Kevin Love. With that in mind, the players listed below aren\u2019t the 10 best free agents (or potential free agents). They\u2019re the 10 most interesting in regard to where they\u2019re going and what kind of contract they get. For players to be on this list, there needs to be some intrigue regarding their (and\/or their team\u2019s) decision this summer. Kevin Durant is the second best player in the NBA and has a player option on his contract, but there appears to be little chance that he\u2019s leaving the Golden State Warriors. Re-signing with Houston is probably Chris Paul\u2019s best path to another year of contention. It\u2019s hard to see Clint Capela or Jusuf Nurkic (both restricted as well) going anywhere. The same goes (to a lesser degree) for Aaron Gordon and Fred VanVleet. There\u2019s intrigue in the terms under which Nikola Jokic is in Denver next season \u2013 either with the Nuggets exercising a $1.6 million team option or declining it, making him a restricted free agent, and signing him to a new deal \u2013 but we can be sure that he will be in Denver next season. The market for centers seems particularly small, taking away some of the intrigue with DeAndre Jordan and Brook Lopez. At 33 years old and in his 15th season, James remains the best player in the world. Would he leave Cleveland a second time? This is clearly the worst team he\u2019s been on since the first time he left the Cavs, and there are teams out there who can give him a better secondary playmaker to take some of the offensive load off his shoulders. Whatever team he\u2019s on next season is a contender and if if it\u2019s a different team than the one he\u2019s on now, it would be fascinating to see what happens with Love. Number to know: James\u2019 true shooting percentage of 62.1 percent this season was the third highest mark of his career . ( Update, July 1:  George verbally committed to re-sign with the Thunder ) In trading Victor Oladipo and Domantas Sabonis to Indiana last summer, the Thunder knew that they might have George for just one season. There\u2019s been speculation about his next destination since he arrived in Oklahoma City, and the Thunder season (which ended in the first round of the playoffs) has to be seen as a disappointment. George\u2019s free agency is tied to what happens in San Antonio with Kawhi Leonard, who is eligible for a max contract extension this summer. If that extension doesn\u2019t happen (either because the Spurs don\u2019t offer it or because Leonard doesn\u2019t accept it), Leonard will become a trade target for teams that are also in the market for George. And there are a couple of teams that have the ability to bring two of the George\/James\/Leonard trio together. Number to know: George ranked second in the league in steals (2.0 per game) and tied for the league in deflections (3.9 per game). Just when the Pelicans were hitting their stride with Cousins and Anthony Davis together, Cousins tore his Achilles. And then the Pelicans hit their stride without Cousins, winning 20 of their last 28 games in the regular season and sweeping the Blazers in the first round of the playoffs. If the Pelicans were to lose Cousins, they don\u2019t have the cap space to replace him. But there\u2019s obviously risk in giving him a big contract coming off an Achilles tear, and the the Pels\u2019 two bigs aren\u2019t a perfect fit together. As part of their February trade with Chicago, the Pelicans exercised the team option on Nikola Mirotic\u2019s contract for next season. So Mirotic is there as Davis\u2019 power forward complement for at least another year. Number to know: Cousins accounted for 47 percent of the fouls that the Pelicans drew while he was on the floor. That was the highest rate among 275 players who played at least 1,000 minutes this season .  Randle is still just 23 years old and developed into a pretty efficient scorer in the final year of his rookie deal. Among 126 players with at least 500 field goal attempts in each of the last two seasons, he saw the fifth biggest increase in true shooting percentage ( from 54 percent to 61 percent ). But the Lakers\u2019 have their eyes on bigger names and might have to renounce their rights to the restricted free agent to clear as much cap space as possible. Number to know: Randle ranked fifth with 802 total points scored in the restricted area this season .  Marcus Smart is intriguing more for what his departure would mean for the team he\u2019s leaving than for any other team he might join. And it\u2019s quite possible that he doesn\u2019t have the same value outside of Boston. Putting value on a bad shooter who makes \u201cwinning plays\u201d is difficult in the first place. What happens with Smart affects how the Celtics deal with Terry Rozier, who will be a restricted free agent next year and would draw more interest from other teams as a starting point guard (if the Celtics don\u2019t give him an extension this summer). It\u2019s hard to imagine the Celtics keeping both behind Kyrie Irving long term, but the decision could be delayed a year if Smart were to accept the one-year qualifying offer. Number to know: Smart is one of six players who averaged at least 20 minutes in 40 or more games and with their teams allowing less than a point per possession with them on the floor . The Sixers are another team that will be big-name shopping in July, which affects the status of Redick, who was signed to a one-year $23 million deal last summer. The Sixers don\u2019t have his bird rights, but wouldn\u2019t have to pay nearly that much (per year) on a long-term deal. Redick is a terrific complementary player on offense (an aggressive shooter who draws the defense\u2019s attention with relentless movement), but can be targeted on the other end of the floor, as was the case in the Eastern Conference semifinals against Boston. Number to know: Redick shot 45.9 percent on catch-and-shoot 3-pointers, the fourth best mark among 101 players who attempted at least 200 . There were times this season when the frontline duo of Favors and Rudy Gobert wasn\u2019t working out, and Utah had some success with smaller, more versatile players at the four. But overall, the Jazz outscored their opponents by 7.2 points per 100 possessions with the two bigs on the floor together , and having both gives them a rim-protecting center on the floor at all times. Utah could create cap space and go free agent shopping, but that would require them to renounce their rights to Favors and Dante Exum. Number to know: Among 160 players with at least 400 field goal attempts in each of the last two seasons, Favors saw the third biggest increase in effective shooting percentage ( from 49 percent to 57 percent ). Thomas\u2019 stock fell precipitously from being a top-five MVP vote-getter last season to being a liability in Cleveland upon returning from his hip injury, and then requiring surgery in March. Still, the Lakers\u2019 offense was pretty efficient ( scoring 110 points per 100 possessions ) with him on the floor and the last time he was healthy, he had a historically good season. There are teams (Orlando and Phoenix, especially) in need of a starting point guard, but Thomas may have to settle for a short-term deal and a bench role in order to restore his value around the league. Number to know: Among 160 players with at least 400 field goal attempts in each of the last two seasons, Thomas saw the biggest drop in both in effective shooting percentage ( from 55 percent to 44 percent ) and true shooting percentage (from 63 percent to 51 percent). No, Wade is not one of the 10 best free agents out there. But he\u2019s a future Hall of Famer who has said that Miami is the only team he\u2019ll play for going forward. We saw in Game 2 of the first round against Philadelphia that he can win a game for you on any given night . But over a full season, he\u2019d be a much better fit with the Heat (who have a handful of versatile non-shooters) if he had, at some point, developed a 3-point shot. That he hasn\u2019t increases the chances that his career is over. Number to know: Wade had an effective field goal percentage of 36.8 percent from outside the paint , the second worst mark among 207 players who attempted at least 200 total shots from the outside. Parker should look much better in the fall than he did in playing just 38 games (including playoffs) after returning from a second ACL tear in his left knee. He has issues to fix on both ends of the floor and isn\u2019t an ideal complement to Giannis Antetokounmpo in that neither shoots very well from the perimeter. Parker still has top-two-pick talent, but injury issues and defense issues make him a fascinating case in restricted free agency for a team that\u2019s looking to take a step forward with an MVP candidate and a new coach. Number to know: In the playoffs, the Bucks\u2019 offense was more than 14 points per 100 possessions better with Parker off the floor (scoring 114.9 per 100) than it was with him on the floor (100.6) . * * * John Schuhmann is a staff writer for NBA.com.

Sometimes it\u2019s about surviving and advancing. And sometimes, it\u2019s past, present and future rolled into one. *  Celtics-Cavaliers series coverage That last perspective is the big-picture, all-encompassing one in play at Quicken Loans Arena Friday night for Game 6 of the Eastern Conference championship series ( 8:30 ET, ESPN ). Normally, it\u2019s rare that a Game 6 \u2013 without nearly the cachet of those vaunted, nail-biting Game 7s \u2013 would pack such a punch. But this is no ordinary scenario. No ordinary win-or-go-home pivot point. No ordinary dominant central figure. LeBron James is what brings the context to this clash between his Cleveland Cavaliers and the Boston Celtics. His is a career measured in championship rings and lifetime NBA statistical totals, yes, but also in Finals appearances, elimination-game performances and the ability to be great when greatness matters most. James\u2019 active streak of seven consecutive trips to the NBA Finals is part of the \u201cpast\u201d mentioned up top, the train of history that James \u2013 as one of the league\u2019s legends, even if he were to quit tomorrow \u2013 sends down the track every time he steps on a court. It\u2019s also the one he seems least interested in, assuring fans and media every year around this time that some day, most likely \u201cwith a bottle of wine,\u201d he\u2019ll sit back with friends and confidantes and assess his legacy for himself. The future? That\u2019s the uncertainty in which James seems to revel, or at least thrive, as it relates to his whereabouts for any given season. He set that in motion too, eight years ago, when he took his prodigious talents to South Beach for a four-year crash education in \u201csuper teams\u201d and winning. Then he did it again in 2014, boomeranging home not to his Mom\u2019s couch in the basement but to the franchise in Cleveland where, in basketball terms, he was raised. Four years later, James is poised to do it again. He has an option in his contract for 2018-19 that allows him either to stay in Cleveland or to leave via free agency for \u2026 whatever suits him. If James wants to build another team of stars and buddies, if he prefers to jump aboard a team growing with young talent already in place such as Philadelphia, if he wants to move for lifestyle and business as much as basketball this time or if he decides that being the King of northeast Ohio to oversee the franchise he presumptively will choose to purchase someday, the choice rightfully is his. When he came back to Cleveland and led the Cavaliers to three consecutive Finals and the 2016 championship, all paperwork was stamped \u201cPaid In Full.\u201d He owes the basketball public in his home state or elsewhere nothing, as far as on-court achievements or striving. James steadfastly has declined to address his summer plans whenever asked, and it\u2019s likely they\u2019re being formulated in real time as this 2018 postseason unspools. He shrugged off the idea that he is playing now with his previous Finals appearances in mind, too, when talking with reporters after Cleveland\u2019s Game 5 loss in Boston Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019ve never went to any season saying, \u2018OK, let\u2019s have a Finals streak,\u2019\u201d James said. \u201cIt\u2019s just all about just win every game and it should put us in position to play for a championship. We have another opportunity on Friday to be as good as we can be, play Cavs basketball on our home floor and force a Game 7.\u201d So others can dwell on the past and obsess about the future. James and the Cavaliers need to be very much in the present if they want to continue playing basketball with their ultimate goal just five victories away, with this Cleveland roster as currently constituted. It has been a tortuous season for the Cavs \u2013 yes, yes, they have James, so that\u2019s an automatic head start over the rest of the NBA, but it doesn\u2019t make them impervious to setbacks and hiccups. The most notable came at point guard, when All-Star Kyrie Irving made clear last summer his intention to play elsewhere this season. Cleveland\u2019s front office blinked, trading the dynamic ball handler and shot creator to Boston . And that was only the start of it. Among the assets the Cavaliers got in return, guard Isaiah Thomas was damaged goods whose lingering rehab from a hip injury gouged into January. When Thomas finally did play, he was oil to the rest of the Cavs\u2019 (particulary James\u2019) water. And Jae Crowder didn\u2019t fit either. So more trades. Cleveland overhauled itself in early February , sending out six players, bringing back four. It has blended them into a whole in fits and starts, with coach Tyronn Lue not sure which player will perform well from one game to the next even within each playoff series. It\u2019s one thing for a young team such as Boston to experience sizable ups and downs in reliability as its players earn their playoff legs. It\u2019s quite another for salty Cavs veterans such as George Hill and J.R. Smith to do vanishing acts at the same time, as if they\u2019re all trembly based on the home vs. road schedule. Cutting through it all, of course, is James. He\u2019s been at this so long, tested-and-passed so many times in all manner of circumstances, that the default position for fans, media and even his coaches is to take him for granted. In Boston Wednesday, in what clearly was one of his poorer games this postseason and one in which he looked and admitted he was tired, James still had 26 points, 10 rebounds and five assists, while making half of his 22 shots in 39 minutes. And when Lue spoke to reporters on a conference call Thursday, he sounded pretty much like every other Cleveland hopeful. \u201cIf I had to pick one guy and choose one guy to prevail, it would be LeBron. I know he\u2019ll be great come tomorrow.\u201d James simply is the NBA\u2019s top scorer in elimination games, at 33.5 ppg across 21 such predicaments. Four times in seven elimination games faced by Cleveland, he has scored at least 40 points. So before the Cavaliers\u2019 present becomes their past, lest anyone get ahead of this playoff process and speculate about James\u2019 possibly-maybe-potentially last home game (or last game, period) with Cleveland, recall how he has handled this situations before. It really does boil down to the old saying, \u201cYesterday is history. Tomorrow is a mystery. Today is a gift, which is why they call it the present.\u201d * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

Paul\u2019s right leg will be re-evaluated after the team returns to Houston following Game 6.

And you know Chris Paul\u2019s every intention is to get to the summit. You don\u2019t wait as long as he has, fight through as many barriers as he has throughout his career and get to the final seconds of a defining game like Game 5 of the Western Conference finals, and not feel the burn when you have to watch the outcome from the bench. Paul\u2019s right hamstring didn\u2019t allow him to take in the final, frantic 22.4 seconds of the Houston Rockets\u2019 98-94 win over the Golden State Warriors Thursday night at Toyota Center. He tweaked it trying to drive to the basket on Quinn Cook with the Rockets clinging to a 95-94 lead. Another injury for the man who has seen so many of his playoff dreams vanish in a haze of different injuries over the course of his career. It has to sting. He went from shimmying at Stephen Curry after knocking down a wild 3-pointer to being forced to watch the end unfold without him on the court to finish what he\u2019d started. But the Rockets are here, up 3-2 in this series and four quarters away from dethroning the defending three-time Western Conference champion Warriors. Paul\u2019s availability for Saturday\u2019s Game 6 remained a mystery late into the night; he received treatment after the game and did not speak to the media. \u201cHe\u2019ll be evaluated tomorrow,\u201d said Rockets coach Mike D\u2019Antoni, who for the second straight game in this series relied on just a seven-man rotation. \u201cBut obviously you saw him limp off, and he\u2019s a tough guy.

We\u2019ve just got to continue doing what we\u2019re doing and we\u2019ll find our way.\u201d The Rockets found their way with Paul lighting the path of another heavyweight fight. Rockets fans left the building on an emotional high thanks to Paul, who scored 18 of his 20 points after halftime, after a brutal 1-for-7 shooting performance in the first half that made you wonder if he came into this game injured already. Once again he willed these Rockets past adversity, the same way he did in the close-out game of the conference semifinal against Utah when he piled up 20 of his playoff career-high 41 points down the stretch of a Game 5 masterpiece . \u201cWell his spirits aren\u2019t great,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said. \u201cHe wanted to be out there, and for sure he\u2019s worried and all that. That\u2019s normal. And like I said, we\u2019ll see [Friday] how it goes. But what he did was remarkable. When we were kind of teetering, he made two or three 3s. That\u2019s just his heart. He made something out of nothing. His heart, his will to win, I don\u2019t know how many times everybody\u2019s got to see it in this league. He\u2019s one of the best players that have played the game. Just his will alone and what it means to basketball, I don\u2019t know. If you can\u2019t root for him, I think you\u2019ve got some problems.\u201d The Warriors are loaded with problems then. Because they\u2019ve surely seen enough of Paul in the deciding moments of the last two games in this series. Paul led the charge in Game 4 at Oracle Arena and did it again in the third quarter of Game 5, keeping the Rockets right with the Warriors during the period they\u2019ve owned by draining three of his four attempts from beyond the 3-point line during an unconscious third-quarter stretch. \u201cIt was well-deserved,\u201d Curry said, a showman tipping his cap to a fellow showman. \u201cIt was a tough shot. If you can shimmy on somebody else, you\u2019ve got to be alright getting shimmied on. So I\u2019ll keep shimmying and maybe he will too, so we\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d It was more than just the shimmying, though. Time after time Paul got the switch he wanted, backed up and went at bigger Warriors defenders and got whatever he wanted. \u201cWell, Chris is a Hall of Fame player, this is what they do,\u201d said Warriors coach Steve Kerr. \u201cThey put James [Harden] and Chris in pick-and-roll every single time. So they\u2019re going to challenge you. We did a great job. They combined to shoot 11-for-40. He hit two 35-foot 3s that were just unbelievable. You\u2019ve got to live with that.\u201d The Rockets have lived off of it all season. They knew it would the moment Paul was acquired in that blockbuster trade with the LA Clippers that set this Rockets\u2019 Western Conference takeover attempt in motion. The aesthetics be damned. Keep your analytics. Sometimes the biggest moments require the unthinkable, unbelievable shots Kerr spoke of. \u201cThat\u2019s the most difficult shots you can imagine,\u201d Harden said of Paul\u2019s 3-point heroics and his entire arsenal of shot-clock beating artistry. \u201cHe\u2019s been doing it all year, and he just manages to get those shots off and make big plays. He was built for it.\u201d If only his body was built for the pounding that comes with the work he has to do, often as the smallest man on the floor. Paul\u2019s body always seems to betray him at the very worst times. Dragging up the long list of bumps, bruises and season-derailing instances won\u2019t do any good now. It won\u2019t do the Rockets any good, with or without him in Game 6, or even a Game 7, back here Monday if needed. Paul\u2019s right leg will be on the minds of each and every one of his teammates as they prepare for the next step on this wild ride that began with a humbling Game 1 defeat that temporarily cost them home court advantage they\u2019ve since snatched back. Can they win three straight and finish this? Is it even a realistic possibility without Paul available? \u201cThere is concern, obviously,\u201d Rockets veteran Trevor Ariza said. \u201cI hope he\u2019s healthy. I hope he gets better and if not, somebody else has to step up and do what we\u2019ve been doing all year, step in and try and help this team win.\u201d * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

Whack! went Draymond Green\u2019s fist against it as he walked by. Well, at least the Warriors hit something as the night grew late. Once again, the defending champions, the team with four All-Stars, the franchise with a pair of former MVPs still in their prime and two of the most efficient machines of this generation went flatter than Texas when it counted. Missed shots, failed stops and poor decisions all piled on their heads. That fourth quarter was mostly a 12-minute mess. It doomed them at the finish, for the second straight game, and now has them on the brink \u2014 really! \u2014 in the conference finals. The Warriors awaken today with a pair of potential saving graces: Game Six (9 ET, TNT) is in Oakland and Chris Paul is gimpy , and might be done for good. That could be enough to push this series to seven games. Yet nothing is for certain anymore in the Warriors\u2019 world, if only because of the weird and uncharacteristic \u2014 for them \u2014 developments in the clutch. Simply put, their lack of composure and smarts is the reason they\u2019re in a bind. Imagine: The Rockets don\u2019t score 100 and James Harden missed all 11 of his 3-pointers and the Warriors still lose. It was a strange, empty night for the Warriors where nothing made sense for them. Yes, Paul went nuts in the fourth quarter and Houston\u2019s defensive rotations and traps are catching the Warriors \u2014 and especially Kevin Durant \u2014 by surprise, and yet the Warriors are also doing a good job of stabbing themselves. Thursday\u2019s 98-94 loss was another blown opportunity, another one that got away, and for the first time since The Finals two summers ago the Warriors are staring at elimination. The face of the Warriors in these back-to-back losses belongs to Durant, and it wears the look of a man confused and dumbfounded. He is 1-for-9 shooting over the last two fourth quarters, reduced to a supporting actor, a backup singer, instead of a beast. He\u2019s not the total reason for this, but a strong symptom nonetheless. Could they fall short of The Finals, a place where they were all but destined to go? It\u2019s a reality, obviously, and their margin for error is toothpick-like. But that\u2019s not what coach Steve Kerr\u2019s gut tells him. \u201cI feel great about where we are right now,\u201d he said. \u201cThat may sound crazy, but I feel it. I know exactly what I\u2019m seeing out there \u2026 we got everything we needed. Just too many turnovers, too many reaches. If we settle down a little bit we\u2019re going to be in really good shape.\u201d Maybe some of Kerr\u2019s mood has something to do with Paul grabbing a hamstring in the final moments, perhaps stripping the Rockets of their best player in this series. Maybe it\u2019s just hard to fathom the Warriors losing four times in a best-of-seven. All that talent and past success can make a man stubborn, almost refusing to ponder the possibility of defeat. Fine, but Kerr and crew must find a way to clean up the bad choices they\u2019ve made with the game on the line, before it becomes habit-forming. Eighteen turnovers isn\u2019t a recipe for winning. \u201cWe can learn from it,\u201d said Durant, \u201cand we\u2019ve got another opportunity at home. We\u2019ll be ready to play.\u201d Trailing by a point with 49 seconds left, here\u2019s what the Warriors coughed up: * Quinn Cook missed a 3-pointer. The big surprise is that the ball found Cook and he actually took a shot at that stage of the game. * Curry missed a driving layup, and rather than grab the rebound, Green slapped it out toward the perimeter, hoping a teammate would grab it. Trevor Ariza scooped the lose ball instead. * Then: Down three points and seconds left, the play was designed for Curry to spring loose for a 3, but Green fumbled a pass that hit him in both hands. Game over. \u201cWe were supposed to score,\u201d said Green. \u201cI lost the ball. Nothing more, nothing less.\u201d Before these self-inflicted misadventures, the Warriors were repeatedly punished by Paul, who recovered from an 0-for-7 first half with 18 points in the second half \u2014 complete with a payback shimmy aimed at Curry \u2014 before pulling up lame with 22 seconds left. Also, Eric Gordon dropped 24 points and went to the line 10 times, thanks to reach-in fouls by beaten Warriors defenders. \u201cWhat we can\u2019t live with is reaching and jumping on Eric Gordon\u2019s pump fakes,\u201d said Kerr. \u201cWe reached on James and he shot nine free throws. We\u2019ve got to be a little more disciplined.\u201d Overall, the Warriors withstood a manic Toyota Center and were locked in a tight finish against a 65-win team, but never led after the eight-minute mark and weren\u2019t nearly sharp enough to capture the lead. They were without Andre Iguodala again, but he\u2019s a defensive specialist and for much of the night defense wasn\u2019t a big issue for the Warriors; the Rockets shot 37 percent and Harden didn\u2019t hurt them. Their problems were mistakes and missed shots. Anyway, Golden State has four All-Stars to Houston\u2019s two, and now with Paul\u2019s status questionable, maybe just one. That means, although the Warriors trail 3-2, they\u2019re in a reasonably good position to keep the series alive. They\u2019re not worried. There\u2019s another emotion running through their bodies. \u201cI think they\u2019re angry,\u201d said Kerr. \u201cAs they should be. They\u2019re competitors.\u201d This is new territory in the Durant Era. Remember, the Warriors lost only once last season and until the West Finals didn\u2019t perspire much. As expected, the Rockets are indeed the biggest threat they\u2019ve faced. It\u2019s the series that\u2019s meeting the high expectations for drama and suspense and a chance to see the mighty Warriors ousted. Does Paul\u2019s injury linger and ultimately bail out the Warriors? Can Durant rediscover his touch in the clutch? Will the Warriors wise up or once again wig out? There\u2019s nothing at stake, really, except a dynasty that a loaded team was created to become. Curry plans to remain cool and confident, and the Warriors really don\u2019t have any other choice but to adopt that mentality. \u201cWe\u2019ve played the last two games good enough to win but just haven\u2019t gotten the job done,\u201d he said. \u201cThe way we played tonight, if we can repeat that, take care of turnovers, just stay mentally locked on the details for 48 minutes, we know we can get a win. \u201cJust the talent we have on this team and the resiliency, you know we can get the job done. We know we haven\u2019t been in this position before, so it\u2019s a chapter we need to figure out and finish the story.\u201d Veteran NBA writer Shaun Powell has worked for newspapers and other publications for more than 25 years.

It came with significant cost, however, as point guard Chris Paul suffered a right hamstring injury in the final minute. Already dealing with a sore foot, Paul reached for his hamstring after a drive to the basket, limping noticeably before checking out of the game. Asked if Paul would play in Saturday\u2019s Game 6, Rockets coach Mike D\u2019Antoni said, \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d He did say Paul is \u201cworried\u201d about the injury. Paul finished the game with another quality performance, scoring 18 of his 20 points in the second half. He also recorded seven rebounds, six assists and three steals to go with zero turnovers. His effort was critical with All-Star teammate James Harden struggling with his shot throughout the game, going 0-for-11 from 3-point range. Also picking up the slack was sixth man Eric Gordon, who D\u2019Antoni says will be the team\u2019s playmaker should Paul miss Game 6. \u201c[The trainers] will do whatever they can do,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said. \u201cIf [Paul\u2019s] there, great.

But for all he\u2019s seen through his own eyes, it was his view through a virtual reality headset last year that changed the way he sees the games now. It was last year during the NCAA Tournament, Dedes and Steve Smith were calling the Sweet 16 in virtual reality, in a joint venture for Turner Sports and Intel, and the view was nothing short of amazing. \u201cWe were blown away,\u201d said Dedes, who does play-by-play for CBS Sports on NFL, NBA and college basketball broadcasts. \u201cI didn\u2019t put on the headset for the first time until the day before our first game. So we\u2019re in the truck and the people from Intel bring us in and Smitty and put the headsets on and then when we were done we took them off and looked at each other like, \u2018wow, this is incredible.\u2019 And it was interesting to see Smitty\u2019s reaction because he played, knows the sport inside and out and has done TV for a long time, but it\u2019s allowed him to see the game differently, to see how play breakdown from different angles.\u201d Smith, an analyst for NBA TV and TNT, shook his head at the memory. \u201cIt was truly amazing,\u201d he said. \u201cJust a completely different view of a game I\u2019ve lived, played and watched basically all of my adult life. The technology \u2026 it\u2019s unreal.\u201d Dedes and Stephanie Ready have been providing the \u201cunreal\u201d experience for NBA fans and viewers during the Western Conference finals; Game 5 is on tap tonight. The multi-year partnership between Turner Sports and Intel provides the NBA on TNT with yet another angle to see the Houston Rockets and Golden State Warriors battle it out for a spot in The Finals through the groundbreaking technology that is virtual reality. And it\u2019s a full-blown production, similar to the one being produced on televisions all over the place. The remote production truck led by the visual reality crew sits right outside the main entrance of Toyota Center here in Houston, sandwiched by the traditional television production trucks. \u201cWe want the experience for viewers to feel like they are actually in the arena watching ,\u201d said Nadia Banks, the experience manager for Intel Sports. \u201cSo it\u2019s not just calling the game like it is on TV. It\u2019s more like if you got to go watch the game with Stephanie and Spero, sitting next to them talk to them. Those court side seats in an arena can get really expensive. Most people I know can\u2019t afford those. But this experience allows you to transport yourself there.\u201d For Dedes, the surprises are still coming more than a year after his first broadcast. \u201cI\u2019m still seeing things and experiencing things that I haven\u2019t before,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been pretty surreal at times.\u201d For folks who have not experienced a game in virtual reality, just think of having a virtual court side seat at your favorite arena with the opportunity to view the action like you were in the middle of mix, while you\u2019re actually in the comfort of your own home. The virtual reality broadcast has its own producer and director and staffers providing graphics and all the bells and whistles of a traditional broadcast, but what you see is ultimately up to the viewer. They do their own replays, have their own pregame show. With state of the art cameras facing the middle of the floor from the scorer\u2019s table, perched on both baskets and above the tunnels exiting the floor behind the baselines, viewers can get 180 angle views of the action by choosing whichever feed they want to during the game. \u201cIt\u2019s really about how do you get the best of both worlds,\u201d Banks said as she gave a tour of the production truck and then the camera positions inside Toyota Center before Game 2 of this series. \u201cYou get all of this, plus the conversation of the announcers guiding you through the experience. Ultimately, at Intel Sports we wanted to change the way fans watch games. We wanted to make everything more immersive How do you provide new pieces of content that also let your story tell and experience the game in ways, and with angles that you normally wouldn\u2019t be able to.\u201d As far as Dedes can tell, it\u2019s working. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible, the technology,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you watch a game on TV, you\u2019re seeing it through a lens, seeing it through a prism of television. In VR, the players look like they are running right past you. There\u2019s a freaky element to this, a depth perception element that is unlike anything out there that I am aware of.\u201d With his traditional broadcast journalism training, Dedes isn\u2019t sure how long it will take for the virtual reality viewing to catch on as a mainstream outlet for viewers. He\u2019s convinced, though that it\u2019ll be a regular part of the experience for plenty of fans who embrace the technology. \u201cWith Intel, they are moving really fast on the technology front,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve noticed a difference from doing this for the first time during the NCAA Tournament last year during March of 2017 to now. It\u2019s stark, the number of improvements they have made in just that one year. But I really think this is going to become a real viewing experience for a lot of people who don\u2019t want the hassle of going to the arena and who want something different, an alternative to how they consume sports and games. \u201cYou know this. Television has changed. People\u2019s viewing habits have changed. They want alternatives. They want advanced technology, the latest things, and this sort of checks all of the boxes. It\u2019s been pretty incredible to see it from this perspective.\u201d Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

Before becoming coach in Charlotte in 2013, Clifford spent 13 years as an NBA assistant coach with the Magic, Knicks, Houston Rockets and Los Angeles Lakers. Izzo, who won a national title in 2000 with the Spartans, endured a tough season with school engulfed in the Larry Nasser sexual abuse scandal and his program being questioned about an ESPN report revealing an assault on a female student in 2010 by one of Izzo\u2019s former players who was at the time was serving on the coaching staff.

One team is missing him more than the other. The Cleveland Cavaliers traded Irving to the Boston Celtics last summer and are playing their first postseason without the guy who hit the biggest shot in franchise history. The Celtics lost Irving to a knee injury in March and are playing without their leading scorer. Both teams could use Irving\u2019s ability to play one-on-one and make something out of nothing on offense. But given how both teams defend, the Cavs are the team that could use it more. In Game 5 on Wednesday, LeBron James did not get the help he needed and the Celtics won the ugliest game of the series so far, 96-83 , to take a 3-2 series lead . Defending James and the Cavs is a pick-your-poison situation. The Celtics have generally chosen the path of playing one-on-one, so they don\u2019t have to rotate off James\u2019 teammates and get beat from beyond the 3-point line. \u201cThe more we can stay attached to everybody else and make it as tough as possible,\u201d Celtics coach Brad Stevens said before Game 5, \u201cthe better.\u201d Stevens\u2019 team backed up those words by staying attached on Wednesday. They weren\u2019t in rotation as much as they were in Games 3 and 4 and \u201ceverybody else\u201d didn\u2019t have the time and space to get good looks at the basket. They didn\u2019t have the skills either. When the defense wants to play one-on-one, it helps to have a second one-on-one scorer. Without Irving (and with Isaiah Thomas\u2019 stay in Cleveland having been both brief and ugly), the Cavs just don\u2019t have a second guy to create anything off the dribble. Their offense is often too dependent on James. A change to the Celtics\u2019 starting lineup \u2014 Aron Baynes instead of Marcus Morris \u2014 put James\u2019 primary defender for Games 1-4 on the bench. But with how much the Celtics have been switching screens, James\u2019 initial defender doesn\u2019t matter much. And as a secondary defender, Baynes is one of the Celtics\u2019 best options. On Wednesday, he was quick to rescue Terry Rozier when the 6-1 point guard was switched onto James and he helped limit Tristan Thompson to just one offensive rebound in 26 minutes. \u201cI felt like it was great for us defensively,\u201d Al Horford said of the lineup change. \u201cIt was a change that worked in our favor. Aron was great tonight \u2014 his energy, his physicality.\u201d The Cavs led by three early, but the Celtics took control with a 23-7 run to end the first quarter, with Cleveland scoring just three times on their final 15 possessions of the period. James got into the paint twice, but most of Cleveland\u2019s shots in that stretch were from the perimeter, and most of those were contested. Cleveland also had a stretch of seven straight scoreless possessions in the second quarter and scored just seven points on their final 13 possessions of the third. The Celtics also had their offensive issues. They shot just 13 for 37 (35 percent) in the paint, and they almost let the Cavs back in the game in the fourth quarter with a stretch of nine straight scoreless possessions. But not only did their defense hold up during that drought, it helped end it by creating a fast break alley-oop from Rozier to Horford. Though it barely scored a point per possession, Boston\u2019s offense maintained its balance, with six different Celtics getting between nine and 15 field goal attempts. They\u2019re missing Irving\u2019s star power, for sure. But without him, they\u2019ve run the offense through whomever has it going. In Game 5, it was Jayson Tatum, who registered 24 points and four assists. The Cavs, meanwhile, could not generate much beyond what they got from James. \u201cWe\u2019re a much better team when we move the ball,\u201d said Tristan Thompson after Game 5. \u201cNo flow,\u201d Kyle Korver added. \u201cNo body movement, no ball movement \u2026 just the traps we fall into.\u201d Credit the Celtics\u2019 defense for setting those figurative traps \u2026 by not setting literal ones. They were a little sloppy in their execution in Cleveland, but they\u2019ve done a better job of staying at home \u2014 at home. The Cavs are 36-12 when James has nine or more assists this season and now 11-12 when he has six or fewer (though he had just three in Cleveland\u2019s Game 4 win). He\u2019s the all-time leader in playoff scoring, but he\u2019s at his best in taking advantage of a rotating defense, and the Celtics didn\u2019t give him that opportunity on Wednesday. The defensive scheme, when executed as well as it was in Game 5, is not only keeping James\u2019 supporting cast in check, it may be wearing him down as well. Without Irving, James\u2019 workload is obviously heavier. His usage rate in these playoffs \u2014 he has used 36 percent of the Cavs\u2019 possessions (via his shots, turnovers and trips to the line) while he\u2019s been on the floor\u2013 is much higher than it was in the last two postseasons (31 percent both years). And it\u2019s been highest (37 percent) in the conference finals. Cavs coach Tyronn Lue said after Game 5 that he thought James \u201clooked a little tired.\u201d In seven fourth-quarter minutes, James managed just two points on 1-for-4 shooting. \u201cHe does a lot for his team,\u201d Morris said. \u201cScores, assists, rebounds, I would think he gets a little tired.\u201d This is the first time in eight years that James does not have a star playmaker at his side. And with another Boston win in the next two games, it will be the first time in eight years that he falls short of The Finals. John Schuhmann is a staff writer for NBA.com.

Jayson Tatum, so young that he actually drinks the Gatorade that\u2019s on the table when he has a podium game rather than leaving it there for cameras and branding, got 99 out of a 100 possible first-place votes from media folks for the newbie honors announced Tuesday. That left him a vote shy of both Philadelphia\u2019s Ben Simmons and Utah\u2019s Donovan Mitchell, the dueling favorites for the NBA\u2019s Rookie of the Year Award when it\u2019s announced next month. If Tatum merely is the Boston Celtics\u2019 favorite rookie, though, that\u2019s plenty. And wherever Simmons and Mitchell are at the moment, their seasons and postseasons are over. The Boston kid still is playing. Tatum scored 24 points, grabbed seven rebounds, dished four assists, pilfered four steals and blocked two shots to led the Celtics to their 96-83 Game 5 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers Wednesday night at TD Garden. His plus\/minus rating of plus-19 was second only to veteran Al Horford\u2019s (plus-22) and in a pivotal game in which his teammates shot a combined 34 percent, Tatum \u2014 who turned 20 on March 3 \u2014 hit three of his seven 3-pointers, all but one of his eight free throws and seven of his 15 field-goal attempts overall. \u2022 Complete coverage of Eastern Conference finals \u201cI think his composure [is impressive], he plays above his age,\u201d LeBron James said earlier in the day. \u201cI think the unfortunate events of the injuries that they\u2019ve had have allowed him to, I believe, get better faster than I believe they expected here. It\u2019s given him an opportunity to make \u2026 make mistakes and learn from them and still be on the floor.\u201d Losing Gordon Hayward to a gruesome leg injury in the season\u2019s opening game and having Kyrie Irving limp into knee surgery and the sunset of this season in March did bump most of Boston\u2019s players, the rookie included, up a couple spots in coach Brad Stevens\u2019 pecking order. The No. 3 pick in last June\u2019s Draft, Tatum was going to get his share of playing time. But he wound up becoming the fifth rookie in NBA history, and the first since Stephen Curry in 2009-10, to score at least 1,000 points and hit at least 40 percent of his 3-pointers. Only eight previous rookies in Boston\u2019s storied franchise history totaled 1,000 or more points. Jaylen Brown, Boston\u2019s second-year wing, developed in tandem with Tatum. The pair of lithe, skilled players dripping with potential has most of the league\u2019s personnel execs and coaches drooling. Except, with Game 6 on Friday night in Cleveland for the first of two shots at eliminating the Cavaliers, the Celtics are playing as if their future is now. A truism in the NBA is that, by the end of a rookie\u2019s first arduous season, he\u2019s not a rookie anymore. Mix in some force-feeding due to Boston\u2019s two injured stars and now three playoff rounds, and Tatum is racing to the right on his learning curve. \u201cI think that we misuse the word \u2018development\u2019 sometimes,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cI think we\u2019re in the business of \u2018enhancement.\u2019 I think Jayson was ready to deal with everything that comes with this because of who he is and his family and all his coaches before, because he\u2019s a very emotionally steady, smart player that was going to perform at a high level above his age. \u201cI don\u2019t know that anybody could guess this as a rookie, but you knew he was going to be really good.\u201d Tatum sorta had to be in Game 5. Brown got matched up in a lot of Boston\u2019s defensive coverage of James and picked up his second and third personal fouls in the second quarter. Point guard Terry Rozier looked like his road alter ego, missing six of seven shots in the game\u2019s first 24 minutes. But Tatum \u2014 who averaged 12.7 points against Cleveland in three regular-season meetings but is at 17.2 so far in the East finals \u2014 had 12 points by halftime, helping the Celtics to their 53-42 lead. \u201cI just enjoy playing in the big moments, in the big games,\u201d Tatum said. \u201cI think that\u2019s when I have the most fun, when things are on the line.\u201d It was Tatum racing downcourt to chase down Kevin Love\u2019s errant pass into the backcourt and finish with a layup that had Boston up 74-58. And it was Tatum who drew a foul on Kyle Korver with 3:11 left, prompting Cavs coach Tyronn Lue to pull a weary James. \u201cI thought he was aggressive. I thought he was poised,\u201d Lue said of Tatum. \u201cEven though he was scoring the basketball, he didn\u2019t try to rush or he didn\u2019t press. \u2026 He played like a veteran.\u201d Tatum put in his work defensively Tuesday, but also got as good as he gave. It\u2019s become a familiar tactic for defenders to get physically aggressive with him, trying to exploit what at this stage still is limited strength by NBA standards. His father Justin, a basketball coach in St. Louis , has said he plays tall and hasn\u2019t yet learned to utilize his base. \u201cJR [Smith], Jeff Green, they\u2019re playing really hard on Tatum and making it very tough,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cHe\u2019s had a lot of experiences over the last couple weeks dealing with playoff defense. I thought Milwaukee guarded him exceptionally hard and were really committed when he drove to the rim to having multiple bodies there. I thought that Philly obviously guarded him very hard. It\u2019s hard to make plays at this level in these games, and he\u2019s done that pretty consistently.\u201d The numbers back that up. Tatum by halftime had become only the sixth rookie in league history to reach 300 points in the postseason, the first since Jack Sikma in 1978. It was his ninth playoff game of 20 points or more, tying him with Mitchell this season and David Robinson in 1990 for second most by a rookie since 1964; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar had 10 in 1970. Tatum, Brown and a few other young Celtics have given credit for the team\u2019s unexpected success \u2014 considering the injuries, anyway \u2014 to Al Horford, the most obvious grown-up in Boston\u2019s locker room. When Horford was asked late Tuesday what it\u2019s like for him being around \u201cthese kids,\u201d he sounded a little like James three years ago. That\u2019s when Irving was hobbling, eventually blowing out a knee that spring, and Kevin Love was done for the playoffs due to a shoulder injury suffered in the first round. That\u2019s also when James looked at the raw help he had from guys such as Tristan Thompson and Matthew Dellavedova, and locked in on the possibility of reaching the Finals. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of fun, just because these guys, they want to play the right way,\u201d Horford said. \u201cThey play hard. I feel like we hold each other accountable out there. I think that\u2019s a big thing. And when those things happen, it becomes fun. It\u2019s fun to me. And there\u2019s no coincidence why we\u2019re in this position right now.\u201d Youth is being served, at least on the Celtics\u2019 floor. Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Brown, who is black, responded with a statement that described the incident as \u201can attempt at police intimidation\u201d and said it \u201cshouldn\u2019t happen to anybody.\u201d \u2022  Bucks, Brown release statements about arrest Morales\u2019 apology came as police released body-camera footage that showed how a simple interaction over an illegally parked car quickly escalated. The video represents another setback for a department that for years has tried to rebuild its image and relationship with Milwaukee\u2019s African-American residents after several high-profile cases of police misconduct. \u2022  W atch video Police did not identify the races of the officers, but most of the officers in the video appeared to be white. It began around 2 a.m. on Jan. 26 in a Walgreens parking lot. As Brown walks out of the store, an officer standing by Brown\u2019s car asks him for his driver\u2019s license. When Brown gets close to his car\u2019s passenger door, the officer touches Brown and he tells the officer not to touch him. \u201cBack up! Back up!\u201d the officer yells. \u201cFor what? I ain\u2019t did nothing,\u201d Brown responds. Brown eventually does show the officer his driver\u2019s license. The conversation between the officer and Brown is testy as they wait for additional squad cars to show up. Brown says he has no problem with the officer\u2019s questions and the officer responds that he touched him \u201cbecause you got up in my face.\u201d \u201cI got up on your face? Really?\u201d Brown responds in disbelief. It all took a turn for the worse when Brown, surrounded by four officers by his car, is asked to take his hands out of his pockets. Almost immediately a scuffle ensues, with the officers swarming over Brown and one yelling \u201ctaser, taser, taser!\u201d Brown is heard groaning in pain on the ground, although he\u2019s barely visible from the camera\u2019s viewpoint. Brown ultimately was not charged with anything. \u201cThe department conducted an investigation into the incident, which revealed members acted inappropriately and those members were recently disciplined,\u201d Morales said at a brief news conference. \u201cI am sorry this incident escalated to this level,\u201d he added. He left without taking questions. He did not identify the officers or say how they were disciplined. A published report says three police officers involved in the stun gun arrest of Milwaukee Bucks player Sterling Brown were punished by suspensions ranging from two to 15 days. The Milwaukee Journal, citing unidentified sources, says Officer Joseph Grams was suspended for two days. Grams was the first officer who encountered Brown. Sgts. Jeffrey Krueger and Sean Mahnke were suspended for 10 and 15 days, though it wasn\u2019t clear which supervisor received the longer suspension. They were among the officers who later arrived at the scene. Brown, in his statement, said the experience \u201cwas wrong and shouldn\u2019t happen to anybody.\u201d \u201cWhat should have been a simple parking ticket turned into an attempt at police intimidation, followed by the unlawful use of physical force, including being handcuffed and tased, and then unlawfully booked,\u201d he said. \u201cThis experience with the Milwaukee Police Department has forced me to stand up and tell my story so that I can help prevent these injustices from happening in the future.\u201d The Milwaukee Bucks signed the 6-foot-6 guard from Southern Methodist University in Texas last summer in a deal with the Philadelphia 76ers. Later in the video, after officers used the stun gun, Brown can be heard having a conversation with someone away from the view of the camera. \u201cThey tased me for no reason,\u201d an agitated Brown says. \u201cI asked you to step back and you didn\u2019t do it,\u201d the officer who had the initial interaction with Brown responds. Later, that same officer mocks Brown while talking to another officer about what happened, saying he thought Brown \u201cwas being an ass\u201d and \u201ctrying to hide something.\u201d \u201cAnd now he\u2019s like, \u2018I\u2019m a Bucks player, blah, blah, blah. So what,\u201d the officer says. City officials\u2019 concern over the content of the video was apparent earlier this week when Mayor Tom Barrett said he found it concerning. Fred Royal, the president of the NAACP in Milwaukee, said Wednesday that he \u201cdidn\u2019t see anything that would warrant\u201d a stun gun being used on Brown. \u201cI find it disturbing that an officer would incite an argument over a parking citation,\u201d Royal said. A day before releasing the body-camera footage, Morales posted a video on YouTube to reiterate his commitment to rebuild the public\u2019s trust in the department. \u201cSo if there\u2019s ever an incident where one of our members makes a mistake, unnecessarily escalating a situation, I\u2019m going to be honest and transparent about it,\u201d he said. \u201cIn those incidents, where we have made mistakes and are wrong, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Morales was appointed chief in February, following the retirement of Edward Flynn, who held the position for 10 years. Last year, Milwaukee paid $2.3 million to settle a lawsuit over the death of Dontre Hamilton, a mentally ill black man fatally shot by a police officer after the officer roused him from a park bench downtown. The officer said he shot Hamilton 14 times in self-defense because they got into a struggle when the officer frisked him for weapons. In 2016, the city paid $5 million to settle a lawsuit by 74 black residents who said police illegally strip-searched them between 2008 and 2012. Currently, the city is considering settling a lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union in Wisconsin, which is representing eight residents who say police targeted them for stops because they were African-American or Latino and because of the high-crime areas where they lived. In early May, police and prosecutors began investigating four officers who were involved in the violent arrest of a black man in a majority African-American neighborhood. Video from a bystander showed a group of officers kicking and punching the man on the ground while he was restrained. Police presented their body-camera footage of the encounter, which showed the man aggressively charging at officers and trying to punch them."},{"id":40391,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/milwaukee-bucks-sterling-brown-statement-arrest","date":"2018-05-23","title":"Milwaukee Bucks' Sterling Brown releases statement about January arrest","content":"My experience in January with the Milwaukee Police Department was wrong and shouldn\u2019t happen to anybody.

Being a voice and a face for people who won\u2019t be heard and don\u2019t have the same platform as I have is a responsibility I take seriously. I am speaking for Dontre Hamilton of Milwaukee, Laquan McDonald of Chicago, Stephon Clark of Sacramento, Eric Garner of New York, and the list goes on. These people aren\u2019t able to speak anymore because of unjust actions by those who are supposed to \u201cserve and protect\u201d the people. The common denominator in all of these situations has been racism towards the minority community, the abuse of power, and the lack of accountability for officers involved. The lack of repercussions for the police officers involved in so many of these cases is offensive. This is a slap in the face to the victims\u2019 families and communities. Black men shouldn\u2019t have to have their guard up and instantly be on the defensive when seeing a police officer, but it\u2019s our reality and a real problem. There must be mutual respect and both sides have to figure out how to accomplish this. There are no easy solutions to this problem, but there are strides that can be made to create change. I will do my part in helping to prevent similar incidents from happening to the minority community in the future. This is bigger than me. My family, friends, legal team, Priority Sports, Milwaukee Bucks, the black community and the communities of all who stand against injustice plan to continue the fight. Peaceful support to ensure no further damage to our community is the only way to respond.

I will take legal action against the Milwaukee Police Department to continue forcing change in our community. * * * BUCKS ORGANIZATION STATEMENT ON STERLING BROWN MILWAUKEE \u2014 The abuse and intimidation that Sterling experienced at the hands of Milwaukee Police was shameful and inexcusable. Sterling has our full support as he shares his story and takes action to provide accountability. Unfortunately, this isn\u2019t an isolated case. It shouldn\u2019t require an incident involving a professional athlete to draw attention to the fact that vulnerable people in our communities have experienced similar, and even worse, treatment. We are grateful for the service of many good police officers that courageously protect us, our fans and our city, but racial biases and abuses of power must not be ignored. There needs to be more accountability. The Milwaukee Police Department and local officials have acknowledged the challenges they are working to address, and we urge them to enact higher standards and more direct accountability. We all want to be able to trust each and every officer serving to protect us. Incidents like this remind us of the injustices that persist. As an organization, we will support Sterling and build on our work with local leaders and organizations to foster safe neighborhoods and better our community.

And finally: Durant, wobbly at the finish, dribbling up court with the game on the line \u2026 and shockingly surrendering the ball to Klay Thompson who was trapped deep in the corner, a poor decision leading to a poorly-aimed shot with a fraction of a second left. The Warriors have now played 31 postseason games since the signing of Durant in July 2016 made them the bully on the block, and their fourth-quarter Tuesday has its very own dubious place as the worst 12 minutes of this nearly two-year run. They were good for just 12 points on three buckets out of 18 attempts. They looked confused, panic-stricken, helpless and ultimately toast against the Rockets, losing 95-92 . And now the Western Conference finals are tied at two apiece after a pair of playoff beliefs were laid to rest: Golden State being unbeatable at home and nearly-unbeatable with Durant. They\u2019d won 16 straight at Oracle and were 29-4 overall with Durant (and undefeated at home with him). Perhaps a flat moment was inevitable, since nothing lasts forever, and the Rockets surely are no slouches, anyway. Still, it was jarring to witness the Warriors\u2019 inability to keep a comfortable lead and, once it vaporized, to snatch it back, something that comes naturally to champions. Also, not to single out one particular player \u2014 OK, well perhaps \u2014 but Durant was uncharacteristically timid in that fourth quarter, never taking control, never rescuing the Warriors the way Chris Paul saved the Rockets, delivering just one basket and then passing up a chance to be the hero at the finish. He seemed to be locked in a trance, unable to wake up or spring himself free. A bystander mostly. Ghost-like. That\u2019s just not in his DNA, which is why his stretch play in Game 4 was so weird. This was something new to Durant, the difference-maker last season during the Warriors\u2019 romp to a second title in three years, and someone who\u2019s playing at a consistently high level this spring. The screen shot of Game 4 is this: With 15 seconds left and the Rockets up two, James Harden missed a jumper, Green grabbed the rebound and gave it to Durant. With the clock ticking and the Rockets back pedaling, this was a stage made for Durant: Ball in his hands, with a chance to win or tie. Just the way the Warriors wanted it. Kerr didn\u2019t call a timeout in that situation, and debate that if you will; sometimes it\u2019s better to let the play develop, rather than allow the defense to set, and you also risk having to throw an inbounds pass. Besides, the Warriors had four veteran All-Stars on the floor. Do they really need a pointer or two? \u201cDraymond was trying to call one around four seconds and at that point the officials weren\u2019t looking,\u201d said Warriors coach Steve Kerr. \u201cBut I\u2019m always a proponent of pushing the ball off of a miss rather than call timeout. I thought we\u2019d get a better shot in transition. That\u2019s why I let them play.\u201d Durant crossed mid-court and the Rockets didn\u2019t immediately throw a double-team his way. Yet, the player who famously gut-punched LeBron James and the Cavaliers last summer with a pull-up three-pointer in a similar situation did not even look at the basket. He threw to Thompson, who appeared surprised, who was surrounded by Rockets and trapped in the extreme corner of the court, to the left of the basket, looking uncomfortable and unaccustomed to seeing the ball in his hands in this situation. Um, what? Of course, in hindsight, Durant would like a do-over. \u201cI was trying to see if I had some options,\u201d he said. \u201cI saw Klay running along the baseline and maybe I should\u2019ve waited until he set his feet. But I just threw a bounce pass. I wish it could\u2019ve been a better possession at the end. We\u2019ve got to live with that one.\u201d Or die with it, actually. \u201cI wish I had that play back,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI\u2019m going to watch film and see what my options were and hopefully if I\u2019m in that position again I\u2019ll be better.\u201d He yielded heavily to Curry, but the problem is Curry wasn\u2019t much better, making just a lone fourth-quarter basket himself and watching as the final shot of the game harmlessly nicked off the rim. Overall, the Warriors just didn\u2019t have it \u2014 they were \u201cfatigued\u201d to use Kerr\u2019s excuse \u2014 and lost a 12-point lead in the fourth and their command of the series as well. It went deeper than just a sloppy fourth. The Rockets were the tougher team both mentally and physically \u2014 Paul daring to go nostril to nostril with Draymond a handful of times \u2014 and simply battled. How many people figured the Rockets would fold after the Warriors dropped 34 on them in the third quarter, 17 from Curry, and flipped the score heavily in their favor? At that point, with the crowd roaring and sensing a quick series, and Curry splashing deep threes and doing shimmies again, and Durant with 21 points through three quarters, what could possibly go wrong for the home team? \u201cI mean, when you get a lead like that, it would help to sustain it,\u201d Curry said. The Warriors had only one assist in the fourth and their offensive sets were essentially a string of isolation plays. Again, that\u2019s not necessarily bad for them; Golden State thrives in any style. Yet the Rockets figured them out and the Warriors had no answer, mainly because the ball wouldn\u2019t fall. Sometimes, there are no other valid excuses; it\u2019s a make-or-miss league. They played without Andre Iguodala, resting with a bum knee. Iguodala often bails out the Warriors during rare tough stretches, yet the game was winnable even without him. Also, Thompson briefly left the game early with a knee issue yet returned and played without a limp. For the first time, a game in the West final had suspense after margins of 13, 22 and 41. The largest lead in the final nine minutes was only five. Basketball fans finally got what they wanted, a compelling game and now, perhaps, a series as well, since it\u2019s guaranteed to go at least six. What the Warriors want is some explanation from the Basketball Gods about what overcame them in the fourth quarter, because this was something new for Durant and crew. \u201cWe just ran out of gas,\u201d said Kerr. \u201cNot an ideal situation,\u201d said Curry. \u201cIt was there for the taking,\u201d said Thompson. They\u2019ll have two more games to reclaim their identity. Three if necessary. * * * Veteran NBA writer Shaun Powell has worked for newspapers and other publications for more than 25 years.

Twice they absorbed knockout blows from the reigning champion Golden State Warriors in a do-or-die Game 4 of the Western Conference finals in a raucous Oracle Arena. And both times the Rockets got up off the floor and battled back, showing championship mettle of their own, to do what no team has done to these Warriors since Kevin Durant joined them. The Rockets showed up five minutes late, battled back from a 12-0 blitz to start the game and a 27-8 third quarter avalanche to win 95-92 and tie this series at 2-2 and reclaim the home-court advantage they lost in Game 1. With the game, and their franchise-best 65-win regular season and basically everything on the line, the Rockets outplayed the mighty Warriors down the stretch to snap the NBA playoff-record 16-game home win streak. They proved that they belong on this big stage and that they are who they thought they were when they were dominating the league throughout the course of the regular season. \u201cI just think this was confidence,\u201d said veteran forward Trevor Ariza, the only player on the Rockets\u2019 roster who owns a championship ring (Los Angeles Lakers, 2009). \u201cWe\u2019re a confident team. We believe in ourselves and we went out and showed that we can win anywhere.\u201d It was the Warriors, the group with all of the experience in these moments, that melted down late in the game, not the Rockets. The pressure that Rockets coach Mike D\u2019Antoni insisted was on the Warriors after his team\u2019s 41-point loss in Game 3 Sunday was there. The Rockets outscored the Warriors 25-12 in the fourth quarter. The Warriors shot just 3-for-18 after torching the Rockets for 34 points, 17 from Stephen Curry, in a third quarter that looked like one of their signature waves that usually slams the door on the opposition. But not this time. Not with the Rockets playing their best defensive quarter of the season, according to D\u2019Antoni. \u201cYeah, I thought it was the highest level we\u2019ve ever played defensively, without a doubt,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause you\u2019re talking about maybe the best offensive team ever, and they got on a roll. Even when we were down 12-zip, there was some good defense in there to get us back, because we weren\u2019t lighting it up to get it back. \u201cSo (we) just got a lot of tough stops and a lot of tough rebounds, getting loose balls and we didn\u2019t get into foul trouble too early. It was just a lot of good things. Great switching and they got a little tired in the fourth quarter, and that\u2019s because they felt us for three quarters. If we can repeat that, and that\u2019s what the formula is, and we\u2019ll see if we can do that when we get to Houston.\u201d The Rockets couldn\u2019t have gone home even without the work Chris Paul put in during the first pressure-cooker game of this series. Playing on a sore foot, he was nothing short of magnificent in the fourth, scoring eight of his 27 points, while showing the sort of toughness the Rockets lacked before his arrival last summer in a blockbuster trade. \u201cMan, he\u2019s been doing it for so long,\u201d James Harden said of his fellow superstar point guard. \u201cNow he has an opportunity to do it on this stage. I mean, everybody knows how great he is, from his passing ability to his big shot-making ability, and even to his defense. He was huge for us tonight.\u201d That\u2019s all Paul was focused on. One game. One night. One chance to make things right. \u201cIt was a good win for us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe knew we needed it, but we said all along with both teams home court doesn\u2019t really matter. Both teams have the ability to win on the road. We had to prove that to ourselves. Weathering the storm, the runs that they made, and knowing that now we got a chance to go back home, we knew we had to get at least one win here. We got it, so now it\u2019s a three-game series.\u201d D\u2019Antoni only used seven players to get the job done, leaning on his core group in a grueling game to flip this series into a best-of-three with the Rockets back in a position of power. The trust and faith he showed in his core group paid off. \u201c We \u2019 re confident in what we do, \u201d  Ariza said.  \u201c When we are locked in to what we are doing and what we are supposed to be doing, we are a really good defensive team. We \u2019 re a really good team, period. We just came out and played hard tonight. For all the hard-earned hype about the Warriors and what they are capable of, the Rockets still haven\u2019t lost consecutive games in this postseason. They are 4-2 on the road, 2-0 in games decided by three points or less and a perfect 5-0 when Paul scores 25 or more points. They still have work to do in this series, of course, but they are on a path that suggests they possess the sort of fiber needed to make it into the championship discussion. D\u2019Antoni called them soft after that Game 3 embarrassment. He praised their toughness on this night, and rightfully so. \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing it all year long,\u201d said Harden, who scored just two of his game-high 30 points in the fourth quarter. \u201cThat\u2019s the main reason we\u2019re in the position we\u2019re in today. That third game was just one loss. We all know that. We\u2019ve got the mentality that we\u2019re going to win Game 4. We talked about it. We\u2019ve preached it. \u201cThey made runs and they were going to, especially at home. And we kept fighting, kept fighting and defensively kept locking in and making big-time shots. Chris and Eric (Gordon) and Trevor, guys made big-time shots in that fourth quarter.\u201d A fourth quarter that changed this series and could potentially change the entire postseason landscape, depending on what comes next from this team with its destiny back in its own hands.

It can play hard, it can play together, and it can play smart. The Boston Celtics played harder and more together in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference finals than they did two nights earlier, when they lost to the Cleveland Cavaliers by 30 points. \u201cWe responded,\u201d Jaylen Brown said afterward. \u201cIt was a better game and a better effort by our team.\u201d The Celtics played hard and played together. Two out of three ain\u2019t bad, but two out of three isn\u2019t enough on the road against a team led by LeBron James. The Celtics didn\u2019t play very smart on Monday, and a 111-102 victory for the Cavs has this series tied at two games apiece. Really, the first 24 minutes of Game 4 was one of the dumber halves of basketball you will ever see from a team that had been putting on a clinic of execution over an eight-game stretch from Game 7 of the first round through Game 2 of the conference finals. In the first quarter, Brown pushed the ball up the floor after a Cleveland bucket, only to have Marcus Smart \u2013 29 percent from 3-point range in his career \u2013 shoot a 3 (his second missed jumper in as many possessions) with 19 seconds on the shot clock. Shortly thereafter, with the Cavs in the bonus, the Celtics committed three straight fouls more than 15 feet from the basket, sending Cleveland to the line for free points. And with the shot clock off at the end of the first, Brown tried to score too early and missed a dunk, giving the Cavs another chance to build on what was already a 16-point lead. In the first six minutes of the second quarter, the Celtics fouled the Cavs three times on jump shots. Late in the second, Smart rebounded a George Hill miss and, as he was falling out of bounds, tossed the ball behind his back \u2026 right to Hill for an easy layup. And on the ensuing Celtics possession, Semi Ojeleye, who has made five pull-up 3-pointers this season, attempted one with 10 seconds left to shoot. It seemed that no Celtic was immune to being boneheaded. Brown said that they were \u201cjust going too fast, too excited.\u201d \u201cWe need to slow down,\u201d he said. \u201cWe missed a bunch of easy opportunities. We made some bad turnovers and things like that.\u201d The second half was better, but the Celtics never aggressively attacked Kevin Love after he picked up his fifth foul early in the third quarter (and returned to start the fourth). Marcus Morris made sure that Smart wasn\u2019t the only guy who saved the ball under the opponent\u2019s basket, gifting James with a layup after initially intercepting his pass during a crucial stretch. And when the Celtics had chances to make it a two-possession game in the fourth, they took just a few too many bad shots. \u201cI think obviously we\u2019ve got to play better than we did,\u201d Celtics coach Brad Stevens said when asked about mental mistakes. \u201cI\u2019ll go through film and we\u2019ll re-look at it and determine the main reasons why we were where we were, but certainly we didn\u2019t play a perfect game.\u201d So the series is tied 2-2 and with the way things have gone, it has become more difficult for Stevens to downplay the home-road narrative that he\u2019d like to keep from seeping into his locker room. While the coach has said that he wasn\u2019t \u201closing sleep over where we\u2019re playing right now,\u201d his team clearly hasn\u2019t played like it\u2019s been oblivious of the environment. To Stevens\u2019 point, the game should be the same, whether you\u2019re playing at home or on the road. The result should be about how the players play, not the color of the floor or the support of the crowd. But that simply hasn\u2019t been the case in these playoffs for the Celtics, who are 9-0 at TD Garden and now 1-6 on the road. \u201cIt\u2019s much harder,\u201d Al Horford admitted. \u201cWe have to be better. We have to execute better. We have to do all those things in order to win. It\u2019s hard to win on the road, as we found out here.\u201d Over the last five years, home-court advantage has been worth less than three points per game in the regular season and a little more than four points per game in the playoffs. This year, the Celtics ranked third with 28 regular-season wins on the road. But in the playoffs, the difference between the Celtics at home (plus-11.3) and on the road (minus-12.0) has been more than 23 points per game. Their only road win (Game 3 of the conference semifinals in Philadelphia) came in overtime. In the conference finals, the Celtics are a plus-38 in Boston and a minus-39 in Cleveland. They haven\u2019t been totally \u201crattled\u201d at Quicken Loans Arena, but they\u2019ve been rushed, uncomfortable, and undisciplined. And because of that, the Celtics will be coming back to Cleveland for Game 6. They don\u2019t need to win here to win the series, but given how they\u2019ve played in Cleveland so far, they need to stay undefeated at home. John Schuhmann is a staff writer for NBA.com.

Why, in other words, was such hustle and winning plays at the ready some nights and so conspicuously absent on others? \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d James said, his face in shadow from the bill of his cap. \u201cI don\u2019t know, either,\u201d Love said, a beat or two later. Kyle Korver took more of a crack at it after Cleveland repeated the performance Monday, fending off the Boston Celtics in Game 4 to even the best-of-seven series at two games apiece. This time it was closer, a 111-102 Cavaliers victory rather than the 30-point blowout two nights earlier. But that only accentuated the intangibles, the grimy work the Cavs did better than the Celtics possession after possession. Cleveland could point afterward to various miscues and breakdowns that prevented it from building the lead Monday to the breezy levels of Game 3. Then again, the Cavaliers managed their advantage adeptly, fending off a Boston team that reclaimed some of its feistiness in the second half. No matter what sort of run the Celtics made in the third and fourth quarters, the Cavs kept them three possessions behind. That\u2019s as close as Boston got, and no closer. Not that Korver was any better at explaining why this time and why not those other times. \u201cI\u2019m not going to give you a great answer either, because you\u2019re supposed to do it all the time,\u201d the veteran shooter said. \u201cYou want to have that mentality all the time. \u201cSometimes you don\u2019t always get opportunities like that in a game. I had a loose ball in the first half that I didn\u2019t dive on, and I was mad at myself afterwards. I was in the mindset tonight of doing that, but I didn\u2019t do it on that one.\u201d There\u2019d be no second regret. If there was one play that typified Cleveland\u2019s success in shortening the East finals now to best-of-three, resuming on the Celtics\u2019 floor at TD Garden Wednesday ( 8:30 p.m. ET, ESPN ), it was Korver diving headlong after a loose ball near the end of the third quarter. Cleveland point guard George Hill tied up Boston big man Aron Baynes for a jump ball mismatch, so James and Korver flashed some quick communication that they intended to steal Baynes\u2019 inevitable tap. \u201cThey were tipping it back and \u2018Bron saw me going,\u201d Korver explained. \u201cI was going, but I wasn\u2019t going that far. And he hit it all the way (downcourt). So I just took off after it. And I felt Terry (Rozier) run right past me. I was like, \u2018Oh, I\u2019ve got to dive after this thing.\u2019\u201d Korver did dive, and had a bead on the ball. Rozier was at a disadvantage, trying to locate it on the fly, and the result when the ball squirted out of bounds proved it: Cavaliers basketball. \u201cI felt so incredibly old and slow when I dove after that ball,\u201d Korver said. \u201cBut the heart was in the right spot.\u201d At 37, Korver had the sort of gritty game that propels good teams through the postseason. He scored 14 points on 4-of-7 shooting in his 25 minutes, winding up as the game\u2019s most prolific bench scorer. But the 6-foot-7 marksman, usually offered faint praise as a \u201csolid team defender,\u201d also blocked three shots, getting his hands on the ball to disrupt Boston possessions and generally tormented Jaylen Brown when they were matched up. Brown shot 4-of-14 for just 10 points through the first three quarters. \u201cHe\u2019s guarding \u2014 how old is Jaylen Brown?\u201d James asked. \u201cTwenty-one? He\u2019s guarding Jaylen Brown, one of the most athletic wings we have in our league. Jaylen can fall on the ground 10 times and probably spring up and just as likely never feel it. I don\u2019t remember Kyle falling too much like that. \u201cBut listen, he\u2019s doing whatever it takes to try to help us win, with the blocks, with the strips. Obviously his shot-making is very key for our team as well, but it\u2019s just the intangibles he\u2019s doing for us defensively that has put him in a position to be on the floor.\u201d Said Cavs coach Tyronn Lue after being reminded that Korver \u2013 drafted in the same 2003 Draft as James, only 50 picks later after four years at Creighton \u2013 has been 37 since St. Patrick\u2019s Day: \u201cGod dang. We\u2019re playing him too many minutes.\u201d There were multiple Cavaliers flying around defensively, to use their vernacular, and chipping in small moments and prized intangibles. They needed them all, too, on a night when they weren\u2019t all that sharp handling the ball (19 turnovers worth 19 points to Boston) or shooting it from distance (8-for-23, compared to 17-of-34 in Game 3). So they needed the work of center Tristan Thompson, who has made Boston\u2019s Al Horford battle for everything since Lue flipped Thompson into the starting lineup in Game 2. Thompson scored 13 points with 12 rebounds and a pair of blocks. Then there was Larry Nance Jr., bouncy and pesky, scoring seven points in 10-plus minutes with a pair of blocks and a couple of offensive rebounds. James had the night\u2019s gaudiest number, scoring 44 points in 42 minutes. But even then, it was James\u2019 repeated exploitation of Rozier as a switched and generally overmatched defender, along with finishes at the rim and \u201chockey assists\u201d to initiate plays that kept Cleveland in front. Now all the Cavaliers need to do is replicate the performance in Boston. The series could be decided entirely according to home court, but both the Celtics and the Cavaliers are frantic to win at least one on their opponents\u2019 floor. The former could make their task a little easier by doing so, the latter can\u2019t advance if they don\u2019t snag either Game 5 or Game 7. \u201cHave the same approach going into Boston,\u201d Lue described his message to the players. \u201cI think playing with more speed and more pace, pushing the basketball. I think taking care of the basketball is the most important, especially on the road. You don\u2019t want to turn the ball over when you get to Boston because they really thrive off that \u2014 dunks, 3s, layups.\u201d Nothing can match the satisfaction a sniper like Korver feels when he nails several soul-crushing, quick-release 3-pointers against scrambling defenders. But beating the other guy to a floor burn has its rewards, too. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to get here,\u201d Korver said of the conference championship series, one step shy of The Finals. \u201cJust because LeBron\u2019s been here so many years in a row, sometimes some people can take it for granted and just expect it to happen. It\u2019s hard to get this far in the playoffs. It\u2019s hard to win a playoff series. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have the opportunity and you\u2019ve just got to be ready for it. Maybe some guys don\u2019t like doing those plays. But in the playoffs, you should be going after all of them.\u201d Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Now, one of the NBA\u2019s budding superstars will be on Budenholzer\u2019s side after the former Atlanta Hawks coach was formally introduced on Monday as the new leader of the Milwaukee Bucks. \u201cIt was miserable coaching against him and I\u2019m so happy to be (saying), `34\u2019s on my team?\u201d\u2018 Budenholzer said, referring to Antetokounmpo\u2019s jersey number. \u201cThat\u2019s like really cool. \u201cHe\u2019s a nightmare to coach against, to game-plan, to figure out how you can keep him away from the basket.\u201d No need to worry about that anymore. But Budenholzer\u2019s experience with building strong defensive teams in Atlanta should come in handy for Milwaukee. The 48-year-old Budenholzer went 213-197 in five seasons with the Hawks. Budenholzer was named the NBA coach of the year in 2015, when he led the Hawks to a franchise-record 60 wins and an appearance in the Eastern Conference finals. The Hawks held foes to 97.1 points per game and 36 percent shooting that season. Atlanta went an Eastern Conference-worst 24-58 this season. But they were rarely blown out, losing 21 games by fewer than 10 points and only seven by 20 or more points. Atlanta is rebuilding. Budenholzer now takes over a team moving into a new downtown arena that is in position to challenge for a top-four seed in the East next year \u2013 especially if it can play more consistent defense. \u201cI think with the individual talents we have in Milwaukee \u2026 I think one of the words I used in the interview process was, `How can we unlock this talent defensively?\u201d\u2018 Budenholzer said. \u201cI just think there\u2019s so much to work with.\u201d Start with the 6-foot-11 Antetokounmpo, whose length and athleticism make him a threat on both ends of the floor. Khris Middleton has grown into a good two-way player, while Eric Bledsoe and Malcolm Brogdon provide toughness at point guard. The Bucks are coming off a 44-win season and third playoff appearance in four years. They also allowed 106.8 points a game and had problems with rebounding and defending the 3-point line, and coach Jason Kidd was fired at midseason. In Budenholzer, they got an experienced coach with a track record of developing players and a resume that traces back to a 17-year stint as an assistant with the San Antonio Spurs. San Antonio won four NBA titles while Budenholzer was there. \u201cFinding the right person, the right fit for this team \u2026 to help this group take the next step was paramount,\u201d general manager Jon Horst said. \u201cUltimately after going through the process, it was clear that Bud was the right guy to do that.\u201d Budenholzer said players would be able to understand his defensive principles quickly, which would help in \u201cfreeing them up to be great on that side of the court.\u201d The details are still being worked out. He\u2019s barely been on the job for five days, and he\u2019s hoping that most of his staff from Atlanta follows him to Milwaukee. Budenholzer hasn\u2019t even met the whole team. But he has had breakfast already with the Bucks\u2019 two best players, Middleton and Antetokounmpo. Building a solid relationship with Antetokounmpo, especially, might be his one of his most important tasks for now. \u201cAnd those conversations, I look forward to having with Giannis and listening to Giannis too. He\u2019s a smart player,\u201d Budenholzer said. \u201cI think together, he and I will probably push each other. But I look forward to pushing him. He believes it, I believe it. He\u2019s going to get a lot better.\u201d"},{"id":40403,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/new-orleans-pelicans-head-coach-alvin-gentry-makes-pitch-demarcus-cousins","date":"2018-05-21","title":"Head coach Alvin Gentry making sure DeMarcus Cousins is wanted by New Orleans Pelicans","content":" New Orleans Pelicans head coach Alvin Gentry is doing his part in making sure All-Star DeMarcus Cousins is welcomed to continue his stay in the Big Easy.

Only Hope remained there in an unbreakable home within under the rim of the great jar and did not fly out at the door; for ere that, the lid of the jar stopped her, by the will of Aegis-holding Zeus who gathers the clouds. But the rest, countless plagues, wander amongst men; for earth is full of evils and the sea is full. \u2013Hesiod, Works and Days The fable of what became known as Pandora\u2019s Box, rather than Pandora\u2019s Jar (the original wording, per Hesiod, having changed in translation over the centuries), resonates more than ever today, in a world in which we want immediate answers before we even know what the right questions are to ask. The notion of unintended consequences is front and center as we learn more and more rapidly because of technology but spend less and less time contemplating what we\u2019ve learned\u2014also, in large part, because of technology. The Supreme Court\u2019s 6-3 decision last week that opened the door to legalizing gambling on sports in the United States will do a few things we already know. It will inject hundreds of millions of dollars into state coffers around the country, as legislatures and municipalities rapidly approve bills that will allow residents of their respective states to bet on, basically, anything\u2014but, from now on, legally, with the states getting the lion\u2019s share of the revenues. The ruling will allow states to legally set up sports books, which will allow citizens of those states to make bets on games without having to drive to Las Vegas or call a 900 number on some island in the Atlantic. Nineteen states, led by New Jersey\u2014which set all this in motion when its citizens passed a nonbinding referendum in 2012 legalizing sports betting, and whose state legislature soon after codified that referendum into state law\u2014had fought the federal government in court the last five years, and had lost almost every decision in the courts until last week. Those and other states are now scrambling to get sports books and casinos up and running as soon as possible. \u201cThis is their new lottery ticket,\u201d said Michele Roberts, the Executive Director of the National Basketball Players Association, in a phone interview Saturday. The SCOTUS decision, striking down the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA), enacted in 1992, will create a tsunami of interest in sports across the board going forward\u2014collegiate and pro. Hardcore fans will now be able to put a bet on whether the next pitch will be a ball or a strike; whether the field goal will go wide left, wide right or down the middle; if the 50 percent foul shooter makes the next one or not. But, as is the case with March Madness and the NCAA Tournament, people in every office, car pool, dorm or church will be able to participate as well. Casual fans who don\u2019t follow every drop of the puck or grind through 162 regular season baseball games will nonetheless tune in on their various devices to see the outcomes of innings, quarters, halves and periods. We know that sports leagues and their television partners will, one way or another, be further enriched, with the attention already paid to their games and broadcasts almost certain to grow exponentially as more people place legal bets on the various outcomes. And more eyeballs viewing\/consuming mean bigger ratings, more clicks and more advertising dollars. And, we know Las Vegas, no matter which other municipalities get up to speed in the coming years, is going to remain front and center in setting the lines and odds and everything else that develops. \u201cWe\u2019ve been preparing for this decision for quite some time now,\u201d said Jay Kornegay, the vice president of Race and Sports SuperBook at the Westgate Las Vegas Resort and Casino, the largest of its kind in the state. \u201cWe\u2019re not of the position that considered (the decision) a threat,\u201d Kornegay said. \u201cWe\u2019re in the boat of it being an opportunity. We\u2019ve been preparing to expand our brand, the SuperBook, in other jurisdictions. How that will work will depend on the states and the specific regulations that will be set up.\u201d PASPA basically barred states from being able to legally accept wagers on sporting events; four states that had existing sports betting laws\u2014Nevada, Oregon, Delaware and Montana\u2014were grandfathered in and allowed to continue their programs. (Ironically, PASPA\u2019s main sponsor in the U.S. Senate was Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame forward Bill Bradley, who authored the bill while serving as Senator from New Jersey.) And, on the surface, who would have a problem with that? Which is the problem with surface-based analyses. What we don\u2019t know about the potential impacts of the SCOTUS decision is what\u2019s unnerving\u2014for professional sports leagues including the NBA, but, potentially, for so many other people connected either directly or tangentially with sports at all levels. There will certainly be unintended consequences of bringing gambling out into the open, with an impact that can\u2019t possibly be imagined or prepared for at this juncture. You simply cannot introduce this much money into the system of sports this quickly\u2014the sports betting industry in the United States, mostly in the shadows outside of the legal betting allowed in Nevada, is estimated to go through hundreds of millions of dollars annually\u2014without the river of dollars cutting through places with which it shouldn\u2019t connect. \u201cThere are so many parts to this,\u201d said Marc Ganis, the co-founder of SportsCorp, Ltd., a sports consulting firm that has assisted in the sale of NFL, NBA and Major League Baseball teams and the building of arenas and stadiums around the country for much of the last two decades, connecting prospective and current team owners to the leagues and to revenue sources that aid in the purchase of those teams and the building of their owners\u2019 new palaces. \u201cMany important parts are being, if not ignored, treated way too casually,\u201d Ganis said. \u201cIt\u2019s an important decision and will result in meaningful changes\u2014and not all of them will be positive.\u201d Chief among the many new concerns is, obviously, the threat of gambling and gamblers reaching teams and players\u2014or, even more worrisome, the mere accusation of untoward behaviors by team employees. We all know the tinfoil crowd is already out there, especially this time of year, when some claim every playoff game is fixed, either through result or point spread, to benefit some shady entity. \u201cAs the executive director of the players association, I\u2019m supposed to be seeing this as how to monetize this for the benefit of the players,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cBut there are so many other things that we have to anticipate addressing.\u201d The union anticipated a SCOTUS ruling that would allow gambling going forward when it negotiated the most recent Collective Bargaining Agreement with the NBA\u2014and provide the players with a potential cut of the new revenues generated. Article VII, Section 1, (a) (1) (xiii) states players will receive their share of Basketball Related Income including: All proceeds, net of Taxes, less reasonable and customary expenses (which expenses shall be subject to New Venture treatment, if applicable, under Section 1(a)(6)(iii) below), subject to the provisions of Section 1(a)(6) below, from gambling on NBA games or any aspect of NBA games, subject to appropriate treatment of categories of excluded revenues or other amounts, if applicable, under Section 1(a)(2) below and allocations for multi-element deals. BRI shall exclude revenues from gambling on NBA games or any aspect of NBA games generated by casinos or other gambling businesses, owned or operated by a Team, Related Party, or a League-related entity, whose total revenues are not predominantly from gambling on NBA games or any aspect of NBA games\u2026 Yet how can leagues adequately prepare for not just the influx of money, but the enhanced scrutiny that will follow every moment of every game going forward? Again: we\u2019re not even talking about the potential incentives to actually play cute with point spreads and\/or results of games. Point shaving scandals have roiled college basketball throughout the decades, from CCNY and Kentucky in the 1950s, to Boston College in the 1970s, to Arizona State to Tulane and Northwestern in the 1990s. Soccer, which is bet on legally around the world, hasn\u2019t fared all that well lately when it comes to keeping its sport out of the world spotlight for the wrong reasons. Ditto sports like cricket . Just the appearance and\/or accusation of same in our social media world today could be devastating; witness the corrosive effect of the claims of former NBA referee Tim Donaghy that NBA officials had been compromised. At base, scrutiny of players, coaches and other team officials could well increase to a level we have yet to see. \u201cAre the unions and the players prepared for some privacy invasions, similar to what takes place to testing for performance enhancing drugs, but now related to integrity\u2014which is a much less tangible matter?,\u201d Ganis asked. When you add up players, coaches and training staffs\u2014who would have the kind of access on player injuries that could be enticing to those who are putting down bets\u2014there could be up to \u201c600 people right off the bat who have to be monitored on a regular basis,\u201d Ganis said. \u201cAnd they\u2019re going to have to agree to this. The Players\u2019 Association had to agree that their members had to have their blood drawn or to give urine samples to test for drugs. What about if you want to look at their e-mails or their bank accounts?\u201d For that matter, he asks, what about garbage time, after which the result of the game has long been decided. A player who drives to the hole to score what would normally be a meaningless layup at the buzzer could impact the spread\u2014and would immediately fall under intense scrutiny. Roberts sees an even bigger adjustment that will have to be made. \u201cI have no issue or any reason to believe players will need to or need to change their in-game conduct,\u201d she said. \u201cI think our guys love this game. I don\u2019t have any worry that this is going to make players suddenly become cheaters. What I do worry about is the guy who says \u2018 I feel a little sore today,\u2019 and he really does, and someone saying to him from your environment that he\u2019s trying to affect the betting environment. \u201cYour (media) colleagues are going to have to be managed in terms of what kinds of questions are appropriate. You have people now asking Steph (Curry), \u2018are you sure your knee is okay?,\u2019 and him saying \u2018yes!\u2019 And I love that brother. In the new environment, you can imagine people accusing him of being disingenuous in terms of his health so that he can manipulate the spread. It could be really ugly.\u201d Nonetheless, the ruling was hailed by many who have skin in the game. Some who\u2019ve been on the front lines of the NBA\/gambling debate during the last few years don\u2019t believe there will be deleterious effects created by the SCOTUS ruling. They are not worried about potential integrity issues, feeling there could actually be enhancements created by new technology solutions. They understand we\u2019ve crossed the Rubicon as a country when it comes to gambling and understand the desire to move illegal wagering to legal betting, deprive organized crime of the profits and enhance state finances. Emerging companies like Swiss-based Sportradar, with which the NBA and the other major sports leagues in the United States have partnerships , produce and analyze enormous amounts of data about sporting events, which are provided to the various leagues, while also policing potential betting anomalies that could unearth shenanigans with point spreads and the like. The advent of daily fantasy sports betting, accelerated in 2006 after passage of the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA), brought daily fantasy sports betting into the sunlight, with DraftKings and FanDuel, leaving no rational philosophical distinction between that and other forms of gambling. \u201cMany ask if this decision will impact the integrity of sports themselves. I think it\u2019s just the opposite,\u201d Washington Wizards owner Ted Leonsis said in a statement last week after the ruling was announced. \u201cI think that the increased transparency that will accompany more legalized betting around the country will only further protect against potential corruption. They say sunlight is the best disinfectant, and in this case I believe that is certainly true. \u201cOf course, there are a huge number of questions about how today\u2019s decision will play out across different states and throughout the different leagues. I don\u2019t claim to know all of those answers today, but what I do know is that this is a new frontier for professional sports and teams who don\u2019t seize on this opportunity will be left behind. As millennials and Gen Z continue to embrace the second screen, it\u2019s not hard to imagine in the near future fans on their devices analyzing data, placing bets and communicating with each other in real time during games. Legalized sports betting will only bring fans closer to the game, ramping up the action in each minute and creating more intensity. It will bring new revenue into the economy, creating jobs and growing our tax base. Today\u2019s decision is a great one for sports fans and I am eager to embrace it.\u201d In doing so, Leonsis echoes the position of NBA Commissioner Adam Silver, who wrote an op-ed in The New York Times in 2014 advocating the legalization of sports betting. It was a reversal of the league\u2019s previous position, which had been advocated for strongly by then-commissioner David Stern. Silver advocated passing federal laws that would allow states to accept legal wagers, but with uniform regulations and technological safeguards. (The league reiterated this position after the SCOTUS ruling last week.) \u201cLet me be clear: Any new approach must ensure the integrity of the game,\u201d Silver wrote back in 2014. \u201cOne of my most important responsibilities as commissioner of the NBA is to protect the integrity of professional basketball and preserve public confidence in the league and our sport. I oppose any course of action that would compromise these objectives. \u201cBut I believe that sports betting should be brought out of the underground and into the sunlight where it can be appropriately monitored and regulated.\u201d Along those lines, the NBA and other sports leagues are already advocating for a cut of the new potential revenues, arguing that they not only provide the apparatus and platforms for games, but will have to make additional investments to investigate potential suspicious activities. The so-called \u201cintegrity fee\u201d argued for by the leagues could be up to one percent of all monies bet on games. \u201cThe issue of the integrity fee is a really good one,\u201d Ganis said. \u201cDo I think the leagues should receive a fee? The answer is unequivocally yes. The reason for it is simple\u2014they are the ones putting on the events that are being gambled on. It\u2019s like a casino that has a poker tournament. They take a cut of every pot, because they\u2019re hosting it. They bring in the dealers, they provide the venues, they make sure no one\u2019s cheating\u2026they take the same cut of the tournament that the leagues are asking for.\u201d Roberts concurs. \u201cThe league shares, we share the same interest in maintaining the integrity of the game,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s more common space there\u2014no difference in terms of our interests\u2026we do share with the league the notion that it\u2019s somewhat unseemly that people are going to make billions of dollars on a product that we\u2019ve created. We fight about enough. It\u2019s sort of refreshing that we can find, without any real difference between us, something that we can try to resolve together.\u201d Of course, the gaming industry demurs. \u201cWe\u2019ve been doing that for 40 years,\u201d Kornegay said. \u201cThis is nothing new to us. We\u2019ve been protecting the games and the product for four decades. Some have been acting like we haven\u2019t been doing this. I met with the leagues 14 years ago in Indianapolis and we told them, at the time, we were on the same side. We want to protect the game like you do. Integrity is the name of the game for us.\u201d Casinos have entire departments who monitor spreads and that are the first to blow the whistle when something doesn\u2019t quite smell right or add up with a spread. \u201cIt\u2019s not periodically or a spot check,\u201d Kornegay said. \u201cThey check everything we do\u2014on our side of the counter and on the other side of the counter. When they talk about the integrity fee, I\u2019ve heard some say if there\u2019s a scandal, the leagues are going to take a hit. Well, we\u2019re going to take a hit too\u2026people aren\u2019t going to want to bet on something that they don\u2019t think is fair and true.\u201d In addition, states such as Nevada already assess significant taxes on casinos and other gambling establishments\u2014in Nevada\u2019s case, a graduated tax rate that tops out at 6.75 percent\u2014that make profit margins smaller. Now, no one\u2019s planning a telethon for the owners of Mandalay Bay or the Bellagio. But an integrity fee would cut into their net. \u201cSports books are amenities to their casinos, not a revenue generator,\u201d Kornegay said. \u201c\u2026.we\u2019re not shoveling out gold every day. It\u2019s a very volatile game. It\u2019s the only casino game that doesn\u2019t have a mathematical probability (favoring the house) in it. We lose a lot.\u201d (The NHL expansion Vegas Golden Knights, which advanced to the Stanley Cup finals Sunday with a Western Conference finals win over Winnipeg, stand to provide a rare but nonetheless bracing financial hit to sports books like Kornegay\u2019s.) We are just at the beginning of this, of course, and there\u2019s no guarantee that legalizing betting is going to slay the economic golden goose. There could well be unintended positives, too. (Bookmakers, for example, are going to have to market their services on a larger scale , which could produce larger revenue streams for leagues and their teams.) After all: the only thing left in Pandora\u2019s jar\/box after she opened it was hope. \u201cAdam is, arguably, the smartest person I\u2019ve ever met,\u201d Ganis said. \u201cAdam Silver is brilliant. He\u2019ll figure this out. But it needs to be figured out.\u201d *** Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

A GoFundMe account has been established with a goal to raise $1 million to sculpt and erect a life-size statue of James in Akron, where he began his basketball career before becoming a superstar with the Cleveland Cavaliers. Aaron Carey, who like James played at Akron St. Vincent-St. Mary High School, began the campaign to raise money to honor the three-time NBA champion. \u201cWe want to do this with the fans,\u201d Carey told the Akron Beacon-Journal . \u201cWe want fans to be able to thank LeBron for what he has done for Akron and the Cavs.\u201d Carey told the newspaper he has been in contact with artist Omri Amrany, who has created statues for basketball greats Michael Jordan, Shaquille O\u2019Neal, Magic Johnson and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. James was touched by the gesture. \u201cFirst of all, thank you,\u201d he said Monday when informed of the movement. \u201cIt would be cool, not only for myself, but for my family and all the people that had anything to do with this journey thus far. I\u2019m appreciative even of the thought.\u201d The 33-year-old is trying to advance to the Finals for the eighth straight time. To do that, the Cavaliers must eliminate the Boston Celtics, who have a 2-1 lead in the best-of-seven series entering Monday\u2019s Game 4. An initial rendering of a possible statue by Amrany shows James soaring toward the basket, with his right arm cocked back to deliver a dunk while wearing his signature Nikes and his No. 23 high school jersey. Carey said a site for the statue has not been finalized. \u201cWe really want this to be in Akron,\u201d he said. \u201cWe talked to (Cavs owner) Dan Gilbert and he wants to put one up in Akron after LeBron retires.\u201d James laughed when asked if he had a preference on how the statue would depict him. \u201cI don\u2019t have a particular pose in mind,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s the thought that counts, it\u2019s pretty cool.\u201d Carey said a marketing campaign is underway to attract donors with deep pockets. The first 15 donors to contribute $30,000 or more would receive a limited edition miniature replica of the statue, signed by the artist."},{"id":40424,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/das-top-15-rankings-week-may-21","date":"2018-05-21","title":"DA's Top 15 Rankings: Oracle advantage helps Warriors re-claim top spot","content":" 1) Golden State (2-1) [2]: Warriors broke the all-time record for consecutive home playoff wins with their 16th straight Sunday over Houston , moving past the Chicago Bulls, who won 15 straight at home over the 1990 and 1991 playoffs.

It is certainly for seeing the guys who do deign to play against one another compete, and potentially change some minds, such as last year, when the University of Utah\u2019s Kyle Kuzma shot the ball from deep better than he had in three seasons with the Utes and became a definite first-round possibility. But the Combine is also for the interviews\u2014each team can interview up to 18 players. Teams interview players in different ranges, from those they\u2019re very interested in taking in the first round to those who likely would just be training camp and\/or summer league team invitees. Last week provided some impressive interactions between players and teams, and a lot of funny ones, as happens every year. So we asked a bunch of teams to share some of the best answers they got from players during the interviews, to provide a sense of who at least gave some thought to what they wanted to say beforehand, and who displayed an acuity to think on their feet. Among those who came across as the best interviews, per league sources, were Bamba (\u201chands down,\u201d one source said), Alabama guard Collin Sexton (\u201cedge and confidence came through in his interview,\u201d another team\u2019s official said, Duke\u2019s Wendell Carter, Maryland forward Bruno Fernando (\u201cimpressive,\u201d per another source), Tulane\u2019s Melvin Frazier (\u201cvery honest,\u201d one team official said) and Missouri forward Michael Porter, Jr. Then, there were the more light-hearted exchanges. One player quizzed his prospective team, going down the line asking \u201cwho are you guys? And describe what you do for your organization?\u201d \u201cFirst time I\u2019ve heard that question from a player in 25 years,\u201d a longtime team executive said. The Suns, according to a source, interviewed a player who is a projected top five pick\u2014which made sense, considering Phoenix has the top pick in the Draft after winning the Lottery. The player told the assembled front office and coaches, \u201dI\u2019d love to play for the Phoenix Suns. I\u2019m not just saying that because you guys have the number one pick\u2014I really feel like I\u2019m the best player in the Draft and the best fit for your roster. I\u2019d be saying that even if you guys didn\u2019t have the number one pick. I don\u2019t care where I get picked\u2014I just want to be in Phoenix.\u201d It was impressive. After a beat, Suns GM Ryan McDonough answered: \u2018Great. We also have the 16th pick. Do you want to try to work something out so we can pick you at 16?\u2019 Player: Silence. Followed by the room breaking up. Another player, likely to go in the top half of the first round, told a team that he played to about 90 percent of his potential each night in college. To which one of the team\u2019s officials asked him if he planned to continue doing that in the NBA, \u201cbecause after taxes, that meant roughly 45 percent,\u201d the official said. Villanova big Omari Spellman surprised one team by breaking out a poem he\u2019d written shortly after President Trump was elected in 2016. \u201cReally deep,\u201d one of the team\u2019s officials recalled. Michigan\u2019s Mo Wagner told Knicks officials that he loves playing at Madison Square Garden. He told them that his college coach, John Beilein, often got on him during film sessions, but it took him a while to realize that it was because Beilein cared about him and thought he was worth investing the time. Wagner also told the Knicks he was really excited to meet new Coach David Fizdale. When asked why, Wagner laughed and said \u2018take that for data!,\u2019 recalling Fizdale\u2019s famous postgame rant last year after a tough playoff loss to the Spurs. Then there were the two players who each told a team they hope to become general managers when they\u2019re done playing. \u201cLove that answer,\u201d said the team\u2019s general manager. * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

From Noah Knobloch: I like the concept. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s likely. TwitterWorld is agog, of course, that Boogie unfollowed the Pelicans\u2019 Instagram account last week and took that as a sure sign he\u2019s leaving town in July (though he told The Undefeated\u2019s Marc Spears it wasn\u2019t that simple). And, while New Orleans definitely wants Cousins back next season, the Pels are not just capped out, they were right at the tax threshold this season, and have $85 million already committed for 2018-19 in just five players\u2014Jrue Holiday ($26 million), Anthony Davis ($25 million), Solomon Hill ($12.7 million), Nikola Mirotic ($12.5 million) and E\u2019Twaun Moore ($8.8 million). Then they have to re-sign Rajon Rondo, which won\u2019t break the bank but will almost certainly be well in excess of the $3.3 million bargain basement deal he had to take this past season. So: it\u2019s not going to be easy to re-sign Cousins, I know. But New Orleans wants badly to bring him back. Having Mirotic for a full season next year will allow Alvin Gentry the flexibility to not have to play Davis and Cousins together all the time; Cousins, certainly at the beginning of next season, isn\u2019t going to be a 30-minute player anyway; he could play in short bursts next to both Davis and\/or Mirotic depending on matchups. As for the Cavs, I\u2019m not sure that LeBron would view Cousins, coming off a serious injury, as a significant upgrade (and it bears mentioning that James and Thompson have the same agent\u2014though sending Thompson to play with Davis for the next two years wouldn\u2019t be exactly exiling him to Siberia). Boogie could definitely help LeBron, though, and as the Cavs don\u2019t exactly play at a frantic pace (12th during the regular season), stylistically it would make some sense. Cousins showed he and Davis could play together effectively; no reason he couldn\u2019t do the same with Kevin Love, with each able to stretch defenses out to the three-point line. But the Cavs are already at the cap for next season and that doesn\u2019t even count James\u2019s player option at $35 million\u2014which, I know, he\u2019s going to decline to again hit unrestricted free agency. the money would be a difficult match for Cleveland and Cousins, even if he took a LeBron Discount. Cleveland would have to commit at least three years to Cousins under CBA rules in a sign-and-trade deal. The market for marginal centers (Mozgov, Mahinmi) was $16 million per two years ago; the Heat gave Hassan Whiteside $24.5 million per. It would be hard to expect Boogie not to view Whiteside\u2019s deal as his floor, not the ceiling. This week\u2019s Kawhi offer involves\u2026chowdah. From Josh Mains: Josh, you sent your e-mail in before the start of the Eastern Conference finals , but even before that series started, there was\/is no way Boston deals Horford for anyone, including Kawhi. Kawhi is a better player than Al. I\u2019m not arguing that. But Horford does so many unsaid and unseen things that facilitate winning, and he does all of it without a minute\u2019s complaint about more time, shots, etc. No insult meant to Aron Baynes, but he can do what he does for Boston, mainly because Al Horford is starting. So your proposal is a non-starter, to me (not to mention that the Spurs believe strongly that Dejounte Murray is going to be a star in his own right at point guard, and thus wouldn\u2019t have the inclination to move Leonard for Rozier\u2014who has been brilliant, no doubt, in the postseason). I have written, and still believe, that Philly can put the most interesting assets on the table for Leonard\u2014the 10 pick this year and a package of players that could involve damn near everyone other than Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid\u2014any combination of Markelle Fultz, Robert Covington and\/or Dario Saric, for example. A sad Raptors fan. Seriously. From Tim Boonstra: That\u2019s cold. I\u2019d call HR. Anthony\u2019s radar detected a ping that didn\u2019t seem normal. From Anthony Garcia:  Well, Ant, your sleuthing skills weren\u2019t completely off. That particular night was Curry\u2019s first game back since suffering his knee injury five weeks earlier \u2014a rather important story in my line of work. That he came back, off the bench, and immediately jumped right back in like he hadn\u2019t missed a minute was rather impressive, and significant for the Dubs\u2019 hopes of repeating\u2014which is another rather important story in my line of work. So I was eager to talk with Steph about all of it, and I think people watching at home, or online, or in bars, or wherever, were eager to hear from him. I don\u2019t begrudge Barry wanting to dap up Steph or give him props\u2014elite athlete to elite athlete. I get it. Their experiences are different than those of the rest of us, and Barry is a big hoops fan; he used to come to Kings games a lot during the Webber Years. I just think there\u2019s a place for those kinds of reunions\/tributes, and it\u2019s not when the camera people and I are on the #@%^%$$ court, clearly waiting to do our #@$%%^^ walkoff interview!

If your e-mail is funny, thought-provoking or snarky, we just might publish it! (Last week\u2019s averages in parenthesis) 1) James Harden (29.3 ppg, 6.3 rpg, 6.3 apg,.469 FG, .857 FT): Has followed a similar pattern in each of Houston\u2019s three playoff series so far this season: a massive game one scoring performance in excess of 40 points, followed by good but not as dominant games through the rest of the series. 2) LeBron James (34.5 ppg, 7.5 rpg, 12 spg, .585 FG, .650 FT): Posted his 23rd postseason game with 40 or more points (42) in Cleveland\u2019s Game 2 Eastern Conference finals loss to Boston last week. It was the 73rd time overall in his career that James has cracked the 40-point plateau. 3) Anthony Davis: Season complete. 4) Kevin Durant (33.3 ppg, 4 rpg, 2.3 apg, .529 FG, 1.000 FT): As locked in as you can be offensively against the Rockets, who really can\u2019t do much to keep him from his spots\u2014though it does make Golden State much more of an isolation team than normal, which is not how the Warriors normally roll. 5) Russell Westbrook: Season complete. 41 \u2013 Margin of defeat by Houston in Game 3 of the Western Conference finals Sunday at Golden State\u2014simultaneously the biggest margin of victory in a postseason game in Warriors history and the largest margin of defeat in a postseason game in Rockets history. 910 \u2013 Career games, all with the Seattle\/Oklahoma City franchise, played by forward Nick Collison, who announced his retirement last week after 15 NBA seasons. He leaves as one of the most respected players in the team\u2019s history and is one of just five players who\u2019ve spent the last 15 years with the same franchise, joining Dallas\u2019 Dirk Nowitzki (20 consecutive seasons with the Mavericks), the Spurs\u2019 Tony Parker (17 seasons with San Antonio) and Manu Ginobili (16) and Miami\u2019s Udonis Haslem (15). 2 \u2013 Remaining active players in the league\u2014Kevin Durant and Jeff Green\u2014who played games in Seattle (sniff), after Collison\u2019s retirement. Durant and Green played their rookie seasons (2007-08), in the Emerald City, which was the Sonics\u2019 last there before the league approved the relocation of the team to Oklahoma City. 1) The Suns have had a rough go of it lately, as we all know\u2014some of it out of their hands, but much of it their own doing. Nonetheless, everyone deserves..a moment in the sun (don\u2019t judge me at 6:58 a.m. Eastern), and Phoenix got it last Tuesday in the Lottery, getting the top pick in the Draft for the first time in franchise history. For a team that lost the coin flip that would have brought Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to town in 1969, that\u2019s a long time to wait to get another crack at it. 2) \u201cTLue, Im\u2019ma be a little late for practice tomorrow \u2026\u201d . 3) This just keeps continuing one of the great careers at this kid\u2019s age in international basketball history. 4) Very poignant read on what happened to some fans after their halfcourt shots during NBA games hit the bottom of the net. It\u2019s not all happy, and it\u2019s not all sad. Which is life, right? 1) RIP, Bret Bearup. Knowledgeable and funny, the former Kentucky player was an executive for the Nuggets for many years and had friends all around the league who appreciated his wry takes on basketball and the world. He will be missed. 2) This is sad and weird. 3) I\u2019m happy for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, who got married over the weekend. I just didn\u2019t spend a moment of my time watching their wedding or caring about it. Please continue to get off my lawn. * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

Each is grounded, given more to cracking a joke than cussing someone out. Each has a well-earned reputation as a well-mannered, thoughtful guy. But each hides, under the surface, a bubbling cauldron, a nasty streak\u2014what used to be called the \u201cred ass\u201d\u2014that comes out at peak moments of competition, of anger, of passion. Kerr cracks the occasional clipboard. And so it was that after Steph Curry hit his seventh or eighth straight shot in the third quarter of what became a record-breaking 41-point Game 3 demolition of the Rockets, culminating a 96-hour stretch during which Curry\u2019s 2 of 13 three-point shooting combined in Games 1 and 2 against Houston had been analyzed and massaged and hot taked to within an inch of his life, but had been silenced by Curry\u2019s 35-point smackdown in response, that Curry took out his mouthpiece and yelled, \u2018this is my (bleeping) house\u201d , not that anyone could hear him amid the bedlam at Oracle Arena. Afterward, he said his mother, Sonya, had chided him and said he needed to wash out his mouth with soap. But while the outburst was profane (\u201cRiley, I hope you weren\u2019t watching,\u201d fellow Splash Brother Klay Thompson joked in the locker room, referring to Curry\u2019s 5-year-old daughter), it wasn\u2019t especially out of character. Curry is a figurative killer on the floor, a destroyer of opponent worlds who wants to win, bad, and who wants to beat back the challenge that Houston, which won 65 games this season , the most in the league, and that hasn\u2019t been shy about its dogged pursuit of the defending champions. You don\u2019t win two league MVP awards by age 28 if you aren\u2019t a competitive little cuss. It\u2019s how Curry got back in five weeks from a Grade 2 MCL sprain of his left leg to return to the Warriors for their second-round win over New Orleans. It\u2019s what keeps him from being embarrassed as the Rockets put him in endless screen and rolls, making him guard either James Harden or Chris Paul one on one. (He hasn\u2019t done badly at all against them, even as the effort he\u2019s had to put out on defense could well have sapped his legs offensively). When he sat down before Game 3, he displayed no true concern about his knee or his shot\u2014the knee having been worked out strenuously by the Warriors\u2019 medical and training staffs, along with Kerr\u2019s personal trainer, Brandon Payne, during Curry\u2019s rehab. \u201cI\u2019m convinced he\u2019s 100 percent,\u201d Payne said Sunday morning. Curry convinced the rest of us a little later, using the derivative adverb form. Me: So, totally removed from this: I heard you killed it when your team made its presentation to buy the Panthers. Stephen Curry: That\u2019s still kind of an ongoing process. Very eye opening process to be a part of. Me: What was different in that process as opposed to coming at things as a player? SC: I think just understanding the full scope of what the business side means. It was an opportunity to understand how to run a franchise\u2014not to run a franchise\u2014but the background, the details, all the different hands at play, especially when it comes to Charlotte, being the city that I grew up in. So understanding more so about how the community and the fan base, how it\u2019s interacting with the organization, the upside of what that could mean down the road, obviously partnering with the NFL, how the NFL is growing from a fan and a game interaction type of standpoint, there\u2019s a lot going on when you think about owning a franchise. Pretty educational experience. Me: Do you get, almost, offended when someone asks you\u2019re having a problem shooting or if something\u2019s wrong after a bad game or two? SC: That\u2019s a strong word. I find it amusing, because, one, there\u2019s nothing that anybody can ask me or tell me that I haven\u2019t already been thinking about myself when it comes to how I\u2019m playing, what I need to do better. The consistent thing is I\u2019ll never lose confidence in myself when I\u2019m out there on the floor. That\u2019s why I shoot the shots that I do; that\u2019s why I play the way that I play. Beyond that, it\u2019s part of the game. And I have high expectations for myself, and I know I set lofty goals when it comes to shooting the basketball. And if I don\u2019t meet that standard every night there\u2019s going to be questions about why this, why that. We\u2019re in the Western Conference finals. We have to play well for us to get to that next level. Me: Houston\u2019s got a really good defense, but while they have good size on the wings and especially with Clint Capela in the back, they\u2019re not an overly long team. What do they do so well defensively? SC: I think it\u2019s just their switching. They try to interrupt your flow by putting a body at every interaction, every screen, between the ball, off the ball. It\u2019s what we\u2019ve done for years, where we try just to kill the flow. Not allow as many passes or ball movement. They have pretty good versatility. They may not be the longest group from top to bottom, but the versatility of having guys that can guard multiple positions, that helps them. They\u2019re tough, and obviously, what Clint Capela can do in the paint, protecting the rim. I feel like it\u2019s just one of those things where it\u2019s a matter of whose will is going to win over the course of seven games. Me: Does it feel weird that you guys did what you were supposed to do\u2014win one on the road\u2014and yet before Game 3 it was all gloom and doom because of what happened in Game 2? SC: It\u2019s probably two things. One, for us as a team, we haven\u2019t been in the experience of being on the road to start a series. That dynamic is different. It\u2019s kind of been our pattern, in most series we play in, we win the first two games at home, go on the road and split, and come back and win Game 5. So if you just reverse the pattern, we\u2019re right where we want to be. It\u2019s just a bad feeling to win Game 1 the way we did, how well we played, and Game 2 happens, they came out with force and we don\u2019t answer it. It wasn\u2019t like, from our standpoint, it wasn\u2019t anything like the game plan or much different besides a couple of momentum plays where we gave them confidence and they took it and ran with it. A lot of guys played well. It\u2019s a weird feeling but we know when we get back to locking in on both sides of the ball, paying attention to what they do well and try to stop it, play off of the home crowd, we should be in good shape. Me: Are you at this time of the year communicating with Brandon (Payne) or the other guys on your personal team to see if they see anything, or do you say \u2018I\u2019ve got this; I don\u2019t want to hear from you?\u2019 SC: A little bit of both. I worked out with Brandon before we left on the road trip. For the most part, there\u2019s noise all over the place. As long as I\u2019m locked down with my guys here in the locker room and on the practice court, I should be in good shape. It\u2019s rare that what I do has to fold into what we\u2019re doing as a team. And obviously, the only other thing somebody\u2019s gotta tell me is \u2018you have to play better.\u2019 Me : Did anybody do that? SC: Oh, I\u2019ve got plenty of people who do that, shoot it with me straight. Me: Who are the ones you listen to? SC: My wife, and probably my parents the most. \u2018Cause they\u2019re the ones at my house. (Laughs) Me: Why is it that when your team struggles, it always shows up with turnovers? It\u2019s not like you miss a bunch of free throws or play horrible defense; it\u2019s always a bunch of turnovers. SC: I think the story of Game 2 was the first quarter and the seven turnovers we had. They weren\u2019t ones that were aggressive; they were all passive, being indecisive, rushing. That set the tone for how we played at the offensive end. We had a bunch of defensive breakdowns, but I think our morale was killed early; we didn\u2019t have the right juice or mojo. I don\u2019t know what it is about that specific part of the game. We try to involve a lot of ball movement, and there\u2019s a lot of organized chaos in how we run our transition offense and stuff like that. But we have smart players who know how to take care of the ball. It\u2019s just a bad habit to break, and you have to do it if you want to be great. Me: Is Houston the biggest challenge to you in the West during this run? SC: I mean, we were down 3-1 against the Thunder in the same series. Think about where we are right now at this point. It\u2019s a different conversation because we started on the road, All the noise around Houston throughout the course of the season and being on a colliding path (with them) all year. There\u2019s a lot built into hyping this series, and it should be. Me: You\u2019ve got this chance to repeat, you got relatively healthy as a team. Nobody\u2019s repeated since Miami. On the list of things you can accomplish, does that have any bearing or impact? SC: I think it does, because if we win it this year, that\u2019s what that means. It\u2019s something we\u2019ve never done before. This is our second crack at it. Historically, throughout the years, I can\u2019t remember the exact number, but I know it\u2019s single digits how many teams have repeated in the league. We know how hard it is. We always talk about San Antonio, a team that won five of them but never two in a row. It\u2019s totally different circumstances you have to overcome to win a championship one time, much less two in a row. We understand the moment. That\u2019s how we got to this point. But, yeah, that means something. We know how hard it is, and it\u2019s a challenge we haven\u2019t accomplished. Me: I\u2019m trying to come up with the proper way to ask this. There was another school shooting Friday, this one in Houston. When you have to be locked in as much as you have to be this time of year, is it difficult to process your feelings about tragedies like that\u2014because you have to be human. Do you allow that to impact you the way it would normally? SC: That\u2019s a great question. I\u2019ve been in this situation, playing basketball. It\u2019s my job. It\u2019s what I love to do. In the grand scheme of life, win, lose or draw, it\u2019s not the end of the world. When I get to the playoffs, I try to shut out as much as possible. This is a three-month period that means a lot to me and the people around me, and I want to be locked in during that time. But life doesn\u2019t stop for us. When you hear about stories like the Santa Fe shooting, or any type of social unrest, you can\u2019t be numb to it. You have to have that process of talking about it with your family. Everybody has a different way of dealing with those types of situations. To me, you want to be able to let life happen, but understand when it\u2019s time to play, it doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t give every bit of my attention and effort or whatever to the court. But make sure that people who depend on me for that type of emotional support (after tragedy) that I\u2019m available for them. Me: The Rockets seem to be willing to live with KD isoed at the elbow. What\u2019s the sweet spot between letting him attack and everybody touching the ball and the flow, because that\u2019s what you guys do? SC: We\u2019ve done it before. I think it\u2019s just a matter of not losing our identity because of how fast we\u2019re playing, creating those possessions when the ball is moving from side to side and everybody\u2019s touching it and being aggressive. What Houston did in Game 1 and Game 2 was Trevor Ariza, Eric Gordon, P.J. Tucker, they got the ball in their hands and they made plays. We\u2019ve got guys like that, as well\u2014Andre (Iguodala), Klay, Draymond (Green), myself, Shaun (Livingston) as well. DWest coming off the bench. As long as we all get our touches and be aggressive, everybody\u2019s looking to score, KD\u2019s going to get his. I\u2019m going to get mine, everybody\u2019s going to get touches and the opportunity to make a play. Me: So, if you get three simultaneous messages from Sonya Curry, Dell Curry and Ayesha Curry that you\u2019re not playing that well, which one do you pay the most attention to? SC: Oh, my wife, for sure. My wife, for sure. Because I would never, ever want to disappoint her. She\u2019s supportive. She shoots it to me straight, that\u2019s the amazing thing, whether I play well or not. I don\u2019t get too big a head or too down on myself. \u2013Lakers rookie Kyle Kuzma ( @kylekuzma ), Friday, 8:11 p.m., throwing IT sized shade at his (currently) Lakers teammate. \u201cI really wanted to get up and leave at that point and demand a recount.\u201d \u2013Mavericks Vice President of Basketball Operations Michael Finley,  to the Dallas Morning News , after the Mavs fell from third to fifth in the upcoming Draft following last week\u2019s Lottery. \u201cThere are some things that you are going to have to give up to be a No. 1, No. 2 team in field-goal percentage defense.

Al Horford, meanwhile, has got to rock. Rock, as in be there for the Celtics in whatever and however many ways they need him. And they most definitely need him. Rock, as the steadying veteran presence Horford is, in the eyes of virtually everyone who watches Boston play or has a sense of that roster\u2019s chemistry. Rock, as in the player his coaches and his teammates lean on precisely at times such as this, regardless of what\u2019s gone on before. The back story of Horford vs. LeBron James and the Cavaliers in the playoffs is not a pretty one. In four previous encounters \u2014 in 2009, 2015 and 2016 while with Atlanta, in 2017 after signing with Boston \u2014 Horford\u2019s teams went 1-16. For all of his individual and group success to that point, including four All-Star selections, Horford averaged just 10.9 points and 4.3 rebounds in the four series. He had an average plus\/minus of minus-53 per series, according to basketball-reference.com. The narrative changed as the current East finals began. Horford scored 20 points in less than 28 minutes of Game 1 , helping Boston to a blowout victory. Even with Cleveland coach Tyronn Lue tabbing center Tristan Thompson to match up with Horford in Game 2  \u2014 Thompson had a history of strong defense against the Celtics veteran \u2014 Horford managed 15 points, 10 rebounds, two steals and two blocks as Boston won again. In two games, he shaved 31 points off that negative plus\/minus. This was the Horford people on both sides of the equation, his teams and the other guys, had been lauding for years. Ask any of them about the 6-foot-10 son of former NBA player Tito Horford and you\u2019d wind up with what sounded like blurbs for the back cover of a best seller: \u201cAl\u2019s important to everything we do,\u201d Celtics coach Brad Stevens said after Game 1. \u201cEvery minute of every day, whether it\u2019s the walk-through before, the meeting before, yesterday\u2019s practice, yesterday\u2019s film session. Again, he\u2019s kind of our stabilizer and the guy that we all look to and we take great comfort that he\u2019s on our team.\u201d James, before the series began, said: \u201cHe\u2019s their rock. [He] always is even keel. \u2026 He\u2019s been in big games, in big series. If things get chaotic, they know they can always go to Al to do something.\u201d Cavs shooter Kyle Korver, who became an All-Star himself in 2015 alongside Horford on Atlanta\u2019s 60-22 team, said: \u201cAl is the ultimate teammate. Doesn\u2019t say a lot, so when he says something it means something. \u2026 He\u2019s like a Swiss army knife \u2014 he does everything. The thing that\u2019s stood out for me in these playoffs is how aggressive he\u2019s been to score \u2026 just because he knows the team needs it a little more right now.\u201d After averaging 12.9 points in the regular season, Horford had upped his scoring to 17.1 through the Celtics\u2019 first 14 playoff games. What he had gone through in the past against James and the Cavaliers seemed to add context and urgency, and a chance for Horford finally to make things right. Then came Game 3, when Horford took only four shots and scored seven points. His drop in production was a symptom of what ailed Boston Saturday more than a cause. Thrown by the Cavaliers\u2019 torrid start, the Celtics stopped moving the ball and settled too often for low-reward, pull-up jump shots. Still, without Kyrie Irving, Horford has been the proverbial head of Boston\u2019s snake, so stopping him for the 30 minutes he played made Cleveland\u2019s wire-to-wire rout easier. \u201cThe ball was kind of stagnant last game,\u201d Morris said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get it from side to side. Once we move the ball, we\u2019ll have a better chance of getting him involved more and driving [past] close-outs, things like that.\u201d While Horford was staying calm and trying to help his younger teammates reconcile their 9-0 home record with their 1-5 road mark, Morris again steered pressure his way by blaming himself for James\u2019 all-around excellence in Game 3. Much as he had on the eve of the series, he embraced the big challenge. \u201cPersonally, I think I did a [garbage] job defensively against LeBron,\u201d Morris said. \u201cHe was just too comfortable when I was guarding him. I made myself very vulnerable on screens, and I just wasn\u2019t disciplined, man. We can\u2019t have that in a game of this magnitude, and it showed. \u201cThat [Boston] team we saw [Saturday], I\u2019m 100 percent sure it won\u2019t be the same team on Monday.\u201d Springing Horford loose to help might matter most.

Stephen Curry's (expletive) house","content":" OAKLAND, Calif. \u2014 It was a moment, to be frozen in time, chilling to witness and stunning to fully understand when it burst upon an unsuspecting audience with gale force. A sequence of dribbling, a drive to the hoop followed by a delicate finger roll for a bucket and then, boom: Steph Curry screamed a bad word. Yes, he did. The religious family man with the innocent face and made-for-Disney image reached deep into his Forbidden Dictionary and found something naughty. Was this a first for him in public view? After a quick first-step left Trevor Ariza choking on exhaust and when he finished at the rim in the third quarter, Curry had an out of body experience and temporarily exhumed himself from Game 3 . While the action moved up-court, he turned and faced the Oracle Arena crowd \u2014 now standing and pulsating and pleading for more, more, more! \u2014 and removed his trusty mouthpiece, pointed both index fingers to the ground and bellowed, with attitude: \u201cThis is my freaking house!\u201d Only he substituted another, ahem, adjective for \u201cfreaking.\u201d He acknowledged afterward, regrettably: \u201cI know, I know. I blacked out.\u201d Point made, though. This was his house, his fans, his game, his turnaround performance of the playoffs and who knows, this could end up being his series as a result. Normally the most vivid expression anyone gets from Curry after a made basket is a playful shimmy shake, which happened on the previous possession, when he isolated on James Harden and splashed a 30-footer. Yes, that shot was satisfying and worth a wiggle. But Curry was feeling it. And he hadn\u2019t felt it for some time, since before the playoffs, since before the knee injury that kept him out for six weeks left him rusty. So there was emotional release coming that was cutting edge for him. This cursing was the sound of relief, from the frustration of all that, a two-time MVP hailed as the finest shooter of our generation suddenly bricking shots from 3 -point range in the Western Conference finals and becoming A Rather Big Topic here against the Rockets. And so \u2026 maybe forgiveness for the potty mouth is in order? Here\u2019s why: Curry was three-for-20 beyond the 3-point stripe in the first two-and-a-half games against Houston, but the script flipped suddenly and sharply in Sunday\u2019s third quarter. He found himself, his stroke, his place in the pecking order, and he kept rolling with it. He hit layups, mid-range jumpers and yes, 3s, and they all came in a rush, a flood that engulfed the Rockets. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen this so many times with Steph,\u201d coach Steve Kerr said. \u201cAll it takes is one. He bounces back from bad games as well as anyone I\u2019ve ever seen. I was never concerned.\u201d He finished with 35 points, including 26 in the second half and the Warriors romped by 41. They\u2019re up 2-1 now, with another home game coming Tuesday. The Warriors have won their last 16 home playoff games, an NBA record. They also just held the high-wire Rockets to 85 points, a low for Houston in these playoffs. They\u2019ve taken two of the three games easily, and in the one they didn\u2019t, Curry wasn\u2019t whole. Well, he seems to be now, and what will that say for the Rockets and the rest of this much-anticipated series that could go flatter than Nebraska? The Warriors had a strong hunch that Curry\u2019s shooting problems were only a phase, and if so, that was Houston\u2019s biggest worry. Until Game 3, the Warriors had plenty of Kevin Durant but not much of anything else. And there was another Curry-fueled issue: The Rockets were purposely running switches that would put him on Harden, the matchup Houston wanted to see and exploit. The Rockets opened the game by constantly pulling these stunts and getting baskets. Kerr called timeout after one switch, where Harden left Curry on an island, and spoke with his player before the huddle. The Warriors made amends for that by having Curry fight through the screens and staying on his man. Yet another problem persisted: Curry missed six of his seven 3-pointers in the first half. \u201cI had the right intentions,\u201d he said. \u201cI had five wide open 3s and only one went in. I knew I had to keep searching and find some openings.\u201d So he kept shooting, no matter the circumstances. It was akin to a camper in the woods furiously trying to light an inferno by rubbing a pair of twigs together. The smoke appeared, then the flame, and the ball finally felt familiar to Curry once again. \u201cI always say you should never lose confidence,\u201d he said. He turned to a common formula that shooters use to find their touch: Go for layups and then short jumpers to regain confidence and keep the defense honest. Then, let it fly from deep. \u201cYou can\u2019t be that great of a scorer without mental toughness,\u201d Draymond Green said, \u201cbecause you\u2019re always going to face obstacles when it comes to shooting. He always has that `next shot\u2019 mentality. Kudos to him. That\u2019s something that\u2019s been the key to his career, his mental toughness. He wouldn\u2019t be who he is today.\u201d What was particularly pleasing for Curry was returning serve to Harden. After repeatedly being victimized by the Rockets\u2019 leading scorer on the other end of the floor, Curry suddenly chopped up Harden. He was isolated on Harden, an average defender at best, and the results were predictable. Curry made 10 of 12 shots in the second half and his 26 points came in only 16 minutes. From that point, it was routine for Curry once again: The shooting, the flow of the game and the energy from the crowd. The fans simply wouldn\u2019t let him drift back into that other world. Everyone had a hunch that it was only a matter of time for Curry, but still. And what does one do when normalcy makes a refreshing return? He breathes easily and lives freely, with emotion, with a snow angel on the court once he landed after a made basket, and of course, the curse word heard \u2018round the arena (and among lip readers around the world). To that, he shrugs. \u201cA lot of it was just talking to myself,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be your biggest fan sometimes. You\u2019ve got to find whatever to get yourself going. I mean obviously it felt good and you want to use that energy to show your teammates that you are here, you\u2019re with them, and get the crowd into it. \u201cYou come into transition and you find an open look and there\u2019s a collective hush in the crowd, especially in this building. It\u2019s a cool moment.\u201d Veteran NBA writer Shaun Powell has worked for newspapers and other publications for more than 25 years.

The Houston Rockets, the team built to unseat the mighty Golden State Warriors, handcrafted by Daryl Morey and coached all season to impose its will on the opposition, was nowhere to be found. \u201cSoft\u201d is the word D\u2019Antoni used, the G-rated version, as it turned out, on a night when even Warriors\u2019 superstar Stephen Curry tiptoed over to the dark side of the English language to describe his mood. Soft is an epic understatement for what the Rockets were in this 126-85 annihilation in Game 3 of the Western Conference finals , a game that swung the momentum in this series dramatically back in the Warriors\u2019 favor as they take a 2-1 lead into Tuesday\u2019s Game 4 . The 41-point margin marked the largest in both Warriors (victory) and Rockets (defeat) playoff history. \u201cA loss is a loss, whether it\u2019s by two or two hundred, it doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Rockets forward Trevor Ariza said. \u201cIt\u2019s only 2-1 right now. We have another game to prepare for and that\u2019s all we can do at this point.\u201d That makes sense if you\u2019re the Rockets and you\u2019re still playing the numbers game that says all you have to do is get one game in Oakland. But you were supposed to be above that. You were supposed to be on the Warriors\u2019 level. Instead, twice already in this series the Rockets have looked like the shell of the team that owned the NBA during the regular season, rattling off a franchise-best 65 wins in the process. They were indeed soft on both ends of the floor in Game 3 and allowed the Warriors to awaken Curry, who erupted for a game-high 35 points after struggling through the first two games of the series. The targeted precision of their offensive and defensive strikes on Curry that flipped the momentum in Game 2 were flicked away this time. Curry went off, the Rockets limped to the finish and only have a day between games to make sense go it all and be ready for the biggest game of their season so far. \u201cWe didn\u2019t switch up into people, we didn\u2019t box off,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said. \u201cIt\u2019s just one thing led to another. Played soft, actually. I mean, you can\u2019t do that with these guys.\u201d And now the Rockets are caught up in the Warriors\u2019 matrix for the next 48 hours. They\u2019ve been smoked twice in three games in this series, have already surrendered the home-court advantage they spent an entire season chasing and securing, and no explanation for how they could play with so little force in a game that required their best. \u201cWell, again, second game was pretty big too and they came out the same way,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said. \u201cIt\u2019s just the way it goes sometimes. It flows like that. But I thought the way we got down early and didn\u2019t do the little things to get us in there, and then we\u2019d have found some more energy. They gave us a haymaker and we went down.\u201d If the Rockets intend to be taken seriously as a championship contender, as a team capable of foiling the Warriors\u2019 plans for a fourth straight Western Conference crown and third NBA title in four seasons, these sorts of performances cannot happen. Game 4 becomes a monumental contest for both sides, the swing game of the series according to Warriors coach Steve Kerr, who insists his team will approach the contest with the appropriate fear needed after the Rockets bounced back to dominate Game 2 after their loss in the opener. The Rockets are playing with fire if they are going to put their entire season on the line Tuesday. D\u2019Antoni pulled his regulars in plenty of time to make sure they would be rested for that showdown. \u201cI could have come in here and we could have lost by two points and we could have played guys, 40 or 45 minutes and be dead tired,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, we\u2019re not. Let\u2019s see what we can do Tuesday.\u201d Not that the game needed any extra pressure. But the difference between these two teams this time of year couldn\u2019t be more stark in contrast. The Warriors, who won their 16th consecutive home playoff game to eclipse the Chicago Bulls\u2019 record of 15 over the 1990 and 1991 postseasons, thrive in these high-pressure situations. They are made for these moments. They\u2019ve been battle tested in each of the previous three seasons in ways this Rockets team simply has not, what with all of their newness. Assuming the same reflex that worked in the aftermath of Game 1 will work again now is being wildly presumptive for a team with no track record of overcoming these sorts of odds. Perhaps that\u2019s why there was absolutely no dispute of D\u2019Antoni\u2019s words from his starts after Sunday night\u2019s debacle. Both James Harden and Chris Paul agreed with D\u2019Antoni\u2019s \u201csoft\u201d label and his overall assessment that his team failed to show anything close to the sort of energy a desperate team needs to. \u201cCoach is right,\u201d Paul said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to be better. We\u2019ve got to come out more aggressive \u2026 we knew we were going get a great game from them being back here at home, but we\u2019ve got to be better in Game 4.\u201d Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

Asked on Sunday if he\u2019s thinking about a lineup change, Celtics coach Brad Stevens played coy. \u201cI think you do that every day,\u201d he said. But you can be sure that Stevens has thought about it much more than usual in the wake of his team\u2019s 30-point loss in Game 3. And you can be almost as sure that Aron Baynes will be in the Celtics starting lineup for Monday\u2019s Game 4 (8:30 p.m. ET, ESPN). Stevens has been willing to change his starting lineup all season. When the Celtics won 16 straight games in October and November, Baynes was in and out of the lineup, exchanging spots with Marcus Morris. Seemingly, the Baynes-Morris decision was based on matchups, with Baynes in the lineup against bigger, less mobile frontlines. But Stevens doesn\u2019t put it like that. \u201cIt\u2019s all about trying to figure out if you can be successful offensively and defensively,\u201d Stevens said of lineup decisions last week. \u201cSometimes you feel like you can be a little bit more successful on one end than the other, but both ends have to be taken into account.\u201d Through the first two rounds, the Cleveland Cavaliers had been more successful, especially offensively, playing small, with Kevin Love at center and, essentially, four shooters around LeBron James. Their most-used lineup \u2013 George Hill, J.R. Smith, Kyle Korver, James and Love \u2013 had scored 126 points per 100 possessions in its 110 minutes together . The Cavs started that way in Game 1 and the Celtics opened with Morris instead of Baynes (who started all five games of the conference semifinals) to match up. Advantage: Boston. The Celtics led 20-7 before any substitutions were made in Game 1 , which they won by 25. In Game 2 , Tristan Thompson was in and Korver was out. The Cavs still lost, but the start wasn\u2019t so bad and the numbers when they played big vs. small were pretty good. Through two games, the Cavs had been outscored by 38 points and were a minus-7 in 29 minutes with a frontline of James, Love and Thompson . But Cleveland had outscored Boston, 31-18, in 12 minutes with James, Love and Thompson on the floor against Boston\u2019s small frontline of Morris and Al Horford. Just 12 minutes is a small sample size, but small sample sizes are all you get in a playoff series. And with the big vs. small success in mind, the Cavs started the same group in Game 3 . Having won the first two games, the Celtics didn\u2019t make any changes either. Game 3 was a blowout and, essentially, nothing worked for the Celtics. But the Cavs\u2019 big frontline was a problem again, particularly when the Celtics played small. Cleveland outscored Boston 22-8 in just nine minutes with James, Love, Thompson, Morris and Horford on the floor with no Celtics center (Baynes or Greg Monroe). In playing big vs. small, the Cavs have been good on both ends of the floor. Thompson has made himself useful on offense as a screen-setter, as a roll man and as an offensive rebounder. \u201cHe might not always score the basketball, but he\u2019s going to get us extra possessions,\u201d Love said of Thompson after Game 3. \u201cHe\u2019s going to make the hustle plays, and he\u2019s going to do a lot of stuff that might not necessarily show up in the box score.\u201d But the bigger difference compared to how the Cavs have played overall has been on defense, where Boston has scored just 26 points (on an effective field goal percentage of 33 percent) in the 21 minutes with James, Love, Thompson, Morris and Horford on the floor without a Boston center. Over 87 possessions with Thompson as his primary defender, Horford (the Celtics\u2019 most efficient scorer in the postseason) has taken just six shots. Does Baynes, averaging six points per game this season, fix that? The Celtics have been better offensively with Baynes on the floor this series , but his presence doesn\u2019t necessarily free Horford of Thompson, because the Cavs have been willing to defend Baynes with Love . And generally, Baynes\u2019 value comes on defense. In the regular season, Boston allowed just 97.0 points per 100 possessions with him on the floor. That was the lowest on-court DefRtg among players who averaged at least 15 minutes in 40 or more games. With Baynes and Horford on the floor together, the Celtics allowed just 95.0 points per 100 possessions , the lowest mark for any two-man combination in the league that played as many minutes as they did. Assuming Baynes is the starting center on Monday with Horford at power forward and Terry Rozier at point guard, Stevens has a decision to make with the other two players on the floor, some combination of Morris, Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum. In the regular season, Morris came off the bench when Baynes started. Tatum has started all 95 games he\u2019s played this season, while Brown has only come off the bench in Games 2-4 of the conference semifinals, when he was on a minutes limit after suffering a hamstring injury in Game 7 of the first round. The Celtics have played just 31 minutes (regular season and playoffs) with Baynes, Horford, Brown and Morris on the floor without Tatum, and just 70 minutes with Baynes, Horford, Morris and Tatum on the floor without Brown. But defending the Cavs begins with defending James, and that has been Morris\u2019 job. He has been the primary defender on James for 101 of a possible 217 possessions in this series, with Brown (35) or Tatum (6) defending James for just 41 possessions total. In each of the last four halves, with the Cavs playing big, Baynes has been the first sub for the Celtics (as early as two and a half minutes into the half). And he\u2019s always replaced Tatum (three times) or Brown, but not Morris. Maybe, because Celtics have been switching most screens in this series, the initial defender on James isn\u2019t as critical as it may seem. And the Brown-Tatum combination offers more offense, important given Baynes\u2019 limitations on that end of the floor. Of course, the Celtics don\u2019t switch with Baynes at center as much as they do with Horford at center. Stevens was asked what would go into deciding who else would be on the floor if, hypothetically, Baynes was in the starting lineup. Would it be determined by the James matchup, by Morris\u2019 comfort in coming off the bench or something else? \u201cThere are two sides of the floor,\u201d Stevens said, maybe downplaying the importance of who\u2019s defending the best player in the world or perhaps just being coy again. \u201cSo there\u2019s a lot that goes into it. We\u2019ll make that decision based on both sides.\u201d Stay tuned. John Schuhmann is a staff writer for NBA.com. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

Three pull-up, mid-range jumpers, with plenty of time left on the shot clock, from three different Celtics. First Jayson Tatum, then Jaylen Brown and Terry Rozier. It didn\u2019t matter that one of the three shots (Rozier\u2019s) went in. What mattered was the quality of the attempts. The Celtics certainly aren\u2019t the Houston Rockets regarding mid-range shots. They were right around the league average (19 percent) in the percentage of their shots that came from between the paint and the 3-point line. But they\u2019re playing the league\u2019s 29th-ranked defense in this series. Better shots can be found with energy and execution. That never came on Saturday. Three shots do not determine a game, but they can exemplify it pretty well. The Celtics started out flat (scoring just four points on their first 13 possessions) and stayed that way in the Cleveland Cavaliers\u2019 116-86 victory , which made this a 2-1 series. Not even Marcus Smart could give his team an energy lift on this night. In fact, he contributed to a turnover (via a miscommunication with Rozier) on his first offensive possession after entering the game midway through the first. By the end of the opening period, Celtics coach Brad Stevens had already turned to Guerschon Yabusele and Greg Monroe to find a spark that would never come. Two teams played this game and the Cavs were clearly better on both ends of the floor, as opposed to Games 1 and 2. Stevens didn\u2019t want to put the 30-point loss (the Celtics\u2019 worst of the season in regard to point differential) all on his guys. \u201cWe were clearly not the harder-playing, more connected team tonight,\u201d he said. \u201cCleveland was, and they deserve all the credit for that. I thought they played a great game. They came out and really moved it and were really tough, got into us defensively.\u201d The start wasn\u2019t everything and Stevens\u2019 team isn\u2019t uncomfortable with early deficits. No team has won more games after trailing by double-digits than the Celtics. They have done so 18 times this season, including in Game 2 of this series, when they came back from an 11-point deficit late in the second quarter. But not once did they look like a team that would make a rally on Saturday. The Cleveland lead was 19 late in the first quarter and was never less than 15 after the 6:50 mark of the second. While it wasn\u2019t all about those first three possessions, Stevens, Tatum and Al Horford all noted the Celtics\u2019 early shot selection, unprompted, after the game. Stevens: \u201cI thought we took a lot of tough pull-ups in that [first] quarter.\u201d Tatum: \u201cEarly in the game, we didn\u2019t get the ball moving side to side. We took a lot of pull-up shots and we just didn\u2019t play like ourselves.\u201d Horford: \u201cI felt like we settled for a lot of mid-range shots.\u201d The Celtics have grown tremendously in the last three weeks, from needing seven games to beat the Milwaukee Bucks in the first round to winning seven of eight en route to a 2-0 lead in the conference finals. They\u2019re the better, tougher and more resilient team in this series. But their margin for error remains thin. The Celtics are prone to droughts offensively and they\u2019re facing the best player in the world. If LeBron James gets some help from his teammates, the Cavs are dangerous. James got that help on Saturday and Cleveland made more 3-pointers (17) than it made in Games 1 and 2 combined (14). The Celtics are now 1-5 on the road in these playoffs, with the only win having come in overtime. They will win this series if they remain undefeated at home, where they\u2019ve been almost 24 points per 100 possessions better than they\u2019ve been on the road, but Stevens was quick to downplay the differential when asked about it on Saturday. \u201cIn my 11 years as a head coach, I probably haven\u2019t talked about road and home five times with our team,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about how you play between the lines. Because I think if you start talking about that, then you find excuses in both places. \u201cWe can\u2019t play like we played tonight no matter where we played. If we would have played in Boston like that, we would have gotten beat.\u201d Of course, by taking care of business at home in Games 1 and 2, the Celtics did give themselves the ability to absorb a loss like this. And maybe the Cavs still win Game 3 against a better effort from Boston. But with how poorly they played, the Celtics certainly helped their opponent get off the mat in this series. The Cavs had a negative point differential for the playoffs coming into Game 3, but they\u2019re now a dangerous team with a 30-point victory in their pocket. \u201cIt just shows when you don\u2019t bring it as a team and you don\u2019t play the way you\u2019re supposed to play,\u201d Horford said, \u201cthese kind of things can happen.\u201d * * * John Schuhmann is a staff writer for NBA.com.

He didn\u2019t take over, force the issue, put the Cleveland Cavaliers\u2019 on his broad back or otherwise go crazy. Rather than posting some stats line for the ages built from crooked numbers, overstuffed categories, and desperation, the Cavaliers star played masterfully against the Boston Celtics on Saturday night at Quicken Loans Arena, but in a more nuanced way. In a way he, too, definitely prefers. Oh James produced his share of marvelous moments in Cleveland\u2019s lopsided-from-the-start 116-86 victory in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference finals . But they were beautiful basketball plays as opposed to superhero exploits. With the Cavs staring into an 0-2 hole in the best-of-seven series as the night began, the likelihood of James having to answer his team\u2019s bat signal in full cowl-scowl-and-score mode seemed great. But when teammates such as George Hill showed newfound aggressiveness early, when erratic gunner J.R. Smith demonstrated his stroke, when big men Kevin Love, Tristan Thompson and Larry Nance Jr. stayed mobile and active, James could cruise in the gear that suits him best: initiating the Cleveland offense without necessarily finishing it. He\u2019s always been a passer first; Magic Johnson by way of Muscle Beach. On the nights things go best for the Cavs, that\u2019s the role in which he thrives. \u201cI think my passing is up there with every other aspect of my game,\u201d James said after scoring 27 points, making eight of his modest 12 field goal attempts while distributing 12 assists. \u201cIt was something I kind of just knew I had when I first started playing the game of basketball, to be able to see things develop before they actually developed. Then it was on me to kind of put the ball on time, on target to my teammates ever since I was a kid, and I started playing at age nine.\u201d Cavs coach Tyronn Lue preceded James in talking with reporters by at least 20 minutes and, yes, he more or less predicted what the four-time Kia MVP would say. \u201cOne thing about it \u2013 he prides himself on \u2018on time, on target,\u2019\u201d Lue said. \u201cAnd when guys are open, he wants to make sure they have it right in their shooting pocket to get their shot off. You could see that with [Kyle] Korver tonight. You could see it with J.R. Kevin had a few that he missed that he normally makes. But he really prides himself on passing on time, on target.\u201d James was asked afterward about several specific deliveries, including a pair of left-handed bounce passes out of double teams that found first Nance, then Thompson for easy baskets. Given that two men on the ball only seems to trigger James\u2019 resourcefulness and creativity in sending it elsewhere, it\u2019s on Celtics coach Brad Stevens now to find ways to snuff such satisfying (for the opposition) plays. \u201cThere\u2019s only one person that can make passes going to his left like that in the league,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve got to do a better job with all of our help and with all of our coverages.\u201d Certain elements of Cleveland\u2019s bounce-back performance were expected. The Cavaliers were going to shoot better from 3-point range if for no other reason than they hardly could shoot worse. After going 14-of-57 in the first two games, they pelted the Celtics by hitting 17-of-34 . Hill was an obvious candidate to boost his results by picking up his pace. With the extra days between Games 2 and 3, Lue and others had implored him to play faster, if only to let the Cavs\u2019 offense get into second and third options ahead of the unforgiving shot clock. And Smith, well, there\u2019s little predictable about his shooting from one game to the next, but it\u2019s reasonable to assume Lue would have had a quick hook for him had he not found his groove. All those things coming together \u2013 against a young Boston team that, on the road in these playoffs, has been a shell of its usual self \u2013 had the Cavaliers humming as if Toronto was in town. Korver got nine of his 14 points in the inconsequential fourth quarter, but all five Cavs starters had reached double figures by the end of the third. There was one more reason James didn\u2019t have to overly extend himself with the ball in his hands: Cleveland perked up defensively against a team that had embarrassed it in the two Boston games. One noticeable adjustment was shifting James\u2019 focus onto Celtics wing Jaylen Brown while putting a little less emphasis on forward Jayson Tatum. Brown was the one who had hurt the Cavs most, particularly early, with 46 points combined in Games 1 and 2. This time, Brown shot 3-of-8 and scored only 10. \u201cWe know Jaylen is a first-quarter player,\u201d Lue said. \u201cHe plays good throughout the game, but he really sets the tone early in that first quarter. So we wanted to do a good job on him. I thought LeBron really did a good job of closing out to him, making him put it on the floor, cutting him off and making him play in the crowd.\u201d James staying engaged and energetic defensively \u2013 he blocked two shots and had a pair of steals \u2013 naturally rubbed off on his teammates. \u201cTremendous connectivity\u201d and \u201cgreater togetherness,\u201d Stevens called it, lauding Cleveland for how thorough and of a piece its game plan was. \u201c Just tried to put myself in position to help our team,\u201d James said. \u201cAs a group, even when things broke down, we just covered for one another. We made them make extra passes. We made them make extra dribbles. We were flying around, and I just happened to be one of the guys on the floor that wanted to fly around as well.\u201d James was done flying around about five minutes into the final quarter. The other Cleveland starters didn\u2019t play at all in that period, and the garbage time offered some low-risk time to Jordan Clarkson, Jeff Green and Nance. James was left, at one point, to play peek-a-boo with his young daughter in the stands at the Q. Which had to be a lot more fun than playing peek-a-boo with whichever Cavaliers teammates were or weren\u2019t going to show up. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

And the action on the floor isn\u2019t too bad either for a series that\u2019s all tied up. Yes, away from the game, these two are now talking a good game. The spice level escalated a bit when Rockets coach Mike D\u2019Antoni said Houston \u201ccan beat anybody, anywhere, anytime\u201d just before the Western Conference finals shifted to Oakland. He presumably means the Rockets can own either of the next two games, or both, at Oracle Arena starting Sunday ( Game 3 on TNT, 8 ET ), where visiting teams are known to suffer badly. And why shouldn\u2019t he feel frisky about that? The Rockets were road-tested all season and into the playoffs and did kick off 2017-18 by spoiling championship ring night for the Warriors here back in October in a distant prelude to the conference finals. Just as well, the Warriors believe their Game 2 issues , mainly a lost touch from deep by Steph Curry and shoddy defense, were nothing but lapses and that a return to normalcy is on tap, even against the team with the NBA\u2019s best record who ran them off the floor three days ago. What say you, Klay Thompson? \u201cI\u2019ll be better. Guarantee it.\u201d And Steve Kerr? \u201cWe\u2019re very confident going into (today).\u201d Surely Draymond Green of all people backed away from saying anything bold, right? \u201cWe\u2019re at our best when we feel threatened. And we feel threatened.\u201d Both teams agree on this much, that the series is about to get tighter and perhaps better because both teams bring out so much in the other. In the process, the usual playoff mainstays, such as home court advantage and adjustments and carryover from one game to the next, could be deemed non-issues. Anything goes, anything\u2019s possible. That said, the Warriors don\u2019t believe the series is in danger of slipping away from them, and if anything feel very much in control because, they say, their imperfections are fixable. The two most glaring ones, Curry\u2019s shooting and defense, are tried and true. How often does Curry go more than a few games with a faulty jumper? And the next time the Warriors\u2019 defense goes a long stretch with constant breakdowns in games of importance will be the first in this era. Perhaps the biggest factor in the Warriors\u2019 favor is they recognize how fatal these imperfections will be if they continue against a team as stacked as the Rockets. They need Curry\u2019s points to serve as a 1-2 punch with Kevin Durant. They need to be at their defensive finest because Houston is bringing James Harden and Chris Paul and also Eric Gordon on fire off the bench. The Warriors\u2019 confidence is not only natural considering they\u2019ve won two titles in three years, but it\u2019s also necessary in this series, which could ultimately decide the next NBA champion. \u201cIt\u2019s time to lock in for the remainder of the series,\u201d said Green. As the Warriors spoke Saturday during practice, Curry put in extra work. He has only a pair of three-pointers in two games, or three fewer than PJ Tucker. Even more, the Rockets are aggressively attacking him defensively, forcing him into switches on the pick and roll that place him in the direct path of Harden in numerous cases, a clear Houston advantage. By forcing him to labor on both ends, the Rockets feel he\u2019ll be one less worry for them, or at least someone who won\u2019t impact the game heavily. So far, he hasn\u2019t. Curry says his knee injury from three months ago is fine, although he\u2019s about to play only his seventh playoff game. If he has no physical limitations as he says, then the Warriors hope it\u2019s just a matter of working off the rust from inactivity. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t need us to create looks for him,\u201d said Green. \u201cHe\u2019s going to do that himself, and we know he will.\u201d It\u2019s all intertwined, the offensive link between Curry, Thompson and Durant. Against all but a handful of teams, the Warriors can easily overcome one of them misfiring or even two. But they\u2019re playing the Rockets, a historical offensive team, and scoring is at a premium if only to keep up. Durant has yet to see any slippage, but Thompson and Curry flopped in Game 2 and the outcome, therefore, was predictable. \u201cI think we\u2019ll be fine,\u201d said Thompson. \u201cAnd once Steph gets a couple of open looks and gets going, he can make any shot in the book.\u201d The bigger worry of the two, the Warriors say, is defense only because the Rockets test those limits. Game 2 showed the damage the Rockets are capable of inflicting if role players take advantage of Harden\u2019s isolation game and hit their shots. Gordon outscored the Warriors\u2019 starting backcourt by himself in Game 2 and is making over half his shots both beyond and within the three-point stripe. He was joined in Game 2 by Tucker and Trevor Ariza piling up points on the confused and suddenly-overmatched Warriors. \u201cWhen you get 22 points from a guy (Tucker) you don\u2019t plan on getting it from, then yeah, (defense) needs to be better,\u201d said Green. The 127 points in Game 2 represented the most given up by the Warriors since a February win against the Clippers; in the post-season they surrendered at least that many only once previously in the last 39 games. \u201cWe\u2019re at our best when we\u2019re getting stops,\u201d said Kerr. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to do a better job of guarding the ball and staying in front, and that eliminates all those corner threes and drive and kicks.\u201d This is a series that for the most part will offer no surprises. Both teams know each other and also reflect each other on offense, with plenty of isolation and deep shooting. The Warriors have rings the Rockets crave yet Houston is built on veterans with Paul and Harden capable of being aces in the clutch. Then it comes down to which team shows fewer bad stretches and plays with more urgency. Well: Golden State, which hasn\u2019t trailed 2-1 in a series since Oklahoma City in 2016 \u2014 which they eventually rallied and won \u2014 is pushing the red alert in a series that\u2019s tied and will be played on their court the next two games. \u201cWhen we\u2019re threatened, we play with great urgency and hustle,\u201d said Thompson. \u201cAlong with our talent, that\u2019s a great combination right there.

He\u2019s lost sleep over it. The Cavs are down 2-0 in the Eastern Conference finals to the Boston Celtics, who can take complete command of the series with a win in Game 3 on Saturday night ( 8:30 ET, ESPN ). Although James has twice overcome 2-0 deficits to win postseason series, that doesn\u2019t make the challenge any easier. \u201cI mean, I lose sleep,\u201d the three-time champion said following the team\u2019s morning shootaround. \u201cAt the end of the day, when you lose any game in the postseason, it\u2019s never comfort.

James also lost four series when falling behind 2-0. Game 3 essentially comes down to a must-win situation for the Cavs. No team has overcome a 3-0 deficit (131-0). James is trying to reach the NBA Finals for the eighth straight time, a feat accomplished only by Celtics greats Bill Russell, Sam Jones, Frank Ramsey and Tommy Heinsohn. Of course, with James potentially becoming a free agent this summer, Game 3 carries even more weight for the Cavs."},{"id":40479,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/george-hill-needs-step-order-cavaliers-avoid-3-0-hole","date":"2018-05-19","title":"George Hill needs to step up if the Cavaliers hope to avoid 3-0 hole against Celtics","content":" CLEVELAND \u2014 George Hill is a college graduate now, so surely he understands the predicament in which he and his Cleveland Cavaliers teammates find themselves. * Tonight on ESPN:  Celtics vs. Cavaliers, Game 3 (8:30 ET) Down 0-2 in the best-of-seven Eastern Conference championship series , the Cavaliers have looked slow and lacked energy against the younger, quicker and so far feistier Boston Celtics. Nowhere has that mismatch been more obvious than in the backcourt, where Hill and J.R. Smith have been not just outplayed but rendered irrelevant by the Celtics\u2019 Jaylen Brown and Terry Rozier. In Boston\u2019s two victories, Brown and Rozier combined for 72 points, 26 rebounds and 14 assists while making 29 of their 60 shots, including 8-for-24 on 3-pointers. Hill and Smith? They\u2019ve put up 12 points, six rebounds and three assists. They\u2019ve taken 24 shots and made only five, including just one of their 11 shots from the arc. Considering the Cavaliers have been outscored in the series so far 215-177, the 60-point disparity between the starting backcourts stands as Exhibit A in explaining Cleveland\u2019s tough spot. Can the Cavs\u2019 guards flip the script? If they don\u2019t, they\u2019ll face outrageous odds against them \u2013 NBA teams that fall behind 0-3 in best-of-seven series have gone 0-131 in playoff history. * Schuhmann:  Key numbers in first two games of series If they do, or if they even come close, they\u2019ll need better production and efficiency from Hill. Smith, after all, is streaky and unpredictable in the best of times \u2013 and these hardly have been the best of times for the 32-year-old gunner. Smith remains helpful defensively, contributing to a game plan focused heavily on Boston\u2019s Jayson Tatum through the first two games. But the man nicknamed \u201cSwish\u201d has been mostly \u201cClang,\u201d missing 14 of his 16 field goal attempts, including 0-for-7 on 3-pointers. His petulant shove of Al Horford for a flagrant 1 foul in the fourth quarter of Game 2 all but cinched that victory for the Celtics with the four points they reaped. Smith always packs the potential to get hot, which can carry Cleveland for stretches and rouse the home crowd at Quicken Loans Arena. Hill, however, is the teammate who \u2013 if helping out star LeBron James is essential, and it is \u2013 can offer the most significant and sustained assistance. It\u2019s one thing for Hill to boost his individual numbers. And, at 4.0 points and 37.5 percent shooting, there\u2019s plenty of room for improvement. But it\u2019s just as important that the 10-year veteran runs the offense at the quicker pace coach Tyronn Lue craves, creates opportunities in pick-and-rolls with Kevin Love and others, eases some of the ball-handling burden on James and provides the long-wingspan defense on the perimeter that\u2019s been such a part of his NBA portfolio. \u201cHe\u2019s another added ball handler, another guy with a high basketball IQ that\u2019s been in big games,\u201d James said of Hill this postseason. \u201cIt helps to have that out on the floor to be able to create not only for himself \u2026 but just being able to create for others as well.\u201d The \u201cbeen in big games\u201d line on Hill\u2019s resume is what was supposed to distinguish him from the other new faces Cleveland acquired at the league\u2019s trade deadline. Rodney Hood, Jordan Clarkson and Larry Nance Jr. all arrived with little (Hood) or no (Clarkson, Nance) playoff experience. Hill, by contrast, had appeared in 83 postseason games, mostly with Indiana and more than every other Cavaliers player except James, Smith and Kyle Korver. That experience was supposed to be an asset and, for a spell, it was. Hill missed three games in the first round series against Indiana with a back injury but came up big when he returned for Game 7. In the sweep of Toronto in the East semifinals, he averaged 10.3 points on 53.3 percent shooting. But Hill \u2013 who returned to Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis last weekend to pick up his new completed liberal arts degree and speak at the school\u2019s graduation \u2013 hasn\u2019t given the Cavs the stability they sought. Overall, he has averaged 8.6 points, 1.9 rebounds and 2.1 assists, and his 11.1 player efficiency rating is his lowest in the playoffs since his rookie season (9.8). \u201cI\u2019m trying to figure it out myself,\u201d Hill said. \u201cI think a little bit of just trying to be more involved offensively, trying to be more involved defensively, not waiting until a play is possibly called and things like that to go do it. Make some things happen defensively where I can get active and get some easy baskets or crash the boards and taking it coast to coast and things like that.\u201d He added: \u201cI\u2019ve just got to be more assertive.\u201d Beginning now with Game 3 or perhaps never for Hill and the Cavs. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

But a big challenge awaits Sunday at Oracle Arena, where the Warriors have won an NBA-record tying 15 straight playoff games. Houston coach Mike D\u2019Antoni knows all about Golden State\u2019s success in Oakland, but thinks it has less to do with being at home than the fact that the Warriors are a great team. \u201dThe challenge is you\u2019re playing Golden State. That\u2019s why they\u2019ve won 15 in a row. Not because of the building, but because they\u2019re good,\u201d he said. \u201dAll these players are used to playing in hostile environments \u2026 it helps a little bit (but) sometimes you feed off the energy also from the other crowd. So you try to take them out as soon as you can and take out the crowd.\u201d The Rockets aren\u2019t daunted by Golden State\u2019s winning streak there and are looking forward to the challenge. \u201dIt\u2019s definitely a great place to play,\u201d Trevor Ariza said. \u201dTheir fans are great. They bring a lot of energy to the game. At this point there\u2019s nothing like playing in that type of environment and trying to silence them.\u201d Ariza was one of the keys to Houston\u2019s 127-105 win in Game 2 that helped erase the memory of Houston\u2019s tough home loss in the series opener. Ariza had 19 points as one of five Rockets who scored more than 16 points to rebound after an ineffective performance in Game 1 because of foul trouble. While the Rockets know what happened in Game 2 won\u2019t matter if they don\u2019t take care of business on Sunday night, they do believe it gives them a bit of momentum. \u201dYeah, just because we know we\u2019re more than capable of it,\u201d James Harden said. \u201dWe\u2019ve just got to go out there and do it every possession.\u201d Houston\u2019s 127 points were the most the team has scored this postseason. But they\u2019re quick to point out that their success on offense was the product of solid defense. That, they say, is the reason it won\u2019t be difficult to recreate what they did in Game 2 on Sunday night. \u201dIt wasn\u2019t anything special that we did,\u201d Harden said. \u201dWe just created more opportunities with our defense.\u201d Sunday will be just Houston\u2019s second game at Golden State this season and first since the Rockets got a 122-121 win on Oct. 17 in the opener for both teams on the night the Warriors received their championship rings. \u201dA lot has been going on since then,\u201d Harden said. \u201dBut as long as we take those same principles and that mindset that we have, no matter where we play, we\u2019ll be pretty good.\u201d Kevin Durant has scored 75 points combined in the first two games to lead the Warriors, but Stephen Curry hasn\u2019t really gotten going yet as he rounds into form after missing almost two months with a knee injury. The Rockets know the 2015 and 2016 Most Valuable Player is capable of having a huge game at any time and they must account for him at all times, just as they do with Durant and Klay Thompson. \u201dI just think everybody on their team can shoot,\u201d Ariza said. \u201dWhen they\u2019re in a scoring position, you just have to give some sort of resistance. Try to make them think about doing other things.\u201d The Warriors have much more experience at this level of the postseason with this being their franchise-record fourth straight trip to the conference finals. But Houston has plenty of veteran leadership led by nine-time All-Star Chris Paul, who said it\u2019s easy to look forward regardless of how the last game went. \u201dIt feels like Game 2 was a week ago now,\u201d he said. \u201dThat\u2019s how it is in the playoffs \u2026 we\u2019ve done a great job all year staying even-keeled.

He comes by that elusive trait naturally. Browns parents were college athletes. Both played sports at Texas A&M-Kingsville, where they met. Troy Brown, Sr. was an undersized power forward. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t gifted with height,\u201d Brown, Jr. says. \u201cTo be an undersized four-man, he had to work harder than most guys. He wanted to go out and get every rebound, and to do that, he had to outwork his opponents. He taught me the value of hard work, of having a work ethic. He taught me to stay in the gym and be a gym rat.\u201d The 6-foot-7 Brown\u2019s mother Lynn ran track and played volleyball. From her, Brown says, he inherited his athletic ability. Here\u2019s something else that\u2019s important to note about Brown\u2019s parents. They\u2019re both corrections officers in Nevada. It came as no surprise that the Brown\u2019s children were athletes, and good ones. Oldest daughter Janae won the shot put at the 2002 National Junior Olympics. She was 12 at the time. Brown\u2019s other sister Jada, also older than him, won a Nevada high school basketball championship at Centennial High School and was also chosen the state\u2019s player of the year in 2011. She played four years at Kansas. \u201cThat was a very competitive environment to grow up in,\u201d Brown says. \u201cMy sisters did their fair share of picking on me when I was younger. But they also took me under their wings. I watched them grow and I saw their successes, and their mistakes. They gave me inspiration.\u201d Brown tinkered with soccer and track, but there was never any doubt he was going to play basketball. His father didn\u2019t push him into the game, but he provided helpful tools along the way. At three, Brown, Jr. was already dunking on a toy plastic rim, jumping off furniture to heighten the degree of difficulty and foreshadowing a day when he would throw down a vicious slam over future Duke star and lottery pick Marvin Bagley. Once Brown, Jr. decided basketball was his game, he dropped all other sports and committed himself. Obviously, his father also gave him an appreciation for great players of the past. Young Brown became a film junkie, watching everything he could get his hands on. Larry Bird and Penny Hardaway were two favorites. Brown studied their every move. \u201cThe thing that stood out about those guys was whether they were making plays for teammates or creating for themselves, they were always playing downhill,\u201d Brown says. \u201cLarry Bird wasn\u2019t the most athletic player, but he knew how to use his body to finish at the rim, and he had a lot of counter moves in his repertoire.\u201d Brown chose his role models well, and like his sisters, developed aptitude for his sport at an early age. He began playing competitive basketball at four. When he was in second grade, his AAU team competed in the national championship tournament. By the time he was in eighth grade, he was the scourge of Las Vegas youth basketball. Brown could have played at one of two Las Vegas powerhouse prep schools \u2014 Bishop Gorman or Findlay Prep \u2014 but he chose to take the road less travelled, like his sisters, and attend a public school, Centennial. By 14, he\u2019d received his first Division I scholarship offer, from hometown UNLV. By the time he was a senior, he was a five-star recruit, and a McDonald\u2019s All-American. Brown started every game of his high school career and helped lead Centennial to a 95-17 record. Recruiting analysts labeled him a small forward, but Brown was a playmaker. When Brown was as sophomore, Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski came to see him play. He saw a future Magic Johnson. \u201cIt was a compliment I\u2019ll never forget,\u201d Brown says, \u201cand I truly believed it. I\u2019ve worked every day to try to live up to that comparison.\u201d Brown could have played at any school he wanted. He picked Oregon and coach Dana Altman, where during his only season, he learned an important lesson that he\u2019ll carry with him to the NBA. \u201cKYP,\u201d Brown says. \u201cKnow your personnel. Learning guys\u2019 strong suits and what they can do well. Put them in position to do what they do well, especially with the ball in my hands.\u201d Brown had a good, not great freshman season, during which he stuffed his stat sheet on a regular basis. He led the Ducks in rebounding, steals and free-throw attempts while averaging 11.3 points. Oregon had Payton Pritchard to play the point, but Brown was a playmaker too. \u201cI would definitely say I\u2019m a playmaker first, a scorer second,\u201d he says. \u201cSometimes that can be a weakness. I try to make plays for people when they aren\u2019t there. I should learn to attack more if a pass isn\u2019t there. But I\u2019ve always gotten more joy out of seeing my teammates get the basketball and score.\u201d When Brown decided to declare for the Draft, Altman summed up the state of his game. \u201cHe does have to improve his shooting,\u201d Altman said. \u201cI think that would be what most NBA teams would want him to do. His ball skills are very good and his instincts are very good, and now it\u2019s more matching that with the personnel he\u2019s with. I\u2019d like to see his assist-to-turnover ratio get a little better, which it would. \u2026 He\u2019s only 18, so his body will continue to develop and get stronger. There\u2019s a lot of upside. He\u2019s going to make big strides.\u201d Brown has been putting in some serious work at Impact Basketball in Las Vegas, working on his jump shot \u2014 he shot 29.1 percent from 3-point range at Oregon \u2014 and his ball handling. His decision making will improve with age and experience. If Brown does shore up his perimeter game, he\u2019ll become a prototypical modern-day NBA player. Position-less basketball has become the norm, and Brown has the requisite size and most of the skills needed to plug into the right system. \u201cThat\u2019s very important to me,\u201d Brown says. \u201cGoing to the right system. You want to be picked as high as possible, but at the end of the day, if you don\u2019t go into a system that fits you, you might be a high Draft pick and be out of the league in a couple of years.\u201d * * * Chris Dortch is the editor of the Blue Ribbon College Basketball Yearbook .

For the first time in the last eight years, James\u2019 team trails an East playoff series by two games. And the team that\u2019s up 2-0 in the Eastern Conference finals is the one missing two of its three highest-paid players and one that struggled to get through the first round almost as much as the Cleveland Cavaliers did. Forget what we\u2019ve seen from Cleveland all season; If you watched the Boston Celtics through six games against the Milwaukee Bucks, you\u2019d have a hard time believing that they\u2019d go on to win seven of their next eight playoff games, with the postseason\u2019s best NetRtg (point differential per 100 possessions) over that stretch . So how did we get here? Here are some numbers to know about the Celtics and Cavs, with the series taking three days off before it resumes with Game 3 in Cleveland on Saturday ( 8:30 p.m. ET, ESPN ). The Celtics ranked 18th offensively in the regular season , slightly worse than the league average in effective field goal percentage, offensive rebounding percentage and free throw rate (and right at the league average in turnover rate). They ranked third in effective field goal percentage from outside the paint, but 28th in field goal percentage in the paint. In 22 games without Kyrie Irving, they scored just 102.6 points per 100 possessions (a rate which would have ranked 25th).  In the playoffs, the Celtics have been more efficient offensively ( 107.7 points scored per 100 possessions ) than the Cavs (107.4). Boston is one of only two playoff teams (Indiana was the other) that have scored more efficiently in the postseason than they did in the regular season. Through the first two rounds, the Celtics\u2019 effective field goal percentage took a dip, but they cut down on turnovers and saw an increase in free throw rate. In the conference finals, they\u2019ve been able to get to the basket more often, with 38 percent of their shots coming in the restricted area, up from 32 percent over the first two rounds. And that goes to the fact that they\u2019re playing a bad defensive team; The Cavs ranked 29th defensively this season . In the previous 40 years, no team that had ranked in the bottom thee defensively in the regular season had won a playoff series. So the Cavs have already made history, but it\u2019s not a coincidence that the only other team that scored more points per 100 possessions in the playoffs than they did in the regular season is the team \u2014 the Indiana Pacers \u2014 that the Cavs played in the first round. Even in getting swept by the Cavs in the conference semifinals, the Toronto Raptors were just as efficient offensively ( 110.1 points scored per 100 possessions ) as they were in the first round ( 110.2 ). But the Celtics had an improved offense even before they got to this series. They\u2019ve been incredibly balanced, with six guys in their rotation having a postseason usage rate between 19.6 and 24.0 (none higher than 28th overall in these playoffs ). As Al Horford said after Game 1, they\u2019ve found \u201cwhat fits this group.\u201d They\u2019ve also found, against the Philadelphia 76ers and Cavs in particular, matchups that can be taken advantage of. They\u2019ve been able to execute with precision and patience. Two things stand out about the Cleveland offense as it has scored less than a point per possession in each of the first two games . First, LeBron James has just 18 total points in the restricted area after averaging a postseason-high 14.4 points per game in the restricted area through the first two rounds . The Celtics have done well in transition (the Cavs have just 16 total fast break points) and in staying in front of James in half-court situations. Even when he scored 21 points in the first quarter of Game 2, five of his eight buckets came from outside the paint . And over the two games, only 27 percent of his shots have come from the restricted area, down from 41 percent through the first two rounds. James has shot 77 percent in the restricted area and 29 percent from 3-point range in the playoffs, so if most of his offense continues to come from the perimeter, the Celtics are in great shape.  The other thing that stands out (regarding the Cleveland offense) from Games 1 and 2 is that the Cavs have shot just 1-for-10 on corner 3-pointers . Game 1 was just the fourth game this season in which the Cavs didn\u2019t make a corner three, and the two games are just the third time in the four seasons since James returned to Cleveland that they\u2019ve made fewer than two corner threes over a two-game stretch. Corner threes are one thing that distinguishes the Toronto series from the other two that the Cavs have played. They averaged 5.3 per game against the Raptors, but just 2.3 against the Pacers and now, 0.5 against the Celtics. It\u2019s about the attempts as much as it is about the success rate. In the regular season, Boston opponents took only 19 percent of their 3-pointers from the corners. That was the lowest opponent rate in the league. The lack of corner threes is tied to James\u2019 lack of shots in the restricted area. Because the Celtics have done a good enough job of staying in front of James, they\u2019ve been able to (generally) stay at home on the Cavs\u2019 shooters. If the Cavs can find a way to get their star to the basket, the Boston defense will have to react and other things will open up. The Cavs started Tristan Thompson in Game 2, with the thought that he had matchup advantage (on the glass, in particular) against Horford. In last year\u2019s conference finals, the Cavs outscored the Celtics by 81 points in 134 minutes with both Thompson and Horford on the floor . In this series, the Cavs are a plus-4 in 18 minutes with Thompson on the floor and Horford playing center, and that probably keeps Thompson in the starting lineup for Game 3. Having been outscored by 38 points overall in the series, Cleveland should see some encouragement in any configuration that has produced a positive point differential. Before Game 2, Celtics coach Brad Stevens said he wouldn\u2019t change his starting lineup if the Cavs did. But the Celtics didn\u2019t let the Horford-Thompson matchup last too long, especially in the second half, when Aron Baynes subbed in for Jayson Tatum less than 2 1\/2 minutes into the third quarter. Thompson has played more minutes (20) in the series with Horford at power forward (alongside Baynes or Greg Monroe ) than with Horford at center (18). And the Celtics have outscored the Cavs by nine points in those 20 minutes with Thompson on the floor and Horford at the four. With their wins in Games 1 and 2, the Celtics are 9-0 at home in the postseason . If they remain undefeated at TD Garden, they\u2019ll win this series. But the Celtics have been more than 20 points per 100 possessions better at home (plus-10.8) than on the road (minus-9.4) in the postseason. Their only road win (Game 3 at Philadelphia) came in overtime and the only team with a bigger home-road NetRtg differential (26.5) in these playoffs is the team ( Milwaukee ) that the Celtics played in the first round. The Cavs are 5-1 at home and have been 11.7 points per 100 possessions better at Quicken Loans Arena than they\u2019ve been on the road in the playoffs. But four of those five home wins have been by four points or less . They haven\u2019t exactly taken care of business at The Q. * * * John Schuhmann is a staff writer for NBA.com.

Did any of them nail it? * * * Steve Aschburner :  I\u2019m eager to see what J.B. Bickerstaff does now that he finally has his own parking space, proper office and a full offseason and preseason to ramp up as the Memphis Grizzlies\u2019 coach. I suspect we\u2019ll get a better feel for his coaching chops than two interim gigs have shown. To me, the roster in Milwaukee is too flawed for Mike Budenholzer to achieve instant respect. So, David Fizdale to New York is the one where I expect noticeable progress and improvement from Day 1. Fizdale not only has logged the time to bring proper experience to the Knicks position, he no doubt learned plenty \u2014 good and bad \u2014 from his Grizzlies\u2019 run . There is urgency, there are resources, there are a few players to build around in New York. I think Fizdale is a swell fit. Shaun Powell :  The correct answer is: Who knows? All of these coach hirings sound and look good in May. And even in the case of the Knicks getting David Fizdale, whom I believe has much of the tools needed to deal with the modern-day player (Marc Gasol exempted), he doesn\u2019t have much talent to work with \u2014 same with James Borrego in Charlotte \u2014 so again, who knows if the Knicks nailed it? Love to see what Igor Kokoskov does in Phoenix, especially with the No. 1 pick. Maybe the Suns nailed this one. He\u2019s definitely the most intriguing hire until someone offers Becky Hammon. John Schuhmann :  At this point, all six look like good hires, but time will tell. With a few of these teams (Atlanta Hawks, New York Knicks and Phoenix Suns), it\u2019s more critical for the organization to be patient than for the coach to make an immediate impact. The Detroit Pistons (yet to hire a coach), Toronto Raptors (yet to hire a coach) and Milwaukee Bucks are the teams with win-now rosters where we\u2019ll really need to see an impact next season. Mike Budenholzer had a top-10 defense in three of his five seasons in Atlanta and his Hawks ranked higher in both ball and player movement than the Bucks, so there\u2019s promise that he\u2019ll add some creativity to that offense and do better with the Bucks\u2019 length on the other end of the floor.  Sekou Smith :  There have been several excellent hires , based on the profile of the coaches and the openings they filled. The Knicks knocked it out of the park with the David Fizdale hire. Right coach at the right time for a team that desperately needs a fresh set of eyes on their problems. Lloyd Pierce seems like an ideal fit with the Atlanta Hawks given his experience with \u201cThe Process\u201d in Philadelphia as an assistant coach. The Hawks seem to be in the opening stages of their own rebuild of that nature. Former Hawks boss Mike Budenholzer is a nice get for the Milwaukee Bucks. There are few coaches in the league with the track record of improving the overall performance of his team without superstar additions to aid the process. I\u2019ll take a wait-and-see position on the other openings that have already been filled. And I\u2019m curious where the Toronto Raptors will turn now that they have moved on from Dwane Casey . Talk about a critical hire for a franchise at a crossroad moment. They can\u2019t miss on this one."},{"id":46890,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-what-blame-stephen-curry-struggles-west-finals","date":"2018-05-18","title":"Blogtable: What's to blame for Stephen Curry's struggles in Western Conference finals?","content":"* * * Are Stephen Curry\u2019s shooting woes so far against the Houston Rockets just an anomaly, or a sign that something\u2019s not right?  * * * Steve Aschburner : I think Curry\u2019s shooting woes are a sign that the Rockets know they\u2019d better try to take away something from Golden State\u2019s attack and Curry is the best available option. It\u2019s not like Houston has anyone who can guard Kevin Durant, so Curry \u2013 in size, in style, in significance \u2013 is a wise No. 2 target. Curry and Steve Kerr say the two-time MVP\u2019s once-ailing knee no longer is an issue, so we\u2019ll take them at their word and credit the Rockets\u2019 defensive attention, while making him guard too. So I don\u2019t consider it an anomaly \u2013 but I don\u2019t consider it something that will be sustained for whatever\u2019s left of this series, either. Shaun Powell :  I\u2019m going with anomaly because I just don\u2019t see any physical red flags (limp, wince, hands pulling on shorts, etc) that would lead us to believe that he\u2019s playing in pain. The guy is going to the rim rather strong. Maybe he\u2019s not fully 100 percent but who is this time of year? Understand that Curry\u2019s had some below-average performance in the playoffs before so this hiccup is probably along those lines. He\u2019ll likely recapture his three-point mojo at some point. And if he doesn\u2019t, well, Steve Kerr said the Warriors were good enough to win without Steph anyway. We\u2019ll keep Steve at his word. John Schuhmann :  Nothing looks off when you watch all 13 of his 3-point attempts in this round , and he has looked good in getting to the basket when the Rockets have overplayed him on the perimeter. So \u201canomaly\u201d seems like the more appropriate answer , but we can\u2019t really know because we\u2019re not in his body and have no idea how good his legs feel. Games 3 and 4 will offer more evidence either way.  Sekou Smith :  He\u2019s not shooting it on the galactic level he and his observers are used to. But in his defense, he\u2019s only had six games to regain his groove. It would be foolish to ignore that when considering his current shooting struggles. Steph\u2019s biggest problem right now is he\u2019s rusty. All of the time he missed after the All-Star break hasn\u2019t allowed him to sharpen his game into playoff form. He\u2019s off his mark because he has seen so little game action the past two months. The Houston Rockets know it and are doing their best to take advantage by putting Curry in compromising positions whenever they can. I don\u2019t like the idea of blaming his struggles on anything physical when he and coach Steve Kerr keep refuting those kinds of suggestions. In fact, I appreciate both of them for admitting that Curry is just struggling right now and must fight his way out of his funk."},{"id":40458,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-what-will-you-be-watching-intently-eastern-conference-finals","date":"2018-05-18","title":"Blogtable: What will you be watching for as Eastern Conference finals continue?","content":"* * * What will you be watching most intently as the Eastern Conference finals move to Cleveland this weekend?  * * * Steve Aschburner :  I\u2019ll be watching the Celtics to see how much stock we should put in their 1-4 road record this postseason , as well as the conventional playoff wisdom about role players and young guys faring better at home than in road games. This is their series to lose now, and while they theoretically could just take care of business at TD Garden, the Celtics\u2019 best shot at closing out \u201cThe King\u201d is to stay in front of him and the Cavaliers. Cleveland\u2019s role players probably will play better at Quicken Loans Arena (some of them can\u2019t possibly play worse), and the longer this series goes, the closer it gets, the more vulnerable Boston comes to being beaten by an unfortunate mistake, a shaky call or a stint of superheroism by LeBron James. Shaun Powell :  I\u2019ll be watching for any signs of surrender from LeBron James. Not necessary in terms of giving up in this series, but giving up on Cleveland. Because let\u2019s face it, his decision this summer is more interesting than the Cavs\u2019 chances of getting beyond the Celtics or winning another title this year. I don\u2019t care about whether J.R. Smith shows up, or if Kevin Love can somehow outplay Al Horford or if Jaylen Brown and\/or Jayson Tatum can take another leap in their development. Give me LeBron and a hint (body language, cryptic message, etc.) of what\u2019s coming in July. That\u2019s what we all live for, right? John Schuhmann :  If LeBron James can get to the basket. Through the first two playoff rounds, James was averaging a postseason-high 14.4 points per game in the restricted area . But he has totaled just 18 points in the restricted area through the first two games against Boston , with the Celtics doing a great job of getting back in transition and staying in front of him in the half court. Even when he scored 21 points in the first quarter of Game 2, five of his eight buckets came from outside the paint . The Celtics are happy if most of his offense is coming from 3-point range (where he\u2019s shooting 29 percent in the playoffs) and on turnaround 18-footers out of the post. If the Cavs can find a way to get him to the basket more often (get him moving off the ball?), they\u2019ll get the Boston defense scrambling and other things will open up. The Cleveland defense is never going to be good, but the offense that destroyed Toronto has scored less than a point per possession (and made just one corner three ) through the first two games of the conference finals.  Sekou Smith :  Body language on the Cavaliers. We already know the Celtics are connected in the ways needed for a team to scrap its way into The Finals. The Celtics might not show up to the arena in matching suits (as the Cavs do). But the core players have been through so much adversity the past two seasons they\u2019ve been forced to band together to survive it all. The Cavaliers have looked like the disjointed bunch that they are in the first two games of this series. That magical word that NBA types always throw around \u2014 \u201ctrust\u201d \u2014 I don\u2019t know if the Cavaliers have it in each other or in their coach. That worries me and makes me wonder just what has gone on behind the scenes this season without former GM David Griffin around to perform his front-office magic. The way the Cavaliers perform in Games 3 and 4 will speak volumes about who and what they are these days."},{"id":40457,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/detroit-pistons-becky-hammon-likely-radar-coaching-vacancy","date":"2018-05-18","title":"Becky Hammon expected to be in mix for Detroit Pistons' coaching vacancy","content":" San Antonio Spurs assistant coach Becky Hammon was reportedly on the radar of the Milwaukee Bucks during their coaching search. Although Milwaukee ultimately hired former Atlanta Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer yesterday , it doesn\u2019t mean Hammon\u2019s chances at another NBA coaching job are over. The Detroit Pistons are one of three teams (the Orlando Magic and Toronto Raptors being the others) who are still seeking a coach this offseason. The Pistons parted ways with Stan Van Gundy on May 7 after he served as coach and team president for four years. According to Rod Beard of The Detroit News , the Pistons are expected to interview Hammon as they begin their search for a new coach. Beard talked to several Pistons players, who seemed open to Detroit potentially becoming the first NBA team to hire a female coach : Spurs coach Gregg Popovich hired Hammon to the Spurs coaching staff in 2014, making her the first female full-time assistant in the NBA . Hammon, a six-time WNBA All-Star, also made history in 2015 when she became the first female coach in NBA Summer League, guiding the Spurs to a Las Vegas championship . Hammond played 16 years in the WNBA and was All-WNBA First Team twice and the All-WNBA Second Team twice in her playing career. She was also named one of the WNBA\u2019s Top 15 Players of All Time in July of 2011. Beard also reports that former Pistons star Jerry Stackhouse could be in the running for the job as well. He has served as the coach of the Toronto Raptors\u2019 G League team, the Raptors 905, since 2016-17, and is also an assistant for the parent club as well. He was named G League coach of the year in 2016-17 and led the team to a title that season, too . Hammon, 41, would be the fourth Spurs assistant to interview for a coaching job this spring.

Why? The way he sees it, Porter was widely considered the best high-schooler in the country 12 months ago \u2014 even though he had back issues that led to him having surgery last fall and basically robbed him of his only college season at Missouri. So now, he thinks it\u2019s logical that if his back is better, his stock should be even higher as well. \u201cI\u2019m still the best player,\u201d Porter said. And that\u2019s his message at the NBA Draft Combine, going on this week in Chicago. The small forward went through the anthropometric testing \u2014 height, weight, wingspan, body fat percentage and so on \u2014 but isn\u2019t partaking in on-court matters this week, opting instead to save his statements there until he gets workouts with teams over the coming weeks. \u201cI know without a doubt,\u201d Porter said. \u201cI\u2019ve played against all these guys. They\u2019re all great players. But I\u2019m the best player in this draft and I can\u2019t wait to show what I\u2019m capable of.\u201d The players who are likely to be taken at the very top of next month\u2019s draft aren\u2019t participating in the combine. Arizona\u2019s Deandre Ayton declined an invitation, Slovenian standout Luka Doncic\u2019s season in Europe isn\u2019t in Chicago \u2014 his European season isn\u2019t over \u2014 and Duke\u2019s Marvin Bagley III only took part in interviews with some teams. \u2022 Complete coverage of 2018 NBA Draft That doesn\u2019t mean intrigue is lacking at this gathering of hopefuls. Texas\u2019 Mo Bamba, he of the 7-foot-10 wingspan, said he believes he merits consideration from Phoenix for the No. 1 overall pick. Billy Preston, who left Kansas in November under the cloud of an NCAA investigation and briefly played in Europe, is in Chicago and insisting that he\u2019s ready mentally and physically for the NBA life. Brian Bowen, who hasn\u2019t played a college game yet \u2014 he left Louisville for South Carolina after it became known he was part of the FBI\u2019s probe into college basketball and could only practice with the Gamecocks after enrolling there \u2014 is participating as well.

We\u2019re cool as friends. I think he can show the world what he is capable of and what I know he\u2019s capable of.\u201d Porter is among the 25 or so Chicago invitees who are skipping the 5-on-5 portions of the combine. That\u2019s not a surprise \u2014 the trend in recent years has been for players who are likely to be taken with the highest picks to skip some or all of the combine events \u2013 but a case could be argued that Porter could have used some game time. \u2022 NBA.com\/Stats: Measurables from NBA Draft Combine He played in three games at Missouri, one of those for only two minutes before his back surgery on Nov. 21. He returned for two NCAA Tournament games. Here\u2019s how little Porter played last season: There were 3,505 players in Division I who scored more points than he did in his only college campaign. Porter shot 10 for 30 at Missouri, scoring 30 points in 53 minutes. Obviously, those aren\u2019t best-player numbers. Everything else on his resume suggests otherwise \u2014 36.2 points and 13.6 rebounds per game as a senior in high school, MVP of the McDonald\u2019s All-American Game, and was both the Naismith and Gatorade Boys High School National Player of the Year awards. He was the fifth player to sweep those, joining Alonzo Mourning, Dwight Howard, Chris Webber and LeBron James. Big-time company. \u201cIn the workouts, I won\u2019t be holding back at all,\u201d Porter said. He\u2019s interviewing with a slew of teams this week \u2014 New York, Dallas, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Atlanta, Cleveland, Memphis, Houston and the Los Angeles Clippers so far, with Sacramento, Charlotte, Oklahoma City and Boston still to go. He knows that the Bulls fans are letting anyone who will listen on Twitter know they want him, and said he was impressed how New York\u2019s braintrust knew many things about him. And make no mistake: He says he is raring to play again. \u201cI was hoping to turn college basketball upside down, just like a lot of these players,\u201d Porter said. \u201cBut this is just a step in my process.

There\u2019s still too much stress on his back. He\u2019s carrying the Cavaliers. It\u2019s a springtime tradition. As has been the case for much of his 15-year career, James has had to perform at an extraordinary level throughout these playoffs, most recently in Cleveland\u2019s Game 2 loss at Boston . Bouncing back after taking a blow to the jaw from Jayson Tatum\u2019s shoulder that violently twisted his head and sent a chill down the spines of Cleveland fans, James finished with 42 points, 10 rebounds and 12 assists. It was not enough, however. His teammates failed him and the Cavs fell into a 2-0 hole in the Eastern Conference finals. Kevin Love (22 points, 15 rebounds) helped, so did Kyle Korver (four 3-pointers) and Tristan Thompson (8 points, 7 rebounds). But too many other Cavs ranged from mediocre to awful. If Cleveland is to even the series at home, that has to change starting in Game 3 on Saturday. \u201dWe have to ramp it up,\u201d said J.R. Smith, who didn\u2019t score in Game 2 and committed a critical flagrant foul. \u201dWe\u2019re playing too slow. We\u2019re making \u2018Bron play hero ball, which is tough to do, especially in the Eastern Conference finals. We got to help him. With that said, we have to give him an opportunity to make him feel confident to give us the ball so we can make the right plays. We got to help him and he\u2019s got to help us.\u201d Cavs coach Tyronn Lue said James \u201ddid everything\u201d in practice Thursday, but the 33-year-old had left the floor by the time media members were allowed in for interviews. James was spotted in the fitness and training area inside the facility. Lue said the Cavs spent time breaking down video of the two losses. There was plenty to dissect. Cleveland has had puzzling defensive lapses, and Lue said there were up to nine instances in Game 2 alone where communication breakdowns led to easy baskets or open shots for the Celtics. On offense, Lue feels Smith and point guard George Hill, who have been outscored 72-12 in two games by Jaylen Brown and Terry Rozier, need to be more aggressive and attack the basket. Smith believes it\u2019s simpler than that. \u201dMake shots, that\u2019s the only thing we can do,\u201d said Smith, who is 2 for 17 and 0 for 7 on 3-pointers in the series. \u201dI mean obviously we can do more on the defensive side, but our main focus is to make shots right now when we get it. If we don\u2019t have them, try to make the next-best play. Right now \u2018Bron and Kev are working overly hard, trying to carry us. We just got to step up and do our job.\u201d But talking a good game is one thing, playing one is another. The Cavs don\u2019t have time for speeches or excuses. With their season inching toward danger, results are all that matter. Hill didn\u2019t record an assist in 28 minutes in Game 1 and had three points in Game 2. He missed time in the opening round against Indiana with back spasms and has been puzzled by his drop-off after playing so well in Cleveland\u2019s sweep over Toronto. \u201dI\u2019m trying to figure it out myself,\u201d he said. \u201dI think a little bit of just trying to be more involved offensively, trying to be more involved defensively, not waiting until a play is possibly called and things like that to go do it. I\u2019ve just got to be more assertive, I\u2019ve got to play with that edge like I did in the second series \u201dThere\u2019s no one to blame but myself. You\u2019ve got to look yourself in the mirror and say, \u2018What can I do better?\u201d\u2019 The Cavs know they need to be more physical after the Celtics took the fight to them in Boston. Lue raised some eyebrows following Game 2 when he described Boston\u2019s players as \u201dgooning up\u201d the series.

(AP) \u2014 Home-court advantage has proven to be a valuable commodity for the Celtics so far this postseason. Boston is 9-0 at TD Garden during these playoffs and has blistered opponents early in games, shooting 47 percent from the field and 39 percent from the 3-point line. It\u2019s often led to cushions that have helped the Celtics sustain opponents\u2019 runs in the second half. But after boasting the third-best road record in the NBA during the regular season, the Celtics have looked like a totally different team since the postseason began. They are just 1-4 away from their building and seen their shooting numbers dip to 41 percent overall and 31 percent from beyond the arc. That can\u2019t persist if Boston is going to have success as the series shifts to Cleveland on Saturday. Marcus Smart, who was all over the court in the Celtics\u2019 Game 2 win , didn\u2019t take any offense to Cavs coach Tyronn Lue\u2019s comment that the Celtics have \u201dshown they haven\u2019t played that well on the road.\u201d \u201dWe haven\u2019t played well. We know that and understand that,\u201d Smart said. \u201dWe understand that other teams see that and try to exploit it. But that\u2019s the beauty about this game. It just takes one game. You never know. Things change. Our confidence is high. Who knows?\u201d Coach Brad Stevens said he thought the entire team seemed a little \u201dshell-shocked\u201d at Milwaukee in the first round, when after taking a 2-0 series lead, was promptly blown out 116-92 in Game 3. It lost all three road games in that series. \u201dWe took a punch in the mouth right when guys came out and they surprised us a little bit,\u201d Smart said. \u201dWe can\u2019t afford to be surprised this time around. \u2026 We\u2019re just trying to make it as hard as we can on those guys for them to win a game and for us to execute whatever plan Brad has for us.\u201d That will be easier said than done against a Cavaliers team that got 42 points and near triple-double by LeBron James in Tuesday\u2019s loss. Pressure will certainly be on the Cavs, but they have history on their side. James has won at least one playoff road game in 31 of his last 32 playoff series. To have a chance to make it 32 out of 33, Cleveland would need to win one of the next two games at home to force a Game 5. That\u2019s not out of their reach by any means. Stevens isn\u2019t sure Cleveland has yet to play up to its full potential. \u201dI don\u2019t know if that was their best,\u201d he said. \u201dWe\u2019ve all seen them play at an elite level for a long time. \u2026 At the end of the day they\u2019ve got a lot of guys that have been there, done that. And we\u2019re expecting that every game we\u2019re going to have to play better to have a chance to win.\u201d One of the reasons that the Celtics have had success against the Cavs so far is their willingness to challenge James defensively. Jaylen Brown has been one of several players tasked with guarding James. He also drew that duty at times in last year\u2019s conference finals. He said he is no longer intimidated by the matchup . \u201dAnd why should I? Brown said. \u201dThe stage is set for all of us to do something spectacular. LeBron has been to the finals (seven) straight times. He\u2019s a great player. But we want to win and we want to beat a team that does win and get to the finals. \u201dWe got a bunch of young guys trying to make names for themselves in this league. Why not come out and play hard? Everybody says we\u2019re playing with house money anyway. So why not come out with the energy level that we need and try to do something special?\u201d"},{"id":46848,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/mike-budenholzer-named-head-coach-milwaukee-bucks","date":"2018-05-17","title":"Mike Budenholzer named head coach of the Milwaukee Bucks","content":"MILWAUKEE \u2013 The Milwaukee Bucks today named Mike Budenholzer as the team\u2019s new head coach. \u201cWe are thrilled to welcome Mike Budenholzer as the head coach of the Milwaukee Bucks,\u201d said Bucks General Manager Jon Horst. \u201cMike has played a key role in building successful teams throughout his career.

During his time with the Spurs he was part of one of the most successful eras in NBA history. As an assistant coach, he helped lead San Antonio to a league-best 908-438 (.675) regular season record and four NBA Championships (1999, 2003, 2005 and 2007). Budenholzer spent his first two seasons with the Spurs as a video coordinator and also served as the team\u2019s summer league head coach on numerous occasions. He served as an advance scout for Team USA for the 2004 Olympics. A native of Holbrook, Ariz., Budenholzer is a 1993 graduate of Pomona College where he received a bachelor\u2019s degree in politics, philosophy and economics and was a four-year letterman in both basketball and golf. Following college, he played professionally in Denmark for the Vejle Basketball Klub, averaging a team-high 27.5 points per game during the 1993-94 season and getting his start in coaching, serving as the head coach for two different teams in the Vejle system.

In this case: Save Our Season. \u201cI can\u2019t do it by myself,\u201d Harden said. Harden pumped 41 points yet came up empty, in terms of the Game 1 score and the quest to keep home-court advantage against the Warriors. Aside from an additional lift from Chris Paul, the Rockets offered little else and so Harden felt compelled to grab a bullhorn and let it be known: This isn\u2019t how we got here. Evidently the Rockets listened to their finest player, their gut feeling and the drumbeat of desperation and decided to do something about it. And so the Western Conference finals , along with the Rockets, are far from done. There\u2019s more to the Rockets, meaning, beyond what they opened the series with. It\u2019s all even at one game each because Eric Gordon, P.J. Tucker and Trevor Ariza finally lent a hand, a foot, a well-placed elbow and especially a jump shot to the cause. The Rockets felt normal in Wednesday\u2019s 127-105 wipeout win because they felt whole. They took the lead almost from the jump, withstood a few teases from the Warriors in the second half and cruised. They looked more like the well-balanced Golden State Warriors than they did themselves. \u201cThey knew what they had to do and they did it,\u201d said Warriors guard Stephen Curry. Harden and Paul took most of the shots but the others made most of the plays that caused the beat-down. Ariza attacking and slashing? Done. Tucker dropping 3s from the corner? Yes. Gordon going iso from the key and hitting from 25 feet? Absolutely. These three are players who chip in and help out for the Rockets, usually yielding to Harden and Paul \u2014 or at least orbiting around them, looking for their opening. But Wednesday was a bit of a role switch. At times, Ariza and Gordon and Tucker took turns taking over the game and pushed the lead far beyond the Warriors\u2019 reach. Tucker and Ariza were a combined 3-for-11 shooting in 58 minutes in Game 1. From a functional standpoint, they were no more than hood ornaments. But they joined Gordon and were straight fire Wednesday. They combined for 68 points (compared to 43 for Harden-Paul) and more importantly were efficient with their aim (Ariza, 7-for-9 shooting; Tucker, 8-for-9 shooting; Gordon, 8-for-15). Even better for Houston? Harden and Paul looked for them constantly and fed them the ball. That\u2019s called respect. \u201cThey got exactly what they wanted tonight,\u201d said Warriors coach Steve Kerr. \u201cThey got everybody going. I mean, Ariza, Tucker, Gordon. They got everybody involved. The exact opposite of Game 1. They brought it. They got it done.\u201d The 22 points represent a career playoff-high for Tucker, and almost matched the combined total of Curry and Klay Thompson combined, and this came with a bit of irony as well. Tucker was signed as a free agent last summer precisely for this reason: to give Houston an edge at both ends in a possible Western Conference playoffs showdown against the Warriors. Tucker, however, wasn\u2019t the Rockets\u2019 first choice. That would be Andre Iguodala , and somewhat understandably so. Signing Iguodala would have stripped the Warriors of a veteran with strong postseason credentials. Imagine if Iguodala left the Warriors, joined Houston and helped eliminate his old team? \u201cWe tried,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said. \u201cIt was a no-brainer to try. I don\u2019t know how close we were. I knew it would be hard.\u201d Instead, Iguodala stayed put and the Rockets\u2019 Plan B was Tucker, a rugged forward who brought a reliable 3-point stroke from the corners and a no-nonsense approach. So it was with some added satisfaction that Tucker has at least shown up in this series while Iguodala is, for now, living off his reputation. Iguodala had five points and three turnovers Wednesday and, for the second straight game, didn\u2019t leave any meaningful impression. It\u2019s the second time this season where Tucker hurt the Warriors. The first came in the season-opener, when he went for 22 points and some clutch free throws in Houston\u2019s win in Oakland . \u201cThe guy\u2019s a warrior,\u201d said D\u2019Antoni. \u201cHe finds a way to affect the game.\u201d Gordon had a Splash Brothers-like game with six 3-pointers and 27 points (matching Harden) in 32 minutes, which came a few hours after he was announced as a finalist for the Kia Sixth Man award . \u201cI just wanted to be aggressive,\u201d Gordon said. \u201cIt\u2019s always good to be on a good team which makes my job easier. It\u2019s been a blast since I\u2019ve been here.\u201d Ariza was more economical than usual from deep, taking only three 3-pointers. Instead, he relied on his dribble game, which perhaps caught the Warriors by surprise. Scoring in transition and in the half court, Ariza finished plays and forced the Warriors\u2019 defense to pay close attention instead of doubling Harden. After major foul trouble in Game 1, he avoided that and got his game on track. \u201cI forgot all about Game 1,\u201d Ariza said. \u201cI was excited to be on the court. I focused all of my thoughts into this game and what I could do to help the team.\u201d Was this a fleeting sighting for the Rockets that\u2019ll either fade or disappear completely when the series shifts to Oakland? D\u2019Antoni doesn\u2019t think so. He\u2019s leaning on a season\u2019s worth of evidence that tells him a 65-win team is more liable to reflect Game 2 than Game 1. For the Rockets\u2019 playoff health, that\u2019d better be true. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to come in and change the way you play,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said. \u201cWe are who we are, and we had to be who we are. We just did it better and for longer (tonight). We\u2019re very comfortable about who we are. We can beat anybody, anywhere and anytime playing like the way we play. It\u2019s effective. It\u2019s efficient.\u201d For the next three off-days it\u2019s the Warriors who must solve mysteries for a change for their home games in Oakland. Curry was chilly in Game 2, raising questions about his recovery from his MCL injury and\/or his ability to shake free of Houston\u2019s defense. Meanwhile, Draymond Green\u2019s biggest contribution to the series so far was his Game 1 shove of Harden . \u201cWe don\u2019t really worry about who we\u2019re playing against,\u201d Tucker said. \u201cIf we come out and be some dogs and do what we did tonight, it doesn\u2019t matter. But if we don\u2019t, then we see the results in Game 1. So it\u2019s not about chess match or what they\u2019re doing. It\u2019s about us.\u201d * * * Veteran NBA writer Shaun Powell has worked for newspapers and other publications for more than 25 years.

And there\u2019s good reason for it. Curry is the player most teams fear because of the way he changes the game\u2019s dynamics with his shooting range that knows no bounds. But he\u2019s also the one player teams can attack on the defensive end, marking perhaps the only real soft spot for the reigning NBA champions. Game 2 of the Western Conference finals provided a masterclass in how to exploit Curry\u2019s defensive struggles as the Houston Rockets targeted him early, often and relentlessly in a 127-105 blowout at Toyota Center Wednesday to even the series at 1-1. Curry, the two-time Kia MVP, knows what opposing scouting reports say about him. He\u2019s used to wearing a bullseye on defense and accepts the challenge of battling against his reputation. When it became obvious that he was going to be the center of defensive attention for a Rockets team desperate to avoid their first back-to-back playoff losses, Curry knew exactly what was coming. \u201cSurprise, surprise,\u201d Curry said of the Rockets\u2019 concerted effort to go at him. The strategy worked to perfection, sapping any chance of the Warriors duplicating their Game 1 effort that saw them withstand an early blitz before taking control in the second half and winning by 13 points. Durant was surgical again, shredding the Rockets for a game-high 38 points . Curry, however, finished with 16 on 19 shots, including a 1-for-8 performance on 3-poiners. Durant and Curry were the only Warriors to reach double figures as the Rockets dismantled the fabled \u201cHamptons Five\u201d lineup. \u201cWe got outplayed the whole game,\u201d Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. \u201cWe\u2019re playing a team that won 65 games. They\u2019re damn good. We got it handed to us. You can look at it anyway you want and parcel it out into different shifts and rotations and all that stuff, but it didn\u2019t matter who we had out there tonight. We got beat.\u201d The Warriors got knocked off balance early by the Rockets\u2019 ramped up energy and physicality and, outside of Durant, never fully answered that challenge on either end of the floor. \u201cI think that was the difference,\u201d Curry said. \u201cWe were trying to be too cute with our exchanges and our switches and all that stuff instead of just manning up and playing one-on-one defense. Whether they score or not, as hard as we\u2019re working on the defensive end, they\u2019re working as hard on the offensive end to get shots up. \u201cThat was the difference between Game 1 and Game 2. They made a concerted effort to turn those one-on-one situations into a little bit more ball movement, and we were just a step slow, myself included.\u201d Through two games in this series, Curry is the only principle who has not played up to his own standard. Wednesday was his sixth game back in the lineup after missing the final 10 regular-season games and first six of the playoffs while recovering from a Grade 2 MCL sprain . That injury came on the heels of a six-game absence from a right ankle sprain in early March. Curry and Kerr dismissed the notion that there was any lingering injury issue involved with Curry\u2019s play. Kerr responded to a reporter\u2019s question with a joke that he\u2019d attribute \u201c13.7 percent\u201d of Curry\u2019s subpar performance to the knee sprain. \u201cI mean, it obviously wasn\u2019t Steph\u2019s best night,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cHe struggled. Slow start for him. I thought in the second half he got a few things going. I\u2019m not worried about Steph. He\u2019s the kind of competitor and player who will bounce back from a tough night. But it\u2019s just one of those nights. \u201cHe\u2019s feeling good. I don\u2019t know what this was, maybe his sixth or seventh game back. So he\u2019s getting better, and I thought he played a lot better in Game 1 than anyone gave him credit for. But, again, it wasn\u2019t our night. Our defense wasn\u2019t connected. We weren\u2019t on the same page on a lot of plays where we got a little out of sorts. Yeah, there are a lot of ways you could look at it, but it doesn\u2019t matter \u2014 127-105.\u201d Curry insists he\u2019s not dealing with any physical discomfort that would cause him to struggle the way he has so far in this series. \u201cI\u2019m feeling great,\u201d he said. \u201cTonight, I didn\u2019t find a rhythm early. I had some decent looks from 3 that could have changed the momentum of the game early in the first half. But for the most part it was just a frustrating night all the way around. They made some adjustments. They got other guys involved, and they made plays. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of how a series like this is going to be. Game after game, it\u2019s going to be a chess match. Tonight we just didn\u2019t make enough plays to stop the momentum in this building, and that was the difference in the game. P.J. Tucker, Trevor Ariza, Eric Gordon, they stepped up tonight. So we\u2019ve got to be ready for that kind of aggressiveness from them in Game 3 , and keep doing what we\u2019re doing.\u201d Actually, the Warriors need Curry to do something else. They have to find a way to get him back in a groove. Maybe heading back to Oracle Arena for Games 3 and 4 will provide the spark he needs. Following Durant\u2019s lead might be a good place to start. \u201cHe\u2019s been amazing,\u201d Curry said. \u201cHe\u2019s making plays. He\u2019s aggressive. I think we all need to feed off of that focus and that determination. I think our intentions were in the right place. Just the way that first quarter started, we really didn\u2019t deserve to be in the game down the stretch in the fourth quarter. \u201cObviously, he made a lot of tough shots and great plays to keep us close. If he can continue to do what he does, I\u2019ll shoot the ball better and play better defense, other guys will get involved and we\u2019ll be in great shape. Again, no panic. No house-is-on-fire type of mentality in our locker room. \u201cWe\u2019re in pretty good shape right now.\u201d * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

The 2015 NBA Coach of the Year will replace Joe Prunty, the former assistant who went 21-16 in the regular season after replacing the fired Jason Kidd in late January. The team announced the move on Thursday afternoon. The deal was first reported by ESPN on Wednesday. The Bucks lost to Boston in seven games in the first round of the playoffs. Budenholzer went 213-197 in five seasons with the Hawks, leading them to a franchise-record 60 wins and the Eastern Conference finals in 2015. He and the Hawks mutually agreed to part ways last month with two years remaining on his contract, allowing Budenholzer to pursue other opportunities. The one with the Bucks may have been the best available, thanks to All-Star forward Giannis Antetokounmpo and a new arena next season. \u201cThere\u2019s a massive amount of excitement around this team, because of the arena right there, because of this facility, because or our team,\u201d general manager Jon Horst said recently from the Bucks\u2019 training facility located across the street from the new arena. \u201cI think a coaching hire just adds to the momentum that we have as an organization, particularly if it\u2019s the right person and it helps us win the way that we expect to win.\u201d The Bucks took a small step forward this season after winning 44 games, two better than last year, when they lost to Toronto in six games in the first round. Before choosing Budenholzer, the Bucks also considered Spurs assistant Becky Hammon, who would have been the first woman to coach an NBA team, and interviewed former Cavaliers coach David Blatt, former Hornets coach Steve Clifford, and current Spurs vice president and former Pelicans coach Monty Williams. \u201cXs and Os matter, you want someone who has a high basketball IQ, a high human IQ, a high character person, someone who\u2019s a great communicator,\u201d Horst said about some of the qualities he was seeking in the next coach. Budenholzer was a longtime assistant to Gregg Popovich in San Antonio before taking the Atlanta job. The Hawks have been on a downward spiral since his second season and fell to 24-58 this season, worst in the Eastern Conference. They hired former 76ers assistant Lloyd Pierce and have the No. 3 pick in next month\u2019s draft."},{"id":40472,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/boston-celtics-cleveland-cavaliers-paul-pierce-chimes-east-finals-lebron-james","date":"2018-05-16","title":"Paul Pierce on Eastern Conference finals: 'We could be seeing history repeat itself'","content":" Thanks to their win in Game 2 of the Eastern Conference finals on Tuesday night, the Boston Celtics have a 2-0 edge on a LeBron James-led Cleveland Cavaliers squad. The series shifts to Cleveland for the next two games, starting with Saturday\u2019s Game 3 ( 8:30 ET, ESPN ). Yet to former Celtics star\/LeBron nemesis Paul Pierce, there\u2019s a lot of 2010 in this series. Pierce\u2019s Celtics \u2014 which included himself, Kevin Garnett, Ray Allen, Rajon Rondo and others \u2014 knocked LeBron-led squads out of the playoffs twice in their heyday. First came a Game 7 ousting of Cleveland in the 2008 East semis. Then, in 2010, the Cavs won 61 games and had the best record in the NBA \u2026 and lost to Pierce and Co. in six games in the East semis . Although he\u2019s an NBA analyst for ESPN these days, Pierce couldn\u2019t help but let some Celtic pride shine through as he spoke with Steve Bulpett of the Boston Herald over the phone today. In the interview , he spoke about Boston\u2019s surprising run after injuries sacked stars Kyrie Irving and Gordon Hayward, as well as watching his old team torment James like in the old days. James and the Cavs lost Game 6 on May 13, 2010. Less than two months later, on July 8, 2010, James had his famous \u201cDecision\u201d news conference and left the Cavs for the Miami Heat. As the Celtics have built their 2-0 edge, Pierce says he sees similarities in how this edition of the team is like his from 2010. In 2009-10, Pierce\u2019s Celtics were 2-2 against James\u2019 Cavs. This season, the Celtics were 1-2 against the Cavs in the regular season, but the story has changed in the playoffs. And while Pierce obviously can\u2019t affect the outcome of this series as he could in 2010, he nonetheless seems to be enjoying Boston\u2019s start in the East finals. * * *"},{"id":40478,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/boston-celtics-shrug-cleveland-cavaliers-tyronn-lue-gooning-remark","date":"2018-05-16","title":"Boston Celtics shrug off Tyronn Lue's talk of them 'gooning' in series","content":"The Boston Celtics\u2019 107-94 win against the Cleveland Cavaliers gave them a 2-0 lead in the Eastern Conference finals. In the aftermath of it, it also provided them with some potential fuel for the rest of the series, courtesy of Cavs coach Tyronn Lue. Tensions were already high between the teams as Game 2 wound down. That was because of a play with 3 minutes, 37 seconds left in the fourth quarter when JR Smith shoved an airborne Al Horford in the back. That resulted in a flagrant foul 1 on Smith, who has a history of some physical plays against the Celtics in playoffs series past. He was whistled for a flagrant foul in the 2015 Cavs-Celtics series for his hit on Jae Crowder . After last night\u2019s Game 2, Lue accused the Celtics of \u201cgooning the game up,\u201d words that did not particularly seem to concern Boston. Here\u2019s more from ESPN.com\u2019s Dave McMenamin on the Celtics\u2019 response to Lue\u2019s comments : Celtics guard Marcus Smart had some pointed words for Smith in his postgame news conference, calling Smith\u2019s foul on Horford \u201cdirty\u201d and citing the past the team and Smith share with each other. \u201cOh, man, we\u2019re out there to play basketball,\u201d Smart said. \u201cYou know, and I just looked at it: Al is a defenseless person. He\u2019s in the air. He can\u2019t control how his body goes, and he\u2019s not even looking. And you go and take two hands to the back; that\u2019s a dirty shot. You just can\u2019t allow that to keep happening. \u201cThat\u2019s not the first time JR has done some dirty stuff, especially playing against us. He\u2019s known for it, especially playing against us. We know that. So, you know, it\u2019s like a bully: You keep letting a bully keep picking on you, he\u2019s going to pick on you until you finally stand up, and that\u2019s what I tried to do. One of my guys was down, and I took offense to it.\u201d While there were some other physical incidents in Game 2 \u2014 a shoving match between the Cavs\u2019 Tristan Thompson and Morris in the third quarter in particular \u2014 what seemed to irk the Cavs more was their response (or lack thereof) to the Celtics\u2019 physical style. \u201cThey\u2019re going to play physical,\u201d Thompson told reporters after Game 2. \u201cThey got to. That gets them going, and they\u2019ve got players that are gritty players that play hard. That\u2019s their edge, that\u2019s what they bring to the table. Guys got to be ready for that. And if you\u2019re not ready, then you can\u2019t play.\u201d Additionally, Lue cited his team\u2019s lack of mental toughness in the Game 2 loss and knows the Cavs can\u2019t afford for a repeat performance in Game 3 on Saturday ( 8:30 ET, ESPN ). \u201cWe\u2019ve got to be tougher, mentally and physically,\u201d Lue said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to come out swinging. We\u2019ve got to be aggressive. I think we\u2019ve got to be physical, and we\u2019ve got to have a physical mindset, you know, that they\u2019re coming in, playing tough.

He took two dribbles and pulled up for a jumper from the right side of the floor with his toes on the 3-point line. It was, for many reasons, a terrible shot. It was a long 2-pointer, off the dribble, with 20 seconds left on the shot clock, and from one of the worst shooters in the league. There were 207 players who took at least 200 shots from outside the paint this season, and Marcus Smart (31 percent) ranked 199th among the 207 in field goal percentage on those shots. Through the Boston Celtics\u2019 first 13 playoff games, Smart had an effective field goal percentage of 28 percent on pull-up jumpers. He likely thought he was shooting a 3 in that situation, making it \u2014 maybe \u2014 not so terrible of a shot. But he was brutal 1-for-16 on pull-up 3s before Tuesday. And no, this one \u2014 no matter how many points it would have counted for \u2014 didn\u2019t go in either. But Smart didn\u2019t go to the bench because of it. Celtics coach Brad Stevens, a guy who cares about math, had been asked about Smart\u2019s shot selection less than three hours earlier. \u201cLet it fly,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cI want guys playing free. I want them excited to make a mistake and learn from it and move on. Marcus Smart makes a ton of winning plays, and because of that, he deserves to take those opportunities, because we all believe he\u2019s going to make them.\u201d Saying \u201cwe all believe\u201d that Smart is going to make his shots is a bit of a stretch. But Stevens proved prophetic. That wasn\u2019t the only bad shot Smart took as he went 3-for-9 on Tuesday. But he also made a ton of winning plays as the Celtics won Game 2, 107-94 , to take a 2-0 series lead. After a 21-point first quarter from LeBron James , the Cavs led by as many as 11 in the second, and by seven at halftime. But behind a big third quarter from Terry Rozier, the Celtics \u2014 who now have a league-high 18 wins after trailing by double-digits \u2014 came back. And they took the lead for good with a long, catch-and-shoot 3 from Smart with 4:34 to go in the period. Smart\u2019s last two buckets were much more characteristic of the hard-nosed player he is. Later in the third, he took a hand-off from Al Horford with Kyle Korver trailing the play. Smart drove into the paint, took off sideways to avoid the helping Kevin Love, and dropped in a reverse scoop shot as he fell to the ground. And midway through the fourth, after tapping out an offensive rebound, he outhustled James and Tristan Thompson for a tip-in of a Jayson Tatum miss, again falling to the ground as the shot dropped in. But of course, as is always the case with Smart, the 11 points he scored didn\u2019t tell nearly the whole story. There were the four steals, two of which sent Smart crashing out of bounds. And then, there was the playmaking. Stevens has plenty of options through which to run his late-game offense. It could be Horford in the post, Tatum from the left side of the floor, or a pick-and-roll with Rozier. For most of Tuesday\u2019s fourth quarter, the ball was in Smart\u2019s hands, running pick and roll with Greg Monroe and Horford. The results were mostly good, and Smart finished with nine assists and zero turnovers. As has been the case all postseason with the Celtics, they found an advantage and attacked it. \u201cAt one time they had Love on Smart, and that\u2019s just unique matchup for a big (to have to defend a pick-and-roll ballhandler),\u201d Stevens said. \u201cWe tried to get out of the screens quick and tried to find a seam to the rim, either on the drive or the lob.\u201d The shots from the outside don\u2019t matter as much if you\u2019re getting to the basket. And for the second straight game, the Celtics outscored the Cavs in the paint. This time the tally was 50-42, with six of Smart\u2019s nine assists resulting in layups or dunks for his teammates. \u201cHe has a really uncanny ability to get into the lane and either create for himself or create for others,\u201d James said. \u201cAnd he did that tonight with the nine assists, and also had some offensive rebounds and also some missed shots.\u201d Yes, the missed shots. It\u2019s part of the package. You take the bad with the good. In this series, the Celtics have been both the better team and the tougher team, and Smart, still playing with a splint on his right thumb, exemplifies the latter. \u201cThat\u2019s me,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m the youngest of four boys. My whole life I had to fight. I had to get down and do things in order to secure my spot in the household. So, coming onto the court, it\u2019s nothing different.\u201d \u201cIf there\u2019s a loose ball, offensive rebound they need to have, he\u2019s going to get it,\u201d Cavs coach Tyronn Lue said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to be able to find someone who can match his toughness.\u201d It\u2019s not clear that someone exists. * * * John Schuhmann is a staff writer for NBA.com.

As ugly as J.R. Smith\u2019s two-handed shove to Horford\u2019s back looked deep into the fourth quarter of the Boston Celtics\u2019 eventual 107-94 victory Tuesday night, that\u2019s how vulgar the ruckus raised by the arena\u2019s most boisterous fans sounded. The chorus of \u201c[Bleep] you J.R.\u201d rained down on him after the Cleveland guard\u2019s flagrant 1 foul and could be heard through the TV broadcast. Meanwhile, the man the Cleveland Cavaliers call \u201cSwish\u201d kind of just smirked \u201cI loved it,\u201d Smith said in a dreary visitors dressing room afterward. \u201cI don\u2019t want the opposing fans to like me. That\u2019s not why I\u2019m here. They can chant and scream all they want. It actually makes me feel better about myself. They know me.\u201d Some Cavaliers fans might have been muttering the same words, though, considering the timing and impact of Smith\u2019s shove of Horford. Less than a minute before that, Cleveland \u2014 in spite of its meltdown in the second half \u2014 had used a brief spurt to get within two possessions at 95-89. LeBron James\u2019 bump of Horford at 4:25 put Boston into the bonus for two free throws that nudged the lead to eight. But Smith\u2019s cheap shot, which looked borne of frustration, pushed the game over the edge. Tempers flared, Smith and Celtics guard Marcus Smart jawed and tussled their way to dueling technical fouls and Horford sank his free throws. On the subsequent possession awarded with the flagrant, the fired-up Horford posted up Kevin Love, spun around him and dropped in a reverse layup while drawing a foul (he missed the free throw). After a poise-challenged pair of turnovers by the Cavs, Horford nailed a jump shot from 21 feet. Now the Celtics\u2019 lead was 14, with less than three minutes left. The game had been grimy all night. Larry Nance Jr. and Aron Baynes went to the floor and grabbed the basketball, but wrestled way beyond what was necessary to force a jump ball. Marcus Morris and Tristan Thompson had to be separated and earned matching techs when they tumbled over the baseline, Morris woofing directly in Thompson\u2019s face. Most of the early stuff, though, was give and take. By the time of Smith\u2019s transgression, the Cavs were completely on the taking end. And now the three-time Eastern Conference champions are down 0-2, desperate for some homecourt love back in Cleveland but searching for answers too. * More Eastern Conference finals coverage They had led earlier in the evening by 11 points. They got the sort of monster game the world expected from James \u2014 42 points, 10 rebounds, 12 assists \u2014 in response to Cleveland\u2019s blowout loss in Game 1. And still, the younger, more together Celtics were unfazed, dominating the second half by 20 points and in every other significant category as well. \u201cWe were terrible defensively,\u201d said Thompson, who was moved into the starting lineup as coach Tyronn Lue\u2019s most obvious game-to-game adjustment but contributed only two rebounds and four points after halftime. Smith struggled throughout with his shot, going 0-for-7 and missing all four of his 3-point attempts. He was so bad at that end he probably shouldn\u2019t have been brought back late, except that Jaylen Brown was having his way with Kyle Korver and Lue has leaned on Smith\u2019s defense on many nights. This wasn\u2019t one of them. Smith missed his final 3-pointer with Marcus Smart pestering him closely, and his shove as Horford jumped under the rim came immediately after that. Smith denied feeling frustrated, but the plays sure looked connected. \u201cThe hardest part is when you can\u2019t score and they keep scoring,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the thing that\u2019ll drive you crazy. We all know in this room, we\u2019ve all been professionals for a long time, we\u2019re not going to make every [shot]. In order to be successful in the playoffs, if you\u2019re not making, you\u2019ve got to make sure they\u2019re not making. You\u2019ve got to turn to defensive effort. We just didn\u2019t do that.\u201d Said Thompson: \u201cIf we don\u2019t get stops on the defensive end, they\u2019re going to make open threes. Then they\u2019re going to have rhythm and their guys are going to feel good. If you don\u2019t play no defense in the playoffs, especially in the conference finals, you\u2019re not gonna win a ball game.\u201d The Cavaliers didn\u2019t defend the way they\u2019d like to, but that\u2019s been a season-long deficiency. Offensively, they were better than Sunday but not nearly enough. James, who took a blow to the jaw from Jayson Tatum\u2019s left shoulder in the second quarter and briefly left the game, and Love combined for 64 points. The other seven who played before Lue waved the white flag managed only 30. Take away Brown\u2019s 23 and Terry Rozier\u2019s 18 for Boston and the other Celtics were good for 66. Boston has rolled at home this postseason, going 9-0 so far at TD Garden vs. 1-4 on the road. That\u2019s not unusual for a younger group such as the Celtics, and the Cavs are right to expect a shift in bravado and tenacity with Games 3 and 4 at Quicken Loans Arena beginning Saturday ( 8:30 ET, ESPN ) James suggested his concern level still is pointing to zero, no different than after the first loss. \u201cI\u2019ll recalibrate,\u201d he said a couple times about his prep work for Game 3. And yet, with a complete Cavs performance so elusive, with a backcourt of Smith and George Hill contributing little this round, with the new guys who arrived in February wholly unreliable and with a feisty ensemble opponent brimming with more confidence daily, the needles on some urgency meters back in Cleveland could well be buried to the right. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Because at various points in this Western Finals , a choice must be made against the Warriors. It\u2019s necessary to give extra attention to Kevin Durant, who\u2019s only one of the top three or four scorers on the planet. And look here, Steph Curry is healthy and feeling frisky again, so the two-time MVP and historically-great 3-point shooter must be given the proper respect as well. That leaves Klay Thompson? As the Rockets prepare for a must-have Game 2 ( 9 ET on TNT ) on Wednesday, this is the most likely option, to man-up Thompson without help, or even stray from Thompson at times when the Warriors spread the floor and force you to choose door No. 1, 2 or 3. Usually this means Thompson is the beneficiary, the reward for playing next to two of the few shooters who are more dangerous than he is, two who happen to be his teammates. That\u2019s why the Warriors are a tough check and once again favorites to sip champagne in June. On almost any other team, Thompson would see multiple bodies flying in his direction on switches and traps. Not this one. And not now, even though the Rockets are down 1-0 in the series and rightly feel a little desperate. Thompson had plenty of room and freedom in Game 1 for his 28-point performance and exploited those goodies by dropping jumpers and sneaking behind the defense for back-door cuts and layups. That\u2019s the thing: Thompson is sometimes ignored or forgotten or not paid the same amount of defensive respect, in spite of bringing one of the smoothest and lethal jump shots of the last few decades. It\u2019s an embarrassment of riches that plays heavily in Golden State\u2019s favor and gives headaches to defenses. This is why Durant signed up for this, to either take advantage of lighter defense played on him or give that advantage to Curry and Thompson, but mostly Thompson if only because the other team must choose somebody. Of course, the Rockets know what they\u2019re risking by gambling their cash on the third wheel. A question Tuesday to James Harden: \u201cWhat do you take away from Klay Thompson?\u201d Harden: \u201cThat he can shoot the ball.\u201d Thompson isn\u2019t just a rhythm shooter, although that\u2019s clearly when he\u2019s at his most effective. His ability to bounce off screens and square up to the basket after catching the ball is sharp; Thompson also brings a quick release and therefore is tough to guard in that sequence. Yet, Thompson hurt the Rockets three times on back-door plays and drives to the rim after pump fakes. Other shooters are just that, players who run to the corner and stand and wait for a pass (Trevor Ariza in this series, for example). Thompson can do that, yet he also moves and so the defense can\u2019t relax. He can go chilly, like all shooters, but those have been rare lately. In 11 postseason games so far, only two can be described as outright clunkers (4-for-16 vs. the Spurs, 4-for-20 vs. the Pelicans). As a third option, Thompson is averaging just under 22 points on 46 percent shooting (38 from deep). Would Thompson be this highly regarded if he played on a lesser team that couldn\u2019t provide teammates that drew defensive attention from him? That\u2019s tough to answer, because circumstances could vary. And it doesn\u2019t appear to be a situation that Thompson is too curious about. Reportedly, he has already begun to explore contract extension talks with the Warriors even though his current deal doesn\u2019t expire until 2019. That means Thompson is at least opening the door to accepting less money to stay with the Warriors, ride out an era that could produce more rings and benefit from defenses paying more attention to Durant and Curry. During an interview postgame Monday with TNT, Thompson said, regarding the lack-of-respect perception: \u201cI don\u2019t care. I get paid handsomely, I play in a great place in the Bay Area, and we compete for championships year in and year out. And that\u2019s hard to do. A lot of guys never get that opportunity. So I\u2019m grateful just to be part of this team. We\u2019ve got such a good thing going.\u201d Does that sound like someone who wants or need a change of scenery? Thompson did something uncharacteristic for him in Game 1. After drilling a wide-open 3-pointer, he turned to the crowd and raised three fingers and blew a kiss. Maybe a little bit of Draymond Green rubbed off on Thompson. Or maybe Thompson was just feeling it. He anticipates Game 2  will be a different flavor and that the Warriors will see a desperate Rockets team, one that won\u2019t leave him open as often. \u201cI don\u2019t think they will,\u201d he said. \u201cI think they\u2019re going to make adjustments. You can\u2019t relax in the playoffs because the next game comes at you fast. Anyway, we haven\u2019t done anything yet. There\u2019s still more work to be done. We know what we\u2019re up against.\u201d The Warriors can afford to stay true to themselves in Game 2. Meanwhile, the adjustments are all with the Rockets. Do they dare go solo against Durant, who scored 37 points? Same with Curry, who\u2019s rounding into form? And do they pay more respect to Thompson, or take their chances again? There are no easy answers, only easy baskets for the Warriors if you don\u2019t choose wisely. Veteran NBA writer Shaun Powell has worked for newspapers and other publications for more than 25 years.

It\u2019s about staying the course, even during a time when it seems obvious to everyone else that change is needed. Those 45 isolation plays by just two players, James Harden and Chris Paul, couldn\u2019t deliver the Rockets the win they needed. But what looked like a stubborn reliance on a scheme that proved futile against the Warriors Monday night, looked a bit different after the Rockets spent the night dwelling on what went wrong. The Warriors shook the Rockets\u2019 foundation, hit them with so many shots it left them reeling. \u201cYeah, we got a little rattled with ourselves and we can\u2019t do that,\u201d Rockets coach Mike D\u2019Antoni said. \u201cLike I said, we\u2019ve got to be able to absorb some body blows. They got us a little bit. We sagged a little bit with our spirit. That won\u2019t happen Wednesday [in Game 2, 9 ET on TNT ]. We\u2019re going to have a heck of a good battle on Wednesday.\u201d A battle that will include the Rockets feasting on a steady diet of the isolation plays that led them to the league\u2019s best record, a franchise-best 65 wins during the regular season. Too much Harden? Too much Paul? Way too much iso ball? D\u2019Antoni doesn\u2019t want to hear it, not after all they have done to get here. \u201cThat\u2019s what we do,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are who we are, and we\u2019re pretty good at it. We can\u2019t get off who we are. Embrace it. Just be better of who we are and don\u2019t worry if somebody else solves the puzzle a different way. Fine, that\u2019s how they solve it. We solve our puzzle this way. We\u2019ve got to play at our strengths. We know our strengths and we\u2019ve just got to do it better. \u201cYou know what? Play through it. So be it. This just comes down to a dogfight. It doesn\u2019t come down to feeling comfortable. Everybody\u2019s feeling uncomfortable. Your hair should be on fire, and you should be playing and spitting blood out there. This is hard stuff to overcome, one of the better teams ever in the history of the NBA. They\u2019ve got to embrace the situation.\u201d The raw numbers are on D\u2019Antoni\u2019s side. Harden and Paul scored 64 points in Game 1, nearly matching the Warriors\u2019 top two scorers (65 combined for Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson combined for 65). So the high scorers all but canceled each other out. Where the Rockets cannot afford to falter this time is with Trevor Ariza, P.J. Tucker and Luc Mbah a Moute are concerned. They combined for nine points, eight from Ariza, who was limited to just 23 minutes and 21 seconds, due to early foul trouble, 11 rebounds and a number of miscues on both ends that contributed to the Rockets\u2019 struggles. These are the three men whose chief responsibility was to deal with Durant defensively and fill in whatever gaps the Rockets needed offensively. Instead, they were the all non-factors. Tucker missed all three of his shots, two from beyond the 3-point line, and Mbah a Moute finished 0-for-6 from the floor, missing three layups and two wide-open 3-pointers. The mistakes are correctible, Ariza said. They watched the film. There weren\u2019t any surprises. The in-game communication issues won\u2019t be an issue going forward. And the confidence they\u2019ve had in their game plan and each other all season, won\u2019t crumble under the pressure of a must-win Game 2. \u201cYeah, the confidence is always here,\u201d Ariza said. \u201cWe are a confident team. We feel like we have two of the best players in the NBA and the players around them are the best at what they do as well. So it\u2019s just about us coming out and knowing that and continuing to play like that.\u201d Harden did his part to make sure his teammates understood exactly what\u2019s at stake. And he\u2019s in lockstep with his coach about the Rockers staying the course the rest of this series. Why change now? \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019ve been doing all year long,\u201d he said. \u201cWe went two months and maybe lost a game or two by doing what we do. So it won\u2019t change; we\u2019ve just got to do it better. They did what they do better than what we do better last night. So we watched film and we\u2019ve just got to do it a little harder.\u201d They need to play with the same \u201cswag\u201d that led them to the top of the heap during the regular season. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019ve had all year,\u201d Harden said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re in this position. Last night at times we didn\u2019t have it. We\u2019ve got to have it the full course of the game, especially playing against the Warriors.\u201d Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

A future that, perhaps, will have less tanking. The draft lottery \u2014 the last before changes come next year to dissuade tanking \u2014 is Tuesday night, and then about 70 players will partake in the draft combine that starts on Wednesday. Those events are both happening in Chicago, as are some various league meetings such as a gathering of NBA general managers and other front-office executives. But the biggest news will be made by 14 pingpong balls that will decide who drafts No. 1 next month. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to see what happens in the lottery first and see where our position is,\u201d Memphis executive vice president of basketball operations John Hollinger said. \u201cThat\u2019s going to dictate a lot of the decisions that come after that and how we use our time after that.\u201d Phoenix has a 25 percent chance of winning the No. 1 pick, followed by Memphis (19.9 percent), Dallas (13.8 percent) and Atlanta (13.7 percent). The rest of the candidates for No. 1 are Orlando (8.8 percent), Chicago (5.3), Sacramento (5.3), Cleveland (2.8), New York (1.7), Philadelphia (1.1), Charlotte (0.8), Detroit (0.7), the Los Angeles Clippers (0.6) and Denver (0.5). Many of those teams were at the center of tanking questions this season. Now they\u2019ll see if it pays off. \u201cWe did this year what we felt was in the long-term best interest of the Bulls,\u201d Chicago vice president of basketball operations John Paxson said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a situation that any of us want to ever be in again. And it goes against everything as a competitive person that you believe in. But it\u2019s the way the system\u2019s set up.\u201d For now. The NBA is changing the system. Starting in 2019, with the NBA hoping that teams have less incentive to strive for the worst record and therefore the best chance of winning the lottery, the odds will be changing. The three teams with the worst regular-season record will each have a 14 percent chance of winning the No. 1 pick, the fourth-worst team will have a 12.5 percent chance and the fifth-worst 10.5 percent. \u201cMy sense is we\u2019re still going to have some work to do,\u201d NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said. Tanking got plenty of attention this season, and a few minutes on Jan. 29 might have decided the race. Phoenix and Memphis played that night. The Grizzlies scored 42 points in the second quarter \u2013 their only 40-point period all season \u2014 and forced the Suns into 10 consecutive misses in one stretch, on the way to a 120-109 win. The Suns finished one game worse than the Grizzlies. Flip that Jan. 29 outcome, and it would been the Grizzlies with the best chance at the No. 1 pick. \u201cThe league has been beating us up right now,\u201d said Phoenix guard Devin Booker, who hasn\u2019t come even close to making the playoffs and is already on the fourth head coach of his three-year career now that the Suns have hired Igor Kokoskov. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s going to be motivational for us. I know for myself, working out, I think about that all the time. I never want to be in these situations again.\u201d The new lottery format isn\u2019t the only looming change related to drafts. It seems likely that by 2020, the one-and-done rule \u2014 in place since 2006 \u2014 will be gone and players will be allowed to jump from high school directly to the NBA again. If that was the case this season, the rights to draft phenoms like R.J. Barrett, Zion Williamson and Cameron Reddish would probably be decided by those pingpong balls in Chicago on Tuesday. Instead, they\u2019re all going to Duke this fall. So they won\u2019t be at the combine, nor will the likely top two picks in the June 21 draft \u2013 Arizona\u2019s Deandre Ayton, and Slovenia\u2019s Luka Doncic. Ayton declined the invitation to participate in Chicago, and Doncic\u2019s season in Europe isn\u2019t over yet. \u201cWe sort of expected this, that we might not see the top couple guys there,\u201d Hollinger said. \u201cSo we just have to adjust from that and get our information in other ways.\u201d"},{"id":46862,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-milwaukee-bucks-meeting-ettore-messina-mike-budenholzer","date":"2018-05-15","title":"Report: Milwaukee Bucks' front office meeting with Ettore Messina, Mike Budenholzer","content":" The Milwaukee Bucks\u2019 search for their next coach hasn\u2019t reached its conclusion yet, but the short list of contenders for the job may be coming into focus. Per ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski, the Bucks\u2019 front office is meeting with two finalists for the job \u2014 San Antonio Spurs assistant coach Ettore Messina and former Atlanta Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer \u2014 in New York today. Reports surfaced yesterday that Budenholzer was being heavily wooed by the Bucks (and the Toronto Raptors) for their coaching vacancy. Here\u2019s more from Wojnarowski on the state of the Bucks\u2019 coaching search : Budenholzer was named NBA Coach of the Year in 2015 and coached the Atlanta Hawks from 2013-18. He went 213-197 in that span and led the Hawks to their first-ever 60-win season in \u201914-15. He and Atlanta parted ways shortly after the 2017-18 season ended. . Joe Prunty held the Bucks\u2019 coaching job \u2014 albeit on an interim basis \u2014 for most of last season after taking over once coach Jason Kidd was fired on Jan. 22 . Prunty went 21-16 and led the Bucks to the playoffs, where they fell to the Boston Celtics in Game 7 of the first round . Messina coached the Spurs in Games 3, 4 and 5 of the team\u2019s first-round series with the Golden State Warriors. Popovich missed those games while grieving the death of his wife, Erin, who died during the series after battling a prolonged illness . Popovich has coached the team since 1997-98 and is the longest-tenured coach in the NBA. He will also be coaching Team USA before the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo. Aside from this interview with Messina, the Bucks were set to interview fellow Spurs assistant coach Becky Hammon and former Cleveland Cavaliers coach David Blatt for their vacancy as well."},{"id":46877,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/boston-celtics-switching-defense-pays-dividends-2018-playoffs","date":"2018-05-15","title":"Boston Celtics' defense keeps showing its pliability, might in 2018 playoffs","content":" * Tonight on ESPN:  Cavs vs. Celtics, Game 2 (8:30 ET) Most of the best defenses in the NBA switch screens liberally. In both conference finals series, who is guarding whom at the beginning of any possession doesn\u2019t matter much, because screens will be set and defensive assignments will change on the fly, with the offense looking to get the opponent\u2019s weakest defender switched onto one of their best players. Defenses are generally willing to live with mismatches in order to stay in front of ball-handlers and avoid having to help with extra defenders. If you start rotating, the ball can move faster than your rotations and eventually find an open man. If you can stay out of rotation, you can stay at home on shooters and force the opponent to play one-on-one, either on the perimeter or in the post. The Boston Celtics became the No. 1 defensive team in the league this season, largely because they added size at all three perimeter positions, enabling them to switch more often and more successfully. Even with their injuries, the Celtics have six very switchable defenders in their playoff rotation. As Philadelphia 76ers coach Brett Brown said in the conference semifinals, \u201cThey got apples for apples on many, many different matchups.\u201d In Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals on Sunday , the Celtics were even willing to switch the 6-foot-1 Terry Rozier (not one of those aforementioned six switchable guys) onto LeBron James. On some possessions, they tried to switch out of that mismatch before the Cavs could take advantage. Here\u2019s Al Horford trying to replace Rozier in the James matchup\u2026 On others, they had to send a double-team\u2026 The Cavs got some open shots out of that mismatch, but missed some of those open shots and maybe didn\u2019t attack it enough. And for the most part, the Celtics were able to keep James away from the basket, which is, obviously, priority No. 1 when playing the Cavs. James entered the conference finals having averaged 14.4 points per game on 77 percent shooting in the restricted area through the first two rounds of the playoffs. The 14.4 was tied with his 14.4 in last year\u2019s playoffs for the most he\u2019s averaged in the restricted area in any postseason (or regular season). James\u2019 jumper, meanwhile, has been erratic in these playoffs. He shot well from mid-range, but just 15-for-52 (29 percent) from 3-point range over the first two series . In only three of his 11 playoff games had he shot well from outside the paint. Against the Indiana Pacers in the first round , he was 9-for-14 from the outside in Game 2 and 8-for-14 in Game 7. In Game 2 in Toronto of the East semifinals (The Fadeaway Game), James shot 10-for-16 from outside the paint. Though the Celtics outscored the Cavs 60-38 in the paint in Game 1, Boston had only three more shots in the restricted area (30) than Cleveland did (27) . And the Cavs\u2019 27 restricted-area attempts were three more than they got in any game in the first round vs. Indiana. But the Celtics\u2019 30 attempts were, on average, better looks than the Cavs\u2019 27. That was in part because the Cavs that defended the most shots at the rim were Jordan Clarkson, Jeff Green, George Hill and Kyle Korver and in part because James only took five of the Cavs\u2019 27 restricted-area shots . He averaged about nine restricted-area attempts in the Indiana series and more than 10 against Toronto in the conference semifinals . Giving up just five in 36 minutes is a win (and resulted in a win) for Boston. It\u2019s also in line with what the Celtics did to the league\u2019s two most LeBron-like players in the first two rounds of the playoffs. In the first round, the Milwaukee Bucks\u2019 Giannis Antetokounmpo averaged 8.3 shots in the restricted area after averaging a league-high 9.3 in the regular season . And in the conference semis, the Sixers\u2019 Ben Simmons averaged just 6.6 attempts in the restricted area after averaging 8.6 in the first round vs. Miami . Maybe 22 shots in the restricted area from other Cavs is too much. But those shots ( video ) were often rushed and contested, with the exception of a few tip-ins and one clean roll to the basket from Tristan Thompson . While the Celtics\u2019 goal with James was to stay in front of him (and they were incredibly successful in doing that), they wanted to put pressure on the other Cavs. The point of the pressure was twofold. First, it was to make the Cavs uncomfortable in trying to run their offense, to push their actions away from the basket and deeper into the shot clock. Second, it was to force the other Cavs to put the ball on the floor. \u201cWe speed \u2019em up,\u201d Celtics forward Marcus Smart said after practice Monday. \u201cWhen we pressure, it\u2019s hard for them to get to their spots. It\u2019s hard for them to get into their stuff. Then it just causes a rushed shots that they\u2019re probably not used to taking.\u201d Really, now that Kyrie Irving is on their side, there isn\u2019t a Cavalier not named James for the Celtics to be afraid of off the dribble. Here\u2019s Aron Baynes willing to jump out high on Rodney Hood after a hand-off\u2026 Baynes stuck with Hood and contested his shot at the basket. There was more of the same from almost every Boston defender. In addition to their switchability, the Celtics were the league\u2019s No. 1 defense because, whether they switched or not, they were able to stay in front of opposing ball-handlers as well as any team in the league. The Cavs should get a much more aggressive James in Game 2 tonight ( 8:30 p.m. ET, ESPN ). They\u2019ll surely try to attack the Rozier mismatch more than they did in Game 1, and they\u2019ll likely make more of the open shots that that mismatch produces. But other than James or Kevin Love vs. Rozier, there\u2019s not much for the Cavs to take advantage of in this series. If the Celtics can continue to keep James away from the basket and force his teammates to put the ball on the floor, they\u2019ll continue to look like the best defense in the league. * * * John Schuhmann is a staff writer for NBA.com.

He lead the NBA in steals (2.51 a game) and minutes played (42.0 a game), becoming the first player since Michael Jordan in 1992-93 to lead the league in points and steals per game. \u201cI had no space for error.

The \u201cMVP\u201d chants that cascaded from the seats weren\u2019t reserved for him. The stage of this Western Conference finals opener wasn\u2019t specifically designed for him on this floor, yet Kevin Durant took ownership anyway. Of all of it, actually. He upstaged James Harden, here in this city, on a night where both stars appeared unstoppable at times, but it was more than that. Durant was a handful for the Houston Rockets, and gave his coach an earful after being pulled for a well-deserved rest, and totally claimed Game 1 for the Golden State Warriors. And now there\u2019s a more important issue for the Rockets: Will the rest of this series belong to Durant as well? This was the Rockets\u2019 worst nightmare \u2014 losing home-court advantage after working so hard to clinch it, all while looking helpless and clueless against Durant in the process. He punished them early and often no matter who was in his face, hitting a few tough shots, some tougher shots and shots that you shouldn\u2019t try at home. \u201cHe\u2019s seven feet and falling away,\u201d said Rockets coach Mike D\u2019Antoni in disbelief. In other words, a routine day for KD and a rotten one for the poor defender standing in his way. Durant was good for 37 points, less than Harden\u2019s 41 but more impactful and damaging overall. His mid-range game was especially devastating and evidence that Durant is money from any spot on the floor; of his 14 baskets , only three were made from deep. \u201cI was just trying to be aggressive when I had the ball and be forceful when I had the ball,\u201d Durant said. \u201cI was able to knock down a few.\u201d How do you hold a player with his wingspan, high release point and shooting range and accuracy in check \u2026 particularly when he\u2019s three wins from a second straight NBA Finals trip? That is a challenge for anyone for sure, but the Rockets don\u2019t appear to have a KD stopper on the roster. And if they do, he didn\u2019t suit up Monday. Smaller players such as Trevor Ariza and PJ Tucker must deal with Durant\u2019s height advantage. Bigger players like Clint Capela must cope with Durant\u2019s quickness and swoop-ability while risking being pulled away from the rim because of Durant\u2019s shooting range. \u201cWe like to keep the ball moving but Kevin is the ultimate luxury because a play can break down and you just throw him the ball,\u201d Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. \u201cHe can get you a bucket as well as anybody on Earth.\u201d The last time Durant looked this locked in for a game of some magnitude was last June in the NBA Finals, when he puzzled the Cavs with pull-up 3-pointers on the run. Any adjustment the Rockets make for Game 2 must also consider that any double-team thrown in Durant\u2019s direction will give open looks to Klay Thompson and Stephen Curry. And so: shall it be death by drowning or poisoning? Those are always the choices when game-planning for a team with multiple weapons like the Warriors (actually, no other team like them exists in the NBA). In one sense, Durant gave the Rockets less to think about. He just took it upon himself to set the tone and trigger the two runs that sealed Game 1 for Golden State, getting 13 in the third quarter when an otherwise close game flipped. Durant was so hell-bent on finishing off the Rockets and stealing their precious home-court advantage \u2014 along with their soul \u2014 that he snorted in Kerr\u2019s direction when pulled late in the third. He wasn\u2019t wrong though: with KD benched, the Rockets closed within five points. \u201cWhy?\u201d Durant asked. Then again, with attitude: \u201cWhy?\u201d Later, Kerr smiled and said: \u201cKevin\u2019s never happy when he comes out of the game, no matter when I take him out. Even in the preseason he\u2019s upset if I take him out. He wasn\u2019t thrilled and I probably should\u2019ve left him in \u2026 he was going pretty well. They went on a quick run but he came back in and got us on track again.\u201d Durant immediately swished a jumper, and then another basket was followed with Durant drawing a charge on Eric Gordon. With that, first blood in this series was drawn by the Warriors. \u201cI wanted to stay in the game, but the best part of it is I trust coach and we can move past those conversations pretty quick,\u201d Durant said. Can they move past the Rockets just as quickly? This series gave the appearance of a possible epic, and it still might be just that, except the opener fizzled in the Rockets\u2019 face. Just like that, the home-court advantage now belongs to the Warriors, and this highly-anticipated series will get a gut-punch Wednesday if Golden State takes a pair in Houston. The bad news for the Rockets is the Warriors aren\u2019t bored anymore \u2014 that was so two weeks ago. Once Curry returned from his knee injury and the Warriors crept closer to the West finals, the sense of urgency provided Golden State its needed face-slap. So, no, the Rockets aren\u2019t catching them off guard. The Warriors are very much on guard and focused on keeping the Larry O\u2019Brien trophy. That\u2019s why Draymond Green received a technical less than two minutes into the game and then flirted with going nuts before the first quarter buzzer. He was that wired. \u201cI think I was a bit overzealous, a bit amped up but I\u2019d rather be that any day than coming out flat,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll take that and live with the results.\u201d That\u2019s also why the Warriors rallied twice after falling behind early, stealing any momentum or hope the Rockets had. Houston had Harden, and he was indeed MVP-worthy, drilling step-back jumpers and chopping up the Warriors near the rim, where he dropped layups or drew fouls. Yet in typical Harden fashion, he finished with 41 points \u2026 and a minus-7 in Game 1. Still, this game and this result were due largely to Durant and the inability of the Rockets to do anything with him. \u201cI think my favorite moment was the one where he drove the baseline and he rose up over two guys,\u201d Green said. \u201cLike, he was flying and leaning out of bounds. Kind of a little stick shot. They played great defense on that play, so for him to still hit that shot, it was tough.\u201d Again, if that\u2019s how Durant will roll, what\u2019s Houston to do? \u201cHe\u2019s been doing it for so long, man,\u201d Harden said. \u201cHe can shoot over anybody, so we\u2019ve got to do a better job of being physical. Getting him off his spots, a better job of contesting and making it even harder for him.\u201d Basically, the Rockets plan to do what nobody has done since Durant came to the Warriors: Stop him in the postseason. He averaged 28.5 points on 55 percent shooting (44 from deep) last season. He\u2019s at 28 and 49 percent through nine games in the 2018 playoffs. With all due respect to the Rockets, Durant owns the spring, this series so far and there\u2019s no foreclosure in sight. * * * Veteran NBA writer Shaun Powell has worked for newspapers and other publications for more than 25 years.

One bad rotation, followed by a missed layup on the back of yet another dagger from the other team and even a mighty, 65-win juggernaut can see it all unravel. The Houston Rockets know the feeling now, after living through it on what could turn out to be the biggest night of the best (regular) season in the history of the franchise. They invited the Golden State Warriors in, dared to beat the reigning NBA champions at their own game in these Western Conference finals with an emphatic win \u2026 and came up woefully short of that goal in Game 1 of the series . The home-court advantage they worked for all throughout a brilliant season is gone. The comfort the Rockets were provided after securing a 2-1 regular-season record against the Warriors was blown away in just four quarters. Whatever aura they thought they owned heading into the Toyota Center Monday night for Game 1, they shed long before the final seconds of their decisive 119-106 loss to the Warriors. It looked good early, when James Harden had the Rockets rolling to a nine-point lead in the frenzied opening minutes. But Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Stephen Curry and Co. \u2014 making their fourth straight appearance in the conference finals \u2014 didn\u2019t fold at the first sign of danger. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to just come in and knock them out,\u201d Rockets coach Mike D\u2019Antoni said. \u201cI mean, there\u2019s just too many times we had mental lapses. We either didn\u2019t switch properly or we didn\u2019t switch hard enough. We turned the ball over little too much. Every time we missed a layup, which we missed a lot of layups, they ran out. \u201cThey\u2019re really devastating. We\u2019ve got to make layups, don\u2019t turn it over and do a little bit better job of mentally just staying up on people.\u201d The fact that they were starting this series away from the friendly confines of Oracle Arena for the first time during their recent run did nothing to shake their belief in themselves. And if there is anything that is clear after just four wild quarters of this most anticipated series, it\u2019s that the Warriors\u2019 collective confidence is far superior to the artificial skin the Rockets wrapped themselves in leading up to the opening round of this heavyweight fight. Harden played inspired, for most of his 35 minutes, finishing with a game-high 41 points and seven assists . Chris Paul\u2019s 23 points, 11 rebounds and three assists also look good on paper. But it wasn\u2019t enough. It was nowhere near enough to offset the Rockets\u2019 self-inflicted mistakes or the fury the Warriors can rain down on their opponents this time of year. \u201cThey\u2019re obviously champions for a reason,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said. \u201cIf we want to beat them, we have to be mentally sharper. KD, he\u2019s tough. Obviously, he was on tonight. Hey, you can live with that. But you can\u2019t live with that and then make mental mistakes, and that\u2019s what we do. The combination of the two was devastating.\u201d Durant was bent on devastation, torching an assortment of Rockets defenders for his 37 points. Thompson drilled the Rockets for 28 points of his own, his 15 attempts 3-point attempts serving as a more demoralizing dagger for a Rockets defense designed to limit them. With so much attention on that pair of players, the Rockets seemed to lose their defensive focus on basically everyone else. \u201cDefensively, we\u2019ve got to be better,\u201d Paul said. \u201cYou know it\u2019s funny, I got caught helping a couple times in the first half and I think Nick Young hit three (3-pointers) off those plays. Some games, some series, you may make those mistakes and guys don\u2019t make the shots. But tonight, every time we did it, they made the shot. They make you pay when you make mistakes.\u201d Just to be clear about what kind of armor the Warriors travel with these days, they\u2019ve won a game on the road in 18 consecutive playoff series. That means it started well before the Durant era. As much as this series is about the back-and-forth between Durant and Harden (who reached The Finals as teammates on the Oklahoma City Thunder in 2012 ), it\u2019s about Curry, Thompson, Green and 2015 Finals MVP Andre Iguodala. Those are the other four members of the Warriors\u2019 \u201cHamptons Five\u201d lineup that started Game 1, that withstood everything the Rockets threw at them Monday and then beat Houston down the stretch in the series-opener. \u201cThey\u2019re a good team,\u201d Eric Gordon said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been playing together, they know who they are. They\u2019ve been to four straight Western Conference finals. We just got to be a little better.\u201d The Rockets\u2019 must-win game is Wednesday ( 9 ET, TNT ). The pressure shifts to a Game 2 effort that has to be much better offensively if they want to keep pace with the Warriors. They\u2019ll also need a much cleaner effort that doesn\u2019t include sloppiness (the Warriors converted 16 turnovers into 17 points) and deficient defense (the Warriors shot .525 overall and .394 on 3-pointers) that was on display in Game 1. These are all things D\u2019Antoni believes to be correctable. And they could be. Indeed, they better be if the Rockets plan on stretching this series to the limit. Because there is still no way to account for the experience factor, the muscle memory edge the Warriors have when it comes to recognizing the time and place to apply the ultimate pressure on an opponent that\u2019s ready to break. They sniffed it late in the third quarter, when the Rockets were reeling under a relentless barrage of Durant buckets. The only thing that saved them then were crucial baskets of their own from Eric Gordon and Gerald Green, and Warriors coach Steve Kerr subbing Durant out for a breather the Warriors closer did not want. \u201cYeah, he wasn\u2019t really thrilled and I probably should have left him in,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cLate third he was going pretty well. I knew I had to get him some rest at some point. As soon as I took him out, they went on a quick run, so he was not thrilled. But he came back in and got us back on track.\u201d You can toy with a team like the Minnesota Timberwolves in the first round, dropping Game 3 on the road only to come back and close out the series with back-to-back wins, especially when you are clearly the superior team and own that coveted home-court advantage. You might be able to get away with it in next round against a team like the Utah Jazz, when you lose home-court advantage in Game 2, but are are once again clearly the superior team and win three straight games to squash that challenge. Slip up a third time, as the Rockets did Monday night, against a team that has won two of the last three Larry O\u2019Brien trophies, a team with their sights set on a third, and \u2026 and there might not be another chance. * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

It is sniper\u2019s work, done from afar and bloodless except for its impact. Korver shoots and, as often as not, by the time the damage is done, he\u2019s heading the other way, scurrying up one sideline or the other, easy to miss if you aren\u2019t watching closely. \u201cStealthy? Huh. I suppose, maybe, there\u2019s something to that,\u201d Korver said, sitting courtside at TD Garden Monday morning in advance of the Cleveland Cavaliers\u2019 off-day workout. Well, it wasn\u2019t exactly stealthy in Game 1 Sunday. As snipers go, Korver and his cohorts would have been guilty of friendly fire, damaging Cleveland\u2019s effort in the opener of the Eastern Conference finals against Boston with a 4-for-26 spraying, including an 0-for-14 start. Whether those shots are dropping or not, though, Korver\u2019s game is predicated on getting lost by the defense. He wants to shed his man and be as neglected as possible until it\u2019s too late. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of how I\u2019ve always played,\u201d the veteran of 15 NBA seasons said. \u201cEspecially on the kind of team we have. If we can pull attention away from the basket, that gives our guys room to operate. Especially LeBron, and Kevin on postups. That\u2019s a lot of what I\u2019m asked to do on this team and that\u2019s the way I\u2019ve played a good part of my career, too. Find the cracks out there.\u201d Korver, 37, has made a living from that, and an efficient one at that. He ranks fourth all-time in 3-point field goals (2,213), behind only Ray Allen, Reggie Miller and Jason Terry. His career accuracy \u2013 43.1 percent \u2013 ranks sixth and he has launched more shots from the arc (5,130) than any of those ahead of him on that list. But wait, there\u2019s more: Korver\u2019s value to winning basketball is backed up by his splits. In the regular season, Cleveland went 31-15 when he made at least two 3-pointers. When he played but made one or none, the Cavaliers were 12-15. In the playoffs? They are 6-1 with at least two Korver 3-pointers, 2-3 so far with fewer. Korver played in 73 games this season. In the 43 victories, he shot 49.1 percent on 3-pointers. In the 30 defeats, just 35.9 percent. The pattern holds for his career, just a little less pronounced: 46 percent in victories, 39 percent in losses. So Korver going 1-for-5 Sunday at TD Garden \u2013 along with J.R. Smith, Kevin Love and George Hill combining for 2-for-9 \u2013 meant the Cavs were in trouble even without a glance at the scoreboard. \u201cThree-point shots are a part of our DNA,\u201d said LeBron James, who missed all five of his shots from distance. \u201cIt\u2019s what makes us the best team that we can be. Even early on with the shots that we had, we had some wide-open looks that just didn\u2019t go. \u201cWe\u2019re OK with that. We\u2019re absolutely OK with that.\u201d Cleveland coach Tyronn Lue\u2019s lineup for Game 1 was his preferred group: James, Love, Korver, Smith and Hill, which puts four deep threats around the defense-busting, attention-hoarding James. That might change, though, for Game 2. Boston had it too easy at the rim, romping to a 60-38 advantage in points in the paint. So it\u2019s possible Lue will start big man Tristan Thompson at center or at least boost his minutes from the 21 he played Sunday. That would shift Love to power forward, push Korver or Smith to the bench and give the Cavs a more traditional look. Just for the record: When the Cavaliers have won this season, they have averaged 13.2 3-pointers on 41.1 percent shooting. When they\u2019ve lost, it\u2019s been 10.0 treys on 31.1 percent. It could be a matter of picking one\u2019s poison. Does Cleveland want to risk getting outscored by 22 points inside again or by 21 points (the Celtics sank 11) from the arc? \u201cI don\u2019t think you turn away from it,\u201d Korver said. \u201cThe playoffs are a chess match, with adjustments every game. You\u2019re not going to reinvent yourself in the middle of a playoff series. We know who we are and where we\u2019ve been. But Tristan\u2019s been a big part of that, too.\u201d Korver said the number of 3-point shooters on the floor at one time isn\u2019t the issue for Cleveland. Having the ones who are out there make shots and getting off to a better start matters more. Three minutes into Game 1, the Celtics went on a 17-0 run and outscored the Cavs by 21 the rest of the quarter. \u201cIt\u2019s hard when you get down. You start pressing a little bit trying to get back in the game,\u201d Korver said. Are shots harder to make when your team is down a ton, Korver was asked. \u201cThat\u2019s a game-by-game thing,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes when you\u2019re down that happens. The correct mindset is supposed to be \u2018Chip away, chip away, chip away.\u2019 But sometimes when you\u2019re down, you\u2019re like, \u2018Let\u2019s get this going.\u2019 I had a couple looks early that maybe were a little quick.\u201d Smith talked after Game 1 of the Boston players\u2019 length defensively, giving them the ability to close gaps and contest shots that might otherwise be available. Korver pointed more to the Celtics sniffing out and thwarting the Cavaliers\u2019 first options, with Cleveland slow to get into Plans B or C. As for defense, the Cavs might want to play it with some verve whether their last shot dropped or not. There\u2019s nothing wrong with the shooting background at TD Garden, Korver said. And his team\u2019s main players have all the experience they need on this stage. \u201cEvery game is its own thing in the playoffs,\u201d said Korver, who has appeared in 121 postseason games across 12 years. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in them long enough, you understand. If a playoff series goes six or seven games, it\u2019s like a rollercoaster. Your emotions are so up, then they\u2019re so down. \u2018You can\u2019t do anything right! Then everything\u2019s going your way!\u2019 \u201cSo it\u2019s important for us to stay level-headed. They have the Game 1 win, whether it was 25 or it was by two. We feel like we can play a lot better.\u201d So many fans and media folks define Cleveland\u2019s playoff runs by James, who has a personal stranglehold on the Eastern Conference dating back through 2011. But others have skin in this game, too. Korver took it hard when the Cavaliers got ousted in five games from The Finals last June by Golden State. These opportunities eventually end, sooner when you\u2019re already 37. \u201cI\u2019ve never won the last game of my season,\u201d Korver said, staring off into middle distance for a moment. \u201cOn any level, I\u2019ve never won the last game. Offseasons hurt when you lose the last game.\u201d Korver averaged just 4.4 points in the 2017 Finals, making 5 of 16 3-pointers (31.3 percent) and 3 of 12 as the Warriors grabbed 3-0 control of the championship series. \u201cIt definitely hit something a little deeper than usual,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter you\u2019ve played that long and then you have this emotional \u2026\u201d Here, Korver imitated the sound of something big imploding. \u201cYou have this minute where you\u2019re, like, drained,\u201d he said. \u201cBut then I think too, coming into a new year with this team, seeing what your role\u2019s going to be, seeing where your shots are going to come, you try to find new places where you can get looks. You\u2019ve got to find new places where you can be active.\u201d Korver\u2019s season was tumultuous. In addition to the drama instigated by Kyrie Irving\u2019s trade request, its emotional aftermath and eventually a convulsive transformation of the roster at the February trade deadline, the veteran shooter was hampered by a nagging right foot injury. And then \u2013 blowing everything basketball related out of the water \u2013 the death of his 27-year-old brother Kirk from a sudden illness in March. Korver has worked through that with his faith and his family, with basketball as an escape and diversion too. He spoke more about the intricacies of bobbing, weaving, cutting and finding ways to get open. \u201cA lot of times, I\u2019ve felt \u2013 you talked about roaming the sidelines \u2013 like I\u2019ve got to find ways to cross the court,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve got to find new ways to be in and out. Even if it\u2019s not me shooting, but just moving and setting screens. Stay active. Stay involved. That\u2019s important for me. \u201cOtherwise you stand there waiting, and you\u2019re trying to catch a rocket and shoot real fast. Sometimes that goes well, sometimes it doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s a hard thing to do. That\u2019s my job.\u201d After Game 2 of the first round, when LeBron James repeatedly bull-rushed his way to the rim, scored 16 consecutive points early and got 46 overall to restore equilibrium for Cleveland, Indiana coach Nate McMillan almost sounded fine with that. Applying the NBA\u2019s new math, at least that meant McMillan\u2019s opponent was scoring by 2s rather than 3s. \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of team philosophies that would say yes to that,\u201d Korver said. \u201cToday\u2019s NBA is, \u2018Make \u2018em shoot a contested 2. Don\u2019t let guys get 3s.\u2019 It\u2019s amazing, because you watch somebody like LeBron seemingly scoring at will some days, getting whatever he wants in the paint. But a lot of teams will be OK with that.\u201d The same when Toronto\u2019s C.J. Miles didn\u2019t dare help off Korver in the left corner in Game 3 of the conference semis, even as James veered close for his wide-angle bank shot off the glass. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to give up corner 3s ever,\u201d Korver said. That\u2019s not just (to) me, it\u2019s everyone. Offensive strategy is to put someone in the corner so it spreads things for other guys. It\u2019s a big part of what offense is in the NBA today.\u201d It\u2019s the style Cleveland must maintain, as stealthily as possible. Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

He was an assistant with the Suns from 2008 to 2013 and became a U.S. citizen during a ceremony on the court at Phoenix\u2019s Talking Stick Resort Arena. \u201dWe really, as a family, the Family Kokoskov, consider Phoenix as a home base,\u201d he said. \u201dThis is always home base.\u201d Although he certainly has paid the traditional dues as an NBA assistant, he knows he\u2019ll also have the label \u201dforeign coach.\u201d Kokoskov praised the \u201dcourage\u201d of Suns owner Robert Sarver and the team\u2019s management to hire a \u201drookie coach, international coach, foreign coach.\u201d \u201dI kind of carry some responsibilities because, if this fails, then American media and the public are going to say, \u2018See, they can\u2019t coach. We\u2019ve got to stick with our guys,\u201d\u2019 Kokoskov said. But any ultimate judgment, he said, will come from what happens on the court. \u201dIt\u2019s all about winning,\u201d Kokoskov said. \u201dIt doesn\u2019t really matter if you\u2019re an international or American coach. All that matters is can you get it done and can you coach?\u201d He inherits a team that went 21-61, worst in the NBA and second-worst in franchise history. The Suns haven\u2019t made the playoffs in eight seasons but do have the most ping pong balls in Tuesday night\u2019s lottery to determine what team gets the No. 1 overall pick, Still, Kokoskov said the Suns have \u201da good solid foundation.\u201d \u201dWith a couple of guys maybe we\u2019re going to add, obviously we are expecting a lot from the upcoming draft and free agency,\u201d he said. \u201dThat is something that we have a long summer to discuss, to talk, but the foundation is there.\u201d Kokoskov, who coached Slovenia to the EuroBasket 2017 championship, said he\u2019s not wedded to any particular style of play, that it will depend on the talent at hand. When he was with the Suns, there was Steve Nash and it was a fast pace. \u201dI was fortunate to be part of a winning team and be part of the team with Steve Nash and Grant Hill and the rest of the guys,\u201d he said, \u201dbeing part of the staff with Alvin Gentry.\u201d Kokoskov was there when the Suns advanced to the Western Conference Finals in 2010. But the years have not been kind to the once-vibrant franchise since Nash\u2019s departure. General manager Ryan McDonough has said the time is now to inject some more experienced talent into the current mix of youngsters, who are led by burgeoning star Devin Booker. Kokoskov gets the task of trying to fulfill that ambition. The team, he said, needs to be playing on television in June, and he wasn\u2019t talking about its perennial appearance in the draft lottery. \u201dI think the city of Phoenix deserves that,\u201d Kokoskov said. \u201dI think the fans that love basketball deserve that and we\u2019ll do our best to bring this organization and team into that path. We want to be in June on TV.\u201d"},{"id":40508,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/lineup-change-possible-lebron-james-cleveland-cavaliers-look-bounce-back","date":"2018-05-14","title":"Lineup change possible as LeBron James, Cleveland Cavaliers look to bounce back","content":"BOSTON (AP) \u2014 Put Kevin Love\u2019s name atop the list of the Cavaliers that walked out of Cleveland\u2019s 25-point Eastern Conference finals Game 1 loss to Boston a little staggered, but with an unbowed head. The reason: He\u2019s got a teammate by the name of LeBron James that\u2019s had a way of responding after lopsided playoff defeats. Just ask the Indiana Pacers. The Pacers stunned the Cavs at home in their first-round opener , rolling to an 18-point victory. In Game 2, James was all but unstoppable as he replied with a 46-point, 12-rebound performance. \u201dI expect him to have a big response,\u201d Love said of James on Monday. \u201dHe\u2019s always done it. Even before he came back to Cleveland and since I\u2019ve been here he\u2019s always responded big. \u2026. He\u2019s going to approach this game as one that he\u2019s going to have to lead and bounce back.\u201d Even if James does have a big Game 2 Tuesday night in Boston, he\u2019ll need some help \u2013 and the Cavaliers know it. Love said he thought the Cavs were a \u201dlittle soft\u201d in the first half in Game 1. Getting tougher could mean a lineup change for the Cavaliers. Coach Tyronn Lue acknowledged that he was at the least considering inserting Tristan Thompson into the lineup after Boston\u2019s Al Horford had his way in Game 1, scoring 20 points on 8-of-10 shooting. \u201dIt\u2019s definitely something we have to weigh,\u201d Lue said. \u201dWe weighed it before the series started, but we\u2019d won seven out of eight and we weren\u2019t going to adjust until someone beat us and we didn\u2019t play well with that lineup and that got us to this point.\u201d Lue said numbers showed that in the last three years, out of all the players that have guarded Horford over at least 30 possessions, Thompson is No. 1 in the league defending him. \u201dSo that\u2019s a good thing to know,\u201d Lue said. Boston also outscored Cleveland 60-38 in the paint. That, JR Smith said, is a sign James\u2019 supporting cast needs to do more. \u201dWe\u2019ve got to help \u2018Bron,\u201d he said. \u201dWe can\u2019t just expect him to do everything. As role players, we\u2019ve got to play our role.\u201d Thompson came off the bench Sunday but has fared well opposite Horford in the past. Change would mean going away from the three-guard lineup of Smith, George Hill and Kyle Korver, along with James and Love. That lineup tormented the Raptors last series. Thompson said the Cavs weren\u2019t able to \u201dclean up the boo-boo on our lips\u201d after the Celtics\u2019 initial run in Game 1. \u201dI think as a team, 1 through 5, we gotta all play tougher,\u201d Thompson said. \u201dObviously, when I check in the game I try to bring that toughness and that energy. But our starters gotta be ready to throw the first punch. We need them to do that, we need them to be physical and set a tone early.\u201d He said his past playoff success against Horford has come by him being himself, which means being active early. \u201dHorford is playing very well right now and he\u2019s shooting the crap out of the ball,\u201d Thompson said. \u201dWhen I go check into the game, whether it\u2019s him or (Aron) Baynes I just try to run the floor, set pick-and-rolls and just try to work him on both ends so that hopefully by the second half his legs might be a little tired where he might not make that three that he makes in the first half.\u201d Boston doesn\u2019t seem concerned about who the Cavs put on the floor. The Celtics feel they are a much different team than the one that trudged into last year\u2019s conference finals matchup with Cleveland still toting the emotional baggage of helping teammate Isaiah Thomas cope with the death of his sister. Boston also started that series on just a days\u2019 rest following a draining seven-game series with Washington . None of that is a factor this time around for a rebuilt roster that despite being down two All-Stars in Kyrie Irving and Gordon Hayward, has found a synergy with its remaining group. This incarnation of the Celtics is not only young and athletic but playing with a physicality that was missing at times last season. The Celtics\u2019 starters scored 88 points in Game 1, while shooting 58 percent from the field and going 10 of 21 from the 3-point line. Cleveland\u2019s starters scored 46 points, shooting 33 percent from the field and going just 3 of 19 from beyond the arc. \u201dWe got a lot of guys where we just don\u2019t care,\u201d Marcus Smart said. \u201d(Cleveland is) here for a reason, because of the talent that they have. But we have talent as well. \u201dWe have guys that are fearless. So we just go out there and do what we do.\u201d"},{"id":40511,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/new-atlanta-hawks-coach-lloyd-pierce-says-defense-who-i-am","date":"2018-05-14","title":"New Atlanta Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce says defense is 'who I am'","content":"ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 At the start of his first news conference as the Atlanta Hawks coach, Lloyd Pierce looked down at a row filled with four of his new players. His thoughts immediately turned to his passion: Defense. \u201dIf we weren\u2019t doing this press conference right now, I\u2019d probably have these guys doing some defensive drills,\u201d Pierce said Monday. \u201dThat\u2019s who I am.\u201d Pierce, the former Philadelphia 76ers assistant whose agreement to become the Hawks coach was announced Friday , said his first priority will be assembling a staff. Pierce will be looking for assistants who share his passion for defense and his proven ability to connect with young players. A young Atlanta roster is about to add much more youth in next month\u2019s NBA Draft . The Hawks leaned heavily on such young players as rookie John Collins and second-year forward Taurean Prince this season. More youth is coming in the June 21 NBA draft. The Hawks have three first-round picks and hope to land the No. 1 overall pick in Tuesday\u2019s NBA draft lottery. Pierce worked as an assistant with Cleveland, Golden State and Memphis before his five years with Philadelphia. His role in the 76ers\u2019 rebuilding process was especially important to the Hawks, who face a similar challenge after posting the worst record in the Eastern Conference this season. Hawks general manager Travis Schlenk said Pierce\u2019s \u201dexperiences in Philadelphia, keeping that positive vibe, that winning environment with what they went through\u201d helped make him the right fit for the Hawks. Four Hawks players \u2013 DeAndre Bembry, Mike Muscala, Kent Bazemore and Isaiah Taylor \u2013 sat together during the news conference. Bazemore said other players around the league have sent him messages \u201dsaying we got a good one.\u201d \u201dI\u2019m excited,\u201d Bazemore said. \u201d\u2026 Bringing in a defensive-minded guy is important because that\u2019s where championships are won. If we start there, I believe everything else will fall into place.\u201d Bembry said Pierce\u2019s long record as an assistant, especially with the 76ers, who advanced to the Eastern Conference semifinals, earns him immediate credibility. \u201dYou instantly have to respect what he\u2019s done,\u201d Bembry said. \u201dHe damn sure earned his first head coaching job.\u201d One of Pierce\u2019s former Philadelphia players, Robert Covington, also attended the news conference. He said he already was in Atlanta while visiting a family member and so he wanted to show his support for Pierce. \u201dHe\u2019s helped me so much in my career, it\u2019s only right that I be here as well,\u201d Covington said. Asked if he has any doubt Pierce is ready to become a head coach, Covington said \u201dAbsolutely not. I\u2019ve seen coach develop and grow. \u2026 He definitely is a great coach.\u201d Schlenk said he was won over in his first of three interviews with Pierce. He said he told assistant GM Jeff Peterson midway through that interview at a Philadelphia airport hotel that Pierce was their guy. \u201dI just wrote on a little piece of paper and slid it over to Jeff and said \u2018I told you, we\u2019d know,\u201d\u2019 Schlenk said. Pierce joked Monday he wished he had been passed that note. \u201dI\u2019m just trying to figure out how I missed them sliding papers around,\u201d Pierce said. \u201dThey were taking notes but I didn\u2019t really see that exchange. I was focused on my presentation more than anything.\u201d That presentation was on the mark. \u201dHe answered every question right,\u201d Schlenk said. A Hawks group that also included majority owner Tony Ressler met with Pierce in Boston on Tuesday, followed by a third interview in Atlanta on Friday \u2013 hours before the team announced an agreement with Pierce. Pierce, 42, fills the position left vacant when the Hawks and former coach Mike Budenholzer mutually agreed to part ways as Budenholzer interviewed for other jobs, most recently with the Bucks . Schenk again said Monday he and Budenholzer remain on good terms. \u201dI talked with him a couple days ago,\u201d Schlenk said. \u201dNo hard feelings at all.\u201d"},{"id":40524,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/arguing-each-teams-case-nba-draft-lottery-luck","date":"2018-05-14","title":"Arguing for and against each team in the 2018 NBA Draft Lottery","content":" * Tonight on ESPN:  2018 NBA Draft Lottery (7:30 p.m. ET) Luck is fickle, especially in sports. It can gravitate toward one end of the universe and completely ignore the other. On Tuesday, 14 teams will see whether they have earned its attention. On that day, the NBA will bestow the ultimate offseason gift: the No. 1 overall pick. The odds of each team winning that prize are vastly different. We\u2019ll acknowledge that along the way, but the goal here is to delve into the less mathematical and more irrational reasons why \u2013 and why not \u2013 each franchise deserves the lottery balls bouncing its way. Here\u2019s a look at the argument for and against each team\u2019s NBA Draft Lottery luck:  2017-18 record: 46-36 No. 1 pick odds:  0.5 percent Argument for: Since joining the NBA in 1976, four things have eluded the Nuggets: the No. 1 pick, a Rookie of the Year, a Most Valuable Player and a trip to the NBA Finals. That\u2019s a lot of have-nots for one of the league\u2019s older franchises. As for the present-day team, karma should dictate a squad that tried as valiantly as the Nuggets to make the playoffs \u2014 but ultimately fell short \u2014 be rewarded in some way. And if Denver has turned recent middling picks into Nikola Jokic, Jamal Murray and Gary Harris, there\u2019s little doubt they\u2019d make the right call with the top overall selection. Argument against: More talent-barren teams surely need prospects like Deandre Ayton or Luka Doncic more than Denver, which already boasts Jokic and Murray at positions those rookies would likely fill. Besides, who\u2019s to say the Nuggets aren\u2019t better off just out-smarting everyone later in the Draft?  2017-18 record: 42-40 No. 1 pick odds:  0.6 percent Argument for: Is the Clippers\u2019 brief time in the sunshine over just like that? Half a decade of relevance hardly seems enough to make up for 40 years of misery. Don\u2019t they deserve a shot at a No. 1 pick that isn\u2019t injury prone or named Michael Olowokandi? Also, can you imagine team owner Steve Ballmer winning his first No. 1 pick? The guy is a true fan, and would undoubtedly set a new level of post-win enthusiasm. Argument against: The lottery gods must surely frown on a team just four months removed from trading a No. 1 overall pick recently signed to a long-term contract. Don\u2019t forget, it was Blake Griffin \u2014 not Chris Paul \u2014 that served as the first ray of sunshine that finally fell upon Los Angeles\u2019 \u201cother team.\u201d Plus, are we sure the Clippers\u2019 bad luck with top draftees\u2019 health is really gone? 2017-18 record: 39-43 No. 1 pick odds:  0.7 percent Argument for: Detroit\u2019s late-season trade for Griffin was designed to be a push for the playoffs . It wound up being a whimper, but shouldn\u2019t the Pistons get credit for trying to win when their season started to head south? There is more than just earning a top pick at stake here. Detroit\u2019s selection is top-four protected. Otherwise, it goes to the Clippers as part of the Griffin deal. Catch Lady Luck\u2019s eye, and it could very well end up being the trade of the decade for the Pistons. Argument against: Would you trust the Pistons with the No. 1 pick after they passed on Devin Booker and Donovan Mitchell in recent drafts? And no Pistons fan is about to forget who they took No. 2 overall in 2003 \u2026  2017-18 record: 36-46 No. 1 pick odds:  0.8 percent Argument for: Few teams have been as consistently and desperately in need of star power as the Hornets have over the last 15 years. Since 2002, Kemba Walker is their only Hornets Draft pick to make an All-Star team (Baron Davis was the last before Walker to do so), and Walker has struggled to find a stable mix to play alongside in Charlotte. After the Hornets left North Carolina in 2002, Charlotte faithful had to watch as their team \u2014 then the New Orleans Hornets \u2014 drafted Chris Paul (2005) and Anthony Davis (2012). Don\u2019t the Charlotte faithful deserve some Draft fortune after seeing that happen? Argument against: Do the lottery gods dare trust the Hornets with such a prize? Excluding Walker, here are Charlotte\u2019s lottery picks since 2004: Malik Monk, Frank Kaminsky, Noah Vonleh, Cody Zeller, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, Gerald Henderson, D.J. Augustin, Brendan Wright, Adam Morrison, Raymond Felton, Sean May and Emeka Okafor. 2017-18 record: 35-47 No. 1 pick odds:  1.1 percent Argument for 76ers: If this pick lands at the No. 2 or 3 spots, it goes to Boston. If it leaps all the way to No. 1 (or lands anywhere else), it transfers to Philadelphia. As if losing 4-1 to the shorthanded Boston Celtics in the Eastern Conference semifinals wasn\u2019t enough, now the Sixers face the idea of Boston adding Kyrie Irving and Gordon Hayward next season. That\u2019s not fair! Philly needs this No. 1 pick to keep things fair! Side argument for Lakers : Really, shouldn\u2019t the Lakers be rewarded for the Steve Nash trade they made in 2012 ? That deal is why this pick is out of their hands. Nash, who enters the Hall of Fame this summer , played just 60 games in two seasons with Los Angeles due to injury. When he joined Kobe Bryant, Dwight Howard and Pau Gasol, Nash was heralded as the last piece of an All-NBA gathering on the West Coast. Instead, that deal was the death knell for the Lakers\u2019 last era of title contention, and its cost has hung over the franchise ever since. Now, the Lakers get to watch their two oldest rivals circle like vultures around their ping pong balls. Their most satisfying outcome would be for the pick to stay put, part ways with the No. 10 pick and wash their hands of the Nash trade once and for all. Argument against 76ers: The lottery balls have gifted Philadelphia a top-three pick in each of the last four Drafts. Should the \u201cProcess\u201d be rewarded even further? No team should have a lottery monopoly like this! Argument against Lakers: Truth be told, the Lakers have avoided paying the full price for Nash for some time. This pick has been protected \u2014 and fallen under those protections \u2014 three years in a row now. How many teams manage that many strokes of luck \u2014 and land the No. 2 overall pick \u2014 three years running? That recent run merely cements a known fact: the Lakers are already one of the luckiest and most successful teams in NBA history. Any team but Boston could win the championship for the next decade and still not have more banners than those already hanging in Staples Center. Would another turn of bad luck even put a dent in that? 2017-18 record: 29-53 No. 1 pick odds:  1.7 percent Argument for Knicks: For once in recent Knicks history, it looked like the basketball gods had finally smiled upon New York. Kristaps Porzingis, doubted by some Knicks fans after he was taken in the 2015 NBA Draft , was now \u201cThe Unicorn\u201d and versatile All-Star every team wished they had. Then the basketball gods ripped Porzingis away (for now) as he tore his ACL in Feburary . The Latvian big man will likely not return until at least the middle of next season. What do Knicks fans cling to until then? What has their tortured long-suffering earned, if not the No. 1 overall pick? Ayton in The Big Apple or Doncic in Metropolis seems like a good place to start. Overall, New York has suffered unspeakable horrors this century. It\u2019s time to move on and up, once and for all. Argument against Knicks: Past Draft woes are only part of the problem for New York. Taking Jordan Hill over DeMar DeRozan ( in 2009 ). Picking Nene over Amar\u2019e Stoudemire \u2026 and then trading him to Denver for Antonio McDyess ( in 2002 ). Taking Mike Sweetney over David West, Boris Diaw and others ( in 2003 ). Why have so many things that have gone right elsewhere gone so wrong in New York? Carmelo Anthony. Mike D\u2019Antoni. Phil Jackson. McDyess. Dikembe Mutombo. Steve Francis. The lottery gods know. And they will not forgive.  2017-18 record: 28-54 No. 1 pick odds:  2.8 percent Argument for Cavs: LeBron could opt out and leave in free agency this summer. That is all. And it is everything. Side argument for Nets: Like the Lakers, Brooklyn has watched the seismic aftershocks of its ill-advised Kevin Garnett mega-trade in 2013 continue to rattle its cupboards bare for years. Jason Terry, 40, is the only player the Nets acquired in that trade that is still in the league. Fans would love to see this pick stick at eighth overall and then move on with their lives. Argument against Cavs: Cleveland scorch-earthed itself in order to win now with LeBron James. Including his pre-Miami Heat stint, the franchise has now enjoyed an 11-year window with the greatest player of his generation. Most teams in the league have never enjoyed such an opportunity. That South Beach interruption was mollified by not one , not two , but three No. 1 overall picks in the four years James was gone. In a very real way, that is what made James\u2019 return to his home state possible. For Cleveland to luck out again and simultaneously increase its odds of keeping James would be unfathomably \u2014 and enviably \u2014 fortunate. Side argument against Nets: The 2013 offseason trade for Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce, Terry and others in the end left the Nets in dire straits. Brooklyn mortgaged four first-round picks for a failed attempt to win now\/then. The last of those picks becoming No. 1 overall would serve as a reminder to the Nets (and others) to avoid making that same mistake again.  2017-18 record: 27-55 No. 1 pick odds:  5.3 percent Argument for Kings: Despite holding the NBA\u2019s longest playoff drought (12 seasons), the Kings have been unbelievably unlucky when it comes to the ping pong balls. Sacramento\u2019s highest pick in that span was No. 4 in 2009 \u2014 the year they had the best chance in the league of landing the top overall selection. At least their previous bad eras were compensated with No. 1 picks! Let the spirits of Hot Rod Hundley, Sid Green, Bob Boozer, Oscar Robertson and Pervis Ellison infuse the Kings with the luck they need! Argument against Kings: It is hard to root for a team that makes luck work harder than it should. Poor Draft decisions combined with even worse in-season trades have made good fortune an underdog in this fight. We\u2019ll just address the Draft-related woes here:  2017-18 record: 27-55 No. 1 pick odds:  5.3 percent Argument for Bulls: For the first time in NBA history, the Draft Lottery is not being held in New York or New Jersey. Its new location: Chicago. Talk about a timely home-court advantage. On a more serious note, Bulls fans can surely argue that the shelf-life of their last No. 1 overall pick \u2014 Derrick Rose \u2014 was far too short. After surviving his injuries and nailing the 30th overall pick in 2011 \u2014 Jimmy Butler, who was traded last summer to Minnesota for a now-promising young core \u2014 a little luck isn\u2019t too much to ask for, is it? Argument against Bulls: The fun factor would definitely decrease for the other 13 teams if they had to watch Chicago celebrate a Draft lottery victory in its own city. Besides, isn\u2019t there a 50-year moratorium on Bulls luck after Michael Jordan fell to them at No. 3 in 1984? 2017-18 record: 25-57 No. 1 pick odds:  8.8 percent Argument for Magic: Orlando has never truly recovered from Dwight Howard\u2019s awkward exit in 2012 . Their Draft fortunes haven\u2019t helped this, either. The only time they moved up was in 2013, in what ended up being a weak Draft overall. Since then, they have either stayed pat or dropped down. The results: a jury\u2019s-out core of Aaron Gordon, Mario Hezonja and Jonathan Isaac. With a vacuum of star talent, Orlando could use some Draft lottery magic. Argument against Magic: Orlando did indeed move up in a weak 2013 draft \u2014 and picked a guy they gave up on entirely too soon (Pacers All-Star guard Victor Oladipo). Trading Dario Saric for Elfrid Payton in 2014 was also a flop. Zoom out, and there\u2019s another reason for opponents to roll their eyes at the lottery balls bouncing Orlando\u2019s way: after Shaquille O\u2019Neal and Howard, do the Magic really deserve a third crack at a dominant big man coming out of college?  2017-18 record: 24-58 No. 1 pick odds:  13.7 percent Argument for Hawks: Of all the lottery teams, Atlanta might be the most talent-starved. Point guard Dennis Schroder is the team\u2019s best player, but will continue to be inefficient if he does not get help soon. Forwards Taurean Prince and John Collins are good pieces, but far from franchise saviors. The last time Atlanta earned the No. 1 pick was in 1975 and the player they took \u2014 future Hall of Famer David Thompson \u2014 was worth it. The timing, however, was not. Thompson elected to go to the ABA, and his team in that league (Denver) was one of just four to survive the ABA-NBA merger in 1976 . He never played for Atlanta, spending six of his eight NBA seasons with the Nuggets (and the other two with the Seattle SuperSonics). Some recompense for that misfortune should be forthcoming for the Hawks, right? Argument against Hawks: It\u2019s hard to find a reason to root against Atlanta. They haven\u2019t won a championship since 1958, when they were located in St. Louis . They\u2019ve made one conference finals since 1970 and their most successful era of late \u2014 highlighted by a 60-win season in 2014-15 \u2014 seemed to end in the blink of an eye. Maybe the hold of demons past is just too strong. Atlanta traded the draft rights to Bill Russell in 1956. They traded franchise icon Dominique Wilkins at midseason in 1994 for Manning \u2014 who bolted for the Phoenix Suns in free agency months later. They traded Pau Gasol for Shareef Abdur-Rahim on Draft night 2001 . They took Marvin Williams at No. 2 over future All-Stars Deron Williams and Chris Paul in 2005 \u2026 then selected Shelden Williams over future All-Star Brandon Roy in 2006 . That\u2019s a lot of bad juju to shake off.  2017-18 record: 24-58 No. 1 pick odds:  13.8 percent Argument for Mavs: There was a time when Dallas being in the lottery was a sure thing. Owner Mark Cuban changed all that, to the point where it is still startling to see them represented. Since purchasing a majority stake in the team, the Mavericks\u2019 highest pick was ninth \u2013 which came in 2017 when they selected Dennis Smith Jr. The basketball gods should smile on such competitive longevity. That and the fact that Dallas has jumped into the top three picks just once during the 34-year-old lottery era. Argument against Mavs: Isn\u2019t there some unwritten law about earning the No. 1 pick in the same decade a team wins the championship? No? Fine, what about this: do we really want some hot-shot top pick stealing attention from what could potentially be Dirk Nowitzki\u2019s final NBA season? Seems a little off, doesn\u2019t it?  2017-18 record: 22-60 No. 1 pick odds:  19.9 percent Argument for Grizzlies: In its 23 years of existence, the Grizzlies\u2019 franchise has been a lottery team 13 times. They have never won the top overall pick. The time they almost did was in 2003, when Memphis\u2019 pick was top-1 protected thanks to the Otis Thorpe trade of 1997. They had the sixth-worst record, but when their envelope didn\u2019t show up at No. 6, they knew they had a one-in-three shot of keeping the pick \u2014 and drafting LeBron James. Instead, they jumped only to No. 2, a selection Detroit happily inherited while leaving Memphis high and dry. Isn\u2019t it time, finally, for the lottery to give the Grizzlies a big bear hug? Argument against Grizzlies: Despite not having the No. 1 pick, Memphis has had \u2014 and blown \u2014 multiple chances at making their own Draft luck. Instead, it has played a major role in their repeated undoing. Now that Memphis is back in that high pick territory, how much will the lottery gods trust them?  2017-18 record: 21-61 No. 1 pick odds:  25.0 percent Argument for Suns: All that we said about the Grizzlies? Now double it. The Suns just logged their 50th season, yet somehow have never earned an NBA championship or the No. 1 pick \u2014 the oldest team in the league to own such distinctions. The bad luck behind that stat is a monolith of pain. It started in the franchise\u2019s second offseason, when a coin flip would determine whether the Suns or Milwaukee Bucks would get the top overall pick \u2014 and a chance to Draft a guy named Lew Alcindor (later Kareem Abdul-Jabbar). The Suns picked heads. The coin showed tails and Phoenix wound up with Neal Walk. Fast forward to 1987. Again, it was down to just Phoenix and one other team: the San Antonio Spurs. The unquestioned top pick of that year\u2019s draft was a Navy guy named David Robinson. The Suns\u2019 logo showed up on the second-to-last envelope, and they drafted Armen Gilliam instead. As recently as last year, Phoenix had the second-best odds of landing the No. 1 pick. Instead, the Lakers and 76ers leap-frogged them, dropping the Suns to fourth. In terms of being due blindingly good luck, Phoenix probably has the most historic case in the league. Argument against Suns: It happened with Connie Hawkins in the 1970s. It occurred Charles Barkley in the \u201990s. And it happened when Nash was dealt in 2012: Whenever Phoenix has dealt its star player to a rival, the team is punished with a tumultuous transition. Maybe the lottery gods are still offended at seeing Nash in Laker purple and gold. Maybe they\u2019ll point to 21-year-old Devin Booker and say, \u201cYou know what? You\u2019re good.\u201d Maybe Phoenix just isn\u2019t allowed to have nice things. We\u2019ll find out on Tuesday night."},{"id":40504,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-milwaukee-bucks-toronto-raptors-intensify-pursuit-mike-budenholzer","date":"2018-05-14","title":"Report: Milwaukee Bucks, Toronto Raptors intensify pursuit of Mike Budenholzer","content":" The Milwaukee Bucks and Toronto Raptors took decidedly different paths in 2017-18, yet both sit today with a coaching job vacancy. With both teams looking to take the next step in their respective development, they are both chasing hard after a former Coach of the Year winner. ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski reports the Bucks and Raptors have amped up their wooing process of Mike Budenholzer, who was named NBA Coach of the Year in 2015. Budenholzer coached the Atlanta Hawks from 2013-18, going 213-197 and led the Hawks to their first-ever 60-win season in \u201914-15. He and Atlanta parted ways shortly after the 2017-18 season ended. . Here\u2019s more from Wojnarowski on the Bucks and Raptors\u2019 pursuit of Budenholzer : The Raptors fired highly successful coach Dwane Casey last week after the team was swept in the Eastern Conference semifinals by the Cleveland Cavaliers. He posted a 320-238 (.573) record in his seven years as coach of the Raptors, winning a team-record 59 games this season and four Atlantic Division titles overall. However, he and the Raptors could never reach The Finals and had their season once gain ended in the playoffs by the Cavs. Joe Prunty held the Bucks\u2019 coaching job \u2014 albeit on an interim basis \u2014 for most of last season after taking over once coach Jason Kidd was fired on Jan. 22 . Prunty went 21-16 and led the Bucks to the playoffs, where they fell to the Boston Celtics in Game 7 of the first round . Per reports, the Bucks were set to interview San Antonio Spurs assistant coach Becky Hammon and former Cavs coach David Blatt for their vacancy as well.

The Supreme Court ruled 6-3 to strike down the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act. The 1992 law barred state-authorized sports gambling with some exceptions. It made Nevada the only state where a person could wager on the results of a single game. One research firm estimated before the ruling that if the Supreme Court were to strike down the law, 32 states would likely offer sports betting within five years. \u201cThe legalization of sports gambling requires an important policy choice, but the choice is not ours to make. Congress can regulate sports gambling directly, but if it elects not to do so, each state is free to act on its own. Our job is to interpret the law Congress has enacted and decide whether it is consistent with the Constitution. PASPA is not,\u201d Justice Samuel Alito wrote for the court. The court\u2019s decision came in a case from New Jersey, which has fought for years to legalize gambling on sports at casinos and racetracks in the state. \u201cToday\u2019s decision by the Supreme Court opens the door for states to pass laws legalizing sports betting,\u201d NBA Commissioner Adam Silvers said in a statement. \u201cWe remain in favor of a federal framework that would provide a uniform approach to sports gambling in states that choose to permit it, but we will remain active in ongoing discussions with state legislatures. Regardless of the particulars of any future sports betting law, the integrity of our game remains our highest priority.\u201d More than a dozen states had supported New Jersey, which argued that Congress exceeded its authority when it passed the 1992 Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act, barring states from authorizing sports betting. New Jersey said the Constitution allows Congress to pass laws barring wagering on sports, but Congress can\u2019t require states to keep sports gambling prohibitions in place. All four major U.S. professional sports leagues, the NCAA and the federal government had urged the court to uphold the federal law. In court, the NBA, NFL, NHL and Major League Baseball had argued that New Jersey\u2019s gambling expansion would hurt the integrity of their games. Outside court, however, leaders of all but the NFL have shown varying degrees of openness to legalized sports gambling. The American Gaming Association estimates that Americans illegally wager about $150 billion on sports each year. The 1992 law at issue in the case bars state-authorized sports gambling with exceptions for Nevada, Montana, Oregon and Delaware, states that had approved some form of sports wagering before the law took effect. Nevada is the only state where a person can wager on the results of a single game, though the law doesn\u2019t cover wagering between friends. The law also doesn\u2019t cover animal races, such as horse racing, which many states already allow. New Jersey has spent years and millions of dollars in legal fees trying to legalize sports betting at its casinos, racetracks and former racetracks. In 2012, with voters\u2019 support, New Jersey lawmakers passed a law allowing sports betting, directly challenging the 1992 federal law which says states can\u2019t \u201cauthorize by law\u201d sports gambling. The four major professional sports leagues and the NCAA sued, and the state lost in court. In 2014, New Jersey tried a different tactic by repealing laws prohibiting sports gambling at casinos and racetracks. It argued taking its laws off the books was different from authorizing sports gambling. The state lost again and then took the case to the Supreme Court. Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":40518,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/boston-celtics-offensive-execution-exposes-cleveland-cavaliers-defense","date":"2018-05-14","title":"Boston Celtics' efficiency dismantles Cleveland Cavaliers' defense","content":"BOSTON \u2014 Much is said about how playoff basketball is different from the regular season. The intensity is higher, the play is more physical, the pace is slower, the Toronto Raptors lose their mojo and LeBron James takes it to another level. The playoffs are also different in that there\u2019s more time to prepare and only one opponent to focus on. That\u2019s a big reason why the Boston Celtics have been a better offensive team in the playoffs than they were in the regular season and why they took a 1-0 lead in the Eastern Conference finals with a 108-83 victory against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Sunday. Through the conference semifinals, the Celtics had, as expected, the least efficient offense of the four teams still playing. But they were the only one of the four teams who had scored more points per 100 possessions (107) than they did in the regular season (105). And they\u2019d done it without Kyrie Irving (he averaged almost 10 more points per game than any of his teammates) and with a series against the league\u2019s third-ranked defense (that of the Philadelphia 76ers) in the Eastern Conference semifinals. Even without Irving and Gordon Hayward, the Celtics have a lot of talent. But to have that talent scoring more efficiently than they did with a healthy Irving is a tribute to their ability to execute and make the most of whatever advantages they have over their opponent. The Celtics scored just 103 points per 100 possessions, a rate which would have ranked 25th in the league, in their 22 regular season games (and just 99 in 11 games vs. playoff teams) without Irving. But it\u2019s now been two months since Irving last played . They\u2019ve figured out who they are without their offensive star. \u201cThrough the regular season, there was so much change with our group,\u201d Celtics center Al Horford said, \u201cguys in and out of the lineup, different injuries, a lot of things like that. Once we\u2019ve been able to settle down and find what fits this group, I feel like that\u2019s what prompted us to be better offensively.\u201d What fits is balance and ball movement. Nobody dominates the offense. Six of the top seven guys in the Celtics\u2019 rotation have a postseason *usage rate between 19.7 and 24.3 percent, none of the six in the top 25 of the postseason (among 123 players that have played at least 100 minutes). In Game 1 on Sunday, those six guys all had between 10 and 16 field goal attempts, with four of Boston\u2019s starters scoring between 16 and 23 points. * Usage rate = The percentage of his team\u2019s possessions a player uses (via shots, turnovers and trips to the free throw line) while he\u2019s on the floor. Sometimes the Celtics will have an advantage when they cross the midcourt line. In the conference semifinals , the Celtics attacked J.J. Redick and Marco Belinelli early and often. Jaylen Brown scored just six seconds into Game 1 with a hesitation move that got him past Kyle Korver. If an obvious advantage isn\u2019t there right away, the Celtics seem to always know who\u2019s on the floor and where the advantages will be. And the ball moves until an opportunity presents itself. Horford, seemingly one step ahead of the Sixers for the entire conference semifinals is the fulcrum. Against Philly, the Celtics posted him against smaller defenders and spaced him out on the perimeter against Joel Embiid. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to give credit to Coach [Brad Stevens],\u201d Horford said, \u201cbecause he ends up making adjustments and being able to key in in the playoffs, whichever the matchup is, and giving us those options to go out there and execute on offense.\u201d Three minutes into Game 1, Marcus Morris tied the score with a three-point play, posting up George Hill after a switch. It was the start of a 25-2 run for Boston, as well as a sign of things to come. There was certainly some luck in the Cavs shooting just 4-for-26 from 3-point range on Sunday, but the points in the paint \u2013 60-38 in favor of Boston \u2013 were a more telling statistic, as well as a reminder that as bad as the Celtics\u2019 offense was without Irving this season, the Cavs\u2019 defense was worse. Boston built a 29-9 lead because it simply got better shots, exposing a defense that\u2019s prone to being exposed. Cavs coach Tyronn Lue admitted that his team let down its guard on defense. \u201cBut I thought they did a good job of attacking mismatches, attacking us inside,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you pay attention and take care of details,\u201d Celtics guard Terry Rozier said, \u201cthings like this happen.\u201d The Cavs have one giant matchup advantage, the best player in the world vs. whoever is in his way. Going forward, that advantage will surely play a bigger role than it did in Game 1, when LeBron James was held to just 15 points on 5-for-16 shooting . But the Celtics have advantages everywhere else, with the collective patience and intelligence to take advantage of them. \u201cHaving the poise to say \u2018They\u2019re going to make some runs, they\u2019re going to make some plays, just focus on the next one\u2019 is going to be important the rest of the way,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cBeing able to respond to the next run is really important.\u201d James and the Cavs have 48 hours to figure out how to play better in Game 2. So do Stevens and the Celtics. John Schuhmann is a staff writer for NBA.com. You can e-mail him  here , find  his archive here  and  follow him on Twitter .

It\u2019s another thing for him to have said it at all. Yes, the order of those sentences might seem reversed from what you\u2019d normally expect. And yet Morris \u2014 a no-nonsense, 6-foot-9, seventh-year forward for the Celtics \u2014 might have contributed as much to Boston\u2019s 108-83 victory by what he said Saturday as by what he actually did Sunday in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals at TD Garden. Morris was terrific as the point of the Celtics\u2019 defensive spear against James, Pest No. 1 for a defensive unit that bothered the Cleveland Cavaliers\u2019 superstar into one of his poorest playoff performances in recent memory. Having led the Cavs in scoring in each of their first 11 postseason games this spring, and reaching at least 20 points in each, James managed neither: He finished with 15 points on 5-of-16 shooting (0-of-5 on threes), second for a change to Kevin Love\u2019s 17 points. He had seven rebounds and nine assists, but James also was responsible for seven turnovers. When James was guarded by Morris on 24 plays, he scored only five points on 2-of-6 shooting. And he was a minus-32 in a game his team lost by 25. Morris capped that performance in his first playoff start for the Celtics by posting a better stats line than the Cavs\u2019 and arguably the NBA\u2019s MVP. In 34 minutes, the native of Philadelphia nicknamed \u201cMook\u201d scored 21 points on 7-of-12 shooting, hit three of his four 3-point attempts and grabbed 10 rebounds. He navigated early foul trouble, too, sticking around even after he picked up two personals in the first quarter and a third in the second. And still, for all that in-game, on-the-parquet production, Morris\u2019 most notable move might have come the day before. That\u2019s when he talked about meeting the challenge of guarding James \u2014 solo, in tandem or as part of a mob \u2013 and didn\u2019t blink. Other Celtics were watching and listening, after all. Young teammates. Guys for whom the idea of facing the great LeBron James \u2014 in his eighth consecutive conference finals, within sniffing distance of his eighth straight Finals appearance \u2014 might be a wee daunting. But there was Morris (gasp!) talking about the matchup and brimming with confidence. \u201cPersonally, I think I\u2019m probably the best guy defending him in the league, outside of Kawhi [Leonard of the Spurs],\u201d Morris said. He didn\u2019t stop there. He talked about drawing James as his primary cover two years ago, when he was with Detroit and the Cavaliers swept the Pistons out of the 2016 first round . Morris acknowledged that he and any other Boston player who had to stare into the heart of darkness fending off James would have help and reinforcements. He spoke rather dismissively about Toronto and the dismal way the Raptors handled the guy, as if they were buckling under a steamer trunk\u2019s worth of pressure and intimidation. Nope, not him, Morris said. \u201cI\u2019ve never really been at a point where anybody\u2019s ever broken me with shots or anything like that,\u201d Morris had said, dropping in a couple expletives. \u201cI think he\u2019s probably broken Toronto, if that\u2019s what you were referring to. \u2026 It looked very easy. He looked very confident. Obviously, he\u2019s always confident, but the things that he did, it looked too easy to me.\u201d Right there, way out in Waltham, Mass., at the Celtics practice facility a day early and with Cleveland maybe not even in town yet, Morris helped the Celtics toward their Game 1 victory. He looked directly at the elephant in the room, its tusks flashing in full stomp mode, and essentially said, \u201cI\u2019ve got this.\u201d That\u2019s no routine strategy against James. As is the case with the toughest opponents across all sports, the conventional wisdom always is: Don\u2019t poke the bear or, to keep our metaphors aligned, the elephant. OG Anunoby, the lanky young guy charged with guarding James for Toronto, might not have said a word before the four-game sweep was over. The Indiana Pacers\u2019 Lance Stephenson? Please. It\u2019s to Stephenson\u2019s credit that he doesn\u2019t seem to get intimidated playing against James, but James pushes back on him and the Pacers with a permanent smirk on his face. It\u2019s a big brother-little brother dynamic all the way. This, on the other hand, was tough talk from an adult with the brass to back it up. Teammates who may have had their doubts knew instantly who to follow. \u201cMarcus is one of our leaders and he\u2019s been a presence since the first day he got here,\u201d veteran Al Horford said. \u201cSo, I think taking on this challenge is something we expect out of him. \u201cLike he said, we\u2019re doing it as a unit. It\u2019s not all on him. But you do have to give him credit for his focus and his commitment.\u201d Said second-year forward Jaylen Brown: \u201cOh, he was fantastic.\u201d The only one hedging was done by Celtics coach Brad Stevens. He sounded at times after the Game 1 beatdown as if he wanted to apologize to the Cavs and hide it somewhere. He knows that a bloodied LeBron is a dangerous LeBron, and ditto for the other Cleveland players who have played at this level and beyond.  Stevens\u2019 first response when asked about Morris\u2019 1-on-1 defensive performance was to credit the group, the secondary helpers who took away James\u2019 driving and passing lanes. His second response was to ignore Morris\u2019 chatter that helped set such a tone for his team and focus on the errors and failings that might bite in Game 2. \u201cI don\u2019t pay attention to any of that stuff,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cWe\u2019re very alert to the fact that we\u2019ll get a heavyweight punch on Tuesday night.\u201d James \u2014 whose resume just about guarantees that type of bounce-back \u2014 wasn\u2019t flustered at all afterward. He lavished no particular praise on Morris other than being \u201cthe start\u201d of a Celtics\u2019 defensive scheme successful in \u201cmaking us uncomfortable, making myself off balance and not have a rhythm all game.\u201d As James sees it, there is no way the Cavaliers miss 22 of 26 3-point shots (and start 0-of-14) again. No way coach Tyronn Lue and his staff draw up another plan that enables Boston to score 60 points in the paint. No way, either, that any one opponent \u2013 including Morris \u2013 crafts a reputation as a \u201cLeBron stopper.\u201d There hasn\u2019t been one yet, after all these years, all these exposures, all the scouting and video breakdowns and willing candidates. If there\u2019s one now, in this series, it will grab headlines. \u201cI have zero level of concern at this stage,\u201d James said. \u201cI didn\u2019t go to college, so it\u2019s not [single-elimination] March Madness. You get better throughout the series. \u201cI\u2019ve been down before in the postseason. But for me, there\u2019s never no level of concerns, no matter how bad I played [or] how inefficient I was.\u201d So, Morris isn\u2019t the only one talking tough and brimming with confidence. It\u2019s up to the other Cavaliers to decide how much that imbues them, and with what. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

The Steve Kerr-led Golden State Warriors are indeed living well. Except, the lone hiccup could be on the horizon. The Houston Rockets perhaps have the best chance to do what others couldn\u2019t: prevent the Warriors from playing into June. They loom as the greatest conference threat to the Warriors\u2019 dynasty, a status that was anointed last summer when they grabbed Chris Paul, who blended well with resident ball-hawk James Harden, and that status remained unchanged since opening night when they beat the Warriors . This isn\u2019t the official NBA Finals, as much as the hype would like you to believe. But it is the People\u2019s Playoff Series because there\u2019s just so much to see. The chance of witnessing fun basketball is very high, along with a series that could go the limit. But what\u2019s really snatching everyone\u2019s imagination and attention is the fair chance that the Warriors could \u2026 lose. Yes, the team that\u2019s carving out a place among the best in the last two decades is about to be engaged in a stare-down, and as Kerr admitted, the Warriors are \u201cdefinitely threatened\u201d by what the Rockers are packing. That said, the Warriors are 36-8 in the West the last three postseasons and only once faced elimination, so they do have that going for them (along with Draymond Green, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson). Here\u2019s how we rank the five most formidable West series\/opponents for the Warriors in the Kerr era, four of whom could not pull off the series win. Will the fifth follow suit? The reasons Houston rates No. 1 on this list is fairly obvious, in case you\u2019re just now tuning into the NBA season. They\u2019re the only top-seed to see the Warriors in this run. Harden, Paul and Clint Capela are 50-5 together in the lineup. Collectively, the Rockets they bring the offensive punch that\u2019s equal to or a shade better than the Warriors. And, lastly, Houston has home-court advantage and, of course, they were exclusively built for this. Basically, they\u2019re spooky. The Rockets can cause a handful of potential matchup problems and the mad professor\/coach Mike D\u2019Antoni can sample three or four lineups designed to locate a Golden State weakness or vulnerable spot. The Rockets can run the floor, go half-court with pick-and-rolls and yes, you might have heard they can shoot 3-pointers. Virtually anyone who suits up with the exception of Capela can drill from deep, although some better than others. And thanks to assistant coach Jeff Bzdelik, the Rockets\u2019 defense is better than ever \u2014 although not quite at the Warriors\u2019 level when the defending champs are locked in. The Warriors can\u2019t afford too many bad lapses because the Rockets can make you pay for your mistakes. And for the first time, the Warriors will start on the road to begin a West playoff series. Amazing when you consider how much of the Warriors\u2019 legacy was riding on this series, in retrospect. If Oklahoma City doesn\u2019t blow a 3-1 lead , maybe Durant stays and the shift in power strays from Golden State and the Durant-Russell Westbrook Thunder are the new bullies on the block. But the Thunder did blow that 3-1 lead and here we are, with the Warriors making history while Westbrook is muttering to himself on his own private island. The series came down to a pair of pivotal Game 6 moments : Klay Thompson going scorched earth at Oklahoma City while Durant and Westbrook brain-lock their way around the floor. After Thompson dropped a blistering 41 points in his greatest game ever, KD and Westbrook combined to shoot 20-for-58. Throw in three Westbrook turnovers in the final 55 seconds and OKC was totally numb getting on its plane to Oakland for Game 7. The Thunder weren\u2019t mentally prepared for that flight or that game. The one argument against putting OKC here at No. 2 is that it was the No. 3 seed and the Warriors swept the Thunder in the 2015-16 season series. But LaMarcus Aldridge disappeared after scoring 79 points in the first two games in the Thunder-Spurs West semifinals. Consider, too, that the Spurs perhaps would\u2019ve been too clever to blow a 3-1 edge had they been in the same spot. Since losing three games in that conference final against the Warriors, Durant has yet to suffer three playoff losses total with the Warriors. The Grizzlies in their \u201cGrit-and-Grind\u201d prime were once a headache for the Warriors because they slowed the game and pushed them around. Golden State averaged barely more than 100 points in this six-game series and the Grizzlies held a 2-1 lead at one point, becoming only the second team to gain a lead on the Warriors in a playoff series since the fun began in Oakland. The signature play of the series was Curry\u2019s three-quarters-court heave that beat the third-quarter buzzer and shell-shocked Memphis in Game 6, the series-clincher. Before that, the Warriors bore the welts from too much Marc Gasol and Zach Randolph. Fortunately for Golden State, Tony Allen suffered a hamstring injury, sparing the Warriors additional lumps (although the Warriors did expose Allen by letting him shoot as the series wore on). Golden State next played the Rockets in the 2015 West finals , but this was the Harden-Dwight Howard squad that was already showing signs of self-disintegration. The Rockets didn\u2019t put up a fight, losing in five games, and Harden was so miserable near the end that he shot two-for-11 in Game 5. So, no, that Rockets team doesn\u2019t rate ahead of Memphis, even though they went further. Wait, a team that was swept gets the top-five treatment? That says plenty about the Warriors \u2014 who have flattened most challengers \u2014 and also about the circumstances regarding the Spurs in that series. Well, actually, there was only one circumstance: Kawhi Leonard\u2019s third-quarter Game 1 ankle roll that knocked him out of the series. Historians will always remind you the Spurs were cruising at the time, leading by as much as 25 points and shoving the Warriors into an unfamiliar corner. Yes, it was just one game, yet the Spurs had Leonard, who was in the midst of an MVP-type season. And the Spurs also had sagely vets Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili and legendary coach Gregg Popovich, too. But everything flipped when Leonard fell. The Warriors rallied to win that game by two points and Aldridge couldn\u2019t carry San Antonio\u2019s load the rest of the series. His solo act failed spectacularly as the Spurs were done for by Game 4. What a difference a year makes. In May of 2017, New Orleans was sitting at home and wondering if its big man experiment with Anthony Davis and DeMarcus Cousins would work. Fast-forward a year and the Pelicans entered this series without Cousins (Achilles) \u2026 but with a recharged Rajon Rondo and Jrue Holiday, a renewed Nikola Mirotic and a new style of play sans \u201cBoogie.\u201d After sweeping the Portland Trail Blazers in the first round , the Pelicans \u2014 if nothing else \u2014 presented an intriguing threat for the Warriors. Golden State had to game plan for a superstar in Davis while not neglecting his help \u2014 especially Rondo and Holiday, who had torched Portland\u2019s guards. The Warriors finally figured out the Pelicans in five games , although most of them had nervous fourth quarters. Perhaps Golden State\u2019s motivation to keep the series as short as possible had something to do with the team waiting on deck. Next up? That No. 1 threat. * * * Veteran NBA writer Shaun Powell has worked for newspapers and other publications for more than 25 years.

Cleveland\u2019s starting guard was excused from practice on Saturday to receive his degree from IUPUI. As his Cavaliers teammates got in one last workout before heading to Boston for Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals, Hill took part in graduation ceremonies at the school in Indianapolis. The 32-year-old Hill received his degree from the School of Liberal Arts. He was one of two student speakers to address the new graduates. Hill played for the Jaguars from 2004-08. Cavs coach Tyronn Lue said Hill would rejoin the team in time for the series opener Sunday against the Celtics. Hill joined the Cavs in February, coming over in a trade from Sacramento. He was slowed by back spasms and missed three games in the first round of the playoffs against Indiana, but returned and played a key role in the Cavs\u2019 Game 7 win as well as Cleveland\u2019s four-game sweep of Toronto. Hill, who also played in the postseason for San Antonio and Indiana, has helped settle a troubling position for the Cavs. Cleveland traded All-Star guard Kyrie Irving last summer to Boston and have used numerous point guards this season. The Cavs struggled without him against the Pacers, but Hill returned for the series finale. Although he was on a minutes\u2019 restriction, he scored 11 points \u2013 all in the second half \u2013 and helped Cleveland advance. \u201dHe\u2019s been great,\u201d Lue said. \u201dJust coming into Game 7 versus Indiana where he hadn\u2019t played in 3 plus games, to come out and play the half of basketball that he played, he was tremendous. So, just his experience of being in the playoffs, being in the Eastern Conference finals when he played for Indiana, playing against the Miami teams, he knows what it\u2019s about. So, it\u2019s great having a veteran like that on the team.\u201d"},{"id":46849,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/charlotte-hornets-no-wholesale-changes-coming","date":"2018-05-12","title":"Charlotte Hornets have new coach, but not expecting wholesale changes to roster","content":" The Charlotte Hornets introduced James Borrego as their new head coach Friday ; it\u2019s the first official job for Borrego, who did serve as an interim coach in Orlando four years ago.

But the other newsy tidbit from the Borrego introduction was from new GM Mitch Kupchak, who said not to expect wholesale changes, at least at the moment anyway, to the Hornets\u2019 roster before next season. That comes as somewhat of a surprise, given the disappointing season and failure to make the playoffs and the current salary cap situation. The Hornets are paying eight figures to six players, Dwight Howard and Nic Batum are making in excess of $20 million a season, the club was No. 12 on the team salary list and are committed to paying at least $118 million next season which would be a marginal increase.

He was too busy trying to figure out how to avoid being buried under it. \u201dYou realize that if you\u2019re going to break records here, you\u2019re probably going to break bad ones,\u201d he recently said. \u201dBecause none of the good ones are reachable.\u201d While achieving Red Auerbach status may not be on Stevens\u2019 radar, in just his fifth season there\u2019s no question the 41-year-old is also beyond being the wide-eyed former Butler University coach who arrived in Boston. In a timeframe that has often already swallowed up most first-time NBA coaches, he\u2019s managed to endear himself to a championship-driven city by helping Boston make an improbable run back to the Eastern Conference finals. The Celtics seemingly had their championship hopes derailed following the season-ending injuries to both of their offseason additions in Gordon Hayward and Kyrie Irving. Yet, Boston won 55 games during the regular season and increased its win total for the fifth consecutive season under Stevens. Despite having a roster that was down to just 11 healthy players by the end of their second-round win over Philadelphia , the Celtics enter their conference finals rematch with Cleveland on Sunday with an 8-0 record at home this postseason. They are also the first team in NBA history to make it back to this point without their leading scorer from the regular season (Irving). Most of the NBA community was taken aback after Stevens failed to receive a single vote from his peers when the National Basketball Coaches Association gave out its coach of the year award . The honor went to Toronto\u2019s Dwane Casey, who was fired Friday after his team was swept in the East semifinals by the Cleveland Cavaliers . Stevens has always downplayed the attention placed on coaching awards. He said that he thought Casey deserved the honor and didn\u2019t expect him to be without a job for long. Boston\u2019s successes this season aside, Stevens said comfort remains a commodity this profession. \u201dI don\u2019t think that I would ever define anybody in the coaching or playing shoes probably as comfortable,\u201d he said. \u201dYou\u2019re just focused on what\u2019s next. But it is basketball. There\u2019s only so much you can do.\u201d But it\u2019s also clear that one of the reasons that Casey lost his job was the Raptors\u2019 inability to challenge the Cavs in the postseason. Toronto was also swept out of the playoffs by Cleveland last season. Most of the credit for Boston\u2019s run thus far surely belongs to veteran Al Horford and the Celtics\u2019 corps of young players, including Terry Rozier, Jaylen Brown and rookie Jayson Tatum. Stevens agrees with that assessment and has remained true to his style by blending into the background in public, instead waiting for the huddle or practice to make his voice heard. He believes his team\u2019s mental toughness and grit have carried it more than anything he\u2019s done. Horford said Stevens hasn\u2019t shied away from putting their young players in pressure situations. \u201dI think a lot of our guys have been thrown into the fire. I think it\u2019s been designed that way so guys can just develop and learn as they go,\u201d Horford said. \u201dBut I think that one of the things that helps them is the way that coach helps them prepare and the way that he teaches them the game.\u201d There is also at least one person watching from afar who thinks a lot of the credit belongs to Stevens. And it just happens to be the same player he will spend the next few weeks trying to stop: LeBron James. From Stevens\u2019 ability to draw up plays out of timeouts, to his management of late-clock situations, to getting the best out of his roster, James has long been a fan. \u201dI think they are one of the most well-coached teams in our league,\u201d James said. \u201dNo matter who has played for them, he can put guys in position to succeed and get the most out of whoever has been in their lineup over the past few years. It\u2019s not just this year.\u201d Stevens said he\u2019s focused on living in the moment. \u201dFrom our standpoint, I feel like it\u2019s been a lot of fun,\u201d he said. \u201dWe talked about it prior to the playoffs; nobody should love a challenge more, nobody should have more fun doing it. I think our guys have done a good job with that.\u201d And though he may never say it, so has their coach. \u2014 AP Sports Writer Tom Withers in Independence, Ohio contributed to this report."}]
