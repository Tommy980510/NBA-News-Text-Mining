At his basketball camp in Charlotte today, the Hornets star said he\u2019d be open to taking less than the supermax this summer. He told reporters at the camp, which was held at Ardrey Kell High School in south Charlotte, that his willingness to do so was to help the Hornets build a better team around him going forward. Because Walker was named to an All-NBA team this season, the Hornets can offer him a five-year \u201csupermax\u201d contract worth up to $221 million \u2013 significantly more than the five-year, $190 million deal had he not been named All-NBA. Other NBA teams can only offer a four-year deal worth $140 million when free agency begins June 30. \u201cYeah, why not? Yeah I would be. I would take less, yeah,\u201d Walker said when asked if he\u2019d take less than the supermax to help the Hornets build around him. The 29-year-old Walker said he\u2019s eager to hear what other teams have to offer. \u201cThat all factors in (to my decision) when I sit down with the teams and hear what guys have to say,\u201d Walker said. \u201cI think that will all come into play. I\u2019m not really sure right now. Like I said Charlotte is my first priority and I have to see what (the Hornets) have to offer, as well as other teams.\u201d There has been plenty of speculation about where Walker might end up, including with the New York Knicks because he grew up in the Bronx. But Walker has repeatedly said he loves playing and living in Charlotte. \u201cI have been here for eight years, and it\u2019s the team that drafted me,\u201d Walker said. \u201cSo yeah it is my first priority. I don\u2019t know if I will sign back with them, but they are my first priority.\u201d Walker said he doesn\u2019t have a timetable for signing a contract but added he wouldn\u2019t mind getting it done as soon as possible. Asked if he was confident he\u2019d re-sign with Charlotte, Walker shrugged his shoulders and said, \u201cI have no clue. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Walker added. \u201cThis is where I want to be and if it doesn\u2019t work out, it just doesn\u2019t. I\u2019m prepared.\u201d Walker qualified for the supermax extension from the Hornets after making the third-team All-NBA this season, which could pay him more than $220 million over five years. He averaged a career-high 25.6 points and 5.9 assists for the Hornets this season while earning his third straight All-Star selection. Over the last four seasons, he has averaged more than 20 points per game and is averaging 19.8 points per game for his career since joining the league in 2011 out of UConn, where he won a national championship with the Huskies. Walker hasn\u2019t experienced that same team success at the NBA level. The Hornets have made the playoffs only twice during Walker\u2019s career and have never made it out of the first round \u2013 a major disappointment for the highly competitive Walker. So the prospect of playing for a team that is closing to competing for a NBA championship could lure Walker away from Charlotte. Walker said right now he is just trying to enjoy the experience, regardless of how stressful it might be. \u201cIt\u2019s my first time being a free agent and having the opportunity to be in the driver\u2019s seat and have the opportunity to make a decision and play for different teams, and that is exciting in itself,\u201d Walker said. \u201cAnd when teams have interest in you I think that is pretty cool.\u201d Veteran forward Marvin Williams reportedly exercised his option for next season, in which he will earn $15 million. Swingman Michael Kidd-Gilchrist has a $13 million player option for next season, but he has not made his decision yet (and has until June 22 to do so ). The Hornets are also already on the books for Nicolas Batum ($25.56 million), Bismack Biyombo ($17 million) and Cody Zeller ($14.47 million) next season \u2014 although Biyombo and Williams are both in the final years of their respective deals. The Hornets don\u2019t have the money to sign a difference-maker in free agency, which will likely leave GM Mitch Kupchak to acquire talent through a trades. Walker had said in the past he wants to continue playing for the Hornets and \u201ccreate something special here\u201d because he loves living in Charlotte. But the 6-foot-1 point guard appeared to slightly back off those statements as the 2018-19 season ended, saying repeatedly \u201cI want to win.\u201d Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":33198,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/raptors-warriors-steph-klay-game-6-preview","date":"2019-06-13","title":"Can Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson carry load in Game 6?","content":" * Tonight on ABC:   Game 6, Raptors vs. Warriors (9 ET) OAKLAND, Calif. \u2014 The official closing of Oracle Arena and the official haunting end to Kevin Durant\u2019s season normally would be enough to occupy anyone\u2019s deep thoughts in the Bay Area because both, in their own way, defined an era of the Golden State Warriors and became beloved. Meanwhile, there\u2019s another game to be played in The Finals , and another championship to be won. And there\u2019s only one way to extend the former and accomplish the latter: Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson must be at their splashiest, or else. The margin for error in this series for the Warriors is now as thin as their odds of capturing it. They\u2019re playing against a healthier team and a star who knows how to succeed in June. They\u2019ve lost two straight at home to Toronto in the series and are 2-5 overall against the Raptors this season. And aside from Curry and Thompson, who are averaging 57.4 points in The Finals , the Warriors are getting mixed results at best from a number of players who normally would be supportive, but aren\u2019t. So, a pattern has been established and a blueprint has been issued. Curry and Thompson must fight the double teams coming their way, and shoot with efficiency, and save enough energy for defense, and conserve enough wind to rescue the Warriors with big shots should the game be tight down the stretch \u2026 and then do it all over again in a Game 7 (if they\u2019re fortunate to get that far). \u201cThey\u2019ve done that since they\u2019ve been here,\u201d Shaun Livingston said. \u201cThat\u2019s nothing to them.\u201d These are tenuous times for the Warriors, who\u2019ll take a swirl of emotions into Game 6. Occupying a segment of their concentration is Durant, who underwent surgery Wednesday morning in New York for the Achilles he ruptured in Game 5. Durant is spoken about in somber terms within the organization, everyone realizing the sacrifice he made to return to action after a month off, and the risk he took with his body and by extension his future. The issue of basketball never comes up in conversation, meaning the Warriors are far more concerned with Durant\u2019s recovery than what they\u2019re missing with him off the floor. There\u2019s also the controversial angle with Durant and what amount the Warriors were culpable, or not, regarding his injury. Two days after team president Bob Myers fought tears and accepted blame , coach Steve Kerr was the answer man Wednesday and tried to make sense of the entire ordeal. \u201cObviously, everyone feels horrible about what happened,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cKevin checked all the boxes and he was cleared by everyone involved. Now, would we go back and do it all over again? Damn right. But that\u2019s easy to say after the results \u2026 our feeling was the worst thing that could happen was a re-injury of the calf. So the Achilles came as a complete shock.\u201d Durant hasn\u2019t spoken to the media since the injury, and in his limited social media reaction both before and after surgery, he didn\u2019t point fingers. His mother, Wanda Durant, also dodged the issue of blame when she went on \u201cGood Morning America\u201d to discuss her son. Her anger, instead, was directed at critics who initially questioned his injury and fans who cheered his re-injury. Kevin Durant has shown support for his teammates almost immediately after he left the team. The relationship between he and the front office, on the other hand, remains murky, though not for long. That will be revealed \u2014 in a few weeks at the latest \u2014 when Durant reaches free agency on June 30 and determines his future. In the meantime, the fate of the Warriors hinges heavily on their ability to replace what Durant offered. Much of that burden falls on a backcourt that spooked the Raptors late in Game 5 and will be pressed to duplicate (and potentially triplicate) it as The Finals continue. Curry and Thompson have been teammates eight seasons and enjoy prominent mention among the best backcourts ever. Their chemistry together is perhaps unmatched. Their shooting range is historic. Their shared history \u2014 11 combined All-Star teams and three titles \u2014 is rich. And the task facing them is monstrous. Toronto is a solid defensive team, especially around the perimeter, where Curry and Thompson thrive. The Raptors will surely shadow each player around the floor and willingly leave certain reluctant shooters, such as Draymond Green and Andre Iguodala, wide open as if encouraging them to shoot. There\u2019s a reason for this strategy: Green and Iguodala have been awful from the outside in this series (a combined 9-of-35 on 3-pointers , with a majority of those shots uncontested) and haven\u2019t done anything to deserve Toronto\u2019s respect. That means the Raptors will give them none, until and unless they prove worthy of it. When Green and Iguodala shoot, the result is usually a miss, or a forced pass to another teammate, or a rash decision to attack the basket for a layup that is either successful or becomes an offensive foul or turnover. Essentially, there\u2019s more bad than good. Center DeMarcus Cousins has had three decent quarters in The Finals and otherwise is overcome by poor decisions, fouls and turnovers. Livingston isn\u2019t a deep threat, and so he can\u2019t stretch the floor. Kevon Looney is playing through pain. Quinn Cook runs hot and cold and no one else is on the floor long enough to help. This means Curry and Thompson will constantly be run off screens, thrown the ball and asked to be efficient volume shooters. They\u2019ll also have to be clutch shooters, if the game comes down to that. Just because they\u2019ve done all of the above for much of their career, there\u2019s no guarantee they\u2019ll do that over the next game, or two. \u201cI think they rely on their experience,\u201d Livingston said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been doing it for a while. There\u2019s no pressure being down, what, six points, two minutes left? At that point they\u2019ve got 25, 30 points, so they take the shot. You trust them. They know they\u2019re getting the ball. That\u2019s just how we play, how they play.\u201d It has become instinctive at this point for Curry and Thompson, given their knowledge of each other, their high level of comfortability and the trust they share. \u201cWe just kind of go out there and play,\u201d Thompson said. \u201c We \u2018re very in tune with each other being that we\u2019ve played with each other for years. So when we hit the open man \u2014 Steph doesn\u2019t stop moving. Same for me. So it just comes down to having the chemistry we do with the team and just playing that ball movement type of basketball. I know Steph has been doing it for 10 years with this organization, and me eight. So we know what it\u2019s like to take those, and we can live with the make or miss. It\u2019s just what it comes down to.\u201d Curry and Thompson shot 27 threes in Game 5 , which was a problem for Toronto. That means a majority of those shots came in rhythm and some uncontested; otherwise, there wouldn\u2019t be as many attempts. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be aware of them at all times,\u201d Raptors guard Kyle Lowry said. \u201cIt ain\u2019t just down the stretch. It\u2019s all game.\u201d None of this would be possible if the Warriors weren\u2019t experts at creating screens and using ball movement to find them. Green and Iguodala are solid at this, whipping the ball around the perimeter until it finds the designated shooter, often wide open. \u201cYou got to guard them, got to find them in transition,\u201d Raptors coach Nick Nurse said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to come up with a solution for that. They\u2019re excellent at pushing off to create space. Their screens are long and wide. So you\u2019ve got to work doubly, triply hard sometimes. There\u2019s a lot of stuff going on and we need to do better.\u201d Oracle Arena will be alive for another day before it dies. The crowd will be a mixture of nostalgic and desperate and sympathetic toward Durant. And this atmosphere will play in the favor of a team that hasn\u2019t been able to solve the Raptors at home. Eventually, though, the ball is tossed and atmosphere can\u2019t decide a game, certainly not a championship. That comes down to Kawhi Leonard and Toronto\u2019s deep shooting and its defense and its ability to stay composed in the moment of truth. For the Warriors? Easy. Curry and Thompson, the \u201cSplash Brothers,\u201d better make it rain. If not, this dynasty is a wash. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

Durant revealed the severity of his injury Wednesday, two days after getting hurt during Game 5 of the NBA Finals in Toronto in his return after being sidelined for a month with a right calf strain. The photo posted on Wednesday shows Durant recovering from surgery in a hospital bed. \u201cMy road back starts now!\u201d Durant wrote in the caption. \u201cI got my family and loved ones by my side and we truly appreciate all the messages and support people have sent our way. \u201cLike I said Monday, I\u2019m hurting deeply, but I\u2019m OK. Basketball is my biggest love and I wanted to be out there that night because that\u2019s what I do. I wanted to help my teammates on our quest for the three peat. \u201cIts just the way things go in this game and I\u2019m proud that I gave it all I physically could, and I\u2019m proud my brothers got the W. It\u2019s going to be a journey but I\u2019m built for this. I\u2019m a hooper I know my brothers can get this Game 6, and I will be cheering with dub nation while they do it.\u201d https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/Byn0c6NjoQq\/ The Warriors also released a statement a few hours later to say the surgery was successful and performed at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York. Warriors coach Steve Kerr said during Wednesday\u2019s media availability that the team had no idea Durant risked a serious Achilles injury by returning from a strained calf. \u201cKevin checked all the boxes,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cHe was cleared to play by everybody involved. Now, would we go back and do it over again? Damn right. But that\u2019s easy to say with the results. \u201cWhen we gathered all the information, our feeling was the worst thing that could happen would be a re-injure of the calf. That was the advice and the information that we had. At that point, once Kevin was cleared to play, he was comfortable with that, we were comfortable with that. So the Achilles came as a complete shock.\u201d Stephen Curry can only imagine how much Durant is hurting emotionally not being able to play \u2013 but second-guessing benefits nobody at this stage, the two-time MVP said. \u201cEverybody has great 20\/20 hindsight,\u201d Curry said, then added: \u201cI trust our medical staff and know Bob Myers has our best interests in terms of not just what we can do in this series, but long term in our overall health. You see how hard he took it, talking to you guys after the game. And that\u2019s really genuine and authentic. So you can waste time talking about the what-ifs and this and that. Injuries are tough and they suck. They\u2019re a part of our game, and they\u2019re going to continue to be a part of our game. But everybody putting their collective brains together to make the sound, smart decisions, you kind of just live with that, because that\u2019s what\u2019s a part of our game.\u201d Durant left in the second quarter of Game 5 of the NBA Finals , a game Golden State went on to win 106-105 to keep its season alive. The Warriors All-Star forward was seen leaving the arena on crutches and in a walking boot. He got hurt on a dribble on the right wing, coming up lame on a crossover move and falling to the floor. He grabbed the back of his leg, appeared to grab below the calf and more toward the Achilles area, and needed help to limp to the bench area and more help to get back to the Warriors\u2019 locker room. Warriors forward Andre Iguodala was on Durant\u2019s left side as they made the long walk back to the room, with Warriors GM Bob Myers and Curry in the group immediately behind them. Players have made comebacks off Achilles surgery, with relative levels of success. DeMarcus Cousins, Kobe Bryant, and Rudy Gay all came back; Cousins hasn\u2019t regained past form yet. Dominique Wilkins had an Achilles tear happen to him at the peak of his career and he arguably was as good as ever afterward. Elton Brand, now leading the Philadelphia 76ers\u2019 front office, had it as a player and said he was never the same. Christian Laettner went from a star to a role player when his Achilles ripped. \u201cI\u2019ve been there,\u201d 15-time golf major winner Tiger Woods said Tuesday at the U.S. Open. \u201cI\u2019ve had it to my own Achilles. I\u2019ve had it to my own back. I know what it feels like. It\u2019s an awful feeling. And no one can help you. That\u2019s the hard part.\u201d Before returning to the floor on Monday night, Durant had been sidelined for more than a month with a strained calf suffered in Game 5 of the Western Conference finals against the Houston Rockets. Durant was cleared by the Warriors\u2019 medical staff after Game 4, and participated in both a practice session Sunday and a shootaround practice earlier Monday . The Warriors had said throughout his month-long absence that they did not want him back on the floor until he was right, for fear of the exact scenario they now face \u2014 Durant being out longer than just a few weeks. He played well in Game 5, scoring 11 points in 12 minutes while making all three of his 3-point attempts. He started and played the first six minutes, then had the lower leg wrapped with a heating pad to keep it loose before he returned about three minutes later. Then, it all came crashing down and the Warriors were left to pick up the pieces and make sense of it all after their latest Finals win. \u201cIt\u2019s a bizarre feeling that we all have right now,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cAn incredible win and a horrible loss at the same time.\u201d \u201cIt sucks. I feel so bad for him, his camp,\u201d Warriors guard Klay Thompson said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to come back stronger though. That\u2019s the kind of fighter he is and I\u2019m going to miss him, man. It\u2019s not the same being out there without him.\u201d Warriors president of basketball operations Bob Myers was openly emotional when he told media members after Game 5 that the injury was to Durant\u2019s right Achilles. Myers said he felt the team had done all it could to ensure the two-time Finals MVP\u2019s safe return to action and offered himself as a target of criticism in light of the injury. \u201cI don\u2019t believe there\u2019s anybody to blame, but I understand this world,\u201d Myers said. \u201cIf you have to, you can blame me. I run our basketball operations department.\u201d This is Durant\u2019s first serious injury since the 2014-15 season with the Oklahoma City Thunder, when a fracture in his right foot ultimately limited him to 27 games. In October of 2014, he suffered a \u201cJones fracture\u201d in his foot and had surgery that sidelined him until December of that year . He played off and on for the next two months before he was shut down for the season to have a third surgery on the fractured bone in his foot. Since joining the Warriors in the summer of 2016, Durant has been mostly healthy. He missed 19 straight games in his first season with Golden State because of a strained MCL in his left knee . He missed two first-round playoff games in 2017 as well because of a strained left calf muscle , but was healthy the rest of the way en route to Finals MVP honors and his first NBA championship . This season, Durant averaged 26 points, 6.4 rebounds, 5.9 assists and 1.1 blocks per game. In the playoffs, he\u2019s averaged 32.3 ppg, 7.7 rpg, 4.5 apg and 1 bpg.

These reports come on the same day that Davis\u2019 agent Rich Paul was featured in a cover story for Sports Illustrated , which became newsworthy when he was quoted saying Davis would not sign an extension with the Celtics, or any team, before free agency in 2020. \u201cWhere he\u2019s going to land? I have no idea,\u201d Paul told Sports Illustrated \u2018s S.L. Price . \u201cAnd it don\u2019t matter. We\u2019re going into free agency. Why does it matter to me where he goes? Earth: We\u2019re going into free agency. He has a year, he has to play. But after that, I can\u2019t say it no bigger: WE ARE GOING INTO FREE AGENCY. 2020: ANTHONY DAVIS WILL BE IN FREE AGENCY. \u201d Paul informed the Pelicans in January that Davis wanted out and had no intention of signing a long-term contract extension with the team. The Pelicans have been aware of what Davis wants, and while many trade rumors regarding him bubbled up leading into the NBA\u2019s trade deadline, he was ultimately not dealt. Paul made it clear in the Sports Illustrated story that even if Boston does acquire Davis, they must be prepared to face the summer of 2020, too. \u201cThey can trade for him, but it\u2019ll be for one year,\u201d Paul says. \u201cI mean: If the Celtics traded for Anthony Davis, we would go there and we would abide by our contractual [obligations] and we would go into free agency in 2020. I\u2019ve stated that to them. But in the event that he decides to walk away and you give away assets? Don\u2019t blame Rich Paul.\u201d David Griffin, the Pelicans\u2019 new executive vice president of basketball operations, met with Davis in Los Angeles at the end of May . While the talks were reportedly \u201crespectful\u201d and \u201cproductive,\u201d it was still considered \u201chighly unlikely\u201d that Davis would waver from his stance in seeking a trade. Since then, Griffin has reportedly become open to multi-team trades for Davis as he has provided potential suitors with the framework of a trade package he\u2019d want for the All-Star.

Golden State Warriors president of basketball operations Bob Myers was openly emotional when he told media members after the game that the injury was to Durant\u2019s right Achilles. ESPN\u2019s Ramona Shelburne and Adrian Wojnarowski report that the team fears Tuesday\u2019s MRI will reveal the injury to be a tear of the Achilles tendon , the same injury that kept DeMarcus Cousins out of action for one year. During media availability on Wednesday, coach Steve Kerr said the Warriors did not have an update to provide on Durant\u2019s injury. \u201cI guess there\u2019s some speculation out there as to what\u2019s going on,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cBut we have no news. As soon as we have some news, any updates, we\u2019ll let you know.\u201d The Athletic\u2019s Shams Charania reported that Durant traveled to New York on Tuesday for doctors to evaluate his injured Achilles. Myers was teary when he gave the news after Game 5 of The Finals on Monday night. While the MRI will reveal exactly the extent of Durant\u2019s injury, his season is clearly over and his recovery will likely take several months if the Achilles is indeed torn. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the most misunderstood people,\u201d Myers said. \u201cHe\u2019s a good teammate, he\u2019s a good person, it\u2019s not fair. I\u2019m lucky to know him. I don\u2019t have all the information on what really the extent of what it all means until we get a MRI, but the people that worked with him and cleared him are good people, they\u2019re good people.\u201d Myers said he felt the team had done all it could to ensure the two-time Finals MVP\u2019s safe return to action and offered himself as a target of criticism in light of the injury. \u201cI don\u2019t believe there\u2019s anybody to blame, but I understand this world,\u201d Myers said. \u201cIf you have to, you can blame me. I run our basketball operations department.\u201d Durant left in the second quarter of Game 5 of the NBA Finals , a game Golden State went on to win against the Toronto Raptors 106-105 . The Warriors All-Star forward was seen leaving the arena on crutches and in a walking boot. He got hurt on a dribble on the right wing , coming up lame on a crossover move and falling to the floor. He grabbed the back of his leg, appeared to grab below the calf and more toward the Achilles area, and needed help to limp to the bench area and more help to get back to the Warriors\u2019 locker room. Warriors forward Andre Iguodala was on Durant\u2019s left side as they made the long walk back to the room, with Myers and Stephen Curry in the group immediately behind them. He shouted an expletive as he left the floor, his frustration obvious. He was supposed to be one of the marquee free agents this summer. He may now end up exercising his $31.5 million option to stay with the Warriors, especially if he\u2019s going to be sidelined for an extended period. Durant\u2019s mother, Wanda, was on Good Morning America on Thursday and shared her thoughts on her son\u2019s injury. She was not at Scotiabank Arena for Game 5 and saw what happened on the telecast of the game. \u201cI was excited because he was doing so well,\u201d Wanda Durant said. \u201cThen, when it happened, I just kind of sunk. I was just glued on him and glued on his eyes to see how he was doing. Still, kind of hurtful to see the anguish in his eyes. He looked as though he felt somewhat dejected at that time. He tried to hobble off and I was thinking, \u2018don\u2019t do that, son.\u2019 \u201cI talked with him about five to 10 minutes afterwards. He just told me not to cry. He worked so hard to get back to play and he just told me he was going to be OK and don\u2019t worry. He had to kind of talk me down a little bit.\u201d Wanda Durant said the hours and days since the injury have been trying for her son. \u201cEmotionally, it\u2019s a little tough for him. Physically, of course, you all saw he went down. He\u2019s having a rough time right now,\u201d she said. \u201cBut with the love our faith and our God and our family, we\u2019re going to be OK.\u201d Durant had been cleared by the Warriors\u2019 medical staff after Game 4, and participated in both a practice session Sunday and a shootaround practice earlier Monday . The Warriors had said throughout his month-long absence that they did not want him back on the floor until he was right, for fear of this exact scenario \u2014 Durant aggravating the injury and having no chance of returning this season. Their nightmare came true. And if it really only was a calf injury initially, this was worse. \u201cIt\u2019s a bizarre feeling that we all have right now,\u201d Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. \u201cAn incredible win and a horrible loss at the same time.\u201d \u201cIt sucks. I feel so bad for him, his camp,\u201d Warriors guard Klay Thompson said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to come back stronger though. That\u2019s the kind of fighter he is and I\u2019m going to miss him, man. It\u2019s not the same being out there without him.\u201d Kerr said before the Game 5 that Durant had \u201cresponded well\u201d to the practices. \u201cHe\u2019s going to play,\u201d Kerr said. And he was playing well, too. Durant had 11 points in 12 minutes , making all three of his 3-point attempts. He started and played the first six minutes, then had the lower leg wrapped with a heating pad to keep it loose before he returned about three minutes later. A number of NBA players reacted on Twitter quickly \u2014 both to the injury, and to the sound of some Toronto fans cheering when Durant got hurt. \u201cWhy are they cheering for his injury? Come on man,\u201d Philadelphia 76ers center Joel Embiid wrote. Added Washington Wizards forward Bobby Portis: \u201cRaptors fans can\u2019t cheer for a player getting hurt. That\u2019s lame.\u201d Many others just sent best wishes, including the Miami Heat\u2019s Olynyk, the Cleveland Cavaliers\u2019 Kevin Love and the Atlanta Hawks\u2019 Trae Young. \u201cI don\u2019t think the fans knew the significance of the injury,\u201d Raptors guard Kyle Lowry said after Game 5. The Warriors entered the night trailing the Raptors 3-1 in the title series \u2014 meaning their hopes of a third consecutive NBA championship were squarely on the brink. Durant had not played since straining a calf muscle in Game 5 of the Western Conference semifinals against Houston, and the team hoped his presence would be a boost. \u201cThe skill, obviously, is undeniable and he\u2019s a guy who can get a shot off anytime he wants,\u201d Kerr said earlier Monday. \u201cHe\u2019s been in similar situations with us where he\u2019s had long layoffs. He\u2019s Kevin Durant. If we have him out there, he\u2019ll be a threat.\u201d He won\u2019t be out there again this season. \u201cI just feel so bad for him,\u201d Curry said. \u201cNobody should have to go through something like that.\u201d Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":33223,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-cavs-hiring-lindsay-gottlieb-assistant","date":"2019-06-12","title":"Cavs hire Cal's Lindsay Gottlieb as assistant coach","content":" CLEVELAND (AP) \u2014 The Cavaliers have lured away another prominent college coach. This time, from the women\u2019s game. Lindsay Gottlieb is leaving California after eight seasons to join John Beilein\u2019s staff in Cleveland and become the seventh female assistant in the NBA. Gottlieb led the Golden Bears to seven NCAA Tournament appearances and their first trip to the Final Four (2013). While she\u2019s not the first female assistant in the world\u2019s pre-eminent men\u2019s league, she\u2019s the first to make the jump from head college coach to a pro bench. The Cavaliers recruited the 41-year-old Gottlieb, who said she was impressed and intrigued by the team\u2019s goals following a recent meeting with Beilein and general manager Koby Altman. \u201cI knew this was an organization I wanted to be a part of and a team I wanted to dedicate myself to,\u201d said Gottlieb, who went 179-89 at Cal. \u201cWhile this move provided a unique and special chance to move directly from Cal Berkeley and women\u2019s college basketball to the NBA, it was really about being part of building and growing something special and adding value to a team and organization that is focused on doing things in a way that I believe strongly in.\u201d \u201cThe vision for the Cavs\u2019 future is compelling and I look forward to helping make it a reality. At the same time, on a personal level, I am honored to hopefully impact young girls and women to be empowered to pursue their own visions and to be inspired to turn them into reality as well.\u201d Altman, who persuaded Beilein to leave Michigan after 12 seasons, is excited about what Gottlieb brings to a young Cavaliers team that endured two coaching changes since October. \u201cShe has an extensive track record of success and growth with her teams and players and has also been a strong culture-driver as a core part of that,\u201d Altman said. \u201cThe more we researched and got to know Lindsay, the more we came to understand that she would be an impactful part of where we want to go as a team.\u201d Beilein added former Memphis coach JB Bickerstaff as an associate head coach shortly after being hired. \u201cLindsay truly values and embraces player development and a culture of winning basketball habits,\u201d Beilein said. \u201cHer success at Cal Berkeley speaks for itself and her insight in our meetings, practices and games will hold tremendous value. After sitting with her, it was easy to see how she will connect quickly with our staff and our players, and we all benefit because of that connection.\u201d Commissioner Adam Silver has been pushing for more female inclusion in the league and Gottlieb raises the number of women with on-court roles to 10. She joins Becky Hammon (Spurs assistant), Kristi Toliver (Wizards assistant), Karen Stack-Umlauf (Bulls assistant), Natalie Nakase (Clippers player development), Jenny Boucek (Mavericks assistant), Lindsey Harding (Sixers player development) and referees Lauren Holtkamp, Ashley Moyer-Gleich and Natalie Sago."},{"id":33225,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/lillard-wins-j-walker-kennedy-award-official-release","date":"2019-06-12","title":"Blazers' Damian Lillard wins J.

Walter Kennedy Citizenship Award, as administered and selected by the Professional Basketball Writers Association (PBWA). Named after the NBA\u2019s second commissioner, the honor is presented annually by the PBWA to a player, coach or athletic trainer who shows outstanding service and dedication to the community. Lillard was one of five finalists for the 2018-19 J. Walter Kennedy Citizenship Award, along with Charlotte Hornets center Bismack Biyombo, Phoenix Suns guard Devin Booker, Memphis Grizzlies guard Mike Conley and Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr. The finalists were chosen by a committee of 25 PBWA members from a list of 27 nominees submitted by NBA teams. The winner was determined by a vote of the entire PBWA, which is composed of more than 200 writers and editors who cover the NBA regularly for newspapers, magazines and online news outlets. * Past J. Walker Kennedy Citizenship Award winners A seven-year NBA veteran, Lillard is being honored for supporting and inspiring high school students in Portland through his RESPECT program, which encourages youth to Show Up, Work Hard and Be Kind. Lillard, who has spent his entire career with the Trail Blazers since being selected with the sixth overall pick in the 2012 NBA Draft, started the anti-bullying platform in 2013 after meeting with Portland school administrators to identify schools that most needed a more positive culture among students. Lillard has partnered with three Portland high schools \u2013 Madison, Parkrose and Roosevelt \u2013 to reinforce the value of education and celebrate student achievement. He has participated in school assemblies and class discussions and has empowered teachers and counselors to reward respectful, diligent students with tickets to Trail Blazers games, RESPECT merchandise and special events with Lillard such as a private tour of the team\u2019s practice facility. The schools have reported significant progress resulting from Lillard\u2019s commitment, including improvements in student behavior, engagement, attendance and tardiness. \u201cDamian Lillard\u2019s sustained commitment to inspire young people in Portland is inspiring,\u201d said PBWA President Josh Robbins of The Athletic . \u201cPBWA members honor him and commend his fellow finalists and nominees for their laudatory work.\u201d In addition to his efforts to drive generational change with Portland students, Lillard has served as a Global Ambassador for the Special Olympics since 2013. In February, he was an honorary coach at the eighth annual NBA Cares Special Olympics Unified Game at NBA All-Star 2019 in Charlotte. Lillard, who turns 29 in July, averaged 25.8 points, a career-high 6.9 assists and 4.6 rebounds in 80 games this season. He earned his fourth NBA All-Star selection and was named to the 2018-19 All-NBA Second Team. The 6-3 guard helped Portland reach the Western Conference Finals for the first time since the 1999-00 season. Lillard will receive his J.

Per Shams Charania of The Athletic, Irving is reportedly not opting into his deal for 2019-20. That will make him an unrestricted free agent once free agency opens on June 30. Boston had expected this move, Charania reports, and now will gear up to make its pitch to keep Irving in the fold. Irving is coming off a stellar season in which he averaged 23.8 points per game and a career-best 6.9 assists per game while shooting 48.7 percent from the floor and 40.1 percent on 3-pointers. He was named to the All-NBA Second Team (his second All-NBA nod in his career), adding to a career that includes an NBA championship, an All-Star game MVP, a Kia Rookie of the Year Award and six All-Star appearances. A week ago, Celtics president Danny Ainge addressed the media about Boston\u2019s looming summer . NBA free agency rules forbid players and teams from working on deals until the free-agent moratorium is lifted at 6 p.m. on June 30. When asked by reporters about Irving\u2019s exit interview with the team after the playoff loss to Milwaukee, Ainge said, \u201cIt was good.\u201d Overall, Ainge was mostly mum about whether or not Irving will be back in Boston come the 2019-20 season. \u201cI don\u2019t know, I mean, there\u2019s not much I can say about that, honestly. But there\u2019s ongoing conversations. We\u2019ll just have to wait and see what happens there,\u201d Ainge said. When asked if there were any indication from Irving\u2019s camp that he does not want to come back to Boston, Ainge said that was not true. \u201cI have not received that indication, no,\u201d Ainge said.

In an interview with Sports Illustrated , Paul stressed that Davis intends to hit free agency next summer no matter where he ends up. Davis holds a player option for next season that will allow him to enter unrestricted free agency in the summer of 2020. \u201cWhere he\u2019s going to land? I have no idea,\u201d Paul told Sports Illustrated \u2018s S.L. Price . \u201cAnd it don\u2019t matter. We\u2019re going into free agency. Why does it matter to me where he goes? Earth: We\u2019re going into free agency. He has a year, he has to play. But after that, I can\u2019t say it no bigger: WE ARE GOING INTO FREE AGENCY. 2020: ANTHONY DAVIS WILL BE IN FREE AGENCY. \u201d Paul informed the Pelicans in January that Davis wanted out and had no intention of signing a long-term contract extension with the team. The Pelicans have been aware of what Davis wants, and while many trade rumors regarding him bubbled up leading into the NBA\u2019s trade deadline, he was ultimately not dealt. The Boston Celtics have long been considered to be in the mix with the Los Angeles Lakers, LA Clippers, New York Knicks and Brooklyn Nets for Davis. However, the Celtics cannot realistically pursue Davis in trades until guard Kyrie Irving makes his future plans with the team known. Paul made it clear in the Sports Illustrated story that even if Boston does acquire Davis, they must be prepared to face the summer of 2020, too. \u201cThey can trade for him, but it\u2019ll be for one year,\u201d Paul says. \u201cI mean: If the Celtics traded for Anthony Davis, we would go there and we would abide by our contractual [obligations] and we would go into free agency in 2020. I\u2019ve stated that to them. But in the event that he decides to walk away and you give away assets? Don\u2019t blame Rich Paul.\u201d Paul also dispelled the notion that he is trying to get Davis to the Lakers, where the versatile big man would be playing alongside former Kia MVP and Finals MVP winner LeBron James. \u201cDid you say that to David Falk? Would you say that to Arn Tellem?\u201d Paul told Sports Illustrated , referring to two agents who once juggled stables of clients without charges of conflicts of interest. \u201cYou\u2019re only saying that because you feel like, \u2018Well, Rich wouldn\u2019t be in this position without LeBron,\u2019 right? My thing is: Take LeBron off the Lakers. Are the Lakers not a great destination for an arguably top-two player that went to Kentucky and won a national championship, signed with Nike? For a team that\u2019s had centers from George Mikan to Wilt Chamberlain to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to Shaq? \u201cSo now, when you add LeBron, that\u2019s what? The cherry on top. LeBron\u2019s 34 years old. Anthony Davis is 26. So when LeBron\u2019s done playing, the Anthony Davis trade is still rolling. What better place to do it than L.A.? If it was L.A. \u2014 I never said \u2018L.A.\u2019 But there\u2019s no negative to that. Who gives a s\u2014 what you\u2019re talking about, about me trying to help LeBron out? No, I\u2019m not. I\u2019m trying to help Anthony Davis. Now, if helping Anthony Davis helps LeBron in the long run? So be it. But my goal is Anthony Davis.\u201d As for the Knicks, Paul said the following: \u201cThe only difference is, they don\u2019t have as many championships as the Lakers. They got a tradition. It\u2019s a big market \u2014 not that it\u2019s only big markets. They have cap space, flexibility, they\u2019re able to absorb more than one star. What\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d Paul also gave his version of why the Pelicans were unable to deal Davis before the Feb. 7 trade deadline. He told Sports Illustrated that former Pelicans GM Dell Demps is to blame, as Paul says he never intended for Davis\u2019 trade demand to go public. Paul says he first informed Demps of Davis\u2019 desire to be dealt on Jan. 25, with Demps saying he\u2019d talk with owner Gayle Benson and get back to him. However, Paul says Demps contacted Davis himself and never got back to Paul. In addition, ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski (who broke the news of Davis\u2019 trade request) contacted Demps to confirm Davis\u2019 demands. \u201cIt was necessary to go public,\u201d Paul said, per Sports Illustrated . \u201cWhen I told you, \u2018Here\u2019s our intentions,\u2019 and you say, \u2018Hey, let me talk to ownership,\u2019 and instead of you talking to ownership you call Anthony Davis? That\u2019s called being ignored.\u201d To Paul, Demps also violated player-agent etiquette by speaking directly to Davis (\u201cThat\u2019s a no-no. Every GM knows that,\u201d Paul said). Demps was fired on Feb. 15 amid the fallout from the Davis trade drama. The Pelicans\u2019 season quickly cratered after Davis\u2019 trade request, as they were 22-28 on Jan. 28 and went 11-21 to finish 33-49 and miss the playoffs. Davis appeared in 56 games, a career-low, and saw downturns in his overall shooting (51.7 percent) and 3-point shooting (33.1 percent) from 2018-19. Following the Feb. 7 trade deadline, Davis never played more than 34 minutes in a game . The disgruntled six-time All-Star missed his seventh straight game to close out the 2018-19 season with what the team has listed as back spasms. He wore a T-shirt with the famous Looney Tunes sign off, \u201cThat\u2019s All Folks,\u201d written across the chest to New Orleans\u2019 final home game of the season. As he walked down the tunnel toward the locker room after the game, he gave one fan a high-five. Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry at one point in mid-February termed the effect of Davis\u2019 trade demand on the team as a \u201cdumpster fire.\u201d David Griffin, the Pelicans\u2019 new executive vice president of basketball operations, met with Davis in Los Angeles at the end of May . While the talks were reportedly \u201crespectful\u201d and \u201cproductive,\u201d it was still considered \u201chighly unlikely\u201d that Davis would waver from his stance in seeking a trade. Since then, Griffin has reportedly become open to multi-team trades for Davis as he has provided potential suitors with the framework of a trade package he\u2019d want for the All-Star. Per Wojnarowski, the Knicks, Nets, Lakers and Clippers are among the front offices acquiring about Davis as well as some other, non-preferred teams feeling emboldened to enter the pursuit of Davis. Overall, Wojnarowski reports, Griffin hasn\u2019t sounded convinced that a team-to-team swap for Davis is likely to fulfill his wishes for the franchise in a post-Davis state. Davis has averaged 23.7 points, 10.5 rebounds and 2.4 blocks in 466 career games. The Pelicans have reached the playoffs just twice during his tenure, with one series victory. Overall last season, Davis averaged 25.9 ppg, 12 rpg, 2.4 bpg, 3.9 assists and 1.6 steals per game.

He\u2019s going to finish it, either in Game 6 of The Finals on Thursday ( 9 ET, ABC ) or Game 7 on Sunday ( 8 ET, ABC ), having shot a little better. In the four games that he\u2019s played in this series, Thompson is 20-for-35 from 3-point range . That\u2019s four times as many makes on one fewer attempt than he had in those first seven games of the regular season. It\u2019s a good time for a hot streak and Thompson is certainly on one. Only one player has made more 3-pointers per game in a Finals series than Thompson\u2019s five per game. That was teammate Stephen Curry , who made 22 (5.5 per game) on 53 attempts in a sweep of the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2018 . Thompson\u2019s combination of volume and accuracy is unprecedented, and it\u2019s a big reason why the Warriors and Toronto Raptors are still playing. Thompson was the Warriors\u2019 leading scorer in their Game 2 victory . In Game 5 on Monday, he drained seven 3-pointers \u2014 including the go-ahead bucket with 58 seconds left . When the Raptors review the Game 5 film, they\u2019ll see a plethora of ways in which they let Thompson get free to drain those seven 3-pointers. On the Warriors\u2019 second possession of the third quarter, they quickly got the ball to Thompson in the post against Kyle Lowry. That situation that produced one of their first buckets of Game 4 . Since then, the Raptors have been sending a double-team pretty aggressively. With Marc Gasol doubling the post-up in this case, Thompson used an old Michael Jordan tactic (which Toronto\u2019s Kawhi Leonard had employed against Philadelphia earlier in the playoffs). As Gasol arrived, Thompson attacked the big man\u2019s outside foot. Not only did Gasol\u2019s momentum prevent him from keeping up, but Gasol essentially set a screen on his own teammate (Lowry).               When Leonard pulled the move against Philly, he found space at the foul line for a 15-foot jumper\u2026 Thompson went for the extra point\u2026               Thompson has had a few 3-pointers in this series where he\u2019s needed minimal space to get his shot off. His first three points of Game 5 fell into that category as well. Lowry got around an Andre Iguodala screen pretty cleanly to contest Thompson\u2019s catch-and-shoot attempt. The great thing about Thompson, though, is that he\u2019s 6-foot-7 with a high release at the top of his jump. That allowed him to shoot relatively easily over the 6-foot-1 Lowry. On the horizontal plane, Lowry is contesting this shot as closely as possible without fouling. On the vertical plane, he\u2019s not even close\u2026               Lowry has been Thompson\u2019s primary defender in The Finals, with Thompson shooting efficiently and more often usual with the opposing point guard chasing him. Overall though, the Raptors have been pretty good defensively, holding the Warriors to 90 points on 86 possessions when that\u2019s been the matchup. The overall defense hasn\u2019t been as good when Danny Green has defended Thompson, but Green has had more success in suppressing Thompson\u2019s individual scoring. Alas, two of Thompson\u2019s Game 5 3-pointers were scramble situations where Green got caught flat-footed. Midway through the first quarter, Lowry stripped Thompson in the post (when Thompson again attacked the double-team), but got beat to the ball by Draymond Green, who got the ball back to Thompson before Danny Green (guarding Kevin Durant) could rotate over\u2026               Late in the third quarter, Green got caught drifting toward the other end of the floor when Stephen Curry rebounded his own miss and hit a relocating Thompson in the corner\u2026               Though Curry has been off the floor for about 18 percent of Thompson\u2019s minutes in The Finals, he\u2019s been on the floor for 19 of Thompson\u2019s 20 3-pointers (or 95 percent of them). You would think that Thompson would shoot more with Curry off the floor. But that hasn\u2019t been the case. Thompson has had a lower usage rate with Curry on the bench ( 19.7 percent ) than he has with Curry on the floor (22.7 percent), and he\u2019s managed to launch just four 3-point attempts in those 27 minutes that Curry has been resting. In one of the biggest shots of Game 5 \u2014 Thompson\u2019s 3-pointer that put the Warriors back within three with 2:32 to go in the game \u2014 was a clear illustration of how Thompson gets more and better looks when his \u201cSplash Brother\u201d is on the floor. With 13 seconds left on the shot clock, Draymond Green slipped a screen for Curry and immediately went to set another screen for Thompson. But both Green\u2019s and Curry\u2019s defenders (Lowry and Fred VanVleet, respectively) stayed with Curry \u2026               That left one defender (Leonard) to guard the ensuing Thompson\/Green pick-and-roll. And when Green set a solid screen (no slip this time) on Leonard, Thompson stepped into an open, pull-up 3-pointer before Lowry could rotate over \u2026               The Raptors might prefer that Norman Powell rotate off of Quinn Cook in the corner in that situation, but that\u2019s a tough double-action to defend, and give a ton of credit to \u2026 Two possessions later, Curry tied the game with a catch-and-shoot 3-pointer where he got a step on VanVleet via an exchange with Thompson. The possession after that, Thompson was again the beneficiary of the attention paid to his point guard. After a Leonard miss on the other end of the floor, Curry pushed the ball down the floor and shook VanVleet, drawing Lowry\u2019s help \u2026               When Curry passed the ball to Iguodala under the basket, Leonard left Thompson to protect the rim. Two rapid passes later, Leonard was scrambling back to Thompson, who side-stepped the close-out and drained the eventual game-winning bucket \u2026               Thompson is generally a better shooter off the catch (42.8 percent on catch-and-shoot 3-pointers over the last three years) than off the dribble (39.3 percent on pull-up 3-pointers over the last three years), but his percentage on the latter has improved (from 31 percent in 2016-17 to 43 percent this season). And in this series, he\u2019s a remarkable 7-for-9 on pull-up 3-pointers , including 4-for-4 when he\u2019s dribbled once . A close-out that makes him put the ball on the floor (like Leonard\u2019s on that last play) hasn\u2019t done much to deter him. Durant\u2019s 11 points in 12 minutes in Game 5 proved to be critical. But with him out again, the Warriors need to continue to get as much offense as they can get from Curry and Thompson. The Raptors can be (and have been) better at defending the two shooters than they were in Game 5, when they didn\u2019t really make the Warriors work late into their possessions to get their 3-pointers. Only one of the Warriors\u2019 20 3-pointers (the most they\u2019ve ever made in a Finals game ) came in the last six seconds of the shot clock. One fewer threat on the floor makes things easier for the Toronto defense . But with Curry and Thompson, the Warriors always have a shot. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

We s aw a similar scenario play out in Boston in two seasons ago with Isaiah Thomas\u2019 hip injury. Thomas initially suffered the injury in March, sat out two games, and then played through the pain until he re-injured the hip in the Eastern Conference semifinals. Thomas eventually required surgery, leaving us to wonder whether he\u2019ll ever be the same player again. The player health vs. championship aspirations dilemma happens across pro sports. In 2012, t he Washington Nationals shut down pitcher Stephen Strasburg a month before the playoffs, choosing to protect their young ace, who was two years removed from elbow surgery. Washington deemed his long-term health was more important than their chances at a World Series title. Durant was questionable to return in Game 5 of the 2019 NBA Finals after being out for over a month with a calf injury. The two-time Finals MVP would be returning to a crucial showdown with his team down 3-1. The prospect of Durant playing in this series may have had Kawhi Leonard, Kyle Lowry and Raptors fans losing sleep at night. A healthy Durant returning was the biggest threat aimed at Toronto and Canada enjoying its first-ever NBA title. The Warriors\u2019 dynasty was built for Durant. If Durant is healthy and at the top of his game, the Warriors could enter the conversation of greatest sports team ever by winning a third straight title. That\u2019s what made this decision so extremely difficult for Durant, the Warriors and NBA fans. It is a moral dilemma that begs to question: Is an athlete simply a means to an end? In Game 6 of the 1988 NBA Finals against the Los Angeles Lakers, I played on a severely sprained right ankle for the Detroit Pistons, running the risk of a career-ending injury. I was willing to be a means to a championship end for my team and for the city of Detroit. Some of the most iconic moments in sports have been accomplished while players were injured. We will never forget Willis Reed of the New York Knicks putting it all on the line. Reed inspired the Knicks and their fans as he limped out of the tunnel In Madison Square Garden in Game 7 of the 1970 NBA Finals. And the Knicks would be champs afterward. Is it ever acceptable for an athlete to protect himself and not risk it all? Should an athlete reserve their years of earning capacity and health? People should always be treated with respect and dignity. They can be treated as an ends and as a means. But no one should ever be treated only as a means. We might look to philosophy when determining right from wrong and what is in the individual\u2019s and the team\u2019s best interests. In his \u201cGroundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals,\u201d German philosopher Immanuel Kant describes people as rational beings who have value and dignity which should not be used by others for the benefit of others. Let\u2019s apply that philosophy to players, coaches and management. They all find themselves in a dilemma, at every level of play. We have seen players undervaluing their value to themselves by taking \u201cmagic\u201d potions to become winners, knowing well the damage that they\u2019re doing to their internal organs and taking the risk of potentially shortening their careers and perhaps their lives. These athletes treat their bodies as a means to an end. Fans want to see Durant perform, to see him risk it all, to become the full means to an end. But even then, there is no guarantee of winning the championship. Are we OK with using the athletes for their ends or helping them to develop into \u201cends?\u201d Are we OK with using \u201cmind games\u201d to convince or coerce a player to make the sacrifice of himself for the greater good \u2014 a championship? Kant and most philosophers would see this as immoral. But in sports, this dilemma is played out daily and was on full display in Game 5 of the 2019 Finals. What would you do? What could you lose? Is the risk worth the reward? * * * Hall of Famer Isiah Thomas  , a 6-foot-1 guard from Indiana University, was the second pick in the 1981 NBA Draft.

The Grizzlies will introduce Jenkins at news conference on Wednesday. \u201cTaylor has an excellent coaching pedigree, and we are confident he will lay the groundwork of developing the young players on our roster while having the elite basketball acumen and forward-thinking positive vision to be a high-level NBA head coach,\u201d Zachary Z. Kleiman, the Grizzlies\u2019 executive vice president of basketball operations, said in a statement Tuesday. Memphis became the sixth and final NBA team to hire a new coach after firing J.B. Bickerstaff following the end of the season in April. Jenkins, 34, was Mike Budenholzer\u2019s assistant in Milwaukee this season and in Atlanta for five seasons. Jenkins becomes Memphis\u2019 fourth head coach since the Grizzlies chose not to renew Lionel Hollins\u2019 contract in 2013 after he led them to their lone Western Conference final appearance. The new Grizzlies coach started in the NBA as an intern with the San Antonio Spurs\u2019 basketball operations department during the 2007-08 season after graduating from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania with a degree in economics. Jenkins then was an assistant coach with the Spurs\u2019 G League team, the Toros, and worked under both Quin Snyder, now head coach of the Utah Jazz, and Brad Jones, now coach of Memphis\u2019 G League team. Jenkins was named head coach of the Toros for 2012-13 and led thm to a first-round playoff victory. He went to Atlanta as an assistant to Budenholzer, then followed the head coach to Milwaukee, where the Bucks went an NBA-best 60-22 this season before losing to Toronto in the Eastern Conference Finals. Memphis controlling owner Robert Pera fired Bickerstaff the day after he wrapped up his first full season on the job and with the 33-49 Grizzlies missing the playoffs for a second straight year. Bickerstaff had been named interim coach in November 2017 when David Fizdale was fired, but this time Pera chose to restructure the front office by adding basketball operations to president Jason Wexler\u2019s duties. He also promoted Kleiman, 30, to executive vice president of basketball operations. Former NBA player Tayshaun Prince was later promoted to vice president of basketball affairs in late April, and former general manager Chris Wallace was moved to scouting. Memphis goes into the draft with the No. 2 pick overall for the first time since 2009 looking for someone to pair with Jaren Jackson Jr., who was named to the NBA All-Rookie team in May. The Grizzlies are rebuilding after tying their own NBA record for most players used in a season at 28 for a second year in a row and setting the NBA mark with 20 different leading scorers. The Grizzlies also have to decide what to do with 31-year-old guard Mike Conley, who remains under contract for two more seasons and is due $67 million on the max contract he signed in July 2016. Chandler Parsons still has a year left on his deal after playing only 95 games combined over the first three seasons. Memphis also has Dillon Brooks, who was limited to 18 games by injuries, and Kyle Anderson, signed to a four-year deal last summer, is recovering from surgery on his right shoulder. The Grizzlies hope hiring Jenkins will be enough to persuade Jonas Valanciunas, acquired in the February trade for Marc Gasol, to exercise his $17.6 million player option for this season. Thursday is the deadline for that option."},{"id":33247,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/five-things-we-learned-2019-finals-game-5","date":"2019-06-11","title":"Five things we learned from Game 5 of The Finals","content":"Five things we learned from the Golden State Warriors\u2019 106-105 victory against the Toronto Raptors in Game 5 of the 2019 NBA Finals at Scotiabank Arena: We all should have bosses who care about us the way Bob Myers clearly cares about Kevin Durant . Myers took to the podium late Monday night, after earlier helping Durant to a waiting car as the Golden State Warriors\u2019 star hobbled out of the building in a walking boot and into an uncertain future. When Myers spoke publicly, he still sounded devastated, tearing up as his voice cracked in the midnight hour for those in the East. \u201cIt\u2019s people, sports is people,\u201d said Myers, the Warriors GM. \u201cI know Kevin takes a lot of [criticism] hits sometimes, but he just wants to play basketball and right now he can\u2019t. Basketball has gotten him through his life. \u2026 I don\u2019t know that we can all understand how much it means to him. He just wants to play basketball with his teammates and compete.\u201d Durant\u2019s ability to do that in these Finals ended early in the second quarter , when he lost the ball on a spin move, staggered, then fell into a sitting position, grabbing his lower right leg. Durant had missed Golden State\u2019s last nine playoff games with a right calf strain. His Game 5 injury was termed an Achilles injury, with an MRI set for Tuesday. Myers self-nominated for any blame that people cared to lay, offering cover to the Warriors\u2019 medical and training staff for their input into the decision to have Durant play in Game 5. But blame is a waste of time. The impact on the Warriors and on The Finals ranked second and third, frankly, to the impact of this mishap on Durant\u2019s short- and longer-term future. In the moment, his teammates and coaches were pulled in opposite emotional directions, delighted with the outcome but anguished over the circumstances. \u201cI\u2019m so proud of them,\u201d coach Steve Kerr said, \u201cjust the amazing heart and grit that they showed, and on the other I\u2019m just devastated for Kevin. So it\u2019s a bizarre feeling that we all have right now. An incredible win and a horrible loss at the same time.\u201d Stephen Curry also talked about his friend, the situation, Durant\u2019s toughness and having the opportunity yanked away from him like Charlie Brown\u2019s football. But it was left to Klay Thompson, who hit two of the Warriors\u2019 three daggers in the closing minutes that snagged Game 5, to provide the proper perspective. \u201cWe do it for Kevin,\u201d Thompson said, when asked how his team soldiers on. \u201cWe do it for \u2018K.\u2019 I can tell you this, he wants us to compete at the highest level, and we\u2019ll think of him every time we step on the hardwood.\u201d This no longer is the conjecture and abstract stuff from the past five weeks, when analysts wondered if Golden State might be \u201cbetter\u201d without Durant. Every one of the Warriors has shot that theory down, and different does not mean better. There\u2019s no doubt losing Durant for what\u2019s left of the series leaves Golden State\u2019s cupboard more bare basketball options-wise. Kerr and Toronto\u2019s Nick Nurse have talked repeatedly about all the ways in which the Warriors benefit from Durant\u2019s presence, whether he\u2019s shooting over the Raptors\u2019 defense or simply exerting gravity to open space for his teammates. But now, there\u2019s a focal point for the Warriors\u2019 emotions. It\u2019s not the muddle of will-he-or-won\u2019t-he, and how-much-will-he-have. Now the Warriors can distill the jumble of exhilaration and depression that washed over them Monday into a goal and an inspiration. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a rough go in terms of just trying to recalibrate,\u201d Curry said. \u201cUntil this point it\u2019s been about our hope that he could play and our hope to stay alive in this series.\u201d But the emotional roller coaster Curry spoke of is on a straightaway now, maximum speed to the end. One game at home, (possibly) one more on the road, without the guy who gave them 11 points in 12 minutes Monday but with a fresh fire, and a better chance than they had at tipoff of Game 5. Ask yourself this: Does this make the defending champions less dangerous? Or more dangerous? Through three preliminary rounds and four Finals games, Nurse was introducing himself to the NBA\u2019s casual community in impressive ways. His unaffected personality makes him easy to like \u2014 \u201cEnjoy the game,\u201d he tells reporters as he wraps up each pregame media session \u2014 and his adjustments against each opponent so far makes him easy to respect.  Nurse has been demonstrating a willingness for weeks now to try things without sweating the reaction of the basketball intelligentsia. His decision to throw a box-and-one defense at Curry raised eyebrows and triggered smirks from those who consider the tactic a relic best reserved for college or high school games. But Nurse shrugged and partied on as the Raptors moved within three minutes and five seconds of hugging the Larry O\u2019Brien trophy. Then, uh oh. Toronto \u2014 more precisely, Kawhi Leonard \u2014 had just scored 10 unanswered points to thrust the Raptors into a 103-97 lead. The crowd at Scotiabank and the tens of thousands more outside at \u201cJurassic Park\u201d could taste the franchise\u2019s first NBA title. But when Nurse called not one but two timeouts at 3:05, he doused some of that enthusiasm, snuffed his team\u2019s moment and gave the Warriors a chance to gather. By current NBA rules, he was going to lose those two timeouts at the 3-minute mark. But he didn\u2019t have to use them. \u201cWe just came across [mid-court] and just decided to give those guys a rest,\u201d Nurse said. \u201c[We] just thought we could use the extra energy push.\u201d W hile his guys were resting, though, so were Kerr\u2019s. As Draymond Green said, \u201cWe had a \u2026 chance to gain our composure.\u201d The Warriors scored the next nine points, and Toronto\u2019s only counter was a Kyle Lowry bucket on which DeMarcus Cousin\u2019s goaltended. There\u2019s no way to know if all of that happens without Nurse\u2019s timeout calls, but his double-stack when he could have put pressure on Kerr to burn his final one did get in the way of the Raptors\u2019 run, something coaches are loathe to do. (By the way, can we all calm down about the Toronto fans momentarily cheering Durant\u2019s injury? It was a reflexive response, seeing an opposing player they respect and fear perhaps headed back to the sideline for The Finals after aggravating a calf injury that no one considered career-altering. From their seats, that\u2019s about all those locals knew. The fans needed to shift gears in that moment, same as Warriors fans had to adjust on the fly when Kyrie Irving blew out his knee in Game 1 of the 2015 Finals. Once they did, there was applause in the building and even a chant of \u201cKD! KD!\u201d Nobody was delighting in Durant\u2019s pain or suffering, nobody was wishing him the worst.) Leonard was in the midst of his personal 10-0 push when the time came for selected media members to submit their Finals MVP ballots. It was a simple piece of paper, with room for one name only, and the obvious choice \u2014 assuming the Raptors closed out the victory \u2014 was Leonard. The laconic forward had been terrific through the Finals\u2019 first four games. He was finally cutting loose in Game 5, too. And yet, Leonard had an inefficient, unreliable game Monday. Until his late spark, he missed 13 of his 18 shots and was stuck on 16 points. He wound up shooting 9-of-24, 2-of-7 on 3-pointers, and had five turnovers to go with his 26 points, 12 rebounds, six assists and two blocks. He was absolutely correct to pass up the final shot, blitzed as he was by Golden State\u2019s Thompson and Andre Iguodala. Forcing something there would have fed the worst elements of \u201chero ball.\u201d So instead Leonard got the ball to Fred VanVleet, who seemed to have the best options \u2014 shoot or drive. But VanVleet shoveled the ball to Lowry in the left corner, and the point guard\u2019s attempt barely left his hands before it hit Draymond Green\u2019s fingers . Certainly, Leonard could use a little more help. Lowry, Danny Green and Norman Powell are shooting a combined 38.8 percent overall. Pascal Siakam is 2-of-15 from the arc in this round and 15-of-72 since Game 1 against Philadelphia. But if Leonard is going to walk off with the second Finals MVP of his career, he\u2019s going to have to earn it Thursday and\/or Sunday. Ballots will be recast both days (barring a blowout for the Warriors in Game 6), and he\u2019s a heavy favorite. But save for the fourth-quarter spurt, Leonard labored against Golden State\u2019s defensive attention. C\u2019mon, does anyone really believe the Warriors are going to lose all three of their home games in this series? They were 9-3 in The Finals at Oracle Arena through their past four trips (2015-18). T he crowd in Oakland, on top of all that talent, made for one of the most daunting stops in the NBA for road teams. And this was well before the sense of finality that has descended on the outdated and soon-to-be forsaken barn in the East Bay. Until the final few minutes of Game 5, it was possible that Golden State had played its last game at Oracle, though that reality never fully hit home. The players and coaches didn\u2019t dare get their heads around it because once Game 4 was in the books, any sense that they were done at Oracle meant they necessarily would be done in The Finals in Toronto. Now order has been restored, Toronto up only 3-2, as if each team has controlled its home games. \u201cThe biggest thing, the biggest advantage is being at Oracle Arena one more time,\u201d Curry said, \u201cwhere our fans can really get behind us, and we\u2019re going to have to will ourselves for another 48 minutes to stay alive.\u201d Said Draymond Green: \u201cI\u2019ve never seen this group fold. And that stands true still.\u201d G reen, who had 10 points, 10 boards and eight assists while hounding Leonard and thwarting Lowry\u2019s final shot , isn\u2019t done yet. Neither, it turns out, is Cousins, who stepped into the breach when Durant went down and finished with 14 points. Consider the alternative for the Raptors \u2014 wringing champagne out of their clothes, finalizing a parade route \u2014 the last thing they wanted to do was travel three time zones again, regardless of their success in Games 3 and 4 there. \u201cYeah, our goal was to get them back on the plane, get them back to Oakland,\u201d Thompson said. Frankly, if Toronto could, it might take the loss now and wave everyone on to Game 7 Sunday at Scotiabank . It would save the Raptors the wear and tear of hauling their butts to California and back, and avoid subjecting themselves to whatever indignities, ankle sprains and confidence dings the Warriors and their fans might heap upon them. \u201cYeah, we had a chance to win a championship \u2026 and we didn\u2019t do it,\u201d VanVleet said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t play well enough. We didn\u2019t execute enough down the stretch and that stings a little bit. But there\u2019s a lot more basketball left to play.\u201d How much is left in either team\u2019s tank at this stage? \u201c It don\u2019t matter,\u201d Draymond Green said. \u201cI hope no one has anything left in the tank [after Game 5] because if you do, you didn\u2019t give enough. But when we step back on our floor for Game 6, that\u2019s all that matters. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re the only team battling. They\u2019re battling as well. Everybody is facing fatigue at this point. \u2026 You\u2019ve got to do what you came here to do anyway.\u201d Certainly it\u2019s possible Durant could still make the biggest splash on the market this summer. And there\u2019s no reason to think one or more suitors wouldn\u2019t be willing to pay him premium bucks next season to rehab and provide hope beginning with the 2020-21 season. Even that, though, could affect what free agents might choose to play with him, if they\u2019d feel as if they\u2019d be sacrificing a year, too. It\u2019s possible that this mishap keeps Durant with Golden State \u2014 he can invoke his player option for next season, earn another $31.5 million and rehab on the dime of the team for whom he sacrificed this week, while taking another run at the market in 2020. Then again, Durant will turn 31 in September. He has logged big minutes and long seasons and it\u2019s only a guess as to how the most severe of Achilles injuries might affect his future performances. Maybe he\u2019s still effective at an All-Star level, but a changed player in the way, say, Rudy Gay got stronger and bulkier but less mobile after his Achilles tear. Maybe it\u2019s all a great unknown until Durant actually rehabs and makes it back, wherever he opts to land. There\u2019s no denying, though, that it adds another huge variable to summer that already had Leonard pondering a relocation, Kyrie Irving presumed to be gone from Boston, Anthony Davis still making unpleasant noise in New Orleans and about 40 percent of NBA players overall in search of new contracts this season. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

All that\u2019s left is a siren blaring and asking \u2026 Why? Why did the Golden State Warriors clear Kevin Durant to return to the NBA Finals on Monday? Why did he feel compelled to do so after missing nearly a month with a calf strain? Why did a segment of the basketball populace question the severity of his injury \u2014 and, by extension, his heart \u2014 during the lead-up? And why do the basketball Gods seem to have it in for a two-time Finals MVP and all-time great who put his team first, and possibly just put his career in jeopardy? The Raptors fans who lined up 24 hours early in the rain just to watch on TV outside Scotiabank Arena aren\u2019t shook. The citizens who braced for a championship celebration into the wee hours and now must deal with deflation aren\u2019t shook. Not even the Raptors, who coughed up a six-point lead with roughly 3 1\/2 minutes left and now must fly 3,000 miles for another tip. No, it\u2019s the Warriors who were left dazed and confused despite extending the series to another game with the 106-105 victory , and it was all captured in the quivering voice of team president Bob Myers while revealing Durant suffered an Achilles injury early in the second quarter. \u201cHe\u2019s a good teammate,\u201d Myers finally managed to say. \u201cHe\u2019s a good person \u2026 it\u2019s not fair \u2026 he just wants to play basketball and right now he can\u2019t.\u201d No, he can\u2019t, and Tuesday\u2019s MRI will determine when that can happen again. Slow-motion TV replays that showed Durant executing a dribble move past Serge Ibaka and then dropping quickly to the floor were not positive. When Durant grabbed his leg on May 8, he reached high on his calf. This time, he reached low. A segment of the fans initially cheered Durant\u2019s misfortune, and when Kyle Lowry and Serge Ibaka put them in check, the reaction quickly flipped from insensitive to respectful. But it didn\u2019t matter in the big picture that they applauded Durant. He was helped to the locker room by director of sports medicine and performance Rick Celebrini and Andre Iguodala. Stephen Curry left the bench and walked behind Durant, consoling him. Durant cursed loudly as he reached the tunnel. Then he disappeared from view and later left the arena by crutches right after halftime. In the history of The Finals, there was no tougher scene to witness, no matter the rooting interest. This was a basketball betrayal, pure and simple, that happened to Durant. But should it have? Plenty of questions now surround the medical protocol used by the Warriors. Durant took part in what was loosely termed a practice for the first time just a day earlier . Was that enough? Did he pass all the stress tests by then? Did the exams and MRIs give a green light? Were the experts fully apprised? And, perhaps most crucially, how much of this Achilles injury could be directly related to the calf injury and should that have been perhaps a larger concern? \u201cHe went through four weeks with a medical team and it was thorough and we felt good about the process,\u201d Myers insisted. \u201cHe was cleared to play tonight, that was a collaborative decision. I don\u2019t believe there is anyone to blame, but I understand in this world that if you have to, you can blame me.\u201d Beyond that, was there any pressure \u2014 either implied or indirectly placed or discreetly suggested \u2014 within the organization for Durant to return and rescue the Warriors? They were down 3-1 without him. Durant is famously sensitive about how he\u2019s perceived, especially regarding his toughness. Maybe he felt pressure himself to quiet the noise and whispers. Complicating matters is his pending free agency. Durant stood to make hundreds of millions on the market this summer, and a torn Achilles, if that\u2019s what the MRI will show, can require a year to rehab. In the moment, Durant\u2019s injury had a temporary bonding effect between the two teams; a handful of Toronto players approached Durant before he checked out and both benches appeared equally stunned. \u201cIn this league,\u201d explained Lowry, \u201cwe\u2019re all brothers, and it\u2019s a small brotherhood and you never want to see a competitor like him go down.\u201d Before the injury, Durant showed flashes of the next-level skills that helped him lead the Warriors to the last two championships. He hit his first two shots , both from deep. He commanded coverage from Kawhi Leonard, Toronto\u2019s best defender. He had a presence. This injected confidence within the Warriors, who broke out a nine-point lead with Durant on the floor and seized early command. He, Curry and Thompson were 12-for-19 shooting for 36 points through the early second quarter. With their missing star in the fold for the first time this series, Golden State looked whole again. Once Durant left the floor, the game tightened until the fourth. Leonard (26 points), who shot poorly to that point, made his move, with 10 quick points to send a quake through the arena. Curiously, Raptors coach Nick Nurse called consecutive timeouts with his team buzzing and up six with 3 minutes, 5 seconds left. Did that kill the momentum? Curry and Thompson answered with consecutive 3-pointers to tie and then take the lead with 56 seconds left. Then, on Toronto\u2019s final possession, Thompson and Andre Iguodala trapped Leonard and forced him to surrender the ball. It found its way to Lowry, deep in the corner. But Draymond Green got his fingertips on the ball , Lowry\u2019s shot was harmless and the buzzer sounded. No confetti fell from the ceiling, no bottles were popped in the home locker room, no trophy was ceremoniously awarded. Curry and Thompson combined for 57 points and took 27 3-pointers, making 12. They\u2019ll need to duplicate that production Thursday in Oakland and beyond if the Warriors force a Game 7. DeMarcus Cousins was helpful post-Durant and had 14 points. \u201cThey\u2019ve accomplished so much over the years and that doesn\u2019t happen just with talent,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cThere has to be more that goes into it and it\u2019s that fight, that competitive desire and ability to stay poised under pressure. It was brilliant to watch.\u201d And yet: There was little joy. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to even celebrate this win,\u201d said Klay Thompson. \u201cI told the team I didn\u2019t know what to say because, on one hand I\u2019m so proud of them for the amazing heart and grit they showed, and on the other I\u2019m just devastated for Kevin,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cSo it\u2019s a bizarre feeling that we all have right now.\u201d It\u2019s a reflex to say the Warriors were inspired by Durant and perhaps they were. When he fell, they had their excuse, yet thought otherwise. For them to play the final 2 1\/2 quarters while dealing with a fractured state of mind says plenty about their mental toughness. \u201cIt had made it difficult, especially with the start we got off to and Kevin was playing so well, so it was a real shock when he went down,\u201d said Kerr. \u201cSo I give our guys credit.\u201d Durant at times became a magnet for his personality quirks and especially his non-commitment regarding free agency; it was even raised by Green when the two infamously clashed on the bench earlier this season. If nothing else, the injury further endeared Durant to the locker room and, in particular, to his fellow MVP. \u201cEverybody gets so wrapped up in chasing championships, but life is more important in terms of caring about an individual and what they\u2019re going through,\u201d Curry said. \u201cAnd you see the commitment and the challenges and just what has been thrown at KD this whole year, really. He gave us what he had, he went out there and sacrificed his body and we know how that turned out. \u201cWhen you get to know somebody and see how genuine they are and how committed they are to basketball, you root for those type of guys. All those emotions come into play when you see him go down like that. It\u2019s not even about this series; it\u2019s about long term, his mindset and being able to get back to being the player and the person he has shown consistently over the course of his career.\u201d The Warriors return to Oracle Arena for the final game in the old barn before moving to the Chase Center in San Francisco next season. That means there is motivation to shut the building down in style. Of course, there\u2019s the goal of forcing Game 7, and finally, to win a title so Durant\u2019s injury won\u2019t be in vain. \u201cWe do it for Kevin,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cHe wants us to compete and the highest level, and we\u2019ll think of him every time we step on the hardwood. You think of him every time you dive for a loose ball or go for a rebound, because I know him and I know how bad he wants to be out there. I\u2019m going to miss him, man. It\u2019s not the same being out there without him.\u201d * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

After blowing a 14-point lead and trailing by six points with less than three minutes to go, the defending champs came back to pull out a 106-105 victory in Game 5 of The Finals . The Warriors somehow survived, despite Kevin Durant suffering an Achilles injury less than 12 minutes into his return from a month-long absence and despite a remarkable 12-2 run from Kawhi Leonard and the Raptors midway through the fourth quarter. Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson led the way with a combined 57 points, but the Warriors also got a key offensive contribution from DeMarcus Cousins, who came off the bench after Durant\u2019s injury to score 14 points in less than 20 minutes. One stat stood out from the rest as the Warriors guaranteed one more game at Oracle Arena. 20 \u2014 3-pointers made by the Warriors in Game 5. The Raptors outscored the Warriors 54-32 in the paint, 21-10 from the free throw line, and 6-4 from mid-range. But from beyond the arc, the score was 60-32, as the Raptors had one of their worst 3-point shooting games of the postseason. The Warriors\u2019 20 3-pointers were the second-most for a team in a Finals game in NBA history, fewer than only the Cleveland Cavaliers\u2019 24 in Game 4 of the 2017 Finals . In 26 Finals games prior to Monday, the Warriors \u2014 the greatest shooting team in NBA history \u2014 had never made more than 18 3-pointers. The eight 3s the Warriors made in Game 4 of this series were tied for the fewest that they\u2019ve made in 27 Finals games over the last five years. They came back three nights later (and on the road) to make more than twice as many, and they needed every last one. It started with Curry on the Warriors\u2019 very first possession of the game. He curled off a Draymond Green screen and drained a 3 from the top of the arc before Danny Green or Pascal Siakam could contest it. Not long after that, Durant hit a pair of 3s from the right side of the floor on back-to-back possessions. And then it was Thompson with two 3s of his own. Just four and a half minutes into the game , the Warriors had scored 19 points on nine possessions, shooting 5-for-5 from beyond the arc. That pace was unsustainable, but Durant hit another three before suffering his devastating injury. Thompson finished 7-for-13 from beyond the arc on Monday and is now an amazing 20-for-35 from 3-point range in The Finals . Curry was 5-for-14 in Game 5 and, just as important, Green and Andre Iguodala were able to knock some down. Iguodala was just 4-for-24 from 3-point range over his prior seven games , but hit one of his three attempts on Monday, a corner 3 off a Curry drive that put the Warriors up 10 midway through the third quarter. At 12-for-53 (23 percent) Green remains the worst 3-point shooter among players with at least 25 attempts in these playoffs. But he was 2-for-4 from deep in Game 5, with a big one to put the Warriors up four midway through the fourth. That was the result of another Curry drive (and an extra pass from Iguodala). Of course, it was Curry and Thompson who hit the three biggest shots of the night. With the Warriors down six and less than three minutes to go in the game (and possible in their season), Curry drew two defenders to the ball on a right-side pick-and-roll, which left only one defender guarding the ensuing Thompson\/Green pick and roll at the top of the key. That defender was Leonard, and he got screened by Green, allowing Thompson to step into a 3 from the left wing . Raptors 103, Warriors 100. Two possessions later, Curry curled off a double-screen on the left side of the floor, gaining just enough distance from Fred VanVleet to launch a clean 3 off an Iguodala pass. Raptors 103, Warriors 103. After Leonard missed a 3 of his own, Curry quickly got the ball up the floor and to Iguodala on the baseline. With the Raptors scrambling to recover, Thompson was wide open on the left wing. Two passes later, he side-stepped Leonard\u2019s close-out and drained another 3 to give the Warriors the lead for good. Warriors 106, Raptors 103. It was a 9-0 run that changed the game \u2026 and possibly the series. The Warriors turned the ball over on their final two possessions, but Green blocked a Lowry 3 at the buzzer to send The Finals back to Oakland for Game 6 on Thursday (9 ET, ABC). The Warriors rank only seventh in the playoffs in the percentage of their shots that have come from 3-point range (38 percent). But when their season was on the line, they came up big from beyond the arc.

He only hit two jumpers and was done, too gimpy to go any further. The Warriors, starved for points against a toothy Toronto Raptors defense, will require plenty more than that from Durant before he\u2019s done. Back then, it was winner-take-all, New York vs. L.A. Durant and the Warriors are trailing 3-1 and face elimination at Scotiabank Arena. They\u2019re staring down a far deeper and darker tunnel. This is the stark reality for a would-be savior and his recuperating calf and the desperate two-time defending champions. Durant will at last play for the Warriors after sitting out since Game 5 of the Western Conference semifinals. Whether he stays long enough to break a sweat or plays well enough to make the Raptors perspire is the real issue. Perhaps never before has an injury to a superstar of this magnitude been this mysterious \u2014 and perhaps costly \u2014 in the history of The Finals. Remember, with Reed, the Knicks won the series. Maybe there\u2019s more in common with Magic Johnson pulling a hamstring in 1989 during Game 1. In that instance, Magic was finished for the series and so were the Lakers (as they were swept by the Detroit Pistons). Durant\u2019s return is looking to both squelch the innuendo swirling about his recovery and also trigger a historic comeback. Can he pull this off after not playing since May 8, and practicing for the first time only Sunday? It was a practice, but only in the tamest sense. Durant joined his teammates and took part after the media was hustled off the court, leaving no outside witnesses or sneaky TMZ footage. The Warriors, this time of year, only conduct light drills. And it was over within an hour. To recap: Durant is supposed to step into an intense basketball game after missing a month, and battle a Toronto defense led by Kawhi Leonard, and thwart a championship bid by a team and city bracing for a maddening celebration around midnight, and \u2026 rescue the Warriors? OK, then. \u201cI think it\u2019s pretty easy to realize we obviously miss him out there and he\u2019s propelled us to two championships in two years,\u201d said Warriors guard Klay Thompson. \u201cSo it would be pretty storybook if he could come back and help us do the same.\u201d If it sounds like the Warriors are so stretched for answers and solutions that they\u2019re banking on Durant being close to normal after a lengthy layoff, well \u2026 maybe they are. When you\u2019re facing elimination, there\u2019s really no other choice. And the Warriors haven\u2019t been able to solve the Raptors without him. Yet Durant has set himself a high bar. Before his injury, which occurred in the Western Conference semifinals against the Houston Rockets, he was on a nearly galactic level. He averaged 34 points, five rebounds and five assists in 11 games and was a finalist for everyone\u2019s \u201cbest player in the playoffs\u201d honors with the Milwaukee Bucks\u2019 Giannis Antetokounmpo. Since then Leonard, the postseason leader in points, and rebounds, and minutes, has yanked that praise for himself. The Raptors, as a result, are heavy favorites to lift the trophy. Durant may not be fully healthy, leaving what he can possibly do an open question: Will he be more of a decoy than a legitimate offensive threat? And on defense, how can the Warriors cover for him, since the Raptors will surely try to exploit the situation by running Durant through screens? Without Durant, the scoring burden had to be carried by Thompson and Stephen Curry. While both have handled that fairly well, the Warriors have had little margin for error. Whenever Draymond Green, Andre Iguodala or DeMarcus Cousins failed to lend support for Thompson and Curry, the results have been disastrous. Coach Steve Kerr feels Durant\u2019s presence will be enough to cause a ripple effect that influences what both teams do when he\u2019s on the floor. \u201cThe game plan changes if Kevin is out there, or if he\u2019s not,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cSo you adapt accordingly. It changes matchups, it changes rotations, all that stuff.\u201d It\u2019ll be a surprise if Durant\u2019s return causes issues within the Warriors and the system that was tweaked in his absence. Although they\u2019ve been without him for nine games, he did play three seasons with them, which means there shouldn\u2019t be any adjustment problems. Quite the contrary, says Curry. \u201cWe\u2019ll be able to adjust in transition pretty smoothly,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s been in plenty of Finals and has played well. No matter what the percentage he\u2019s at, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be impactful and effective.\u201d It\u2019s always tricky to play doctor and determine how much time Durant should\u2019ve missed, although that never deters anyone from doing so. Taking it a step further, while none of his teammates or coaches publicly questioned the depths of Durant\u2019s injury, dealing with the daily dose of \u201cis he or isn\u2019t he?\u201d became tiring to some. They all suspect that if Durant could\u2019ve played, he would. What possible motive would encourage him to stay out longer than necessary? To show everyone how much the Warriors need him? That seems a stretch for someone who craves a championship. Possibly not his pending free agency either; if anything Durant would get bonus points for playing through pain and would have all summer to recover in the event of re-injuring the calf, which is not considered career-threatening. Injured players have no obligation to speak to the media, and Durant hasn\u2019t, with his silence only feeding speculation. \u201cI feel for Kevin,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cI know what type of competitor he is and we obviously miss him dearly. But whether it\u2019s tomorrow or Game 6, we just have to do everything in our power to help him get back. He will be very welcome, I\u2019ll say that much. Kevin\u2019s (injury) is serious and I know how badly he wants to be out there. He\u2019s one of the best competitors I\u2019ve been around.\u201d The stretchy shooting range, the high release of a shot that\u2019s nearly impossible to block or discourage, the energy and determination and ability to make plays in tense moments \u2014 those are the elements Durant brings and the Warriors have missed in The Finals. They\u2019ll take whatever he can give, whatever that might be. \u201cI would like to think he would make a difference,\u201d Warriors reserve Shaun Livingston said. \u201cAgain, it\u2019s just any time a player of that caliber comes back or goes out of the lineup, it\u2019s going to be felt certain ways. We\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d And if Durant is unable to play extended minutes or sputters around the floor, making mistakes and dogged by rust and fatigue and inefficiency? Then it\u2019ll fall on his teammates, a group that couldn\u2019t beat the Raptors in two games at Oracle Arena yet somehow must thrive in a Canadian madhouse that awaits Monday. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see a resilient Warriors team,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had our backs against the wall with this same group. Obviously, it\u2019s a little more daunting being down 3-1 but usually when our backs are against the wall, we respond the best.\u201d Question is, will Durant have their back? Or will he and that wall crumble under pressure from these hungry Raptors and the long odds? * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

The Pelicans are reportedly open to multiteam trades for Davis as Griffin has started to provide potential suitors with the framework of the trade package he\u2019d want for the star big man, ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski reports . The New York Knicks, Brooklyn Nets, Los Angeles Lakers and LA Clippers are among the front offices inquiring New Orleans about Davis, Wojnarowski reports. The Boston Celtics have long been considered to be in the mix for Davis, but cannot realistically pursue Davis in trades until guard Kyrie Irving makes his future plans with the team known. Other, non-preferred teams have been emboldened in pursuing Davis after seeing how the Toronto Raptors\u2019 pursuit of Kawhi Leonard has that franchise on the cusp of an NBA title tonight . Overall, Wojnarowski reports, Griffin hasn\u2019t sounded convinced that a team-to-team swap for Davis is likely to fulfill his wishes for the franchise in a post-Davis state. While Griffin has offered no firm timetable on a trade taking place, he has indicated he prefers the acquisition of 2019 draft picks to take place before the June 20 event in Brooklyn , Wojnarowski reports. Overall, Griffin is pursuing a combination of assets that include an All-Star player, a young player who has All-Star potential and two first-round picks. New Orleans has the No. 1 overall pick in the 2019 draft. Per Wojnarowski, the team wants to build around whomever it picks at that spot as well as Jrue Holiday, who was an All-Defensive second teamer this season. Griffin met with Davis in Los Angeles at the end of May , having what was a reportedly \u201crespectful\u201d and \u201cproductive\u201d conversation about his future in New Orleans. However, it was considered \u201chighly unlikely\u201d that Davis would change his mind about wanting to be traded. Before that, Griffin reiterated his belief that he can convince Davis to stay put. Those comments came during a conference call to introduce newly hired GM Trajan Langdon , at which time Griffin also said he planned to talk with Davis and his agent, Rich Paul, in Los Angeles at some point soon. Davis, 26, initially asked to be traded in late January , midway through his seventh season with the Pelicans. He holds a player option that will allow him to reach unrestricted free agency in the summer of 2020. The six-time All-Star has averaged 23.7 points, 10.5 rebounds and 2.4 blocks in 466 career games. The Pelicans have reached the playoffs just twice during his tenure, with one series victory. Overall last season, Davis averaged 25.9 points, 12 rebounds, 3.9 assists, 1.6 steals and 2.4 blocks per game. He appeared in 56 games, a career-low, and saw downturns in his overall shooting (51.7 percent) and 3-point shooting (33.1 percent) from 2018-19. Following the Feb. 7 trade deadline, Davis never played more than 34 minutes in a game . Davis was fined $15,000 by the NBA after he made an obscene gesture to a fan after a 115-109 home loss to the Charlotte Hornets on April 3. The disgruntled six-time All-Star, who missed his seventh straight game to close out the 2018-19 season with what the team has listed as back spasms, wore a T-shirt with the famous Looney Tunes sign off, \u201cThat\u2019s All Folks,\u201d written across the chest. As he walked down the tunnel toward the locker room after the game, he gave one fan a high-five.

In an interview with Marc J. Spears of The Undefeated , Parker made his announcement in San Antonio, telling Spears: \u201cI\u2019m going to retire. I decided that I\u2019m not going to play basketball anymore. \u201cA lot of different stuff ultimately led me to this decision,\u201d Parker said, per The Undefeated. \u201cBut, at the end of the day, I was like, if I can\u2019t be Tony Parker anymore and I can\u2019t play for a championship, I don\u2019t want to play basketball anymore.\u201d Via Twitter, Parker posted the following: \u201cIt\u2019s with a lot of emotion that I retire from basketball, it was an incredible journey! Even in my wildest dreams, I never thought I would live all those unbelievable moments with the NBA and the French National Team. Thank you for everything!\u201d Parker said he plans to live in San Antonio after retirement but will spend time in France as the owner and president of ASVEL, a French pro men\u2019s and women\u2019s basketball team, The Undefeated reports. Selected 28th overall by the Spurs in the 2001 Draft , Parker had said he hoped to play 20 seasons in the NBA. A six-time All-Star, Parker was named to the All-NBA second team three times in his career and was Finals MVP in 2007. He spent the 2018-19 campaign with the Charlotte Hornets, who signed him after the Spurs opted not to bring him back as a free agent last summer. Parker reportedly signed a two-year deal with the Hornets and came off the bench in each of his 56 games last season. Parker stated 1,151 games regular season games and averaged 15.5 points and 5.6 assists per game. He also played in 226 playoffs games, averaging 17.9 points and 5.1 assists per game. \u201cIt has been a blessing to be with him since he was 19 years old,\u201d Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said on a USA Basketball conference call Monday. \u201cI have watched him develop as a player and human being and as a business man.\u201d Hornets general manager Mitch Kupchak congratulated Parker on a \u201cremarkable career\u201d in a release. \u201cHis impact on the game of basketball and the path he laid out for international stars have no equal,\u201d Kupchak said. \u201cI\u2019m grateful for the year he spent with us here in Charlotte and we wish him the best as he moves on to the next chapter of his life.\u201d Hornets coach James Borrego said Parker is a Hall of Famer. \u201cI have never known the NBA without Tony as a part of it and I\u2019ll truly miss him,\u201d Borrego said. \u201cTony\u2019s leadership, his presence and his dedication to winning made an impact on shaping me and I\u2019ll always be appreciative of him. I know our organization in Charlotte is grateful for what he brought to us in our year together. I wish him nothing but the best as he moves on to retirement.\u201d Parker told The Undefeated he enjoyed playing for the Hornets, but without a championship run on the horizon, it became hard to want to keep going. \u201cFor 17 years, every year that I started with the Spurs, I really thought that we had a good chance to win the championship. And so it was very weird to arrive to a team and you\u2019re like, \u2018There is no way we\u2019re going to win the championship.\u2019 And even if I had a great time \u2014 and the Charlotte players, they were great with me and they were great guys \u2014 at the end of the day I play basketball to win something, and it\u2019s been like that with the [French] national team when we try to compete for a gold medal or with the Spurs to win a championship. And if I don\u2019t play for a championship, I feel like, why are we playing? And so that\u2019s why it was very different for me mentally to focus and get motivated to play a game that I love, because I want to win something.\u201d He averaged 9.5 ppg on 46 percent shooting and 3.7 assists per game. Parker moved up to 17th place on the NBA\u2019s all-time assists leaderboard (7,036) and trails only Steve Nash for most by an international player. Only Dirk Nowitzki and former teammate Tim Duncan have played more regular season games amongst non-US-born players than Parker (1,254). In his final season with the Spurs, Parker played 55 games averaged 7.7 points and 3.5 assists. During his career, the six-time All-Star averaged 15.8 points and 5.7 assists. He was part of 137 playoff wins with Popovich, the second most by any coach and player in NBA history. Popovich and Spurs star Tim Duncan combined for 157 playoff wins. Parker was part of the Spurs\u2019 Big Three with Duncan and Manu Ginobili, but Parker\u2019s news means all three are now retired. Together, they combined to win four NBA championships and reach five NBA Finals. Parker told The Undefeated that the recent retirements of his former Big Three compatriots did not factor greatly into his own decision. \u201cIt had a little impact, but at the same time, I still, like I told you in many interviews, I thought I was going to play my 20 seasons with the Spurs,\u201d Parker said. \u201cBut talking with Timmy and talking with Manu, that helped a little bit, like, \u2018OK, I\u2019m ready for this. Timmy and Manu are not playing, it\u2019s not the same.\u2019 \u201d Parker has also appeared in 17 consecutive postseasons; only Karl Malone and John Stockton\u2019s run of 19 straight playoff trips are longer. The Hornets missed the playoffs last season, ending his run of playoff showings. Overall, Parker said he has no regrets in signing with the Hornets and playing for team owner Michael Jordan. \u201cIt was a great experience. I met some great people, and I really appreciate Michael giving me the opportunity and [general manager] Mitch Kupchak and JB [coach James Borrego],\u201d Parker said, via The Undefeated. \u201cIt was a great, great time. The guys were great. So no, I don\u2019t regret anything because I really wanted to play and I really wanted to show that I can still play. I had a good season. I was healthy. I don\u2019t regret anything. And it\u2019s funny, in a way, I feel like the fact that I went to Charlotte, I feel like in San Antonio, they love me more.\u201d Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":33288,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/players-selected-team-usa-training-camp-official-release","date":"2019-06-10","title":"Players selected for Team USA's 2019 training camp","content":" Featuring 20 NBA standout players, including six who are new additions to the 2019-20 USA Basketball Men\u2019s National Team roster, USA Basketball Chairman and National Team Managing Director Jerry Colangelo today announced the athletes who will attend the Aug. 5-9 USA Basketball Men\u2019s National Team training camp that will be used to select the 2019 USA World Cup Team.

VanVleet literally dripped blood under one of the baskets after taking an errant elbow from the Warriors\u2019 Shaun Livington, who opened up a gash around VanVleet\u2019s right eye. The blow sent the Raptors\u2019 reserve guard crashing to the floor and left him with a chipped tooth and an early exit from the game that left Toronto up 3-1 in these NBA Finals . \u201c It would hurt a lot more if we had lost,\u201d VanVleet told reporters Sunday at Scotiabank Arena. A number of Raptors have stepped up, game-to-game, in crafting the victories that have them on the brink of the first NBA championship in the franchise\u2019s 24-year history. None embodies their toughness more than VanVleet, a feisty, sturdy 6-foot guard who most often can be found hoisting high-arcing shots from the Raptors\u2019 perimeter. At the other end, though, VanVleet routinely goes where other undersized guards fear to tread, sticking his beak into the paint where his face and head are at just about the most vulnerable height. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to get knocked around like that if you don\u2019t stick your nose in there sometimes,\u201d VanVleet said. \u201cIt happens, it\u2019s basketball. If you haven\u2019t gotten your eye cut up or get hit in the mouth a couple times playing basketball, then you\u2019re playing it the wrong way.\u201d While VanVleet\u2019s full name \u2013 Fredderick Edmund VanVleet \u2013 might make him sound like a banker or venture capitalist, not one drop of that blood spilled in Oakland was blue. He has beginnings as humble as anyone in The Finals: Raised in a rough part of Rockford, Illinois, VanVleet spent four years at Wichita State without fanfare (10.2 ppg, 4.5 apg), then went undrafted in 2016. He signed with Toronto and spent his rookie season on a yo-yo to\/from the G League before making a little playoff noise in a cameo against Milwaukee and Cleveland. In 2017-18, VanVleet was former coach Dwane Casey\u2019s full-service backup, averaging 20 minutes and 8.6 points off the bench behind Kyle Lowry while hitting 41.4 percent of his 3-pointers. This season, Nick Nurse, Casey\u2019s replacement, started VanVleet 28 times and bumped his minutes to 27.5. So far this postseason, the more VanVleet has played, the more has gone well for Toronto. In the Raptors\u2019 first 14 playoff games against Orlando, Philadelphia and Milwaukee, VanVleet averaged 19.3 minutes, 4.1 points and 2.4 rebounds while making only 21.2 percent of his 3-pointers. The team\u2019s record: 8-6. Starting with Game 3 against Milwaukee, Toronto has gone 8-1 with VanVleet averaging 32.6 minutes, 12.8 points and 3.4 assists. He has shot 47.9 percent from the arc. One angle on VanVleet\u2019s resurgence \u2013 that he somehow channeled the birth of his son Fred Jr. during the Bucks series into on-court improvement \u2013 got shot down by daddy almost immediately. \u201c I wish I could go back in time and not tell anyone that I had a kid,\u201d he told The Athletic. \u201cSo that I could get all the glory for turning around my performance.\u201d Nurse frankly doesn\u2019t care. He wasn\u2019t even fully aware of the turnaround, or at least the statistics of it. \u201cM ore than anything, we always use the term \u2018Just keep playing,\u2019 right?\u201d the Raptors coach said before Game 4. \u201cI think that\u2019s what he did. I think he started playing good after a [1-for-11] game, and I remember I didn\u2019t even know he was 1-for-11]. That was the game Kyle fouled out with six to go that went to double overtime [Game 3 in the East finals], and I thought he played so great, I was in there singing his praises in the press conference. \u201cAnd someone said, \u2018You know, he was 1-11,\u2019 and I said \u2018No, I didn\u2019t know.\u2019 Because he was running hard and making plays. And I think just keep playing. Some nights the ball is going in, some nights it isn\u2019t. But just impact the game any way you can, not just with your shooting or your scoring.\u201d Nurse has sought VanVleet\u2019s pace and assertiveness the past two games against Golden State, starting him alongside Kyle Lowry as a second point guard after halftime of Games 3 and 4. The results could not have been better. VanVleet doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a mere coincidence that he\u2019s one of three players from his home state in these Finals. Warriors veterans Andre Iguodala (Springfield) and Shaun Livingston (Peoria) also were born and raised in Illinois. \u201cIt speaks to the basketball pedigree of Illinois and the areas outside Chicago that don\u2019t get as much recognition, but still produce a high level of talent,\u201d VanVleet said. Only one of them, however, will take the court in Game 5 with a new mouthpiece and stitches, having passed concussion protocol over the weekend, while blinking through blurred vision out of a randomly watering right eye. VanVleet has become an indispensable member of Toronto\u2019s Finals rotation. \u201cI know how important I am to this team, to this franchise, and I know what I bring to the table,\u201d he said Sunday. \u201cThat\u2019s never in question, never in doubt. [I] just try to focus on maximizing my potential each night and giving my team the best chance to win.

The Golden State Warriors hope he will again on Monday. With the Warriors\u2019 backs to the wall now in the NBA Finals, Durant \u2014 now out for more than a month with a strained calf \u2014 took the practice floor on Sunday in an effort to determine if he will be able to play in Game 5 of the title series on Monday night (9 p.m. ET on ABC) . His status for the game was upgraded to questionable Sunday evening. The Warriors trail the Toronto Raptors 3-1 in the series, and need three straight wins to capture a third straight championship. \u201cHe\u2019ll get some extra work in with some of our younger players and we\u2019ll gauge it from there,\u201d Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. Durant was not made available to comment. The Warriors had their media availability in Toronto on Sunday prior to the practice session. Durant averaged 26.0 points per game for the Warriors during the regular season and 34.2 points in 11 playoff games before he got hurt in Game 5 of the Western Conference semifinals against Houston. The Warriors are 6-3 in the nine games Durant has missed. \u201cIt\u2019s just having another powerful weapon out there who can do some very dynamic things on the floor,\u201d Warriors guard Stephen Curry said. Kerr said the plan was to see if Durant could clear some hurdles that he hasn\u2019t crossed during his recovery. Kerr said earlier in the series that Durant could return after completing one practice. \u201cHe will be very welcomed, I\u2019ll tell you that much,\u201d Warriors guard Klay Thompson said. \u201cI think it\u2019s pretty easy to realize we obviously miss him out there. He\u2019s propelled us to two championships in the last two years, so it\u2019d be pretty storybook if he comes back and helps us do the same. \u2026 I know how badly he wants to be out there. He\u2019s one of the best competitors I\u2019ve ever been around.\u201d Toronto allowed Kobe Bryant to score 81 points on Jan. 22, 2006. In the 1,175 Raptors games since, the most anyone has scored against them is 51 points \u2013 done twice, done both times in Toronto, and done both times by Durant. He had 51 for Oklahoma City in Toronto on March 21, 2014, and scored 51 for the Warriors on the Raptors\u2019 home floor back on Nov. 29. Even if he isn\u2019t 100%, Durant\u2019s mere presence should make the Warriors more potent on the offensive end. The Raptors will have a plan, of course, if Durant gets on the floor Monday night. \u201cIf he plays, he\u2019s an MVP, he\u2019s an All-NBA player, he\u2019s an All-Star, Finals MVP,\u201d Raptors guard Kyle Lowry said. \u201cBut we can\u2019t focus on that.

Their standard defense is, technically, a man-to-man. But often, there\u2019s at least one Toronto defender playing zone and ignoring his assignment. And in Game 4, the Warriors being ignored weren\u2019t able to do anything about it. This was the ninth straight game that the Warriors played without Kevin Durant. And it was the one where his presence, at least on the offensive end of the floor, was missed the most. Over the previous eight games, the Warriors had scored 113.3 points per 100 possessions . They were better in their 11 playoff games with Durant ( 117.0 per 100 ), but 113.3 was still sufficiently efficient. Game 4 was the Warriors\u2019 worst offensive game of the postseason, though. They scored just 92 points on 95 possessions, a rate more than 10 points per 100 possessions worse than any of their previous 19 games . Even with both Curry and Thompson on the floor, the Warriors were held to just a point per possession (77 on 77). It\u2019s hard to think that a team with Curry and Thompson doesn\u2019t have enough shooting. And the pair combined to score 55 points in Game 4. But most of those 55 points did not come easy. And getting enough offensive production from elsewhere on the roster was even more difficult. On the Warriors\u2019 very first possession of Game 4, Pascal Siakam left Andre Iguodala alone once he cleared out to the weak side. Siakam hung near the basket for a full 12 seconds before DeMarcus Cousins committed the first of the Warriors\u2019 19 turnovers.               For contrast, note how Siakam followed Klay Thompson on a similar action just three possessions later, when Danny Green left Draymond Green to help force another turnovers out of Cousins\u2026               In regard to Golden State perimeter players not with the ball, the Raptors chased Curry and Thompson, while ignoring Green, Iguodala, and Shaun Livingston. And it\u2019s hard to argue with the results, as the latter three shot a combined 1-for-8 from outside the paint . Livingston, of course, has attempted just five 3-pointers (not including shots from the backcourt) over the last three years. Iguodala attempted six threes in Game 3, but is just 4-for-24 (17 percent) from beyond the arc since the start of the conference finals . And the 10-for-49 (20 percent) that Green has shot from 3-point range in the playoffs is the worst mark among 71 players with at least 25 attempts . Green was given two wide-open looks from outside in the first half om Friday. The first came off an Iguodala drive when Siakam was ignoring him on the right wing. Danny Green could have rotated off of Curry to contest, but chose (wisely) to stay with his man. The second jumper for Green came when Siakam helped on a Curry drive, and it doesn\u2019t get much worse than a wide-open corner three off the side of the backboard\u2026               After that shot off the side of the backboard, Green didn\u2019t attempt another shot from outside the paint. Not only was he not making shots, he wasn\u2019t even threatening to take them. Midway through the third quarter, a quick-hitting Iguodala screen for Thompson drew two defenders to the shooter. Iguodala was open on his roll to the basket, but the Toronto defense collapsed, and the ball found its way back to Green at the top of the arc. Instead of shooting an open three himself, Green got the ball back to Iguodala, who had relocated to the left corner, doing his best Curry imitation. Alas, Iguodala\u2019s shot (with 12 seconds still on the shot clock) barely touched the rim\u2026               Notice that, after Thompson gave the ball up, Kawhi Leonard never left Thompson and VanVleet never left Curry. The Warriors have ways to take advantage of a defense that doesn\u2019t want to guard their non-shooters. On the possession following the Iguodala miss above, Siakam was sagging way off of Green, who was on the right wing\u2026               Green set two screens on Kyle Lowry, the second freeing Thompson for a catch-and-shoot three before Siakam could recover and contest\u2026               But there wasn\u2019t enough of that. And even if there was more, it puts a lot of stress on Thompson and Curry to keep moving until they get open, and when they do get open, make 25-foot shots at a high rate. There also weren\u2019t a lot of Curry\/Green pick-and-rolls. According to Second Spectrum tracking, Curry used a Green screen only nine times in Game 4. The first resulted in a Curry hitting a step-back jumper over Leonard, but those nine plays resulted in only eight points for the Warriors. You could certainly argue that Curry\u2019s tank wasn\u2019t full after scoring 47 points in Game 3 (with 3 and 4 being the only games with just one day of rest in between). But according to Second Spectrum, Curry\u2019s average speed on offense in Game 4 ( 5.02 miles per hour ) was faster than he averaged through his first 19 playoff games ( 4.79 ). The Warriors can obviously be better offensively than they were on Friday. But Game 4 was a pretty desperate situation (33 of 34 teams to take a 3-1 lead in The Finals have gone on to win the championship), and they just couldn\u2019t summon up the offense they needed to keep up with the Raptors. The difference between having three shooting threats on the floor and having just two is huge, especially against a defensive team as good as the one the Warriors are facing in this series. Toronto has earned this 3-1 lead and there should be no implied asterisk should the Raptors win one of the next three games. But there\u2019s no denying that a big part of their success has been their ability to have smart and athletic defenders like Siakam and Leonard play off their primary assignments and help their guards defend the Warriors\u2019 remaining threats. Durant\u2019s status for Game 5 in Toronto on Monday ( 9 ET, ABC ) is unknown as of Sunday morning. If he remains out, the Raptors\u2019 defensive priorities remain clear. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

The scene of so much Golden State wonderfulness the past five seasons? A building about to be abandoned when the Warriors move from Oakland to a state-of-the-art arena across the Bay? Hold up. Asking one more game out of the Warriors seems a lot at the moment. These guys just suffered their second consecutive home playoff loss by 10 points or more, something that hasn\u2019t happened to this franchise in 50 years. After three straight games scoring precisely 109 points, the Warriors came up 15 short Friday. They are 0-9 overall this season when held to double digits, and 0-11 in the playoffs during the Steve Kerr era, when they score 94 or fewer. And now they\u2019re on the wrong side of a 3-1 deficit, lacking everything from certain healthy bodies to an edge, a sharpness that was missing in the second half. Granted, Golden State once held a 3-1 edge in a Finals, all the way back in 2016 \u2026 when LeBron James, Kyrie Irving and the Cavaliers chased them down and became the only Finals team to claw out of such a chasm. The Warriors did the same to Oklahoma City in the 2016 Western Conference finals. So they not only have a blueprint, they have the know-how and an opportunity to do it again. Like Kerr before him on Friday\u2019s postgame podium, Warriors forward Draymond Green spoke of simply trying to win one basketball game, the next game, as the proper way to dig out of this series hole. But then he dropped his guard and mentioned winning three in a row, something the Warriors have done often. But they\u2019re a whole year removed from doing that in a Finals (last year\u2019s sweep of the Cavs) with a healthy Kevin Durant. This is a more worn-down, tired team. In fact, Game 4 was more than Golden State\u2019s 102nd game of 2018-19, regular and postseason combined. It was the 102nd playoff game of their five consecutive Finals runs, which means they have crammed an extra season-plus into their schedules compared to the underachievers on lottery teams sitting at home. From the looks of it Friday, these guys are ready to be toppled, like the Lakers in 1989 and again in 2004, like the Heat in 2014 and the Cavaliers last June. The boisterous Raptors fans who staged their takeover of the Warriors\u2019 building after Game 4 were merely mirroring what their favorite team did on the court from halftime on. Golden State could not stop it. Rudy Tomjanovich might still be inclined to scream into the darkness. (\u201cNever underestimate the heart of a champion!\u201d) But pride only takes you so far, and that\u2019s mostly what the Warriors have left. It took the Raptors more than 18 minutes to score 30 points Friday night, stymied by the pace of the game and particularly Golden State\u2019s scrappy, hustling defense. Immediately after halftime, it took Toronto only 12 minutes to put up 37. The time of death for Golden State on Friday was immediately after Kawhi Leonard drained consecutive 3-pointers \u2013 \u201cF-you\u201d shots, teammate Fred VanVleet memorably coined them \u2013 that boosted Toronto from a four-point deficit to a 12-point advantage. The Warriors already had played well enough to rightly feel they should have had a bigger cushion; falling behind so rudely seemed to buckle the defending champs. That they feel third quarters are their birthright made the switcheroo intolerable. \u201cWe had a big problem with the third quarter in Game 2,\u201d Toronto coach Nick Nurse said. \u201cWe had to make some adjustment there to try to combat the way they come out of the half. We made the decision to put Fred in, [first] in Game 3 and then Game 4 again. Mostly it\u2019s to try to keep up pace of our offense going. It gives us two point guards out there that can push the ball, get it in and get it going, and it kind of paid off. \u201cI know Kawhi\u2019s two big 3s to start the half really changed the whole feel of everybody. Everybody was like, \u2018Okay, man, we know we are here, let\u2019s go,\u2019 and we just kind of kept going from those two 3s.\u201d For the Warriors, who have done that to so many others, turnabout was a pain in the rump. \u201cOh, this sucks,\u201d Draymond Green recalled thinking as Toronto took control of the quarter. \u201cIt sucks really bad. You just try and do whatever you can to change it. Get a stop, get a bucket, get some momentum. Every time we did, they answered.\u201d Green was asked about the difficulty of rattling the stone-faced Leonard with whatever defensive tactic Golden State could muster, and brushed the question aside. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re ever going to rattle Kawhi. Not sure we used that word one time in our scouting report, \u2018We\u2019re going to rattle him,\u2019\u201d Green said. But it\u2019s not just Leonard now. It\u2019s the Raptors. Time after time, whenever Golden State revved up with a couple of scoring possessions, signaling to their fans they ready to make a run, Toronto snuffed it with a 3-pointer or a well-executed pick and roll. They\u2019ve got a team of Kawhis-in-training, unflappable lately if not as inscrutable. \u201cMost teams will take cues from their leaders or their star players, so I think that spreads around a little bit,\u201d Nurse said. But he also praised vets such as Marc Gasol, Danny Green, Kyle Lowry and VanVleet for how steady they\u2019ve been. Now, with the temptation to imagine hoisting a championship trophy, the Raptors might be expected to buy into the stat that, of the 34 teams in The Finals who have led 3-1, 33 of them got their rings. But this team is so focused, so resolute in taking care of business down to the smallest and most mundane task, that all Nurse might have to do is remind them how many aspiring champs won three games in a Finals and still headed into summer empty-handed. (It\u2019s 19.) No trophy, no rings. The chemistry between Serge Ibaka and Kyle Lowry was evident in their playful banter on the podium Friday night. Each slipped into his role, Lowry as the instigator, Ibaka as the target of his playful jibes. \u201cYou joining me?\u201d Lowry asked, as Ibaka got to the podium a half minute after him. \u201cSerge Ibaka, everybody. You all know him. Nice outfit. Worth a lot of money. Is that jacket real leather?\u201d \u201cYes, it\u2019s real leather,\u201d Ibaka said. \u201cPants too tight, he can\u2019t even sit down,\u201d Lowry said. On court, Ibaka\u2019s defensive impact and 20 points in reserve dampened a lot of Warrior enthusiasm. There are nights when Ibaka comes across like Chief in \u201cOne Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest,\u201d a large, lumbering and rather stiff option near the rim with very little to say. Some nights, he even seems to be asleep. But still waters often run deep, too deep for the Warriors in Game 4, it turned out. Ibaka\u2019s here-today, gone-tomorrow shooting touch had him playing in a way that none of Golden State\u2019s three centers \u2013 DeMarcus Cousins, Kevon Looney or Andrew Bogut \u2013 could match. \u201cOnce he gets into the series,\u201d Nurse said, \u201cwhich he did in Game 3 with the blocked shots and the rebounding and stuff, he seems to stay in the series. He usually gives you all of it.\u201d Said Lowry, about knowing when a Serge surge is coming: \u201cHe doesn\u2019t say anything. When Serge is effective defensively is when he\u2019s at his best. I think the scoring just comes. We\u2019re going to make sure he gets that pick-and-pop jump shot, he\u2019s rolling \u2026 When he brings that intensity and that fierceness, it\u2019s kind of tough to stop him on both ends of the floor.\u201d One of the most famous pieces of magazine journalism ever was entitled, \u201cFrank Sinatra Has a Cold,\u201d by Gay Talese, a profile written when Sinatra obviously was ill of body and temper, and didn\u2019t even grant Talese an interview. So our headline kind of tells the story as his did: Curry, one of the top five players in the NBA and probably the greatest overall shooter of all time, was not his two-time MVP self. He wasn\u2019t even the Game 3 version (47 points). The Warriors point guard scored 20 fewer points in this one, and was 2-of-9 from 3-point range. He missed all five of his shots from the arc in the first half and he picked up some obvious frustration fouls. Curry played 43 of the 48 minutes, and Golden State was outscored by 11 points when he was on the court. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t his best game,\u201d Kerr said. Evaluating Curry, for the Warriors, was going to come down to breaking down video and keeping the faith. Evaluating him, for the rest of us, is getting complicated these days by a sense that Curry did not get his due in past Finals \u2013 at least in terms of winning the Bill Russell Award as Finals MVP. But that\u2019s no excuse to don rose-colored glasses every time he hits the floor. As scintillating as his performance was in defeat Wednesday as the Warriors\u2019 only healthy threat, his Game 4 work was raggedy and unproductive. \u201cThey have been aggressive all series and trying to take space away from me and Klay,\u201d Curry said. \u201cI missed some shots early that I usually make, especially from the 3-point line. But overall, I thought I got good looks.\u201d Every game doesn\u2019t need to be a referendum on the level of Curry appreciation. He might have deserved more consideration as Finals MVP in 2015, when Andre Iguodala snagged it with a strong performance in the clinching game. And even though Durant was an easy choice in 2017, there were some who felt Curry was more essential (including this voter). In some cosmic and just way, Curry probably should have been recognized with hardware somewhere among the three. But all signs are pointing to Leonard now, so Curry might have to muddle along with \u201conly\u201d those two Maurice Podoloff trophies for regular-season MVP, along with his All-NBA berths and assorted accolades, his ginormous contract and bounty of commercial endorsements, three rings (unless this series turns around) and a better life than most people who\u2019ve ever walked the planet. It\u2019s possible that Durant will come walking through Rick Pitino\u2019s proverbial door and seize what\u2019s left of the championship series by the throat, playing like the two-time Finals MVP he is. Failing that, if there\u2019s a Game 6, maybe that\u2019s the night Durant at least does a Willis Reed impersonation, limping through the Oracle tunnel to a thunderous roar and hitting a couple of early shots to inspire his teammates to something special. (There still, alas, would be a pesky Game 7 for which to account, back in Toronto, likely muddying the drama.) Then again, maybe Durant doesn\u2019t come back at all. For The Finals or with the Warriors, period. Speculation at this point is all over the map. Some think the Warriors planned to hold him out until things got really dire, to buy extra healing time and maybe not use him at all. Others now believe Durant\u2019s rehab process of his strained right calf back-slid to some degree on Thursday, when he participated in a checkpoint workout with the training staff. A few folks think he never was going to return, regardless. After all, the All-NBA forward hasn\u2019t played since May 8, missing nine fairly important games. This is a league where injuries typically face an \u201cIf this were a playoff game, would he play?\u201d threshold. Durant has been nearly as absent from this NBA postseason as LeBron James. Look, all injuries are different, and even the same type of injury can have different timelines with different sufferers. Klay Thompson rushing back from his hamstring issue after skipping only Game 3 is at the crazy-resilient end of the durability scale. Kevon Looney basically rose from the ashes, giving the Warriors a rim runner and 10 points with six rebounds in 20 minutes off the bench. He had been ruled out for the rest of the series after suffering a rib cartilage fracture in his crash to the floor in Game 2. After anticipation of Durant\u2019s availability got out in front of his reality for a few days, the chatter is more tempered now. There\u2019s a shrug and a whiff of uncertainty folded into every mention. If Durant had his Thursday workout, he would have played Friday. If he had a setback \u2026 Heck, at this point it might be more pragmatic for the medical peeps to declare him out and let the Warriors who\u2019ve come this far see this through, yea or nay. \u201cAs far as KD, there\u2019s been hope that he will come back the whole series,\u201d Draymond Green said. \u201cSo that\u2019s not going to change now. Obviously we hope to have him, but we\u2019ll see what happens. We don\u2019t make that final call, he don\u2019t really even make that final call. His body will tell him if he can get out there or not. And if he can, great. And if not, you still got to try to find a way to win the next game.\u201d The Warriors had been holding out hope for Durant\u2019s return as if he was their ace in the hole, imagining him with zero rust or rhythm issues once back and no limitations on his gait. But he has passed the \u201cIn case of emergency, break glass\u201d point of urgent help possibilities. Now Durant resembles more the keg hanging from a Saint Bernard dog\u2019s collar. It\u2019s a nice idea, but when was the last time one of those dogs saved somebody who literally drank from the little barrel? Toronto is in a foreign land, by NBA standards. But it ain\u2019t the Alps. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

And this time, everyone south of Saskatoon can begin to see it and maybe even buy in. The Toronto Raptors have the scent of a champion. This may come as a surprise to the nostrils of anyone who saw them crumble in past postseasons or figured their chances of getting out of the East this season were dicey \u2026 but Toronto just took a pair of NBA Finals games at Oracle Arena \u2014 and maybe closed it down in the process. The Raptors are headed home with one game to win and history on their side. Thirty-four times in The Finals have teams taken 3-1 leads, and they sipped champagne all but once. (Let\u2019s not discuss that lone team to lose; the Warriors are suffering enough.) This latest Raptors victory was impressively convincing, especially considering the circumstances. They stared at a desperate home team, one that welcomed back Klay Thompson after a one-game injury absence \u2026 a two-time defending champion known for rising to the occasion \u2026 and the Raptors dusted them anyway. You understand exactly what the Raptors did Friday and how it was done? They emerged from the halftime locker room with fire and outclassed a team known for championship pedigree and owning third quarters in the postseason. Kawhi Leonard, who\u2019s uplifting a team and a country, began the onslaught with a pair of 3-point jumpers. The Toronto defense, relentless most of the night and throughout the series as well, squeezed the Warriors and especially Steph Curry. Time after time, Serge Ibaka delivered a counter punch with a key jumper off the pick and roll or a defensive stop. Ibaka had 20 points in 21 minutes in what was his first strong outing from jump to buzzer. Fred VanVleet, felled by a stray Shaun Livingston elbow to the chops in the third quarter, was left bloodied and missing a tooth in a scene that embodied Toronto\u2019s grit. The Raptors simply wore down the more experienced Warriors and Golden State never came up with an answer. Toronto stole the atmosphere \u2014 a smattering of red-garbed Raptors fans suddenly cheered louder and stomped harder and stayed buzzed long after the buzzer \u2014 and sent the Warriors off the court with heads bowed and egos deflated. Oh, something else: Nick Nurse, the first-year Toronto coach, kept pressing the right buttons with his various defensive schemes and substitutions as Golden State failed to break 100 for the first time this postseason. And the Raptors seized control of the series, ensuring that Scotiabank Arena will be a mixture of tense and hysterical Monday for Game 5 (9 ET, ABC). And that\u2019s just from Drake. The crowd will be hyped, too. This is the moment that the basketball population in Toronto has long awaited, to get a sense something special is about to happen, or at least could. And this was made possible by a former Finals MVP who, this time last summer, was in exile with his reputation, at least in San Antonio, in tatters. By November, in Toronto, none of that mattered. \u201cOnce we saw him early in the year, your team\u2019s vision of who they can become changes,\u201d said Nurse. Leonard is a victory away from another Finals MVP and trophy, and mostly a sense of redemption. His passion and championship drive was evident Friday in two stages, both influential to his team. He set an example early by showing pep from the opening tip, carrying the Raptors with 14 of their 17 points over the first 12 minutes. And then, coming out of halftime, Leonard went scorched Earth once again. He posted 17 points and five rebounds in the third, and this time the Raptors lent support. Toronto outscored the Warriors, 37-21, and spent the rest of the game keeping a sneaker pressed on the Warriors\u2019 throat. Kawhi tore through the Warriors constantly, totaling 36 points and 12 rebounds. Yet it was his tone that influenced the game just as much, if not more. \u201cHe imposed his will on the game and his team followed him,\u201d said Draymond Green. \u201cHe gets the job done.\u201d This is why Kawhi\u2019s value to the Raptors is priceless. Until now, Toronto lacked a player with his presence, someone who forced other teams to gameplan differently, someone who seems to thrive when the stakes are highest and is driven in these situations. They didn\u2019t have that with DeMar DeRozan or Kyle Lowry, the leaders and best players of those teams that flourished in the regular season and failed in the postseason. Leonard clearly has the Warriors rattled and their defense stressed whenever he\u2019s in isolation or bracing to attack. \u201cHe hit every big shot, every big momentum shot,\u201d said Curry. Just the same, the Kawhi-inspired defense weighed heavily not only in this game but for much of the series. With the exception of Curry\u2019s monstrous 47-point outburst in Game 3, Toronto hasn\u2019t yielded much from the Warriors \u2014 surely, Kevin Durant\u2019s absence and Thompson\u2019s missed game contributed. Yet the Raptors are floating Leonard around the floor, sneaking in doubles on Thompson and Curry, leaving Green open and encouraging him to shoot, and essentially making it tough for the Warriors to go on a big scoring spree. Toronto has outscored the Warriors in 13 of the 16 quarters of this series. Hounded by the Raptors\u2019 perimeter defense, and maybe gassed from two nights earlier, Curry made only a pair of 3-pointers Friday and never developed a rhythm. And while Thompson returned from his injury with 28 points, he was harmless in the fourth quarter and his team quiet. \u201cThey\u2019ve been aggressive all series in trying to take space away from me and Klay,\u201d Curry said. As the Warriors and the crowd disappeared from the arena, there was a sense of finality in the air inside Oracle. If the Warriors don\u2019t win Monday, then the last memory of their home of nearly six decades will be a deflating one. Instead of dreamy visions of Curry and Thompson and Durant spraying jumpers, it will be Leonard punishing the Warriors and the home team powerless to stop him or from being pushed to the brink. And speaking of Durant: Coach Steve Kerr has now gone radio silent about his superstar\u2019s availability for Monday or beyond. The subject has become tiresome because there\u2019s no resolution regarding someone who hasn\u2019t played in a month. And so the Warriors have twin motivations for Monday: Win to stay alive and also to play once more at Oracle for a Game 6. Yet at this point, with the dynasty showing cracks, that might be a lost cause. \u201cI know we\u2019re capable,\u201d said Kerr. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of talent and got a lot of pride and these guys have been to The Finals five straight years for a reason. They\u2019re going to fight the whole way.\u201d Green added: \u201cI\u2019ve been on the wrong side of 3-1 before, so why not make our own history?\u201d Well, that now-or-never talk is fine. Yet it\u2019s all about the Raptors making history now, and stopping the Warriors\u2019 streak in the process. It\u2019s all there for the taking for Toronto: One win, a chance to celebrate on the home floor, and a marvelous and striking professional rebound for Kawhi Leonard, who surely will be named Finals MVP should all of the above happen. Dare we say, it\u2019s the Raptors title to lose now. A title anointed to the Warriors even before the season began. Well, plenty has happened in the last seven months. And especially the last seven days. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years. You can e-mail him  here , find his archive here  and follow him on  Twitter  .

And they\u2019ll have that chance because they\u2019re now 3-0 at Oracle Arena this season after an impressive 105-92 victory in Game 4 of The Finals on Friday. Kawhi Leonard led the way with 36 points, his eighth game with 35 points or more in these playoffs. His 17 points in the third quarter are tied for the fourth most he\u2019s scored in any quarter in his career. The Raptors also got a big game off the bench from Serge Ibaka (20 points, two blocks) and key contributions from Pascal Siakam and Kyle Lowry. One stat stood out from the rest as the Raptors took a 3-1 series lead with the series heading back to Toronto for Game 5 on Monday (9 ET, ABC). 96.8 \u2014 Points per 100 possessions scored by the Warriors in Game 4. That\u2019s the Warriors\u2019 least efficient offensive game by a wide margin in the playoffs (the previous low was 107.2). It was also their third-least efficient performance in 26 total Finals games over the last five years. This was an ugly game on both ends of the floor for much of the first half. At the break, both teams had scored less than a point per possession, combining to shoot 4-for-30 from 3-point range. But Toronto had a huge third quarter, scoring 37 points on 23 possessions (the most efficient quarter for either team in this series) and the Warriors just couldn\u2019t keep up. For most of the night, Toronto forced the ball out of Stephen Curry\u2019s hands or at least forced him into tough shots. Curry scored 27 points, but shot just 2-for-9 from 3-point range and 9-for-22 overall. Klay Thompson returned from a one-game absence and made 6 of his 10 3-point attempts on his way to 28 points. But the other eight Warriors that played were 0-for-8 on 3s, and the lack of attempts was just as damaging as the fact that none of those eight attempts went in. Turnovers were another issue. In fact, the Warriors committed four of them (all live balls) on their first six possessions of the game. DeMarcus Cousins managed four turnovers by himself in less than 15 minutes of playing time. With 19 total turnovers on Friday, the Warriors now have 15 more turnovers than the Raptors in the series. Golden State actually shot better than Toronto in Game 4, but turnovers and free throws were the difference. While the Raptors shot 23-for-24 from the line, the defending champs made just 14 of their 21 attempts. That\u2019s tied for their third-worst free throw shooting game of the season (102 total games). The Warriors had the No. 1 offense in the regular season , scoring a record 114.9 points per 100 possessions. And through their first 19 games of the postseason, they had been even more efficient, scoring 115.5 per 100 . Even without Thompson in Game 3 (when their defense was the problem ), they scored efficiently enough (109 points on 99 possessions) to win. But now, through four games, they\u2019ve been held to 107.2 points per 100 possessions in The Finals by what has been an elite defense. In each round of these playoffs, the Raptors have held their opponent to at least seven fewer points per 100 possessions than that team scored in the regular season. And right now, the Warriors are having their least efficient series since the 2016 conference finals (106.9). They came back from a 3-1 deficit in that series. To do the same in this one, they\u2019ve got issues to fix on both ends of the floor.

Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Magic Johnson, Kevin McHale, Isiah Thomas, Kyrie Irving, Kevin Love and others all had championship trajectories altered by Finals injuries. Then there was Willis Reed, perhaps the granddaddy of them all, who limped out and inspired the Knicks in the 1970 Finals . Measured against such a rich, regrettable tradition of contusions, sprains and stars in street clothes, these Finals will claim their rightful spot. Injuries have dominated the narrative from Toronto to California, with the plot thickened now by recoveries both imminent and undetermined. Golden State guard Klay Thompson (hamstring) will play in Game 4 , returning from a costly one-game absence. But forward Kevin Durant (calf strain) will not , despite speculation fueled by none other than coach Steve Kerr. The two-time Finals MVP has been dialing up his individual work but was not cleared to scrimmage 3-on-3 by Thursday. Meanwhile, big man Kevon Looney (costal cartilage fracture) might not be done for in this series after all. Thompson\u2019s return was the most foreseeable, given the shooting guard\u2019s durability and stubbornness against missing games. He was straining at Kerr\u2019s and the medical staff\u2019s leash Wednesday, even as he understood their safe-rather-than-sorry approach. \u201cIt just sucks missing a Finals game,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cIt\u2019s the NBA Finals and this is what we work our whole lives for. But I would rather miss one game than an entire series. So, it wasn\u2019t the end of the world.\u201d hompson, who had played in 120 consecutive playoff games prior to skipping Game 3, sat and watched from the Warriors\u2019 bench as Toronto won at Oracle Arena to take its 2-1 lead. The experience made him hungrier still to return to the fray. \u201cI think I can impact Game 4 by doing what I do \u2014 that\u2019s getting buckets and getting stops,\u201d said Thompson, who is averaging 23 points per game in The Finals and is one of Golden State\u2019s best defensive players.  \u201cJust being able to guard their guards out there. They looked comfortable yesterday,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cThey were playing in great rhythm. So it makes you mad. You want to get out there and stop them.\u201d Durant presumably wants to get out there and score, at least. He has not played since May 8 and missing a month of the postseason has some fans impatient for Durant\u2019s return (and others convinced he won\u2019t return at all). Kerr acknowledged Thursday he might have contributed to the confusion, mistakenly fast-tracking Durant\u2019s recovery timeline when he spoke to reporters before Game 3 . \u201cThere was no setback,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cI was hoping that today would be the day when he couldget out on the floor. It\u2019s not going to be today. It\u2019s going to be probably tomorrow, the following day, the next couple of days. So the hope would be that he could still make it back at the end of the series.\u201d Game 5 is Monday at Toronto\u2019s Scotiabank Arena ( 9 ET, ABC ), and Game 6 (if needed) is Thursday at Oracle ( 9 ET, ABC ). Kerr said he \u201cprobably misspoke\u201d when he suggested Durant might play Friday. \u201cI\u2019m getting asked a million questions every day,\u201d Kerr said, \u201cand so sometimes I might answer something that doesn\u2019t jibe perfectly with what the training staff saw that morning.\u201d Looney? The lanky and mobile 6-foot-9 big man averaged 10 ppg and shot 78.3 percent in the Western Conference finals . He had nine points in Game 1 of The Finals before suffering the non-displaced fracture to his upper chest in Game 2 . Golden State misses his defensive versatility and his offense near the rim. But Kerr said his initial comments to reporters, based on views Looney was done till next season, needed clarification. \u201cWe\u2019re gathering information, a second-opinion type thing, and so it\u2019s sort of open,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cIt\u2019s an open question. We are looking at all of our options and his options.\u201d The Warriors can maintain stiff upper lips and repeat the NBA\u2019s \u201cnext man up\u201d mantra. In truth, though, certain players stepping up or going down matter more than others. Thompson is seen as a scorer Toronto must contain and a defender who can contain one or more Raptors. The Warriors are 11-3 since 2014-15 when Thompson returns from a layoff. \u201cAdding Klay back to the fold is always going to make a difference,\u201d forward Draymond Green said, \u201cthe way Klay pressures the ball, the way he flies around on the defensive end.\u201d Said Stephen Curry, whose 47 points in Game 3 wound up almost like a rope-a-dope tactic by Toronto: \u201cPeople fall in love with his shooting and how hot he can get on the offensive end, but the way that our team plays defensively and the chemistry that we have and the experience. He\u2019s right at the forefront of that.\u201d While it\u2019s possible that Durant still might come limping through a tunnel to seize this championship series, he remains a long shot until he does it. None of the Warriors who talked about him Thursday anticipates a lengthy re-introduction. Until then, this is a team of changing roles and jumbled rotations. Kerr has used 10 different starting lineups in this postseason, the most since the league began tracking that in 1971. \u201cIt\u2019s tough from a rotational standpoint,\u201d veteran Shaun Livingston said, \u201cGuys coming in at different times. Yeah, it definitely throws a kink in it.\u201d Said Curry: \u201cIt\u2019s a tough adjustment when guys who haven\u2019t been in that position consistently and in these type of moments are thrown into his minutes.\u201d The Raptors, having already swiped back homecourt advantage, have the chance to grab a commanding 3-1 series lead. That would make Game 4 potentially the last one Golden State plays at its boisterous old barn before moving into Chase Center in San Francisco next season. Certainly, Kerr would prefer his \u201cA team\u201d get most of the playing time. But he has embraced a more relaxed view of the challenges thrown Golden State\u2019s way. \u201cIt just feels like business as usual, honestly,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope that doesn\u2019t sound arrogant, but the benefit of having been through five years of this is we have literally seen everything. \u201cWe have lost a 3-1 [Finals] lead in a heartbreaking fashion. We have come back from 3-1 down. We have had to win a Game 7 on the road . We have been without Steph Curry for a series. We have been without Kevin Durant. We were without Klay [Wednesday.] Our opponents have been without key players. \u201cSo I think the key is, and our guys know this because they have been through it before, you just zero in on the next game. You make your adjustments and you win the next game, and all of a sudden everything shifts and the whole narrative changes.\u201d * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

But the Raptors still had their third most efficient game of the postseason \u2014 featuring the two most efficient quarters of this series \u2014 because they shot so well. The Raptors\u2019 effective field goal percentage of 62.8 percent in Game 3 was their best mark of the playoffs . And it was their shooting from the outside that was the big difference. On shots from outside the paint, the Raptors had an effective field goal percentage of 66.3 percent, their best mark of the playoffs (their previous high was 58.1 percent in Game 6 of the Eastern Conference finals). They were 7-for-11 from mid-range and 17-for-38 from 3-point range. Tracking stats doesn\u2019t show that the Raptors\u2019 Game 3 shots from the outside were necessarily better than the ones they got in the first two games of the series. Second Spectrum data shows there was a Golden State Warriors defender within four feet of the shooter on 25 percent of the Raptors\u2019 Game 3 jump shots, the same exact rate as there were through the first two Finals games. Only 60 percent of the Raptors\u2019 Game 3 jump shots were off the catch, down from 68 percent through the first two games. The Raptors also had the same exact number of drives ( 48 ) as they had in both Games 1 and 2 . Whether they\u2019ve been healthy or not, the Warriors have not played consistently good defense in this postseason. Statistically, though, Game 3 was their worst defensive game since Game 5 of the first round against the LA Clippers. The film agrees with the numbers. A lot of the Raptors\u2019 open jump shots were a result of preventable defensive breakdowns from the Warriors, who were playing without Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant and Kevon Looney \u2014 \u201cthree of our top five or six defenders,\u201d according to Draymond Green. Some of the breakdowns were certainly related to their absences. \u201cWhen you change the lineups and you\u2019re without some key guys,\u201d Warriors coach Steve Kerr said Thursday, \u201cnow you\u2019re ending up with five guys on the floor who generally haven\u2019t played together a whole lot. And so I think that while the effort was there, the execution was not.\u201d The first breakdown came from Stephen Curry. After the Raptors\u2019 first three scores came via one-on-one play, Curry stood flat-footed as the ball was swung to Danny Green in the left corner.               \u201cI let him get open for a three in the corner without really making him feel my presence at all,\u201d Curry said Thursday. \u201cAnd shots like that for a great shooter just build confidence, and he fed off of that the rest of the game.\u201d Green would go on to shoot 6-for-10 from 3-point range, including 4-for-6 from the corners . Two of Green\u2019s other corner 3-pointers came via transition feeds from Kawhi Leonard. The first of those was about numbers: Andrew Bogut needing to protect the rim and Andre Iguodala unable to ever get in front of Leonard. Late in the third quarter, though, Alfonso McKinnie had a chance to stop the ball, but Leonard froze him with a hesitation and forced Draymond Green to help off Danny Green in the strong-side corner \u2026               \u201cYou can\u2019t leave Kawhi Leonard,\u201d Danny Green said. \u201cYou leave him, you look kind of silly. Most of my shots were due to pace and us moving the ball.\u201d Leonard\u2019s tendency to hold on to the ball when he was double-teamed was an issue for the Raptors in Game 2. But he made some quicker decisions in Game 3. \u201cWhen you draw multiple defenders, do your best to get off it,\u201d Raptors coach Nick Nurse said. \u201c[On Wednesday], he did a better job of getting off it a little earlier and it helped us.\u201d In the half court, pick-and-roll defense was a consistent issue for the Warriors. Midway through the first quarter, with Marc Gasol setting a screen for Leonard, Bogut called for an \u201cice\u201d coverage \u2014 one where the ball-handler\u2019s defender (Green) put himself between the ball and the screener to prevent his man from getting to the middle of the floor.                But Bogut\u2019s own positioning left too much space for Leonard to make a pocket-pass to Gasol, who slipped to the rim for a dunk.               Credit Leonard for making that read, but the Warriors made it to easy on him. On a pair of Leonard\/Gasol pick-and-rolls in the second quarter, Bogut positioned himself higher\u2026               On the first of those, Leonard was forced into a slower, tougher pass\u2026               Two possessions later, Leonard tried to split the defenders and turned the ball over . But the Warriors had other issues in the pick-and-roll, specifically with screener\u2019s ability to contain the ball. Late in the first quarter, Leonard blew by Jordan Bell for a dunk \u2026 Early in the second period, Serge Ibaka approached Shawn Livingston to set a side screen for Kyle Lowry. Livingston iced the pick and called for DeMarcus Cousins to cut off Lowry \u2026               But Cousins was far out of position and unable to stop the ball. Lowry\u2019s drive drew help from Iguodala out of the opposite corner, Quinn Cook wasn\u2019t able to guard both weak-side shooters, and Fred VanVleet drained another open corner 3-pointer \u2026               \u201cOur pick-and-roll coverage needs to be cleaner,\u201d Warriors assistant coach Jarron Collins said on Thursday. \u201cThere were definitely some things on the tape to clean up.\u201d The Warriors also had some gambling issues, leaving guys open by trying for steals. In the first quarter, a Cousins gamble led to another layup for Gasol \u2026               In the second quarter, Draymond Green read the play, but then left Lowry open for a three by reaching in on Leonard\u2026 And in the fourth quarter, more over-help from Green (when Bell was staying in front of Pascal Siakam) led to another Lowry 3-pointer . The Warriors plan to have Thompson back for Game 4 , but his return doesn\u2019t guarantee better defense. Golden State defenders getting smoked in one-on-one situations \u2014 see Siakam vs. Jerebko or Gasol vs. Cousins \u2014 wasn\u2019t even noted above. But maybe the desperation of the situation \u2014 a loss would put the Warriors down 3-1 with Game 5 in Toronto \u2014 is just what the Warriors need. \u201cI just think our best basketball is usually played when our backs are against the wall,\u201d Draymond Green said, \u201cwhether that\u2019s in a series, whether that\u2019s in one particular game.\u201d Overall, the Warriors just haven\u2019t been nearly as good a defensive team as they\u2019ve been in any of the four previous postseasons. But they\u2019re not done yet. \u201cI think that we\u2019ve stepped up and made plays [defensively] when we absolutely needed to,\u201d Collins said. \u201cThere are stretches where we are really locked in and we can change a game with our defense.\u201d They\u2019ll absolutely need one or more of those stretches in Game 4. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

( AP ) \u2014 Toronto guard Kyle Lowry wanted the Golden State Warriors\u2019 executive who shoved him during an NBA Finals game ousted from the league. The NBA decided a one-year ban and $500,000 fine is enough for now. Mark Stevens, a Warriors\u2019 investor and a member of the team\u2019s executive board, was banned from the NBA for one year and fined Thursday \u2013 one day after he shoved Lowry during the fourth quarter of Game 3 of the Toronto-Golden State finals matchup. The NBA announced its decision not long after Lowry said Stevens \u201cshouldn\u2019t be a part of our league.\u201d \u201cMr. Stevens\u2019 behavior last night did not reflect the high standard that we hope to exemplify as an organization,\u201d the Warriors said in a release. \u201cWe\u2019re extremely disappointed in his actions and, along with Mr. Stevens, offer our sincere apology to Kyle Lowry and the Toronto Raptors organization for this unfortunate misconduct.\u201d Lowry dove into a row of courtside seats in an effort to save a loose ball. Stevens, wearing an NBA-issued credential, was seated about two spots away from where Lowry landed. Stevens shoved Lowry in the upper body, and Lowry said he repeated a vulgar phrase to him about four times during the brief incident. The incident, and the fallout, was the dominant story on the off day between Games 3 and 4 of the series, which resumes Friday. \u201cIt sucks that this has to take the front page of the finals,\u201d Lowry said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a fun finals. It\u2019s been a competitive finals. It really sucks that this has to take part and had to be a part of it.\u201d Warriors players and coaches lauded the way Lowry was able to keep his emotions in check, and many followed their team\u2019s statement and offered apologies to both the Raptors and their point guard. \u201cObviously, when you see the video, it\u2019s pretty clear who was in the wrong,\u201d Warriors guard Stephen Curry said, who added that he doesn\u2019t personally know Stevens. It\u2019s unclear how large a stake Stevens has in the Warriors, and if the team will allow him to remain part of the organization. The team\u2019s media guide lists Stevens \u2013 a Silicon Valley billionaire \u2013 as a member of the six-person executive board. \u201cA team representative must be held to the highest possible standard and the conduct of Golden State Warriors investor Mark Stevens last night was beyond unacceptable and has no place in our league,\u201d NBA spokesman Mike Bass said Thursday. Lowry said Stevens has not reached out to him to apologize. \u201cI don\u2019t know him. I don\u2019t care to know him,\u201d Lowry said. \u201cHe showed his true colors at the time. And you show what you\u2019re really about in that time and at that moment. \u2026 No, you showed what you really are.\u201d Lowry scored 23 points in Toronto\u2019s 123-109 victory . The Raptors lead the series 2-1 going into Friday\u2019s Game 4 at Oracle Arena. Thursday\u2019s series of events began with an apology from the Warriors and an announcement that Stevens would not be allowed at any more games in this series. Players like Los Angeles Lakers standout LeBron James said that wasn\u2019t enough, and James reached out to Lowry personally to offer his support. Hours later, the NBA came out with the decision to fine and ban Stevens. The NBA\u2019s ban covers all league games and also forbids Stevens from being part of any team events. \u201cIf Kyle was to then hit back, a lot more than a fine would have then happened to Kyle,\u201d Warriors forward Draymond Green said. This was not the first high-profile incident between players and fans this season. Oklahoma City\u2019s Russell Westbrook was involved in at least two such scenes during the regular season, one of them leading to a fan\u2019s permanent ban from all events at the arena the Utah Jazz call home. Westbrook reacted angrily after he said a fan at a Utah game made racist comments to him, and the league fined Westbrook $25,000 for responding in a vulgar manner. Westbrook also was touched by a young fan who was seated courtside at another game, and reacted calmly. While not a player-fan exchange, New York Knicks owner James Dolan made headlines when a fan at Madison Square Garden told him to \u201csell the team\u201d in an incident that was captured on video. Dolan told the fan he was rude, asked if he wanted to come to any more games and then told him to \u201cenjoy watching them on TV.\u201d And earlier in these playoffs, Raptors fan Drake actually massaged Toronto coach Nick Nurse\u2019s shoulders during play \u2013 to the dismay of the league. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said the league has \u201credoubled\u201d efforts to make sure that fans understand what conduct is appropriate and what isn\u2019t. \u201cWe have had lots of conversations directly with the players\u2019 association, the players, because absolutely we want them to feel that they\u2019re in a safe environment,\u201d Silver said last week in Toronto when the NBA Finals were beginning. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t want them to be distracted during the game or think that they have to take matters into their own hand.\u201d But Raptors star Kawhi Leonard said more needs to be done. \u201cWe have to do a better job, the NBA, just of making sure these fans don\u2019t come in and think they can just touch guys and hit them,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cThat\u2019s a little extreme.\u201d Lowry said fans who sit inches from the sideline or baseline should understand that they may get in on the action. Dwyane Wade famously fell on entertainment icons John Legend and Chrissy Teigen as they sat courtside for his final home game with the Miami Heat two months ago; luckily in that case, all three parties could laugh about it afterward. This was no laughing matter, and the Raptors were stunned to learn that Stevens was part of the Warriors\u2019 organization. \u201cI was shocked,\u201d Toronto guard Danny Green said. \u201cAnd a little appalled.\u201d"},{"id":33310,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nba-nbpa-warriors-kyle-lowry-mark-stevens-official-release","date":"2019-06-06","title":"NBA bans Mark Stevens for one year, fines him $500K","content":"The NBA and the Golden State Warriors today announced that Warriors investor Mark Stevens has been banned from attending NBA games and Warriors team activities for one year and has been fined $500,000 for pushing and directing obscene language toward the Toronto Raptors\u2019 Kyle Lowry during Game 3 of The Finals last night.

However, the Warriors were not about to jeopardize Thompson\u2019s availability for the rest of the series with a potential hamstring tear.

He spent time on the bench in warm-up gear and was stretching and staying warm on the off chance Kerr would put him in the game. \u201cHe was giving it everything he had to be out there tonight. But I think wisdom prevailed in terms of this is potentially a seven-game series,\u201d Warriors guard Stephen Curry said. \u201cYou would like to take advantage of tonight, but his overall health is important in terms of not taking away the rest of the series with something catastrophic happening.

With 47 points, eight rebounds and seven assists, the Warriors point guard became only the ninth man to score at least 45 points in a Finals game. The lesson in that? Curry learned for a night what it has felt like for LeBron James on many such occasions. James put himself on that specific list a year ago when he logged 51 points, eight board and eight assists against Curry\u2019s team in Game 1 , same court. Like Curry, James\u2019 team lost that night as well. Struggling mightily in something of a one-against-five predicament is the sort of things James has done often, while Curry never had faced it during Golden State\u2019s five-year run to The Finals. They both \u2014 James in the past and Curry on Wednesday \u2014 had legit NBA players around them. But the responsibility to put up points fell in both cases mostly on their shoulders. This was even a chance to revisit the 2015 Finals MVP selection, which attracted some attention on social media Tuesday over bogus speculation about the voting process. Andre Iguodala won the award that June , getting seven votes from the panel of media reps to James\u2019 four. Curry got no votes. The point was, Curry had as a single game Wednesday what James had as an entire series in \u201915. He averaged 35.8 points, 13.3 rebounds and 8.8 assists, scoring 38.5 percent of Cleveland\u2019s points (215 of 561) while assisting on 52.7 percent of his teammates\u2019 baskets while he was on the court. Now Curry is the guy in position, if Golden State loses the series, to get a few MVP votes in a losing effort. By the way, Jerry West is the only player to win the Finals MVP trophy in a losing effort . And West is one of the nine to score 45 or more \u2013 he did it three times, but his Lakers teams went 1-2 in those games. (The others: Michael Jordan three times, Bob Pettit, Elgin Baylor, Rick Barry, Wilt Chamberlain and Allen Iverson once each. Their teams all won on their big scoring nights.) It\u2019s tempting to say that the Warriors\u2019 attack is in broken-record mode, except the resurgence of vinyl might not be sufficient yet to bring that phrase back into the mainstream. So we\u2019ll go with a cultural reference that\u2019s more classic than archaic. Think of The Beatles\u2019 \u201cRevolution 9,\u201d but substitute \u201c109\u2026 109\u2026 109\u2026\u201d Yeah, it\u2019s been about as monotonous and unsatisfying for Golden State as it was on the White Album. At least Warriors coach Steve Kerr was somewhat bemused by his team\u2019s scoreboard consistency. In each game of these Finals, Golden State has scored 109 points. \u201cI just knew we were going to score 109 points because that\u2019s all we\u2019re going to do the rest of this series,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cSo if we\u2019re going to keep scoring 109, we got to keep them to 108.\u201d The Warriors kept Toronto to 104 points in Game 2. Some of that was to their credit, some to the Raptors\u2019 misfires and mid-game chill. The simplest stat? Toronto launched 38 3-pointers in both games. The night the Raptors made 11, they lost. When they made 17, they won. Getting Thompson back for Game 4 could make a big difference there. He is one of Golden State\u2019s best defenders. For that matter, Durant\u2019s length could assert itself as a defensive weapon, too, if he comes back in Friday\u2019s Game 4 ( 9 ET, ABC ) or later in the series. As for 109 being a winning points total, here is some background: taken in isolation, averaged over a full Finals, that would have been plenty to win 19 of the past 20 championships. The lone exception? In 2017, when Cleveland averaged 114.8 ppg yet lost because Golden State was putting up 121.6 nightly. In 2018, the Warriors averaged 116 points to the Cavaliers\u2019 101. The only other times a Finals team in the past 20 years averaged within five points of 109 were the Spurs in 2015 (105.6) and in 2007 (104.4) and the Lakers in 2002 (106.0) and 2000 (104.8). Obviously, a few of those were in the game\u2019s relative \u201cdark ages\u201d for use of the 3-ball, but all four won championships. The Warriors are scoring enough points to win. DeMarcus Cousins called his decision to sign with Golden State for a cut-rate contract, while rehabbing from an Achilles injury, his \u201cchess move.\u201d He wound up joining the defending champions and favorite to three-peat, and got his game back in time to contribute. Cousins subsequently suffered a quadriceps injury but returned in time to participate in The Finals. Only thing is, he looked like he was back playing checkers in Game 3. The Warriors center stood out Sunday, scoring 11 points with 10 rebounds, six assists and two blocks. But those numbers drooped to four points, three boards, three turnovers and 1-for-7 shooting in Game 3. Cousins went from plus-12 impact in Game 2 to minus-12 Wednesday. The big man looked a step slow and appeared to be bothered by Toronto\u2019s length, in the forms of Marc Gasol, Pascal Siakam and Serge Ibaka. With little lift these days, he\u2019s playing a little smaller than his 6-foot-11, 270-pound specs. And given how long he was off and the mere eight minutes he got in Game 1, what Cousins did in Game 2 was starting to look more adrenaline-fueled than a reliable return to form. Since Curry handled just about everything else for Golden State in Game 3, he was asked afterward about Cousins\u2019 \u201cregression.\u201d The point guard handled the awkward moment well \u2014 being asked a critical question about a teammate might have tempted Curry to blow it off or lie. Instead, he talked of the Warriors\u2019 shared responsibility on defense and noted a few calls offensively that didn\u2019t go Cousins\u2019 way. Then Curry added: \u201cLike any great player, if you have a rough game, that resiliency to bounce back and the confidence to know that you can still go out there and impact the game, that\u2019s something that he\u2019ll bring, and we all will follow suit for sure.\u201d Understandably, when an All-Star and potential Kia MVP candidate gets traded, the deal becomes all about him. Next, folks focus on the key player or players swapped out and how the move might work for the other team. Only then do we play much attention to the guy or guys accompanying the All-Star to his new destination. That\u2019s how it\u2019s been for Danny Green for much of the 2018-19 season. Green and Kawhi Leonard were teammates in San Antonio for seven seasons. They went to two Finals together with the Spurs, winning rings in 2014. But when Leonard wanted out after an injured and rancorous 2017-18, the deal the Spurs put together with Toronto shipped out Danny Green, too . >> Shaq\u2019s Pregame Advice For Green The reality of NBA trades is that salaries must match up, so teammates often become collateral damage to even up the dollar sufficiently to satisfy league rules. Sometimes, a teammate is thrown into a deal because he and the star are chums. A familiar face gives the featured guy some comfort \u2014 or someone to carry his bags. But Green was a helpful playoff performer in his own right with the Spurs \u2014 in his 12 Finals games before this year, he had made 52 percent of his 3-pointers. And in 2013 he made 27 of them against the Miami Heat, a Finals record that was his for all of three years until Curry drained 32 in 2016. Green struggled with his shot in the Eastern Conference finals against the Milwaukee Bucks, going 4-for-23 on 3-pointers. But his marksmanship early in Game 3 and against near the end of the third quarter propelled the Raptors\u2019 victory. Toronto dominated on the offensive glass 15-6 in Game 2 and lost . Golden State dominated on the offensive glass 13-5 in Game 3 and lost . Typically, that\u2019s a positive category for the team that wins it, something coaches hate when the other guys are reclaiming their own misses time and again. But lately, the demerits associated with offensive rebounds have loomed larger than the benefits. You grab a shot you or your teammate missed, that ought to be a good thing. But the Raptors in Game 2 (37.2 percent) and the Warriors in Game 3 (39.6 percent) were beset by inaccuracy, so there were more offensive rebounds to be had, period. The other down side of a generally positive stat is how you go about getting them. If you get overeager and the defense controls the errant shot, you might denude your transition defense. Both the Raptors and the Warriors in Games 2 and 3 respectively built considerable edges in second-chance points off their offensive rebound totals. Toronto had a 23-0 scoring advantage Sunday, yet lost by five. Golden State held it 23-12 Wednesday, yet lost by 14. The losing team in both cases slightly won the battle of fast-break points, but offensive-rebounding strategy still forces a choice on teams. \u201cWe have a general kind of rule of thumb that once a shot goes up, we tell our guys to make a really quick, good decision,\u201d Raptors coach Nick Nurse said before Game 3. \u201cEither they\u2019re going hard to the offensive rebound or they\u2019re going hard to defense transition. \u2026 There\u2019s certain moments of the game \u2013 I mean, some of those late are almost scrambles, right, you\u2019re behind five and you\u2019re throwing it up there and everybody\u2019s trying to rebound, just to keep the game alive as well.\u201d It\u2019s a stat worth watching, even if it\u2019s inversely related lately to the games\u2019 outcomes. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

But as of now I literally have zero motivation to go work out.\u201d Hard work and diligence marked Nowitzki\u2019s playing career, as he finished his career as the highest-scoring foreign-born player in NBA history (31,560 points). The league\u2019s 2007 MVP and 2011 NBA Finals MVP worked hard to be one of the best players in the NBA in his prime and was well known for his signature one-legged fadeaway jumper.  In retirement, though, Nowitzki has been living it up off the court \u2014 and not just in what he eats. He threw out the first pitch in the Texas Rangers\u2019 home game Wednesday night against the Baltimore Orioles. He was the guest of honor at an FC Dallas soccer game in May, getting to place a scarf around the neck of the statue of Lamar Hunt before the match and was later honored on the field. He also scored on a penalty kick during a halftime ceremony. Before attending the Rangers game, Nowitzki and his family had just returned on Tuesday from vacationing in the Caribbean and at Disney World.

Current and former Mavs players \u2014 such as Michael Finley, Shawn Marion, Courtney Lee and others \u2014 will be playing in the game as will Mavs owner Mark Cuban. Additionally, Dallas Cowboys stars Dak Prescott, Ezekiel Elliott and others from the team will suit up, too. After spending the past two seasons dealing with injuries and ankle surgery last April, Nowitzki has been enjoying this relaxing pace of life. \u201cI was ready for it,\u201d Nowitzki said, regarding retirement. \u201cThis season was tough for me. I\u2019ve moved on. \u201cI haven\u2019t worked out once yet in (almost) two months. I played a little bit of tennis, but I haven\u2019t really seen the inside of a gym, so that\u2019s different.

I love sweets, ice cream, I love desserts. I\u2019ve tried all sorts of junk food already. \u201cMy body\u2019s not really used to it, so it\u2019s been catching up with me a little bit.\u201d Nowitzki, who will turn 41 on June 19, is awaiting what the next phase of his life will bring. \u201cI want to get away for a year or two and travel and enjoy the family,\u201d said Nowitzki, who turns 41 on June 19. \u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019s another challenge out there waiting for me.

In many ways, the last two months have been a microcosm of that quest. Since the 6-foot-4 Davis played his last game for Ole Miss in March, his odyssey has included making the all-tournament at the Portsmouth Invitational, barely claiming a spot in the G League Elite Camp, playing well enough there to be invited to the NBA\u2019s Chicago Combine, and then crisscrossing the country for workouts with league teams. Golden State and Boston have asked him back for command performances, underscoring his rise up draft boards and bringing him a step closer to his goal of making an NBA roster. Some people who know Davis best have no doubt he\u2019ll accomplish that goal. \u201cI know one thing,\u201d says Kermit Davis, who took over at Ole Miss in 2018 and coached Davis for just one season. \u201cTD is going to know exactly what his job is [in the NBA]. It doesn\u2019t matter what role they put him in, he\u2019s going to accept it. That\u2019s a big part of his success. He\u2019s going to live in the gym and hang on every word they say. There\u2019s no doubt he\u2019s talented enough to play in the NBA.\u201d Basketball has always been Terence Davis\u2019 first love. He started playing the game at age six, and though he later became a star high school football player in his native Mississippi who was good enough to earn 20 scholarship offers from power conference schools, he decided basketball was the sport he would pursue in college. \u201cWhen I made that decision, there was a lot of backlash from people I knew, people I grew up with,\u201d Davis says. \u201cMy high school coaches all thought I was going to choose football. A lot of people did. I was a 6-4 wide receiver with long arms and huge hands who could catch everything that came my way. Why wouldn\u2019t I play football?\u201d The answer to that question lies in some advice Davis\u2019 father gave him: Don\u2019t take the easy way out. Football came so naturally to his son that Terence Davis, Sr. viewed playing that sport in college as less of a challenge than basketball. So when former Ole Miss coach Andy Kennedy offered a scholarship, Davis\u2019 choice was clear. Then came his freshman season, during which he played in 19 games and averaged 6.9 minutes and 1.9 points. \u201cAfter I didn\u2019t play much my freshman year, I thought, did I choose the wrong sport?\u201d Davis says. \u201cWere people right about football? Did I make a mistake?\u201d That self-doubt quickly gave way to a moment of clarity. \u201cIt was gut check time for me,\u201d Davis says. \u201cI couldn\u2019t let all those people [who thought he should play college football] be right. I\u2019m going to put all my time and effort into basketball.\u201d Kennedy\u2019s advice to Davis was to become what the coach called a \u201cball getter.\u201d \u201cI told him if he was going to get better, he had to become versatile,\u201d Kennedy says. \u201cGo get a steal. Block a shot. You ought to be able to guard people 5-11 to 6-7. Be efficient. Be active. His activity level is what eventually separated him.\u201d In Davis\u2019 sophomore season, he was one of the most improved players in the country, tacking 13 points onto his scoring average. During a three-game stretch against Auburn, LSU and Arkansas, he averaged 27.7 points. In an NIT game at Syracuse, Davis delivered 30 points on 6-for-7 3-pointers in an upset Ole Miss victory. Davis\u2019 production fell back as a junior as Kennedy, who had spent 12 seasons turning Ole Miss into a respectable program, struggled to get his team untracked from a puzzling losing streak and decided to resign midway through the 2017-18 season. Kennedy was replaced by Kermit Davis, a stickler for the game\u2019s basics. \u201cWe all knew he could score, and that he was a great athlete,\u201d Kermit Davis says. \u201cWe talked about him being an elite defender. I thought he could be one of the best rebounding guards in the country. He did that and more. He improved in every area, just continuing the progress he\u2019d made under Andy.\u201d Davis finished second on his team in scoring (15.2) and led the Rebels in rebounding and assists. He was second in steals and blocks and shot a career-best 37.1 from 3-point range. Most important, Davis helped lead Ole Miss to the NCAA tournament. It was a fitting end to a career that justified his decision to bypass football. The days since Davis\u2019 college career ended have not been dull. After mulling over the decision to attend the Portsmouth Invitational with his agent, Adam Pensack, Davis eventually decided to go and show the attending NBA personnel what he could do. Davis made the all-tournament team, saving his best game for the last day of the competition. \u201cHe finished with a bang,\u201d Pensack says. \u201cBut unfortunately, by the last day of Portsmouth, a lot of scouts typically are gone. No one was there to see it.\u201d That could explain why Davis didn\u2019t get an invitation to the G League Elite Camp.  \u201cWhen the official list came out and I wasn\u2019t on it, I\u2019m not gonna lie, I was kind of hurt,\u201d Davis says. \u201cI looked at that list and thought to myself, \u2018I know there are guys on here that I\u2019m better than.\u2019 \u201d Undaunted, Davis ramped up his workout regimen. And Pensack bombarded Wesley Harris, the NBA\u2019s director of basketball operations, and Harris\u2019 G League counterpart Steve Neff with texts and emails. Pensack isn\u2019t sure why, but eventually Davis was extended an invitation to the G League Camp. Davis graduated from Ole Miss on May 11 and the next day headed for Chicago, where he gained more admirers. \u201cA lot of teams said he was the best player there,\u201d Pensack says. Davis\u2019 play earned him a spot in the Chicago Combine, where he again played well. On the second day of scrimmages, he scored a camp-high 19 points. Since then, he\u2019s worked out for seven NBA teams; six more workouts are set between now and Draft day, and Boston and Golden State have asked to see him a second time. Barring a trade, the Celtics have three first-round picks. Golden State, which could use a scorer off the bench, has the No. 28 pick. Could Davis\u2019 play during the last two months have vaulted him into the first round? \u201cThat wouldn\u2019t surprise me at all,\u201d Kermit Davis says. \u201cHe lives in the gym. He\u2019s spent countless hours in there, by himself. He worked his tail off in practice. Right now, he\u2019s getting what he deserves.\u201d Kennedy, who spent last season as a broadcaster, has fielded several calls from NBA teams about Terence Davis. \u201cMainly stuff like, is he a responsible kid, is he a mature kid,\u201d Kennedy says. \u201cYou can\u2019t bring in a 22-year-old still working on maturity issues.\u201d Kennedy answers those questions in the affirmative. And he\u2019s added some extra input. \u201cHe\u2019s tough enough,\u201d Kennedy says. \u201cHe\u2019s an NBA player. You can put him in an NBA practice today and he\u2019s going to compete and be fine. If he were 6-7, it would be a no brainer. At 6-4, his skill level is not quite at the elite level. He\u2019s got to be able to make that up in other ways.\u201d Davis has been working on that. \u201cI think his skill level is maybe a little bit undervalued,\u201d says Ole Miss assistant coach Ronnie Hamilton. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s a point guard per se, but he can play with the ball in his hands. We gave him the responsibility to read the defense and make plays for us. He\u2019s got a good enough basketball IQ and feel to be a combo guard.\u201d Davis also thinks he can defend in the NBA. \u201cThe main thing I want to show teams is I can be a defensive guy,\u201d Davis says. \u201cI can be a 3 and D guy, but for me, the D comes before the 3. If I want to play at the next level right away, that\u2019s got to be my main focus.\u201d Regardless of how Davis\u2019 journey ends, his story could serve as a blueprint for future undervalued NBA prospects seeking to barge their way onto a roster. \u201cIf I were telling guys like that what they could learn from my story, I\u2019d just say, always believe in yourself,\u201d Davis says. \u201cYou know more than anyone else what you\u2019re capable of doing. For me, just putting my head down and going to work has brought me a long way.\u201d * * * Chris Dortch is the editor of the Blue Ribbon College Basketball Yearbook .

In his 10 seasons, Green has made 40.4 percent of his 3-point attempts. No less than 61 percent of the shots he has taken have been from behind that arc. Legendary big man Shaquille O\u2019Neal, on the other hand, played 19 seasons in the NBA and made just one 3-pointer in 22 attempts . That\u2019s a success rate that looks like Green\u2019s \u2014 if you move the decimal point: 0.45 percent. In the playoffs, Green has been his deep-threat self, adding another 229 3-pointers with 40.2 percent accuracy. Shaq? Nope. In 216 games across 17 postseasons, the big man never put up a single 3-pointer . So naturally, O\u2019Neal was the perfect guy to advise Green Wednesday on the whys and wherefores of the long ball. \u201cHe\u2019s a pure shooter,\u201d Green said, teasing, when the question was put to him after the game. Turns out Green and O\u2019Neal crossed paths on the court at Oracle Arena in the minutes before the Raptors\u2019 123-109 victory in Game 3 of The Finals . O\u2019Neal was working his broadcast gig. Green was eager to snap out of a shooting slump that had him at 33.8 percent in Toronto\u2019s 20 playoff games till then (32.8 percent from the arc). \u201cEvery time I see him, he\u2019s giving me his pure shooting advice, because he was good at it,\u201d Green said. \u201cJust the fundamentals, the small things, telling me to be confident and just hold the follow-through. And obviously after a good shooting night, it\u2019s easy to see that his advice has worked.\u201d O\u2019Neal and Green were teammates on the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2009-10 , which was O\u2019Neal\u2019s penultimate NBA season. At the time, Green was the Cavs\u2019 second-round pick and a little-used player on the team. Since then, Green has emerged as a fantastic 3-point shooter, shining in that role with the San Antonio Spurs from 2010-18. In a postgame segment on NBA TV, O\u2019Neal explained some of what he said to Green \u2013 who he called his \u201crookie\u201d \u2013 before Game 3. In fact, fellow NBA TV analysts Chris Webber and Kenny Smith were ready to give O\u2019Neal full credit for the Raptors\u2019 win. \u201cWhat I saw about Danny when I was in Cleveland, he was a guy who didn\u2019t get a lot of playing time but practiced hard,\u201d O\u2019Neal said in a pregame segment on NBA TV. \u201cI told him I played with a lot of shooters. I\u2019m not going to tell you how to mess with your shot because I\u2019ve never been a shooter.\u201d O\u2019Neal then talked of former shooters he played with or against \u2013 Dennis Scott, Jeff Turner, Peja Stojakovic, Rick Fox \u2013 who always held their shooting form after every shot, regardless of how they were shooting percentage-wise. Then, O\u2019Neal shared some of what his pregame chat with Green entailed. \u201cI just brought him over here because I saw him messing around in warm-ups,\u201d O\u2019Neal said. \u201cI said \u2018hey man, this is The Finals. Leave it and stop f-ing around. Get your game right.\u2019 \u201d If it wasn\u2019t O\u2019Neal\u2019s pregame counsel, it might have been the message written on the white board in Toronto\u2019s dressing room: \u201cLet it rip.\u201d The scribbler was unknown in the minutes soon after the game, but multiple Raptors took the advice to heart. Guard Kyle Lowry hit five of his nine 3-pointers, Fred VanVleet made half of his six attempts and the Raptors collectively were 17-of-38 (44.7 percent), beating Golden State at the phase of the game the Warriors popularized. Toronto had trailed, 25-24, in 3-pointers through the first two games. But this night, the visitors outscored them from the arc by 15 points. No one did more in that area than Green. All 10 of his shots came from behind the line, and he drained six of them. He got three of them on four attempts in the first quarter, helping Toronto to an early lead in their 36-point quarter. Then Green hit three more late in the third quarter. The first two came on consecutive possessions after Golden State had closed to 83-75; quickly, the Raptors were up by 14 again. Finally, in a Toronto possession fraught with peril, a save by Kawhi Leonard turned into leaning three to beat the shot clock and make it 96-80.  \u201cDanny\u2019s buckets I think boosted our whole team\u2019s confidence,\u201d Toronto coach Nick Nurse said, \u201cbecause we\u2019re kind of used to most of the year relying on those. When he banked a couple there and kind of kept it going, it was just a huge confidence boost all around.\u201d In the fourth quarter, Green missed his last two 3-point shots. But he knows he has a Big Shot Doctor he can always consult. \u201cListen, this is The Finals and he hasn\u2019t been playing well,\u201d O\u2019Neal said on NBA TV after Game 3. \u201cWe all know what he can do. When he was with the [San Antonio Spurs\u2019] system, [Spurs] coach [Gregg] Popovich was me. \u201cI just want everybody to play at a high level. I saw him messing around and it kind of upset me. I pulled him to the side \u2013 he\u2019s out there laughing and joking. When you\u2019re shooting 20 percent, there ain\u2019t no laughing and joking.\u201d * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

As for hobbled All-Star forward Kevin Durant, Game 4 may mark his return to the lineup as well. The two-time defending champion Warriors fell, 123-109 , and again trail the Toronto Raptors 2-1 in the best-of-seven series. There was a hint of good news after that Game 3 loss as Warriors coach Steve Kerr sounded hopeful Thompson would play in Friday\u2019s Game 4 ( 9 ET, ABC ). \u201cThe good thing is Klay has done well the last two days,\u201d Kerr said, per Mark Medina of The Mercury News . \u201cNow he has a couple more days to heal, and hopefully he\u2019ll be out there on Friday.\u201d Additionally, Tim Kawakami of The Athletic said Kerr told him that he expects Thompson to play in Game 4. Thompson\u2019s status remained uncertain three days after he sustained a mild left hamstring strain. He had been listed as questionable for Game 3 and was evaluated by the training staff before tipoff. Thompson did some running and shooting earlier in the day but Kerr said the Warriors weren\u2019t going to play him \u201cif there\u2019s risk.\u201d \u201cThe whole point was to not risk a bigger injury that would keep him out of the rest of the series. So that was the decision we made, and I feel very comfortable with it,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cI never would have forgiven myself if I played him tonight and he had gotten hurt. So you live with the decision you make. You make a wise decision, the wisest one you can, and then you live with it and move forward.\u201d As for Durant, Kerr said before Game 3 that the two-time Finals MVP is on pace to participate in some 3-on-3 scrimmages on Thursday. Durant has been out of the lineup since he strained his right calf on May 8 in Game 5 against the Houston Rockets in the Western Conference semifinals. \u201cHe had a really good workout [Tuesday],\u2019\u2019 Kerr said, per Marc Berman of the New York Post . \u201cRamped it up, and it went well. He had another one [Wednesday]. It went well. So we would like to increase it [Thursday], meaning get other people involved. He hasn\u2019t played any three-on-three, five-on-five. \u201cWe probably won\u2019t practice as a team. It will be a film session and a walkthrough. So if possible, we\u2019ll get him together with some of our young guys, maybe a few of our coaches and try to get him out on the floor. That would be the next step. He\u2019s got to continue to improve and not have any setbacks. That\u2019s the main thing. So we\u2019ll go from there.\u201d Thompson had appeared in all of a possible 120 career playoff appearances, but saw veteran guard Shaun Livingston start in his place Wednesday night. However, the Warriors were not about to jeopardize Thompson\u2019s availability for the rest of the series with a potential hamstring tear. The Warriors will practice on Thursday and Thompson plans to compete in more shooting drills and running exercises that will test his ability to change directions, per Mark Medina of The Mercury News . He\u2019ll likely go through the same set of drills on Friday morning and may have to complete a pre-game warmup on Friday (for precautionary reasons) before the Warriors sign off on him playing in Game 4, Medina reports. Despite being ruled out for Game 3, the Warriors officially listed Thompson as active. He spent time on the bench in warm-up gear and was stretching and staying warm on the off chance Kerr would put him in the game. \u201cHe was giving it everything he had to be out there tonight. But I think wisdom prevailed in terms of this is potentially a seven-game series,\u201d Warriors guard Stephen Curry said. \u201cYou would like to take advantage of tonight, but his overall health is important in terms of not taking away the rest of the series with something catastrophic happening. So hopefully he\u2019s back for Game 4.\u201d Thompson is averaging 19.5 points, 4.0 rebounds and 2.1 assists this postseason, including 23 ppg in The Finals.

Is Klay Thompson\u2019s tweaky hamstring a go? Will this be the day Kevin Durant finally shakes that lingering calf strain and suits up? The hints and subtle signs seem to point toward the positive for Golden State. Thompson was a late scratch Wednesday night because the Warriors \u2014 with a mixture of confidence and arrogance and concern \u2014 felt the guard missing Game 3 was perhaps best for his recovery without proving deadly in the long run. Durant is still \u201cramping up\u201d his workouts per Warriors coach Steve Kerr, and so his status has been upgraded to \u201cstay tuned.\u201d It has become must-watch after a 123-109 loss . Yet if the answer is negative to all of the above, the next entry on the medical report might be the grim health of the dynasty built by these two-time defending champions. Their still-under-construction monument now teeters, prone to a nudge from the Toronto Raptors. The Warriors find themselves down 2-1 to the Raptors, lacking any guarantee they\u2019ll see two of their three leading scorers back in the lineup Friday for Game 4 ( 9 ET, ABC ) \u2026 or for however long this series lasts. Thompson joined Durant on the sideline, and the Raptors (as could be anticipated) pounced on the gift to seize control of the series. It was a game the Raptors had to win, and they did. The production came from multiple players, with Kyle Lowry finally making an imprint on this series and Danny Green rediscovering his long-lost 3-point touch . Meanwhile, the Warriors consisted of Stephen Curry \u2026 and not much else. The two-time Kia MVP dazzled, fighting through traps and triple-teams all night while tapping into his shot-making wizardry to drop a playoff career-high 47 points. But the short-handed Warriors were doomed when Draymond Green and DeMarcus Cousins in particular were underwhelming on a night they needed to be stellar. As a result, the atmosphere inside Oracle Arena was flatter than most of the shots taken by Curry\u2019s teammates. This was partly due to the introduction of the starting lineups, when Thompson\u2019s name wasn\u2019t announced. The fans knew then, officially, that their eyes and the home team were in for a long night. While the Warriors fought, scrappy doesn\u2019t win games at this point \u2014 not when the other team is good and opportunistic. Playing in a hostile building for the first time in The Finals, the Raptors made a collective decision to greet fire with fire. Or, as they wrote on the blackboard inside the visitor\u2019s locker room: \u201clet it rip.\u201d \u201cI think we all kind of followed that advice,\u201d said Raptors swingman Danny Green. \u201cWe hadn\u2019t really had a good team shooting night and I knew we were due.\u201d For Toronto, it wasn\u2019t just that they won, but that they did so with their most impressive outing in the series. The question now for the Raptors is: Will their inconsistent players use this outing to turn the corner and push the Warriors, even if Thompson and\/or Durant return? This is aimed, first and foremost, at Lowry. He took the \u201clet it rip\u201d plea personally. Entering this game, he had six baskets total in this series and at times suffered defensively. Challenged by a pregame talk from coach Nick Nurse, Lowry embraced his inner pit bull and was relentless all night. The All-Star point guard took 16 shots, making eight, for 23 points and nine assists while making his presence felt for the first time in The Finals. \u201cFor me, it was just not being so passive and trying to get everyone else involved and get myself going and let everyone else feed off that,\u201d Lowry said. He and Green re-introduced the 3-pointer to the Raptors\u2019 offense. The two shot 11-for-19 and repeatedly stole whatever momentum Golden State could generate by responding with timely long-distance daggers. After making five 3-pointers total in his last five playoff games, dreadful was the only way to describe Green\u2019s last three weeks of shooting in the playoffs. He has only one job: Stand in the corner and shoot open 3s. He\u2019s made a career of that. So what do the Raptors make of Green shooting 6-of-10 from deep Wednesday? In the short term, it helped win Game 3. In the big picture, will this confidence carry over from one night to another, or does it depend on whether Green hits his first few? Nurse said: \u201cDanny\u2019s buckets boosted our whole team\u2019s confidence because we were used to relying on those most of the year.\u201d With better production from players who had been mostly missing, the Raptors had the balance needed to deliver their highest-scoring and most efficient (52 percent shooting) game of the series. Green and Lowry joined Kawhi Leonard (30 points), Pascal Siakam (18) and Marc Gasol (17) in taking turns pummeling the Warriors from all different directions and manners. One reason for this was Thompson\u2019s absence. Not only is he a proven outside shooter, but his defense is top-notch as well. You could even argue that Thompson\u2019s missing defense was just as costly as his jumper. Yet the 109 points Golden State did manage were mainly because of Curry providing nearly half the offense. Given the circumstances of being without Thompson and Durant, and the constant pressing by Toronto whenever he had the ball, this was Curry\u2019s finest postseason effort. His shooting was superb all across the floor, making 3-pointers (six) and free throws (13-14) and in general (14-31). \u201cIt\u2019s The Finals,\u201d Curry said. \u201cYou give everything you\u2019ve got, sacrifice your body when you have the opportunity. Just competitiveness and trying to play until the buzzer.\u201d \u201cHe does things that honestly I don\u2019t think anyone has done before,\u201d Kerr added. \u201cThe way he plays the game, the way he shoots and the combination of his ball-handling, it\u2019s incredible to watch.\u201d If only he had someone riding shotgun. Cousins was sloppy on both ends, with three turnovers and one basket, and a step slow on defense against Gasol. This came after he seemingly regained his legs and confidence in a Game 2 victory. Green\u2019s continued recklessness was mystifying as he often made questionable decisions as a playmaker. He registered four turnovers and once again struggled to contain Siakam. The Warriors needed Green\u2019s best, but received something less. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to be more solid with the ball and it starts with me,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve had a bunch of turnovers in every game of this series. I think if I played better with the night (Curry) had, we would have won.\u201d And so the Warriors, while talking bravely about their next-man-up mentality and embracing their \u201cStrength in Numbers\u201d slogan, must realize, deep down, that preventing the Raptors from winning two more games with a handicapped team might be difficult, if not impossible. Keep in mind that Golden State hasn\u2019t sparkled for four quarters since the first game of the Western Conference finals. The last three games of that series, and the first three of the NBA Finals, the Warriors trailed by double digits. Thompson has an off day and Friday\u2019s pregame period for therapy on his hamstring, although such strains are unpredictable and tricky. Will he be able to cut and fight through screens and be bouncy for 35-plus minutes through the intensity of an NBA Finals game, or will the injury restrict him and cause Kerr to seek a healthier, yet less productive replacement? \u201cThe whole point was to not risk a bigger injury that would keep him out the rest of the series,\u201d said Kerr, explaining a decision made in consultation with the team doctors. \u201cI feel very comfortable with it. I never would have forgiven myself if I played him and he had gotten hurt. So you live with the decision you made. The good thing is Klay has done well the last two days; hopefully he\u2019ll be out there Friday.\u201d Then there\u2019s Durant, who last played May 8. After doing nothing but individual drills the last few days, he\u2019ll go through a more normal practice session that will be simulated with the help of some assistant coaches and bench players. They\u2019ll see how Durant holds up. But that won\u2019t match the stress level of a real game. And even if Durant gets clearance for Game 4, he hasn\u2019t played in roughly a month. What about his timing? His wind? His touch? His ability to bring the same energy on defense? All legit questions and concerns for the Warriors \u2014 until they\u2019re not, whenever that is. \u201cNo one cares if guys are hurt,\u201d Green said. \u201cEveryone wants to see us lose anyway. So I\u2019m sure people are happy they\u2019re hurt.\u201d Chances are that basketball fans, even if they\u2019re against the Warriors, want to see stars on the floor this time of year. That\u2019s what the NBA Finals is always about: Premium players doing premium things, or failing to do so, and letting the championship odds rise or fall on their performances. This year\u2019s Finals have been denied one star for every game, and an additional star for one game. The battle with star attrition finally cost the Warriors a postseason loss, and at the worst possible time. The flow of the remainder of the NBA Finals, then, could rest with aching tendons and muscles and the recovery powers of those who own them. \u201cWe\u2019re missing 50 points with KD and Klay, but we\u2019ll adjust,\u201d said a confident Curry. \u201cIt\u2019s a long series, you know. It\u2019s going to be fun for us.\u201d The next Warriors medical update will arrive Thursday afternoon. And another one Friday just prior to tipoff. All along, the Warriors have led everyone to believe that it\u2019s only a matter of time before they\u2019re fully healthy. But will it be in time? And even then, will it be enough against a Toronto team suddenly thinking big? * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

Taking advantage of the absences of Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant, the Raptors trailed for only 16 seconds of Game 3 of The Finals and outlasted the Golden State Warriors for a 123-109 victory on Wednesday. The Raptors survived a career playoff-high 47 points from Stephen Curry , in part because Warriors not named Curry shot just 37 percent, including 10-for-37 (27 percent) from outside the restricted area . One stat stood out from the rest as the Raptors took a 2-1 series lead and regained home-court advantage in the series, with Game 4 at Oracle Arena on Friday (9 ET, ABC) 36 \u2014 Points scored by the Raptors in both the first and third quarters. The third \u2013 36 points on 24 possessions (1.50 per) \u2013 and first \u2013 36 points on 25 possessions (1.44 per) \u2013 are the most efficient offensive quarters for either team in this series so far. The Raptors came out hot, scoring 19 points on their first 11 possessions of the game, with all five starters putting points on the board. And with Kawhi Leonard getting to the line and Danny Green hitting a couple of big threes, it didn\u2019t matter that Curry was going bonkers on the other end of the floor, and the Raptors led by seven after the opening period. And after a relatively ugly second quarter on both ends of the floor (47 combined points on 51 possessions) the Raptors had another huge quarter coming out of halftime. It was the end of the quarter where they did their most damage, scoring 18 points over an eight-possession stretch, with Green (three more 3-pointers) and Leonard (four more free throws) combining for 16 of the 18 . With another efficient stretch (17 points on 10 possessions) in the fourth quarter, the Raptors led by as many as 17 points before holding on for a 14-point win. They finished with 123 points on 99 possessions (124.2 per 100), the most efficient game the Warriors have allowed in 13 Finals games at Oracle Arena over the last five years. The Raptors did have an extensive drought in the second quarter, scoring just once on a span of 14 possessions. But the Warriors only managed to cut seven points off the lead over those seven minutes, and the Raptors still managed to win the period. In fact, they won all four quarters on Wednesday and have now won 10 of the 12 quarters in the series. In Game 3, the Raptors had six players in double-figures for just the third time in their 21 playoff games. Leonard led the way with 30 points (including 15 in the third quarter), but he had plenty of help. Kyle Lowry scored more points (23) than he had in Games 1 and 2 combined (20). He was 7-for-12 from outside the paint, with a couple of big jumpers in the final period. Green finished 6-for-10 from 3-point range, and his 18 points were the most he\u2019s scored in these playoffs . The Raptors\u2019 17 total 3-pointers are tied for the third most in a Finals game in NBA history. You could make a strong argument that the Warriors missed Thompson more on defense than they did on offense. He was the Warriors\u2019 primary defender on Leonard in the second half of Game 2 before he suffered his strained hamstring. Draymond Green was Leonard\u2019s primary defender in Game 3 and looked like the best defender in the world at times. But other Warriors were a step slow (DeMarcus Cousins and Andrew Bogut each had trouble containing the dribble) or perhaps a few inches too short. With Thompson out, Quinn Cook played 27 minutes ( the most he\u2019s played in 31 career postseason games), and the Warriors\u2019 defense was at its worst (allowing 75 points on 56 possessions) with Cook on the floor. Of course, Thompson was healthy for Game 1, when the Raptors also scored more than 120 points per 100 possessions. After scoring just 106.8 points per 100 over the last two rounds (when they counted on their defense to win most of those games), they\u2019ve scored 116.2 per 100 in The Finals .

Since then, the Celtics have been looking ahead to a summer that could mark some key changes to a contending roster. Team president Danny Ainge addressed the media in Boston today and touched on a variety of topics on the minds of fans, particularly the future of coach Brad Stevens, the looming free agency of star guard Kyrie Irving and the contract future of center Al Horford. Ainge, who suffered a mild heart attack in early May , said he is feeling better since then and that his role with the team will not change in the wake of it. As for Irving, NBA free agency rules forbid players and teams from working on deals until the free-agent moratorium is lifted on June 30 at 6 p.m. Ainge told reporters that he is in a position most Celtics fans are with Irving: a wait-and-see mode. When asked by reporters about Irving\u2019s exit interview with the team after the playoff loss to Milwaukee, Ainge said, \u201cIt was good.\u201d Reporters then asked Ainge about Irving, who can opt out of his contract this summer and become an unrestricted free agent. Last summer, Irving seemed to guarantee he would re-sign with the Boston Celtics , but later backtracked on that stance in early February. Ainge followed up those comments days later by drawing a parallel between Irving\u2019s summer comments and his February comments to an \u201cengagement\u201d of sorts with the Celtics (that could become a \u201cmarriage\u201d once the moratorium lifts). On Wednesday, Ainge was mostly mum about whether or not Irving will be back in Boston come the 2019-20 season. \u201cI don\u2019t know, I mean, there\u2019s not much I can say about that, honestly. But there\u2019s ongoing conversations. We\u2019ll just have to wait and see what happens there,\u201d Ainge said. When asked if there were any indication from Irving\u2019s camp that he does not want to come back to Boston, Ainge said that was not true. \u201cI have not received that indication, no,\u201d Ainge said. Irving is coming off a stellar season in which he averaged 23.8 points per game and a career-best 6.9 assists per game while shooting 48.7 percent from the floor and 40.1 percent on 3-pointers. He was named to the All-NBA Second Team (his second All-NBA nod in his career), adding to a career that includes an NBA championship, an All-Star game MVP, a Kia Rookie of the Year Award and six All-Star appearances. Ainge says he doesn\u2019t blame Irving for Boston failing to meet expectations and does not regret pulling off the blockbuster trade with the Cleveland Cavaliers two summers ago that netted him. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that one person gets credit or blame for team\u2019s failures,\u201d Ainge said. \u201cWe had a lot of reason why the team did not succeed this year. Kyrie deserves his share of the blame, but not more than anybody else. There\u2019s a lot of guys that didn\u2019t handle things the right way and make the sacrifices that needed to be done for the benefit of the team. I think they\u2019re all going to learn from it, including Kyrie. \u201cThere\u2019s always risk in making deals. We\u2019re not afraid of risk. We made a risk by trading for Kyrie. No matter what happens with Kyrie, I\u2019ll never regret that. Just move on to the next deal.\u201d As for Horford, Ainge said he expects to meet with him to discuss restructuring the big man\u2019s contract. Horford has one max-season left on his current contract and, like Irving, holds a player option this summer on his deal. Ainge called contract restructuring talks with Horford a priority this summer. Ainge also squashed talk of Stevens\u2019 future being anything but solid with Boston as well, saying that he is \u201cthe least of our worries.\u201d Stevens has amassed a 270-222 record in his six seasons as Celtics\u2019 coach, but the earlier-than-expected playoff exit had some wondering if his future with the the Celtics was in doubt. \u201cThere\u2019s no other coach I\u2019d rather have than Brad. \u2026 I think he\u2019s going to be a lot better because of the year we had, he\u2019s the least of our worries,\u201d Ainge said. Lastly, Ainge also discussed two other players on the Celtics: guard Terry Rozier and forward Gordon Hayward. Rozier voiced his complaints about the Celtics and their roster in separate interviews on a pair of ESPN television shows. In short, Rozier \u2014 an unrestricted free agent this summer \u2014 said he didn\u2019t want to come back to the Celtics if the roster remained the same as it was last season. In response to Rozier\u2019s recent comments, Ainge said Wednesday: \u201cI\u2019m a big fan of Terry\u2019s. I don\u2019t always agree with how everybody handles the media. But I\u2019m a big fan of Terry\u2019s. If Terry was in the right circumstance and the right role, I think he would love playing in Boston.\u201d Hayward, currently the team\u2019s highest-paid player, is coming off his first healthy season since suffering a gruesome injury in his first game with the Celtics in 2017-18. He played in 72 games (his most since 2016-17 with the Utah Jazz), averaging 11.5 ppg, 4.5 rpg and 3.4 apg in mostly a reserve role for Boston. He got off to a solid start in the first round of the playoffs against the Indiana Pacers, averaging 12.3 ppg, 5 rpg and 1.8 apg in 31.1 minutes per game. However, he struggled considerably in the East semis with averages of 7.4 ppg, 3.2 rpg and 3 apg in 28.4 mpg. Ainge defended Hayward while also lauding the offseason work he has put in to gear up for 2019-20. \u201cI\u2019m really excited for Gordon\u2019s upcoming season,\u201d Ainge said. \u201cHe\u2019s working hard. He\u2019s here every day with five or six coaches. He\u2019s put a lot of time in and I\u2019m anticipating great things from Gordon this next year. I don\u2019t really look at it as fading in the Milwaukee series. I look at it as opportunity. I\u2019m not worried about Gordon Hayward. I\u2019m not worried about his future or how good of a player he is. If he doesn\u2019t become the player he wants to be, it won\u2019t be from a lack of trying.\u201d Last season, the Celtics won 55 games and came within a victory of reaching The Finals with Irving and Hayward both sidelined with injuries. The reintegration of both underscored shortcomings that included moments of infighting that culminated with the Celtics winning only 49 games and finishing fourth in the East. Since then, a pivotal offseason regarding the future of Irving and Horford \u2014 as well as those for key reserves Rozier and Marcus Morris \u2014 continues to hang over the team. Stevens said in early May it was clear that expectations weighed on not only Irving, but the entire team. \u201cThere\u2019s no question. They have TVs. They have phones. They hear everything,\u201d Stevens said in May. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of pressure to live up to all these expectations, to put on a cape. to do all those things. And that\u2019s hard to do.\u201d Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":33391,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/raptors-defense-game-3-preview","date":"2019-06-05","title":"Raptors' defense in question ahead of critical Game 3","content":" * Tonight on ABC:   Game 3, Raptors vs. Warriors (9 ET) OAKLAND, Calif. \u2013 The Toronto Raptors already regret what they didn\u2019t get done against the Golden State Warriors in Game 2 of the The Finals . Squandering an even better opportunity in Game 3 might crash their confidence completely. That\u2019s how the game Wednesday night at Oracle Arena was setting up, with Golden State\u2019s list of injured players growing. Center Kevon Looney is done for the series with a costal cartilage injury to his upper chest. Forward Kevin Durant has been ruled out in his recovery from a calf strain (he might be able to play in Game 4). Guard Klay Thompson is famously resilient, but his status with a hamstring pull won\u2019t be known until close to tipoff. All of which means the Raptors might not get a better chance to beat the defending champions on their home court than this one. The flip side of that, though, is pressure not to fail. The Warriors might start getting healthier as the series goes on, and the Raptors \u2014 who fell into a funk when they got outscored 18-0 in the first six minutes of the second half Sunday, and could find a half dozen plays they could have executed better in the 109-104 loss \u2014 could soon take another dose of regret right into summer. That\u2019s why, understandably, they weren\u2019t about to raise the expectations further. Just a greater height from which to fall if it doesn\u2019t go their way. \u201cI think we come into a sense of urgency, period,\u201d Toronto\u2019s Kyle Lowry said. \u201cNo matter the situation. We want to be the first to four, and every game is an urgent game \u2026 They still have professional basketball players down there.\u201d Speaking of professional, a lot of questions directed at the Raptors on Tuesday dwelled on the novelty defense coach Nick Nurse deployed only briefly in the fourth quarter Sunday. The box-and-1 is more likely to be seen in college or high school competition. Comments from both sides on the off day ranged from praising Nurse for having the guts to try the box-and-1 (to contain Stephen Curry, mostly) to implied eye rolls over a strategy that doesn\u2019t seem NBA-worthy, never mind NBA Finals quality. Golden State coach Steve Kerr credited the tactic for achieving its goal briefly, but got laughs when he talked about facing it as a ninth-grade player. Nurse explained his decision, which at least showed a willingness to innovate as needed and to think, er, outside the box. \u201cWe were having trouble getting our defense set up,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were having trouble at the basket a little bit. We were having trouble with the rhythm of the game there. \u201cWe played some zone during the regular season, and usually you do it when the game is funky and there\u2019s a bad rhythm and maybe you can change it just by slowing them down or stopping some of their cutting or whatever. It seemed to protect the rim better for us and stop some of their cutting. And it was good. I don\u2019t know, I was just trying to come up with something to stop them.\u201d When Kawhi Leonard was asked if he thinks that strategy could work for stretches moving forward, he rolled off a \u201cprobably not.\u201d \u201cKlay definitely wasn\u2019t on the floor at that time,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cThere\u2019s no telling when KD\u2019s going to come back either, so I don\u2019t think it will work.\u201d Said Lowry: \u201cSometimes when your coach draws something up, you just kind of go with it.\u201d The Warriors did get stuck on 106 points for five minutes late in the game, until Andre Iguodala\u2019s 3-pointer with 5.9 seconds left , and Curry was unusually ineffective in the fourth quarter. That \u2014 and the memory of the monstrous scoring drought before and after halftime (a 24-1 stretch) \u2014 had several Raptors more concerned about their team\u2019s offense than its defense. They scored 14 fewer points in the second game, a decline blamed on poor shooting, not enough transition baskets and a reluctance in some cases to take shots that presented themselves, shrinking in the moment. \u201cOur defense has been pretty solid for most of the year,\u201d veteran guard Danny Green said. \u201cIt\u2019s not been the problem for us. For us, it\u2019s offense. The reason why our defense, I guess, has had some lulls is because the offense has been bad in terms of turning the ball over or getting bad shots, which doesn\u2019t allow the defense to get set.\u201d Lowry had a hot mess of a Game 2, fouling out deep into the fourth quarter. Fred VanVleet has been a force off Toronto\u2019s bench, his minutes dialed up by Nurse in response. Green, familiar with The Finals setting from his time with San Antonio, feels he can do better than his 44 percent shooting and 9.5 ppg. He almost needs to, because he\u2019s the one Kerr has used Curry on, allowing his valuable point guard to coast some defensively. Can the Raptors make Curry work harder on that end? \u201cWe have done a decent job,\u201d Green said. \u201cWe could obviously do better. I think the biggest key is to continue to chase him and try to keep him off the free throw line. He\u2019s got a ton of free throws [22 of 23 so far] that we shouldn\u2019t allow him to get. Play him without fouling him. \u201cBut on our end of the floor offensively, we could probably do a better job.\u201d * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

They\u2019ll be occupied by Game 3 of The Finals \u2026 and Game 1 of Kevin Durant\u2019s rehabilitation. The two go hand-in-hand, actually, and hold equal importance. With untimely injuries threatening to delay the Warriors\u2019 third straight title or downright prevent it from happening, the club teeters on edge, unsure whether its next step will be on the gas pedal or a banana peel. Klay Thompson is iffy for Wednesday because of a gimpy hamstring that cut short his floor time in Game 2, which the Warriors managed to win anyway. He did some light shooting on the eve of Game 3 against the Raptors and, Klay being Klay, counted himself in after three days\u2019 rest. But it\u2019s not really up to him, is it? The Warriors\u2019 medical staff will make the ruling on a tendon that\u2019s moody and doesn\u2019t always cooperate with the human attached to it. This all depends on what side of the bed the hamstring lands on Wednesday morning. Kevon Looney, the fast-developing big man who has been a pleasant playoff surprise, is done for the summer with a cartilage fracture in his collarbone area. At least in this case, his loss is minimized by the re-emergence of DeMarcus Cousins, back from two months off with a bum quad muscle and feeling frisky about it and his encouraging effort in Game 2 . OK, now here\u2019s the elephant in the emergency room: What does the future of The Finals hold for Durant, MIA for roughly a month now, who has been ruled out for Wednesday ? Durant didn\u2019t practice with the team Tuesday morning, but he did go through an individual workout that afternoon. There is no scheduled team practice on Thursday, the only off-day between Games 3 and 4 at Oracle Arena. Yet all signs point to Durant putting his body through a workout\/practice\/scrimmage at some point between now and Friday\u2019s Game 4 because coach Steve Kerr said the former MVP is \u201cramping up\u201d his workouts . It\u2019s safe to say the Warriors will be interested spectators for that one, biting their fingernails to the knuckle, although Kerr indicated Durant\u2019s availability for The Finals is more \u201cwhen\u201d than \u201cif.\u201d That means Durant has given them some reason to feel optimistic about Friday if not Game 5 in Toronto. \u201cKlay and Kevin, we\u2019re very hopeful we\u2019re going to get them back out there,\u201d Kerr said. In a worst-case scenario, the Warriors in Game 3 would be without two players averaging more than 50 points combined in the postseason, and their scoring and defensive presence is impossible to replace. That would put them in a tough spot, needing to rely on replacements who aren\u2019t familiar with, or quite capable of, carrying that amount of minutes with impact. Yes, it\u2019s true the Warriors finished Game 2 without either player and managed to win. Yet, no disrespect to the champs, that\u2019s a big chore to do for four full quarters and against a solid defensive team like the Raptors. Even if Thompson plays, will he be healthy enough to supply the energy and flexibility needed to perform his usual top-notch defense and running through screens for his jumper? \u201cIf I can just be out there even at 80 percent, I still think I can be very effective,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cFrom the progress I\u2019ve made these last two days, I\u2019m very encouraged that I\u2019ll be able to go out there. As long as nothing is torn or really injured, I\u2019m not too fearful of it because, knock on wood, I\u2019ve been very blessed with not very many traumatic injuries in my career. I don\u2019t think this one is of greatest concern. It\u2019s just the day and age we live in where little things can just grow to be big problems, but I don\u2019t think this will be one of them.\u201d How would a diminished or missing Thompson affect the Warriors? Basically, Stephen Curry could not afford to be anything less than MVP-ish. He\u2019d see double-and triple-teams thrown his way by the Raptors, causing him to take tougher shots than normal. In that situation, as the Warriors\u2019 only volume scorer and shooter, Curry could feel overwhelmed and force the issue. Cousins would be required to ratchet up his shooting and intensity on offense, but will he stay clear of foul trouble, which would put a crimp in his playing time? Finally, the Warriors would lean more on Shaun Livingston, Draymond Green, Andre Iguodala and Quinn Cook than normal. Cook made a pair of important shots in Game 2 after Thompson limped off and could be an X-factor (or at least he\u2019d need to be for Golden State\u2019s sake). \u201cOur team is very adaptable,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cWe have a lot of versatility. What it requires is bench players being ready to step up, like they always are, and guys just playing hard and playing together. I think you have to be fearless, too, which our team is. You can\u2019t worry about anything. You just go out there and play and compete and let it fly and whatever happens, happens.\u201d And then there\u2019s Toronto. A weakened or missing Thompson would be an opportunity they simply couldn\u2019t afford to blow. Rarely does a gift like this present itself in The Finals and the Raptors must seize it if it happens. In such a situation, the Raptors would be wise to occupy Curry and dare others to produce for four quarters. If Thompson plays, they\u2019d be best to take advantage by running him ragged through screens on defense, putting that hamstring to the test. That would be one less player with high defensive credentials for Kawhi Leonard to deal with. Assuming that scoring will be an issue for the Warriors, the Raptors must get a bounce-back game from Pascal Siakam (who regressed from 32 points to 12) and more punch from Kyle Lowry ( six baskets total for the series ) to make it tough if not impossible for the Warriors to keep up. If the Raptors have any shot at winning this title, they must win at least one game at Oracle, and from a practical standpoint, Game 3 is the most inviting. They may never see the Warriors this vulnerable, this ripe for the taking again. \u201cI think we come into a sense of urgency, period,\u201d said Lowry, \u201cno matter the situation. We want to be the first to four, and every game is an urgent game. You\u2019re in the NBA Finals , so it doesn\u2019t matter. They still have professional basketball players down there, and they\u2019re really talented basketball players. So you still got to be ready to go out there and play your butt off and play hard.\u201d The Warriors do not feel the same level of urgency because they\u2019re not down 0-2, and the next two games are at home, and the core group is championship tested. As they demonstrated in Game 2 , they don\u2019t get rattled by tense championship games, even with Thompson and Durant off the floor. They also know, or at least feel strongly, that Thompson and Durant will suit up soon. \u201cIf there\u2019s pain, it will be a no-go (for Game 3) because of the position we\u2019re in,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cThis could be a longer series, so there\u2019s no point in trying to go out there and re-aggravate it and potentially keep myself out of the whole entire Finals instead of just one game.\u201d The Warriors might not get much sympathy from a basketball world that perhaps feel the champs are finally getting their just due. Everyone saw them play the 2015 Finals against the Cleveland Cavaliers without Kevin Love and all but one game without Kyrie Irving. In the 2017 Western Conference finals , Leonard, then with the San Antonio Spurs, went down after lighting it up for most of Game 1. And how can anyone forget Chris Paul missing the Houston Rockets\u2019 final two games of the 2018 West finals ? Not saying those were the reasons for three championships in four years; still, all of those misfortunes suffered by others favored the Warriors. But who\u2019s keeping score? \u201cThere\u2019s a certain amount of luck involved with this, and we know that,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cWe have been on both sides of that. Some of our opponents have suffered injuries. We have suffered injuries. It\u2019s just part of the deal. You just keep pushing forward.\u201d * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years. You can e-mail him  here , find his archive here  and follow him on  Twitter  .

While he is rooting for his best friend in Lowry, DeRozan feels he was the \u201csacrificial lamb\u201d in the Raptors reaching the championship series. In an interview with Taylor Rooks of Bleacher Report , DeRozan \u2014 now with the San Antonio Spurs \u2014 explained how he is pulling for his former team in The Finals . \u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t think I even said this \u2014 I probably said it to my own inner circle \u2014 but if it wasn\u2019t for all the years and groundwork that I did before then, none of them things would\u2019ve been possible,\u201d DeRozan said in the video interview. \u201cYes, I fought, I sacrificed, I pushed the limits to where I had to be the sacrificial lamb. \u201cYou just have to sit back and understand, like, you know, you are the reason so many things was even possible.\u201d DeRozan was dealt to the Spurs last summer in the blockbuster trade that sent Leonard to the Raptors. Toronto is tied 1-1 in The Finals with the Golden State Warriors and Game 3 of the series is tomorrow night ( 9 ET, ABC ). \u201cTo their credit, [the Raptors] probably felt like it was time to see what we could get to make that next jump,\u201d DeRozan said in the video interview. When asked if he was more upset or more hurt by the trade to San Antonio last summer, DeRozan knew his response right away. \u201cMore hurt,\u201d DeRozan said of his feelings about the trade, \u201cbecause, you know, being invested from 19 to \u2014 I was what, 28? Everything you learned was from there. Everything you gained was from there. \u201cSo for that to be gone like that, when you least expect it, it just throws you off guard. You know, we human at the end of the day, and it definitely hits you.\u201d Despite those feelings, DeRozan is pulling for Lowry, with whom he forged a deep friendship on and off the court in Toronto. \u201cI\u2019m rooting for my best friend to do well, to accomplish something that we tried to do all the years, and he has the opportunity to do it,\u201d DeRozan said. \u201cAll the guys on that team, they know I\u2019m rooting for them.\u201d In his first season with the Spurs, DeRozan averaged 21.2 points, 5.3 rebounds, 6.0 rebounds and 1.1 steals per game as San Antonio reached the playoffs and pushed the No. 2-seeded Denver Nuggets to Game 7. In speaking with Bleacher Report, DeRozan explained how much he has enjoyed playing for Spurs coach Gregg Popovich \u2014 while also sharing entertaining stories about Popovich\u2019s coaching techniques. \u201cPop is cool. He\u2019s like a Don Corleone. He makes you look at him not just like the basketball coach, but a great individual,\u201d DeRozan said. \u201cI called him the other day just to talk trash to him and \u2026 he\u2019s not good with working iPhones and all that. He hates technology with a passion. He always talks about how he\u2019s going to put something on Twitter knowing he ain\u2019t have a Twitter.\u201d \u201cHe calls it Twittergram. \u2018I\u2019m going to put something on Twittergram and see if they catch this,\u2019 \u201d DeRozan said. DeRozan shared how one of his most memorable experiences with Popovich came during a team film session, in which the coach showed the entire 2005 film, \u201cMarch of the Penguins.\u201d \u201cI remember one meeting, I thought we were going to watch film. He put on the \u2018Penguin\u2019 movie .. the whole thing,\u201d DeRozan said. \u201cThe whole point of it was how life is a full circle. As long as we work together, stick together and stay on the same track, we can accomplish the most impossible mission.\u201d Many doubted the Spurs would run their streak of consecutive playoff appearances to 22 in 2018-19 after an offseason filled with turmoil and roster turnover. A year ago, Leonard played in only nine games while nursing a right thigh injury. Reportedly upset with how his rehabilitation was handled, Leonard forced his way out of San Antonio in the offseason and was sent to Toronto along with Danny Green in a trade for DeRozan and center Jakob Poeltl. The Spurs also lost Manu Ginobili to retirement and Tony Parker left the team in free agency along with veteran Kyle Anderson. San Antonio had eight new players on its roster this season, the most in Popovich\u2019s tenure. That turned out to be one of the highlights for the veteran coach as the Spurs won 48 games and made the postseason. In one four-game stretch of the season, the Spurs lost three games by 30-plus points; in Popovich\u2019s first 1,758 regular-season games as coach, the Spurs had only lost by 30-plus five total times. Of course, they also won five straight games by 25-plus points for the first time under Popovich and ended up seventh in the Western Conference as DeRozan and veteran LaMarcus Aldridge helped carry the team\u2019s young roster. \u201cI think that when we all reflect on the season, they achieved a lot more than a lot of people gave them credit for having the opportunity to achieve,\u201d Popovich said in late April. \u201cIt\u2019s the beginning of a new culture for a new group. So, we\u2019ll have a little bit of corporate knowledge going into next season and they\u2019ll show that, I think.\u201d Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":33393,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/film-study-kawhi-crowd","date":"2019-06-04","title":"Film Study: Little room for Leonard to move in Game 2","content":" OAKLAND \u2014 The Golden State Warriors got what they needed out of their trip to Toronto. With their Game 2 victory, they took home-court advantage in The Finals from the Toronto Raptors as the series moves to Oakland for what could be the final two games at Oracle Arena. The Warriors are banged up. Kevon Looney is likely done for the season with a cartilage fracture in his chest, Klay Thompson is questionable for Game 3 with a strained left hamstring, and, as of Tuesday morning, Kevin Durant\u2019s status for Game 3 was unknown. But the champs are 45-8 in playoff home games over the last five years and they were able to put together one of their best defensive games of the postseason on Sunday. After the Raptors scored 118 points on 97 possessions in Game 1 ( their third-best offensive game of the postseason), the the Warriors held them to just 104 points on 101 possessions in Game 2. That was done with Toronto registering a playoff-high 23 second-chance points (so the Raptors scored just 81 points on their 101 initial offensive possessions). The Eastern Conference champions were bound for some regression. In Game 1, the Raptors shot a remarkable 15-for-23 (including 5-for-9 from 3-point range) in the last six seconds of the shot clock, according to Second Spectrum tracking. That was unsustainable and, indeed, they shot just 5-for-20 (0-for-6 from 3-point range) in the last six seconds of the shot clock in Game 2. If 43 shots in the last six seconds of the shot clock over two seems like a lot, well, it is. In the regular season, no team averaged more than 17.5 field goal attempts in the last six seconds. The Raptors averaged the fifth most, but that was just 14.3 per game. With better defenses and slower pace in the playoffs, that number was at 17.3 through the first three rounds. In this series, with the Raptors working their offense late into the clock even more, it\u2019s at 21.5 per game. While Toronto has 43 shots in the last six seconds of the shot clock, Golden State has just 16. On one hand, playing late in the clock slows the overall pace against an opponent that can hurt you in transition. In the regular season, the Warriors\u2019 effective field goal percentage of 64.2 percent in the first six seconds was the best mark for any team in any portion of the shot clock. On the other hand, playing late into the clock puts pressure on a team\u2019s offense. For every team in the league, effective field goal percentage is lowest in those last six seconds of the clock. In most instances, the Raptors would probably like to get something earlier in the clock. But getting a good shot early in a possession has proven to be difficult. The Raptors have been moving the ball. Their 330 passes in Game 2 were the most they\u2019ve had in a game since the first round (if you don\u2019t count the 349 they had in their double-overtime win in Game 3 of the conference finals ). But all those passes mean that Kawhi Leonard, the Raptors\u2019 best player and most efficient scorer, isn\u2019t getting his in-rhythm shots off the dribble, via pick-and-rolls or isolations. Leonard has been forced to give up the ball more than the Raptors would probably like. The Warriors have obviously been defending Leonard aggressively. The second defender on pick-and-rolls has generally stayed with Leonard until he has given up the ball. They\u2019ve doubled him in the post and even sent a second defender at him before he can get into an isolation situation. When Leonard has managed to get into the paint, he\u2019s been met by a crowd of defenders.               All that attention has resulted in a lot of trips to the line. He\u2019s drawn 22 fouls ( nine more than any other player in the series) and, with 28 free throw attempts in two games , Leonard\u2019s free throw rate (FTA\/FGA) in The Finals (0.824) is more than double his rate through the first three rounds (0.397). The attention should also result in some open shots just one or two passes away. But Leonard\u2019s teammates have attempted only 25 shots off his passes . That accounts for just 23 percent of the 108 shots his teammates have taken while he\u2019s been on the floor, a rate almost in line with his rate from the regular season (22 percent). For context, Giannis Antetokounmpo and LeBron James had rates of *42 percent and 51 percent in the regular season, respectively. * In case that last part was a little confusing, here\u2019s the math: Antetokounmpo\u2019s teammates took 3,184 shots while he was on the floor. Of those 3,184, 1,133 (42 percent) were off his passes. Leonard is one of the most complete players in the league, but playmaking is his shortcoming. When he had nine assists in Game 5 of the conference finals , it was a career high \u2026 for both the regular season and playoffs (now 574 total games). A look at the film from Game 2 of this series can show us why a guy who has the ball as much as he does and who draws so much attention from opposing defenses is averaging less than four assists per game. It also shows us how the Raptors continue to get stuck in late-clock situations. Leonard\u2019s reaction when he\u2019s double-teamed is often to dribble out of it. If he can attack quickly and get one defender to screen the other, he can get an open shot \u2026 https:\/\/twitter.com\/johnschuhmann\/status\/1126649557708832770\/video\/1 Dribbling out of the double-team could also get him a better angle to make a pass or allow him to attack again, like he did in the second quarter on a play that led to an open Norman Powell 3-pointer (with some help from Marc Gasol\u2019s screen on Andre Iguodala)\u2026                But often, the results aren\u2019t so great. Here\u2019s a first-quarter play where he dribbled out of a double team, couldn\u2019t get the ball to any of the teammates that popped open, and had to take a tough shot with one second left on the clock \u2026                In the second quarter, after dribbling out of a double-team, he was unable to get the ball to an open Pascal Siakam on the baseline \u2026                A couple of Leonard\u2019s five turnovers were a result of him driving too deep into a crowd. \u201cI thought we hit an action and something would be there,\u201d Raptors coach Nick Nurse said after Game 2, \u201cand they would cover it up with some help defense. Well, when there\u2019s help, there\u2019s got to be somebody else probably open on the other side of the floor, and I thought we kind of shot a few too many into multiple defenders or two defenders around the basket, where those probably should have been maybe swung to the other side.\u201d Leonard\u2019s inability to get the ball to the open man on Sunday wasn\u2019t just about passing out of double-teams. Here was Leonard collapsing the Golden State defense with a drive and Kyle Lowry popping open on the left wing \u2026               But Leonard didn\u2019t deliver the ball right away and by the time he got it to Lowry, the Raptors had lost the advantage they had gained from the paint attack \u2026                Here was an opportunity to deliver a pick-and-roll pocket pass to a rolling Gasol for a four-on-three situation, with Klay Thompson trailing the play \u2026               But Leonard couldn\u2019t make the pass (credit DeMarcus Cousins\u2019 defense to some extent), Thompson got back in the play, and Siakam was eventually smothered by Iguodala \u2026                The Raptors\u2019 inability to take advantage of the attention paid to Leonard in Game 2 wasn\u2019t just about Leonard himself. There were also a few cases of bad spacing, where he was doubled and just didn\u2019t have sufficient outlets with which to make a play \u2026 Example 1, which led to a turnover \u2026               Example 2, which led to a Fred VanVleet miss from 3-point range \u2026               Leonard still managed to work his way to 34 points in Game 2 . Sometimes, the Warriors gave him a little space to operate. There were multiple occasions in which he bullied his way to the basket (see the Looney injury noted above). There were also a couple of nice off-ball cuts and duck-ins.                               It\u2019s tough to nitpick Leonard\u2019s performance in these playoffs. He\u2019s averaged 30.9 points per game on a true shooting percentage of 62.3 percent ( the fifth-best mark among players with at least 100 postseason field goal attempts). He has hit some huge shots and he has played some stifling defense himself. While he can save his team some precious seconds on a lot of these possessions by making better and quicker decisions, Leonard\u2019s teammates must ensure the floor is properly spaced around him. Furthermore, Nurse and his staff have to find ways to loosen up the Golden State defense, which will continue to make Leonard play in a crowd in Game 3 on Wednesday ( 9 p.m. ET, ABC ). * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

He hobbled around afterward with an ice bag on the leg. Looney missed the second half of Game 2, finishing with a rebound, a turnover and three fouls in 10 minutes on Sunday night. He was averaging 7.2 points and 4.6 rebounds during the playoffs. Star forward Kevin Durant has missed the last seven playoff games and was yet to take part in a formal practice, something he needs to do before returning from a strained right calf. Last week, a report from Yahoo Sports said Durant was expected to play midway through The Finals \u2014 likely in Game 3 or Game 4. The Warriors are scheduled to practice Tuesday at Oracle Arena, so that could be Durant\u2019s opportunity to test the leg. The two-time reigning NBA Finals MVP was averaging 34.2 points this postseason before the injury May 8 in Game 5 of the Western Conference semifinals against Houston. He traveled to Toronto for the first two games of the series but didn\u2019t play.

The suit was filed on a travel day for the NBA Finals; Leonard and the Raptors flew to Oakland, California on Monday to begin preparing for Game 3 of the title series against the Golden State Warriors, a game that will be played Wednesday night. It was filed in California because Leonard maintains a home in San Diego, the suit said. Leonard was a Nike endorser until 2018. He now endorses New Balance. A Nike spokesman declined comment Monday, saying the company does not discuss pending litigation. Leonard is scheduled to speak with reporters on Tuesday when practice resumes at the NBA Finals. In the lawsuit, Leonard said Nike filed a copyright application for a logo that he designed and did so \u201cunbeknownst to Leonard and without his consent.\u201d Nike told Leonard earlier this year to stop using the logo, the lawsuit said. Leonard is preparing to use the logo \u201con clothing lines, footwear and on other products and, among other things, in connection with sports camps and charity functions.\u201d Leonard claims that he developed the logo himself by tracing his very large hands. The ring and pinky fingers of the logo are shaped into a \u201cK,\u201d the middle finger and thumb form an \u201cL\u2033 and the index finger is designed to resemble an elongated \u201c2\u2033 \u2014 all nods to his initials and jersey number. The suit said that Leonard \u201crefined\u201d the logo in December 2011 or January 2012, and eventually consented that Nike could use it on certain products. Leonard wants the court to decide that he is the author of the logo and that Nike \u201ccommitted fraud\u201d when registering the logo for copyright. Leonard is in the NBA Finals for the third time, and got there in his first season as a member of the Raptors after previously playing with the San Antonio Spurs.

The swing team was Toronto, falling from 118 in the opener to 104 Sunday. * The Wrap:  Complete Game 2 Coverage \u201cSo it was all about our defense,\u201d Warriors coach Steve Kerr said, \u201cand we held them to 37 percent and forced 15 turnovers and guarded the 3-point line well. So it was championship defense and that\u2019s what it\u2019s going to take.\u201d Kerr\u2019s focus was spot-on. Offensively, Golden State nearly duplicated its performance from one game to the next. Its shooting percentages were eerily similar, especially from distance (38.7 percent in Game 1, 38.2 in Game 2) and instead of turning over the ball 17 times, it did so \u201conly\u201d 16 times. But as you look at the defensive side of the stats, you can almost hear \u2013 no, not Kerr\u2019s raspy California voice, but Tony D\u2019Amato\u2019s, as played by Al Pacino, chewing scenery as the football coach in \u201cAny Given Sunday,\u201d telling his players where they could find the edge they need to rally for a victory. \u201cThe inches we need are everywhere around us,\u201d Pacino\u2019s character said, in a Hollywood version of what coaches do. \u201cThey\u2019re in every break of the game, every minute, every second. On this team, we fight for that inch. On this team, we tear ourselves and everyone else around us to pieces for that inch.\u201d That\u2019s sort of how the Warriors found the 14 points they needed to flip 109 from a losing point total into something that got the job done. Limiting Toronto\u2019s fast-break production to 18, rather than 24 in Game 1, well, that\u2019s six points right there. Sending the Raptors to the line a little less by defending without whistles? That saved four more. And so it went. Golden State knows itself well enough to believe that 109 points should be enough. Its defensive rating during the season was 109.5 points per 100 possessions, and clearly playoff basketball gets grindier. It will be an interesting line to watch for as long as this series continues. \u2026 it\u2019s often when you get them. By the end of Game 2, Golden State actually had been called for more fouls (26) than Toronto (22). Chances are, that\u2019s surprising, because in the first half Sunday, it seemed as if the Raptors were headed toward multiple disqualifications. As it turned out, only guard Kyle Lowry was required to exit with six fouls before the game was complete. He went out with about four minutes left and the Raptors still down by eight. His line was pretty unsatisfying: 13 points on 4-of-11 shooting with two assists in 28 minutes. Much of the damage done to Toronto by foul calls came in the first five minutes of the second quarter, during which they picked up five. That put the Warriors in the bonus early and saddled key Raptors \u2013 Lowry, Serge Ibaka, Pascal Siakam \u2013 with three each, while Marc Gasol and Fred VanVleet had two. Early fouls can gouge into a man\u2019s minutes as surely as they can mess with his aggressiveness. VanVleet never picked up his third but Siakam and Gasol had to play with four. Those two combined for 18 points after scoring 52 in Game 1, and while all of the shortfall can\u2019t be blamed on foul trouble, it had to be a factor. \u201cYou try not to [consciously alter your style] but it\u2019s the nature of the game,\u201d VanVleet said, talking about officiating inconsistencies from one play to the next. \u201cAs players you got to do a better job of adjusting and trying to find that fine line and straddle that line. I think that some of us did that better than others, and I thought that Kyle had a got a rough whistle a little bit, and it goes like that sometimes. So just got to try to beable to adjust and not focus on that so much.\u201d Lowry has been fighting foul trouble throughout these playoffs. It\u2019s a by-product of his physical style of play and sometimes an unwanted consequence of his knack for drawing charges. Getting yanked with two fouls in the first quarter or three in the second might have hidden benefits to his late-game stamina, but it puts Toronto coach Nick Nurse into player rotations he wouldn\u2019t naturally choose. Almost to a man, each time someone asked a question afterward about Golden State\u2019s daunting 18-0 run to start the second half \u2013 a stretch that saw the Raptors stuck on 59 points for 5:40 of the third quarter \u2013 a Warriors player or coach would point out the little surge their side used to get closer before halftime. They sounded as proud of their little 6-1 surge over the final minute of the half as they were of the 18 unanswered points. Steph Curry scored all six points, on a floater, a finger roll and a pair of free throws. \u201cObviously Steph was great in closing out that half for us,\u201d forward Draymond Green said, \u201cand I think we should have been down by a lot more than five points [59-54]. But when you\u2019re going into the half down five, we know we can cover that in ten seconds. So our mindset was great coming out of the half.\u201d That Toronto lead once had been as much as 12, so the Warriors\u2019 strong close to the half \u2013 and familiarity with the sort of third-quarter thunder they showed again Sunday \u2013 should have been enough to make the Raptors nervous. Let\u2019s not go so far as to call what the Warriors gave us in Game 1 a \u201cfeel-out\u201d game. That\u2019s LeBron James\u2019 pet term for all the times his teams dropped the opener of a playoff series. When they did, more often than not, James and his guys didn\u2019t only not lose confidence when slipping into a 0-1 hole, they used the experience to address flaws, plug leaks, tweak matchups and generally get better. Consider: James\u2019 Cavaliers and Heat teams won six of eight series when following up a loss in the opener with a victory in Game 2. Righting the ship is a thing, apparently, if you\u2019ve had practice. We wouldn\u2019t be honest, either, if we didn\u2019t notice a pattern established in this 2019 postseason. Orlando jumped to a 1-0 lead vs. Toronto. Brooklyn went up 1-0 over Philadelphia. Paul Pierce smelled triumph when Boston grabbed a 1-0 lead over Milwaukee. And the Bucks seemed to be a lock when they won not just the first but the second game of the East finals for 2-0 control against the Raptors. Didn\u2019t mean a thing. The teams that started in a hole all roared back to win the next four games. The adjustments they made might have been subtle to the untrained eye, but the turnarounds were blatant and unforgiving. With the series shifting to Oakland, with the Raptors about to experience Oracle Arena on full blast in its final Finals form, shots that certain Toronto players have taken tentatively so far in the playoffs might become un-launchable. Anything short of a split and they\u2019ll need someone on the Golden State side to get suspended to slow the Warriors\u2019 roll. A former NBA All-Star who once played with Toronto found a ray of sunshine for his old team in the dark clouds parked over Golden State\u2019s training room. At the airport Monday morning, headed back to the States, this veteran of playoff wars and various injuries himself saw some serious gloom and potential doom in the defending champions\u2019 maladies. \u201cHe\u2019s not playing again if it\u2019s a hamstring,\u201d the retired star said of Warriors guard Klay Thompson, whose awkward landing after a jump shot had him angrily limping off the court in the final quarter of Game 2. \u201cThat\u2019s seven to 14 days.\u201d Well, seven days could enable Thompson to return in time for Game 5 Monday in Toronto, so\u2026 But the former player shook his head. And there was more.  \u201cThey say Looney\u2019s messed up on the whole upper side of his chest,\u201d he said of Golden State big man Kevon Looney, who suffered a bruise to his collarbone or chest when he landed hard after defending a Kawhi Leonard drive. Good thing then the Warriors have Kevin Durant coming back, right? Maybe not right. The former player didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cHe\u2019s not coming back. He\u2019s a free agent, right? Come back and get hurt again? Uh uh.\u201d It\u2019s hard to know what to make of all this negativity about the Warriors\u2019 injury inventory. If a savvy, been-there, dealt-with-that NBA star can be right based on his own experiences rather than any inside peek within the Golden State medical quarters, the Raptors might catch a break in facing thinned ranks. Then again, Thompson historically has been a quick healer. And unless the Warriors have been dealing in sheer gamesmanship, the talk of Durant returning from his strained calf has been out there for more than a week. Keep in mind, too, that the player in question was neither Julius Erving nor Glenn Rivers, putting his M.D. credentials in doubt. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Viewership for the first two games of the series between the Golden State Warriors and Toronto Raptors was down sharply from last year\u2019s finals \u2013 24 percent for the first game and 26 percent for the second, the Nielsen company said. While LeBron James fans may point to the star\u2019s absence, geography likely accounts for most of the drop. Toronto\u2019s television audience is not included in the Nielsen ratings, since it\u2019s out of the U.S. Missing one team\u2019s fan base is a huge hurdle for ABC. It\u2019s Golden State\u2019s fifth straight appearance in the finals, while Toronto is there for the first time. The most hopeful sign for ABC is that the teams split the first two games, raising the possibility of a long series. Viewership traditionally increases with competitive series. The surest sign that summer is near is the return of NBC\u2019s \u201cAmerica\u2019s Got Talent,\u201d which was the top non-sports program of the week.

In 2012, the Pelicans selected six-time NBA All-Star Anthony Davis with the top pick. \u2014 This marks the fourth time in nine years that new Pelicans Executive Vice President of Basketball Operations David Griffin will play a prominent role in the selection of the No. 1 pick in the NBA Draft. Griffin worked as a top executive with the Cleveland Cavaliers when the team drafted Kyrie Irving (2011), Anthony Bennett (2013) Andrew Wiggins (2014) first overall. \u2014 In the common era of the NBA Draft (since 1966), Kentucky has had the most No. 1 overall picks with three: John Wall (2010), Anthony Davis (2012) and Karl-Anthony Towns (2015). \u2014 This year, Duke has a chance to equal Kentucky with its third No. 1 overall pick in the common draft era. The Blue Devils\u2019 two No. 1 selections are Elton Brand (1999) and Kyrie Irving (2011). \u2014 Since the NBA Draft Lottery began in 1985, four of 34 No. 1 overall picks have won an NBA championship with the team that drafted them: David Robinson (San Antonio Spurs, 1987), Tim Duncan (Spurs, 1997), LeBron James (Cleveland Cavaliers, 2003) and Kyrie Irving (Cavaliers, 2011). James\u2019 championship with the Cavaliers came in his second stint with the team. PICKING AND CHOOSING \u2014 The Memphis Grizzlies are picking second for the fifth time. The Grizzlies previously selected Mike Bibby (1998), Steve Francis (1999), Stromile Swift (2000) and Hasheem Thabeet (2009) with the No. 2 pick. \u2014 The New York Knicks (third pick) will make their highest selection since landing Patrick Ewing with the No. 1 pick in 1985. The Knicks also had the third pick in 1979 and chose Bill Cartwright. Other topfive picks in Knicks history include Cazzie Russell in 1966 (first); Walt Frazier in 1967 (fifth); Micheal Ray Richardson in 1978 (fourth); Kenny Walker in 1986 (fifth; and Kristaps Porzingis in 2015 (fourth). \u2014 The Los Angeles Lakers are picking fourth for the first time. This is their fourth top-four pick in the last five years; the Lakers selected D\u2019Angelo Russell (2015), Brandon Ingram (2016) and Lonzo Ball (2017) with the No. 2 pick in their respective drafts. \u2014 The Boston Celtics are set to make three three selections in the first round (Nos. 14, 20 and 22) and one selections in the second round (No. 51). If the Celtics make all four picks, that would give them an NBAhigh 21 draft picks since 2015. SCHOOL TIES \u2014 Ja Morant is expected to become the second player from Murray State to be selected in the first round. Cameron Payne was chosen by the Oklahoma City Thunder with the 14th pick in 2015. Payne and Isaiah Canaan, a second-round pick in 2013, are the school\u2019s only two picks since 1996. \u2014 Jarrett Culver has a chance to become the third Texas Tech player selected in the first round, joining Tony Battie (1997) and Zhaire Smith (2018). \u2014 De\u2019Andre Hunter has a chance to become Virginia\u2019s first top-10 pick since Olden Polynice in 1987 and only the second first-round pick since 1995, along with Justin Anderson (2015). Recent second-picks Mike Scott (2012), Joe Harris (2014) and Malcolm Brogdon (2016) have found success in the NBA after playing collegiately at Virginia. \u2014 Since the NBA adopted a two-round draft in 1989, Kentucky has had the most first-round selections with 37. Duke is next with 36 first-round picks. Since 1989, Kentucky holds the record for the most picks in an NBA Draft \u2013 six each in 2012 and 2015. GLOBAL GAME \u2014 A record 27 international players were drafted in 2016, including a record 15 in the first round and a record-tying 12 in the second round. \u2014 Duke\u2019s RJ Barrett is set to continue a recent trend of Canadian players being selected in the NBA Draft Lottery, joining Anthony Bennett (2013), Kelly Olynyk (2013), Andrew Wiggins (2014), Nik Stauskas (2014), Trey Lyles (2015), Jamal Murray (2016) and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (2018). \u2014 Joining Barrett as potential draft picks from Canada this year are Virginia Tech\u2019s Nickeil Alexander-Walker; Michigan\u2019s Ignas Brazdeikis; Syracuse\u2019s Oshae Brissett; Gonzaga\u2019s Brandon Clarke; Arizona State\u2019s Luguentz Dort; Florida State\u2019s Mfiondu Kabengele; Iowa State\u2019s Marial Shayok; and Vanderbilt\u2019s Simi Shittu. \u2014 Gonzaga\u2019s Rui Hachimura is poised to become the first Japanese-born player drafted into the NBA. Only two Japanese-born players have appeared in a regular-season NBA game: Yuta Watanabe and Yuta Tabuse. \u2014 The top international players (who didn\u2019t play at a U.S. college) for the 2019 NBA Draft include Goga Bitadze (Georgia), Sekou Doumbouya (France) and Luka Samanic (Croatia). \u2014 Doumbouya has a chance to become the highest pick ever from France. Frank Ntilikina was selected by the Knicks with the eighth pick in the 2017 NBA Draft, the highest for a French player. \u2014 Last year, Deandre Ayton (Bahamas) became the 13th international player to be selected No. 1 overall.

The sport\u2019s awareness has multiplied in the last few decades \u2014 thank you, Vince Carter \u2014 and kids are populating playgrounds and gyms more than ever before, and this is having a trickle effect in the NBA. When the 2018-19 began, there were 11 Canadians on rosters . In the postseason, there have been six: Shai-Gilgeous Alexander (LA Clippers), Cory Joseph (Indiana Pacers), Khem Birch (Orlando Magic), Trey Lyles (Denver Nuggets), Jamal Murray (Denver Nuggets) and Chris Boucher (Raptors). With Steve Nash, the favorite son of Canadian basketball, leading the charge, Team Canada should be competitive in 2020 at the Tokyo Olympics. Canada has made the podium in Olympic play only once \u2014 back in 1936, winning silver. Nash is the country\u2019s Michael Jordan, with a pair of NBA MVP awards and seven All-NBA teams.  And now the Raptors are battling the two-time defending champion Golden State Warriors on the highest of stages. The glare is looked upon Toronto rather favorably, given the country-wide support for the Raptors and the heightened awareness created by Kawhi Leonard and teammates. This makes Jamaal Magloire rather proud. He\u2019s a basketball development consultant and community ambassador for the Raptors, and before this, he played 12 seasons in the NBA , making the 2004 All-Star team as a center on the Charlotte Hornets. But mostly, \u201cBig Cat,\u201d who also played one season with Toronto and retired as a Raptor, was born and raised in Toronto and became one of the first batch of Canadian players to reach the NBA.  Therefore, Magloire has touched all the bases: Canadian native and current resident, NBA player from Canada, second Canadian to be named an All-Star (after Nash), former Raptors assistant coach and now at age 41, a consultant for the home team. He speaks from rich perspective, then, regarding the growth of the game in Canada and the development of the Raptors since 1995; the franchise was born when he was a senior in high school. Here\u2019s Magloire addressing his introduction to the game, growing up in the tough neighborhood of Scarborough after being born to Trinidadian immigrants, the influence of basketball among Canadians and the impact of the current team led by Kawhi. * * * Shaun Powell: Canada didn\u2019t have an NBA team when you were a kid. How did the game find you? Jamaal Magloire: Well, we didn\u2019t have any money, and it was a sport more for the inner city because it didn\u2019t cost a lot for equipment. Resources were always a problem; there weren\u2019t any open gyms so we played outside in the rain and snow. A good experience, good times. I know that doesn\u2019t sound like fun, because Toronto\u2019s winters are harsh, and we sometimes played without coats, but it was fun. When you\u2019re a kid, you don\u2019t know how hard you have it. You just play and have fun.  SP: The most popular sport here was and remains hockey and yet as you grew to 6-10 and brought toughness, somehow nobody saw you as being a future defenseman, I take it. JM: I never played hockey. I played every other sport. Actually, we played road hockey but I never got on the ice. The equipment would be too expensive. So there was no future in hockey for me. SP: Are Canadian inner-cities just as tough as those in the States? JM: Well, let\u2019s just say there\u2019s a lot of challenges. We didn\u2019t have it easy. We had no facilities like recreation centers or anything like that. From that standpoint, being a kid who was into sports, it was a challenging time to say the least. SP: Since you never attended an NBA game until the one you played in as a rookie, how did you get exposure to the top level? JM: Everybody played in the States so we watched the \u201cNBA on NBC\u201d and I got to see some of the prime time games. I admired Chris Webber, Shaquille O\u2019Neal, Hakeem Olajuwon, most of the centers. SP: How does a Canadian teenager get the attention of major college scouts? JM: I was able to go to ABCD camp and play in a few AAU tournaments in the summer in Las Vegas. Coaches started coming up to Canada to my high school to recruit. SP: You wound up at Kentucky so the word must\u2019ve gotten out.  JM: Back when I was being recruited I was getting letters and lots of them. Just the fact that I went to Kentucky boosted my profile and basketball\u2019s profile in Toronto and gave kids around here the motivation to challenge themselves to get to the next level. It was a lot different back then, no social media or anything like that, but we made it work and I\u2019m very happy for the young guys today. SP: As a rare Canadian in America playing college basketball, at least back then, how were you received on campus? JM: I was teased all the time by my teammates but I was proud. I didn\u2019t care. I\u2019d wear my Team Canada gear every day to let them know where I was from. They got the message. SP: When you look at the growth of the game in this country, it must draw a positive response from you. JM: When I was in the NBA we had three guys: Steve Nash , myself and Todd MacCulloch . Now, there\u2019s the second-most players in terms of foreign players in the NBA and it continues to grow. I see the evolution based on what Steve Nash started, and now with the Raptors. SP: But certainly you consider yourself a pioneer as well, correct? JM: Absolutely. It really hit home when I signed to play for the Raptors in my final year in the NBA. To be the first Canadian to play on home soil was something I dreamed of. I followed this team my whole career and was so humbled to have the chance to come home and finish where I started. SP: Are you surprised by the level of support for the Raptors? Their attendance consistently ranks among the top five or 10 in the NBA. JM: What is surprising to me is the volume of people. \u201cJurassic Park\u201d has always been going on outside of the arena, but now it\u2019s going for blocks and blocks, stretching far away from the arena. There are Jurassic Parks all over Toronto. That has surprised me. SP: What are your thoughts on Masai Ujiri, the team president who created this roster? JM: Masai is a pioneer in his own right. He has brought a new and innovative look throughout the entire franchise, a G League team, having the All-Star Game here and obviously the moves that he made to create this team. He gets credit for Drake as well. That\u2019s a big plus for us as an organization. He\u2019s stared a lot of new things here and improving the game. All of what you see, both on the court and away from it, has been influenced in some way by Masai. SP: Now that you mentioned Drake, he gets grief outside of Toronto for his court-side behavior, but in the 416 he\u2019s admired, correct? JM: Yes he is. I admire him and his passion for the game. He is seen and noticed and you can see by the fan reaction that they value him and love him. SP: What have you learned about Kawhi Leonard here in his first season with the Raptors? JM: Since the first time he\u2019s been here, he\u2019s been talking about winning. That\u2019s what we need. He has the championship pedigree, winning in San Antonio. Even as a coach, I\u2019m learning from him. His tenacity to play on both sides of the ball has sprinkled throughout the team and given us an identity. SP: Kyle Lowry? JM: His hard work and perseverance. Being 6 feet tall and fighting for everything he\u2019s got. Every possession. He never takes time off when he\u2019s on the floor. SP: Pascal Siakam had a strong Game 1 with 32 points and actually has been a revelation all season. You\u2019ve worked with him. Your thoughts about where he is and where he\u2019s going? JM: He\u2019s come tremendously. I remember going to Buffalo and working him out before we drafted him. To see the strides he has made is awesome. I\u2019ll be very surprised and hurt if he is not the Most Improved Player this year. SP: Nick Nurse assumed the head coaching job after a controversial dismissal of Dwane Casey who won NBA Coach of the Year in 2018 . Where has Nurse succeeded? JM: His style of coaching is one that\u2019s conducive to the way guys are nowadays. The NBA is different than when I played. He knows how to reach players and gain their confidence. He\u2019s been in the system for five years prior to this year as head coach, so he knows these guys\u2019 DNA in and out. SP: You were known as a tenacious player who certainly wasn\u2019t bashful in the paint. But the league has gone away from power players. How would you fit in today\u2019s game? JM: (Laughs) I\u2019d get at least 10 rebounds and three blocks, for sure. Watching some of these guys and their lack of intensity gives me hope that I can still play (laughs). SP: Where does Jamaal Magloire see himself in this organization in the near future? JM: Hopefully I\u2019m still here. This is where I belong. In 10 years I hope to be working here in the place where I learned basketball and still promote basketball in the neighborhoods. We\u2019re trying to win. I\u2019ve seen the dark days of this organization. I want to stick with it. I want that championship * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

Barack Obama walked through a back hallway of the Scotiabank Arena about a half-hour before tip-off of the second game in the title series between the Toronto Raptors and Golden State Warriors. http:\/\/twitter.com\/Raptors\/status\/1135329207708508160 He sat next to NBA Commissioner Adam Silver across the court from the Toronto bench, getting a loud ovation and \u201cMVP!

Golden State coach Steve Kerr, who wore a T-shirt before the game with a message to encouraging voting, says he wasn\u2019t aware of Obama\u2019s attendance until shortly before he arrived. The coach says Obama\u2019s presence made him think of the Warriors\u2019 first time visiting the White House after their championship in 2015. Kerr says, \u201cthat was quite a thrill to visit there and have the whole team there. It\u2019s a treat to experience that.\u201d Per multiple reports, Obama was in Ottawa on Friday to speak at an event organized by Canada 2020, a progressive think tank. He took the opportunity on Friday to praise the Raptors and the Warriors for their style of play. \u201cBoth teams play like teams. So their superstars are unselfish and just want results,\u201d Obama said, per The Washington Post . \u201cLesson Two is both teams draw from talent that is unexpected and international. \u2026 If you don\u2019t know where the talent\u2019s going to be, you have to give opportunity to everybody.\u201d Of course, no visit to a Raptors home game would be complete without some kind of interaction with the team\u2019s resident super fan\/team ambassador, Drake.

However, the All-Star is scheduled for an MRI on Monday in Oakland and he sounds confident he will be OK to suit up for Game 3 on Wednesday ( 9 ET, ABC ). Thompson won\u2019t be the only one undergoing tests, as forward\/center Kevon Looney will have an MRI and CT scan Monday as well. Looney missed the second half of Game 2 with a chest or shoulder injury, finishing with a rebound, a turnover and three fouls in 10 minutes on Sunday night.  Thompson landed awkwardly after a 3-point attempt with 10 minutes, 40 seconds left in the fourth quarter. He played for a few more minutes before subbing out with 7:59 left as Golden State salted away a 109-104 win that tied The Finals 1-1. He then headed back to the locker room with some of the Warriors\u2019 training staff to be checked out. Per ESPN\u2019s Nick Friedell , Thompson walked out of Scotiabank Arena with a limp but sounded confident he would play in Game 3. \u201cOh, yeah,\u201d said Thompson, when asked if he\u2019d be all right. Warriors coach Steve Kerr said after the game that Thompson indicated the injury wasn\u2019t serious, but wasn\u2019t sure about the All-Star sharpshooter\u2019s availability moving forward. After Wednesday\u2019s Game 3, Game 4 will be on Friday. \u201cKlay said he\u2019ll be fine, but Klay could be half-dead and he\u2019d say he\u2019s fine,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see. He pulled his hamstring. He thinks it\u2019s minor, so I don\u2019t know what that means going forward. Sorry. That\u2019s all I got.\u201d Looney left Game 2 because of what the team said was a chest contusion. After the game, Kerr said Looney exited because of \u201csomething with his shoulder.\u201d Overall, it is unclear exactly when Looney suffered his injury. Additionally, veteran forward Andre Iguodala was shaken up in Game 2 as well after running into a screen by Raptors center Marc Gasol. Iguodala went to the locker room to be examined, but ultimately played 28 minutes and nailed the game-clinching 3-pointer with 7 seconds left. \u201cIt\u2019s just a mindset,\u201d Iguodala said, per ESPN. \u201cGo play. I\u2019m not saying it was smart, but you only got two weeks left, a week, whatever it is left. You just try to gut it out and see if you can\u2019t help the team. \u201cI got my head knocked off. It kind of woke me up a little bit.\u201d The Warriors have played short-handed in The Finals, as they have been without star forward Kevin Durant. Last week, reports circulated that Durant is expected to return sometime midway through the series \u2014 which could possibly mean Game 3 or Game 4. Information from the Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":33441,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/cousins-form-returns-right-time-warriors","date":"2019-06-03","title":"Cousins returns from injury, returns to form and delivers win","content":" TORONTO \u2014 It was the moment the Golden State Warriors waited so long to see, and finally it arrived in the nick of time: The still-recovering former All-Star, out of the starting lineup for more than a minute, returning and dismissing the noise about how the team is better without him by impacting the game in multiple ways and pulling them to victory. And get this: If the Warriors are truly fortunate, Kevin Durant will recover soon and duplicate what DeMarcus Cousins just did \u2014 in The Finals. If he does, it could serve a critical blow to Toronto\u2019s chances of pulling off a late-series surprise. \u201cWe know what we\u2019re dealing with here,\u201d said Toronto Raptors guard Fred VanVleet. Cousins provided the help that the two-time defending champions needed Sunday to draw even in the series and snatch momentum with a 109-104 victory at Scotiabank Arena. He played more than anyone thought, rebounded more than anyone imagined, defended and scored more than Toronto bargained for, and gave the Warriors what they missed the last 6 1\/2 weeks with him on the shelf. The 11 points, 10 rebounds, six assists and two blocked shots from Cousins didn\u2019t fully encapsulate how much relief he brought to the Warriors. He had a galvanizing effect on a team that used an 18-0 run to start the second half to seize control of Game 3 and then used Andre Iguodala\u2019s 3-point shot to ice it. They haven\u2019t been in one piece since April 15, in the first round against the LA Clippers, when Cousins chased a loose ball, stumbled and grabbed his left leg. The torn quad required no surgery but a lengthy rehab period, and this after Cousins went through a 10-month rehab for a torn Achilles\u2019 tendon in the spring of 2018. He was feeling beat up. Cousins attacked the process anyway, determined to return from an injury that normally would mean the end to his postseason, for the simple reason that he hadn\u2019t been to the playoffs in his career to this point. There\u2019s also a matter of free agency awaiting in July as a strong return could improve his bottom line. \u201cOnce they told me I have a chance, a slight chance, of being able to return, it basically was up to me and the work I put in,\u201d Cousins said. \u201cSo I put the work and the time in and with God\u2019s grace I\u2019m able to be out here and play the game I love.\u201d Cousins was clearly out of rhythm from the layoff in Game 1, his timing rusty, his execution unsure. He played just eight minutes without scoring a basket or drawing much attention from Toronto. But Warriors coach Steve Kerr made the surprise decision to start Cousins three nights later, and that faith was repaid handsomely. Cousins was active, his confidence growing stronger by the minute \u2014 27 of them, actually, and he only asked to be subbed out once. \u201cWe came in thinking he can maybe play 20 minutes,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cHe was fantastic and we needed everything he gave out there: his rebounding, his toughness, his physical presence, getting the ball in the paint, and just playing big, like he does. We needed all of that.\u201d What the Warriors hoped was for Cousins to be the best big man on the floor. In Game 1, that honor went to Raptors center Marc Gasol, who became a prime scoring option (20 points) by hitting open jumpers. Cousins didn\u2019t give him that amount of breathing space in Game 2, and Gasol (six points) was never a factor. Cousins\u2019 teammates offered rave reviews. Said Stephen Curry: \u201cObviously you get more comfortable with more minutes and playing aggressive. He puts a lot of pressure on their defense. It\u2019s a big lift for us. More to come.\u201d Draymond Green said: \u201cThe more he plays, the better feel he gets. He was great on both ends. It allowed us to play through him in the post. Toronto knows. They\u2019ve got to honor that, and we know what he\u2019s capable of doing if they don\u2019t.\u201d Cousins had an amusing reaction to learning he was in the starting lineup \u2014 \u201cI was like, \u2018Cool\u2019 \u201d \u2014 and feels as though he has more to give. \u201cWhen I step on the floor, I\u2019m going to leave it out there,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to be on this stage. This is what I\u2019ve worked for my entire career, to have this opportunity to play for something.\u201d Cousins spent seven years in purgatory in Sacramento, where he racked up losses and technicals. It was a frustrating time for him as he had no faith in the franchise\u2019s leadership and it soured his attitude. His trade to the New Orleans Pelicans two years ago was met with enthusiasm as he teamed with Anthony Davis to form an intimidating front line. His Achilles\u2019 injury cut short his time on the floor and, ultimately, in New Orleans. The team refused to offer him a contract last summer, leading him to join the Warriors at a discount. Then there\u2019s the matter of Durant. The two-time Finals MVP hasn\u2019t been cleared for full-contact practice, and the Warriors will hold only one prior to Game 3. Kerr said it\u2019s \u201cfeasible\u201d that Durant could play with only one practice under his belt, yet that\u2019s not the ideal scenario. With the series tied 1-1 and the next two games in Oakland, the timing of Cousins revival means there\u2019s a bit less urgency to see Durant on the floor. Yet it appears to be a matter of when, not if, Durant will see action in this series. It might be at the perfect moment, with Klay Thompson suffering a hamstring injury in the fourth quarter of Game 2 that forced him off the court. The All-Star guard later told Kerr he\u2019s fine and that the hamstring tightness is minor, but his status will be determined by MRI. Given what\u2019s happened so far, the Warriors can never be too careful or take the rosy view when it comes to muscle issues. They\u2019ve established a theme that tells the story of their 2019 postseason, and it\u2019s not one they designed or even wanted, but it fits their existence nonetheless: \u201crecovery\u201d and their ability to do so on all front. It\u2019s not just injuries, though. In sweeping the Portland Trail Blazers in the Western Conference finals , Golden State had to recover from deficits of 17, 18 and 17 points. Trailing 1-0 in The Finals, they recovered from 12 down to win on the road for a 23rd straight series \u2014 an NBA record. What the Warriors reminded everyone at Scotiabank Arena \u2014 in case folks forgot \u2014 is that they\u2019re champions and bring plenty of know-how to this series. They are capable of winning games by any means necessary. \u201cIt\u2019s big respect for them,\u201d said Toronto Raptors forward Kawhi Leonard. \u201cThey have been here each of the last four years, won the last two, and you\u2019ve got to take the challenge. They\u2019re a great team.\u201d But the Warriors would rather put a fully-loaded and healthy squad \u2014 one that is clearly the class of the NBA \u2014 on the court and win with that. These Finals might finally get the Warriors at full strength. If not, they still might be more than the Raptors can handle. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

The Golden State Warriors survived two new injuries and a 5 1\/2-minute stretch of scoreless basketball to escape with a 109-104 victory over the Toronto Raptors in Game 2 of The Finals , punctuated by Andre Iguodala\u2019s dagger 3-pointer with 5.9 seconds left. The Warriors\u2019 backcourt of Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson combined for 48 points and Draymond Green came one assist shy of recording his fourth straight triple-double. The Warriors assisted on 34 of their 38 field goals and evened the series at one game apiece. One stat stood out from the rest   as the Warriors grabbed home-court advantage as we head to Oakland for Games 3 and 4, with the champs now dealing with injuries to Kevin Durant (strained right calf), Thompson (left hamstring tightness) and Kevon Looney (left chest contusion). 12 \u2014 Scoreless possessions for the Raptors to start the third quarter. The Warriors trailed by as many as 12 points in the second quarter, and it was an 11-point Toronto lead late in the half. But Golden State closed the period on a 9-3 run to make it a five-point game at the break. What followed was one of those game-changing third quarters that has become a hallmark of these Warriors. This wasn\u2019t about their explosive offense, but rather a stifling defense that shut down Toronto for the first 5:38 of the second half. It started with a matchup adjustment. Iguodala had been the primary defender on Kawhi Leonard through the first three halves of this series. But to open the third quarter on Sunday, it was Thompson defending Leonard, Iguodala checking Pascal Siakam, and Green on Kyle Lowry. It\u2019s hard to argue with the results. On the Raptors\u2019 first possession of the third, they weren\u2019t able to get the ball to Leonard until there were just five seconds left on the shot clock, and he missed a contested 3 from the right wing. On the next possession, Green helped off his man to deflect a Danny Green pass, one of five Toronto turnovers on their first nine possessions of the period. On Toronto\u2019s third time with the ball in the third, DeMarcus Cousins cut off a Leonard pick-and-roll drive and Thompson came back to contest a stepback jumper. After the Raptors outscored the Warriors 28-12 in the paint in the first half, five of Toronto\u2019s first six shots of the third came from outside the paint. They missed some open jumpers, but the Warriors made it a point to give the Raptors nothing easy on the inside. Both Iguodala and Cousins blocked Siakam in the post, and Thompson stripped Leonard on his way to the bucket. In total, over those first 12 possessions of the third quarter, the Raptors shot 0-for-8 (with none of the eight shots coming in the restricted area) and committed five turnovers. By the time Fred VanVleet ended the drought on a corner 3 with 6:22 on the clock, the Warriors had turned a five-point deficit into a 13-point lead. Going back to the end of the second quarter, it was a 27-3 run. The Raptors made things interesting with a late 10-0 run \u2014 the Warriors\u2019 scoreless drought in the fourth was just a little shorter (5:33) than that of the Raptors in the third (5:38) \u2014 but never had a shot to tie or take the lead after the game turned early in the second half. Like they did last year, the Warriors ranked 11th defensively in the regular season. But they also had the No. 1 defense in the playoffs , allowing just 101.8 points per 100 possessions as they won their second straight championship. After Game 1 on Thursday, the Warriors ranked 10th defensively in this postseason, having allowed 110.8 points per 100 possessions. They suffered some slippage and just weren\u2019t the same defensive team as they had been during their championship runs. Maybe it was a sign that this is the year that their dynasty comes to an end. Or maybe they just needed some adversity before they flipped the switch. And maybe the idea of a 2-0 deficit in The Finals was just enough to do it. The first 5 1\/2 minutes of the third quarter on Sunday were game-changing, and perhaps series-changing. It started with a matchup adjustment (preliminary matchup data from Second Spectrum has the Raptors scoring just 15 points on the 25 possessions that Thompson defended Leonard) and it continued with a little more effort. In these playoffs, the Warriors are now 5-4 after trailing by double-digits and 13-0 when they\u2019ve allowed fewer than 115.5 points per 100 possessions. When they\u2019ve defended to some degree of success, they\u2019ve won.

At a time in the 1980s when the Lakers\u2019 Pat Riley was turning the NBA sideline into a runway for GQ models in Italian suits, Layden was keeping it as real with the Utah Jazz as a thrift store and the Borscht Belt . Heck, even Layden himself would crack of the impeccably dressed and coiffed Riley: \u201cHe buys his clothes. I find mine.\u201d And yet, with Layden being named 2019 recipient of the Chuck Daly Lifetime Achievement Award presented by his peers in the National Basketball Coaches Association, his long and varied career in basketball gained ultimate validation. This isn\u2019t the Friars Club we\u2019re talking about, that fraternity of comedians known for their bawdy roasts; these are serious X&O men who have honored previous winners \u2014 Jack Ramsay, Lenny Wilkens, Tom Heinsohn, Al Attles, Dick Motta, Jerry Sloan and Riley, among others \u2014 for their basketball achievements and acumen. The award is named in honor of the former Detroit Pistons coach and two-time NBA champion, and is selected by a committee that includes respected NBCA members Phil Jackson, Gregg Popovich, Billy Cunningham, Bernie Bickerstaff, Joe Dumars, Donnie Walsh, Riley and Wilkens. That\u2019s why it means so much to Layden, whose resume already earned him induction into seven assorted Halls of Fame in his past. The one in Springfield, Mass., hasn\u2019t called, but winning the Daly award sounds like the next best thing to a man who, somewhere inside that soft, round body that longtime NBA fans remember, hid a driven, disciplined competitor. It\u2019s like Bill Murray getting his Oscar nomination for \u201cLost in Translation,\u201d no matter how loudly moviegoers howled at \u201cGhostbusters.\u201d  Leave it to Layden, though, to revert to form. The presentation was scheduled to take place before Game 2 of the 2019 Finals Sunday at Scotiabank Arena. \u201cI don\u2019t really believe I deserve this award,\u201d Layden, 87, said upon learning of the honor. \u201cBut having come from Brooklyn and having reached a high level of mediocrity in the coaching profession, on behalf of all the C students in the world I\u2019m going to take it anyway.\u201d It was the second most impressive moment of Layden\u2019s weekend \u2014 he and wife Barbara celebrated their 62nd wedding anniversary Saturday \u2014 but it validated his life, in fact their lives, in sports, in coaching and in teaching. Scott Layden, the couple\u2019s oldest son and currently general manager of the Minnesota Timberwolves, said the Daly award reminded of the 1983-84 postseason, when his father was voted NBA Coach of the Year, NBA Executive of the Year and recipient of the J. Walter Kennedy Citizenship Award all at once. Layden, who coached the Western Conference All-Stars that season, became the first person to win the Coach and Executive awards in the same year. He still is one of only four \u2014 with Red Auerbach, Larry Bird and Riley \u2014 to receive both in their career. \u201cI was so proud of him and excited for him,\u201d said the son, 25 years old at the time, \u201cbecause it accentuated him as more than just a funny guy who was a coach. There was so much substance to him in how he is as a leader, how he is as a person and how he is someone who cares about people.\u201d After Layden\u2019s decorated season, longtime Philadelphia and Orlando exec Pat Williams said: \u201cLayden is the only coach in the league, where all the other coaches were happy for him and rejoiced in his success. Now that\u2019s unusual for this gang.\u201d Peer validation is important to most of us, but in a coach\u2019s case, player affirmation matters even more. Layden seems to have checked that box, too. \u201cCoach Layden joked a lot and people took his joking as \u2018maybe he wasn\u2019t good at coaching.\u2019 I beg to differ,\u201d said Karl Malone, the Jazz\u2019s Hall of Fame power forward. \u201cHe was an unbelievable coaching mind. But no matter what he did as a coach, as a husband and a father and a best friend, coaching was just a blip on the radar.  I absolutely love Coach. He\u2019d jump your ass when you needed it, and he was blatantly honest. Like \u2018Some of you guys should back up to the pay window. You\u2019re [bleeping] stealing!\u2019 To me, when you\u2019re straight up with me and hit me right between the eyes, that\u2019s what I love and that\u2019s what he did.\u201d Or as NBA coach-turned-broadcaster Hubie Brown said: \u201cHe coached the way you\u2019re supposed to coach.\u201d Brown would know. The two men met as freshmen athletes at Niagara University in 1951, where they played basketball and baseball with fellow future NBA coach Larry Costello. By their junior season, coach John (Taps) Gallagher convinced Layden to take over as coach of the school\u2019s freshmen squad. That led to a career path that, after serving in the military (and running an all-Army hoops tournament) at Fort Monmouth in New Jersey, saw Layden coach in high school and college, eventually at his alma mater from 1968 to 1976. His most notable player during that time: Calvin Murphy, who became a Naismith Hall of Famer with the Houston Rockets. Brown, who broke into the NBA with Costello in Milwaukee, was hired in 1976 by the Atlanta Hawks and called Layden to be his assistant. On the limited staffs in those days, the lone assistant would handle advance scouting, so Layden frequently used New Orleans as his base to scout upcoming Hawks opponents. He built some friendships with Jazz personnel and wound up in 1979 being approached by that rag-tag team about a job. The first hitch: He was asked whether he preferred to be coach or general manager. Layden\u2019s instinct was to say, \u201cBoth.\u201d \u201cRed Auerbach told me, \u2018If you want to have success in the pros, you\u2019d better be the guy who signs the checks.\u2019 The players will have respect for you then,\u201d Layden said a few years ago in a podcast for the Jazz\u2019s Web site . \u201cI told them, \u2018This team was awful. You could hire Johnny Wooden, it wouldn\u2019t make a difference. This is going to take an overhaul, this is going to some patience. So I\u2019ll take the job as general manager. It\u2019s too nerve-wracking to be a coach here.\u2019 But I didn\u2019t know what I was doing. I was trying to get players and scout and everything else.\u201d The second hitch in Layden\u2019s job switch was the Jazz\u2019s relocation from New Orleans to Salt Lake City in the offseason of 1979. It was a bad team getting worse when it moved, and simply getting fans into the old Salt Palace arena was a priority and a chore. So they sold some tickets for as little as $1.50. Ushers were instructed to open the arena doors after halftime to \u201clet in anyone who wanted to wander in,\u201d Layden said, with the hope they might come back as paying customers. And that urgency to market the team launched Layden as a busy ambassador, selling the sport, the league and the franchise throughout the region through speaking engagements and media appearances. The only pro basketball tradition in the Utah area had come via the ABA Utah Stars from 1970 to 1976. That meant jokes, that meant one-liners (\u201cWe\u2019re America\u2019s team. America just doesn\u2019t know it.\u201d) Anything to get fans\u2019 feet in the Jazz\u2019s doors. He dialed up his humor after he replaced Tom Nissalke, the last Stars coach, on the Jazz sideline in December 1981. \u201cWe weren\u2019t very good so if I could slip on a banana and fall on the floor and people remembered it and it helped to bring them back, then so be it, ya know?\u201d Layden said after Utah gained respectability. His wisecracks made him a popular interview around the league, as instantly recognizable as his frame that ballooned beyond 300 pounds for much of his coaching tenure. Among them:  \u2014 \u201cTime was when admitting to being the Jazz coach was like saying you were the lookout at Pearl Harbor.\u201d \u2014 Greeting writers from the East Coast: \u201cYou must be glad to breathe some air you can\u2019t see.\u201d \u2014 Explaining why one of his players walked off the bus backwards: \u201cHe heard someone say, \u2018Let\u2019s grab his seat when he leaves.\u2019\u201d \u2014 On being gifted as a young baseball player with a new bat: \u201cBut two weeks later it flew away.\u201d \u2014 Layden claimed he was impressed to hear that his father-in-law was a diamond cutter \u201cuntil he learned he mowed the grass at Yankee Stadium.\u201d \u2014 Of his battle with weight, Layden cracked: \u201cIt just snacked up on me.\u201d \u2014 And when he acquired XXXL NBA big men Darryl Dawkins and Mel Turpin in the same year, he said it was to balance the bench: \u201cI was tilting it one way.\u201d In a 2014 Salt Lake City interview , a long-retired Layden acknowledged his lighthearted approach was more than just hucksterism. \u201cOne thing I to emphasize is, it should be fun,\u201d he said. \u201cAnything you do. If you go to school, it should be fun. If you go to work, it should be fun. And then you work and each day there should be some satisfaction that you accomplished something.\u201d \u201cIn my lifetime,\u201d Brown said, \u201che is the funniest, most spontaneous person I\u2019ve ever met. I always tell everybody, he, Tommy Lasorda and P.J. Carlesimo\u2019s father [Pete] have done more Communion breakfasts, more [speaking appearances] \u2018on the arm\u2019 \u2013 for nothing \u2013 for the Catholic church than any three guys in the country. He\u2019s very, very funny, an after-dinner speaker for high schools, colleges, corporations all over the country.\u201d Layden had made the Jazz\u2019s ill-fated 1981 trade that sent Dominique Wilkins to Atlanta, but the Utah franchise needed the million dollars included in the deal to settle ownership debts. But he also traded for Hall of Fame scorer Adrian Dantley and later drafted both John Stockton (No. 16, 1984, Gonzaga) and Malone (No. 13, 1985, Louisiana Tech). In 1983-84, the Jazz jumped from 30 victories to 45 and began a run of 20 consecutive playoff appearances that lasted through 2002-03. But Layden was on the bench for only the first five. In December 1988, he abruptly stepped down as coach and moved into a new role as Jazz team president. His lead assistant, Sloan, took over. \u201cWhat happened with me was, I got tired,\u201d Layden said. \u201cI regretted that I spent more time with other people\u2019s kids than my own. Scott, for instance, he was the captain of the St. Francis [University] team his senior year, and I only saw two games. [Life] is not a dress rehearsal. You can\u2019t get it back.\u201d Layden complained too at the time he resigned as coach about NBA crowds that were getting nastier in their comments and behavior toward the players and coaches, both home and road. Also, those who know him felt he more enjoyed, and was better suited to, building a team and coaching an underdog. The Jazz, when he handed them over to Sloan, were on their way as a Western Conference power, in sync with Stockton\u2019s and Malone\u2019s careers. \u201c[Sloan] took us to another level that I don\u2019t think I would have, to be honest,\u201d he said. Layden\u2019s NBA coaching record of 277-294 included a 102-79 in his final two-plus seasons. He was in the front office when the Jazz reached the Finals in 1997 and 1998, and he believes if not for an injury to massive center Mark Eaton, Utah could have beaten Hakeem Olajuwon\u2019s Houston teams in 1994 and 1995 and possibly won one of its matchups with Michael Jordan\u2019s Bulls. Malone remains a true believer in his first NBA coach. Reached by phone in Louisiana on Saturday, he told NBA.com: \u201cCoach Layden always told me how good I could be if I dedicated myself. \u2018First thing you need to do is learn to shoot free throws. I can bring in all the shot doctors in the world to help you fix your free-throw issues. But heck, you know you\u2019ve got \u2018em. Go work on \u2018em! Get better!\u2019 \u201cThat\u2019s what I wanted to hear. Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re throwing a pity party for Karl Malone and you\u2019re bringing in a shot doctor. He said, \u2018Put your big-boy pants on and get out there and learn to shoot free throws. Or I can\u2019t keep your ass on the floor, because people are gonna foul you. You want to play? You want to become an All-Star? Learn to shoot free throws!\u2019\u201d Malone went from a raw-boned rookie who missed more than half his foul shots to a 76 percent shooter his final 16 seasons, as well as a 14-time all-NBA selection, two-time MVP and first-ballot Hall of Famer. Layden, in being presented with the Daly award, once again gains acceptance from the colleagues and rivals he respects. \u201cWhen I was growing up,\u201d Scott Layden said, \u201cmy dad\u2019s best friends were coaches. He was all about promoting coaching, promoting teaching. It was about Lou Carnesseca and Hubie Brown, and on and on about what was important in the profession. He idolized Coach [John] Wooden and Coach [Dean] Smith. It was such a rich fraternity, and he was so proud of being in that fraternity. Layden spent a decade in the Jazz\u2019s front office and even coached one season for the WNBA\u2019s Utah Starzz. When his son went to New York to be GM of the Knicks, Layden served as a consultant. And no, Scott said, he never felt shorted of his father\u2019s time. \u201cHardly,\u201d the younger Layden said. \u201cThe highlight of my life was, we worked together for 25 years in Utah and New York. When it was Coach Sloan and my dad and I, it was the greatest time of my life. It was the friendship and the kinship that we all shared.\u201d Layden\u2019s retirement has been busier than many people\u2019s careers. He and Barbara live in downtown Salt Lake City, staying close to family, grandchildren, friends and Jazz fans. They travel, including trips to New York to scratch their Broadway theater itch and, for him, visits to Cooperstown with old buddies to re-visit the Baseball Hall of Fame. They traveled to London to take acting lessons, then put them to use on stage appearing in a Niagara Falls, N.Y., production of \u201cLove Letters.\u201d It ran for about 50 performances, raising money for charity. The Daly award reaches back to a sliver of Layden\u2019s fascinating career, about 10 years as an NBA coach in between his many other roles. But it\u2019s the one for which he\u2019s best known and arguably most appreciated. Just ask Malone. \u201cCoach Layden said something I\u2019ve used a thousand times, including my own family,\u201d the former Jazz strongman said. \u201cHe said, \u2018Let me explain something to you, young man. Either you can take constructive criticism or you can\u2019t. You shouldn\u2019t be worried when I\u2019m jumping your ass, young fella. You should be very worried when I stop coaching you.\u2019 I\u2019ve never forgot that. \u201cThis [award] could not have gone to a better person, and someone I can call my friend and my hero. He got us going and I never forgot it,\u201d Malone added. \u201cGot to war for him? I would kill for him.\u201d So now the Mailman\u2019s got jokes, just like his old coach. *** Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

(AP) \u2014 Retired NBA star Dwyane Wade was a surprise guest speaker Sunday at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School\u2019s graduation ceremony, leading cheers and recalling how nervous he was to meet students following the on-campus shootings last year that claimed 17 lives. Wade called himself \u201cpart of this MSD family\u201d and told graduates that it was understandable if they feel unsure about their futures \u2014 because in some ways, after 16 years in the NBA, he also is unsure exactly what his future entails. \u201cI\u2019m so proud to say the words `MSD Strong,\u201d\u2018 Wade said. \u201cToday, you will close a chapter in your lives and embark on new experiences and journeys and memories. And it\u2019s a time to celebrate and be proud of everything you\u2019ve done to make it to this moment. As you know, I, too, recently closed a pretty significant chapter in my life. So in a way I feel like I can relate to what\u2019s going on in your minds right now.\u201d Wade\u2019s appearance was not publicly disclosed before it happened; such was the case when he visited the school the day it reopened following the shootings on Feb. 14, 2018. He relayed the story of what went into that visit, and how he was unsure if his remarks would have any real impact on a grieving student body. \u201cWhat started going through my mind was, `How do I dare come here and act like I know what you guys have been going through? How narcissistic of me to think I can come here and make a difference because I\u2019m good at my sport?\u201d\u2018 Wade said. \u201cI remember walking slowly to the cafeteria. As I was walking in, students started seeing me, started seeing smiles, people running, pulling out their phones. \u201cAnd I remember thinking, `Wow,\u201d\u2018 Wade said. Wade has spoken of that day often and has remained an advocate of improved school safety. One of the shooting victims, Joaquin Oliver, was a huge fan of the three-time NBA champion and was buried in a Wade jersey. Wade closed his remarks by asking those in attendance to join him in a cheer that he used to spur on the Miami Heat in the 2013 NBA Finals, something he borrowed from one of his favorite films, \u201cRed Tails,\u201d which tells the story of the Tuskegee Airmen during World War II. He would lead the Heat in the cheer, punctuated by the words \u201cto the last man, to the last minute, to the last second, we fight! We fight! We fight!\u201d And once he led the graduates and their guests in the cheer Sunday, he wrapped up his speech by again saying \u201cMSD Strong\u201d \u2014 the school\u2019s mantra since the tragedy."},{"id":33429,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/adam-silver-podcastone-sports-now-advice-zion","date":"2019-06-02","title":"Silver reveals he's given advice to Zion Williamson","content":" TORONTO (AP) \u2014 NBA Commissioner Adam Silver says he has already offered presumed No. 1 overall draft pick Zion Williamson advice on enjoying the process of entering the league.

Andre Iguodala is suddenly an unlikely candidate for Most Important Player in a series the Raptors lead 1-0. The Warriors are bracing for a strong Game 2 response from Kawhi Leonard, who by his own postseason standards played meekly in the series opener. It is Iguodala who represents the front line of defense for Kawhi, it is Iguodala who isn\u2019t completely healthy, and it is Iguodala who is now 35 and not quite the same force who made LeBron work the last four Junes and earned Finals MVP honors mostly for that defense in 2015. With the Warriors preparing to play yet another game without Kevin Durant, there\u2019s a burden and a large responsibility placed on Iguodala, whose minutes and production must rise. He wouldn\u2019t be in this position with a healthy Durant. In that scenario, Durant would play nearly 40 minutes and draw a good portion of the Kawhi assignment and Iguodala would come off the bench. Things changed. And Durant isn\u2019t returning from his strained calf until Game 3, if that. And the Warriors are fearful of falling behind 2-0 and allowing the Raptors to take momentum to Oakland. Which means they could use a bit of 2015 from Iguodala. \u201cI\u2019m older,\u201d Iguodala said, with a grin. \u201cBut I hope everything else is up to par.\u201d He anticipates what everyone anticipates: Kawhi turning up a notch in Game 2 by attacking more. Kawhi might need to, unless Pascal Siakam is headed for another 32-point, 14-for-17 shooting game (perhaps unlikely) or the Warriors keep giving Marc Gasol a ton of open looks (also unlikely). In the absence of those repeat performances, it\u2019ll be up to Kawhi to develop a more aggressive mentality \u2014 similar to the one he kept in the first three playoff rounds when he bulldozed through Orlando, Philly and Milwaukee \u2014 to help the Raptors seize control of this series. The Warriors, based on their Game 1 strategy, have decided to prevent Kawhi from beating them. Which means the task of guarding him will be done largely by committee and with as many different looks as possible. It will be done with a combination of players with toughness (Draymond Green), 1-on-1 tenacity (Klay Thompson) and length (Iguodala). \u201cHe\u2019s a special player who has shown what he\u2019s capable of doing if given the opportunity,\u201d said Iguodala. \u201cHe\u2019s been able to do damage from the perimeter, get to the basket, shoot the ball at a high clip. \u201cHe has all the tricks to keep you guessing and try to throw you off balance. You\u2019re not going to stop players like that, but make him spend as much energy as possible.\u201d When Kawhi stares at the double-teams, the one constant face will belong to Iguodala, and it has been a strange trip for the 15-year veteran. Iguodala is a self-made defender, one who grew into that role gradually after spending his first seven seasons as a primary scorer with the Sixers. As he became older and wiser, his impact spread; Iguodala developed his passing and rebounding instincts, both above-average for a small forward, to balance his scoring. Once he joined the Warriors, his scoring average dropped almost every season, to the point where Iguodala, who once averaged 19.9 points in a season, is an almost reluctant shooter who only takes aim when absolutely necessary. His defense became his trademark and, because of his ability to defend multiple positions, the Warriors assigned him to the other team\u2019s biggest challenge. Coach Steve Kerr often singles out Iguodala as the smartest player on the team. And Iguodala\u2019s watershed moment came during the 2015 Finals, when he was inserted into the starting lineup and held LeBron below 40-percent shooting, critical to the Warriors\u2019 first title under Kerr. Iguodala, it seemed, could defend anyone except Father Time, and this season he averaged just 23 minutes a night partly because Kerr was fearful of putting more mileage than necessary on Iguodala\u2019s limbs. This was the correct strategy, because during these playoffs, Iguodala regained his bounce and compensated for the loss of Durant by playing smart defense on James Harden and then providing help on Damian Lillard. But this latest test is on another level, especially with Iguodala dealing with an aching quad that benched him for one game in the conference finals. \u201cYou\u2019ve got injuries and pain but you play through it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s your job to help the team win. And against Kawhi, you\u2019ve got to be locked in mentally. It\u2019s always difficult going against top players even if you\u2019re completely healthy, so you don\u2019t complain. It\u2019s business as usual.\u201d Iguodala said Kawhi had en effective game despite scoring just 23 points in Game 1 \u2014 seven below his playoff average. \u201cHe was able to make the right passes out of the traps, found Gasol a few times,\u201d said Iguodala. \u201cFor us, it\u2019s just our backline defense, being able to rotate when he throws it to the open man. \u201cThat\u2019s when you have a special player, someone who can draw two players on him constantly. It\u2019s kind of a game of chess we\u2019re playing against him.\u201d Although LeBron is the superior player from an offensive standpoint, especially with volume shooting and passing, Iguodala believes Kawhi demands the same level of respect. \u201cThey\u2019re two very tough players to guard, especially with their strength and ability to impose their will,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to have the right mindset. They both have their own touch that makes their game special, LeBron with his passing ability and making his teammates effective on the perimeter, Kawhi with his ability to get to this spots in the midrange, get to the basket and draw the foul. It\u2019s a different type of look. But it\u2019s tough as well.\u201d These are new times for the Warriors. They\u2019ve never started on the road in The Finals, never trailed by two games (which would be the case if they lose Sunday), and are playing a team other than Cleveland and therefore dealing with an unfamiliar foe. Green had a rough Game 1, with poor decisions and more fouls than baskets and Siakam\u2019s showing. Thompson floated in and out of shooting rhythm. DeMarcus Cousins was understandably rusty. And, of course, no Durant. All of the above can and must change (with the exception of Durant) if the Warriors hope to achieve their goal of taking at least one game in Toronto. And yet Kawhi could also figure out the Warriors\u2019 traps and schemes. That leaves Golden State on guard, quite literally, with Iguodala. The toughest task in The Finals begins with him; how will it end? \u201cYou take the challenge each game,\u201d he said, \u201cand hope it brings the confidence that you can do some good.\u201d * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

Fred VanVleet, the Toronto Raptors backup point guard who has shot 15-for-21 from 3-point range over the four games since his second child \u2014 Fred Jr. \u2014 was born, had some remarkable results in Game 1 of The Finals against Golden State Warriors star Stephen Curry. The two-time Kia MVP scored just four points and shot 1-for-6 from the field when VanVleet was his defender, a matchup that went on for 33 possessions during Toronto\u2019s 118-109 victory . On 47 possessions against other Toronto defenders, Curry scored 30 points. The VanVleet-guarding-Curry numbers were similar to those from the one regular-season game that Curry played against the Raptors. In that Dec. 12, 20-point victory for Toronto, Curry scored just 10 points, and he had just four points on 39 possessions with VanVleet guarding him. So is VanVleet the Curry stopper? Not really. He definitely deserves some of the credit for Curry\u2019s lack of scoring on those specific possessions. He\u2019s able to navigate screens better than most and he doesn\u2019t lose track of Curry when he\u2019s moving without the ball. But defending Curry, as was the case with Giannis Antetokounmpo in the conference finals , is a five-man job for Toronto. And while Curry scored much more prolifically when other Raptors were defending him, a second look at the film from Game 1 makes it clear that VanVleet couldn\u2019t have slowed him down without a lot of help from those same teammates. Just a few seconds after checking into the game for the first time, VanVleet actually lost Curry for a split second \u2026 and got away with it. After running a pick-and-roll out of the corner and drawing help from Marc Gasol, Curry gave up the ball and VanVleet got caught with his head turned the wrong way\u2026               Draymond Green found Curry relocating in the corner before VanVleet could recover, but Curry\u2019s corner three rimmed out. It\u2019s a shot he normally knocks down.               Late in the first half, VanVleet tried to pick Curry\u2019s pocket in the backcourt\u2026               Curry avoided the steal and took off. Gasol tried to pick him up out at the 3-point line, but Curry drove past him and drew a foul. Because Gasol was guarding Curry for more time than VanVleet was, that possession got credited to the Raptors\u2019 center, rather than the guy who made the mistake in the backcourt, in the matchup data.               Warriors head coach Steve Kerr quoted the movie \u201cHoosiers\u201d before Game 1, talking about the height of the rims, etc. There was another scene in that movie in which coach Norman Dale, in instructing one of his players how to defend the other team\u2019s leading scorer, says, \u201cThink of him as chewing gum. By the end of the game, I want you to know what flavor he is.\u201d VanVleet seemed to have received similar instructions from Raptors coach Nick Nurse. And aside from the two mistakes noted above, VanVleet was able to stay in front of Curry when he wasn\u2019t screened. And when Curry was off the ball, VanVleet didn\u2019t lose his focus.                He didn\u2019t fall for Curry slipping a ball screen and, when he wasn\u2019t screened himself, denied Curry the ball\u2026                When Curry tried to get a quick-hitting pull-up via a screen from Kevon Looney midway through the third quarter, VanVleet faught over the screen to contest the shot from behind and Serge Ibaka stepped up to keep him from getting off a clean look\u2026                Of course, the Warriors, at times, used VanVleet\u2019s reluctance to leave Curry to their advantage. Defending the champs is plugging one hole and creating a leak somewhere else. Shooters make the best screeners, and late in the third quarter, Curry got Shaun Livingston a layup by setting a back-screen on Pascal Siakam, with VanVleet unwilling to leave his man\u2026               Here\u2019s the play in live action:               A couple of minutes later, VanVleet chased Curry around a double pin-down screen, Danny Green hedged out to help, and Green\u2019s man (Alfonzo McKinnie) got a wide-open three in the opposite corner . When Curry checked back in during the fourth quarter, he was triple-teamed when curling off another pin-down screen and had to give it up to Kevon Looney on a roll to the basket. The undersized Kyle Lowry fouled Looney, who made 1 of 2 free throws. There were some occasions when the Warriors were able to take advantage of the Raptors\u2019 help on Curry. But there were other occasions when that help was critical to the Raptors getting a stop. Gasol forced two turnovers in the second quarter \u2013 with a deflection and by forcing a jump ball when he picked up Curry after VanVleet ran into a screen.                             Lowry, meanwhile, was usually ready with help from wherever he was on the floor. Midway through the second quarter, Draymond Green knocked VanVleet off the play in the backcourt. And when Kawhi Leonard stepped up to stop the ball, Curry got around him. But at the last second, Lowry helped off Andre Iguodala and contested Curry\u2019s drive (getting away with a foul, perhaps)\u2026               Later in the second quarter, Siakam picked up Curry after another Green screen in the backcourt. When Curry fed Green going downhill, Lowry helped off Iguodala again and drew a charge.               There\u2019s a general principle in this league that you don\u2019t help off the strong-side corner. But Lowry does it quite often. It\u2019s one reason why he\u2019s drawn 15 charges in these playoffs (more than twice as many as any other player). It\u2019s also a reason why the Raptors will sometimes get burned on wide-open, strong-side corner threes (like this one from George Hill when Lowry tried to draw a charge on Khris Middleton). The Raptors want to protect the basket, first and foremost. And Nurse trusts his point guard to make the right decision in that regard. \u201cHe\u2019s a very instinctual player,\u201d Nurse said of Lowry on Friday. \u201cA lot of plays in the game out there, there are so many things going on that are more instinctual probably than they are some unbelievable design. So, yeah, we always say \u2018know your personnel and if there\u2019s a problem, try to go fix it.\u2019 He\u2019s really good at that. A really good problem solver on the help defenses.\u201d In regard to Lowry\u2019s help off the corner, the \u201cknow your personnel\u201d part could apply to the player with the ball, like when he drew a charge on Jayson Tatum (an inexperienced playmaker) in a big spot back in October. It could also apply to the player that Lowry\u2019s leaving alone in the corner. Iguodala is a 41 percent 3-point shooter from the corners, though not the most willing player to consistently let it fly off a kick-out. With VanVleet in the game and guarding Curry, Lowry is allowed to be more of an instinctual helper. And in 21 minutes with both Lowry and VanVleet on the floor in Game 1, the Warriors scored just 40 points on 46 offensive possessions . With the two-point-guard lineup working for the Raptors, VanVleet never checked out after entering the game in either half. He played more than 33 minutes for the third straight game (after never playing that much in any of the Raptors first 16 playoff games), and in the 25.4 minutes that both he and Curry were on the floor , he was the Raptor guarding the two-time MVP, unless there was a cross-match in transition. That will likely be the case again in Game 2 on Sunday ( 8 ET, ABC ). And while VanVleet is the Raptors\u2019 best option for defending Curry, he can\u2019t do it alone. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

There\u2019s no LeBron James. And Canadian numbers don\u2019t count. ESPN said Friday that the Game 1 of the Toronto-Golden State series drew a 10.1 overnight rating, the lowest for Game 1 of a title series in a decade \u2014 though all the numbers come with a serious catch. Canadian viewership does not count toward the metered-market ratings formula used in the U.S., and it was the most-watched NBA game in Canada\u2019s history. \u201cPut aside perception, there is the actuality of the ratings,\u201d NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said Friday. \u201cOf course, I pay a lot of attention to those. I also pay a lot of attention to the numbers in Canada, where we set an all-time record for viewership. In the U.S., I recognize it\u2019s a changing television marketplace. We knew we would be down a bit by virtue of both not having two U.S. markets and we\u2019ve come off eight years of having LeBron James in the finals.\u201d Meanwhile, the first finals game for a Canadian team was a smash north of the border. It was the most-watched NBA game on Sportsnet, reaching 7.4 million Canadians \u2014 basically 20 percent of the nation\u2019s population. The average size of the Canadian audience, Sportsnet said, was 3.3 million viewers and peaked in the final minutes of the game with 4.1 million Canadians tuning in to see the finish. Ratings throughout the playoffs have been down in the NBA, with James and the Los Angeles Lakers not making the playoffs surely a major factor. \u201cI\u2019m not overly concerned,\u201d Silver said about the current numbers. \u201cBut I\u2019m certainly paying attention to it.\u201d"},{"id":33398,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/cam-reddish-core-muscle-injury","date":"2019-05-31","title":"Report: Duke's Reddish to undergo surgery ahead of NBA Draft","content":" A player widely predicted to be among the Top 10 picks in the upcoming NBA Draft is reportedly undergoing a surgical procedure just three weeks prior to draft day.

Losing the opener was a tradition for this franchise \u2014 they were 3-15 in Game 1s prior to Thursday, dating back to their inaugural playoff run in 2000. Nothing shoves a team closer to elimination in a best-of-seven showdown than a lousy start. * The Wrap:  Complete Game 1 coverage That\u2019s why grabbing the opener against Golden State was so essential. Had the Raptors squandered their home-court advantage on the first night, we all would be assuming the worst for these Finals in competitive, stylistic and entertainment terms. Only by rocking the Warriors in Game 1 \u2014 and most impressively, by refusing to cough up all of their 12-point lead in the second half \u2014 could the Raptors generate legitimate excitement for Game 2 and beyond. Had we all been honest (and able to pull this off), we would have begun this series by spotting Toronto to a 1-0 lead \u2014 just to handicap the defending champions and force them to show us something they haven\u2019t in their four previous Finals trips. But such a move would have been demeaning, of course, to the Raptors. Instead, coach Nick Nurse and his affable newbies seized early control themselves. How Portland looked in the Western Conference finals, as if the Trail Blazers had maxed out and were just happy to still be involved? Toronto wanted none of that. It found a way to win when Kawhi Leonard and Kyle Lowry were ordinary at best. And now we have a series worthy of the Larry O\u2019Brien Trophy. It\u2019s fun as a game progresses to track stats, whether it\u2019s Pascal Siakam\u2019s absurd 11 consecutive field goals or Stephen Curry\u2019s refusal to miss a free throw. We\u2019re always aware of the leading scorer and his growing point total, particularly as it passes the big round numbers (30, 40, 50\u2026). But Draymond Green\u2019s latest triple-double was a reminder that the bar has been set too low for that stat from its inception. Green finished with 10 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists, which makes it a minimalist\u2019s triple-double at best and more of a statistical fluke than an achievement. Ten assists? That\u2019s strong any night. Ten rebounds? Solid, and necessary if no one else on your roster is claiming more than six. Ten points, though? Come on now. Green had a Jason Kidd triple-double, which isn\u2019t mean to disparage the Hall of Fame point guard but speaks to Kidd\u2019s limitations as a scorer for most of his career. Heck, the Warriors\u2019 versatile forward had six turnovers, inspiring the bad \u201cquadruple-double watch\u201d that Kidd sparked on occasion. What Green didn\u2019t do was put the ball through the net effectively, shooting 2-for-9 overall and 0-for-2 on 3-pointers. Yes, his value to Golden State usually doesn\u2019t rise or fall on his scoring, but he could have been more helpful in that area Thursday. When Oscar Robertson averaged a triple-double in 1961-62 (and cumulatively did it over his first six NBA seasons), he was scoring 30 points per game. When Russell Westbrook matched what had been a rare feat two years ago , he too was up above 30 points nightly. But Westbrook has done it the past two seasons as well , with his scoring average dipping below 23 this season. That would seem to be near the minimum \u2014 say, 20 points \u2014 to gush over a player\u2019s triple-double on a given night. We get it, double figures means 10 or more. But 10 points is no big deal at all in the NBA, so it seems silly to celebrate it when it\u2019s the free rider on the triple-double quirk. Warriors coach Steve Kerr admitted after Game 1 that, by mistake more than by design, his team didn\u2019t defensively do its job well in the early minutes against center Marc Gasol. \u201cGasol we left a couple times early in the game and didn\u2019t rotate, we just gave him a couple of dare shots and he knocked them down,\u201d Kerr said. Daring is not defending, and the Warriors would be well-advised not to do that again to a player as proud and as accomplished as Gasol. He\u2019s struggled at times as a shooter in these playoffs, shooting 34 percent in the Eastern Conference finals while going 2-for-9 on 3-pointers in Games 1 and 2 of that series (both losses). It was embarrassing at times to see the affable 7-1 Spaniard miss shots badly, whether he felt that way or not. But Gasol was 10-for-20 on 3-pointers entering The Finals, all during the Raptors\u2019 four consecutive victories to eliminate the Bucks. He went 2-for-4 in Game 1 of The Finals, scoring a playoff-high 20 points to help compensate for Leonard\u2019s and Lowry\u2019s muted firepower. Asked about it afterward, on taking such a \u201cdare\u201d personally, the big man shrugged. \u201cIf you\u2019re open, you got to shoot them. Dare, no dare,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then we go from there. If they go in, great. If not you keep taking them with confidence.\u201d That\u2019s speaking truth to a dare. \u2026 if they can somehow count the number of times the Warriors and the Raptors watch and re-watch the video tape. A big theme heading into this series was the relative lack of familiarity the teams had with each other. Now, that\u2019s a common aspect of The Finals, pitting the champs of opposite conferences and all. But given Golden State\u2019s knowledge of the Cleveland Cavaliers after four consecutive Finals, Toronto is a relative stranger. Beyond that, key players from both sides were absent in the two regular-season meetings. But now they have a whole 48 minutes to dissect, digest and learn from. For the Warriors, who spoke about it the most, they saw things they might not have expected and things they definitely did not like. Such as? Try Siakam\u2019s attacks on the basket (in transition and otherwise), their own inability to be the team that pushes pace and Fred VanVleet as the game\u2019s essential reserve (15 points on a night when his 3-point shot was MIA). Green, in particular, sounded as if he was going to binge-watch Siakam\u2019s romp and figure a way to thwart the unorthodox flip shots the forward from Cameroon deployed. \u201cHe\u2019s become \u2018a guy,\u2019\u201d Green said phrasing that as a nod of respect. \u201cHe put a lot of work into get there and I respect that. But like I said, I got to take him out of the series and that\u2019s on me.\u201d Toronto can make use of the video for as long as the Warriors roster stays the way it is, which means sans Kevin Durant. Which leads into \u2026 (And no, we don\u2019t mean LeBron James.) Durant\u2019s continued absence with a calf injury since Game 5 of the Western Conference semifinals became an official problem in Game 1 of The Finals (the team\u2019s first loss without him). Questions that had been bottled up for a couple weeks \u2014 What did you miss most without Durant? How might he have changed your offense or defense? \u2014 came spilling out from the large media crew that covers the NBA\u2019s glamour team. Neither Kerr nor his players took the bait, which was smart. Not only would it look like excuse-making (considering how they hadn\u2019t needed those before), it might have opened a crack of vulnerability into something wider and more troublesome. Durant is out for Game 2, but per a Yahoo Sports report Friday is expected back at the series\u2019 midway point (read: Game 3 or Game 4).  \u201cKD\u2019s an all-time great player on both ends of the floor,\u201d Curry said, \u201cso I could sit here and talk for days about what he adds to our roster. We obviously have proven that when he\u2019s out we can have guys step up, and that\u2019s going to be the case until he gets back.\u201d Rushing him back would seem desperate, something the Warriors aren\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t be. Plus, it is early in a long series. And it really is irrelevant: NBA players and teams\u2019 medical staffs don\u2019t \u201crush back\u201d anyone these days. Then again, once they\u2019re ready to play \u2014 as Golden State showed in using DeMarcus Cousins in Game 1 \u2014 there\u2019s no sense in letting talent help languish in street clothes. No time too, either. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

Forward Kevin Durant, who has been out of the Warriors\u2019 lineup since May 8 with a right calf strain, is expected to return to the mix midway through The Finals per Chris Haynes of Yahoo Sports . When, exactly, Durant will return is unknown, but Haynes reports there is some optimism within the organization that he could play in Game 3. However, the stronger possibility \u2014 per Haynes \u2014 is that Game 4 of the series is the most logical option as to when Durant would return. Games 3 and 4 of The Finals will be in Oakland, with Game 3 on June 5 ( 9 ET, ABC ) and Game 4 on June 7 ( 9 ET, ABC ). Durant has about three or four days of on-court work under his belt, Haynes reports, and his teammates have been encouraged by his progress. Additionally, the franchise does not foresee a scenario in which Durant would be completely unable to play in The Finals, Haynes reports. Connor LeTourneau of the San Francisco Chronicle reported Friday morning that the Warriors are optimistic about Durant\u2019s return, but have \u201cno idea\u201d when he\u2019ll actually suit up . However, Warriors coach Steve Kerr confirmed at Friday\u2019s media availability that Durant is definitely out for Game 2 of the series. \u201cKevin is not going to play Sunday,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cHe\u2019s not practicing today. We\u2019ll have a practice tomorrow and he\u2019s still progressing. But it\u2019s near impossible for him to play on Sunday.\u201d When asked about Durant playing sooner than expected, Kerr reiterated that the Warriors will not put Durant back into the lineup until he\u2019s fully healthy. \u201cThe thinking is when he\u2019s ready to play, he\u2019ll play. It\u2019s not like this is a sore ankle or his knee is sore and you can play through it. This is a tricky one,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cIf you re-injure the calf that that\u2019s it, he\u2019s done for the series. When he\u2019s ready to play he\u2019ll play, that\u2019s our approach. Before Game 1, Warriors coach Steve Kerr said Thursday that Durant was a \u201clong shot\u201d to play in Sunday\u2019s Game 2 ( 8 ET, ABC ). Kerr wants Durant to complete a full practice on either Friday or Saturday before allowing him to play, which, at this point, seems like a difficult proposition to Kerr. The Warriors\u2019 depth was tested in Game 1 and star guard Stephen Curry knows he and his teammates must not use Durant\u2019s absence as an excuse in The Finals. \u201cKD\u2019s an all-time great player on both ends of the floor, so I could sit here and talk for days about what he adds to our roster,\u201d Curry said after Game 1. \u201cWe obviously have proven that when he\u2019s out, we can have guys step up and that\u2019s going to be the case until he gets back.\u201d Forward Andre Iguodala started in Durant\u2019s place in Game 1 of The Finals, finishing with six points on 3-for-7 shooting as well as six rebounds, seven assists, two turnovers and a blocked shot. He appeared to hobble off the court in the final two minutes of Game 1, but did not sound worried about his injury on Thursday night. Kerr said Friday that he spoke with Iguodala, who had an MRI on his left leg, and neither he nor his veteran forward were fretting the injury. Per the Warriors, Iguodala\u2019s MRI came back clean and he is expected to play in Game 2. https:\/\/www.nba.com\/2019-finals-game1-the-wrap \u201cI\u2019ll be all right. Just bumps and bruises of the game,\u201d Iguodala told reporters after Game 1, per The Mercury News . \u201cYou can paint it as an excuse, but you have to keep going.\u201d With Game 3 in Oakland next week, Golden State will have a travel day (Monday) and a practice day (Tuesday) that could help in Durant\u2019s recovery timeline. Durant flew with the team to Toronto to continue his rehab work while also being around for team activities and meetings. \u201cIt\u2019s good to have Kevin here. Obviously he\u2019s a huge part of our team and the guys are all pulling for him,\u201d Kerr said Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s such a privilege to be here and play in the NBA Finals for all of these guys. You grow up dreaming about this that you hate that anybody is injured. You want everybody to be healthy and have a lot more opportunity. More than anything, we want Kevin to be healthy, be back and enjoy at least part of the series. He\u2019s pretty good. It wouldn\u2019t hurt to have him back.\u201d Durant, the two-time reigning Finals MVP, has missed the past six games since getting hurt in Game 5 of the Western Conference semifinals against Houston. An impending free agent this summer, he was hurt May 8 when he landed awkwardly on his right foot following a baseline jumper late in the third quarter of a 104-99 victory over the Rockets at Oracle Arena.

Iguodala did not appear fine when the play happened. After making a floating hook shot to trim Toronto\u2019s lead to 111-103 with 1 minute, 55 seconds left, Iguodala came down on his right leg. As he ran up court, he appeared to wince and limped toward the other end of the court. Warriors forward Draymond Green fouled the Raptors\u2019 Fred VanVleet with 1:19 left, leading to Kerr subbing out Iguodala for Alfonzo McKinnie. In the Warriors\u2019 Game 3 win against the Portland Trail Blazers in the Western Conference finals, Iguodala said he felt tightness in his left calf. He sat with 7:50 left in the third quarter of that game and missed all of the Warriors\u2019 series-clinching win in Game 4. Iguodala, like the rest of the Warriors, had nine days to rest up and heal before the start of The Finals. Mark Medina of The Mercury News reports Iguodala is likely to receive treatment for his injury during the team\u2019s off day on Friday and should practice Saturday. In Game 1 of The Finals, Iguodala started and finished with six points on 3-for-7 shooting as well as six rebounds, seven assists, two turnovers and a blocked shot. Golden State is already thin in the frontcourt as star forward Kevin Durant missed Game 1 and, per Kerr, was a \u201clong shot\u201d to play in Sunday\u2019s Game 2 ( 8 ET, ABC ).

However you spell it, Raptors brought it","content":"TORONTO  \u2014 The Raptors weren\u2019t aided by help from the hyper and chilly residents of \u2018Jurassic Park\u2019 huddled outside Scotiabank Arena, or the entire country of Canada, or a certain courtside rapper who gets fidgety after the ball goes up. It only seemed that way each time one of the Golden State Warriors had the ball Thursday and looked up to see a swarm. And so the start of The Finals was known for a stop. Plenty of them, actually. The two-time defending champs were effectively defended in Game 1 \u2014 hounded, pressed, pestered and essentially handled in a way they haven\u2019t seen this postseason. Here in The North they spell it \u2018defence\u2019 and the Raptors played it to near perfection in their 118-109 victory , triggering a detectable amount of intrigue to start the series. \u201cTheir defense was great and it wasn\u2019t our night,\u201d Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. \u201cThey deserved to win and we\u2019ve got to play better if we\u2019re going to beat them. They\u2019re long and athletic, they get after you and they play well together.\u201d The first peek at the strategies and developments of The Finals were revealing and perhaps dropped hints of what\u2019s to come. The Warriors will force Kawhi Leonard to surrender the ball and take their chances with his teammates. That gamble made sense \u2026 and it backfired when Marc Gasol (20 points) hit open jumpers, and especially when Pascal Siakam assumed the Kawhi role , making 14 of 17 shots for 32 points. \u201cIf you watched the previous series against Portland, they did the same with Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum, so we assumed there was a chance they were going to blitz Kawhi,\u201d Gasol said. It was a matter of players assuming larger roles and coming through for Toronto. But will Gasol, timid through much of the postseason, stay this aggressive and effective? And can Siakam, a late bloomer from Cameroon who had a breakout season, keep having this level of success against Draymond Green, the self-proclaimed Greatest Defensive Player Of All Time? Instead, what could determine the outcome is Toronto\u2019s ability to keep the Warriors, and especially Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson, from causing damage. Because the Raptors fully know that Curry and Thompson, racing off screens and constantly being fed by their teammates, represent the engine of the offense. Plus, Kevin Durant is reportedly expected to return sometime at the series\u2019 midway point \u2014 Game 3 or 4, basically. This sense of scoring vulnerability minus Durant didn\u2019t cause the Warriors any grief in their final game against the Rockets in the second round or at any point against the Blazers. But those teams don\u2019t offer the same level of resistance as Toronto, and that could make all the difference. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a lot of versatility,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cI think they\u2019re actually a lot like our team. They can switch and guard different positions. So they did a really good job.\u201d The Warriors were frazzled. For much of the game, they shot 40 percent. They coughed up 17 turnovers, which cost them 17 points, mostly on fast breaks where Siakam flourished as a finisher. While the Warriors trailed by 17 twice and 18 once in the Western Conference finals, the Raptors never allowed them to scrap back into the game. Toronto never eased up defensively, never became victims of the kind of harsh responses and blizzard runs Golden State does that steal the soul of opposing teams. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to continue to play defense throughout the game,\u201d said Raptors coach Nick Nurse, \u201ceven when you\u2019re trying really hard and they will come down and make you look silly.\u201d Kawhi is an aggressive and pressing man-to-man defender who can shut down bigger players and quicker players, but he isn\u2019t the only Raptor who brings impressive defensive credentials. Gasol was voted the league\u2019s top defender in 2013 and hasn\u2019t forgotten much since. He caused shots to be diverted or bypassed when various Warriors ventured into the paint and came up with a pair of steals. Siakam is rubbery and long and uses that reach to block shots; he had two. Fred VanVleet has the toughest assignment \u2014 Curry is his main concern \u2014 and made the former two-time Kia MVP work up a sweat. And there\u2019s Danny Green \u2014 check the film when he guarded LeBron James in The Finals of 2013 and \u201914 \u2014 willing and able to slow the roll of most shooters. What the Raptors did was throw traps for Curry and Thompson but also rotate swiftly enough when others were open as a result. Problem for the Warriors is they didn\u2019t have a \u201cstep-up\u201d player in the mold of Gasol or Siakam. They had Draymond Green, who was sloppy and reckless, with six turnovers along with seven misses in nine shot attempts. Green appeared thrown, totally unlike his dominant showing against the Trail Blazers. Andre Iguodala missed all four of his 3-pointers \u2014 and all four were wide open \u2014 then appeared to re-injure his leg late in the game. Finally, there was DeMarcus Cousins, playing his first game in two months after resting his injured quad. As expected for someone who only had a few full reps in practice, Cousins was rusty, unsure and struggled with his confidence. He forced the issue a few times and bypassed shots on others in his eight minutes. All of this played right into the Raptors\u2019 greedy hands and allowed them to take a rare game when neither Leonard nor Kyle Lowry, who combined for seven baskets, were big factors. In that sense, this was sort of a bonus win. The Raptors now know who can rise up when Kawhi surrenders the ball. Siakam will either win the Kia Most Improved Player Award this season or come close \u2014 he was that much of a revelation after developing into a dependable No. 2 scoring option. What was impressive in Game 1 was his composure on such a big stage. Draymond Green gave a \u201cmy bad\u201d reaction for his work on Siakam, which came one day after Green puffed up his own defensive credentials in historic terms. So his timing was faulty, too. \u201cI\u2019ve got to do a better job of taking his rhythm away,\u201d Green said, \u201cand I will. That\u2019s on me.\u201d How far has Siakam come from when he was a raw, unknown prospect six years ago from the Basketball Without Borders program? He now has his own logo. As for the Warriors, this was the first time they missed Durant in earnest. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter until he\u2019s out there,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cIf he\u2019s not out there, we play with the guys we have, and we have got enough. We\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d They claim to be unmoved by the opener, even though they\u2019re down 1-0 in The Finals for the first time in the Kerr era. Maybe there are reasons for this: They had a nine-day break and were perhaps rusty; they aren\u2019t too familiar with the Raptors; they just won five straight without Durant; it was just one of those nights. Curry said: \u201cWe\u2019ve proven our resiliency and ability to win games we need to. Our confidence remains the same.\u201d Green said: \u201cNow that we\u2019ve got a feel for them, we have a tape to watch. We know what we can do better. I like where we\u2019re at. We leave this game feeling as good as you can possibly feel, knowing that, yeah, we lost, but I think we figured some things out, and we\u2019ll be better next game.\u201d Yet maybe the Raptors will, too. This wasn\u2019t exactly a must-have game for Toronto, but it was much needed. This was the first NBA Finals game in Canada, played before a city swelling with basketball pride, backed by much of \u2014 if not the entire \u2014 country, and inside a sold-out arena where the fans only took a few breaths. This win was a confidence builder and could only serve to fortify and intensify Game 2. If it\u2019ll require two wins for the Raptors to sense, deep in their hearts, that they can win this series, then they\u2019re halfway there.

In their first NBA Finals appearance, the Raptors handed Golden State their first Game 1 defeat in these five straight trips to the championship round. With five Raptors in double figures, Toronto had its second-best shooting game of this postseason (59.1 percent effective field goal percentage). And one stat stood out from the rest as the Raptors took a 1-0 series lead with a 118-109 victory . 82.4 percent \u2014 Pascal Siakam\u2019s field-goal percentage in Game 1. Siakam\u2019s 14-for-17 on Thursday was the best shooting game (regular season or playoffs) against the Warriors on at least 15 field goal attempts over these five years they\u2019ve been going to The Finals. That\u2019s 838 total instances of a player taking at least 15 shots against Golden State, and Siakam now stands atop the peak. Most of Siakam\u2019s damage was done down low. His 18 points in the paint weren\u2019t a high-water mark for these playoffs; he had 20 in two different games against the Orlando Magic in the first round. But here they accounted for almost half of the Raptors\u2019 total (40) and more than half of what the Warriors amassed (32). Both teams were shooting jumpers early. In fact, the Raptors\u2019 first 11 shots came from outside the paint. They made four of their first nine 3-point attempts, but scoring that way wasn\u2019t sustainable. The Warriors weren\u2019t going to let Kawhi Leonard beat them off the dribble, trapping him in pick and rolls and even sending a second defender at him on various isolations. So Siakam stepped up his aggressiveness and attacked 1-on-1. Siakam took advantage of some resulting mismatches. His first bucket came when he backed down Stephen Curry. He drained a couple of open 3-pointers when the Golden State defense collapsed on a teammate\u2019s drive. And he scored almost as many points in the first six seconds of the shot clock (11 on 5-for-5 shooting) as the Warriors did as a team (13). But Siakam also wasn\u2019t afraid to attack one of the league\u2019s best defenders one-on-one. According to Second Spectrum tracking, Siakam scored 16 of his 32 points with Draymond Green as his defender. He was 4-for-4 at the rim when a Warriors defender was there to protect it, according to Second Spectrum. In total, he shot 9-for-10 in the paint and 5-for-7 from the outside. Siakam\u2019s 32 total points marked the fourth-highest scoring game of his career (247 total games). He was the first player to score at least 30 points on 80 percent shooting or better in a Finals game since Shaquille O\u2019Neal did it in 2004. And his 11 consecutive field goals were the most in any NBA Finals game during the last 20 seasons, ahead of a four-way tie between LeBron James, Tim Duncan, Kobe Bryant and yes, Shaq. It was an SLN (Shaq-like-numbers) night for the Kia Most Improved Player Award favorite, and a performance unlike anything else these Warriors have allowed. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

Game 1 between the Warriors and the Raptors, after all, marked the first Finals game ever played outside the United States. Silver talked at length about the NBA\u2019s history in and connections to Canada \u2014 Dr. James Naismith hailed from Ontario before inventing the game back in 1891, and what\u2019s considered the first NBA game was played in 1946 between the Knicks and the Huskies in Toronto. Then he fielded a series of questions about basketball\u2019s growth across borders, from Europe to China to Africa and beyond. \u201cI think symbolically,\u201d Silver said, \u201chaving our first Finals outside the United States maybe has a big impact on countries that follow the NBA but don\u2019t have teams, whether that be in Asia or whether that be in Latin America. So I think as we look back in time at the NBA calendar, I mean, this clearly is a marker of sorts.\u201d Within the maple-leaf context of Games 1 and 2 of these Finals, there is an international flavor to the teams involved. The Warrrios have Andrew Bogut (Australia) and Jonas Jerebko (Sweden) while the Raptors feature Pascal Siakam (Cameroon), Serge Ibaka (Republic of Congo), OG Anunoby (UK), Marc Gasol (Spain) and Chris Boucher (Canada). Masai Ujiri, Toronto\u2019s president of basketball operations, is a native of Nigeria. Of Africa specifically, Silver said: \u201cI think it absolutely speaks to the opportunity across [its] roughly 55 countries. I think it\u2019s one of the places we\u2019re looking in the world where we see enormous opportunity. Certainly China as well. We\u2019re opening with games in Mumbai, India for the first time next season, but in Africa we have elected to launch a league.\u201d The Basketball Africa League, with 12 teams operating in collaboration with global governing body FIBA, is scheduled to begin play in January. Qualification tournaments will be held to determine those clubs, with teams from Angola, Egypt, Kenya, Morocco, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, South Africa and Tunisia expected to take part. Silver cited digital media as propelling the sport in Africa, \u201ca continent of over a billion people, where there are something like 700 million cell phones. It\u2019s been revolutionary in terms of the people of Africa\u2019s ability to watch our games in real time on handheld devices.\u201d But wait, there\u2019s more \u2026 Silver spoke of China, where the current political issue of trade tariffs could have implications for the NBA\u2019s business. The commissioner has had multiple conversations with former Houston Rockets center Yao Ming, now chairman of the Chinese Basketball Association. \u201cThis is something Yao and I have discussed, where we can use basketball maybe in the way ping-pong was used in the days of Richard Nixon,\u201d Silver said, \u201cthat there could be something called \u2018basketball diplomacy.\u2019 \u201cAnd it is an area where our two countries have excellent history of cooperation, where we work closely with the Chinese Basketball Association on player development, referee development. The World Cup of Basketball will be staged in China in September, and before that, the Chinese national team will compete in the Las Vegas Summer League in July. Those and other initiatives presumably will spur the game\u2019s continued growth there. \u201cAlso, we are in the process of building academies in China to help develop the young players,\u201d Silver said. \u201cBecause of Yao\u2019s experience in the NBA, he sees how it\u2019s done, not just in the United States but in other places in the world. I think he understands that given the enormous number of young people, boys and girls, playing basketball, there\u2019s more that we can be doing to develop elite players.\u201d There\u2019s plenty of room, too, to grow the game in Canada. Silver didn\u2019t offer any false hope that expansion would deliver the nation\u2019s second franchise to Vancouver or Montreal anytime soon. But it wasn\u2019t lost on him that his league\u2019s Finals have taken over Toronto \u2014 while the NHL\u2019s Stanley Cup Finals (Boston-St. Louis) are being played. \u201cI\u2019m a fan,\u201d Silver said. \u201c[NHL commissioner] Gary Bettman worked at the NBA years ago when I first started, and so we\u2019re generally supportive of other sports. And the way we look at sort of NBA or our programming is that we\u2019re competing against everything else on every other channel, every other form of entertainment. So we don\u2019t necessarily focus on where hockey stands vis-a-vis the NBA. \u201cSo I\u2019m paying attention to the Stanley Cup. \u2026 It\u2019s a big country, Canada. There\u2019s plenty of opportunity.\u201d Among other topics: \u2022 Silver offered up well wishes for Cleveland Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert, still hospitalized after suffering a reported stroke Sunday in Detroit. \u2022 A question about Drake was inevitable, and Silver spoke of balancing the musical artist\u2019s unofficial status as a Raptors\u2019 \u201cambassador\u201d with the very real issue of player and coach safety on NBA courts. Drake was caught giving Toronto coach Nick Nurse a quick and unexpected neck rub during a recent game. The league office did look into the incident . \u201cWe understood that in this case, given Drake\u2019s relationship to the team, it\u2019s not the same as just any fan who happened to be courtside touching a coach,\u201d Silver said. \u201cBut I think that\u2019s an absolute bright line that we have to draw.\u201d * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

First of all, he wanted to play for a winning program. Second, he wanted to go to a place where the coaching staff could help him improve. Clarke exceeded his wildest expectations at Gonzaga. He\u2019s the latest example of the cruise-control program Mark Few has built in Spokane. These days, fans and pundits don\u2019t mention Few\u2019s name when power conference coaching jobs come open. That\u2019s because, through a combination of mining the underrated Pacific Northwest area for high school talent, recruiting internationally, and nabbing the occasional transfer like Clarke, the Bulldogs have transcended the mid-major tag their affiliation with the West Coast Conference would suggest and have earned a place among the game\u2019s elite programs. During a redshirt year in 2017-18 and his only season playing for the Zags, Clarke not only got a taste of the program\u2019s success \u2014 he made major contributions to an NCAA tournament Elite Eight run. Clarke, a 6-foot-8, 215-pound redshirt junior, put up monster numbers, leading the nation in field-goal percentage (.694) and blocked shots (117) and averaging 16.9 points and 8.6 rebounds. And then there\u2019s this: Clarke blocked the same number of shots he missed (257 of 374). How efficient is that? His season\u2019s handiwork was duly recognized \u2014 Clarke was chosen a third-team All-American, first-team All-WCC and the league\u2019s defensive player of the year and newcomer of the year. Clarke managed all that with a combination of physical gifts and mindset. With a 6-foot-10 wingspan and leaping ability \u2014 at the NBA\u2019s Chicago Combine , he finished tied for third with a standing vertical of 34.00 inches and tied for fourth with a max vert of 40.50 inches \u2014 Clarke is a fearsome shot blocker. A \u201creconsider\u201d is not an official statistic, but there\u2019s no telling how many victims of one of Clarke\u2019s rejections turned down other shots for fear of suffering the same, embarrassing fate. \u201cI\u2019ve always had great timing,\u201d Clarke says by way of explaining his prowess as a rim protector. \u201cI have a really quick jump. It was something I was good at least year. And this year, I got even better at it.\u201d Offensively, Clarke was a dunking machine and low-post operator who, per KenPom.com, made a staggering 70 percent of his two-point shots, ninth among all Division I players. For that success ratio he credits an understanding of the game and his own abilities, as well as his new teammates in Spokane. \u201cA lot of it is basketball IQ,\u201d says the native Canadian who played his high school ball in Arizona before signing with San Jose State. \u201cI\u2019ve always been somebody that didn\u2019t like forcing up bad shots. This year, I was really good at making the shots I was taking. And I had teammates who made it so the floor was spaced and I could operate inside more. And playing with good passers made it that much easier.\u201d It\u2019s the job of NBA scouts and draft analysts to pick apart a player\u2019s game and define their weaknesses. Though Clarke has been forecast as a mid first-round pick and even a lottery selection by some, everyone points to his tweener size and his lack of a consistent jump shot. But those people weren\u2019t at Gonzaga practices every day. \u201cHe has developed himself,\u201d Few said during the NCAA tournament. \u201cHe\u2019s done a great job from the time he decided to transfer \u2014 before he got up to Gonzaga \u2014 because the clips that I watched him when he was at San Jose State when my assistant Brian Michaelson brought him to me, he said, \u2018Coach, he\u2019s athletic. He has a knack for making stuff happen around the rim, but this shot is broken, and it cannot be fixed.\u2019 \u201cBy the time he got to Gonzaga I was like, \u2018I don\u2019t know about that. I think it may be okay.\u2019 And he worked extremely hard on it. Brandon did and the staff did, and now it\u2019s to the point where he can shoot the ball out at the 3.\u201d  Clarke\u2019s junior year 3-point stats were meager \u2014 4-for-15 for 26.7 percent \u2014 but are no longer relevant. He\u2019s spent every day since Gonzaga\u2019s season ended working on his jump shot and his ball handling. Clarke thinks he can guard all three frontcourt positions in the NBA, but he wants to be able to play them, too. And if a team wants to use him at the three, he knows he has to keep defenses honest by being a 3-point threat or able to score off the bounce. That was already evident to Texas Tech coach Chris Beard before his team, the eventual nation runner-up, tangled with Gonzaga in the Elite Eight. \u201cI think to say he\u2019s just an athlete is incorrect,\u201d Beard said. \u201cHe does a lot of things on both ends of the floor.\u201d Clarke\u2019s work in the gym has begun to pay dividends. \u201cI\u2019ve been shooting it really well from the NBA 3 line,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd now I feel like I can make every midrange shot I take. I\u2019m looking forward to having these shots become better weapons for me.\u201d Clarke was also third among Gonzaga players in assists, averaging nearly two a game, and third in steals. He envisions an NBA role similar to that of the player he\u2019d most like to emulate and studies often on film \u2014 Golden State\u2019s Draymond Green. \u201cHe isn\u2019t a guy that likes to force up shots,\u201d Clarke says. \u201cAnd he\u2019s a really good passer. That\u2019s the kind of stuff I can do.\u201d Clarke doesn\u2019t care where he\u2019s taken in the draft, preferring only to go to a team where he fits the system. Since transferring to Gonzaga and hitting the fast-forward button on his NBA dreams, Clarke has just enjoyed the journey. \u201cI had a really fun year,\u201d he says. \u201cThe only thing I\u2019d have changed was us going farther in the NCAA tournament. But it was a great season, and we did so much as a team. I really couldn\u2019t see it having gone any better for me.\u201d * * * Chris Dortch is the editor of the Blue Ribbon College Basketball Yearbook .

His prognosis for Game 2 of the series isn\u2019t looking much better, either. Warriors coach Steve Kerr told reporters Thursday that it is a \u201clong shot\u201d that Durant will play in Sunday\u2019s Game 2 ( 8 ET, ABC ). Kerr wants Durant to complete a full practice on either Friday or Saturday before allowing him to play, which, at this point, seems like a difficult proposition to Kerr. \u201cThe next step would be to practice with the team. But we don\u2019t know when that\u2019s going to be,\u201d Kerr said after Thursday\u2019s shootaround in Toronto . \u201cHe\u2019ll continue with the individual workouts.\u201d Game 3 of The Finals is in Oakland next Wednesday, giving Golden State a travel day (Monday) and a practice day (Tuesday) that could ease Durant\u2019s potential return to the mix. Durant flew with the team to continue his rehab work while also being around for team activities and meetings. \u201cIt\u2019s good to have Kevin here. Obviously he\u2019s a huge part of our team and the guys are all pulling for him,\u201d Kerr said Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s such a privilege to be here and play in the NBA Finals for all of these guys. You grow up dreaming about this that you hate that anybody is injured. You want everybody to be healthy and have a lot more opportunity. More than anything, we want Kevin to be healthy, be back and enjoy at least part of the series. He\u2019s pretty good. It wouldn\u2019t hurt to have him back.\u201d Durant, the two-time reigning Finals MVP who has missed the past five games since getting hurt in Game 5 of the Western Conference semifinals against Houston, has already been ruled out for Game 1 with a strained right calf. As of Tuesday, when Golden State held an optional practice before flying, he had yet to do any full-speed work on the court. He has done some shooting, Kerr said. Warriors forward Kevon Looney told Mark Medina of The Mercury News that Durant has proved valuable to the team even though he\u2019s injured. \u201cHe\u2019s been really helping us with the scouting reports and what kind of coverages we\u2019re running,\u201d Looney said. \u201cHe\u2019s here supporting us. You know he wants to be out there really badly and is working hard to get back. We want to go out there and compete for him and try to win.\u201d Durant didn\u2019t travel to Houston for Game 6 of the Western Conference semifinals or to Portland for the two road games against the Trail Blazers in the Western Conference finals. He remained in the Bay Area to rehab, and the Warriors are unbeaten without him. An impending free agent this summer, he was hurt May 8 when he landed awkwardly on his right foot following a baseline jumper late in the third quarter of a 104-99 victory over the Rockets at Oracle Arena. Durant is averaging 34.2 points per game this postseason.

He played eight minutes and I thought his minutes were good, but it\u2019s a huge adjustment to play after a six-week, seven-week absence, especially at this level in the NBA Finals against a team that is pretty fast already.\u201d Cousins said going into the series that he was ready to feel what the title series is all about. \u201cIt felt great being part of that energy tonight,\u201d Cousins said \u201cI\u2019ve said it before and I\u2019ll say it again \u2013 I don\u2019t take any of these games for granted. To be out there on the floor tonight playing in that atmosphere was an incredible feeling. I\u2019m extremely happy to be part of it and I enjoyed the moment.\u201d He might get more moments in Game 2. \u201cI thought he did really well and we\u2019ll look at the tape, and we\u2019ll see what we decide to do with his role going forward,\u201d Kerr said. The comeback from the quad injury is just one in a series of comebacks over the last year for Cousins. He ruptured his left Achilles in January 2018 and missed nearly a full year of NBA action. The injury dramatically reduced his asking price on the free-agent market last summer \u2013 instead of potentially being a max-contract player, the six-time All-Star signed a one-year, $5.3 million contract with the Warriors. It was a low-risk, high-reward move for Golden State. The Warriors were coming off two straight titles and got to add an elite talent for mid-level money. Cousins appeared in 30 games during the regular season, working himself into shape for the playoffs. He got hurt while chasing a loose ball and taking an awkward fall in the second postseason game, and now will be working his way back into a rhythm for the Warriors \u2013 who are still without Kevin Durant while he recovers from a calf strain \u2013 during the Finals. \u201cWe all could have done a better job tonight,\u201d Cousins said. \u201cWe\u2019ll go back to the drawing board, look at our mistakes and we\u2019ll come out ready to play in Game 2.\u201d"},{"id":33467,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/reports-sons-lebron-wade-team","date":"2019-05-30","title":"Reports: Sons of LeBron, Wade set to team up in high school","content":" The Sierra Canyon School in Chatsworth, Calif. will reportedly have the sons of two famous faces in its mix next season.

The two are expected to continue their dialogue this summer, according to Wojnarowski. Charania reports that it was a \u201crespectful, productive\u201d conversation, but it remains \u201chighly unlikely\u201d Davis changes his mind about wanting to be traded. Roughly a week ago, Griffin reiterated his belief that he can convince Davis to stay put. Those comments came during a conference call to introduce newly hired GM Trajan Langdon , at which time Griffin also said he planned to talk with Davis and his agent, Rich Paul, in Los Angeles at some point soon. Davis, 26, initially asked to be traded in late January , midway through his seventh season with the Pelicans. He holds a player option that will allow him to reach unrestricted free agency in the summer of 2020. The six-time All-Star has averaged 23.7 points, 10.5 rebounds and 2.4 blocks in 466 career games. The Pelicans have reached the playoffs just twice during his tenure, with one series victory. While Griffin and the Pelicans may be confident, there has been no public indication from Davis that he wants to remain with the team. Griffin also spent time last Tuesday talking about the team\u2019s plan for the 2019 NBA Draft . The Pelicans beat the odds during the draft lottery to receive the No. 1 pick in this year\u2019s Draft, which is headlined by top prospects Zion Williamson and Ja Morant. After New Orleans won the lottery, reports circulated that Williamson would need to be convinced to join the Pelicans. Griffin was quick to dispel those reports on Tuesday. Charania reported after the Pelicans won the Draft lottery that Davis has not wavered in his desire to be traded. \u201cI\u2019m certain that\u2019s a false narrative relative to the players that could potentially be the No. 1 pick,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cWe\u2019ve sat with multiple players that we\u2019re looking at for that first pick. In fact, in the case of Zion Williamson, Alvin Gentry and I sat with he and his parents the night of the lottery. [\u2026] And Alvin and I were also together in interviewing Ja Morant in Chicago as well. And I think because we sat with those kids, who are both incredible human beings and all about all the right things, we know unequivocally that either one of them would be thrilled to join us in New Orleans. And they\u2019re both very much excited about the concept.\u201d Griffin also discussed his early impressions of Pelicans owner Gayle Benson, who took control of the team after the passing of her husband, Tom, last year. Griffin credits Benson for empowering the team to pursue top-level talent \u2014 like Langdon and longtime Phoenix Suns trainer Aaron Nelson \u2014 to New Orleans \u201cIt\u2019s become something that it\u2019s very clearly her baby, and the Pelicans matter immeasurably to her. And literally in all these hirings, she\u2019s putting her money where her mouth is and she\u2019s empowering us to go and attract the best and the brightest,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cAnd I think when you win the lottery in the midst of all those other things, it starts to really lend itself to changing a narrative.\u201d After the Pelicans\u2019 final game of 2018-19, coach Alvin Gentry described Davis as \u201ca great kid\u201d who \u201cgot some bad advice,\u201d referring to Paul, who also represents LeBron James and who orchestrated a public, mid-season trade demand for which Davis was fined $50,000. \u201cBut there\u2019s nothing wrong with A.D.,\u201d Gentry added. \u201cHe\u2019s a good, solid guy with good character.\u201d Overall this season, Davis averaged 25.9 points, 12 rebounds, 3.9 assists, 1.6 steals and 2.4 blocks per game. He appeared in 56 games, a career-low, and saw downturns in his overall shooting (51.7 percent) and 3-point shooting (33.1 percent) from 2018-19. Following the Feb. 7 trade deadline, Davis never played more than 34 minutes in a game . Davis was fined $15,000 by the NBA after he made an obscene gesture to a fan after a 115-109 home loss to the Charlotte Hornets on April 3. The disgruntled six-time All-Star, who missed his seventh straight game to close out the 2018-19 season with what the team has listed as back spasms, wore a T-shirt with the famous Looney Tunes sign off, \u201cThat\u2019s All Folks,\u201d written across the chest. As he walked down the tunnel toward the locker room after the game, he gave one fan a high-five.

So when Golden State forward Draymond Green said earlier this NBA postseason he considers himself the \u201cbest defender ever,\u201d naysayers lined up around the block. Some counted the Defensive Player of the Year awards won by Dikembe Mutombo and Ben Wallace (four each) to make their cases against Green (one). Others spoke of versatile, on-ball defenders such as Dennis Rodman, Gary Payton and Toronto Raptors star Kawhi Leonard. A few simply mentioned the name of legendary Boston Celtics center Bill Russell, and dropped the mic. Still, people wanted to ask Green about his boast Wednesday in advance of The Finals between the Warriors and the Raptors. They raised the topic with other Golden State and Toronto players, too. Given Leonard\u2019s involvement in these Finals, it remains to be seen if Green can even establish himself as the \u201cbest defender ever\u201d in this championship series. Both players have their supporters, in the non-rim-protector category of individual defense. \u201cBoth those guys are in the same discussion, right?\u201d Raptors coach Nick Nurse said. \u201cFirst of all, you\u2019ve got some physical abilities. You\u2019ve got some God-given abilities. You\u2019ve got some size, speed, athleticism, quickness. And then you go to the next part of it, and I always keep saying this: You\u2019ve got a tremendous desire and pride to stop people and make plays and want to infuse your team with enthusiasm to play defense.\u201d Warriors guard Klay Thompson said: \u201cBoth those two could be in the argument, especially of our time, this generation. \u2026 Obviously both Defensive Players of the Year. Can guard multiple positions. Their versatility is what, to me, stands out the most. It\u2019s not like they\u2019re just protecting the rim, but they can guard 1-through-5 and do it so effectively.\u201d But it\u2019s that \u201cever\u201d that sparks the push back against short-term memory, when the game\u2019s history stretches back eras across decades. Doesn\u2019t matter. Thompson was not deterred. \u201cHe\u2019s my teammate of seven years, so I will forever have his back,\u201d Thompson said. Golden State coach Steve Kerr stayed away from the absolute and focused on how well Green has played lately. The 29-year-old challenged himself late this season, losing 23 pounds in six weeks to peak as the postseason approached and keeping more of a lid on his unproductive emotions on the floor. That\u2019s the guy \u2014 stepping back into a featured role since Kevin Durant and DeMarcus Cousins got hurt \u2014 Kerr lauded Wednesday. \u201cHis leadership has been great,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cHe lost some weight and got himself in much better condition. \u2026 You can just see it. He\u2019s a different guy. He\u2019s slimmer and sleeker and faster, and I think that confidence has allowed him to be more poised on the floor. \u201cWhen you\u2019re playing well and you\u2019re feeling good about yourself, it\u2019s easier to sort of maintain your emotions. I think there was some frustration earlier in the year when he wasn\u2019t playing as well. He\u2019s such a passionate, competitive guy that some of those frustrations came out. But you\u2019re seeing the best of Draymond right now.\u201d The question remained: Is Green\u2019s best the best ever? The answer, even Green himself will admit, is yet to be determined. Th e status of the NBA\u2019s most legendary defenders is secure \u2014 for now. \u201cI think as a competitor, if you\u2019re trying to do something meaningful, if you don\u2019t have the mindset that you\u2019re the best ever, you failed already,\u201d Green said. Green\u2019s boast was all about motivating himself, not diminishing those who came before or even his peers. In his response, Green pulled back the curtain not on just this particular claim but his entire career, rising from the No. 35 pick in 2012 \u2014 a classic \u201c\u2019tweener\u201d in size who should have struggled at any front-court position \u2014 to become a key contributor and three-time NBA champion. \u201cSo if you don\u2019t have the mindset that you are the best reporter ever, then you already failed,\u201d Green told the questioner. \u201cThat\u2019s been my mindset since I can remember. That I am \u2018the best ever\u2019 at what I do. And every day that I step on the basketball floor I will strive to be that. And that will give me a shot at being the best. \u201cBut before you can ever reach anything, you have to believe it. You don\u2019t just mistakenly become great at something. You probably at one time or another believed that you can be great at that and then you work to get great at that and you reach that greatness. \u201cSo I always believed that. And I work every day to reach that.\u201d * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

It\u2019s over! Kawhi takes the ball and throws it in the air! I think it might land tomorrow in Vancouver! It\u2019s an upset for the ages! Raptors shock the Warriors for their first championship!\u201d TORONTO \u2014 Is this a TV commentator\u2019s (wind)pipe dream? Or can this really happen? There\u2019s a lot riding on the Toronto Raptors pulling off an all-time stunner in the 2019 version of The Finals . In no particular order: Canadian pride , Masai Ujiri\u2019s gamble , Kawhi Leonard\u2019s legacy , the Golden State Warriors\u2019 dynasty , motivational material for underdogs everywhere and of course, millions of cases of Molson\u2019s the night it happens. The beauty of sports lies in its unpredictability, its occasional veer into the dark alley of the unexpected, and the sensational thrill caused by the vibration of the shocker. Such will be the case if this series ends any way other than the \u201cSplash Brothers\u201d splashing the bubbly in a few weeks. It\u2019s not as if the Raptors are lacking credibility or talent or wound up in The Finals because they took a wrong turn somewhere along the way. After all, they just eliminated the league\u2019s best team in the regular season and, for the last four seasons, finished at or near the top of the Eastern Conference themselves. They\u2019re not Buster Douglas, 1985 Villanova or any other sports Cinderella story. But it\u2019s close. And they\u2019re playing the two-time defending champs and winners of three of the last four titles. And when you put those two elements together, it makes the right stew for David and Goliath and a chance for Canada to finally beat the U.S. in the Canadian game (remember, Dr. Naismith invented this). Still, how is this possible? How can the Raptors, with only one championship-tested player in the rotation, beat the Warriors four times in seven games (or less!)? Especially when the entire basketball world, or so it seems, suspects this will be a wrap with or without Kevin Durant? Remember, throughout the history of The Finals , ever since the Bill Russell Celtics dynasty in the 1960s, there are only two instances where a single-star-dominated team won a title: In 1975 (when Rick Barry did so with the Warriors) and in 2011 (when Dirk Nowitzki chopped down the mighty Miami Heat). This is certainly not beyond the pale. With the right amount of good fortune, and the least amount of Durant, and a heaping supply of Leonard \u2014 along with at least one other Raptor, Toronto is equipped to win this series and turn Jurassic Park into a city within a city. The Raptors have home-court advantage and Scotiabank Arena will be hazardous to the eardrums for 48 minutes at a time. It will be a plus if Toronto can win the first two games, in what will be Golden State\u2019s first time opening the Finals on the road . We start with the obvious: The Warriors are understandably concerned with a star they\u2019re well familiar with, despite him playing 3,000 miles away from Oakland. Before he became a Raptor, Leonard was known for being one of the few players to run through the Warriors. The most vivid example of this was when Leonard, then with the San Antonio Spurs, took a blowtorch to Golden State in Game 1 of the 2017 Western Conference finals . The Warriors\u2019 defense was shook. He helped the Spurs break to a 25-point lead, racking up 26 points with eight rebounds in 23 minutes. That\u2019s when Zaza Pachulia stuck out his foot while Kawhi levitated for another jumper, Kawhi landed funny, and neither he nor his relationship with the Spurs remained the same. The next season, Kawhi and his creaky and controversial quad limited him to nine games. His distrust with the Spurs\u2019 medical staff created a wedge, greasing his path from San Antonio to Toronto. Ujiri assured Kawhi the Raptors would do everything necessary and possible to preserve him for the long run, and evidently by what we\u2019ve seen from April until now, they have. \u201cHe made it clear that his health was a priority for him,\u201d Ujiri said. \u201cIt was a priority for us. Kawhi\u2019s quiet but he\u2019s relentless. I tell you, his work ethic is almost crazy \u2026 taking care of his body and doing all the work. You could tell it was a priority for him to get back to the highest level.\u201d Kawhi is having the kind of postseason that usually leads to a title. He\u2019s averaging 31.1 points, 8.8 rebounds, 3.8 assists, 1.6 steals per game. Not only has he not missed a playoff game, he fought through a tweaky leg during the Eastern Conference finals to play 40 minutes two nights later . His minutes per game have risen throughout the playoffs, too: 34.1 minutes per game in the first in the first round , 39.7 mpg in the East semis and 41.3 mpg in the East finals . \u201cHe said something to the effect that those first 82 games were just practice,\u201d said Raptors coach Nick Nurse. \u201cThen I thought OK, he\u2019s getting ready to throw it into another gear soon.\u201d Plus, Leonard is unflappable. Plenty of players shy away from the big shot because they\u2019re worried what social media and their teammates might say if they fail. Kawhi is wired differently. He genuinely does not care. His mindset is unwavering, just as it was in 2014 when he won Finals MVP . Earlier this season in November, in his only game against the Warriors, Kawhi scored 37 points on 24 shots . Clearly, then, the Warriors must scrap that gameplan and come up with another. Clearly, Kawhi is an attacking, opportunistic scorer who is comfortable everywhere on the floor. \u201cHe\u2019s been playing amazing this whole playoff run and really all season,\u201d said Warriors guard Stephen Curry. \u201cHe\u2019s always at his own pace, and never seems to get rushed or be in a hurry. He\u2019s obviously physically gifted and strong. He can get to his spots, but he\u2019s become a really good shooter. Off the dribble getting to a spot, rising up. And his counters are pretty solid, too. You take one thing away from him, he can shift directions, try to get a shoulder by you, get into the paint.\u201d Leonard is aggressive in man-to-man defense, willing and able to come away with the clean pick, or come up with the right tonic to slow the other team\u2019s biggest threat. Expect him to get his \u201cclaw\u201d on Curry and Klay Thompson and if he plays, Durant. The margin for error against a team with Durant on the floor is slim. Every chance without him must count. There\u2019s a general feeling, not based on medical proof, that Durant may miss multiple games \u2014 if not the entire series \u2014 with his calf injury. It\u2019s now three weeks without him in the lineup for an injury that usually requires four to six weeks, depending on the severity. Besides, even if Durant does make an appearance, how sharp can he be after so much time off? He hasn\u2019t practiced and shooters need rhythm \u2026 even the greats. He\u2019d be thrown into the thick of The Finals without the luxury of a warm-up game. Of lesser concern is how the Warriors will need to re-adjust with Durant on the floor. He\u2019s played two-plus seasons with this team and Thompson and Curry are the most accommodating stars in the NBA. The bigger issue is Durant\u2019s strength, wind and touch. He\u2019ll need all three against a team that brings the heat. Yes, that\u2019s \u201cdefence,\u201d the Canadian spelling, although the definition is the same. It starts with Leonard, a former back-to-back Kia Defensive Player of the Year , and brings three other players known for defense in their careers: Marc Gasol, Serge Ibaka and Danny Green. Add Pascal Siakam as well as Fred VanVleet and the Raptors have solid stoppers. That said, they haven\u2019t seen the likes of Golden State this postseason, or the 1-2 punch of Curry and Thompson. The key here is Kyle Lowry. Can the Raptors successfully hide Lowry for a portion of his playing time by assigning him to a non-scorer like Andre Iguodala? If so, then they\u2019ll be able to keep him away from mismatches and the tough task of chasing Curry or Thompson through screens. When pressed, the Raptors devised the proper way to keep Milwaukee Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo from destroying them in the East finals. The Warriors bring more weapons, yet if Durant is limited or doesn\u2019t play, that\u2019s one less worry for Toronto. Assuming one of them is Leonard, then who\u2019s riding shotgun? Will Lowry have the series of his life? Can Siakam have a postseason breakout to match his regular-season showing? Will Green rediscover his missing 3-point shot? Can VanVleet continue his torrid shooting from the East finals? Those are the likely supporting-actor candidates to Leonard\u2019s lead role who could give the Raptors the secondary source of help they\u2019ll need. There\u2019s a very likely scenario where the Warriors throw two, and maybe three, bodies at Kawhi in the final minutes of a tight game and force someone else to beat them. When that ball leaves Leonard\u2019s hands and finds its way to another\u2019s, will that teammate shoot with confidence \u2026 or juggle the hot potato? What the Raptors must understand is there\u2019s no promise that they\u2019ll ever get this far again, especially if Leonard leaves this summer in free agency . They should mirror the mentality Nowitzki\u2019s teammates adopted in 2011. Those Mavericks supported Nowitzki and made their presence known at various points against the Heat, be it with defense, smart decisions, and making open shots when Nowitzki was doubled. This is that challenge that awaits the Raptors. There cannot be an upset without a heavy favorite and a team that reasonably shouldn\u2019t win, but finds a way. The Warriors certainly fit the first description, and now the mystery of The Finals lies with the Raptors and where they stand. We will either have a series to remember, or a dynasty to never forget. Which will it be, Toronto? * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years. You can e-mail him  here , find his archive here  and follow him on  Twitter  .

Cousins, the Golden State Warriors\u2019 center who has been out since April 15 with a torn quadriceps muscle, told reporters Wednesday he remains questionable for Game 1 on Thursday ( 9 ET, ABC ). Warriors coach Steve Kerr told reporters that no decision has been made on Cousins\u2019 status \u2014 which wasn\u2019t much of a change for the big man heading into Wednesday\u2019s NBA Finals Media Day. \u201cHe\u2019s pain-free, so it\u2019s really more a matter of rhythym, timing, conditioning, all those things,\u201d Kerr said , per Marcus White of NBC Sports Bay Area. \u201cI think I mentioned the other day, if this were the regular season, I\u2019d throw him out there and he\u2019d play whatever minutes he could tolerate and we\u2019d build him up from there. It\u2019s not the regular season, it\u2019s The Finals. \u201cWe have to figure out what\u2019s the best way to utilize him. \u2026 Some of that will be determined by what\u2019s happening in the game, and the other stuff is just internal with our staff.\u201d https:\/\/twitter.com\/dkurtenbach\/status\/1133789219493695494 When asked if it would be up to him to play in Game 1, Cousins evaded that question and said, \u201cit was never up to me.\u201d But, per multiple reports, he sounded like a player who wants to suit up for The Finals when it begins. Cousins \u2014 in his first career postseason \u2014 scrimmaged Saturday and again Monday, a sign of progress he is closer to being ready. \u201cI feel better each and every day. That\u2019s my whole goal, to make sure I get better with each day that comes,\u201d Cousins said last week. \u201cHopefully, that opportunity comes, and I\u2019m able to get on the floor and help my teammates and try to help them win a championship.\u201d Warriors star forward Kevin Durant traveled with the team to Toronto, but will not play in Game 1. Kerr said Wednesday that Durant must ramp up his individual court work over the next few days to determine his status for Game 2. Durant, the two-time reigning Finals MVP who has missed the past five games since getting hurt in Game 5 of the Western Conference semifinals against Houston, has already been ruled out for Game 1 with a strained right calf. As of Tuesday, when Golden State held an optional practice before flying, he had yet to do any full-speed work on the court. He has done some shooting, Kerr said. There will be two full days off before Game 2 on Sunday, giving Durant time to get further on-court work done that the Warriors would need to see before he is medically cleared. Durant didn\u2019t travel to Houston for Game 6 of that round or to Portland for the two road games against the Trail Blazers in the Western Conference finals. He remained in the Bay Area to rehab, and the Warriors are unbeaten without him. An impending free agent this summer, he was hurt May 8 when he landed awkwardly on his right foot following a baseline jumper late in the third quarter of a 104-99 victory over the Rockets at Oracle Arena. Durant is averaging 34.2 points per game this postseason.

Fingers set in motion tend to remain in motion, especially typing frantically on deadline, and certain spellings emerge unwittingly in such moments. One such word that popped up on my computer screen years ago \u2014 \u201cRatpros\u201d \u2014 finally makes sense to me now, as embodied by the 2018-19 Toronto Raptors as they compete as considerable underdogs in their first-ever NBA Finals . \u201cRatpros\u201d is, of course, an anagram of \u201cRaptors\u201d and it\u2019s been dropping into my copy whenever I write about Toronto for, oh, the past 23 years or so. All I can think of is, it popped onto my screen back in the Raptors\u2019 early, ugly expansion years and somehow stuck (with me). It always seemed too snide to ever share with an audience \u2026 until now. Now I think there\u2019s a badge of honor in \u201cRatpros\u201d that captures the tenacity of this bunch. A little of their grunginess, too, based on their backgrounds and far-from-glamorous paths to, or very near, the pinnacle of their sport. The Raptors are a Finals rarity. They reached the championship series with a cut-and-paste, crazy quilt of a roster distinguished most of all by what it\u2019s lacking: No player drafted higher than No. 15 overall. Since the NBA began its draft lottery in 1985, every squad that reached The Finals boasted at least one player selected among the top 14 picks. Until now. Compare that to the Golden State Warriors. The defending champions have gotten plenty of credit during their five straight runs to The Finals for how homegrown their core is: Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green and Kevon Looney (new but undeniable now as a key guy) all were drafted by Golden State \u2014 the first three in leaner times. But if you extend the list to include their top nine players \u2014 essentially a playoff rotation \u2014 you\u2019ll notice seven lottery picks (six in the Top 10 of the draft) of a group that includes Kevin Durant, DeMarcus Cousins, Andre Iguodala, Shaun Livingston and Andrew Bogut. If you add up the Draft positions of those nine Warriors, the total is 104. Now do that to the top nine Raptors \u2014 wait, make that top eight Raptors, because Fred VanVleet was undrafted and would have to be counted as \u201cinfinity.\u201d The Raptors\u2019 score: 253. So 104-253. If this were golf, Golden State would destroy Toronto. But it\u2019s basketball and Draft positions don\u2019t dictate final scores, so they\u2019ll be playing anywhere from four to seven games over the next couple weeks to sort this out. \u201cIt\u2019s remarkable,\u201d Wayne Embry, senior advisor to the Raptors, said Wednesday morning. \u201cIt\u2019s a tribute to being able to find players low in the draft, as well as developing players. They\u2019ve done a terrific job of developing their players. Establishing a winning culture, too. And Nick Nurse has done a tremendous job of coaching them.\u201d Nurse, it\u2019s worth noting, was a rookie NBA coach this season with a long, tortuous path to his current gig. Toronto\u2019s chief basketball executive is Masai Ujiri, who began his days in Nigeria and traveled the world as a player before grabbing any rungs on the NBA ladder. Their hard-scrabble backgrounds might provide some insight into how this team was built. Center Marc Gasol was the 48th player selected in 2007 , then known as an overweight player who is Pau Gasol\u2019s younger brother. Today, he\u2019s a three-time All-Star and the 2013 Kia Defensive Player of the Year . \u201cI was at the back end of the Draft, so I was already asleep when they picked me, so I can\u2019t really tell you much,\u201d Gasol told reporters this week at the Raptors\u2019 practice facility. \u201cI think it tells you more about how much of a lottery the Draft is and how much more important it is to put the work in every day and continue to improve as a player.\u201d Only two current Raptors \u2014 forwards Pascal Siakam and OG Anunoby \u2014 are original Draft picks by the team, and they were selected 27th in 2016 and 23rd in 2017 , respectively. They hail from Cameroon and the United Kingdom, at least before working through high school and college basketball in the U.S. International players, including Gasol and Serge Ibaka, have been a part of Toronto\u2019s formula for years. They also have been players less hung up on taking their games and earning their livings in Canada, relative to guys raised in the U.S. All part of a \u201cnecessity is the mother of invention\u201d-approach that has led to this point for the Raptors. \u201cWe\u2019ve had guys who have had to work their way up, who have always been counted out,\u201d guard Norman Powell said after Toronto eliminated the Milwaukee Bucks in the East finals Saturday night , \u201cand I think that\u2019s what makes this so good.\u201d Powell spent four years at UCLA at a time when anything beyond one starts to feel like a stigma. He was drafted No. 46 in 2015 by Milwaukee \u2014 and ironically traded that night with the pick that would become Anunoby for a guard named Greivis Vasquez. Grievous indeed, since Vasquez played only 23 games for the Bucks and has been out of the league for four years. Said Powell of the humbling he and various teammates have received: \u201cIt makes us so much more hungry, and everyone understands each other because of that. Everybody understands the dog days of working their way up, of people saying \u2018You can\u2019t do this. You can\u2019t do that.\u2019 But the belief and the fight that these guys have built their whole basketball lives, it really shows.\u201d Don\u2019t misunderstand: the Raptors have had an appropriate share of high Draft picks for a franchise that missed the playoffs for five seasons before this active six-season run. Several of those players were flipped in trades for others whose value already exceed their Draft positions. DeMar DeRozan (No. 9) and Jakob Poeltl (9) were dealt to San Antonio in the deal that delivered Kawhi Leonard (15) and Danny Green (46). Jonas Valunciunas (5) was flipped for Gasol . Terrence Ross (8) was shipped to Orlando for Serge Ibaka (24). But getting traded for a player picked in the lottery doesn\u2019t impact the self-esteem quite like getting picked there oneself. \u201cA lot of guys have come from some good places, some good stories behind it, but they have a chip on their shoulder,\u201d Green told reporters. \u201cGuys that have been in the league, or guys that know what it\u2019s like to be out of the league or be picked last [in a pickup game], have a point to prove. A lot of character\u2019s built on this team coming from many different places.\u201d Embry \u2014 the first black general manager in professional U.S. sports who helped Milwaukee to its NBA title in 1971 and an esteemed NBA exec ever since \u2014 agreed. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to establish the will to win to have a winning culture,\u201d Embry said, \u201cand you\u2019ve got to find the right players. I\u2019ve always said that means trying to get players of high character, everything else being equal. This front office has done a great job of that.\u201d All things being equal, a team would rather have the No. 1 pick than not. But as Embry said, \u201cYou don\u2019t give up if you don\u2019t.\u201d There is, after all, that stat about the number of No. 1 picks in the past 35 years who have won championships with the NBA team that drafted them. The correct answer is four: Kyrie Irving, Tim Duncan, David Robinson and LeBron James (who gets an asterisk because he left and went back to Cleveland). Toronto\u2019s roster stands in stark contrast to the Philadelphia team they ousted in the East semifinals . The Sixers embraced \u201cThe Process,\u201d a grim plunge into the deep end of the lottery tank in search of the very best Draft spots. They got hits such as Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons, as well as several misses. That, and Toronto\u2019s counter approach, are remembering next month when the 2019 Draft heads toward pick No. 4, after top prospects Zion Williamson, Ja Morant and R.J. Barrett presumably have gone in the top three picks. So while \u201cRatpros\u201d isn\u2019t likely to stick with anyone or anywhere except at the tips of my fingers, it does conjure a gritty team built on bumpy roads and in dark alley. Might not even be surprising if the Raptors took it as a compliment. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

And for the first time in these same five postseasons, the Warriors are not starting The Finals at home. In fact, this is just the second of 20 total series over the last five years that the Warriors will start on the road. The Toronto Raptors, their first conference championship in hand , have home-court advantage, thanks to a lone regular-season victory . Games 1, 2, 5 and 7 are set for Scotiabank Arena should the series go the distance. Not many playoff series, in The Finals or otherwise, go the distance. Only 134 (25 percent) of the 542 best-of-seven series in NBA history have been decided in Game 7. And in only 21 (16 percent) of those has the home team won all seven games. Overall, the road team has picked off at least one game 96 percent of the time in best-of-seven playoff series. Of course, that\u2019s one of the two teams winning on the road. And here\u2019s where the Warriors run has been special: Through the 2019 Western Conference finals, Golden State has won at least one road game in 22 consecutive series, going back to the first round in 2013 (the first playoff series for Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green ). For context, over a 22-year playoff streak, the San Antonio Spurs have won at least one road game in 43 (80 percent) of the 54 series they\u2019ve played. Plus, their longest streak during that time only reached 13 series. The Warriors have showcased a special ability to close on the road. Of the 18 series they\u2019ve won over the last five postseasons, 11 \u2014 including each of the last five \u2014 have been closed out on the road. By comparison, during the same stretch, other teams have closed out only 25 of the 56 series on the road. The 2017 Warriors ( plus-9.4 ) and 2015 Warriors ( plus-8.7 ) have been the two best road playoff teams in regard to point differential per 100 possessions in the last 18 years (since the 2001 Lakers went 8-0 on the road ). Through the first three rounds of this postseason, the Warriors have the same record on the road (6-2) as they do at home (6-2). Statistically speaking, they\u2019ve been better on the road ( plus-7.4 points per 100 possessions ) than at home (plus-5.1). Four of their six biggest wins (those by eight points or more) have come on the road. Their offense has been driving this road success. They\u2019ve been better defensively than other teams on the road, but the gap on offense has been significantly greater. They have a differential even larger than it\u2019s been for home games, where teams typically have an advantage. Over these five years of playoff runs, the six Warriors who have attempted at least 200 postseason shots on the road \u2014 Curry, Thompson, Green, Kevin Durant, Andre Iguodala and Shaun Livingston \u2014 have a combined effective field goal percentage of 54.1% on those shots; the league-average postseason eFG% over those five years is 50.6% (51.5% at home and 49.7% on the road). In Durant\u2019s three seasons with the Warriors, he\u2019s been ridiculous on the road, registering an effective field goal percentage of 60% over his 22 playoff games away from Oracle Arena, much better than he\u2019s shot in Oakland over those three years. Thompson, Green and Iguodala, meanwhile, have shot almost as well on the road as they have at home. The Warriors have also done a better job of taking care of the ball on the road. In their 46 road playoff games over the last five years, they\u2019ve committed just 13.4 turnovers per 100 possessions vs. 14.6 per 100 in 53 home playoff games. Their free throw rate (FTA\/FGA) has also been higher on the road (0.271) than at home (0.263). It\u2019s thusly fair to expect the Warriors win a game in Toronto over the next couple of weeks. While the Raptors are the only team that the Warriors haven\u2019t beat this season, Golden State\u2019s 121.2 points per 100 possessions in Toronto over the course of the five-season run represents their best offensive-efficiency mark in any road arena. On the other end of the floor, though, the Raptors have scored 114.1 points per 100 possessions to tag the Warriors with their worst defensive-efficiency mark during the stretch. These two teams have simply played some highly efficient games north of the boarder. The Raptors will be the best team the Warriors have faced in these playoffs. They\u2019re one of two teams that ranked in the regular-season top five in both offensive and defensive efficiency. And they\u2019ve been even better defensively in the playoffs, holding all three of their opponents at least seven points per 100 possessions below their regular-season average. As noted in the numbers preview for this series , the Warriors\u2019 point differential of plus-6.2 points per 100 possessions is their worst mark through three rounds over these last five postseasons. They haven\u2019t been as dominant, especially defensively, as they were in the three seasons that culminated in a championship. But starting The Finals on the road? That shouldn\u2019t be an issue. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

(AP) \u2014 Kevin Durant is traveling with the Golden State Warriors to Toronto for the first two games of the NBA Finals, leaving open the chance he could be ready to return from a strained right calf in time for Game 2. Durant, the two-time reigning Finals MVP who has missed the past five games since getting hurt in Game 5 of the Western Conference semifinals against Houston, has already been ruled out for Game 1 on Thursday night. As of Tuesday, when Golden State held an optional practice before flying, he had yet to do any full-speed work on the court.

There will be two full days off before Game 2 on Sunday, giving Durant time to get further on-court work done that the Warriors would need to see before he is medically cleared. \u201cWe\u2019ll see where it goes from here,\u201d Kerr said Monday. \u201cThis is where the fact that there\u2019s a lot of days in between games during the finals helps us, so we\u2019ll see.\u201d Durant didn\u2019t travel to Houston for Game 6 of that round or to Portland for the two road games against the Trail Blazers in the Western Conference finals.

Durant is averaging 34.2 points per game this postseason. Kerr said Durant has been spending countless hours rehabbing to recover \u2014 hoping to get back soon to what he loves most. \u201cYou get that fear of missing out on stuff, like practices and shootarounds and new game plans and stuff like that. That\u2019s what I miss the most, obviously, grinding on the court individually and with my team. But that\u2019s out of my hands. Out of my control,\u201d Durant said Friday. \u201cMy task is to try to conquer this, and I think that\u2019s the journey [we\u2019re] on as basketball players. So I\u2019m pretty much down for anything but I\u2019m excited that I\u2019m making progress.\u201d Center DeMarcus Cousins, out with a torn left quadriceps muscle he injured in Game 2 of the first round against the Clippers, hadn\u2019t been ruled out for Game 1 though Kerr mentioned the magnitude of coming back on the finals stage after so much missed time.

Warriors coach Steve Kerr said Cousins is questionable to play in Game 1 of The Finals on Thursday ( 9 ET, ABC ). The 28-year-old center has been sidelined since April 15 with a torn quadriceps muscle. Cousins practiced with the team on Monday and scrimmaged with the reserve unit. Durant still has a way to go on his recovery timeline. Kerr said the team has yet to decide if Durant will travel to Toronto for the first two games and Durant has yet to be cleared for any on-court work. On Tuesday, Chris Haynes of Yahoo Sports reported that Durant will travel with the team to Toronto. \u201cKD\u2019s not playing in Game 1,\u201d Warriors coach Steve Kerr said Monday, per The Mercury News . \u201cWe\u2019ll see where it goes from here. The fact there\u2019s a lot of days in between games in the Finals helps us. So we\u2019ll see.\u201d As for Cousins, Kerr said the big man is making good progress in recovering from his injury, but the timing of Cousins\u2019 return is tough to balance for the Warriors. \u201cDeMarcus is making good progress right now,\u201d Kerr said, per ESPN . \u201cThe timing of this whole thing is tricky because he misses two months. It always takes big guys longer to find their rhythm; the speed of their game is so fast. If this was the regular season, this would be simple: Put him back in the starting lineup, and give him his minutes, and let him work his way back in and find his rhythm. It\u2019d be an easy one. But we\u2019re going into Game 1 of the Finals.\u201d Cousins has scrimmaged twice, Kerr said, but the center is still not moving up and down the floor well enough to be cleared for game action. \u201cThe good news is his body feels good, his quad feels good, but he\u2019s working his way back into shape and into rhythm, so this is not a simple dynamic for him, and I feel bad for him,\u201d Kerr said, per ESPN. \u201cThis is one of the reasons why he came to this team: It was to play in the playoffs and hopefully go to the Finals. We are, and with Game 1 just a few days away, it\u2019s not an easy position to be in.\u201d As for Cousins, he\u2019s doing all he can to be ready to play when that moment arrives. \u201cIt\u2019s just about getting my body in shape,\u201d Cousins told Marc Spears of The Undefeated after Monday\u2019s practice. \u201cMy quad muscle in shape and go through the different phases and ups and downs of the game. It has been a tough week. I\u2019ve been working my tail off to get to this point. But I am healthy enough.\u201d > NBA Finals Preview"},{"id":33561,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/best-moments-canadian-pro-hoops-history","date":"2019-05-28","title":"Oh, Canada!: Great moments in Canadian pro hoops history","content":"TORONTO \u2013 Hard as it might seem to top the euphoria at Scotiabank Arena and in the immediate vicinity around it Saturday night, there have been other highlights to the city\u2019s and the nation\u2019s surprisingly long history with professional basketball. Look, we get it: beating Milwaukee in Game 6 to earn their first trip to The Finals ranks right now as the biggest moment ever for the Raptors. Four more victories, against the dynastic Golden State Warriors, would shove that to the side, too. But there have been plenty of warm memories and proud accomplishments for Toronto, hoops, Canada and the NBA. Some, for too long, were about the only things onto which hardcore Raptors fans could hang. But in reaching the league\u2019s best-of-seven championship series at the end of their 24 season, coach Nick Nurse and his players have reignited hope, and more than a few dreams. What follows is some context for the success right now, a sense of tradition that makes Toronto\u2019s rise in the East totally appropriate. And still giddy as heck. On March 6, 1861 \u2014 eight months after Abraham Lincoln was sworn in as the 16th President of the United States \u2014 Naismith was born in Almonte, Ontario. He would go on to spend his life as an educator and a sports coach, but his signature achievement for our purposes here came when he left Montreal\u2019s McGill University and took a job as a YMCA training school instructor in Springfield, Mass. His boss in 1891 asked Naismith to come up with an indoor game to keep athletes in shape and engaged during harsh New England winters. One ball and two peach baskets later, voila! \u201cBasket ball\u201d was created. The sport was instantly popular and spread internationally, though it took longer than you\u2019d have thought before Naismith cut the bottoms out of the baskets. Naismith was gone by November 1946, but his legacy lived on. Basketball already was being played as an amateur sport in the U.S., Canada and overseas by then, and was welcomed as an official Olympic event starting in 1936 (women\u2019s basketball debuted at the Olympics in 1976). But the professional version got its first real traction right in Ontario when the Toronto Huskies played host to the New York Knickerbockers at Maple Leaf Gardens in the inaugural game of the Basketball Association of America on Nov. 1, 1946. ( The Knicks won, 68-66 .) That\u2019s the league that morphed into the NBA three years later. The Huskies didn\u2019t go along for the ride, finishing 22-38 that first season before disbanding. Today there are more Canadians in the NBA than players from any other country, but back at the start, someone had to be first. Gino Sorvan lays claim to that distinction with a double credential: he was a native of Windsor, Ont., and he played his brief BAA stint with its Toronto franchise. His total contribution: 11 points in six games, which does little justice to the 6-foot-2 Sorvan\u2019s skills as a potent scorer at Assumption College in Windsor or a year at the University of Detroit Mercy. Norm Baker , a 6-foot guard, snubbed the Huskies in their one and only season, instead signing a $4,800 contract to play for the Chicago Stags. Born in Victoria, British Columbia, Baker had been a force in amateur competition; he was named the nation\u2019s top player of the first half of the 20th century in a Canadian Press poll in December 1950. But in the BAA, he stuck around for just four games, missing the only shot he took for the Stags. As for Hank Biasatti , he was born in Beano, Italy, but spent his formative years in Windsor. He had split allegiances as an accomplished baseball player who wound up having cups of coffees at the highest levels of both sports. The Huskies invited Biasatti to camp as one of six Canadian prospects that first season, and he survived the final cut. His production was meager (six games, six points) so he persuaded the team to release him so he could chase his baseball dream. He was 27 in 1949 when he appeared in 21 games for the Philadelphia Athletics, getting two hits in 24 at-bats (.083). He is the guy the NBA cites as its first international player. The first native of Canada who lasted a while as an NBA player was Ernie Vandeweghe  , a swingman born in Montreal who played with the Knicks from 1949 into the 1955-56 season. Vandeweghe was New York\u2019s third-round pick in 1949 , and wound up playing 224 games, averaging 9.5 points and 4.6 rebounds per game. He took off the 1954-55 campaign for medical school, quit after five games the following season and wound up renowned for his medical career and his offspring. Vandeweghe served as a physician for the Air Force and later was chairman of the President\u2019s Council on Physical Fitness and Sports. His four children \u2014 Tauna (swimming), Bruk (beach volleyball), Heather (polo) and Kiki (a two-time NBA All-Star) \u2014 all enjoyed athletic success. Kiki currently serves as the NBA\u2019s executive vice president, basketball operations. Bob Houbregs was a scoring sensation at the University of Washington who helped popularize basketball on the West Coast. A practitioner of the hook shot and a native of Vancouver, Houbregs was a consensus All-American who averaged 34.8 ppg while taking Washington to the 1953 NCAA Final Four . The second pick overall in the 1953 draft , Houbregs played five NBA seasons for Milwaukee, Baltimore, Boston, Fort Wayne and Detroit. He technically is the only Canadian-born player in the Naismith Hall of Fame . Steve Nash was actually born in South Africa, before his parents moved to Regina, Saskatchewan when he was 18 months. Mike Smrek , a 7-footer born in Welland, Canada, was the 25th player selected in the 1985 Draft out of Canisius College. He was traded or waived seven times in seven seasons and played for a total of five franchises (Chicago Bulls, Los Angeles Lakers, San Antonio Spurs, Golden State Warriors, LA Clippers). But from November 1986 to November 1988, Smrek stuck with the Lakers and thus became the first Canadian player to win an NBA championship. Not one, in fact, but two with the \u201cShowtime\u201d Lakers of Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, James Worthy and the rest. Having added four teams just a few years earlier, the NBA bellied back up to the expansion bar in 1993 and announced that franchises would be awarded to Toronto and Vancouver, beginning play in 1995-96. Restricted in where they drafted in 1995, Vancouver took center Bryant (\u201cBig Country\u201d) Reeves at No. 6 , while Toronto grabbed guard Damon Stoudamire at No. 7 . Stoudamire earned Rookie of the Year honors in a class that featured Kevin Garnett, Antonio McDyess, Jerry Stackhouse and Rasheed Wallace, and had a productive 13-year career. Reeves fizzled out after six seasons, in lockstep with the Vancouver franchise that got moved to Memphis in 2001 . The inaugural Raptors team was predictably bad, finishing 21-61 to earn enough lottery balls to draft Marcus Camby at No. 2 in 1996. But they delighted their fans with at least one stirring upset: On March 24, the rock-star Chicago Bulls came to town at 60-8, chasing the NBA\u2019s best-ever record. Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen and the rest eventually got it, but no thanks to Toronto, which beat the Bulls in a 109-108 thriller at SkyDome. Stoudamire scored 30 points, Jordan had 36, and attendance was a whopping 36,131. When Syracuse\u2019s Leo Rautins was drafted in 1983 , he became only the seventh native of Canada to reach the NBA. Two years later, St. John\u2019s Bill Wennington went 16th in the Draft and became NBA Canadian No. 9. Both still are on the scene, by the way, as broadcasters for the Raptors and the Bulls, respectively. But the development of top NBA prospects accelerated over the next four decades. And in June 2013, the player taken No. 1 overall \u2013 UNLV forward Anthony Bennett to Cleveland \u2013 was a Canadian. One year later, it happened again, with Kansas wing Andrew Wiggins selected first overall , again by the Cavaliers. Bennett proved to be a disappointment from the start, averaging only 12.6 minutes in 151 appearances for four teams over four seasons . Wiggins is more confounding. His obvious skills have been good for 19.4 ppg for Minnesota (which acquired him in a trade of Kevin Love ), but his motor has been found lacking. The Timberwolves have poked, prodded and paid \u201cMaple Jordan\u201d ($148 million, five-year extension), and now are hoping new coach Ryan Saunders can sweet-talk some determination into him. There were 12 Canadian-born players on NBA rosters at the end of the 2018-19 regular season. If we\u2019re holding to the \u201cnative\u201d status for Canadian players, then the most successful in NBA terms is Rick Fox . The former Celtics and Lakers forward ranks first in points (8,966), first in assists (2,649), first in minutes (23,723) and first in games (930) among those born in Canada, and third in rebounds behind Tristan Thompson and Jamaal Magloire. Fox, born in Toronto, spent his formative years in Indiana and North Carolina. He won three NBA championships with the Lakers from 2000-02, the same number as Wennington with Jordan\u2019s Bulls from 1996-98. At a time when the NBA was searching for the next Michael Jordan, the Raptors\u2019 Vince Carter raised his hand \u2014 and then shoved his arm up to the elbow through the rim. Carter\u2019s dominance of the Slam Dunk Contest at NBA All-Star 2000 caused him to blow up as an international celebrity and he took the Raptors along for the ride. He inspired what had to be thousands of young Canadian kids to start playing basketball with some grand dreams. That contest and what followed was the stuff of a trio of nicknames \u2014 \u201cVinsanity,\u201d \u201cAir Canada\u201d and \u201cHalf-Man\/Half-Amazing\u201d (thanks, Shaq!) \u2014 and the nation\u2019s first NBA superstar. Toronto had been swept from the first round by New York in 2000, and was down 2-1 in the best-of-five series in 2001. But the Raptors fired back, led by Carter. He scored 32 points in Game 4 , then added 27 while playing all 48 minutes of Game 5 . In the next round against the Philadelphia 76ers, Carter averaged 30.4 ppg, went for 50 in Game 3 and just missed saving the Raptors at the end of Game 7 . Carter\u2019s status as the most storied Raptors player had its ups and downs \u2014 he spent six-plus seasons of the 21 he\u2019s logged in the NBA with Toronto, and there was rancor at the end. Eventually, he was traded to the New Jersey Nets in 2004 to end his era with the Raptors. But he spent his prime with the franchise and became not only its face but its personality. Just as he craved and over time earned respect for being more than an elite dunker, so did the Raptors demand and demonstrate their need to be taken seriously as an East foe with which to be reckoned. When the Raptors finally get around to hoisting a retired jersey \u2014 either before or after Carter lands in the Hall of Fame \u2014 it has to be his No. 15. Too small and presumably too old by the 2004-05 season, Steve Nash surprisingly left Dallas as a free agent and transformed himself as the Phoenix Suns\u2019 new point guard. Nash hooked up with coach Mike D\u2019Antoni\u2019s high-octane offensive system to become something of a Wayne Gretzky of the hardwood. He could play fast or he could play slow, circling under the backboard along the baseline to torment an uneasy defense. Nash ran Phoenix\u2019s attack, got the Suns to 62 victories and averaged 15.5 points and 11.5 assists while hitting 43 percent of his 3-pointers. That earned him his first MVP. Then he topped his personal stats in 2005-06 and won it again. The one Toronto made last summer will get more attention this week and next, but a little credit needs to go to former GM Bryan Colangelo for the deal he made in July 2012 for Kyle Lowry . Lowry had a tarnished reputation as headstrong, particularly in dealing with his coaches, so the price was pretty low: a first-round pick to Houston and guard Gary Forbes. Lowry arrived, forged a solid working relationship with coach Dwane Casey and, one year in, started a run of six straight playoff berths, with five trips to the All-Star Game for himself. Actually, it was a different \u201cF\u201d word that\u2019s the star of this item. Toronto fans had gotten excited about the 2014 team\u2019s push to the postseason, and GM Masai Ujiri either got swept up in it or wanted to amplify the enthusiasm. So before the Raptors faced Brooklyn in the first-round opener, Ujiri showed up at a rally outside the then-Air Canada Centre. He punctuated his exhortations to the crowd with a \u201c[EXPLETIVE] Brookyn!\u201d It dinged his pocketbook when the NBA fined him $25,000 for the indiscretion but it roused the fans and propelled what became the Jurassic Park phenomenon outside home games. Time running out. Kawhi Leonard to the right corner, high-arcing shot, orange lights on the backboard, then one, two, three, four bounces on the rim. When Leonard\u2019s shot with no time remaining dropped through the net to win Game 7 against Philadelphia in the conference semifinals, Toronto\u2019s season might have been saved. Had the Sixers prevailed in overtime, there\u2019s no telling how gloomy things might look by comparison. Worry among Raptors fans already would be reaching epic proportions over Leonard\u2019s looming free agency and assorted, inevitable changes in the roster. Instead, it was Joel Embiid\u2019s time to cry. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

But the NBA MVP finalist said his team still had a successful season despite falling short of its goal of winning the second NBA championship in franchise history. \u201cIt\u2019s just fun to walk out in Milwaukee and see people in Bucks stuff,\u201d Antetokounmpo said. \u201cWe were able to bring people out of their houses to come and enjoy games and just be a part of the Milwaukee Bucks, be happy about something in this city, be excited about something. It was an amazing, amazing season, and hopefully we can carry on from where we left off and come back and be better.\u201d The Bucks had the best record in the NBA during the regular season and were two wins shy of reaching the NBA Finals. Now, the franchise and its fans must face the reality that the roster \u2014 outside of Eric Bledsoe and Antetokounmpo \u2014 could look a lot different next season. Teams can officially begin negotiating with free agents at 6 p.m. EDT on June 30. Bucks General Manager Jon Horst\u2019s top priorities at that point will be unrestricted free agent Khris Middleton and restricted free agent Malcolm Brogdon. Middleton averaged 18.3 points, six assists and 4.3 rebounds this season en route to earning his first career All-Star selection. Middleton has a $13 million player option next season, but will likely opt out and test free agency. Middleton said he first will consider what\u2019s best for himself and his family and then consider which team he fits with best. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be fun and a new position,\u201d Middleton said of being an unrestricted free agent. \u201cI\u2019m excited about the opportunity.\u201d Brogdon, who missed eight weeks over the course of the end of the regular season and the beginning of the postseason with a right foot injury, averaged 13.5 points on 44% shooting, 3.3 assists and 5.2 rebounds in the Eastern Conference finals. Brogdon said he learned more about himself than anything else during his time recovering. \u201cI showed myself I could really come back and play at a high level right back off of injury,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause it\u2019s challenging, playing against the caliber of teams you\u2019re playing in the playoffs.\u201d The Bucks became just the sixth team in NBA history to win the first two games in either the conference finals or NBA Finals and then drop four straight to lose the series. But Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer, who led Milwaukee to a league-best 60-22 record during the regular season, made quite an impression in his first season. Budenholzer is a finalist for NBA coach of the year. Budenholzer said he\u2019s \u201cdisappointed and frustrated\u201d by the loss in the Eastern Conference finals, but wants to channel that energy in a positive way. \u201cI\u2019m going to get better as a coach,\u201d he said. \u201cOr at least I certainly hope to and plan to and need to work to, and have that as my mindset.

And with LeBron James now in the Western Conference, the champs have a new Eastern Conference opponent in front of them. The Toronto Raptors are in The Finals for the first time in franchise history, having escaped a few adverse situations along the way. They were a possession or two away from trailing Philadelphia 3-1 in the conference semifinals, a possession or two away from losing Game 7 in that round, and a possession or two away from trailing Milwaukee 3-0 in the conference finals. That they\u2019re here says a lot about the Raptors\u2019 resilience. It also says a lot about their defense, which has played at an elite level for much of their playoff run. The Warriors, of course, are the best offensive team we\u2019ve ever seen. The other end of the floor features Kawhi Leonard\u2019s efficient scoring against a Golden State defense that has improved from round to round. And even with Kevin Durant out for at least the first game , the Warriors have a few elite defenders with whom to defend the Raptors\u2019 star. Is this the last run of the Warriors\u2019 dynasty? Is this the last time we\u2019ll see Leonard in a Raptors uniform? Those questions won\u2019t be answered in the next two weeks, but as Leonard has said all postseason, for now we can just enjoy the moment.

What\u2019s funny is Masai Ujiri is the last person to take bows, although there\u2019s a conga line in Toronto anxious to give him his due, and it wraps around the Scotiabank Arena twice. So what\u2019s he to do? The Toronto Raptors are in The Finals for the first time in franchise history as the hockey city is ablaze with basketball dreams. All of it is because the team president took a chance last summer to create a championship team. Ujiri did not play it safe with a team that in successive seasons won 56, 51, 59 and 58 games. He did not assume all was good when noted Raptors assassin LeBron James took his talents to the Western Conference last July. Ujiri traded the second-most popular player in team history for a brooding and mysterious ringer because, while every general manager says winning a championship is all that matters, Ujiri proved it with his actions. And so Kawhi Leonard is the toast of Yonge Street right now, and there\u2019s no civic angst detected over DeMar DeRozan being sacrificed in the process. And this represents the gutsiest and most rewarding swap in recent history \u2014 or, according to an unofficial polling of Canadians, maybe of all time. But was it that risky? And were fans really up in arms about it when it happened? And where do the Raptors and Leonard go from here? The arrival and triumph and future of Kawhi Leonard in Toronto is a basketball drama in three stages: Ujiri wasn\u2019t happy in the immediate aftermath of Game 3 of the 2018 Eastern Conference semifinals against the Cavaliers. He was quite irate, in fact, and this is likely the precise point where the quest for a superstar took root. LeBron beat the Raptors at the buzzer with a running, fading, floater after running unchecked for nearly the length of the floor to put the Cavs up 3-0 in the series. Ujiri had harsh words for coach Dwane Casey, according to those who stood outside the closed doors, and the topic of conversation likely had to do with strategy on the play. Ultimately, it cost Casey his job when the Raptors were a no-show in Game 4 and the Cleveland sweep complete. The most successful coach in team history was gone . Ujiri surely noticed the Raptors lacked anyone good and dependable enough to take over a game, similar to what LeBron and maybe a dozen other players do. It\u2019s nearly impossible to win a title without at least one such player. The trick was finding one and unless a team is bad enough to draft one \u2014 then comes the matter of developing said player \u2014 or can convince one to sign through free agency, the odds dwindle. There is one other method: Find a distressed one. This happened 18 years ago when a domestic violence incident greased Jason Kidd\u2019s path out of Phoenix and he subsequently led the then-New Jersey Nets to a pair of trips to The Finals . Rasheed Wallace, though not a franchise player, was acquired by the Detroit Pistons from the Atlanta Hawks in 2004. A few months later, he and the Pistons upset the Los Angeles Lakers in The Finals. Back in 1975, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar asked out of Milwaukee and landed with the Lakers , just a few seasons before their \u201cShowtime\u201d era launched. Leonard fit that description last summer. After playing just nine games due to a quad injury and the bad vibes between him and the San Antonio Spurs that developed from it, the 2014 Finals MVP was on the market. And Ujiri pounced at the chance to get his missing piece. Truthfully, the only gamble was this: With LeBron gone, Toronto\u2019s chances of moving into June were instantly enhanced. LeBron had closed out the Raptors in three straight postseasons. Ujiri could\u2019ve stayed put, but he went with his instincts and pulled the trigger, even without assurances that Leonard would re-sign this summer. That essentially made him a one-year rental. But Ujiri planned to shake up the team anyway, suspecting the Raptors had gone as far as they could with DeRozan and Kyle Lowry. Other GMs would\u2019ve played it safe, but he didn\u2019t, opting for a high-risk, (potentially) high-reward move. The notion that all of Canada was incensed by the trade is faulty. Fans loved DeRozan because, unlike Vince Carter, Tracy McGrady and Chris Bosh before him, DeRozan wanted to be in Toronto . Carter leveraged himself out of town, T-Mac wanted his own team and Bosh bolted to help create \u201cThe Big Three\u201d in Miami. But these underrated basketball fans are smart, and they knew Kawhi was an upgrade on both ends of the court. The only person in Canada whose feelings were hurt was Lowry, who is tight with DeRozan and for weeks refused to speak to Ujiri. But with a $500,000 bonus for reaching The Finals and a chance to win a ring, he\u2019s good.  The Raptors did everything Leonard asked in terms of protecting and preserving his body from injury, and therefore the Raptors did themselves a favor in the process. Feeling refreshed and refocused from a season of light wear and regular rest (and sensitivity from the organization), Leonard returned with a renewed spirit. For the first time since before his injury, Leonard felt his organization \u2014 from ownership to the front office to the coaching staff and the locker room \u2014 was totally behind him. So the least Leonard could do was deliver, and he has \u2014 and then some. In the 2016-17 season, the Spurs had just seen Tim Duncan retire and franchise stars Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili were diminished by age. Yet Leonard dropped hints that he could be \u201cThe Guy\u201d for the Spurs, averaging 25.5 points per game while emerging as a two-way star and Kia MVP contender . This is the Kawhi the Raptors saw this season, with more of a willingness to be a volume shooter and sharper passer out of double-teams, while never neglecting his defense. The postseason has shown more of an uptick, with a special emphasis on end-of-the-game presence (as the Philadelphia 76ers and Milwaukee Bucks painfully discovered). In the afterglow of the Eastern Conference finals title, Ujiri called Kawhi \u201cthe greatest player in the game.\u201d He has been the anti-DeRozan in springtime. Too often, DeRozan had a pattern of performances that ranged from respectable to regrettable, rarely raising his play when games mattered most. It was this pattern from DeRozan (and to be fair, Lowry, too) that convinced Ujiri that DeRozan, while beloved, could never be That Guy the Raptors needed for the next step. Almost instantly, Kawhi\u2019s teammates \u2014 and most notably Lowry \u2014 yielded to him in what is was the ultimate respect any newcomer could get. A trip to The Finals was exactly what Ujiri wanted from the trade, a chance to reward Raptors\u2019 fans for their loyalty and support. And, perhaps, this experience could sway Kawhi this June when free agency looms. Anyone in Toronto on game days during the playoffs could see the benefits of trading for Kawhi: Crazed fans standing outside at \u201cJurassic Park,\u201d bars and restaurants jammed, merchandise selling briskly, every seat taken at Scotiabank. And there was hope. Suppose this is all short-lived and Kawhi is just passing through? Well, then \u2026 What\u2019s the old saying? Better to have loved Leonard than never to have had the chance to love him? He came, he \u201cclawed,\u201d he conquered. Mostly, he gave Toronto a season to remember, maybe even forever if he and the Raptors pull off a stunning upset in a few weeks. If the relationship is indeed brief, then there\u2019s no hard feelings anywhere. Not from Ujiri, not from Leonard\u2019s teammates and certainly not from the fans. Leonard will not get the Spurs treatment if he returns next season in another uniform. No promises were made and therefore, none broken. But enough of the sentimentality. Should he leave, then in retrospect, how much did that trade cost the Raptors? Then again, where were they headed without him? Most likely, they would\u2019ve been a 45-to 50-win team with an early expiration date each spring. The DeRozan-Lowry Raptors had maxed out and change was coming anyway. Without Leonard, Ujiri has a chance to retool the Raptors around Pascal Siakim, a young potential star should he keep taking leaps. The Raptors would need to bite the money bullet for only next season. Their payroll drops considerably in the summer of 2020 once the contracts of Lowry ($33 million next season), Marc Gasol ($25 million) and Serge Ibaka ($23 million) vanish. It\u2019s possible Ujiri could trade one or more of those expiring contracts \u2014 although not at the expense of taking back bad money just to win a few more games in 2019-20. Then the question is: Would free agents be attracted to Toronto? First and foremost, free agents are attracted to money. And stable management. And world class cities. And frigid temperatures. (Well, scratch that last one.) If anything, a favorable salary cap and a few assets would be just the challenge that a top-flight team president would crave. He\u2019d have options. Ujiri pulled off a trade last summer that took guts and a reasonable risk \u2026 yet it worked out. The real risk now is with anyone who thinks he couldn\u2019t pull off something else. That\u2019s the scenario if there\u2019s no Kawhi. Ujiri can stay patient for a year and then roll up the sleeves and go to work. Or he can spare himself that chore and go to work this summer and convince Kawhi to stay. Can you imagine what his palms and knuckles would look like then? * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

It would be nice for Milwaukee Bucks fans to think that their team\u2019s superstar and MVP favorite vamoosed, stage left, before his postgame interview session ended so he could rush to the nearest gymnasium to start working on his game for the 2019-20 NBA season. That\u2019s what next season will be about, after all: Antetokounmpo\u2019s capability to get better individually, the Bucks\u2019 capacity to perform better in circumstances such as this, Game 6 of the Eastern Conference finals, and together their potential to win two more games next time to advance to the Finals and really chase a championship. Fact is, Antetokounmpo did not sneak back onto the court at Scotiabank Arena, scene of the Bucks\u2019 second-half meltdown (a disastrous 26-3 skid across the quarter break) and elimination by the Toronto Raptors, 100-94 . According to league sources, he chose not to answer a question put to him and teammate Khris Middleton by an ESPN reporter who wrote a story Saturday evening speculating about Antetokounmpo\u2019s loyalty to and future in Milwaukee. So the Bucks star, after answering a half dozen questions as he sat front and center with Middleton, ignored her question about the Bucks\u2019 limited postseason experience. He rose silently, grabbed a water bottle and walked off, leaving Middleton to handle the awkward moment. As podium moments go, it was notable. It\u2019s rare for an NBA player, on live TV, to simply ignore a question and leave. Even Russell Westbrook makes sure to utter a dismissive, \u201cNext question\u201d when he doesn\u2019t like the query or the person asking it. However, a better approach can be his if he absorbs not only the lessons of the loss but also the reactions on social media and elsewhere that can instantly flare into the sort of thing he dealt with on the podium. Want to shut people up? Want to end all the \u201cIf the Bucks don\u2019t do this , Giannis is going to do that \u2026\u201d guessing and conjecture? Then Antetokounmpo is going to have to raise his game beyond its current all-NBA first team level. Milwaukee is going to have to do more than just run it back with a holdover roster and style of play. The Bucks actually need to emerge from the East and reach The Finals, and maybe even take advantage of some Golden State\u2019s decline by next June the way they and Toronto battled to exploit LeBron James\u2019 departure from their conference this spring. That would shut up everyone trying to invent a wedge between Antetokounmpo and his team. It might seem greedy and overly demanding to expect bigger and better things out of a player who already is doing so much. Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer admitted as much after referring briefly to Game 3 as one in which Antetokounmpo didn\u2019t play with his customary force. \u201cI\u2019m just being critical of Giannis and trying to push him,\u201d the Bucks coach said. \u201cHe\u2019s doing very, very close to exactly what we need and what we want him to do.\u201d Uh, not exactly. You know the saying derived from a Bible passage: \u201cTo whom much is given, much is expected.\u201d Based on Antetkounmpo\u2019s marvelous physical attributes, there still are ways he can improve as a basketball player. And yes, do more for his franchise. Let\u2019s flash back 13 months to the night Milwaukee was eliminated from the first round in seven games against Boston. Here\u2019s what Antetokounmpo said then, as reported by NBA.com\u2019s John Schuhmann: \u201cI\u2019m the best player on the court, both teams. But from the start, the game plan was to stop me.\u201d Nothing has changed. Toronto\u2019s strategy against Milwaukee was the same, more than a year later: Anybody but Giannis. As in, Raptors coach Nick Nurse had his guys running multiple defenders at Antetokounmpo, either as a wall of resistance to his forays up court or in double-teams and traps in the halfcourt. Toronto wanted the ball out of Antetokounmpo\u2019s hands and, when he did catch it, they wanted their defense in his head. That included Leonard, a debilitating on-ball defender who seemed to slow any Bucks player he confronted (as Antetokounmpo often did in the series against any Raptor). So what\u2019s a Greek Freak to do? Plenty. He can develop a more reliable jump shot, for one. He can work on his left hand, so he\u2019s not constantly trying to score with his right when on the left side of the basket. He can refine his post-up game, so he can catch the ball near the rim without always having to drive it into the paint himself. Antetokounmpo can improve at the foul line \u2013 please. He made 35 free throws and missed 25 in the series, which seems rather important when the difference between the two teams over six games was a mere six points (646-640). Leonard, for the record, shot 61 free throws and sank 54. There\u2019s another saying: A man\u2019s reach should exceed his grasp. In Antetokounmpo\u2019s case, given his jumbo-jet wingspan and king-crab hand size, there\u2019s little that can exceed either. And Budenholzer, though he might blush a bit to continue asking, believes Antetokounmpo is capable of more. \u201cWe feel like he\u2019s going to get a lot better,\u201d Budenholzer said. \u201cAt 24, some guys are \u2013 I don\u2019t want to say they are who they are [but] some of the great ones at 24 were the same at 30 and 32. Giannis, we feel like, has got a lot of room to grow.\u201d Budenholzer echoed that in regard to the team, which remains to be seen. Middleton, Brook Lopez, Malcolm Brogdon and Nikola Mirotic will hit free agency in July. It\u2019s important to remember that veteran guard George Hill, so helpful over the last month, was added during the season as much for his cheap buyout this summer. So the roster will look different in ways big or small. And maybe it should. There were numerous times against Toronto that Antetokounmpo made exactly the right play, passing the ball out of double teams, only to have a shooter miss or fail to launch. All season, the Bucks had been a let-it-fly team, ranking second in 3-point attempts and makes, while abhorring 2-point shots (No. 27 in the NBA). But they got sideways from the arc against the Raptors, making only 31 percent in the six games. And facing elimination Saturday, this team that lived by the three died by it \u2013 Middleton\u2019s 3-pointer with 3:46 left in the third quarter was Milwaukee\u2019s last. The Bucks missed their final 11 from or beyond the arc. In the second half overall, they were 3-for-16, about what you\u2019d expect from a 1980s team turning to the three in desperation and without much confidence. There were other shaky performances in Game 6 or the series, enough to spark questions again about the quality of help around Antetokounmpo. But not surprisingly, he didn\u2019t throw anyone or even any aspect of Milwaukee\u2019s style under the proverbial bus. \u201cI don\u2019t think anything has to change,\u201d Antetokounmpo said. \u201cWhat I did was trust my teammates. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve been doing the whole year. If we lose by doing that, by trusting one another, by moving the ball \u2026 by trusting our habits, it\u2019s OK.\u201d Moments later, he added: \u201cIt\u2019s something that I take pride in, getting better in the offseason. So hopefully now I can work on the right things, listen to my coaches \u2026 work my butt off and come back again next year and just be a better basketball player and a better teammate.\u201d A minute or so after that, one answer early, Antetokounmpo walked off into summer with more control than anyone else in changing the outcome, which in turn will change any narrative. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Kawhi Leonard had grabbed the game-sealing rebound and was at the free throw line with the Toronto Raptors up by four. Leonard was the star that had carried this team though most of these playoffs, but your eyes gravitated to the man standing behind Leonard. Kyle Lowry was giddy. As Leonard released his first free throw, he was pumping his fists. After the first shot, he had a huge grin as he dapped up Leonard, who remained characteristically stone-faced. As Leonard stepped back to the line for his second free throw, Lowry retreated to the backcourt with his hands on his head. It was a goofy smile, one he just couldn\u2019t control. Sitting at his locker after his Toronto Raptors advanced to the NBA Finals with a 100-94 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks in Game 6, Lowry stumbled trying to explain what that moment felt like. \u201cThat feeling is not,\u201d he started. \u201cYou don\u2019t know that feeling \u2026 You just don\u2019t know what to say. It\u2019s not a feeling you can describe.\u201d As he talked, the game ball was in his locker, sitting on top of a pile of gear. He had made sure to grab the final rebound after the buzzer sounded. As he ran off the floor to hug his kids, that ball was stuck to his hip. It was still there as he spoke with TNT\u2019s Ernie Johnson at the trophy presentation. \u201cI might take it home,\u201d he admitted. Over the five regular seasons prior to this one, the Toronto Raptors had 19 more regular-season wins than any other team in the Eastern Conference. But in regard to postseason success, they had little to show for it. There was Lowry getting blocked at the buzzer of Game 7 against Brooklyn in 2014. There was the embarrassing, first-round sweep at the hands of the Washington Wizards the year after that. They reached the conference finals in 2016, but a 2-2 series wasn\u2019t an \u201cadverse situation\u201d for LeBron James, whose Cleveland Cavaliers swept the Raptors out of the conference semis in both 2017 and 2018. Lowry is the only guy on the current roster that\u2019s been here for all the regular-season success and all the postseason frustration. And more often than not, he\u2019s been the face of the latter. There was another time when Lowry had a ball by his side as he addressed the media after a playoff game. It wasn\u2019t the game ball, but rather the ball he had used in an impromptu, practice-court shooting session after a rough performance against the Miami Heat in 2016, one of the many Game 1 losses that the Raptors have suffered over the years. Lowry has had a lot of ups and downs over the years, and really, his postseason struggles are probably overstated. In 67 playoff games with the Raptors, he has averaged 17.1 points (on an effective field goal percentage of 50.4 percent) and 6.3 assists. He\u2019s a plus-80 in his Toronto playoff career, even though his team has been outscored by a total of 156 points over those six postseasons. Whether or not the shots are going in, Lowry\u2019s impact is felt. He makes big plays on both ends of the floor. And he\u2019s made them in a lot of big moments in these 2019 playoffs. It\u2019s kind of incredible to think about how often this Raptors\u2019 postseason was on the brink of another disappointing finish. In the conference semifinals, they trailed 2-1 and by four points early in the fourth quarter of Game 4 in Philadelphia. They needed four bounces to win Game 7. And in this series, they were just a possession or two from being down 0-3, a deficit that no team in NBA history has ever come back from. On Saturday, the Raptors trailed by 15 points with a little more than two minutes left in the third quarter, in danger of losing their best opportunity to close out this series. Some life had been breathed back into the Bucks, who would have had a Game 7 back in Milwaukee. Prior to Saturday, they were 57-5 in games they led by at least 15 points. The Raptors made some abbreviated runs, but just couldn\u2019t get over the hump. But then it happened. A 26-3 run that turned that 15-point deficit into an eight-point lead, one that the Raptors would never lose (though they came close). Leonard got it started with eight points and an assist to close the third quarter, but the Raptors kept it going with their star on the bench for the first two and a half minutes of the fourth. Lowry didn\u2019t score any of the 26 points, but he had four assists on the run, and the last was one every Raptor fan will remember forever. After Leonard missed a three, Fred VanVleet picked up Middleton in transition. But when Middleton tried to go behind his back, Lowry pounced from off of George Hill in the strong-side corner. He took the ball from Middleton and raced down the floor with Giannis Antetokounmpo and Eric Bledsoe on his tail. He stopped just inside the free throw line, waited for the two Bucks to pass by and dropped an underhand pass to a trailing Leonard. As Leonard rose for a majestic left-handed dunk, Lowry gave Antetokounmpo a little nudge to help prevent a block. \u201cI know just to keep running with Kyle,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t have nothing easy, he\u2019s going to make the right play.\u201d It was the highlight of the night, a play only topped on this postseason run by Leonard\u2019s Game 7 buzzer-beater. And it capped what was a remarkable comeback from a tough, resilient team. The Raptors wouldn\u2019t be here without Leonard, the star that has lifted them. They also wouldn\u2019t be here without Lowry, the tough point guard who has played through an injured left thumb (that seems bound for surgery after The Finals) and spent most of the series guarding a guy \u2013 Khris Middleton \u2013 seven inches taller than him. \u201cHis natural instincts are to be a leader out there, and he shows it,\u201d Raptors coach Nick Nurse said. \u201cHe does it with his IQ and his great knowledge of the game. He shows it with tremendous toughness as well. That\u2019s his other natural characteristic. He\u2019s blocking out guys twice his size. He\u2019s taking charges every game. He\u2019s just going to fight to win. He\u2019s a hell of a competitor, and that rubs off on guys.\u201d After five years of playoff frustration, Kyle Lowry finally broke through. And though this postseason isn\u2019t over, an Eastern Conference championship was clearly a time for celebration. \u201cI\u2019m going to savor the moment,\u201d Lowry said, \u201cbut I\u2019m not satisfied. Our goal is to win the NBA championship.\u201d The Finals start Thursday . * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

A few examples come to mind, such as the 1988-89 Lakers who lost Byron Scott to a hamstring injury caused by Pat Riley\u2019s pre-Finals boot camp and then Magic Johnson similarly one game into the series with the Pistons, who swept. Then the 2015 Cavaliers, already without Kevin Love, saw Kyrie Irving lost with a fractured kneecap suffered in Game 1. Maybe those two teams would\u2019ve won, maybe not. It\u2019s one of those basketball mysteries that\u2019ll go unsolved. Well, what the Warriors are trying to do is become the best team to win in spite of their health, specifically with Kevin Durant, who\u2019s expected to play against the Raptors although precisely when, and to what extent, and how effectively, all remain unclear right now. The Warriors romped quite impressively if not mildly surprisingly the last five full games without Durant in the final two rounds of the West playoffs, and while that bodes well for their confidence, at some point, conventional thinking says they will need Durant. Will he be around to bail them out when the ball doesn\u2019t fall for Steph Curry and Klay Thompson? Should Durant be the Durant who sizzled in the first round and through much of round two, this series might be short on suspense. And if DeMarcus Cousins returns? Well. The Warriors for the first time in five years don\u2019t have to go through LeBron James to win a title, and while Kawhi Leonard is a former Finals MVP and rolling for the Raptors right now, he (or most any other human) isn\u2019t on the King\u2019s post-season level. This has been a satisfying season for the Raptors\u2019 franchise, which finally experienced a post-season breakthrough (thanks partly by LeBron\u2019s defection). Yet: Kawhi would need to be a close imitation of LeBron to keep a national audience fixated and the Raptors close enough to prevent the Warriors from taking another summer champagne bath before summer officially begins. Three things to watch  1. Will Kawhi Leonard survive Draymond Green and Andre Iguodala? It\u2019s one thing to see a solid defender in your path, as Kawhi did with Giannis Antetekounmpo. But what happens when the Warriors can throw Green and then Iguodala and perhaps Klay Thompson and maybe Kevin Durant, all of whom bring different looks? This could prove problematic for Toronto and frustrating for Kawhi, especially if Danny Green, Pascal Siakam, Serge Ibaka and company don\u2019t rise up. 2. Can Kyle Lowry keep up with Stephen Curry defensively? This will be quite the challenge for Lowry, to place handcuffs on a guard who averaged 35 points in five games (four vs. Blazers, one Rockets) without Kevin Durant and bring the same energy on the other end to ease the load from Kawhi Leonard. Lowry didn\u2019t check a big-time scorer in any of the three rounds: DJ Augustin, JJ Redick, Eric Bledsoe. 3. Will any readjusting be necessary if and when Kevin Durant returns? This is one of the more confounding debates raging outside the Warriors\u2019 organization. There shouldn\u2019t be any discomfort with Durant back in the fold unless you weigh the last four weeks over the previous two seasons. Besides, he\u2019s surrounded by the most unselfish teammates he\u2019ll likely ever have, starting with Curry. 6.2 \u2014 Through the first three rounds of the playoffs, the Warriors have outscored their opponents by 6.2 points per 100 possessions. That\u2019s their worst mark through the first three rounds over this stretch of five straight trips to The Finals. Over the previous four years, the Warriors lowest point differential through three rounds was plus-6.4 in 2016 , the year they lost in The Finals. Time will tell if the lower point differential is an indication that the Warriors are beatable (again). What we do know now is that, statistically, they just haven\u2019t been as good as they were the last two years. All six of their conference semifinal games against the Houston Rockets were within five points in the last five minutes . And though they swept Portland in the conference finals, they trailed for 51 percent of the minutes in that series and by at least 17 points in each of the last three games. It\u2019s on defense where the Warriors haven\u2019t been as strong this year. In each of the previous four years, they allowed fewer points per 100 possessions than the postseason average through the first three rounds (5.3 fewer than the average in 2015, 1.6 fewer in \u201916, 8.7 fewer in \u201917, and 6.5 fewer in \u201918). In these playoffs, they\u2019ve allowed 110.2 points per 100 possessions, a mark which ranks ninth among the 16 teams and is 1.8 points per 100 possessions more than the average (108.4). Of course, the Warriors\u2019 offense, despite the absence of Kevin Durant for the last five games, has never been better. Over 16 games, the Warriors have scored 116.4 points per 100 possessions, 8.0 more than the league average. And ridiculously efficient offense just might be enough for a third straight championship. \u2014 John Schuhmann The pick  The Raptors rolled the dice last summer to get Kawhi Leonard and even if they lose this series and he leaves through free agency, it was a gamble well worth taking if only because they\u2019re in the NBA Finals. Canada will be forever grateful. Still, in spite of that, and also Kawhi\u2019s sizzling playoff run, Toronto is at a disadvantage everywhere except fan support. A fully-loaded Warriors team wins easily. A team with Kevin Durant missing a pair of games wins a little less easily. Warriors in 5.

Before they get it, though, they\u2019ll need to get one. And one would be beyond cool. Off the charts, historic, potentially transformative and largely indescribable. Twenty-one: That\u2019s how many teams in NBA playoff history will have overcome an 0-2 start to win a best-of-seven series, if the Raptors manage to close out the Milwaukee Bucks in the Eastern Conference finals. Whether it happens in Game 6 Saturday night at Scotiabank Arena or in Game 7 back in Milwaukee Monday, Toronto would buck outlandish odds \u2014 this is the 289th series to begin with the same team winning the first two games, so we\u2019re talking a 7 percent likelihood (20 of 288). One: That\u2019s all that stands between the Raptors and the first NBA Final appearance in Toronto franchise history. One more victory in the next three days would validate the risks and twists of this 2018-19 season for the Raptors, while exorcising nearly a quarter century\u2019s worth of demons. One little win and Toronto finally will break through, capping a stellar six-year run of promising regular seasons and heartbreaking postseasons. They will have earned, in the face of so much uncertainty, their best shot yet at a championship, even if it means going through the mighty Golden State Warriors. When Raptors president Masai Ujiri traded for star forward Kawhi Leonard, he was gambling not just that Leonard could recover from the right quadriceps injury that scuttled his 2017-18. He was guessing that swapping in Leonard for former All-Star wing DeMar DeRozan could push Toronto to, well, right where they\u2019re at. And he was hoping Leonard, a rent-a-player able to leave this summer in free agency, would enjoy the whole experience enough to let Ujiri pay him $220 million over the next five seasons. It\u2019s impossible to know where things stand on that last front, owing to Leonard\u2019s inscrutability and a decision that\u2019s still six weeks away. But the Raptors never have gotten this far, so there is an opportunity here to be savored, with more potentially to come. \u201cIt would be a very, very long summer thinking about what could have been or what you could have done,\u201d guard Fred VanVleet said, framing things a bit negatively after raining 7-of-9 3-pointers on Milwaukee in the 105-99 Game 5 victory . \u201cSo we\u2019ve just got to go out there and have no regrets. \u2026 One win away from the Finals sounds pretty good to me.\u201d Sounds a little easier, maybe, than it actually will be. The Raptors are at home for Game 6 and the crowd at Scotiabank crowd, already dialed high, will be able to let it rip without any fear \u2014 immediate fear, anyway \u2014 of failure. But Milwaukee will be desperate. Giannis Antetokounmpo has pledged that his team will not \u201cfold.\u201d And the Bucks have zero interest in a knock-knock year, believing all season that they were good enough to reach and win the championship. They wouldn\u2019t be human if they weren\u2019t shaken by the three consecutive defeats Toronto has dealt them. The Raptors have managed to surround and partially stifle Antetokounmpo, while still firing out enough to bother Milwaukee\u2019s 3-point shooters into repeated misfires. The Bucks\u2019 defense has been probed and poked like a cut-rate steak. They resorted again to some uncharacteristic switching in Game 5 but had most of their success inside the arc. Late in the pivotal loss, they got beat for five offensive rebounds, when grabbing two or three might have swung the outcome. \u201cIt\u2019s win or lose,\u201d coach Mike Budenholzer said Friday in a conference call with reporters. \u201cWhen you win, there are things that [still] are concerning and unsettling that you need to work on and improve. I think there\u2019s just enough possessions where there\u2019s a couple of rebounds that stand out. \u201cCan we do a little bit better job in some of our activity in certain situations. Offensively, I think at times can our spacing be better and our ball movement be better? But I would say it\u2019s like a lot of games. We didn\u2019t get it done.\u201d One area in which Budenholzer refuses to budge, dire circumstances be darned, is in his use vs. overuse of Antetokounmpo. The load the Greek Freak carries when he\u2019s on the floor, the activity he generates, leads to fatigue and wear-and-tear that requires regular breathers. Extending his star\u2019s minutes, Budenholzer believes, would lead to less \u201cpeak Giannis\u201d rather than more, an inevitable tradeoff of quality over quantity. And the Bucks need every bit of Antetokounmpo\u2019s best, or what\u2019s left of it in their 97th game of the season. \u201cGiannis, it\u2019s so impressive what he does and how important he is,\u201d Budenholzer said. \u201cI maintain that him getting appropriate rest, appropriate kind of just a chance to catch his breath, refuel\u2026 At the end of the day, you need to be able to produce and perform, including in the fourth quarter.\u201d At the possible end of your season, though, you\u2019ll have plenty of time to refuel if the opponent pounces while your star sits. Said Raptors coach Nick Nurse, in his own teleconference: \u201cIt\u2019s a \u2018whatever it takes\u2019 game. It\u2019s an unlimited-minutes night. This is just like any other critical must-win game.\u201d * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

But it could have been much worse based on his split-second reaction to the injury he suffered late in the Warriors\u2019 Game 5 victory on May 8 of their Western Conference semifinals series with Houston. While Durant was later diagnosed with a right calf strain, he initially feared \u2014 along with many watching \u2014 that he might have torn his Achilles tendon based on the non-contact nature of the injury. \u201cI pushed off to run down court and I felt somebody trip me up,\u201d said Durant, who spoke about the injury for the first time on Friday. \u201cFirst thing that came to mind, \u2018Boogie (Cousins) said, Kobe (Bryant) said\u2026\u2019 that it felt like somebody kicked them (after they tore Achilles tendons). \u201cSo the first thing in my mind was to slow down and process what happened. Then I started walking, and I could put weight on it, and it wasn\u2019t as bad as I thought.\u201d But still bad enough that Durant has been out for more than two weeks, and has yet to be cleared for on-court activities. The Warriors announced on Thursday that Durant continues to make \u201cgood progress\u201d with the injury, and is \u201chopeful\u201d to return at some point during The Finals, which begin next Thursday and conclude, if it lasts all seven games, on June 16. \u201cI\u2019m just taking it a second at a time,\u201d Durant said. \u201cI don\u2019t really know too much about this injury. I\u2019m just leaving it up to the team doctors.\u201d The Warriors can at least count on the return of veteran reserve Andre Iguodala (calf), who is expected to return for Game 1, and perhaps All-Star center DeMarcus Cousins (quad), who the Warriors expect to return at some point during The Finals.  Warriors coach Steve Kerr said both players participated in a full team scrimmage on Friday, with no restrictions on contact or playing time. Durant, he said, sat out as he continues to rehab.

Frank Vogel has no pressure as coach. He\u2019s into his annuity contract now, having already banked more cash than he ever imagined he\u2019d earn in his working lifetime. And he\u2019s a relative babe stepping into a forest of well-known dysfunction, with assistant coach Jason Kidd ready for his close-up as Vogel\u2019s particular Big Bad Wolf. No one\u2019s going to blame him for anything. Jeanie Buss is taking some hits now over pretty obvious mismanagement of personnel, if not business operations, but she owns the company . Pelinka has been outed by Magic Johnson, who remains an icon to Lakers fans, and Kobe Bryant\u2019s reflected glory won\u2019t save him from whatever goes wrong next. He has run out of cover and he\u2019s on the clock. Shaun Powell :  Let\u2019s break this down into a matter of who-is and who-should. Ron Pelinka is feeling most of the heat because Magic Johnson threw him on the griddle and Pelinka isn\u2019t well regarded by a segment of the league\u2019s GMs. But Jeanie Buss should be feeling heat because this is her creation \u2014 however, as the owner, she can turn invisible and leave Pelinka and Frank Vogel to deal with the fallout. John Schuhmann :  I don\u2019t know if Jeanie Buss is feeling pressure, because the Lakers are still the Lakers making a ton of money, despite the six-year playoff drought. But success and failure in this league starts at the top and it appears that Buss hasn\u2019t been able to recognize the need for a entirely new and more robust basketball operations structure led by an experienced executive that will empower the people around him. Now, because she hasn\u2019t made the proper changes, it\u2019s on Pelinka to upgrade the talent around LeBron James and Vogel to make the most of whatever talent he\u2019s been given come September. Between those two, there\u2019s currently more pressure on Pelinka , given the lack of shooting on the existing roster.

And I thought this way even before the Raptors took a 3-2 series lead in the East finals Thursday night. Milwaukee\u2019s defense is stretched thin enough against Toronto, so the Warriors\u2019 firepower would be a huge problem. Especially when Kevin Durant returns, Golden State has defenders with whom it can swarm Giannis Antetokounmpo, even more effectively than the Raptors have or the Celtics (briefly) did. Draymond Green locked onto Giannis for four to seven games? Come on, that also would be a problem for Milwaukee. Frankly, I\u2019m not sure either of East finalists would get the edge at even one spot in a position-by-position breakdown. The only reason I think the Warriors won\u2019t sweep is, they\u2019ll have to deal with some shifting of gears once Durant and maybe DeMarcus Cousins come back. Might cost \u2018em a game. Shaun Powell :  Go with the Bucks because not only do they have an elite player, they shoot 3-pointers and play decent defensively. Both teams match up well if the Warriors aren\u2019t bringing Kevin Durant. Neither, however, matches up well if they are. John Schuhmann :  Despite their performance in Games 3-5 of the Eastern Conference finals, it\u2019s probably the Bucks. They\u2019re bigger and they have a lot of guards that can defend Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson (to some degree of success, at least). Their defense does allow a lot of 3-point attempts, but they are good at forcing the right guys to shoot those 3-pointers. In fact, the 7.6 3-point attempts per 36 minutes that Curry averaged against the Bucks was his lowest rate against any opponent . Of course, Toronto\u2019s defense has been fantastic throughout the playoffs, Kawhi Leonard has taken things to a new level, and the Raptors would also have a puncher\u2019s chance against the champs.

Wouldn\u2019t make sense. There\u2019s only one guy who qualifies then: San Antonio\u2019s LaMarcus Aldridge. He was one of the six forwards I chose \u2014 but LeBron James took his spot. Sorry, but I don\u2019t think you qualify as \u201cAll-NBA\u201d when you play only 55 games and work for a team that ends up in the lottery. Aldridge is a leader for the playoff perennial Spurs who gets taken for granted by being his same steady self season after season. He also loses style points as a throwback, a master of the 2-pointer rather than 2019\u2019s beloved 3-pointer. Shaun Powell :  This certainly sounds like a novel concept, but here goes: How about nobody? Klay Thompson didn\u2019t take it well but there are always borderline cases that could fall either way. Should he have been on instead of Kemba Walker because the Warriors win? We should penalize Kemba because of the poor moves by management, then? John Schuhmann :  The 15 guys are the same 15 that I had on my ballot (though not necessarily in the same order), so the answer is nobody! Bradley Beal, Klay Thompson and Karl-Anthony Towns all deserved consideration ; Parsing out the third-team selections certainly wasn\u2019t easy. The lack of team success definitely hurt Beal and Towns, while Thompson just didn\u2019t have as good a season as he had the previous couple of years. I gave the edge to Kemba Walker, given how much he carried his team (which was better than Beal\u2019s)."},{"id":33592,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/raptors-turning-bucks-strengths-weaknesses","date":"2019-05-24","title":"Milwaukee's strengths turning into weaknesses in East finals","content":"MILWAUKEE \u2014 The safe spaces into which the Milwaukee Bucks could retreat whenever circumstances grew relatively dire in their long and otherwise successful season are all but gone now. Their formula, which solidified into the Bucks\u2019 brand for 2018-19, was built on some basics that served them well in reeling off 60 victories in the regular season, snagging the playoffs\u2019 No. 1 seed and racing to a 10-1 mark to start the postseason before ever digging out their passports. Then they went to Canada last weekend and saw their game, apparently, confiscated by customs. All the constants Milwaukee came to trust and maybe even take for granted have abandoned them in the Eastern Conference finals . Against a Toronto Raptors squad ready and eager to pounce, the Bucks have been laid bare. Their strengths look now like flaws, the pillars on which they made their case as the NBA\u2019s stingiest defense and fourth-ranked offense have turned wobbly. The Raptors, clawing out of a 2-0 hole in the best-of-seven series, have caught and passed the Bucks. They lead 3-2 after their impressive 105-99 victory Thursday night at Fiserv Forum \u2014 the first in the series by a road team \u2014 and can eliminate Milwaukee as soon as Game 6 Saturday in Toronto ( 8:30 ET, TNT ). \u201cObviously,\u201d Bucks star forward Giannis Antetokounmpo said late Thursday, \u201cI\u2019m pissed.\u201d He should be. He and his team had to deal with the hardship of losing two games in a row only once all season. Bouncing back immediately became a source of pride, an excellent habit in an 82-game regular season but something even more valuable for the postseason, where a series can swing fast. Well, the resilient Bucks have lost three in a row, picking the worst time to dabble in a real losing streak. If it reaches four, Antetokounmpo won\u2019t just be, er, peeved \u2026 he\u2019ll be eliminated. That\u2019s just one of several comfort zones in which the Bucks can no longer take solace. This was a team that won 45 games by 10 points or more, routinely turning big leads into bigger ones. Milwaukee was 64-7 during the regular season in games it led by double digits and 9-0 in the playoffs \u2026 until Thursday. By the end, the 18-4 lead they\u2019d opened early in Game 4 just meant the Raptors outscored them by 20 over the remaining 41 minutes. Milwaukee didn\u2019t face an abundance of close games, but when it did, it prided itself on late-game execution. The Bucks knew how to nurse leads, winning 60 of the 63 games they led after three quarters and all nine in which they\u2019d done so in the playoffs. Until, again, Thursday. The fourth quarter they began with a 75-72 lead got taken from them by a Toronto team that outworked them down the stretch. Three more hallmarks of Milwaukee\u2019s season \u2014 defending without fouling, defensive rebounding and 3-point shooting \u2014 got stripped away in one hellish period. The Bucks committed 10 fouls in the fourth quarter , sending Raptors players to the line for 14 free throws and getting outscored on the freebies by six in the quarter and 12 in the game. They did fine on the boards overall but let Toronto grab five offensive rebounds, all in the game\u2019s final 6:25 . That stymied and then snuffed the Bucks\u2019 chances to come back. Pascal Siakam grabbed a missed layup by Norman Powell and finished with a putback dunk to make it 89-81. Marc Gasol and Siakam extended a possession soon after by claiming Toronto misses, setting up Gasol\u2019s 3-pointer to make it 92-85. We\u2019re not gonna fold. We\u2019re not gonna fold. We [were] the best team in the league, we\u2019re not gonna fold. We\u2019re gonna go give everything we\u2019ve got.\u201d Giannis Antetokounmpo No sooner had Antetokounmpo thrown down an alley-oop dunk to close to 96-95, then Kawhi Leonard managed to launch a 28-footer that missed \u2014 and scoot in to grab the ball as it fell off the rim. Antetokounmpo fouled, sending Leonard to the line to push the lead back to three with 1:48 left. The fifth nail came in the final minute, with Toronto up 99-97. Leonard missed from the right side and Gasol managed to seal the ball from Brook Lopez. Lopez fouled, so the Raptors center hit one of two free throws to crack 100. A poor pass by Eric Bledsoe turned into a turnover off Malcolm Brogdon. Then the Bucks pressed Toronto hard, leaving Siakam alone on the baseline for a dunk that sealed it. But clearly, any two of those offensive boards \u2014 by a Bucks team that led the NBA in defensive rebounding percentage (80.3) \u2014 might have swung the momentum at the end and the outcome. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get [them], find a way,\u201d Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. \u201cAll five guys gotta participate.\u201d Oh yeah, that reminds us: Milwaukee had nine guys participating earlier in this series, as well as in the first-round series vs. the Detroit Pistons and the East semis against the Boston Celtics. Budenholzer makes one tweak to his lineup, moving Brogdon back into a starting job in place of Nikola Mirotic, and poof! The bench produced only 15 points, 20 fewer than Toronto\u2019s. That leaves 3-point shooting as the most vital component of Milwaukee\u2019s game suddenly gone fallow. This marked the seventh consecutive game in which the Bucks made a third or fewer of their 3-point attempts. They were 10-of-31 in Game 5, so 59-of-195 in this series. That\u2019s a 30.3-percent success rate, significant slippage from their 35.3-percent accuracy in the regular season. How significant? At 30.3 percent, the Bucks would have made 156 fewer 3-pointers. That\u2019s 468 fewer points scored, which would have dropped Milwaukee from the league\u2019s top scoring team (9,686) to No. 13. More than that, the live-by-the-3 ethos became part of their team\u2019s bravado. Budenholzer believed that, even allowing for some chilly shooting nights, counting by 3-pointers would prevail at least four times in any seven games. The Bucks still haven\u2019t gotten shy about taking them. They just haven\u2019t found a fix for making them. Some in the Milwaukee camp were bemoaning the number of uncontested looks their shooters missed in Game 4. Raptors coach Nick Nurse, without specifics readily available right after Game 5, thought his team might have yielded even more open looks Thursday. Still, when the clangs mount to the point that a trend is apparent, you have to consider there is more in play than bum luck. Maybe tight game situations lead to nerves. Or desperation. \u201cIt can be anything,\u201d Nurse said. \u201cI think it can be your defense is flying around a little bit and you\u2019ve got them hearing footsteps. Or you\u2019ve played a lot of minutes. I don\u2019t know, maybe if it\u2019s a big tall guy coming out at you and you aren\u2019t that big.\u201d The only thing worse for Milwaukee than its 3-point percentage is 20 of 288 (6.9 percent) \u2014 which is how many teams that built 2-0 leads in a best-of-seven series lost anyway. The Bucks were being reminded after Game 5 of the prickly Celtics team they\u2019d beaten two weeks ago, after Boston won the series opener, then went belly-up in the next four. \u201cWe\u2019re not gonna fold,\u201d Antetokounmpo said. \u201cWe\u2019re not gonna fold. We [were] the best team in the league, we\u2019re not gonna fold. We\u2019re gonna go give everything we\u2019ve got. You\u2019re not gonna go there and \u2026 even if they set a great tone [in Game 6] and hit us in the mouth first, you can\u2019t fold. \u201cObviously, I\u2019m pissed. I\u2019m not going to lie to you. But you\u2019ve just got to keep your head up. Keep having that confidence. Try to pick up your teammates and tell them they can do this. \u2018We\u2019ve got two more games to go, and we can do this.\u2019 \u201d * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

But Game 5 of the Eastern Conference finals brought something new. Leonard scored 35 points in the biggest win in Toronto Raptors franchise history, a 105-99 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks that gave the two-seed a 3-2 series lead with Game 6 in Toronto on Saturday. Fifteen of those 35 points, including two huge step-back 3-pointers over the seven-foot-tall Brook Lopez, came in the fourth quarter . That wasn\u2019t the new part. This was Leonard\u2019s seventh game of 35 or more points in this postseason. And you might recall a couple of big fourth-quarter shots over a seven-footer in the last series. Leonard also played smothering defense on Giannis Antetokounmpo. That wasn\u2019t new either. Since Game 3, Leonard, with plenty of help from his teammates, has made the presumed Kia MVP look somewhat mortal. The new part was the nine in the assists column. In 570 career games (regular season and playoffs combined) prior to Thursday, Leonard had never recorded nine assists. That he did it in Game 5 of the Eastern Conference finals on the road and against the league\u2019s No. 1 defense says a lot about Leonard as a big-game star. That, given his star status, he had never had nine assists before just as much about his history as a playmaker. Leonard may be the most complete player in the game right now, but his passing can still get better. It doesn\u2019t come naturally to him. In regard to making his teammates better, Leonard is certainly not LeBron James. And you can even say that Antetokounmpo, still emerging as a superstar himself, has been better at reading the defense and finding open shooters. In the regular season, Leonard recorded assists on just 12.2 percent of his possessions, the fifth-lowest rate among 35 players with a usage rate of 25 percent or higher. And his assist rate has actually been lower ( 11.7 percent ) in the playoffs. But over the last two series, Leonard has been the focus of the Philadelphia and Milwaukee defenses. At times, he has tried to score through multiple defenders. Given that his teammates weren\u2019t willing or able to do much offensively themselves \u2014 and because he was scoring so efficiently \u2014 he was probably right to force things. Leonard forced little on Thursday. He drove into the teeth of the Bucks\u2019 defense, saw where the help was coming from, and made the right play. \u201cWe keep stressing that in this series and in the last series, too,\u201d Nurse said. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve drawn two, you\u2019ve done your job. You\u2019ve got to find the guy who\u2019s open.\u201d On the 22 possessions in which Leonard drove, the Raptors scored 29 points \u2014 10 from Leonard himself and 19 from his teammates. \u201cPretty much try to stay with a consistent mindset throughout the whole game,\u201d Leonard said of his performance. \u201cJust trying to read the defense throughout the entire game, see what\u2019s working.\u201d It was all working, whether it was Leonard calling his own number or making plays for others. And it certainly helps that the others have seemingly found their mojo. Fred VanVleet, who shot 6-for-42 over a nine-game stretch from Game 2 of the conference semis through Game 3 of this series, is a 63 percent shooter (10-for-12 from 3-point range) when he has more than one child. All of Leonard\u2019s nine assists in Game 5 were on 3-pointers \u2014 meaning he accounted for 62 (59 percent) of the Raptors\u2019 105 points via his own points and assists \u2014 and four of them were to the dad who hasn\u2019t slept much since Fred Jr. was born on Monday. \u201cAny time he chooses to get the rest of us involved,\u201d VanVleet said of Leonard, \u201cit\u2019s going to bode well for our offense. The rest of us just got to be ready to step up and knock them down.\u201d VanVleet had both the biggest shot of the night \u2014 a 3-pointer from the right wing off a Leonard kick-out that broke a 93-93 tie with 2:19 to go \u2014 and the quote of the night when asked about his formula for success: \u201cZero sleep, have a lot of babies, and go out there and let loose.\u201d The Raptors\u2019 offense has been the biggest key to this series, because Toronto\u2019s defense \u2014 when it has been set \u2014 has been tremendous. It has kept Antetokounmpo from getting all the way to the basket while being able to recover out to and contest the Bucks\u2019 shooters. While the Raptors scored 1.32 points per possession when Leonard drove in Game 5, the Bucks scored at a rate less than half of that (0.57, 12 points on 21 possessions) when Antetokounmpo drove. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to play good offense,\u201d Nurse said, \u201cnot turn it over and score the basketball, because if you don\u2019t, they\u2019re getting what they want, which is downhill basketball in a hurry. If we can score it, if we can take care of it, we can get our defense set up, for the most part we get down and guard them and make the shots a lot tougher.\u201d Just six days ago, the Raptors were a possession away from falling into an 0-3 hole, one that no team in NBA history has ever come back from. Now, they\u2019ve won three straight games against the team that hadn\u2019t lost three straight all season. After scoring less than a point per possession over the first two games of this series, the Raptors have scored 110.3 per 100 over the last three . The defense feeds off of the offense. And the offense feeds off of the star that keeps taking things to a new level. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of the moment,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cI enjoy it.\u201d The Kawhi Leonard that we saw in Games 1-4 against Philadelphia (when he averaged 38.0 points on 62 percent shooting) was a preposterously efficient scorer, good enough to keep his team even in the second round. The Kawhi Leonard that we saw on Thursday has his team playing even better \u2026 and just one win from the NBA Finals. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

(AP) \u2014 Kevin Durant won\u2019t be ready to play in time for Game 1 of the NBA Finals on May 30 . The two-time reigning finals MVP has yet to return to on-court work while recovering from a strained right calf . Big man DeMarcus Cousins might be healthy for Golden State\u2019s series opener against either Milwaukee or Toronto. \u201cPotentially,\u201d coach Steve Kerr said Thursday, \u201cbut it\u2019s up in the air.\u201d The team re-evaluated both players Thursday and they are expected to be ready at some point during Golden State\u2019s fifth straight finals. Durant is making progress in the training room and with moves he is able to handle in the weight room, Kerr said. \u201cWe\u2019ve known all along, it\u2019s how he responds. There\u2019s never been a point during this process where we\u2019ve been able to say, `he\u2019s going to play on such and such date,\u2019 and there still isn\u2019t, so we just keep going, keep moving forward,\u201d Kerr said. \u201c\u2026 But again, he hasn\u2019t spent any time on the court with us, hasn\u2019t gone through an individual shooting workout.\u201d Cousins is working back from a torn left quadriceps muscle sustained in Game 2 of the first round against the Clippers. He practiced Thursday for the first time since getting injured April 16 in just his second career playoff game. \u201cWe\u2019ll see where my body takes me and we\u2019ll see what happens,\u201d Cousins said. \u201cI feel good, a lot better than I was, I\u2019m in a better place. I\u2019m able to get up and down the court more. I\u2019m able to play a little competition basketball.\u201d Andre Iguodala, who missed the Game 4 clincher against the Blazers with a sore left calf, didn\u2019t practice Thursday but is expected to be at full strength to start the finals. Golden State took two days off after completing a sweep of the Trail Blazers on Monday night in Portland. The Warriors will again take a day off Sunday and won\u2019t begin full game-planning until they have an opponent. Durant was averaging 34.2 points this postseason when he got injured during the third quarter of Game 5 in the conference semifinals against the Houston Rockets. He landed awkwardly on his right foot following a baseline jumper. Kerr wouldn\u2019t commit to a role for Cousins when he returns, unlike when the center returned from a nearly yearlong absence Jan. 18 following surgery for a torn left Achilles tendon and started immediately. It will depend on Cousins\u2019 health, \u201chow he\u2019s moving,\u201d Kerr said, how the series is going and matchups. For Cousins, just getting back on the court before the offseason and free agency would be a huge boost emotionally. Raising a championship banner would also mean so much after such a difficult year of rehab. The Achilles injury and recovery was \u201cone of my darkest moments,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a wild year for me all season,\u201d Cousins said. \u201cI\u2019m happy to be in this moment. If I get the opportunity to play I\u2019m going to take full advantage of it, leave it all on the floor.\u201d"},{"id":33614,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/raptors-lowry-playing-through-pain-east-finals","date":"2019-05-23","title":"Lowry not fretting over thumb pain as Game 5 nears","content":" * Tonight on TNT:  Game 5, Raptors vs. Bucks (8:30 ET) The Toronto Raptors have forged a tie in the Eastern Conference finals with the Milwaukee Bucks behind back-to-back solid performances from standouts Kawhi Leonard and Kyle Lowry. Both players, however, have been hobbled a bit by injury as Game 5 of the series looms. Leonard scored 36 points in 52 minutes in a double-overtime win in Game 3 on Sunday despite dealing with leg soreness. Time and again, he came up with clutch plays in that victory, but was a little less impactful in Game 4. Although Leonard finished with 19 points in 34 minutes, he appeared to hobble at times throughout that game. As for Lowry, he scored 12 of Toronto\u2019s first 17 points and finished with 25 points overall, going 10-for-10 at the free-throw line. On Wednesday, Raptors coach Nick Nurse said Lowry is definitely playing through pain in this series, while Leonard is apparently doing better than he appears to be. Lowry has been battling a left thumb injury that he suffered in the Eastern Conference semifinals against the Philadelphia 76ers. He has been wearing a specially designed glove that looks like an oven mitt to try and help speed up his healing process. Nurse said Wednesday that Lowry is admittedly still playing through some pain. When asked at Thursday\u2019s shootaround about any improvement in his thumb, Lowry flatly said, \u201cno.\u201d \u201cI will not be able to get it taken care of until after the season is over,\u201d Lowry said. \u201cIt hurts \u2026 it\u2019s pretty bad. We\u2019ve been taking things to make sure that during the game we try to limit the pain as much as possible during the games but, it is what it is. \u201cIt hurts on everything. Every time I use this hand, it hurts. But it\u2019s whatever. At this point, it is what it is. \u2026 I still got a lot more to give. My thumb being hurt, it is what it is, but other than that, my body feels great, my mind feels strong and that\u2019s the important thing.\u201d As for Leonard, Nurse said in a Wednesday conference call that his star forward is \u201cfeeling good. No concerns at this point. He\u2019s good.\u201d \u201cKyle\u2019s hand is not great,\u201d Nurse told reporters on Wednesday. \u201cYou know, he\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s hurt and it\u2019s sore and it causes him a lot of pain. But he seems to be able to manage it through the game and do what he can do. \u201cHe\u2019s obviously scoring and playing great on top of the other things he always does, and we\u2019re really [seeing] a heck of a lot of toughness and again, the spirit that he just wants to be out there and help his team any way he can.\u201d Nurse also said OG Anunoby does not have a timetable for returning from an emergency appendectomy that has sidelined the 21-year-old forward for the entire postseason. \u201cHe is being more active every day,\u201d Nurse said. \u201cI think we are getting closer to a point where we\u2019re \u2013 you know, unpack is the next step for him. He\u2019s moving pretty good, he\u2019s shooting, etc., but still a ways away from being able to take hits and contact in the areas that he needs to test out.\u201d On the Bucks side of things, coach Mike Budenholzer knows his team must get more from his bench, which has outscored Toronto\u2019s reserves 130-78 through the first three games of the series. In Game 4, it was a different story as the Raptors\u2019 bench, led by forward Norman Powell\u2019s 18 points, rang up 48 points Tuesday to help Toronto even the series. \u201cThey need to play well,\u201d Budenholzer said Wednesday of his reserves. \u201cI think our whole team, whether it be the bench or the starters, needs to be better defensively. I think there\u2019s things offensively where the bench can, you know, just like the rest of us, we have to execute a little bit better. \u2026 this series, the benches have been critical and very influential and credit to Toronto\u2019s bench, particularly. They really stepped up and had a huge game, and we need that from our group.\u201d Aside from that storyline, one involving rapper Drake has also gotten a lot of attention in the East finals. Drake\u2019s impromptu massage of Nurse\u2019s shoulders is getting a lot of attention, though the Raptors\u2019 coach said he didn\u2019t even realize it had happened. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know I got the shoulder rub last night until somebody showed me a picture today,\u201d Nurse said. \u201cI didn\u2019t even feel it. I was so locked into the game. Didn\u2019t distract me at all.\u201d Drake has been very animated at courtside, and Budenholzer said if the rapper steps onto the court, it crosses the line. \u201cI don\u2019t know how much he\u2019s on the court. It sounds like you guys are saying it\u2019s more than I realize,\u201d Budenholzer said. \u201cThere\u2019s certainly no place for fans and, you know, whatever it is exactly that Drake is for the Toronto Raptors. You know, to be on the court, there\u2019s boundaries and lines for a reason, and like I said, the league is usually pretty good at being on top of stuff like that.\u201d Drake took to social media to respond to Budenhozler\u2019s criticism, firing off a series of emojis on Instagram . He then did an Instagram Live post in which he linked a user\u2019s comment that read, in part: \u201cIf you don\u2019t want the opposing team to celebrate and dance, prevent them from scoring, winning, or achieving their objective. Get over it and keep moving.\u201d Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":33563,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/hang-time-podcast-raptors-bucks-east-finals-all-rookie-all-defensive","date":"2019-05-23","title":"Hang Time Podcast: Raptors even series at 2-2 + All-Rookie & All-Defensive teams announced","content":"John Schuhmann and Shaun Powell analyze the Raptors\u2019 win over the Bucks to even the East finals at 2-2.

Simmons leads a contingent of NBA players, which includes Deng Adel (Cleveland Cavaliers), Aron Baynes (Boston Celtics), Andrew Bogut (Golden State Warriors), Jonah Bolden (76ers), Matthew Dellavedova (Cavaliers), Joe Ingles (Utah Jazz) and Patty Mills (San Antonio Spurs). Austraila\u2019s roster will compete in the four warm-up games prior to the FIBA World Cup against Canada in Perth on Aug. 16 and 17 and USA Basketball in Melbourne at Marvel Stadium on Aug. 22 and 24. Australia\u2019s team, known as the Boomers, finished fourth in the 2016 Rio Olympic Games. \u201cNo doubt, we have the opportunity to put a great team on the floor and that\u2019s exciting,\u201d Boomers coach Andrej Lemanis said in a statement Thursday . \u201cWorking with the best players in the country is such an honour and privilege \u2013 I feel extremely blessed to again have this opportunity.\u201d  The Boomers will open their selection camp in early August before heading to Perth and returning to Melbourne for their warm-up games.

After Game 2, the Milwaukee Bucks looked like the best team in basketball. Now, their second two-game losing streak of the season has brought their first taste of playoff adversity. The Toronto Raptors, meanwhile, are very much alive after coming just a possession or two from a 3-0 deficit just a few days ago. They\u2019ve led for 61 percent of the minutes in this series and their complete victory in Game 4 \u2014 execution on both ends of the floor, contributions from the entire rotation \u2014 sets up a huge Game 5 back in Milwaukee . Have the Raptors found their mojo? Do the Bucks need to change things up? Here are some numbers of note with the series even at two games apiece. Game 4 was the Bucks\u2019 worst defensive game (120 points allowed on 96 possessions) of the postseason, and that was the focus of coach Mike Budenholzer\u2019s frustration Tuesday night. The league\u2019s No. 1 defense simply can\u2019t have the same kinds of breakdowns going forward. But the more consistent issues for the Bucks have come on offense, where they scored less than a point per possession in Games 3 and 4. Before Game 3, it was noted that the Bucks had been been beating the Raptors in the pace battle . Even with Toronto playing much better in Games 3 and 4, Milwaukee has still scored 30 more points (82-52) on field goals in the first six seconds of the shot clock. Of course, the counter to that is that the Raptors have been the better team in the half-court. When Milwaukee hasn\u2019t scored in transition, offense has been a struggle. And its in their numbers from beyond the arc where their half-court issues have showed up. In the first 12 seconds of the shot clock, the Bucks have shot 34-for-96 (35 percent) from 3-point range. In the last 12 seconds of the shot clock, they\u2019ve shot just 15-for-68 (22 percent) from 3-point range. Credit the Toronto defense, which has been terrific in its ability to show help on Giannis Antetokounmpo and recover out to the Bucks\u2019 shooters. Giving Kawhi Leonard the Antetokounmpo assignment for Games 3 and 4 has certainly had an effect. The Bucks have scored just 86 points on the 94 possessions (with Antetokounmpo shooting 7-for-23) that the Raptors\u2019 star has been guarding his Milwaukee counterpart. In the first half of Game 3, Toronto\u2019s inability to match up in transition led to four Milwaukee 3-pointers in the first six seconds of the shot clock. In the 82 minutes of game time since then, the Bucks have made just one 3-pointer in the first six seconds of the clock. It\u2019s probably not a coincidence that Game 4 was both the slowest-paced game (each team had the ball just 96 times) and the Raptors\u2019 best game of the series. If Toronto can continue to avoid live-ball turnovers, execute offensively and match up in transition, the Bucks will need to find some more offense late in the clock. Improved offense could come with a lineup change. Budenholzer has made no indication that he\u2019s ready to change things up, but there\u2019s both a reason and a convenient excuse to have Malcolm Brogdon start Game 5. The reason? The Bucks\u2019 starting lineup has been outscored by nine points in 41 minutes in this series , having scored just 90 points on its 93 offensive possessions . Nikola Mirotic (6-for-28 from 3-point range in the series) hasn\u2019t been the worst shooter in the starting lineup. That would be Eric Bledsoe, who is 11-for-45 , including 2-for-19 from 3-point range, over the four games. But while Mirotic is always an effective floor spacer (because he\u2019s always a threat to shoot out to 28 feet), Brogdon is a more dynamic offensive player. As a fourth ball-handler in the lineup, Brogdon could push the ball into more transition opportunities. In the half-court, he would be more successful in attacking Toronto\u2019s close-outs. Also, he\u2019s averaged almost four times as many drives per 36 minutes (12.7) as Mirotic (3.5). To date in the East finals, Milwaukee\u2019s offense has been at its best \u2014 scoring 113.4 points per 100 possessions \u2014 with Brogdon on the floor. He has the best plus-minutes in the series , with the Bucks having outscored the Raptors by 26 points in his 116 minutes. Mirotic has the worst plus-minus in the series (by a wide margin), with the Raptors having outscored the Bucks by 26 points in his 102 minutes. Swapping Brogdon for Mirotic is just a return to the Bucks\u2019 old starting lineup, which played 597 minutes together in the regular season . It wasn\u2019t the most dominant lineup in the league \u2014 its mark of plus-6.2 points per 100 possessions ranked 19th among 40 lineups that played at least 200 minutes together \u2014 but it\u2019s a plus-10 in just 10 minutes in this series. The Bucks are 10-3 in these playoffs, but they\u2019ve lost the first quarter in eight of their last 10 games. A lineup change probably couldn\u2019t hurt. In Games 1 and 2, the Bucks outscored Toronto, 41-21, on second-chance points . In Games 3 and 4, second-chance points were even at 26 for each team. The Raptors were able to fix their rebounding issues without going to their big lineup. Playing Serge Ibaka and Marc Gasol together helped them rebound better in the Philadelphia series, but the two bigs played just 10 minutes together in Games 3 and 4. In total, Ibaka and Gasol have played 22 minutes together in the conference finals after playing 77 minutes together over the last four games of the Philly series. Among the Raptors\u2019 eight rotation guys, their defensive rebounding percentage has been highest (they\u2019ve grabbed 74.5 percent of available defensive boards) with Norman Powell on the floor . The Raptors were obviously the more desperate team in Games 3 and 4. Now both teams are two games from The Finals and two games from the end of their season. That should make for an intense Game 5. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

(AP) \u2014 Juwan Howard is coming back to Michigan. The former member of the Fab Five agreed to a five-year deal, which will pay him $2 million in his first year, on Wednesday to lead the Wolverines. \u201cAs a \u2018Michigan Man\u2019 I know the place our program has in college basketball and I embrace the chance to build onto that history and lead us to championships both in the Big Ten and national level,\u201d Howard said. \u201cWe will continue to develop young men on the court, in the classroom and in the community that our fan base will continue to be proud of.\u201d Michigan athletic director Warde Manuel, in his first major move in three years in charge of the department, is giving the Miami Heat assistant coach his first shot at being a head coach other than during the NBA\u2019s summer league. \u201cWe have found someone with high integrity, great character and a coach who has unbelievable knowledge of the game of basketball,\u201d Manuel said. \u201cJuwan has proven himself to be a tremendous leader, a wonderful communicator and a developer of talent. We couldn\u2019t have asked for a better role model for the young men in our program. We are excited to welcome back a member of the family to Ann Arbor.\u201d  He replaces John Beilein, who left to coach the Cleveland Cavaliers. Howard helped Michigan reach the national championship game twice, playing alongside Chris Webber, Jalen Rose, Jimmy King and Ray Jackson. The school later removed the Fab Five\u2019s Final Four banners from Crisler Arena as part of self-imposed sanctions that stemmed from one of the NCAA\u2019s largest financial scandals. A federal investigation revealed now-deceased booster Ed Martin gave Webber and three non-Fab Five players more than $600,000. The NCAA forced the school to dissociate from the former players involved until 2013. The saga stained the university and basketball program, leading to many years of struggles. \u201cJuwan wasn\u2019t a part of that,\u201d Jackson told AP in a telephone interview. \u201cHe was never involved. And despite being part of the Fab Five, which is tied to Ed Martin, Juwan embodies the professionalism and positivity that Michigan represents across the world.\u201d Beilein became the leader Michigan needed, running the program without a hint of controversy and bringing the school back to the national title game in 2013 and 2018. The Wolverines also won two Big Ten season championships \u2014 accomplishments the Fab Five never achieved \u2014 along with a pair of conference tournament titles while becoming the school\u2019s all-time winningest coach. Although Howard doesn\u2019t have ties to Michigan\u2019s recent history with Beilein, his connection to the school is significant. Howard\u2019s hiring may bring a wave of excitement with endorsements from former teammates such as Webber and Rose along with LeBron James and Dwyane Wade. His coaching experience in the NBA also makes him an attractive coach for top prospects. Howard had been a candidate to be a head coach in the NBA, including at Cleveland coincidently. The 46-year-old Howard, who is from Chicago, played at Michigan for three seasons before Washington drafted him No. 5 overall in 1994. The two-time NBA champion with the Heat and one-time All-Star averaged 13.4 points, 6.1 rebounds and 2.2 assists during his career that ended after the 2012-13 season. Howard went into coaching after retiring as a player, starting as an assistant coach focused on player development with the Heat being promoted to an assistant coach with one of the franchises he played for during his 19-year career. The Heat had long been bracing for Howard to move up in the coaching ranks. They knew Howard\u2019s longtime goal has been an NBA job, but understood that if Michigan ever called, he would have to take a long look at the opportunity. \u201cI\u2019m happy for Juwan, Jenine and his family, and feel he is deserving of this opportunity to coach at the University of Michigan,\u201d Heat president Pat Riley said. \u201cHe is going back to a school and a conference in which he is revered. I think it is a great step forward for him and the university, and I wish him nothing but the best, because that\u2019s what he\u2019s given us.\u201d Howard was extremely popular in the Heat locker room as a player \u2014 he was a mentor of sorts during Miami\u2019s Big Three era with Wade, James and Chris Bosh \u2014 and getting him the long-elusive championship ring was a major motivation source for those teams. \u201cJuwan is an absolute star as a person, player and coach,\u201d Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. \u201cI feel he is more than ready. He is a terrific leader and mentor, which translates very well to the collegiate level. While we are losing a valuable member of our staff and a great friend, I am happy for him and his family. He will forever be a champion and part of the Heat family and I am excited to see him take the next step.\u201d Howard was the first member of the Fab Five to commit to play at Michigan and he later recruited Webber, Rose, King and Jackson to join him. \u201cHe\u2019s the forefather of the Fab Five,\u201d Jacksons aid. \u201cNow, look at his resume: two Final Fours, an Elite Eight and NBA champion. He\u2019s also a great man, who went back to get his degree after being in the NBA and that says a lot about him. He\u2019s always been focused and determined and widely respected.\u201d"},{"id":33590,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/unc-nassir-little","date":"2019-05-22","title":"UNC's Little eager to show he's ready for NBA","content":" If ever there was a college basketball player built to handle the hype and unrealistic expectations heaped on him by fans and the media, it\u2019s Nassir Little , who recently completed a freshman season\/career at North Carolina that many who don\u2019t know him would call star-crossed. Philosopher Nassir, as teammate and fellow future NBA lottery pick Colby White christened him, would beg to differ. Little \u2014 a 6-foot-6, 220-pound athletic swingman \u2014 came to the Tar Heels as the No. 2 player in the class of 2018, ahead of even Duke\u2019s Zion Williamson and just behind the Blue Devils\u2019 R.J. Barrett. Little was just the fifth player at the time to be chosen MVP of the McDonald\u2019s and Jordan Brand all-star games. He was destined to, as Little says, \u201ccome in, start, average 15 to 20 points and play 35 minutes. That\u2019s what people probably expected me to do.\u201d Instead, Little played behind Carolina stalwarts Luke Maye, Cameron Johnson and Kenny Williams, battled illness and injury and wound up the subject of scrutiny that has dogged him even into last week\u2019s NBA Draft Combine in Chicago, from which a major website ran a story that misconstrued the meaning of a comment he made. The story essentially said he passed the blame for a supposed underwhelming season on to his coaches at UNC. In Little\u2019s mind, there\u2019s no blame to place, as he said in another interview, this with NBA.com. Little\u2019s season \u2014 he averaged 9.8 points and 4.6 rebounds \u2014 was the one he was supposed to have. Like anyone else with even a casual interest in college basketball, Little was well aware how Williamson \u2014 he of the Tar Heels\u2019 archrival \u2014 emerged this season to become the national player of the year and the certain No. 1 pick in next month\u2019s NBA Draft. Williams and Barrett were both first-team All-Americans. Little averaged 18.2 minutes a game, and people who aren\u2019t familiar with the inner workings of the Carolina program wondered what went wrong. \u201cThis season was all about learning lessons,\u201d Little says. \u201cI think what people don\u2019t see is how much I learned, and the kind of experience I was able to gain. My entire life, I was a starter. I got all the shots. Now I know how to be effective in different roles. \u201cThat\u2019s something I can use going to the NBA, where everybody\u2019s talented. I think that gives me an advantage. Now I know how to come in off the bench and affect the game.\u201d Little proved as much as his freshman season progressed and he found his place in the Tar Heels\u2019 rotation. \u201cI\u2019ve been telling you guys all along that he\u2019s coming,\u201d North Carolina coach Roy Williams told the media late in the season. \u201cHe\u2019s coming, but it\u2019s just some guys, it takes them a little while to get more comfortable than other guys. The defensive end of the floor is what I\u2019ll point to again.\u201d It wasn\u2019t just Williams who noticed Little\u2019s comfort level had risen. \u201cHe is showing more and more now toward the end of the year why people thought he was one of the top players in the country coming out of high school,\u201d Florida State coach Leonard Hamilton said after a late-February game in which Little contributed 18 points and eight boards. \u201cI wasn\u2019t surprised he played as well as he is capable of playing. We expected that. He is an outstanding kid. I know him very well. He has high character and is loaded with talent.\u201d Little might not have been a first-team All-American, or All-Atlantic Coast Conference, as Williamson and Barrett where, but he was just the fifth freshman in North Carolina history to make the ACC All-Academic team. His fall semester GPA was 3.9. Again, to anyone who knows Little, this was no surprise. He was the salutatorian of his high school class after compiling a 4.2 GPA. This takes us back to Colby White\u2019s nickname for his teammate. Philosopher Nassir has been a deep thinker as far back as he can remember. \u201cI was always that kid that asked why about everything,\u201d Little says, \u201cand always wanted to know why things were the way they were and how they worked. As I grew up, it caused me to be more thoughtful about things and to be more analytical.\u201d Little may not have made the impact Zion Williamson did, but when he wasn\u2019t playing, he paid attention to his coaches and to what was happening on the floor. \u201cI\u2019ve always been a guy that had the capability from a physicality and athletic standpoint,\u201d Little says. \u201cCarolina helped me learn more about the Xs and Os of the game. About schemes. About understanding what it really means to play help defense. A lot of that I didn\u2019t know before.\u201d Darryl Hardin, director of the 1 Family AAU program in Tallahassee, Fla., has known Little since he was a 5-foot-9 sixth grader \u2014 \u201cI walked into the gym one day and saw this little kid hanging from the rim,\u201d Hardin says \u2014 and believes his thought process transcends the court. \u201cHe was in the ninth grade when he started getting scholarship offers,\u201d Hardin says. \u201cHe\u2019s always unselfish, but all of a sudden, he\u2019s passing the ball to his teammates more than before. I ask him what he\u2019s doing, and he tells me if he can get his teammates the ball and they score, they can get scholarship offers as well. That\u2019s the kind of kid Nassir Little is.\u201d  Philosopher Nas actually took a college philosophy course this year. But he didn\u2019t need it to know he sees the world differently than many of his peers, especially athletes. \u201cI\u2019ve tried to not make things so do or die,\u201d Little says. \u201cI just see things for what they are and try to learn from them.\u201d Little learned from his experience in Chicago, and he\u2019ll learn on the fly as he works out and interviews with NBA teams in the final month before the Draft. He\u2019s been training hard, working on what he perceives as weaknesses in his game. There\u2019s no telling how many jump shots he\u2019s launched since his season at Carolina ended, trying to gain more consistency. He\u2019d like to tighten his handle, and he\u2019s been watching NBA game tape, in an effort to fine-tune his decision making. \u201cIt\u2019s all about making quick reads and making the right decisions,\u201d he says. The final word on Little is his definition of the well-worn phrase \u201cwork ethic.\u201d Suffice it to say he\u2019s turned that over in his mind a time or two, and here\u2019s what he\u2019s come up with. It\u2019s the message he\u2019ll convey to NBA executives. \u201cPeople use the term work ethic, and a lot of guys say they have it,\u201d Little says. \u201cYeah, they might work out on the court. But work ethic goes beyond basketball; it\u2019s just an application toward life. I think I work hard in every facet of life, whether it\u2019s school, trying to help out my family, things like that. I think that\u2019s what it truly means to have a great work ethic.\u201d Spoken like a great philosopher. * * * Chris Dortch is the editor of the Blue Ribbon College Basketball Yearbook .

But Kawhi Leonard is most certainly dealing with some sort of leg ailment in these Eastern Conference finals . The most clear indication of that was a pronounced limp after he dunked on Giannis Antetokounmpo on the Raptors\u2019 second possession of the third quarter Tuesday night. Given how much the Raptors have depended on their star in this postseason, a hobbled Leonard, coming off a career-high 52 minutes in Game 3, would seemingly be a harbinger of doom. But the Raptors of Game 4 were not the Raptors of the conference semifinals, when contributions from the Toronto supporting cast were few and far between. Those Raptors, in the second half of a desperate Game 4 win in Philadelphia , basically went six deep. Those Raptors had just seven guys see the floor in all of Game 7, with Norman Powell getting DNP\u2019d with the season on the line. The Raptors that won this Game 4 by a score of 120-102 were carried by their bench. With Leonard limited and the team desperate to avoid a 3-1 hole in the series, Powell (18), Fred VanVleet (13) and Serge Ibaka (17) combined for 48 points and we\u2019re heading back to Milwaukee for a pivotal Game 5 on Thursday. At this time of year, you take the wins any way you can get them. But a comfortable victory that comes with good execution and effort on both ends of the floor is nice, no? And it\u2019s obviously a lot more reassuring to know that you have eight guys, instead of five or six, that you can count on to make plays and shoot with confidence when the call comes their way. \u201cIt\u2019s just a different series,\u201d Raptors coach Nick Nurse said of the fluctuation play of his bench. \u201cAnd it\u2019s been really interesting for me to see how things change so much from series to series.\u201d From game to game, really. VanVleet gave the Raptors important minutes when Kyle Lowry fouled out of Game 3, and he did hit a big shot late in the fourth quarter of that overtime victory. But he still entered Game 4 having shot a brutal 6-for-42 (including 3-for-24 from 3-point range) over the last nine games. On Tuesday, VanVleet drained a catch-and-shoot 3-pointer just eight seconds after checking in for the first time. He would go on to shoot 5-for-6, connecting on all three of his shots from beyond the arc, including a bank shot from the right wing when everything seemed to be going right for the Raptors early in the fourth quarter. He added six assists on a night that the Raptors had 32 assists on their 41 buckets, their second highest rate of the postseason . Early in that Philadelphia series, Toronto was better offensively when they didn\u2019t move the ball, because Leonard was so efficient shooting off the dribble and his teammates weren\u2019t shooting with any confidence. But the way the offense looked on Tuesday, with everybody getting touches, is likely more sustainable, even against the league\u2019s No. 1 defense. And despite the injury (and fatigue), Leonard was still able to get into the paint. He had a team-high 14 drives in Game 4, according to Second Spectrum tracking. \u201cThe great thing about having him on your team is he still gets all the attention,\u201d Lowry said of Leonard. \u201cWe fed off of that \u2014 drive, kick, swing. He gets in the lane, kick out. That\u2019s the benefit of having a superstar like him on the team.\u201d But while the Raptors were still feeding off Leonard, they knew they needed to support him more than they had been. In fact, they didn\u2019t run a single action for Leonard until their 12th possession of the game. And while the other starters did their part \u2014 Lowry finished with a team-high 25 points and Marc Gasol drained three 3-pointers (making him 7-for-14 from beyond the arc over the last two games) \u2014 it was the bench that really turned things up. Powell, the guy who played just four total minutes in Games 4 and 7 against Philadelphia, has emerged as a difference maker in this series. He has totaled 51 points over the last three games , shooting 5-for-10 on corner threes and providing some much-needed juice off the dribble. \u201cThere\u2019s some speed we need there with Norman,\u201d Nurse said. \u201cThere\u2019s some athleticism we need there with Serge. And there\u2019s some ball handling and running the club with Fred that we need. \u201cIt\u2019s really them playing up to their capabilities.\u201d Ibaka grabbed a game-high 13 rebounds in just 24 minutes, and also hit what was probably the biggest shot of the night. With about three minutes left to go in the second quarter, the Raptors had gone through five straight scoreless possessions and the Bucks had cut what was a 10-point deficit down to four. Ibaka set a ball screen screen for Kyle Lowry and then popped out for a 20-foot jumper from the right side of the key. He drained it and Milwaukee never got that close again. The points from the bench were nice, but just as important was getting stops on the other end of the floor. \u201cFirst of all,\u201d Nurse said, \u201cI want them to come in and hold their own defensively and execute the defensive schemes, and I didn\u2019t see many problems there. They were able to guard a bunch of different people.\u201d Playing well on both ends of the floor, the reserves pushed the game in the right direction. Powell was a plus-29 in 32 minutes, VanVleet a plus-25 in 25, and Ibaka a plus-24 in 24. Those are the three best single-game plus-minus marks in this round of the playoffs . The trio was playing so well that, with his team up 13, Nurse dared to begin the fourth quarter with Leonard, Lowry and Pascal Siakam all on the bench. And instead of the lead shrinking, it grew to 20 points before a pair of Khris Middleton buckets forced Nurse to call timeout with 7:23 to go. After playing 52 minutes in Game 3, Leonard played 34 on Tuesday. Siakam went from 51 minutes in Game 3 to just 23 in Game 4. And the pair combined for just 26 of the Raptors\u2019 120 points. The Bucks are betting that the Raptors can\u2019t pull off another performance like this. \u201cWe want the other guys to take shots,\u201d Antetokounmpo said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to keep being aggressive defensively on Kawhi, try to limit his shots. But at the end of the day, if guys come off the bench they knock down shots, we\u2019ve got to live with it. We\u2019re doing our job.\u201d The Raptors, meanwhile, hope this is just the beginning. \u201cThe biggest part is for our team to see how much success we can have when we play that way,\u201d VanVleet said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about me as an individual. Those same shots, if they go in, great, if they don\u2019t, we gotta keep taking them. I think that just trying to build on what we did as a team offensively, is the biggest part. Individually, that stuff comes and goes.\u201d It\u2019s now a three-game series to see who\u2019s going to The Finals. The Bucks have two of the remaining three games at home, but the Raptors have led for 61 percent of the minutes over the first four. And they now have some life off of what looked like a very shallow bench just 10 days ago. In addition to more firepower, a deeper bench creates more versatility. \u201cOne minute you say, oh, man, our big lineup is the answer,\u201d Nurse said. \u201cThen maybe a couple, seven days later, it\u2019s not. It\u2019s the smaller lineup or some faster guys out there that\u2019s the answer. That\u2019s been interesting to see. \u201cBut each game is its own entity \u2026 Let\u2019s see if those guys can bring that same pop and focus, determination on the road.\u201d * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

He didn\u2019t specify whether he meant against this particular opponent, so far in the 2019 postseason or across the expanse of the 95 games the Bucks have played since late October. So let\u2019s just say they were shoddy and haphazard enough in falling 120-102 at Scotiabank Arena to have undermined all three. Limiting this to the playoffs, the Bucks\u2019 work defensively ranked as their low point in 13 games against Toronto, Boston or Detroit. Their 125.0 defensive rating (points allowed per 100 possessions) was their worst by a wide margin; it had been 110.9 when they lost to the Celtics in Game 1 of the conference semifinals. Their three previous efforts against Toronto in this series were 101.0 in Game 2, 98.3 in Game 3 and 98.0 in the opener. Not to go decimal-point crazy here, but Milwaukee\u2019s defensive rebounding percentage (68.8 percent) also was their playoff worst. They\u2019d been far more conscientious on the boards in Games 1 (78.3), 2 (83.0) and 3 (78.5). Meanwhile, the Raptors looked awfully prosperous at the Bucks\u2019 expense. It was Toronto\u2019s second-best night of the postseason in offensive rating, in offensive rebound percentage and in assist percentage (78.0). None of the above is supposed to happen against the NBA\u2019s top-ranked defense overall in 2018-19. \u201cA little bit of everything,\u201d was how forward Nikola Mirotic explained the Game 4 unraveling. \u201cRotation. Defensive transition as well \u2014 we didn\u2019t show the crowd as we usually do. They beat us on the boards tonight.\u201d Said backup guard George Hill: \u201cThey\u2019re getting a lot of open looks. They\u2019re driving the ball hard. They\u2019re moving the ball very well. We\u2019ve just got to match their energy and match that style of play.\u201d There are two sides to these coins, and the Bucks were quick to credit Toronto\u2019s players for their offensive prowess. The Raptors\u2019 three reserves in coach Nick Nurse\u2019s eight-man rotation \u2014 Serge Ibaka, Norman Powell and Fred VanVleet\u2013 outscored the four bench players in Budenholzer\u2019s current rotation, 48-19. Having more scorers in rhythm stretched Milwaukee\u2019s defense in ways that the Bucks, reduced to Giannis Antetokounmpo and Khris Middleton as a two-headed threat, did not. And missing more than 70 percent of your 3-pointers \u2014 the Bucks have bricked 115 of 164 in the series \u2014 can fuel the other team\u2019s transition game. \u201cI\u2019m not sure a lot of [Toronto\u2019s big shots] were necessarily Kawhi Leonard-centric,\u201d Budenholzer said. Said Middleton, who had his finest offensive game of the series with 30 points but was just as culpable as his teammates defensively: \u201cWe didn\u2019t really take away one thing from them. For the most part, they got anything they wanted, from the paint to the blocks to the mid-range to the 3s.\u201d Milwaukee\u2019s defensive formula all season has been to limit the opponents\u2019 success near the rim, challenge them at the arc and limit their trips to the line. Well, the Raptors matched the Bucks in paint scoring with 40 points. They outscored their guests by nine points on 3-pointers. And they shot 27 free throws, making 24. All against a defense that had led the NBA in opponents\u2019 field-goal percentage (43.3) and in fewest points allowed on free throws (15.1 per game). It might be natural for foul totals to creep up in the playoffs, when teams get more physical and no one wants to yield easy buckets. It\u2019s understandable, too, that a team playing from behind most of the night can get desperate simply to end the other guys\u2019 possession and get the ball back, which also leads to fouls. \u201cThere are some that are going to happen, but there also are some fouls we need to be smarter about,\u201d guard Pat Connaughton said. \u201cI mean, try to be better. Get there earlier. We have to be a step quicker. We have to do a few things smarter when it comes to reaching. Just overall be a little bit more mentally tough.\u201d Connaughton played fewer than 14 minutes. But he was part of the meltdown too, with the Bucks outscored by 16 in his limited appearance. He and several teammates dismissed the possibility \u2014 an ominous one, frankly \u2014 that the Raptors have unlocked the Bucks\u2019 defensive code and now can attack them at will. But that doesn\u2019t mean there are leaks in need of plugging, pronto. \u201cPart of it starts with just making sure we stick to our core values,\u201d Connaughton said. \u201cThere were times we had a few breakdowns where they ended up getting layups. We\u2019ve been a great defensive team all year and one of the reasons is because we don\u2019t allow layups. We have each other\u2019s back, we scramble, things of that nature. \u201cIt seemed like they had a few open layups. They had a few wide-open 3s. When we\u2019re at our best, we\u2019re putting pressure on everybody . We\u2019re scrambling. It\u2019s not gonna be perfect [but] our strength is the athleticism and tenacity we play with on the defensive end. Tonight it seemed like they ended up with a few looks that we don\u2019t usually allow.\u201d Time and time again, the Raptors stayed patient to keep the ball moving in search of good, better and best shots. The Bucks also got caught chasing the ball, or ganging up two or three defenders on the ball handler until he dropped a little pass to an open mate. \u201cAnd it seemed there were a few times where they found the open guy after we collapsed on defense,\u201d Connaughton said. \u201cWhen we were able to run him off, they found the next guy. That\u2019s when there wasn\u2019t another [Bucks defender] to go. When we are at our best, we have more communication. We have a better sense of who\u2019s flying at who. We get back in the play.\u201d Connaughton spoke as well about Raptors blowing by him and the Bucks\u2019 other on-ball defenders. If it wasn\u2019t Kyle Lowry or VanVleet, it was Leonard slipping away from Middleton to receive a bounce pass for a layup or dunk. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to do a better job of keeping guys out of the lane so we don\u2019t have to help as much,\u201d Connaughton said. \u201cBut when we do have to help, we have to make sure we\u2019re scrambling as well as we have all season. \u201cThere are plenty of clips throughout the season where we\u2019ve had a guy running someone off the [3-point] line, and then all of a sudden he\u2019s got a contest three passes later when it\u2019s swung on the wing. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve got to get back to.\u201d That\u2019s what the Bucks\u2019 season might come down to. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Griffin reiterated this belief on Tuesday during a conference call to introduce newly hired GM Trajan Langdon . Griffin said the team plans to sit down with Davis and his agent Rich Paul in Los Angeles at some point soon. \u201cI think that\u2019s the next step \u2014 really to look each other in the eye and talk about what\u2019s important to us,\u201d Griffin said on Tuesday. \u201cAnd we\u2019re very optimistic from previous conversations with Rich Paul, his agent, and with all of the people here that know Anthony and know what he\u2019s about. We\u2019re very confident that we have a compelling situation for him here. \u201cAnd if winning is what he is indeed all about, which we have every reason to believe, we feel confident that we can create \u2014 and are creating \u2014 the right environment for Anthony and frankly for high-caliber players of all types to want to be a part of. This is something that we hope creates an energy that recruits itself, and Anthony would just be one step in that process.\u201d While Griffin and the Pelicans may be confident, there has been no public indication from Davis that he wants to remain with the team. The six-time All-Star told the Pelicans in January that he desired a trade and did not plan to re-sign with the team next offseason when his contract expires. Griffin also spent time on Tuesday talking about the team\u2019s plan for the 2019 NBA Draft . The Pelicans beat the odds during the draft lottery to receive the No. 1 pick in this year\u2019s Draft, which is headlined by top prospects Zion Williamson and Ja Morant. After New Orleans won the lottery, reports circulated that Williamson would need to be convinced to join the Pelicans. Griffin was quick to dispel those reports on Tuesday. \u201cI\u2019m certain that\u2019s a false narrative relative to the players that could potentially be the No. 1 pick,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cWe\u2019ve sat with multiple players that we\u2019re looking at for that first pick. In fact, in the case of Zion Williamson, Alvin Gentry and I sat with he and his parents the night of the lottery. [\u2026] And Alvin and I were also together in interviewing Ja Morant in Chicago as well. And I think because we sat with those kids, who are both incredible human beings and all about all the right things, we know unequivocally that either one of them would be thrilled to join us in New Orleans. And they\u2019re both very much excited about the concept.\u201d Griffin also discussed his early impressions of Pelicans owner Gayle Benson, who took control of the team after the passing of her husband, Tom, last year. Griffin credits Benson for empowering the team to pursue top-level talent \u2014 like Langdon and longtime Phoenix Suns trainer Aaron Nelson \u2014 to New Orleans \u201cIt\u2019s become something that it\u2019s very clearly her baby, and the Pelicans matter immeasurably to her. And literally in all these hirings, she\u2019s putting her money where her mouth is and she\u2019s empowering us to go and attract the best and the brightest,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cAnd I think when you win the lottery in the midst of all those other things, it starts to really lend itself to changing a narrative.\u201d Griffin and Langdon previously worked together with the Cleveland Cavaliers during the championship 2015-16 season."},{"id":33613,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/cavaliers-introduce-john-beilein-new-coach","date":"2019-05-21","title":"Cavs' new coach Beilein ready to turn things around","content":" INDEPENDENCE, Ohio (AP) \u2014 High on a wall and across the courts from where John Beilein was sitting, the Cavaliers\u2019 basketball history stared the new coach in the face. He wants to make it richer. \u201cLook at all those banners up there,\u201d Beilein said, pointing toward reminders of the 2016 NBA championship, Eastern Conference titles and division crowns won by the Cavs \u2013 most of them in the past decade. \u201cIt\u2019s been done before. Why can\u2019t it be done again?\u201d This basketball renaissance man is ready for his next recovery project. Saying he won\u2019t use the word \u201crebuild,\u201d Beilein was introduced Tuesday by the Cavs, whose surprising choice of the 66-year-old was met with skepticism only by those who haven\u2019t crossed paths with him over his more than four decades as a coach. Cleveland\u2019s expansive search ended last week with someone who has won at every level in college \u2013 most recently during a 12-year run at Michigan \u2013 and will now see if his team-first, family-oriented style can work in the pros. \u201cHe\u2019s all the things you would want in a head coach,\u201d Cavs owner Dan Gilbert said. Even before being escorted onto the podium by general manager Koby Altman, Beilein showed his eagerness to turn around a team whose run of four straight finals ended this season following the departure of LeBron James. The Cavs went 19-63 and parted with two coaches. About an hour before the news conference, Beilein peeled off his suit coat, went onto the floor and rebounded for Cavs forward Larry Nance Jr., one of the team\u2019s core players. Moments later, he chatted with point guard Collin Sexton, who had just gotten off a plane from the Philippines and was soon practicing a jump shot that improved dramatically during his rookie season. Beilein\u2019s first public moments as Cleveland\u2019s coach couldn\u2019t have gone better. He was joined by his wife, Kathleen, who has been with him every step of the way of a coaching career that began at Newfane Central High School in New York. All four of their children were in attendance along with four grandchildren, including grandson Johnny, who recently revealed to his grandpa that the Golden State Warriors are his favorite team. \u201cHere\u2019s the good news,\u201d Beilein said. \u201cBefore we were hired here, Cavs were No. 20 on the list. Now he says we\u2019re all the way up to No. 2. So that\u2019s good.\u201d Beilein said coaching in the NBA was never on his bucket list. While he accomplished everything in college coaching, the exception being a Division I NCAA championship, Beilein says he would have had no regrets had he finished his career at Michigan. But the chance to bring back the Cavs was too much to pass up. His courtship with Cleveland was a whirlwind. An initial meeting with Altman quickly escalated to Gilbert sitting in his kitchen to work out a five-year contract. As in previous stops at Le Moyne, Canisius, Richmond, West Virginia and West Virginia, Cleveland offers a challenge. \u201cRebuild is not a word we\u2019re going to use here, I saw it more as a renaissance,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s just change and let\u2019s see what we can through different trial and error. It was one (job) that was appealing to me. Every single time that we\u2019ve decided to do this, some people would say with every job, and probably with this one, `What are you crazy? Why are you doing that? And I say exactly that, opportunity and challenges go hand in hand.\u201d Beilein credits much of his success to his ability to connect with young players. He\u2019s changed with the times, adjusted to latest trends. He does have some old-school ways, but he\u2019s also open to new ideas, supplementing his message with analytics. \u201cYou can get too analytical as well,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to find the sweet spot, the ones that have been important to me for years and the ones that are important to NBA basketball and try to blend those two.\u201d There\u2019s another constant in Beilein\u2019s career \u2013 job security. He\u2019s never been fired. \u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d he said proudly, joking that Gilbert should handle the question about his reasons for taking the job. Beilein said he\u2019s never worried about anything but the present. \u201cCoaches, we don\u2019t complain on paydays,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s part of this job. You have to get it done and that\u2019s part of it. I\u2019ve been able to stay away from that and that\u2019s the only plan here: We\u2019re going to get this right and I\u2019m going to coach as long as I can coach and I hope that\u2019s a long time.\u201d"},{"id":33633,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-damian-lillard-get-supermax-extension","date":"2019-05-21","title":"Report: Lillard expected to receive supermax extension from Blazers","content":" The Portland Trail Blazers reached their first Western Conference final in 19 seasons thanks in large part to the play of guard Damian Lillard. Although the Blazers were swept out of that series last night, the franchise is apparently set to reward Lillard this summer. Lillard and Portland are expected to come to terms on a supermax deal this summer, which would be for four years and $191 million, reports Chris Haynes of Yahoo Sports . Lillard will qualify for that supermax deal if he is voted to one of this season\u2019s three All-NBA teams \u2014 an honor he attained for the first time in his career last season . Currently, Lillard is under contract for two more seasons and is owed $62 million. The reported supermax deal, should Lillard sign it, would keep him with the Blazers until he\u2019s 34 years old. Per Haynes, the new deal for Lillard is expected to include a player option, which is something he bypassed on his previous contract. \u201cWe\u2019ll focus on the [contract] later,\u201d Lillard told Yahoo Sports after Monday\u2019s 119-117 Game 4 loss in overtime to the Golden State Warriors, which ended Portland\u2019s season . \u201cLook at what we did this year,\u201d Lillard told Yahoo Sports. \u201cWe played without our starting center [Jusuf Nurkic]. We played without CJ [McCollum] toward the end of the season. So, looking at that, we were still able to get here. We were one step away [from The Finals]. And not only here, we had double-digit leads in three of the four games. I think getting here is reassuring that we can get the job done.\u201d This season, Lillard ranked ninth in the NBA in scoring (25.8 ppg), sixth in total minutes (2,838) and 12th in assists (6.9 apg). To date in the playoffs, he ranks fifth in scoring (26.9 ppg), ninth in assists (6.6 apg) and leads in total minutes played (650) . Known for his clutch scoring ability, Lillard scored 94 points in the fourth quarter in the playoffs, which currently ranks 3rd overall . He ranked 18th in fourth-quarter scoring during the 2018-19 season, the first time he finished outside the top 10 in that statistic in his NBA career. Lillard separated his ribs in Game 2 of the West finals but was playing through the pain. He averaged 33 points in the first-round playoff series against Oklahoma City but struggled against Golden State\u2019s defensive focus on him. Overall, though, this has been a successful playoff run for Portland and Lillard told Yahoo Sports he sees reason for optimism surrounding the team in the future. \u201cWe\u2019re one step away from the Finals, and I see it\u2019s the maturity and understanding how steady you have to be,\u201d Lillard said, per Haynes. \u201cWe played great in spurts. We had four great first halves. But those moments where we kind of let up and relaxed and we stopped doing the things that gave us that lead and they pounced on us because they don\u2019t change the way they play. They just keep going, keep doing the same stuff. They overtook every game that way. \u201cI think one of things we needed was experience and knowing what it\u2019s like to play this far into the season. We\u2019ve never been this far in the playoffs, so I think the experience is something you need. And obviously as players, we\u2019ve got to improve. We have to improve as players. We were in some positions where we weren\u2019t able to capitalize. All of us. From top to bottom. We\u2019ve got to improve. And once those situations present itself again, we\u2019ll be able to hold on.\u201d Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":33644,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/warriors-finals-appearance-driven-core","date":"2019-05-21","title":"Warriors' fifth NBA Finals appearance driven by depth","content":" PORTLAND, Ore. \u2014 When coach Steve Kerr came up with \u201cStrength in Numbers\u201d as the slogan as the latest \u2014 and one of the greatest \u2014 NBA dynasties took root, who knew it would remain in vogue five years running? It defined the Warriors then and still does today as they prepare for this final step of yet another chase of the Larry O\u2019Brien trophy in earnest, because it accurately captured the reality of these handicapped Warriors in the spring of 2019. Sure, don\u2019t get the logic twisted \u2014 this journey to June was greatly made possible by the core that first put the Warriors on the map, the players who proudly reminded everyone what they\u2019re still capable of doing with a Western Conference finals sweep of the Portland Trail Blazers . So let\u2019s give them the roll call they deserve: * Stephen Curry pieced together his finest performance in a playoff round. He averaged 36.5 points against Portland and sealed the 119-117 Game 4 overtime clincher Monday with a satisfying triple double: 37 points, 13 rebounds, 11 assists. If Curry indeed previously suffered from playoff poisoning for his good-but-not-great level of play in past Aprils and Mays, consider him cured. * Draymond Green was beastly on both ends throughout the series and also went triple Monday with 18 points, 14 rebounds and 11 assists. But that doesn\u2019t pinpoint his signature moment. With 39 seconds left in overtime and the Warriors nervously holding a one-point lead, Curry was trapped and threw to Green, standing by the 3-point arc. Why was he alone? Because the Blazers studied the scouting reports. During the regular season, Green shot 28.5 percent from that distance and his confidence understandably wavered. This time, there was no nerves or hesitation. There was nothing but net , biggest basket of the night in a series-clinching win. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s always great to have a guy of Steph\u2019s stature who if he takes that shot, nobody is going to be mad,\u201d Green said. \u201cNobody is going to complain. But for him to throw me the ball in that situation, it helps with my confidence, as well.\u201d * Klay Thompson  was once again a security blanket who not only averaged 22 points against the Blazers but played tough defense while matching up with Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum, a terrific backcourt that never really hurt Golden State. And yet, those three players don\u2019t tell the story of this win and this series. The real numbers came from the depth of the Warriors, who were forced to win this entire series without Kevin Durant and then Game 4 without Andre Iguodala . There was Kevon Looney and Shaun Livingston, Jordan Bell and Quinn Cook, Jonas Jerebko and Alfonzo McKinnie. Those bench players and role players stepped in and stepped up when given increased minutes and responsibility. More impressively, this took place in the thick of the playoffs, where there was no time for mistakes or jitters. With the exception of Livingston, none of the above were this battle-tested. Looney in delivered a particularly uplifting effort with 12 points and 14 rebounds Monday to repay the faith Kerr showed in him by keeping him on the floor in the tense, closing minutes of OT. \u201cWhen you\u2019re missing Kevin Durant, you can\u2019t replace Kevin Durant with one guy,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cWe had to replace him with three or four, night after night, and then without Andre, we had to find more minutes. We mixed and matched and tried to find combinations that worked and a lot of guys played really well over the course of the series.\u201d And that\u2019s why this series, to a significant degree, was all about Kerr, the confidence he showed in those players and how he cleverly put them in position to help. They set screens to spring Curry and Thompson, made subtle plays to keep possessions alive, occasionally made important shots or collected prized rebounds and minimized the key losses in personnel as best as possible. Consider that Kerr utilized seven different starting lineups in the three rounds, and in the close-out game had McKinnie and Bell logging their first playoff starts. Taken as a whole, and considering the situation, this was perhaps Kerr\u2019s finest work since the run of championships began in 2015 . \u201cHe used everybody on our team,\u201d gushed Warriors co-owner Joe Lacob. \u201cIt was amazing. Everyone made contributions. If ever there was a testament to what we call \u2018Strength in Numbers\u2019, this was it. Steve did a wonderful job finding the right players at the right time and they played with a lot of heart and got it done.\u201d What a powerful message the Warriors just sent through the league, one that certainly made its way to Milwaukee or Toronto, whichever city will get its chance to play the role of Goliath-slayer. The Warriors trailed the Blazers by 17, 18 and 17 points in the last three games of this series \u2026 and rallied to win them all. Golden State constantly came up with the right decisions and execution in the closing moments, repelling anything Portland threw its way. That speaks to the mindset of the Warriors and their understanding of what\u2019s at stake. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to win this thing,\u201d Green said. \u201cI\u2019ve been to The Finals and lost and it\u2019s no fun.\u201d They weren\u2019t better without Durant \u2026 but certainly more motivated. Not once did they take a nap, as they did during the regular season with Durant. \u201cAs much as we\u2019ve been here, we still don\u2019t take anything for granted,\u201d said Curry. \u201cWe don\u2019t want this to end as long as we can control it. Every single guy came here with that mentality, and then we walk off the court with some fancy hats and celebrating our fifth straight Finals. A pretty special moment.\u201d Kerr mentioned the trust shared by the Warriors and cited the shot by Green as the perfect example. \u201cI almost called timeout halfway through that possession,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cDraymond did what Draymond does. He hits big shots. He\u2019s a guy who hit five 3s in Game 7 of the (2016) Finals. Draymond is just a big-game player and Steph trusted him and obviously that was the shot of the game.\u201d The Western dominance of the Warriors makes them only the second team to reach five straight Finals , matching the Bill Russell-era Boston Celtics (always exclusive company). Of the 15 rounds in this now five-year Finals run, five were sweeps, two went to a Game 7 and they fought through three elimination games. Essentially, they\u2019ve been barely tested, and the best player from one team that nearly beat them \u2014 Durant on the 2016 Oklahoma City Thunder \u2014 ended up joining the Warriors in free agency that summer. He has now been out for nearly two weeks with a strained calf. The good news is the Warriors didn\u2019t need a future Hall of Famer to finish off the Rockets, or the entire series against Portland, and don\u2019t need him for another 10 days because \u2026 they\u2019re off duty. You see where this is headed, then. It sounds, smells and looks like another title, which would be three straight and four in five years. When the NBA Finals begin in either Milwaukee or Toronto a week from Thursday, the Warriors could look different. Figure on a rested and ready Durant, as well as Iguodala and possibly even DeMarcus Cousins, out since Game 2 of the first round with a quadriceps injury . (Durant is set to be re-examined in a few days and Cousins will be likewise before The Finals, but Iguodala\u2019s status remains unclear.) With each trip to the basketball promised land, the Warriors place another brick in their legendary foundation. They\u2019re chasing trophies and also history in the process. They\u2019re competing against the \u201cShowtime\u201d Lakers , the Larry Bird-Kevin McHale-Robert Parish-era Celtics , the Michael Jordan-era Chicago Bulls and the Shaquille O\u2019Neal-Kobe Bryant-led Lakers of the early 2000s . Their sustainability will be tested this summer when Durant, Cousins and Thompson become free agents \u2026 but that\u2019s a story for another time. In the here and now, this is a feat that may take years to duplicate. \u201cI hope it doesn\u2019t go unnoticed or underrated,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cIt\u2019s really, really, difficult. This group has a fiber to them. When goes go down, they find a way to come together and compete and win. I just think the experience of winning titles helps you in these moments and it helps you continue to move forward.\u201d Kerr had already stamped his trip to Springfield when he won his second championship. Now he attempts to breath truly rarefied air with his next step, one that he made possible by steering the Warriors without arguably the best player in basketball. The Warriors are bringing the experience, the motivation and most of all, the numbers to the next round. \u201cAs Draymond said, it\u2019s just an incredibly committed organization,\u201d Lacob said. \u201cEveryone in the organization is committed to being champions and winning. These players are indomitable. They just want to win so badly. It\u2019s hard to maintain year after year, but they\u2019re doing it. It\u2019s really exciting to see.\u201d * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years. You can e-mail him  here , find his archive here  and follow him on  Twitter  .

They join the 1960s Boston Celtics (10 total) as the only groups to do so in league history, outlasting both the LeBron James-led Miami Heat (2011-14) and Cleveland Cavaliers (2015-18), along with Larry Bird\u2019s Boston Celtics (1984-87) and the Showtime Los Angeles Lakers (1982-85). This marked the Warriors\u2019 second conference finals sweep in the past three seasons, and pushed the record of teams leading 3-0 in a series to 136-0 all-time. They were the only team in the past 20 playoffs to overcome 15-point deficits in three straight games. Individually, Stephen Curry scored the most points of any player to complete a four-game sweep, posting 146 in the series and besting Shaquille O\u2019Neal (2002 NBA Finals) by a point. Additionally, Golden State became the sixth franchise in the four major North American sports leagues to make five or more consecutive championship appearances. They joined the NHL\u2019s Montreal Canadiens and New York Islanders, the NFL\u2019s Cleveland Browns, MLB\u2019s New York Yankees and the NBA\u2019s Celtics. * * * And for the sake of nostalgia, here\u2019s a look back at each of the Warriors\u2019 last four West finals series \u2026"},{"id":33639,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/bledsoe-middleton-time-step","date":"2019-05-21","title":"Time is now for Bledsoe, Middleton to find their games","content":" TORONTO \u2013 Yes, Giannis Antetokounmpo had an uncharacteristically ineffective game against Toronto on Sunday. Everybody saw it, and everybody expects the Milwaukee Bucks\u2019 star to fire back more assertively in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference finals Tuesday night at Scotiabank Arena. And yes, the Bucks have gotten tremendous mileage out of their role players and reserves, guys such as Malcolm Brogdon, George Hill and Ersan Ilaysova, flexing a depth that at times has surprised even them in running up a 10-2 postseason record to this point. Meanwhile, critics tiptoe around Khris Middleton and Eric Bledsoe as if they\u2019re furniture in the locker room. A towel bin here, a water cooler over there, cut slack for performances that haven\u2019t been worthy of their status \u2013 both current and future \u2013 through three games of this best-of-seven series. It wasn\u2019t just that Middleton and Bledsoe, Milwaukee\u2019s starting backcourt these days, sputtered offensively in the 118-112 double-overtime loss Sunday. Each missed 13 of his 16 shots, scoring a total of just 20 points \u2013 about half what you might expect, given the 78 combined minutes they logged. Fact is, neither of them has shot or scored in the series they way they need to, either to push the Bucks closer to a dream Finals opportunity or to demonstrate that this memorable spring can be anything more than a one-off. Scan down Milwaukee\u2019s stats sheet through three games and, oh, there they are: Middleton (10.7) ranks sixth in points per game, Bledsoe seventh (9.3). They\u2019re both worse than that if you factor in court time; those two have logged more minutes than all but Antetokounmpo and, in Bledsoe\u2019s case, Brook Lopez. Oh, and there\u2019s this: Middleton is shooting 33.3 percent in the three games; Bledsoe, 23.7. On 3-pointers, it\u2019s 26.7 and 11.8, respectively. While Antetokounmpo\u2019s struggles and flaws come under the spotlight whenever they occur \u2013 and particularly in defeat \u2013 the failures of the team\u2019s Other All-Star and Almost All-Star pass almost under critics\u2019 radar. No longer. If Middleton and Bledsoe are good enough to merit the above labels, which they carried through the 2018-19 regular season, one or both needs to break out a game-altering offensive performance. More than that, if both are to be considered essential pieces of a Bucks core that wants to compete at this level again and again, they need to prove it. When Mike Budenholzer talked with reporters before his team\u2019s meeting and film breakdown Monday, he reminded everyone of the symbiotic relationship between his primary star and his secondary stars, as it plays out against Toronto\u2019s defensive scheming and swarming. Antetokounmpo\u2019s rough night trying to score (5-of-16, 2-of-7 from the foul line) did include seven assists, eight turnovers and a handful more passes that fizzled when the other Buck\u2019s shot missed. \u201cWe\u2019ve probably got to play a little better around him to make it harder for them to do that,\u201d Budenholzer said. \u201cY\u2019know, when everybody\u2019s playing well, then Giannis plays well.\u201d That doesn\u2019t mean Antetokounmpo rides any teammates\u2019 shirttails. It means, like most of the NBA\u2019s elite stars committed to winning, he instinctively tries to make the smart basketball play. When confronted with a double-team of defenders or a wall of bodies between him and his assault on the rim, Antetokounmpo naturally and reflexively looks to find an open teammate. The architecture of the Bucks is such that any number of his teammates, when open, can handle offensive responsibilities. That means hoisting a quality shot, often from behind the 3-point line, for several of the role players. But with Middleton and Bledsoe, it\u2019s supposed to mean facilitating what\u2019s left in the shot clock, making good reads of their own, sometimes creating their scoring chances out of thin air. It hasn\u2019t happened this series. Middleton\u2019s situation is complicated by his defensive assignment guarding Raptors star Kawhi Leonard. He has been sharing more of the duties with Brogdon as the series goes on, but it\u2019s demanding duty for both. The work is nonstop, beginning as soon as Toronto gets the ball and lasting until the possession ends. Again and again and again. Middleton tries to deny Leonard his touches, then rides the All-NBA scorer\u2019s right hand in hopes of forcing something awkward or undesirable. Asked Monday how one goes about simply \u201cstopping\u201d Leonard, Middleton seemed tempted to laugh. \u201cEverybody\u2019s been asking me that question all series. You can\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to have the ball in his hands the whole possession most of the possessions. He\u2019s going to force his way into the paint. He\u2019s going to force his way to his spots. He\u2019s going to shoot contested shots with one, two, sometimes three or four guys on him. He\u2019s going to hit some, he\u2019s going to miss some.\u201d Leonard is averaging 32.7 points in the series, 32.0 points in Toronto\u2019s postseason. He has shot 44.9 percent against the Bucks, 52.0 percent in the playoffs if you factor in earlier foes Indiana and Philadelphia. Much was made in Game 3 of Leonard\u2019s deployment on Antetokounmpo. He is, after all, a two-time Defensive Player of the Year. That level of focused attention played a role in the Bucks star\u2019s off night, and yet Leonard also managed to score 36 points to carry the Raptors, 19 of them in the extended game\u2019s final 22 minutes. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t on him the whole night,\u201d Middleton said. \u201cThey switched the matchups, like I said, to keep fresh bodies on [Giannis], to keep fresh bodies on other people. They trapped him also. So it\u2019s not like he was playing 1-on-1 defense against Giannis. Everybody knows, just like Kawhi, you\u2019ve got to guard him with the whole team.\u201d So there goes the theory that Middleton\u2019s energy for offense has been sapped by his obligations on defense. It\u2019s an easy out, but one that Middleton himself did not buy. \u201cNot at all,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think my defense has affected my offense at all. They\u2019ve just forced me to take tough shots and trapped me a lot of times. \u2026 I\u2019ve just got to hit shots, and I\u2019ll be ready.\u201d Bledsoe has been unreliable offensively since the playoffs began. And once he summitted the personal hump of facing and defeating Boston \u2013 the sturdy point guard felt embarrassed after last year\u2019s first-round loss against the Celtics \u2013 there has been no reserve fire or proficiency kicking in. Budenholzer and his teammates have praised Bledsoe\u2019s defense all season, including these three series. But his shooting has been a liability; the Raptors are all but begging him to launch open 3-pointers. He has made only 14-of-60 this postseason and just 2-of-17 vs. Toronto. It\u2019s understandable Budenholzer looked more comfortable with Brogdon and Hill as his backcourt late in Game 3. \u201cGeorge is playing with a lot of aggressiveness,\u201d the coach said. \u201cWhen Bled does those things, that\u2019s when he\u2019s at his best. \u2026 I think Bled will be better in Game 4.\u201d One of them needs to be. These are the teammates who will be judged as either good enough or not when Antetokounmpo\u2019s future whereabouts are determined. If so, the young star who seems certain to be one of the league\u2019s top two or three talents for years to come might be able to stay \u2013 and win \u2013 in Milwaukee. If not? The suitors will never shut up. Already, some Bucks and NBA fans have wondered if the four-year, $70 million contract extension Bledsoe signed late in the season might better have been reserved for Brogdon, who will be a restricted free agent come July. As for Middleton, he\u2019ll hit free agency with tremendous pressure on the Bucks to outbid other teams. He and Antetokounmpo are fast friends, and he was an All-Star, even if his reserve selection by the East coaches probably owed more to Milwaukee\u2019s record than to Middleton\u2019s individual work. His current body of work \u2013 right here, right now \u2013 needs some sprucing up. And Middleton might do well to heed his own words, when he was lauding Leonard\u2019s ability to defend and score, to dominate at both ends. \u201cI keep saying this over and over: He\u2019s a great player,\u201d Middleton said. \u201cYou can\u2019t stop great players. You can only make it tough on them.\u201d An affirmation seems in order, frankly. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Vogel\u2019s introduction as the Lakers\u2019 latest coach was almost overshadowed by comments made earlier by Magic Johnson . The former Lakers great appeared on ESPN\u2019s \u201cFirst Take\u201d and said general manager Rob Pelinka was largely responsible for his resignation as president of basketball operations and that Pelinka was talking behind his back, putting the GM in the position of using the Vogel news conference to respond. Pelinka said he has talked to Johnson several times since his resignation on April 9 and said Johnson\u2019s comments surprised him. Pelinka said the last time the two had talked was over the weekend. \u201cIt\u2019s saddening and disheartening to think he believes things are a misperception,\u201d Pelinka said. \u201cI think all of us in life probably have been through things where maybe there\u2019s third party whispers or \u2018he said, she said\u2019 things that aren\u2019t true.\u201d Vogel, who replaced Luke Walton, said the news conference took on a different tone than he imagined at the start of the day. \u201cIt was definitely different than I expected and different than I\u2019ve ever been a part of,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I understand the line of questioning in light of the events of this morning. So you just roll with the punches.\u201d LeBron James watched the news conference from the back of the gym at the team\u2019s facility, but did not shake hands with Vogel and declined interview requests. He shot baskets on another court while Vogel did one-on-one interviews with television reporters. Vogel takes over a team that has been in turmoil on and off the court. The Lakers have missed the playoffs for six straight seasons, a drought that was expected to end in James\u2019 first season. But injuries to James, Lonzo Ball and Brandon Ingram, as well as the internal discord, resulted in a 37-45 record. Vogel will be the Lakers\u2019 sixth coach since Phil Jackson stepped down after the 2010-11 season. The 45-year old Vogel worked for the organization before as an advance scout during the 2005-06 season. He did not coach last season following two years with the Orlando Magic. Vogel went to Orlando following five-plus seasons leading the Indiana Pacers, including trips to the Eastern Conference finals in 2013 and \u201914. He has a career record of 304-291. Vogel confirmed Jason Kidd will join his staff as an assistant and said it was something Pelinka brought up during the job interview. * * *"},{"id":33619,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-wolves-saunders-nearing-deal","date":"2019-05-20","title":"Wolves, Saunders agree to multi-year deal","content":" Minnesota Timberwolves interim coach Ryan Saunders is staying put in his role full time, the team announced on Monday. The team and Saunders came to an agreement on a multi-year deal early Monday morning. Wolves GM Gersson Rosas had reportedly interviewed several candidates recently for Minnesota\u2019s coaching job, but settled on keeping Saunders in that role. In addition to Saunders\u2019 deal, the Wolves also hired the Brooklyn Nets\u2019 director of global scouting Gianluca Pascucci as its new assistant GM, Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN reports. Pascucci had previously worked close with Rosas when both men were in Houston. Saunders finished the season as Wolves coach after the team fired Tom Thibodeau following a 19-21 start, and Saunders had the support of both All-Star center Karl-Anthony Towns. Rosas was hired to fill the team president role, one which Thibodeau held and was vacant after he was fired. The Wolves went only 17-25 under Saunders, but any evaluation of his strategic acumen would be incomplete and unfair considering the injury decimation of the roster. At any opportunity, though, Saunders and the players spoke highly of the improved team dynamic that emerged down the stretch. Subtracting intense personalities of Jimmy Butler and Thibodeau didn\u2019t produce a better winning percentage, but the communication process was after what Towns referred to as \u201cthe situation\u201d was clearly on the right track. Saunders made a strong impression on Rosas and team management and has met with Rosas several times since his hiring, Wojnarowski reported previously. Chris Hine of the Minneapolis Star-Tribune reports the discussions between Rosas and Saunders have been on a variety of on-court topics (style of play, player development, the use of an up-tempo offense) to off-court topics, too (communication, leadership and keys to success in Minnesota). Upon his hiring, Rosas credited Thibodeau for leaving behind a competitive roster, a team led by Towns with plenty of young talent and unrealized potential. The greatest immediate challenge to improvement, beyond the competition in the Western Conference, will be the salary cap. Maximum contracts for Towns and enigmatic sidekick Andrew Wiggins have helped push the Timberwolves close to the luxury tax threshold.

More than a month later, Johnson appeared on ESPN and said that Lakers general manager Rob Pelinka was the one who was \u201cbackstabbing\u201d him. Johnson did not hold back on \u201cFirst Take\u201d this morning , saying that Pelinka had circulated talk within the Lakers that Johnson was not working hard or showing up at the office enough. Upon stepping down from his role on April 9 , Johnson alluded to the fact he was tired of \u201call the backstabbing\u201d and \u201cwhispering\u201d going on within the Lakers organization. The Lakers hired Johnson and Pelinka within weeks of each other in the spring of 2017. In his interview Monday on \u201cFirst Take,\u201d Johnson said he and Pelinka worked well initially as they sought to clear the Lakers\u2019 salary cap situation through a series of trades to collect future assets. However, Johnson said he soon started hearing talk questioning his work ethic. \u201cThings got going in the right direction. And then I start hearing, \u2018Magic, you\u2019re not working hard enough. Magic\u2019s not in the office.\u2019 So people around the Lakers office was telling me Rob was saying things. And I didn\u2019t like those things being said behind my back,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThat I wasn\u2019t in the office enough and on and on. So I started getting calls from my friends outside of basketball and those things were said to them outside of basketball. Now it\u2019s in the media and so on.\u201d \u201cIf you\u2019re going to talk betrayal, it\u2019s only with Rob,\u201d Johnson said later in the interview. \"If you're going to talk betrayal, it's only with Rob [Pelinka].\" \u2014 @magicjohnson on the Lakers pic.twitter.com\/K0sSLK2rhB \u2014 First Take (@FirstTake) May 20, 2019 On Monday afternoon, the Lakers officially announced the hiring of new coach Frank Vogel at a news conference. Pelinka addressed Johnson\u2019s comments, saying he spoke to Johnson two days ago about the NBA Draft combine and the Lakers\u2019 No. 4 pick in the 2019 Draft. \u201cThese things are surprising to hear and disheartening. \u2026 They\u2019re just simply not true,\u201d Pelinka said. \u201cI stand beside him. I stand with him as a colleague and a partner. I\u2019ve always supported everything he\u2019s done and will continue to.\u201d Lakers GM Rob Pelinka responds to recent comments made by Magic Johnson. pic.twitter.com\/m6Aa9HeQiM \u2014 NBA TV (@NBATV) May 20, 2019 Pelinka said he plans to talk to Johnson eventually and said his claims today are \u201csimply not true.\u201d Additionally, Pelinka said that Lakers owner Jeanie Buss has eliminated the position of president of basketball operations. Pelinka will now run the basketball operations as general manager and when it comes to basketball decisions, those are made in collaboration with the staff. A recommendation is then made to Buss who then \u201cblesses that or not.\u201d Johnson said he was also upset by two other events during his tenure: not being able to fire former coach Luke Walton when he wanted and Tim Harris, the Lakers\u2019 president of basketball operations\/NBA alternate governor, becoming too involved in basketball-related decisions. \u201cThe straw that broke the camel\u2019s back was I wanted to fire Luke Walton,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWe had three meetings [and] I showed [Lakers owner Jeanie Buss] the things he did well and the things he didn\u2019t do well. I said, \u2018listen, we gotta get a better coach. I like him, he\u2019s great, former Laker the whole thing.\u2019 The first day, \u2018well, let\u2019s think about it.\u2019 The second day, \u2018OK, you can fire him.\u2019 Then, the next day, \u2018we should try to work it out.\u2019 We went back and forth like that, then she brought Tim Harris into the meeting. \u2026 Tim wanted to keep him because he was friends with Luke. When I looked up and said \u2018wait a minute, I only really answer to Jeanie Buss. Now, I got Tim involved.\u2019 I said, \u2018it\u2019s time for me to go.\u2019 I\u2019ve got things happening that were being said behind my back. I don\u2019t have the power that I thought I had to make decisions. \u201cI told them, when it\u2019s not fun for me, when I think that I don\u2019t have the decision-making power that I thought I had, then I\u2019ve got to step aside.\u201d Johnson added that he tried to also help Joey Buss (the team\u2019s co-owner and the team president of the South Bay Lakers) and Jesse Buss (co-owner\/director of scouting and assistant GM) find ways to move up in the Lakers\u2019 front office hierarchy. However, he also said there are too many people providing input on decisions for the Lakers, which is hampering Jeanie Buss. \u201cI didn\u2019t like that Tim Harris was too involved in basketball. He\u2019s supposed to run the Lakers business, but he was trying to come over to our side,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cJeanie\u2019s gotta stop that. You\u2019ve got to stop people from having those voices. It\u2019s too many people at the table. What happens is everybody gets to share their opinion and it\u2019s so much information coming at her, then when I say \u2018hey, we have to do this,\u2019 she can\u2019t make a decision because they said \u2018no, don\u2019t go the way Magic go. You should go left instead of going right.\u2019 Her love for those people and respect for those people often caused us to not make the right choice or there\u2019s no decision. I said, \u2018listen, you can\u2019t run a corporation like this.\u2019 \u201cYou can\u2019t have everybody think that they can have a voice or an opinion about the final decision. That was supposed to be me as the president, having that final say.\u201d When asked about who else backstabbed him, Johnson would only name Pelinka. \u201cJust Rob,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cOther people didn\u2019t bother me\u2026 what happened was I wasn\u2019t having fun coming to work anymore, especially when I got to work beside you, knowing that you want my position.\u201d Last summer, Johnson was a key figure in the Lakers\u2019 recruitment of LeBron James and remains a proud supporter of former No. 2 overall pick Lonzo Ball. Yet Johnson and the Lakers\u2019 front office faced scrutiny for their other moves, including the role players they signed around James, their inability to acquire Anthony Davis at the trade deadline, and the emergence of former Laker D\u2019Angelo Russell after being dealt to Brooklyn in 2017. Regarding the trade attempt for Davis, Johnson said the former New Orleans Pelicans GM leaked particulars of trades to the media while the sides were negotiating. \u201cI told Dell Demps, let\u2019s do it in private,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWhat we offer, let\u2019s keep it between us. Well, Dell didn\u2019t do that. So that\u2019s how it got out.\u201d Johnson, who will turn 60 in August, also has many thriving business interests along with ownership stakes in the Los Angeles Dodgers and Los Angeles FC. He remains confident that James will succeed in leading the Lakers to a championship after the team missed the playoffs this season. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna happen. Just like me going back to my business and doing what I\u2019m doing, LeBron\u2019s gonna win that \u2018chip,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cHe\u2019s gonna be in that room recruiting. It\u2019s gotta be Jeanie, LeBron and Rob and probably [new coach] Frank [Vogel], that\u2019s it.\u201d \"It's gonna happen \u2026 LeBron gon' win that chip.\" \u2013 @MagicJohnson says @KingJames will win a title with the Lakers. pic.twitter.com\/qFlxesuyBF \u2014 First Take (@FirstTake) May 20, 2019 Johnson was hired along with Pelinka when Buss dismissed her brother, Jim, and GM Mitch Kupchak just 27 months ago.

Connelly had interviewed for the Washington Wizards\u2019 president of basketball operations vacancy, but has reportedly decided to stay with the Nuggets, per ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski and NBCSportsWashington.com\u2019s Chris Miller . Connelly played a significant role in Denver\u2019s post-Carmelo Anthony rebuild, which included the drafting of Nikola Jokic and Jamal Murray as well as signing Paul Millsap in free agency. Per Wojnarowski, Nuggets team president Josh Kroenke made an aggressive case to keep Connelly once the Wizards extended him an offer over the weekend. With Connelly out of the mix in D.C., the Wizards are expected to turn back to their other finalists for the job \u2014 the Oklahoma City Thunder\u2019s Troy Weaver, former Atlanta Hawks and Cleveland Cavaliers GM Danny Ferry and Wizards interim GM Tommy Sheppard. For the past four seasons, Connelly has been his role and oversaw Denver\u2019s steady rise in the Western Conference. The Nuggets went 30-52 in 2014, but rose to 54 wins this season and reached Game 7 of the Western Conference semifinals . Denver has dramatically improved on defense over the past two seasons, going from 27th in points allowed (111.2) in the 2015-16 season to sixth (106.7) in 2018-19. A Baltimore native, Connelly broke into the NBA as an intern with the Wizards in 1996 and rose to video coordinator, scout and personnel director before becoming the assistant GM in New Orleans in 2010. His wife is from Washington, D.C., and the couple\u2019s extended family resides in the region, writes Wojnarowski. Last week, Wizards hiring consultant Mike Forde has reportedly already talked with Connelly about the opening, The Washington Post reports. However, luring him to the Wizards was thought to be a costly exercise. According to The Washington Post , a person close to Connelly speculates he would not leave the Nuggets for a deal lower than $4 million annually for five years.

As he enters the final year of his contract, D\u2019Antoni isn\u2019t looking to step back from coaching anytime soon. Per ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski, D\u2019Antoni and the Rockets\u2019 front office have had preliminary talks about a contract extension that would keep D\u2019Antoni from entering the final year of his deal. D\u2019Antoni said he told both Houston\u2019s owner Tillman Fertitta and its general manager Daryl Morey that he intends to keep coaching the team for at least three more seasons, per Wojnarowski. \u201cI\u2019ve let Daryl and Tilman know that I\u2019m energized to keep coaching \u2014 and believe that I can continue to do this at a high level for at least another three years,\u201d the 68-year-old D\u2019Antoni told ESPN on Sunday night. \u201cI want to be a part of a championship here.\u201d D\u2019Antoni told ESPN that he prefers entering the final year of his four-year contract this season without an extension. However, Wojnarowski reports it is unclear significant of a commitment Houston is willing to make to D\u2019Antoni. The Rockets reportedly parted ways with assistant coach Jeff Bzdelik over the weekend and Wojnarowski reports more changes could be made to D\u2019Antoni\u2019s staff. In an interview with the Houston Chronicle last week, Fertitta backed D\u2019Antoni and said he planned to meet with the Rockets\u2019 coach in the coming weeks to discuss his future with the team. \u201cMike will be the coach next year,\u201d Fertitta told the newspaper . \u201cHe\u2019s not a lame duck to me. That\u2019s just a media term. That\u2019s just a media buzzword. \u201cMike is going to be 69 years old (next May) and Mike doesn\u2019t know totally what he wants to do, yet. We\u2019ll sit down with Mike in the next few weeks and talk with him. We\u2019re more concerned with making our team better next year. Mike will be here. I like Mike. I think he\u2019s a very good coach. Players like playing for him. I keep being told, free agents want to know who the owner is and they want to know who the coach is. Mike and I do well together. Hopefully, we\u2019ll continue to win and Mike will be here for a long time.\u201d Since 2016-17, which was D\u2019Antoni\u2019s first season as coach, the Rockets have won no fewer than 53 games and set a franchise record for wins in a season in 2017-18 when they finished 65-17. Houston lost in the Western Conference semifinals to rival Golden State , marking the second straight postseason in which the Rockets were eliminated by the Warriors in the playoffs.

But what makes Leonard truly special is how good he can be on both ends of the floor \u2026 in the playoffs \u2026 having played more than 50 minutes \u2026 while hobbled by a leg injury \u2026 and with his team\u2019s season on the line. The Toronto Raptors are still alive in the Eastern Conference finals , having escaped with a 118-112, double-overtime victory in Game 3 on Sunday. They\u2019re still alive because Marc Gasol finally made the shots the Milwaukee Bucks have been daring him to shoot all along, because Pascal Siakam had his best game of the series, and because Fred VanVleet and Danny Green hit timely buckets on a night in which they shot a combined 2-for-20. But mostly, the Raptors have a chance to even this series in Game 4 because Leonard was the better of the two superstars on the floor. And he was just that, in part, because he was defending the other one. Through the first two games of the series, Pascal Siakam has been the primary defender on Giannis Antetokounmpo, with Leonard defending Khris Middleton. Antetokounmpo hadn\u2019t exactly gone wild in the first two games (totaling 54 points and 11 assists), but the Raptors needed to change something. That came on first possession of Game 3 with Leonard guarding Antetokounmp, Siakam shifting over to Eric Bledsoe and Kyle Lowry on Middleton. Things didn\u2019t stay that way all game long. The Raptors switched often and couldn\u2019t worry about matchups when defending the Bucks in transition. No matter who the initial defender is, guarding Antetokounmpo is always a five-man job, with the other four needing to be ready to help on Antetokounmpo\u2019s relentless attacks to the basket. \u201cOne man can\u2019t guard him,\u201d Leonard acknowledged. \u201cIt takes the whole team.\u201d But in regard to 1-on-1 defense, Leonard is the best that the Raptors have. The adjustment worked as the Bucks scored just seven points on their first 13 possessions of Game 3 and only three of their 26 first-quarter shots came in the restricted area . \u201cWe wanted to take a look at it early to see how it looked,\u201d Nurse said of the Antetokounmpo-Leonard matchup. \u201cIt looked pretty good, so we stuck with it.\u201d Leonard played Antetokounmpo tighter than the Kia MVP favorite had been defended in the first two games. \u201cHe was up and not giving him quite as much runway to get flying off of,\u201d Nurse said. \u201cBut so were the other guys that ended up on him in a switch or in different parts of the game. They were all a little bit more locked in. We took steps forward to get physical. The other night we were backing away from everything.\u201d The Bucks punished the Raptors with a few transition 3-pointers and eventually got to the basket. But their 112 points on 120 possessions was their second-worst offensive output of the postseason. Antetokounmpo, who entered Game 3 averaging a postseason-best 15.1 points in the paint per game , finished with just 10 points in the paint on Sunday. It wasn\u2019t his lowest total of the postseason , but it was a low mark considering the season-high 45 minutes that he played before fouling out on the Raptors\u2019 first possession of the second overtime. The 8.1 points in the paint per 36 minutes were Antetokounmpo\u2019s third-lowest output in his 84 games this season. Leonard, meanwhile, scored a game-high 36 points despite suffering an apparent left leg injury less than three minutes in, either on the take-off or the landing of a fast-break bucket after one of Milwaukee\u2019s 20 turnovers. He looked hobbled for the rest of the night, but a hobbled Kawhi Leonard is still the best that the Raptors have. \u201cObviously, he wasn\u2019t moving very fast,\u201d VanVleet said. \u201cBut if he\u2019s out there, he\u2019s good enough.\u201d And he was, seemingly, all the Raptors had offensively late in the game. When they couldn\u2019t get him the ball in the post against Malcolm Brogdon, he had to go out to the perimeter to get it. Most of the iso-ball stuff didn\u2019t work, but all the work the Raptors\u2019 did defensively eventually allowed them to break through in the second overtime. With the Raptors up one and a little more than three minutes to go, Bledsoe got a switch onto Gasol and attacked. Danny Green came from the weak side to help, leaving Brogdon wide-open in the corner. That\u2019s where Bledsoe was looking to go with it, but Green got his hand on the pass, Leonard picked up the loose ball, and raced down the floor for a lefty dunk over Nikola Mirotic. Three possessions later, Toronto\u2019s lead was back to one point when Middleton got a switch onto VanVleet. Leonard came over to double and deflected the pass. Brogdon was the first to get to the loose ball, but Leonard snatched it away from him and took it the other way for another dunk . \u201cHis defense was probably the biggest key of the game,\u201d Nurse said of Leonard. \u201cOffense was hard to come by there for both teams for a while, and any time you can get a steal and a breakout, it\u2019s a huge momentum play.\u201d In 568 career games prior to Sunday, Leonard had never played more than 46 minutes. He played 52 minutes and eight seconds in Game 3, and the Raptors needed every last bit of it. They\u2019ll need more in Game 4 on Tuesday, and they\u2019ll have to hope that Leonard can recover in the next 48 hours. \u201cFifty-two minutes and it\u2019s in the playoffs,\u201d Leonard said, \u201cso you definitely feel it. When you play 30 minutes, you feel it still. You just got to not worry about it, get my treatment and move on to the next one.\u201d There was always going to be a next one. But Leonard and the Raptors have made sure that Game 4 won\u2019t be the last one. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

His routine \u2014 assuming it wasn\u2019t The Finals, where he got summoned to the podium, win or lose \u2014 typically went like this: the door to the Cleveland or Miami dressing room would swing open and there James would be, ready to face the questions, antsy to move on ASAP. Once he \u2018fessed up to the shots he\u2019d missed or the plays he\u2019d botched, that was it. Oh, you knew he\u2019d be looking plenty at video of that game in the hours before he played again, as a way to find and fix the flaws. But for public consumption at least, he shed it fast, like an ill-fitting suit. Antetokounmpo, the Milwaukee Bucks\u2019 young star, is still learning this face-of-the-franchise and cutthroat competitor stuff. He took his time afterward in the spartan visitors\u2019 locker room at Scotiabank Arena. There he sat, with his knees wrapped and his feet plunged into an ice bath. The Kia MVP candidate stared at the score sheet that had been handed to him, the one bearing all sorts of dreary news from the double-overtime setback that cut Milwaukee\u2019s lead in the best-of-seven series to 2-1. Antetokounmpo barely looked up as the semicircle of cameras, microphones and reporters around him grew with media people tip-toeing that fine line between giving him some space and blocking out for position whenever he\u2019d finally take their questions. He barely looked up when Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer strode through the dressing room and tapped him on his left knee, a little atta-boy bonding near the end of a long, disappointing night. While teammates poked habitually at their phones in the aftermath of Milwaukee\u2019s 118-112 loss , Antetokounmpo mostly let his lie there on the seat next to him. By the standards he set this year as an MVP favorite, he knew he\u2019d had a lousy night. The reporters standing there, like fans everywhere, knew he\u2019d struggled in ways rarely seen since his first taste of the postseason four years ago. And he knew that they knew, so\u2026 \u201cObviously it wasn\u2019t my best game,\u201d Antetokounmpo said eventually. \u201cI\u2019ve got to be more aggressive\u2026 I\u2019ve got to make the right play.\u201d Defensively, Antetokounmpo was pretty much his usual self, grabbing 23 rebounds, challenging Toronto\u2019s players out on the floor and had four blocked shots. Offensively, his 12 points were his fewest in a playoff game since he was first dipping his toe into postseason waters as a 20-year-old back in 2015. Through three quarters, Antetokounmpo had only six points on 3-for-8 shooting. Seven Milwaukee players and five Raptors had outscored him to that point, and he hadn\u2019t earned his way to the foul line even once. What made it all worse was that the game was sitting there, aching to be taken by anyone. Antetokounmpo got himself going a bit in the fourth quarter, making a couple of shots and earning five free throws. But he missed three and went scoreless while playing the entire first overtime. He fouled out just 36 seconds into the second OT, but didn\u2019t object to it. Antetokounmpo just took it and exited, sealing it as one of those \u201cnot your night, kid\u201d hard lessons. Asked about the frustration that Antetokounmpo might have shown to teammates, if not the public, Bucks guard Eric Bledsoe said: \u201cIf you don\u2019t feel bad when you play bad, you don\u2019t need to be playing this game. That\u2019s the feeling that drives you to success. I\u2019m happy he\u2019s feeling like that.\u201d Antetokounmpo\u2019s game didn\u2019t just spin sideways on its own. Raptors coach Nick Nurse switched some defensive duties around and assigned Kawhi Leonard \u2014 a two-time Kia Defensive Player of the Year with the wingspan, instincts and reflexes to confound any open-court player \u2014 as the tip of Toronto\u2019s spear against \u201cThe Greek Freak.\u201d As expected, Toronto sent second defenders at him , the surest way to get the ball out of Antetokounmpo\u2019s hands or force him into difficult shots. So he tried to make the right basketball plays, as they say, and sometimes he did \u2014 he dished a team-high seven assists. Sometimes, though, he did not, turning over the ball eight times. For the record, Antetokounmpo has played 31 postseason games in his young career. In the games in which he has scored fewer than 19 points, his team\u2019s record is 3-6. When he scores 19 or more, the Bucks are 14-8. Not to lay it all at Antetokounmpo\u2019s feet. Fellow All-Star Khris Middleton was way off his usual offensive form, missing 13 of his 16 shots. And Bledsoe matched that. Together, those three starters were a combined 11-of-48. The rest of the team shot 50 percent (27 of 54). \u201cWe have the utmost respect and belief that the next game is not going to be as bad as [this] was,\u201d said guard George Hill, who scored 24 points off the bench. \u201cBut I know it\u2019s sitting in their head that they go for a combined 11-of-48 or something like that. We\u2019re not worried about it.\u201d Right. Who\u2019s even counting? Budenholzer and his staff are going to have to figure out ways to get scoring opportunities without being stymied by all the defensive traffic. Teammates are going to have to shoot better, to keep those diggers honest in their matchups. And Antetokounmpo is going to need to play more aggressively and take what happened in Game 3 very personally. He wasn\u2019t quite there yet, Sunday night. \u201cObviously I want to stay aggressive. But we stick to our game plan,\u201d Antetokounmpo said. \u201cSome days I\u2019m going to have a bad night. But my team has to focus on doing their job and I\u2019ll do mine.\u201d Said Brook Lopez, after watching the throng swallow Antetokounmpo on the opposite side of the room: \u201cWe know he\u2019s not going to quit or stop playing. He\u2019s going to continue to be him.\u201d As he talked, Lopez\u2019s phone began vibrating next to him. He said it was Bucks GM Jon Horst calling and, in a bit of gallows humor after a stinging loss, joked that maybe he shouldn\u2019t answer. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I should pick up or not,\u201d the Milwaukee center said, \u201c\u2019cause I want to be here tomorrow.\u201d Antetokounmpo has a call to answer now, too.

Taken as a bundle, the Trail Blazers guard presents an impressive case for himself as a player worthy of your respect, something he craves and certainly deserves to a large degree. Lillard had his Playoff Moment when he sank the buzzer-and-series-winning shot from nearly half-court to erase Oklahoma City and his nemesis, Russell Westbrook, from the first round . It was the kind of play that separates the truly great players from the very good. It was as if the casual basketball fan discovered Lillard overnight, or rather, the next morning on social media and TV highlight replays, since that game ended well past bedtime for much of the country. But as Kenny Smith, the former player and popular commentator on TNT once said: \u201cThe regular season is when you make your fame. The playoffs is when you make your name.\u201d And so, with that in mind: Since Lillard has since been unable to duplicate those heroics of three weeks ago and is struggling mightily here in his first taste of the Western Conference finals , what do we call him in this, his seventh season? Great? Or very good? Right now he gives the appearance of a marathon runner who wheezes toward the finish line only to see someone cruelly push it forward another mile. His ribcage might not be totally intact (to what extent only he knows ) after Warriors forward Kevon Looney fell on Lillard while they chased a loose ball in Game 2. The Warriors are causing additional problems for Lillard by trapping him constantly with elite defenders Draymond Green and Andre Iguodala, making him work for shots and space. \u201cI\u2019m seeing Draymond Green, and he\u2019s behind that kind of like tracking my movements,\u201d Lillard explained. \u201cSo it\u2019s like a next layer of defense that I\u2019m paying attention to\u2026 I\u2019m not, I guess, wanting to explode and get around that guy because I see what\u2019s waiting for me, and then just the crowd, and I put myself in a tough position.\u201d Clearly, he\u2019s not right physically. The Warriors are singling him out defensively, and the Blazers are one loss from elimination partly, if not mainly, because Lillard\u2019s impact has been minimized. His pain goes beyond his ribs and frustration. To know Lillard is to know his pride is certainly aching as well. This is his chance to get his due, to shine deep into May for once, and do that against the two-time defending champions, and yet it\u2019s all going wrong for him. Even if healthy, Lillard lacks a high level of championship savvy talent around him, and elimination from the conference finals was probably destined to happen regardless of Golden State riding without Kevin Durant. The Warriors are that good and the Blazers are that raw. But with Lillard shooting 33 percent in the series, they might get swept, and that\u2019s too bitter of a pill for any player with Lillard\u2019s credentials. He\u2019s one of the most complete shooters in the game, someone who mixes 3-pointers, mid-range jumpers and rim attacks to rank annually among the top scorers in the NBA. He\u2019s also smart with the dribble and deadly in isolation. This season was one of his best, when he averaged nearly 26 points and helped the Blazers to a No. 3 seed. This will surely place Lillard on one of the All-NBA teams, perhaps even First Team, which is difficult to do in a league rich with standout combo guards. Even more admirable is Lillard doing this on a team largely of role players, with the exception of CJ McCollum. Even including the other half of their backcourt, the Blazers have only one player with All-Star honors: Lillard. He\u2019s the rare player under 6-foot-4 who carries a team. On that note, Lillard always bristled when he felt he wasn\u2019t getting his proper respect, be it All-Star mentions or MVP discussions. And most of the time, he had a point. Lillard suffers from two issues: his regular season games tip at 10:30 ET and, until now, he never took the Blazers beyond the second round. His playoff record is 19-31. Last spring was especially agonizing: Lillard was outplayed by Jrue Holiday and the Blazers were swept by the Pelicans in the first round. He made redemption a goal and this year\u2019s first round was a smashing success made sweeter by the series-winning shot. And yet, did the grueling seven-game second round against Denver drain the energy from Lillard? Including the last game of that series, he\u2019s shooting just above 30 percent in his last four games. Against the Warriors, he has one more basket than turnovers (15 to 14). The rib injury certainly hasn\u2019t helped (although Lillard downplayed it). \u201cIt\u2019s there, but it\u2019s not something that\u2019s affecting anything that I\u2019m doing,\u201d he insisted. \u201cObviously you feel it, but that\u2019s it.\u201d Although he\u2019s averaging more career points against the Warriors than any other team, those were mainly regular-season numbers. It\u2019s an entirely different level in the postseason and particularly this deep into it. The Warriors are forcing the ball from his hands, daring other Blazers to take shots, and when Lillard does keep the ball, his looks aren\u2019t always clean. \u201cIt\u2019s tough,\u201d he admitted. \u201cThey\u2019re doing a good job in their coverages.\u201d So what\u2019s left of the Blazers? Unless there\u2019s a premium performance coming from Lillard and McCollum in Game 4, their season is likely done after Monday night. With Green and Stephen Curry looking nostalgic, the Warriors have that 2015 feeling when they won a title without Durant. The Warriors also know they\u2019ll get nine days\u2019 rest with a sweep, as if they need any further motivation. At this point, all the Blazers have is their pride, with none bigger than Lillard\u2019s. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

Under Bickerstaff last season, Memphis recorded the third-best scoring defense in the NBA, holding opponents to 106.1 points per game. The Grizzlies also held an NBA-high 10 opponents under 90 points last season and went undefeated in those games. Memphis limited 17 opponents to under 40 percent shooting last season, which was tied with Utah for the second-most in the NBA. Prior to his stint with Memphis, Bickerstaff spent five seasons (2011-16) with the Houston Rockets, where he was elevated to interim head coach early in the 2015-16 season and guided the Rockets to a 37-34 finish to close the season with a postseason berth. Bickerstaff\u2019s additional experience as an assistant coach includes four seasons (2007-11) with the Minnesota Timberwolves and three seasons (2004-07) with the Charlotte Bobcats under his father and current Cavaliers Senior Basketball Advisor, Bernie Bickerstaff. The youngest assistant coach in the NBA at age 25 when he began with the Bobcats in 2004-05, Bickerstaff followed in the footsteps of his father, who was the youngest assistant coach when he joined the NBA at 29 years old in 1973. Prior to his time on the NBA sidelines, Bickerstaff served as director of operations for the University of Minnesota\u2019s men\u2019s basketball program, overseeing all administrative areas of the program and assisting the coaching staff with recruiting, scouting and coaching.

The weeklong event in Chicago features scrimmages, drills and body measurements. These measurements \u2014 which include height, wingspan, body fat percentage and more \u2014 provide an interesting way to view the upcoming Draft class and compare it to years past. Draft prospect Tacko Fall is the headliner this year. The 23-year-old center from UCF posted the highest marks ever for wingspan (8 feet, 2.25 inches), standing reach (10 feet, 2.5 inches) and height with shoes (7 feet, 7 inches). Prior to Fall, the previous mark for longest wingspan was held by Orlando Magic center Mo Bamba, who was measured at 7-foot-10 in 2018 and was selected No. 6 overall in the 2018 Draft . Fall is among 11 players who were picked from the NBA G League Elite Camp held earlier this week for a spot in the Draft Combine. Aside from Fall, Florida State\u2019s Terance Mann, Miami\u2019s Dewan Hernandez, Syracuse\u2019s Oshae Brissett, Nevada\u2019s Cody Martin, Tulsa\u2019s DaQuan Jeffries, Auburn\u2019s Jared Harper, Iowa\u2019s Tyler Cook, Iowa State\u2019s Marial Shayok, Mississippi State\u2019s Reggie Perry and Ole Miss\u2019 Terence Davis were invited Wednesday to transition from the Elite Camp to the Draft Combine.

Trajan is a tremendous talent and shares in our vision of what it means to be a part of the Pelican family, on and off the floor. We are excited to add he and his family to our leadership group as we continue building upon that vision.\u201d \u201cWe are very pleased to welcome Trajan and his family to the New Orleans Pelicans,\u201d said Pelicans Owner Gayle Benson. \u201cOur priority is to build the best basketball team both on and off the court. This is another positive step that puts our organization in position to be successful.\u201d Langdon joins the Pelicans after serving as assistant general manager for the Brooklyn Nets since March 8, 2016. Langdon, who also served as general manager of the Brooklyn Nets\u2019 NBA G League affiliate \u2013 the Long Island Nets \u2013 the last three seasons, was recently named the 2018-19 NBA G League Basketball Executive of the Year after Long Island tied for the NBA G League\u2019s best record (34-16), earning the franchise\u2019s first postseason berth as the No. 1 playoff seed in the Eastern Conference, and advanced to the 2019 NBA G League Finals. Prior to being named assistant general manager for the Nets, he spent one year as director of player administration and basketball operations for the Cleveland Cavaliers, where he worked under Griffin on basketball operations and front office matters. Langdon began his front office career with the San Antonio Spurs, serving as a pro scout from 2012-15, and was a member of the team\u2019s front office during their 2013-14 championship season. A first round pick (11th overall) of the Cavaliers in 1999, Langdon played three seasons with Cleveland, where he totaled 119 games, and became the first Alaskan to play in the NBA. Following his stint in the NBA, Langdon played nine seasons overseas in Russia, Turkey and Italy. His best years came with CSKA Moscow, where he was a two-time Euroleague champion (2006, 2008), Euroleague Final Four MVP (2008), two-time All-Euroleague First Team selection (2007, 2008) and All-Euroleague Second Team selection (2006). He was also named to the Euroleague 2001-10 All-Decade Team. A native of Anchorage, Alaska, Langdon played collegiately at Duke where he left as the school\u2019s all-time leader in three-point field goals made and was a First-Team All-ACC selection (1997-99) and consensus Second-Team All-American (1999). After graduating from Duke with degrees in mathematics and history, he played on the USA Basketball National Team in the 1998 FIBA World Championship, winning the bronze medal."},{"id":33683,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/draymond-green-elevates-warriors-unique-talent","date":"2019-05-19","title":"'He makes us go': Green elevates Warriors to 3-0 series lead","content":" PORTLAND, Ore. \u2014 There is nothing Draymond Green failed to do Saturday when he helped push the Blazers to the edge and the Warriors to the verge. Here is the checklist of his duties: Dribbler, pace-setter, rescuer, shooter, director, shot blocker, shot-caller and the one that probably escaped most witnesses, psychiatrist. Yes, Dr. Dray suddenly offered his services and sofa when poor Jordan Bell blew a breakaway dunk during a critical moment, just as the Warriors were in the process of flipping an 18-point deficit during their 110-99 victory in Game 3 of the Western Conference Finals . Bell immediately hung his head as he returned downcourt, and seconds later at the next timeout, he slowly headed toward the Warriors bench with slumped shoulders. But who intercepted him before he could take another step? That\u2019s right, it was Green, famously known for his cool and soothing words in times of crisis. (OK, put the laugh track here.) But seriously \u2026 \u201cI knew he wasn\u2019t going to lecture me or anything like that,\u201d said Bell. \u201cHe just told me that everybody misses dunks, that I shouldn\u2019t worry about it, that mine happened to be an open one, and to keep my head into the game because I\u2019d get another chance.\u201d Bell paused. \u201cI was down here,\u201d he said, lowering his hand, \u201cand he lifted me up here.\u201d And wouldn\u2019t you know, Bell got that next chance minutes later. This time, the dunk was thrown down ferociously and completed with a chin-up that belonged at LA Fitness. We can give Green credit for the 20-point, 13-rebound, career playoff-high 12-assist triple double, and we can give Green partial credit for that second-chance slam, too. The man was that multi-layered. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what to say about Draymond,\u201d said Warriors coach Steve Kerr. Once again, Green demonstrated his value to the Warriors in these playoffs with a magnificent all-around game. He left fingerprints all over the Moda Center court and various Blazers\u2019 efforts. He was there for the Warriors when nothing else worked, and he was there for the Warriors when everything finally began to click and they needed a finishing touch. His desire and will do not show up directly on the stat sheet, yet those elements made the victory possible. The Warriors won for the fourth straight game without Kevin Durant and are one more away from reaching the NBA Finals for the fifth straight year. It makes you wonder: As great as Durant is, would the Warriors be more vulnerable if it was Green who were out with a calf strain instead? That question stands valid because the Warriors lack anyone who does what he does. The energy, intensity, floor direction, ability to defend three and sometimes four different positions, as well as the rebounding were all apparent Saturday and in heavy doses. They came alongside leadership, evidenced by Green giving Bell a pat on the back during that down moment. Green played Game 3 as a blur, grabbing rebounds, pushing the ball up the floor, creating scoring chances for himself or his teammates and providing help defense that triggered the pace. Green was forceful because Steph Curry and Klay Thompson were 9-for-24 shooting in the first half, at times overwhelmed by the trapping Blazers defense. So Green took it upon himself to make things happen and provide the foundation for a second-half comeback. The Golden State defense held Portland to 13 points in the third quarter, Curry had 11 points in the fourth quarter, and this series simply continued along the same path. \u201cHe was the difference-maker,\u201d said Blazers coach Terry Stotts. \u201cHis energy, the way he was pushing the ball, he kept them going. He makes his teammates better and defensively he\u2019s all over the place. He impacted the game.\u201d In the third quarter, Green poked the ball loose from Damian Lillard for one of his four steals. At the time, the Warriors were down 12 and in dire need of a jolt. But here\u2019s what was remarkable about the play. Not only did the 6-foot-7 Green stoop and strip one of the NBA\u2019s most composed ballhandling point guards (although perhaps not in this series), but he also managed to search for and grab it while it bounced between him and Lillard, then dribbled downcourt without missing a beat. The dexterity, quickness, daring and smarts sets Green apart from others who play his role, or at least try to emulate it. \u201cMore than reacting, he acts,\u201d said Warriors assistant coach Ron Adams, who oversees the team\u2019s defensive schemes. \u201cThere\u2019s reacting and then there\u2019s acting. He\u2019s an actor. He sees things. He\u2019s decisive.\u201d Green is averaging 18 points, 12 rebounds and almost 10 assists across the last two games and those numbers barely tell the real story. It\u2019s just heightened because of Durant\u2019s absence. In those two games, the Warriors trailed Portland by 17 and 18 points and Green was the point man on the rally. He says his main purposes is to give Thompson and Curry a breather from the load and responsibility. With the Blazers throwing traps at those two guards to limit their scoring, Green is forcing Portland to pay him respect. He is, in essence, breaking down Portland\u2019s defense by pushing the ball and directing the attack. \u201cI know I have to be more aggressive,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s easy to get (Curry and Thompson) to take more shots, but we can\u2019t put that much pressure on them, so I just take it upon myself to get the tempo where I want it and make plays for other guys as well.\u201d It was no coincidence that six Warriors off the bench managed to get at least one basket with Green directing traffic. And Green managed to play such a high-energy game without making constant mistakes; he had only two turnovers in 38 minutes. \u201cHe\u2019s playing with force and he\u2019s playing with discipline,\u201d said Kerr. \u201cHe\u2019s playing under control. He\u2019s not letting anything bother him, like officiating, bad shots, he\u2019s just moving on to the next play. From that standpoint, he\u2019s as good as he\u2019s ever been.\u201d This is the Draymond Green that makes the Warriors more than willing to put up with the occasional nonsense, mostly stemming from his short temper and low tolerance with the officiating yet also with teammates and coaches at times. The constant technical fouls, the early-season clash with Durant, the high maintenance that often comes with coaching him, those are all part of the package. Taken as whole, that package is more positive than negative. And when there\u2019s no negative, as it\u2019s been through much of this postseason, the package is irresistible. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing new; I\u2019ve seen him do this for seven years,\u201d said Thompson. \u201cI\u2019m just so proud of Dray. He makes us go.\u201d There was no more positive reinforcement from Green than when he comforted Bell and told the young player to shake off a missed dunk seen by millions and laughed at by thousands inside Moda Center. Green gave Bell the encouragement needed to forget the embarrassment and maintain composure, which was important because Kerr kept Bell in the game. That set Bell up to gain redemption. And the Warriors, after struggling through a sloppy start, to gain complete control of a series that could end Monday in a sweep. \u201cI\u2019m one of the leaders of this team and in those situations you either go one of two ways. You\u2019re either going to do your job and lift everybody up or you\u2019re going to go the opposite way,\u201d said Green. And so Green, with passing, defense and pace-setting, is stamping his signature on this series. His floor direction is flawless. He hasn\u2019t shown the ability to direct the Blazers right out of the playoffs, but that\u2019s perhaps just a matter of time. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

And through two games of the the Eastern Conference finals , the Milwaukee Bucks clearly are winning the battle of pace. With each team averaging 102 possessions per game, they\u2019ve stretched a Raptors roster that averaged between 95 and 96 possessions per game in each of the first two rounds. The first two games of the conference finals have been the two fastest-paced games of Toronto\u2019s postseason. They\u2019re now 5-0 when they\u2019ve had 94 or fewer possessions, and 3-6 when they\u2019ve had 95 or more. On the defensive end of the floor, they\u2019ve allowed just 96.3 points per 100 possessions in the five slower-paced games and 105.6 in the nine others. The context in those numbers, of course, is that three of the five slow-paced games were against the Orlando Magic\u2019s 22nd-ranked offense, while seven of the other nine have been against two top-10 offenses in Philadelphia and Milwaukee. The Bucks rank second offensively in the playoffs , having scored the same number of points per 100 possessions (113.5) as they did in the regular season, when they ranked just ahead of the Raptors in offensive efficiency. Toronto was actually the most efficient regular-season team in transition, averaging 1.19 points on those possessions, according to Synergy play-type tracking. Kawhi Leonard and Pascal Siakam scored 1.31 and 1.26 points per possession in transition, respectively. Those were the fourth- and seventh-best marks among 101 players who averaged at least two transition possessions per game in the regular season. In this series, the Raptors don\u2019t want to play slow and deliberate. Against the league\u2019s No. 1 defense, they have to seek out scoring opportunities, and walking the ball up the floor in order to minimize possessions would waste precious seconds off the shot clock. Not to mention allow the Bucks to set up their defense, and put additional pressure on every action and every pass in the half-court. Kyle Lowry has looked to push the ball up the floor against Milwaukee, off of both misses and makes. But the Bucks have simply been more prolific and efficient in transition. According to Second Spectrum tracking, the Raptors have outscored the Bucks by 10 points on field goals in the last 18 seconds of the shot clock, but Milwaukee has outscored Toronto, 49-26, on field goals in the first six seconds of the shot clock. The Raptors\u2019 issues have been with both the volume and accuracy of their shots early in the clock. In Game 1, they took 20 shots in the first six seconds, but shot just 5-for-20, in part because 12 of the 20 shots came from 3-point range. They got early offense, but not early offense at the rim. In Game 2, the Raptors took just eight of their 87 shots in the first six seconds of the shot clock, while the Bucks attempted twice as many. The two ends of the floor are linked, of course. A defensive stop is more likely to lead to a transition opportunity, and a successful offensive possession is more likely to allow a team to get set defensively. And pace isn\u2019t just about shots early in the clock. It\u2019s also about the quickness with which actions are run in a half-court offense. \u201cA lot of people kinda tend to think [playing with pace] means playing super fast, up the floor and shooting quickly,\u201d Nick Nurse said during the Philadelphia series. \u201cWe talked about our pace in the halfcourt. I think the games where the shots were better and going in \u2026 our pace in the halfcourt was crisper. It was more speed of cuts, which translated to a little better rhythm, which translated to a little better shots.\u201d Both of these teams are defending similarly, putting an emphasis on protecting the basket, which means that paint attacks are met with multiple defenders. The result is ball movement and defensive rotations. And in regard to ball and player movement, the Milwaukee offense has played with more pace. Through the first two games, the Bucks have averaged 348 passes and 11.6 miles traveled per 24 minutes of possession. Toronto, meanwhile, has averaged 322 and 11.1. Sure, the Raptors have scored more points from the field in the last 18 seconds of the shot clock, but they haven\u2019t been nearly sharp enough to make up for the differential in transition. The Raptors don\u2019t want to turn the conference finals into a track meet. But if they\u2019re going to come back in this series, it seems they\u2019ll have to play with more pace offensively, while preventing the Bucks from doing the same. It\u2019s a tough needle to thread. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

No, not the conference finals. At this point, they\u2019re obviously the heavy favorite to win the East. Prior to this year, 72 teams had a 2-0 lead in the conference finals, and 67 of them went on to win. But why aren\u2019t the Bucks the favorites to win the NBA championship? Is there a case to be made against 1) what was the best team in the regular season and 2) what has been an even better team in the playoffs? Maybe this is a we\u2019ll-believe-it-when-we-see-it league. How can you pick a team to win a championship when its best player had never won a playoff series prior to this year? Until they lost in five, it was easier to imagine the Celtics, with their talent and with their recent history of playoff success (back-to-back trips to the conference finals), being the team to represent the East in The Finals in the first year A.L. (after LeBron). And then the Bucks outscored the Celtics by a total of 65 points over the last four games of the conference semis . It\u2019s similarly difficult to pick against the Golden State Warriors until they actually lose. The two-time defending champs have Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green. Presumably, they\u2019ll have Kevin Durant back for The Finals should they finish off the Portland Trail Blazers in the Western Conference finals . And even without Durant, the Warriors boast the same 2-0 conference finals lead the Bucks currently possess. But the Warriors haven\u2019t been as sharp as they were in each of the previous two postseasons. Five of their 10 playoff wins have been within five points in the last five minutes . Last year, only four of their 16 wins were within five in the last five. In 2017, it was four of 16 as well. With the postseason\u2019s 10th-ranked defense , Golden State has outscored its opponents by 6.4 points per 100 possessions over its 14 games. The Bucks have outscored their opponents by more than double that: 15.1 per 100 . That feels like the mark of an eventual champion. Through 10 playoff wins last year, the Warriors had outscored their opponents by 9.6 points per 100 possessions . Through 10 playoff wins in 2015, they had outscored their opponents by just 7.7 points per 100 . It was only in 2017, when they won their first 15 playoff games in Durant\u2019s first season in Golden State, that the Warriors were as dominant as the Bucks have been thus far. At 10-0 two years ago, Golden State had outscored its playoff opponents by 16.5 points per 100 possessions . At that point, the Warriors had the No. 2 offense and the No. 1 defense in the postseason. That\u2019s exactly where the Bucks stand after Game 2 on Friday. Milwaukee is a complete team in more ways than one. The defense has been there almost every night. The Bucks have held their opponents under a point per possession (the measure of elite defense) in six of their 11 games and only once (their Game 1 loss to Boston) have they allowed them to score more than what was the league average (109.7 points scored per 100 possessions) in the regular season. Even with the rise in 3-point shooting over the last few years, the most important shots on the floor remain those at the basket, and no team has been better at both preventing and defending those shots than the Bucks. After allowing a league-low 29.6 points per game in the restricted area in the regular season , the Bucks have allowed just 22.0 per game in the playoffs . In this series, Raptors drives have been met with a swarm of Milwaukee defenders, making it difficult to either score in the paint or get off a clean pass to an open shooter. After shooting 57 percent in the paint through the first two rounds (in which they faced two very good defenses), the Raptors have shot just 49 percent ( 36-for-73 ) in the paint through the first two games of the conference finals. On Toronto\u2019s first possession of Game 2, Marc Gasol posted up Khris Middleton after a switch and spun around Middleton for a layup, only to be rejected by Giannis Antetokounmpo. The Raptors went scoreless on their first five possessions, had just 39 points on 49 possessions at halftime, and were too far behind for a 39-point third quarter to matter much. \u201cI think the way we played on both ends of the court in the first half,\u201d Budenholzer said afterward, \u201cis what we\u2019re trying to get to.\u201d After a bit of an offensive struggle in Game 1, the Bucks broke out on Friday. The elite defense led to 28 fast-break points, a size advantage inside led to 17 second-chance points, and six of their nine rotation players scored in double-figures. Three of those six came off the bench. While Toronto coach Nick Nurse has had to both shorten and alter his rotation in these playoffs, Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer has seemingly found contributors wherever he has turned. George Hill and Pat Connaughton were huge in the Boston series, Malcolm Brogdon didn\u2019t need long to find his rhythm after missing the first eight postseason games, and on Friday, Ersan Ilyasova had what Budenholzer called \u201cclearly his best game of the year,\u201d scoring 17 points, drawing three charges, and registering a plus-22 in just over 21 minutes off the bench. The Bucks have the presumed Kia MVP , but their biggest strength in these playoffs has been their depth. Through 11 games, they\u2019ve outscored their opponents by 12.0 points per 100 possessions with Antetokounmpo off the floor. Unlike his fellow Eastern Conference coaches, Budenholzer has never had to rush his best player back onto the floor. And this team is now 10-1 with Antetokounmpo ranking 40th in postseason minutes per game at 32.3 . While the Raptors\u2019 offense has struggled to take advantage of the attention paid to Kawhi Leonard, every Bucks rotation player has played with confidence and freedom. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to let me play one-on-one,\u201d Antetokounmpo said after registering 30 points, 17 rebounds and five assists in Game 2. \u201cSo this series is not going to be about me; it\u2019s going to be about my teammates being ready to shoot, being ready to make the right play.\u201d \u201cWe try and empower them,\u201d Budenholzer said of his team\u2019s role players. \u201cWe try to play a way where they all feel like they can contribute and do things. Hopefully that\u2019s paying off for us.\u201d There\u2019s no argument to the contrary. But is there an argument against this team being the favorite to win the championship? While it remains difficult to pick against the team that won last year and remains intact, new champions come along all the time, and it\u2019s easier to see them in hindsight than in the moment. Of course, as good as they\u2019ve been playing and as special as this run has felt, Bucks players refuse to get ahead of themselves. \u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d Eric Bledsoe said. \u201cThat\u2019s how you lose focus. The biggest thing with this group is just taking a game at a time, and not looking forward to The Finals. Anything can happen. So we\u2019re focused on Game 3.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a great opportunity that we have,\u201d George Hill added, \u201cbut it means nothing until we get there.\u201d The players have to keep their minds on Toronto.

Two more and \u2013 unless things change radically for the Raptors in every phase of the game from what we\u2019ve seen \u2013 the basketball metaphor of their 2019 postseason is going to fall harmlessly to the side. No points, no buzzer-beater, no victory, no nothing. Two games into this best-of-seven series, it\u2019s already hard to see a way out for the Raptors that doesn\u2019t include Hefty bags, cleaned-out lockers and a wide-open month of June. Toronto played well enough to win in Game 1 , yet managed to lose it anyway thanks to an open elevator shaft of a fourth quarter that qualified instantly as something that would haunt them. Then they played miserably in Friday\u2019s Game 2 , save for a stretch in the third quarter when slippage in Milwaukee\u2019s focus appeared as culpable as anything Raptors-related. Kyle Lowry, Toronto\u2019s veteran point guard, is wandering around these days with a modified blue oven mitt on his left hand. It\u2019s there to protect the thumb he sprained in Game 7 against Philadelphia. That\u2019s the game that got the Raptors here, the one decided by Kawhi Leonard\u2019s eternal-highlight shot at the end that bounced four times on the rim before dropping through the net. It\u2019s been kind of downhill for their crew since then. Anyway, Lowry was asked a series of questions after Milwaukee\u2019s 125-103 triumph at Fiserv Forum about the defense, about the rebounding, about the shift from the Bucks\u2019 floor to the Raptors\u2019 for Games 3 and 4 beginning Sunday. And Lowry earnestly answered by saying, yes, they have to defend better, they have to rebound better and they definitely have to assert themselves more to defend their Scotiabank Arena home court. Lowry said the right things. Problem is, that\u2019s a lot of things. The Raptors don\u2019t appear to have the wherewithal \u2013 or even the duct tape, if you prefer \u2013 to fix so many flaws at once. They have been outrebounded 113-86, a major factor in the Bucks\u2019 41-20 advantage in second-chance points. They have been outscored by 30 points in the two games and most of the difference has come from the bench (76-51), adding to the sense that Milwaukee isn\u2019t just beating Toronto, it\u2019s ganging up on them. Defensively, the Raptors haven\u2019t been nearly good enough and their coach, Nick Nurse, put the blame squarely on them. He went into detail \u2013 both before and after Game 2 \u2013 to explain the difference between a good contest of a jump shot and a great, playoffs-worthy contest. After talking at length before tipoff about needing and hoping to see effort from his players as a sign they grasped the urgency involved, it had to be embarrassing for Nurse to acknowledge afterward that, no, that effort in fact was not there. \u201cWe were just a step too slow on just about everything,\u201d he observed. To illustrate how casually his players closed on Bucks\u2019 shooters, Nurse did a deep dive on a play in which center Marc Gasol needed to get out to Nikola Mirotic. \u201cIt was a good contest, but it wasn\u2019t a full-out contest,\u201d the Toronto coach said. \u201cWe know the level of contest is going to affect these shots or not, and if you don\u2019t go with everything you\u2019ve got and jump high and really try to let them know you\u2019re right pressed up against them, then the chances of [the shots] going in are pretty good.\u201d Poor Gasol. This supremely skilled big man who was so valuable to the Memphis Grizzlies in numerous playoff wars is an early nominee for series scapegoat here. He at least had 12 rebounds and five assists in the opener, but his contributions and minutes fizzled in Game 2. By the time he got to 1-for-9 (3-for-20 in the series), the 34-year-old Gasol was looking creakier than his brother Pau, 38, who was wheeling himself through the halls on a scooter Friday night after undergoing foot surgery this week. Then there\u2019s Danny Green, a helpful 3-and-D guy with tons of postseason experience from his San Antonio days. Green\u2019s challenge has been touching the ball enough to make a difference; he\u2019s 3-for-11, getting about two thirds as many shots as he\u2019d expect. But as he noted, Toronto\u2019s ball movement has been spotty, the Bucks\u2019 top-ranked defense stingy and little has been done to alter either from one game to the next. \u201cOur offense was out of whack a little bit tonight, and we didn\u2019t tighten it up,\u201d Green said. A little more Norman Powell, a little less Gasol going forward? Doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019ll be enough. Now take Pascal Siakam and Lowry from the margin for error that Toronto really doesn\u2019t have. They were good for 45 points in the opener but scored a total of 23 Friday, each burdened with foul trouble from daring to mess with Milwaukee\u2019s gears. Siakam, a favorite to be named the NBA\u2019s Most Improved Player, wound up as the night\u2019s most removed player, his minutes dropping from more than 42 on Wednesday to 26 on Friday. There\u2019s no reason to let Leonard off the hook, either. The Raptors\u2019 best player has scored 31 points in each game, but they\u2019ve been about as quiet as 62 points can be, coming almost from a bubble that has nothing in common with the rest of Toronto\u2019s attack. Sometimes Leonard is bailing them out, sure, but many times the ball and the possession stop with him. The Bucks are OK with that, defending him with Khris Middleton, Eric Bledsoe and helpers. Leonard has taken 20 of his team\u2019s 45 free throws, but dished only four assists in the two games. That\u2019s one area in which Leonard is so different from \u2013 and so far in this series, lacking when compared to \u2013 Giannis Antetokounmpo. The Bucks\u2019 star, with his gravitational pull on defenders, creates a bounty of opportunities for others. Leonard isn\u2019t making any of his teammates better at this stage. And let\u2019s not forget the intangibles. Antetokounmpo is the catalyst for Milwaukee\u2019s superior team chemistry, a top-five talent who is all in on the Bucks\u2019 ambitions and the players corralled around him. Leonard? For all anyone knows, he still has one foot out the door to free agency. His laconic nature doesn\u2019t lend itself to firing up others, and it\u2019s difficult to see how he leads by anything other than example. The cloud of Leonard\u2019s future has been squatting over Toronto\u2019s whole season. Every game is a referendum on whether he feels he has enough help or not. Does Nurse or another Raptors coach dare to challenge him, for fear he\u2019ll start packing his bags immediately? Did anyone object to his \u201cload management\u201d nights off this season? It has been a tough way to grind through a long year, held hostage by your star\u2019s inscrutability. But it\u2019s what they signed up for when GM Masai Ujiri traded for him with just one season to woo and recruit. Compare that to what Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer was sharing about Antetokounmpo, as far as pushing him to greater heights. \u201cWe\u2019re coaching him and we\u2019re on him,\u201d Budenholzer said. \u201cWe think he can be doing more, and he just soaks it up.\u201d As the series shifts to Canada, the Raptors will look to Friday\u2019s third quarter as quickly as the Bucks will dismiss it. Toronto outscored Milwaukee 39-31 over those 12 minutes, the only portion of the game in which they managed to send a ripple of nervousness through the building. OK, well, maybe not quite that, but a few fans surely noticed that what had been a 28-point lead soon after halftime got chiseled down to 13. Not once, but twice. But Malcolm Brogdon and George Hill went to work off the Bucks\u2019 bench, Giannis came back mean-muggin\u2019 to start the fourth and that most definitely was that. Playoff protocol says we must give the Raptors their home games to demonstrate a difference. But they need to know that 0-2 is a gaping hole, from which only 20 teams in NBA history have come back in a seven-game series. Two more bounces on the rim, and we\u2019ll see which way the Raptors fall. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

It didn\u2019t come packed in luggage or a box; instead, it\u2019s just wrapped in a hunch and tied with a question mark, and it is this: When do the Warriors start missing Kevin Durant? The back-to-back champs are now 3-0 in these playoffs without their superstar and his aching calf . And 4-0 overall in games in which Durant didn\u2019t finish. That probably says something about the Rockets, and so far about the Trail Blazers \u2014 two teams unable to exploit his absence. However, while the (bleeping) Giants \u2014 Steve Kerr\u2019s description of his undermanned team \u2014 are honorably playing with a sense of urgency, they aren\u2019t buying the notion that they don\u2019t need Durant. It\u2019s an easy trap to fall into, to believe the outside chatter that they\u2019re better off without him. The next two games, both at Moda Center, will either feed that belief or destroy it. Yes, because the Blazers must beat the Warriors four out of five to advance, there\u2019s little to no chance of them denying Golden State a fifth trip to the Finals regardless of whether Durant shows up in this series or not. And that\u2019s good for the visitors, since Durant didn\u2019t make the trip for Games 3 and 4. \u201cThere\u2019s no mental adjustment,\u201d said Kerr. \u201cYou just play. You go out there with what you have, and this is our third game, 3 1\/2 games, really without him, and so we\u2019re just trying to hold down the fort. Hopefully he continues to progress and he has made progress, but it\u2019s a little more serious than we thought at the very beginning. So we\u2019ll see where it all goes, but he\u2019s in there all day long getting treatment. He\u2019s done a great job of committing himself to that process.\u201d There\u2019s a thought that, even if Durant was 80 percent, the Warriors will keep him benched to prevent a chance of re-injury, and that\u2019s a wise decision with wide-ranging ramifications. By protecting Durant\u2019s best interest here in this free agent year, the Warriors score big points with him and his camp less than two months before Durant must make a decision on his future. That said, what are the Warriors doing right to remain unharmed by his absence? The easy answer is they won championships without Durant and so this is more of the same-old, same-old. Except it isn\u2019t. This actually might be more impressive. Understand that Golden State\u2019s system had to be changed here on the fly and in the middle of the postseason, not only to compensate for Durant\u2019s 37 points per game in these playoffs , but also his defense. Once Durant was lost late in the third quarter of the fifth game of the second round, Kerr had to reach down his bench and rely on players who weren\u2019t thrust into roles of significance and seldom saw fourth-quarter minutes up until this point. Meaning, Jonas Jerebko, Quinn Cook, Kevon Looney, Jordan Bell and Alfonzo McKinnie have either seen their minutes rise and\/or their roles inflated in the process. Of course, most of the burden fell on the proven core: Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green and Andre Iguodala. Each of those four, in his own way, is playing at a premium, even if it\u2019s a small sample size. \u201cThat\u2019s what it takes in the playoffs,\u201d said Kerr. \u201cYou have to have guys playing at a really high level.\u201d Curry seems reborn or at least sprung free of a playoff fog where his numbers and production didn\u2019t match his regular season. He finished strong in a pair of fourth quarters while closing out the Rockets and is the most impactful player in this series so far. He\u2019s averaging 35 points on 51 percent shooting in the three games without KD. It wouldn\u2019t be a stretch to suspect Curry is getting a charge out of this, and his ego, which he keeps hidden, is being fed. Thompson is now clearly the second option, whereas before he was often No. 3 and often only if his shot was falling. The green light never turns yellow without Durant around, like Curry, Thompson is working without handcuffs or a leash. After hitting 20 shot attempts once in the playoffs before Durant\u2019s injury, Thompson is now hoisting 22 a game, good for a respectable 25-point average. The Warriors are constantly feeding him and running screens for him and urging him to take the shot, even if it\u2019s contested. For a player who insists he\u2019ll re-sign with Golden State this summer, Thompson is getting a taste of what life must be like if he played for, let\u2019s say, the Clippers and was the focal point of the offense. \u201cThis team\u2019s been together a long time and they trust each other,\u201d said Kerr. \u201cWhen the ball starts moving, that\u2019s when we\u2019re tough to guard.\u201d Green has never been better this season than in the last few weeks. Recharged after losing weight immediately following the All-Star break and no longer feeling pain in his previously-injured shoulder, Green is menacing on the defensive end where once again he\u2019s guarding all positions except point guard and doing it marvelously. In addition, he\u2019s pushing the ball up court to help Curry and Thompson stay as fresh as possible and directing the offense from the high post. He\u2019s averaging 10 rebounds, 6.5 assists and three blocks without KD. \u201cYou know, we can\u2019t sit and look over our shoulder and say, `Hey, man, when is K going to be back?\u2019 We just got to play with whatever we got,\u201d Green said. \u201cWe got to play and give him an opportunity to get back, and I think that\u2019s what really falls on our shoulders. We\u2019re a very confident group. Hopefully he\u2019s back sooner than later, but as a guy who is in the battle every night, we can\u2019t sit and look over our shoulder and wonder when he or DeMarcus [Cousins] is coming back. We have to assume they are not coming back and play with what we got. Obviously, we are hoping that they do. But while they are not out there, we just got to play.\u201d Finally, there\u2019s Iguodala. He stayed hibernated all regular season while averaging career lows across the board. At age 35, it appeared time had finally caught up. Instead, this was a case of a crafty veteran preserving himself for springtime, and with the amount of talent on the Warriors, he could afford to do so. Iguodala had solid moments guarding James Harden in the second round and is among those trapping Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum this round. One of the signature plays of the series was Iguodala coming up with a walk-off strip of Lillard as time expired in Game 2. \u201cYou\u2019re kind of in awe of it because not many guys can make plays like that consistently,\u201d said Curry. So this is where the Warriors are without Durant and also DeMarcus Cousins. They were good enough to stump the Rockets (again), then proved too much for the Blazers in a pair of home games. Nobody would be shocked if they take a game in Portland or maybe finish the sweep. It\u2019s a luxury that few teams have or could pull off even if they did. This comes from a core that\u2019s been together for six years, a coach pulling the proper strings and a bench that isn\u2019t shrinking in the moment. \u201cWe feel like we can still win no matter who is out there on the floor, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re in the position that we\u2019re in and have won championships with all the injuries and all types of stuff,\u201d said Curry. \u201cWe know what the mission is, and we\u2019re on it right now.\u201d These Warriors are playing flashback basketball to the time before Durant came aboard \u2014 and prepping themselves for next season, when and if Durant jumps overboard this summer. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

Four San Antonio Spurs legends have created their own version of that viral NBA photo. In the summer of 2015, LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, Dwyane Wade and Chris Paul were dubbed the \u201cBanana Boat\u201d crew after a photo surfaced of James, Paul, Wade and Wade\u2019s wife, Gabrielle Union on an inflatable, yellow boat together .

At the time, that photo had NBA fans wondering how all three superstars could be a part of one team someday. Thanks to former fan favorite Boris Diaw, the Spurs have a version of sorts of that image. Diaw posted an image on social media today that showed himself, former Spurs center Tiago Splitter, current Spurs guard Patty Mills and Spurs legend Manu Ginobili all being pulled along together on an inflatable raft. In his post, Diaw wrote: \u201cI don\u2019t know if you notice but the hot dog wiener boat is sinking in the back, not in the front\u2026.. #wienerboatboys #happydivers\u201d Last September, the low-key Diaw officially announced his NBA retirement in a fitting way: on a boat.

The trio all played in the NBA (Parker currently plays for the Charlotte Hornets) and were past teammates on the French national team. The Brooklyn Nets hired Splitter last year as a scout. Last season, the Spurs honored Ginobili \u2014 one of the most popular and successful players in team history \u2014 by retiring his No. 20 jersey .

Since that defeat ended their season, Houston fans may be wondering what\u2019s next for the team. In an interview with Jonathan Feigen of the Houston Chronicle , team owner Tillman Fertitta laid out a fairly concise plan about all of that. First, he made it clear that he is behind coach Mike D\u2019Antoni, who is entering the final season of his contract this season. While Fertitta did not speak about a possible extension for D\u2019Antoni, he does plan to meet with D\u2019Antoni in the coming weeks. \u201cMike will be the coach next year,\u201d Fertitta told the Houston Chronicle . \u201cHe\u2019s not a lame duck to me. That\u2019s just a media term. That\u2019s just a media buzzword. \u201cMike is going to be 69 years old (next May) and Mike doesn\u2019t know totally what he wants to do, yet. We\u2019ll sit down with Mike in the next few weeks and talk with him. We\u2019re more concerned with making our team better next year. Mike will be here. I like Mike. I think he\u2019s a very good coach. Players like playing for him. I keep being told, free agents want to know who the owner is and they want to know who the coach is. Mike and I do well together. Hopefully, we\u2019ll continue to win and Mike will be here for a long time.\u201d After Houston\u2019s Game 6 loss, Fertitta remained confident that former Kia MVP winner James Harden was the player to lead the Rockets to their first NBA title since 1995. \u201cI can promise you, we\u2019re going to win some championships with James Harden,\u201d Fertitta said. \u201cBecause we are not going to sit here, we will go to battle every year, we\u2019re going to have a strong offseason, and we\u2019re going to do whatever we can do to be a better team. We are not going to sit on our hands, I can promise you that.\u201d As for the specifics of next season\u2019s roster, the Rockets\u2019 owner did not elaborate much on that topic. However, he also made it clear that a \u201crun it back\u201d approach to things in 2019-20 is not on the docket. \u201cWe\u2019re here to win,\u201d Fertitta told the Houston Chronicle . \u201cWe\u2019re not here to be just OK and make it to the playoffs. We\u2019re going to do whatever it takes to be a championship-style team every year. I will make moves to always extend our runway. I\u2019m not a rebuilding guy to go collapse for three years to get Draft picks. I want to keep us at as high a level as we can. I have a good management team. We\u2019re in the City of Houston, which is soon to be the third-largest city in the United States so we should always attract our good share of free agents. \u201cRight now, the Houston Rockets as a brand are one of the top brands out there and we\u2019re going to keep it that way.\u201d Upgrading the Rockets\u2019 roster may prove to be a challenge this summer. Houston has seven free agents on its roster (veteran Nene has a player option), including unrestricted free agents Austin Rivers, Iman Shumpert, Gerald Green and Kenneth Faried. All of those players had a vital role in Houston\u2019s success last season, but the Rockets have never been averse to roster change. Additionally, star guards Harden and Chris Paul are in the midst of deals that will pay them $38.5 million and $37.8 million, respectively, next season. Center Clint Capela is in the second season of a five-year, $90 million deal he signed last summer while veteran guard Eric Gordon is making $14 million in the final year of his deal next season. Fertitta told the newspaper he would like to work out an extension with Gordon if at all possible. The shooting guard is eligible for a four-year extension worth a maximum of $75.6 million. Fertitta also praised Harden\u2019s work ethic and Paul\u2019s intangibles and leadership, all while making it clear he wants a team that will be \u201ctough\u201d next season. \u201cI never want to be soft. I don\u2019t like soft ownership and I don\u2019t like soft teams,\u201d Fertitta told the Houston Chronicle . \u201cThat\u2019s not my culture. I do want my players scrambling for a loose ball. I\u2019ll set a hard pick in business. I\u2019ll scramble on the floor for a ball in business. I expect them to do it on the court. I\u2019m not saying they don\u2019t. I have a very hard-playing team. But we\u2019re never going to be soft. \u201cI know we have a team good enough to win 55 games, but that\u2019s not good enough.

To Lillard, the Warriors played good defense at a clutch moment to secure a 2-0 lead in the series, but the Blazers\u2019 star said there was contact on that play, too. The Blazers led 111-110 with 1 minute, 3 seconds to play after Seth Curry nailed a 29-foot 3-pointer . From there, the Warriors regained the lead on a Kevon Looney alley-oop with 52 seconds left and extended the lead to 114-111 with 12 seconds left off a Draymond Green layup. That set up the final shot for the Blazers as the team put the ball in Lillard\u2019s hands. He isolated on Iguodala on the left wing to set up a 3-pointer, but Iguodala swiped the ball away with his right hand as Lillard went into his shooting motion. Iguodala snatched the ball and passed ahead to Stephen Curry, who dribbled once and launched a shot from beyond half court that missed as Golden State prevailed, 114-111. Per Dwight James of NBC Sports Northwest , Lillard maintained that he was fouled on the final play. But, Lillard also made it clear he knew that he would not be bailed out by a call at that point in the game, too. \u201cYou know, I got the ball,\u201d Lillard said. \u201cI think they knew we needed a three. I think it was under 10 seconds by the time I got a catch, and a quick two \u2014 we didn\u2019t have any timeouts left. I don\u2019t think that would have done much for us. \u201cWe knew we were going to go for the three, so I was just trying to get space to get a three up. I know it\u2019s a tough position for the referees to be in to make a call at that point of the game. I tried to get a little bit of space the first time and he grabbed my arm and I lost the ball a little bit. I regained it and I was going to shoot it again. \u201cBut he got his hand on the ball. For me, as the offensive player, I felt like it was contact. There was a lot of contact. But obviously, the ref is not going to decide the game or jump in at that point. You know, so they \u2013 good defensive play.\u201d Iguodala said he was taking a calculated risk with the game on the line. \u201cWell, you look at the time and situation, up three, so the one thing that you don\u2019t want to do is give up a three,\u201d Iguodala said, per NBC Sports Northwest. \u201cYou actually can take risks outside the three-point line and be extra aggressive. The key is not to give that up. If the guy drives by you, then you still have the lead. When you look at it that way, it wasn\u2019t that good of a play. \u201cI just take odds on what you want to do and if the odds are in your favor, then for something like that to happen outside the three-point line.\u201d CJ McCollum scored 22 points for Portland and Damian Lillard overcame a slow start to add 23 points and 10 assists as the Blazers looked far more in sync than in a 116-94 defeat two days earlier. Game 3 in the best-of-seven series is Saturday night at Portland. \u201cWe did play a much better game at both ends of the floor tonight. We\u2019ve got to take that into Game 3,\u201d Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. \u201cIt is a lost opportunity, no question. We had a chance to get one here on the road.\u201d The Blazers had built a 65-50 halftime lead, capitalizing on 10 Warriors turnovers for 18 points. But Portland was brutal down the stretch, missing eight of their final nine shots over the final four-plus minutes of Game 2 . Green, in particular, was troublesome for Portland late in Game 2. He had three critical assists in those final four minutes en route to finishing with 16 points, 10 rebounds, seven assists and five blocks despite being in foul trouble. \u201cWe\u2019ve been here before,\u201d Green said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re on a run like we\u2019re currently in, you\u2019ve seen everything. Down eight points with what, four minutes to go, or whatever it was, just got to keep going, because we know we can erase eight points.\u201d Portland showed it made adjustments from Game 1 and brought it on both ends from the opening tip after the Blazers had regularly left Stephen Curry wide open on the perimeter off the pick-and-roll and he scored 36 points while matching his postseason high with nine 3-pointers. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to bring that same energy at home,\u201d McCollum said, \u201cunderstand that this is the first time in 19 years we\u2019ve been in the conference final.\u201d Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":33682,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/wizards-permission-connelly-president-operations","date":"2019-05-17","title":"Reports: Wizards granted permission to interview Nuggets' Connelly","content":" The Washington Wizards\u2019 search for a new president of basketball operations has reportedly lighted upon one of the architects of the Denver Nuggets\u2019 successful resurgence. According to ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski , the Wizards have obtained permission to interview Nuggets president Tim Connelly. The news was also reported by Candace Buckner of  The Washington Post . Per The Washington Post , Connelly has long been a top target for the job by the Wizards, who have conducted second interviews for the opening with current interim Tommy Sheppard, Danny Ferry and Troy Weaver. Gersson Rosas, now the Minnesota Timberwolves\u2019 president of basketball operations, interviewed for the job in late April. A Baltimore native, Connelly played a significant role in Denver\u2019s post-Carmelo Anthony rebuild, which included the drafting of Nikola Jokic and Jamal Murray as well as signing Paul Millsap in free agency. Connelly broke into the NBA as an intern with the Wizards in 1996 and rose to video coordinator, scout and personnel director before becoming the assistant GM in New Orleans in 2010. His wife is from Washington, D.C., and the couple\u2019s extended family resides in the region, writes Wojnarowski. Wizards hiring consultant Mike Forde has reportedly already talked with Connelly about the opening, The Washington Post reports, but luring him to the Wizards may prove costly. According to The Washington Post , a person close to Connelly speculates he would not leave the Nuggets for a deal lower than $4 million annually for five years.  The Wizards, who have not advanced to the conference finals since 1979, are hoping a high-quality front office can overcome the franchise\u2019s recent string of misfortune. Former All-Star point guard John Wall, whose super-max contract begins this fall, underwent Achilles surgery in February that will keep him out nearly all of 2019-20. Washington also fell from sixth to ninth in this week\u2019s NBA Draft Lottery . Bradley Beal was the Wizards\u2019 bright spot in a season that saw them go 32-50, their worst mark since 2012-13.

The team confirmed in a release that while Durant has shown \u201cgood progress\u201d he isn\u2019t yet \u201cready to advance to on-court work.\u201d They did note that DeMarcus Cousins (torn left quad; suffered April 15) had made that step, though he remains out of live action. Additionally, Warriors President of Basketball Operations and General Manager Bob Myers told NBC Sports Bay Area that Durant would not travel to Portland for the next two games. Durant has missed Golden State\u2019s last three playoff games \u2014 Game 6 of the Western Conference semifinals and Games 1 and 2 of the Western Conference finals \u2014 because of a right calf strain. The Warriors injury report confirms earlier reporting by Yahoo Sports\u2019 Chris Haynes and Connor Letourneau of the San Francisco Chronicle . \u201cThere\u2019s no mental adjustment, you just play. You go out there with what you have,\u201d Warriors coach Steve Kerr said Thursday. \u201cThis is our third game, 3 + games really, without him. We\u2019re just trying to hold down the fort. Hopefully he continues to progress. And he has made progress but it\u2019s a little more serious than we thought at the very beginning, so we\u2019ll see how it all goes. He\u2019s in there all day long getting treatment. Hopefully he\u2019ll be back at some point.\u201d Durant\u2019s 34.2 points per game lead all postseason scorers, but since his absence, guard Stephen Curry has taken on a greater scoring load. \u201cHe\u2019s handled it great. He\u2019s vocal. Still being a leader. Staying in all of our ears. Vocal during film,\u201d said Quinn Cook, a reserve Warriors guard and close friend of Durant. \u201cI know he\u2019s been putting in extra work. I know he\u2019s excited to get back. We can\u2019t wait to have him back.\u201d Andrew Bogut has started in Durant\u2019s place the past three games. \u201cWith him on the court, there\u2019s just another great offensive player, and so when you put him out there with Steph and Klay (Thompson), it\u2019s really challenging from a defensive standpoint. And his versatility in his offense,\u201d Blazers coach Terry Stotts said Thursday. \u201cWhen you take him out of it, I think they do play a different style. Certainly Curry gets more involved, I think Klay gets more involved, because they need to. And so the focus or emphasis on those two guys probably becomes a little bit more.\u201d On Monday, Kerr said people should \u201cslow down\u201d when estimating Durant\u2019s return . \u201cHe hasn\u2019t even stepped on the floor yet,\u201d Kerr said on Monday. \u201cWe\u2019ve tried to remain somewhat vague because the injury is really sort of open-ended in terms of how long he\u2019s going to need to recover. But I think in doing so, people have gotten the idea that he\u2019s going to come back \u2026 be Willis Reed or something. \u201cHe still has pain. So there\u2019s time ahead of him on the rehab process,\u201d Kerr continued. \u201cWe\u2019ll have a more detailed update on Thursday.\u201d Overall, Durant is averaging 34.2 points on 51.3 percent shooting (41.6 percent on 3-pointers), 5.2 rebounds and 4.9 assists per game. An MRI exam last Thursday confirmed the Warriors\u2019 initial diagnosis of Durant\u2019s strained right calf.

Every player, save for two, suddenly disappeared as 19,595 witnesses were reduced by 19,593, with the remaining pair watching and pointing from the kitchen window. Yes, late-1990s nostalgia intervened in a tight contest between the Golden State Warriors and Portland Trail Blazers. It was Curry vs. Curry all over again, an entertaining spectacle for their amused parents yet a tense one for their sons, Stephen and Seth, fiercely trying to take down the other. Even if you weren\u2019t there at the Curry household for those brotherhood battles back in the day, couldn\u2019t you just envision how they developed, much as it did on a dramatic Thursday, two decades later on the other side of the country? There was so much riding on those 1-on-1s then, such as a noogie for the loser, the last remaining cookie for the winner, and most certainly bragging rights, at least for the day. This time, the stakes were tame by comparison: just an ordinary game in mid-May that could dictate which brother eventually goes to The Finals and which one sits next to Dell and Sonya in the stands and watches. Nothing more or less. \u201cYeah, sure,\u201d laughed Seth. \u201cSomething like that.\u201d OK, perhaps this was huge after all. This was Stephen with 37 points and eight assists rallying the Warriors back from 17 points down in a 114-111 win , only to get push-back from his brother, who played the best game of his NBA career. This was Seth, younger by three years, getting 16 points and four steals in the game \u2014 all four out of Steph\u2019s pocket \u2014 to give the Blazers an unexpected lift. The performance earned enough confidence from coach Terry Stotts that he played the entire fourth quarter. Seth was assigned to check Steph, and vice-versa, and it was a family issue played out before the basketball world. It was a thrilling one at that, because at one point you weren\u2019t sure which Curry would get the best of the other. \u201cThis was like the coolest experience I think I\u2019ve ever had playing against him,\u201d Stephen Curry said. \u201cEvery minute he was out there defensively, he was a pest. Made big shots in the fourth quarter. He was amazing tonight.\u201d Seth made all three of his shots in the fourth quarter , all of them 3-pointers, and a few in Steph\u2019s mug. If he wasn\u2019t the Blazers\u2019 best option, at least he was an option, one that the Warriors \u2014 and the other Curry \u2014 had to respect. He helped the Blazers cling to an eight-point lead with four minutes left \u2026 until the expected happened and those early bragging rights were rudely snatched back. Playing once again without the comfort of Kevin Durant , Steph shot and willed his team to victory and a 2-0 series lead, drawing a foul beyond the arc and draining three free throws to put the Warriors up two. Seth had one last answer, a 29-footer that temporarily regained the lead before the Warriors wore down Portland and won on Andre Iguodala\u2019s last-second strip of Damian Lillard . In all, it was a must-see contest \u2026 and the game wasn\u2019t too bad, either. \u201cI mean, they\u2019re brothers,\u201d Lillard said. \u201cFor me, having my own older brother, I know what it\u2019s like to go against your brother and what it means. They both know there\u2019s going to be conversations about this at some point when this series is over and they\u2019re going to play like it.\u201d Perhaps somewhat surprisingly, there wasn\u2019t much chatter between them; Seth said they were too involved in the game for that. Well, maybe just a touch: \u201cHe tried to distract me at the free-throw line in the fourth quarter and I knew I had to go back at him to stay focused on what I needed to do,\u201d Stephen Curry said. There was more of an urgency on Seth\u2019s part to make this game and this drama happen. After his brother and Klay Thompson took turns dropping an avalanche of jumpers on the Blazers in Game 1, Portland needed a new strategy to defend the pick and roll. So they decided to trap constantly, and they needed agile players to do so. That meant less time for Enes Kanter and more time for others, including Seth. Of course, there was another reason to play Seth for 29 minutes: Who else knows Stephen Curry better than him? \u201cI\u2019ve seen every Warriors game and every Steph game for the past 10 years,\u201d Seth Curry said. \u201cI feel like I know some things he likes to do, but it wasn\u2019t enough.\u201d That\u2019s true. You can have all the scouting reports and, in this case, all the backyard hoop experience in the world. There\u2019s only so much one can do against a two-time Kia MVP and widely-regarded as the best shooter ever. Still, there were those four steals by Seth, two of them clean picks off Steph, whose crafty dribble makes him difficult to strip. Essentially, Seth was a problem Thursday \u2014 and an irritating one. \u201cI felt like he was thinking where I was at times,\u201d Seth Curry said. I was just trying to make it tough on him. He\u2019s going to do what he does, but if you make him work a little more, make it tough on him, that\u2019s all you can ask.\u201d Seth\u2019s had the harder road to this point. While Steph became a basketball icon, Seth kept bouncing between teams over five seasons. It took years for him to secure his big contract , all while fighting to carve a spot in the rotation (and finally getting the chance to do just that). A few years ago, Seth played for the Warriors\u2019 G League team in Santa Cruz in the shadow of his brother, wondering when he\u2019d get his chance to make his own path. \u201cI don\u2019t take this for granted,\u201d he said. \u201cTo get to this point and be a contributor, this is what I worked for all those years. I was confident I could be here, and now that I\u2019m here, I will try to make the most of it. I always want the ball and try to be aggressive and tonight when I found the ball in my hands, I was locked in.\u201d This will give Stotts and the Blazers something to ponder as the series moves to Portland, where they\u2019ll try to keep from becoming another piece of Warriors playoff roadkill. The chances are good, then, that Seth\u2019s spot in rotation is safe. \u201cEvery time we played them this season, Seth has played great and I think it has something to do with playing his brother,\u201d Lillard said. \u201cThis time I thought he guarded Steph well, and Steph is always on the move, out there running around, coming off screens and just looking to shoot the ball. That\u2019s what he does.\u201d There was one little detail that Lillard left out, one that Stephen Curry was too happy to provide: \u201cIt worked out perfectly tonight: He played well and we won.\u201d * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

Bang-bang , one immediately after the other. So there wasn\u2019t time for the Milwaukee Bucks\u2019 combo guard to fret that his late regular-season foot injury might morph from disappointing to something far more devastating. Plantar fascia tears, like the one Brogdon suffered in his right foot on March 15 in Miami, can be tricky. Careers have been altered for some NBA players, while others have healed and returned after a few days, all depending on the severity. But the third-year guard, who missed a season at Virginia after foot surgery six years ago, was a quick study. He absorbed everything the Bucks\u2019 medical staff told him about the injury and, because there\u2019d be no procedure this time around, shifted quickly into rehab. \u201cI got the MRI the day we came back from Miami, and then I talked to the doctor and he told me the timeframe,\u201d Brogdon said. Six-to-eight weeks. With the playoffs due to start in four, and Milwaukee closing in on the No. 1 seed in the Eastern Conference. Brogdon claims to have stayed calm, but his teammates weren\u2019t privy to the exam itself or the chats with the doctors and trainers. Initially, they feared the worst. \u201cWe were kind of frustrated at the time,\u201d Giannis Antetokounmpo said after practice Thursday . \u201cAfter the game against Miami, for a few days, we didn\u2019t know the timeline when he was going to be back. But they told us he would be ready probably the second round.\u201d Sure enough, exactly seven weeks and five days from the date of his foot injury, Brogdon \u2014 who started all 64 of his regular season appearances \u2013 subbed in for 16 minutes and \u2026 looked like himself. He scored 10 points with three rebounds and four assists in the Bucks\u2019 Game 5 clincher May 8 over the Boston Celtics in their East semifinals series . In the opener against Toronto on Wednesday at Fiserv Forum, skeptics familiar with Brogdon\u2019s extended layoff were squinting hard in search of rust. It was nowhere to be found \u2014 he was the best player off the bench for either side, scoring 15 points in almost 27 minutes and logging defensive shifts on Raptors star forward Kawhi Leonard. By halftime, Brogdon was the only Milwaukee player in the black in plus\/minus rating (plus-6). By the end, he had posted a game-high plus-18. Leonard, by contrast, took 26 shots to score his 31 points and logged a minus-4 while coping with Brogdon, Khris Middleton and a rotating cast of help defenders. \u201cHe had a huge impact on the game in a lot of different ways,\u201d Budenholzer said Thursday, echoing his postgame sentiments. \u201cI just feel so fortunate to be adding Malcolm back into our mix. And hopefully getting deeper and stronger as we move through the playoffs.\u201d It is a rarity, a team getting healthier as the games stack up. Golden State is looking for a similar bump when Kevin Durant, and perhaps DeMarcus Cousins, return in time to help in the West finals or the Finals. But Brogdon\u2019s value is more subtle as he proved indispensable to Milwaukee\u2019s accomplishments this season, providing a stabilizing influence both on and off the court. It wasn\u2019t just Brogdon\u2019s shooting accuracy, remarkable as that was (he became only the eighth NBA player since 1979 to shoot 50 percent from the field, 40 percent on 3-pointers and 90 percent from the foul line). It was an ability to impose himself at both ends for a minute or two, attacking the rim, launching a 3-pointer or making a stop during a Milwaukee lull. Next thing they or their opponents knew, the Bucks were on their way to one of their signature double-digit victories. That\u2019s the guy the league\u2019s best regular season team could ill afford to lose, the one they were so thrilled to welcome back. \u201cPlantar fascia is not an injury that was going to take me out for long,\u201d Brogdon said. \u201cI knew that. It was just, at what point I was going to be back. And I had to be mentally prepared for it.\u201d That\u2019s always the challenge. Injury rehab doesn\u2019t just open a moat in a player\u2019s timeline for when he\u2019s back on the floor, it sends him into another realm altogether. Brogdon had treatment to receive, exercises to do and routines to follow. Meanwhile, his teammates and coaches were locked in, preparing physically and mentally to face the Pistons or the Celtics. It\u2019s easy, with such divergent agendas, for the injured guy to drift or feel distant from the group. Brogdon and the Bucks, though, kept him involved. He traveled to away games and got much of his rehab work done early so he could continue to participate at practice, even if it meant coach-y stuff like tossing the ball to teammates. \u201cI think [Coach Budenholzer] does a great job of that,\u201d Brogdon said. \u201cKeeping me around, making sure I\u2019m in every film session. My schedule is really around the guys. Work out, but in practice I\u2019m active, passing the ball, I\u2019m doing what I can to really participate.\u201d The backdrop to Brogdon\u2019s injury absence was a little ominous, too. He will be a free agent this summer , and here he was getting hurt when his team and its rivals would be assessing his worth contractually. He is in line for a big raise from the three-year, $3.8 million deal he got as a second-round pick (No. 36 overall) in the 2016 Draft . \u201cIt\u2019s something that comes up, when you talk about injury in your contract year,\u201d Brogdon told NBA.com. \u201cBut I have a great agent [Danielle Cantor-Jeweler] and I have a great coaching staff and front office that were patient with me. They didn\u2019t rush me back, they let me come back at the right time.\u201d All season long, NBA coaches get asked about injuries with the preface, \u201cIf this were a playoff game \u2026\u201d Once Brogdon missed the last 13 of the Bucks\u2019 82, the next eight were all postseason. And still, he was a scratch. \u201cI was close but I needed the time,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not a guy who is ever going to rush back, no matter the circumstance. As an NBA player, you\u2019ve got to worry about your health first. Get back on the court when you\u2019re ready to get back on the court.\u201d The Bucks\u2019 strong camaraderie helped, as did the fact they went 7-1 in the eight playoff games Brogdon missed. George Hill, Nikola Mirotic, Pat Connaughton and Ersan Ilyasova dialed up their contributions at various points to ease his absence. But getting back the original \u2013 he\u2019ll continue to come off the bench, but could start later in this series \u2013 is even better. Brogdon appreciates how his teammates, particularly Antetokounmpo, rendered moot any concerns he might feel disconnected. Those two banter, and the chatter never ceased. \u201cI think Giannis and I come from similar backgrounds, having a lot of brothers,\u201d Brogdon said. \u201cSo we come from families where we talk a lot of mess. Whenever he sees me at the facility in the morning, we\u2019re always going at it. Everybody knows we\u2019re gonna start. But it sort of gets us going for the day.\u201d Brogdon said he didn\u2019t get a chance to give Antetokounmpo grief over the fast-break dunk he got midway through the final quarter Wednesday, off a long bounce pass from Middleton that had their team up 96-91. Antetokounmpo had already joked with reporters that there wasn\u2019t anything Brogdon could tell him about dunks. But how did \u201cThe Greek Freak\u201d really feel about his pal\u2019s return? \u201cMalcolm did a great job just being around the team,\u201d Antetokounmpo said. \u201cTrying to get healthy and not worry about trying to handle our business. Now he\u2019s back healthy and he\u2019s been playing great.\u201d * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

And after allowing Philly to score 116 points on just 96 possessions of Game 3, they held the Sixers to just 96 per 100 over the next two games, both victories. But after his team scored less than a point per possession for just the second time in this postseason, Raptors coach Nick Nurse is more concerned with his team\u2019s offense. \u201cThe offense is a real key to this series,\u201d Nurse said on Thursday. \u201cIf they\u2019re going to be playing with it off the rim, they\u2019re going to be coming at you pretty hard, and obviously we went through a streak there [in the fourth quarter of Game 1] where we didn\u2019t make some shots. And we had a couple critical turnovers, as well. I think we put our defense in a bind because of the offense.\u201d All was good in the first quarter, when the Raptors scored 34 points on 27 possessions. But things went downhill from there. They scored fewer points (and less efficiently) with each ensuing quarter. In the second half , the only Raptors bucket not scored by Kyle Lowry or Kawhi Leonard was Pascal Siakam\u2019s buzzer-beating 3 at the end of the third quarter. Some of the struggles were just missed open shots. Siakam was 0-for-7 on corner 3s on Wednesday. Marc Gasol was 0-for-4 from beyond the arc in the second half. Both Danny Green and Norman Powell missed uncontested reverse layups. But Nurse believes his team has to be sharper offensively, not just with their shooting, but with the player and ball movement that leads to the shots they get. The Raptors were able to create advantages by drawing extra defenders to the ball. The Bucks\u2019 defense was No. 1 in the regular season in both preventing restricted-area shots (their opponents took a league-low 27 percent of their shots from the restricted area) and defending them (their opponents shot a league-low 58.0 percent in the restricted area ). In Game 1, the Raptors attempted just 17 shots in the restricted area , their lowest total in the playoffs. In the regular season, they had only four games in which they got fewer than 17 restricted-area attempts. One of those was Jan. 5 in Milwaukee. To protect the rim, the Bucks will not hesitate to meet a drive with three or four defenders. and with the collapsing defense, there should be Raptors open. The goal of every offense is to draw multiple defenders to the ball and then get the defense in rotation. The ball should be able to move faster than the rotating defense and eventually find an open shooter with a path back to the basket. But the Raptors just weren\u2019t good enough in the second half on Wednesday. Leonard probably forced too much, having his shot blocked five times . Look at the crowd he tried to score through here in the third quarter\u2026 Nurse said that, for Siakam, making the right play in a crowd is \u201cthe next step for him to take.\u201d Still, after watching the film from Game 1, Nurse said the offensive issues weren\u2019t just the players with the ball getting rid of it quickly enough, but also the players without the ball \u201crelocating\u201d to give the ball-handlers the right passing angles. \u201cI think we did a decent job of moving the basketball,\u201d Nurse said. \u201cDecent is probably not good enough this time of year. We\u2019ve got to do a special job of it. We\u2019ve got to do a good job of each time down, when you\u2019ve drawn one or two or three defenders, you\u2019ve done your job, right? Your job is to create them in rotations, and then your job becomes to get it to the next guy, and that guy\u2019s job is to take the shot or swing it. \u201cSo what we call our relocation needs to be a little bit better so when two or three guys converge on the ball, we can find those little alleyways a little more cleanly.\u201d Here\u2019s Leonard in another crowd with Gasol not anywhere useful and Lowry stationary at an angle where Eric Bledsoe is in the path of a potential pass\u2026 \u201cYou\u2019re talking about 3-to-4 feet sometimes,\u201d Nurse said. \u201cThe angle that they can\u2019t see you is the fine line.\u201d Everything is easier said than done against what has been the league\u2019s No. 1 defense, both in the regular season and in the playoffs . But this is the conference finals, and the Raptors simply have to be better. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

Come for the anguish and frustration that plays out across Brook Lopez\u2019s face over the course of a typical NBA game, stay for the maniacal, jubilant, fourth-quarter clapping that gets turned into a GIF and goes viral within minutes. Come for the unbuttoned Fresno Grizzlies minor league baseball jersey, stay for the Disney fashion T-shirt showing beneath it and the Pizza Planet cap up top. \u201cI\u2019ve always tried to have fun when I go out and play basketball,\u201d said Lopez. The Milwaukee Bucks\u2019 center embodied his team\u2019s performance as they clawed back Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals, beating the Toronto Raptors , 108-100, Wednesday night at Fiserv Forum. \u201cI obviously love playing the game,\u201d said Lopez, dressed like a 7-foot 10-year-old for his podium appearance. \u201cBut no question I\u2019ve been having a great time here.\u201d Lopez, 31, scored 29 points, a personal playoff best, and grabbed 11 rebounds. It was his first 20-point night of the Bucks\u2019 10 playoff games so far, only the fourth of his career (he has appeared in just 23 postseason games in 11 seasons). And it came on the heels of a Game 5 effort against Boston a week ago in which Lopez was held scoreless. Milwaukee clinched anyway. This one was an ordeal for Lopez and for the Bucks, an opener in the best-of-seven series in which they slogged through three quarters without much touch or rhythm. The style of play they\u2019ve embraced over 82 games and the past month of postseason was betraying them; Milwaukee kept hoisting and missing 3-pointers, as single-mindedly in spite of horrid results as if they all wore beards and played for Houston. The resulting nastiness: A 6-for-34 (17.6 percent) showing from the arc, while digging an 83-76 hole that maxed out at 13 points. Lopez was a notable offender. He missed his first three from deep and only broke through midway through the second quarter. His shot from out front that got the Bucks within 42-37 was followed by a reaction of one part frustration, one part exasperation and a couple parts relief. That\u2019s the wide open space of Lopez\u2019s game, out there on the wing or in the corner launching for all the world to see. Home fans seem to live and die on each attempt, riding an emotional rollercoaster while \u2013 on nights such as this one \u2013 they wait for his results to regress to the mean.  That finally happened in the fourth quarter. Lopez \u2013 who shot a total of 31 3-pointers in his first eight seasons, 300-plus in each of the next two and ultimately 512 in 2018-19 with the Bucks \u2013 hit two to get his team going in the quarter. His third in the period, one possession after Lopez finished a slo-mo fast-break for a 101-100 lead, sent Toronto into a timeout, down four with 1:55 left. That was when Lopez came with the clapping. And when play resumed, there was Lopez again, getting a hand on Kawhi Leonard\u2019s attempt to attack the rim, stripping and corralling the ball for a block and rebound. As good as Kyle Lowry was over the final 12 minutes, as potent as the Raptors\u2019 offense was at certain points earlier, they were done scoring for the night. Lopez did the small stuff all night, even finishing off the dribble a couple times. It\u2019s just that, by virtue of how he and the Bucks have played this season, those things get overshadowed by the broad strokes that didn\u2019t go his way until late. \u201cThis is the Brook we all know and we all love,\u201d said Giannis Antetokounmpo. Said Khris Middleton: \u201cHe\u2019s a beast. Inside the paint, made some big plays for us. On the defensive end, he covers up so much for our mistakes.\u201d The Bucks\u2019 adherence to what works has been tested for quarters, for halves, but so far only for one whole game in these playoffs \u2013 they dropped the opener against Boston. Milwaukee won the next four in a row to oust the Celtics . In the dressing room afterward, there was chatter that they\u2019d snatched one away, that they couldn\u2019t have played worse \u2013 at least on offense. In that fourth quarter, outscoring Toronto 32-17, Milwaukee made up for a multitude of sins. The Bucks hit 50 percent of their shots, missed only 1-of-10 free throws and dominated the boards (14-4) to finish with a 60-45 edge. The Raptors were held to 5-of-22 shooting in the quarter. And Lopez, dragging a minus-5 plus\/minus rating through three quarters, was sitting on a plus-7 by the horn. The key? Absolutely faith in the style they\u2019ve honed since late September, and a commitment to letting it fly. Whether we\u2019re talking about a conscienceless approach to 3-pointers or Lopez\u2019s irrepressible good nature. He has made as many as eight 3-pointers in a game this season ( at Denver, Nov. 11 ) and attempted as many as 15 ( vs. Brooklyn, Dec. 29 ). There is no such thing as too many. \u201cThat\u2019s what my teammates have been telling me,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cGeorge Hill specifically and then [Giannis], too. They just stick in my mind: \u2018Keep shooting the ball, you just need one to go down. Keep letting it fly.\u201d * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Kawhi Leonard and Marc Gasol had just combined to shut down a Giannis Antetokounmpo drive, leaving Antetokounmpo on the floor as Kyle Lowry pushed the ball in the opposite direction. Brook Lopez was trying to catch up with Lowry, but wasn\u2019t there, so Khris Middleton was back-pedaling to the paint, leaving Danny Green by himself on the left side of the floor. A few feet before reaching the 3-point line, Lowry picked up his dribble and fired a pass to an open Green, who was the second best 3-point shooter in the league this season. But the pass was low, forcing Green to catch it to the side of his right knee. It was a rare moment of inaccuracy on this night from Lowry, and it kept Green from getting a shot off before Middleton closed out to the 3-point line. The Raptors had an opportunity, and it was gone. Four passes later, Green had the ball back on the left wing, looking to get it to Leonard in the post against Eric Bledsoe. Middleton crowded him, preventing the pass. And when Green put the ball on the floor and crossed over to his left hand, he tripped over Middleton\u2019s outstretched right leg. Green lost control of the ball. \u201cI tried to get him off me,\u201d Green said afterward, holding back the frustration of not getting the foul call. \u201cIt didn\u2019t go well, I guess.\u201d Middleton picked up the loose ball, and he eventually got it to Brook Lopez to put the Bucks up by one with 2:22 to go. The Raptors would never get the lead back. They missed their final eight shots and went scoreless on their final seven possessions as Milwaukee took a 1-0 series lead with a 108-100 victory on Wednesday. It was a blown opportunity for Toronto in a myriad of ways. They led by as many as 13 points, having gone 7-0 in games they led by double-digits through the first two rounds of the playoffs. After Pascal Siakam beat the third-quarter buzzer with a pull-up 3-pointer, they led by seven points entering the fourth. Prior to Wednesday, the Raptors were 62-5 when holding a lead of five or more points in the last 12 minutes of regulation. Lowry had one of the best playoff games of his life, scoring 30 points on 10-for-15 from the field. After shooting 1-for-20 from 3-point range in three regular season games against Milwaukee, Lowry made seven 3-pointers (one shy of his career high) on nine attempts on Wednesday. \u201cIndividual stuff doesn\u2019t do anything for me,\u201d Lowry said. \u201cI want to win games.\u201d In Game 7 against Philadelphia on Sunday, the Raptors were searching for any kind of offense beyond that of Leonard and they had shortened their rotation with their reserves having struggled through most of the series. Game 1 in Milwaukee was a fresh start and less of a grind than any of the games against Philly. It was the fastest-paced game of the Raptors\u2019 postseason, and that helped the Toronto offense find itself. Leonard barely touched the ball in the first five minutes of the first quarter, and the Raptors jumped out to a 19-8 lead, with each of the other four Toronto starters having made at least one 3-pointer . The confidence and rhythm that was lost for much of the last round was back. \u201cIt\u2019s much more open and flowing and moving the ball,\u201d Raptors guard Fred VanVleet said of the difference from one series to the next. \u201cThe last series was a lot of bumping and grinding and iso and post-ups. It\u2019s kind of getting back to the way that we like to play.\u201d On the other end of the floor, the sharpness of Toronto\u2019s defensive rotations carried over from Sunday, when they shut down the Sixers\u2019 half-court offense both early and late. They kept Antetokounmpo in check and it was all good for three quarters. The Raptors had an opportunity to win a game in Milwaukee and steal home-court advantage. But they let it slip away. With Leonard off the floor to start the fourth quarter, the seven-point lead was gone in just over two minutes. Lowry kept his team in it, but he was the only Raptor to make a shot from the field in the fourth. He was 5-for-7 and his teammates were 0-for-15 . \u201cMan,\u201d Raptors coach Nick Nurse said, \u201cwe had a couple great looks.\u201d Missed shots and turnovers led to an inability to get stops on the other end, which led to an inability to push the ball as much as the Raptors did earlier in the night. Maybe with a more accurate pass from Lowry on that fast break, Green knocks down a three to put the Raptors back up four. Even if he misses a shot in that situation, Milwaukee doesn\u2019t get as easy a fast break as they did with the ensuing turnover. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve got a team down like that you\u2019ve got to be mature enough and professional enough to try to keep them there,\u201d Green said. \u201cI feel like this one, we let it slip away.\u201d It was a 32-17 fourth period in favor of Milwaukee, and the Raptors now have to hope that the good vibes and rhythm of the first three quarters weren\u2019t completely lost, along with what could have been their best chance to get a road win in this series. VanVleet didn\u2019t want call it a blown opportunity, choosing to see it as the Raptors being right there with the best team in the league on its home floor. \u201cWe understand that we can play with these guys,\u201d VanVleet said, \u201cand I\u2019m sure they feel the same way.\u201d On the other hand, the Raptors can\u2019t count on Lowry shooting like that again or Milwaukee shooting 25 percent (11-for-44) from 3-point range on the other end of the floor. The Bucks have only shot worse in eight of their 92 games this season. The Raptors will have two days to put the frustration of Game 1 behind them. Game 2 is another opportunity and, as they learned in the last series, there\u2019s not necessarily any carry-over from one game to the next. \u201cIt really doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Nurse said. \u201cIf it\u2019s a buzzer-beater and you lose, or if it\u2019s a 30-point blowout and you lose, that game\u2019s over.\u201d On to the next one. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

Dell and Sonya Curry are in the running for First Couple of the NBA, and in the Western Conference finals, this honor comes with an equal amount of pride and anxiety. \u201cThere\u2019s so much emotion involved because you want both to do well, and here they are, on opposite benches,\u201d says the mom. The father agreed, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s hard for both of us.\u201d Their sons are, of course, Stephen and Seth Curry, and their dilemma is being played out in front of millions on TV, who see Dell and Sonya sitting in the stands wearing custom-made split jerseys honoring both players. For Game 1, Dell had Steph\u2019s No. 30 Warriors jersey on the front and Seth\u2019s No. 31 Blazers on the back, and vice versa for Sonya. They\u2019ll switch up as the series goes along because the parents never want to show favoritism for any of their children. \u201cSomebody\u2019s going to lose and we\u2019re going to the Finals with one of them and it will be bittersweet,\u201d Dell Curry said. \u201cBut whomever doesn\u2019t go to the Finals for his team will be there for his brother.\u201d Aside from this being a sweet story involving a close-knit and stable family, what\u2019s amazing about this is that it\u2019s happening at all. Yes, the NBA has had a fair share of siblings before \u2014 do you know how many Plumlees are cashing basketball checks? \u2014 but never in the same conference finals. And what\u2019s more, neither of the Curry boys dropped strong hints, even as far as high school, that they\u2019d be on anybody\u2019s NBA bench. But religion and faith run through all the Currys and the parents, who\u2019ve been married 31 years, must\u2019ve struck the proper chord because they\u2019ve been blessed with a playoff series neither will soon forget, no matter how it turns out. By now, their made-for-reality TV story is a familiar one. Dell was a smooth-shooting guard at Virginia Tech where he met Sonya, who played for the women\u2019s volleyball team. They soon became a couple and delivered Steph while Dell played for the Cavaliers, who drafted him. Seth came a few years later in Charlotte, where Dell by then was one of the game\u2019s best sixth men, dropping shots from distance for the Hornets. Their basketball education started at home and specifically the driveway basketball court where the boys wore Hornets jerseys and pretended to be in the NBA. \u201cThey battled each other,\u201d Dell Curry said. \u201cYou know, trying to get the game-winning point and arguing whether you got fouled or not. You\u2019re standing there watching them settle it and it never got settled. My wife and I took turns being the referee deciding who won the game.\u201d Understandably, it never got heated, as anger or jealousy doesn\u2019t seem to be in the Curry family DNA. \u201cSteph did a good job with that,\u201d said Dell. \u201cBeing the oldest boy, he could\u2019ve beaten up on [Seth] a lot.\u201d The boys became familiar faces around the Hornets\u2019 practice facility and games. They attended small private high schools instead of basketball academies because of academics; their parents didn\u2019t specifically groom them for the NBA. Even if the father\u2019s shooting genetics and mother\u2019s competitive instincts were soon apparent with both boys, they were size challenged. They played like solid basketball players but looked like future accountants. That all changed for Steph not long after he went to Davidson College and for Seth after he transferred from Liberty University to Duke. Steph was an NCAA tournament sensation, and later, Seth became a solid starter who replaced an injured Kyrie Irving at one of the country\u2019s most prestigious programs. And thus began the crazy travel schedule for their parents, each splitting the duties between their sons as best they could; it hasn\u2019t calmed down since. Steph has had the gold-plated path, winning a pair of Kia MVPs and three championships, changing the game from a shooting standpoint and punching an automatic ticket to the Hall of Fame someday. Seth\u2019s career has been nomadic. He wasn\u2019t drafted because teams wondered about his ball-handling skills. The Warriors initially tossed him a lifeline, but Seth didn\u2019t survive training camp and was sent to their G-League team. He\u2019s with his sixth team in five years and seemingly turned the corner last season with the Mavericks, where he started 42 games before injuries intervened. Steph is vested in his younger brother\u2019s career and quietly simmers about how Seth, who\u2019s now 28, lacks a long-term deal and security with one team. Although the younger Curry finished third in 3-point shooting percentage this season \u2014 one spot ahead of Stephen \u2014 Seth becomes a free agent this summer. Yet the good news is he should have interest after a breakout season for the Blazers. \u201cThey want each other to do well,\u201d said Dell. \u201cThey cheer for each other. They watch each other\u2019s games all the time. Steph\u2019s a quiet guy but he roots for his brother and vice-versa.\u201d For the last several years, Seth has been in the stands watching his brother during the postseason, sitting with his parents, marveling at Steph\u2019s talent and fortunes like anyone else. Until now. And here they are, trying to deny each other a championship. There are times when the Curry boys will guard each other and that always puts their parents in a tough spot. When it happened in Game 1, Dell and Sonya just watched, frozen in place. No clapping, no cheering, no nothing. \u201cComing in here, we didn\u2019t know what to expect or how to react,\u201d Dell said. \u201cThis hasn\u2019t happened before. Usually we can go all-in on one team. We don\u2019t know how to cheer or how to respond when one team goes on a run. We can\u2019t totally go on one side.\u201d Sonya said: \u201cIt\u2019s hard on my nerves.\u201d These are proud parent problems. There is a solution to the relentless travel, the back-and-forth between two teams and this emotional wringer and the constant wondering about games and victories and losses: Maybe one day, even next season, the boys will be \u2026 teammates? Dell Curry\u2019s face suddenly brightens and the stress disappears. \u201cNow that would be great,\u201d he said \u201cBeing brothers and teammates, and in this situation where they both win? Let\u2019s see what happens. Both have a lot of years left in the league. Seth\u2019s a free agent. You never know.\u201d Until then, if that ever happens, the parents will keep their travel agent on speed-dial and keep a tailor on stand-by in case they need another set of jerseys stitched together. \u201cIt\u2019s been hectic,\u201d Dell Curry said. \u201cBut don\u2019t get me wrong, we\u2019re not taking this for granted. We\u2019re just taking it all in. We\u2019re not complaining at all. We know how special this is.\u201d * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

TNT will televise the third annual NBA Awards live on Monday, June 24 at 9 p.m. ET from Barker Hangar in Los Angeles. The two previous recipients of the Lifetime Achievement Award were Bill Russell (2017) and Oscar Robertson (2018). With their epic rivalry, individual brilliance and team success, Johnson and Bird helped define the modern NBA and elevate the league in the 1980s. The rivals turned friends both earned three NBA Most Valuable Player Awards, nine All-NBA First Team selections and 12 NBA All-Star nods, along with being inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame and securing spots among the NBA\u2019s 50 Greatest Players. They were also teammates and co-captains on USA Basketball\u2019s gold-medal-winning Dream Team at the 1992 Summer Olympics, which was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2010, making Johnson and Bird two-time honorees.  Johnson and Bird have epitomized greatness dating to their memorable clash in the 1979 NCAA Tournament, when Johnson lifted Michigan State past Bird-led Indiana State in the national championship game, which is still the highest-rated game on television in college basketball history. Both made an immediate impact in the NBA the following season, with Johnson leading the Los Angeles Lakers to a championship and Bird capturing Rookie of the Year honors with the Boston Celtics. A three-time Bill Russell NBA Finals MVP Award recipient, Johnson won five NBA championships and helped the Lakers reach the NBA Finals nine times. Renowned for his extraordinary court vision and unique flair as a tall point guard, Johnson averaged 19.5 points, 11.2 assists and 7.2 rebounds per game in 13 seasons with the Lakers. He ranks fifth on the NBA\u2019s all-time assists list. > Legends Profile: Magic Johnson Johnson retired in 1991 after announcing that he was HIV positive, becoming an advocate for HIV\/AIDS awareness and prevention. He returned to play in the 1992 NBA All-Star Game in Orlando, where he was named MVP after an unforgettable performance, and later came out of retirement to rejoin the Lakers during the 1995-96 season.
