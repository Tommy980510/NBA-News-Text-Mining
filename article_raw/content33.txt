According to ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski, the Pelicans have agreed to deal with former No. 3 overall pick Jahlil Okafor. Okafor averaged 6.4 points, 2.9 rebounds and shot 56.6 percent overall last season for the Nets, who acquired him via a trade with the Philadelphia 76ers in early December . Wojnarowski reports ( via Twitter ) that Okafor\u2019s deal is partially guaranteed for next season and has a team option for 2019-20. The terms of the deal were also reported by Michael Scotto of The Athletic. Once a prized piece of the Sixers\u2019 rebuilding process, Okafor rapidly fell out of favor with the rise of star center Joel Embiid. He appeared in just two games for Philadelphia last season before he was shipped to the Nets with guard Nik Stauskas for a 2019 second-round pick and veteran forward Trevor Booker. This summer, the Pelicans lost All-Star center DeMarcus Cousins in free agency to the Golden State Warriors. However, they rebounded by signing young forward Julius Randle of the Los Angeles Lakers to a two-year deal . In New Orleans, Okafor will be a part of a front line that is led by All-Star big man Anthony Davis and features Randle, sharpshooting forward Nikola Mirotic, defensive-minded Solomon Hill and others. In December, former team president Bryan Colangelo said he reached a deal with a team he declined to name to trade Okafor to in 2016-17 \u2026 until it fell apart at the last minute. That led to an awkward situation where Okafor didn\u2019t even travel with the team during the trade deadline. As a rookie in 2015-16, Okafor led the Sixers in scoring and was an All-Rookie first teamer as Embiid mended from his injuries. Okafor played 50 games in the 2016-17 season and never really meshed with the franchise center. Okafor started piling up DNP-CDs and those stretched into last season. Under former general manager Sam Hinkie, the Sixers orchestrated a plan to strip the roster of talent to gobble draft picks that could turn into future rotation players. Accused of tanking, the Sixers went 18-64 in 2014-15 and earned the No. 3 pick. They landed a flop instead of a future star. Okafor not only dropped behind Embiid on the depth chart, but in 2017-18, fell behind Richaun Holmes and Amir Johnson. Okafor played in 105 games (81 starts) with the Sixers and averaged 14.6 points, 5.9 rebounds, 1.2 assists and 26.2 minutes while shooting 51.0 percent from the field.

Sports and Sam Amick and Jace Evans of USA Today . Here\u2019s more from Charania on the pending move : Anthony was waived by the Atlanta Hawks on July 30, after being traded from the Oklahoma City Thunder on July 19. Per various reports , the veteran forward is expected to join Chris Paul, James Harden and the Rockets now that he has officially entered the free-agent player pool . According to Wojnarowski, the contract is expected to be a one-year deal worth $2.4 million. On Aug. 7, Charania confirmed Anthony and the Rockets verbally agreed to a deal that Anthony will sign when he returns from an offseason trip to Africa. Anthony\u2019s lone season in Oklahoma City was largely a bust. He averaged 16.2 points and struggled at times in his new role alongside Russell Westbrook and Paul George. The 10-time All-Star posted career lows in scoring average and field goal percentage, and the Thunder were ousted in the first round of the playoffs by Utah. The 34-year-old Anthony had been the headliner his entire career \u2014 he\u2019s 19th in NBA history with 25,417 points \u2014 but he was more of a catch-and-shoot scorer last season instead of the isolation specialist he had always been. His playing time dwindled in the playoffs. In Game 6 of the first-round series against Utah that ended Oklahoma City\u2019s season, he played fewer minutes than reserve Jerami Grant. After the season, he said he prefers to play with the ball in his hands more and said coming off the bench is \u201cout of the question.\u201d Anthony opted in earlier this summer to accept the $28 million he was due next season. The Thunder re-signed Grant, then it was reported that Anthony and the Thunder would eventually part ways, though it was unclear how it would happen. Anthony would help the Rockets fill their void at forward after the team lost Trevor Ariza and Luc Mbah a Moute during free agency .

(AP) \u2014 Stephen Curry can only imagine the intensity level of the Lakers-Warriors rivalry now that LeBron James has landed in L.A. After four straight NBA Finals against James and the Cleveland Cavaliers, two-time defending champion Golden State will get four matchups against James during the regular season. \u201cAnd a whole new-look Laker team with some of the young kids. It should be fun, the Bay Area and L.A. and the whole thing,\u201d Curry said Monday in a sit-down with The Associated Press while hosting his annual elite camp at Ultimate Fieldhouse. \u201cWhen I first got into the league Oracle would be buzzing any time the Lakers came in. There probably will be a revolution of Laker fans that are going to try to creep in but I hope Bay Area and Dub Nation we keep control of that competition because we\u2019re on top right now.\u201d The schedule is set to be released later this week. Curry is eager to have new teammate and dominant big man DeMarcus Cousins healthy and recovered from surgery on a torn left Achilles tendon, which will give Golden State five All-Star starters on the floor together. Cousins has never been to the playoffs and can now chase a championship alongside fellow All-Stars Curry, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting because nobody going into free agency thought about DeMarcus as an option then all of a sudden he found his way onto our team,\u201d Curry said before getting in an on-court workout of his own. \u201cSo for us to have a new dynamic, a new look, whenever he\u2019s fully healthy it should be amazing. I think we got better. Obviously we lost some pieces that were very vital to us winning a championship but you\u2019ve got to evolve, you\u2019ve got to find different things to focus on as you\u2019re trying to repeat, so it should be exciting.\u201d After winning a second straight NBA title and third in four years, it\u2019s another whirlwind summer for two-time MVP Curry, whose season was interrupted several times by injuries. He has a newborn son, Canon, and is hosting his Under Armour \u201cStephen Curry Select Camp\u201d this week for top high school players \u2014 including two girls for the first time, one being his father Dell\u2019s goddaughter, Cameron Brink, from Beaverton, Oregon. Later this week he will again play in the Web.com tour\u2019s Ellie Mae Classic at TPC Stonebrae in Hawyard. He has an indoor putting green at home as well as a swing simulator that has helped him leading up to the event given he also is busy with three young children at home. \u201cAm I getting any sleep? I\u2019m getting the right amount of sleep for having a month-old son, my wife as well,\u201d Curry said. \u201cThere aren\u2019t really many expectations when a new baby comes, but my golf game is in decent shape. I haven\u2019t played as much as I\u2019d like to leading up to the tournament. I have a full swing golf simulator in my house now that\u2019s helping me prepare. Actually I\u2019m getting in trouble because at home I sneak into that room way more than I should just because it\u2019s right there and I get my little swings in. I would say my preparation level is adequate enough to play well and hopefully play better than I did last year.\u201d"},{"id":39042,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/jr-nba-world-championship-what-you-need-know","date":"2018-08-07","title":"Jr. NBA World Championship: Five things you need to know","content":" On Tuesday, the inaugural Jr. NBA World Championship tips off in Orlando as 32 of the top boys and girls teams from around the world come together for a first-of-its-kind international youth basketball competition.

Why did they do this? Or they have their opinions.

James is behind the three-part documentary series, \u201cShut Up and Dribble,\u201d announced Monday by Showtime. Set to debut in October, the same month James suits up for his new team, the series looks at the changing role of athletes in the current political and cultural climate against the backdrop of the NBA. Its title comes from a comment Fox News host Laura Ingraham made to James in February when she sought to rebuke him for talking politics during an interview. James is the executive producer of the series along with his business partner Maverick Carter and his agent Rich Paul. Gotham Chopra, who directed Showtime\u2019s \u201cKobe Bryant\u2019s Muse\u201d in 2015, helmed the project. The series traces the modern history of the league and its players starting with the 1976 merger of the freewheeling American Basketball Association and the National Basketball Association, how the top players have expanded their notoriety off the court in fields such as business and fashion while becoming icons in the process. James has another show, \u201cThe Shop\u201d debuting Aug. 28 on HBO in which he leads conversation and debate among his guests in barbershops around the country. James found himself drawn into politics last week when President Donald Trump unleashed a withering attack on him in a tweet after an interview aired with CNN anchor Don Lemon in which he deemed Trump divisive. Although James has long been a Trump critic, calling the president \u201cU bum\u201d in a 2017 tweet, the tweet was Trump\u2019s first attack on the player, who just opened up a school for underprivileged children in his hometown of Akron, Ohio. \u201cLebron James was just interviewed by the dumbest man on television, Don Lemon,\u201d Trump posted. \u201cHe made Lebron look smart, which isn\u2019t easy to do.\u201d"},{"id":39019,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/greg-monroe-toronto-raptors-agree-deal-report","date":"2018-08-06","title":"Report: Greg Monroe, Toronto Raptors agree to one-year deal","content":" Veteran center Greg Monroe has agreed to a one-year deal with the Toronto Raptors, according to a report from Shams Charania of Yahoo Sports .

If anything, their chances have increased with the addition of DeMarcus Cousins and with Trevor Ariza\u2019s departure from Houston. But LeBron James\u2019 arrival in L.A. makes the Western Conference all the more interesting, given how many other West teams are built to win now and some particularly intriguing urgency in places like Denver, Minnesota, New Orleans and Portland. > Eastern Conference Mid-Summer Power Rankings The biggest question is whether James\u2019 arrival makes the Lakers a lock to reach the playoffs. His teams have been no worse than a No. 4 seed in each of the last 13 seasons, but all of those teams were in the East (which has had a losing record vs. the West in 18 of the last 19 years). James isn\u2019t getting any younger, and the Lakers\u2019 roster isn\u2019t an ideal fit given the youth of the pieces that were already there and lack of shooting with the pieces that were added after James made his decision. Throw in all the personalities involved and the Lakers are the biggest story in the league. But there\u2019s intrigue up and down the Western Conference.

Over the next 17 seasons, Parker evolved into one of the world\u2019s best players as he helped San Antonio win four NBA championships from 2003-14. Parker\u2019s time in San Antonio ended this summer when he agreed to a two-year contract with the Charlotte Hornets . This move signaled the end of an era in San Antonio, which has seen plenty of change since Tim Duncan\u2019s retirement in 2016. Despite the change of scenery, San Antonio will forever hold a special place in Parker\u2019s heart, according to his letter published in The Players\u2019 Tribune . In the letter, Parker writes about his Draft tryout with the Spurs, learning from Tim Duncan and coach Gregg Popovich, and how \u201cSpurs Culture\u201d shaped his career: Parker also shines light on how coach Popovich\u2019s influence helped him have the courage to put team before individual last season: In his final season with the Spurs, Parker played 55 games averaged 7.7 points and 3.5 assists. During his career, the six-time All-Star and 2007 Finals MVP averaged 15.8 points and 5.7 assists. He was part of 137 playoff wins with Popovich, the second most by any coach and player in NBA history. Popovich and Duncan combined for 157 playoff wins. In the wake of Parker\u2019s departure from the Spurs, Popovich soon thereafter released a statement on the impact the point guard had on the franchise. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to put into words how important Tony Parker has been to the Spurs franchise over the past two decades,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cFrom his first game in 2001 at age 19, TP has impressed and inspired us \u2013 day-after-day, game-after-game, season-after-season \u2013 with his passion, dedication and desire. We are grateful to Tony for 17 years of truly amazing memories. While the four championships, six All-Star appearances and four All-NBA selections highlight his resume, the biggest joy for me has been to have the pleasure of watching TP grow up before our eyes. All of us in the Spurs organization will miss having Tony in our program and wish him and his family the best as he continues his remarkable career in Charlotte.\u201d  Parker hoped to make it an even 20 seasons with the Spurs , which would require the team to re-sign him for three years. Parker willingly gave up his starting role to youngster Dejounte Murray last season. Alongside Duncan and Manu Ginobili, Parker comprised the Spurs\u2019 \u201cBig Three\u201d for many years. But Duncan has retired, Parker is now gone and Ginobili\u2019s status for next season is unknown. Parker has also appeared in 17 consecutive postseasons; only Karl Malone and John Stockton\u2019s run of 19 straight playoff trips are longer. The move reunites Parker with new Charlotte coach James Borrego, who most recently was an assistant in San Antonio. And Parker is close friends with Charlotte\u2019s Nicolas Batum, who predictably was thrilled by the news. \u201dNumber 9, I see you soon in Buzz City my big bro,\u201d Batum wrote on Twitter.

(AP) \u2014 Ahead of campaigning in Ohio on Saturday, President Donald Trump unleashed a withering attack on the state\u2019s favorite son, savaging NBA star LeBron James in a late-night tweet that derided the intelligence of one of the nation\u2019s most prominent African-American men. Melania Trump\u2019s spokeswoman quickly distanced the first lady from the criticism of James, saying in a statement Saturday afternoon that it appeared James was \u201cworking to do good things on behalf of our next generation\u201d and that the first lady would be open to visiting his new school for at-risk children. The statement didn\u2019t criticize the president. Trump blasted James late Friday after an interview aired with CNN anchor Don Lemon in which he deemed Trump divisive. Although James has long been a Trump critic, calling the president \u201cU bum\u201d in a 2017 tweet, the tweet was Trump\u2019s first attack on the player, who just opened up a school for underprivileged children in his hometown of Akron. The tweet came hours before Trump traveled to Columbus, Ohio, for a rally north of town in support of the Republican in a special U.S. House election on Tuesday. Once in Ohio, however, Trump stayed away from the controversy and never mentioned James as he hammered away at Democrats and other favorite targets. \u201cLebron James was just interviewed by the dumbest man on television, Don Lemon,\u201d Trump posted. \u201cHe made Lebron look smart, which isn\u2019t easy to do.\u201d Trump then, unexpectedly, appeared to weigh in on the growing debate over who is the greatest NBA player of all time, James or Michael Jordan, by writing \u201cI like Mike!\u201d Many former and current professional athletes, including Jordan, jumped to James\u2019 defense. \u201cI support LeBron James. He\u2019s doing an amazing job for his community,\u201d Jordan said in a statement to The Associated Press through his representative via text Saturday. Trump has long denounced the media \u2014 CNN in particular \u2014 and rarely lets a slight go unnoticed. But the attack on James, who was being interviewed by another black man, to some resembled a racial dog whistle. He routinely deems Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters of California, who is also black, as \u201clow IQ\u201d \u2014 an insult he repeated during the Ohio rally Saturday night. Ohio Gov. Josh Kasich, a Republican who at times criticizes Trump, tweeted: \u201cRather than criticizing @KingJames, we should be celebrating him for his charity work and efforts to help kids.\u201d Trump has repeatedly been questioned about his views on race, from deeming many Mexican immigrants \u201crapists\u201d during his campaign kickoff speech for the Republican presidential nomination to placing blame on \u201cboth sides\u201d for the violent clash between white supremacists and counterprotesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, a year ago. James, who campaigned for Trump\u2019s opponent, Democrat Hillary Clinton, and has not been shy about using his celebrity for social causes, did the interview from the public school he opened, called the \u201cI Promise\u201d school. Every student receives free tuition, as well as free food, a uniform and even a free bike. In the interview, James said he \u201cwould never sit across\u201d from Trump, though he would talk to former President Barack Obama. James\u2019 publicist declined to respond to Trump\u2019s tweet, but early Saturday afternoon, James retweeted a post from the \u201cI Promise\u201d school and said: \u201cLet\u2019s get it kids!! Love you guys.\u201d Lemon responded to the president, invoking both the administration\u2019s forced-family-separations policy and Mrs. Trump\u2019s social media etiquette campaign. \u201cWho\u2019s the real dummy? A man who puts kids in classrooms or one who puts kids in cages? #BeBest\u201d Lemon tweeted. James played for over a decade \u2014 and in two stints \u2014 with the Cleveland Cavaliers and delivered a title to the championship-starved region in 2016. Although he departed for the Los Angeles Lakers earlier this summer, the superstar remains very popular in the Buckeye State, and Trump\u2019s attack could be a gift for the Democrat in Tuesday\u2019s special congressional race. \u201cI don\u2019t have to tell *anyone* what LeBron James means to Ohio,\u201d tweeted Democrat Danny O\u2019Connor, who was running against state Sen. Troy Balderson. The White House did not immediately respond to a request to clarify Trump\u2019s remarks. But even some Trump allies chided him. Geraldo Rivera, the journalist and Trump confidant, broke with the president to say he wished Trump \u201cturned other cheek re @KingJames & (@donlemon While I disagree with their conclusion that @POTUS is using sports to divide America along racial lines, they\u2019re both sincere & intelligent men. LeBron just pledged millions for a school for underprivileged kids.\u201d Along with Jordan, a number of other athletes spoke out in support of James. Pro Football Hall of Famer Shannon Sharpe tweeted: \u201cIt should be beneath the dignity of a sitting POTUS to take racist shots at D. Lemon and Lebron James.\u201d NBA player Karl-Anthony Towns wrote: \u201cSo let me get this straight: Flint, MI has dirty water still, but you worried about an interview about a man doing good for education and generations of kids in his hometown?\u201d Before entering politics, Trump frequently praised James and his own family tried to recruit him to the New York Knicks in 2010. But commenting on someone\u2019s intelligence, including his own, has long been a Trump trope. He has been criticized for complimenting North Korean leader Kim Jong Un (\u201csmart cookie\u201d) and Russian President Vladimir Putin (\u201cvery smart\u201d) and has been known to praise himself as \u201ca very stable genius.\u201d But he also uses \u201cstupid\u201d \u2014 or variations thereof \u2014 as a favored insult. He has used it to describe the FBI, the NFL, Democrats, the filibuster, the nation\u2019s immigration laws, journalists, trade policies and how the nation\u2019s leaders have dealt with topics like Iraq, Muslims, Canada and China. He also, after then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson reportedly called him a \u201cmoron,\u201d challenged his own Cabinet member to an IQ test. \u2013 Associated Press  writer Steve Reed in Charlotte, N.C., contributed to this report."},{"id":39101,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nba-africa-game-2018-recap","date":"2018-08-04","title":"Danilo Gallinari leads Team World past Team Africa in NBA Africa Game 2018","content":"Danilo Gallinari scored 23 points to lead Team World to a 96-92 win over Team Africa in the NBA Africa Game 2018 Saturday in Pretoria, South Africa.

It follows the 16th edition of Basketball Without Borders Africa \u2014 the NBA and FIBA\u2019s global basketball development and community outreach program. When the game tips off on ESPN2, three of the 19 players that will take the court are alumni of the Basketball Without Borders program (which began in 2001). Joel Embiid and Pascal Siakam of Team Africa and Danilo Gallinari of Team World represent the completed circle of a program that has helped expand the NBA into a truly international game. It is a game that is not only loved by fans worldwide, but one that kids around the world can aspire to play at the highest level. \u201cIt was great. Back in 2011, I was kind of shy. I wasn\u2019t as good because that was the year also when I started playing basketball,\u201d said Embiid on a conference call from the latest Basketball Without Borders Africa on Wednesday. \u201cJust being here, being around other guys that were obviously much better than me, it was tough. I was shy. By the end of the weekend, I felt comfortable. I had a great time. I ended up kind of showing my potential. I got a scholarship to come to the States. Other than that, I had a lot of fun with all the other guys. The coaches and everyone, they were all fun to be around.\u201d Embiid\u2019s journey from a BWB camper in 2011 to becoming the No. 3 overall pick in the 2014 NBA Draft is a remarkable one. Although foot injuries delayed his NBA debut for two seasons, Embiid showcased his phenomenal talen when he finally suited up for the Philadelphia 76ers for the 2016-17 season. However, a torn meniscus in his left knee limited him to just just 31 games that season.  He finished his rookie season with averaging 20.2 points. 7.8 rebounds, 2.1 assists and 2.5 blocks in just 25.4 minutes per game and was the runner up for the Kia Rookie of the Year award. After a healthy offseason to prepare for his sophomore campaign, the Sixers cautiously allowed Embiid to play more minutes (30.3) and more games (63). The result was Embiid averaging 22.9 points, 11.0 rebounds, 3.2 assists and 1.8 blocks per game while recording 38 double-doubles . Embiid, who was one of only six players to average at least 20 points and 10 rebounds last season as he finished the year ranked 12th in the league in scoring, tied for sixth in rebounding and fourth in blocks. Not only was he named to his first NBA All-Star team as a starter, he also earned All-NBA Second Team honors and was the runner-up to Rudy Gobert for the 2017-18 Kia Defensive Player of the Year award. Before he begins his third NBA season this fall, Embiid is back in Africa with Basketball Without Borders as he becomes one of the hundreds of current and former NBA and WNBA players that serve as mentors and inspiration for the young campers that hope to follow in their footsteps. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s fun for me. I think as long as God allows me, as long as my schedule allows me, that\u2019s something I want to do every year, just come back and give back,\u201d Embiid said. \u201cWhen I was in that situation, I felt great being among NBA players. I wanted to learn from them. I wanted to touch them because I was so amazed by them. \u201cI feel like me now being in this situation, I feel they also feel that way. I feel that\u2019s a way for me to kind of give back and show them how it\u2019s done. At the same time, it\u2019s also a way for me to grow the game of basketball in Africa. I feel like we have a lot of talent, undiscovered talent that can have a chance just like I did. They just need an opportunity. It\u2019s great. I enjoy. It\u2019s really fun for me being among the kids, being able to walk out with all the other NBA guys.\u201d  While Embiid\u2019s story may be worthy of a feature film or documentary some day, he is not the only Basketball Without Borders success story on display this weekend. Pascal Siakam, a fellow native of Cameroon, followed the path set by Embiid and laid out by another NBA player from Cameroon \u2013 the LA Clippers\u2019 Luc Mbah a Moute. It was at Mbah a Moute\u2019s camp that Embiid displayed the raw talent that earned him a spot at the Basketball Without Borders clinic. A year later, it was Siakam that participated in Mbah a Moute\u2019s camp and Basketball Without Borders Africa . Like Embiid, Siakam would emigrate to the United States as a teenager in pursuit of NBA dreams. After a year of high school and two seasons at New Mexico State, Siakam was selected by the Toronto Raptors with the 27th pick in the 2016 Draft. He posted modest stats (4.2 points and 3.4 rebounds in 15.6 minutes per game) in 55 games his rookie season before his stats jumped up last season. He finished his sophomore NBA campaign averaging 7.3 points, 4.5 rebounds and two assists in 20.7 minutes per game for the Eastern Conference-leading Raptors . He appeared in 10 playoffs games in 2018, averaging 6.6 points per game on 61 percent shooting in just under 18 minutes per game. While he has not risen to the superstar heights of Embiid after two seasons, Siakam has become a key rotation player on a playoff team with championship aspirations. And he\u2019s doing so just six years removed from being a camper in a Basketball Without Borders clinic on his native continent. Rounding out the field of Basketball Without Borders alums is Team World\u2019s Danilo Gallinari, who will play against Embiid and Siakam on Saturday. Gallinari, who plays for the LA Clippers, is the veteran of the bunch and is closing in on his 10th NBA season.  A native of Sant\u2019Angelo Lodigiano, Italy, Gallinari took part in the 2003 Basketball Without Borders Europe camp (alongside fellow future NBA players like Marc Gasol, Omri Casspi and Andrea Bargnani) before beginning his career as a professional player in Europe. Following four years of playing overseas \u2014 he was named the Italian League MVP and a EuroLeague Rising Star in 2008 \u2014 Gallinari entered the 2008 NBA Draft and went No. 6 overall to the New York Knicks. After playing his first two-and-a-half seasons in New York, Gallinari was traded to the Denver Nuggets as part of a blockbuster deal that sent Carmelo Anthony to New York. (There is a Basketball Without Borders tint to that move, too: then-Nuggets general manager Masai Ujiri was the one who dealt Anthony. Ujiri is now the director of Basketball Without Borders Africa and is the GM of the Raptors, overseeing Toronto\u2019s drafting of Siakam two years ago.) Gallinari would spend the next five seasons in Denver, where he averaged a career-best 19.5 points per game in 2015-16 . Following the 2016-17 season, Gallinari was traded to the LA Clippers, where he averaged 15.3 points and 4.8 rebounds as he was limited to just 21 games due to injury. Now recovered from the injuries that hampered him in his first season in LA, Gallinari is ready to take the court once again.

Aside from those moves, the Wizards more or less return the same crew from 2017-18 that went 43-39 and lost in the first round of the playoffs . Continuity for a team that finished as last season\u2019s group did might give some Wizards fans reason to think the 2018-19 edition may not fare much better than the last one did. Wizards owner Ted Leonsis, however, sees the potential for a much different outlook in the looming season. He who spoke yesterday after his Monumental Sports & Entertainment group announced a practice-facility naming-rights partnership with MedStar and said he thinks his team has addressed specific areas of concern. Candace Buckner of The Washington Post  has more from Leonsis : In Howard, the Wizards added a former All-Star center who remains a solid option in the post after he averaged 16.6 points, 12.5 blocks and 1.6 blocks per game with the Charlotte Hornets last season. However, this season will mark Howard\u2019s fourth team in as many seasons as he seeks yet another shot at redemption in the NBA . To Leonsis, the talk of the baggage Howard can bring to a team are not worth playing into, writes Buckner: Leonsis added that he thinks the Wizards can go \u201c10 to 11 players deep\u201d next season and is happy the team addressed the depth issues he thought hampered the team last season. By most measures, last season hardly went as the Wizards had hoped. They failed to defend their Southeast Division championship, finished eighth in the Eastern Conference (after a No. 4 finish in 2016-17) and lost in the first round of the playoffs (after narrowly falling in Game 7 of the 2017 East semifinals). A large part of that 2017-18 swoon could be attributed to the time All-Star guard John Wall missed after having knee surgery in January . While Washington did manage to go 15-12 during his absence, the Wizards had just seven games with Wall before the playoffs quickly began (and quickly ended) against the top-seeded Toronto Raptors. In a interview on the Wizards Tipoff podcast on NBCSportsWashington.com last month, Wall also praised the offseason moves the Wizards\u2019 made. \u201cAt the end of the year, you\u2019re kind of fall short because you\u2019re fatigued \u2014 and nobody uses that as an excuse, you play and you try to get in the best shape possible,\u201d Wall said. \u201cBut when you play 24 minutes of the whole [first] half and 24 minutes of whole other half, you kind of get tired at some point. I think those guys can take a little of the burden and pressure off us sometimes.\u201d"},{"id":39069,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/memphis-grizzlies-unveil-new-uniforms-fedex-jersey-sponsor","date":"2018-08-03","title":"Memphis Grizzlies unveil new uniforms with FedEx as jersey sponsor","content":" MEMPHIS, Tenn. \u2014 Simply redesigning uniforms wasn\u2019t enough for the Memphis Grizzlies. They seized the opportunity to change so much more. Everything from logos to color schemes to the way their court at FedExForum will have a new look this season , part of the team\u2019s most significant reimaging since 2004.  All that and the Grizzlies also added FedEx to the jersey as the team\u2019s corporate sponsor. The unveiling ceremonies Thursday night at FedExForum for the media and key fans even included a FedEx courier delivering packages containing the new jerseys. \u201cA month ago, we did this photo shoot (with the new uniforms), and I just loved them,\u201d said second-year forward Dillon Brooks, who along with guard Mike Conley, served as models in a video for the new uniforms. \u201cI even tried to put one in my bag and take it home. But obviously, it came out.\u201d As for Conley, often on the cutting edge of fashion, also gave the uniforms a nice review: \u201cMy professional opinion is I look great,\u201d he said drawing laughs from the crowd. * Grizzlies.com:  Photo gallery of new uniforms The uniforms are primarily darker blue and white, and the Grizzlies kept a baby blue known as Beale Street Blue \u201cstatement\u201d uniform in the mix. The team\u2019s grizzly bear logo adorns the side of the darker blue uniform shorts.  All of the uniforms have a blue collar representative of the team\u2019s grit-and-grind characteristics, a mentality the Grizzlies hope to resurrect this season. Among other changes were logo characteristics, including outlining the main grizzly bear head logo in \u201csteel gray\u201d to accentuate the fierceness in the bear\u2019s eyes. The team\u2019s claw ball emblem was rotated where the three middle claws around the ball now form an M for Memphis. The court now will feature planks going side-to-side rather than the length of the floor. \u201cWe\u2019re a city that cuts against the grain; we\u2019re going to have the only court in the NBA that cuts against the grain,\u201d said Jason Wexler, the Grizzlies president of business operations. \u201cEvery single court in the NBA runs goal to goal. We\u2019re going to run the opposite direction because that\u2019s what we do. Anytime we can make Memphis stand out, we make Memphis stand out.\u201d Adding a partnership with FedEx, headquartered in Memphis, seemed natural, said David J. Bronczek, president and COO of FedEx Corp. \u201cWhen you have the FedExForum and you have the Grizzlies, it just makes sense to have FedEx (on the uniform),\u201d Bronczek said."},{"id":39063,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/mavericks-get-center-chinanu-onuaku-trade-rockets","date":"2018-08-03","title":"Mavericks get center Chinanu Onuaku in trade with Rockets","content":"DALLAS \u2014 The Dallas Mavericks have acquired center Chinanu Onuaku from the Houston Rockets for the rights to forward Maarty Leunen.

Hopes of making a run at available superstars LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard and Paul George danced in the Sixers\u2019 heads, but in the end, those players either signed elsewhere (in the case of James and George) or were dealt elsewhere (Leonard). That said, the Sixers have high hopes for 2018-19 in large part because All-Star center Joel Embiid continues to trend upward in his progress. Last season, his production jumped to 22.9 points and 11 rebounds and 3.2 assists per game \u2014 all improvements from his rookie 2016-17 season \u2014 as Philadelphia reached the Eastern Conference semifinals . Embiid also finished second in voting for Kia Defensive Player of the Year and gave the Sixers further hope a championship run may happen in the near future. The Sixers\u2019 biggest offseason moves amounted to trading for Wilson Chandler and Mike Muscala and re-signing J.J. Redick. And while Leonard moved to the East-rival Toronto Raptors, Embiid isn\u2019t fretting what didn\u2019t happen for his squad on the transactions page. In a conference call interview with reports from NBA Africa 2018 , Embiid is focusing on taking his game and his team to new heights next season. Here\u2019s more from Michael Lee of Yahoo Sports : In the offseason, Embiid made a pitch of sorts to James via social media, writing: \u201c Trust The Process!!!! Find a new slant @KingJames. \u201d However, James\u2019 agent \u2014 and not James himself \u2014 met with the Sixers in Los Angeles to hear their pitch . In a recent interview with ESPN, James said he thought \u201clong and hard\u201d about joining the Sixers . To Embiid, losing out on James wasn\u2019t as big of a letdown as it may have been for Sixers fans. Overall, in the conference call with reports, Embiid sounds like the confident player he has always been \u2014 as well as one who is sure he can take his game to another level quickly. Embiid\u2019s superstar cohort, rookie guard Ben Simmons, was a regular triple-double threat and claimed Kia Rookie of the Year honors last season . To close out last season, the Sixers got hot at the right time, racking up 16 straight wins as they made quick work of the Miami Heat in the first round of the playoffs . However, the Sixers got outplayed by Boston in the playoffs \u2014 and last year\u2019s draft. It was a gut-punch for every Sixers fan who watched Jayson Tatum torch the Sixers while Fultz rode the bench. The Sixers, of course, swapped the No. 3 pick to Boston (who took Tatum) for the No. 1 pick (Fultz). It\u2019s too early to call a 19-year-old No. 1 pick a bust, but Fultz is certainly trending that way after a pitiful rookie year derailed by a mysterious shoulder injury, a broken shot and confidence issues. He played the first four games, missed 68 games because of injury, then was persona non grata in the postseason. Simmons-Embiid-Fultz were expected to form a trio of stars that would lead the Sixers to the top. Fultz\u2019s ignominious first year instead made him more of a mystery than when the Sixers selected him out of Washington. Entering the offseason, there were serious questions ahead about who will team with Embiid and Simmons to form a championship core \u2014 and plenty of room to grow for both franchise stars. \u201cIf we all sat in that room when we met back in September, and said we\u2019re going to finish third in the Eastern conference, we\u2019re going to lose in the semifinals of the Eastern Conference, there\u2019s a strong chance we all would have been hugging each other,\u201d coach Brett Brown said at season\u2019s end. \u201cThe initial goal was to make the playoffs. The final piece is, if we\u2019re going to do anything of any significance.\u201d The Sixers signed Brown to a three-year contract extension in the offseason , as Philadelphia has increased its win total by 42 games since the start of the 2015-16 season. That run that tied Boston (2006-08) for the largest turnaround within a three-year span in NBA history. However, the offseason wasn\u2019t all positives for the front office in Philadelphia. GM Bryan Colangelo resigned from his post in early June in the wake of what an investigation found was \u201dcareless and in some instances reckless\u201d sharing of sensitive team information. It was a stunning fall for Colangelo, a former two-time Executive of the Year who was expected to lead the improving 76ers into an important summer. Brown took over the team\u2019s basketball operations on an interim basis since then, although the 76ers said their search for a new general manager would begin immediately.

All thanks to that noble quality that the cynics like to say is dead. \u201cI remember these streets,\u201d James said during and after the dedication of the I Promise School , a new entry in the Akron Public Schools for some of the city\u2019s most disadvantaged students and their families. James\u2019 charitable entity, the LeBron James Family Foundation , conceived and built the school in conjunction with APS and a slew of private partners chipping in time, labor and ultimately millions of dollars as they strive for a new approach to urban education. The plan had been put in motion years ago, but the actual hands-on, physical transformation of the building came in the past seven weeks. The curriculum will focus on science, technology, engineering and math [STEM] but the school will go well beyond, providing \u201cwraparound services\u201d for the families that include career, academic and emotional support. An inaugural class of 240 third- and fourth-graders were on site for the first day of classes Monday, with the I Promise School to be populated from first to eighth grade by 2022. The academic year will run longer (July 30 to May 17) and so will the hours each day (9 a.m. to 5 p.m.) in an effort to thwart idle time that doesn\u2019t get filled productively and often leads to a \u201csummer slide\u201d in students\u2019 learning and progression. The school \u201cis everything I needed when I was growing up in Akron,\u201d James said. \u201cAny worry or hardship I ever had, the people and the programs built into this school would have helped.\u201d The front of the IPS off West Market St. was turned into a party, with bleachers, recorded and live musical perfomances, and the city\u2019s ubiquitous \u201cGoodyear\u201d blimp circling overhead. Older students who already were a part of James\u2019 I Promise program that has them working toward free tuition at the University of Akron made an appearance. Most of the recorded music was pitched to the youthful crowd. But when James and his mother Gloria raised the U.S. and IPS flags near the end of the ceremony, the Hall & Oates hit \u201cYou Make My Dreams\u201d boomed from the sound system. \u201cA lot of emotions,\u201d James said, sharing the moments as he drove through familiar streets to the school. No, he said, he hadn\u2019t needed directions. \u201cI used to walk this street. I used to walk North. I used to walk Silver Street right down the street. \u2026 I remember exactly when that McDonald\u2019s right there next door first opened. It was like a Disneyland for us as kids, having a McDonald\u2019s come and open up.\u201d With the kids on hand, in the middle of summer in a non-NBA city, the scene Monday was a dramatic update on, yet reminiscent of, that evening eight years ago in Connecticut. James, much younger and far less self-assured, sat across from announcer Jim Gray on national TV, fidgety and uncomfortable while the children of the Greenwich Boys & Girls Club provided an awkward backdrop on a clumsy night. The NBA superstar announced his stunning Decision then to leave the Cleveland Cavaliers to pursue championships with the Miami Heat, and the league \u2014 particularly the corner of it in northeast Ohio \u2014 went a little crazy. This time, his decision to again leave Cleveland already was three weeks old. This time, James\u2019 presence at the IPS celebration really was about the kids. And frankly, the reality that he soon will be playing his basketball for the Los Angeles Lakers seemed, OK, not quite trivial but way less important and hardly traumatic, weighed against the reason for Monday\u2019s gathering. This was, notably, the first opportunity for James to publicly discuss his decision to end his 2014 homecoming after four seasons and head to L.A. He had avoided interviews previously and did not participate in the Team USA minicamp in Las Vegas last week . So in a media session after the final bell Monday, James spoke first about this recent stint, helping the Cavs to four Finals appearances and the 2016 NBA title. \u201cI can sit here in two seconds and say it was a heckuva run, obviously,\u201d he said. \u201cMy first year when I came [back] here, I didn\u2019t believe we could even compete for a championship. And we took the Warriors to Game 6, losing our All-Star point guard [Kyrie Irving] and our All-Star power forward [Kevin Love] in the same playoff run. \u201cThen to come back the following year and winning, to break \u2026 the drought \u2014 the 50-plus year drought that this city had endured \u2014 and to add two more championship runs to it. It was more than we imagined.\u201d And now, in what he called \u201cthe next step in my journey?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s always tough to make a decision where you have to uproot, no matter if you\u2019re doing it by yourself or with your family,\u201d said James, who already owned two mansions in southern California, spending offseason time there in the past with his wife Savannah and their three children. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a bittersweet moment for myself because, on the one hand, you\u2019ve got the school, where I would love to be here every single day. Then on the other hand, I\u2019m starting a new journey in my life where I\u2019m on the other coast.\u201d As for choosing the Lakers, a proud franchise that hasn\u2019t made the playoffs since 2013 and finished 12 games under .500 last season, James said he did his \u201cdue diligence\u201d in comparing all they offered to other suitors including the Philadelphia 76ers, Houston Rockets and incumbent Cavs. His expectations for 2018-19? \u201cWe don\u2019t have any right now,\u201d James said. \u201cBut we definitely want to do better than we were the previous year. We want to have championship habits \u2014 that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re winning a championship, but it means we practice excellence every day. I expect that not only from myself but from my teammates. \u201cThat\u2019s what [team owner] Jeanie [Buss], that\u2019s what [team president] Magic [Johnson], that\u2019s what [general manager] Rob [Pelinka] would want,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what [coach] Luke [Walton] is gonna want, and we shouldn\u2019t sell ourselves short of that. There\u2019s gonna be months when we\u2019re really good. There\u2019s gonna be months when we\u2019re not so good.\u201d All of which paled to the hard times James recalled Monday, growing up on Moon Street on Akron\u2019s West Side while ostensibly attending Harris Elementary on North Hill miles away. \u201cMy mom didn\u2019t have a car, and we didn\u2019t have stability day to day, where I didn\u2019t know where I would be living,\u201d James said. \u201cSo there was no way I could even get there.\u201d As a fourth-grader, James \u2014 the only child of a single mother \u2014 missed 83 days of school. \u201cSchool didn\u2019t mean anything to me,\u201d he said. \u201cI just felt like every day I was waking up and I had a bunch of time of nothing. \u2026 There were a lot of empty days, empty nights. It was just kind of a \u2018no-future\u2019 thought process.\u201d James did have a strong group of friends who made up for siblings. He rode his bike throughout the city, developing another sense of loyalty to Akron\u2019s neighborhoods. In time, he had sports and specifically basketball, which wound up lifting him and those boyhood pals out of a possible dead-end existence. To see him now at age 33, polished and relaxed with a microphone on stage, is to see someone who has left all the childhood turmoil behind. But someone, too, who will never forget. \u201cFor kids \u2013 young kids, ages seven, eight, nine, 10 \u2013 the most important things we can give them is structure,\u201d James said. \u201cAnd a sense of \u2026 they just want someone to feel like \u2018We care.\u2019 They have the dreams, they have the aspirations, they have everything that they can actually get to in life, they just want to know that someone cares. \u201cI want these kids to know they still have the same opportunity as everyone else. So as adults, we have a responsibility to not let these kids down. \u201cAnd no matter if I \u2018m playing in Los Angeles or not, Akron, Ohio is always home for me. Always.\u201d A lot of cities, every four summers or so, hope and dream that James will decide to play basketball there. A lot more should wish he\u2019d been born and raised there. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

James, who this month ended his second stay with the Cleveland Cavaliers by signing with the Los Angeles Lakers, has opened a public school for challenged children in his hometown. The NBA great admitted to having \u201cjitters\u201d before the opening, an event he said is \u201cgoing to be one of the greatest moments \u2014 if not the greatest \u2014 of my life.\u201d The I Promise School initially will house 240 third- and fourth-graders.

James was at the school Monday to welcome students and make his first public comments since deciding to join the Lakers. James spent 11 seasons with the Cavs, winning a title in 2016 to end Cleveland\u2019s 52-year drought without a pro sports championship. His departure ended a four-year run with the Cavs after he returned in 2014 following four seasons with the Miami Heat. Following his eighth straight appearance in the NBA Finals, James said he was still in \u201cchampionship mode\u201d as he headed into free agency. But he\u2019s going to a Lakers team that missed the playoffs again last season and seems years away from competing for a title in the rugged Western Conference. James was also drawn to Los Angeles by the appeal of playing for one of the league\u2019s most storied programs and the chance to work with Hall of Famer Magic Johnson, the Lakers\u2019 president and a player James idolized since he was a kid. James also chose Los Angeles in part because it represents the next chapter in his life. He already owns homes there and he has a film production company in the city."},{"id":39126,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/dwyane-wade-still-mum-playing-16th-season","date":"2018-07-30","title":"Miami Heat's Dwyane Wade still not saying whether he'll play 16th season","content":" MIAMI (AP) \u2014 Dwyane Wade\u2019s future remains a mystery. The Miami Heat guard wouldn\u2019t say Monday if he has decided whether to play this season, which would be his 16th in the NBA. His future has been the source of much speculation for several weeks, with retirement a possibility. \u201dIn due time,\u201d Wade said. \u201dTime will tell.\u201d Wade briefly addressed the issue while on a call promoting his role as an ambassador for the upcoming Jr. NBA World Championship that starts Aug. 7 in Orlando, Florida. Wade has become heavily involved in youth basketball in recent years, primarily because of his sponsorship of an AAU team and his son Zaire\u2019s involvement on elite-level squads. \u201dThis is the purest form of basketball, to be able to be around kids at this age, before it becomes a business,\u201d Wade said. Heat President Pat Riley said last week the team will be patient while awaiting Wade\u2019s decision, with the hope of an answer by mid-August. Wade spent his first 13 seasons with Miami, then left for Chicago and eventually Cleveland before he was traded back to the Heat in February. Wade appeared in 26 regular-season and playoff games with Miami after the trade, all off the bench, averaging 12.9 points. He is averaging 22.5 points for his career, and was part of all three Heat championship teams in 2006, 2012 and 2013."},{"id":39122,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/morning-tip-kevin-love-signs-contract-extension-cleveland-cavaliers-impact","date":"2018-07-30","title":"Kevin Love stays put, takes on challenge of Cleveland Cavaliers' new era","content":" One last time, LeBron James will suck all the oxygen out of Northeast Ohio. As ever, but especially today, no one will begrudge him that distinction. James will be in Akron today to witness the grand opening of the I Promise School, a partnership created through his LeBron James Family Foundation and the Akron Public Schools to serve students in the city who have been academically challenged at other schools. It is another achievement of significance for James, who has already pledged to send thousands of Akron kids in the I Promise program to college through a deal with the University of Akron . And, as it is the first time James will speak publicly since signing with the Lakers at the beginning of the month , there will be some media present. Meanwhile, 40 miles or so up Interstate 77, the Cleveland Cavaliers will continue the renovation of Quicken Loans Arena , quietly, with no fanfare, the franchise again relegated to the digital back pages. But the Cavs had their own media availability last week. It wasn\u2019t exactly adding Chris Paul to the Houston Rockets and James Harden, but getting Kevin Love\u2019s signature on a reported four-year, $120 million extension that kicks in next summer was vital to the franchise. After 11 total seasons of James in town, the Cavs, finally, have to build a franchise without him. No one expects Love to carry the team to the heights James did. But having a five-time All-Star in Love to build around means they won\u2019t go through the floor again as they did after Decision 1.0 , when James went to the Miami Heat and the Cavs went through the floor. The less said about that 2010-11 Cavs team, which lost 26 straight games and wound up 19-63, the better \u2014 although their futility that season did land them Kyrie Irving in the 2011 Draft . Speaking of whom: 13 months ago \u2014 June, 2017, right after the Warriors beat the Cavaliers in five Finals games to take back the NBA championship \u2014 who would have thought that Love would be the last among James and Irving to be left standing in Cleveland? Love staying was a huge victory for General Manager Koby Altman, whose first minutes as GM last year after taking over for David Griffin were filled by the shocking news that Irving wanted out and demanded to be traded , rather than stay and potentially be the franchise\u2019s lynchpin if James departed. And Altman\u2019s entire first year at the helm was filled with the fallout from that demand \u2014 making a deal with Boston that brought Isaiah Thomas and Jae Crowder and Boston\u2019s unprotected first-round pick via the Brooklyn Nets to town, then jettisoning Thomas and Crowder at the trade deadline , neither fitting in any way with James and Love and the rest of the team. But Love had his own drama to deal with. He disclosed in a first-person Players Tribune story that he suffered panic attacks that forced him to leave the Cavs\u2019 bench during a game. And he had to face teammates during the season in a players-only meeting who accused him of tapping out and making up a story about being sick during a blowout loss to Oklahoma City in January. In that game, Love left after playing just three minutes and went home before the game ended. Yet Love, rather than demanding his own trade once James left for Los Angeles, or opting out of the final year of his deal and becoming an unrestricted free agent next summer \u2014 or, at least insisting the Cavs pay him a full-blown max in order to stick around \u2014 re-signed, quietly, and for less than full market value . It even surprised the Cavs. Love had to go full circle, from the third wheel who sacrificed much of his game to fit in with James and Irving, to deciding to be a leader for a rebuilding team. He\u2019d gotten hurt, most notably in his first season in Cleveland in 2014, separating his shoulder during that first-round playoff series with Boston . He watched James and Irving take the Cavs to The Finals without him. Nobody is going to lead a team with LeBron James on it other than James. But Love seemed to shrink even more than you\u2019d expect playing next to him. He put up numbers, but he wasn\u2019t engaged. Yet Love continued to grow on and off the floor, and by the time the Cavs got to The Finals in 2016, Love was able to play a significant role in Cleveland\u2019s Game 7 win at Golden State. He came back from a concussion to back up James with 20 points and 13 rebounds , getting a key stop on Stephen Curry in the game\u2019s final minutes. Still, after the players\u2019 meeting last January, Love certainly could have demanded to be relocated. He\u2019s still a very efficient player offensively, shooting 41.5 percent on 3-pointers last season and 88 percent from the line, and an elite rebounder. But, he didn\u2019t. He stuck it out. And, gradually, he\u2019s started to put his own imprint on the franchise. He invited teammates to his home for dinner for the first time last year. Veterans like Channing Frye and Richard Jefferson helped him immensely to come out of his shell, to be more of an alpha on the team, even with James still present. James came to respect the sacrifices Love had made, like playing center while Tristan Thompson was injured early on last season , to help the team. That didn\u2019t stop James from leaving, though. The Cavs immediately turned to Love to see if he would think about staying long-term. There had been rumblings around the league that Cleveland had been shopping him \u2014 which the Cavs strenuously deny. But Love became their major free-agent target, if you will, this summer. With or without Love, there was no chance Cavs owner Dan Gilbert was going to move Love for picks or young players, or let him walk in 2019, leaving Gilbert to revisit the empty buildings and horrific play he saw at Quicken Loans Arena from 2010-14, before James returned. Yet Love left a lot of potential money on the table in signing the extension with the Cavs. He could have gotten up to 35 percent of the cap as a 10-year vet next year, with a max deal to stay in Cleveland of five years and $221 million. Of course, the Cavs would have never given him that, but there\u2019s still a lot of room between $120 million and $221 million. He also left his last best chance at unrestricted free agency during his prime. At age 30 by next opening night, Love would have hit free agency next summer had he just played out the last year of his current deal, paying him $24 million next season. If he hadn\u2019t done the extension Love would have entered a free agent market in 2019 full of huge names, but also saturated with teams that will have cap room and will have to spend it. He probably wouldn\u2019t have been anyone\u2019s first call, but he would definitely have been among everyone\u2019s first two or three. He has his own story to tell and he was one of the few Cavaliers (besides James) who showed in The 2018 Finals against Golden State, averaging 19 points and 11.3 rebounds per game in the series . But Love short-circuited all talk of 2019 by quickly taking the security of four more seasons after next season. Not only that, but he took a deal with flat raises in the middle and which declines in the final year, from $31.2 million in 2021-22 to $28.9 million in 2022-23 \u2014 while extensions for other star players end in the mid-$40 millions. (That final year\u2019s salary for Love also dovetails nicely with a potential first year of an extension for Collin Sexton, the Cavs\u2019 first-round pick this year .) Many have pointed to Love\u2019s injury history as a primary factor in his decision, and maybe it was. But his history wouldn\u2019t have kept other teams from putting huge offers on the table for him next season. From Cleveland\u2019s standpoint, extending Love \u2014 especially at that number \u2014 makes all the sense in the world. If the Cavs had let Love get to free agency next summer, he mostly certainly would have bolted, leaving the Cavs basically with nothing to build around other than Sexton. The chances of Cleveland attracting free agents in that scenario would be bleak. Those chances still aren\u2019t great with Love; it\u2019s still damn cold in Cleveland in the winter \u2014 but they\u2019re a little better. Coach Tyronn Lue can build a credible offense around Love just as the Minnesota Timberwolves did in Love\u2019s first six NBA seasons, when the pickings around Love were much slimmer than they are for Cleveland now. Then, he had to count on the rapid emergence of a young Ricky Rubio and hope that Rick Adelman and Flip Saunders could find some more tread on the tires of Kevin Martin or Andrei Kirilenko. The Cavs found some hybrid ways to utilize Love on the floor with James and Irving over the years, getting him looks early in the game in the post, then trusting James or Irving to find him when open spotting up. Last season was more of a struggle with Irving gone. With James now gone as well, Lue will give Love a lot more touches. Despite Love\u2019s money on the books for the foreseeable future, the Cavs can clear significant cap room for 2019 quickly. Guard George Hill is only guaranteed $1 million of the $18 million on his contract for 2018-19 if waived before next July, and will be a prime trade candidate all year, moreso if another team suffers a serious injury to their starting point. Only $3.8 million of J.R. Smith\u2019s $15.6 million salary is guaranteed for 2019-20 if he\u2019s waived by the end of June next year. And Kyle Korver only has $3.4 million of his $7.5 million salary for \u201919-\u201920 guaranteed, though he\u2019d be more likely be kept around by a potential trade partner. At 37, Korver is still lethal behind the arc (44 percent last year for the Cavs) and keeps himself in incredible shape. The Wizards and 76ers, among many teams, have already tried to pry Korver from Cleveland . If Hill, Smith and Korver are each simply waived after next season before their 2019-20 salaries are fully guaranteed, that would only cost Cleveland $8.2 million total in dead money for 2019-20. (The Cavaliers could further reduce potential savings on each by using the stretch provision to waive any of the three, of which Smith would likely be the prime candidate. If Cleveland stretched Smith after this season it could spread the $3.8 million he\u2019s guaranteed over three years rather than absorb it all next summer, reducing his cap number to $1.26 million a year through 2021.) All these potential machinations would leave Cleveland in position to go after a max-level free agent in 2019 to pair with Love and Sexton. Failing that, the Cavs would at least be a potential repository for a bad contract, which almost always includes the carrot of a future first-round pick \u2014 and Cleveland\u2019s 2019 first just became more likely to go to Atlanta because of the Love signing. The pick is protected for the Cavs 1-10, and a bottom-10 finish was certainly in the cards had Cleveland traded Love this summer and just had Sexton. Love\u2019s presence next season increases the chances that the Cavs may just be garden variety bad rather than godawful, and that the Hawks will get the pick. But the Cavs have chosen to live with that. And Love has chosen to keep living with them. He will organize the team\u2019s minicamp in the fall, picking the location and what the players will do collectively after workouts together. His four years with James and three with Irving have impacted his own already-spartan workouts. He isn\u2019t the Kevin Love that came from Minnesota. He\u2019s still on the quiet side, but he\u2019s been part of some big winning in Cleveland the last four years \u2014 and there\u2019s no pressure on him to deliver that long-sought Cleveland championship. That\u2019s in the past, along with James. Love\u2019s deal doesn\u2019t preclude Cleveland from moving him, too, sometime down the line. But for the next couple of seasons, in a dilapidated East, a Kevin Love-led Cavaliers team can\u2019t be dismissed entirely as a potential playoff contender \u2014 no longer championship material, but a team worth putting on a coat and going to see on those cold Northern Ohio nights. * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

And each and every time Gregg Popovich did his best to answer it without any of the blazing sarcasm he reserves for in-game interviews he conducts with sideline reporters during San Antonio Spurs games. As the new coach of the U.S. Men\u2019s Senior National Team, Popovich has a clear understanding of the team\u2019s mission as the qualification for next summer\u2019s FIBA World Cup in China cranks up. Anything that went on during last week\u2019s two-day mini-camp in Las Vegas wasn\u2019t about any single individual. It was about the team and only the team, he insisted. If it required him saying it over and over again, so be it. The culture of the program and the nature of the competitions they are committed to continue dominating, Popovich said require that sort of laser focus from all involved. That goes not only for the staff at USA Basketball and the coaching staff, but also the 35 players on the National Team roster. \u201cI\u2019m here to coach the USA Basketball team and I have no interest in the NBA at this point, I\u2019ll worry about all that when I get back to San Antonio,\u201d Pop said when asked to assess the play of specific players who worked out during the camp in Las Vegas. \u201cRight now, this is a higher level. This is USA Basketball. And I want these guys to be thinking strictly about that when we\u2019re together and I have to be thinking about that as well. This group right here, making them a family and making them a team, that\u2019s what is important. It\u2019s not about any one player, it\u2019s about the entire group.\u201d What shape that group takes between now and next summer, and even beyond that to the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, is also not something Popovich felt comfortable discussing or even speculating about. The time between competitions makes it difficult to prepare with specific players in mind because so much can change in the course of the NBA season. Player availability for FIBA competition rests largely on who is available, and perhaps most important, who is healthy at that time. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to make any kinds of decisions on people and how it\u2019s going to go and who\u2019s going to want to go or not go,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cWe\u2019\u2019ll find out during the season. And I\u2019ll sit down with [USA Basketball Managing Director] Jerry Colangelo and [Senior Team Director] Sean Ford and some others who are going to be watching guys play all season long, invite a group and go from there. We won\u2019t worry about whose going to go to the Olympics or talk about the Olympics at all. All we care about is the World Cup in China. But we have to qualify first.\u201d Colangelo confirmed as much. He made it clear that attendance last week will not determine the fortunes of any particular player on the roster. Just 23 of the 35 players on the roster were full participants in the mini-camp. Notable players missing included LeBron James, Stephen Curry, Kawhi Leonard, Chris Paul and Draymond Green. Colangelo said they are still in the planning stages for next summer, working on every single detail, the way they always have since he took over the program in 2005. \u201cWe\u2019re working the schedule right now, in terms of how much time we\u2019re going to be here [Las Vegas] and we\u2019re going to play a couple of games before we take off for the Far East and I think we may be playing in Australia next summer,\u201d Colangelo said. \u201cThe point is, we need that time to make sure we have the young guys on the select team we\u2019ll have in the pipeline to get acclimated as well. That\u2019s the structure we\u2019ve always used and it\u2019s a good one, it works for our guys.\u201d They are relying on tried and true methods but they are not resting on the production that occurred under Popovic\u2019s successor; Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski coached the team to three straight gold medals since the London Olympics in 2012 and complete dominance on the world stage and five gold medals overall. But the past is just that, Colangelo said.  \u201cThis is today and we\u2019ve got to go forward,\u201d he said. \u201cThe five gold medals and all the success, the 88-1 run and all that, great. Wonderful. We established a mechanism and put the infrastructure in and made it hip again to be a part of USA Basketball and represent your country. But we still have work to do. No complacency. Zero. We\u2019ve got a lot of hard work ahead of us. Everyone wants to knock us off. \u201cBut that\u2019s the thing that works for our guys, who are all in the NBA. They are so darn competitive. They love being in the gym. And you can see it here and you can feel it here. Guys like Carmelo [Anthony] shows up here to check on these guys after all he\u2019s done for the program. They love it. It\u2019s a good situation to be in and I don\u2019t take it for granted. None of us do. And I\u2019m very appreciative of the guys wanting to be a part of this and committing themselves to this process, however it plays out for them individually. Not everyone would. But ultimately, it all goes back to the love of the game. And all of our guys have it in surplus.\u201d That and the elite consistency in the coaching ranks. It\u2019s no coincidence that an icon like Popovich replaced a fellow icon in Krzyzewski. Colangelo said they had never really met or had a the chance to get acquainted before Popovich was named as Krzyzewski\u2019s successor and visited with the team in camp before the Rio Olympics in 2016. \u201cThe transition from Coach K to Pop has been seamless,\u201d Colangelo said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got an iconic college coach, one of the most successful of all time. And you\u2019ve got a pro coach who is one of the best coaches of all time. And they never even knew each other. Isn\u2019t that amazing, that they\u2019d never really crossed paths before? But it gave them a chance to get together a little bit and get familiar with each other and our process and it\u2019s that sort of consistency that will help us as we dial in on our main focus, which as Pop told these guys, is on China next summer.\u201d Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

Our chains are forged! Their clanking may be heard on the plains of Boston! The war is inevitable; and let it come!  From Kevin Duong: That\u2019s a good question, Kevin. Thanks for writing. I\u2019m going with the former, though I recognize the latter could be a potential stumbling block for the Celtics. I do think a fully engaged Kawhi (as well as the forgotten guy in the deal, Danny Green) in Toronto can get the Raptors to a conference finals level next season. And with LeBron no longer around to torment them, the Raptors would finally be able to breathe a little psychologically no matter who they were playing. As for Boston, as I can\u2019t imagine coach Brad Stevens hasn\u2019t given weeks, if not months, of thought to that very topic, I will be on Boston being able to get both Irving and Hayward back into the mix with minimal difficulty. One can safely assume Hayward will go right back into the starting lineup for Aron Baynes, for example, giving Boston a ridiculous interchangeable forward combo of Hayward and Jayson Tatum, while also making them even deeper in reserve with Baynes joining Rozier, Marcus Smart and Marcus Morris. Boston was a +7.1 offensively when Irving was on the floor last year rather than off, and a cumulative +3.1 overall with him. I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to be a problem. I\u2019m from where they ball and breed rhyme stars\/I\u2019m from Marcy son, just thought I\u2019d remind y\u2019all.  From Stephen Milewski: I don\u2019t think so. Marks is his own man and his staff has its own tale to tell Leonard and his representatives. The Philadelphia 76ers, for example, had a good shot at Leonard in part because of Leonard\u2019s relationship with Sixers coach Brett Brown \u2014 a relationship that was formed while Brown was an assistant in San Antonio. Unless Marks rubbed Leonard the wrong way somehow in the 210, and there\u2019s absolutely no evidence I know of indicating that, I think Leonard will give the Nets a fair hearing next July. I mean, if Commissioner Gordon can dredge up Batman in just a few minutes \u2026 From Andy Sanchez: The short answer is, different commissioner. (Editor\u2019s note: There was no actual \u201cveto\u201d of the Paul trade because the trade to the Lakers was never agreed to in the first place.) But the circumstances are, and, were, in the case of the proposed CP3 trade , completely different. For one, Cousins was a free agent. That means he can sign with any team with whom he makes a deal. The Commissioner \u2014 in any sport \u2014 can\u2019t tell a player where he can or can\u2019t sign. For two, the NBA was, at the time of the proposed Paul deal, running the then-New Orleans Hornets, where Paul was playing. That meant David Stern was the de facto owner of the team. So he actually did have veto power over the decisions of the team ( hence the infamous \u201cbasketball reasons\u201d response to why he nixed the trade ). Send your questions, comments and \u2026 yes, while I know the main focus of this story for many will be \u201cwoman finds mountain lion sleeping on her couch,\u201d I am more intrigued by \u201cfeline-speak eye blinking\u201d and how one sends \u201ctelepathic routes out of the house via open doors.\u201d (I think I\u2019d like to party with Lauren.) to daldridgetnt@gmail.com .

But Miami president Pat Riley insisted last week that, contrary to word around the league for a while, the Heat isn\u2019t shopping its mercurial 29-year-old center, who has two years and $52.5 million (including a player option for 2019-20 at $27 million) on his contract. 1) A fair contract for Clint Capela and the Rockets . He wanted more money, which is understandable, given some of the deals that have been given to bigs in recent years that are more lucrative per year. But there was no point in gambling on a one-year qualifying offer and becoming an unrestricted free agent next year, even though there would have been a lot of teams lining up to make pitches. Injuries, team regression \u2014 any of a dozen things could have impacted his market in 12 months. Now the 24-year-old Capela and the Rockets can relax and make another run at the Warriors in the West. 2) That Allie Quigley, tho . 3) I\u2019m not crying; you\u2019re crying . 4) Don\u2019t mess with Tammy.

McCollum then responded on Twitter to a Twittee who reminded McCollum that he\u2019d criticized Durant\u2019s decision to go to the Warriors in 2016 . And Durant responded to McCollum\u2019s response to that response. And \u2026 \u201cThe guy brought a championship to the city. He brought some great years, won a lot of games. I don\u2019t know how you can hate him. Obviously, you are disappointed he wants to be somewhere else, but you\u2019ve still got to love that guy for what he\u2019s done for that city.\u201d \u2014 Raptors guard Danny Green , on his new podcast \u201cInside the Green Room\u201d , on his old\/new Toronto teammate Kawhi Leonard and the reaction of San Antonio fans to Leonard\u2019s decision to ask for a trade from the Spurs. \u201cI knew it was gonna be a weird market. I knew there was only a set amount of cap space, and if your incumbent team doesn\u2019t want to re-sign you or (is) not giving you a contract offer that you want, then you have to go out and get a contract offer. So in the back of my mind, I\u2019m thinking well if something happens where I can\u2019t go back to Philly, and the market dries up, what do you do? You go get the taxpayer mid-level from the Warriors, the Celtics, the team that gives you the best chance to win.\u201d \u2014 76ers guard J.J.

Now it seems, Anthony is closing in on the next step of his career. The Hawks have requested waivers on Anthony , which will allow the former All-Star to enter free agency. According to ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski, the Hawks and Anthony finalized their buyout agreement earlier today. Per various reports, the veteran forward is expected to sign with the Houston Rockets once he officially enters the free-agent player pool. Here\u2019s more from Wojnarowski on Anthony\u2019s buyout : The Oklahoma City Thunder dealt the former All-Star Anthony to the Hawks on July 25 in exchange for guard Dennis Schroder in a three-team deal also involving the Philadelphia 76ers. As part of the deal, the Hawks receive Anthony, Justin Anderson from the 76ers and a protected 2022 first-round pick from the Thunder. The Thunder also receive Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot from Philadelphia, while the Sixers receive Hawks big man Mike Muscala. Talk of the trade broke a few weeks ago , as Oklahoma City was working to move Anthony to save on its luxury tax bill for next season. The Hawks reportedly will buyout Anthony\u2019s contract, which will make him an unrestricted free agent if he clears waivers. Marc Stein of The New York Times reported on Monday that Anthony plans to sign with the Houston Rockets once he is officially a free agent. The 34-year-old Anthony had been the headliner his entire career \u2014 he\u2019s 19th in NBA history with 25,417 points \u2014 but he was more of a catch-and-shoot scorer last season instead of the isolation specialist he had always been. He averaged 16.2 points per game , but struggled at times in his new role. His playing time dwindled in the playoffs and he wasn\u2019t happy. In Game 6 of the first-round playoff series against the Utah Jazz that ended Oklahoma City\u2019s season , he played fewer minutes than backup Jerami Grant. After the season, he said he preferred to play with the ball in his hands more and said coming off the bench is \u201cout of the question.\u201d Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":39143,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/powerrankings-2018-19-summer-east","date":"2018-07-30","title":"Mid-Summer Power Rankings: Boston Celtics set to rule Eastern Conference for years","content":" Where does the departure of LeBron James leave the Eastern Conference?

He is a center in a small-ball, position-free NBA. He is an annoyance to some teammates, a pleasure to others. Whoever you are this morning, you surely have an opinion about Dwight Howard. Few NBA players remain as polarizing \u2014 even today, as the 32-year-old Howard takes his roadshow to its latest stop , Washington, with a 1+1 deal with the Wizards that\u2019s slightly less than the ones LeBron James and Kevin Durant have been signing the past few years. Howard\u2019s in D.C. for the mid-level, $5.3 million, having been jettisoned by Charlotte in a deal with Brooklyn , which had no intention of keeping him and only made the deal to get Timofey Mozgov\u2019s contract off its books. (The Nets acquired Howard on July 6 \u2026 and waived him on July 7, making him a free agent.) Thus, technically, Howard is on his fourth team in little more than a year, with the Atlanta Hawks having started the ball rolling by dealing him to the Hornets in June of 2017 . The Wizards aren\u2019t expecting miracles. They\u2019d just like a steady, two-way center who can improve both upon the output of their former incumbent, Marcin Gortat \u2014 traded to the Clippers in late June for Austin Rivers \u2014 and in his relationship with John Wall, with whom Gortat got crossways last season . As Wall is the bell cow around these parts, you must be right with him to move forward \u2014 and Wall apparently wanted Howard, DMing him after the buyout with Brooklyn was complete to recruit him to the Wizards \u2014 just as Howard was thinking about potentially seeing if there was a fit for him with the Golden State Warriors. \u201cOnce John hit me up,\u201d Howard said last week, \u201cit was like, nah, this is the spot. Not only did it feel right, but everything, from the point guard situation to the shooting guard, to the city. All of that. I\u2019m very intrigued by Washington, D.C., itself \u2026 on the court, man, it just makes total sense. On the court in Golden State would have looked great. And we could have won. But the impact of winning in Golden State and D.C. is totally different.\u201d Being right with people is something Howard seems to have struggled with in each of his last few stops. Famously, Kobe Bryant didn\u2019t click with Howard in Los Angeles . In Houston, Howard and James Harden never meshed , two non-verbal Alphas who were barely speaking to one another by the end of Howard\u2019s stay there. After Howard signed with Atlanta in 2016 , he and then-teammate Dennis Schroder argued on the floor. After Howard was traded to Charlotte, Schroder said Howard only played hard against his former teams . And my man and NBA TV colleague, Brendan Haywood, distilled discord between Howard and his teammates in Charlotte last season \u2014 according to sources Haywood spoke with after Howard was shipped to Brooklyn. (Haywood has since spoken with Howard, telling the D.C.-based sports website The Sports Capitol that he thinks things will be different with the Wizards \u201cbecause Dwight\u2019s going to want it to be different.\u201d So how did we get here? Howard blames a narrative, based on his jokey \u2014 and, some say, hokey \u2014 personality, one which was originally playful and fun-loving (remember when we all clamored for his Stan Van Gundy impression ? That was before their \u2026 uh \u2026 parting, which was highlighted by the most awkward shootaround I\u2019ve ever been at personally . That\u2019s me holding the TNT mic \u2026 we did the Magic\u2019s game that night). He believes the public\u2019s tiring of him is in direct correlation to his teams\u2019 won-loss records the last few years. \u201cIt\u2019s the nature of the NBA,\u201d Howard said. \u201cIt\u2019s a business. From a fan\u2019s perspective, they wouldn\u2019t understand what goes on in the locker room or the business side of it. They only know what\u2019s talked (about) to them or what they see on TV. So that\u2019s something that we can\u2019t really control, it\u2019s that type of narrative. The one thing I can do \u2026 is (give) them another view of who I am by being out in the community, by doing things that they can say \u2018hey, despite what they say about him in the news or on TV, I met this man. I spent time with him. He did this for our city. He did this for our community.\u2019 And that will go further than any lie that\u2019s always being said. \u201cI\u2019m from the country, and they always say, \u2018a lie don\u2019t care who tell it.\u2019 And a lie will get around a lot faster than the truth, \u2018cause a lot of people can\u2019t really handle the truth, and a lot of people hate what they don\u2019t understand.\u201d But \u2026 that doesn\u2019t explain all the antipathy, either \u2014 at least, not completely. Since leaving Orlando, Howard\u2019s teams have made the playoffs five out of six seasons, including the Western Conference finals in 2015 . Last season\u2019s 36-46 mark in Charlotte marked the first time Howard hadn\u2019t been in the postseason since 2007, his third season in the league. And Howard\u2019s terrestrial numbers have been consistent for almost a decade. He\u2019s never again reached his averages his last season in Orlando , when he put up 20.6 points per game and led the NBA with 14.5 rebounds per game . But despite the caravan of different teams, Howard\u2019s numbers have been rock-solid since 2012: he\u2019s averaged15.9 points and 12.1 rebounds, shooting 51.9 percent from the floor. He tied for eighth in the league last season at 1.6 blocks per game. He\u2019s also come back from the career-threatening back surgery he underwent in 2012 \u2014 the last three seasons, he\u2019s started 226 of a possible 246 games, or 91.9 percent. So \u2026 why? \u201cThat\u2019s the thing I don\u2019t understand,\u201d Howard said. \u201cBefore, it was \u2018numbers are everything.\u2019 So when the numbers are there it\u2019s \u2018well, they\u2019re not winning.\u2019 Which I understand. It\u2019s all about winning. But that\u2019s why all that stuff is behind me. I\u2019m healthy now. And I think this is the perfect situation to where, when we do win, then all of it\u2019s going to make sense \u2026 I know what I can provide for a team on and off the court, and I\u2019m looking forward to doing that here in D.C.\u201d  It\u2019s not like everyone hates playing with or coaching Howard. Hawks forward Kent Bazemore told ESPN in June that Howard\u2019s gotten a \u201cbad rap\u201d and that he was a \u201cgreat teammate\u201d in Atlanta . And his last coach, Steve Clifford, said by phone Sunday that the perception many currently have of Howard is an unfair one. \u201cI think that really, ever since he was young, which is the case with guys who are elite level players, they all take more responsibility when things don\u2019t go well,\u201d said Clifford, now the Magic\u2019s coach after being fired by Charlotte in April . \u201cA lot of times, because of his very nature, I think people have a misconception about how serious he is about being the best player he can be and playing his role as well as he can.\u201d Clifford, who was also on Van Gundy\u2019s staff in Orlando as an assistant while Howard was there, insists things weren\u2019t as bad with Howard in Charlotte as has been alleged. \u201cWhen you win, everything\u2019s fine,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then when you lose, I think that\u2019s where \u2014 I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s finger pointing \u2014 when you lose, there\u2019s disappointment. There\u2019s frustration. And, again, because he\u2019s an elite player and he\u2019s been an elite player, he takes more than his share of the criticism. We had no major issues. I would challenge anybody who watched the games to see conflict on the floor between him and the other guys.\u201d Howard was hardly the first star to force a trade out of town, as he infamously did in Orlando before being sent to the Lakers in 2012 . That took place as part of an equally infamous four-team, 12-player trade that, remarkably, didn\u2019t help any of the four teams involved \u2014 at least in the short term. They will do a \u201c30 For 30\u201d about this trade. Do you remember?  \u2022 Howard went to the Lakers, along with Earl Clark and Chris Duhon, with Orlando also sending Jason Richardson to the Philadelphia 76ers. \u2022 The Lakers traded Andrew Bynum to the 76ers, and sent Christian Eyenga, Josh McRoberts and a 2017 second-round pick (which became Wesley Iwundu) to the Magic. \u2022 Philadelphia traded Andre Iguodala to Denver, and sent Nikola Vucevic, Maurice Harkless and a 2017 first-round pick to Orlando. ( The Magic subsequently sent that 2017 first back to Philly , which ultimately traded it to Sacramento, who took De\u2019Aaron Fox with the fifth pick overall in \u201917 .) \u2022 Denver traded Arron Afflalo, Al Harrington, a 2013 second-round pick (which became Romero Osby) and a 2014 first-rounder to Orlando \u2014 which took Dario Saric in a pre-arranged trade with Philly and sent his right to the Sixers for the rights to Elfrid Payton. Yet Howard didn\u2019t finish his career with the Lakers ( this didn\u2019t age well ), nor the Rockets, nor the Hawks, nor the Hornets \u2014 which Twitter gleefully pointed out was his stated objective at each introductory news conference in those respective towns. Only Saric and Vucevic became meaningful contributors with the team that initially took them. Iguodala played well for the Nuggets in 2012-13 (13 ppg, 5.3 rpg, 5.4 apg), but landed in Golden State via a three-team, sign-and-trade deal in the summer of 2013. Since then, Iguodala has won a Finals MVP and three rings with the Warriors. Meanwhile, Howard is working out again this summer with trainers Justin Zormelo and Ed Downs, who he\u2019s worked with since 2016. If there\u2019s an ounce of fat within a city block of Howard, it better find him and apologize. He is as cut up as ever. \u201cWhen I first got with Ed, on the training side, my goal was to drop weight about 20 pounds, so I did that,\u201d Howard said. \u201cTo lean out, so I\u2019d be able to run, jump higher, be more explosive. You could tell from last season that I was able to do a lot of that stuff. And then on the basketball side, Justin, we started working together. I saw a big difference from the time. My game has been a lot different.\u201d He\u2019s added martial arts training and boxing the last couple of years as well. \u201cThe boxing was more so to lean me out,\u201d he says, \u201cand the martial arts was more to help me with quick twitch moves and stuff like that. But also being able to really help with hip movement.\u201d Howard faced up with the ball with some success in Orlando , but with Zormelo, he thinks he\u2019s gotten better in isolations over the last couple of years. \u201cInstead of just trying to back people down, or make a quick faceup move and spin, I was doing different types of moves,\u201d Howard says. \u201cBut also doing pick and pop. Handling the ball, bringing the ball up the court. Just different things that most people haven\u2019t seen from me. Which, in order for me to keep playing in this league at a high level, I had to bring those things out. Last year was moreso kind of like my rookie year, I would say, with the style of play. And I thought it worked out very well.\u201d Yet the Hornets moved on, quickly, leaving Howard to try and prove himself yet again with yet another team. Howard should be an upgrade over Gortat for the Wizards, but how big an upgrade he\u2019ll be is not certain. Gortat may be slowing down some at 34, but he still did a lot of good things on the floor and was a vital part of Washington\u2019s recent uptick to a playoff regular. He remained incredibly durable and started all 82 games for the third time in his last four seasons. In his five seasons in Washington, Gortat missed a total of eight games, showing up in 98 percent of the Wizards\u2019 regular season games. He was still elite last season in screen assists, finishing fourth in the league at 4.5 per game , per NBA.com\/Stats (though Howard was closely behind him, ranking sixth with 4.2 per game). Gortat\u2019s 21 charges drawn ranked second among NBA centers last season , trailing only DeMarcus Cousins.  But Gortat was getting attacked defensively with more frequency and effectiveness by opponents last season, getting Gortat to switch onto their guards and leaving him isolated. And in the Wizards\u2019 first-round playoff series loss to the Toronto Raptors , Jonas Valanciunas was effective in the paint against him. The Wizards, like everyone else in the league, opted for more small-ball lineups as the season went on. Gortat countered, with some justification, that Wall was leaving him on an island defensively by not fighting harder through screens and staying in front of his man. Offensively, the Wizards need Howard to help them resurrect their screen-and-roll game, which Wall and Gortat ran to great effect for years, but which fell off noticeably last season . With Wall out half of the season with injuries, Washington fell from 11th in the league in 2016-17 in screen-and-roll possessions with the ball handler finishing the possession \u2014 a total of 1,612, or 17.9 percent of all the Wizards\u2019 possessions that season \u2014 to 25th last season, at 1,298, or 14.6 percent (via NBA.com\/Stats) Howard was better in Charlotte with Kemba Walker than Gortat was in Washington with Wall as a roll man last season, but not good enough to help Clifford keep his job. \u201cBeing honest, his dynamic in the pick-and-roll with Kemba was fine, but not what we hoped it could have become,\u201d Clifford said. \u201cThat is, to me, the challenge. It\u2019s the roll game, getting a chemistry with not just John Wall, but the other guys, too. It was the same with us \u2014 not just Kemba, but Nic Batum and Jeremy Lamb. I don\u2019t know why (it wasn\u2019t better). \u201cDwight\u2019s a good screener. He has the ability to sprint to the rim for lobs. He has the ability to catch that one dribble pocket pass and get it to the corner, which he does. It wasn\u2019t that he and Kemba didn\u2019t play well together. It wasn\u2019t bad, nor was it was great.\u201d But even though Howard has diversified his game offensively, can a non-floor spreading big even stay on the floor these days? \u201cDefinitely, the game has changed,\u201d Wizards coach Scott Brooks said. \u201cBut a lot of times with that change, it still remains the same. You need a big. And when you have a talented big, you use him. A lot of teams, there\u2019s a little bit of growth going on with some of the younger bigs in the league \u2026 And (Howard) brings a skill set and a talent that, there\u2019s only a few guys in the league that can do. The challenge is going to be, how are you going to guard smaller guys?\u201d Howard guarded the paint fine for Charlotte, but the Hornets struggled to defend 3-pointers, finishing 27th in the league (37.5 percent allowed). By contrast, the Wizards were pretty good defending 3-pointers, tying with Indiana for fifth-best in the league at 34.9 percent allowed. If Washington can marry its perimeter D with improved paint defense, it could have something. But let\u2019s take this for what it is: a modern NBA marriage of convenience, between a playoff team in the East that can at least dream about breaking through now that LeBron James is with the Lakers, and a big man trying to remain relevant when men much smaller than he nonetheless play his position. One that still has the taste of losing The Finals on his home floor in 2009 in his mouth, and wants desperately to unfurl his Superman cape again. It\u2019s why he brought friends and family with him to D.C., including his father, and why he couldn\u2019t help himself during his introductory presser, talking about how he \u201clearned Magic for eight years, traveled to LaLa Land, learned how to work with Rockets, learned how to fly with some Hawks. Got stung by the Hornets. Through all of that, it\u2019s taught me how to be a Wizard.\u201d It was funny, in the moment. Most everyone in the room laughed. Most everyone who read it on Twitter opened both barrels on him. It\u2019s going to be that way for a while. The fall will give Dwight Howard another chance to show he still can help a team win without driving it crazy. He needs Wall as much as Wall needs him. \u201cHe\u2019s had a Hall of Fame career,\u201d Clifford said of his former center. \u201cIt\u2019s very important to him that he finishes this, no matter how many years he has left, to finish on a high note.\u201d * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

It was a decision he knew was coming for years and something he\u2019d pondered, long before he made his final decision.  The new face of the franchise said as much Sunday in a video on his own site, Uninterrupted. LeBron said playing for a franchise drenched in championship history, even though they haven\u2019t sniffed the postseason in years, was a situation he simply could not pass up at this stage of his career.  A \u201cdream come true,\u201d is the way he described the move in his first public words about his decision to leave the Cleveland Cavaliers and his native northeast Ohio for Los Angeles. Mike Trudell of Lakers.com provides some context :     This summer marked the third time in eight years James has changed teams. After bolting from Cleveland in 2010, he returned in an emotional homecoming four years later, determined to make the Cavs champions. The 33-year-old had previously said he wanted to finish his career in Ohio, and although he\u2019s leaving again, Cavs fans are more forgiving after he ended the city\u2019s 52-year sport title drought in 2016.  Shortly after the announcement, which came in a surprising manner, James posted a three-photo tribute to Cleveland fans on his Instagram account.  \u201dThank you Northeast Ohio for an incredible four seasons,\u201d James wrote. \u201dThis will always be home.\u201d  The decision to join the Lakers was not a surprise to his innermost circle, with one person telling The Associated Press that it had been presumed for some time that he was headed to Los Angeles next season.  James is coming off one of his greatest NBA seasons, playing in all 82 regular-season games for the Cavaliers while finishing third in the NBA with 27.5 points per game and hitting career highs with 8.6 rebounds and 9.1 assists. He then carried Cleveland to its fourth consecutive NBA Finals , where the Cavs were swept by Golden State. Last season, James had a league-high 2,251 total points scored and became the first player in NBA history to accumulate at least 30,000 career points, 8,000 rebounds and 8,000 assists. In addition, the 15-year NBA veteran currently holds the longest-ever double-digit scoring streak at 873 games. The Akron, Ohio, native has been named an NBA All-Star in each of the last 14 seasons, earning First Team All-NBA honors on 12 occasions, including the last 11 consecutive seasons. The 2003-04 Rookie of the Year is a five-time First Team All-Defensive Team member, a two-time Olympic Gold Medalist for Team USA (2008, \u201912) and the 2016-17 J. Walter Kennedy Citizenship Award winner. The Lakers have revamped their team around James by acquiring Rajon Rondo, JaVale McGee, Michael Beasley and Lance Stephenson in free agency while retaining guard Kentavious Caldwell-Pope. Los Angeles also assembled a reasonably talented young core before James\u2019 arrival with Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball, Kyle Kuzma and Josh Hart. His stay with the Cavaliers will best be remembered for 2016, when he rallied the Cavs from a 3-1 deficit in the finals to stun the Warriors. James helped seal a Game 7 win with a chase-down block of Andre Iguodala, the signature moment of a career that has shown no signs of decay. With the Lakers, James will be playing in the Western Conference for the first time and just down the Pacific Coast Highway from the Warriors, the team that has stymied him three times in the past four Finals. The chance to play for one of America\u2019s most storied franchises is a new challenge for James, who prides himself on knowing the game\u2019s history. In Los Angeles, championships are the standard and he\u2019ll feel new pressure in upholding the legacies of Johnson, Bryant, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Jerry West and other Lakers greats. It\u2019s now his turn.

The talent was always undeniable, it was the system that needed an overhaul. The human resources needed to stock USA Basketball\u2019s roster would certainly be the richest of any country on the planet, so long as the game continued to replenish itself the way it always has domestically. Absent now from the equation is the worry about binding commitments and buy-in from the game\u2019s best players. The trickle down effect from years of domination on the international stage \u2014 five straight major championships under former coach Mike Krzyzewski, a run that included 76 straight wins (53 official FIBA competitions and 23 exhibition games) \u2014 solidified Team USA as never before. It was a process bolstered by the emergence of a resurgent player pool that coincided with the rise of a so-called \u201cGolden Generation,\u201d headed by Kobe Bryant, LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, Dwyane Wade, Chris Paul and so many more of the game\u2019s biggest NBA stars. That\u2019s why Colangelo, the Managing Director of the program since 2005, beamed with pride at what he saw on the court at UNLV\u2019s Mendenhall Center over the course of National Team\u2019s two-day minicamp. The initial vision for the program feeding itself played out at one basket where decorated veterans Kevin Durant and Paul George were engaged in an intense one-on-one battles with All-Star Victor Oladipo and rising stars Devin Booker and Myles Turner, the two youngest members of the 35-man roster in attendance. It was an exhausting display by all involved, a tournament of sorts that kept everyone in the gym hanging around long after new coach Gregg Popovich had dismissed them for the day. \u201cIt\u2019s a blessing and an honor to be in the midst of this,\u201d said Booker, the youngster player here at 21. \u201cNot only learning from all of the players, but the coaches, too. These are the legends of the game. And to have an opportunity to play against these guys, to work with them and have them giving you pointers, to learn from the best of the best in an environment like this, it\u2019s an absolute blessing for me. And I\u2019m just trying to get better and better with every experience.\u201d Colangelo has seen the cycle play out time and again since rolling up his sleeves and going about the business of resurrecting the program after a string of embarrassing setbacks in the early 2000s. \u201cEach one, teach one\u201d was the mantra, younger stars learning from the standard set by the veterans. \u201cThe beauty of it is that so many of the guys here came up through our current system,\u201d Colangelo said. \u201cIt\u2019s a great pipeline. It gives the young guys the hope and anticipation that they can one day make the big team. So it\u2019s a good structure to work within for all of us.\u201d Absent from this summer\u2019s minicamp was the select team, a group of up-and-coming stars that worked out on their own during camp while also being used as a scrimmage opponent for the veteran crew. But Colangelo guaranteed the select team would make an appearance next summer in advance of the World Cup of Basketball in China. That team, even with all of the superstar talent that will be available, will be vetted the same way teams have been in the recent past. So what if it\u2019s unclear exactly who will join Booker and Turner in that next generation? Colangelo has no interest in tinkering too much with a system and process that has worked so well. Also absent from the process these days is the iron-clad commitments Colangelo demanded from players more than a decade ago; 23 of the members of the team were in attendance and participated in the drills and workouts while some of the biggest stars \u2014 LeBron James, Stephen Curry, Anthony Davis and others \u2014 were allowed some leeway. \u201cWe had to start somewhere,\u201d Colangelo said. \u201cAnd I needed those commitments when we launched. Once we got those commitments, it was important for us to show them that it was going to be special and the experience was going to be phenomenal. And very quickly it became a situation where guys wanted to be here. But yeah, that\u2019s exactly what the goal was. Put infrastructure in, make it operate like a machine and right now it\u2019s going pretty well.\u201d James Harden, the reigning Kia MVP and already a two-time gold medalist (London Olympics in 2012 and World Cup in 2014), is the embodiment of the program. From stints with the select team to his ascension as a key reserve in London to serving as one of the captains in Spain in 2014 to his continued rise as the leader of a Houston Rockets team earned the NBA\u2019s best record last season and finished its season in Game 7 of the Western Conference finals, he\u2019s seen the process all the way through. That\u2019s why, at 28, he can appreciate what Booker and Turner went through the past two days. He\u2019s also well aware of the youngsters who are on their way to the pipeline, players like Donovan Mitchell and Jayson Tatum who made huge impressions on playoff teams last season as rookies. \u201cWe know these young guys like Book and Myles and Donovan Mitchell and Tatum and Jaylen Brown are on the radar, that next wave that\u2019s ready to come along,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy. Guys are doing a great job of adapting and just playing, hooping, not caring who we play against or any of that other stuff, not caring what the name says or nothing. \u201cJust playing one-on-one and I\u2019m going to go out there and get you. And they\u2019ve done an unbelievable job, that next wave I mentioned, Donovan and Book and Tatum, they\u2019ve just got that \u2018it\u2019 you need to perform on this stage.\u201d Popovich, who admitted to using the two days here to build team camaraderie as much as anything, said the buy-in was even better than he expected. He enjoyed watching the way the players mixed in without hesitation and the way they competed while also developing the sort of bonds he knows will be necessary to grind through the next World Cup and Olympic cycle and beyond. He realizes that the sort of energy needed to continue the pipeline Colangelo spoke of comes from within, from the stars already in the system. \u201cThat\u2019s it exactly,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cA lot of these guys like Kevin and James and these other guys started out when they were really young. And they played in other championships dating back to before they were even in the NBA. And now they are the older guys. Jerry Colangelo has continued to feed that pipeline and the young guys want to be a part of it. \u201cThey see the success and the way these guys improve and how it carries over to every facet of their life and they want to be a part of it. That\u2019s what Jerry and (Men\u2019s National Team Director) Sean Ford have put together over the last 12 years for guys to want to be a part of the program. So there\u2019s no arm-twisting or anything like that. We just have to do the best we can now to continue that.\u201d Starting next summer in China, of course.

He did not need long to formulate his thoughts. \u201cNothing that happens in the NBA surprises me anymore,\u201d the league\u2019s MVP and Houston star said. Summer isn\u2019t over, but in the NBA spending sense, it\u2019s winding down. About $2 billion in deals have been made in the last four weeks, not to mention a few trades. But with the biggest names who were available in free agency staying put for the most part, most of the players who were in Las Vegas for the national team camp this week seemed to agree with Harden. Not much surprised them. \u201cThe league is definitely shaken-up a little bit, but that\u2019s how it is,\u201d Charlotte guard Kemba Walker said. That\u2019s the name of the game. That\u2019s the business. You\u2019re going to see guys go from team to team. \u2026 It\u2019s just forcing everyone to step their games up individually.\u201d Here\u2019s proof of that: Minicamp was officially over, most players had left to go resume their summers, and a few players \u2014 including Phoenix\u2019s Devin Booker and Oklahoma City\u2019s Paul George \u2014 were among the last on the floor working out. They were in a wild series of 1-on-1 games against the likes of Golden State\u2019s Kevin Durant, among others. Booker signed a $158-million extension earlier this month, George signed a deal to remain with the Thunder for $136 million. And there they were, trying to beat Durant, just like their teams will be trying to beat Durant\u2019s two-time defending champion team in a few months. \u201cFor the most part the players have kind of dictated the movement across the league,\u201d Booker said. \u201cI think it\u2019s great for the fans. I think it\u2019s great for the league both domestically and internationally. It\u2019s just a lot to follow and keep up with.\u201d Very few moves this summer involved a superstar-level player choosing to change teams. LeBron James left Cleveland for the Los Angeles Lakers and agreed to a new four-year contract, and the Warriors were able to add DeMarcus Cousins on a one-year, $5.3 million deal. Maybe that was part of the no-surprise factor. The term \u201cplayer movement\u201d was a bit of an oxymoron this summer. Players made moves, but most didn\u2019t involve moving \u2014 James\u2019 was the only free agent signing that exceeded $40 million in total value and involved a change to a new club. \u201cI think the DeMarcus Cousins thing surprised a lot of people,\u201d Memphis guard Mike Conley said. \u201cAt the end of the day, that is what it is. LeBron going to LA, Kevin Love staying in Cleveland, there was a bunch of big-time news. But I think everybody\u2019s gotten better and we just have to try to keep up with the way the league is going. Teams are loading up.\u201d That they are, especially out West, where the Warriors reign and yet will have challengers anyway. Houston lost some pieces, but was able to retain Chris Paul and Clint Capela to play with Harden. The Lakers have James, which changes their franchise immeasurably. San Antonio may have gotten better, in that it added DeMar DeRozan for an unhappy Kawhi Leonard. DeRozan knew Popovich was a fan of his game before last week\u2019s trade. \u201cHe always showed me mutual respect that I definitely appreciated,\u201d DeRozan said. \u201cThere have been times he\u2019s told me things on the sideline about my game, that he was a fan and to keep working. Just to see things to come full circle, for me be in this position, definitely cool.\u201d And in the East, things changed \u2014 in the sense that for the first time since 2010, James won\u2019t be on a team that wins the conference title. Boston and Philadelphia may be favored, but there will be no shortage of teams like Miami, Indiana and Toronto believing they have a better chance in the East now that James has moved West. \u201cIf it\u2019s a free-for-all, I\u2019m all for that,\u201d Heat President Pat Riley said Friday. \u201cBecause then I think the door\u2019s wide open for almost anybody to do something very good.\u201d Walker put it even more succinctly. \u201cEverybody has high hopes,\u201d he said. \u201cI know everybody\u2019s excited LeBron\u2019s out of the East. Don\u2019t have to play against him four times anymore.\u201d Isaiah Thomas did change uniforms this summer, signing a minimum deal with Denver \u2014 a step he hopes is a precursor to cashing in next summer if he can return to his elite-scoring form and prove that his problematic hip is no longer an issue. He thinks the buzz around the NBA this summer only made the league stronger. \u201cAll publicity is good for the league, but this was a crazy summer with LeBron going to the Lakers, Paul George staying in OKC, a lot of movement, DeMarcus going to Golden State, it was a lot going on,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cBut every now and then a summer needs to be like that for the NBA to keep going.\u201d"},{"id":39104,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-clint-capela-and-houston-rockets-reach-deal","date":"2018-07-27","title":"Houston Rockets reach deal with restricted free agent Clint Capela","content":"The Houston Rockets and restricted free agent Clint Capela have agreed to a deal, the team announced on Friday .

Once Dwight Howard\u2019s understudy, Capela\u2019s rapid rise eventually led to him replacing Howard as the Rockets\u2019 starting center and he became the ideal pick-and-roll partner for James Harden, who developed a spectacular chemistry with his 23-year-old big man. Capela\u2019s confidence in his fourth season has been off the charts, as he posted career highs in minutes (27.5), points (13.9), rebounds (10.8) and blocks (1.9).

What\u2019s unclear is this: How much they\u2019ll have to pay. Heat President Pat Riley said Friday that he will have talks with managing general partner Micky Arison in the coming days about Wade\u2019s future. Realistically, there\u2019s only two contract options for Miami to present Wade \u2013 the $5.3 million exception, or the $2.4 million veteran minimum. The potential luxury tax implications Miami could face next year would rise in either case, and that\u2019s what the Heat are trying to avoid. \u201dThat\u2019s the abyss that we all deal with in the NBA,\u201d Riley said. Riley said Miami has had talks with Wade and his agent Leon Rose over the summer, though no real detail about those conversations has been revealed by either side. Wade said at the end of last season that he wasn\u2019t certain about playing for a 16th NBA season in 2018-19, and hasn\u2019t offered anything in the way of an update since. He has been doing on-court workouts regularly in recent weeks, including a session Thursday in Las Vegas with LeBron James, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily indicate a decision about playing or not. \u201dI think it\u2019s best that we give him some more time,\u201d Riley said. Wade left Miami for Chicago in 2016, spent one season with the Bulls, began last season in Cleveland and then was traded back to the Heat in February. Wade appeared in 26 regular season and playoff games with Miami after the trade, all off the bench, averaging 12.9 points. For his career, the future Hall of Famer is averaging 22.5 points and he leads the Heat all-time lists in several statistical categories. \u201dI want him back as a player,\u201d Riley said. \u201dI want him back as a competitor. I want him back as a guy who wants to have the greatest year he ever had as a player. I read more articles about \u2018Dwyane being done, he\u2019s lost a step, he\u2019s not the same player, he might not have the same motivation.\u2019 But I still see a player who can contribute heavily if he really wants to.\u201d The same wait-and-see approach is being utilized with fellow Heat veteran Udonis Haslem, who also is weighing whether to return for a 16th season. Haslem has spent his entire career in Miami, and he and Wade are the only Heat players to be part of all three of the franchise\u2019s championship seasons. \u201dBoth players are being respected to the utmost because of their history with us,\u201d Riley said. \u201dI\u2019m sure they\u2019re sitting down thinking about what they want to do and how it\u2019s going to impact the rest of their lives. I do believe, and I hope, that by the middle of August that we\u2019ll probably have a decision on both players.\u201d In other matters Riley covered in a teleconference with reporters:"},{"id":39105,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-milwaukee-bucks-add-swingman-pat-connaughton","date":"2018-07-27","title":"Report: Milwaukee Bucks add swingman Pat Connaughton","content":" Wingman Pat Connaughton has agreed to a two-year deal with the Milwaukee Bucks, adding depth to the team\u2019s frontcourt, according to Yahoo!

He announced his intentions to re-sign with the Oklahoma City Thunder at teammate Russell Westbrook\u2019s swanky party in Oklahoma essentially on free agency\u2019s opening night. Before that, though, the future of the All-Star swingman \u2014 whom the Thunder acquired in a 2017 offseason trade \u2014 was a topic of discussion throughout the 2017-18 season. The Thunder (and their GM, Sam Presti) indeed took a risk in trading for George, knowing that he was a free agent this summer. George spoke at USA Basketball\u2019s mini-camp in Las Vegas yesterday about why he made a fast decision to stay where he was and why the Los Angeles Lakers \u2014 his hometown team \u2014 never even got a meeting with him to discuss free agency. As George explains, playing for the Thunder was one of the \u201cmost comfortable\u201d experiences he\u2019s had in his NBA life to date. ESPN\u2019s Marc J. Spears has more : His debut season was solid individually \u2014 George averaged 21.9 points, 5.7 rebounds, 3.3 assists and shot 40.1 percent from 3-point range last season \u2014 but the Thunder were knocked out in the first round of the playoffs by the upstart Utah Jazz. That playoff exit and OKC\u2019s failure to fulfill its status as a title contender in the Western Conference also drew George back to the Thunder, he said. George is a five-time All-Star who just turned 28. For his career between Indiana and Oklahoma City, he\u2019s averaged 18.6 points and 6.2 rebounds while connecting on 38 percent of his tries from 3-point range. Presti gambled a year ago by trading for George and Carmelo Anthony to join Westbrook in hopes of rejoining the NBA\u2019s elite, which did not happen. Anthony was recently traded to Atlanta as part of a three-team deal that netted the Thunder some more depth: Hawks point guard Dennis Schr\u00f6der. On Wednesday, George lauded that move, calling Schr\u00f6der \u201cthe best backup point guard in the league.\u201d After the Thunder\u2019s playoff loss, George has said he saw potential in Oklahoma City. He seemed to enjoy pairing with former Kia MVP winner Russell Westbrook and the Thunder went 40-22 in their final 62 games of the regular season and got the No. 4 seed in the Western Conference. \u201cI think we\u2019ve set the bar at what we could be,\u201d George said at the end of the season. \u201cObviously, it showed at times us just being together with our first year with the lapses and some of the losses that we\u2019ve got this year. But as a whole, I had an amazing year here.\u201d Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":39123,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blake-griffin-still-grinding-gold-medal-opportunity","date":"2018-07-27","title":"Blake Griffin still grinding for gold medal opportunity","content":" LAS VEGAS \u2014 Blake Griffin knows if things had gone according to plan, his plan, he\u2019d already have a gold medal or two in his trophy case. He\u2019s a five-time All-Star, a four-time All-NBA performer, the 2011 Kia Rookie of the Year and Slam Dunk Contest champion. He\u2019s been the foundation of a franchise, a top-flight pitchman and a global star who at one time was considered one of the future faces of the entire league.  But he never got his hands on that gold with the U.S. Men\u2019s Senior National Team. The same injuries that seemed to derail his NBA seasons so frequently with the LA Clippers seemed to do the same with Griffin\u2019s chances of making it to the Olympics or the World Cup of Basketball, where he could finally scratch that medal itch that has him here for the two-day practice with the rest of the stars on the National Team roster. He\u2019s no longer the young jumping jack who toiled here seven years ago with visions of the London Olympics in his head. He\u2019s 29 now, hardened by the trials and tribulations of the superstar driven but sometimes uncertain existence of an NBA veteran. The opportunities to play with the U-S-A across his chest thought to be plentiful a few years ago have been replaced by the reality that this process waits for no one, not even a superstar. \u201cIt\u2019s always a privilege to be here,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cI say it all the time, USA Basketball is just a different thing, a different atmosphere and a different type of respect. It\u2019s important, too. And I think guys who have played all the way through will tell you that. I\u2019ve been close a couple of times and barring injury, I probably would have been there. And it\u2019s still something I look forward to accomplishing.\u201d This is the one place where NBA superstars go to be humbled, the one process that separates the very best of the best from the rest in a given cycle. There are no guarantees, not even for the biggest stars. And therefore, managing this process forces all involved to recognize where they fit in the current landscape. Timing is everything. Being healthy and at your very best is crucial. And you have to make sure it\u2019s during a competition summer \u2014 the World Cup is in China in the summer of 2019 followed by the Tokyo Olympics in 2020. This current minicamp serves several purposes, the most important being an opportunity for the 35 players on the National Team roster to familiarize themselves even more with Gregg Popovich, the longtime coach of the San Antonio Spurs who is taking over as head coach of the team from Duke legend Mike Krzyzewski. But for stars like Griffin it serves as a bit of a wake-up call, or better yet a reminder. His international clock is ticking. And the depth of talent is so great that there are bound to be stars of his ilk who don\u2019t make the cut next summer or the summer after that. That depth of talent is what makes the U.S. program the world\u2019s best. \u201cThe pool is deep as you might expect,\u201d Popovich said, \u201cbut what\u2019s more impressive is people like Blake, people that no matter who they are, whether they are young guys or seasoned guys like him, they want to be here and they want to be a part of this. They understand it\u2019s a loftier goal than our NBA teams. This is above that. And he feels it, obviously, and that\u2019s why he\u2019s here.\u201d Griffin is also still managing the transition from his spot as one of the Clippers\u2019 franchise cornerstones to his new spot in the same role with the Detroit Pistons. Last year at this time, Griffin was riding high after re-signing for five-years and $173 million with the only team he\u2019d known since being drafted No. 1 overall in 2009. By January, he was the the centerpiece of a blockbuster trade that sent him to Michigan and the Eastern Conference . So he\u2019s a part of the shifting landscape that all of the stars here acknowledge as the most jarring part of the past few seasons. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be fun,\u201d Charlotte Hornets point guard Kemba Walker said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be crazy. We won\u2019t have to deal with [LeBron James] as often as we used to, which was always a monster, but things have shifted quite a bit the past few years. Guys are moving, things change constantly, and that forces everybody to stay on their toes because you just never know.\u201d Griffin agreed, both on the player movement aspect and the changes to the game in general. \u201cI mean, the league looks completely different,\u201d he said \u201cNot only the style but also where guys are now, it\u2019s just completely different. I think it\u2019s cool, man. The thing that\u2019s great about NBA basketball is guys change teams and the power in the league shifts a little bit \u2026 it\u2019s just always something exciting going on in basketball. Perhaps the best part for a veteran like Griffin is the absence of the extra attention. Kevin Durant drew the monster media crowd after Thursday\u2019s workout, with everyone curious what he had to say about his Twitter beef with Portland Trail Blazers guard C.J. McCollum (and he had plenty to say ). Paul George\u2019s first encounter with the assembled national media since choosing to stay in Oklahoma City over going home to the Los Angeles Lakers in free agency stirred up the frenzy you might expect. And DeMar DeRozan drew a throng of his own, just a week after being traded to the Spurs in that blockbuster deal that sent Kawhi Leonard to Toronto . Leonard, by the way, was one of several stars (LeBron James, Stephen Curry, Draymond Green, Anthony Davis, Chris Paul, Klay Thompson, McCollum, Bradley Beal, DeAndre Jordan, Jimmy Butler and Gordon Hayward were the others) excused from the minicamp for various reasons. The crowd that might have smothered Griffin years ago was reduced to a sparse but steady flow of folks checking in on the former \u201cLob City\u201d star. Some seeming surprised to see him, almost as if they\u2019d forgotten he was a part of the program. Griffin took it all in stride. He\u2019s confident in who and what he is at this stage of his career. He knows where he fits into the bigger picture, both in the league as well as with the star-studded group that makes up the Senior National Team. It\u2019s the reason he doesn\u2019t take this time for granted, why he doesn\u2019t hold back at all when he\u2019s among the league\u2019s truly elite at this event. \u201cUSA Basketball is different that any other basketball you can play. You ask anybody in here and they\u2019ll tell you the same thing,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cIt\u2019s just different, being here with all of these guys. I wouldn\u2019t trade it for anything. \u201cIt also goes to show the depth of talent in the NBA, just from the United States. There are guys who are at the top of their game who aren\u2019t even here. And you still look at this group and you figure you\u2019ll still be able to win a gold medal. So it\u2019s humbling to come to something like this and see all of these talented players. It keeps you working.\u201d * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

He was well-defended and not able to shoot or drive, so he fired a crosscourt diagonal pass to DeMar DeRozan. For years, that was a fine idea. This time, it became a turnover. They were on different teams during this particular scrimmage, which seems fitting. USA Basketball\u2019s first minicamp of this Olympic cycle started Thursday in Las Vegas, with DeRozan and Lowry \u2013 longtime teammates in Toronto \u2013 both wearing the same uniform again. DeRozan is now with the San Antonio Spurs and set to be coached by Gregg Popovich, who just happened to be running his first national team practice Thursday. DeRozan has made no secret: He wasn\u2019t happy getting traded out of Toronto. But if there\u2019s a consolation prize to be had, it\u2019s that he now gets Popovich. \u201dIt means everything,\u201d DeRozan said. \u201dI could have ended up in the middle of nowhere with Joe Blow. I ended up in a great place that wanted me that strives for greatness. You can\u2019t ask for nothing better than that.\u201d DeRozan was sent to the Spurs on July 18, along with center Jakob Poeltl and a protected 2019 first-round pick, for Kawhi Leonard and wing Danny Green. Leonard was one of the 35 players invited to attend this minicamp; he was one of roughly a dozen who didn\u2019t show, a list that also includes LeBron James, Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson. Popovich didn\u2019t seem bothered that there were no-shows. \u201dPeople have lives,\u201d Popovich said. \u201dWe had a good number of people here and the people who were invited that aren\u2019t here have reasons, whether it\u2019s injury or personal things going on in their lives. And we understand that.\u201d This two-day camp that ends Friday is little more than a get-to-know-you-better event for the players and Popovich. There are no games to play, and technically there aren\u2019t even future tournaments to prepare for \u2013 under the new qualifying rules, the U.S. isn\u2019t yet assured of having a spot in either the 2019 FIBA World Cup in China or the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. The task of making sure the Americans get to China next year has fallen to G League players, who are being coached by Jeff Van Gundy and went 5-1 in the first round of qualifying. The second round of qualifying starts in September. Popovich is taking over the national team reins from Mike Krzyzewski, the Duke coach who led the U.S. to Olympic gold in 2008, 2012 and 2016. Krzyzewski was in the gym to watch Thursday. \u201dHe\u2019s been great,\u201d Popovich said. \u201dI would be remiss if I didn\u2019t bug him to death, ask him millions of questions and try to learn from him.\u201d DeRozan got some 1-on-1 interaction with his new coach toward the end of practice. Popovich chatted with him for a couple of minutes, and then Houston guard Eric Gordon joined in and the three of them went over some post strategy for guards. It was consistent with the theme of the day for Popovich, who bounced around conversations all day long \u2013 harassing Russell Westbrook during a free throw, chatting with James Harden after one drill, then moving on for a word with Kevin Durant and finally heading over to where Kevin Love was sitting and feigning exasperation as they spoke. \u201dAll these guys have a different story, right? Just like all of you,\u201d Popovich said. \u201dWe all have families or kids or situations in life. It\u2019s fun to find out who they really are over and above basketball players. It helps me coach them. It makes them feel a bigger part of the program. And they know we\u2019re genuinely interested in them off the court.\u201d But as far as whether Popovich got a little something extra out of working with DeRozan, that was kept secret. Popovich wanted to keep his answers specific to USA Basketball, not the Spurs. \u201dThat was a good try,\u201d Popovich said to one reporter who asked about coaching DeRozan. DeRozan spoke plenty, though. There are many tough parts to him leaving Toronto, and not having Lowry at his side anymore will be one of the very hardest for him to deal with. They were inseparable at times together Thursday, even wrapping up their end-of-practice shooting at the same time before retiring to a row of chairs to get icepacks strapped to their legs. Lowry declined to talk Thursday, saying he would address reporters on Friday. DeRozan said some of his new teammates have reached out, and expects to talk to more Spurs in the coming weeks. \u201dI\u2019m easy, man. I\u2019m not difficult at all,\u201d DeRozan said. \u201dWhen it comes to basketball, if it\u2019s about winning, we\u2019re already on the same page and everything else will be easy. It\u2019s nothing complicated. I\u2019ve been in the league. I\u2019ve established myself, who I am. Everything else is simple.\u201d He seems like a perfect fit for the Spurs, or at least The Spurs Way. DeRozan is an outstanding player who has tended to let his game do the talking \u2013 an approach that Popovich and San Antonio standouts like Tim Duncan, Tony Parker, Manu Ginobili, even Leonard, seem to prefer as well. \u201dYou make me sound like I fit perfectly,\u201d DeRozan said. \u201dWithout a doubt.\u201d"},{"id":46839,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/kyrie-irving-insists-hell-be-ready-celtics-camp","date":"2018-07-27","title":"Kyrie Irving insists he'll be ready for Boston Celtics camp","content":" LAS VEGAS (AP) \u2014 Kyrie Irving isn\u2019t in a position where he could play with USA Basketball this week at its minicamp. He made the trip to Las Vegas anyway. The way Irving sees it, if USA Basketball calls, you answer. So he was in the gym Thursday for the start of the two-day camp, watching and interacting with guys but not partaking in the on-court action. And he insisted that when the Boston Celtics start training camp in about two months, he will be fully ready to go. \u201dEasily. Easily. Easily,\u201d Irving said. \u201dIt\u2019s just the summertime. This is probably one of the first summers in my last seven years where I\u2019ve actually had time to kind of develop and work on things that I want to improve on.\u201d Irving\u2019s first season with the Celtics ended in mid-March with a knee issue that required surgery . The Celtics went to the Eastern Conference finals even without him and Gordon Hayward (who missed all but the first five minutes of the season because of injury) anyway. In April, Irving had his surgery, which involved having two screws removed from his left patella after the Celtics revealed a bacterial infection was found at the site of the screws . Irving said yesterday that the infection that was found on the metal wiring and screws in his knee could have turned into a staph infection. However, the infection was caught and treated in enough time to avoid that outcome. \u201cI mean, you ask anybody with an infection, they will probably try to downplay it,\u201d Irving said when asked how scary the infection was. \u201cIt\u2019s a personal thing because your body is going through it. I was fighting an infection in a specific place in your body where you can\u2019t necessarily reach with your hands. You got to go in there and kind of see what\u2019s going on, and what happened for me was, the metal wiring and the screws that I had in there, the infection was on that, so I had to remove that and then be on antibiotics for about two months. \u201cIt could have evolved to staph, but good thing we caught it early. I am glad that is done. That was a long, long f\u2014ing two months.\u201d Given that LeBron James is now out of the East \u2014 he signed with the Los Angeles Lakers, meaning his eight-year run of being on the team that wins the East is ending \u2014 Boston figures to be a popular pick to reach the NBA Finals next season. \u201dAt the end of the day, we\u2019re going to be battling anyway,\u201d Irving said. \u201dWe haven\u2019t started. Everyone\u2019s 0-0 right now. The expectations, the power rankings, all that other good stuff that the media loves doing, it\u2019s all part of the game. Obviously there\u2019s some expectations that we have to meet individually and then as a group.\u201d Irving was the third-leading scorer for the U.S. at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics, starting all eight games and averaging 11.4 points.

On Thursday, the NBA announced the rosters for the 32 teams of 13- and 14-year old boys and girls that will compete from Aug. 7-12 at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex near Orlando, Fla. From the day the event was first announced back in December, through the regional competitions during the spring and summer, and culminating in the championship tournament in August, NBA and WNBA players and legends have been involved every step of the way. It began with Dwyane Wade and Candace Parker helping announce the first-ever event as Jr. NBA World Championship global ambassadors. The two All-Stars are both parents to young children and understand the importance of competition and the life lessons that can be learned though the Jr. NBA\u2019s core values of teamwork, respect, determination and community. It continued at various regional competitions across the U.S., which featured life skills sessions led by players such as Brooklyn\u2019s Spencer Dinwiddie and former NBA and WNBA players including Cherokee Parks, Sam Perkins, Derrick Coleman, Tamika Catchings and Alvin Williams with the goal of educating the youth both on and off the court. When the 317 boys and girls from 35 countries arrive in Florida next month for the Jr. NBA World Championship, they will be joined NBA All-Stars and legends such as Wade, Andre Drummond, Vince Carter, Brook Lopez and Grant Hill as well as WNBA legends including Catchings, Swin Cash and Jennifer Azzi.  The NBA and WNBA talent will not only be heavily involved with the events leading up to the competition, some will be directly involved once the games tip off. Lopez, who lives in Orlando during the NBA offseason, visited India for the Jr. NBA World Championship India regional in May, and has invited the boys and girls teams representing India to his home in Orlando for lunch prior to the start of the Jr. NBA World Championship. Drummond and Azzi will welcome all the teams at the tip-off ceremony on Aug. 5 and then participate in the celebratory parade at Magic Kingdom Park. Magic forward Jonathan Isaac will meet the 13- and 14-year-olds at a health and wellness session through the Gatorade Sports Science Institute, where Gatorade will help educate the participants on hydration measures and provide custom fueling recommendations for each athlete. The NBA and WNBA players will also be part of the life skills sessions that are part of the event\u2019s Developing the Total Athlete Series as well as the Jr. NBA World Championship Day of Service, where the group will collectively build a new playground for community youth at the nearby Oak Street Park. However, the connections between the NBA and WNBA and the Jr. NBA World Championships are not limited to off-the-court activities. This WNBA season, the Phoenix Mercury and Dallas Wings have met three times with Diana Taurasi\u2019s Mercury winning the season series 2-1 over Skylar Diggins-Smith\u2019s Wings. While these two teams may meet again in the WNBA Playoffs, the youth team each is affiliated with will meet at the Jr. NBA World Championship. Taurasi\u2019s youth team \u2013 the California Storm \u2013 qualified for the tournament and will compete as the West Regional\u2019s girls team. The Storm is coached by George Quintero, who coached the WNBA\u2019s all-time leading scorer when she was growing up in Chino, Calif. Diggins-Smith\u2019s youth team \u2013 Sky Diggs Soldiers \u2013 qualified as the Midwest Regional girls team and are coached by Skylar\u2019s stepfather Moe Smith. Over the past four years, LeBron James and Draymond Green have met in the NBA Finals, with Green\u2019s Golden State Warriors holding a 3-1 lead in championships over LeBron\u2019s Cleveland Cavaliers. With James moving to the Los Angeles Lakers this offseason, a fifth straight Finals meeting will not happen, but that doesn\u2019t stop these two players from being intertwined. During the Midwest Regionals, the team that Green played for while growing up in Saginaw, Mich. (The Family) knocked off LeBron James Jr.\u2019s team (North Coast Blue Chips) in order to represent as Midwest boys team at the Jr. NBA World Championship. And if that wasn\u2019t enough, a standout player from The Family, Ty Rodgers, is the nephew of Jason Richardson, who played the majority of his NBA career with Golden State and, like Green, played at Michigan State University. In addition to Green\u2019s The Family, NBA free agent Shelvin Mack\u2019s AAU Team \u2013 TSF Mack 2022 \u2013 qualified as the Southeast Region boys team.

Talk of Anthony and the Thunder looking to part ways after one season together had been bandied about for nearly a month before the move was officially consummated. Now comes the next step for Anthony, which more than likely involve the former All-Star being bought out by Atlanta and him entering the free-agent market. Once there, he is expected to sign with the title-contending Houston Rockets . For Anthony, though, this offseason process of transactions has been an eye-opening one of sorts. ESPN\u2019s Jemele Hill spoke with Anthony yesterday about the move and what lies ahead in his career: The Thunder made a big splash last summer when they acquired Paul George from the Indiana Pacers via trade and then traded to get Anthony from the New York Knicks months later. However, Anthony never quite meshed in Oklahoma City with George and former Kia MVP Russell Westbrook. The 34-year-old Anthony had been the headliner his entire career \u2013 he\u2019s 19th in NBA history with 25,417 points \u2013 but he was more of a catch-and-shoot scorer last season instead of the isolation specialist he had always been. He averaged 16.2 points per game, but struggled at times in his new role. His playing time dwindled in the playoffs and he wasn\u2019t happy. In Game 6 of the first-round playoff series against Utah that ended Oklahoma City\u2019s season, he played fewer minutes than his backup, Grant. ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski and Royce Young reported in early July that the Thunder were looking to trade Anthony to help trim their overall salary cap and luxury tax situations . Hill reports that Anthony and his representatives worked with the Thunder to find a solution, which resulted in the trade to Atlanta. In looking back on his 2017-18 season with OKC, Anthony simply feels things did not work out how anyone expected. While no deal has been reached yet with the Rockets and Anthony is still technically on the Hawks, the potential of playing for a team that was one win from The Finals is an enticing one for Anthony.

I think it\u2019s gonna make his book even more interesting when it\u2019s done.\u201d Durant also touched on the arrival of DeMarcus Cousins , one of the key free-agent moves of the summer and a shocking one for the majority of the NBA world. \u201cI was so excited because I knew how important this time was for DeMarcus, to find a team (and) find somebody that\u2019s going to help him get through this injury first and then play his best basketball,\u201d Durant said. Durant told Spears he received calls (which he ignored) while he was at the movies and when he got done at the movies, Durant found out the deal was done. He spoke with Cousins on FaceTime and called Warriors GM Bob Myers as well. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be perfect for both spots. For him and for us.\u201d Durant said he wasn\u2019t bothered by those upset about the move and knew that complaints about it would come. \u201cIt was expected. Nobody likes a great thing. Greatness is rare, it\u2019s different and people don\u2019t like different and I get it. I liked his approach and I liked our approach to it, just come in and wanting it to be about basketball.

Marc Stein of The New York Times reported on Monday that Anthony plans to sign with the Houston Rockets once he is officially a free agent.

Muscala, also drafted by Atlanta in 2013, brings size and shooting to Philadelphia. The 6-foot-11 forward\/center averaged 7.6 points and 4.3 rebounds in 20.0 minutes and shot 37.1 percent from 3-point range last season.

Steve Aschburner :  There\u2019s no wrong answer here, no matter whom we choose from the current 35-man Team USA roster. The trick is trying to anticipate the little dramas, surprise decisions and potential injuries that might crop up between now and the summer of 2020. That\u2019s so unknowable at the moment that I\u2019m just going to with these five: LeBron James, Kevin Durant and Anthony Davis up front, Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson in the backcourt . If LeBron at age 35 feels he already has done his Olympic duty, swap in Paul George. Everybody else? Second unit, without any slight intended. Tas Melas :  I\u2019m going with Stephen Curry, Kawhi Leonard, Kevin Durant, LeBron James and Anthony Davis.  Shaun Powell :  Is LeBron James definitely playing two years from now when he\u2019ll be pushing 36? If so, LeBron\u2019s a lock along with Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, James Harden and Anthony Davis. If not, replace Bron with Kawhi Leonard. The USA may have a shot. John Schuhmann :  I\u2019m assuming LeBron James, at the age of 35 (and who won\u2019t be at camp this week), won\u2019t play. I\u2019m also assuming that it will be tough for veterans from the Boston Celtics and Golden State Warriors to commit to a 2020 training camp in early July (because the Olympics begin on a relatively-early date of July 25) after playing in The Finals. Having covered the construction of seven rosters under Mike Krzyzewski, I\u2019ll be curious to see if the criteria changes when this one is put together and if any players from the last two Drafts (Donovan Mitchell and\/or Jayson Tatum?) get added to the current pool. But here\u2019s a preliminary guess: James Harden, Russell Westbrook, Paul George, Tatum and Anthony Davis. Sekou Smith :  By 2020 our own version of the \u201cGolden Generation\u201d should be fully stocked and ready to represent. The guys who helped resuscitate the program (LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, Chris Paul and Carmelo Anthony) will have all bowed of the process. Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, Anthony Davis, James Harden and Russell Westbrook will have moved into the five prime positions on the team that represents the United States in Tokyo. I could see LeBron sticking around to play the Kobe Bryant in 2012 role, which would mean someone comes off the bench as the sixth man. But nothing will interrupt the gold medal chase for this group. Go ahead and book that spot on the podium now."},{"id":39169,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-offseason-acquisition-did-not-get-lot-attention-2018","date":"2018-07-25","title":"Blogtable: Under-the-radar offseason move that could pay off next season?","content":" * * * An offseason acquisition that didn\u2019t get a whole lot of attention that could pay off big next season?  * * * David Aldridge :  Didn\u2019t seem like Tyreke Evans to Indy got a lot of ink nationally. He could really help the Pacers as a secondary option to Victor Oladipo down the stretch of games. In the middle three games of that first-round series with Cleveland, Oladipo went just 12 of 50 from the floor; some of those were just misses, but the Cavs trapped him a bunch too, getting the ball out of his hands. That would be less impactful with a guy like Evans on the floor with Oladipo. Indy had a really good offseason. Steve Aschburner :  Pretty much any acquisition made by the Indiana Pacers, ever, doesn\u2019t get a lot of attention. But Tyreke Evans should really help that team with his ability to create offense and lighten the load on Victor Oladipo. Considering how willing the Pacers were to flip the keys last season to Lance Stephenson in search of a second offensive threat, Evans represents a definite upgrade in reliability and in scoring prowess. The Grizzlies even helped out Indiana by not running up Evans\u2019 mileage last season, sitting him often when he actually was healthy and able to play. Tas Melas :  Nerlens Noel, Oklahoma City Thunder. On his own, I\u2019m not sure how much Noel would have provided. But pair him with the pending acquisition of Dennis Schroder \u2014 a talented point guard who can excel in the pick-and-roll \u2014 and you\u2019ve got a motivated Noel who can wreak havoc on offense and as a defensive center. This is especially true when considering he\u2019ll be playing against second units. This 24-year-old is teetering on the edge of NBA obscurity after turning down a reported four-year, $70 million offer from the Mavs last summer and is now playing for his basketball career. I think we\u2019ll see some of the peak Noel we saw in Philly when he was working the P-and-R with Ish Smith. Shaun Powell :  I suspect Tyreke Evans will be a very welcome secondary scoring option for the Pacers. He had a comeback year with the Grizzlies (19 points per game) and finally looked durable and healthy after being dogged the previous three seasons with various physical issues. After Victor Oladipo, the Pacers sometimes struggled to find a consistent shotgun runner last season. Now, you wonder: Is it Bojan Bogdanovic, Myles Turner or Tyreke? My money\u2019s on the newbie. John Schuhmann :  Given the Timberwolves\u2019 issues with depth, defense and 3-point shooting, Anthony Tolliver could be a very valuable addition. Minnesota lost Nemanja Bjelica at that position, but Tolliver is both a quicker defender and a more aggressive shooter ( 7.5 3-point attempts per 36 minutes vs. Bjelica\u2019s 4.8 last season ). The improvement of Karl-Anthony Towns and Andrew Wiggins is more critical in regard to the Wolves\u2019 playoff chances in a tougher Western Conference, but a versatile (and complementary) big like Tolliver could make a difference.  Sekou Smith :  The Nuggets went down the final night of the regular season battling for a playoff spot, coming up short on the road against the Minnesota Timberwolves. But that was before Isaiah Thomas showed up in Denver with that chip on his shoulder. Now that Nuggets coach Mike Malone has his old X-factor back from their days in Sacramento (okay, they weren\u2019t exactly in the playoff hunt \u2026 but roll with me here), it\u2019s time to unleash IT again the way the Celtics did before it all came to an abrupt end. For the Nuggets to sign Thomas to that one-year deal is all the fire Thomas needs to fuel him this season. He can be a devastating scoring option at his best. And the Nuggets could use that wrinkle with Will Barton moving into the starting lineup."},{"id":39171,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-what-role-best-suits-carmelo-anthony-if-he-lands-houston-rockets","date":"2018-07-25","title":"Blogtable: What role best suits Carmelo Anthony if he is on Houston Rockets?","content":" * * * Your nameplate says Mike D\u2019Antoni, 2017 NBA Coach of the Year. So tell us Mr. D\u2019Antoni, if Carmelo Anthony were to join your squad , what role does he play to give your team its best chance to win it all?  * * * David Aldridge :  An enhanced Ryan Anderson role. Anderson has been the starter at the four for the Rockets most of the last two seasons, though that was reduced significantly last year. With Trevor Ariza and Luc Mbah a Moute gone, Houston is in flux at the forward positions and likely to take a step back defensively. If that\u2019s the case, starting \u2018Melo at the four is a reasonable counter; strengthen the team\u2019s strength, which is scoring. If this has been in the works as long as it seems it\u2019s been, D\u2019Antoni knows that there\u2019s not much difference defensively between Anthony and Anderson; neither is a shutdown guy. So, which guy would be better suited temperamentally to come off the bench? The guess here is Anderson. So start \u2018Melo, give him some midpost touches\/catch and shoot threes with James Harden and Chris Paul creating open looks for him, bring Anderson and James Ennis off the bench and hope for the best. Steve Aschburner : I\u2019d say to Carmelo, \u201cDo you remember that role you filled for Team USA, when you were both highly effective and highly praised as a teammate for your willingness to defer to the accomplishments and reputations of the others? Do you remember how well things went for everyone when you came off the bench with a green light to score? That\u2019s how you we want to use you \u2014 as our sixth man \u2014 because that\u2019s the best thing for us (frankly, it\u2019s the only way you\u2019ll actually help us) and it\u2019s the best thing at this point in your career for you.\u201d Then I\u2019d wait to find out if Anthony really, truly wants to slog through the 2018-19 season for $2.4 million. Tas Melas :  You think the Rockets iso\u2019d a lot last year? Mike D\u2019Antoni showed he\u2019s fine letting guys show their skills one-on-one because his coaching style is to adapt to the strengths of his team. A starting unit with Chris Paul, James Harden, and Carmelo Anthony will look for their own plenty. In a perfect world, Melo is the team\u2019s first-and third-quarter sniper, allowing Harden to save more of his energy for the fourth quarter, where he didn\u2019t execute in the postseason, and to also save Chris Paul\u2019s aging legs. Let\u2019s call \u2018Melo \u201cThe Ziploc Bag\u201d because he keeps James Harden fresh (everything is rosy, perfect and hasn\u2019t failed in the summer). The other end is the bigger issue and I wonder how many games \u2018Melo will close out. I\u2019d guess D\u2019Antoni relies more on Harden and CP3 late and goes with more of a defensive-type \u2014 maybe James Ennis \u2013 in Melo\u2019s place. Shaun Powell :  Carmelo has only played one role in his basketball life and we\u2019re not sure he can do that at a high degree anymore. Also, consider that he largely failed in OKC when paired with a ball-dominating guard, and guess what? In Houston he has another ball-dominating guard! As a secondary option, \u2018Melo\u2019s ego and fading skills can\u2019t cope. Until last season, he has never not been \u201cthe guy\u201d since age 10 and we saw what happened when asked to adjust. The hope for D\u2019Antoni \u2014 who didn\u2019t get along with \u2018Melo in New York \u2014 is Chris Paul . He is close friends with \u2018Melo, can rewire \u2018Melo and get him to accept being No. 3 without allowing that to infect his energy and outlook. John Schuhmann :  Whether he starts or not isn\u2019t too important. He\u2019s probably not a part of my most used or most dependable lineup. When we need a defensive stop, he\u2019s not on the floor. He\u2019s a play finisher and not a playmaker or a ball-stopper , fourth on the team \u2014 behind James Harden, Chris Paul and Eric Gordon \u2014 in regard to creation. The percentage of his jump shots that are catch-and-shoot jumpers and the percentage of his jump shots that are 3-point attempts don\u2019t need to be at Trevor Ariza levels (79 percent and a league-high 98 percent, respectively), but they need to be much higher than they were for Anthony last season (53 percent and 49 percent).

This is what you can do for us in Houston. You can be the spark that lights our flame off the bench, the guy who proves to be the final piece to our championship puzzle playing exactly the way you did in London. It\u2019s still in you.

In return, the Raptors dealt All-Star guard and franchise icon DeMar DeRozan (along with center Jakob Poletl and a future first-round pick) to the Spurs. The move sent shockwaves throughout the NBA \u2014 in part because San Antonio had finally pulled off the trade and also because Toronto had dealt the player most associated with their recent run of success. It was, if nothing else, a bold move by Raptors GM Masai Ujiri as the team is betting it can sway Leonard to stay with the team long term after the 2018-19 season. For DeRozan, the Raptors\u2019 all-time leader in points scored, games played and more, the trade was something of a shock. Seven days after the deal took place, DeRozan is still trying to make sense of the move. He had some pointed thoughts about what happened leading up to the trade, as well as about Ujiri\u2019s dealings with him about trade discussions. In an interview with ESPN\u2019s Chris Haynes, DeRozan opened up about a conversation he and Ujiri had at NBA Summer League \u2014 one in which DeRozan says he was told he wouldn\u2019t be dealt. Here\u2019s more from Haynes : https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v Last Friday, Ujiri addressed the media about the trade and said he knew he was taking a risk by dealing DeRozan for Leonard. At the same time, Ujiri said he felt a move was necessary to try and move the Raptors up in the Eastern Conference hierarchy . \u201cOn paper we feel we have a team that can compete in the East and hopefully to compete for a championship in this league. That\u2019s why we play sports, is to compete for championships,\u201d Ujiri said. \u201cWe have been doing this for how many years? You can\u2019t keep doing the same thing over and over. \u201cAt this point, we got to the level where this opportunity came to us, and we had to jump on it.\u201d As word of the trade circulated the NBA social media atmosphere on Wednesday, DeRozan took to Instagram and posted a story there that read: \u201cBe told one thing & the outcome another. Ain\u2019t no loyalty in this game. Sell you out for a quick bit of nothing \u2026 Soon you\u2019ll understand \u2026 Don\u2019t disturb.\u201d * Aldridge:  Trade seems to please neither player Ujiri on last Friday said he will do \u201canything in his power\u201d to honor DeRozan in the future. In his conversation with Haynes, DeRozan says he made a decision early on to stick with the Raptors as long as they\u2019d have him. As for the move to the Spurs, DeRozan tells ESPN that he\u2019s still in \u201cshock\u201d about the trade. However, reuniting with former Raptors teammate Rudy Gay in San Antonio may help with DeRozan\u2019s adjustment period to a new squad. DeRozan had spent his entire career with the Raptors (2010-18), emerging as one of the top guards in the Eastern Conference. Since making his first of his four career All-Star berths in 2013-14, DeRozan has averaged 23.4 points, 4.5 rebounds and 4.2 assists per game in that span. He was named to the All-NBA second team this season and was All-NBA third team in 2016-17. Last season, he averaged 23.4 ppg while improving a key facet of his game by hitting a career-high 89 3-pointers . He has three years and and $83 million left on his contract, including an Early Termination Option for the 2020-21 season. The Raptors went through a series of changes in the offseason after they were swept in the Eastern Conference semifnials by the Cleveland Cavaliers. Coach Dwane Casey \u2014 the NBA\u2019s Coach of the Year \u2014 was fired days after that playoff exit and was eventually replaced by Raptors assistant coach Nick Nurse . As the Raptors and DeRozan face new paths in the 2018-19 season, the former Toronto star says he is driven anew to succeed while also cherishing the memories he has from playing in Canada.

ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski and Brian Windhorst and Cleveland.com\u2019s Joe Vardon report the Cavs have signed Kevin Love to a four-year, $120 million extension. The team officially announced the move on Tuesday afternoon as Love signed the contract at Quicken Loans Arena in front of Cavs front-office officials and construction crews working on renovating the arena. \u201cWe are very excited to announce Kevin\u2019s long-term commitment to the Cavaliers and Cleveland. This quickly became a partnership the second we began these discussions. Collaboration and winning matter greatly to Kevin and that was reflected in this extension,\u201d Cavs GM Koby Altman said. \u201cKevin\u2019s talent and character are both at a very high level and he has earned his role at the center of what we want to do moving forward. As a five-time All-Star and NBA Champion, Kevin has a special understanding of exactly what success and winning require.\u201d \u201cWhen I first came to Cleveland, I came with a long-term mindset,\u201d Love said. \u201cI came here to win. We developed a culture here that reflects that. I\u2019m super excited and I couldn\u2019t be happier. It\u2019s a big commitment for me and it\u2019s a big commitment from the Cavaliers, so I want to thank Dan Gilbert, Koby Altman and the entire organization. I enjoy playing here, I\u2019m excited about the team that we have and look forward to our future together. Cleveland fans have been special from day one and I\u2019m also looking forward to continuing to be a part of this great community.\u201d Wojnarowski reports Love opted out of the 2019-20 season on his current deal and will earn $24.1 million next season before this new extension kicks in . Love turns 30 in September and had one season and a player option for 2019-20 on his current deal. He averaged 17.6 points and 9.3 rebounds per game for the Cavs last season and was an All-Star for the second straight season as well. He missed that game, however, because of a broken bone in his hand. He has been mentioned in trade speculation since arriving in Cleveland, but the 6-foot-10 big man with a guard\u2019s shooting range now becomes the centerpiece of the franchise. The Cavs originally acquired Love in 2014 in a trade with the Minnesota Timberwolves on Aug. 23, 2014 for Andrew Wiggins \u2014 whom Cleveland took with the No. 1 overall Draft pick that year. The Cavaliers watched LeBron James depart the franchise in free agency this summer to sign with the Los Angeles Lakers . The Cavs have been in four consecutive NBA Finals, but were swept in 2018 by the rival Golden State Warriors . Wojnarowski reports that in the aftermath of that transaction, the Cavs aggressively pushed to secure Love to a long-term deal. Altman and team owner Dan Gilbert have been determined to keep the Cavs in the Eastern Conference playoff mix, and doing so would require keeping Love in the fold long term. Love appeared in 59 games for Cleveland last season, shooting .415 from beyond the arc and a career-high .880 from the foul line. Love was one of just four NBA players \u2014 Karl-Anthony Towns, Nikola Jokic and DeMarcus Cousins were the others \u2014 to make at least 100 3-pointers while averaging at least nine rebounds in 2017-18. Over the last four seasons, Love has played in 271 games and averaged a double-double (17.1 ppg, 10 rpg) during that span. Since the 2014-15 season, he leads the team in total rebounds (2,705), double-doubles (145) and 3-pointers (584). In Cavaliers history, Love already ranks fourth in 3-pointers made, 10th in defensive rebounds (2,165) and 12th in total rebounds. He has also helped the Cavs reach the postseason in all four years, including their run to the NBA title in 2016 . Last season, Love revealed he has battled anxiety throughout his life.

News about what NBA team the Miami Heat guard and future Hall of Famer will suit up for next season has been scant. Of late, the biggest news surrounding Wade has come in the form of talk of a potential offer from a team in China . On Tuesday, that talk changed a bit as the site Sportando reported (via Twitter) that the Zhejiang Golden Bulls have offered Wade a \u201cmonster\u201d three-year, $25 million deal to play in China . Ira Winderman of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel points out that this \u201cmonster\u201d offer Wade received truly isn\u2019t that big when compared to the payday the Heat guard was seeking just two summers ago. A variety of former NBA players have suited up for the Zhejiang Golden Bulls over the years, including Eddy Curry, Jarnell Stokes, Mike James, J.R. Smith, Kirk Snyder, Ivan Johnson and others. The Heat have been relatively quiet in free agency this summer, re-signing guard Wayne Ellington and swingman Derrick Jones Jr.  Per Winderman, the Heat have three open roster spots for 2018-19, enough to accommodate Wade, Udonis Haslem and another player. In mid-June, Wade said he wanted stay with the Heat if he did end up playing in his 16th NBA season. Last season, Wade averaged 16.3 points on 44.3 percent shooting in the Heat\u2019s first-round playoff elimination by the Philadelphia 76ers , scoring 28 points in Game 2 and 25 in Game 4. Shortly after being traded to the Heat, Wade told ESPN in an interview that he wanted to be with the Heat \u2018forever\u2019 and that he did not want a Kobe Bryant-like farewell season . It was an encouraging finish individually, after Wade had averaged 12.0 points with 40.9 percent accuracy in the 21 games he played after being dealt from Cleveland at the February trade deadline ."},{"id":39175,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/dwight-howard-happy-chance-prove-self-washington-wizards","date":"2018-07-24","title":"Dwight Howard grateful for new opportunity to prove himself with Washington Wizards","content":"The last few seasons have been nomadic for former All-Star center Dwight Howard. By signing with the Washington Wizards this summer (after he was traded by the Charlotte Hornets to the Brooklyn Nets and then waived), Howard will suit up for his fifth team in seven seasons once 2018-19 begins. Through it all, Howard has tried to keep his trademark sense of humor about him and delivered an epic line about his career in his introductory news conference yesterday: \u201cI learned Magic for eight years. Traveled to La La Land. Learned how to work with Rockets. And then I went and learned how to fly with some Hawks. Got stung by the Hornets. Just a joke. But through all of that, it\u2019s taught me how to be a Wizard.\u201d In all seriousness, though, Howard is embracing another fresh start with the hopes he can turn around perceptions about his career by playin alongside Wizards All-Star guards John Wall and Bradley Beal. Candace Buckner of The Washington Post has more on Howard\u2019s signing and his outlook on his future : Last season, Howard ranked third in the NBA in rebounds per game (12.5), fourth in double-doubles (53), ninth in blocks (1.6) and 11th in field-goal percentage (55.5 percent). Howard\u2019s most impressive game of the 2017-18 season came on March 21 (ironically enough, vs. Brooklyn), when he finished with 32 points and a career-high 30 rebounds in a comeback win against the Nets. However, Howard struggled to mesh with Charlotte\u2019s guards, and the Hornets failed to make the playoffs despite what former coach Steve Clifford considered the team\u2019s most talented roster in half a decade. After spending the first eight seasons of his career in Orlando, Howard has played for the Los Angeles Lakers (2012-13), the Houston Rockets (2013-16), the Hawks (2016-17) and the Hornets (2017-18) since then."},{"id":46825,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-kawhi-leonard-will-not-attend-usab-minicamp","date":"2018-07-24","title":"Report: Kawhi Leonard, Danny Green pass physicals; Leonard to miss USAB minicamp","content":" Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green have reportedly completed the final step needed in their trade to the Toronto Raptors.

The Lakers announced their signing of Beasley to a one-year contract Monday, adding the versatile forward to their new core of veterans around LeBron James. Beasley, Rajon Rondo, Lance Stephenson and JaVale McGee have all joined Los Angeles this month in a slate of provocative offseason signings to supplement its talented youngsters and James, who started the parade to the West Coast when he left Cleveland for the 16-time NBA champions in free agency. All four of these well-known, well-traveled veterans around James have varying degrees of colorful histories in their previous NBA stops, prompting widespread speculation in the media and around the league about how coach Luke Walton will manage his roster. They\u2019ve already attracted an immediate online nickname \u2013 \u201cThe Meme Team\u201d \u2013 while other pundits have compared them to a basketball Suicide Squad, referring to the recent DC Comics film about a misfit team of antiheroes. Beasley thinks the entire discussion is summertime NBA nonsense. \u201cFor there to even be a narrative (about problems with) personalities in this room is judgment enough for me, and I just don\u2019t want to be a part of it,\u201d Beasley said. Heading into his 11th NBA season with his seventh franchise, Beasley knows something about locker room chemistry and the importance of professionalism. He was James\u2019 teammate with the Miami Heat during the 2013-14 season, when they reached the NBA Finals, and he already has friendships with Rondo, Stephenson and McGee. Beasley hasn\u2019t become the superstar many expected when he was the No. 2 pick by Miami in the 2008 draft, but he has fashioned a solid NBA career. He said he couldn\u2019t have lasted this long in the league if he didn\u2019t get along with his teammates, listen to coaches and work toward team goals \u2013 and he feels the same about Rondo, Stephenson and McGee, who have all had enduring careers. \u201cAnybody (who) starts judging a lot of players, me mainly, doesn\u2019t figure out that guys like me and Nick Young and J.R. Smith and Lance Stephenson and guys like that actually know how to play basketball, actually know how to win basketball games and actually know how to get along with others,\u201d Beasley said. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing to do with my maturity. It\u2019s the total opposite.\u201d Beasley demonstrated that mature mentality when asked about his expectations and goals with the Lakers, who will have to put in plenty of preseason work figuring out how to play with each other. \u201cI\u2019m not really here to beat anybody out of minutes, or play more than this guy,\u201d Beasley said. \u201cI\u2019m here to play a team game and do as much winning as I can.\u201d Beasley averaged 13.2 points, 5.6 rebounds and 1.7 assists per game last year in a productive season with the New York Knicks, his sixth NBA franchise in 10 years in the league. Beasley\u2019s 6-foot-9 ranginess and versatility fit the stated desire of Lakers president of basketball operations Magic Johnson for multi-positional, ball-handling veterans eager to play hard-nosed defense, rather than the role players and pure perimeter shooters who occupied much of the Cavaliers\u2019 roster in recent years. Even getting a phone call from Johnson was a thrill for Beasley, who idolizes the former Lakers point guard. \u201cI mean, showtime. That\u2019s Magic, you know?\u201d Beasley said. \u201cA guy I dreamed of meeting my whole life. So the chance to play for him, it\u2019s surreal. \u2026 I was trying to keep my emotions professional, (but) I had to put the phone on mute once or twice.\u201d Johnson provided Beasley with a detailed description of his likely role with the Lakers. Beasley also is willing to be a vocal leader to the Lakers\u2019 gifted young players, including Brandon Ingram, Kyle Kuzma, Lonzo Ball and Josh Hart. \u201cI think they\u2019re all special in their own way,\u201d Beasley said. \u201cI think Josh Hart, Ingram, Kuz, Ball, I think they can all at some point in their careers be All-Stars and be leaders of their team. I think Luke did a great job with those guys, especially in the second half of the season, getting those guys to play and getting those guys to buy into what he believes in. \u2026 I feel like they can be anything they want to be.\u201d"},{"id":39196,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-dakari-johnson-move-again","date":"2018-07-23","title":"Report: Orlando Magic trades Dakari Johnson to Memphis for Jarell Martin","content":"Dakari Johnson, who was traded from Oklahoma City to Orlando last week, is on the move again, according to ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski .

The 17-year NBA veteran ranks sixth in NBA history in playoff games played at 226 (second among active players: LeBron James, 239) and ranks fifth in NBA Playoffs history in total assists with 1,143 (second among active players: LeBron James: 1,687). Parker was a member of four NBA Championship teams in San Antonio (2003, 2005, 2007, 2014) and was named the 2007 NBA Finals Most Valuable Player. Parker joins the Hornets as one of only four players in NBA history to total 4,000 or more points and 1,000 or more assists in the postseason (Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant and LeBron James). Parker has enjoyed a decorated international career. He played in the 2012 and 2016 Olympics for Team France and won a 2013 FIBA Eurobasket Gold Medal alongside fellow Charlotte teammate Nicolas Batum."},{"id":39205,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-dirk-nowitzki-expected-sign-contract-dallas-mavericks","date":"2018-07-23","title":"Dirk Nowitzki re-signs with Dallas Mavericks for 21st season","content":" Dirk Nowitzki has signed up for a 21st season with the Dallas Mavericks, the only team he has known, the team announced on Monday.

Last Monday afternoon, Masai Ujiri was in Nyang\u2019oma Kogelo, a small town (population 3,648) on the western edge of Kenya, spending some quiet moments with the 44th President of the United States. The basketball executive and the former Chief Executive were both there to help open a vocational center and sports and training facility that Barack Obama\u2019s half sister, Auma Obama, will run through her foundation, Sauti Kuu . Obama went on to South Africa, where he addressed a cheering throng in a cricket stadium just north of Johannesburg, and delivered the annual Nelson Mandela Lecture on Wednesday. Previous lecturers have included former president Bill Clinton, Nobel Prize winner Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and assorted presidents of nations and human rights activists. Ujiri stayed in Kenya and traded DeMar DeRozan . The former\u2019s words were carried live and summarized in newspapers, magazines and online forums around the world. The latter\u2019s set NBA Twitter on fire last Wednesday. Obama noted that Mandela, lionized and beloved after 27 years in prison in South Africa \u2014 and then rose to run South Africa as its president \u2014 could have ruled the country for life. \u201cWho was going to run against him?,\u201d Obama asked during the lecture. \u201c\u2026 But instead he helped guide South Africa through the drafting of a new constitution, drawing from all the institutional practices and democratic ideals that had proven to be most sturdy, mindful of the fact that no single individual possesses a monopoly on wisdom.\u201d Ujiri, still firmly in charge of the Toronto Raptors as President of Basketball Operations (and a son of Africa himself), merely has gambled his job in a nation with an inferiority complex the size of \u2026 well, Canada \u2026 that he can convince Kawhi Leonard to stay in Ontario and not go to Los Angeles in a year\u2019s time. Only the immediate future of Canada\u2019s only NBA team lies in the balance. And speaking of that word \u2014 lies\u2026 Will we ever know exactly what Ujiri said both to DeRozan, the best player in franchise history (all due respect to Vince Carter), and to DeRozan\u2019s representative in separate conversations in Las Vegas earlier this month at NBA Summer League? And even if we had a verbatim transcript, would we ever be able to reconcile the two different recollections of the conversations? DeRozan and his camp are adamant that Ujiri said he would not be traded \u2014 which, obviously, he was, a week later \u2014 and have called him a liar, explicitly and implicitly ( DeRozan\u2019s Instagram posts make his position on the issue crystal clear .) Ujiri wasn\u2019t quite as adamant in his press conference Friday, which began a couple of hours after Ujiri had arrived back from Africa, barely giving him time to shower and dress. But he was clear, even as he apologized to DeRozan for \u201ca miscommunication,\u201d he was equally clear that all he told DeRozan and his camp at the time was that no trade was imminent. Still, Ujiri apologized to DeRozan in his first public remarks since the trade last Friday. \u201cI want to not only apologize to DeMar DeRozan for maybe a gap of miscommunication but also to acknowledge him and what he\u2019s done here with the Raptors, for this city, for this country,\u201d Ujiri said. \u201cThere\u2019s no measure to what this kid has done. We appreciate him and I promise you that we\u2019re going to celebrate him in the best possible way that we can as long as I\u2019m here.\u201d In an era where so many feel it\u2019s a fait accompli that the Golden State Warriors are unbeatable, Ujiri\u2019s drive to not settle, to go all-in, to take a shot \u2014 albeit a long one \u2014 at shaking up a good team in hopes of making it great is admirable. Trading a four-time All-Star, even for a top-five player (when healthy), is not a guarantee of success, and is a bigger gamble when Leonard made his geographic preferences going forward clear. But Leonard is that good, and he just turned 27. DeRozan will be 29 when the 2018-19 season opens and his backcourt mate, road dog and fellow All-Star, Kyle Lowry, will be 32. Keeping DeRozan, at the least, would mean giving him another big contract in 2021, when he\u2019ll be 31. But was Ujiri too keen to bust up a team that, while not likely to have been a dominant, intimidating squad even in the post-LeBron Eastern Conference, was certainly capable of putting together a Finals run in the next year or two? It\u2019s hardly a secret that Ujiri wears his heart on his sleeve in so many things, from his big brother demands of the kids he has selflessly follow a path from their countries in Africa to the States and other western nations through his Giants of Africa program , to his profane outbursts against Raptors\u2019 opponents in the playoffs (\u201cBleep Brooklyn\u201d in 2014 and \u201cwe don\u2019t give a bleep\u201d about Paul Pierce\u2019s trolling in 2015 ), to his postgame (and, to be fair, private) anger at his own team\u2019s poor performances, which included both former coach Dwane Casey and DeRozan over the years. No one\u2019s ever put together the type of talent Golden State has amassed. Most good teams are like Toronto has been \u2014 one led by one All-Star, maybe two. The Raptors were in the second group. They have won 263 regular-season games the last five seasons \u2014 by far, the most in the Eastern Conference. (However, if you add up LeBron\u2019s last five seasons \u2014 his last with the Miami Heat in 2013-14, then his four seasons in Cleveland, his teams combined to win 265.) They were a really good team that ran into an all-time, Hall of Fame player \u2014 the same way the Milwaukee Bucks ran into Larry Bird in the early to mid-1980s, the same way the Cavaliers ran into Michael Jordan in the late \u201880s and early \u201990s, the same way the Sacramento Kings ran into Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O\u2019Neal as the 2000s began . That is the outcome for many, if not most, solid, well-coached teams. A team like the 2010-11 Dallas Mavericks occasionally breaks through \u2014 when it has a strong roster, a great coach and a some luck \u2014 and wins it all. But most 50-win teams don\u2019t. But the Raptors pulled the trigger, anyway. They thought about status quo-ing it with a team with Lowry and DeRozan in reduced roles in a year or two, if their young players develop as they believe they will. But that didn\u2019t seem realistic, either. Every child of five who\u2019s ever played telephone knows how words, and meanings, and inferences, can be garbled \u2014 even if they don\u2019t know what \u201cinferences\u201d means. The net-net remains that DeRozan is now with the Spurs, along with second-year big Jakob Poeltl, and Leonard is in Toronto, along with veteran guard Danny Green. The Spurs knew they had to move on from Leonard, once he made it clear he wanted out of San Antonio . The only question was where they would send him. It wasn\u2019t pleasant to contemplate moving a Finals MVP and the Spurs\u2019 franchise player, but there was no turning back. The Raptors had concluded they couldn\u2019t tinker around the margins anymore, even with a team that had won a franchise-record 59 games last season , with a coach in Casey who would go on to be named Coach of the Year \u2014 two months after Ujiri fired him . They believed the Lowry-DeRozan led team had gone as far as it could \u2014 and even though their chief tormentor the last three years, LeBron James, left the East and signed with the Lakers , Toronto did not believe anything would change going forward. There sat the Celtics, rising in the East, with Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown, and the Philadelphia 76ers coming of age with Ben Simmons as well \u2014 all long, athletic players the Raptors feared could lock up DeRozan in future postseasons, while he got older. The memories of him going 3 of 12 against the Cavs in Game 3 , and getting benched the final 14 minutes of yet another loss to LeBron, then getting ejected with Toronto down 30 in the Game 4 clincher , were still fresh. DeRozan had been good, but not All-Star great, throughout most of his five playoff appearances in Toronto. Against Brooklyn in 2014, a seven-game series loss, he\u2019d averaged almost 24 points per game in the series , but shot less than 39 percent, too. The next year, Toronto got swept by the Washington Wizards in the first round , and DeRozan\u2019s average dipped to 20.3 points per game, on 40 percent shooting . Both DeRozan and the Raptors had their best postseason success in 2016, when they reached the Eastern Conference finals . Against Indiana in the first round, DeRozan had 34 points in the crucial fifth game of a 2-2 series , then went for 30 in the decisive Game 7 . Against Miami, he had 28 and 8 in Game 7 , a 27-point Raptors rout that got them to the conference finals. But, from that point on, LeBron and the Cavs gutted the Raptors\u2019 psyche. In \u201916, Toronto had Cleveland tied 2-2 in the conference finals . But in perhaps the biggest game in franchise history, Game 5 in Cleveland, the Cavaliers smoked the 116-78 . DeRozan was 2 of 8 from the floor. And Cleveland closed Toronto out in six games . In 2017, James averaged 36 points, 8.3 rebounds and 5.3 assists in a four-game sweep of Toronto in the Eastern Conference semifinals . The Cavs won each game by an average of 15.3 points per game. And this year, of course, was the coup de grace, with Toronto blowing a 14-point first-quarter lead in Game 1 and a 10-point lead with 10 minutes left in the game . There was the too crazy to be believed sequence in the final seven seconds of regulation , with the game tied at 105, when Fred VanVleet missed a 3-pointer, DeRozan missed a putback, C.J. Miles missed the putback of that miss, then missed another putback of his miss, and Jonas Valanciunas missed a tip in. All in seven seconds. The Cavs would then beat the Raptors 113-112 in OT. And that\u2019s why, as The New York Times\u2019 Marc Stein first reported, the Raptors let it be known around the 2018 Draft that their veterans \u2013Lowry, DeRozan, Serge Ibaka and Valanciunas \u2014 were available, while none of their core young players \u2014 guards Fred Van Vleet or Delon Wright, and forwards O.G. Anunoby and Pascal Siakham \u2013 were not. The Raptors were ready to turn things over completely to their young guys, if need be. But Lowry, at more than $30 million per year through 2020, had precious few suitors. Ditto for Ibaka (almost $45 million left on his three-year, $65 million contract, also through 2020) and Valanciunas (two years and $34 million left, including a player option in 2019-20). That left DeRozan. But the Raptors did not believe the Spurs were all that interested. They\u2019d been talking round and round with Philly and the Lakers (not so much Boston, but the Celtics, with their trove of young players and remaining future Draft picks, could always get deeply involved at any moment if they chose). Toronto was on the list, too, but the discussions were stagnant. The Spurs were asking about Anunoby, a potential Leonard clone, as well as another future first, which continued to be a non-starter.  But, teams always continue dialogue, even when the trade trail goes cold. So San Antonio and Toronto kept talking, at lower management levels, while NBA Summer League began. It was in Vegas where Ujiri met DeRozan and DeRozan\u2019s agent, Aaron Goodwin, separately. The meeting with Goodwin, per sources, was planned. Running into DeRozan at Cox Pavilion, after one of the Raptors\u2019 games, was not. Ujiri and DeRozan spoke briefly \u2014 less than five minutes. Sources with knowledge of each of the talks generally concur that Ujiri said no DeRozan trade was imminent, and that he wanted to know what DeRozan was going to do this summer to become a better performer in the playoffs. What is in question is whether Ujiri assured DeRozan there would be no trade at all, or if he promised Goodwin and\/or DeRozan they would be contacted if things changed. Asked about the discussions this weekend, Goodwin said: \u201cthis is a business and more and more players are starting to understand they are only as good as the last game that they have played for some of these owners, presidents and GM\u2019s. Not all, but some. Some will treat a player and their family and representation with respect, others don\u2019t even return phone calls. DeMar to this day still has not heard anything from ownership.\u201d After Vegas, Ujiri went on his trip to Africa and the meeting with President Obama and Auma Obama. But San Antonio hadn\u2019t made any headway with Philly and was still extremely reluctant to trade Leonard to the Lakers. There weren\u2019t many options. And the specter of Leonard going to the USA Basketball minicamp this week in Las Vegas, with Gregg Popovich also there in his first official appearance as the U.S. team\u2019s coach, was not what anyone wanted to endure. Whatever the timetable, the sides began moving toward one another. The Spurs dropped their request for another pick. The Raptors included one of their young guys in Poeltl. It came together, quickly. San Antonio had resolution, finally. DeRozan, a class act and hard worker, will provide a potent one-two punch with All-Star LaMarcus Aldridge. The Spurs hope Dejounte Murray makes a big jump in his first full season as a starter, without the specter of a Hall of Famer in Tony Parker behind him. The Spurs will figure it out without Leonard. They had a lot of practice doing so last season. Toronto, though, begins watching the clock. The Raptors have a sales job in front of them. They think they check all the boxes in which Leonard will be interested \u2014 strong ownership, organizational purpose and infrastructure, a culture of defense, a rabid fan base, a fabulous, cosmopolitan city that nonetheless won\u2019t smother a basketball player the way it might, say, John Tavares. ( Longtime San Diego reporter\/columnist Mark Zeigler wrote Sunday that the Raptors\u2019 chances of keeping Leonard may be better than people think.) His first visit, replete with smiling photo , was one step. A million more follow. https:\/\/twitter.com\/Raptors\/status\/1020452739887902722 Yes, other teams have had to make difficult calls on star players. Boston moved Isaiah Thomas after an MVP-caliber season in order to get Kyrie Irving . Miami decided there was a price it was not willing to pay to keep Dwyane Wade in 2016 (though it got him back last February, after stops in Chicago and Cleveland). But DeRozan was the first star in the Raptors\u2019 history who never asked to be traded, never had a foot out the door, never broke Toronto\u2019s heart by wanting to be elsewhere. He didn\u2019t even take a free agent visit in 2016, agreeing to a five-year deal with the Raptors almost immediately . He repped the team that took him in the first round in 2009 , and would have had no problem playing his whole career there. He was loyal to Toronto, which built a team around him that became one of the NBA\u2019s better teams. But not its best. And so loyalty had to take a back seat to cold calculation. The Raptors are putting their chips and their essential body parts in the middle of the table, no longer satisfied with being good, even very good. They will either be great or they will rebuild, all on the word of a man who, unlike the 44th President of the United States, doesn\u2019t have much to say at all. * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

From Frank Young: I doubt it would be next week, Frank. The Raptors certainly want to try and convince Leonard to stay, and they have a story to tell \u2014 about their team, their organization, and their city\/country that is unique among NBA franchises. Maybe Leonard and Kyle Lowry hit it off off the floor the way Lowry and DeMar DeRozan did. Maybe Toronto\u2019s legendary Director of Sports Science, Alex McKechnie \u2014 who has worked wonders with NBA players for two-plus decades \u2014 gets in front of him and finds something that works to rapidly improve Leonard\u2019s quad. Maybe Kawhi develops a real taste for poutine. I\u2019m just saying you have to give it some time. If it reached a point of no return and the Raptors knew Leonard wasn\u2019t going to re-sign, I\u2019m sure they\u2019d ask for some sort of Brandon Ingram\/Kyle Kuzma-led package for him. Okay, I had to think about this one. From Vivek Thirumalal:  I have to say, that\u2019s an interesting idea, Vivek. Most players have bonuses in their deals for winning league awards like first-team All NBA, Kia Defensive Player of the Year, etc., and under your criteria, some players would indeed be stuck and prohibited from making All-Star or All-NBA teams if they were the third- or fourth-biggest stars on their incumbent teams. One thing to keep in mind, though: the \u201csupermax\u201d deals that John Wall and Russell Westbrook got when they made All-NBA teams are only possible for players who were drafted by their current teams. So if a player went somewhere else in free agency to have a better chance at an All-Star\/all-NBA spot, he\u2019d be walking away from that potential supermax. Ironic, \u2018cause you can find a steak just about everywhere in that town for $3.99. From John Ferensen: I hear you, John. This is a case where you\u2019re right, but the teams are right, too. You want value for the money you bring out of your pocket, and it\u2019s frustrating when you don\u2019t get to see the top picks \u2014 which is the whole point of watching NBA Summer League \u2014 play multiple games. But the reality is that as teams increase in value \u2014 the New York Knicks , they\u2019re going to be more and more protective of their players \u2014 especially their rookies, who are on (relatively) cheap contracts for up to four years before hitting free agency. And since most teams\u2019 rosters are already filled before NBA Summer League even begins, there\u2019s even less incentive to play anyone for long in Vegas who\u2019s likely to be in the rotation when the regular season begins. There isn\u2019t a coach in Vegas who\u2019s upset when his team is eliminated from the \u201cplayoffs\u201d at Thomas and Mack and Cox Pavilion. Trust me.

Forty-year-old guard Manu Ginobili has yet to announce whether he, too, will return next season in San Antonio. $3.6 Billion \u2014 Estimated value of the New York Knicks, the most valuable NBA franchise, according to Forbes Magazine\u2019s annual ranking of the world\u2019s 50 most valuable sports franchises . Eight NBA teams made the list: the Knicks, who ranked seventh overall; the Lakers ($3.3 billion, tied for 8th); the Warriors ($3.1 billion, t-10th); the Bulls ($2.6 billion, t-23rd); the Celtics ($2.5 billion, t-27th); the Nets ($2.3 billion, t-36th); the Rockets ($2.2 billion, 40th) and the Clippers ($2.15 billion, t-41st). The Dallas Cowboys, valued at $4.8 billion, led the list. $14,000 \u2014 Estimated ad rate for a 30-second TV ad next season for Lakers games on Spectrum SportsNet, according to sources of SportsBusiness Daily media reporter John Ourand. That would double what the Lakers got for 30-second ads this past season. Ourand says the ad rate could go even higher if the team\u2019s ratings exceed expectations. 1) Well, the Lakers won\u2019t be boring, that\u2019s for damn sure. 2) Not for nothing, but the WNBA is on fire this season. Night in and night out, there are incredible performances \u2014 Dallas\u2019 Liz Cambage breaking the league record for points in a game, with 53 last week against New York , rookie A\u2019ja Wilson starring for the relocated Aces to in their first season in Las Vegas; Seattle\u2019s Breanna Stewart leading the league and her team in scoring en route to a league-best 18-6 record, and stalwarts Sue Bird, Maya Moore, Diana Taurasi, Elena Delle Donne and Tiffany Hayes impacting their squads as usual. Next weekend\u2019s All-Star Game in Minneapolis will be an appropriate celebration of a great first half of the season. The league\u2019s off-court issues \u2014 officiating, pay, marketing, travel (I am ashamed to admit I had no idea so many players were still flying coach\/commercial while every NBA team charters, and has chartered, for decades) \u2014 are another matter altogether. But the ball has been outstanding. 3) Our NBA TV colleague, Eric Pincus,  sniffs out a potential future Kawhi link to the Lakers here on Bleacher Report . 4) Marc Gasol is having a better summer than you . Kudos to a true citizen of the world. 1) The Sixers had a clear, stated goal this offseason: to add a superstar talent to play with Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons for the next four years. They had cap room and the momentum of a second-round playoff run. Yet Philly has, so far, failed to strike \u2014 for LeBron James, for Paul George, for Jimmy Butler (via trade) \u2014 and, now, for Kawhi Leonard, who\u2019s in Toronto. Meanwhile, the 76ers thought they had a deal for free agent forward Nemanja Bjelica \u2014 but Bjelica backed out, and signed with Sacramento instead . A team with championship aspirations and plenty of cap space shouldn\u2019t be losing free agents to the Kings. Wilson Chandler and Mike Muscala, acquired in separate trades (although Muscala is not official yet), will help. But that wasn\u2019t what the 76ers thought the offseason would bring. The summer\u2019s not over yet. But Philly has work left to do. 2) Watching the reaction to the discovery that Brewers pitcher Josh Hader posted racist and homophobic Tweets at 17 was \u2026 interesting. The overwhelming reaction I saw, frankly, from most white baseball writers and fans was that Hader, now 24, should be cut a break, that none of us should be judged forever by dumb things we did when we were teenagers. I agree. Empathy for other people is never a bad thing. I would only point out, however and unfortunately, that Tamir Rice was 12 when he was killed by police in Cleveland, less than five seconds after they encountered him in a park. Trayvon Martin was 17 when George Zimmerman stalked and killed him. Jordan Davis was 17 when he was murdered by Michael Dunn after Dunn became enraged at the loud music Davis and his friends were playing in their car. My point in bringing these killings up is that young men of color, too often, are not given the benefit of the doubt about their motives, their vocal \u201ctone,\u201d their body movements, when they are Hader\u2019s age, much less about what they may have posted on social media.  I don\u2019t know Hader. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s in his heart. I am moved by how his African-American teammates went out of their way to defend him, to say they know him and don\u2019t believe him to be racist. And I accept that, completely. But a standing ovation for Hader as he returned to the mound in Milwaukee ? Was he somehow \u201cvictimized\u201d by what, after all, was a controversy brought about by what he did? Contrast this with how so many NFL fans have responded to the simple, non-aggressive act of players kneeling during the national anthem before games to bring attention to police brutality against people of color around the country. I hope Hader\u2019s heart has changed. I cannot help, though, thinking about all the boys of color whose hearts are never given the benefit of the doubt, and who didn\u2019t get to be Hader\u2019s age today because of that. 3) RIP, Mitch Chortkoff, the longtime \u2014 six decades!! \u2014 Lakers beat writer for just about every local publication in the Los Angeles area during his illustrious career.

I\u2019m not going to say I won\u2019t, but to say that\u2019s a weakness is like saying that\u2019s everybody\u2019s weakness.

According to Marc Stein of The New York Times , Anthony will join the Rockets once he officially becomes a free agent. However, it may take a while for Anthony reach that status because the reported three-team trade between the Oklahoma City Thunder, Atlanta Hawks and Philadelphia 76ers has yet to even take place. Anthony is expected to be released by the Hawks once the trade becomes official. The deal sends guard Dennis Schroder from the Hawks, which drafted him 17th overall in 2013 and who has been Atlanta\u2019s incumbent starter the last two seasons, to the Thunder for Anthony and a Lottery-protected (1-14) 2022 first-round pick. In addition, forward\/center Mike Muscala was re-routed from Atlanta to Philadelphia through Oklahoma City, which will receive former first-rounder Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot from Philly. The 76ers will send third-year wing Justin Anderson to Atlanta to complete the deal. Here\u2019s more from Stein on Anthony\u2019s next move and how another trade the Sixers are eyeing may happen first : Rockets star James Harden and GM Daryl Morey recently expressed confidence that the team would add Anthony sometime this summer. Speaking at separate functions, Kia NBA Most Valuable Award winner James Harden and Rockets general manager Daryl Morey both said they believe Anthony would be a good addition to a team that was one win away from reaching The Finals. According to For The Win , a Q&A session with fans on Instagram for his team\u2019s esports organization, Clutch Gaming, Morey was asked, \u201cSo we for sure getting Carmelo Anthony?\u201d According to the Houston Chronicle , Harden said at an event in Houston believes getting Anthony would benefit a team. Harden also responded to changes on the team, as it lost key defensive players in Trevor Ariza and Luc Mbah a Moute in free agency. The Rockets signed former Kia Rookie of the Year Michael Carter-Williams and forward James Ennis. The 34-year-old Anthony had been the headliner his entire career \u2014 he\u2019s 19th in NBA history with 25,417 points \u2014 but he was more of a catch-and-shoot scorer last season instead of the isolation specialist he had always been. He averaged 16.2 points per game , but struggled at times in his new role. His playing time dwindled in the playoffs and he wasn\u2019t happy. In Game 6 of the first-round playoff series against the Utah Jazz that ended Oklahoma City\u2019s season , he played fewer minutes than backup Jerami Grant. * Aldridge:  Anthony one step closer to Houston now After the season, he said he prefers to play with the ball in his hands more and said coming off the bench is \u201cout of the question.\u201d \u201cSo it\u2019s something I really have to think about, if I really want to be this type of player, finish out my career as this type of player, knowing that I have so much left in the tank and I bring so much to the game of basketball,\u201d he said. Schroder, a 24-year-old guard from Germany, has played his entire five-year NBA career with the Hawks after they selected him with the No. 17 pick in the 2013 NBA Draft. The Thunder are eager to add Schroder\u2019s speed and ball-handling ability to the mix with All-Stars Russell Westbrook and Paul George. Chris Vivlamore of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports the Hawks wanted to move on from Schroder following the smattering of moves they made with their backcourt this summer . Muscala, also drafted by Atlanta in 2013, brings size and shooting to Philadelphia. The 6-foot-11 forward\/center averaged 7.6 points and 4.3 rebounds in 20.0 minutes and shot 37.1 percent from 3-point range last season. His presence could help replace the production of forward Ersan Ilyasova, who signed with the Milwaukee Bucks during free agency . Luwawu-Cabbarot is two years removed from being selected with the No. 24 pick in the 2016 NBA Draft. The lanky guard averaged 5.8 points, 1.4 rebounds and 1.0 assists in 15.5 minutes for the 76ers last season . Anderson is a four-year NBA veteran after two seasons with the Dallas Mavericks and two with the 76ers. He played in just 38 games for Philadelphia last season. He was selected by the Mavericks with the No. 21 pick of the 2015 NBA Draft.

Fresh off of signing a one-year deal free agent deal with the Denver Nuggets , Thomas is still talking about his brief and controversial tenure with the Celtics. In a detailed conversation with ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski, Thomas discusses his rise with the Celtics, his dramatic and injury-plagued end in Boston and the tumultuous ride he\u2019s been on since departing (via trades) first for the Cleveland Cavaliers and, later, the Los Angeles Lakers (where he finished the 2017-18 season). And the book on Thomas and the Celtics might not be closed, according to the Nuggets\u2019 new backup point guard : Thomas, the 60th and last pick of the 2011 NBA Draft , made a name for himself as a clutch scorer with the Boston Celtics after his previous two teams (Sacramento and Phoenix) parted ways with him. In two-and-a-half seasons with Boston, the 5-foot-9 guard averaged 24.7 points and six assists per game. In 2016-17, Thomas was the driving force behind the Celtics\u2019 run to the Eastern Conference Finals while earning All-NBA Second Team honors along the way. That playoff run ended, however, with a hip injury that lingered well past Boston dealing him to Cleveland in exchange for Kyrie Irving. Thomas played just 15 games for the Cavaliers before he was again dealt, this time to the Los Angeles Lakers. He suited up in 17 games for the Lakers before hip surgery ended a season in which he shot just 37.3 percent. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times during the 2017-18 season, Thomas told Tania Ganguli that he was open to staying in L.A. \u2014 even in a reserve role . Those words came less than a week after Thomas told USA Today \u2018s Sam Amick that \u201cI\u2019m not no sixth man. And I won\u2019t be a sixth man (in the future). I just want everybody to know that, like clear as can be \u2026\u201d Additionally, Thomas told NBA.com\u2019s Shaun Powell in a late February he wants a long-term deal in free agency . \u201cI\u2019m looking to sign a long-term deal this summer but anything can happen. I can\u2019t control it and can\u2019t worry too much about it. I was only in Sacramento for three years, Boston for almost three years and the other stops were temporary. I\u2019m looking hopefully to sign long term and call someplace home.\u201d For the Nuggets, the move to add Thomas bolsters their already considerable depth. The franchise re-signed star center Nikola Jokic and sixth man Will Barton to a long-term contracts on July 9, roughly two weeks after drafting Michael Porter Jr. with the No. 14 pick in the 2018 NBA Draft .

A day after signing a four-year deal to remain in the only NBA jersey he\u2019s ever played in, Smart said he\u2019s focused on doing what he can to help the Celtics win their 18th championship. \u201dI\u2019m ecstatic. This is a blessing,\u201d Smart said Friday. After being in limbo since the start of free agency, Smart cemented his pact with the Celtics on Thursday. A person with knowledge of the agreement told The Associated Press that Smart will be paid $52 million over the next four years. The person spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because the team did not disclose the terms of the contract. Boston brings back a 6-foot-4 defensive cornerstone who has developed a reputation for toughness and doing the little things that help the Celtics win. Smart is also the longest-tenured player on the roster. The confidence that general manager Danny Ainge is showing in his abilities is not lost on Smart, who acknowledged he knew he was entering a tough free agent market this summer. \u201dTo be honest, I didn\u2019t know where I was gonna end up. I was just enjoying this whole process,\u201d he said. \u201dIt is a business, so things aren\u2019t perfect. That\u2019s why it\u2019s called negotiations. You guys come together and you finally agree on something. We both agreed. Boston loves me and I love Boston. Boston wants me here and I want to be here. I am here. So we made it work.\u201d Barring any late changes, Smart\u2019s return also means Boston will be bringing back the core of the team that won 55 games and reached the Eastern Conference finals while battling numerous injuries and being without both Kyrie Irving and Gordon Hayward the entire postseason. Smart was a huge part of the run, stepping in to a starter\u2019s role after returning from thumb surgery late in the first round of the playoffs. He averaged 9.8 points, 5.3 assists and 3.7 rebounds per game as Boston pushed LeBron James\u2019 Cleveland Cavaliers to seven games in the conference finals. Now, James is in the West with the Lakers, and given the emergence of youngsters Jaylen Brown and J ayson Tatum, Smart said he doesn\u2019t see any reason why the Celtics shouldn\u2019t be a favorite to come out of the East. \u201dWe demonstrated the talent and ability we had to do that last year with a few missing pieces. With those missing pieces back in action, I think it really makes it hard for teams,\u201d Smart said. \u201dI think we have a real shot.\u201d The signing also will allow Smart to shift his attention back to his mother, 63-year-old Camellia Smart, who continues to undergo treatment for the bone marrow cancer she was diagnosed with in April. \u201dWhen you kind of go through adversity and something like this hits you and your family, it kind of puts everything in perspective and everything else kind of becomes a blur to you and really not that important,\u201d he said. He has been with her in Texas since the season ended and said she\u2019s stable and doing well. \u201dShe\u2019s hanging in there,\u201d Smart said. \u201dThis is a hard time. But at the same time, it\u2019s an exciting time for my family. So, with the signing, it kind of brings a little joy to a situation and lightens up the situation that was a little darkened for me. \u2026 As of right now, she\u2019s doing great.\u201d As far as basketball is concerned, he\u2019ll continue trying to improve. \u201dI\u2019m just gonna be working on all aspects of my game. The uniqueness about me is I don\u2019t do one thing perfectly or great. I do a little bit of everything. That\u2019s what makes me so unique.

You can\u2019t keep doing the same thing over and over. \u201cAt this point, we got to the level where this opportunity came to us, and we had to jump on it.\u201d Leonard was not at Friday\u2019s news conference, but said the team has seen some of medical reports on Leonard. The Spurs\u2019 star was limited to nine games in 2017-18 because of a lingering right quadriceps injury and made it known early in the offseason he sought a trade. \u201cWithout the medical drama, you have no chance to talk to a player like this. He would still be in San Antonio,\u201d Ujiri said. Since being dealt to Toronto \u2014 a move that seemed to please neither player \u2014 concerns have been raised about whether or not Leonard will stay with the Raptors long term. That talk is something Ujiri is aware of, yet is also something he has yet to encounter himself with Leonard or his representation. \u201cHe (Kawhi) has not expressed that he doesn\u2019t want to play in Canada to me,\u201d Ujiri said. \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot to sell here: our team, our culture, our city, our ownership. We have everything here except a championship, in my humble opinion. \u201cThat\u2019s my job. That\u2019s why I am in this seat. To try to figure that part out. I\u2019ve had conversations with Kawhi, his agent and his uncle and everything has gone well. I\u2019m looking forward to meeting them.\u201d The initially positive vibes between player and team were tweeted out on the Raptors\u2019 social media account Friday evening after Leonard arrived in Toronto. The post included a photo of Leonard with Ujiri and general manager Bobby Webster. Welcome to the North pic.twitter.com\/FWy6huVI9l \u2014 Toronto Raptors (@Raptors) July 20, 2018 Before the trade happened, ESPN had reported the Raptors\u2019 brass had met with DeRozan during NBA Summer League and told him he would not be traded . As word of the trade circulated the NBA social media atmosphere on Wednesday, DeRozan took to Instagram and posted a story there that read: \u201cBe told one thing & the outcome another. Ain\u2019t no loyalty in this game. Sell you out for a quick bit of nothing \u2026 Soon you\u2019ll understand \u2026 Don\u2019t disturb.\u201d As reports involving the Raptors possibly trading DeMar DeRozan for Kawhi Leonard escalate, here is DeMar\u2019s IG story: pic.twitter.com\/Wbb72mw0qR \u2014 Rachel Nichols (@Rachel__Nichols) July 18, 2018 Ujiri on Friday said he will do \u201canything in his power\u201d to honor DeRozan in the future. He also opened his news conference by apologizing to DeRozan for a \u201cgap in miscommunication\u201d leading up to the trade. \u201cI want to not only apologize to DeMar DeRozan for a gap of miscommunication but also to acknowledge him and what he\u2019s done here with the Raptors, for the city, and for the country,\u201d Ujiri said. \u201cThere\u2019s no measure to what this kid has done.\u201d\u200b Masai on DeMar pic.twitter.com\/KaoSDXIyZH \u2014 Toronto Raptors (@Raptors) July 20, 2018 \u201cI had a conversation with DeMar at Summer League, and I really want to leave it at that \u2026 I think maybe my mistake is talking about what we expected from him going forward. DeMar has done so much for this organization. When you\u2019re in my position you always have to be open in what you can do. Both of us had a conversation, and me and DeMar know what that conversation was. Maybe I could have handled it better. That\u2019s what I\u2019m apologizing for. \u201cHe\u2019s the greatest player to play for the Raptors to this point. No one can dispute that.\u201d News of the reported deal broke early Wednesday as the Raptors and Spurs reportedly engaged in serious talks involving the Raptors acquiring the two-time Kia Defensive Player of the Year and former NBA Finals MVP Leonard. The details of the trade were still being worked out early Wednesday, but centered on Leonard and DeRozan, writes Yahoo Sports\u2019 Shams Charania . Leonard\u2019s future was a subject of league-wide fascination ever since it was first reported he wanted to leave the only team for which he has played. Despite attempts by the Spurs \u2014 including a try by Popovich \u2014 to mend the relationship , Leonard and his camp steadfastly maintained their distance as the offseason has worn on. The strain between Leonard and San Antonio built throughout the 2017-18 campaign as the former 15th overall pick dealt with a quad injury that kept him from playing in all but nine games. The unusual recovery time was compounded by his physical separation from the team, as Leonard continued his rehab in New York. His absence was especially notable during the Spurs\u2019 first-round playoff exit to the Golden State Warriors. Leonard was then spotted at a Los Angeles Dodgers home game three weeks later. Los Angeles had long been reported as Leonard\u2019s preferred destination. Talks between the Spurs and Lakers reportedly took place on more than one occasion , but never gained enough momentum for completion. Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":39270,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-yogi-ferrell-changes-course-deal-dallas-mavericks","date":"2018-07-20","title":"Reports: Yogi Ferrell changes direction on free-agent deal with Dallas Mavericks","content":" A day after seemingly reaching an agreement to stay put, Dallas Mavericks guard Yogi Ferrell has had a change of heart about his deal with the team. Yahoo Sports\u2019 Shams Charania ( via Twitter ) and ESPN\u2019s Tim McMahon report Ferrell has changed course on the two-year contract he reached yesterday that would keep him in Dallas. Charania reports Ferrell is fielding interest from several teams and plans to decide on his team within the next day . MacMahon reports Tejeda informed the Mavs of Ferrell\u2019s decision to back out of his agreement after they read the report of the deal online. Tejeda declined to comment on the situation when reached by ESPN. Last season, Ferrell averaged 10.2 points, three assists and 2.5 rebounds per game as he started 21 of 82 games played for Dallas. He joined the Mavs on a 10-day contract in the middle of the 2016-17 season. One month after he joined the team, he lit up the Portland Trail Blazers for 32 points and nine 3-pointers on Feb. 3, 2017 . It was a key moment as Ferrell \u2014 who went undrafted \u2014 quickly became a key piece in the Mavs\u2019 rebuilding project. Last week, the Mavs rescinded Ferrell\u2019s qualifying offer, which made him an unrestricted free agent. However, that move was seen as just a formality, writes ESPN\u2019s Tim MacMahon , as the sides were in the final stages of working out the new deal (which would have cost Dallas slightly less in annual salary). That all seems to have changed, though, and Ferrell is back in the free-agent marketplace. In addition to determining what happens next with Ferrell, the Mavs were also closing in on a deal with franchise icon Dirk Nowitzki yesterday .

Ten years have passed since Korver last suited up for Philly, but it seems a return to the 76ers could be something the team is interested in pursuing. The Sixers and Cleveland Cavaliers \u2014 whom Korver now plays for \u2014 have had talks about swapping guards in a deal that would bring Korver back to Philadelphia, writes Keith Pompey of Philly.com. Shortly after news broke of the Sixers being a part of the Carmelo Anthony trade involving the Atlanta Hawks , Pompey reported the news on the potential Korver-Sixers reunion . Korver has made 5,130 3-pointers in his career, which ranks him fourth on the NBA\u2019s all-time list in that category . Last season, he ranked sixth in 3-point percentage (43.6 percent) and had led the league in 3-point percentage four times in his career (2009-10, \u201913-14, \u201914-15, \u201916-17). The Sixers drafted Korver with the No. 51 pick in the 2003 Draft and he averaged 10.5 points and shot 40.9 percent in 337 career games with Philadelphia. He was traded to the Utah Jazz on Dec. 29, 2007. In the Anthony trade, the Sixers are set to receive big man Mike Muscala from the Hawks. The deal is not expected to be completed for the next 7-10 days, but Muscala\u2019s move to Philadelphia would replace the shooting the Sixers lost when Ersan Ilyasova opted to sign with the Milwaukee Bucks this summer. Muscala has averaged 5.4 points and shot 37.8 percent on 3-pointers in his five NBA seasons. Although the Sixers lost Belinelli in free agency this summer, they did make sure to re-sign 3-point shooting guard J.J. Redick. He ranked 14th in the NBA in 3-pointers made ( 193 ) and provides Philadelphia with a much-needed outside scoring threat. The pending arrival of Muscala and the potential addition of Korver would only seem to bolster a Sixers\u2019 offense that ranked 12th in 3-pointers made per game and 10th in 3-point percentage last season."},{"id":39225,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/la-clippers-sign-forward-luc-mbah-moute-official-release","date":"2018-07-20","title":"L.A.

Thursday\u2019s reported trade of Carmelo Anthony from the Oklahoma City Thunder to the Atlanta Hawks as part of a three-team deal also involving the Philadelphia 76ers \u2014 and which will be followed by the Hawks waiving Anthony \u2014 obviously clears the way for Anthony to join Chris Paul in Houston. This move has been rumored for weeks once it became clear OKC had to get rid of Anthony to lower what would have been a lethal luxury tax bill next year. The deal sends guard Dennis Schroder from the Hawks, which drafted him 17th overall in 2013 and who has been Atlanta\u2019s incumbent starter the last two seasons, to the Thunder for Anthony and a Lottery-protected (1-14) 2022 first-round pick. In addition, forward\/center Mike Muscala was re-routed from Atlanta to Philadelphia through Oklahoma City, which will receive former first-rounder Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot from Philly. The 76ers will send third-year wing Justin Anderson to Atlanta to complete the deal. Anthony has told people for more than a week that he expects to wind up with the Rockets, according to a league source. The Rockets have been in flux this offseason, losing defensive stalwart and team leader Trevor Ariza in free agency to the Phoenix Suns , along with Luc Mbah a Moute, who returned to the LA Clippers after one season in Houston. The Rockets helped stanch some of their defensive losses by agreeing to a deal with 3-and-D wing James Ennis (career 36 percent on 3-pointers) from the Detroit Pistons last week. Anthony would not help the Rockets much at the defensive end. But the 34-year-old Anthony can still score, even though his average fell to 16.2 points last season as the Thunder\u2019s third option behind All-Stars Russell Westbrook and Paul George.  Houston\u2019s offense doesn\u2019t need upgrading \u2014 the Rockets were just behind top-ranked Golden State Warriors in Offensive Rating last season (112.2) , and of course, obliterated the rest of the league in 3-point attempts and makes . But after Paul missed the last two games of the Western Conference finals against the Warriors, Houston\u2019s offense bogged down at the worst possible times \u2014 most notably the second half of Game 7, when the Rockets missed a seemingly impossible 27 consecutive 3-pointers . Anthony isn\u2019t a great 3-point shooter by any means, but he\u2019s still a load in the post and is still able to get to the foul line. In his last season with the New York Knicks, when he was more of a primary option, Anthony still averaged almost five free throws a game . The Thunder\u2019s main motivation to trade Anthony rather than use its stretch provision to get his $27.8 million off its books for next season was not just economic, though that was a key factor. OKC will save less money by trading Anthony rather than stretching him, but in doing so the Thunder will also address a major need that was clear to any who\u2019ve watched the team the last couple of years \u2014 an offense that falls apart whenever Westbrook is on the bench. If OKC had just stretched Anthony, it would have had $9.6 million in dead money on its books that it couldn\u2019t have done anything with this season. The Thunder chose instead to take on Schroder\u2019s $15.5 million for next season. Schroder became obsolete in Atlanta once the Hawks decided to acquire the rights to rookie point guard Trae Young on Draft night . In OKC, Schroder gives the Thunder a young veteran who can create offense for himself and others when Westbrook needs a blow.  But Schroder has to deal with pending legal action against him stemming from an incident last September in DeKalb County, Ga., in which he and three other men were involved in a fight with another man, who reported suffered a torn ACL and meniscus. The charges against Schroder were recommended to be upgraded from misdemeanor to felony . Assuming the charges are resolved before the start of the season \u2014 a good assumption, or the Thunder would have never signed off on the deal \u2014 OKC will upgrade its roster with a player who will provide incredible versatility as either a top-notch reserve. Schroder is a player who could start alongside Westbrook or, at the worst, could be moved down the road. He has three years and $46.5 million left on his deal. Atlanta made its intentions for Schroder clear when it picked Young rather than Luka Doncic, whose rights the Hawks sent to Dallas in a Draft-night deal, and traded for veteran point guard Jeremy Lin from the Brooklyn Nets days ago . The Hawks just wanted a first-round pick for Schroder, and got one from OKC, which wouldn\u2019t have been able to move Anthony\u2019s whole contract without it. Muscala\u2019s $5 million had to be included to make the deal work financially. He became coveted by Philadelphia after free agent Nemanja Bjelica backed out of a verbal agreement with the 76ers this week. Philly needed a stretch four who could shoot, and Muscala is a career 37.8 percent 3-point shooter . Anderson was a former first-rounder ( 21st overall in 2015 ) with the Dallas Mavericks whose athletic ability and work ethic have made him a team favorite both in Dallas and Philly. The rebuilding Hawks will give him a look on the wings along with Taurean Prince, DeAndre\u2019 Bembry and first-round pick Kevin Huerter. The Hawks have also been shopping veteran forward Kent Bazemore since before this year\u2019s Draft.

(AP) \u2014 DeMarcus Cousins spent his first eight seasons in the NBA chasing two things \u2014 peace and the playoffs. After signing with Golden State as a free agent, the four-time All-Star center has no doubts he\u2019ll finally find both, and that those will help dispel the notion that he\u2019s a bad teammate. \u201cJust a chance to play for a winning culture,\u201d Cousins said Thursday. \u201cI also have a chance to play with some of the most talented players of this era. Those two things alone, that pretty much sums it up.\u201d Looking relaxed while sitting on a stage next to Warriors general manager Bob Myers, Cousins was at ease during a news conference at the team\u2019s practice facility. Golden State\u2019s fiery big man seems content in his new surroundings and wants the hardware to show for it. \u201cEvery guy said let\u2019s go get another championship,\u201d Cousins said. \u201cThey are a well-established team and they could have easily been like, \u2018No, we don\u2019t need him.\u2019 But they were excited like a team that\u2019s never accomplished anything.\u201d While his signing in Golden State drew mostly groans from around the NBA, Cousins didn\u2019t need much persuading to join the two-time defending champions. He has never played in the postseason, is coming off Achilles surgery in January and didn\u2019t attract much attention in free agency until signing a $5.3 million, one-year contract with Golden State. From the Warriors\u2019 side, it\u2019s a case of the rich getting richer. They\u2019ve won the championship three of the past four seasons with an attack heavy on perimeter shooting and defense. In the 6-foot-7-inch, 270-pound Cousins, they now have a dominant presence on the low block as well. \u201cIt\u2019s a different dimension,\u201d Myers said. \u201cIt\u2019s not something that we\u2019ve ever had as far as a low-post threat since I\u2019ve been here. I\u2019m excited. I hope he\u2019s excited.\u201d Cousins averaged 25.2 points and career highs in rebounds (12.9), assists (5.4) and minutes (36.2) with New Orleans before getting hurt. He has been frustrated by the tediousness of rehab but is being cautious in his approach. \u201cI\u2019m progressing weekly, which is a positive,\u201d Cousins said. \u201cAs far as a timetable, to be determined. I have to be smart about it. I\u2019m in a unique situation as well where I\u2019m not needed right away. Time is kind of on my side so I have a chance to get to 100 percent. \u201cMaking it to the playoffs won\u2019t be an issue for this team obviously. Once the basketball part comes, everything else will take care of itself.\u201d A throng of media attended the news conference, flanked by 150 young fans who were taking part in a basketball camp held by Warriors. Cousins answered questions from two of the youngsters who were eager to know who his favorite players were growing up. The 27-year-old with a quick temper and a history of piling up technical fouls at a rapid rate showed a playful side when he joked about the possibility of fighting with new teammates Kevin Durant and Draymond Green, two players with whom he\u2019s had on-court issues in the past. \u201cMight as well,\u201d Cousins said as the crowd laughed. Cousins turned serious at one point when asked about reports that he had been offered a new contract by New Orleans before signing with Golden State. \u201cOnly me and [Pelicans general manager] Dale Demps know what was said on the phone that night,\u201d Cousins said. \u201cWe both know the truth and I\u2019ll leave it at that.\u201d As for his new team, Cousins has assimilated quickly. He played with several members of the Warriors while winning a gold medal as part of Team USA during the 2016 Summer Olympics. \u201cMe and Draymond clicked right away,\u201d Cousins said. \u201cWe\u2019re two goofballs that like to joke around a lot. Same with KD and same thing with Steph [Curry]. It\u2019s a great group. I think we\u2019ll mesh well.\u201d Until he is medically cleared to play, Cousins will continue to rehab and learn coach Steve Kerr\u2019s system. He\u2019ll also reach out to the Oakland community, something he made a quiet habit of while in Sacramento playing for the Kings. \u201cI get out in the \u2018hoods,\u201d Cousins said. \u201cI want to go to the worst, the grimiest places. That\u2019s where I want to be. Those are usually the kids or the communities that kind of get left behind or forgotten about. I feel like I was in that situation at one point. That\u2019s where my mindset is and that\u2019s what I stand for.\u201d"},{"id":39247,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/reports-carmelo-anthony-traded-atlanta-hawks-dennis-schroder","date":"2018-07-19","title":"Reports: Carmelo Anthony dealt to Atlanta Hawks in three-team trade","content":" The Oklahoma City Thunder, Atlanta Hawks and Philadelphia 76ers have agreed to a three-team trade that will send Carmelo Anthony, Justin Anderson and a protected 2022 first-round pick to the Atlanta Hawks, Dennis Schroder and Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot to the Thunder, and Mike Muscala to the 76ers, according to reports from Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN and Shams Charania of Yahoo!

He averaged 16.2 points per game , but struggled at times in his new role. His playing time dwindled in the playoffs and he wasn\u2019t happy. In Game 6 of the first-round playoff series against the Utah Jazz that ended Oklahoma City\u2019s season , he played fewer minutes than backup Jerami Grant. * Aldridge:  Anthony one step closer to Houston now After the season, he said he prefers to play with the ball in his hands more and said coming off the bench is \u201cout of the question.\u201d \u201cSo it\u2019s something I really have to think about, if I really want to be this type of player, finish out my career as this type of player, knowing that I have so much left in the tank and I bring so much to the game of basketball,\u201d he said. In acquiring Schroder from Atlanta, the Thunder get a boost to their bench scoring, writes ESPN\u2019s Royce Young ( via Twitter ): Schroder, a 24-year-old guard from Germany, has played his entire five-year NBA career with the Hawks after they selected him with the No. 17 pick in the 2013 NBA Draft. The Thunder are eager to add Schroder\u2019s speed and ball-handling ability to the mix with All-Stars Russell Westbrook and Paul George. Chris Vivlamore of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports the Hawks wanted to move on from Schroder following the smattering of moves they made with their backcourt this summer : The first-round pick being sent to the Hawks is lottery protected (1-14) for 2022 and becomes two second-round picks if it doesn\u2019t convey, according to Royce Young of ESPN . Muscala, also drafted by Atlanta in 2013, brings size and shooting to Philadelphia. The 6-foot-11 forward\/center averaged 7.6 points and 4.3 rebounds in 20.0 minutes and shot 37.1 percent from 3-point range last season. His presence could help replace the production of forward Ersan Ilyasova, who signed with the Milwaukee Bucks during free agency . Luwawu-Cabbarot is two years removed from being selected with the No. 24 pick in the 2016 NBA Draft. The lanky guard averaged 5.8 points, 1.4 rebounds and 1.0 assists in 15.5 minutes for the 76ers last season . Anderson is a four-year NBA veteran after two seasons with the Dallas Mavericks and two with the 76ers. He played in just 38 games for Philadelphia last season. He was selected by the Mavericks with the No. 21 pick of the 2015 NBA Draft.

According to ESPN\u2019s Tim MacMahon and Yahoo Sports\u2019 Shams Charania, the Mavs have an agreement in place with guard Yogi Ferrell on a two-year contract. In addition, Mavs all-time leading scorer Dirk Nowitzki and the Mavs are making plans to finalize a one-year deal with the former Finals MVP, Charania writes. Last week, the Mavs rescinded Ferrell\u2019s qualifying offer, which made him an unrestricted free agent. However, that move was just a formality, MacMahon writes , as the sides were in the final stages of working out the new deal (which costs Dallas slightly less in annual salary). Here\u2019s more from Charania on the deal Ferrell and the Mavs reached : Last season, Ferrell averaged 10.2 points, three assists and 2.5 rebounds per game as he started 21 of 82 games played for Dallas. Per both ESPN and Yahoo Sports, the Mavs are expected to use the remaining salary cap room they have to give Nowitzki a contract. Here\u2019s more from Charania on that deal : In late June, Nowitzki and the Mavs mutually opted out of his contract for next season to give Dallas more room to make moves in free agency . The Mavs made a sizable splash in free agency this summer as they added former All-Star center DeAndre Jordan . Nowitzki, who has played his entire NBA career with Dallas, became the first international member of the NBA\u2019s 30,000-point club in 2017 . He is the team\u2019s all-time leader in points scored , games played, rebounds, blocks, field goals made and attempted, free throws made and attempted and 3-pointers made and attempted. The Mavericks haven\u2019t won a playoff series since taking the title almost seven years ago, cycling through dozens of roster moves to try to give Nowitzki another shot at a title.

And if Chicago didn\u2019t spend its cap space this summer, well, that doesn\u2019t stack up in a corner to be added to what it can spend in 2019. So even with Parker\u2019s serious injury history ( two ACL ruptures and rehabs ), and the likelihood that Chicago mostly bid against itself for the restricted free agent flexing minimal leverage, the two-year deal with the team option after Year 1 isn\u2019t unreasonable. If the talent and untapped production of a former No. 2 overall pick still resides within Parker, the Bulls are paying for the mining rights on a very short-term lease. No, the investment that people should wonder about is everything around Parker this season. That is, the players and real progress that must not slip as priorities just because the 6-foot-8 forward from Simeon High School will be hitting his reset button at United Center. The Bulls invested heavily in the rebuild they began 13 months ago when they traded All-Star Jimmy Butler for a bundle of potential : springy wing Zach LaVine, combo guard Kris Dunn and rookie forward Lauri Markkanen \u2014 who promptly displayed an upside beyond early expectations. But don\u2019t get it twisted: Last season was awful. The Bulls threw themselves into what was, never mind the euphemisms, a shameless rebuild. It took time, it tested folks\u2019 patience and was terribly embarrassing. * Blogtable:  How does Parker fit into Bulls\u2019 plans? With that bit of ugliness behind them, the Bulls will head to training camp with a lengthy to-do list. On it: sorting out LaVine\u2019s and Dunn\u2019s offense-initiating, plugging their sieve-like defense, plumbing the depths of Markkanen\u2019s talents, advancing rookie Wendell Carter Jr.\u2019s precocious game, boosting their 3-point proficiency and finding another 10 victories at least. All of which sits apart from Parker\u2019s individual agenda. The South Side native is nearly six years removed from the excited gathering as many breathlessly awaited the high school all-American\u2019s college choice. It\u2019s been four years since he and Andrew Wiggins were considered a veritable coin flip for No. 1 overall in the 2014 Draft. That teenager is gone now. He has been replaced at 23 by a veteran, if not of all that many NBA games (183 of a possible 328), at least of some of the league\u2019s and the game\u2019s hurdles, slights and disappointments. Blowing out his left ACL twice and laboring through the lengthy, lonely recoveries was a physical and mental challenge. Coping with the effects that\u2019s had on his impact and career has been more emotional. And ongoing. It wasn\u2019t Parker\u2019s fault that he suffered such devastating injuries. Nor was it the Milwaukee Bucks\u2019 fault. They had hoped to plant Parker on a front line alongside All-Star Giannis Antetokounmpo as pillars of a new Eastern Conference powerhouse. Plan B for the Bucks meant pushing forward with Antetokounmpo, but with players such as Khris Middleton and Eric Bledsoe slotting in behind him in the pecking order. Parker was going to be a bonus when he got off his alternate track, his role to be determined.  Only, he didn\u2019t approach it that way. Whether antsy after so much time in dry dock or nervous about its effect on his looming free agency, Parker pushed for playing time and opportunities. He didn\u2019t slot in. For a team that had fired its coach \u2014 Jason Kidd, with whom Parker chafed \u2014 at midseason and was aching to exhibit tangible progress over 2016-17, Parker pushed on his own behalf. He carped two games into Milwaukee\u2019s first-round playoffs series against the Boston Celtics about his touches. There was a report out of Yahoo! Sports that he was jealous of Antetokounmpo\u2019s primacy with the franchise . Not. Good. Looks. It wasn\u2019t helped, either, by Parker\u2019s play in his third NBA incarnation. When Parker returned the first time, in 2015-16, he was encouragingly solid. Then he got better the next fall, appearing more fit and quick than ever. He averaged 20.1 points in 51 games and generated some All-Star talk before his re-injury. When Parker came last season, he didn\u2019t look as lithe. He averaged 19.5 points in April , but 12.6 points overall in 2017-18 . His turnovers were up, his trips to the line were down and his defensive analytics were as shaky as ever. If Parker\u2019s actions were an emotional shield against the self-doubt a player inevitably faces after two serious injuries, that\u2019s understandable. But if it\u2019s a sense of entitlement and fading status that he brings into Chicago\u2019s locker room, unsupported by his performances and out of sync with the work the Bulls already have begun, that will be a problem. Parker said a few right things about fitting in with his young teammates who have earned their Year 2 in the Bulls\u2019 blueprint. \u201cBeing a part of this new unit is something I admire,\u201d he said at his news conference Wednesday. \u201cJust because we\u2019re the same age, we\u2019re going to build friendships on and off the court. \u2026 Once we grow closer, we get better as a team. \u201cIt\u2019s a relationship, and a relationship is 50-50. So I\u2019m going to learn as much from them as they learn from me.\u201d Parker veered in the wrong direction minutes later, though. He cut himself inappropriate slack \u2014 and possibly set a bad example \u2014 when asked on a midday Chicago sports radio show about his capabilities and responsibilities on defense. \u201cI just stick to my strengths,\u201d he told the hosts at 670 AM The Score. \u201cLook at everybody in the league. They don\u2019t pay players to play defense. \u2026 I\u2019m not going to say that I won\u2019t, but to say that\u2019s a weakness is like saying that\u2019s everybody\u2019s [weakness]. Because I\u2019ve scored in the 30s, the 20s on a lot of guys who say they play defense.\u201d Might Parker get on board with coach Fred Hoiberg\u2019s revamped system \u2014 the Bulls began their work in a pre-Vegas minicamp \u2014 built on the current trend of switching assignments? Said Parker: \u201cYou know that certain guys have [a scoring] average. No matter what you do, they still get that average. So they pay people to score the ball. I would hope that somebody would score the ball on me if they paid them that much. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s a copout or nothing, but it\u2019s the NBA.\u201d His comments make one curious how he\u2019ll react in to Hoiberg\u2019s competition for jobs, formulation of roles and hierarchy for taking last shots. This, on a roster with only one proven veteran, 30-year-old Robin Lopez, to impart lessons and keep the kids in line. This move to the Bulls is swell for Parker: coming home, getting paid, snagging a do-over and stepping onto a bigger stage for his fledgling social activism. The move by the Bulls, though, will turn on Parker\u2019s basketball (more) and bravado (less). It\u2019s on him to fit them. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

The team confirmed the procedure on Thursday, issuing a statement that read : \u201cMichael Porter Jr. has undergone surgery of the lumbar spine at The Carrell Clinic in Dallas, Texas. The Procedure was performed by Dr. Andrew Dossett. There is no timetable for his return to basketball participation.\u201d This latest procedure, according to Porter\u2019s camp, has led to a greater understanding of Porter\u2019s herniated-disks condition, boosting confidence he can move on from the injury and begin his Nuggets career. There is no plan at this point to have him sit out the 2018-19 season. A spokesperson for the Nuggets declined to comment Wednesday but indicated an update on Porter\u2019s health from the team\u2019s medical staff would be given soon. Porter, 19, underwent back surgery in November that limited him to just three appearances in his lone season at the University of Missouri. Considered a potential No. 1 overall pick before the surgery, the 6-foot-10 forward also canceled a workout a week before the draft because of what was termed a hip problem. As a result, Porter had to sit longer than expected on draft night at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn before hearing his name called on the final lottery pick . While Denver felt the risk\/reward equation, based on Porter\u2019s game when healthy, merited their gamble on him, there was speculation almost immediately that he might not play at all this season, spending his rookie year in continued rehab to strengthen and condition his back. Porter signed his multiyear NBA rookie contract earlier this month, with a specified $2.4 million salary for this season. Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

A drastic move like that \u2014 one that allows the Warriors to add another superstar to their already star-stocked starting lineup \u2014 was sure to draw some criticism. Yet for Cousins, he is adamant he doesn\u2019t care what others think about his latest career choice. In the latest teaser for the Showtime documentary he\u2019s working on about his return from injury and free agency choice, the former New Orleans Pelicans big man doesn\u2019t mince words about his move to California. \u201cI knew how it would be perceived by some \u2026 I don\u2019t give a [expletive],\u201d Cousins said in a video released on Twitter yesterday . \u201cThere\u2019s some [expletives] out there that\u2019s ripping their hair out, and I love it. It\u2019s just another test for me to overcome. \u2026 I\u2019m a fighter, I never give up and I\u2019m taking this challenge head on.\u201d In the clip, Cousins explains why he signed with the Warriors and how playing for Golden State would give him the best chance to win as he recovers from his Achilles injury. He is set to have his introductory news conference with the Warriors on Thursday morning. Cousins tore his Achilles in late January and underwent surgery. He has posted regular updates on social media with the hash tags \u201cThe Resurgence\u201d and \u201c0 Doubt.\u201d \u201cThis is my ace of spade, this was my nuclear bomb, my last resort,\u201d Cousins said. \u201cYeah, I could have probably got a contract \u2014 a decent contract \u2014 from a bad team. But how does that help me?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m already fighting a career-ending injury,\u201d Cousins added. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna put myself in an already-bad situation and try to prove my value or my worth as a player in a situation that\u2019s not looking to win.\u201d Before his injury in February, Cousins expected to receive a five-year, $150 million contract extension from the Pelicans. However, that deal did not materialize and Cousins says in the Showtime video clip that he never received an offer from New Orleans once free agency opened. \u201cI understand. They had a big year,\u201d Cousins said in a somewhat sarcastic tone. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to ruin it taking a chance on me. I\u2019m a damaged player. Cool.\u201d Additionally, Cousins said he and his long-time agent, Jarin Akana, reached out to other teams about an offer. But he said they got answers like \u201cwe don\u2019t believe it\u2019s a good fit, or, we gotta see what we\u2019re doing with our roster right now \u2026 just kind of, just, [expletive] answers. And then there were some that were just flat out, like, \u2018we can\u2019t take that risk.\u2019 \u201d Cousins says he talked with Warriors stars Stephen Curry, Draymond Green and Kevin Durant, who all wanted him to come aboard and put him at ease with joining Golden State. Shortly after he agreed to a deal with the Warriors, Cousins spoke at length with The Undefeated\u2019s Marc J. Spears about his decision . He voiced similar things in that interview that he references in his Showtime clip \u2014 the lack of offers once free agency began, the notion of going to an elite team on a cheaper deal and more. According to the Elias Sports Bureau, the Warriors would be the first team since Boston in 1975-76 to play five All-Stars from the previous season at the same time come 2018-19. That group was Jo Jo White, Charlie Scott, Dave Cowens, Paul Silas and John Havlicek. Yahoo Sports\u2019 Shams Charania also reported that the Warriors didn\u2019t quite believe he was truly interested in joining them as contact first began. But talks developed rapidly on July 2, with Charania crediting phone calls from Green (on vacation in Greece), coach Steve Kerr and general manager Bob Myers for sealing an improbable deal almost nobody saw coming.

He had an advantage in the East, where nobody could get buckets like him at the position. John Schuhmann :  There are three locks at Western Conference guard: Stephen Curry, James Harden and Russell Westbrook. Beyond that, DeRozan should be in a group with Jimmy Butler, Damian Lillard, Chris Paul and Klay Thompson, with Donovan Mitchell possibly in the mix.

It was at the James Jordan Boys and Girls Club where his dad was a supervisor and not the nearby United Center. But it sure felt big time to him. \u201cIt was like our United Center, that gym,\u201d he said. Now, the United Center is his home arena. Parker agreed Saturday to a $40 million, two-year contract with the Bulls, hoping he can get his promising career back on track after tearing the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee two times in four seasons with the Milwaukee Bucks. \u201cNo better way to live a dream as a kid than playing down the street from where I grew up \u2013 the James Jordan Boys and Girls Club,\u201d Parker said Wednesday. The son of a former NBA player, Parker seemed destined for big things. He led Simeon Career Academy on Chicago\u2019s South Side to four state championships, graced the cover of Sports Illustrated, and when he committed to Duke, the announcement was televised nationally. A year later, the Bucks drafted him with the No. 2 overall pick, thinking he would help lead them to prominence in the Eastern Conference. But it didn\u2019t quite work out that way. Parker tore his ACL for the first time just 25 games into his rookie season. He was having his best year in 2016-17, averaging 20.1 point and 6.2 rebounds, when he tore the ACL again that February. Parker played in 31 games last year, averaging 12.6 points and 4.9 rebounds. Now, instead of playing in a dynamic combo with Giannis Antetokounmpo and the rest of the Bucks, Parker will try to help a rebuilding team. The Bulls see a talented and versatile 23-year-old who could give them a big boost, assuming he stays healthy. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at it as a great opportunity for our basketball team to improve, for Jabari to be a part of this,\u201d executive vice president of basketball operations John Paxson said. With his ability to score inside and outside, Parker could give the Bulls another potent option to go with Lauri Markkanen and Zach LaVine in coach Fred Hoiberg\u2019s pace-and-space system. Defense could be an issue, particularly when Parker and LaVine are on the court together. But Hoiberg sees them fitting in \u201cvery well\u201d because of their athleticism in a system that emphasizes more switching. Parker insisted he can play at the level he did prior to his second ACL tear, saying he \u201cpretty much\u201d showed it last season, and that the setbacks he has experienced will make him a better player. He also said he plans to reach out to former Bulls star and fellow Simeon product Derrick Rose about suiting up for the hometown team. He jumped to the defense of his fellow South Sider, who went from No. 1 pick to Rookie of the Year to All-Star to MVP before knee injuries derailed his run in Chicago. \u201cDerrick had no lows,\u201d Parker said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t. Because he still maintained. Derrick is a legend, no matter what. I don\u2019t like how you explained that. No rise and falls. Injuries are a part of life. Everybody has an injury, either athletics or normal life. Derrick is one of the best players to ever play the game and one of the best icons of Chicago. He accomplished his duty already.\u201d Parker spoke near the Michael Jordan statue in the concourse of the United Center. And while he certainly understands what arguably the greatest NBA player ever meant to the franchise and the city, he was just born when the Bulls launched their second three-peat. Parker has a strong link to Rose, from starring at Simeon to experiencing knee injuries and now playing for the home team. If he does re-establish himself with the Bulls, it would be something Rose never really was able to do once he tore the ACL in his left knee during the 2012 playoff opener against Philadelphia. For Parker and his family, it was quite a moment.

So something in the 45-50 victory range seems reasonable. Now, given the arms race out West, that might not be enough to get the Spurs into the postseason (it took 47 this spring to qualify). At least in adding DeMar DeRozan to LaMarcus Aldridge, their status as Monsters of the Mid-Range is secure. Tas Melas :  The Spurs are the third best team in the West behind Golden State and Houston . There was a gap between those two teams and the rest and the Spurs just filled it. Two All-Stars plus Gregg Popovich looks like a 50-plus win squad to me. There is a lot of faith in the green Dejounte Murray and in the greying rest of the roster, but the old school mid-range shootin\u2019, high post passin\u2019, draining all that shot clockin\u2019 will be fun to watch. Shaun Powell :  The Spurs are in the middle class , which is where teams usually don\u2019t want to be. They\u2019re not title contenders and at best are title spoilers for someone else. But I\u2019m not sure things would be different had they kept Leonard. John Schuhmann :  If you look at it one way, they\u2019ve replaced Danny Green with DeMar DeRozan on a team that won 47 games last season. They\u2019ve finished in the top five defensively in each of the last six seasons (and in 17 of the last 21), but have lost something on that end of the floor with the departures of Green and Kyle Anderson. Offensively, they should take a step forward with DeRozan, but spacing will be an issue and the DeRozan-LaMarcus Aldridge dynamic could be more of a my-turn-your-turn situation than a cohesive duo. With the amount of isolations that they\u2019ll run and mid-range shots that they\u2019ll attempt, it\u2019s hard to see them ranking in the top 10 on that end of the floor. And of course, the Western Conference is so strong from 1-10 that there\u2019s a chance of the Spurs\u2019 21-year playoff run coming to an end . Sekou Smith :  The Spurs are in much the same space they were last season when Kawhi Leonard played in just nine games and knew they weren\u2019t a serious challenger to the Rockets or the Warriors in the Western Conference. I really like some of the young pieces, especially Dejounte Murray and Lonnie Walker, and what they could become down the road. But the Spurs front office understands where they fit in the bigger picture right now and are taking a very pragmatic approach. * * *"},{"id":39271,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-toronto-raptors-risk-trading-kawhi-leonard","date":"2018-07-18","title":"Blogtable: Assessing the risk the Toronto Raptors took in trading for Kawhi Leonard?","content":" * * * Low, medium or high? How would you assess the risk the Raptors took in trading for Kawhi Leonard?  * * * Steve Aschburner : Medium. Trading away a reliable 20-point scorer is risky, trading away one who seemed happy to play for a franchise in a market that doesn\u2019t naturally entice All-Star level talent is riskier still. If Leonard is just a one-season rental, this will sting. Then again, with all due respect, the Raptors might have concluded after their most recent Eastern Conference elimination that with DeMar DeRozan as their best player, they had topped out. Tas Melas :  Low. This team was going to be disassembled within the next two years anyway. Why not get a superstar in the process? Yes, whether Kawhi ever dons a Raptors uniform is up in the air, but Toronto did well to keep their pick if they\u2019re bad next season, while also hanging on to Delon Wright, OG Anunoby, and Pascal Siakam \u2013 all guys who can shoot the 3 and play multiple positions defensively in today\u2019s switch-happy NBA. This version of the Raptors needed to win this past season if they were going to stay together. DeMar DeRozan has been incredibly loyal to Toronto and is objectively the best Raptor ever, but the NBA can be cut-throat, and getting both younger and better is a no-brainer. Shaun Powell :  High. The chances of Leonard re-signing is perhaps nil; meanwhile, the Raptors sacrificed assets for a rental. But maybe they didn\u2019t want to be stuck with DeRozan\u2019s deal and want to make a run for it in the East without LeBron around to destroy their dreams. John Schuhmann :  Medium. The Raptors have raised their ceiling for the coming season, and maybe 2018-19 provides their best chance of getting to The Finals. They have great depth and versatility, with the potential to be the best defensive team in the league. But, with the chance that Leonard leaves next summer, they\u2019ve lowered their floor for \u201919-20 (the last season on Kyle Lowry\u2019s contract). Sure, they could start restructuring the roster after that, but they\u2019ve possibly shortened their run in the East\u2019s top four and their reputation among players seems to have taken a hit. Sekou Smith :  Low. They didn\u2019t gut the roster to get their hands on Kawhi, even if it is only for one season. They essentially cleared the books for a potential rebuild by parting ways with DeRozan and gave up Jakob Poetl for one of the top five-to-seven players in the league. Masai Ujiri did his business well here. There\u2019s always a little risk when you make these sorts of moves. This was relatively low-risk, in my eyes. If it works out and Kawhi decides Toronto really is the place to be, it\u2019s a home run for Ujiri. If not, you took your shot and move on. * * *"},{"id":39290,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-san-antonio-spurs-toronto-raptors-engaged-serious-talks-kawhi-leonard","date":"2018-07-18","title":"San Antonio Spurs trade Kawhi Leonard to Toronto Raptors for DeMar DeRozan, others","content":" The Kawhi Leonard saga has reached its long-anticipated conclusion. The Toronto Raptors have traded star guard DeMar DeRozan to the San Antonio Spurs for Leonard , a former two-time Kia Defensive Player of the Year and Finals MVP winner. Spurs veteran Danny Green is also headed to the Raptors with Leonard while the Spurs get DeRozan, center Jakob Poeltl and a protected first-round pick in 2019. The Spurs and Raptors both officially announced the deal on Wednesday, just after noon ET. Spurs coach Gregg Popovich spoke with the media later that afternoon and addressed the trade. \u201cWe wish him well as he moves into Toronto. I think he\u2019ll be great,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cI think this trade is going to work out great for both teams. We wish [Leonard] well, but at this point it\u2019s time to move on. It\u2019s time to move on. \u201cKawhi is not going to stop being a great player. But we\u2019re thrilled with DeMar. \u2026 To get back a proven NBA player and a proven All-Star, we have to be thrilled.\u201d As for dealing Green, Popovich said: \u201cIt was hard, he\u2019s become a good player. He\u2019ll enjoy Toronto.\u201d Popovich, who also serves as coach of Team USA Basketball, also said he expects Leonard to be in Las Vegas next week for Team USA\u2019s minicamp and that he is \u201clooking forward\u201d to coaching Leonard there. A recent ESPN report that the seven-year forward is considering participating in the minicamp next week . Per ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski, the Raptors and Spurs had been discussing a trade for a while now . A source tells Turner Sports\u2019 David Aldridge a long-term stay in Toronto past the 2018-19 season for Leonard is going to be \u201ca very tough sell.\u201d As word of the trade circulated the NBA social media atmosphere early this morning, DeRozan took to Instagram and posted a story there that read: \u201cBe told one thing & the outcome another. Ain\u2019t no loyalty in this game. Sell you out for a quick bit of nothing \u2026 Soon you\u2019ll understand \u2026 Don\u2019t disturb.\u201d Aldridge reports ( via Twitter ) that DeRozan is not backing off his claim that Toronto lied to him. * Aldridge:  Neither player happy with offseason trade News of the reported deal broke early Wednesday as the Raptors and Spurs reportedly engaged in serious talks involving the Raptors acquiring the two-time Kia Defensive Player of the Year and former NBA Finals MVP Leonard. The details of the trade were still being worked out early Wednesday, but centered on Leonard and DeRozan, writes Yahoo Sports\u2019 Shams Charania : Per Haynes (via Twitter), Leonard reportedly has no desire to play in Toronto . And Yahoo Sports\u2019 Jordan Schultz reports (via Twitter) that the Raptors were hesitant to include young swingman OG Agunoby in any Leonard-DeRozan swaps . DeRozan had spent his entire career with the Raptors (2010-18), emerging as one of the top guards in the Eastern Conference. Since making his first of his four career All-Star berths in 2013-14, DeRozan has averaged 23.4 points, 4.5 rebounds and 4.2 assists per game in that span. He was named to the All-NBA second team this season and was All-NBA third team in 2016-17. Last season, he averaged 23.4 ppg while improving a key facet of his game by hitting a career-high 89 3-pointers . He has three years and and $83 million left on his contract, including an Early Termination Option for the 2020-21 season. Leonard\u2019s future has been a subject of league-wide fascination ever since it was first reported he wanted to leave the only team for which he has played. Despite attempts by the Spurs \u2014 including a try by Popovich \u2014 to mend the relationship , Leonard and his camp have steadfastly maintained their distance as the offseason has worn on. The strain between Leonard and San Antonio built throughout the 2017-18 campaign as the former 15th overall pick dealt with a quad injury that kept him from playing in all but nine games. The unusual recovery time was compounded by his physical separation from the team, as Leonard continued his rehab in New York. His absence was especially notable during the Spurs\u2019 first-round playoff exit to the Golden State Warriors. Leonard was then spotted at a Los Angeles Dodgers home game three weeks later. DeRozan is the Raptors\u2019 all-time leader in points scored (13,296) , games played (675), field goals made (4,716) and attempted (10,532) as well as free throws made (3,359) and attempted (4,277). He also ranks third all-time in assists (2,078) and second all-time in steals (655). The Raptors went through a series of changes in the offseason after they were swept in the Eastern Conference semifnials by the Cleveland Cavaliers. Coach Dwane Casey \u2014 the NBA\u2019s Coach of the Year \u2014 was fired days after that playoff exit and was eventually replaced by Raptors assistant coach Nick Nurse . Shortly after Casey\u2019s firing, Raptors GM Masai Ujiri said roster changes could be afoot for the team. But, he was quick to point out the timetable for those changes were hardly known at that point. \u201cIt is something we\u2019re looking at \u2026 not saying this roster is perfect,\u201d Ujiri said then. \u201cThings we need to do and I need to do to get better. Roster changes is not something I can change today. Sometimes [it takes] takes 2 months, sometimes a year, sometimes two years.\u201d Los Angeles had long been reported as Leonard\u2019s preferred destination.

The Spurs traded Leonard, the 2014 Finals MVP, two-time Defensive Player of the Year and two-time All-Star, along with veteran guard Danny Green, to the Toronto Raptors for four-time All-Star DeMar DeRozan, second-year big man Jakob Poeltl and a 2019 first-round Draft pick, which is protected from 1-12 next year. In doing so, San Antonio ended a relationship with the player that was poised to be the Spurs\u2019 next lynchpin, but who had grown disenchanted with the franchise and wanted out. Leonard wanted to be traded to Los Angeles, closer to his hometown of Moreno Valley, Calif. He preferred the Lakers, and made that known in June , but was not averse to playing with the LA Clippers. However, the Spurs were adamant that they would not trade him to a Western Conference team , even though there was a strong likelihood that he would only stay with any team that traded for him until next year. That is when he would likely opt out of his contract, become a free agent and go to Los Angeles. Even though the 27-year-old Leonard told the Raptors in conversations between Toronto and his camp over the last week that he did not want to go there, the Raptors were willing to take the chance, anyway. DeRozan sought assurances from the Raptors that he wasn\u2019t being moved in recent days. Both he and his representatives met with Raptors officials during NBA Summer League in Las Vegas, according to a source, at which time Toronto insisted that it wasn\u2019t going to trade him. Now, DeRozan feels \u201clied to,\u201d the source said, and, while having no personal grudges with the Spurs, is extremely upset at the deal. https:\/\/twitter.com\/daldridgetnt\/status\/1019571781147987968 Leonard also is not happy at going to Toronto, for several reasons, including the higher taxation rate in Canada than in Texas, which has no state income tax. Leonard\u2019s camp had informed the Spurs he didn\u2019t want to go there, but the Spurs made no promises either way. San Antonio had had significant discussions with the Philadelphia 76ers \u2014 a team Leonard would have given a fair shake at convincing him to stay had it been able to make a deal with San Antonio. But the 76ers were unwilling to include guard Markelle Fultz, the former first pick overall in the 2017 Draft , or forward Dario Saric in any package proposals for Leonard. Leonard only played in nine games last season , citing an injured quad muscle that did not respond to treatment. But privately, Leonard was unhappy with what he thought was bad advice from the Spurs\u2019 medical staff , and sought advice from his own group of doctors, removing himself from San Antonio to continue treatments in New York as the regular season ended and playoffs began. The Spurs did not push Leonard during his rehab, and referred questions about his status during their first-round series with the Golden State Warriors to his camp. Leonard\u2019s uncle has acted as his agent for the last couple of years. Spurs coach Gregg Popovich informed Leonard\u2019s camp of the trade early Wednesday in what was deemed a \u201ccordial\u201d conversation, according to a source. However, given the trade, Leonard is now contemplating not taking part in next week\u2019s USA Basketball minicamp in Las Vegas. A final decision has not yet been made. For his part, the 28-year-old DeRozan let his feelings be known in an Instagram post early Wednesday , saying in part, \u201cAin\u2019t no loyalty in this game\u201d after being dealt from the only team he\u2019s played for in nine NBA seasons, and for whom he has been nothing but a first-class ambassador. The Raptors took DeRozan with the ninth pick in the 2009 Draft , during which time DeRozan became the franchise\u2019s leader in several categories, including games, points and minutes played. He grew as the franchise did, helping lead it to the most successful period in its history alongside his close friend and All-Star teammate, Kyle Lowry. The backcourt did ads together, took vacations together with family and led Toronto to franchise records for wins, reaching the Eastern Conference finals in 2016 . At every turn, DeRozan expressed happiness at playing for and living in Toronto, even as he had to make several cross-country trips last season to be with his ailing father in Los Angeles . DeRozan remade his game as part of the \u201cculture reset\u201d demanded by general manager Masai Ujiri after Toronto was beaten in the playoffs by LeBron James and the Cavaliers in 2017 \u2014 a familiar outcome, as James and Cleveland beat the Raptors in three straight postseasons. DeRozan relied less on isolation sets than he had in years past, trying to move more without the ball and give it up so others could be more involved. Toronto won a franchise-best 59 regular season games last season and was the top seed in the Eastern Conference. However, Toronto suffered another playoff loss to Cleveland, this time a 4-0 sweep . It was especially galling considering the Cavaliers had been extended to a seventh game in their first-round series with Indiana , yet still managed to rally from a double-digit deficit to shock the Raptors in Game 1 in Toronto . The Cavs then cruised the rest of the way in the series. Ujiri fired coach Dwane Casey afterward , ultimately picking assistant coach Nick Nurse as Casey\u2019s successor . But the reset of the team wasn\u2019t complete. The Raptors believe strongly in their young core group of players, all of whom have been developed by Toronto the last few seasons \u2014 guards Fred Van Vleet and Delon Wright, forward O.G. Anunoby and big man Pascal Siakham. Toronto initially opted to keep its existing vets around the kids, giving DeRozan a five-year, $138 million extension in 2016 , then giving Lowry and forward Serge Ibaka extensions last summer \u2013 Lowry got a three-year, $100 million deal and Ibaka got a three-year, $65 million deal. However, after the latest playoff debacle, the Raptors let it be known around the Draft that none of their players were untouchable. If Toronto can get Leonard on board, the Raptors would have a potentially dynamic defensive group on the wings, with Leonard and Anunoby capable of guarding multiple positions. Ibaka isn\u2019t the defender he was in Oklahoma City, where he was first team all-Defensive three years in a row, but he\u2019s still a plus defender at his position. The 31-year-old Green is entering the final year of his contract. Long considered one of the best two-way guards in the game, Green was outstanding in the Spurs\u2019 seven-game loss to the Heat in the 2013 Finals , making 27 3-pointers in the series en route to setting a Finals record . Poeltl, 22, was taken ninth overall by Toronto in the 2016 Draft . He worked his way quickly into the Raptors\u2019 rotation, averaging 6.9 points and 4.8 rebounds last season. * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

Neither is Chicago, which is why the Bulls have the second-year option on him. But it\u2019s not a bad gamble. Parker\u2019s got some real talent, and a one or two-year flier on him is fine for a rebuilding team like the Bulls. They\u2019re convinced he can play the three. I guess we\u2019ll all find out together. Steve Aschburner : Good question. Adding talent is nice, especially if it can stay healthy (which Parker hasn\u2019t). But Chicago already had some \u201cfit\u201d issues to sort out between Zach LaVine and Kris Dunn, who played just 11 games together last season and weren\u2019t great at sharing the basketball. Now the Bulls have added Parker, who also is a ball dominator. Parker didn\u2019t always seem comfortable with his injury layoff-induced place a few rungs down in Milwaukee\u2019s pecking order, either, so the Bulls need to make sure he doesn\u2019t step on LaVine\u2019s, Dunn\u2019s, Lauri Markkanen\u2019s, Wendell Carter Jr.\u2019s or any other teammate\u2019s development. And then there\u2019s Parker defense, assuming you can find it. Tas Melas :  Offensively, fantastic! Parker is an incredible talent. What\u2019s worrisome is with Lauri Markkanen, Bobby Portis, Wendell Carter Jr., Robin Lopez and Cristiano Felicio, it is unlikely Parker will play his ideal spot at the four. That means he\u2019ll get most of his minutes at small forward, which will hurt Chicago defensively. That being said, the move is undoubtedly a smart one. With the Bulls under the salary cap floor, assigning cap space to a very skilled player who is playing for his next big contract, and in turn, could be flipped for an asset this season or next, is a good use of the space. Shaun Powell :  Parker\u2019s situation is perplexing. The Bulls are flirting with a log jam at forward, depending on how and where they choose to play each one. Is Wendell Carter Jr. a power forward or center? Lauri Markkanen small or big? Chandler Hutchison a guard or small forward? Parker brings much the same in terms of front-line flexibility, and somehow the Bulls must find a way to juggle the minutes. Competition will determine who gets what and Parker will get his chance to show he\u2019s worth a longer term deal. John Schuhmann :  Parker is best suited to play the four, which makes it a weird fit with Lauri Markannen seemingly set to hold down the power forward position in Chicago for the next several years. Of course, it\u2019s not clear that Parker is a good fit anywhere right now. He isn\u2019t an eager shooter from the perimeter, he\u2019s not much of a playmaker, and he isn\u2019t the defender that he could be given his size and mobility. But it\u2019s been said that a player needs 18 months after an ACL tear before he\u2019s 100 percent, and next month will make it 18 months since Parker\u2019s second tear (same for Zach LaVine). The jury is still out on what kind of player he can be, but Parker is still just 23 years old and should be better next season.  Sekou Smith :  I think he\u2019ll fit in just fine. I\u2019ve been blown away by all of the people willing to wash their hands of the 23-year-old forward. He\u2019s still just a pup in this league. Yes, he has had injury issues that would make anyone cringe. And there are pressures playing in your hometown that can be too much for some guys. But I believe there is still some of the bounce and fire in him that will make him a nice addition for the Bulls as they try to climb back into the Eastern Conference playoff mix. He\u2019s got an excellent work ethic and hasn\u2019t come close to polishing off his game yet. I believe in Parker and Zach LaVine as building blocks for the Bulls\u2019 immediate future. Plus, they\u2019re both going into this season with huge chips on their shoulders, courtesy of all their haters. Motivation shouldn\u2019t be a problem for coach Fred Hoiberg and his staff. * * *"},{"id":39289,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-rookie-you-are-most-eager-see-2018-19-season","date":"2018-07-18","title":"Blogtable: Rookies you're most eager to see in 2018-19 season?","content":" * * * Rookies you\u2019re most eager to see on the big stage come October?  * * * David Aldridge :  The top 3-5, obviously, but I also want to see how Kevin Knox handles the spotlight in New York .

Knox has talent, but like any human, he\u2019s going to have times of struggle and frustration. Can he manage those times with aplomb? If he gets through this year I think the skies brighten considerably for his long-term success there. Steve Aschburner :  There are three in particular who intrigue me. First, the Knicks\u2019 Kevin Knox , just to see if his play in Las Vegas and the tabloid hoopla over it transfers to the other city that never sleeps. Cleveland\u2019s Collin Sexton gets to show if he\u2019s as capable of stepping into his new team\u2019s LeBron James vacuum as Kyrie Irving was in 2011. And of course, Dallas Luka Doncic , the Slovenian wonder boy, remains a blank slate who might or might not be ready for his close-up. Tas Melas :  Too many to name! Will Jaren Jackson Jr. be the best player in the draft? Can Collin Sexton make Cavs fans forget a little about LeBron? Does Wendell Carter Jr. steal a starting spot in Chicago? Will Luka Doncic maintain his \u201cmost ready player in the Draft\u201d status? Will Shai Gilgeous-Alexander be this year\u2019s Donovan Mitchell? Will Michael Porter Jr. play? Will this class be regarded as one of the best ever? Summer League has me drinking the 2018 Draft Kool-Aid. Shaun Powell :  My answer is Luka Doncic only because he\u2019s largely a mystery, having spent his young pro career in Europe and he also missed NBA summer league. Also, the Mavericks\u2019 draft-day trade with the Hawks, who took Trae Young, makes everyone wonder which team did the right thing. Even though the final verdict on that trade won\u2019t be known for years; remember, the Hawks also got a top-five protected first rounder. John Schuhmann :  1. Luka Doncic \u2014 A 6-7 playmaker could be the next big thing. 2. Kevin Knox \u2014 Showed signs of being a big, do-it-all wing (and an ideal complement to Kristaps Porzingis) at Summer League.<br \/> 3. Harry Giles \u2014 The No. 20 pick in the 2017 Draft was once the No. 1 player in his class. He sat out all of last season, but had some moments at Summer League, with the potential to be a disruptive force on defense. Sekou Smith :  I know he doesn\u2019t count, but I\u2019d include Markelle Fultz in the category of rookies I cannot wait to see on the big stage in October. As for the \u201creal\u201d rookies, how can anyone deny the intrigue that Luka Doncic brings to the party? If he\u2019s as good as his international profile at age 19 suggests, we\u2019re talking about a future Hall of Famer. Trae Young\u2019s rough start had me worried, but he came on as the summer season wore on and showed some serious NBA-level chops. I still want to see what it looks like when the big boys show up. Kevin Knox was easily the most surprising rookie for me during the summer season. I had no idea his game was as fluid as it appeared to be in Las Vegas. Like Knicks fans everywhere, I want to see if how he holds up under the brightest of lights. * * *"},{"id":39293,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-best-free-agents-still-market-2018-offseason","date":"2018-07-18","title":"Blogtable: Who are the best free agents still on the market?","content":" * * * Who are the best free agents still on the market?  * * * UPDATE: Marcus Smart officially re-signed with the Celtics on July 19 David Aldridge :  Obviously, the restricted free agents with nowhere to go \u2014 Clint Capela and Marcus Smart , to name the top two \u2014 are the prime names remaining. But it seems unlikely anyone will be able to pry them from their incumbent teams. Among the unrestricted free agents, while there are a lot of vets still out there, like Al Jefferson, Michael Beasley and Nick Young, I like David Nwaba , the forward that the Bulls made a UFA to facilitate the Jabari Parker deal. Nwaba is a big time effort guy who could play in anyone\u2019s rotation without needing to call any plays for him, and he won\u2019t bust your budget, either. I think Patrick McCaw also has some real potential, and the fact he came back to play in the Finals was a great sign he\u2019s okay physically after that scary fall at the end of the regular season. Steve Aschburner : Give me Clint Capela, Marcus Smart or Rodney Hood , probably in that order. Each of them is technically a free agent but only of the \u201crestricted\u201d variety, which actually isn\u2019t all that free. Money got spent fast, limiting their chances of landing fat offer sheets, so their most recent teams have the leverage. Here\u2019s another guy who ought to have a more vibrant market: Montrezl Harrell , the 24-year-old backup big man who \u2014 per 36 minutes \u2014 averaged 23.3 points and 8.5 rebounds for the Clippers last season Tas Melas :  Clint Capela. He is absolutely one of the best in the game defensively, especially in today\u2019s switching NBA. It\u2019s wild to think that a player who was reportedly offered four years and $85 million only a few days ago is still available. And, much love for the old school Marcus Smart . No one knows his position, but every team would want to figure it out. Shaun Powell :  You can start with Clint Capela , who figured heavily in Houston\u2019s rotation last season and is just touching his prime, but is $20 million-plus peer season too rich for a team giving heavy paychecks to James Harden and Chris Paul? Then there\u2019s Marcus Smart , who surely feels burned by (a) the market this summer, and (b) the lack of urgency by the Celtics to lavish him with big money. Boston wants Smart of course but also must keep the payroll flexible enough to extend Kyrie Irving, Jaylen Brown and Jason Tatum in the coming years. As with Capela, you can\u2019t pay everyone.  John Schuhmann :  1. Clint Capela (restricted) \u2014 The third most important player on the second best team in the league. You have to think the Rockets and Capela will work something out, but it\u2019s starting to get late. 2. Marcus Smart (restricted) \u2014 It\u2019s tough to determine the value of a guard who can\u2019t shoot but makes \u201cwinning plays,\u201d and maybe Smart has more value in Boston than he does elsewhere. He still looks like a candidate to accept the one-year qualifying offer. 3. Montrezl Harrell (restricted) \u2014 Another athletic big man who played really well off the bench for the Clippers last season. Finding an unrestricted free agent that can play more than a small role off the bench is difficult at this point. Michael Beasley and Nick Young offer the most talent, but both can be erratic and each is a liability on defense. Sekou Smith :  Clint Capela is at the top of my list . After watching Capela do work in the Western Conference playoffs last season (outplaying Karl-Anthony Towns and Rudy Gobert in successive series), it became clear to me just how dynamic and how great a fit Capela was with both James Harden and Chris Paul. His ability as both a rim-protector and position defender bolstered my opinion of Capela, who prior to last season would not have been on my short list of elite NBA big men. Next on my list is Jamal Crawford . Yes, Jamal Crawford. He\u2019s a game-changer as a sixth man, even this deep into his career. He might not be the defender Marcus Smart is, but he\u2019s instant offense off your bench and as his peers around the league voted him last month, the best teammate anyone could ask for. Smart rounds out the top three on my list ."},{"id":39277,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-golden-state-warriors-stephen-curry-miss-team-usa-mini-camp","date":"2018-07-18","title":"Report: Stephen Curry out, but Kawhi Leonard may attend Team USA minicamp","content":"Team USA\u2019s minicamp begins next week in Las Vegas as one of the first official steps in the squad\u2019s preparation for the 2019 FIBA World Cup.

It\u2019s rare to see a championship game decided in wire-to-wire fashion, but that\u2019s what happened here. Portland set the tone early, as the Blazers rode a 31-19 first quarter to victory. The Trail Blazers held a double-digit lead for the final three quarters while leading by at least 15 points for the entirety of the fourth quarter. The shooting differential was key, with Portland connecting on 49.4 percent from the field and 34.8 percent from 3-point range while holding the Lakers to just 39.1 percent from the field and 14.3 percent from long range. Offensive rebounding was also a huge factor, with Portland winning that battle, 10-4. Additionally, Portland recorded five more assists than Los Angeles while committing five fewer turnovers. The Trail Blazers (7-0) had six players reach double figures in scoring, with K.J. McDaniels leading the team with 17 points and seven rebounds on 8-of-14 shooting off the bench. Wade Baldwin IV led the starters with 14 points, four rebounds and six assists. Caleb Swanigan collected six points, nine rebounds and five assists, while Archie Goodwin contributed 10 points, seven rebounds, two assists and two steals.  The Lakers (6-1) got a disappointing performance from the Summer League MVP, as Josh Hart went just 3 of 12 from the field to finish with 12 points, two rebounds and two assists before being ejected in the fourth quarter due to two quick technicals for complaining. Svi Mykhailiuk also struggled, scoring just 10 points on 3-of-10 shooting. Jeff Ayres was the only other Laker in double figures, as he tallied 11 points, one assist and one steal.

Per team policy, terms of the agreement were not released. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to have Steve under contract and poised to lead our team for the next several years,\u201d said Warriors President of Basketball Operations\/General Manager Bob Myers. \u201cUnder his guidance, we\u2019ve been fortunate enough to win three NBA titles in four years and his ability to thrive in all facets of his job is certainly a primary reason for our success. He\u2019s a terrific coach, but more importantly an incredible human being.\u201d Under Kerr, the Warriors have won three NBA Championships in four seasons, joining Phil Jackson (1991, 1992, 1993) and John Kundla (1949, 1950, 1951) as the only head coaches in NBA history to win three titles in their first four seasons at the helm. Kerr owns a playoff mark of 63-20 (.759), the highest winning percentage in NBA history amongst head coaches who have coached a minimum of 25 playoff games, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. The franchise has recorded 58-or-more regular season wins in each of his four seasons, joining the Celtics (1961-62 \u2013 1964-65 & 1983-84 \u2013 1986-87), Bucks (1970-71 \u2013 1973-74), 76ers (1979-80 \u2013 1982-83) and Lakers (1984-85 \u2013 1987-88) as the only teams to accomplish the feat. Kerr has an overall regular season record of 265-63 (.808), the best four-year run in NBA history. The Warriors have claimed the Pacific Division crown in four-consecutive seasons under Kerr, who along with Pat Riley is the only other coach in NBA history to win their division in each of the first four seasons as head coach. Originally named to the position on May 19, 2014, Kerr is the 25th head coach in franchise history and the 20th since the team moved to the West Coast in 1962. He is the fourth Warriors coach to win an NBA title, joining Eddie Gottlieb (1947), George Senesky (1956) and Alvin Attles (1975). He is also just the third coach in franchise history to be named Coach of the Year (2015-16), joining Alex Hannum (1963-64) and Don Nelson (1991-92). Kerr, who won five NBA championships during a 15-year playing career, owns eight championships overall as either a player or coach, becoming the first to win at least three NBA titles as a player and three as a head coach. The NBA\u2019s all-time three-point percentage leader, having converted on 45.4 percent (726-of-1599) of his attempts from long range, Kerr amassed career averages of 6.0 points, 1.8 assists and 1.2 rebounds in 910 regular-season games with the Phoenix Suns, Cleveland Cavaliers, Orlando Magic, Chicago Bulls, San Antonio Spurs (twice), and Portland Trail Blazers. A native of Beirut, Lebanon, who grew up in Pacific Palisades, Calif., Kerr played four seasons at the University of Arizona, helping lead the Wildcats to their first Final Four appearance during his senior season in 1988. An All-Pac 10 guard in both 1986 and 1988, he remains the school\u2019s career leader in three-point field goal percentage (57.3).

In the heat of the moment, which had everything to do with basketball and nothing to do with the 102-degree temperature outside, this was competition. This was the NBA (or close to it), this was winning vs. losing. John Lucas Jr., coach of the Minnesota Timberwolves\u2019 entry in the NBA Summer League, wanted his way. Sean Sweeney, working the sideline for the Detroit Pistons\u2019 squad, did too. In the middle, in the dwindling seconds of the teams\u2019 tight finish last week, was referee Natalie Sago. Geographically, Sago was near the Wolves bench, facing in the opposite direction when Lucas Jr. erupted behind her. \u201cI got excited because I knew we had a timeout left and it was a big possession,\u201d Lucas Jr. said a few minutes later, calm having subbed in for chaos by then. \u201cSo I was trying to call a timeout. I felt like we had possession. I was yelling \u2018Timeout! Timeout!\u2019 \u201d Only thing was, Lucas had ventured into no coach\u2019s land. Oh, and his team didn\u2019t have possession after all. \u201cI just turned around and put my hands up,\u201d Sago said. \u201cHe really wanted it, and when I looked, he was two or three steps out on the court. \u201cI said, \u2018Please get back.\u2019 And then their whole bench reacted. They wanted the timeout or a foul. I said, \u2018No more bench reaction.\u2019 \u201d From the far end of the floor, here\u2019s how it looked: Sago dwarfed by a wall of a half dozen young men a foot or more taller, with Lucas Jr. to her right, barking in her ear. Then Sweeney got into the act. \u201cThe Detroit coach is standing at halfcourt with his hands up,\u201d Sago recalled. \u201cHe\u2019s wondering why I haven\u2019t called Minnesota for a \u2018coach on the floor\u2019 technical. So I looked at him and said, \u2018I would do the same for you.\u2019 And then everything was fine.\u201d Order was restored. The game resumed and soon ended. The outcome didn\u2019t swing on that one heated exchange. \u201cIt was a great conversation,\u201d said Sago, who trained and studied at Summer League \u2013 after three seasons each in the G League and the WNBA \u2014 with the goal of breaking into the NBA in 2018-19. \u201cA great going-back-and-forth. At the end, he [Lucas] smiled, I smiled. So we both knew, \u2018We\u2019re having fun out here and we\u2019re human.\u2019\u201d There was, however, one detail in need of explanation. As Sago turned back to the action, Lucas reached out and gave her a pat on the\u2026 Hip? There are afternoons and evenings at Summer League when you\u2019d swear there are more referees in the gym than basketball players, and you\u2019d be right. There were 81 game officials assigned to work NBA Summer League, with a bevy of NBA referee executives, consultants and retired and active veterans on hand as supervisors and instructors. This is as much the Las Vegas Officiating Summer Camp as it is an intro to the league for rookies and others. And every morning, in a hotel ballroom over continental breakfast, longtime NBA ref Monty McCutchen \u2014 a year into his managerial role as vice president and head of referee development and training \u2014 leads a 90-minute training session. One day, NBA.com was invited into the meeting. \u201cThis is an important part of your life,\u201d McCutchen told the referees in attendance, about halfway through last week\u2019s schedule. \u201cSo you might be nervous. It\u2019s OK to have some nerves. It is not OK to not try to work through it and get to the work. How do we get through it? Get to the fundamentals.\u201d These daily gatherings are instructional classes as well as morning huddles with heavy doses of motivation, psychology, energy, introspection and pep talks. They represent what might be considered the modern era for NBA referees. For much of its first four or five decades, the league\u2019s atmosphere of officiating was casual, even loose as far as the tone set from night to night by that game\u2019s crew chief. Then came an era of intense oversight and an apparent effort to wring all personality out of the officials. Refs were instructed to roam the floor like salt-and-pepper shirted Roombas, keeping interactions with the players and coaches to a minimum. \u201cRefereeing at times has been limited to just talking about mechanics and where to stand,\u201d McCutchen said after one session last week. \u201cThat\u2019s not really what goes on when you\u2019re actually working a game. You have to deal with your own sets of emotions and how you set those aside to do professional work. \u201cI would say it\u2019s akin to playing an instrument. You can learn the notes. That doesn\u2019t mean you make music. My kids do violin, and if they\u2019re still thinking about where to put their fingers, they\u2019re not making music.\u201d  That\u2019s why some of the comments and questions McCutchen posed from the front of the vast room were about the referees themselves, not merely the in-game events they reviewed on a projection screen. Here\u2019s a sampling: \u2014 \u201cAn overwhelming amount of our errors come from a feeling that when something looks ugly, we somehow feel a responsibility as an official that it must be illegal. The pressure builds up inside of us of, \u2018I don\u2019t want to miss something.\u2019 You must get comfortable being uncomfortable if you want to be a well-disciplined official.\u201d \u2014 \u201cA disciplined official is a high-accuracy official. Notice how I did not say they were a perfect official. There is no such thing.\u201d When McCutchen wasn\u2019t going frame-by-frame through games, he was off to the side, where a makeshift basketball court had been taped out on the ballroom carpet. He spotted of the importance of an \u201coutside-in view\u201d of plays (rather than getting caught up inside of them) and the ideal of standing \u201cflat and tight\u201d when positioned in the half court. \u2014 \u201cRefereeing defense is an interesting concept. If we telescope in and only referee the defense, we\u2019re only seeing half the play. You must have a contextual relationship between the defender and the offensive player.\u201d \u2014 \u201cOK, how do offensive players work? They work off jab steps, they work off spins, they work off crossovers, they go through their legs \u2014 all designed to take the defender on a 1-on-1 move.\u201d \u2014 \u201cWho has to be legal first? Defense.\u201d There was an expected emphasis on Xs and Os, but there was a fair amount of nuance, in the discussions, too. \u2014 \u201cUgly plays still can be fouls. Say there\u2019s a foul and then a flop afterwards. How do we handle that? You\u2019re running the game. People need to know you know he flopped. So call the foul because he\u2019s earned it. And then say, \u2018I don\u2019t need your extra help.\u2019 So that everyone, including him, doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s because he flopped.\u201d \u2014 \u201cWhen we\u2019re the primary, what do we want to be calling? Strikes down the middle. We\u2019re not painting the edges.\u201d \u2014 \u201cHere\u2019s a statistic you might find interesting: Our best secondary calls are worse in percentages than our worst primary calls. Let that sink in. What it means is, when we go into our secondary areas of coverage, \u2018Is my judgment better than someone else\u2019s judgment?\u2019 \u201d McCutchen spoke at length about game awareness, urging the young referees to immerse themselves in media coverage of the NBA to better understand its backstories. Which players get physical? Are there players on the floor that night who are harboring a grudge against an opponent? All of it needs to be factored into the refs\u2019 game awareness. The boss recalled for them one official who didn\u2019t pay attention to the NBA as closely as he had pretended. \u201cWe were talking and I asked him, \u2018Are you going to watch the games tonight?\u2019 And he said, \u2018Yeah. What channel are they on?\u2019 And it was a Thursday night \u2013 they\u2019d only been on TNT on Thursdays for about 20 years.\u201d McCutchen occasionally called on refs in his audience to share their views of a play. The videos made for a vibrant laboratory, with some of the league\u2019s most senior and respected referees not spared from second-guessing up on the big screen. \u2014 \u201cEarly decision-making is bad. It doesn\u2019t allow us to be a discerner. If we\u2019re a discerner, we have air in our belly, not up in our throat. How do you check that? If your tongue is between the whistle, you\u2019re not in the right place.\u201d \u2014 \u201cWe have to know who the most aggressive people are on the floor, and we all know, steals steal back. Right? He\u2019s embarrassed. The player who\u2019s just had the ball stolen becomes the most aggressive player in the room. We don\u2019t pick on him. But it means we are aware that he is our problem at this point.\u201d \u2014 \u201cBecause everybody has 10 fouls in this [Summer] League, what are we seeing after every turnover? Take a foul. They don\u2019t want to be yelled at about giving up two points.\u201d A couple of late-game situations were used to illustrate the unintended consequences a hasty or tardy decision can have on the outcome of an NBA game. The spotlight will only intensify on such moments as legal sports gambling becomes more embraced by the United States\u2019 pro sports leagues. McCutchen played and replayed footage from a one-point game with slightly more than 10 seconds remaining. It was a situation in which the defensive team might start out trying to steal the ball in a trap but, failing that, immediately shift into foul mode. A ref must shift just as swiftly, without blowing the whistle too soon on the former or too late on the latter. \u201cSo, 10.4 [seconds left]. Trap. He\u2019s able to break it! Then one foul, two fouls \u2026 three fouls. Freeze it! Look at the difference in the game from our lack of attention to detail.\u201d The game clock that should have been stopped with 6.7 seconds, after the first swipe at the ballhandler, rather than at 1.7 seconds after the third swipe. \u2014 \u201cWe want the game to move slow for officials. It\u2019s not just about seeing a play. It\u2019s about seeing it and then adjudicating it properly.\u201d \u2014 \u201cSprint to the baseline. \u2026 Why is it important to get to the baseline in a sprint? It allows you to settle in, take a breath and find your area.\u201d Some less-experienced NBA officials were participating in Summer League, too, hoping to hone their skills so they can serve as future crew chiefs. McCutchen focused for a segment on that, stressing the aura of teamwork that gets set \u2014 or not \u2014 by the game\u2019s senior official. \u2014 \u201cAs crew chief, you\u2019re worrying about \u2018crew accuracy\u2019 for the game. First of all, we have to acknowledge that [on a given play] you might be wrong. \u2026 Don\u2019t speed up other officials\u2019 whistles. Empower your partners.\u201d \u2014 \u201cIf you don\u2019t know, we look [at the slot] official. If they don\u2019t know, they what? They look at the trail. And if the trail doesn\u2019t know, what does the trail do? Jump ball. And it happens like that! It\u2019s look-look-look-point, all in a nanosecond. \u2018We are a team.\u2019 \u201d \u2014 \u201cIt is not embarrassing to go to center court and call a jump ball. \u2018How can you not see that?\u2019 You say, \u2018I didn\u2019t see it.\u2019 When you start guessing, you\u2019re not very good.\u201d At the end of the 90-minute session, referees who didn\u2019t have early games to work were invited to stay and review more video with veterans and retired officials such as Joey Crawford, Bennett Salvatore, Bernie Fryer and Mark Wunderlich. More than 20 stuck around. Nineteen of the 81 referees in Las Vegas this summer are female. And more than half of the new refs hired for the 2018-19 G League season are female. So McCutchen\u2019s class was decidedly co-ed. Earlier in the week, NBA commissioner Adam Silver had spoken proudly of the new direction, which will be noticeable in a league that had just one female ref last season (and Lauren Holtkamp might be out for a while after suffering a knee injury in a late-spring game.) \u201cThere is no physical reason why that\u2019s the case,\u201d Silver said of Holtkamp as the lone woman. \u201cIt\u2019s just the way things have grown up in the league, but we\u2019re determined to change that as quickly as possible. [We] have gone out and really doubled down on the recruitment of women into the officiating ranks.\u201d  Sago might be one to crack an NBA crew\u2019s lineup this season. The 29-year-old from Farmington, Mo., played Division II softball, but grew up as the daughter of a preps and college basketball ref. Her love of the game grew when she would ride with him to and from games, sitting by herself in the bleachers while he worked. \u201cI was raised in a gym since I was a pumpkin seed,\u201d Sago said. \u201cMy dad wanted me to referee in college to get experience, but it was a lot with studies and everything. After college I got started.\u201d It took a couple of tries, first with sixth-grade girls, then with eighth-grade boys, before Sago felt comfortable. \u201cSomething just clicked, and I loved it,\u201d she said. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t get me out of the gym \u2014 I worked like six AAU games that day, just back-to-back-to-back.\u201d It didn\u2019t take long during her initial high school and college seasons before a referee scout recommended her to the NBA\u2019s \u201cgrass roots\u201d program. Sago got hired into the G League, then was invited to work in the WNBA. Said Michelle D. Johnson, the retired Air Force lieutenant general now serving as the NBA\u2019s Senior VP and Head of Referee Operations: \u201cFive years ago, the goal was to have a scouting program. Now we have that and we have people on the cusp of being hired. They looked at the grass roots events, pro-ams and tournaments. You look at about 3,000 candidates. Then you narrow it to 150. Then maybe we hired a dozen for the G League. You look for talent, and it keeps getting better and better.\u201d Salvatore said he was impressed with the air of authority a few female ref recruits were showing. He contrasted their confidence with the challenges Violet Palmer and Dee Kantner faced when breaking in as the NBA\u2019s first female referees in 1997-98. There was respect then from players and coaches, heeding the league\u2019s mandate, but the trust level now is higher and more natural. \u201cThe coaches and players, they\u2019re really encouraging,\u201d Sago said. \u201cThey say, \u2018We commend you, because you\u2019re stepping into a man\u2019s world.\u2019 We get a lot of respect from all the men in this environment. Our male counterparts, they love it. It makes us feel more a part of it. We all have great bonds and they\u2019re rooting for us too.\u201d Said Pat Delany, the Orlando assistant who had a few games in Vegas worked by new female refs: \u201cThey do the same job as everybody else out there and we\u2019re happy to have \u2018em. \u2026 Just as we as coaches are working on our craft, I know they\u2019re doing the same thing.\u201d McCutchen believes the NBA no longer needs to focus on the recruitment of women or other minority officiating candidates because the pipeline has been properly primed. \u201cWe have to be open to the idea that a good referee can come in many packages. You don\u2019t have to be 6-2, you can be 5-2,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s important that Michelle and I set up a culture where talent rises to the top, not packages. We\u2019re at a point now where we can hire the best officials, and I know for a fact that some of them are going to be women.\u201d Sago returned the compliment, crediting the training in programs such as the one held each morning through Summer League. \u201cThis is where all the learning happens,\u201d she said. \u201cWe could snapshot one play and talk about it for 30 minutes. There\u2019s so much learning about mechanics, discipline, primary versus secondary coverages.\u201d And, er, hip pats? Asked after that Minnesota-Detroit game if he would have reached out and given NBA refs Ed Malloy or Zach Zarba a friendly smack, Lucas was as precise with his words as he was with his hand. \u201cI hit her on the thigh,\u201d he said. \u201cI knew where my placement was.\u201d Said Sago, with a laugh: \u201cHe aimed low. He was really good about it.\u201d * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

Among that crew is San Antonio Spurs forward Kawhi Leonard, who reportedly demanded a trade from the team earlier this summer and remains in the thick of much of the offseason chatter. Spurs coach Gregg Popovich will head up the minicamp in Vegas and, per ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski and Ramona Shelburne, Leonard may show up there, too. However, as Wojnarowski reports, Leonard\u2019s decision to go to the minicamp may be more to show the status of his recovery from injury than anything to do with mending fences with the Spurs : Leonard\u2019s trade demands started with reports of him seeking a move to the Los Angeles Lakers. Other teams have been mentioned in the mix for Leonard \u2014 the Boston Celtics, Toronto Raptors, Philadelphia 76ers and others \u2014 and per Wojnarowski and Shelburne, the Spurs want a fairly large return for Leonard in trades. ESPN reports that the Spurs are seeking an All-Star-type player, young players with high potential and Draft assets in any trade for Leonard. Wojnarowski and Shelburne also report there has been \u201cless traction\u201d around a possible Spurs-Celtics or Spurs-Sixers deal for Leonard as those teams are well positioned for the future and aren\u2019t looking to take a risk trade-wise. As for the Lakers, writes Wojnarowski and Shelburne, they are playing the long game in trade talks and are confident that Leonard wants to play there and re-sign as a free agent come 2019 should they land him. As for the USA minicamp, ESPN reports Leonard holds enthusiasm to showcase his revitalized health at the event. However, ESPN reports that the question being debated is whether Leonard\u2019s participation in the Team USA camp will ignite trade talks anew or give the Spurs more reason to hold on to Leonard and perhaps push him to report to training camp in September. * Report: LeBron to miss Team USA minicamp Leonard has reportedly grown dissatisfied with how the organization handled his quad injury and feels the franchise turned on him once Leonard sought a second opinion . Additionally, per ESPN, the Spurs haven\u2019t allowed prospective trade partners to talk directly to Leonard or his representation. Leonard played in just nine games for San Antonio in the 2017-18 campaign due to a quad injury he initially suffered in Game 1 of the 2017 Western Conference finals . The two-time Kia Defensive Player of the Year\u2019s absence was especially notable late in the season, when he went to New York to continue rehab and chose not to be with the team during its playoff run. San Antonio was defeated 4-1 in the first round of the playoffs by eventual-champion Golden State Warriors. The tension surrounding the situation between Leonard and the Spurs intensified when, after opting to not be with the team for rehab reasons, Leonard was spotted three weeks later attending a Dodgers game in Los Angeles. San Antonio is hoping to regain the usual good footing it holds with its stars in order to keep the standard of excellence they have maintained since drafting Tim Duncan No. 1 overall in 1997. The Spurs had won at least 50 games in every season until 2017-18, when they went 47-35 and finished seventh in the Western Conference.

Ever since the Clippers moved north from San Diego to Los Angeles in 1984, the NBA has had two teams in each of its two biggest metro areas \u2014 the Knicks and Nets in greater New York; the Lakers and Clippers in L.A. (Yes, the Nets played in New Jersey from the time they entered the league after the 1976 merger until 2012, when they moved to Brooklyn . But the NFL\u2019s Giants and Jets are still considered by many to still be New York teams even though they\u2019ve played in Jersey since the late \u201870s \u2014 in the same complex in which the Nets played. So we consider the East Rutherford version of the Nets to have been a New York team, too.) Anyway, it\u2019s a moot point; the Nets are now in Brooklyn, and there are officially two teams apiece in New York and L.A., the nation\u2019s two largest cities by population . And, until now, the NBA\u2019s never had a situation like the one that is shaping up 12 months from today. A year from now, all four of those teams will be on the hunt, with significant salary cap space, to go after a group of free agents with as much star power as there has ever been in some time \u2014 at least since 2010, the first Summer of LeBron .  The third Summer of LeBron, of course, has resulted in LeBron James going to the Lakers , a shape-shifting event that will go a long way toward restoring one of the NBA\u2019s top two premier franchises as a prime free agent destination, after years of swings and misses. In basketball, as in most endeavors, if you\u2019re not going forward, you\u2019re falling behind. And it had been a decade since the Lakers last acquired a significant, difference-making player \u2014 Pau Gasol, from Memphis, in 2008 . But now, with James leaving the Cleveland Cavaliers for Tinseltown, the Lakers are back in business. Next year, the potential list of unrestricted free agents \u2014 which will depend on some players opting out of their existing contracts for the 2019-20 season \u2014 is staggering. Players with player options for 2019 include the Golden State Warriors\u2019 Kevin Durant, the Boston Celtics\u2019 Kyrie Irving and Al Horford, the San Antonio Spurs\u2019 (for now, anyway) Kawhi Leonard, the Cavs\u2019 Kevin Love, the Minnesota Timberwolves\u2019 Jimmy Butler and Jeff Teague, the Dallas Mavericks\u2019 Harrison Barnes, the Milwaukee Bucks\u2019 Khris Middleton, the Memphis Grizzlies\u2019 Marc Gasol, the New Orleans Pelicans\u2019 Julius Randle, the Toronto Raptors\u2019 Jonas Valanciunas and C.J. Miles and the Miami Heat\u2019s Goran Dragic and Hassan Whiteside. They won\u2019t all opt out. And, it\u2019s especially difficult to see Valanciunas, Whiteside or Gasol doing so \u2014 and, no, it\u2019s not a coincidence that they\u2019re all centers, an increasingly fungible position in the small ball, positionless era. But many will.  Players scheduled to become free agents outright include the Warriors\u2019 Klay Thompson and DeMarcus Cousins, the Charlotte Hornets\u2019 Kemba Walker, the Mavs\u2019 DeAndre Jordan, the Oklahoma City Thunder\u2019s (for now, anyway) Carmelo Anthony, the LA Clippers\u2019 Tobias Harris, the Bucks\u2019 Eric Bledsoe, the Pelicans\u2019 Nikola Mirotic, the Utah Jazz\u2019s Ricky Rubio, the Knicks\u2019 Mario Hezonja and Enes Kanter, the Celtics\u2019 Marcus Morris and his twin brother, Washington Wizards\u2019 big man Markieff Morris, the Indiana Pacers\u2019 Thaddeus Young, Tyreke Evans, Darren Collison and Bojan Bogdanovic, the Lakers\u2019 Rajon Rondo and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, the Philadelphia 76ers\u2019 J.J. Redick and the Portland Trail Blazers\u2019 Al-Faroqu Aminu. In addition, players from the 2015 Draft class are eligible for extensions this fall. If they don\u2019t get them, they would become restricted free agents next summer. Among that group is the Wolves\u2019 Karl-Anthony Towns, the Knicks\u2019 Kristaps Porzingis, the Celtics\u2019 Terry Rozier, the Pacers\u2019 Myles Turner, the Bulls\u2019 Bobby Portis, the Wizards\u2019 Kelly Oubre, Jr. and the Raptors\u2019 Delon Wright. Bucks guard Malcolm Brogdon, a second-round pick in 2017 and the 2017 Kia Rookie of the Year, will also be a restricted free agent next summer. Whew. And Gotham and the City of Angels will be at the front of the line. They won\u2019t be operating in a vacuum, of course. More than a third of the league projects to have significant cap room next summer, or can create it with a simple roster move or two. Rebuilding teams like Dallas and Atlanta will have it, contending teams like Philly will have it and up and coming teams like Indiana could have it. (The Pacers will have a half-dozen free agents to re-sign, but if they renounced their rights to most or all of them, they would open up enough room to sign a max player to go with Victor Oladipo, Domantas Sabonis and Myles Turner.) Only two previous free agent classes had this kind of star power: 1996 and 2010. The 1996 free agent class was unprecedented to that point in league history. Oscar Robertson\u2019s lawsuit against the NBA, which paved the way for true free agency for NBA players, wasn\u2019t settled until 1976. The league and players union had agreed to a salary cap in 1983. While individual players in given years were fought over (the New York tried unsuccessfully in 1983 to peel Kevin McHale , then a restricted free agent, away from Boston), there had never been such a significant collection of impact players who all reached unrestricted free agency in the same year. After a very brief, hours-long lockout involving the division of profit from the existing television contracts , teams were off and running to go after a cross-section of elite NBA (and some future Hall of Fame) talent including: Michael Jordan, Shaquille O\u2019Neal, Hakeem Olajuwon, Alonzo Mourning, Gary Payton, Reggie Miller, Dikembe Mutombo, Juwan Howard, Kenny Anderson, Allan Houston, Steve Smith and P.J. Brown, among others. That year, the Knicks remade their team in one fell swoop , signing Houston for seven years and $56 million, point guard Chris Childs for six years and $24 million and trading for Hornets power forward, Larry Johnson (who had nine years and $70 million left on his deal). And they almost landed the biggest fish of all \u2014 Jordan \u2014 who had a real flirtation with the Knicks . New York got approval from the league for an offer to Jordan that would have included his becoming a paid spokesman for businesses owned by the Knicks\u2019 parent company at the time, ITT. In the end, though, Jordan returned to Chicago on a one-year, $30 million deal .  But the Lakers struck Forum Blue and Gold, too. Shaq, famously, wound up leaving Orlando and signing with the Lakers on a seven-year, $120 million deal. Los Angeles had cleared the decks for the big man with a flurry of deals before the start of free agency that cleared cap space \u2014 including one that sent incumbent center Vlade Divac to the Hornets for the Draft rights to, as was described by The New York Times then, \u201cthe high school star Kobe Bryant.\u201d By 2010, after leading the Lakers to a threepeat, Shaq was long gone from Los Angeles, but Bryant was still there and the Lakers were still winning championships. Bryant won his fifth as a Laker that year , as L.A. survived a seven-game Finals with its biggest rival, the Celtics. So the Lakers had no need of getting better via free agency. That summer was the last great seismic shift of multiple talents around the league, with James and Chris Bosh joining Dwyane Wade in Miami to form the Super Friends. The Knicks had spent two years clearing room to make a run at James, as had the Heat. But New York didn\u2019t close the deal with James, and had to turn instead to Amar\u2019e Stoudemire , giving the former Suns forward a five-year, $100 million deal. Chicago, left at the altar when Second City native Wade turned them down at the 11th hour, wound up giving Carlos Boozer nearly $80 million to leave Utah . But most of the other top free agents that summer stayed where they were, including Joe Johnson ($124 million from the Hawks ), Yao Ming ( $18 million from the Rockets ), Dirk Nowitzki ( $80 million from the Mavericks ) and Paul Pierce ( $61 million from the Celtics ). Now, James is in Los Angeles. And that resets the board in a dramatic way. There\u2019s no guarantee the Lakers or any of the other three teams will be successful in their pursuit come 2019. Haven\u2019t we all learned the lessons by now that you can\u2019t assume anything? Or have you forgotten what mortal locks so many said it was that Russell Westbrook and Paul George would each wind up in L.A.? But the Lakers will be back in the game. And, like the Clippers, Knicks and Nets, they have unique assets that will be central to their pitch. * * * PRIMARY 2019 ASSETS: \u2022 Cap space (one max contract) \u2022 James (signed through 2022; player option 2021-22) \u2022 Enormous franchise resources (including the team\u2019s $3 billion local television rights package with Time Warner Cable) \u2022 Emerging young talent  The Lakers couldn\u2019t get out of their own way in recent years. But owner Jeanie Buss went all in last year, firing former GM Mitch Kupchak and her own brother, Jim , the former executive vice president of the team, to remake the front office, hiring Magic Johnson to take her brother\u2019s position and prominent player agent Rob Pelinka to become general manager . The Lakers signed Caldwell-Pope last summer for one year and $18 million \u2014 but, more importantly (and, legally), it allowed the team to begin a dialogue and foster a relationship with Caldwell-Pope\u2019s agent, Rich Paul \u2014 who is James\u2019 agent as well. (If you don\u2019t think other high-powered agents like Scott Boras don\u2019t do the exact same thing with his high-impact clientele in Major League Baseball, or Tom Condon in the NFL, you need to get out more.) The Lakers signed players who\u2019ll help James this season \u2014 Rajon Rondo and Lance Stephenson and JaVale McGee \u2014 to go with their remaining group of young players: Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball, Kyle Kuzma, Josh Hart and their first-round pick this year, Mo Wagner. But the second shoe has yet to drop. That will come a year from now. \u201cI think that he had analyzed our roster,\u201d Johnson said of James in a conference call with reporters last week. \u201cHe had analyzed the situation, and so he was willing to say, \u2018hey, I\u2019m going to make a long-term commitment to the Laker organization.\u2019 And so that\u2019s what we needed as an organization. And then also, other players around the league can see that, and they\u2019ll be willing to play with him, and come to the Lakers, because they know he\u2019s going to be here. It also helps our players too, their own mindset that he\u2019s going to be here as well.\u201d The Lakers \u2014 and, by extension now, James, with his L.A.-based SpringHill Entertainment company and the relationships he and partner Maverick Carter have built over the years both in the entertainment and business worlds \u2014 can offer players a platform that few other franchises in any sport can. For all their struggles on the floor in recent years, the Lakers\u2019 brand is still iconic. The franchise\u2019s history, now embodied in its front office by Johnson, is still powerful. And, now, they have the best player on earth, even at 33, taking his place alongside the pantheon: Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Shaq. Elgin Baylor, Kobe and Jerry West. As well as all the others who went West in search of stardom and rings. Again, they can dream of rings. * * * PRIMARY 2019 ASSETS: \u2022 Cap space (two max contracts) \u2022 Wealth\/passion of owner Steve Ballmer \u2022 Championship winning personnel (Jerry West, Doc Rivers, Sam Cassell) \u2022 Future arena  There is a saying in the Clippers\u2019 building about the \u201cLob City\u201d era : we won, but we were never the winner. The franchise had the third-most regular season victories in the NBA during that stretch, which ran from 2011-17, when Chris Paul was in town. But it ran its course, and with James on the Lakers, the Clippers have again fallen behind their celebrated rivals with whom they share Staples Center for attention and glitz. But the feeling within the Clippers\u2019 organization is that a potential battle with the Lakers next summer for elite free agents should go much differently than skirmishes in the past. They weren\u2019t in on James, having decided after trading Blake Griffin to Detroit in February that they were all-in for 2019 (when they\u2019ll have room for two max free agents). So there was no taking on contracts with years, and no dealing of either of their first-round picks (the second coming from the Pistons). In 2019\u2019s free agency, the Clippers will be led by Ballmer, the NBA\u2019s richest owner, with an estimated wealth of $40 billion. He led the presentation to Griffin last summer that convinced Griffin to not take any free-agent visits and sign a max deal . Sure, the $171 million helped Griffin make his mind up quick, but there was a well-articulated vision for the short and long term laid out as well. As most everyone should know by now, Ballmer loves to compete. The Clippers will be aggressive next summer, working hard and smart for free agents. The pressure of working for a multi-billionaire in the ultimate alpha male endeavor is staggering. But it\u2019s less staggering than working for an owner that isn\u2019t willing to go into the luxury tax. Ballmer oversaw the team\u2019s front office restructuring last year, where Rivers was stripped of his president of basketball operations authority but kept aboard as coach, with Lawrence Frank, the team\u2019s EVP of Basketball Operations , leading the revamped front office, which now includes GM Michael Winger and assistant GMs Trent Redden and Mark Hughes. The restructuring mirrored new investments in the team\u2019s infrastructure across the board that the team believes leaves it well-positioned to match the Lakers and anyone else bell for bell, whistle for whistle. A 2019 pitch will also include Ballmer\u2019s updated plans for a new Clippers-only arena, currently slated for Inglewood , where the Lakers used to play, and which would house a new practice facility. On the floor, the Clippers will point to a team strafed by injuries last season and the mid-season trade of Griffin that nonetheless battled to the end of the regular season before falling short of the playoffs. Now they\u2019ll add their two first-rounders this year, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (whose Draft rights came via trade with Charlotte) and Jerome Robinson , to Tobias Harris and some of the grinders unearthed by all the injuries last season, including C.J. Williams and Jawun Evans. But someone who comes to the Clippers will have an opportunity to make his own history, different from \u201cLob City.\u201d That was an era of wins, but never being the winner. There aren\u2019t any championship banners in Staples with the Clippers\u2019 names on them, and no statues outside of Staples featuring Clippers\u2019 legends. The guys who want to be pioneers will get a chance to do it there, in a big city, and for a franchise that will be ready to think big again. * * * PRIMARY 2019 ASSETS: \u2022 Cap space (one max contract) \u2022 Kristaps Porzingis \u2022 Young players (Kevin Knox, Frank Ntilikina) \u2022 New Coach David Fizdale  The Knicks have been an afterthought for just about every major free agent for the last decade. They couldn\u2019t get a meeting with Durant in 2016 even though he was holding his free-agent visits at a house in the Hamptons, less than two hours\u2019 drive from Madison Square Garden \u2014 and despite the entreaties of his friend Carmelo Anthony, then the team\u2019s franchise player. They expect that to change next summer, when New York has designs on adding a superstar with their own budding star, Porzingis. He should be fully recovered by then from the torn ACL he suffered just before the All-Star break in February. The hope is that the disappearance of the toxicity and dysfunction that surrounded the franchise at the end of Phil Jackson\u2019s reign will let prospective free agents give New York a real look next summer. Currently, the Knicks can realistically add just one max free agent. It is possible, though, they could get close to a second if they were to move Tim Hardaway, Jr.\u2019s contract by next year. The team\u2019s new braintrust \u2014 team president Steve Mills, General Manager Scott Perry and Fizdale \u2014 have gone to significant lengths to display a unified front, one that the team believes will be able to close deals next summer. Even though Fizdale didn\u2019t last two seasons in his first coaching job in Memphis, the Knicks think his more successful days as the top assistant to Erik Spoelstra in Miami \u2014 when James and the Heat won two titles and made two other Finals \u2014 will be persuasive for free agents. Perry, in a short stint as the GM in Sacramento before taking the Knicks\u2019 job, was able to get Zach Randolph and Vince Carter to sign as free agents. And while so many players are living in Los Angeles in the offseason these days, there is still cache and opportunity in the biggest market in the States that isn\u2019t around anywhere else. Anthony helped make New York\u2019s Fashion Week a big deal for NBA players to attend. Shoe companies and record labels similarly can provide enhanced opportunities. But the Knicks do have to start showing some real improvement on the court, having again stumbled and bumbled (thanks, Clyde!) to a 29-53 record last season while missing the playoffs for a fifth straight season. There should be no illusions of a dramatic turnaround, especially with Porzingis not likely to be ready at the start of the season. The goal this year is just to get Porzingis back on the floor healthy by the end of the year. There\u2019s hope for Knox to flash, and for either Ntilikina or Emmanuel Mudiay to solidify the team at the point. That would allow the Knicks to tell a story of improvement and foundation a year from now. Now: just because someone\u2019s a good player doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ll be so in New York; just ask Ed Whitson . Gotham isn\u2019t for everybody. But the Knicks need it to resonate with somebody. * * * PRIMARY 2019 ASSETS: \u2022 Cap space (two max contracts) \u2022 Coach Ken Atkinson\/player development \u2022 Homegrown success stories \u2022 Future picks (2019 first from Denver, protected 1-12 through 2024; 2019 second-round picks from New York, Indiana; 2020 second-round picks from Denver, Portland)  After years in the wilderness, there\u2019s a clearing hard by Barclays Center. Unable to get restricted free agents like Otto Porter Jr. or Tyler Johnson via offer sheets, the Nets have used their cap room over the last couple of years under GM Sean Marks to get assets \u2014 Draft picks from teams that wanted to dump bad contracts, or young prospects if picks weren\u2019t available. Brooklyn got a 2017 first-round pick from Washington to take Andrew Nicholson\u2019s deal off of the Wizards\u2019 cap; that pick became center Jarrett Allen, and Brooklyn flipped Nicholson to Portland last summer for Allen Crabbe ( whom Brooklyn also had signed to an offer sheet ). The Nets got D\u2019Angelo Russell from the Lakers in 2017 in exchange for Brook Lopez and a 2017 first-round pick, which became Kyle Kuzma. Then they took DeMarre Carroll\u2019s salary off Toronto\u2019s hands for a 2018 first-round pick (Dzanan Musa) and a second-rounder (Rodions Kurucs). And after trading Mozgov and his remaining $32 million to Charlotte for the since-waived Dwight Howard \u2014 and paying Howard about $13 million of the $18 million he was owed for next season in a buyout agreement \u2014 Brooklyn will now have room for two max salaries next season. The Nets crave flexibility above everything else. They know that even though they\u2019re finally out from the disastrous 2013 Kevin Garnett\/Paul Pierce trade with Boston that cost them three first-round picks, and will finally have their own first-rounder next year for the first time since 2015, that it may prove difficult to get two blue-chip players via free agency. But that doesn\u2019t mean they couldn\u2019t trade for a big name. It doesn\u2019t matter how the talent get there, as long as it gets there. The Nets didn\u2019t throw another $100 million at someone else after the Wizards matched their $100 million offer sheet to Porter Jr. last year. Instead, they bided their time.  Atkinson has been as advertised since coming from Atlanta\u2019s bench two years ago. The Nets point to players like Spencer Dinwiddie and Joe Harris that have become contributors under Atkinson and the Nets\u2019 coaching and player-development staffs \u2014 and who have sung the team\u2019s praises better than the team ever could. The Nets are aware that the Knicks are the big name in town. They know the Knicks have at least some positive history to trade on with prospective free agents. But they can\u2019t be intimidated by that. Their practice facility in Sunset Park is as dynamic as anyone\u2019s in the league. They think they can get free agents who want to play the way Atkinson teaches \u2014 ball movement and body movement and tons of 3-pointers (Brooklyn\u2019s 35.7 3-pointers per game was second only to Houston\u2019s 42.3 in 2017-18 ). And whether you\u2019re 22 or 28, the Nets pitch goes, you\u2019ll get better. As with the Knicks, Brooklyn isn\u2019t for everybody. But neither of the Nets\u2019 principal owners, Mikhail Prokhorov or Joe Tsai, grew up anywhere near Atlantic Avenue. Marks is from New Zealand. (Atkinson grew up on Long Island \u2014 which both Islanders and Gothamites go to great pains to say isn\u2019t New York City.) But Marks is steeped in the Spurs way , having both played for them and then worked in their front office before being hired by the Nets. Marks has put a first-rate staff together, from assistant GM Trajan Langdon to Andrew Baker, the team\u2019s head of strategic planning. They have been methodically planning for the day they can finally get out from under the KG\/Pierce deal and start writing a new chapter in franchise history. It\u2019s 12 months away. * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

From Nate Klaiber: Well, Games 6 and 7 of the Western Conference finals weren\u2019t boring, Nate. If Chris Paul doesn\u2019t pull his hamstring in the last minute of Game 5 , and the Houston Rockets don\u2019t have an historically bad night shooting the ball in Game 7, I\u2019m pretty sure we would have been in Houston for Game 1 of The Finals. Even without Paul, it took an historically bad shooting night by the Rockets on their home floor for the Golden State Warriors to come back from 17 down in the first quarter (I can tell you firsthand Steve Kerr did not share your view of Golden State hegemony after 12 minutes.) And we will just have to disagree on your distinction of \u201cbuying\u201d instead of \u201cearning.\u201d The Warriors earned their second and third titles during this run with Durant just as they did the first one without him. En Garde. From Jose Pereira:  I thought Thomas would ultimately wind up there, Jose. Now that he\u2019s in Denver, the Magic does need a long-term solution at the point. You\u2019d have to think Orlando will look at Dennis Schroeder. The Atlanta Hawks\u2019 incumbent point guard has been on the block for a while, and the Hawks added Jeremy Lin to Trae Young at the point last week. But Schroeder\u2019s legal situation in Atlanta likely makes him radioactive around the league until it\u2019s adjudicated for good. He is not \u2018Melo about Anthony\u2019s D. From Jerry White: Well, Carmelo is no defensive whiz, to be sure. Losing Ariza and Mbah a Moute is a definite downgrade to Houston\u2019s perimeter defensive abilities \u2014 though the Rockets did get a sneaky good pickup along those lines by signing James Ennis from Detroit last week. He\u2019ll help some. But if Anthony insists on being a starter in Houston, the Rockets will have to help him defensively (I am assuming Clint Capela ultimately comes to terms with the Rockets and signs for next season). Coach Mike D\u2019Antoni could move P.J. Tucker into the starting lineup permanently at small forward, for example, to guard the opposition\u2019s bigger offensive threat at the three or four. But \u2018Melo can still put the ball in the basket, and as we all saw in Game 7 of the Western finals, even the Rockets can go through an extended and calamitous scoring drought at the worst possible time.

If your e-mail is funny, thought-provoking or snarky, we just might publish it! $110,000,000 \u2014 Reported max extension offer turned down by the Timberwolves\u2019 Jimmy Butler , according to the team\u2019s owner, Glen Taylor. While the talks were amicable, Butler had been hoping Minnesota would clear more cap room this summer to be able to offer him an even bigger max extension. He can opt out of his deal next summer and become an unrestricted free agent. 19 \u2014 Female referees that were at the NBA Summer League in Las Vegas, according to the NBA. After having two female refs among its regular-season staff for several years, the league only has one woman referee on its staff \u2014 Lauren Holtkamp, a fact that NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said during his press conference last week was \u201ca bit embarrassing.\u201d 72 \u2014 Teams in this year\u2019s field for The Basketball Tournament , now in its fifth year, with a $2 million, winner take all prize for the team that wins it all. Among the many former NBA players listed as playing this year in TBT are Jimmer Fredette, the former Kings\u2019 Lottery pick, who\u2019s on Team Fredette; Matt Barnes (Sons of Westwood), former Sonics Lottery pick Robert Swift (West Coast Ronin), former Bulls Lottery pick Eddy Curry (Charlotte Chess Center), Lou Amundson (Eberlein Drive), Jared Sullinger (Scarlet & Gray), Ronnie Brewer (Team Arkansas), Hakim Warrick (Boeheim\u2019s Army), Patrick O\u2019Bryant (Always A Brave), Eric Maynor (Ram Nation), Jamario Moon (Atlanta Dirty South), Jeremy Pargo (Overseas Elite) and Jeff Ayers (Team Challenge ALS). Pacers guard Darren Collison is listed as the head coach of Team Challenge ALS and Portland\u2019s Evan Turner is the head coach of Scarlet & Gray. Newly signed Laker Rajon Rondo is listed as coach of Team Rondo. Longtime NBA assistant Jim Cleamons is the coach of Team Detroit, former Bulls lottery pick Marcus Fizer is coaching the Hilton Magic Legends, and longtime NBA vet Jeff McInnis is an assistant coach for Primetime Players. 1) For all those who continue whining about the Warriors and how competitive balance is impossible in today\u2019s NBA, I give you: Denver. The Nuggets have, quietly, done the work of rebuilding a franchise that bottomed out three years ago at 30-52 with the tried and true quad of good management: hiring the right coach and staff, led by Michael Malone; drafting the right people, adding the right people through trades and free agency and then paying the right people the most money. Nikola Jokic, Jamal Murray and Gary Harris came through the Draft (Harris having technically come via Draft night trade from Chicago). Will Barton and Mason Plumlee came via trade. Paul Millsap came in free agency. They also reportedly took a flier on Isaiah Thomas last week. And the Nuggets shifted payroll that was slotted to the likes of Wilson Chandler, Kenneth Faried and others next season to Jokic and Barton by trading Chandler , Faried and Darrell Arthur in the last two weeks in order to give Jokic a max deal and re-sign Barton for four years and $54 million without going into luxury tax hell. The Nuggets haven\u2019t been perfect in their endeavors; no one is. But they\u2019ve fixed those mistakes quickly, and now have a young and deep team ready to make a run in the West. Kudos to President of Basketball Operations Tim Connelly, General Manager Arturas Karnisovas and president Josh Kroenke for showing it can be done. 2) No problem with Chicago putting money that would otherwise burn a hole in its pocket into looking at Jabari Parker for a year. I\u2019m not sure Parker can play the three, but let\u2019s be honest: the Bulls aren\u2019t interested in stopping anyone next year \u2014 they\u2019re invested in putting up more points. That could be a win-win for Parker, too. Guys who can put the ball in the basket tend to have more suitors, so he could be primed for a bigger payday down the road. At the least, a productive season by Parker could make him a trade asset for the Bulls next summer (just as Nikola Mirotic became) at the least. Chicago\u2019s future is in Lauri Markkanen and Wendell Carter Jr. and Kris Dunn. If Parker or Zach LaVine fire and become a vital part of the rotation \u2026 well, it will be a good problem for the Bulls to have. 3) The career track so far for Jahlil Okafor, the third pick in the Draft overall just three flipping years ago, continues to astound. He is an unrestricted free agent after having been an afterthought in Brooklyn, which won exactly 28 games last season. Okafor is working this summer with player development yoda Idan Ravin, trying to show prospective teams he\u2019s aware he must show improvement on the perimeter. Ravin has been reconstructing Okafor\u2019s jump shot and improving his ability to score on face-ups and off the dribble. No one\u2019s saying Okafor hasn\u2019t been a disappointment so far as a pro. But in a league where there are so many bad teams, it\u2019s astonishing no one has yet to give the still just 22-year-old Okafor a real look. 4) Notwithstanding my issues with tennis below, two things. One, props to Angelique Kerber for her first Wimbledon title Saturday, convincingly beating Serena Williams in the final, and for being incredibly gracious and warm afterward. Two, I do love how tennis has seamlessly incorporated the best instant replay system in sports, the Hawk-Eye system, into its game over the last decade-plus. It takes seconds, from a player\u2019s challenge to seeing whether a ball is in or out, with the Hawk-Eye. There\u2019s no ambiguity, no whining about missed calls. And because of, matches keep flowing, their rhythms undisrupted. To be fair: there is no way of knowing exactly how many calls Hawk-Eye may actually get wrong \u2014 it is a machine, but that doesn\u2019t make it infallible . But it\u2019s the best replay system by far that I\u2019ve seen. 1) Condolences to the family of Mavericks owner Mark Cuban on the loss of Norton Cuban, father to Mark, Brian and Jeff. 2) Tennis majors need to stop with this \u201cfifth set until someone wins\u201d format. As compelling as Kevin Anderson\u2019s semifinal win over John Isner at Wimbledon was on Friday, it\u2019s insane that it took six hours and 36 minutes to complete because there was no fifth-set tiebreaker. Which meant Anderson and Isner went on \u2026 and on \u2026 and on \u2026 taking more than two hours just to finish the final set. The powers that be in tennis have to institute some kind of tiebreaker in a fifth set for majors. It doesn\u2019t have to be at 6-all; it can be at 10-all or 12-all if they want. But at some point you have to finish the damn match. 3) Farewell, 5,000 or so bots who were purged from my Twitter account last week, leaving me with a healthy 670K of actual human type followers. And I thank all of you for sticking with me over the years as I chronicle NBA moves, D.C. sports teams and the occasional political discussion. I do not want, nor expect, everyone to agree with me about everything (and wouldn\u2019t that be a boring place to be?). But 99 percent of you who do disagree on occasion do it civilly and with respect. Which is the only way we\u2019re going to get through these days together. \u2014 Jazz guard and former Louisville star Donovan Mitchell ( @spidadmitchell ), Friday, 11:22 a.m., after his school announced it was removing the former sponsor Papa John\u2019s from the name of its football stadium. The school also dismissed former Papa John\u2019s chair John Schnatter from its Board of Trustees and took his name off the Center for Free Enterprise at the school\u2019s College of Business . This all happened after Schnatter was disclosed to have used the N-word while in discussion on a conference call on how to deal with racial issues . Schantter resigned as Papa John\u2019s chair last Wednesday.

(Just by way of comparison: this year\u2019s league MVP James Harden made 265 3-pointers this past season alone .) \u201cI just felt like at this point, I owed it to myself to be a part of something bigger than next year\u2019s draft.\u201d \u2014 Kyle O\u2019Quinn , the newly signed Pacers\u2019 big man, on why he chose to go to Indiana rather than stay with the New York Knicks, where he\u2019d played the previous three seasons. That was harsh. \u201cI feel just so excited to see him play NBA basketball and show why he was the first player chosen in the NBA draft. And I have tremendous optimism and confidence that he\u2019s going to have a hell of a year next year.\u201d \u2014 76ers Coach Brett Brown , to local reporters , updating on the improvements made by Markelle Fultz after spending the last several weeks working with skills development trainer Drew Hanlen in Los Angeles. * * * Longtime NBA reporter, columnist and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer David Aldridge is an analyst for TNT.

His maturity and measured approach in his first blush against fellow pros has been a bit of a revelation to those who didn\u2019t watch him in his lone season at Alabama. But if you listened to Alabama coach Avery Johnson \u2014 an NBA veteran who knows a little something about playing guard at this level \u2014 none of what Sexton is doing this summer should come as much of a surprise. Jaren Jackson Jr., Memphis Grizzlies Kobi Simmons has been solid all summer for the Memphis Grizzlies. And Brandon Goodwin led the way with 21 points in an 82-73 win over the Philadelphia 76ers that pushed the Grizzlies into Monday\u2019s semifinal showdown against the Portland Trail Blazers. But it\u2019s hard for anyone to outshine rookie and No. 4 overall pick Jackson Jr., whose ability to shoot from distance and still dominate around the rim has given us all a glimpse of the immense potential the Grizzlies (and plenty of other teams) saw in him during and after his freshman season at Michigan State. His 14 points, eight rebounds and four blocks against the Sixers came a night after he flirted with a triple-double (nine points, nine rebounds and seven blocks) in a 92-86 Saturday win against the Utah Jazz. He\u2019s given the Grizzlies a little bit of everything they could have hoped so, so far, from the youngest player selected in last month\u2019s draft. Josh Hart, Los Angeles Lakers The somewhat surprise visit from his new teammate, LeBron James, wasn\u2019t necessary for Hart to continue his impressive showing this summer. It certainly didn\u2019t hurt that the new King of Los Angeles made the trip over to see the Lakers\u2019 Summer League squad continue it s rampage over the competition. Hart has led the undefeated Lakers into Monday\u2019s semifinal against none other than LeBron\u2019s former team, the Cleveland Cavaliers, after notching 18 points, four assists, two rebounds and two steals in a 101-78 blowout of the Detroit Pistons . Hart has clearly taken his game to another level after an impressive rookie season. It\u2019ll be interesting to see where he fits into the mix with LeBron and the other new Lakers come the 2018-19 season. John Jenkins, Portland Trail Blazers Jenkins led a balanced scoring attack for the 5-0 Trail Blazers in their 95-80 triumph over the Boston Celtics , scoring 25 points in another statement performance for the one-time first round pick of the Atlanta Hawks. Jenkins is making a strong impression in his comeback bid, showing off the shooting touch and scoring ability that made him a hot commodity after he starred at Vanderbilt. He\u2019ll need to keep the momentum going for Monday\u2019s semifinal tilt with the Memphis Grizzlies. But that shouldn\u2019t be an issue with Wade Baldwin IV (14 points, 10 assists) getting a crack at his former team, Archie Goodwin chipping in and big men Zach Collins and Caleb Swanigan playing strong around the rim."},{"id":39311,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/76ers-grizzlies-vegas-summer-league-recap","date":"2018-07-16","title":"Game Recap: Grizzlies 82, 76ers 73","content":"Joel Bartilotta, Rotoworld LAS VEGAS \u2014 The Memphis Grizzlies defeated the Philadelphia 76ers 82-73 in the Summer League quarterfinals at Thomas and Mack Center on Sunday.

Ellenson showed off his improved ball-handling skills and outside stroke, finishing with 21 points and five rebounds, leading the Pistons in scoring. At 6-11 and 245 pounds, he\u2019ll give new Pistons coach Dwane Casey a floor-stretching option this season that the Pistons lacked in Stan Van Gundy\u2019s final season at the helm. Ellenson played in 38 regular season games, averaging 8.7 minutes, 4.0 points and 2.1 rebounds. But he finished the regular season with four straight double-digit scoring games, including a double-double (14 points, 12 rebounds) in the Pistons\u2019 April 11 win over the Bulls in the season finale. Collin Sexton, Cleveland Cavaliers Sexton continues to live up to his \u201cYoung Bull\u201d nickname during Summer League. He\u2019s shown no signs of apprehension on the floor and has had no problem getting shots up with that being his glaring deficiency at this extremely early stage of his career. He shot just 5-for-17 from the floor but still managed to pace the Cavaliers in scoring (tying for team-high honors with Scoochie Smith) with 17 in their 92-87 defeat of the Houston Rockets . Sexton added six rebounds, three assists and two steals while showing off the sort of command of the floor that the Cavaliers will need from him when he hits training camp in a few months. It remains unclear what role Sexton will play with the veterans in the mix, but it\u2019ll be significant. Rawle Alkins, Toronto Raptors The rookie guard from Arizona outperformed fellow Hornets rookie Miles Bridges (highlights galore among his 18 points and 11 rebounds) and second-year forward Dwyane Bacon (game-high 28 points), knocking down a huge 3-pointer in overtime to give the Toronto Raptors an 87-84 overtime win that puts the Raptors into a quarterfinal matchup against Cleveland. https:\/\/twitter.com\/NBATV\/status\/1018285373263212544%20 Alkins did his damage inside and out, finishing with 25 points and 11 rebounds while showing off an ability to play on and off the ball, something that wasn\u2019t evident from his time in college at Arizona. Atkins went undrafted last month but you wouldn\u2019t know it based on the way he\u2019s played during Summer League. The Raptors have a roster loaded with young talent but Alkins has certainly given them a reason to make sure he has spot on their training camp roster. Pierra Henry, Boston Celtics Second-year forward Geurschon Yabusele turned in a 12-point, 10-rebound double-double to help power the Celtics past the Miami Heat 74-72 and into the quarterfinals, but it was rookie shooting guard Pierra Henry who led a deep Celtics team with 15 points, five rebounds, five assists and two steals, showing off his length and athleticism at just the right time. The Celtics already have a deep and talented veteran roster, so someone not already under contract making noise on the Summer League roster might not seem as significant for them as it would elsewhere. But as every player in Henry\u2019s predicament knows, you\u2019re playing for more than just the team name splashed across your chest during Summer League. You\u2019re auditioning for basketball\u2019s global community with every minute played. Christian Wood, Milwaukee Bucks Wood\u2019s love for the rims at the Thomas & Mack Center and Cox Pavilion remain from his college days playing for the UNLV Running Rebels. Well, that\u2019s one way of explaining his dominance, even in defeat ( 91-89 to the Philadelphia 76ers ), during Summer League action. Wood worked the Sixers for 27 points (on 10-for-15 shooting), 12 rebounds and five blocks. Wood made just one of his three attempts from beyond the 3-point line and made six of his nine shots from the free throw line in an otherwise dominant performance. Wood averaged 23.3 points and 10.4 rebounds for Delaware last season in the G-League. His performance this summer suggests he\u2019s headed for that and perhaps more during the 2018-19 season."},{"id":39357,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/sixers-bucks-summer-league-recap","date":"2018-07-15","title":"Game Recap: Sixers 91, Bucks 89","content":"By Juan Carlos Blanco, RotoWire Furkan Korkmaz scored 19 points to help the Philadelphia 76ers overcome a late rally by the Milwaukee Bucks for a 91-89 victory in a Las Vegas Summer League second-round playoff game at Thomas and Mack Center on Saturday.

But for all the challenges and stereotypes associated with both groups of NBA rookies, the Bulls are pleased with the players they chose at No. 7 and No. 22 in last month\u2019s Draft . Carter, certainly, won\u2019t need a second chance to make a first impression. The 6-foot-10, 259 big from Duke was an instant Summer League sensation, demonstrating skills, effort and acumen at both ends of the court. Defensively, whether protecting the rim or switching out top in pick-and-roll situations, Carter\u2019s mobility and bounce speak to his age. Offensively, he\u2019s stretching his shooting range to suit the prevailing definition of \u201cmodern\u201d NBA bags. But Carter is savvy and serious beyond his years, already generating comparisons to a heady NBA veteran such as Boston\u2019s Al Horford while just three months removed from his 19th birthday.  \u201cI\u2019ve heard all good names,\u201d Carter said of the \u201ccomps\u201d used to project the type of player he can become. The son of Wendell Sr. and Kylie had just scored 19 points on 9-of-11 shooting with nine rebounds against Dallas\u2019 summer entry. \u201cIt\u2019s just something to motivate you. They compare me to multi-time All-Stars, and just to be in those sentences motivates me, because I know I need to get there.\u201d Chicago\u2019s maneuver Saturday to sign free-agent forward Jabari Parker away from the Milwaukee Bucks might have grabbed the headlines for a day or two. But Carter\u2019s play through the first eight days in Las Vegas was the bigger news, calming worries for those who felt the Bulls had blown their 2017-18 tank-athon. Falling to No. 7 in the lottery looked like bad karma after the priority Chicago put on, er, not winning last season. The Bulls went 27-55, their worst showing in 14 years. But the early reviews on Carter \u2013 admittedly, against a July backdrop of lesser competition \u2013 suggest they did as well as if they\u2019d dropped another half dozen games last season. \u201cWith Wendell, we feel he\u2019s very mature for a 19-year-old kid,\u201d coach Fred Hoiberg said. \u201cHe\u2019s got a lot of interests away from basketball. He was a great student. And he\u2019s got great tools to work with. \u201cSeven-foot-four wingspan. He\u2019s played on the perimeter, he\u2019s played on the block. He\u2019s an excellent rebounder, and he does a nice job protecting the rim. He does things that older players do, with verticality, with keeping the ball in play when he gets a deflection.\u201d Carter blocked 11 shots in his first three games, including a two-handed snatch from Cleveland\u2019s Ante Zizic in the Bulls\u2019 opener that still ranks as the defensive play of this event. In the Bulls\u2019 Vegas finale against Detroit Saturday, he shot 1-of-8 for just six points but added 16 rebounds and two blocks. Asked about his NBA readiness, Carter thought for a moment, then said: \u201cGenes worked in my favor [his father played pro overseas, his mother in college]. And hard work. I\u2019m constantly getting stronger. Faster. And the mental game is really key. You can be physically stronger but I think about 80, 90 percent of that is all mental. Knowing where to set screens, knowing when to take shots, simple things like that really make you great in this league.\u201d Hutchison, by contrast, is at the other end of the timeline, a player for whom the calendar is both a curse and a blessing. They supposedly are more developed in their games and yet, on the flip side, closer to having maxed out in how much they actually will improve. Of the past 21 winners of the NBA\u2019s Rookie of the Year award, only three \u2013 Malcolm Brogdon (2017), Damian Lillard (2013) and Brandon Roy (2006) \u2013 stayed to use all their NCAA eligibility. \u201cI try not to look at that much,\u201d said Hutchison, a polished communications major in interviews. \u201cSome people are ready after one year, others it takes four years. My situation, I wouldn\u2019t change it for the world, the opportunity I had to play four years of college and still being able to pursue my career. Lucky enough to be a first-round pick and still have a lot of room to grow. \u201cI\u2019ve noticed that it\u2019s a lot smaller bridge [to learn how to be professional]. I tend to pick up things quicker. And just try to learn.\u201d  Hutchison didn\u2019t get traction here quite like Carter. His most reliable skills this week have been his rebounding (a 7.0 average through his first four appearances) and his ability to push the ball up the floor. His year-over-year development at Boise State was obvious: From 3.1 ppg to 6.8, 17.4 and 20.0, with a floor game and leadership role that grew over time. \u201cI was talking to his [Boise State] coach, Leon Rice,\u201d Hoiberg said. \u201cThey had a player by the name of Anthony Drmic who was from Australia \u2013 we played against Boise in Hawaii when I was still coaching in college [Iowa State] \u2013 and he was a tough kid. He beat the hell out of Chandler every day his freshman year. He showed him what it was like to really work and made him a more physical player. \u201cHe just continued to get better every year. Listen, he\u2019s a four-year player and he\u2019s 22 years old. That\u2019s still pretty young to me.\u201d Said Hutchison, who had 11 points and seven boards in the loss to the Pistons Saturday: \u201cDefinitely from having the ball in my hands a lot at Boise State allows me to stay kind of calm in those situations and direct some of the guys who maybe haven\u2019t been in that situation. But me, personally, still, I\u2019m learning and it\u2019s a lot.\u201d Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Agent Mark Bartelstein confirmed the deal shortly after the Milwaukee Bucks rescinded their qualifying offer. That made Parker an unrestricted free agent, clearing the way for him to join the rebuilding Bulls. The team announced the move as well , with general manager Gar Forman calling Parker a \u201cnatural fit\u201d with the Bulls\u2019 rebuilding core. \u201cJabari is a 23-year-old player who is a natural fit with our young core, and is a proven scorer at the NBA level,\u201d Forman said in a statement. \u201cWe look forward to welcoming him back to his hometown.\u201d The 23-year-old Parker led Chicago\u2019s Simeon Career Academy to four state championships and starred for one season at Duke before the Bucks drafted him with the No. 2 overall pick in 2014. The Bulls are banking on him to stay healthy after he tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee twice in four seasons with Milwaukee. Parker has averaged 15.3 points and 5.5 rebounds. His best season was in 2016-17 when he averaged 20.1 points in 51 games before tearing his ACL a second time. He played 31 games last year, averaging 12.6 points and 4.9 rebounds. \u201cJabari and I felt it was in the best interest of both he and the team to rescind our qualifying offer, making him an unrestricted free agent,\u201d Bucks general manager Jon Horst said. \u201cWe appreciate everything Jabari has brought to our team and our community over the last four years and we wish him well.\u201d Bartelstein praised the Bucks for \u201cworking side-by-side with us.\u201d \u201cFrom the moment the Bucks drafted Jabari with the No. 2 pick in the 2014 Draft, they have gone out of their way to treat Jabari as a member of the Bucks family, and this is another perfect example of doing exactly that, and we\u2019re very appreciative,\u201d he said. Parker goes from playing alongside superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo to trying to help the Bulls rise in the Eastern Conference after a 27-win season. He figures to start at small forward, with Kris Dunn and Zach LaVine in the backcourt, Lauri Markkanen at power forward and either rookie Wendell Carter Jr. or veteran Robin Lopez at center. The son of former NBA player Sonny Parker, Jabari Parker was one of the most highly touted prospects to come out of Illinois. He played at the same high school as Derrick Rose, who was drafted by the Bulls with the No. 1 pick in 2008 and became the youngest MVP in league history three years later. Of course, knee injuries derailed his run in Chicago. And the Bulls are hoping Parker\u2019s injuries are behind him. Chicago also released guard Julyan Stone and forward Paul Zipser on Saturday.

The former Pistons standout was back in the Detroit area Friday night as part of the BIG3 \u2014 entertainer Ice Cube\u2019s 3-on-3 league of former NBA players, which made a stop at Little Caesars Arena. Billups had talks with the Cavaliers last year but did not join their front office. When Detroit overhauled its organization this year, he seemed like a potential fit, but that didn\u2019t happen either. \u201cMy desire is to one day run a team, be in a front office and try to build a champion,\u201d Billups said. \u201cI know that I will and I know I\u2019m going to do a good job. When that opportunity presents itself, and it\u2019s a good opportunity, I\u2019ll be ready to go.\u201d The Pistons were run by Stan Van Gundy \u2014 their coach and president of basketball operations \u2014 for the past four seasons, but they moved in a different direction this offseason. Dwane Casey was hired as Detroit\u2019s new coach, and Ed Stefanski came on board as a senior executive. \u201cI thought Stan did a good job. Stan is a very good coach, but sometimes you just need a new voice,\u201d Billups said. \u201cCoach Casey obviously has been a very good coach the last few years, he\u2019s really ascended to the top of the ranks in the league. Whatever happened in Toronto presented an opportunity for him to come here.\u201d In one offseason, Casey has been fired by the Toronto Raptors, got hired by the Pistons and was named NBA Coach of the Year. Billups is still viewed fondly in Detroit after leading the Pistons to the NBA title in 2004. The team played at The Palace of Auburn Hills back then. The Pistons played their first season at downtown Little Caesars Arena in 2017-18. \u201cIt\u2019s always good to be here. Everybody knows how much I love the city, love the fans. Obviously, I never had the opportunity to play in this building. I wish we would have. I wish we played in the city when we were here,\u201d Billups said. \u201cBut The Palace was good to us. The city was good to us, the fans. So it\u2019s always good to be back here. I\u2019m such a big Pistons fan. \u2026 I\u2019m excited for the team for next year. The East is wide open, and I\u2019m excited for the team. New coach, new everything.\u201d As for Friday\u2019s BIG3 competition, Billups\u2019 team \u2014 the Killer 3s \u2014 lost the night\u2019s opening game. Metta World Peace of the Killer 3s was ejected. That was an unusual development in what Billups said should be a light-hearted league. \u201cWe\u2019re doing this for fun,\u201d Billups said. \u201cIt ain\u2019t that serious. So that\u2019s kind of my message. We\u2019re out here to just have fun, compete, have a good time, enjoy the fans of Detroit, enjoy every single city that we go to, and go home to our family and chill and relax. That\u2019s what this thing is all about to me.\u201d World Peace, of course, was the most infamous participant in the brawl between the Pistons and his Pacers at The Palace in 2004. On Friday night, he punted the ball away early in the game and was tossed \u2013 although it was a bit of a shank. \u201cI told him in the locker room, `If you was going to kick it, you should have put it in the top row or the top deck at least,\u201d\u2018 Billups said. \u201cIt was a weak kick.\u201d"},{"id":39349,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/hawks-clippers-summer-league-recap","date":"2018-07-14","title":"Game Recap: Atlanta Hawks 97, LA Clippers 81","content":"Joel Bartilotta, Rotowire LAS VEGAS \u2014 The Atlanta Hawks defeated the Los Angeles Clippers, 97-81, in the Las Vegas Summer League at Thomas and Mack Center on Friday.

Wilcox, Indiana Pacers With Pacers\u2019 first round pick Aaron Holiday sitting out the team\u2019s final game here, Wilcox stepped into the void with a commanding performance in the Pacers\u2019 116-79 win over the Brooklyn Nets. He led the Pacers with 22 points, draining six 3-pointers. The 28th pick in the 2014 draft (Clippers), Wilcox also did stints with the Orlando Magic, Portland Trail Blazers and Golden State Warriors over the past three seasons. He\u2019s a jumbo-sized point guard (6-5, 195 pounds) who has struggled to find a permanent fit. But he flashed some of the potential Friday that made him a first-round pick out of the University of Washington. Mitchell Robinson, New York Knicks Robinson, the long and lean (7-1, 225 pounds) center the Knicks drafted with the 36th pick in last month\u2019s draft, is another player who took advantage of the absence of a first rounder. With Kevin Knox in street clothes, Robinson continued to show signs that he could be an elite-level rim protector one day. He swatted five shots to go along with his 14 points and 12 rebounds in a 102-83 win over the New Orleans Pelicans. Fellow big man Daniel Ochefu led the Knicks with 22 points and eight rebounds off the bench. But it was Robinson\u2019s activity on both ends that stood out the most for the Knicks. Shaquille Harrison, Phoenix Suns Javonte Green (20 points, five rebounds) might have had more highlight reel plays, but it was Harrison who controlled the action in the Suns\u2019 90-55 thumping of the San Antonio Spurs. A 6-4, 190-pound guard who played his college ball at Tulsa, Harrison dominated during his time on the court, finishing with 13 points, seven assists, six rebounds and three blocks for a team that didn\u2019t have the services of the No. 1 overall pick in last month\u2019s draft, Deandre Ayton, who was held out of action along with Josh Jackson and Elie Okobo. Troy Brown Jr. and Devin Robinson, Washington Wizards So what if it was in a losing effort, Troy Brown Jr. and Robinson both put their marks on the Wizards\u2019 final game of the summer league season. Brown, the first-round pick from the University of Oregon, led the 25 points, six rebounds and three steals, once again showing off the all-around game that impressed the Wizards in the first place. Robinson, who scored 20 or more points in three of his five Summer League games, turned in the dunk of the day among his 13 points. He also added 12 rebounds in the Wizards\u2019 finale, a 98-92 loss to the Dallas Mavericks. https:\/\/twitter.com\/NBATV\/status\/1017917199527186432%20 Deonte Burton, Oklahoma City Thunder One of the most intriguing players (a 6-5, 250-pound \u2026 guard?) on any roster during the Summer League, Burton put on show off the bench for the Thunder. The former Iowa State star took over late in a tight game, finishing off the Orlando Magic at the buzzer with pull-up jumper in the lane as time expired and the Thunder won 87-85. Burton has a wicked mix of size, athleticism and ball skills that don\u2019t fit into conventional stereotype. But he obviously knew what to do with the game on the line and the bright lights on. He also added eight rebounds, five assists and three steals to his impressive night. Even with a host of other high-profile rookies on the Thunder roster, it speaks volumes that Burton was the man with the ball in his hands with the game on the line. Junior Robinson, Hawks With Trae Young on the sidelines in street clothes the diminutive Robinson (he \u2019 s listed at a generous 5-5 and 150 pounds), a rookie from Mount St. Mary \u2019 s, put on a show of his own in the Hawks \u2019  97-81 win over the Los Angeles Clippers. Robinson was the quickest man on the floor from start to finish and used his speed advantage time and again to shred the Clippers \u2019  defense. He took over the game in the second half and finished with 20 points, 13 in the second half. Robinson \u2019 s big night overshadowed the performance of Alpha Kaba, the French power forward the Hawks drafted with the 60th pick of the 2017 draft. Kaba played beautifully off of Robinson, finishing his night with 18 points and 15 rebounds.

The urgency that hounds NBA coaches daily for most of the calendar year \u2013 the next play, the next basket, the next decision, the next opponent \u2013 barely makes it to town for the Summer League basketball. \u201cWorking vacation\u201d might be stretching it, but those guys rarely look or act more rested and content. They amble in and out of games at the two gyms on the UNLV campus. They sit up in the stands while a trusty assistant works the sideline for their teams\u2019 summer entries. And they schmooze for hours with friends and rivals, their dukes down, their motors on idle. Six months ago, though? Six months from now? Forget it. All the demands, all the pressures, all the work undone seize up on them. It\u2019s long hours, heavy pressures, bad diets and worse habits . \u201cIt\u2019s always in the back of your mind,\u201d Denver coach Mike Malone said. \u201cStress can do a lot of damage, and this job is a very stressful job.\u201d Malone, at that moment, was filling out paperwork in advance of a free health screening set up Thursday and Friday by the National Basketball Coaches Association [NBCA]. It was a new program at Summer League this year that the NBCA intends to provide annually for head and assistant coaches, a benefit of membership in a profession that almost necessitates it. \u201cDuring the season, there\u2019s ups and downs with your health,\u201d Minnesota assistant coach Andy Greer said after his screening and results review was over. \u201cI don\u2019t take care of myself as well as I should. In the offseason, I try to get caught up and make sure that no damage is done.\u201d Problem is, the NBA offseason has been getting shorter while the season seems to get longer. Several head coaches have had to step away from the grind in recent seasons: Golden State\u2019s Steve Kerr, 52, was coping with a spinal issue when he yielded to assistant Luke Walton for the first 43 games of 2015-16. Cleveland\u2019s Tyronn Lue, 41, tapped out for 15 days this spring while suffering from anxiety and other effects of stress, including sharp chest pains that were found not be related to his heart. Lue has changed his diet, began exercising more regularly and was prescribed medication. And new Orlando coach Steve Clifford \u2013 who had a heart scare in November 2013 that cost him only one game in his first season with Charlotte but required two surgically placed stents \u2013 got sidelined for more than five weeks on the Hornets\u2019 schedule last season by severe headaches that his doctors linked to a chronic sleep shortage. \u201cMy body was telling me, \u2018You can\u2019t do this,\u2019\u201d Clifford, 56, said while watching his Magic squad Thursday. \u201cWhen you start reading about sleep, some of the stuff can scare. Just how it affects your general health.\u201d  Said Greer, who also has served on staffs in Toronto, Chicago, Memphis, Houston and New York: \u201cI\u2019m going to be 56. I owe it to my family to be healthy. I had a mini-stroke one time. I\u2019ve had high blood pressure and high cholesterol. I monitor it and try to do the best that I can with it. But this is awesome.\u201d Approximately 60 coaches underwent screenings over the two days. The coaches met with health professionals in the upper level of the Mendenhall Center, and went through a series of stations and tests that included an electrocardiograph, an echocardiogram, a carotid ultrasound, blood work, an orthopedic scan and consultations with a cardiologist and an orthopedist. The service was contracted with Athletic Heart, an Orlando-based company that provides mobile testing to sport-oriented clients. CEO Wes Stokes mentioned a variety of NCAA athletic programs and professional sports franchises that utilize Athletic Heart. The firm has worked with various leagues\u2019 players unions, as well as the retired players associations in basketball and football. \u201cIf these guys had to go do this on their own,\u201d Stokes said, touting the convenience of geographically bringing the health care to the patients, \u201cthis would be three or four days probably of doctors\u2019 appointments, plus all the scheduling and commuting time. And probably cost them thousands of dollars, depending where they went, given the number of doctors and follow-ups they\u2019d see. \u201cSo many of these guys here walk out thinking it\u2019s great. The ones who didn\u2019t show, for whatever reason, will hear it from this group. And next year, they\u2019ll come in.\u201d The concerns about health have been heightened in the NBA in recent years by the deaths of a number of alumni, in some cases well before traditional life expectancies. Among them: Moses Malone, Darryl Dawkins, Anthony Mason. Last week, Clifford Rozier \u2013 a first-round pick by Golden State in 1994 \u2013 and former Seattle forward Lonnie Shelton died of heart attacks. Rozier was 45, Shelton 62. Another benefit of this program is generating electronic medical records for the coaches that can be accessed and updated whenever, wherever. \u201cSo if they leave one team and go to another,\u201d Stokes said, \u201cor have a house in Florida but are out in California, their records are with them all the time. Think of it like a medical passport that you can have with you wherever you go.\u201d Information about each coaches\u2019 family health history, and current medications, also is included. And while the coaches reviewed their results with the health professionals on site, Stokes said Athletic First has physician\u2019s assistants who will contact them quarterly or so to verify the action plan discussed. \u201cWe had one test today \u2013 checking your carotid artery \u2013 that I\u2019ve never had done,\u201d Indiana assistant Dan Burke said. \u201cThat\u2019s the main reason I went in, just to find out what that is. They said mine was clear, so \u2026 okay.\u201d Burke, 59, said the Pacers have their coaches, like their players, undergo full check-ups before each season. That means stress tests, physicals and meetings with the team\u2019s nutritionist. And head coach Nate McMillan had his whole staff participate in the Vegas screenings. \u201cI\u2019ve always felt they\u2019ve had our backs on that,\u201d Burke said. \u201cBut you can see where the lifestyle, a routine, could put that out of whack. You could easily skip on sleep, skip on exercise. Take the fast track food-wise. \u201cMy dad was a guy who always said, \u2018You only need three hours of sleep.\u2019 And I kind of lived by that for a long time. My first few years in the NBA, when I wasn\u2019t sleeping at all, I finally felt, \u2018Man, what am I doing?\u2019\u201d Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg did not get screened this week, only because he submitted to one for former NBA players at the scouting combine in Chicago in May. Hoiberg was only 32, still active with the Timberwolves and had just led the NBA in 3-point percentage in 2004-05 when he got a health scare with which he has lived ever since. \u201cI went in for a routine life-insurance exam and that\u2019s how I found out I had a ticking time bomb in my chest,\u201d said Hoiberg, who was diagnosed with an aortic valve issue. \u201cI was in the best shape of my life at that time, but I had a life-threatening condition that I needed open-heart surgery to correct.\u201d Hoiberg, who subsequently had a pacemaker inserted, probably is more informed and conscientious about his health than a lot of generally healthy coaches. He doesn\u2019t wear a necktie during games to avoid any tightness or constriction of blood flow. Still, his screening in May, he said, revealed some blood numbers that had crept up; he has been encouraged to cut back on red meat. The health screenings, along nutrition, sleep and stress management info provided more readily these days by teams and by the NBCA to its members, are a great start. Ultimately, it\u2019s on the coaches to heed the advice and embrace some changes. \u201cIt\u2019s about routine, about being organized,\u201d said the Pacers\u2019 Burke, who has learned to give himself mental getaways from the job\u2019s demands. \u201cThe last few years, I try to pick up something to teach myself,\u201d he said. \u201cLately it\u2019s been fly-fishing. I\u2019ve been tying flies. It\u2019s a good release. When I\u2019m home, I try not to even talk about work. Before that it was grilling techniques, cooking up some ribs and rotisserie chicken, just trying to dive into one new thing each summer.\u201d Malone, 47, is the son of longtime NBA coach Brendan Malone, so he grew up seeing the demands of the profession and how his father coped. \u201cYou have to have an outlet and you have to have balance to give yourself the best chance to stay healthy,\u201d Malone said. \u201cYou have to find time to exercise. You have to make sure you\u2019re eating right. The travel, the late nights, it\u2019s not very conducive to a healthy lifestyle. That\u2019s where discipline comes in.\u201d Lue talked after his return about the NBA playoffs being one of his \u201chappy places,\u201d the excitement and challenge outweighing any pressure or stress. Malone has a different version of getting away. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten into biking,\u201d he said. \u201cI used to run, but my body can\u2019t take the running anymore. So now I\u2019m mountain biking in Colorado, even in the season if the weather cooperates. On the road, it\u2019s walking in cities and finding ways to get out and get some time to yourself a little bit.\u201d Besides serving as a release valve, that high-altitude training must be doing wonders for Malone\u2019s lung capacity, someone suggested. \u201cAnd the referees can vouch for that,\u201d he said, with a healthy laugh.

(AP) \u2014 Whether the Pelicans are better off with Julius Randle and Elfrid Payton than they were with DeMarcus Cousins and Rajon Rondo remains to be seen. All general manager Dell Demps could do on Friday, as he sat between his two new players, was offer assurances that New Orleans All-Star Anthony Davis was an ardent advocate for signing Randle and suggest that the \u201dtwo-way\u201d abilities of Payton and Randle give the Pelicans a promising opportunity to build on a formula that served them well late last season. \u201dWhen we finished the season last year, we felt like found a rhythm, found an identity,\u201d Demps said, alluding to the playoff push and first-round sweep of Portland that the Pelicans pulled off without Cousins, who was rehabilitating his torn left Achilles tendon. \u201dWe feel like the team\u2019s improved,\u201d Demps said. \u201dOn paper, everything looks really good. But, obviously, we have to do it on the court.\u201d Before Cousins spurned New Orleans in favor of a one-year, reported $5.3 million deal to join defending champion Golden State this month, the Pelicans\u2019 party line had been that they wanted Cousins back. But with Cousins still recovering from a serious injury, the Pelicans would not offer the maximum allowable contract for NBA free agents who are eight-year veterans: Five years and around $177 million. They tried to negotiate a shorter deal instead, to no avail. Cousins, who turns 28 next month, was named a 2018 All-Star before his injury in late January. He averaged 25.2 points and 12.9 rebounds in 48 games last season. But Cousins also averaged five turnovers and regularly could be seen lingering near the basket after missed shots, expressing dissatisfaction with officiating while opponents raced five-on-four the other way. After Cousins\u2019 injury, the Pelicans improved defensively, played with a faster pace and went 21-13 to finish the regular season sixth in the Western Conference. \u201dObviously we want to build off the success we had last year,\u201d Demps said, emphasizing that Randle and Payton \u201dare two-way players\u201d who can \u201dpush the ball in transition.\u201d In addition to talking up Randle\u2019s and Payton\u2019s defensive play, Demps highlighted their relative youth and repeatedly referred to them as \u201dunselfish.\u201d The 6-foot-9 Randle, who turns 24 in November, averaged 16.1 points and eight rebounds in just 27 minutes per game with the Los Angeles Lakers last season. He also led Los Angeles in assists seven times. Demps said he heard from Davis the moment word spread that the Lakers had decided to let Randle go after agreeing to terms with LeBron James. \u201dI was like, \u2018Yeah, we\u2019re on it,\u201d\u2019 a grinning Demps recalled. Randle said Davis also called him \u201dlike three times in a row to pretty much get the job done.\u201d Randle called Davis\u2019 outreach a \u201dvery important\u201d factor in his decision. \u201dIt\u2019s their star player,\u201d Randle said of Davis, whom he also knew because they both played in college at Kentucky. \u201dSo for him to see me fit in well to that plan A and a part of their future means a lot.\u201d Randle also said he expects his game to improve alongside a dynamic front-court player like Davis, who Randle said will be \u201dthe best player in his prime that I\u2019ve played with.\u201d Randle also played one full season with Kobe Bryant in Los Angeles in 2015-16, but that was the last of Bryant\u2019s 20 seasons. Like Randle, the 23-year-old Payton is entering his fifth NBA season, having averaged 12.7 points and 6.2 assists last season Orlando and Phoenix. Rondo, who will turn 33 next season, averaged 8.3 points and 8.2 rebounds last season. But his production spiked in the playoffs, when he averaged 10.3 points and 12.2 rebounds \u2013 and displayed a knack for finding Davis with lobs at the rim. While the 6-4 Payton is a New Orleans native who played in college at Louisiana-Lafayette, he downplayed how much his Louisiana ties influenced his decision to sign with the Pelicans. \u201dIt didn\u2019t matter if this team was in \u2013 wherever,\u201d Payton said. \u201dI just felt like this was the best fit. \u201dI\u2019m best in transition, when we\u2019re pushing the ball,\u201d Payton added. \u201dIt definitely fits my strengths.\u201d Demps said he had studied Payton since before the guard turned pro and \u201dalways felt like he was a great fit for our group, especially the way we want to play.\u201d"},{"id":39387,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/knicks-pelicans-summer-league-recap-friday","date":"2018-07-13","title":"Game Recap: Knicks 102, Pelicans 83","content":"By Joel Bartilotta, Rotowire LAS VEGAS \u2014 The New York Knicks defeated the New Orleans Pelicans, 102-83, in Las Vegas Summer League at Thomas and Mack Center on Friday.

His move to the Los Angeles Lakers cleared the way for perhaps several teams to have a shot at a Finals berth \u2014 something that wasn\u2019t possible the last eight seasons in the East as LeBron\u2019s teams made The Finals every time in that span. The Boston Celtics pushed James\u2019 2017-18 team, the Cleveland Cavaliers, to the brink of elimination in the East finals. However, James and Co. squeezed by Boston in Game 7 , toppling a Celtics squad that did not have Kyrie Irving or Gordon Hayward. One player on the court for that Game 7 and Boston\u2019s playoff run, forward Jaylen Brown, said he was hoping James would opt to stay in the East for a few more years. Ultimately, though, James opted to sign with the Lakers in free agency . That left Brown a little disappointed he won\u2019t be seeing James in a playoff setting until at least The Finals stage. Steve Bulpett of the Boston Herald caught up with Brown in Las Vegas during NBA Summer League, and the Celtics\u2019 youngster shared his thoughts on LeBron\u2019s move and more : Brown was among a Celtics contingent sitting courtside that included Irving, Celtics president of basketball operations Danny Ainge and others. Ainge was quick to point out recently that he views the LeBron-less Eastern Conference as a formidable bunch and, for the most part, Brown and Co. believe that as well. By the same token, the Celtics also know that if they have a fully healthy roster, they can make a serious run at their first Finals berth since 2010, writes Bulpett. Hayward and Irving are still working their way back from their respective injuries. Ainge said Wednesday that the duo \u201cshould be playing full-court basketball by the time they get back to Boston sometime in August.\u201d Irving missed the final 15 games of the 2017-18 season and the entire playoffs to repair his left knee. Hayward missed the season after suffering a gruesome leg injury in the Celtics\u2019 season-opening game.

After posting a double-double Saturday, the 28-year-old scored 31 points with eight rebounds, four assists, two steals and a block in 31 minutes of the Heat\u2019s 110-106 victory over New Orleans. Jones played most recently in Turkey for Pinar Karsiyaka, averaging 18.8 points last season. Cheick Diallo, New Orleans Pelicans Diallo handled the other half of the dynamic performance of power forwards in the Heat-Pelicans game. The third-year forward, drafted No. 33 overall out of Kansas in 2016, scored 28 points with 13 rebounds in his 32 minutes, with five of those boards coming on offense. Diallo, who has averaged 4.9 points and 4.1 rebounds in 11.3 minutes in part of two seasons for New Orleans, shot 9-for-12 from the field and drained all 10 of his foul shots. Mitchell Robinson, New York Knicks In time, Robinson might be known as more than the answer to a trivia question about last year\u2019s trade of Carmelo Anthony from New York to Oklahoma City. For now, he is lugging around the fact that he\u2019s the guy drafted with the 2018 second-round pick the Thunder threw into that deal. In just his fourth Vegas game \u2013 admittedly, it\u2019s Summer League \u2013 the slender 7-footer, selected 36th overall last month, put up numbers Anthony might have trouble touching wherever he lands this season: 17 points on 8-of-10 shooting, 12 rebounds (seven on the offensive glass), three steals and six blocked shots in the Knicks\u2019 loss to Boston. Robinson, by the way, didn\u2019t even play college ball last season, dropping out of Western Kentucky to train privately for this opportunity. Jevon Carter and Markel Crawford, Memphis Grizzlies Through the Grizzlies\u2019 first three games here, Carter (18) and Crawford (two) had combined to score 20 points in 82 minutes. But in beating Oklahoma City 92-85, the two guards totaled 40 points on 15-of-27 shooting. Carter in particular had stirred some concerns as the No. 32 pick in last month\u2019s Draft, looking overmatched at times through this event\u2019s first six days. But he was good early and late against the Thunder, finishing with 19 points, eight rebounds and eight assists. Crawford did his damage off the bench, scoring 15 of his 21 points to hep Memphis build a 48-27 halftime lead. Honorable mention for the Grizz: Lottery pick Jaren Jackson Jr. had 16 points, six boards and three blocks. Christian Wood, Milwaukee Bucks Roster limits might get in the way with the Bucks, but Wood still can attract attention for other NBA teams in his quest for an opportunity this fall. The 6-foot-11 center made himself at home with 26 points, 15 rebounds and one block in Milwaukee\u2019s 83-75 overtime victory. Wood, who went undrafted after turning professional in 2015, has bounced through two brief NBA stints with Philadelphia and Charlotte, three G League stays and a flirtation (but no appearances) with a Chinese team. He averaged 23.3 points and 10.4 rebounds for Delaware last season in the NBA\u2019s development league. Josh Hart, Los Angeles Lakers The starters were dominant for the Lakers in their drubbing of the rival Clippers, and Hart led the way with 20 points, six rebounds, two steals and two blocks. In holding the Clippers to just 12 points in the first quarter and 12 more in the third, the Lakers went wire-to-wire and had three starters with massive plus\/minus ratings: Hart (plus-21), Alex Caruso (plus-20) and Johnathan Williams (plus-23). Diamond Stone, Utah Jazz Stone, a second-round pick out of Maryland in 2016, mostly has knocked around the G League, working to add shooting range to fit more comfortably in the modern world of NBA bigs. But the 6-foot-11, 255-pound native of Milwaukee didn\u2019t launch a shot from beyond the arc in scoring 14 points against Orlando. Stone got six of his 11 rebounds on the offensive end and chipped in a couple blocks in the Jazz\u2019s victory. Jake Layman, Portland Trail Blazers Trae Young was given the night off by Atlanta, so it was left to Layman to step into the 3-point spotlight. The stretch forward who averaged 1.0 point per game in 35 appearances last season with the Blazers and shot 20 percent from the arc (4-for-20 in 160 total minutes), drained four of his five attempts from deep in Portland\u2019s rout of the Hawks. The former second-round pick from Maryland finished with 20 points on 8-of-13 shooting overall and so far has hit 12 of 18 3-pointers."},{"id":39396,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-denver-nuggets-ship-kenneth-faried-darrell-arthur-future-pick-brooklyn","date":"2018-07-13","title":"Reports: Denver Nuggets send Kenneth Faried, Darrell Arthur, future pick to Brooklyn Nets","content":" After doling out new contracts to Nikola Jokic and Will Barton, the Denver Nuggets have some reported deals in place to help keep their payroll for 2018-19 under control.

Gina Mizell of The Denver Post has more on what the trade means for Denver\u2019s bottom line : The Nuggets would have faced a significant luxury tax bill after doling out a max contract to Jokic and a reported four-year deal for Barton. Instead, Denver was able to deal the final years of Faried and Arthur\u2019s contracts for the added price of a protected first-round pick in exchange for Whitehead, whom ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski reports will be waived. Brooklyn, meanwhile, continues to slowly restock its cache of Draft picks after recovering from the ill-fated trade for Kevin Garnett and Paul Pierce with Boston in 2013. The deal also allows the Nets a look at Faried, a former USA Basketball standout who has averaged 12.3 points and 8.7 rebounds per game as a starter during his seven-year career. His role shifted to the bench over the two years, especially after Denver signed free agent forward Paul Millsap a year ago.

The Hawks now add Lin, who has one year remaining on his contract, to that guard mix.

According to multiple reports, Denver has come to terms with free-agent guard Isaiah Thomas on a one-year deal. Thomas, a two-time All-Star with the Boston Celtics, struggled last season while trying to recover from a hip injury that ultimately required hip surgery in March. Here\u2019s more from Gina Mizell of The Denver Post on the pact between the Nuggets and Thomas : This reported addition of Thomas wasn\u2019t the only move the Nuggets made on Thursday. They also reportedly traded forwards Darrell Arthur and Kenneth Faried as well a 2019 first-round pick to the Brooklyn Nets for Isaiah Whitehead in a move to clear up salary cap space for Denver. Thomas, the 60th and last pick of the 2011 NBA Draft, made a name for himself as a clutch scorer with the Boston Celtics after his previous two teams (Sacramento and Phoenix) parted ways with him. In two-and-a-half seasons with Boston, the 5-foot-9 guard averaged 24.7 points and six assists per game. In 2016-17, Thomas was the driving force behind the Celtics\u2019 run to the Eastern Conference Finals while earning All-NBA Second Team honors along the way. That playoff run ended, however, with a hip injury that lingered well past Boston dealing him to Cleveland in exchange for Kyrie Irving. Thomas played just 15 games for the Cavaliers before he was again dealt, this time to the Los Angeles Lakers. He suited up in 17 games for the Lakers before hip surgery ended a season in which he shot just 37.3 percent. ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski further reports that Thomas\u2019 deal with Denver will be for one year at the veteran\u2019s minimum. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times during the 2017-18 season, Thomas told Tania Ganguli that he was open to staying in L.A. \u2014 even in a reserve role . Those words came less than a week after Thomas told USA Today \u2018s Sam Amick that \u201cI\u2019m not no sixth man. And I won\u2019t be a sixth man (in the future). I just want everybody to know that, like clear as can be \u2026\u201d Additionally, Thomas told NBA.com\u2019s Shaun Powell in a late February he wants a long-term deal in free agency . \u201cI\u2019m looking to sign a long-term deal this summer but anything can happen. I can\u2019t control it and can\u2019t worry too much about it. I was only in Sacramento for three years, Boston for almost three years and the other stops were temporary. I\u2019m looking hopefully to sign long term and call someplace home.\u201d For the Nuggets, the move to add Thomas bolsters their already considerable depth. The franchise re-signed star center Nikola Jokic and sixth man Will Barton to a long-term contracts on July 9, roughly two weeks after drafting Michael Porter Jr. with the No. 14 pick in the 2018 NBA Draft ."},{"id":46677,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/lakers-clippers-summer-league-tourney-recap","date":"2018-07-13","title":"Game Recap: Lakers 82, Clippers 69","content":"By Joel Bartilotta, Rotowire LAS VEGAS \u2014 The Los Angeles Lakers defeated the Los Angeles Clippers, 82-69, in the second-round of the Summer League Playoffs at Thomas and Mack Center on Thursday.

Oakley was arrested Sunday at the Cosmopolitan casino-resort on the Las Vegas Strip on suspicion of committing or attempting to commit a fraudulent act in a gaming establishment, the Nevada Gaming Control Board said in a statement. The agency said Oakley is suspected of \u201dadding to or reducing his wager\u201d on a game after the outcome was known. Oakley was booked and later released from jail. The regulatory agency would not release details of the circumstances surrounding the arrest. The Cosmopolitan said in a statement that it had \u201dno details with regards to any alleged activity and will not comment on our guests\u2019 experience.\u201d Oakley\u2019s attorney, David Chesnoff, told The Associated Press on Thursday that he is \u201dpresently investigating the facts.\u201d Court records show Oakley is scheduled to appear in court Aug. 7. The felony count carries between one and six years in prison and a $10,000 fine. The 6-foot-8 Oakley was a rugged enforcer playing alongside Patrick Ewing and has kept his tough-guy persona long after retirement, trading barbs with former rival Charles Barkley. Oakley played for the Knicks from 1988 to 1998, helping them become one of the top teams in the Eastern Conference. But they have been one of the worst franchises of the last 15 years, and Oakley\u2019s criticisms of the team and management has led to a strained relationship with the organization. Last year, he was escorted from his seats at Madison Square Garden and arrested after an altercation near team owner James Dolan. He was cleared of the misdemeanor assault charges in February. Oakley filed a lawsuit against Dolan alleging that he was the one assaulted. Las Vegas-based attorney Adam Solinger, who is not involved in Oakley\u2019s case, said very few people end up with a felony conviction when they commit a gambling violation, unless \u201dthe cheating is more sophisticated.\u201d He said cases are sometimes resolved as misdemeanor offenses with fines. Solinger said a casino would be well within its rights to ban a cheating patron, and other casinos who hear about the patron\u2019s actions may choose to watch that person more closely."},{"id":39415,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/suns-sixers-summer-league-tourney-recap","date":"2018-07-13","title":"Game Recap: 76ers 88, Suns 86","content":"By Joel Bartilotta, Rotowire LAS VEGAS \u2014 The Philadelphia 76ers defeated the Phoenix Suns, 88-86, in the Las Vegas Summer League Playoffs at Thomas and Mack Center on Thursday.

Ainge talked with reporters yesterday about that topic and more, including the fate of restricted free agent guard Marcus Smart, after the team\u2019s practice in Las Vegas for NBA Summer League. As to the topic of the East hierarchy, Ainge says where Boston fits into that mix is something he\u2019s not overrating. Adam Himmelsbach of the Boston Globe  has more from Ainge: Smart remains on the free-agent market and recently told reporters he had \u201cno idea\u201d about where he stands with the Celtics contract-wise. Per Himmelsbach, Smart has met with several teams in Las Vegas, but the issue remains few teams have the salary cap room to offer him the kind of deal he is seeking. Additionally, the Celtics can match whatever offer Smart receives from another team. Smart also has until Oct. 1 to sign the qualifying offer Boston offered him for next season, which would make him an unrestricted free agent in 2019. To Ainge, keeping Smart is a priority however you slice it. Hayward and Irving continue to work their way back from their respective injuries and Ainge said Wednesday that the duo \u201cshould be playing full-court basketball by the time they get back to Boston sometime in August.\u201d * * *"},{"id":39417,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/warriors-hornets-vegas-summer-league-recap","date":"2018-07-12","title":"Game Recap: Hornets 87, Warriors 69","content":"By Oscar Heanue, Rotowire LAS VEGAS \u2014 The Charlotte Hornets blew out the Golden State Warriors, 87-69, in Las Vegas Summer League at Thomas and Mack Center on Wednesday evening. Charlotte struck first and never looked back, preventing the Warriors from ever gaining the lead in the game. Relatively strong jump shooting helped the Hornets jump out to a 10-point lead in the first quarter. That advantage continued to build throughout, as Charlotte led by as much as 23 by the game\u2019s end. The Hornets\u2019 starting frontcourt dominated, as Dwayne Bacon, Miles Bridges, and Willy Hernangomez each scored at least 17 points in the blowout win. Bridges, Charlotte\u2019s 2018 first-round pick, added eight rebounds, two assists, a steal, and a block to his strong scoring effort. Hernangomez, meanwhile, shot 7-of-11 from the floor en route to 18 points. The Warriors were led by center Marcus Derrickson, who shot 8-of-15 en route to 20 points. Rion Brown added 13 points. No other Warrior scored in double figures, however, as the team shot just 36 percent in the wire-to-wire loss that sends them to a consolation game."}]
