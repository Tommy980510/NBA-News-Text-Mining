She will join the WNBA on July 17 and report to Silver, once her four-year term as CEO with Deloitte concludes. The WNBA\u2019s 23rd season tips off on May 24.  \u201c Cathy is a world-class business leader with a deep connection to women\u2019s basketball, which makes her the ideal person to lead the WNBA into its next phase of growth,\u201d said Silver. \u201cThe WNBA will benefit significantly from her more than 30 years of business and operational experience including revenue generation, sharp entrepreneurial instincts and proven management abilities.\u201d  Engelbert was elected CEO by Deloitte\u2019s partners in 2015, where she led one of the largest professional services organizations in the U.S. with more than 100,000 professionals. Over the course of her tenure, she has led a large transformation across the business by moving the firm towards emerging technologies such as AI, blockchain, robotics and cloud, including securing ecosystem partnerships with large technology companies, and executing digital acquisitions. During her tenure, revenues grew over 30%, and Engelbert drove a people-first agenda, including implementing a holistic well-being culture through programs like Deloitte\u2019s 16-week family leave policy. \u201cIt is an absolute privilege to be joining the WNBA at such an exciting and important time in its history,\u201d said Engelbert. \u201cI see tremendous opportunity to bolster visibility for the sport of women\u2019s basketball, empower the players, and enhance fan engagement. I look forward to using my business expertise and passion for basketball to promote  women in the game and beyond, and to working with the teams and world-class athletes to help grow this league into a thriving business.\u201d Engelbert received a BS in accounting from Lehigh University and is a certified public accountant licensed in Pennsylvania, New York and New Jersey. During her time at Lehigh, Engelbert was a member of the university\u2019s basketball and lacrosse teams and served as a senior captain for both teams. On the court, she played for former Lehigh coach and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer Muffet McGraw. Engelbert\u2019s father, Kurt, played for Naismith Hall of Fame coach Jack Ramsay at Saint Joseph\u2019s University and was drafted in 1957 by the NBA\u2019s Detroit Pistons. As a strong supporter of diversity and inclusion, Engelbert is the first woman to serve as chair of the Catalyst Board, a global non-profit organization that promotes inclusive workplaces for women, and also was the first woman chair of the Center for Audit Quality Governing Board. Engelbert has been listed as one of Fortune\u2019s Most Powerful Women for the last four years. She is ranked on Glassdoor\u2019s annual Employees\u2019 Choice Awards honoring the 100 Highest-Rated CEOs, and among Crain\u2019s 50 Most Powerful Women in New York.

He\u2019s also among the biggest underdogs. The 7-foot-6 center from UCF already has the first win of his pro career. He\u2019s among 11 players who were picked from the G League Elite Camp held earlier this week for a spot in the combine that officially starts Thursday. That bumps the list of combine invites to 77 \u2013 not all will be there, with presumed No. 1 pick Zion Williamson already having left Chicago after attending Tuesday\u2019s draft lottery and meeting with teams. Fall, predictably, was thrilled to get the call. \u201cIt means a lot,\u201d Fall said. Sure does \u2013 it means any realistic hopes he has of being drafted are still alive. Fall knows the math: 77 players invited to the combine, another 29 draft-eligibles having been to the G League event, plus international players eligible to be selected for only 60 draft spots. As such, plenty of guys will see their hopes of playing in the NBA next season dashed in the next few weeks. How he fares at the combine may go a long way toward deciding if he\u2019s one of them. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to earn your spot,\u201d Fall said. \u201cAll the guys that were in the combine, they\u2019re all great players. I saw the list. There\u2019s not one player where I\u2019d be like, `Oh, this guy does not deserve to be there.\u2019 So if you want to be there, you\u2019ve got to compete.\u201d Fall, Florida State\u2019s Terance Mann, Miami\u2019s Dewan Hernandez, Syracuse\u2019s Oshae Brissett, Nevada\u2019s Cody Martin, Tulsa\u2019s DaQuan Jeffries, Auburn\u2019s Jared Harper, Iowa\u2019s Tyler Cook, Iowa State\u2019s Marial Shayok, Mississippi State\u2019s Reggie Perry and Ole Miss\u2019 Terence Davis were invited Wednesday to stay. They were chosen through a polling of NBA executives. \u201cIt really humbles you, knowing that all the work you\u2019ve put in is finally paying off,\u201d Brissett said. Plenty of the players who will be partaking in the on-court events at the combine will end up in the G League next season. None of them will be getting the league\u2019s new $125,000 contract deal \u2013 that\u2019s solely for players who aren\u2019t going to college but aren\u2019t yet draft-eligible because of the one-and-done rule. Many will make more, many will make less. And some really accomplished college players didn\u2019t even make what amounts to the first cut to get to the combine: Syracuse\u2019s Tyus Battle, North Carolina\u2019s Luke Maye (who was slowed by an ankle issue) and Campbell\u2019s Chris Clemons \u2013 the 5-foot-9 guard who averaged 30 points as a college senior and finished his four years with 3,225 points \u2013 won\u2019t be sticking around after participating in the G League event. \u201cI\u2019d have been very happy to move up there,\u201d Clemons said after the G League camp. \u201cBut I made great use of my time here. This is a great event. I got to showcase my game to every team here.\u201d Hernandez knows he\u2019s one of the lucky ones. He\u2019s finally getting to play with somebody watching again. The 6-foot-11 forward wasn\u2019t allowed by the NCAA to play this past season, and would have had to sit out 40 percent of next season, because of his dealings with an agent. Miami officials insisted the penalty was wildly unfair and Hernandez felt the same way. But he worked to make sure his game was on point for the G League event, hoping to impress enough teams that he would merit the bump to the combine. \u201cIt\u2019s go time,\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cIt\u2019s time to compete. I haven\u2019t played in a year. NBA scouts want to see how I\u2019ve developed my game, what I\u2019ve worked on in my off time. I\u2019ve gotten stronger. I\u2019ve worked on my jump shot, my ballhandling, my finishing, my defense, my terminology on defense. It\u2019s time to take advantage of this opportunity.\u201d That\u2019s what, for many, this combine brings \u2013 an opportunity. Fall is a known entity already because of his massive frame, and for what he did against Williamson in his final game at UCF \u2013 the one-point loss the Knights were handed by the Blue Devils in the second round of the NCAA Tournament. He largely held his own against the player that will more than likely get taken No. 1 overall. That doesn\u2019t guarantee anything. But he believes the chance \u2013 and his future \u2013 is in his massive hands. \u201cComing into that game, I knew what I could do,\u201d Fall said. \u201cI knew how I could impact the game no matter who I played against. And as long as I stay true to that, I\u2019m going to be fine.\u201d"},{"id":33706,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/ben-simmons-play-australia-fiba-world-cup","date":"2019-05-15","title":"Simmons plans to play for Australia at FIBA World Cup","content":" SYDNEY (AP) \u2014 Ben Simmons is set to play for Australia at the FIBA World Cup after confirming in an online video \u201cI\u2019m going to be a Boomer\u201d for upcoming events.

The Pelicans won the lottery for the second time in their history, and the first since 2012 , when they selected Davis out of Kentucky. If Davis is indeed traded, the Pelicans will at least console themselves not only with whatever assets they\u2019ll receive in return, but most especially presumptive top prospect Zion Williams. The electrifying college basketball star amazed with his rim-rattling athleticism during his lone season at Duke. Following the Draft Lottery, Pelicans vice president of basketball operations David Griffin was asked if he was looking forward to talking to Davis and his agent, Rich Paul , in the wake of the Lottery success. \u201cNo more so than before. We have reason to believe that\u2019s something that is attractive,\u201d said Griffin, who was hired by the Pelicans in mid-April . \u201cAnd if I\u2019m Anthony Davis, I\u2019m skeptical obviously. He\u2019s wanted to win this whole time and he felt compelled to try to win elsewhere. I think if you look at the totality of where this organization is and where we\u2019re going, we feel very strongly that we\u2019re going be the environment he wants to be part of. And if we\u2019re not, that\u2019s fine; we can deal with it from there. But I\u2019m looking at this believing that there\u2019s no reason he wouldn\u2019t want to win with us, because that\u2019s what we do. It\u2019s who we are. And I think culturally we\u2019re about all the same things. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019ll play into it hugely. If he was open-minded to believing that we could build a winner around him, he\u2019s more open-minded to it. \u2026 We\u2019re going to build something that we hope everyone wants to be part of and I believed very strongly Anthony\u2019s going to want to be part of that whether we win this or not. I think when you have elite talent, that tends to attract other truly elite talent.\u201d Additionally, Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry remains confident that the Pelicans\u2019 potentially drafting Williamson could sway Davis to stay put. \u201cGuys, the one thing you got to understand is [Davis] is still on our roster,\u201d Gentry said Tuesday, per ESPN.com . \u201cHe is on our roster. All of that will take care of itself. I\u2019m not worried about it. I know Griff has some plans to talk to him, and it will be fine.\u201d Davis, 26, initially asked to be traded in late January , midway through his seventh season with the Pelicans. He holds a player option that will allow him to reach unrestricted free agency in the summer of 2020. At his introductory news conference last month , Griffin was hoping that the long relationship he shares with Paul might help him sway Davis to rescind his trade request. Griffin was Cleveland\u2019s general manager when LeBron James \u2014 who also is represented by Paul \u2014 was with the Cavaliers and led them to the franchise\u2019s only NBA title. Pelicans owner Gayle Benson said in April that she liked Griffin\u2019s outlook on Davis. \u201cWe certainly don\u2019t want somebody here whose heart isn\u2019t in it, but hopefully Anthony will have a change of heart and if he does, we\u2019ll welcome him back with open arms,\u201d Benson said. \u201cWe\u2019d like for him to stay if everybody agrees to it.\u201d The six-time All-Star is averaging 23.7 points, 10.5 rebounds and 2.4 blocks in 466 career games. The Pelicans have reached the playoffs just twice during his tenure, with one series victory.

Damian Lillard paused and signed a few autographs before entering Oracle Arena, because he is a man of the people, and these are his people. None of them mention that, in their hearts, they\u2019re rooting for him to lose this playoff series, and so it goes unspoken, a truce in a sense. For this fleeting moment, they\u2019re Lillard fans, until the ball goes up. And then it\u2019s all for Stephen Curry, all night long. There is a competition within the competition between the Golden State Warriors and Portland Trail Blazers, and it is the battle for the affection of Oakland. There is Lillard, the pride of the Brookfield Village neighborhood, who has blossomed into a bonafide star with the Blazers. And then there\u2019s Curry, the symbol of a basketball renaissance here, who has raised the profile of Oakland the last several years. Now you see why \u201cThe Town\u201d is a bit conflicted. A bit. The conference championship may well hinge on the performance of these All-NBA guards. Game 1 was fairly lopsided, both in terms of the teams \u2014 Warriors 116, Blazers 94 \u2014 and the two principles. Lillard struggled Tuesday and appeared whipped, physically if not mentally, no doubt from a grueling seven-game semifinals that just wrapped up 48 hours earlier. He missed 8 of his 12 shots, had seven turnovers and, in a rarity for him, he was a non-factor for Portland. He\u2019s a combined 7-for-29 in his last two playoff games. Meanwhile, Curry rolled, dropping 36 points and the Blazers along with them. And so, this is the verdict: Portland cannot hope to stretch this series beyond four games, five tops, without the max from Lillard. He obviously means that much. Curry, now working without the comforts of his injured co-star Kevin Durant for the second straight game (and maybe without Durant for another two games), needs to keep his skills elevated to prevent suspense from encroaching on the series. The Warriors are well aware of what Lillard has done to them in the past; he has averaged more points against the hometown team (27 points per game) than any in his career likely because of provincial pride. Yet Golden State is also aware that he has yet to beat them in any game or series of significance. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the best guards in this league and carries a chip on his shoulder and it has (worked) well for him in his career,\u201d said Warriors forward Draymond Green. \u201cA special talent. I know he\u2019s excited to be back home playing in the last year at Oracle. So it\u2019s special for him but it don\u2019t mean nothing to us. We\u2019ve got to come out here and try to stop him. A tall task.\u201d While the East Bay has given birth to its share of NBA stars \u2014 Hall of Famers Bill Russell, Jason Kidd and Gary Payton chief among them \u2014 Lillard is still freshly active and refreshingly loyal. The connection between him and Oakland remains unwavering despite fame and distance and the fact it\u2019s his job and desire to shock the world in the next few weeks. He played at St. Joseph Notre Dame in Alameda and then finished at Oakland High School. A thick section of fans at Oracle Wednesday were wrapped in Blazers gear and made their preference clear, most of whom were either from the old neighborhood or family members. His high school coach, Damon Jones, is a Warriors season ticket holder, and Jones said: \u201cNobody bought me a drink tonight.\u201d The coach added, playfully: \u201cThey gave me a hard time. When the Warriors scored, they wanted to turn around and slap five but then caught themselves at the last minute.\u201d Jones remembers Lillard as being a promising and quick guard who picked up the nuances of the game rapidly. \u201cHe was very personable for someone his age, a solid teammate,\u201d Jones said. \u201cHe still keeps in touch with all of his former teammates. It\u2019s a brotherhood and he\u2019s the leader. He\u2019s always trying to be a positive influence on everyone around here.\u201d Lillard returns every summer to give away backpacks with school supplies and funded the renovation of the Oakland High gym. He\u2019s a familiar sight around town in the offseason and always approachable, and that loyalty and devotion doesn\u2019t go unnoticed. \u201cPeople here respect him,\u201d said Raymond Young, Lillard\u2019s AAU coach. \u201cWhen he comes here to play, people here say they\u2019re going to clap for Damian but cheer for the Warriors. Only he can get that kind of reaction. His loyalty comes from his family. His mother and father were no-problem parents. They let us coach him. He was a joy to be around. Still is.\u201d Lillard is even more endearing because he comes from humble beginnings and is self-made. Both of his youth coaches are admittedly shocked by his impact in the NBA. He wound up at Weber State. He wasn\u2019t highly recruited by the big schools as even nearby Cal-Berkeley came late. \u201cBut if he goes there,\u201d Young said, \u201cdoes all this happen?\u201d Lillard is revered in Portland, who is loyal to the Blazers in an age of transient stars and has never wanted to play anywhere else. Perhaps this has cost him some visibility, with a majority of his games tipping off at 10:30 p.m. Eastern time. It\u2019s a price he\u2019s more than willing to pay. This is Lillard\u2019s first foray into the conference finals, which represents some new and deserved shine for him. A layer of that invisibility was peeled off in these playoffs where Lillard has come up massive. His shot from nearly 40 feet that eliminated the Oklahoma City Thunder in the first round, and his follow-up \u201cbye-bye\u201d wave made the moment iconic. Then he followed up with a strong Western Conference semifinal against the Denver Nuggets. Although as that series crept to the conclusion, Lillard shot just 3-for-17 in that Game 7 \u2026 and followed that up with a 4-for-12 Tuesday, proof that he might be gassed \u2014 and also that the Warriors cooked up a defensive game plan specifically for him. \u201cObviously it\u2019s a little bit difficult physically and emotionally just because you\u2019re excited about being in the Western Conference finals,\u201d Lillard said. \u201cYou come straight here from Denver and get ready for the best team in the league. But once we lace our shoes and put our uniforms on, it\u2019s fair and square. You got to go out there and handle your business. \u201cThey did a good job defensively and even when I was trying to find (teammates), they were getting deflections. They were making me play in a crowd. I thought they were successful at that \u2026 in this first game.\u201d But his toughest task of all might be upstaging Curry, particularly here in Oakland. While Lillard has flourished through much of the postseason, Curry by comparison has been mild, especially by his standards. The missed layups, a famously flubbed dunk attempt and sporadic 3-point shooting was unsightly. After Durant limped off the floor in Game 5 of the West semis , Curry felt a sense of urgency and a flush of greatness. He buried the Rockets with a pair of epic fourth quarters, then kept the faucet running Tuesday. The Blazers couldn\u2019t limit or at least slow him anywhere on the floor, especially from the 3-point line, where Curry was a sizzling 9-for-15. In his last six quarters, Curry has scored 69 points with 13-for-24 shooting on 3-pointers. \u201cI know what I\u2019m capable of doing on the floor,\u201d Curry said, \u201cand the situation calls for me to be more aggressive and hopefully that will continue. It\u2019s nice to see the ball go in. I want to maintain that. I didn\u2019t shoot well for 4 1\/2 games the last series. Every game is different. You have to reestablish yourself and that\u2019s my perspective no matter how I play.\u201d Curry didn\u2019t arrive wearing the baseball jersey of the home team, and if anything has been spotted at San Franciso Giants games across the Bay, where the Warriors will call home starting next season. But don\u2019t get anything twisted. Curry\u2019s bond with Oakland, developed over time, is genuine and real for someone born and bred a country away in Charlotte, and the feeling is mutual. The tug of war for the heartstrings of Oakland is subtle between the pair of franchise players on the floor in this playoff series. Call it a draw from the standpoint of whom the fans here respect and appreciate. There\u2019s enough love to be shared by both. Yet in the basketball sense, this series is on the verge of being owned by the one wearing the jersey that reps Oakland. Curry has more momentum and better teammates, and Durant is on deck. Oakland, therefore, will indeed cheer for one of its own, for Lillard. But the way this series and these playoffs are going, \u201cThe Town\u201d is anxious to pop bottles with Curry once again \u2014 at the usual place and time \u2014 one last time. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

The Pelicans entered tied with the only the seventh-best odds at six percent, but vaulted past multiple teams to win the top pick for the second time in their history. The first time came in 2012 , earning the right to draft then-Kentucky superstar Anthony Davis. And while Davis reportedly remains steadfast in wanting to leave , the obvious enthusiasm from the Pelicans and their employees shows that Duke\u2019s Zion Williamson, widely expected to go No. 1, could take much of the sting off such a departure. Another team to move up in the lottery was the Los Angeles Lakers, which star forward LeBron James was certainly pleased about."},{"id":33725,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/pelicans-win-nba-draft-lottery","date":"2019-05-15","title":"Pelicans win NBA Draft Lottery","content":" * NBA Draft Lottery:  Complete order 1-60 CHICAGO (AP) \u2014 New Orleans has bucked the odds and won the NBA draft lottery, and now will have the first chance at choosing Zion Williamson next month. The Pelicans won the lottery for the first time since 2012, when they selected Anthony Davis. And the lottery win comes after a season when Davis wanted a trade \u2014 something that might not seem so appealing to him now, not with Williamson likely coming to New Orleans. Memphis will choose second, New York third and the Los Angeles Lakers will pick fourth. Williamson says he has never been to New Orleans. That might soon change. \u201cIt\u2019s just another positive event for us,\u201d new Pelicans general manager David Griffin said. The Pelicans were the biggest winners \u2014 and the Grizzlies and the Lakers had reason to celebrate as well. They all moved up, much to the chagrin of teams like New York, Cleveland and Phoenix. The Suns, Cavs and Knicks all had the best chance of winning the lottery, and neither even got as much as a No. 2 pick. Williamson will have an excellent chance at seeing his name added to the list of other No. 1 picks who entered the league with much fanfare in the lottery era, players like LeBron James, Tim Duncan, Shaquille O\u2019Neal, David Robinson and Allen Iverson. Cleveland will pick fifth, Phoenix sixth, Chicago seventh, Atlanta eighth, Washington ninth, Atlanta again at 10th, Minnesota 11th, Charlotte 12th, Miami 13th and Boston 14th. That pick was conveyed to the Celtics by Sacramento as part of an earlier trade. UCF center Tacko Fall, the 7-foot-6 draft hopeful, played against Williamson in the second round of the NCAA tournament \u2014 a 77-76 Duke victory that went down to the very last moment, a game where Williamson scored 32 points. Fall was asked Tuesday who he would take with the No. 1 pick in this draft, and he did not hesitate for even a second before answering. \u201cZion,\u201d Fall said. \u201cHe\u2019s a once-in-a-generation player. I\u2019d seen him on TV a lot, but when you play against this kid, you just see it. He\u2019s different.\u201d Williamson was watching the lottery result unveiling from a stageside seat, along with Murray State\u2019s Ja Morant, Texas Tech\u2019s Jarrett Culver, Indiana\u2019s Romeo Langford and more. Williamson was one of three now-former Duke starters at the lottery \u2014 R.J. Barrett and Cam Reddish were among the invited players as well. \u201cFor three of us to be here, it\u2019s crazy,\u201d Williamson told NBA TV before the event started. \u201cI don\u2019t think you usually see anything like that.\u201d"},{"id":33723,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/terry-rozier-wants-changes-boston-summer","date":"2019-05-14","title":"Rozier doesn't want to return if Celtics remain same","content":"Guard Terry Rozier did not mince words about his future as he spoke on two ESPN morning shows Tuesday. The Celtics\u2019 fourth-year player, who will be a restricted free agent this summer, chimed in on what went wrong for the team and how he\u2019s viewing his future as a free agent. As a guest on ESPN\u2019s \u201cGet Up,\u201d Rozier told host Mike Greenberg: \u201cI\u2019m looking to just play ball. I don\u2019t care where I go. Obviously the Celtics is the only organization I knew for four years and I love it there. We\u2019ll just have to go from there.\u201d When asked what he expects this summer, Rozier added, \u201cI expect me to get my chance, whether it\u2019s with the Celtics or it\u2019s anywhere else. I feel like I can be myself and play my game wherever I go.\u201d He later appeared on ESPN\u2019s \u201cFirst Take,\u201d and reiterated his stance on his future in Boston. When asked by show host Stephen A. Smith if he\u2019d want to stay in Boston if the rest of the roster were kept in tact, Rozier said, \u201cNo, I might have to go. I might have to go. You know, I put up with a lot this year, so, you know, I said what I said after the season, and I think we all know that I\u2019m not trying to step into that again.\u201d Rozier was a playoff hero for the Celtics in their run to the 2018 Eastern Conference finals, filling in admirably for Boston once All-Star point guard Kyrie Irving was lost for that playoff run because of knee surgery . Rozier started all 19 of Boston\u2019s 2018 playoff games, averaging 16.5 points, 5.3 rebounds and 5.7 assists as the Celtics came within a win of reaching The Finals . This season, though, it was a different story for Rozier as Irving was healthy and he served as his top backup. After averaging career bests in most categories last season, Rozier saw his individual statistics drop. In talking on \u201cGet Up,\u201d Rozier said the Celtics\u2019 players took to coaching from Brad Stevens and his staff, but failed to execute those messages throughout the season come game time. \u201cI think we all just felt good about it, like, having practice, in our discussions, you know, film talk. But then every time we get in the game, it\u2019s just like\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t say we wouldn\u2019t follow the game plan, but it\u2019ll be different,\u201d Rozier said. In addition, Rozier cited taking on more of a backup role this season was a big adjustment and called losing minutes to Irving \u201cvery difficult.\u201d \u201cI think anybody that was in my shoes than can go and start and, you know, go to a Game 7 in the Eastern Conference finals and then come back and we have the season that we have this year, I feel like anybody in my position would say it\u2019s tough,\u201d Rozier said. Overall, Rozier said a season of promise and laced with Finals hopes unraveled quickly for Boston. \u201cI feel like from the beginning, obviously we had big goals and a lot of people had big goals for us,\u201d Rozier said on \u201cFirst Take.\u201d \u201cAnd the first five games of the season, you just seen things go downhill from the beginning. I feel like we wasn\u2019t playing how we wanted to. The game plan wasn\u2019t \u2026 we didn\u2019t go out there and execute the game plan how we wanted to. So I feel like we had to make adjustments, we had to change the lineup and then we just couldn\u2019t get things right ever since then.\u201d Rozier also said after the Celtics\u2019 series loss to the Milwaukee Bucks in the Eastern Conference semifinals that he sacrificed more than anyone else on the team. \u201cI sacrificed obviously my talent I think the most. Me being out there and giving my full style of play, how I play, how Terry Rozier play, I feel like I couldn\u2019t be that person this year.\u201d Asked why he couldn\u2019t, he said, \u201cYou know, it\u2019s just obviously in the shadow of some guys. I feel like the ball was in Kyrie or Gordon (Hayward)\u2019s hands most of the time, so I feel like either Terry Rozier was just in the corner or, you know, just on the bench.\u201d Later, Rozier said: \u201cThings was all good before we actually started. I still had the positive mindset that we was going to make it work, but ever since that day that Kyrie announced in front of the fans that, if we would like to have him back, he would come back, things I feel like shifted left for me. I just seen the way people treated me with their attitudes, and I feel like I was just thrown all the way in the back seat. And I just had to adjust to that. I talked to Brad multiple times. I talked to guys multiple times. But I just feel like it was just nothing that nobody could do.\u201d Boston trudges into a pivotal offseason with Irving and Al Horford holding player options to return for next season while Rozier and Marcus Morris will enter free agency. After a season in which lack of chemistry was a recurrent issue, team president Danny Ainge will have some tough choices to make that will affect the franchise\u2019s long-term future. Irving, coming off knee surgery, had disagreements in the locker room, particularly with the younger players. During a losing streak in January Irving called them out, saying \u201cthe young guys don\u2019t know what it takes to be a championship-level team.\u201d Stevens said it was clear that expectations weighed on not only Irving but the entire team. \u201cThere\u2019s no question. They have TVs. They have phones. They hear everything,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of pressure to live up to all these expectations, to put on a cape. to do all those things. And that\u2019s hard to do.\u201d Irving, who told a group of season-ticket holders in October that he intended to resign, backtracked on that pledge in February when he proclaimed \u201cAsk me on July 1\u201d after being pressed on his intentions for this summer. It was a far cry from the optimism Kyrie brimmed with at his introductory news conference two years ago. Irving said after the Celtics\u2019 Game 5 series loss to Milwaukee that how this season ended would stay with him. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget something like this,\u201d he said last Wednesday. \u201cThe taste of feeling defeat and this type of style, I haven\u2019t felt. For me, it\u2019s just moving on to the next thing and seeing where it ends up.\u201d Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":33732,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-brett-brown-stay-sixers","date":"2019-05-14","title":"Brown to remain 76ers coach, looks forward to future","content":" PHILADELPHIA \u2014 Josh Harris is a billionaire and he if wants to shuttle between New York and the Philadelphia 76ers headquarters in New Jersey on a helicopter, the team owner can do it with ease. If Harris wants to pay $45 million for his luxury home, he can spend pocket change on a new pad, too. And he if really wanted to silence speculation that Brett Brown was coaching for his Sixers career during the playoffs, well, all Harris had to say was that he had his guy.  Harris instead settled for a milquetoast endorsement before the Brooklyn series, saying Brown was a \u201cgreat coach\u201d but offering no assurance he would return for another season if the Sixers failed to make a deep run in the playoffs.  \u201cWe think he\u2019s the right leader to take us where we need to go in the playoffs,\u201d Harris said. \u201cI\u2019m focused on the Brooklyn Nets.\u201d  Harris let Brown twist through the Brooklyn and Toronto series, the sixth-year coach\u2019s fate seemingly hinging on the outcome of four bounces of Kawhi Leonard\u2019s jumper that finally plopped through the net at the Game 7 horn, ushering the Sixers into the offseason.  So, would Brown return? It turned out Brown\u2019s hot seat was actually as cool as the hockey ice under the hardwood at Wells Fargo Center. \u201cBrett\u2019s job was never in jeopardy,\u201d Harris said Tuesday in Camden, New Jersey. Oh. The sourced reports, tweets , whispers, and bold headlines that Brown would not survive turned out to have all the accuracy of a Ben Simmons jumper. And if Harris is to be taken at his word, Brown\u2019s fate was never in doubt. \u201cBrett knew through the Toronto series that his job was not in jeopardy,\u201d Harris said. Brown, 178-314 (.362) in six seasons, said he knew from multiple conversations with Harris that his job was safe no matter if the season ended in the second round or a championship parade. Harris and Brown both said it wouldn\u2019t have been fair to respond to each report about the future when the focus was firmly on the postseason. But had Harris simply said what he said Tuesday a month ago, the reports would have all but vanished. Of course, maybe the Sixers didn\u2019t feel it was necessary before the Brooklyn series to squelch unfounded rumors. \u201cOnce the playoffs ended, it made sense to put it all to rest and move on,\u201d Harris said. Brown held exit interviews with the entire roster Monday before he headed to New York for dinner with the ownership group and general manager Elton Brand. The Sixers players then mostly had to defend Brown at the season-ending session with reporters, with All-Star center Joel Embiid using an expletive to answer a question on whether his coach was on the way out. Again, questions that wouldn\u2019t have been wasted had a decision on Brown been announced. The Sixers used a late-night news dump to say Brown \u2013 who led the Sixers from the painful undertaking of the Process to consecutive 50-win seasons \u2013 would be retained for another season. Brown had agreed last year to a three-year contract extension through the 2021-22 season. \u201cWe have everything that we need to move this program forward,\u201d Brown said. The Sixers are willing to give Brown everything he needs to keep the Sixers in the hunt for their first NBA championship since 1983 . The Sixers surrendered key assets in two trades this season for Jimmy Butler and Tobias Harris that signaled they were all-in for a championship. Butler and Harris are free agents who can command max contracts on the open market \u2013 money the Sixers have and are willing to spend. \u201cWe\u2019re committed to do what it takes to bring a championship to Philly, including spending into the luxury tax,\u201d Harris said. Embiid, Simmons, Butler and Harris are an All-Star caliber lineup that should easily keep the Sixers at the 50-win threshold. But Simmons and Embiid both have major holes in their game that could keep the Sixers from becoming a true championship contender. Embiid can\u2019t stay healthy \u2013 and the Sixers failed to field a reliable backup when he\u2019s out of the lineup \u2013 and Simmons can\u2019t make a basic 15-footer (much less a 3-pointer). Brand starts his first summer as GM after he was thrust into the position in the wake of the Bryan Colangelo Twitter fiasco. \u201cI look forward to being the GM for the first time in free agency to address certain needs like a backup center or depth or certain pieces that need to be in place,\u201d Brand said. \u201cLast year, I wasn\u2019t afforded that opportunity. I had a voice in it, and I didn\u2019t speak up loud enough I guess.\u201d"},{"id":33761,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/numbers-preview-warriors-blazers","date":"2019-05-14","title":"Numbers preview: Golden State Warriors (1) vs. Portland Trail Blazers (3)","content":" The Golden State Warriors have seemingly advanced past their toughest hurdle on their way to a fifth straight trip to The Finals.

The Portland Trail Blazers advanced through the \u201copen\u201d side of the Western Conference bracket to earn their first trip to the conference finals in 19 years.

New Timberwolves president Gersson Rosas plans to interview Miami Heat assistant coach Juwan Howard and Portland Trail Blazers assistant coach David Vanterpool for the opening, per ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski . Additionally, The New York Times \u2018 Marc Stein and The Times-Picayune \u2018s Andrew Lopez report New Orleans Pelicans assistant Chris Finch will also be interviewing for the job.

Although those new names are in the mix for the Timberwolves\u2019 job, Wojnarowski reports that last season\u2019s interim coach, Ryan Saunders, is also in the mix for the job. Saunders finished the season as Wolves coach after the team fired Tom Thibodeau following a 19-21 start, and Saunders had the support of both All-Star center Karl-Anthony Towns. Rosas was hired to fill the team president role, one which Thibodeau held and was vacant after he was fired.  Saunders made a strong impression on Rosas and team management and has met with Rosas several times since his hiring, Wojnarowski reports.

The former University of Michigan coach was officially announced as the Cavs\u2019 new coach today, and ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski reports Beilein agreed to a five-year deal with the team. Talks with Beilein and the Cavs escalated over the weekend, Wojnarowski reports, and a deal was reached on Sunday. The Athletic\u2019s Joe Vardon reports the Cavs\u2019 interviewing of Beilein was one of the few candidates not disclosed to the media. Per Vardon, Cavs GM Koby Altman had interviewed nearly 10 NBA assistants for the Cavs\u2019 vacancy. \u201cFollowing the end of those interviews, it became clear to us that Coach Beilein was the right choice and best fit for our franchise,\u201d Altman said in a statement released by the team. \u201cJohn is one of the most accomplished and innovative basketball minds and leaders in the entire game. He has a unique ability to create an outstanding culture that will promote the development of young players and provide a solid structure to the entire program; not to mention the fact that John Beilein wins everywhere he goes. \u201cWe are excited Coach Beilein is joining our organization as we continue to build the foundation that any enterprise needs to be successful and competitive year in and year out.\u201d Shortly after the reported deal became known, the Twitter account for Michigan basketball seemed to bid farewell to Beilein with a tweet highlighting his many accomplishments at the school . Beilein acknowledged the university in a tweet from his account Monday that read: \u201cThanks to everyone at the Univ of Michigan for their incredible support these last 12 years. Our fans, alums, leaders, players and students are AMAZING It has been a heck of a ride and I hope you enjoyed our teams and staff as much as I did! Go Blue Forever! #GoBlue\u201d Cavs owner Dan Gilbert was fond of Beilein\u2019s character and work ethic, two points he touched on in his statement about the hiring. \u201cFirst, John is a great human being. He cares deeply about his players and others who work for him and around him,\u201d Gilbert said. \u201cHe defines the words class, integrity and character. He is a tireless worker who obsesses about finding better ways and the inches that will help his team and the organization grow. John is a brilliant basketball mind and last but not least, John Beilein is a winner.\u201d The 65-year-old Beilein has been at Michigan for 12 seasons, guiding the Wolverines to the NCAA Tournament nine times in that span. He is 799-461 in 39 seasons as a college coach and 278-150 at Michigan. He led the Wolverines to the NCAA championship game in 2018, the second time in six years he\u2019d accomplished that. Michigan lost to Louisville in 2013 and Villanova in 2018. In addition to his two Final Four appearances, Beilein has won Big Ten titles at Michigan in 2012 and 2014, and he won the Big Ten Tournament in 2017 and 2018. He replaces Larry Drew, who steered the team through countless injuries and other challenges as the Cavs finished 19-63. The 2018-19 season marked their first season since LeBron James left for a second time and it ended on a 10-game losing streak. Last year, Beilein was among those who interviewed for the Detroit Pistons\u2019 coaching vacancy . Per Wojnarowski, the Cavs have been internally using the term \u201cculture driver\u201d when speaking of the possibility of hiring Beilein. He quickly climbed the ranks of basketball, winning consistently in Division I stops at Canisius, Richmond and West Virginia. His college coaching career began in 1978 at Erie Community College, going from there to Nazareth and then Le Moyne. Beilein is expected to join the front office and ownership in Chicago for tomorrow night\u2019s NBA Draft lottery as well as the Draft combine there this week, Wojnarowski reports. Additionally, the Cavs are expected to round out Belein\u2019s staff with experienced NBA assistants, ESPN reports. Altman had been intrigued by Beilein and Cavs assistant GM Mike Gansey played under Beilein at West Virginia. Per Wojnarowski, Beilein has been reassured by owner Dan Gilbert that his value system will be installed with the Cavs. Drew oversaw the development of point guard Collin Sexton, who didn\u2019t miss a game and joined Larry Bird and Stephen Curry as the only rookies in NBA history to average at least 16 points while shooting better than 40% on 3-pointers and 80% from the foul line. Star forward Kevin Love underwent foot surgery in November, effectively ending any thought the Cavaliers entertained of competing for a playoff spot. Cleveland finished tied with Phoenix for the league\u2019s second-worst record behind New York. Those three teams will have a 14 percent chance of picking first, but depending on how things play out, there\u2019s the possibility of falling as far as sixth and missing out on Duke star Zion Williamson, his Blue Devils teammate RJ Barrett or Ja Morant, Murray State\u2019s electrifying guard who already has the Cavaliers\u2019 attention. \u201cEverybody will be anxious,\u201d Love said in April. \u201cObviously we hope we get the best player.\u201d Hope seemed lost for the Cavaliers when James bolted last summer, devastating a team \u2014 and city \u2014 he treated to a title and four straight Finals appearances. But despite starting over, and despite untold injuries, Cleveland emerged from a rough season excited about the future. \u201cWould have been easy to kind of fold and whatever, just get steamrolled the last however many games and nobody learned anything, chucked shots and played pick-up basketball, but I don\u2019t think we did that,\u201d Cavs forward Larry Nance Jr. said. \u201cWe improved in a lot of different areas and a lot of individual areas.\u201d Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":33763,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/lakers-hire-coach-frank-vogel-release","date":"2019-05-14","title":"Lakers sign Frank Vogel to multiyear head coaching contract","content":" EL SEGUNDO, Calif. \u2014 The Los Angeles Lakers have signed Frank Vogel to a multiyear contract as head coach, it was announced Monday by General Manager Rob Pelinka.

Originally from Wildwood Crest, New Jersey, Vogel previously served as an assistant coach for the Pacers, Philadelphia 76ers and Boston Celtics for eight seasons between 2001-2011.

Per ESPN\u2019s Ramona Shelburne , Durant will not play in Game 1 of the West finals against the Portland Trail Blazers on Tuesday night ( 9 ET, ESPN ). It\u2019s unlikely Durant will suit up for Game 2 because he isn\u2019t scheduled to be re-evaluated until the morning of the game on Thursday. Golden State initially feared the two-time reigning NBA Finals MVP might have injured his Achilles, a far more serious issue. However, despite the less severe diagnosis, coach Steve Kerr said on Monday people should \u201cslow down\u201d when estimating Durant\u2019s return. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t even stepped on the floor yet,\u201d Kerr said on Monday. \u201cWe\u2019ve tried to remain somewhat vague because the injury is really sort of open-ended in terms of how long he\u2019s going to need to recover. But I think in doing so, people have gotten the idea that he\u2019s going to come back \u2026 be Willis Reed or something. \u201cHe still has pain. So there\u2019s time ahead of him on the rehab process,\u201d Kerr continued. \u201cWe\u2019ll have a more detailed update on Thursday.\u201d An MRI exam last Thursday confirmed the Warriors\u2019 initial diagnosis of a strained right calf. The Warriors closed out the series on Friday night, defeating the Rockets 118-113 in Game 6 behind a 33-point night from star guard Stephen Curry. Durant did not travel with the team for that game, remaining in the Bay Area to get treatment for his injury. Golden State did get some good news on the injury front over the weekend, though. DeMarcus Cousins, who has been sidelined since April 15 with a torn quariceps muscle, is on course to return to the Warriors during the Western Conference finals, according to Marc Stein of The New York Times . Like Durant, Kerr says Cousins still has a long way to go until he\u2019s back on the court. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t had any live stuff on the court yet,\u201d Kerr said on Monday. \u201cHe\u2019s not that close either. Hopefully, another week goes by and things start to get better. But at this point, we\u2019re getting ready for this series without both of them. \u201cWe sort of evaluate week to week,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cBut if a guy hasn\u2019t seen any live action the day before the first game of a series, it\u2019s tough to see that turning around quickly. For both guys, it\u2019s not like anything is imminent.\u201d Cousins has been out since Game 2 of Golden State\u2019s first-round series with the Clippers. In 30 games this season, Cousins averaged 16.3 points, 8.2 rebounds, 3.6 assists and 1.5 blocks in 25.7 minutes.

This was an unusual statement to make, as Beard, one of the rising stars in college coaching, points out. \u201cThe recruiting story is usually about the coach, and what he said he would do, and if he kept the promises he made to the player,\u201d says Beard, who took a depleted roster from a 2018 NCAA tournament Elite Eight team and, with Culver as its fulcrum and a couple of key graduate transfers thrown in, nearly won the 2019 national championship. \u201cBut equally important is the other side of the relationship. \u201cA lot of times, a player will tell you he\u2019s going to do something, and that doesn\u2019t happen. In the recruiting process, everything Jarrett told us he would do in his part of the bargain, he did it 100 percent.\u201d The story has been well told by now, but Beard didn\u2019t have to look far for Culver, who grew up in Lubbock, Texas \u2014 home of Texas Tech. Beard, a Texan through and through, had served 10 years on the staff of Texas Tech, seven under the legend Bobby Knight and three more under Knight\u2019s son, Pat, before embarking on a coaching odyssey that included four head-coaching jobs at four different levels of the game before taking over at Tech in 2016. While Beard was away, he always kept his eye on West Texas, realizing the occasional special player pops up in that football-mad part of the country. When Beard first became aware of Culver, the player was in eighth or ninth grade. The more Beard learned about him, the more he liked. Culver\u2019s parents \u2014 has father is a Baptist minister \u2014 were of high moral fiber and committed to their children. His two older brothers were successful athletes. Best of all, as a youngster, Culver had already worked his way through every sport until he realized basketball was the one that he loved the most, and had the potential to take him the farthest. Little did he know. Beard took nothing for granted when he began recruiting Culver. \u201cI wasn\u2019t a big Tech fan, even though I lived in Lubbock,\u201d Culver says. \u201cI kind of grew up a Texas fan. But once I started getting recruited by coach Beard, I didn\u2019t think about any of that. I just wanted to go where somebody really wanted me. Coach Beard recruited me hard. He always told me if I was in New York or anywhere else, he would have recruited me the same way. I liked that, and I saw myself making an impact.\u201d Beard thought the same thing, that Culver could make an impact. Little did he know. Once Culver, at about 6-foot-6 and 170 pounds, showed up on campus, Beard realized exactly what he had. The word Beard and his coaching staff use to explain devotion to the game is \u201caddicted.\u201d Culver was hooked, and he would do anything within reason to get better. \u201cWhen talent intersects love of the game, special things happen,\u201d Beard says. \u201cAnd when you also have that intersection in the neighborhood of character and discipline \u2026 Jarrett worked on his craft. He came in here as a guy who could score. Two years later, he leaves as one of the best defensive players in college basketball. A guy who could beat you with the pass. He\u2019s a great pick-and-roll player, can score in the post with his back to the basket. He\u2019s improved as a 3-point shooter, a free-throw shooter. He\u2019s worked at his craft.\u201d Culver\u2019s hard work was on display this season. As a freshman, he apprenticed under Tech\u2019s leading scorer Keenan Evans and played on near equal footing with Zhaire Smith, another special talent who left after his only season and became a first-round NBA Draft pick. This season, without Evans and Smith, Culver \u2014 playing at a more robust 200 pounds thanks to hours in the weight room \u2014 was the man. Beard and his assistants plugged some holes with two astute graduate transfer acquisitions \u2014 shot blocking forward Tariq Owens and guard Matt Mooney \u2014 but if Tech, picked to finish seventh in the Big 12, was to surpass those modest preseason expectations, Culver had to deliver. He was more than ready. In leading the Red Raiders to the Big 12 regular-season championship \u2014 breaking Kansas\u2019s 14-year stranglehold on the title \u2014 he delivered team highs in points (701) and rebounds (243) and became the first player in school history to rack up 1,000 or more points (1,119) in his first two seasons. And then came one of the more impressive NCAA tournament runs in history. After getting booted from the Big 12 tournament quarterfinals by West Virginia, the Red Raiders regrouped in the NCAA tournament and plowed through Northern Kentucky, Buffalo, Michigan, Gonzaga and Michigan State en route to a title-game matchup with Virginia. Culver, his well-rounded game on full display, left numerous admirers in his wake. One of them was Michigan State coach Tom Izzo. \u201cI\u2019ve been really impressed with him,\u201d Izzo said during the tournament. \u201cI love guys \u2026 I had a kid named Gary Harris a couple of years ago who I thought was one of the best two-way players I\u2019ve ever had. He could do it on the offensive end. He could do it on the defensive end. He could impact the game in both. I think Culver does that. I think he\u2019s got versatility, and he\u2019s a scorer that plays defense. Sometimes those are harder to come by, and I think that\u2019s what makes him so special.\u201d Tech fell just short of the national championship, losing 85-77 to a Virginia team that seemed destined for redemption after, the season before, having been the first No. 1-seeded team in history to lose to a No. 16 seed. But the loss didn\u2019t diminish the Red Raiders\u2019 accomplishment. \u201cIt was an unbelievable run,\u201d Culver says. \u201cAll of us \u2014 the players coming back, the freshmen, the grad transfers \u2014 bought into what coach was telling us. Everyone believed in coach because of what we did last year. We bought into his culture. And he led us all the way to the championship game because everybody did what they were supposed to do.\u201d After that run, Culver had nothing left to prove in college. He knew it, his family knew it, Beard knew it. As sorry as he is to see Culver go, Beard is equally thrilled for him. Culver did what he was supposed to do, and more important to Beard, what he said he would do. Now it\u2019s on to the next level, where he\u2019s a certain high lottery pick. \u201cI have no doubt he\u2019s going to be an NBA star,\u201d Beard said. \u201cAgain, it\u2019s a case of where talent intersects the love of the game. Nobody\u2019s going to outwork him. I say that with all due respect to all NBA players. I understand how hard guys work. But no one will outwork Jarrett Culver. \u201cLike we say around here, you\u2019ve got to be addicted. A lot of people are addicted to game night, when the band plays and the cheerleaders are rocking. TV cameras and all that. There are only a select few that are just addicted to it, who are in the gym when nobody else is looking. Jarrett\u2019s at the top of the list. He\u2019s addicted to winning. He\u2019s addicted to working. He\u2019s just addicted to the game. * * * Chris Dortch is the editor of the Blue Ribbon College Basketball Yearbook .

Brown\u2019s chances of returning for a seventh season as coach are on the rocks following back-to-back 50-win campaigns. So it goes in Philly, where patience with the Process has worn thin. The Sixers \u2014 who rebuilt their roster with two blockbuster trades \u2013 were knocked out of the Eastern Conference semifinal for the second straight season. Kawhi Leonard sank the first Game 7 buzzer-beater in NBA history and Toronto struck its biggest dagger in the sports heart of Philadelphia since Joe Carter went deep for the Blue Jays in Game 6 of the 1993 World Series. Joel Embiid walked off in tears, his girlfriend cradling the face of the crestfallen 7-footer. Jimmy Butler, Tobias Harris and JJ Redick are headed into free agency, a max contract likely looming for Butler. Brown appears in limbo, and the should-he-stay-should-he-go decision will be the most crucial one yet for first-year general manager Elton Brand. Long championed by ownership and the front office, team owner Josh Harris for the first time put public pressure on Brown to at least reach the East final. And at an impromptu press conference before the start of the playoffs, Harris refused to say if Brown would return and offered only a lukewarm endorsement of his performance. Brown endured the growing pains of the rebuild but his time to finish the Process may have expired. \u201cWhat he\u2019s done for this organization is nothing short of remarkable,\u201d Redick said Monday. \u201cI would just say this in general, for any NBA team, when you think about a coach, and potentially replacing that coach, you have to consider what coaches are available. I don\u2019t feel it necessary to defend Brett to anyone. I think his work speaks for itself.\u201d Like Redick, Brown\u2019s players have never shied away from expressing their admiration and confidence in Brown. Brown never cracked at the pressure or sniped at the media as he became the public face of the franchise through the early years of the Process. He outlasted general managers Sam Hinkie and Bryan Colangelo and turned the team into conference contenders even as expected cornerstones Markelle Fultz, Jahlil Okafor, Nerlens Noel and others flamed out. Only six NBA coaches have longer active tenures with one team than Brown does in Philadelphia. \u201cI don\u2019t think he should have anything to worry about,\u201d Embiid said. \u201cIf there\u2019s someone to blame, put it all on me.\u201d But the Sixers struck it big when Embiid became a franchise player and No. 1 pick Ben Simmons turned into an All-Star. Both have major flaws in health (Embiid) and shooting (Simmons) that will stunt the franchise\u2019s growth until they are resolved. Sure, the Sixers could pluck two-time national champion Jay Wright from Villanova much like the Cavaliers hired John Beilein, but the coach might not matter if Embiid can\u2019t consistently stay on the court. Brown, though, has taken heat for a lot of the team\u2019s failures late in close games. Yes, Leonard\u2019s four-bouncer through the rim was the defining play, but a pair of late shot-clock violations and rushed shots as it ticked down made the Sixers appear disorganized in the final minutes. The Sixers must decide Brown\u2019s fate soon but there are plenty of other questions in a crucial offseason. NEED FOR EMBIID Embiid has all summer to dry his tears and soothe his upset tummy. The Sixers will only go as far as their franchise center takes them, period. They were willing to wait two years for him to sit out with injuries because they knew the tantalizing talent ahead. But he has yet to play more than 64 games a season, one reason why the Sixers played Game 7 on the road instead of home. He missed a playoff game against Brooklyn with a bad left knee and had multiple digestive issues that made his starting status unknown for other games. Embiid needs to become a 70-game player who never sniffs the injury report in the postseason for the Sixers to win it all. \u201cI feel like I let everybody down by not playing or by sitting out,\u201d Embiid said. FREE AGENTS Butler, acquired from Minnesota in November, is sure to ask for the max contract of nearly $190 million over five years. The Sixers would be wise to give it to him. Brown repeated through the playoffs that Butler was \u201cthe adult in gym\u201d and other teams with cash to spend will be hot for the four-time All Star. \u201cI haven\u2019t thought about it too much,\u201d Butler said Monday. \u201cI\u2019ve got to sit down and really talk to my team.\u201d Harris, a trade deadline pickup from the Clippers, can also command a max deal from the Sixers. The Sixers are already on the hook for the $121 million left on Embiid\u2019s deal and Simmons is a year out for earning a max-level extension. The Sixers have to solve some tricky financial questions if they\u2019re willing to pay all their stars, while still leaving room to sign needed reserves as they chase their first NBA championship since 1983. SIZING UP SIMMONS Defenses sagged on Simmons daring him to shoot because the speedy All-Star can\u2019t do much outside the paint. Simmons is 0 for 17 from 3-point range in two seasons and the ability to expand his game is needed as much as a healthy Embiid."},{"id":33759,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/hang-time-podcast-raptors-blazers-conference-finals-preview","date":"2019-05-13","title":"Hang Time Podcast: Wild Game 7s + conference finals preview","content":"John Schuhmann and I break down the thrilling Game 7 wins by the Raptors and Blazers on Sunday.

The 2019 playoffs have produced a pair of series-clinching shots already. First, we had Damian Lillard\u2019s 37-foot shot in Game 5 of the first round that eliminated the Oklahoma City Thunder. Then, in the Eastern Conference semifinals, Kawhi Leonard stepped up in Game 7 with a 15-foot fadeaway jumper that ousted the Philadelphia 76ers. That all said, here\u2019s a look back at some iconic series-clinching game-winners from recent NBA history. * * * The shot:   Ralph Sampson\u2019s turnaround jumper wins Game 5 In the early 1980s, the Houston Rockets paired 7-footer Hakeem Olajuwon with 7-foot-4 Ralph Sampson on the front line. Both were All-Stars, and in 1986 they led Houston to a berth in the NBA Finals. En route to The Finals, the Rockets beat Sacramento and Denver before meeting the defending champion Los Angeles Lakers in the Western Conference finals. Houston came into the series as a distinct underdog to a Laker team led by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Magic Johnson and James Worthy. Yet Los Angeles was able to take only one game from the surprising Rockets. Los Angeles attempted to extend the series with a strong effort in Game 5 on May 21, 1986 . But with the score tied in the closing seconds, Sampson got the ball to the left of the lane and nailed a jumper at the buzzer for a 114-112 victory that eliminated the Lakers 4-1. The shot:  Michael Jordan sinks foul line jumper in Game 5 On May 7, 1989 , Chicago Bulls superstar Michael Jordan delivered one of the most legendary moments of his career when he hit \u201cThe Shot\u201d to eliminate the Cleveland Cavaliers in Game 5 of the 1989 first-round NBA playoffs series. With the series tied 2-2, the Bulls needed to win Game 5 to advance in the best-of-five series. The pivotal game was tight throughout, with six lead changes in the final minutes of regulation. Cavaliers guard Craig Ehlo gave his squad the lead 100-99 with 3.0 seconds left. That was just enough time for Jordan, though, who created space over Ehlo to hit the iconic foul-line jumper at the buzzer. Jordan finished the game with 44 points on 17-for-32 shooting. The shot:  Michael Jordan hits foul-line jumper in Game 4 The Cleveland Cavaliers were still a legit contender in the 1992-93 season, boasting a core of players consisting of Brad Daugherty, Mark Price and a host of others. But, in the \u201992-93 season, the Chicago Bulls were a team seeking to become the NBA\u2019s first three-peat squad since the Boston Celtics of the 1960s. Not to be denied on any stage, Bulls star Michael Jordan made sure no team that postseason had confidence against the Bulls. Chicago had built a 3-0 edge in the 1993 Eastern Conference semifinals, but the Cavs had showed resolve in Game 4 on May 17, 1993 . The score was tied at 101 with 18.5 seconds left \u2026 and then Jordan worked his magic. Scottie Pippen brought the ball up, passed it to B.J. Armstrong on the right wing, who then got it to Jordan (who was guarded by Gerald Wilkins) with roughly 7 seconds left. Jordan then methodically worked his way to the right of the free throw line and drained a jumper as time expired from nearly the same spot he sunk the Cavs in 1989. The shot:  John Stockton nails 3-pointer to clinch Game 6 This win, which came on May 29, 1997 , will always be special to Jazz fans. It not only moved them on in a series, but moved the franchise on to its first-ever NBA Finals. The Jazz trailed by 13 points with less than seven minutes to play, but Stockton scored 15 of his game-high 25 in the final quarter, including the team\u2019s final nine points \u2014 none more dramatic than the series-ending 3-pointer. Stockton took the inbound pass from Bryon Russell behind a pick from Karl Malone and had a wide-open look from the top of the arc. Rockets forward Charles Barkley was too late coming over and Stockton\u2019s shot swished through at the buzzer. The shot:  Damian Lillard nails 3-pointer to clinch Game 6 In his first playoff run with the Portland Trail Blazers, second-year guard Damian Lillard made a lasting impression in Game 6 of the Western Conference first round. And he did it all in 9\/10ths of a second, too. On May 2, 2014 , the Houston Rockets had built a 98-96 lead thanks to a reverse layup by Chandler Parsons with :00.9 left. The Blazers called timeout to advance the ball to half court, where Nicolas Batum hit Lillard, who came off a screen at the top of the key with Parsons trailing him. Lillard let go of the shot from a step behind the 3-point line and it drew all net. In doing so, Lillard became the first player to make a buzzer-beating shot to win a playoff series since Stockton\u2019s shot against Houston in 1997. \u201cIt was a hell of a win. I don\u2019t know that it could have been any more dramatic.\u201d Blazers coach Terry Stotts said after Game 6. The shot:  Damian Lillard nails 37-foot 3-pointer in Game 5 Five years since he last powered Portland to a first-round series win, Damian Lillard was at it again with some late-game heroics on April 23, 2019 . First, his Trail Blazers had to climb from a 15-points, fourth-quarter deficit with 7 minutes, 45 seconds left to tie the game at 115. Then, fortune was on their side as the Thunder\u2019s Russell Westbrook missed a layup with 18.3 seconds left. That set the stage for Lillard, who dribbled the clock out to just under 2 seconds before taking his shot. Lillard lifted up for a 3-pointer a few steps ahead and to the right of the Blazers\u2019 halfcourt logo and drained the 37-footer in Paul George\u2019s face. From there, bedlam ensued and Lillard, who had just sealed the series, waved goodbye to the Thunder bench as he was mobbed by teammates. The shot:  Kawhi Leonard nails 15-foot jumper in Game 7 The Toronto Raptors traded for Kawhi Leonard in hopes he could tap into his vast postseason experience and fuel a long playoff run North of the border. He showed he still has that ability in spades in Game 7 of the 2019 Eastern Conference semifinals. Leonard hit a 15-foot shot from the corner over Joel Embiid at the buzzer that bounced off the rim four times before falling to give the Toronto Raptors a 92-90 victory in Game 7 of the East semifinals. Not only did it do that, but it was the first winning buzzer-beater in a Game 7 in NBA history. After Philadelphia\u2019s Jimmy Butler tied it with a driving layup with 4.2 seconds left, Toronto used its final timeout to draw up a play for Leonard, who dribbled toward the right corner and launched the high-arching shot. It bounced to the top of the backboard, hit the near side of the rim again, then the other side twice before going through, setting off a wild celebration as the Raptors advanced to the conference finals for the second time in four seasons. \u201dI ended up finding a spot that I like, that I work on. I just knew I had to shoot it high,\u201d Leonard said.

McCollum approached, gave him a big hug and asked, \u201cWhich shirt are you wearing\u201d for the Western Conference final? \u201cGot to flip a coin,\u201d Curry responded. Literally. With sons Stephen and Seth Curry becoming the first siblings to face each other in an NBA conference final, it\u2019s a dilemma most any parent would love to have. Dell and his wife, Sonya, decided wearing a split jersey with the Warriors and Blazers would be \u201ctoo easy.\u201d Instead, they\u2019ll flip a coin before each game in the best-of-seven series to determine which team they\u2019ll represent.  It will go something like this: If Sonya flips heads, she\u2019ll wear Blazers attire to support Seth, while Dell wears Stephen\u2019s Warriors colors. If the coin lands on tails, she\u2019ll dress in Warriors clothing while Dell dons Blazers gear. The next game Dell gets to flip the coin, and so on \u2013 until the series is decided. So who gets to flip the coin for Game 1 on Tuesday night? \u201cWell, we have to flip to see who flips first,\u201d Dell said with a laugh. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a lot of coin flipping going on.\u201d And a lot of traveling. Dell and Sonya Curry plan to attend every game, sitting with Stephen\u2019s wife Ayesha at Warriors home games and with Seth\u2019s fiance Callie Rogers when the Blazers host. But Dell, who played 16 seasons in the NBA and is currently a TV analyst for the Charlotte Hornets, said the entire situation is just a bit unnerving for him. \u201cI normally don\u2019t get nervous for games when either one of them play,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I got a little nervous knowing how they\u2019re going to play against each other.\u201d As hard as this will be on the parents, Dell knows it will be even more difficult for his sons. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be tough to put everything aside and battle each other because as siblings they want each other to do well,\u201d Dell said. \u201cThey watch each other\u2019s games and cheer for each other.\u201d Earlier this year, the Curry boys competed against each other in the 3-point shootout at the All-Star game in their hometown of Charlotte, with 31-year-old Steph getting the best of his younger brother. Seth, 28, said it\u2019s hard to believe they\u2019ll now meet in the playoffs. \u201cSo many years I\u2019ve watched Steph play in the Western Conference final, the NBA Finals, being in the crowd,\u201d Seth Curry said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be fun to be out there on the court, competing, to get to that final. It\u2019s a dream come true for us, but our families are going to have a lot of fun as well.\u201d Steph Curry has been to the NBA Finals four times, winning three with the Warriors. This is his brother\u2019s first playoff run. \u201cIt would be great for Seth to get a (championship) ring, but we can\u2019t root for one son over the other,\u201d 54-year-old Dell Curry said. \u201cWe\u2019re just going to let it play out and have fun watching them both play.\u201d Dell said it\u2019s been fun, and exhausting.

Then we give it an overall grade on a scale of 1-5 Robert Horrys, named for the patron saint of last-second answered prayers. * * * Kawhi Leonard carried the Toronto Raptors throughout their Eastern conference semifinal series with the Philadelphia 76ers. So it was only fitting that he willed them to victory in Game 7 , winning the series 4-3 with a long 2-pointer from the baseline that bounced four times on the rim before falling through after the buzzer had sounded. How large was Leonard\u2019s role in the win? He scored 41 of the Raptors\u2019 92 points, and attempted 39 of their 89 field goal attempts. He added eight rebounds, three assists and three steals for good measure. He scored 13 of the Raptors\u2019 final 15 points. DIFFICULTY: Considering how many shots Leonard had put up (38), it had to be difficult to muster enough energy for the 39th, especially having played 43 minutes. Plus, the defensive attention was laser-focused on him as the obvious go-to player with the game on the line. Leonard was just inside the 3-point line, but it was a tough baseline angle with his momentum carrying him toward the corner. GAME SITUATION: A trip to the Eastern Conference finals was on the line with 4.2 seconds left. Jimmy Butler had just scored with a finger-roll layup to tie the game at 90. Leonard took the inbound pass from Marc Gasol, curled quickly to his right on the dribble and pulled up with a fadeaway jumper in the far corner as Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons defended. CELEBRATION: The normally stoic Leonard yelled ecstatically as he was mobbed in the corner by teammates, who had watched Leonard\u2019s high-arching shot bounce not once, but two, three, four times off the rim before finding the bottom of the net. Rounding out the importance of the moment was Embiid, whose hands covered his head beside the mob of celebrants as he realized the shot ended the 76ers\u2019 playoff run. GRADE: It\u2019s possible to hit a tougher shot in a more meaningful game, but only if it was Game 7 of the conference finals or Game 7 of The Finals.

He needed to get to a spot where he could elevate and get his shot off. Game 7 was tied and there were 4.2 seconds left to play. He caught the inbounds pass to the left of the top of the key. Mission accomplished for inbounder Marc Gasol and basically everybody else in the Toronto organization. They got the ball to the right guy. \u201cIt\u2019s his call from there,\u201d Raptors coach Nick Nurse said afterward. Leonard\u2019s initial spin toward the right side of the floor took him 30 feet from the basket, with Ben Simmons on his hip. Joel Embiid left Pascal Siakam to double-team Leonard, but instead of making Leonard change direction, Embiid cut off Simmons and took him out of the play. By the time he found just enough space to elevate, Leonard was in the right corner, where Serge Ibaka had started the play before vacating to take himself and his defender out of Leonard\u2019s way. \u201cTalk about running to your spot,\u201d Marc Gasol said. \u201cHe ran about three quarters of the court.\u201d Leonard still had Embiid on his tail, and as he picked up his fourth dribble and elevated, the big man did a little bunny hop in order to time his final jump and contest the shot. Leonard got the shot off just in time. And in order to get it over Embiid\u2019s outstretched right hand, he had to put some air under it. \u201cI just knew I had to shoot it high,\u201d Leonard said afterward. \u201cA couple possessions before that, I had the same kind of shot from 3 and ended up coming short. I just thought I had to put it up even higher than that.\u201d J.J. Redick was watching from the Sixers\u2019 bench, having been replaced by James Ennis for defensive purposes. From there, he could tell that the shot wasn\u2019t going to make it in clean. \u201cIt looked short,\u201d Redick admitted. It was short, but the high arc proved to be key. It was the entry angle that gave the shot a chance. \u201cLooks like it\u2019s going in,\u201d Nurse reflected. \u201cLooked like it was going in the whole time to me.\u201d The first bounce was the most critical, off the near side of the rim. It was a high bounce, straight up, and it reversed the spin of the ball. \u201cWhen it hits at that angle and goes kind of straight up,\u201d Sixers coach Brett Brown said, \u201cyou feel like there\u2019s a chance.\u201d Fred VanVleet was on the Raptors\u2019 bench, right behind Leonard when he launched the shot. \u201cFrom that angle where we were at,\u201d VanVleet said, \u201cit didn\u2019t look like it was going in at all at first. It looked like it was a little to the left.\u201d If the NBA had ever adapted FIBA rules for basket interference, Jimmy Butler, Tobias Harris or James Ennis, all standing in the paint, could have jumped up and knocked the ball away to send the game to overtime. But they were all frozen, unable to do anything but watch. The second bounce was the winner. It hit the same spot as the first bounce, but with the ball now spinning in a counter-clockwise direction, it took the ball over to the other side. \u201cOnce it hit the rim once and twice,\u201d VanVleet said, \u201cit was like, \u2018This is Kawhi. This is gonna fall.\u2019 \u201d The third bounce hit the inside of the far side of the rim and up. The fourth and final bounce was the softest and in the same spot as the one previous one. From there, the ball dropped softly through the net. It was Leonard\u2019s 39th shot of the night \u2014 \u201cI didn\u2019t want to leave any shots in my mind,\u201d he said \u2014 and it was the first Game 7, game-winning buzzer-beater in NBA history. Scotiabank Arena exploded. Leonard was mobbed by his teammates. Embiid broke down in tears. Marc Gasol couldn\u2019t help but console the 25-year old center that he held to just 37 percent shooting in the series. \u201cLosing a game that way, last shot, after a hard-fought game, I can\u2019t explain it,\u201d Embiid said, \u201cIt just sucks.\u201d Raptors 92, Sixers 90 . By the thinnest of margins and the most fortunate of bounces, Toronto is going to the Eastern Conference finals for the second time in franchise history. Philly, meanwhile, heads into a summer of big questions, having been unable to ride its incredibly talented starting lineup beyond the East semifinals. Game 7 was a grind, not because the teams played poorly, but because they defended so well. The Raptors cut off the Sixers\u2019 dribble handoffs for J.J. Redick, and when the ball moved, their rotations were on point. The Sixers went scoreless on their first nine possessions of the game, but the Raptors led by just five after 12 minutes because Philadelphia\u2019s defense was nearly as good. The Sixers shut off pick-and-rolls for Leonard, preventing him from stepping into the in-rhythm jumpers that he got in Games 1-4. In all seven games of this series, the team that won was the team that led after the first quarter. But after winning the first quarter in Game 7, the Raptors trailed in the second, in the third, and in the fourth. The building got especially tense midway through the third period when the Sixers turned a nine-point deficit into a seven-point lead with a 16-0 run. But Kyle Lowry, the one man who knows Toronto\u2019s playoff angst like no other, saved the game and the season with a series of big plays in the final three minutes of the third. There were two offensive rebounds on the same possession, leading to a Leonard 3 that pulled the Raptors back within one. There was a tough transition layup over Embiid to put them ahead. After Embiid blocked a VanVleet fast break attempt, Lowry stripped Simmons of the ball, and threw a behind-the-back pass to Serge Ibaka for a lay-in. A Leonard flurry had the Raptors back up five midway through the fourth, but the Sixers drew even with a pair of Butler free throws and a Redick three-point play. When the Raptors\u2019 season was seemingly on the brink, they dug down for a three-possession stretch of elite defense. They didn\u2019t let Philly get into its sets easily, taking some time off the clock. They shut down Redick\u2019s dribble handoffs and scrambled back to Embiid. Every drive and every pass were met with a rotating defender. The first possession ended with Butler holding the ball in the right corner, helpless to do anything as the shot clock expired with Siakam in his jersey. The second possession ended with Butler heaving a long step-back 3-pointer at the shot-clock buzzer that had no chance. And after Leonard put the Raptors ahead, the third ended with Lowry stripping Embiid with just one second on the shot clock. \u201cWe just were doing it all,\u201d Nurse said. \u201cWe were pressuring the ball. We were corralling the right guys for a split second with two. We were either rotating or hustling back to our own, so just because we put two on the ball it didn\u2019t mean something was automatically open. And then we rebounded it after we contested.\u201d \u201cThose possessions, defensively, were awesome.\u201d Still, the Sixers didn\u2019t die. After Leonard left the door open with a missed free throw, Butler raced down the floor to tie the game with 4.2 seconds left. At that point, the Raptors had scored 90 points on 90 possessions and the Sixers had scored 90 on 89. One extra opportunity with the ball was the difference. Embiid played 45 minutes and 12 seconds, the most he\u2019s played in a regulation game in his career. Amazingly, the Sixers were outscored by 12 points in his 2:48 on the bench. Gasol was on the floor for all of that 45:12, making sure that there were no Embiid-vs.-Ibaka minutes. Ibaka was no liability on this night, though. He was a plus-22 in his 29 minutes, and the Raptors played big \u2013 with Leonard, Siakam, Ibaka and Gasol all on the floor \u2013 for the final 9:30 of the fourth quarter. They survived Leonard\u2019s 4:43 on the bench, outscoring the Sixers by two points in those minutes. Both teams played just seven guys, save for Greg Monroe\u2019s brutal 1:42 as Embiid\u2019s back up. Desperate times, desperate measures and all that. \u201cNo one wants to lose,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cEverything\u2019s on the line. You don\u2019t want to make no defensive mistakes to give the opponent an opportunity to score an easy look. I feel like both teams played that way at both ends of the floor.\u201d An instant classic, down to the very last drop. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

McCollum doesn\u2019t have a gesture for that time when he\u2019s ready to take his game to the next level. That signature move has long been reserved for his partner in crime, Portland Trail Blazers All-NBA point guard Damian Lillard. But after the show McCollum put on during what\u2019s usually designated \u201cDame Time,\u201d someone needs to come up with something. McCollum brought the fire that fueled the Trail Blazers\u2019 epic rally from a 17-point deficit to choke the life out of the Denver Nuggets 100-96 Sunday in Game 7 of the Western Conference semifinals at Pepsi Center. McCollum made sure the Blazers punched their ticket to the Western Conference finals for the first time in 19 years, where they\u2019ll battle the team Lillard grew up watching in Oakland during some of the Golden State Warriors\u2019 leaner years. McCollum\u2019s nuclear 37-point effort also cemented he and Lillard\u2019s status as one of the truly elite backcourts in basketball, one that can be counted on to shine as brightly in the postseason as it can in the regular season. From his wicked and methodical destruction of the Nuggets\u2019 attempts to take away his sweet spots to a critical chase-down block  in the fourth quarter , McCollum was in assassin mode on a night when \u201cDame Time\u201d never materialized. Lillard struggled through a brutal 3-for-17 outing , unable to get on track the way he did when he scored 32 points in the Blazers\u2019 Game 6 win in Portland Thursday that helped make Sunday possible. He couldn\u2019t muster the same effort he did in Game 5 of the first round , when his 37-foot buzzer-beater sent Oklahoma City Thunder into the offseason disappointed. Then again, he didn\u2019t have to with McCollum shredding the Nuggets at every turn. That McCollum\u2019s work \u2014 17-for-29 from the floor, just 1-for-3 from deep, to go with nine rebounds and that block \u2014 was delivered in the way it was, on the stage it was, lends credibility to the theory that outside of \u201cSplash Brothers\u201d Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson, Lillard and McCollum are the NBA\u2019s most dynamic guard tandem. But that\u2019s a conversation for another time, long after the raucous celebration the Blazers and their fans held in the corner Pepsi Center behind their bench after McCollum\u2019s pull-up jumper with 12.4 seconds provided the winning margin (and two Evan Turner free throws with 8 seconds left sealed the win). \u201cI thought I was aggressive,\u201d McCollum said. \u201cBefore the game, my brother texted me and told me not to settle. He told me to get to the midrange, get to the floater, get to the rim as much as possible, so I just tried to be as aggressive as possible \u2026 I wanted to empty the clip tonight. And I thought I did that.\u201d And then some. \u201cObviously, we tried to give him the ball in plans and have his teammates in the right spots,\u201d Blazers coach Terry Stotts said of what he dialed up for McCollum during his 22-point second half blitz. \u201cBut he wanted the ball and he has the ability to make things happen with it. We went to him down the stretch and he made some big plays.\u201d McCollum also managed the pressure of the game better than anyone else on the floor, on either team. The Nuggets clearly struggled with the magnitude of the moment. Jamal Murray endured a brutal shooting night (4-for-18) and showed his age (21). Nikola Jokic, a monster this entire series and postseason, ran out of gas late as the triple-double threat scored 29 points and grabbed 12 rebounds \u2026 but managed just two assists. \u201cFor us, tonight is the end of the season, but I\u2019m not going to allow this Game 7 loss to take away from the magical year,\u201d said Nuggets coach Mike Malone, whose team could not cash in on the league\u2019s best home record (34-7) during the regular season when they needed it most. As rewarding as it was to see his guys manage the pressure of Sunday\u2019s game \u2014 the same pressure that chewed up the young and higher-seeded Nuggets during their second-half meltdown \u2014 the Blazers realize the challenge that awaits in the two-time defending champs. The Warriors made some playoff magic of their own Friday night, eliminating the Houston Rockets in Game 6 of their conference semifinal without the services of two starters. Kevin Durant (calf strain) and DeMarcus Cousins (quad) will start the West finals unavailable for duty, but could make appearances in that series. So any joy derived from finally getting back to this level since 2000 will be short-lived. The immediate future for the Blazers involves diving right back into the bunker for Game 1 against the Warriors on Tuesday at Oracle Arena ( 9 ET, ESPN ), where Lillard and McCollum can reacquaint themselves with the Splash Brothers. Add to that the storyline of (Blazers reserve guard) Seth and Stephen Curry becoming the first brothers in NBA history to compete against one another in a conference finals. The proper perspective for what McCollum did today likely won\u2019t come until years from now, when his playing days are over. Such is the fate of a performance that is as breathtaking in real time as it had to be for Blazers fans, and as riveting as it was for basketball fans engrossed in the first of the day\u2019s two Game 7s. It\u2019ll go down in history as one of the iconic moments for a franchise that has seen few of them in the nearly two decades that have passed since their last West finals berth. \u201cThis is arguably the biggest win we\u2019ve had in the franchise for a long time,\u201d Stotts said when asked how he was managing his emotions as a loud celebration could be heard coming from the Blazers\u2019 locker room. \u201cTo be a part of it, to do it the way we did, I\u2019m thrilled. I\u2019m really happy for our guys. As a coach, I think you experience the joy of the team, having different guys come in. Rodney [Hood] going down, Evan [Turner] coming in, I think he scored more points tonight than he scored in the whole series, probably \u2026 it\u2019s such a group thing and as a coach, that\u2019s what you appreciate the most.\u201d Getting to this point for the Blazers required a trust in each other built on a commitment that Lillard and McCollum have made to one another and, in turn, to their teammates. They knew they\u2019d only get this far by all working together. Sure, the headlines are reserved for the stars. That\u2019s the way it works in Portland and everywhere else. The highlight plays, McCollum\u2019s block, won\u2019t go away anytime soon. And with good reason. \u201cI just went and got it \u2018Bron (LeBron James)-style,\u201d the Ohio native said. \u201cShout out to my guy \u2018Bron from the 330 [area code]. It was a mini-version of \u2018Bron\u2019s block on Iggy (Warriors swingman Andre Iguodala, in Game 7 of The 2016 Finals ). I definitely didn\u2019t get up as high but it was a cool play. Might get a picture of that one. Hang that joint up.\u201d But if said stars don\u2019t set the culture, what good is it? It should be noted that the Blazers dug in hardest after series hero and reserve forward Rodney Hood went down with a hyperextended left knee with 5:35 to play in the third quarter. The Blazers were down 60-55. Turner checked into the game for Hood, who did not return after starting the second half with fellow Game 6 hero and reserve Zach Collins. The Blazers climbed all the way back to even and actually took a 71-70 lead into the fourth quarter, stunning both the Nuggets and their crowd, as they set the stage for fourth-quarter heroics. McCollum (eight points) and Lillard (six of his 13) made their presence felt. But it was Collins (five) and Turner (10, including a 6-for-7 effort from the free throw line) that proved just as critical. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel that way right now, but when I reflect and when our players reflect on what we were able to accomplish \u2026 hell of a year. I couldn\u2019t ask for anything more of our guys.\u201d Neither could Stotts, who watched different players step up throughout the series. \u201cI just think we\u2019re a pretty tough team,\u201d Turner said. \u201cWe always stay together, we stay confident. We\u2019ve always been a confident group. Everybody talks about the playoffs over the past two years and I think we\u2019ve paid our dues to really get to this point, to battle through. We had adversity this whole year with [owner] Paul [Allen] going down [he passed away before the season], with [Starting center Jusuf] Nurkic going down and Jon Yim being in a car accident [during the playoffs]. I think once again, pressure can bust pipes or make diamonds, so we never thought we were going to lose or anything like that.\u201d The resolve to fight back and win two straight games in this series shows not only the growth and development of this team that was swept out of the playoffs in each of its past two appearances, but it also makes public the ingredients that define the franchise, according to Lillard. \u201cI think it speaks to the character of our organization and what we\u2019ve become,\u201d Lillard said. \u201cWe had the roster turnover four years ago and everyone was quick to shoot us down and count us out. At that point we didn\u2019t know for sure what direction we were going to go into, but we definitely leaned on the culture we wanted to create. We leaned on that \u2014 doing things the right way, working hard, being about each other and not being about one guy or two guys. I think we really built that up from the jump.\u201d And it shows now. The Blazers, the often overlooked No. 3 seed in the Western Conference playoffs in each of the past two postseasons, are indeed headed to the conference finals. \u201cTo have that,\u201d Lillard said, \u201cit takes everybody. Not just the players; you have to have the coaches, training staff, front office, security, everybody who is with us every day. The [public relations] staff, everybody we see every day. Everybody is invested in what we created. When we come out on top in a tough game like this, a tough series like this, you see it in everybody\u2019s celebration.\u201d * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

Denver has already won a Game 7 this season, also at home, topping San Antonio in the first round. Nikola Jokic had a triple-double \u2014 21 points, 15 rebounds, 10 assists \u2014 in that game for the Nuggets, and coach Michael Malone is fond of saying his team has the best home-court advantage in the NBA. But Jokic isn\u2019t banking on home court being enough of an edge. He says it\u2019s imperative to bring more energy Sunday \u2014 and adds there\u2019s no reason to get nervous. \u201cI\u2019ve played basketball for 15 years,\u201d Jokic said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve done my whole life.

Portland\u2019s two top scorers, Lillard and CJ McCollum, have combined for 311 points in the series. Denver\u2019s two top scorers, Jokic and Jamal Murray, have combined for 309. Given how the star power seems to cancel out, expect Game 7 to be decided by a third option or role player who steps up. INJURY WATCH Rotations aren\u2019t expected to change much, if at all, for either team going into Game 7. KEEP AN EYE ON Denver\u2019s 3-point shooting. The Nuggets beat the Spurs in a Game 7 despite going 2 for 20 from beyond the arc. They can\u2019t expect to do that again and beat the Blazers. PRESSURE IS ON Slightly more on Denver, simply because the Nuggets are home. Being on the road may actually keep Portland somewhat loose. * * * 76ERS AT RAPTORS Series tied 3-3. Game 7, 7 ET, TNT NEED TO KNOW Both teams have a five-point road win already in this series, and the other four games have all been double-digit victories by the home club. Having two days off between Game 6 and Game 7 probably was welcomed by everybody, particularly 76ers star Joel Embiid, who will likely need to play very big minutes Sunday. The 76ers have outscored the Raptors by 80 points in 192 minutes with Embiid on the floor in this series, and the Raptors have outscored the 76ers by 97 points in the 96 minutes that he\u2019s been on the bench. INJURY WATCH All the usual names are expected to play. KEEP AN EYE ON The first few minutes. Nerves get amped up in Game 7 and the first team to settle into a rhythm will have a major edge. Toronto is 7-0 in the playoffs when leading at halftime, 0-4 when trailing at the break. PRESSURE IS ON Everybody, of course, but Philadelphia has only four players who know what Game 7 feels like. Toronto has nine Game 7 veterans."},{"id":33762,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/ap-source-cavs-interview-assistants-head-coach","date":"2019-05-12","title":"AP source: Cavs interviewing 4 assistants for coaching job","content":" CLEVELAND \u2014 The Cavs\u2019 coaching search has picked up speed. Cleveland is meeting with four NBA assistants this weekend in Denver to try and fill its coaching vacancy, a person familiar with the team\u2019s plans told The Associated Press. The Cavaliers met Friday night with Denver assistant Jordi Fernandez and interviewed Orlando\u2019s Steve Hetzel on Saturday, according to the person who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the talks. The person says the team also has meetings scheduled with Nuggets assistant Wes Unseld Jr. and Portland\u2019s David Vanterpool. The Cavs would still like to meet with Trail Blazers assistant Nate Tibbetts, the person said. Fernandez is believed to be a front-runner for the job because of his previous connections with Cleveland. The 36-year-old He started his coaching career with the Cavaliers in 2009. He has experience in player development and he\u2019s the kind of young coach who could mesh easily with t a young team. Hetzel also has worked for the Cavs, first as the team\u2019s video coordinator and then coach of the G League Canton Charge. Prior to his time with Cleveland, Hetzel was a developmental coach with Detroit. He was an assistant for four seasons in Charlotte under Steve Clifford before joining him with the Magic. Unseld, whose father is a Hall of Fame player, is Denver coach Michael Malone\u2019s top assistant. He\u2019s been with the Nuggets since 2015 and has been credited with the club\u2019s major defensive improvement. The 46-year-old Vanterpool has been with the Trail Blazers since 2012. The Cavaliers have been looking for a coach since parting ways with Larry Drew after a 19-63 season, the club\u2019s first after LeBron James left as a free agent. Drew took over six games into the season after Tyronn Lue was fired. Cleveland\u2019s taking a methodical approach with its coaching search, which is unlikely to wrap up before Tuesday\u2019s NBA draft lottery. The team has already met with Dallas assistant coach Jamahl Mosely, Miami assistant Juwan Howard, former Memphis coach J.B.

So it\u2019s only right that this Eastern Conference semifinal comes down to a game in which both teams\u2019 efforts \u2014 and dreams for an Eastern Conference championship \u2014 are on the line. Maybe the result of Game 7 on Sunday ( 7 ET, TNT ) affects what happens in free agency. Maybe it doesn\u2019t. Either way, it will be fascinating to see which of these teams was more right to prioritize the present over the future. We may know the answer early on: Whoever led at the end of the first quarter has won all six games of the series, and both teams are undefeated (the Sixers are 6-0 and the Raptors are 7-0) in the postseason after leading by double-digits. But Game 7 promises to be different from the other six, which were all different than one another. It\u2019s unlikely that any major adjustment, in regard to scheme at least, will be made. Both teams know they can win playing the way they\u2019ve been playing. They just have to play well. There will likely be an adjustment in rotations. You won\u2019t see Boban Marjanovic on the floor unless the game is out of hand in the fourth quarter. Both teams might play seven-man rotations, with the schedule \u2014 two full days off between Games 6 and 7, and then two full days off before Game 1 of the conference finals \u2014 allowing the starters to play extended minutes. The most important minutes, of course, are those of Kawhi Leonard and Joel Embiid. In the series, the Raptors have been 23.2 points per 100 possessions better with Leonard on the floor (plus-7.0) than they\u2019ve been with him off the floor (minus-16.2). The Sixers have been 67.0 points per 100 possessions better with Joel Embiid on the floor (plus-20.9) than they\u2019ve been with him off the floor (minus-46.1). In the series thus far, the Sixers have outscored the Raptors by 50 points in the 158 minutes that both have been on the floor together. But both teams have won the Leonard vs. Embiid minutes in three of the six games, and each team has lost a game in which they outscored the other with both stars on the floor. Even though Game 6 was a blowout, Leonard played almost 40 minutes, while Embiid played 35:33 (the most he\u2019s played in this series). You can be sure that both will play as much as physically possible on Sunday. Leonard\u2019s career high for minutes in a non-OT game was Game 7 of the 2013 Finals , when he played exactly 45 minutes. Embiid\u2019s career high was 42:21 in a regular-season game \u2026 against the Raptors in February. When they\u2019re on the floor, Leonard and Embiid will be the focus of the opposing defenses, and that will put pressure on other guys to make shots. The Sixers have shown Leonard a crowd when he\u2019s put the ball on the floor and have tried to keep Embiid in the paint to protect the rim. The Raptors, especially their bigs (including Pascal Siakam, who has often been Embiid\u2019s assignment), have found themselves open beyond the arc. In their three wins, the Raptors have an effective field goal percentage of 52 percent on shots outside the paint, with Siakam and Marc Gasol combining to shoot 12-for-31 (39 percent) from 3-point range. In their three losses, their eFG% outside the paint drops to 39 percent, with Siakam and Gasol combining to shoot only 5-for-24 (21 percent) from beyond the arc. Defending the paint \u2014 against Ben Simmons in transition, Jimmy Butler on the pick-and-roll, and Embiid in the post or rolling to the rim \u2014 has also been priority No. 1 for the Raptors. The Sixers have actually shot slightly more effectively from the outside in their losses (46.0 percent) than they have in their wins (45.5 percent). But in those wins, they\u2019ve shot 58 percent in the paint. In their losses, they\u2019ve shot just 46 percent in the paint, and have been forced to shoot more from the outside. It could simply come down to makes and misses on Sunday. And with more capable shooters and home-court advantage \u2014 home teams are 105-28 in Game 7 in NBA history \u2014 Toronto should be the favorite. But both defenses can play a role in whether those shots are open and in rhythm. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to pick what you\u2019re trying to do [defensively],\u201d Raptors coach Nick Nurse said earlier this week. \u201cAnd if your priority is to keep it out of someone\u2019s hands or keep them from shooting, then you\u2019re probably expecting to have to make rotations. \u201cI think it\u2019s way more of a want-to than it is a scheme.\u201d Both teams should have maximum want-to in a Game 7. But only one can win. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

Vogel interviewed for the position on Thursday and reportedly left a good impression on general manager Rob Pelinka. Tania Ganguli of the Los Angeles Times reports that Jason Kidd will join Vogel\u2019s staff as an assistant coach. The 45-year old Vogel worked for the organization before as an advance scout during the 2005-06 season. He did not coach last season following two years with the Orlando Magic. Vogel went to Orlando following five-plus seasons leading the Indiana Pacers, including trips to the Eastern Conference finals in 2013 and \u201914. He has a career record of 304-291. Now paired with LeBron James, Vogel will coach a player he could never get past in the playoffs. The Pacers thought they had a title-contender in 2012, 2013 and 2014, and James and the Miami Heat eliminated them in all three of those postseasons. Vogel won 58 percent of his games in parts of six seasons with Indiana, but the lasting image of his tenure there is the fact that those clubs were always ousted by Miami. Now, Vogel and James will be on the same side, both looking for a resurgence. This season was James\u2019 first without a playoff appearance since 2005 and ended his streak of eight consecutive trips to the NBA Finals. Vogel is coming off a 54-110 tenure in two seasons with Orlando, while the Magic were rebuilding. Kidd interviewed with the Lakers last month. The former star player who was a head coach in Brooklyn and Milwaukee was fired by the Bucks during the 2017-18 season. He has a 183-190 record. A little more than a week ago, the Lakers were thought to be close to reaching a deal with former Cleveland Cavaliers coach Tyronn Lue. However, Lue pulled out of talks with the Lakers for the job, reportedly declining the team\u2019s three-year, $18 million offer to coach there. The Lakers also considered Monty Williams, who was hired by the Phoenix Suns, and Juwan Howard and J.B. Bickerstaff. The former Memphis Grizzlies coach J.B. Bickerstaff interviewed with the Lakers on Thursday, according to reports. The Lakers have been without a coach since Luke Walton and the team agreed to part ways shortly after the 2018-19 season ended.

No amount of name-calling, shoving, screaming, shouting or tough guy antics and gestures will save you when it\u2019s all on the line in Game 7 of the NBA playoffs. And there are enough guys playing for both the Denver Nuggets and Portland Trail Blazers that know it, even if most of them have only observed a Game 7 from the stands or even further afar. It\u2019s a simple proposition, these Game 7 affairs. You win, you play on. Your season continues and all of the goals you set are still attainable. You lose, you\u2019re done. None of the things you believed in before that last opening tip of the season remain. Pack up your stuff and head home for the summer. That\u2019s the reality, the fate both the Nuggets and Trail Blazers are facing Sunday afternoon at Pepsi Center ( 3:30 ET, ABC ), the all-important Game 7 showdown in the Western Conference semifinals that will define one team\u2019s season and render the other\u2019s moot. There\u2019s a finality to it, a certain air of drama that cannot be found anywhere else in the postseason. So it doesn\u2019t matter if you have \u201csassy *** dudes, frontrunners,\u201d as Blazers reserve guard Seth Curry put it after things got chippy late in Game 6 Thursday night, one side or broadcast talent on the other taking cheap and unnecessary shots at injured Blazers center Jusuf Nurkic, Sunday afternoon\u2019s business is an up-and-down affair for all involved. Win and you play on or lose and you\u2019re done. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to Game 7,\u201d Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. \u201cGames 7s are special.\u201d No extracurricular activity from either side will change that fact. \u201cBoth teams want to win the game,\u201d said Nuggets center Nikola Jokic. \u201cBasketball is an emotional game. Of course, we\u2019re going to talk trash or whatever. Both teams just want to win the game.\u201d That doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t look for every advantage possible to help fuel your cause. Blazers big man Zach Collins played a huge role in making sure this series found its way to Game 7, joining Rodney Hood in providing a huge boost off the bench in Game 6 . And it was more than just his season-high 29 minutes and playoff career-high 14 points and five blocks. It was his physicality and activity around the rim and in the paint on both ends of the floor, his refusal to allow the Nuggets to find a groove. \u201cWe\u2019ve just got to go in and keep playing our game,\u201d Collins said. \u201cI said it after the game, [Denver] has been way too comfortable for a lot of games in this series and [in Game 6] we made them a little uncomfortable. We just need to continue that, regardless of if it\u2019s a Game 7 or not. Obviously, it\u2019s win or go home for both teams. It\u2019s going to be very difficult, especially in [Denver] to go in and get a win, but we can do it.\u201d The Nuggets leaned on their sterling 34-7 record at Pepsi Center during the regular season, the best home mark in the league, as a confidence booster two weeks ago. \u201cWe have the best home court advantage in the NBA,\u201d Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to rely on that once again and try to close it out in Game 7.\u201d The Nuggets owning that recency advantage: they needed a Game 7 win here to survive the San Antonio Spurs in the first round, means something. The game and that series provided lessons Malone\u2019s postseason rookies need to tap into this time around, even if they don\u2019t realize it now. \u201cIt\u2019s weird,\u201d Nuggets guard Jamal Murray said. \u201cEverybody keeps talking about experience. And I just want to say that we\u2019ve been here before. [We go] back home and regroup like we did for San Antonio, come back with energy and just \u2026 be ready to play. I think we had too many lapses [in Game 6]. Dame [Lillard] felt really comfortable, he wasn\u2019t comfortable last time, so we need to be tougher on him \u2026 like I said, just regroup, come back and get a win.\u201d If only it was that simple. The pressure to get out of the first round is one thing. The opportunity to make the conference finals is a different monster. The Nuggets last played in a conference final in 2009, when Carmelo Anthony, Chauncey Billups, Kenyon Martin, J.R. Smith and Nene led the way. That group had a mix of seasoned pros who had championship (Billups) and extensive experience (Billups and Martin) competing on a championship level, to go along with younger and emerging superstar talent like Anthony. And they were ultimately no match for the Kobe Bryant and Pau Gasol-led Los Angeles Lakers. So these current Nuggets are well within their right to acknowledge the very real anxiety that comes with a game of this magnitude. \u201cNo nerves, \u201cJokic said. \u201cI just felt something different the first game of the playoffs because it was something different. Just because we call it the playoffs, Besides that, everything else is the same.\u201d The Blazers haven\u2019t seen a Game 7 since a 2003 first-round series against Dallas. But they do not believe the absence of experience in this case makes any bit of difference. \u201cIt\u2019s just another game \u2014 a game we want to win, obviously,\u201d Blazers guard CJ McCollum said. \u201cWe understand what\u2019s at stake. Somebody\u2019s got to go home. Somebody\u2019s got to go to Cabo, go to Cancun, as Chuck [Barkley] would say. For us, it\u2019s go out there and compete, find the coach\u2019s game plan, understanding that it\u2019s going to be a pretty hostile crowd and they\u2019ll be confident at home, but we\u2019ve got to bring the energy and pressure just like we did [in Game 6].\u201d Damian Lillard has guided his team this far and promised to stick to the basics in the days and hours leading up to the game. Rested bodies and minds are crucial. \u201cThe number one thing is have our minds right,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t overthink, don\u2019t make some big crazy deal or anything like that. We\u2019re going to play a basketball game. It\u2019s a big game and we\u2019ve won on their floor before and we know what type of mentality we had when we did that. We\u2019ve got to go out there, be tough, be physical, be sharp in our scouting report, play for each other, play with each other on both ends and just put the pressure on them. \u201cMake them earn everything on their offensive end and then when we get the ball, make sure that we get shots up,\u201d Lillard continued with his simple but extremely detailed breakdown of what needs to be done. \u201cValue every possession, don\u2019t go out there turning the ball over, playing into their hands where they get an opportunity to get their crowd involved. So that has to be our mentality, to just be sharp, be physical, go in there ready to take the game, because the only way it\u2019s going to happen is us going in there and taking it.\u201d It\u2019s a Game 7, after all, no extra drama needed. * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

But the term \u201cClutch City\u201d took on entirely different meaning this time around for the Rockets. Instead of grabbing a Larry O\u2019Brien trophy \u2014 and let\u2019s put this as delicately as possible \u2014 the Rockets put their hands around \u2026 something else. Like, a certain body part below their chin. How else to describe what happened down the stretch of this playoff series against the Warriors, why they couldn\u2019t beat a team without Kevin Durant for the final five quarters, and especially how they crashed in the, ahem \u2026 clutch moments on their home floor Friday? Yes, it\u2019s true the Warriors demonstrated for 48 minutes how you should never underestimate the heart of a champion \u2014 with a nod to former Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich \u2014 and Steph Curry awakened from his shooting slumber and scoreless first half with a fourth-quarter flourish in the Warriors\u2019 118-113 victory at Toyota Center. This was a testament to the two-time defending champions\u2019 experience and most of all their pride. Give the Warriors that. But the Rockets lost this series as much, if not more, than the Warriors won it. This was, pure and simply, a colossal collapse; a blown opportunity that Rockets coach Mike D\u2019Antoni rightly said will \u201cleave a mark,\u201d perhaps on the franchise\u2019s throat. They had every reason to win the last two games and did everything to lose them. More unforgivably, they were at home Friday, before their crowd, with the healthier \u2014 and arguably better \u2014 team given the circumstances, and failed in every sense. What exactly was that? \u201cWe\u2019re going home,\u201d said Chris Paul. \u201cThat\u2019s what it is.\u201d In the immediate aftermath of Warriors\u2019 clinching Game 6 victory, the scene in the hallway leading to each locker room proved telling. On one end, the Warriors squealed like schoolyard kids at recess, with high-fives flying, impromptu hugs shared and plenty of strut and sashay. On the other end, a stream of zombies walked somberly in single file. A state of complete shock. James Harden wore a stone face like the Moai statues on Easter Island. Austin Rivers was in tears. PJ Tucker never looked up, and somehow didn\u2019t bump into something or someone. Paul dressed in record time for him \u2014 did he even take a shower? \u2014 and briskly made his way through his postgame press conference before quickly slipping out the door. Their heads surely ached with the still-fresh sounds and sights of Curry dropping 3-pointers in their face and the Warriors making defensive stops and the Rockets themselves turning meeker by the minute as the game creeped to a close. This is how their season ended, deflating during the stretch. When a team shows slumped shoulders and speaks in monotone and sits in a locker room that has all the charm of a funeral home, then you know what they must know, in their hearts: They gagged. \u201cWe lost,\u201d said Paul, before muttering, \u201cand that\u2019s stupid.\u201d Understand that the Rockets not only couldn\u2019t beat the Warriors without Durant, but Golden State didn\u2019t have Curry, in a sense, for roughly three of those five Durant-less quarters. Curry couldn\u2019t even make layups. Seriously, that\u2019s the Warriors without their two best players. And the Rockets couldn\u2019t outscore them, couldn\u2019t figure them out, couldn\u2019t prevent this collapse. \u201cWe didn\u2019t play smart enough and at times, not hard enough,\u201d said Tucker. Also consider this: The shortchanged Warriors in Game 6 were forced to give significant minutes to old Andre Iguodala (who made the Rockets pay for leaving him open with five shots from deep), old Andrew Bogut, a G-league last season (Alfonzo McKinnie), a career 4.5 scorer (Kevon Looney), the undrafted Quinn Cook and a regressing second rounder in Jordan Bell \u2026 and never trailed by more than seven points. Those role players out-hustled the Rockets and played with poise. Curry and Klay Thompson combined for 60 and tag-teamed the Rockets to an ultimate death, with Thompson hitting early, scoring 21 of his 27 in the first half and keeping the Warriors close. This was crucial, because Curry fought through foul trouble, playing only 12 minutes, and a case of the shooting yips. Yet Curry was the closer with 23 of his 33 points in just nine minutes of fourth-quarter playing time. It was a fantastic flurry of buckets and guts. That marked a career playoff-high for any quarter, for a player whose postseasons have been marked by stretches of less than spectacular shooting; this series running much of the same. But by sprinting off screens and shaking free of the defense, Curry shot 6-for-8, made all eight free throw attempts and ripped out Houston\u2019s heart. \u201cThat man is a competitor and a champion,\u201d said Thompson. \u201cHe plays with such great heart. His composure is unbelievable.\u201d The Rockets offered no resistance, even when they looked for their leaders. Harden led the league in scoring this regular season, when he played MVP-quality basketball, but was outplayed by Curry when it counted. Harden missed five free throws and had six turnovers for the game, then walked off the floor without shaking hands at the buzzer. This face-palm by the Rockets actually began with slightly more than two minutes left in the third quarter in Game Five when Durant grabbed his strained calf and walked away from the second-round series for good. The Rockets crumbled in that game, when Harden took only three shots in the fourth quarter, and then again in this one. \u201cWe let opportunities slip away, opportunities in the last game, opportunities in Game 1 and 2,\u201d Harden said. His legacy is solidified by the last four seasons: he won an MVP, finished second in another season and will either win another award this season or finish runner-up again. But there\u2019s another stigma growing as well in his basketball portfolio: Playoff failure. Last spring against the Warriors, Harden misfired in the final two playoff games, both losses. This time, he had no fourth-quarter answers in the last two games, both tight finishes. Paul scored 27 points Friday, but this was a case of too little, too late. He didn\u2019t post a signature game this series and once again failed to reach the NBA Finals, as he now begins to show signs of depreciation. Remember when the Rockets were punishing the Warriors in this series by pounding them in the paint? Tucker was a menace until he was tamed the last two games by Looney. The backup big pitched in to keep Tucker off the glass Friday (just four rebounds) and surprised the Rockets by scoring 14 points. And that was a wrap. The arena turned quiet, the Rockets went quieter. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone in this locker room thought this was going to be our last game of the season,\u201d said Gerald Green. With Harden, Paul, Tucker, Eric Gordon and Clint Capela, the Rockets aren\u2019t hurting for talent, and the 3-point-happy system by D\u2019Antoni maximizes the skills of his team. Is that system that can win a championship? Do the Rockets\u2019 core players, especially Harden and Paul, have a championship gene running through their bodies, or not? All are fair questions and concerns today, one of mourning for the Rockets. \u201cYou play to win or you play not to lose,\u201d said D\u2019Antoni. \u201cThey\u2019re playing to win. We need to get that mentality.\u201d Somewhat surprisingly, less than an hour after the game, Harden mentioned how \u201cit was a pretty good year for us.\u201d Talk about poor timing. This \u201cyear\u201d ended poorly and sourly and had all the elements of a team that couldn\u2019t handle urgency or opportunity. But maybe the Rockets\u2019 own expectations weren\u2019t high to begin with. Houston saw a chance and apparently it spooked them. Maybe it didn\u2019t matter if Durant played or not. The Warriors have what the Rockets never showed last year, or this year, and Toyota Center once again served as a final resting place for the home team. Except this time, the knife plunged deeper. \u201cThis is not something you get over it,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said. \u201cThis hurts.\u201d * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

He\u2019s the defensive-minded point guard who made a name for himself years ago with the Houston Rockets, bringing indefatigable energy and a fearless mentality against the game\u2019s biggest stars while earning stripes as a professional nuisance in the process. Each of those qualities transferred with him to the LA Clippers \u2014 the franchise Beverley was traded to in a multi-player deal for Chris Paul two summers ago \u2014 and were on full-blown display in their most recent playoff appearance against Golden State. Beverley, who was assigned the unenviable task of guarding Warriors star Kevin Durant, brought the intensity to a series many experts thought would end in a sweep. Helping get Durant ejected in Game 1, he then hounded the two-time Finals MVP in Game 2 as Durant was held to eight points and attempted just three shots when matched up against Beverley , his primary defender. The game ended with LA staging the greatest comeback in NBA playoff history. While the Warriors would win the series in six, and Durant would respond with the prolific performances he\u2019s accustomed to, Beverley has undoubtedly earned the respect of his peers. He sat down to discuss that, free agency, his favorite teammate ever and his relationship with fellow Chicago native Derrick Rose. NBA.com: You\u2019ve really earned the respect from people across the league. LeBron James recently complimented you and a couple of other teammates. He called you a \u201cdog\u201d on the court. What did you think of that comment and what makes you such a dog out there? Beverley: I just go out there and try to play the right way. I think my biggest trait is to play extremely hard within the rules of the game. It\u2019s just different. When you\u2019re in L.A., you have a different platform than playing anywhere else. Brighter lights. Bigger media. I\u2019ve always been that type of dog player. But coming from Houston then coming to L.A., and of course playing Golden State on the biggest stage, it\u2019s easier to notice more. NBA.com: Yeah, you guys didn\u2019t get too many prime-time games this year. Beverley: We only got like three (national) games this season. So yeah, a lot of people couldn\u2019t see it. NBA.com: Some spectators have labeled you as an \u2018irritant\u2019 on the court. Do you embrace that word as well? Beverley: Nah, I just go out there and be me. I\u2019m the same way if I play cards, if I play video games, if I\u2019m competitive with the homies, I\u2019m the same way. If people choose to have emotions or feelings behind the way I am all the time, then that\u2019s on them. NBA.com: Was Game 2 against the Warriors the craziest game you\u2019ve ever been a part of? Down 31 in the third, and making the biggest comeback in NBA playoff history. Beverley: Honestly, we were so lost in the game that we didn\u2019t even know we were down that much until we looked up and it was a close game and we thought we had a chance. We just wanted to get lost in the game and that\u2019s what we did Game 2. NBA.com: Talk about your relationship with Derrick Rose. Two guys from Chicago, played against each other in high school and are somewhat best friends. Beverley: He\u2019s like my brother. Anything I ask for, he gives it. Vice versa. Whether it\u2019s a car to drive if I\u2019m in his town for a week, or if his girl flies to L.A. and (the Minnesota Timberwolves) haven\u2019t gotten there yet, then she comes to my house until they land. It\u2019s just a family thing. We always support each other. Always have each other\u2019s back. If someone\u2019s going through surgery, we\u2019re right there with him. It\u2019s that Chicago love.                    NBA.com: Did you watch the emotional documentary that came out this year of him finding out he got traded from the Bulls? Beverley: I didn\u2019t even watch. I don\u2019t like to watch all that stuff. NBA.com: Why not? Beverley: Because I understand the type of player he is. And the way he puts his heart into things. You don\u2019t want to see something like that. NBA.com: What were your thoughts on that trade, going from you guys\u2019 hometown to the city of New York? Beverley: I thought it was a good opportunity for him. I thought he was leaving another platform and starting over new. Away from home. Finally get a chance to be his own man and start fresh. Besides the injuries, he played well in New York,. He came back and played well in Minnesota. If he\u2019s healthy, he\u2019s gonna be a dog. NBA.com: Do you think he still has a case to make the Hall of Fame if he keeps at it? Beverley: I think so. I think he\u2019s gotta put a little bit more work in. I know his goal is trying to get Sixth Man, but I always tell him \u201cjust go out there and be you, dog. Whatever that is.\u201d https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/Bp5k8puBdpH\/ NBA.com: You\u2019ll be a free agent this summer for the first time. What will help determine Pat\u2019s approach in free agency? Beverley: I feel like I can play with any team. Whatever team that is, I feel like I can make an instant impact. It\u2019s all about doing the right things. Building a new culture. Whether it\u2019s a young team that I\u2019m with and I have to build a new culture, or if it\u2019s a team that\u2019s already established and I have to figure out how can I fit in and make this team better, I\u2019m selfless when it comes to that. NBA.com: Some people have linked you to Dallas. And then you sent out that tweet to Luka Doncic. What was that about? Beverley: I saw him follow me (on social media) earlier. So I\u2019m thinking the same thing. I\u2019m just having fun with it, man. It\u2019s a good time to be a free agent. NBA.com: Could you see yourself having fun playing alongside a player like Luka? Beverley: Of course. He\u2019s ball dominant, makes the right plays. If that does come, it would be me, Luka, Tim Hardaway Jr., (Kristaps) Porzingis, Courtney Lee. It\u2019s tough when you actually think about it. But I\u2019m going to have fun with free agency man. I work hard. I\u2019m gonna enjoy this process. NBA.com: If you were to change teams, you\u2019re bound to make an impact on the culture as you stated. You were a part of the rise of the Rockets and now these reinvigorated Clippers. What goes into changing the culture? Beverley: I go out there and be me. I call a spade a spade. If you\u2019re doing things the wrong way, I\u2019m going to let you know regardless if you\u2019re the max-contract guy on the team or the two-way guy on the team. I\u2019m gonna keep it real consistent. I\u2019m real black and white, not a lot of grey with me. You gone get all of it. NBA.com: You had sort of a \u201cblack and white\u201d exchange with your opponent Paul George this season. You told him \u201cI locked you up.\u201d Can you talk about that situation and locking star players up? Beverley: I just locked him up that game. I was fortunate they came off a back-to-back. I look at all that. I don\u2019t think he thought that (the Clippers\u2019 coaching staff) was gonna put me on him. Kind of threw him off guard. I won that battle that night. I won that battle. Fortunate for me, it was the last time we played them in the season, so I know he\u2019s gone come out next year ready. But yeah, I felt like that game I locked him up. And I did. NBA.com: Speaking of Paul George, he called that epic shot by Damian Lillard a bad shot. Lillard called it bad defense. Where do you stand? Beverley: Man, Dame\u2019s been shooting them shots since he\u2019s been in the NBA. And all the shots Paul George shoots are tough shots anyways, so it\u2019s funny that he argues about bad shots when he makes all the toughest shots that players can\u2019t make. Him and KD. NBA.com: You were on that Rockets team when Lillard hit that other series-ending buzzer-beater a few years ago. When you saw the one he made against OKC were you like, \u201cwow, D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\u201d? Beverley: That\u2019s the same thing I said. (I remember being) on the court, watching the ball go through the net. NBA.com: It\u2019s a lot of up-and-coming players in the league. You played with two nice rookies in Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Landry Shamet. What other young player should people look out for? Beverley: Jerome Robinson. We drafted him right after Shai. He played in the playoffs and he played well. I think he\u2019s got a chance to become a point guard.  NBA.com: Were there any young players you guarded in games and thought \u201cman, he might be a problem in the future?\u201d Beverley: Trae Young. I say Trae Young and Luka. They\u2019re both tough. NBA.com: What is something you wished the common fan understood more about basketball? Beverley: The IQ of it. People see all the dunks, all the 3s and all of that. And in people\u2019s eyes, if you\u2019re not LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry or the unicorns, or the superstars on your team, they think every other NBA player is not talented, and that\u2019s the biggest myth in the world. It takes role players to allow the Kevin Durants and superstars to be them. Take Draymond Green (for example). You take him off Golden State, does the ball move? It might. Do they win? They might. We don\u2019t know, but with Draymond Green on that team, he brings a toughness. You have to respect it. A lot of fans don\u2019t really see that and how big the role players are in the NBA. NBA.com: I\u2019m an Atlanta guy, and I\u2019ve always enjoyed watching Atlanta native Lou Williams. I think he\u2019s one of the most underrated players in the league. Beverley: Yeah, Lou\u2019s like a brother to me. He puts in the work. He kills on the court. I feel like he should be getting so much more credit. I feel like he should be in the All-Star game, especially these past couple years. NBA.com: You two seemed to have developed a great bond. Has he been your favorite teammate so far in the NBA? Beverley: Favorite teammate ever. Ever. Favorite teammate ever. When I came to Atlanta, he was the first person I got up with. We talk about everything, family. He\u2019s like my brother. We\u2019ve spent a lot of time together with the Rockets and Clippers. That\u2019s gonna be a big point this offseason. If I do choose to leave (the Clippers), I\u2019d be leaving him, my brother Lou Will. And that would be tough on me. NBA.com: What do you listen to in the pregame to get you ready? Beverley: Future. Lil Durk. Meek. NBA.com: What\u2019s the next big step for you in your own personal growth as a player? Beverley: Get more comfortable running a team. Working on the midrange and working on my handle a little bit more. Continue do what I do. Be me."},{"id":33817,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/kevin-durant-lebron-james-react-warriors-game-6-win","date":"2019-05-11","title":"Kevin Durant, LeBron James react to Warriors' Game 6 win","content":" The Golden State Warriors are headed to their fifth straight Western Conference finals after knocking out the Houston Rockets in Game 6 on Friday.

He is continuing to do so with his announcement Thursday of a $1 million grant from the Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods Foundation that will build a new gym at the school. James made the announcement at his alma mater, St. Vincent St. Mary High School, saying that the gym at the I Promise School will be used for physical education and after-school activities while also serving as a safe space for children. \u201cTo my kids, this is more than a gym,\u201d James said in a video posted by the Akron Beacon Journal . \u201cThe Dick\u2019s Sports Matter program is helping us provide even more opportunities. An opportunity to play and learn in a safe place that many don\u2019t have access to. I can\u2019t imagine where my friends and I would be if it weren\u2019t for the coaches and teachers who cared about us and the opportunities we had.\u201d The details as to when and the cost of the gym were not included in a news release issued early Friday morning, the Akron Beacon Journal reports . The Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods Foundation was established in 2011 and its Sports Matter Community Grant Program \u2014 launched in 2018 \u2014 benefits high-poverty, local youth sports teams, leagues and schools. The 240-person population of third- and fourth-graders is made up of students \u201cidentified by Akron Public Schools as behind in critical academic areas and other factors.\u201d James insisted last July that his institution be a public school, as he could relate to the pitfalls that Akron youth must face. \u201cI believe the sky is the limit for these kids and the results we\u2019re seeing are just the beginning,\u201d James said Thursday. \u201cDick\u2019s Sporting Goods Foundation believes in the opportunities and values sports provide, and I\u2019ve experienced that at every level. I saw it growing up with my teammates and I see it with my kids now. The benefits of playing sports can extend to every aspect of your life, and I\u2019m excited we\u2019re able to provide a space for that growth at the I Promise School.\u201d The school boasts a 20-to-1 student-teacher ratio, year-round programming and a 9-to-5 school day to keep its children engaged. Understanding the challenges that come with being underprivileged in Akron, the I Promise School also provides all of its students free breakfast, lunch and snack. Bussing is provided for kids who live within two miles, and every child receives a free bike \u2014 something that James said helped kept him out of trouble growing up. The opening of the school also included providing services for the students\u2019 parents, including an on-site food bank and programs that give them the opportunity to earn their GEDs."},{"id":33814,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-lakers-interview-jb-bickerstaff","date":"2019-05-10","title":"Report: Lakers to interview Bickerstaff for coaching vacancy","content":" Former Memphis Grizzlies coach J.B.

He is the second coaching candidate to interview with the team this week, as former Orlando Magic and Indiana Pacers coach Frank Vogel reportedly interviewed with the Lakers on Thursday. A little more than a week ago, the Lakers were thought to be close to reaching a deal with former Cleveland Cavaliers coach Tyronn Lue. However, Lue pulled out of talks with the Lakers for the job, reportedly declined the team\u2019s three-year, $18 million offer to coach there. Per the Los Angeles Times, Bickerstaff was slated to meet with team owner Jeanie Buss, GM Rob Pelinka, co-owners Joey Buss and Jesse Buss, president of basketball operations Tim Harris, director of special projects Linda Rambis and senior advisor Kurt Rambis. The Grizzlies fired Bickerstaff on April 11 after the team missed the playoffs with a 33-49 record. Bickerstaff was named interim coach in November 2017 after the Grizzlies fired David Fizdale. He was given the job without the interim title last May. Aside from his time coaching the Grizzlies, Bickerstaff was also the interim coach of the Houston Rockets after they fired Kevin McHale on Nov. 18, 2015.

After a review, there were offsetting technicals involving Denver\u2019s Will Barton and Torrey Craig, and Seth Curry and Zach Collins for Portland. Barton told The Denver Post the scuffle started when Collins fell into his knee with 6 minutes and 16 seconds left in the quarter.

Yes, he played in The 2018 Finals with the Cleveland Cavaliers, who were on the wrong side of a sweep of the Golden State Warriors. But Hood was in a \u201cdark place\u201d then, a good player but a bad fit on an already established, LeBron James-led team. He was unsure of himself and his role on that team and uncertain of his future and where it might lead. He\u2019s free from that now, playing a vital reserve role for the Portland Trail Blazers while doing whatever he can to help push his team to the conference finals. In doing so, he has the added motivation of proving his previous struggles are a thing of the past. Hood was at his best Thursday night at Moda Center, coming through with a monster game in a 119-108 Game 6 win against the Denver Nuggets in the Western Conference semfinals that staved off elimination. His 25 points helped fuel the Blazers on a night when both Damian Lillard ( 32 points ) and C.J. McCollum ( 30 ) were rolling as well, making certain that this redemptive Blazers\u2019 season extends to Sunday\u2019s Game 7 at Pepsi Center. \u201cThis series I got a matchup I like,\u201d Hood said. \u201cI\u2019m really aggressive, trying to take some pressure off of Dame and C.J. We\u2019ve got one more game to get to get to the Western Conference finals, so we\u2019ve got to keep exploiting different things.\u201d It was Hood, who averaged 3.2 points per game in Blazers\u2019 first round series against Oklahoma City, who Lillard called the \u201cmost consistent\u201d player in this series. Nuggets coach Mike Malone called him the Blazers\u2019 \u201cMVP\u201d Thursday night and acknowledged that the production and energy provided by Hood (and Blazers reserve big man Zach Collins) were the difference in Game 6. \u201cAs well as Damian Lillard played, you can\u2019t speak enough about Rodney Hood,\u201d Malone said. \u201cNot just the impact Rodney had tonight, but the impact he\u2019s had the whole series. So talk about a young man stepping up and taking advantage of a situation in an elimination game. It was a great performance by Rodney Hood. We have to be much better guarding him.\u201d That\u2019s much more attention than was paid to Hood by the Thunder and earlier this season when the Blazers acquired him in a February trade for Nik Stauskas , Wade Baldwin and second-round picks in 2021 and 2023. \u201cWell, I can\u2019t speak to before he got to Portland but in this series, I think he\u2019s bounced back from the Oklahoma City series,\u201d Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. \u201cI think he\u2019s had some favorable matchups and we\u2019ve been able to take advantage of it. He\u2019s shooting with confidence and that just kind of snowballs. I think when you see the ball going in, especially with a scorer like Rodney, it just kind of snowballs a little bit.\u201d Whatever was ailing him before and whatever matchups didn\u2019t favor him in the first round \u2026 that has all changed for Hood now. Not only did he exploit mismatches in Game 6, he showed the aggressiveness that marked his 2017-18 season with the Utah Jazz (when he averaged 16.8 ppg) as things have come to life for Hood at the perfect time. Hood shot 8-for-12 (and 3-for-4 on 3-pointers) with four rebounds and zero turnovers in 32 minutes. For the series, he\u2019s at 16.2 ppg on 60.4 percent shooting and 57.9 percent on 3-pointers. \u201cWe need to watch the game film and see what aspects of the game he hurt us,\u201d said Nuggets center Nikola Jokic. \u201cHe shot 8-for-12, so that\u2019s a really high percentage. Maybe we just need to be aggressive on him and don\u2019t let him pick us apart. He had a lot of wide open shots.\u201d The Blazers\u2019 bench outscored their Nuggets counterparts 42-13, with Hood, Collins (14 points and five blocks in a season-high 29 minutes) and Seth Curry (three points) providing all the production. \u201cThey were great,\u201d McCollum said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been killing the whole series. Rodney\u2019s been exceptional in the midrange, dominating the block and hitting threes. Zach has impeccable timing, he\u2019s going to lead the NBA in blocks in the future, for sure. He\u2019s fearless, can knock down threes can finish at the basket \u2026 he\u2019s giving us a different dynamic.\u201d Hood was the third scorer that Lillard and McCollum so desperately needed to keep the Denver defense honest and make sure the Blazers had a chance to make that their return trip to the Mile High City for Sunday\u2019s Game 7 showdown. \u201cWe know teams are going to try and come and take us out,\u201d Lillard said. \u201cIt\u2019s not as much pressure to score the ball, it\u2019s not as much pressure to make something happen because you\u2019ve got another guy out there with 25 points He\u2019s probably been our most consistent player, game over game, over the course of this series. I feel like all six games, he\u2019s had a good game, so we\u2019re going to need him to continue that in Game 7.\u201d  Hood wanted just a few more minutes to soak up the Game 6 atmosphere before moving on to what looms in Game 7. He left the floor Thursday night to the thunderous chanting of his name from the crowd. It was a far cry from the way he exited Oracle Arena in The 2018 Finals, walking up the emptying stands with his family and out of the public entrance to the building. The disappointment from his time with the Cavaliers seems like a distant memory now, a lifetime ago for a player ready to chase another shot at the conference finals \u2014 this time in a space that works for him. \u201cIt\u2019s just been great,\u201d Hood said of the relocation here from Cleveland and the fit with the Blazers. \u201cSometimes when you make changes, it\u2019s for the better, you\u2019re around a great group of guys who kind of have a personality like me, just want to win, good people. The community is great out here, so it just adds to it. \u201cI give a lot of credit to coach Stotts and his coaching staff for bringing me in, and to a team that was already third or fourth in the West, and enabling me to be a big part of what we\u2019re doing here. It\u2019s for reasons like this, being able to advance as much as we can, so I\u2019m happy coming through for them. And they\u2019ve been great for me.\u201d * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

What has mattered in one game hasn\u2019t mattered in the next. Each team has twice looked dominant, and two games have gone down to the wire. The closest thing to a constant has been the importance of Joel Embiid\u2019s presence on the floor. Never was it more important than in the Sixers\u2019 112-101 victory in Game 6 on Thursday, when Philly outscored Toronto 100-60 in Embiid\u2019s 35 minutes and 33 seconds of playing time and sent the series back to Toronto for a deciding Game 7. Embiid was healthier than he was after suffering through an illness that limited his effectiveness in Games 4 and 5. But his standard box score stats \u2013 17 points, 12 rebounds and two blocks \u2013 were relatively unspectacular. But his plus-40, the highest mark of the postseason , tells the story. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge plus-minus number in a playoff game,\u201d said Sixers coach Brett Brown. \u201cHis significance is felt all over the place.\u201d Single-game plus-minus isn\u2019t always an indicator of a player\u2019s importance. Sometimes, he\u2019s just on the floor when a game swings in a certain direction. But a game-high plus-minus is nothing new for Embiid, who\u2019s now a plus-133 for the playoffs, with no other Sixer better than a plus-94. Game 6 was a game of runs, which had a lot to do with whether or not Embiid was on the floor. After Greg Monroe registered a minus-25 in 16 total minutes over the Sixers\u2019 losses in Games 4 and 5, Brown went to Boban Marjanovic as his backup center in Game 6. Marjanovic, who had only seen garbage-time minutes since registering a minus-22 in less than 12 total minutes over Games 1 and 2, checked in for Embiid with the Sixers up three and 6:58 left in the first quarter. The Raptors then went on a 5-0 run, with all five points being scored at the rim or at the free throw line. The lead was gone and so was Marjanovic, with Embiid checking back in with just two minutes and 23 seconds having elapsed off the clock. And over the final 4:35 of the period, the Sixers outscored the Raptors, 16-6. At the end of the first quarter, Embiid hadn\u2019t scored a point, but he was a plus-13 in a game his team led by eight. \u201cHis presence,\u201d said Raptors coach Nick Nurse, \u201cwas a lot more than his baskets tonight.\u201d The Sixers went up by 19 early in the second quarter. But with the lead at 17, Marjanovic checked back in for Embiid at the 8:09 mark. And this time, he didn\u2019t even last as long as he did in the first quarter. The Raptors scored on five of their next six possessions (a stretch that included two dunks and a layup), Brown called a timeout, and Embiid was back on the floor with just two minutes and 10 seconds having elapsed. \u201cThat was a hard four minutes for Boban,\u201d Brown said. \u201cI felt like we pivoted out of it quickly.\u201d Marjanovic didn\u2019t play again until garbage time. Mike Scott was the backup center in the second half, but that didn\u2019t help much. With the Raptors going on another quick, 5-0 run (starting with a dunk from Kawhi Leonard), Embiid\u2019s first third-quarter stint on the bench lasted only a minute and two seconds. Through six games, the Sixers have outscored the Raptors by 21 points per 100 possessions in Embiid\u2019s 192 minutes on the floor and have been outscored by 46 points per 100 possessions in his 96 minutes off the floor. Embiid\u2019s impact is obvious. On offense, he\u2019s been drawing double-teams, setting impactful screens, and drawing loose-ball fouls on the glass. \u201cYou can see it on pick-and-rolls,\u201d Embiid said. \u201cMarc is not helping off of me. They\u2019re really stuck to me and every time I put it on on the floor or every time I have the ball, they just collapse.\u201d On defense, he has essentially scared the Raptors from scoring near the basket. With Embiid on the floor in the series, the Raptors have shot 59 percent in the restricted area, where they\u2019ve taken 23 percent of their shots. With Embiid off the floor, those numbers rise to 80 percent and 28 percent , respectively. \u201cYou\u2019re conscious of where he\u2019s at on the floor,\u201d Kyle Lowry said. \u201cWhen he\u2019s out there, he\u2019s a big body. He\u2019s a force on both ends.\u201d Still, the on-off swings in Game 6 were rather remarkable. There\u2019s certainly some noise in that plus-40 mark. The Raptors\u2019 bigs got some open looks from the outside on Thursday, but Marc Gasol and Serge Ibaka combined to shoot 0-for-6 from beyond the arc. If a couple of those go in, this story might be about Jimmy Butler and Ben Simmons, who combined for 46 points, 14 assists and just two turnovers. Butler capped off a 19-point first half with two buckets and a strip of Leonard in the final 11 seconds. Simmons, meanwhile, registered nine buckets in the restricted area (one shy of his career high), thanks to a relentless attack and four offensive rebounds. As they head back to Toronto for Game 7, the Sixers still have to figure out what to do when Embiid goes to the bench. \u201cWho is the eighth man?\u201d Brown asked. \u201cIt\u2019s not clear.\u201d It may be that there is no eighth man, that Brown just extends the minutes of his best players, and he tries to buy a few minutes with Scott at center. Brown certainly didn\u2019t hesitate to bring Embiid back quicker than usual with the Sixers\u2019 season on the line in Game 6, and Embiid says he\u2019s ready for whatever\u2019s needed on Sunday. \u201cIt\u2019s the playoffs,\u201d Embiid said. \u201cI got to play. If I got to play 45 minutes and push myself out there, that\u2019s what I got to do. If that\u2019s what it takes to win, if my presence on the court is needed, I got to be there. It doesn\u2019t matter if it takes the whole game. I\u2019m fine with it. I got to keep on pushing myself. In Game 7, we\u2019re going to need it. I\u2019m going to need to be on the court and I intend to be ready for everything if I have to play a whole game.\u201d We don\u2019t know what\u2019s coming in Sunday\u2019s Game 7 ( 7 ET, TNT ). But Embiid will be on the floor, and that may be the most important thing. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

Steve Kerr won\u2019t have Kevin Durant, who \u2014 in Kerr\u2019s widely-shared opinion \u2014 \u201chas been the best player in the NBA in these playoffs\u201d for the rest of this series. Yet with Durant ailing with a strained calf muscle , the Warriors haven\u2019t been stripped completely bare on the floor or, just as important, on their fingers, which are decorated with bling and the credibility that goes with it. \u201cWe know the challenge ahead is a big one,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cBut they\u2019re champions and I think there\u2019s an advantage to having championship experience. This group will never be doubted.\u201d The Warriors bring a 3-2 series lead, the comfort of knowing a potential Game 7 would be in Oakland, and a proven core led by Stephen Curry. Still, beating the Rockets without Durant is the steepest roadblock in this Kerr dynasty. He\u2019s that good of a player, obviously, and the Rockets with James Harden are that much of a threat. That said, the Warriors faced a pair of elimination games three years ago against Durant and his erstwhile Oklahoma City teammates. Then Klay Thompson went scorched earth with 41 points in Game 6 of the Western Conference finals. That effort was followed by a collective Golden State showing in the clincher a few nights later. And the Warriors did trail the Rockets 3-2 last season , but Chris Paul missed the final two games with a hamstring pull and Golden State seized the opportunity . Still, the task at hand represents a bind for the two-time defending champions. Durant has served as a security blanket throughout these playoffs, while Curry and Thompson have struggled with their shot in this series , especially from 3-point range. Whenever the Warriors needed bailing out, Durant usually came through with smashing results. Now, that high-level insurance will be missing from this series and perhaps a portion of the Western Conference finals (if the Warriors advance). The MRI on Durant\u2019s calf showed a strain and he didn\u2019t travel to Houston. He had a similar injury last season and missed nearly two weeks. All this makes for a throwback challenge for the Warriors, to see if they can muster the same amount of production at both ends as they did before Durant arrived. Those results earned them two trips to the NBA Finals, one championship and a record-setting 73-win season . \u201cHe\u2019s had (this injury) before and he\u2019s responded well,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cWe\u2019re disappointed he won\u2019t be able to play in this series, but if we can win the series and move on it will look good for his return in the near future.\u201d Kerr is citing the past in order to rouse his team\u2019s confidence, although the present doesn\u2019t exactly equal the past. For starters, Andre Iguodala, Shaun Livingston and Andrew Bogut were all younger and friskier. Of the three, only Iguodala is flourishing , and only to a degree. With Durant out, the Warriors will lean on Iguodala to play more minutes and be more active in looking for his shot. Livingston\u2019s role in the rotation is diminished and Bogut is virtually out of it. Speaking of the bench, it\u2019s weaker than before, when the Warriors had Marreese Speights, Leandro Barbosa and others. That means Kerr will press his role players for more \u2014 can they deliver, especially in such a heightened situation? \u201cWe\u2019ll just find somebody on the bench who can give us 35 points, two blocks and 10 boards,\u201d Kerr wisecracked. \u201cObviously it\u2019s a huge loss, but our team has a lot of confidence. We trust each other. We\u2019ve won championships together, so we come out and give it our best shot. \u201cWe\u2019ll try to mix and match some lineups and find contributions where we haven\u2019t had them in this series. Guys who haven\u2019t had the opportunity will get it. Yes, it\u2019ll be a little different, but no reason why we can\u2019t go get a win. It\u2019s about finding the right rotations and combinations and getting enough minutes for our core guys to get some rest.\u201d For certain, the Warriors can\u2019t afford any of the mainstays \u2014 Curry, Thompson, Draymond Green \u2014 to falter. They\u2019ll be asked to play in the 40-minute range and must avoid foul trouble while fighting against fatigue. Assuming that Harden seeks to make amends for disappearing in the fourth quarter of Game 5 and goes iso all night, would it be unreasonable to say the Warriors will require a combined 60 points from Curry and Thompson? \u201cWe obviously turn to Steph to generate much of our offense,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cIt\u2019s not that we\u2019ve gone away from that over the years. It\u2019s just with Kevin, we have a weapon and we sort of mixed in different styles and different offensive starting points. The one good thing is we do have experience for when before Kevin was here, with Steph, Klay, Draymond, Andre, Shaun, those core guys. We\u2019ve been successful. That\u2019s not to say it\u2019s the same as a few years ago but we\u2019re comfortable that we can be successful with that group.\u201d All season, Kerr has sung the praises of Kevin Looney, the Warriors\u2019 developing young power forward. Looney repaid that faith Wednesday by taming Rockets menace PJ Tucker and making plays in the closing moments that contributed to the win after Durant left. Looney might now get starter\u2019s minutes, which could allow his flaws surface. As always, eliminating a team in its own building is a heavy-lifting circumstance. \u201cWe\u2019re in a great spot,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cWe\u2019re up, 3-2, and bringing championship rings on our fingers and a lot of confidence that comes with that. This group has nothing to prove so there\u2019s a freedom that comes with it. We\u2019re obviously being hit with injuries which is part of it, one of the reasons why it\u2019s so hard to win a championship. They generally happen to every team at some point. This is the hardest we\u2019ve been hit.\u201d No time for self-pity though. The Warriors get two chances to win one, and it could be the hardest \u201cone\u201d they\u2019ve seen, at least in these playoffs. \u201cThe challenge is here right in front of our guys,\u201d Kerr said, \u201cand all we have to win is one game.\u201d * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

(AP) \u2014  The Golden State Warriors will be without postseason scoring leader Kevin Durant as they try to close out the Houston Rockets in the Western Conference semifinals. \u201cWell, we\u2019ll just find somebody on the bench who can give us 35 points and two blocks and 11 boards and nine assists,\u201d coach Steve Kerr said once the team arrived back in Houston on Thursday evening. An MRI exam Thursday confirmed the Warriors\u2019 initial diagnosis of a strained right calf announced during Wednesday\u2019s 104-99 win at Oracle Arena. As the Warriors returned to Houston for Friday\u2019s Game 6 ( 9 ET, ESPN ), Durant stayed behind in the Bay Area to undergo treatment. He is scheduled to be re-evaluated next week, meaning if there is a decisive Game 7 in the series Sunday he would be out of that one as well. The Warriors lead the series 3-2. \u201cHe\u2019s been the best player in the NBA, in the playoffs. He\u2019s been phenomenal, so it\u2019s obviously a huge loss, but our team has a lot of confidence,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cThey trust each other. They\u2019ve won championships together.

Guys will get opportunities who haven\u2019t had an opportunity yet. It\u2019ll be a little different. But no reason why we can\u2019t go get a win.\u201d Durant limped to the locker room after landing awkwardly on his right foot following a baseline jumper with 2:11 left in the third quarter Wednesday. The Warriors initially feared the two-time reigning NBA Finals MVP might have injured his Achilles, a far more serious issue. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough injury,\u201d teammate Klay Thompson said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to collectively make up for what he does. We\u2019ve done it before. It\u2019s going to be incredibly difficult. It\u2019s the playoffs. I know they\u2019re not going to feel sorry for us, the media, the fans. It will be a gut check time. We go down there and give it our best effort. That\u2019s all we can do. If we do that, I have confidence every man on this team will step up in his absence. We wish him a speedy recovery because we\u2019re not the same team without him.\u201d Durant, who leads all postseason scorers at 34.2 points per game, finished with 22 points, five rebounds and four assists in 32 minutes. Golden State has been without injured stars like Durant, Stephen Curry, Draymond Green or Thompson in big games before. The Warriors coaching staff planned to use the flight to reconfigure rotations for Game 6 without Durant, and Kerr said, \u201cI have a pretty good feeling for it, but I\u2019m not about to share it with you or anybody else other than our team.\u201d . \u201cAny time you see something like that, it\u2019s scary,\u201d Curry said after the game. \u201cYou could see the look on his face. He didn\u2019t really understand what was happening in that moment, trying to figure it out, went straight back to the locker room. During the timeout, we all looked at each other. There were a couple smiles in terms of what that meant for us as a team, the guys that were going to need to step up in those moments. Again, next-man-up mentality. Draymond said that at some point during that timeout. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to remove yourself from thinking about your teammate and your brother as he\u2019s back in the locker room getting checked out. But we were able to lock back in and just find a way to win the game. Now we can regroup and understand whatever the situation is going forward.\u201d Kevon Looney will certainly play more minutes as he did Wednesday. The big man grabbed nine rebounds, five on the offensive glass, to provide a big boost off the bench. \u201cWe\u2019re still really positive,\u201d Looney said. \u201cOur team\u2019s been battle-tested, we\u2019ve had to play without key guys before so whatever happens, happens. We\u2019re ready and we\u2019re confident that we have enough to win.\u201d"},{"id":33815,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-lakers-interview-frank-vogel","date":"2019-05-09","title":"Report: Lakers to interview Vogel for coaching job","content":" LOS ANGELES  (AP) \u2014 A person familiar with the search says Frank Vogel will be interviewed for the Lakers head coach opening.

In an appearance Thursday for The Economic Club of Washington, D.C., Silver said two of the past five refs added from the developmental G League were women, bringing the total number of female officials to three. \u201cIt\u2019s an area, frankly, where I\u2019ve acknowledged that I\u2019m not sure how it was that it remained so male-dominated for so long. Because it\u2019s an area of the game where physically, certainly, there\u2019s no benefit to being a man, as opposed to a woman, when it comes to refereeing,\u201d Silver said. \u201cThe goal is: Going forward, it should be roughly 50-50 of new officials entering in the league,\u201d he said. \u201cSame for coaches, by the way. We have a program, too. There\u2019s no reason why women shouldn\u2019t be coaching men\u2019s basketball.\u201d There has never been a female head coach in the NBA. Becky Hammon of the San Antonio Spurs was the league\u2019s first full-time female assistant. Kristi Toliver worked as an assistant coach for the Washington Wizards this season; she also still plays for the WNBA\u2019s Mystics in the same city. In December, the Indiana Pacers made Kelly Krauskopf the first woman to hold the title of assistant general manager in the NBA. Among the other topics he was asked about Thursday was the NBA\u2019s one-and-done rule, and Silver reiterated that he has changed his stance on the issue and is willing to let 18-year-old players enter the league. \u201cI have changed my position. It\u2019s a tough one, because not all the teams agree with me on this,\u201d Silver said, estimating that about half of the league\u2019s clubs are in favor of the switch. He said the NBA and the players\u2019 union are \u201cin active discussions\u201d about that policy and he said any change probably wouldn\u2019t happen before the 2022 season.

And it\u2019s arguably more frustrating that it\u2019s an illness, rather than a recurring knee issue, that\u2019s the primary problem with Joel Embiid. Embiid scored just 24 total points, with more turnovers (10) than field goals (eight) as the Sixers dropped Games 4 and 5 of their Eastern Conference semifinals series against the Toronto Raptors. The Sixers\u2019 season is now on the line as they host Game 6, with no clear indication that they\u2019ll have a full-strength Embiid. \u201cIt\u2019s not ideal,\u201d Sixers coach Brett Brown said of Embiid\u2019s illness. Though Embiid and Ben Simmons are just 25 and 22 years old, respectively, the Sixers went for it this season. They traded for Jimmy Butler and Tobias Harris, who will both have the choice to leave via free agency this summer. Their new starting lineup has been dominant, but it\u2019s played just 19 games together and it may be their old starting lineup after Thursday because of a microorganism that found it\u2019s way into Embiid\u2019s body. Game 6 will be the first in which either team is facing elimination. For the Sixers, the questions go beyond Embiid\u2019s health. Thursday night will be a test of their cohesion, their toughness and their buy-in. Excuses don\u2019t go very far at this time of year, though. The Sixers knew the risks when they traded two rotation players to Minnesota for Butler and when they sent two first round picks and Landry Shamet to the Clippers for Harris. When the playoffs arrive, one player (like Kawhi Leonard) can get hot, another player (Harris) can go cold, someone (Embiid) can get sick or injured, and a regular-season star with a fatal flaw in his game (Simmons) can be neutralized. Of course, the Sixers\u2019 season isn\u2019t over. It was just a couple of games ago that the Raptors looked like the more flawed team with shooters that had gone cold. The Sixers won Game 2 in Toronto with Embiid limited due to a stomach issue. The Raptors may have found themselves on Tuesday \u2014 \u201cWe have so much confidence right now,\u201d Serge Ibaka said after Game 5 \u2014 but every game of this series has been very different from the other four. Have the Sixers had enough time together to believe in one another with their season on the line? Are the players as all-in as the front office? The Sixers have looked fantastic when everything is clicking ( see Game 3 ), but can they play from behind? Brown believes they\u2019re good in that regard. \u201cFor a team that hasn\u2019t been with each other that long,\u201d he said Wednesday, \u201cthere\u2019s a resiliency, there\u2019s a togetherness that contradicts what the calendar says we have spent together.\u201d Game 5 provided an opportunity for the Sixers to show some of that resiliency. But after Toronto took the lead for good late in the first quarter, there was no response from Philadelphia. The Sixers will be at home on Thursday and a focus will be on the first quarter to see what kind of fight they have (and whether the Raptors can weather a potential storm). There has been one constant through the five games of this series: The winner of the first quarter has won all five. \u201cI think we\u2019ve got to expect a tremendous amount of energy from them from the jump,\u201d Raptors coach Nick Nurse said Wednesday. \u201cI think that always starts with trying to get your defense set up. They\u2019re going to want to try to get up the floor and beat your defense down the floor. Simmons is going to push, I\u2019m sure, to try to get himself involved in the transition game.\u201d Our first indication of where things are going could come with the Sixers\u2019 first few offensive possessions. Is Embiid willing to get in the paint and to the basket? If he catches the ball as a trail man, does he settle for a jump shot, would he prefer to hand off the ball to one of his teammates, or does he back Marc Gasol down to the block and go to work? An ill Embiid is probably better than no Embiid at all. In this series, the Sixers have outscored Toronto by 40 points in his 157 minutes on the floor and have been outscored by an amazing 68 points in his 83 minutes on the bench . And his impact has come on both ends of the floor . Game 5 was the first time Embiid registered a negative plus-minus since Game 1 of the first round. Before we get to a fascinating offseason in the Atlantic Division, we have another fascinating elimination game to play. On Wednesday, the Boston Celtics couldn\u2019t get it together to save their season. On Thursday, the Sixers will be the team under the microscope. \u201cWe have a prideful team,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be just fine if we can walk down and do the things we know we can do. There\u2019s no dent to our spirit. There\u2019s no self pity, we\u2019re excited to get back and get ready to play again.\u201d * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

It\u2019s time. Heck, it\u2019s way past due. This isn\u2019t a situation like in 1985, when there was a great hue and cry over New York \u201csuspiciously\u201d landing the No. 1 pick in the inaugural lottery to use on Patrick Ewing. Back then, the Knicks at least had made the playoffs six times in the 11 years after their 1973 NBA championship. Now they have made the playoffs just six times in the 20 years since Ewing\u2019s departure from New York. I\u2019m not saying ownership or management at Madison Square Garden is set up to maximize, hmm, Zion Williamson\u2019s impact. But the fans have paid plenty by now for the team\u2019s sins and\/or fumbling. Getting the top pick also might attract an elite free agent or two. It\u2019s the merciful thing to seek. John Schuhmann :  There\u2019s no need to root for anybody. It would be fun to see an explosive, young forward in Atlanta alongside the already promising duo of Trae Young and John Collins. But the winner of the Lottery when it happens doesn\u2019t always look like the winner of the Draft five years later. The league should be pretty happy with the amount and diversity of talent it has right now, no matter where that talent happens to be playing.  Sekou Smith :  The \u201cNBA\u201d shouldn\u2019t be rooting for anything. There are enough conspiracy theorists out there already. No need to fuel that fire. Since we all know that Zion Williamson is the surefire No. 1 pick in the Draft, we should probably be rooting for whatever is the best landing spot for the young jumping jack. And that\u2019s in Atlanta, on the receiving end of pretty passes from Trae Young as often as humanly possible. Zion and John Collins together would be an absolute freak show. And while I understand this notion of wanting the biggest stars in the biggest markets, enough already. Dwight Howard (Orlando) and LeBron James (Cleveland, twice) have shown us that you can be the biggest star in this league from basically anywhere, provided you are the right kind of superstar. Let Atlanta see if Zion is that right kind of superstar."},{"id":33839,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-has-kyrie-irving-played-last-game-celtics","date":"2019-05-09","title":"Blogtable: Has Irving played his last game with the Celtics?","content":"* * * Do you think Kyrie Irving has played his last game with the Boston Celtics?   * * * Steve Aschburner :  He is outta there. This is one of those rare occasions when a perennial All-Star might leave a team and the guy\u2019s teammates \u2014 and their fans \u2014 might pack his bags and drive him to the airport. This is a bad fit in need of a breakup. That\u2019s more on Irving than it is on the Celtics or the folks at TD Garden because he\u2019s the one who wanted to drive his own team. And crafting a \u201cteam\u201d is what at least some of the $20 million annually is supposed to buy. Irving\u2019s ego might not like reading this, but he should not be the No. 1 guy for any franchise with legitimate championship aspirations. John Schuhmann :  Irving\u2019s departure this summer certainly feels a lot more likely than it did six months ago. But Irving could tell us right now what he\u2019s planning to do on July 1 and I probably wouldn\u2019t believe him. It\u2019s also valid to wonder if the Celtics want him back given the disappointment of this season, the lack of cohesion the team showed on both ends of the floor, and Irving\u2019s handling of his \u201cleadership\u201d responsibilities. There\u2019s baggage that comes with some of this year\u2019s free agents, and there are obviously teams that will be desperate enough for the talent upgrade that they\u2019ll be willing to take on that baggage.  Sekou Smith :  I\u2019m guessing, based on the way things ended, that he has indeed played his last game in a Celtics uniform. I\u2019d hate to see the results of a Celtics fan poll asking if they want Kyrie back, because I don\u2019t think it would be pretty. Boston\u2019s youngsters, who looked ready to take on the world last season when Kyrie and Gordon Hayward were out with injuries during the playoffs, never showed up with the veteran stars healthy this time around. I don\u2019t know if you can put it all on Kyrie and Hayward. But they\u2019re the only significant difference from one season to the next. Kyrie\u2019s never seemed like a great fit in Boston.

Everyone knows who Giannis Antetokounmpo is. But not everyone notices how frequently this team adds to its leads when Antetokounmpo is on the bench, at least in these playoffs. During the regular season, Milwaukee was 9.7 points better, per 100 possessions, when \u201cThe Greek Freak\u201d was on the floor. During this postseason? The Bucks are 10.3 points better when Antetokounmpo sits down . Now, those playoff on\/off numbers are 11.4 vs. 21.7, so it\u2019s hard to go wrong either way. Small sample size, but it indicates how well the reserves are playing, how much coach Mike Budenholzer and GM Jon Horst have cultivated this bench and how effectively these guys play in whatever combination they need. John Schuhmann : Giannis Antetokounmpo can\u2019t not be the most impressive thing about the Bucks, but the most noteworthy aspect of Milwaukee\u2019s postseason thus far is the play of their bench . While other teams have been forced to shorten their rotations because some reserves have been disappointing (or downright unplayable) in the playoffs, the Bucks have had some reserves play better than they did in the regular season. George Hill\u2019s regular season\u2019s contributions were rather minimal, but he was huge in the conference semis, averaging 15.5 points on 62 percent shooting over the Bucks\u2019 four wins. Pat Connaughton, meanwhile, has given them some important rebounding and floor spacing. And the Bucks have outscored their opponents by more than 21 points per 100 possessions with Hill and Connaughton on the floor together. Now, they\u2019ve added more depth with the return of Malcolm Brogdon,.  Sekou Smith :  The most impressive thing about the Bucks\u2019 8-1 postseason run is that, save for Game 1 against the Boston Celtics, they treated each and every other game the same way. They didn\u2019t show the Celtics any more respect than they did the Detroit Pistons in that first round sweep. That\u2019s the mark of a champion, a team willing to disregard the opposition completely in its quest to win 16 games and bring home a Larry O\u2019Brien Trophy. Like most everyone else, I needed to see if what the Bucks did during the regular season would translate to the postseason. And the overmatched Pistons couldn\u2019t provide the evidence needed in the first round. Punishing the Celtics the way they did, though, speaks to me in a completely different manner."},{"id":33891,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/warriors-win-game-5-durant-injury-impact","date":"2019-05-09","title":"Warriors take Game 5, but future of series likely hinges on Durant","content":"OAKLAND, Calif. \u2014 In Game 5 of the 2018 Western Conference finals , Chris Paul grabbed his hamstring and limped off. The Houston Rockets managed to win anyway to go up 3-2, but he was finished and the Rockets dropped the next two games and the series to the Golden State Warriors. In Game 5 of the Western Conference semifinals last night, Kevin Durant grabbed his right calf in Game 5 and limped off . The Warriors managed to win anyway, 104-99, to go up 3-2 , but he is \u2026 well, let\u2019s see where he and this series goes from here. Once again, a non-contact injury to a significant player casts a spell on Rockets vs. Warriors, throwing everything for a loop. It\u2019s all about the recovery powers of Durant, whose right calf strain was placed on the clock 48 hours before a looming Game 6 in Houston, with an MRI pending before the team plane leaves Oakland. Update: Durant to miss remainder of semifinals after MRI confirms calf strain He wore a limp and an empty expression after the game, obviously concerned and certainly confused. He was hoping he didn\u2019t play his final game of this series or, worst case scenario, in a Warriors\u2019 uniform (Durant will be a free agent this summer). Sure, this isn\u2019t as ominous as Paul\u2019s hamstring which instantly shut him down for the summer . He missed three games last year with the same injury, although the severity won\u2019t necessarily be identical. For the Warriors, this is a hope-for-the-best, prepare-for-the-worst situation. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to find a way,\u201d said coach Steve Kerr. \u201cHe\u2019s been on this incredible playoff run. Hopefully we can do enough to win one more game in this series. That\u2019s the plan.\u201d As painful as it was for Durant when he winced after drilling a 3-pointer, the real ache was experienced by the Rockets, who blew a chance to win and close out the series at home. Tied after three quarters and no Durant, the elements that the Rockets showed in the previous two games, both wins, turned to vapor. There was no grit, no furious 3-point response and curiously no James Harden, who shockingly took just three shots in the quarter for a quiet five points and never seized the moment. PJ Tucker stepped on the line while hitting a 3-pointer. Paul had his shot blocked by Kevon Looney. And Harden chose to defer when, up until this point in this series, his foot stayed on the accelerator. If the Rockets lose this series, they will rue the fourth quarter where they didn\u2019t attack or reach for the jugular of a Warriors\u2019 team that played at a major disadvantage. \u201cI don\u2019t think we relaxed,\u201d Paul said. \u201cIt was just a few big plays. You know what I mean?\u201d It was one of the biggest quarters of the Kerr era, considering the circumstances. They asked Stephen Curry to bail them out and he did so, looking not quite as deadly as he was prior to Durant\u2019s arrival in 2016 when he carried the Warriors, but good enough. \u201cI think you saw Steph go into a different mode when Kevin went out,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cHe knew things were going to run through him. He was brilliant when we absolutely needed him.\u201d Curry had 12 of his 25 points in the fourth quarter , with Klay Thompson assisting with seven. Durant replacement Looney was uplifting, getting sneaky with a key offensive rebound (which he passed to Thompson for a 3-pointer), blocked shot and steal in the closing moments. Even Jonas Jerebko hit a critical 3-pointer. The Warriors somehow managed to pull it off \u2014 thank you very much, Rockets \u2014 but now the intrigue begins. \u201cIf Kevin is out, then what you saw in the fourth quarter is what you\u2019re going to have to see going forward,\u201d Kerr said. They\u2019ll certainly lean on Curry, who won a pair of Kia MVPs prior to Durant and is one of the greatest shooters in history, although you wonder if his knees might buckle. Curry hasn\u2019t lifted his game all postseason and has lapsed in and out of a case of the shooting yips. Even in the early moments Wednesday, he whiffed on three layups and didn\u2019t score his first basket until the second quarter. For his career, Curry\u2019s impact in the postseason hasn\u2019t matched his regular season impact. In this series, Curry is shooting 26.3 percent on 3-pointers , abysmal for him. But because Durant has been scorching \u2014 averaging 33.2 points per game against the Rockets \u2014 Curry\u2019s miscues have only been mildly irritating. \u201cWe trust the man,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cEverybody in this world trusts him with the ball in his hands. His track record has proven it. He\u2019s coming up in the clutch.\u201d Additionally, Thompson can\u2019t afford the dry spells that plagued his first four games of this series. Thompson managed to break out of the fog with a strong first half Wednesday, disappeared in the third before rising again in the fourth. The Warriors will need more than just Curry to compensate for Durant\u2019s scoring. \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating when you don\u2019t play up to your standards,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cI\u2019m never going to waver with my confidence when it comes to shooting. That\u2019s what got me to this point. Just want to be aggressive from the jump and make the right play. It\u2019s that simple.\u201d The pre-Durant Warriors won two titles, 73 games in a season and reached three NBA Finals. But this isn\u2019t pre-2017. Andre Iguodala\u2019s age is up and production is slightly down. Andrew Bogut is on the bench. And speaking of which, this bench is weaker (with no David West or Leandro Barbosa). Understand that the tightness of this series places an urgency on both teams to produce at a high level, or else. There hasn\u2019t been a blowout win by either team and Game 5 was decided much like the previous four \u2014 by three or four plays that swung the outcome. \u201cThis series has been a battle,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cEach game, such little margin for error. We know we\u2019re going to have to be near perfect down (in Houston) without Kevin and win a game. It\u2019s going to be hard.\u201d Can the Warriors keep it close without Durant for four quarters, assuming he\u2019s a no-go for Friday? Do they have a choice? \u201cWe have to collectively make up for what he does,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cWe\u2019ve done it before. It\u2019s going to be incredibly difficult. I know (the Rockets) aren\u2019t going to feel sorry for us, or the media or the fans. It will be gut check time. We go down there and give it our best effort. If we do that, I have confidence every man on this team will step up in his absence.\u201d When Durant signed as a free agent with the Warriors in the summer of 2016, it caused ripples of annoyance throughout the league. Here was an NBA champion that came a game from winning another title and then added an MVP in his prime. The jealousy and fear was not unfounded as the Warriors have led a charmed life ever since. They ripped through two more titles and lost only one Finals game with Durant, who won back-to-back Finals MVPs. But if they must proceed the rest of this series without Durant, compassion isn\u2019t something they can expect. Because for the Warriors, who bring the \u201cSplash Brothers,\u201d Draymond Green and plenty of championship experience, they know the deal. They know what Durant, once seen as an added luxury, means to their mix. \u201cWe\u2019re not the same team without him,\u201d Thompson said. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

This guy\u2019s ceiling, that guy\u2019s floor. One team\u2019s giddy success, the other team\u2019s dismal failure. When a playoff series ends as swiftly and decisively as the Milwaukee Bucks\u2019 ouster of the Boston Celtics from the Eastern Conference semifinals ,  there\u2019s a rush to assign credit and blame. And yes, it\u2019s a zero sum game. So there is going to be math on this test. How much of what transpired in the Bucks\u2019 4-1 series victory in the best-of-seven series was a testament to their performance and overall season, which will continue next week against either Toronto or Philadelphia ? How much was it about the Celtics shrinking in the moment, snuffing a largely unsatisfying year with the most bitter aftertaste possible? Is 51\/49 a copout as an assessment of liability? That\u2019s the breakdown that springs to mind, at least this mind, with the Bucks getting the extra couple points as a nod to the positives of winning. There was much to praise, and nearly as much to bury. Let\u2019s start with the disappointing yin and get to the effervescent yang later. Boston brought so much baggage into this season, it\u2019s hard to send the Celtics off into summer without dwelling on the gaps between what was supposed to be and what was. No, they didn\u2019t make good as the team most likely to replace Cleveland atop the East and as the conference\u2019s Finals rep. No, the return of Kyrie Irving and Gordon Hayward \u2013 max-contract players missing from the postseason festivities last spring \u2013 didn\u2019t make a difference. Unless the difference was downward. Boston went from Game 7 in the conference finals last spring to just five in the semifinals this time. The Celtics showcased a somnambulant regular season as if they were a veteran contender pacing themselves until the money games began. Except that, that\u2019s not what they were. They were a young team, a team that underwent significant changes to its lineup and rotation, a team that needed each and every one of those 82 lab sessions to develop chemistry and assorted intangibles. It didn\u2019t help that speculation about New Orleans star Anthony Davis\u2019 eventual whereabouts got stirred into a pot of Boston rumors with its own players\u2019 futures. Point guard Kyrie Irving, in particular, might have played his last game in a Celtics uniform, finally arriving at the great uncertainty that hung his entire season. After another dreadful shooting performance Wednesday at Fiserv Forum \u2013 6-for-21, boosting Irving to 25-of-84 in Boston\u2019s four consecutive defeats \u2013 Irving was as distant and glum as if he\u2019d just learned his contract option was the Celtics\u2019, not his. \u201cYou take your lessons and the ass-whooping they handed us and you move on,\u201d Irving said. \u201cFor the rest of my career, I\u2019ll never forget something like this. The taste of feeling defeat and this type of style, I haven\u2019t felt [losing in five games]. For me, it\u2019s just moving on to the next thing and seeing where it ends up.\u201d Ya think? Irving has had one foot in, one foot out the door all season. That not only stymies the hopes of President of Basketball Operations Danny Ainge, who, by all accounts, wishes to team Irving with Davis, but it also dragged a cloud over what they all might have accomplished in the here and now. Even bigger than the one Irving generated in this year\u2019s Bucks series by playing in it. \u201cThere\u2019s no question,\u201d Celtics coach Brad Stevens said when asked if the distractions did, in fact, distract his players. \u201cThey have TVs, they have phones. They hear everything. When you live in it, you do your best to kind of black out the noise and focus on what you can control. But these guys are also young men. There\u2019s a lot of pressure to live up to all these expectations.\u201d Stevens vowed his team will learn from all the issues with which it struggled, such as taking 93 shots to score 91 points (the Celtics shot 29 of 93, missing 32 of their 39 from the arc). And repeatedly getting shredded by not just the big names in Milwaukee\u2019s starting lineup, but also by the role players off its bench. Reserves such as George Hill, Pat Connaughton and Ersan Ilyasova contributed so admirably in the series, coach Mike Budenholzer had some trouble finding guys who qualified for the garbage minutes. Whereas Boston\u2019s offseason began immediately, Milwaukee\u2019s impressive postseason rolls on. The Celtics were co-conspirators in their demise, but Milwaukee\u2019s defense and depth exploited every flaw in and failing of its foe. Irving groused that the Bucks constantly made body contact to mess with his game. Stevens lauded \u2013 and sounded very covetous of \u2013 their habits that \u201cshowed up over and over again.\u201d Said the Celtics\u2019 coach: \u201cWe make a teaching tape every year for our teams about different things \u2013 close-outs, recovering, flying around \u2013 and the Bucks are going to be on a lot of clips.\u201d Stevens, a darling among some in the NBA media who has dodged criticism in the opinion of others, didn\u2019t let himself off the hook for the belated sweep. In addition to stating that the Bucks are better than his team, Stevens added: \u201cI did a bad job. As a coach, if your team doesn\u2019t find your best fit together, that\u2019s on you.\u201d By the end of 240 minutes spread across 10 days, the critical difference between  the two teams was this: Boston has a talented roster, while Milwaukee has a team. There\u2019s a pecking order, a togetherness, a selflessness, all the things that showed themselves only for as long as the first-round series against Indiana and Game 1 against the Bucks lasted. The habits to which the Celtics reverted from Game 2 and beyond were at the far end of the scale from Milwaukee\u2019s. Budenholzer spoke at length before tipoff about his team\u2019s personality. It\u2019s easy for teams that win to have great chemistry, but it\u2019s special when the bonds within a team generate the success. \u201cThe chemistry that this group has has been cooking in the oven since the summer,\u201d Budenholzer said. \u201cGetting together for non-mandatory type workouts, different places working with coaches, working together through the month of September and open-gym environments and preseason. So if you put it in that context, all of that was happening before there was a single win.\u201d Unlike Boston, too, Milwaukee was deadly serious about the regular season. Its most notable achievement \u2013 only once losing two games in a row \u2013 became a driving factor that paid off after the loss that opened this series. \u201cThe most important thing about this team is after Game 1, I got a text from this guy \u2013 [Eric] Bledsoe \u2013 saying that, \u2018We\u2019ve got these guys,\u2019\u201d Giannis Antetokounmpo shared. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what happened. Once your teammates are all on the same page \u2013 you have their back, they have your back \u2013 things like this are gonna happen.\u201d * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

That was an era that valued pass-first players at the point and Lucas defined such a role, although the game was by far the domain of the big man and size was paramount. When the Rockets made Lucas the choice, legendary Celtics boss Red Auerbach exclaimed: \u201cA point guard No. 1? What\u2019s this league coming to?\u201d Lucas\u2019 stint in Houston would initially be short and later repeated twice more, as he fell prey to substance abuse, became a journeyman and saw his career constantly interrupted. Although he played 14 years total , he became more known for flunking two drug tests and being released in March of 1986, the year the Rockets reached the NBA Finals. Lucas was averaging 15.5 points, 8.8 assists and 1.2 steals as a starter in what was perhaps his finest season before the plug was pulled. Rather than become a statistic, Lucas salvaged what was left of his career; at age 33 he averaged 17.5 points for the Bucks. After retirement, he devoted his life to helping other athletes overcome abuse and addiction or other issues: Ty Lawson, Tyrann Matthieu, the late Roy Tarpley and Mitchell Wiggins, the father of Andrew Wiggins, among others. He made Houston his base for that, and became a mentor for talented yet troubled souls. Eventually, he formed a company that also helped train young players for college and professional ball a made a name for himself in Houston basketball circles. Lucas also had three stints as a coach, first with the US Basketball League\u2019s Miami Tropics (where a number of his players were former substance abusers) and then the Spurs, Sixers and Cavaliers. His timing was poor in Philly and Cleveland; he was fired before the Sixers drafted Allen Iverson and by the Cavs before they drafted LeBron James. Lucas is now a Rockets assistant coach in charge of player development and has the unique position of having ties with both Houston and the Warriors in this second-round series; Lucas played for Golden State in the late \u201870s. He sat for a recent interview and discussed his sobriety, his stint as a professional doubles player in tennis \u2014 Lucas was a singles champion in the Atlantic Coast Conference while also playing basketball \u2014 and when he coached the Spurs and dealt with the country\u2019s tabloid couple at the time, Dennis Rodman and Madonna: * * * Shaun Powell, NBA.com : You\u2019ve had a front-row seat for the last three years to see James Harden. What do you know about his game that others might not? John Lucas, Houston Rockets coach : He\u2019s got the fastest feet I\u2019ve ever seen for someone who scores as much as he does. I\u2019m not talking about footrace speed. Just basketball speed and movement. It aids his step-back jumper. I\u2019ve worked with Kobe and LeBron and his feet are faster than anyone I\u2019ve ever worked with. And he uses his body well. His size is perfect for his game. SP : You were just 6-2 and 175 in your day. Could you guard Harden, and what advice would you give for anyone trying to guard Harden now? JL : I would just holler `Help!\u2019 And that would be my advice for anyone else. Get help. Lots of help. SP : As a former point guard, what do you appreciate most about Chris Paul?  JL : Chris is the one whose game reminds me of the way I played, although I wasn\u2019t as good as he is. He\u2019s going to beat you with his brain. He\u2019s athletic but not the most athletic. He is the most cerebral. He\u2019s going to find out where you are and he has a knack for knowing what the other team\u2019s going to do. Some of the things I\u2019ve learned from him that I\u2019ve passed onto young point guards is him knowing how to stay a step ahead of the other player. Chris is always one step ahead of you. SP : But center Clint Capela gives you the most pride, correct? JL : He\u2019s had to travel a longer road than James or Chris, and he\u2019s come a long way from when I first got here. We\u2019ve worked together and I saw the growth. It\u2019s all because of his work ethic and his desire. That made him into the player he is today. SP : Do you still remember draft day, 1976? JL : The draft was done on the phone. There was no TV show with hosts and commercial breaks. You just got a call. That\u2019s it. And the whole thing took maybe an hour. They didn\u2019t take point guards that high back then, but then came Magic (Johnson) and Allen Iverson and a few others after me. There\u2019s two positions you gotta have, point guard and the center. Even with the analytics, that hasn\u2019t changed. SP : You were in denial about your substance abuse troubles; you were suspended by the Warriors after missing six games and showing up late for practices in 1981, but that wasn\u2019t rock bottom. When was that? JL : I missed a game March 14, 1986. I was with the Rockets. I woke up on the street and didn\u2019t know what happened. The game was in Portland and I didn\u2019t make the trip. I had a $3 million contract on the line but only if I could stay sober for the season. We went to the NBA Finals that year but I wasn\u2019t around for it. SP : What was the reaction from the Rockets? JL : Bill Fitch was the coach and he said, `We\u2019re out of the rehab business.\u2019 Well, he saved my life. I tell him that all the time. I love him for that. SP : And you never looked back? JL : I was sick and tired of being sick and tired. They say you never recover until you hit rock bottom and I didn\u2019t know how to help myself until I hit rock bottom. SP : This obviously made you qualified to help start and serve as an advisor for the NBA\u2019s drug program, and also help others, right? JL : I tell the people I help that you can\u2019t fool somebody who has been everywhere you ever thought about going. I always thought `denial\u2019 was a river in Africa. I\u2019ve lived it. I\u2019ve gone through it. Only 1 out of 10 of us make it back, make it through recovery. A lot of them save their lives but lost their career. Some that have had both gone. You don\u2019t want to be where I\u2019ve been. I\u2019ve seen the devil. SP : And you\u2019ve never looked back. How\u2019s life in recovery? JL : Every day is a new start in your life. What you did yesterday doesn\u2019t define who you are. That\u2019s who you used to be. That\u2019s not who you are. SP : We\u2019ve seen a number of successful athletes have issues, when seemingly they have it all. Why is that? JL : Being a star is probably the most depressed world you can live in. Because now you don\u2019t know who\u2019s going to be there as your friend and who loves you as a person. SP : While you were still playing in the NBA, you dabbled in pro tennis in the World Team Tennis league and was the mixed doubles partner of Dr. Renee Richards, the transexual player who entered the US Open as a woman in 1977. Explain that experience. JL : For my recovery from drugs and alcohol, I had to accept people for who they are. I just wanted to be loved because I\u2019d screwed up so bad, and so people from same sex marriages and someone like Renee, I could identify with, because like them, who are often rejected by society, I wanted to be loved. I wanted someone to accept me again. We were great as partners and got along well. Tough to beat us on the court, too. Both of us lefties. Big serves. We went something like 28-1. A great time. SP : You coached the Spurs right before they hired Gregg Popovich to be the team general manager, and right after Larry Brown left. You had David Robinson, a straight arrow, but also Dennis Rodman on that team. And he had a special guest, right?  JL : He was going out with Madonna at that time. I brought her in the locker room. I introduced her to the guys. But I didn\u2019t know it would become such a distraction, all the attention she brought from the media. It really hurt us in the playoffs because it distracted us against Utah in the first round. Dennis was ejected from one game and suspended from another game, which we lost at home. It was our year to win it and we lost in the first round. SP : But at least Madonna was on her best behavior, I suspect? JL : Very nice, very smart woman, down to earth. Very businesslike. She was trying to help Dennis to help become more businesslike. SP : What in your past has helped you today as a coach? JL : I\u2019ve been the No. 1 guy and the last guy and the aging veteran, so I know all parts of the game. I deal with players in all of those phases. Sometimes a player might be upset about his role or playing time. I try to walk through their process of being in the rotation. I understand the feeling. SP : How far can the Rockets go this season? JL : All the way. We have an MVP and Chris Paul. Mike D\u2019Antoni is fun to play for because he lets the players get the best out of their abilities. This is a good team, a great team. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years. You can e-mail him  here , find his archive here  and follow him on  Twitter  .

They piled up the same number of 3-pointers and free throws as well. The games were that good, that tight, and the difference between the two teams was negligible at best. Then Tuesday night happened. Paul Millsap happened. Nikola Jokic happened. Jamal Murray happened. The manifestation of a Nuggets team that\u2019s been dancing with a destiny that leads to the Western Conference finals, finally happened. Their 124-98 rout of the Trail Blazers in Game 5 at Pepsi Center was the sort of declaration Nuggets coach Michael Malone has been predicting for his team since they were locked into a back-and-forth struggle with the San Antonio Spurs in the first round. They evened the series Sunday in Portland, showing mettle beyond their years by snapping the Trail Blazers\u2019 12-game home winning streak that dated back to the regular season, with an inspired effort to stave off the certain doom of a 3-1 deficit. Tuesday night\u2019s salvo was a seismic shift in the opposite direction. The Nuggets\u2019 biggest lead was 31 points and their intentions were plain for everyone to see. Millsap roasted the Blazers for 24 points and eight rebounds, dominating while being featured more and executing his considerable advantage in small-ball situations. \u201cThe best thing about Paul Millsap is he\u2019s true to himself, he never tries to be something he\u2019s not,\u201d Malone said. \u201cHe\u2019s not a rah-rah guy, he\u2019s not a guy that\u2019s going to be screaming and yelling. But I think his calm demeanor has an effect on our group. Young team going through all of this for the first time and when you can look to a four-time All-Star with 90 playoff games under his belt, that\u2019s reassuring. He\u2019s kind of the calm for our team and I think that has a tremendous impact on all of our young players.\u201d Two in particular during this postseason and this series, to be sure. Jokic led the way with 25 points, 19 rebounds and six assists before fouling out late, leaving little doubt as to who deserves to wear the crown as the best big man in the league right now. Murray was splendid again, with 18 points and nine assists, while his backcourt mate Gary Harris chipped in with 16 points and six rebounds. Will Barton and Malik Beasley scored 10 points each off the bench, leading a 33-point bench scoring effort that will need to travel back to Portland for Thursday\u2019s Game 6 if the Nuggets have any chance of winning three straight and ending this series in six games. \u201cWe know going to Portland for Game 6 is going to be really tough,\u201d Malone said, referencing his team\u2019s Game 6 struggles in the first round. \u201cGame 6 in San Antonio, we did not come ready to play, mentally or physically. I hope that we have a much different mindset going in to Portland for Game 6.\u201d The Blazers have some serious tweaking to do, in a short amount of time, as well. Their starters didn\u2019t even play in the fourth quarter, Terry Stotts acknowledging that the 30-point hole his team was fighting out of might have been too large, given the circumstances. And the need to preserve the energy of Damian Lillard, CJ McCollum and the crew for what sets up as their biggest game of the season was obvious. \u201cAt this point, it\u2019s one game at a time facing elimination,\u201d Lillard said. \u201cWe know that we\u2019re more than capable of getting it done in the next game. We don\u2019t feel like we\u2019ve played our best basketball yet, and with our back against the wall, we don\u2019t really have a choice. Our mindset is to just get to the next one, take care of home and make it back here.\u201d Stotts has adjustments to make before Thursday night as well, after the Nuggets bludgeoned his team in the paint for a 66-44 scoring advantage, while also outrebounding them 62-44. The decision to switch Enes Kanter\u2019s primary defensive assignment from Jokic to Millsap Tuesday, with Al-Farouq Aminu being tasked to try and contain the much bigger Jokic, backfired as Millsap went to work immediately on Kanter. \u201cThey just played harder than us,\u201d Kanter said. \u201cI think that was probably \u2026 even the coach said, probably this was our worst basketball the last six weeks. Shots didn\u2019t fall in, on defense we weren\u2019t really communicating with each other, we didn\u2019t really trust each other. We\u2019ve just got to learn from this and just go home and take care of home, because right now, that\u2019s the most important game of the year.\u201d The atmosphere Thursday night at Moda Center promises to be electric. The Blazers have long enjoyed one of the best home atmospheres in the league. But will it serve as the advantage it has in the past when the Nuggets are fresh off two straight huge wins in this series, the first on that floor? \u201cWe have two must-wins,\u201d Stotts said. \u201cSomebody was going to have a must-win after tonight and it\u2019s us. So we have two must-wins ahead of us.\u201d That four-overtime loss in Game 3 Friday night could have been the emotional breaking point for the Nuggets. It wasn\u2019t. A school shooting Tuesday morning in a Denver suburb where Malone lives with his wife and daughters rattled the coach and an entire community. That sort of life-altering event could easily have sidetracked Malone and his team. They persevered. The Nuggets were locked in from the start. When it became clear that the Blazers weren\u2019t going to be able to keep up the pace, they kept pushing until the final buzzer. They understand the opportunity staring them in the face; a conference finals date with the two-time reigning champion Golden State Warriors or Houston Rockets, who are tied 2-2 heading into Game 5 Wednesday (10:30 ET, TNT) at Oracle Arena. It\u2019s a wild shift for a team that failed to play its way into the playoffs last year on the final night of the regular season, only to rebound and earn the No. 2 seed in the Western Conference playoff chase this season. If the atmosphere for Game 4 or even Game 5 seemed overwhelming, Thursday night promises to be otherworldly for both of these teams that were previously separated by so little. * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

The Raptors were 17-5 without Leonard in the regular season. Kyle Lowry is an All-Star, Pascal Siakam is the next big thing, and the Raptors\u2019 go eight deep with capable NBA players with postseason experience. But that 17-5 record without Leonard broke down to 13-0 against non-playoff teams and 4-5 against playoff teams. And in this series, Leonard simply wasn\u2019t getting a lot of help. His 68 points over Games 2 and 3 weren\u2019t enough, and the Raptors needed every bit of his 39 to win Game 4 in Philadelphia on Sunday and essentially keep their season alive. The guy was averaging 38 points on 62 percent shooting, and they were a possession or two from being down 3-1. So yeah, to have Leonard come back down to earth somewhat and still get a blowout, 125-89 victory on Tuesday to take a 3-2 series lead? It was somewhat comforting, as you might imagine. \u201cIt was good to prove it a little bit in the playoffs,\u201d Nurse said of winning without a superhuman performance from Leonard. \u201cI don\u2019t know if \u2018relief\u2019 is the right word, but it\u2019s nice to see other guys pick it up.\u201d \u201cWe needed this type of game where everyone played well,\u201d Lowry added. \u201cI don\u2019t think we had a game like this in a while. We\u2019ve still got another level that I think we can play at offensively and defensively. But it was a good team win. We needed that type of win just for our team.\u201d Leonard began the game by stripping Ben Simmons on Philly\u2019s first two possessions. He had two spectacular dunks, one over multiple Sixers at the end of the first half and another on Joel Embiid\u2019s head in the third quarter. He scored 21 points, grabbed 13 rebounds and dished out four assists. But he missed more than half of his shots for just the second time in 10 postseason games , and he did not need to carry his team like he did through the first four games of this series. He was more of a \u201cnormal\u201d All-Star than the relentless machine that was shooting a seemingly unsustainable 57 percent from outside the paint prior to Tuesday. With Leonard missing his first four shots of Game 4, the Raptors were in a little bit of a hole. The Sixers scored on nine straight possessions and led by seven midway through the first quarter. But after the last of those nine straight Philly scores, Lowry took the inbounds pass, pushed the ball up the floor, and drew a foul on Greg Monroe. On the next possession, Lowry stripped Monroe, leading to a fast break where Leonard found Siakam for a corner 3. Two possessions later, a Lowry\/Siakam pick-and-pop resulted in another Siakam 3-pointer that tied the game. Two possessions after that, Siakam tipped out a Leonard miss and Norman Powell fed Fred VanVleet, who had missed 12 straight shots in the series, for a 3 that put the Raptors up four. It was a 12-1 run that gave the Raptors the lead for good, and Leonard was just a cog in the machine, instead of being the entire machine himself. Leonard shot 7-for-16 and missed all four of his 3-point attempts. But every other Raptors shot with the confidence that he had earlier in the series. Long gone was the hesitancy which plagued them in Game 3. And Nurse believes his team started to find itself in Game 4, when the Raptors got just enough support from Lowry, Marc Gasol and Serge Ibaka to even the series. \u201cI thought I sensed a little bit better rhythm the other night,\u201d Nurse said. \u201cThere\u2019s three things: You gotta get your feet ready, you gotta get your hands ready, and you gotta between your ears ready to know you\u2019re going to pull the trigger and know that you\u2019re going to do it. I thought it showed the other night that we were a little bit less hesitant and that again puts you in rhythm.\u201d Earlier in this series, ball movement wasn\u2019t necessarily a good thing for the Raptors, because Leonard was scoring more efficiently by calling his own number than his teammates were when he was forced to give up the ball. But his off-the-dribble efficiency was bound to regress, and the tide may have turned in regard to his teammates\u2019 ability to support him. For the first time in this postseason, six different Raptors scored in double figures in Game 5. The seven rotation players not named Leonard shot 14-for-32 (44 percent) from 3-point range. \u201cI think the version of us you saw tonight is probably the best version and a little bit more balanced,\u201d VanVleet said. \u201c[Leonard] did a great job of spreading it around a little bit. They showed some more bodies, as you would expect for a guy averaging 40. They were sending more bodies at him and he was moving it pretty well. That was good for us.\u201d The Raptors certainly benefited from another sluggish performance from Embiid, who was still suffering from the illness that slowed him down in Game 4. If possible, he looked even more disengaged on Tuesday, scoring just 13 points on 5-for-10 shooting and turning the ball over eight times. Embiid couldn\u2019t put the ball on the floor without losing control of it, and he didn\u2019t have the energy to get in the post, too often settling for 3-point attempts that the Raptors were happy to have him shoot. But the Raptors had a lot to do with the Sixers scoring just 73 points on 80 possessions before garbage time set in. They cut off Ben Simmons\u2019 drives to the basket, crowded the Sixers in the paint, and were more active on the perimeter, picking up 12 steals. Some of that improved offensive rhythm was a product of what has been the No. 1-ranked defense in the postseason. So after Game 5, there was no \u201cKyle Lowry struggles to score in the playoffs\u201d narrative. There was no wondering if the Sixers were just too big for VanVleet or if Gasol needed to be more aggressive. There was just a return to what the Raptors had been for most of this season, which is a lot more than a one-man show. \u201cWe\u2019re a team,\u201d Siakam said. \u201cAll year, that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done. Even times when Kawhi didn\u2019t play, we always came together. \u201cKawhi\u2019s an amazing player. And when there\u2019s nights where he\u2019s going the way he\u2019s going, and he\u2019s scoring 40, and shooting fadeaways, and making all those shots, it\u2019s kind of amazing to see. But at the same time, we know we\u2019re a team, and we always have each other\u2019s back. And at the end of the day, we have to keep playing.\u201d One more win and they\u2019ll keep playing into the conference finals. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

George had surgery for a partially torn tendon in his right shoulder and his status will be evaluated before the start of the 2019-20 season. George also will have surgery on a small labrum tear in his left shoulder in the coming weeks, the team said in a statement. Westbrook had two procedures. One was for a torn ligament in a finger on his left hand. The other was an elective arthroscopic procedure on his right knee. He is expected to return to basketball activities in approximately three weeks. Westbrook averaged a triple-double for the third straight season with 22.9 points, 11.1 rebounds and 10.7 assists per game. Both players had their procedures in Los Angeles. ESPN was the first to report the surgeries. George ranked second in the league with 28 points per game this season, and he led the league with 2.21 steals per game. Both shoulders hampered him in the final two months of the season. Before that, he was considered among the leading candidates for the league MVP award and the Thunder were one of the top teams in the Western Conference. With both stars banged up, the Thunder faltered late in the season and lost to Portland in five games in the first round of the playoffs. \u201cI just was frustrated,\u201d George said after the Thunder were eliminated late last month. \u201cI think it came at a terrible time, especially the team was rolling. We were playing good. I was holding up pretty, pretty, pretty good. I just thought it came at the wrong time, honestly. But again, I\u2019ve never made no excuses on it. I was dealing with it for a long time throughout the season. It just got worse and worse as it went on.\u201d George mostly played through the pain. His shoulders were heavily taped and he often had a heating pad on his right shoulder when he wasn\u2019t on the court. \u201cInjuries are part of the game,\u201d George said. \u201cI\u2019ve missed a season being hurt, so I was able to \u2013 the training staff assured me I was fine to play through it, and I will be fine going forward.

Each game has been decided by six points or less. Kevin Durant and Steph Curry, perhaps the best shooters in the NBA and among the greatest all-time, each had clean looks at 3-pointers in the final seconds Monday for the Warriors and missed a chance to send Game 4 into overtime. The Rockets won, 112-108 . Yes, this is now closer than identical twins and possibly headed to the same finish of a year ago, when the Warriors took out Houston in seven games during the conference finals. And if you look under the hood and examine the parts, you\u2019ll see that in the moments of truth over the last two games that Houston won and created this deadlock. The Rockets were the aggressor, the bully, the chance-taker and ultimately more clutch than the champs. They\u2019re beating the Warriors up inside and out. This doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ll be the better team at the finish line, whether in six games or seven. But right now, they\u2019ve made this contest closer than most imagined and given themselves a shot in what is now a best-two-out-of-three. \u201cIt\u2019s a dogfight, and every possession matters,\u201d said Chris Paul. The Rockets claimed victory Monday because James Harden was aces again, scoring 38 points and becoming more efficient \u2013 though, to the horror of the Warriors, he was no longer alone. Suddenly, Harden is getting ample help, and the more his supporting cast grows in confidence, the bigger the task it\u2019ll be for the Warriors to finish the job. Here\u2019s the tale of the tape: The Rockets are punching Golden State in the gut, with forward PJ Tucker delivering the body blows. Tucker is just 6-foot-6, yet brings the temperament of a honey badger in a bad mood when it comes to grabbing rebounds. For the second straight game, Tucker snagged double-figures and been especially menacing on the offensive end; he\u2019s going for seconds and sometimes thirds in heavy traffic and giving Houston additional chances at buckets. It\u2019s not just ordinary rebounds he\u2019s getting, but the most important ones. That hunger has a psychological effect as well, breaking the spirits of the Warriors while rousting the passion in his teammates. The sight of Tucker out-fighting Draymond Green for loose balls and missed shots is an emotional boost and keeps possessions alive. \u201cI\u2019m pleased people get a chance to see Tuck,\u201d said Paul. \u201cEverybody sees players in commercials and all that, but they don\u2019t get a chance to see someone play defense and go after rebounds like him. That energy fuels everyone else. That\u2019s basketball.\u201d Houston has out-rebounded the Warriors in its two straight wins and Green says that can\u2019t continue. \u201cWe have to change our mindset,\u201d he said, \u201cand that begins with me. That\u2019s my department. They\u2019re slapping us. It\u2019s an easy correction, and if we correct it we\u2019ll be fine.\u201d Maybe the more disturbing aspect of this series is how the Warriors are also getting out-splashed. It\u2019s not terribly surprising to see the Rockets dropping more 3-pointers; after all, they take more than anyone in basketball. Yet, the Warriors just aren\u2019t efficient and that\u2019s especially the case with Curry and Klay Thompson. Harden has made just two fewer 3-pointers than Curry and Thompson combined. While Curry seemed to break free of his semi-slump Monday with 30 points, his highest single-game point total of the series, he missed 10 of his 14 shots from deep. And Thompson is trapped in a thicker fog right now; he missed 5-of-6 from deep and delivered a weak 11 points and really hasn\u2019t stepped forward for Golden State all series. The shot selection for Curry and Thompson has appeared wicked and surprisingly reckless at times, especially in the fourth quarter. \u201cI felt we were in a rush a lot tonight with our shots,\u201d said Kerr. \u201cI don\u2019t think we got great shots for much of the night. When you\u2019re not searching for great shots, you\u2019re not going to shoot that well.\u201d With only Durant managing to look efficient from beyond the arc, the Warriors are getting lapped. In the last three games, or once Harden\u2019s poked eye improved, the Rockets have made 18 more 3-pointers than Golden State. \u201cOur mentality changed after Game 2,\u201d said Harden. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to let up. We\u2019re going to keep coming at you.\u201d There are reasons the Warriors shouldn\u2019t be in a state of panic. The next game is at Oracle Arena. And the two they just lost at Toyota Center they could\u2019ve been won had they made plays at the end. Game 3 went into overtime and Curry missed an uncontested layup in the final 90 seconds of that tight game. And the Warriors had those pair of looks by Curry and Durant in Game 4, the sight of which sent chills through the Rockets. \u201cI thought it was going into overtime,\u201d said Austin Rivers. \u201cOne hundred percent. KD got one and I\u2019m like, \u2018C\u2019mon man.\u2019 And then Steph got one. We are fortunate.\u201d Paul added: \u201cGoing back to the Bay, they\u2019re probably not going to miss those shots.\u201d Besides, Houston was qualified to be the most difficult out for the Warriors to win a third straight title, or at least reach the NBA Finals. After all, the Rockets have Harden and Paul, and their ability to shoot 3s means they can seldom be counted out of games even if they\u2019re trailing. A furious rally is always a moment away. Besides, aside from Trevor Ariza, this is virtually the same team that took Golden State to the seven-game limit last year and had to play the final two games without Paul, who had a hamstring pull. \u201cI thought they were great,\u201d said Kerr. \u201cThey did what they had to do, win their two home games.\u201d But there wasn\u2019t the scent of concern coming from the Warriors. Perhaps it\u2019s the pride of a team still believing it\u2019s heads and shoulders above the league, or a stern belief that whatever advantages Houston had over the last two games will be snuffed. Durant remains playing at an epic level and the basketball logic says Curry, and perhaps Thompson, will eventually snap out of it, not because the Rockets\u2019 defense will weaken, but because Curry and Thompson have, you know, a track record of excellence. \u201cWe know what we have to do,\u201d Kerr said bravely. Perhaps. But for the second time in as many years, the Rockets have the Warriors\u2019 full attention, and Golden State must be near-perfect to prevent from being pushed to the ledge. \u201cWhat I like is how everybody does their job,\u201d said Tucker. \u201cThat makes us \u2018us.\u2019 We\u2019re tough. We\u2019re that kind of team.\u201d If the Warriors didn\u2019t know it before, they know that now. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

One of these teams is going to beat the other four times. But it may just be a case of survival, one team scratching out four wins and moving on to the conference finals. Through four games, this has been the least efficient series in the conference semifinals, with the teams combining to score just 104 points per 100 possessions. The two teams rank sixth and eighth in offensive efficiency among the eight teams playing in this round. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been in great rhythm here in the last few games,\u201d Raptors coach Nick Nurse admitted Tuesday. \u201cThat\u2019s playing the same team over and over.\u201d The Raptors did score 101 points on 93 possessions in Game 4, their second-best offensive game of the series. The Sixers have been the better offensive team overall, but have really had just one good offensive game and three rough ones. Game 2 was one of two in these playoffs where a team won while scoring less than a point per possession . This series has also been played at a pace (95.4 possessions per team per 48 minutes) slower than that of any NBA team in the regular season. And that could an issue for the Sixers, who played at a faster pace than the Raptors in the regular season and at a much faster pace than Toronto in the first round. The 95.4 rating is only 0.3 possessions per 48 minutes slower than the Toronto-Orlando series, but it\u2019s 10.2 possessions per 48 slower than the Philly-Brooklyn series. Prior to Game 4, it was noted that the Raptors weren\u2019t scoring in transition as efficiently as they did in the regular season. With J.J. Redick having shot 5-for-6 from 3-point range in the first six seconds of the shot clock, the Sixers have actually scored very efficiently in transition in this series: 1.33 points per transition possession. But they haven\u2019t gotten the same number of transition opportunities as they did in the regular season or in the first round. In the regular season, Philly scored 1.07 points per possession ( a bottom-10 rate ) on 20.0 transition possessions per game. In the first round against Brooklyn, the Sixers scored just 1.00 points per possession on 19.0 transition possessions per game . In this series, they\u2019ve scored those 1.33 points per possession, but on just 13.5 transition possessions per game. Against Brooklyn, Ben Simmons averaged 3.6 shots per game in the first six seconds of the shot clock, according to Second Spectrum tracking. In the conference semis, he has just five total field-goal attempts in the first six seconds. The Raptors have seemingly won the pace battle, in part because they\u2019ve averaged only 5.5 live-ball turnovers per game, with Brooklyn having averaged 7.8 in the first round. But Sixers coach Brett Brown explained after Game 2 that, with his team\u2019s shorter rotation and the remaining players playing more minutes, it\u2019s more difficult to push the ball in transition on every opportunity. \u201cWe\u2019ll try from time to time to play as fast as we can,\u201d Brown said, \u201cbut the reality is it\u2019s just a grind. And when you shrink your rotation, you\u2019re probably not going to be able to call upon that type of freshness as much as if you were playing like a normal 9 1\/2, 10 [guys].\u201d The bigger difference between Toronto\u2019s two wins and Philadelphia\u2019s two wins has been on the Toronto end of the floor , where he Raptors have scored 109.4 points per 100 possessions in Games 1 and 4, and just 96.8 in Games 2 and 3. But one number stands out in regard to the Sixers\u2019 offense in wins vs. losses. In their two wins, they\u2019ve shot 45-for-77 (58 percent) in the paint . In their two losses, they\u2019ve shot 37-for-79 (47 percent) in the paint . \u201cWe have to own some of it,\u201d Brown said Monday of his team\u2019s inability to finish in Game 4. \u201cYou give credit to Toronto\u2019s length and their attention to that area.\u201d Indeed, the Raptors played bigger in Game 4 and Serge Ibaka blocked three shots inside. In the regular season, Philly ranked fifth in field goal percentage in the paint (57.4 percent), but 17th in effective field goal percentage on shots from outside the paint (49.3 percent). So defending the former seems like a good priority for Toronto. Of course, if the Raptors are going to collapse in the paint and focus on contesting shots inside, the Sixers will get open looks on the perimeter. They made 12 threes on Sunday , but Tobias Harris (2-for-13) and Mike Scott (0-for-3) were a combined 2-for-16 from beyond the arc. Over the four games, Harris (7-for-22) has attempted more catch-and-shoot 3s than J.J. Redick (9-for-20), which is probably a good thing for the Raptors. Right after Kawhi Leonard hit the biggest shot of the series on Sunday, Harris missed a wide-open corner 3  when the Toronto defense collapsed on a Joel Embiid roll to the rim. If Harris made that shot, it\u2019s back to a one-point game with about 40 seconds left. Alas, he missed and the Raptors made enough free throws to seal the game and even the series. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

Khris Middleton sat down. And the Milwaukee Bucks\u2019 chance of beating the Boston Celtics in Game 4 of their Eastern Conference semifinal series seemed to sit down with them. In a hostile arena, against an opponent that by all rights should have been desperate (though the emotion never did quite translate to the Celtics\u2019 performance), losing your best two players to foul trouble at a crucial point in the second half should have been too much for Milwaukee. Antetokounmpo got whistled for his fourth personal foul with 8:18 left in the third quarter, the teams tied at 59-59. Before the score ever budged, 61 seconds later, Middleton got his fourth. It was automatic for Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer to yank both his All-Stars, with so much game left and the risk of one or both fouling out so great. This should have been the opportunity the Celtics needed. They had misfired their way to that point, shooting 37 percent overall in the first half and 4-of-19 on 3-pointers. But they had their full complement of starters available. Boston should have pounced. Boston should have cracked open the game right there and earned itself a 2-2 series tie. Instead, the Bucks stiffened, then pushed back. They might even have ended the series, turning that stretch of resiliency to end the third quarter into a 113-101 victory . They hold a 3-1 lead now with a chance to close it out at home in Game 5 Wednesday and advance to the conference finals. That\u2019s how pivotal the Bucks\u2019 plucky response to adversity was. They not only fended off the Celtics during that star-starved stretch, they took the lead: Milwaukee went on a little 13-9 run to the 2:31 mark of the third, triggering a timeout by Boston coach Brad Stevens. Then play resumed, and the Bucks outscored them again 8-4 to close the quarter. It was the exact opposite of what should have happened, Milwaukee opening up an 80-72 lead while playing shorthanded, and Boston squandering such a ripe chance to seize the game. Yet there wasn\u2019t much surprise showing in the visitors\u2019 dressing room. \u201cWe were just playing the same way,\u201d said center Brook Lopez. \u201cWe always say, \u2018Same way. Same way,\u2019 and just keep grinding. We did a great job these past two games just grinding for the first 30, 35 minutes or whatever, and then just taking advantage whenever the moment comes.\u201d This should have been Boston\u2019s moment, though. It\u2019s true that the Bucks\u2019 depth has been a weapon all season and that their role players have prided themselves on maintaining \u2014 or adding to \u2014 leads. But c\u2019mon, they were working without a net this time. Antetokounmpo and Middleton had to sit for a while at least, if not the balance of the quarter. The worst thing that could happen if they came back too soon would be picking up their fifth fouls. The second-worst thing would be playing overly cautious to avoid doing that. Didn\u2019t the players who stepped into the breach feel the burden? \u201cWe didn\u2019t really feel that way,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cWe had that trust and belief in one another. We were just trying not to have any sort of letdown.\u201d Budenholzer dealt with the fragile situation by reminding himself that he typically subs out his stars in that general vicinity of the game. Keeping them fresh for the fourth quarter is a priority, particularly with Antetokounmpo. It\u2019s just that this time, the terms were dictated to the Bucks coach. \u201cIt\u2019s always hard to take out Giannis, let\u2019s just start there,\u201d Budenholzer said. But he added, \u201cBecause of our normal subs rotation, it wasn\u2019t as tough to take him out.\u201d Lopez, George Hill, Ersan Ilyasova, Eric Bledsoe, Nikola Mirotic, Pat Connaughton and Sterling Brown all played during Antetokounmpo\u2019s and Middleton\u2019s absences. (Middleton returned for an uneventful final 20 seconds in the period.) Bledsoe got it going offensively, then Hill \u2013 not unlike his super-sub showing in Game 3 \u2013 scored nine of Milwaukee\u2019s final 11 points in the quarter. And they all locked in defensively, making life miserable for a Celtics team that never recovered. \u201cAbsolutely. We\u2019re always defense first,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cI think we even stepped up our intensity in that moment.\u201d The Greek Freak, while all this was going on, sat between deep reserves D.J. Wilson and inactive rookie Donte DiVincenzo with a concerned look on his face and nervous energy bouncing through one leg. Tough benchmate? \u201cI mean, he\u2019s one of those guys who wants to play all 48,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cHe hates when he comes out. He\u2019s kind of like that every game.\u201d Said Antetokounmpo: \u201cIt\u2019s amazing to see that the bench can keep playing hard, keep defending hard and set the tone for us.\u201d The past two games, the Bucks\u2019 bench has outscored Boston\u2019s 74-23. So Milwaukee didn\u2019t just survive, it thrived. It started the fourth with its top guys more rested than usual. And oh, did it show. Antetokounmpo scored 17 points in that quarter, but, playing all 12 minutes during which he scored half of the Bucks\u2019 12 field goals and grabbed seven rebounds. Middleton was scoreless but was a plus-seven the rest of the way, second only to Connaughton\u2019s plus-11. Boston wound up trading baskets for much of the fourth. Al Horford\u2019s layup at 7:25 got his team within 91-86, only to see Lopez and Antetokounmpo score all of the Bucks\u2019 points in a 14-6 stretch that ate up five minutes. The home team seemed to be fraying, bringing an air of inevitability to the night. Speculation that it might have been All-Star guard Kyrie Irving\u2019s final game as a Celtic in Boston \u2013 he\u2019ll be a free agent this summer and never has seemed particularly happy here \u2013 began immediately. Irving, after a golden Game 1, has played haphazardly in the past three while shooting a combined 19-of-62. \u201cWho cares?\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a little different when your rhythm is challenged every play down. You\u2019re being picked up full court. They\u2019re doing things to test you. The expectations on me are going to be sky high. I try to utilize their aggression against them and still put my teammates in great positions, while still being aggressive and trying to do it all. \u201cFor me, the 22 shots? I should have shot 30.\u201d The Bucks, boasting strong chemistry since training camp, never has looked tighter. In fact, when Lopez was asked if he felt a sense of relief that they reached the fourth quarter without getting pummeled, he wouldn\u2019t go there. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a sense of relief,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say that, because one through 15 we have trust in everyone in this locker room. Whoever we have out on the floor, we\u2019re never like, \u2018Oh damn, we\u2019re stuck with these guys.\u2019\u201d * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

He was before the Denver Nuggets came up on the wrong side of a four overtime marathon Friday night against the Portland Trial Blazers, the sort of emotionally draining game that could break a young team. And he was after the Nuggets bounced back 36 hours later and reclaimed home court advantage in their Western Conference semifinal with arguably the most impressive win in a season filled with them. Living through the journey of missing out on a playoff berth last season on the final night of the 2017-18 regular season to earning the No. 2 seed in the Western Conference playoff chase this season, Millsap said he had no choice but to believe. In his teammates, the mission and the resiliency, heart and toughness of a group that has had to learn how to compete at the highest level in real time, given that their catalysts \u2014 Nikola Jokic and Jamal Murray \u2014 had no previous playoff experience. Millsap exuded a quiet confidence that the Nuggets would head home for Game 5 of this series, Tuesday at Pepsi Center ( 10:30 ET, TNT ) , in a good place. Instead of needing a win to stave off elimination, the Nuggets are in a position to press their own advantage \u2014 they were a NBA-best 34-7 at home this season \u2014 with a trip to the conference finals within reach. As the most experienced member of a gritty group, a bunch that\u2019s already been tested by a seven-game grind in its first round series against the San Antonio Spurs, Millsap said he had to lead by example with the season on the line. Murray was spectacular, scoring a game-high 34 points and going 11-for-11 from the free-throw line, including six straight down the stretch to seal the Game 5 win. Jokic was equally spectacular, finishing with his fourth triple-double (21 points, 12 rebounds and 11 assists) of this postseason. Overshadowed but just as critical was the 21 points, 10 rebounds, two blocks and steadying influence Millsap provided. He spoke with NBA.com\u2019  s Sekou Smith about the Nuggets, his journey and more with a monumental Game 5 looming: Sekou Smith, NBA.com : How do you know when you get on a team like this, with so many young pieces still developing, that you might potentially have something special like what you guys have put together this season? Paul Millsap, Denver Nuggets: Personnel. It\u2019s about the personnel. The teammates you have, we have a great group of guys, and anytime you have a great group of guys who are willing to do whatever it takes to win, there is an opportunity there. That\u2019s been there all along, honestly. You could sense it from the start we had after missing out on the playoffs last season. So hopefully, we\u2019ll keep this team together. SS: In your last two stops as a free agent you were a part of a significant turnaround in Atlanta (60-win season and trip to the Eastern Conference finals in 2016) and now this turnaround and run with these young Nuggets. What is it with you and the right timing and the right fit? PM: I value timing. And all of these decisions are based on that and where I was in my career at that time and where I wanted my career to go. So making the right decisions is always important. And then just being the right fit culturally, you know, looking at a team and knowing it\u2019s a team where you can grow, that\u2019s unselfish and willing to do whatever it takes to win, those are all things that have been important to me and things I examined when I was coming up on those free agent situations and trying to make my decisions. I don\u2019t care how long you\u2019ve been in this league, you always have to be growing and improving. That\u2019s critical, your evolution as a professional and as man responsible for your own career. SS: How did you tackle that evolution? You came into this league during a different era, as an undersized power forward known for your rebounding and toughness but have become one of the more underrated two-way players in the league. How difficult was it to dive in and reinvent yourself over these years time and again? PM: It wasn\u2019t too difficult because I was willing to do it. I was willing to put in the time and put in the work. I\u2019m always evolving as a person, so to translate that over to basketball, it wasn\u2019t tough at all. The game has changed, and with the game constantly in that state, you have to change with it accordingly. I\u2019m always the go-with-the-flow sort of person anyway, so with the game moving this way or that way, I\u2019m going to go with it.  SS: As young as this Denver core group was when you joined them before the 2017-18 season, did it appeal to you or was it even obvious to you just how big of a mentorship role you\u2019d signed up for this crew? Because that\u2019s a different burden for a player who is in the midst of the prime of his career, making All-Star games and doing the things you were doing. PM: It\u2019s been somewhat of a challenge for myself, knowing when to and when not to be that guy. Like you said, in the prime of my career I\u2019m still trying to establish myself and reach the goals that I\u2019ve set for myself, knowing that whatever situation you go into there will be some sacrifices that have to be made. I\u2019ve never been a selfish person and I know that if I do the right things as a vet and make sure I help these guys get to where they need to be, it helps me out as well. So I don\u2019t too much worry about myself in that regard, with my game and what I have gong on. Because at the end of the day, production is production and it will always show up. So I don\u2019t get too focused on the numbers or on myself. It\u2019s a team game for me, always has been and always will be. SS: You\u2019ve been paired with other of the league\u2019s best big men before when you and Al Horford were making Eastern Conference All-Star teams together. But when you have a young guy with the talents of Jokic, a guy being talked about in that Kia MVP conversation, it would seem that\u2019s on another level altogether, no? PM: He\u2019s such a smart player. A lot of things I don\u2019t even have to say. He gets it. I try to help him as much as I can but not to be over the top with it. I try to lead by example every single day at practice. I come in here with a get-better attitude. But with that, with him being so young, he helps me and teaches me as well. Seeing him and watching him, a lot of things that he does and how he studies the game is unbelievable. It works both ways. I\u2019m appreciative of him being on this team and I hope he, as well, of me being the position I\u2019m in. And hopefully, we\u2019ll continue to have great success together. SS: What\u2019s been the key for you in terms of longevity, staying in the league and being as valuable at 34 as you were at 24, if not more? You had seven productive seasons in Utah before that four-year run in Atlanta. There aren\u2019t a ton of guys form that 2006 Draft class (Millsap was the 47th overall pick by the Jazz) still around. PM: As I said, evolving with the game and taking care of my body. I\u2019ve put a lot of time and effort into my body over the years. And it pays off. I\u2019ve been blessed and fortunate during my journey to meet a lot of people, doctors and therapists, plus with the knowledge I have gained over the years in the areas of health and fitness, I\u2019ve been able to put together a nice team to keep my body healthy and be successful. SS: With that said, what kind of move has Denver been for you in terms of the fit you\u2019ve been off the court? I know you were ingrained into the community in both Salt Lake City and Atlanta in your previous stops. PM: It\u2019s been great, man. Great. You know people probably don\u2019t realize this but I lived in Denver for 10 years as a kid. I was familiar with the city and what it had to offer. You know like any place it\u2019s changed a lot over the years. But that familiarity hit home for me. My brothers and my mom, being out here at an early age, so there was always some stuff in my head after that, like there was some unfinished business. It felt like that when I signed here and really, it was a match made in heaven, if you ask me. * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

They may try it again. Cleveland has scheduled an interview this week with San Antonio Spurs assistant Ettore Messina, a person familiar with the Cavs\u2019 coaching search said Monday. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the team is keeping details of its search confidential. Messina\u2019s coaching resume includes an impeccable run in Europe, where he won numerous titles and also coached Italy\u2019s national team. The 59-year-old Messina has worked on coach Gregg Popovich\u2019s staff in San Antonio since 2014 and is widely regarded as one of the NBA\u2019s top assistants. He\u2019ll be the second Spurs assistant to meet with Cleveland, which interviewed Ime Udoka on Sunday . It\u2019s not known if owner Dan Gilbert is taking part in the interviews. The Cavs ended an expansive, 39-day search for a coach in 2014 by hiring David Blatt, who like Messina, had major success in Europe. But while Blatt did win with Cleveland, getting the team to the NBA Finals in his first season, he struggled to mesh with players, including mega star LeBron James, and was fired midway through his second season despite a 30-11 record. Cleveland went on to win the title that season under Tyronn Lue, who was fired early last season after an 0-6 start. The Cavs are in the fourth week of a coaching search that began after the team parted with Larry Drew, who went 19-57 after replacing Lue. Drew endured a season filled with injuries and roster upheaval. Cleveland\u2019s front office previously interviewed Dallas assistant Jamahl Mosley, Miami assistant Juwan Howard, former Memphis coach J.B. Bickerstaff and Utah assistant Alex Jensen. The team has received permission to speak with Denver assistants Jordi Fernandez and Wes Unseld Jr. as well as Portland assistants David Vanterpool and Nate Tibbets. But with the Nuggets and Trail Blazers tied 2-2 in their Western Conference semifinal, it\u2019s unlikely the Cavs will speak to any of those candidates until after their teams have been eliminated."},{"id":33858,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/reports-lakers-expected-move-toward-hiring-lue","date":"2019-05-06","title":"Reports: Lakers expected to soon close in on Lue","content":" The Phoenix Suns\u2019 hiring of Monty Williams as coach today may have moved the Los Angeles Lakers closer to their next coaching hire, too. Per multiple reports, the Lakers are expected to soon move toward hiring Tyronn Lue as their next coach. ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski reports that no offer has been made yet to Lue by the Lakers, but that they are proceeding toward an offer to Lue in the coming days. Brad Turner of the Los Angeles Times reports that Lue is in Las Vegas waiting to hear from the Lakers about the job. The two sides are supposed to talk today about getting a deal done as Lue has always been the team\u2019s top choice for its coaching opening. Former Lakers coach Phil Jackson suggested to team owner Jeanie Buss that Lue would be a good coach for the Lakers, Turner reports.  Tania Ganguli and Brad Turner of the Los Angeles Times report that the Lakers are expected to reach out to Lue in an effort to hire them for their vacancy. Per the Los Angeles Times , Lue was favored for the job even before Luke Walton and the team agreed to part ways after the 2018-19 season. Williams and Lue completed their second interviews with the Lakers on April 24 and 25, respectively, the Los Angeles Times reports. However, neither heard from the Lakers as of late Thursday afternoon. Lue coached the Cavaliers from 2016-18, taking over in the middle of the 2015-16 season. He and James teamed to lead Cleveland to the 2016 NBA title as well as Finals appearances in \u201917 and \u201918. Lue was fired after Cleveland\u2019s 0-6 start this season, the Cavs\u2019 first since James left for the Lakers in free agency last summer. He amassed a 128-83 record with the Cavs and won two previous titles as a reserve with the Lakers in \u201900 and \u201901. The Lakers have been without a coach since Walton and the team officially parted ways on April 12. Walton was then hired by the Sacramento Kings as their new coach on April 15 . Williams coached the New Orleans Pelicans from 2010-15, leading them to a pair of playoff appearances while amassing a 173-221 record overall. He was fired after the Pelicans were swept from the 2015 playoffs by the Golden State Warriors. From there, Williams was an assistant on the Oklahoma City Thunder coaching staff. In February 2016, Williams\u2019 wife, Ingrid, was killed in a car accident . He then stepped away from his role with the Thunder to grieve and care for his family. He joined the San Antonio Spurs\u2019 front office in September, 2016 and this season served as an assistant on the Philadelphia 76ers coaching staff.

They hope Monty Williams is the man to lead their turnaround. The Suns announced Friday that they had come to terms with Williams, a former head coach and a current assistant in Philadelphia. He will take over as Phoenix\u2019s fifth coach in five seasons when the 76ers\u2019 playoff run ends. They lead Toronto 2-1 in the Eastern Conference semifinals. Williams replaces Igor Kokoskov, who was fired last week after one disappointing season. \u201cMonty brings a wealth of NBA experience, both as a coach and former player, in addition to being a high-character individual who will infuse basketball wisdom and life lessons into our locker room,\u201d Suns general manager James Jones said in a release. \u201cMonty is well respected for his coaching pedigree, leadership and commitment to the community, all of which make him the ideal person to lead our team moving forward.\u201d The 47-year-old Williams previously spent five seasons in charge in New Orleans from 2010 to 2015, a stint during which he led the franchise to two postseason appearances. He is in his first season as an assistant coach with the 76ers. He also played nine NBA seasons with New York, San Antonio, Denver, Orlando and Philadelphia. \u201cAnybody who pays attention even a little bit understands he\u2019s elite people,\u201d 76ers coach Brett Brown said. \u201cHe\u2019s emerging, relatively young coach who\u2019s incredibly relational and has been studying how to be an NBA coach. He\u2019s been around and I hope he\u2019s taken something from our program.\u201d Williams takes over a Suns team that has been mired in mediocrity, missing the playoffs for nine straight seasons. Phoenix finished 19-63 this season, second-worst in franchise history, in Kokoskov\u2019s only year in the desert. The Los Angeles Lakers had been in the running to hire Williams after they fired Luke Walton. Williams ended up in Phoenix to lead a young Suns roster that includes Devin Booker and Deandre Ayton, the No. 1 overall pick in last year\u2019s NBA draft. Phoenix also will have a high pick in this year\u2019s draft after finishing tied with Cleveland for the league\u2019s second-worst record behind the New York Knicks, who were 17-65. \u201cI\u2019ve been blessed to coach alongside and play for some of the best coaches in the NBA, and consider it a privilege to once again be a head coach with an excellent organization like the Suns,\u201d Williams said in a statement through the Suns. \u201cIt is a tremendous opportunity with a talented group of players and a loyal fan base.

Whether it\u2019s moving speeches delivered to his own team or pleading with television audiences to stand up and take notice of the splendid compilation of talent the franchise has stockpiled in recent years, he refuses to let up. From building the legend of Jamal Murray or waxing poetic about the virtues of Nikola Jokic, the nimble giant prone to triple-doubles on the regular, Malone is prepared to use the bully pulpit to make sure no one overlooks the Nuggets. A seven-game series win over San Antonio in the first round produced some of Malone\u2019s best stuff to date, including him trumpeting Jokic as not only a legitimate Kia MVP candidate (true, this season) but also a surefire future Hall of Famer (could be, the way he\u2019s playing). So you had to know Malone was going to be on his Nuggets informercial grind after they refused to lose Sunday in Portland, bouncing back after losing a grueling four-overtime thriller to the Trail Blazers here Friday night with a gritty 116-112 triumph to tie this series at 2-2 headed back to Denver for Tuesday\u2019s critical Game 5. \u201cI\u2019m so proud of our group,\u201d Malone said, after his talented crew showed off the chops needed to regain the homecourt advantage they surrendered in their Game 2 loss at Pepsi Center. \u201cAnd in the closing moments, I really was confident because in close games this year we were 13-3 [in games] decided by three points or less, best record in the NBA. We\u2019re 12-1 in the second nights of back-to-backs, best record in the NBA. Our guys are tough; to come in here and win this game some 36 hours after losing a four-overtime game speaks to just how tough we are. So I wasn\u2019t worried, we had our starting group out there. \u201cJamal, who I thought was phenomenal tonight, goes 11-for-11 from the foul line in a hostile environment and really kind of with the series hanging in the balance. You go down 1-3, and we all know how that story ends. I think the confidence of doing the same thing in the first round against San Antonio helped us, but our guys stepped up. We never frayed. We stayed together. And I can\u2019t speak enough about the resiliency and toughness of our team.\u201d And he shouldn\u2019t. The Blazers had won 12 straight games at home dating back to the regular season and were 22-2 on their home floor since January 5. When the Nuggets saw their 10-point lead shrink to just a point with 3:02 to play as Portland closers Damian Lillard (28 points) and C.J. McCollum (29) led the charge, Denver could have easily folded up under the emotional weight of Game 3 and their current predicament. But they proved to be as resilient and tough as Malone said they were. Jokic was brilliant again, collecting his fourth triple-double (21 points, 12 rebounds and 11 assists) in his first postseason, second only to the five Magic Johnson piled up during his rookie season with the Los Angeles Lakers. And Murray was even better, finishing with a game-high 34 points and draining six straight free throws in the frantic closing seconds to seal the win for a Nuggets team that didn\u2019t allow fatigue, a raucous and sellout Moda Center crowd or the pressure to avoid that 3-1 hole rattle them. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the first time,\u201d Murray said of his embrace of the pressure with the game on the line at the line. \u201cI think free throws are my thing. My dad and I do a lot of training [on] free throws. Blindfolded, he\u2019ll talk to me just like how the crowd is, put pressure on me. I take 1,000 free throws in practice to make or or two \u2026 and tonight, it ended up being six.\u201d The number Malone focused on afterwards was 11, as in the number of playoff games Murray and Jokic have played in as they continue to establish themselves as postseason stars. \u201cYou think about how young we are and and what we are doing, going on the road and winning a tough game in a hostile environment,\u201d Malone said, \u201cand for Jamal to be the centerpiece of that has been phenomenal. If you\u2019re a Denver Nuggets fan, how excited are you about this team now. More importantly, how excited are you for our future? We have a chance to be a really good team for many, many years and Jamal is going to be a big part of that.\u201d The same goes for Jokic, obviously. He\u2019s already an All-Star and is going to end up on the All-NBA first or second team as well as the top five of the voting for Kia MVP after the regular season he put together. That might explains why the entire Nuggets bench froze as they watched him limp to the sideline in the final moments after being kneed in the leg in the final seconds. \u201cYour heart skips a beat,\u201d Malone said. \u201cNikola is the face of our franchise, but he just got kneed, it was nothing serious and and we were able to hold on for the win.\u201d For all of Malone\u2019s bluster about his group, it\u2019s not even necessary at this stage of the season. The Nuggets earned the No. 2 seed in the Western Conference playoff chase on the strength of a talented and deep roster that might not resonate with casual NBA fans, but is celebrated by those in the know. Touting their accomplishments in real time makes sense for a coach trying to empower his team to believe in themselves in what could and perhaps should be a nice stretch of playoff runs in the future. But anyone paying attention can tell that the future could be now for these Nuggets. A trip to the conference finals one year after they failed to make the postseason field on the final night of the season in what amounted to a play-in game in Minneapolis last April, is a hell of a start. Malone knows it. His team knows it. And so do the Trail Blazers, who are well aware of the opportunity they squandered in a series where wavering confidence by the Nuggets might have been the only advantage they could exploit. \u201cThe good thing for us is that we won a game on their court,\u201d Lillard said. \u201cSo it\u2019s not like we lose both games there. We\u2019re in a good space, 2-2, we know we\u2019re capable of winning on their floor and that\u2019t what we\u2019ve got to get done. Obviously, it\u2019s disappointing \u2026 we didn\u2019t want to let an opportunity like this slip, but it happens. It\u2019s playoff basketball and we\u2019ve got to move forward.\u201d So do the Nuggets, which is where Malone the master motivator comes into play. And just so we\u2019re clear about something, his sell job is genuine. He knows of what he speaks in assessing a young team on the rise, having spent time coaching in Cleveland and Golden State during the formative stages with what would turn out to be teams that made it to The Finals (2007 in Cleveland). He was on Mark Jackson\u2019s Warriors staff when they turned the corner from a lottery team to playoff outfit (2012-13 season), helping nurture the core group of a team that has won three of the past four NBA titles and become a potential dynasty that no one saw coming at the time. So if Malone sees special things in his current team, it\u2019s his responsibility to shout about it every now and then, both to the basketball public and especially internally. Youngsters like Jokic and Murray, Gary Harris and Malik Beasley, Torrey Craig and Mont Morris and even veterans like Paul Millsap, Mason Plumlee and Game 4 hero Will Barton, who knocked down huge shots to help seal the deal, need to hear the positive reinforcement from their coach. And that\u2019s not even taking into account what absorbing these moments means for Michael Porter Jr., who is spending his rookie season recovering from back surgery, and is certainly going to be a part of that bright future Malone is so passionate about. If anything, this Nuggets team is ahead of schedule, two wins shy of a trip to the Western Conference finals with three games to play. Two of those are coming on their home floor, where Denver compiled the best record (34-7) in the league during the regular season. Maybe Malone is right to speak the Nuggets\u2019 success into existence rather than wishing and hoping for it to come to fruition without a word otherwise. But he won\u2019t have to go all car salesmen on the final day of month much longer. A couple more performances like the one the Nuggets put on Sunday and this whole thing, the refurbished franchise with all the boxes checked on the roster \u2014 now and for the foreseeable future \u2014 sells itself. * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

They would be better served, however, getting guard Kyrie Irving back. The Irving who led Boston to its victory on the Bucks\u2019 court in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference semifinals series was the latest, greatest iteration of the six-time All-Star point guard. Irving scored 26 points, passed for 11 assists and showed such maturity in orchestrating Boston\u2019s attack that, even for a guy who has been on the national stage as long as he has, it seemed like some sort of breakthrough performance. That guy, though, exited this series some time in the 48 hours before Game 2. Kryie 3.0 became Kyrie uh-oh. Irving\u2019s play looked rushed, detached and not at all mature. After hitting 12-of-21 shots in the series opener, he shot a combined 12-of-40 in Games 2 and 3 as the Celtics dropped both. They gave back the homecourt edge they had snatched with the opening victory and now need to win Monday just to force a best-of-three mini-series with two in Milwaukee. Irving had a plus\/minus rating of minus-26 in the two Celtics defeats. And most disconcerting, the player who arguably is the NBA\u2019s best at making difficult shots seemed bent on making his shots difficult. Too often he went solo, didn\u2019t probe for something better, didn\u2019t spot or even look for another option. Irving and Boston coach Brad Stevens had a conversation off to the side after the Celtics\u2019 practice Sunday afternoon of moderate length. Afterward, each spoke with reporters. The point guard wouldn\u2019t share what they discussed, while the coach deftly sidestepped the question. \u201cWe just wanted to spend 15 minutes talking about the objection of the Kentucky Derby,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cHow that could possibly have happened. And so we just created a conversation as long as the objection, and that\u2019s what we discussed in great detail.\u201d Not likely. Stevens probably talked with Irving about some of the things the coach had said to reporters Saturday and Sunday: the need for the Celtics not to settle and not to succumb to whatever chaos Milwaukee\u2019s defense was instigating by getting chaotic themselves. For two days, answering various questions, Stevens has steered the discussion to Boston moving the ball as the surest way to high-quality shots. \u201cOne of the things that we have to do as a team is just make those right reads off the first drive,\u201d Stevens said, \u201cand then go from there. We do have to do a better job of getting the ball to the second side of the floor, to the third side of the floor, and hopefully that includes as many paint attacks as possible.\u201d The Bucks\u2019 unveiled a switching style of defense in Game 2, something they hadn\u2019t done much all season. Too often, Irving\u2019s eyes lit up seeing center Brook Lopez or forward Nikola Mirotic isolated in front of him, and the tunnel vision that triggered didn\u2019t even generate the best shots for Irving. Too seldom, the Celtics failed to get Milwaukee\u2019s defense shifting left-to-right, and back again. \u201cWe have to make sure we\u2019re patient in getting the best looks,\u201d Stevens said Sunday. \u201cThat patience doesn\u2019t mean you ease into it. You have to work really hard and be patient against these guys. Because they do a great job of covering up the paint.\u201d Celtics players made only 9-of-19 attempts inside 5 feet, a feeble rate by NBA standards. Lopez has been one of the league\u2019s best defending the rim this season, and Giannis Antetokounmpo has the mobility to guard his man away from the hoop and still help inside. Admirably, Irving has been willing to shoulder responsibility, flatly stating after the Game 2 loss: \u201cThis is what I signed up for. This is what Boston traded for me for.\u201d After each game, he has given detailed breakdowns of what\u2019s gone right, what\u2019s gone wrong and, most important, what he planned to do in the next game. It\u2019s just that his most recent results haven\u2019t matched his pledges. The Celtics have more talent than the Bucks, and more players capable of carrying them offensively through a game or just a pivotal stretch. But those scorers, from Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown to Al Horford and Gordon Hayward, are dependent on Irving finding them and delivering the ball in a rhythm. Admittedly, Boston has to cinch things up defensively. Averaging 110 points ought to be enough, if you\u2019re not getting blistered at a 39-percent rate from 3-point range while sending your opponents to the free throw line an average of 30 times nightly. Irving blamed all those stoppages for stealing transition opportunities and generally messing with the Celtics\u2019 offense. Even so, he must do what Stevens calls \u201ccontrolling the controllables\u201d and be his best self. He has gotten the better of his individual matchup with Milwaukee point guard Eric Bledsoe, but that\u2019s not enough. And yes, this is what he signed up for. The great unknowns of this offseason, as in Irving\u2019s future whereabouts, could swing wildly on what happens in the coming days. And what he makes happen. \u201cI\u2019ve got to be me. That\u2019s the easy part,\u201d Irving said Sunday. \u201cThe same mindset that I\u2019ve always had. Being aggressive. Being patient. Being able to be aware of the time of the game and where I need to make my impact. Being able to be in the right defensive positions and being able to communicate with my teammates as well. \u201cThat\u2019s the easy part though. That\u2019s the fun part, if you go out there and just allow the flow of the game to dictate your instincts.\u201d * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

The Raptors prevailed in Game 4, a 101-96 victory that evened the series at 2-2, because Kawhi Leonard continues to play absurd basketball. Sunday\u2019s damage: 39 points, 14 rebounds and five assists, along with the biggest shot of the series so far, a pull-up 3-pointer over Joel Embiid at the shot-clock buzzer that put the Raptors up 94-90 with 1:01 to go. Through four games, Leonard is averaging 38 points on a ridiculous effective field goal percentage of 69 percent. That effective field goal percentage, with more than half (51\/89) of his shots having come from outside the paint, is better than anybody in the league shot on at least 300 field goal attempts this season \u2013 with the top seven guys being bigs who took almost all of their shots in the paint. \u201cThe stuff that he can do to create his own shot,\u201d said Sixers coach Brett Brown, \u201cis Kobe-like for me. He\u2019s just so gifted in relation to doing that.\u201d Nobody else on the Raptors has an effective field goal percentage that even reaches the league average (52.4 percent) in the series. Pascal Siakam (50.0 percent) is the closest , but was clearly suffering from his bruised right calf on Sunday, shooting 2-for-10, including 0-for-7 outside the restricted area. So, with or without a healthy Siakam, Raptors\u2019 coach Nick Nurse has been searching for answers \u2013 \u201cYou\u2019re looking for some type of spark,\u201d he said pre-game \u2013 someone or something he could count on, knowing that Leonard could not beat the Sixers by himself. Patrick McCaw was introduced to the non-garbage-time portion of the series on Sunday, but the big change for Toronto in Game 4 was Toronto playing \u2026 big. Since the start of this season, Serge Ibaka has almost exclusively played center. After starting alongside Jonas Valanciunas each of the last two seasons, Ibaka played just 13 total minutes with Valanciunas before the trade deadline. After Valanciunas was dealt to Memphis for Marc Gasol, Ibaka and Gasol played just 31 regular-season minutes together . Through eight playoff games, Ibaka and Gasol were on the floor together for just three total minutes . And through the first three games of this series, they had each shot 6-for-20 , with Ibaka registering a minus-17 in his 49 minutes. But with 5:27 to go in the first quarter on Sunday, Ibaka checked in for Siakam instead of Gasol. And it wasn\u2019t just about Siakam\u2019s injury, because the starting power forward played almost 29 minutes on Sunday, including a couple of minutes in a do-or-die fourth quarter with both Ibaka and Gasol on the floor and Leonard playing the two. When Siakam has sat, the Raptors have typically played Leonard or Norman Powell at the 4. On Sunday, Nurse chose to go big, quite an adjustment to make with the Raptors facing a 3-1 series deficit if it didn\u2019t work. \u201cTonight was one of those nights,\u201d Ibaka said, \u201cwhere we say, \u2018You know what? Even though we didn\u2019t have an opportunity to play together a long time, we\u2019re going to just try it out there.\u2019 We\u2019ve been playing basketball for so long. We\u2019re just going to try to figure it out and play hard.\u201d The two bigs played more than 23 minutes together on Sunday, with almost half of that coming in the fourth quarter, when the Raptors\u2019 season was seemingly on the line. The game was tied at 75 entering the fourth and Toronto was down four after the first few Philly possessions. But Nurse stuck with the two bigs and actually played them with Siakam and Leonard for a couple of minutes in that fourth quarter. The risk paid off. Ibaka and Gasol combined to hit three big shots, they spaced the floor well enough to let Leonard do his thing, and the Raptors held Philly to just 5-for-21 shooting in the final period to regain homecourt advantage in the series. \u201cThe biggest thing I felt tonight was the rebounding,\u201d Nurse said, of the bigs playing together. \u201cIt just felt like we were getting pushed around a lot by the glass the last two games. That would happen with our small lineup, they were just throwing it up there and revving their engines and flying to the rim. Tonight we just had more size, that way, and it kind of looked like the rebounds were affected by that.\u201d The Raptors\u2019 defensive rebounding wasn\u2019t any better in the Ibaka-Gasol minutes (when they grabbed 16 defensive rebounds and the Sixers\u2019 grabbed five offensive boards) that it was otherwise (19 and six). But it was better than having Siakam on the bench and a smaller power forward on the floor through the first four games (18 18 defensive rebounds , 10 Philadelphia  offensive boards ). With the rebounding improvement, the Sixers scored just 40 points on 44 possessions with Ibaka and Gasol on the floor together. They scored 56 points on 50 possessions otherwise. On the other end, Gasol (7-for-13) and Ibaka (6-for-12) each made as many shots as they had made through the first three games. It was just enough support for Leonard for the Raptors to get the biggest win of their season. \u201cHe\u2019s comfortable being a 5,\u201d Gasol said of Ibaka. \u201cI\u2019m able to play both positions a little bit. So it\u2019s simple. Defensively we mix it up, and the actions that they try to run we just need to figure out, and talk, and communicate and be on the same page, not just the two of us, but the whole team.\u201d Philly\u2019s output was affected by another ailment befalling Joel Embiid, who felt ill all day and shot just 2-for-7. The Sixers still outscored the Raptors by 17 points in Embiid\u2019s 35 minutes, but they were unable to survive the 13 minutes Embiid was on the bench: the Raptors won those handily, 33-11. \u201cWe\u2019re all going to look at what he shot from the floor, his free throws, whatever,\u201d Brown said of his center. \u201cCut to the chase, go to the bottom line, and look at his plus-minus. Despite him being ill and despite seven shots, or what he shot at the free throw line, and really his free throws were quite good up until the fourth period, he ends up a plus-17. It\u2019s just another reminder of how important he is to our team.\u201d Maybe that\u2019s the big story from this game. But Embiid\u2019s plus-17 breaks down to a plus-1 in the 20 minutes he played with both Ibaka and Gasol on the floor , and a plus-16 in fewer than 15 minutes against just one of two. The NBA playoffs are different than the 82-game grind of the regular season. Sometimes, they require something that you\u2019ve never done before. In Game 4 on Sunday, the Raptors went big for the first time this season and, as Nurse put it, \u201cdid just enough\u201d to get a crucial victory. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

He\u2019s seen enough. The debate is closed and conquered, the election over and the firm conclusion has been reached, at least from where he stands. Kevin Durant \u201cis the best player in the world, the most skilled player in the world\u201d according to Kerr, who may be biased, but he didn\u2019t sound like it. Kerr said this not once, but four times in the last two weeks, just in case someone didn\u2019t get the message. It\u2019s hard to see where the Warriors\u2019 coach is going wrong. Durant is evidently on a mission to (a) win his third and perhaps final championship with the Warriors, and (1-a) become universally recognized as the singularly greatest force in the league, a distinction that means so much to him. To paraphrase Durant, y\u2019all know who he is by now. Durant is sitting at the mythical 50-40-90 threshold in the playoffs, the benchmark for shooting accuracy and efficiency from the floor, 3-point range and free-throw line. He\u2019s averaging 35 points in the postseason, 39 in the last seven games. He has two near-masterpieces, the 50-point closeout of the Clippers in the first round and 46 on the Rockets in Game 3 of this series . He\u2019s making contested jumpers from all over the floor and from all angles. There\u2019s really no defense for him. But when this series is over, James Harden hopes to change the conversation. If he does, that means (a) the Rockets will pull off a stunning comeback from being down two games, and (b) Harden out-dueled Durant in the process. Is either possible? Well, Harden might be the only player qualified to do so, even with a left eye that still looks like the Japanese flag. He managed to minimize if not eliminate that poked eye by chopping down the Warriors and pulling the Rockets within 2-1 of the series . \u201cI was just being aggressive,\u201d he said. \u201cI was in attack mode.\u201d He\u2019s attacking something else. Harden, too, wants exactly the same as his friend and former Oklahoma City teammate. A championship would be his first, so obviously that\u2019s paramount. The mantle of \u201cgame\u2019s greatest player\u201d is also desired because Harden believes the last four years bear that out. In that span, he won the MVP award and finished runner-up twice, better than anyone. Of course, the missing prize is the championship, which is the final and most authentic validation, and this season at least he must go through Durant to achieve that. Harden\u2019s postseason hasn\u2019t been as stellar as Durant\u2019s, although perhaps Game 3 marked a shift. Harden scored 41 points and sent the Warriors home on a step-back 3-pointer in the final seconds of overtime. He and the Rockets are bringing a fresh sense of confidence and also have Game 4 in their house. Sending this series all square back to Oakland wouldn\u2019t be beyond his or their abilities. \u201cIn `Harden World,\u2019 that was good, but he can play better,\u201d said Rockets coach Mike D\u2019Antoni. \u201cThat\u2019s James. That\u2019s what he does.\u201d There\u2019s a growing sense among the Warriors, and with some justification, that Harden\u2019s bloody eye is no longer an issue. Harden\u2019s vision was pure when it counted two nights ago and every day brings him a step closer to normalcy, if he isn\u2019t already there. \u201cI think he\u2019s good to go,\u201d said D\u2019Antoni. The other concern for Golden State: Harden\u2019s beginning to figure out the rotations and the Warriors\u2019 defensive scheme. They know Harden adapts quickly to defenders and their tendencies because, at this point, he\u2019s seen it all. Harden is a tough cover because of his shooting range and unwillingness to lose confidence after a string of misses, and his craftiness off the dribble while attacking the rim. \u201cHe had 41 points and it was a good chess game,\u201d said Andre Iguodala. \u201cHe made some really tough shots. Some shots, where you pat him on the butt, and you say \u2018helluva shot\u2019. I felt like it was a little bit of cat and mouse. A guy like that \u2014 you can\u2019t stop him one on one. The defense did a good job of helping off and stopping him. We just have to try to make it hard as possible for him.\u201d The nightmare game for the Warriors is Harden hitting enough early baskets and forcing them to double, then finding teammates for open looks that they make, such as Eric Gordon. In that scenario, points would come in an avalanche and place stress on the defense and possibly get key players into foul trouble, most notably Draymond Green and a suddenly-foul-prone Steph Curry. There\u2019s also an intriguing subplot in the works: The Harden-Durant can-you-top-this drama. With Curry and Chris Paul both performing below their standards in this series, the series seems fixated on Harden and Durant and what they\u2019re capable of doing to the other team and, by extension, against each other. There\u2019s a genuine and hefty amount of respect between the two, who are friends away from the floor as well. Both left OKC and have since generated millions in endorsement money and find themselves near or at the top of the superstar pecking order. Durant has what Harden doesn\u2019t, a championship. But perhaps Harden has what Durant craves, a team to call his own. That would be the only reason Durant leaves the Warriors in free agency this summer, because it\u2019s difficult to imagine him signing with a team that offers a better chance to win championships or make more in salary than the one he\u2019s already on. Durant earned more points with Harden a few days ago when he defended the Rockets guard, saying Harden doesn\u2019t \u201ccheat the rules\u201d when he tries to draw fouls and manipulate the referees. Durant added: \u201cHe can do everything. If you\u2019re not focused, he can drive past you, hit you with the shoulder because he\u2019s strong, and finish with either hand. He can shoot floaters now. Obviously the step-back 3-pointer is one of his staples, but I never believed he was just a free throw guy. He can score in a variety of ways.\u201d Harden must prove that in this series. Last season in the Western Conference finals, he turned to vapor as that series stretched seven games. He made just 24 percent from deep and, after Paul suffered a hamstring pull in Game Five, couldn\u2019t handle the load. In the elimination game, he missed 11-of-13 from deep. Durant, meanwhile, was the star and weeks later would clinch another title and Finals MVP award, outplaying LeBron James in the process. So Kerr\u2019s contention about Durant has much weight and credibility. Through three games of this second-round series, there\u2019s been no reason to question the coach\u2019s claim. Only one person can flip that perception and create doubt. James Harden, therefore, has a tough job ahead. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

While his teammates dressed quickly and left both the room and a bitter memory behind them, he stayed on a stationary bike and pedaled in silence, knees pumping, sweat pouring, eyes unblinking. If looks and posture could kill, then Stephen Curry would have slayed the Houston Rockets on Saturday night instead of that wide-open layup he murdered. And that clear path dunk he butchered. Nothing he could do about it now, so he attacked the bike instead, pedaling fast and going nowhere. And that is the point of contention now in this suddenly suspenseful second-round series: Where does Curry go from here, with a shot that seems shockingly ordinary for him, and how much is his dislocated finger to blame? Maybe the Golden State Warriors, up 2-1 on Houston , get by the Rockets anyway because Kevin Durant remains in another galaxy. Yet in the long run, a dislocated finger, even if it\u2019s on his non-shooting hand, is nothing to play with. Literally and figuratively. Curry has yet to put his stamp on this series and his fingerprints were suspiciously missing again when the Warriors could not put away the hungrier and more desperate Rockets, losing 126-121 . Sure, James Harden\u2019s bloodshot eyes turned rose colored and he dropped 41 points, including the closeout buckets (but you knew that was coming). And Eric Gordon supplied 30 points, and perhaps you saw that as possible. And P.J. Tucker chopped wood in the paint and led an offensive rebound onslaught. OK, fine. But Steph needing 23 shots to score 17 points? Oh, and there was this: Curry in overtime took only two shots and not only did he miss them, those misses were greeted by snickers at Toyota Center. The first was a blown layup that wasn\u2019t challenged at the rim. It was taken with his left and of course prompted the obvious question. \u201cI just got to make those,\u201d he said, deflecting any lingering finger issues but not dismissing it. \u201cIf I\u2019m out there playing, I gotta produce.\u201d The other was an uncontested dunk that went doink . That layup was crucial because the Warriors were down only three with 1:49 left. The dunk was rather meaningless at that point, with 19 seconds left and the crowd still buzzing after Harden\u2019s game-clinching, stepback 3-pointer. It basically served as a snapshot of Curry\u2019s night. \u201cI was feeling good, had a nice head of steam and probably a little frustration, too,\u201d said Curry about the missed dunk. \u201cIt was not my finest moment.\u201d You can brush this all aside as the Rockets were fighting for their playoff lives, and still needed overtime on their home court to grab a win despite a sub-par Warriors performance, and that would be well and reasonable. Still, it doesn\u2019t mask the greater issue here with regard to the Warriors. Curry hasn\u2019t looked Curry-level sharp all postseason and his left fingers are taped. When does this all become a \u201cthing\u201d, and will Curry\u2019s woes \u2014 again, this is all relative, because he hasn\u2019t exactly cratered \u2014 become costly? At some point, the Warriors might go a game or two with Durant cooling off and managing \u201conly\u201d 25 or so points and will need some assistance from the game\u2019s greatest shooter \u2014 assuming Durant hasn\u2019t wrestled that distinction from Curry. For now anyway, and at least publicly, they don\u2019t appear particularly worried about that. \u201cHe just had a tough night,\u201d said Warriors coach Steve Kerr. \u201cEverybody, no matter how good you are, you\u2019re going to have some bad games. It was just a tough night for him. It didn\u2019t happen.\u201d Yet this was the same coach who insisted last week, after the last mild effort from Curry, that \u201cSteph will come back strong and have a big game\u201d and that didn\u2019t happen, and still hasn\u2019t happened. The Warriors are waiting, the Rockets are bracing, and certainly the basketball world is expecting something splashy \u2026 soon. And it\u2019s coming, perhaps by Monday\u2019s Game 4. Isn\u2019t it? \u201cI know I\u2019ll be ready,\u201d said Curry. In this postseason Curry is below average in scoring and 3-point shooting. The last three games he\u2019s shooting 36 percent. Curry has reached 30 or more points just once in nine playoff games. And in seven of those nine he failed to get 25 points. Again, much of this is being masked by Durant taking the load, although there will be a shift in concern if Curry misfires again Monday and the Rockets tie the series. As much as his teammates and coaches downplay it, Curry cannot and does not ignore the elephant in the room. He admitted as much when he said, regretfully: \u201cA couple more shots go my way tonight and this game would be different.\u201d That sounds like a star who knows he isn\u2019t on the high level he created for himself. Curry rode the exercise bike to burn off frustration, and the mental demons will likely live in his head at least overnight. \u201cObviously thinking about what I can do better to elevate my game, and I\u201dm looking forward to Monday,\u201d he said. The opportunity to go up 3-0 was wasted along with 46 points from Durant and a triple-double from Draymond Green and timely baskets by Andre Iguodala, whose 3-pointer gave Golden State its final lead before Big Game James took over and Curry crashed. Evidently Harden\u2019s eye is no longer a problem, at least not functionally. Cosmetically is a different issue. \u201cHe look crazy,\u201d cracked Chris Paul. It just wasn\u2019t Curry gone cold; his backcourt partner Klay Thompson had empty stretches. It\u2019s not a good sign for the Warriors when Iman Shumpert hits more 3-pointers than Thompson or Curry. And so there is one win separating the Rockets and Warriors and the next game is at Toyota Center. Stranger things have happened in basketball, even in these playoffs, where the Warriors blew a 31-point lead and also dropped a pair of games to the eight-seeded Clippers. Perhaps weirdest of all is the sight and sound of Curry clanking. If this was a two- or three-game fling, then fine, it happens to the best. But for a player who has a pair of regular-season MVP awards but no Finals MVP, Curry is still looking for his Kevin Durant playoff run, the one where he leaves no doubt, only bodies in his wake. You can argue if this has yet to happen in his career. There is no arguing whether this has happened this spring. It hasn\u2019t. Curry has both a dislocated left middle finger and a hairline fracture of the jumper. Again, for anyone else, what Curry has done in nine playoff games is fine, even solid. For Curry, this is alarming. The only mark that he has put on this series is on the rim, where a bit of orange paint is missing, no thanks to a dunk that captured the plight of a player in search of a magical shot. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

Their season isn\u2019t over if they lose Game 4 of their Eastern Conference semifinals series with the Philadelphia 76ers on Sunday ( 3:30 p.m. ET, ABC ), but this is as pivotal as a Game 4 can get. A win draws the Raptors even at 2-2, with two of the last three games in Toronto. A loss puts them in a 3-1 hole that few teams have climbed out of. Most of the Toronto rotation has played in bigger games. Kawhi Leonard, Danny Green and Serge Ibaka have all played in The Finals. Marc Gasol, Kyle Lowry and Norman Powell, meanwhile, have played in the conference finals. But this is a new level of stress for a new group and a new head coach. In a series between two teams that went all-in for this season, the Raptors are the first to come face-to-face with their own mortality. To win on Sunday, the Raptors will need to slow down the Sixers\u2019 best player while providing more help for their own. And they may have to do it without Pascal Siakam, who is listed as doubtful for Game 4 with a right calf contusion. In this series, Leonard and Siakam have combined to average 61 points per game . All other Raptors have combined to averaged just 36.3. After Game 1, it was easy to point out the flaws of the Sixers\u2019 rotation. Three of their five starters couldn\u2019t guard Leonard, and their bench was painfully shallow. But two games later, the Sixers have never looked better (or more cohesive) and it\u2019s the Raptors that seem terminally flawed, especially on offense, where they\u2019ve scored less than 97 points per 100 possessions over Games 2 and 3. For the series, Toronto is down to 101.4 points scored per 100 possessions, the worst mark in the conference semis and down from their rate of 111.5 per 100 in the first round . The Raptors have a higher free throw rate than they did in the first round . They\u2019ve turned the ball less often than they did against Orlando and their offensive rebounding percentage has only dropped a bit. Their offensive struggles have been mostly about the biggest drop in effective field goal percentage from the first round (55.0 percent) to the conference semis (48.4 percent). Two key areas on the floor have hurt the Raptors: The Raptors\u2019 shooting issues begin early in the shot clock. In the regular season, Toronto averaged a league-best 1.19 points per possession in transition , according to Synergy tracking. That number is down to just 1.01 points per possession in the playoffs , with only Orlando and Oklahoma City having scored less efficiently in transition. The Raptors\u2019 transition issues haven\u2019t begun in the conference semis. They scored 86 points on 85 transition possessions (1.01) in the first round and have scored 62 on 62 (1.00 per) against the Sixers. But they have shot worse early in the clock than they did against Orlando. According to Second Spectrum tracking, the Raptors\u2019 have an effective field goal percentage of just 43.6 percent in the first six seconds of the shot clock in the conference semis, down from 54.1 percent in the first round and 63.1 percent (the league\u2019s second best mark) in the regular season. Effective field goal percentage is typically highest in the first six seconds of the clock, but for the Raptors in this series, it\u2019s been lower than it\u2019s been in the middle 12 seconds (49.7 percent) or in the last six seconds of the clock (48.9 percent). Credit the Sixers and their size. Most of those 2-point misses in the first six seconds of the clock have been contested layups. The Raptors have shot just 55.4 percent at the rim when there\u2019s been a Sixer there to defend it . The Raptors clearly need more from Leonard\u2019s supporting cast, especially if Siakam can\u2019t play on Sunday. And the obvious culprits in regard to lack of offensive production are Kyle Lowry and Marc Gasol. Through Friday\u2019s games, there were 39 players with at least 100 touches in the conference finals, and while Leonard led the 39 with 0.604 points per touch , Gasol (0.132) and Lowry (0.130) ranked 35th and 36th. Fred VanVleet (0.040) ranked last. The all need to shoot better. Through three games, Lowry has shot 36 percent, Gasol has shot 30 percent, and VanVleet is 1-for-11. They also might need to get more touches. According to Second Spectrum, Lowry has averaged 33 front-court touches per 36 minutes in the conference semis, down from 42 per 36 in the first round. Gasol has averaged 41, down from 46. And VanVleet has averaged 23 per 36, down from 37 per 36 in the first round. Leonard has had the ball a lot more than usual. He has averaged 5.0 minutes of possession against Philly, up from 3.9 in the first round and 4.0 in the regular season .

Back and forth they went, the Portland Trail Blazers and Denver Nuggets, in these Western Conference semifinals from a sun-soaked at the start Moda Center Friday evening until nearly midnight and into the early morning hours Saturday. Four grueling overtimes, filled with enough gasp-inducing moments, enough emotionally jarring plays for both teams to win or lose this game a dozen times over. And that\u2019s exactly what it felt like when the longest playoff game of the shot-clock era was over. Let the record show that Seth Curry\u2019s free throws with 2.8 seconds to play sealed the deal for the Trail Blazers in the final seconds of a wild 140-137 win, the NBA\u2019s first four-overtime playoff game since 1953. But it was the fresh legs and smooth flick of the left wrist of Rodney Hood that provided the crease of separation the Trail Blazers needed to finally end this marathon game, the 3,986th playoff game in NBA history, by the way, a game Nuggets coach Michael Malone dubbed an \u2018instant classic.\u201d Could there have been a more unlikely hero for the Trail Blazers, who now own a 2-1 lead in this series with Game 4 looming Sunday afternoon, than Hood? Or a bigger scapegoat than Denver superstar big man Nikola Jokic, who with an opportunity to tie the game with 5.6 seconds left, missed the first of two free throws? \u201cIn that moment, you don\u2019t think you are tired or how much you have played,\u201d Jokic said after logging a mind-boggling 65 minutes. \u201cYou just want to give everything you\u2019ve got in that moment. You don\u2019t think about the exhaustion or how tired you are.\u201d When you own the trust of your coaches and teammates, when you believe and trust in each other the way the Blazers clearly do, you rise to the magnitude of the moment the way Hood did. So maybe it does make sense, that he came through the way he did. In fact, it might have been the only thing that made any sense on the wildest night yet of this NBA postseason. \u201cI just felt pretty good,\u201d Hood said. \u201cI was telling Gary Trent that if I got the chance, I was going to make it. They bring me in to be a fresh hand, and I can make a difference. So I was excited to go back in the fourth overtime.\u201d Hood\u2019s pull-up 14-footer with 1:07 to play in that fourth overtime tied the game at 133-133. A 12-footer with 44.9 to play put the Blazers up 135-134 after Will Barton, the Nuggets\u2019 fresh-legged alternative, made one of two free throws to put the Nuggets ahead seconds earlier. Hood\u2019s dagger with 18.6 seconds left and the Blazers down 136-135 after a Paul Millsap hook put the Nuggets ahead again. Hood stroked his spot-up 26-footer with the confidence of a player who was built for these magical moments, guys like Blazers\u2019 stars Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum, who had no problem deferring to Hood or anyone else given the fatigue the starters on both sides were experiencing four overtimes in. \u201cIt\u2019s up there, it\u2019s one of the biggest moments and obviously it\u2019s the playoffs,\u201d Hood said in regards to where his big shot ranks on his personal all-time list. \u201cI\u2019ve hit game-winners and big shots before, but this one means a lot, especially going back into the game after being out for a while.\u201d For a player like Hood, whose personal redemption tour fits perfectly with the redemptive ride these Blazers are on in this postseason, the timing couldn\u2019t have been better. The Blazers were swept out of the playoffs in the first round last season and the season before, so their grind to try to reach the conference finals this season is real. Hood, meanwhile, was in Cleveland this time a year ago, making headlines for all the wrong reasons. He infamously refused to check into Game 4 of the Cavaliers\u2019 series against Toronto, unhappy with his fit and role after being traded from Utah in February to a LeBron James-led team that would make The Finals for a fourth straight season. Having a chance to come through in the clutch Friday night was a completely different feeling for Hood, who joined this crew after a February trade that sent Nik Stauskas , Wade Baldwin and second-round picks in 2021 and 2023 to Cleveland in the exchange. \u201cIt means a lot,\u201d Hood said. \u201cI stayed patient. I didn\u2019t get down on myself even when a lot of people did \u2026 trusting God, I just didn\u2019t give up, didn\u2019t give up on myself. I just kept playing, kept working. I had no idea I\u2019d end up in Portland in this type of situation. But to be here and to have my family in the crowd. I saw all the sad faces the last go-around, so to be here is very emotional for me, to be quite frank. Got a lot more basketball to get through right now. A lot more basketball to go.\u201d That\u2019s hard to imagine after living through the second quadruple overtime game in NBA history, the first since 1953. Jokic played a game-high 65 minutes; only three players in NBA history have played more minutes in a postseason game \u2014 Red Rocha (67), Paul Seymour (67) and Bob Cousy (66) in that 1953 four-overtime game. But Jamal Murray also played 55, Millsap 49 and Gary Harris nearly 50 before fouling out after a night of stellar defense on Lillard. McCollum led the Blazers in minutes (franchise-record 60) and points (41), while Lillard logged 58 minutes, Enes Kanter 57 (with that busted shoulder), Al-Farouq Aminu 47 and Maurice Harkless 45. The wear and tear, physically and emotionally, was on full display after the game. That goes for the players and the coaches alike, not to mention the roller-coaster ride the sellout crowd went through with each and every exhilarating and deflating moment inside the building. \u201cI have no idea what happened in the first half, the second half, or the first three overtimes,\u201d Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. \u201cRodney Hood came in and played great. It was a hell of a game. I\u2019ve never been involved in a game like that, regular season or playoffs, but it was an amazing effort by both teams.\u201d Stotts\u2019 decision to go to Hood in that fourth overtime wasn\u2019t necessarily coaching genius either. It was also a product of the collective fatigue of the starters playing wicked minutes. \u201cMo was cramping up a little bit,\u201d Stotts said, \u201cso that was the reason for the substitution. But we did go to Hood a couple times. Obviously, the 3-point shot was a scramble situation. CJ had a great play, but we did go to Hood because we liked the matchup a couple of times and he had fresh legs.\u201d And he had the trust of his teammates, the guys who had to facilitate in the heat of the moment to provide Hood\u2019s chance to play the hero. Lillard is as dialed in a leader as there is in this league. He knew exactly what it meant when Hood came in and out during those overtimes periods and delivered the way he did. \u201cIt was huge,\u201d he said. \u201cLooking back at the first round, I don\u2019t think he had the kind of series that he wanted to have, but in the series we had different guys come in and come up big for the team. I think in this series, every game he\u2019s come in and given us a huge lift. I thought tonight was fitting that he was able to come through big for us and it was at a big time in the game. \u201cAt one point, we were down two and coach called a play for him and he scored it and the next time, I was like \u2018same play\u2019 and he looked at me like \u2018what are we doing?\u2019 And I was like, \u2018same thing, let\u2019s keep it rolling.\u2019 And he hit another one. I think that we he did for our team tonight was huge. Same thing in Game 2, but I think us trusting him and continuing to play through him in big moments, it made him feel that much better about that 3-pointer he shot. He rose up with confidence and hit a big shot, so it\u2019s been great to see him coming for the team, especially tonight.\u201d Tonight bled into this morning for the weary on both sides, and before you know it Sunday afternoon and Game 4 will be staring them all in the face. Like Stotts, Malone said he\u2019s not sure where he\u2019ll find the time to make sure his crew recovers properly and in time for what is essentially the most important game of the season for both teams. \u201cThey have the same turnaround,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, Kanter played 56, McCollum played 60 \u2026 we\u2019re talking about a playoff game and guys are playing 60 minutes. That\u2019s crazy. So yeah, you give them rest. You let them sleep in, you get them treatment, rehab, recovery \u2026 you try to learn from the loss and get ready to battle. Both teams are exhausted, so its the same for them as it is for us. We will not use that as an excuse. We haven\u2019t used it all year long and we won\u2019t start using it now.\u201d * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

They also sputtered through a stretch late in the game during which things most definitely went wrong. The list of happy things stretched long: Giannis Antetokounmpo was the best player on the floor and in Kia NBA MVP contention mode as he scored 32 points with 13 rebounds, eight assists and three blocks in Milwaukee\u2019s 123-116 victory over the Boston Celtics Friday night at TD Garden. Fans and viewers got a glimpse of the Bucks\u2019 scoring potency when, coming out of halftime, they posted the first 40-point quarter of this series. The defense that coach Mike Budenholzer demands was especially evident in limiting Boston to 14-of-36 shooting in the second half. Then there was Milwaukee\u2019s deep rotation and trust in reserves \u2013 guards George Hill (21 points) and Pat Connaughton (14) led their bench\u2019s 42-16 scoring advantage. The down side came near the end, when Milwaukee\u2019s late-game execution was so poor Budenholzer didn\u2019t even want to talk about it in front of the cameras and microphones afterward. He preferred to wait until Saturday, when he could directly address his players while they review video of Game 3. \u201cI\u2019ll save it for film tomorrow,\u201d Budenholzer said. \u201cIt\u2019s not very smart. It\u2019s not very good. That\u2019s the great thing for coaches \u2026 we\u2019ll find more things where we can get better. We just touched on one of them for sure.\u201d What happened was, the Bucks opened a fat lead \u2013 17 points in the fourth quarter \u2013 and squandered much of it. They did it in the most damaging way possible, too, by sending a parade of Celtics to the foul line to score with the game clock stopped. With 4:51 left Milwaukee was up 114-97, more than doubling the eight-point edge they held when the final period began. With 1:20 left, that lead was down to 118-111, whittled down by Jaylen Brown\u2019s fast-break layup and the Celtics\u2019 perfect 12-for-12 from the line in that stretch. Many of the fans at TD Garden were heading to the exits, even as the Bucks appeared to be heading for trouble. You wondered if some might wind up knocking to get back in, \u00e0 la the Miami fans who bailed on the Heat before Ray Allen\u2019s famous 3-pointer saved Game 6 of the 2013 Finals. Those late minutes of the fourth quarter seemed to last an eternity, and that was just for spectators and viewers. It felt twice that to the Bucks\u2019 players and coaches. \u201cIt was [long],\u201d said Pau Gasol, the veteran All-Star watching these days as an inactive player on Milwaukee\u2019s roster. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s part of the growth of this team, learning how to deal with those type of scenarios and situations.\u201d It wasn\u2019t just that the Bucks were burning through their lead. It\u2019s that Boston was energized watching their late scramble pay off. Al Horford sank six free throws in the run; Jayson Tatum, four; and Gordon Hayward, two. \u201cOn the road, that gets a little dicey,\u201d Connaughton said. \u201cWhenever a team gets a little life at the end of a game, especially when they cut a [17-point lead to seven], that\u2019s never a fun thing. But I think the way we were able to withstand it and make a bucket here or there to nullify what they were doing at the free throw line was good.\u201d Said Gasol: \u201cThe Celtics are trying to rush possessions, trying to rush you into bad decisions. So you have to be patient, hold the ball, understand the possessions and get a good shot. Don\u2019t turn it over. We didn\u2019t do a very good job of that at the end.\u201d Step by step, point by point, the Celtics were gaining hope. So \u2026 much \u2026 time \u2026 left. Gasol\u2019s analysis from the side? \u201cWe were very aggressive tonight defensively. And at the end, we weren\u2019t able to turn it down and play smarter. We kept that pressure on, and that led us to commit silly fouls or unnecessary fouls, and put them at the line when we didn\u2019t want them there. The experience in your brain has to tell you to be smarter.\u201d Milwaukee did manage a few high notes during the low period: Hill pounced on an offensive rebound to steal a basket. At 118-105, Antetokounmpo blocked Kyrie Irving\u2019s fast-break layup to save two points and stifle a sure crowd explosion. \u201cI don\u2019t think we were really concerned,\u201d said center Brook Lopez. \u201cWe just tried to keep our foot on the gas. Keep that intensity. They drew some fouls and made some free throws. And then they had the little funky 1-3-1 defense, whatever that was. They were trying to trap a little. We\u2019ll look at that [on film].\u201d This is not about nitpicking. This is about focusing on the growth still available to a Milwaukee team with lofty ambitions. Antetokounmpo was special. The Bucks were stingy enough on defense. But when they talked about playing their game for 48 minutes, they should have \u2018fessed up on the three-and-a-half of those that nearly bit them. The Celtics ran out of time \u2013 only 10.6 seconds remained when they got within five, 121-116. And Antetokounmpo, who missed six of his first 20 free throws, didn\u2019t miss his final pair. The Bucks, in essence, earned the ability to swoon by padding their lead early. But their close out was less than optimal, which is probably not how Budenholzer will put it in closed quarters. \u201cWe know they\u2019re not going to quit,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve just got to stick with it the entirety of the game. I know it\u2019s a boring answer, but Game 4, we\u2019ve got to do the same thing.\u201d Maybe not exactly the same."},{"id":33894,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/jokic-logs-65-minutes-quadruple-ot-loss","date":"2019-05-04","title":"Jokic logs 65 minutes in quadruple-OT loss","content":" Nuggets center Nikola Jokic logged a grueling 65 minutes in Friday\u2019s quadruple-overtime loss to the Trail Blazers, the fourth-most in NBA playoff history and the most since 1953.

Antetokounmpo shot a series-high 22 free throws in Friday\u2019s Game 3, converting 16 en route to 32 points as the Bucks triumphed, 123-116 , to take a 2-1 series lead.  That gave Antetokounmpo a whopping 50 free throws so far, with his single-game totals increasing each outing in a development Irving described as \u201cgetting ridiculous.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s just slowing the (expletive) game down,\u201d said Irving, who drew 12 free shots. \u201cHopefully we can even out the free throws, not just in the fourth quarter. The refs have a difficult job. We have a difficult job. I can sit up here and complain. We know the disparity and what it is. I\u2019m not going to put all the emphasis on the refereeing. \u201cWe know how many free throws (Antetokounmpo) has shot per game. He\u2019s a great player in our league. We know how many times he goes to the basket and gets contact. We also know how many times we got to the basket and get contact. When you get into the bonus with eight minutes left in the third, it\u2019s a shocker. \u201cThe officiating, we\u2019re going to leave them alone next game. We\u2019re going to do a better job of walling up and staying straight up, to make sure there aren\u2019t any eye-catching calls.\u201d Despite Antetokounmpo\u2019s massive total, the Bucks shot just four more total free throws in Game 3, 36-32. It was the same in Game 2, when Antetokounmpo took 18 foul shots and the Bucks held a 31-27 edge. Interestingly, the biggest disparity was Game 1, which the Celtics dominated despite being outshot 24-8 at the line. The key, however, was limiting Antetokounmpo \u2014 who has finished second behind Houston\u2019s James Harden in free throw attempts in each of the past two seasons \u2014 to \u201cjust\u201d 10 as he shot 7-for-21 from the floor. But Antetokounmpo\u2019s aggressiveness is illustrated via his series shot chart, with 37 of his 49 shots coming in the paint. That was especially the case in Game 3, when 12 of his 13 shots came at or near the rim. Which is probably why Celtics coach Brad Stevens, when asked to comment on Friday\u2019s officiating, took a hard pass.  \u201cI don\u2019t complain about officials,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a lot of stuff we have to do better. We focus on us and what we can control.

But before Maye could complete the play, Jaxson Hayes , Texas\u2019 6-foot-11 freshman center with a 7-foot-3 wingspan, made up about six feet of separation with one stride, left the floor outside the restricted area arc and pinned Mayes\u2019 shot against the backboard with two hands. \u201cJust the ferociousness and violence with which he blocked the shot,\u201d says Texas coach Shaka Smart, his voice trailing off as his mind pulled up the image of Maye wondering how the hell a sure basket had been snuffed out. \u201cIt was just one block. Just one play. But you were like, \u2018Yeah, he\u2019s gonna play in the NBA for a long time. It\u2019s just a matter of when.\u2019 \u201d Michigan State associate head coach Dwayne Stephens, who had been scouting the game because Texas was the Spartans\u2019 opponent the next day, seemed much more certain about Hayes\u2019 timetable when he ran into his good friend, former Texas associate head coach Darrin Horn. \u201cThe first words out of his mouth,\u201d says Horn, now the head coach at Northern Kentucky, \u201cwere \u2018Yeah, ya\u2019ll won\u2019t be able to keep him.\u2019 There were like 35 NBA scouts there. No question that was an ah-ha moment for everybody.\u201d Sure enough, there was more to come from Hayes. Texas under Smart has gotten the reputation of producing one-and-done big men \u2014 Jarrett Allen was the 22nd pick in the 2017 draft and Mo Bama was the No. 6 a year ago \u2014 and Hayes is going to join them after a season in which he averaged 10 points and five rebounds, was voted Big 12 Freshman of the Year, second-team All-Big 12 and chosen to the league\u2019s All-Freshman, All-Newcomer and All-Defensive teams. Hayes announced early last month after helping Texas win the NIT he was entering the NBA Draft, where, if the various mock drafts are any indication, he\u2019ll be a lottery pick. \u201cHe just kept getting better and better,\u201d Smart says. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to think he won\u2019t continue to do that.\u201d NBA scouts and general managers make their bones by judging potential. For every Kobe Bryant, LeBron James, or, in the 2019 Draft, Zion Williamson \u2014 can\u2019t miss prospects \u2014 there are countless others whose NBA futures have to be projected. Though Hayes earned all those accolades, he\u2019s not in Williamson\u2019s class \u2014 even though Hayes blocked one of Williamson\u2019s shots in an AAU game \u2014 and didn\u2019t leave behind a ton of gaudy statistics. \u201cClearly the NBA guys see the potential,\u201d Smart says. \u201cThis guy didn\u2019t have a double-double [in points and rebounds] all year. You can do the research, but I challenge you to find a 6-11 kid who\u2019s going to be a top-10 pick that never had a double-double. I\u2019m not saying that negatively. Some guys are picked for what they can do in a shorter term. The bigger they are, the longer they are, it\u2019s more about potential.\u201d Hayes did put up some impressive numbers. He finished third in the Big 12 in blocked shots. He shot 82.3 from the free-throw line (51-for-62) in league games. And he obliterated the Texas single-season record for field-goal percentage (72.8). Dexter Pittman shot 65.4 in 2009-10. Allen\u2019s success ratio from the floor was 72.9. Of course, Allen dunked a lot. Smart and Horn, who coached the Texas big men, kept things relatively simple for Hayes, in part because they thought they would have him longer and didn\u2019t want to overload him as a rookie. Hayes took only one jump shot all season. But the Texas coaches also knew they had a weapon in Hayes\u2019 athleticism. \u201cOf the three big kids we had the last three years, Jaxson is the best mover of the bunch,\u201d Horn says. \u201cJarrett\u2019s a terrific sprinter, but Jaxson is right there. Mo\u2019s skilled, he can shoot, and he\u2019s a really good passer. But in terms of being a basketball mover \u2014 quickness, sprinting, moving in space \u2026 being able to catch the ball on the roll and contort his body because a help defender has slid in front of him, stuff like that, he\u2019s the best mover of the bunch. The most athletically gifted.\u201d Texas teaches all its bigs to play on balance, to compete and to get in position to explode to the rim. Hayes didn\u2019t need much coaching on the latter point. \u201cWe had no idea how good he would be offensively from the standpoint of when he was rolling to the rim or on the move in transition,\u201d Horn says. \u201cHe could take the ball, and in one fluid motion flush it. Where most guys, even if they have good hands and can catch it, they have to gather themselves. Jaxson can catch that thing and get off the floor so quickly in stride before anyone knows what happened and be dunking on you.\u201d Besides the obvious, it\u2019s easy to see why NBA scouts have been intrigued by Hayes\u2019 potential. His father Jonathan played 12 seasons in the NFL as a 6-foot-5, 250-pound tight end. His mother Kristi played college basketball at Drake and in her senior season of high school in Iowa averaged 52 points. Hayes didn\u2019t follow in his mother\u2019s footsteps, at least not right away. He played football at famed Archbishop Moeller High School in Cincinnati until he grew so tall that, as a wide receiver, he was too big a target for opposing defensive backs. Switching to basketball seemed a more natural fit, but he wasn\u2019t instantly successful. Hayes didn\u2019t start as a junior and averaged about six minutes and two points a game. But his size and athleticism nevertheless attracted attention. The first school to offer a scholarship was Middle Tennessee State. Before he became the 2018-19 Southeastern Conference coach of the year at Ole Miss, Kermit Davis spent 16 years at Middle Tennessee, where he put together some great teams by having a keen eye for hidden talent. Davis remembers the first time he saw Hayes on film after getting tipped off by a friend in Ohio. Hayes had just completed his junior season. \u201cI watched two minutes of video, picked up the phone and called his high school coach and offered a scholarship,\u201d Davis says. Hayes and his father visited Middle Tennessee, and Davis and assistant coach Ronnie Hamilton had high hopes of nabbing Hayes before anyone else could. Then came summer AAU ball. \u201cWe were there for his first AAU game that spring when he played against Zion Williamson,\u201d says Hamilton, who\u2019s now on Davis\u2019 staff at Ole Miss. \u201cHe didn\u2019t score a lot but battled against Zion, ran the floor like a deer, rebounded the ball. Coach Davis and I said he was going to soar past the Conference USA level.\u201d Soar past it Hayes did. By the end of the summer, Hayes, who had barely played as a junior, had more than 40 scholarship offers, many from power conference schools. One of them was Texas. \u201cIt took me like 12 seconds,\u201d Horn says. \u201cI watched him run the floor, and then back down the floor on the other end, where he grabbed a ball that came off the rim kind of sideways \u2014 just launched up and grabbed one that nobody else on the floor could even come close to. I called Shaka and said \u2018Coach, just how this dude moves alone, yes, he\u2019s good enough.\u2019 \u201d Hayes and his family liked Smart and his coaches and were impressed by Texas\u2019 development of big men. Little did anyone realize how fast Hayes would develop and be gone for the NBA. But the signs were all around, even early in the season. \u201cAfter watching him a ton the spring and summer before his senior year of high school, I thought he would definitely be an NBA guy, but that it might take two or three years,\u201d Hamilton says. \u201cSo, I was a little surprised how quickly he adapted to the college game. I remember when I was scouting Georgia \u2014 Texas had played them \u2014 and watching film. I said to myself, \u2018Jaxson\u2019s a lottery guy now.\u2019\u201d So how far can Hayes progress in the NBA? Smart thinks a long way. \u201cIt\u2019s a very safe bet that he\u2019s going to have a ridiculous body [Hayes played at about 220 pounds this season] in the next three to five years,\u201d Smart says. \u201cHis dad is a mountain of a man. Obviously, the NBA people see that. \u201cAs far as his game, he\u2019s going to be able to make jumpers. He\u2019s going to put the ball on the floor. The way the NBA\u2019s going, he\u2019ll probably eventually shoot 3s. The kid\u2019s just a puppy. Who knows what he\u2019s capable of doing?\u201d * * * Chris Dortch is the editor of the Blue Ribbon College Basketball Yearbook .

They couldn\u2019t contain the Denver Nuggets\u2019 All-Star center in Game 1 of the Western Conference semifinals and paid for it. Jokic was at his dominating best, working from rim to rim, fishing with 37 points, nine rebounds six assists and two blocks. He backed up every word of Nuggets coach Michael Malone\u2019s declaration last week that Jokic, in his first postseason dip, has separated himself. \u201cIt\u2019s only strengthened my belief that he\u2019s a future Hall of Famer,\u201d Malone said then. \u201cHe\u2019s an All-NBA player, an MVP candidate. It\u2019s his first time in the playoffs and this guy is going out there and playing at an unbelievably high level.\u201d Whether or not Jokic can rise to another tonight is a question he and Malone must answer. The Nuggets need that from Jokic after the Blazers tweaked their defensive strategy on him to take Game 2 and home-court advantage in the series. They forced Jokic to operate from 3-point line to 3-point line for most of Game 2, limiting his effectiveness around the rim while allowing Enes Kanter to play him evenly. \u201cI thought we did really well just making him work,\u201d said Blazers star Damian Lillard, \u201cpicking him up higher so he\u2019s not just walking into their offense. When he\u2019s dribbling the ball up, pick him up and make him work. Don\u2019t just allow him to move at his own pace and play comfortable.\u201d Instead of leaving Kanter or any one defender to deal with Jokic and his gifted passing, the Blazers put an assortment of defenders in his way in Game 2. Kanter had help from Al Farouq-Aminu, Maurice Harkless (in the first half, before he turned his ankle) and Zach Collins. It wasn\u2019t that any one of them stopped Jokic, who even on a tough shooting night still had 16 points, 14 rebounds and seven assists. \u201cI thought we pressured him a little bit more,\u201d Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t give him the clean looks that he had in Game 1. Enes did a good job, Zach Collins had good minutes with him, individually. he got too many offensive rebounds, particularly in the fourth quarter. But I just didn\u2019t think we gave him the freedom to make the plays that he made in Game 1.\u201d The collective physicality, and the impact it had on Jokic and the Nuggets\u2019 rhythm (and lack thereof) was obvious. \u201cI thought they all had a huge impact on the game and just making him work,\u201d Lillard said. \u201cWhen he does get to the block, making him see bodies, stunting on the post, double-team him, having active hands when he is trying to make plays. When he\u2019s going up at the rim, contesting all his shots. If you\u2019re out of position, make him make those free throws. Don\u2019t just let him get the ball in. I thought over 48 minutes, we were there. We made him work the entire game and I thought it worked in our favor.\u201d Kanter certainly felt the difference. \u201cThe most important thing was just getting stops,\u201d Kanter said. \u201cHe thought it was going to be sweet and he\u2019s going to get his 35 every night, but we I think we knew just start the game very physical \u2026 you\u2019ve just got to give everything you have and sacrifice whatever you have\u201d Forcing Jokic out of his comfort zone and into a space where he must be a dominant scorer has produced mixed playoff results for Denver. Jokic was brilliant in Game 6 of the first round against the San Antonio Spurs (43 points, 12 rebounds and nine assists) \u2026 only to see the Nuggets lose. He rebounded with a 21-point, 15-rebound, 10-assists triple-double in Game 7, grinding through 43 minutes as Denver prevailed. His recognition of when to apply pressure as the primary scorer and when to exploit his other advantages will be critical going forward. \u201cHe\u2019s a sponge, he picks it up,\u201d Nuggets veteran forward Paul Millsap said. \u201cHe sees how people are playing and guarding him, and he makes the right play every time. That\u2019s what\u2019s great about him, he doesn\u2019t force anything. He\u2019s going to make the right reads. He\u2019s like a quarterback out there. I consider him like a Tom Brady. He\u2019s always going to pick you apart and make the right reads. I commend him for doing that at this stage of his career.\u201d Jokic acknowledged the difference in feel from Game 1 to Game 2. He knew immediately that he\u2019d fallen into the trap the Blazers set for him. He adjusted in the second half of Game 2, but the Nuggets couldn\u2019t recover from their brutal start in time for it to matter. And when things got chippy at the end of Game 3, it was too late for the Nuggets. Jokic, however, promises to be ready for whatever the Blazers throw his way in Game 3. \u201cIt\u2019s playoffs,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to win, they want to win. I think it\u2019s normal. We just need to be aggressive and more physical.\u201d * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

But the first three games of the Eastern Conference semifinals series between the Toronto Raptors and the Philadelphia 76ers have felt like an evolution. Philadelphia\u2019s wire-to-wire, 116-95 victory in Game 3 was a new team finding itself on both ends of the floor and putting together its best performance of the year. Neither of these teams entered this series with a clear sense of who they were. The Raptors\u2019 starting lineup had played together in just 19 games prior to Game 1, while the Sixers\u2019 starting lineup had played together in just 14. The Raptors had Kawhi Leonard, and that was enough in Game 1. But since then, Toronto\u2019s attack hasn\u2019t evolved beyond a whole lot of Leonard and some Pascal Siakam on the side. Leonard has averaged 37.7 points on an effective field goal percentage of 67 percent in the series. Siakam, for the most part, has come along for the ride, averaging 23.3 on an effective field goal percentage of 55 percent. After that, things have been dicey. The other Raptors have been unable \u2026 and somewhat unwilling \u2026 to score. On Thursday, after Leonard scored 14 points in a remarkable run in the third quarter, helping the Raptors shave an 18-point deficit down to seven, the Sixers adjusted and sent two defenders at him. \u201cYou had to do something,\u201d said Sixers coach Brett Brown. \u201cAnd we chose to go after him and get the ball out of his hands.\u201d That should have opened things up for Leonard\u2019s teammates, and when he gave up the ball, the Philly defense was in rotation. But Toronto was unable to take advantage. The ball moved, but the Raptors didn\u2019t make (or even take) enough open shots. \u201cIt felt like there was a lot of guys passing up shots,\u201d said Raptors coach Nick Nurse. \u201cThere were a couple of possessions where I was like \u2018There it goes up\u2019 and four more passes would go by. It seemed like every guy that had it was open and he\u2019d move it to the next guy.\u201d \u201cI just think we\u2019re making the game harder than it has to be on ourselves,\u201d Danny Green said. \u201cSometimes, just make the easy play and go from there. Take the first open look or the first easy shot. A lot of times, we\u2019re over-swinging it or over-thinking it or taking too long to swing it.\u201d The Raptors simply aren\u2019t making the Sixers pay for the attention they\u2019ve put on Leonard, whether that be the double-teams they threw at him late in Game 3 or just showing him extra bodies on the strong side of the floor. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to help him,\u201d said Kyle Lowry, who has averaged 12 points and shot 2-for-14 from 3-point range in the series. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to help him. Myself especially, I\u2019ve got to help him score more. I\u2019ve got to help him on the floor. We\u2019ve all got to help him. He\u2019s playing unbelievable right now. We\u2019re not giving him any help. Me, I\u2019m not giving him any help. We\u2019ve got to help him.\u201d That was six got to help hims, by the way. Credit the Sixers\u2019 defense. Their rotations were on point, running some Raptors off of catch-and-shoot opportunities. And when Toronto attacked closeouts off the dribble and got into the paint, Joel Embiid was there to block their shots or scare them from even taking them. Embiid matched Leonard\u2019s 33 points in Game 3, shooting 3-for-4 from 3-point range and 12-for-13 from the free throw line. And he added 10 rebounds, three assists and five blocks, including two rejections of Siakam on a 21-2, fourth-quarter run that turned the seven-point lead into a 26-point cushion and brought out the third string for both teams. \u201c[Joel] is our crown jewel defensively,\u201d Brown said, \u201cand I suppose offensively too, but certainly defensively. And his rim protection and shot-blocking ability tonight stood as much as anything in an incredible performance.\u201d The defense was there in Game 2, when the Sixers won a game in which both teams scored less than a point per possession. The rapid evolution of this series really surfaced on the other end of the floor, where Philly scored 110 points on 85 possessions (1.29 per) before extended garbage time on Thursday. Embiid was the fulcrum of the offense as much as he was the defense. The 3-for-4 from 3-point range was an anomaly, but he also did a lot of work inside, both in the post and as a roll man. And with Philly playing more pick-and-roll than they\u2019ve done in the past, there were opportunities for Jimmy Butler and Tobias Harris off the dribble. For one of the first times since the Sixers\u2019 talented starting lineup came together, all five guys were able to get theirs on offense without anyone taking a real back seat. And while the Raptors are seemingly making things too complicated, the Sixers have seemingly just taken care of the basics, as Butler would put it when he was asked about the team\u2019s chemistry on pick-and-rolls. \u201cI think \u2018chemistry\u2019 is a bad word,\u201d Butler said. \u201cLike everybody wants to say that because we play together however many games or we didn\u2019t play together however many games. It\u2019s simple enough to know that when you have some good basketball players out there, the game happens, you make the right plays, you do what you\u2019re supposed to do with the basketball. That\u2019s all it is. The game is really simple. I think at times we as players decide to make it hard, but if you\u2019re open, shoot it. If you\u2019re not, pass.\u201d The Raptors would do well to follow Butler\u2019s advice in Game 4 on Sunday ( 3:30 ET, ABC ). If they don\u2019t, the evolution of this series could lead to the extinction of their season. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

From Eric Bledsoe and Kyrie Irving, ball handlers who have initiated much of the action, to a pair of valuable role players racing to get back from injuries, a half-dozen Bucks and Celtics are defining (or still hope to define) this series from the backcourt up: ERIC BLEDSOE has been the tip of Milwaukee\u2019s spear, the guy who typically sets the Bucks\u2019 pace and tone. He didn\u2019t play hard enough in the opener and the whole roster sagged. In Game 2, Bledsoe was aggressive, pressuring Irving relentlessly and channeling attack mode into 21 points and a plus-23 rating in the Bucks\u2019 blowout. Now Bledsoe is headed into TD Garden, site of his humbling in Games 1 and 2 last spring, with Celtics fans certain to remind him. KYRIE IRVING played a maestro\u2019s game Sunday, with 26 points and 11 assists while orchestrating and personally aiding Boston\u2019s 54-percent accuracy in its 112-90 cruise. He crashed and burned in Game 2, scoring just nine points on 4-of-18 shooting and relinquishing any quarterback obligations for his team. But the six-time All-Star was curiously at peace afterward, embracing the performance while touching in his postgame comments on precise adjustments he plans to make in Game 3 on Friday night and beyond. MALCOLM BROGDON is the guy conspicuous by his absence from the Bucks\u2019 efforts at both end. In his third NBA season, he emerged as a true sniper, making more than 50 percent of his field-goal attempts, 40 percent of his 3-pointers and 90 percent of his free throws. Brogdon\u2019s size allows him to defend multiple spots, and he developed a knack for asserting himself at pivotal points in close games, a minute or two where he\u2019d take over with his \u201cold-man game,\u201d as Antetokounmpo calls it. Until March 15, anyway. That\u2019s when the plantar fascia pain in Brogdon\u2019s right foot became a tear. He was listed out for Game 3, too, as of Thursday evening, but his workouts have been more active and encouraging, so Brogdon still might return as soon as Game 4 on Monday. MARCUS SMART is Brogdon\u2019s Boston counterpart, working back from a torn left oblique injury suffered in early April. He is a month into what had been projected as a 4-to-6 week recovery, and moved well in drills and 1-on-1 work Thursday against Celtics coaches. That\u2019s still well short of the 5-on-5, full-contact work Smart has to show he can handle. But as with Brogdon, it\u2019s trending in the right direction, even if both probably will need time to catch their rhythms. Boston can\u2019t get enough of the hustle and grit Smart routinely brings. He has been an unofficial coach from the side, urging on teammates in varied, essential, often floor-bound things he does. But the Celtics would be better with a healthy Smart showing rather than telling. TERRY ROZIER , who was such a force in the 2018 playoffs subbing for an injured Irving, isn\u2019t one to be counted out. It was Rozier who had Bledsoe on the run, with his memorable deke and step-back 3-pointer in Game 1, his 23 points in Game 2 and his 26 in the clincher. He\u2019s back on the bench, averaging 10.0 points and 8.5 rebounds through the first two games, while shooting just 6-of-18. Rozier was 21-of-55 from the arc in those seven games vs. Milwaukee last spring. Heading back into the Garden with the fans at his back, Rozier might catch fire again. GEORGE HILL was acquired from Cleveland in December as veteran insurance at the point and for salary cap flexibility this summer (only $1 million of his $18 million for 2019-20 is guaranteed). But he\u2019s an 11-year veteran with a broad wingspan for a 6-foot-3 man. And with 108 playoff games on his resume, Hill is a veteran of these East playoff battles, dating back to his time with Indiana butting heads against LeBron James\u2019 Super Friends. Hill and Ersan Ilyasova are the \u201cold heads\u201d of Milwaukee\u2019s otherwise youngish bench. Coach Mike Budenholzer had Ilyasova for a stretch in Atlanta, but he and Hill go way back. They were in San Antonio when the Spurs made Hill, out of Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis, their first-round pick at No. 26 in 2010. Hill was an apprentice behind All-Star Tony Parker for three years, starting only 55 of 231 games. But he developed enough to be targeted by the Pacers, who gave up the draft rights to Kawhi Leonard in the deal. \u201cThey kind of molded me to the player I am today,\u201d Hill said of Budenholzer and their then-boss Gregg Popovich. \u201cIt\u2019s not nothing special. I just try to be consistent. Make the right play. Be a good teammate. Be solid out there on both ends of the floor. That\u2019s been me my whole career, and it\u2019s going to continue to be.\u201d After joining Cleveland last season in a roster-rocking trade deadline move, Hill started 18 of 19 playoff games and made it to his first Finals. He opened this season putting up bigger numbers in the Cavs\u2019 dreary, LeBron-less outpost. But now he\u2019s back in heavy postseason competition, offering Budenholzer a nice shift of gears from the hard-charging Bledsoe. \u201cTwo different styles,\u201d Hill said. \u201cHe\u2019s more of a drive\/force cat, I\u2019m more of a poised, relaxed style. It\u2019s awesome to have two different options where you can speed it up or slow it down.\u201d The trust Budenholzer has in Hill is evident by when and how frequently the coach leans on him. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to articulate what George Hill means to the team,\u201d Budenholzer said. \u201cParticularly for me, just to have a point guard in Eric Bledsoe who starts the game and is a phenomenal defender, and then to have George come in, give Bled a break and really have no drop-off defensively. \u201cGeorge has played in a ton of huge games. A lot of playoff series. He gives me a ton of comfort. I think he gives his teammates and everybody a lot of comfort, for sure.\u201d * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Or perhaps his man crush runs deep. In any event, Joe Lacob, the co-owner of the Warriors, did something unbefitting of a smart businessman whose personal net worth is into the billions. He ceded leverage. He violated Business 101 when he was quoted as saying this about the Warriors\u2019 jack-of-all-trades player: \u201cI want Draymond Green to be here forever. He\u2019s as Warrior as they come.\u201d There\u2019s no question about that last part; Green has spent his entire career with the Warriors and embodies the spirit, though not the superstardom, of a team currently surfing the wave of a four-championship dynasty. Green brings what Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant can\u2019t: An ability to guard multiple positions at a high level, and fire-breathing that puts a flame to everyone\u2019s backside and keeps their eyes on the prize. Asked how he felt about Lacob\u2019s comments, a smiling Green said \u201cit makes you feel good.\u201d He wants to be here. He\u2019s the definition of The Missing Piece, a player who brings all of the components together, doesn\u2019t shrink from big moments, willing to put everything on the line. That\u2019s unteachable stuff. You either have it or not. Yet, for everything that Green has meant to the Warriors then and even now, that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019ll be at this level, in the gushing words of Lacob, \u201cforever.\u201d Maybe not even another year or two. Basically: Should the Warriors, who\u2019ll be forced to take action on Green\u2019s future soon enough, keep this often-turbulent marriage going and ignore the flashing caution signs all season that Green\u2019s impact is starting to wane? Sometimes we become slaves to the here and the now, because that\u2019s a fallacy in today\u2019s microwaved world, and the last impression Green left on the Warriors was indeed inspiring and hopeful. He did a number on the Rockets with his rebounding, his smart and tenacious defense and his passing, and that\u2019s a major reason the Warriors are up 2-0 and halfway to the West finals. This was Green in his element, causing problems for the other bench, bringing energy and grit and making sharp decisions on both ends. \u201cHe\u2019s really good,\u201d said Rockets coach Mike D\u2019Antoni. \u201cKind of a point guard at the center or forward position. He\u2019s a heck of a player. He moves really well.\u201d This was, without question, the best Green has looked all season, and maybe the last two seasons. His 3-point shot, once a weapon, is now dreadful enough that opposing teams are praying he shoots them \u2014 and thrilled when he makes one, because then he\u2019ll keep shooting. The Warriors\u2019 defense hasn\u2019t been as strong as it was in the first few seasons under coach Steve Kerr, and while that\u2019s not entirely the fault of Green, he\u2019s guilty by association if nothing else. There\u2019s also the pain-in-the-rear-end factor. While the Warriors obviously value Green\u2019s ability to hold teammates accountable, he went overboard earlier this season by his infamous confrontation with Durant and continues to rack up technical fouls at a high rate, meaning he hasn\u2019t learned how to channel his emotions after all these years. Plus, he continues to be high maintenance for Kerr, and you wonder if the coach will reach a point where he no longer wants to deal with it. Green is also 29 and brings an escalated injury history, most notably with his shoulder, but also toe and hip issues. \u201cAll this year I don\u2019t think I was in great shape at all,\u201d Green said. \u201cI\u2019m really just locking in and focusing on my body; getting it healthy and ready for this time of year has been important. It feels good to step out there and not have an ache. Sometimes during the year, like the toe injury, every time you step on that toe, put pressure on it, it\u2019s killing me. You kind of dread going on the floor.\u201d He recognized three months ago that his movements weren\u2019t as rapid as usual so he changed his diet and dropped 20 pounds. But that wasn\u2019t the strategic move that generated buzz within the Warriors organization. This was: Green hired Rich Paul, famously known as LeBron James\u2019 business partner, to represent him in future contract talks. The five-year, $82 million deal he signed in 2015 has one more year remaining. That puts the Warriors in a potentially urgent situation: Do they extend Green this summer or wait? If they allow Green to play next season without an extension, that could be an interesting scene; an emotionally charged player perhaps feeling unwanted and therefore making Kerr\u2019s life hell. It would make better sense to extend him this summer, or trade him. One or the other. But when the owner comes out publicly and uses the \u201cforever\u201d word, that removes an option for Bob Myers even if the general manager wanted to adopt the Branch Rickey model and dump a player a year too early than a year too late. So then it comes down to money. Green may feel he has been underpaid and is owed a somewhat significant raise, especially if the Warriors are unable to re-sign Durant and therefore have extra money to spend. Would it be a wise basketball decision to keep Green in the mix for another five years at a high price? How would the Warriors rebuild around Curry and Klay Thompson (assuming Thompson as expected re-signs this summer)? Championship teams have a tendency to fall in love with the players who helped them win championships \u2014 too much in love. Certainly, emotion was on Andre Iguodala\u2019s side when he signed an extension two years ago, and his production since has dropped considerably (although Iguodala\u2019s play this postseason has been solid). These teams are often, for lack of a better word, afraid to part with a popular player as he ages, partly because of fan and media backlash. And there\u2019s another reason for hesitating: Maybe the team will miss that player more than anyone thought, at least in the short term. At some point, the Warriors must address the elephant in the room, because the bill for these championships will come due. Yes, they\u2019re ready to move into a new San Francisco arena and revenue will flow, and the team will continue to snicker at the luxury tax. Kevin Durant\u2019s decision will be based on his whims, not money. The Warriors have no control over that. But they will have a significant say in Green\u2019s future. Or maybe the owner already spoke for them. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years. You can e-mail him  here , find his archive here  and follow him on  Twitter  .

The 60-year-old executive received immediate medical attention Tuesday night in Milwaukee, the team said in a statement Thursday. The Celtics were facing the Bucks in the second round of the playoffs. Ainge, who also had a mild heart attack in 2009, was scheduled to return to Boston. Per Shams Charania of The Athletic, Ainge is expected to return home tonight. Ainge has been active and walking around today and is reportedly feeling much better, per Charania. Celtics coach Brad Stevens said after the team practiced Thursday that he\u2019s been in frequent communication with Ainge\u2019s family. He said they all seem to be doing well. \u201cThat\u2019s all positive, but certainly it\u2019s scary,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cTo me, he\u2019s a friend and the family\u2019s been so good to us. So, you don\u2019t even think about anything else. You just want him to be comfortable and feeling great, getting better, that it\u2019s a good prognosis.\u201d Game 3 of the Celtics\u2019 series with the Bucks is Friday night in Boston. \u201cThis is much bigger than basketball,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cGame 3 is Game 3. You always want to play your best at this time of the year. Obviously, he really cares about the result. We all really care about the result. But this is a game. So, that\u2019s what it is.\u201d Stevens\u2019 comments were echoed by Celtics guard Marcus Smart, who said the team was informed by the coaching staff before practice Thursday. Now in his fifth season in Boston, Smart is the longest-tenured player on the roster. Smart shares a close relationship with Ainge, who was there to comfort him while his mother, Camellia Smart, endured and eventually died from cancer last year. \u201cDanny is just one of those guys. He takes time out of his life and his day, whatever he\u2019s doing and his schedule, to make sure you\u2019re all right,\u201d Smart said. \u201cHe constantly checks in on my family and everything like that. Just personally for me he\u2019s been like another mentor for me. \u201cFrom when I first got here Danny was that person I seen every day. \u2026 He means a lot to my life as well. I just hope he makes a speedy recovery.\u201d Ainge was a two-sport star at BYU who in 1981 won the Wooden Award as the nation\u2019s top college basketball player. He played parts of three seasons with the Toronto Blue Jays, batting .269, before settling into a 14-year career in the NBA. Ainge was an All-Star in 1988 and won two championships with the Celtics alongside Larry Bird, Robert Parish and Kevin McHale. Ainge coached the Phoenix Suns for three-plus seasons and took over the Celtics\u2019 basketball operations in 2003. He was named NBA executive of the year in 2008 after engineering the deals for Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen that helped the Celtics raise their record 17th championship banner.

It was clear Houston\u2019s superstar was still dealing with injuries to his eyes after being hit by Golden State\u2019s Draymond Green in Game 2. Harden insisted the problem wouldn\u2019t keep him out of Game 3 on Saturday ( 8:30 ET, ABC ) as the Rockets try to climb out of an 0-2 series hole against the defending champions. Harden practiced with the Rockets today despite injuries to both of his eyes. It was clear that last year\u2019s MVP was still struggling as he squinted under the light while answering questions about it. The entire left side of his left eye remained bloody, as did the left corner of his right eye. \u201cIf I played barely seeing last game, what makes you think I\u2019m going to sit out Game 3,\u201d Harden asked defiantly. Harden was injured midway through the first quarter Sunday night after an inadvertent blow to the face from Green as he tried to rebound a shot he missed. He immediately fell to the court where he remained writhing for a bit before he was tended to by Houston\u2019s training staff and taken to the locker room. He returned with about seven minutes left in the second quarter and scored 29 points despite saying that his vision was extremely blurry and that he could see \u201cnothing.\u201d \u201cWhen he went out he had zero points and he comes back with not even one eye, one eye was almost shut and the other one was blurry and he gets 29 points,\u201d Rockets coach Mike D\u2019Antoni said. \u201cNot many people would have played. So whatever happens, that\u2019s pretty special.\u201d Though both eyes are injured, the left one is far worse than the right with the entire left side of his left eye remaining bloody. The right eye was bloody, too, but it was a much smaller section in the left corner of that eye. \u201cIt\u2019s still there,\u201d Harden said. \u201cIt\u2019s still tough, especially in bright lights but I can see y\u2019all a little bit better so that\u2019s all that matters.\u201d Harden said he visited a doctor on Wednesday and \u201che gave me some stuff to calm it down to make it better.\u201d He said he didn\u2019t know the exact diagnosis of his injury, but the team called it contusions to both eyes. He added that the doctor told him that he\u2019d be \u201cgood,\u201d but that it will take a few days to heal. ESPN\u2019s Tim MacMahon reported on Thursday morning that the Rockets are optimistic that Harden will not have any further problems with his vision. Per MacMahon, once the Rockets arrived back in Texas yesterday afternoon, Harden had several tests done with an eye doctor. There was no damage to either of Harden\u2019s corneas, per MacMahon, and the team expects his vision to be completely clear as Houston tries to climb from its 2-0 series deficit to the Warriors. Last year\u2019s MVP said he\u2019s dealt with a variety of injuries, but that this one has been the most difficult. \u201cIt\u2019s different,\u201d he said. \u201cLike an ankle injury, I\u2019ve rolled my ankle 100 times or whatnot and you kind of know how to deal with that. When you\u2019ve got blurry vision and you can\u2019t see it\u2019s really difficult. But still no excuses.\u201d Both Harden and D\u2019Antoni scoffed at the notion that he would wear goggles or protective eye wear of any kind on Saturday. D\u2019Antoni even went so far as to make a joke about if he\u2019d need something like that to play. \u201cMaybe one patch over an eye,\u201d he said snickering. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be the pirate look.\u201d Harden finished Game 2 with 29 points and seven rebounds in the Rockets\u2019 115-109 loss . However, his eyes were still red and bothering him postgame. \u201cIt hurt,\u201d Harden said after Game 2. \u201cI could barely see. Just try to go out there and do what I can to help my teammates. It\u2019s pretty blurry right now. Hopefully it gets better day by day. \u201cCan\u2019t see nothing. Barely can see.\u201d Harden\u2019s eyes were especially sensitive to light after the game as Harden squinted and shielded his eyes repeatedly throughout Game 2 and in his postgame news conference. After the game, Green said he made a mistake and hit Harden in his eye. He checked on the Rockets\u2019 star after the game and, in his postgame news conference said: \u201cIt\u2019s not about hurting anybody out here. So many times people forget when a guy has an injury, you live with that every day, every second of every day. It\u2019s not just about this game. If his eye is messed up, he\u2019s got to live that every day. Just want to check on the guy.\u201d Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":33958,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/hang-time-podcast-blazers-win-bucks-bounce-back","date":"2019-05-02","title":"Hang Time Podcast: Blazers even series, Bucks respond + more","content":"John Schuhmann and I break down the Blazers\u2019 impressive Game 2 win over the Nuggets to even the West semifinals series at 1-1.

The Raptors\u2019 lineup \u2014 Kyle Lowry, Danny Green, Kawhi Leonard, Pascal Siakam and Marc Gasol \u2014 has outscored the Sixers by 25.1 points per 100 possessions in its 51 minutes. In 25 minutes with both starting lineups on the floor, the score has been Raptors 63, Sixers 46. Plus, those starters-vs.-starters minutes were even better for the Raptors in Game 2 ( 33-21 ) than they were in Game 1 ( 30-25 ). The 29.6 total minutes that the Raptors\u2019 starters played in Game 2 were the most minutes (by a pretty wide margin) that any lineup has played in any game in these playoffs. The only other lineup that has played more than 25 minutes in a game was the Portland starters ( 25.8 ) in Game 3 in Oklahoma City. The Raptors were a plus-13 in those 29.6 minutes, which means that they were outscored by 18 points in 18.4 minutes with at least one their reserves on the floor. (Random note when talking about how many minutes lineups have played in individual games: There have been 49 games in these playoffs through Wednesday and none of them have gone to overtime. Last year, four of 82 playoff games went to OT.) Some of that damage came against the Philadelphia starters. In 5.4 minutes with the Sixers\u2019 starting lineup on the floor against Toronto lineups that included at least one reserve, Philly outscored Toronto by seven points (12-5). But most of the damage came with reserves on the floor for both teams. In 13 minutes with at least one reserve on the floor for both Toronto and Philly, the Sixers outscored the Raptors by 11 points (31-20). The score of those reserves-on-the-floor-for-both-teams minutes in Game 1? Raptors 31, Sixers 20. Same score, different result. One difference in those minutes was that Sixers coach Brett Brown shortened his rotation and limited the time in which he had just one or two starters on the floor. In Game 1 (not counting garbage time), the Sixers were a minus-9 in 5.6 minutes with fewer than three starters on the floor. In Game 2, they were a minus-5 in just 1.4 minutes with fewer than three starters on the floor. Brown took Furkan Korkmaz out of the rotation, extended Ben Simmons\u2019 minutes ( from less than 34 in Game 1 to more than 44 in Game 2 ) and barely played a mostly-reserve unit that included James Ennis, Jonah Bolden and Boban Marjanovic. In 177 career games, the only time that Simmons has played more was the Sixers\u2019 triple-overtime game against Oklahoma City last season. Of course, the Sixers also just had better results in their hybrid lineups. In Game 1, the Sixers\u2019 lineups with three or four starters on the floor were a minus-14 in 18.7 minutes. In Game 2, they were a plus-15 in 26.8 minutes. One matchup the Raptors may want to avoid? Serge Ibaka vs. Joel Embiid. Even though Embiid has shot just 7-for-25 in the series, the Sixers have outscored the Raptors by 28 points in 26 minutes when he\u2019s been on the floor against Ibaka. The Raptors got away with a minus-14 in 13 of those minutes in Game 1 , but not again in Game 2 .  As noted after Game 2, the difference between the Raptors win and the Sixers\u2019 win was on Toronto\u2019s end of the floor . The Sixers have scored a little less than a point per possession in each game. In Game 1, the Raptors scored 108 points on 98 possessions. But in Game 2, they were held to just 89 on 95, their fourth-worst offensive performance in 89 total games this season. Interestingly, one of the biggest differences in the Toronto offense between Games 1 and 2 was ball movement. But the problem in Game 2 wasn\u2019t that the ball didn\u2019t move as much as it did in Game 1. It actually moved a lot more. Even though they had three fewer possessions on Monday, the Raptors passed the ball 67 more times than they did two nights earlier. The Raptors rank second in ball movement in the playoffs (352 passes per 24 minutes of possession), the only team that has averaged more passes per 24 than it did in the regular season. The other 15 playoff teams have averaged 30 fewer passes per 24 minutes of possession than they did in the regular season. The Raptors have averaged seven more. But Toronto has been more efficient when it hasn\u2019t moved the ball as much. In their four playoff games in which they\u2019ve passed the ball fewer than 350 times per 24 minutes of possession, the Raptors have scored 112.5 points per 100 possessions. In their three games in which they\u2019ve passed the ball more than 350 times per 24, they\u2019ve scored just 104.1 points per 100 possessions. Part of that is that Kawhi Leonard has been the postseason\u2019s most efficient scorer on isolations and its fourth-most efficient scorer on pick-and-roll ball-handler possessions . He has an effective field goal percentage of 62.1 percent on pull-up jumpers, the second-best mark among players who have attempted at least 25. In Game 1, Leonard was 8-for-12 (2-for-5 from 3-point range) on pull-up jumpers. In Game 2 he was 5-for-12 (1-for-6). In Game 1, Leonard had 55 touches and passed the ball just 19 times . In Game 2, he had 68 touches , but passed it 38 times . The Sixers, with Simmons guarding him most of the time, did a better job of getting the ball out of Leonard\u2019s hands.  One reason that getting the ball out of Leonard\u2019s hands has worked is that Green has shot 2-for-10 from 3-point range. Green missed two 3-point attempts that would have tied Game 2 in the final 1:01 of the fourth quarter. The second of those was open, because Jimmy Butler rotated over to Leonard after Lowry recovered his own failed attempt at a nutmeg. The first was somewhat contested by J.J. Redick. Redick has been the primary defender on Green, as he was on Joe Harris in the first round. Harris (47.4 percent) was the league\u2019s leading 3-point shooter in the regular season and Green (45.5 percent) ranked second. Combined, Harris ( 4-for-21 ) and Green have shot 19 percent from 3-point range against the Sixers in these playoffs. On possessions in which Redick has been their defender, they\u2019re 0-for-9 from beyond the arc , having shot less often than they usually do, per Second Spectrum tracking. Redick is one of the best in the league at moving without the ball to get open. While he can be picked on defensively in isolations or pick-and-rolls, he\u2019s done a great job off the ball of keeping his fellow shooters from getting open. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

Over a century after hoops first appeared on the international stage in St. Louis, Mo., 3\u00d73 basketball will be featured at the Olympics for the first time in event history at the 2020 Olympics in Japan. On May 2, USA Basketball announced a multiyear partnership with Red Bull North America to build an elite pathway for men\u2019s and women\u2019s players who have a goal of competing at the highest levels of 3\u00d73 basketball. Through this partnership, Red Bull will host 23 qualifying tournaments across the country under the newly created Red Bull 3X series to identify the eight athletes who could potentially represent USA Basketball at the 2020 Olympics. The winning teams at these qualifiers will compete to accumulate enough individual FIBA points with the goal of moving on to the Red Bull USA Basketball 3X Regionals in the Fall of 2019, and then to the Red Bull USA Basketball 3X Nationals in March 2020, which will be used to select the USA men\u2019s and women\u2019s 3\u00d73 national teams. \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of excitement because it creates an opportunity for an athlete that may not have been thinking that this is a pathway for them,\u201d said Jim Tooley, CEO of USA Basketball. \u201cIt opens up a door to a whole new generation of players that have an opportunity to wear U.S.A. across their chest and be a part of the Olympic games.\u201d The rules and regulations of 3\u00d73 basketball are different than the laws that international 5\u00d75 teams adhere to. The Red Bull 3X qualifiers, Red Bull USA Basketball 3X Nationals and the 2020 Summer Olympics 3\u00d73 competition will be played on a half court with a 10-minute game clock and 12-second shot clock, where the winner is first team to 21 points or the team in the lead at the end of the 10-minute regulation. Chris Mullin, a member of the 1992 USA Basketball \u201cDream Team\u201d and a 5-time NBA All-Star, is an ambassador for the sport of 3\u00d73 basketball and USA Basketball. The style of 3\u00d73 basketball and pace-of-play heavily intrigues the former Golden State Warrior and Indiana Pacer. This game here is fast-paced, up-tempo and probably more skill-based. There are different ways you can strategically approach it, but I think the level-playing field will appeal to so many more people,\u201d Mullin said. \u201cIf you played basketball at some point, every coach used 3\u00d73 as a teaching tool for conditioning or for skill development. 3\u00d73 is the purest form of basketball.\u201d Along with the chance to become the first crop of athletes to ever play 3\u00d73 basketball at the Olympic stage, USA Basketball participants will have the opportunity to represent their country at the international stage; something Chris Mullin said has never lost its effect on him. \u201cI go back to 1981 with my U.S.A. basketball experience and I have vivid memories of every experience, whether it was my coaches, my teammates or the places that they brought me all over the world,\u201d Mullin said. \u201cThe biggest impact in my basketball career has been through USA Basketball. Playing on your college team is great, playing on your NBA team is great, but USA Basketball is always a different experience. You\u2019re playing with different players in different countries and different coaches.

Knocked down later, his Denver Nuggets teammates rushed to his defense. There\u2019s no masking the appreciation the Nuggets have for their defensive specialist. Bloodied and bruised, Craig contributed seven points in a 97-90 loss to Portland on Wednesday night as the Trail Blazers tied the Western Conference semifinal series at a game apiece. \u201cHe fights. He\u2019s a fighter,\u201d Nuggets forward Paul Millsap said. \u201cHate to see something like that happen, but for him to come back and be inspiring like he did, it was unbelievable.\u201d Craig was going for a rebound early in the second quarter when he appeared to bounce off Blazers forward Zach Collins and fall into the leg of Denver teammate Monte Morris. Craig remained down on the court for several moments as trainers came out to treat him. There was blood on the court when he left the floor. Craig was taken to the locker room with a towel covering his face. The Nuggets said he had a nasal contusion. But he returned late in the third with the Nuggets needing some energy, wearing plugs in his nostrils to control the bleeding and a clear mask he had custom-fitted from a previous broken nose. Craig provided a spark by grabbing a rebound and later hitting a 3-pointer. \u201cMost guys wouldn\u2019t even come back into the game after that,\u201d said Gary Harris. \u201cHe took some hard hits and kept playing for us. He\u2019s huge for this team.\u201d As the game was drawing to a close, an incident that transpired with just under a minute left in the fourth quarter. After a free throw, Enes Kanter bumped into Craig, knocking him to the ground. Jamal Murray took exception to Kanter staring down the fallen Craig and a minor scuffle ensued near midcourt. Teammates raced to break them up, with Kanter and Murray drawing technicals. What happened in the skirmish varied by the perspective of the team. Kanter said he was pushed by Nikola Jokic and that it was just an accident. \u201cIt was a free throw box out, and then this dude literally just pushed me into his teammate, and then I knocked somebody down,\u201d Kanter said, per Mike Singer of The Denver Post . \u201cThen they started getting in my face. I\u2019m like \u2018I didn\u2019t do anything, your teammate just pushed me into you,\u2019 so I like that. That for me is what the playoffs are all about, just out there and just give everything you have. You either win or you go home.\u201d Harris was the first to Kanter and appeared to tell him to stop before some shoving broke out. Morris was on the bench when the incident happened and said it provides some foreshadowing for Friday\u2019s Game 3 ( 10:30 ET, ESPN ). \u201cI saw Torrey on the ground,\u201d Morris said, per The Denver Post . \u201cI was on the bench. I didn\u2019t see it, but that showed you how Game 3 is gonna be. It\u2019s gonna be real chippy. We just gotta be ready to take the challenge, throw the first punch and do what we do to get the win.\u201d Accident or not, Millsap didn\u2019t appreciate it. \u201cWe don\u2019t care,\u201d Millsap said. \u201cShouldn\u2019t hit our guy anyway.\u201d Nuggets coach Michael Malone, who played a peacemaker of sorts during the skirmish, said he didn\u2019t see any malice after watching the replay of it. \u201cListen, both of these teams are trying to get to the Western Conference finals,\u201d Malone said. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be hard fought, it\u2019s gonna be physical, but there\u2019s nothing dirty about that and I respect that.\u201d As for Craig, Malone said he couldn\u2019t help but respect his player\u2019s toughness.. \u201cI told him, \u2018If you can\u2019t go, you don\u2019t have to be Willis Reed for us,\u2019 \u201d Malone said, alluding to the New York standout who hobbled onto the floor in Game 7 of the 1970 NBA Finals against the Los Angeles Lakers to help the Knicks win. \u201cWhat I love about him is that kid is not going to allow me to keep him off the court.\u201d Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":33973,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/portland-trail-blazers-show-theyre-more-just-damian-lillard","date":"2019-05-02","title":"Blazers even series in Game 2, prove they're more than just Lillard","content":"DENVER \u2014 As much as these Portland Trail Blazers are about Damian Lillard\u2019s toughness, resilience, drive, talent and skill, there\u2019s more to them than just Lillard. This team that\u2019s been crafted around Lillard, the Blazers\u2019 All-NBA point guard, had to rescue their leader this time. \u201cDame Time\u201d never materialized Wednesday night at Pepsi Center in Game 2 of these Western Conference semifinals . Lillard was off, basically from the start. He simply didn\u2019t have his usual juice, shooting 5-for-17 from the floor and finishing with a postseason low 14 points and four assists. But the rest of the Blazers, from CJ McCollum to seldom-used reserve forward Jake Layman, showed up and carried the Blazers. That gave Portland a 97-90 win against the Denver Nuggets that evened the series as it heads to Portland for Friday\u2019s Game 3 at Moda Center ( 10:30 ET, ESPN ). \u201cI thought we wore them down in the first half, even though we weren\u2019t shooting the ball particularly well,\u201d Lillard said in assessing his team\u2019s thorough effort. \u201cThen in the second half it was just a grind it out kind of game. In those games you just have to be the tougher team. You have to want it more and then you have to have a few plays go your way.\u201d The thought of the Blazers stealing the home-court advantage on a night when Lillard struggled through one of his toughest games of the season would have seemed laughable before this. Doing it with Lillard struggling and down two other starters (starting center Jusuf Nurkic in late March; forward Maurice Harkless injured his ankle and played just 13 first-half minutes in Game 2) seemed \u2026 impossible? And yet there was McCollum, time after time, nailing a shot, grabbing a rebound or finding an open teammate to hold the Nuggets off late. He finished with a game-high 20 points (on 8-for-20 shooting, to go with six rebounds and six assists) on a physically bruising night when draining open shots turned out to be a difficult task for all involved. \u201cI was just trying to be aggressive,\u201d said McCollum, who averaged 33.7 points this season in games where Lillard was held to 15 points or less. \u201cI think that was the biggest thing, be aggressive, take what the defense gives me. Obviously, looking to score. But if it\u2019s not there, being aware of the weak side, being aware of the help defender and trying to make the right play.\u201d It worked that way for all of the Blazers, whatever it took to make the right plays. Al Farouq-Aminu bounced back from a rough Game 1, finishing with a double-double (11 points, 10 rebounds) and some tone-setting defense early on Nuggets power forward Paul Millsap. Enes Kanter, the starting center with the busted left shoulder, played Nuggets All-Star Nikola Jokic to a virtual standstill. In addition, Portland go some huge relief minutes from Zach Collins (10 points on 5-for-6 shooting, six rebounds). Seth Curry nailed a huge 3-pointer late and Evan Turner was right on time in his 18 minutes, providing quality work on both ends in a physical affair that left both teams spent physically and emotionally at the end. But perhaps the finest effort of the night was turned in by reserve swingman Rodney Hood, as his 15 points (on 5-for-11 shooting), three rebounds and three huge blocks couldn\u2019t have come at a better time. These Blazers are determined to write their ticket to the conference finals after being swept in the previous two postseason trips. Hood drilled a 22-footer from the corner off a sweet feed from Lillard with 2:02 to play, pushing the lead back to 10 (94-84) and silencing the crowd. He made three of four free throws in 17 seconds to finish things off. \u201cI thought CJ had a few big plays at the end,\u201d Lillard said. \u201cEnes had some big plays and Chief (Aminu) just competed in the paint with those big guys. Rodney in there competing, Enes competing on their offensive end. Even when they kept getting tips and second and third opportunities, they were having to work for it and we were getting shots contested down there, so we were able to get stops. In this type of game, I think that\u2019s what you need, a tough group effort. You just need a few guys to make a few big-time plays, and I thought C.J., Chief and Enes did that at the end of the game.\u201d How big was this win for the Blazers in the Lillard era? Consider that they are now 3-10 all-time now when Lillard has been held below 20 points. And they are just 3-18, dating back to 2014, in road playoff games. But they controlled this game early and snatched it from the team with the NBA\u2019s best regular-season home record (34-7). If the Blazers have visions of making the conference finals \u2014 and you better believe they do \u2014 this gutsy performance might pave the way. \u201cThey say the series starts when someone wins a game on the road and we were able to do that tonight,\u201d Lillard said. \u201cSo our goal is just to take it one game at a time and protect our home floor. We have two games on our home floor and we have to be just as sharp, if not better, because you know they are going to come back better. That\u2019s our main focus \u2014 just take care of our home floor.\u201d As Lillard says, there is still plenty of business to handle. The Nuggets earned the West\u2019s No. 2 seed for a reason. Denver pummeled Portland on the Game 2 boards with 23 offensive rebounds, but couldn\u2019t take advantage of those opportunities. They were 6-for-29 on 3-pointers and Jokic never got rolling like he did in Game 1. \u201cIt\u2019s not just how they play me,\u201d Jokic said. \u201cThey were aggressive as a team as a group. They were coming on my post-ups, but that doesn\u2019t really change how we play. The energy was kind of bad. I say that and we have 23 offensive rebounds. It was a weird game for us. They didn\u2019t even play that good, to be honest. They can play better than that. It was kind of a weird game where they were more aggressive than we were.\u201d It was a game where the Blazers clearly recognized the magnitude of the moment and rose to the challenge. Friday night becomes more than just a must-win game. It\u2019s an epic showdown, an opportunity for a team that\u2019s showcasing it\u2019s not all about Lillard to take serious control of this series and continue Portland\u2019s playoff redemption tour. * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

This was moments after he was scratched on his left eyelid in Tuesday\u2019s Game 2 by Draymond Green. That injury, though, is somewhat reflective of how this Western Conference semifinal series is going for him and, by extension, his Houston Rockets. Harden is down and, at least momentarily, out for the count. He can\u2019t generate any traction or destruction against the Golden State Warriors, who have a 2-0 series lead after a 115-109 win . This was the case before and after his vision went fuzzy. If the league\u2019s leading scorer and most lethal offensive force is coming to this battle with a squirt gun, what chance do the Rockets have of extending this series, let alone winning it? That is the story of Warriors-Rockets after two games \u2014 not the officiating and the complaining about it , not Stephen Curry\u2019s dislocated middle finger , not Chris Paul\u2019s vaporizing act and not Kevin Durant\u2019s scorching pace and dagger buckets, either. Harden is broken and despite what his popular commercial claims, there\u2019s no insurance claim that can fix this in a pinch. His role in this series can only be repaired by a somewhat drastic adjustment on his part coupled with the Warriors\u2019 defense suddenly developing amnesia. In other words: This is a problem for the host team the next two games. Harden finished with 29 of the fluffiest points you\u2019ll ever see. None of his Game 2 baskets were memorable or made the Warriors sweat. None came in a flurry, the kind Harden delivered with regularity during the regular season. This has been the going rate for Harden all postseason. His efficiency is a mess. He struggled, compared to his standards, in the first round against the Utah Jazz . He\u2019s shooting 37.7 percent in the postseason and hasn\u2019t mustered a ballistic performance after he dropped 61 points twice in the regular season . After averaging 36.1 points per game in the regular season, he has yet to reach that number in these playoffs. Even worse, Harden isn\u2019t creating as much for his teammates. The Warriors are mindful of his pick-and-roll and lob passes and are rotating swiftly, keeping a body on Clint Capela and others. Harden had four assists in 34 minutes in Game 2 as the Warriors forced 17 turnovers. Paul had just 18 points and, given Houston\u2019s lack of a third big-time scorer, the Rockets were mainly helpless in Game 2. The Warriors have basically taken a tip from the Jazz by having a defender shadow Harden\u2019s left hip. Doing so forces him to his weak hand while allowing Golden State to pick its spots to trap him. That defense is all a team can do against Harden given his creativity off the dribble, his ability to draw fouls and shoot from deep. Andre Iguodala, now a starter, is the first line of defense and has relieved Klay Thompson of Harden duty. Even at his advanced age, Iguodala is athletic, flexible and wise in guarding Harden. Utility help is coming from Green, who\u2019s causing more issues for Harden than Iguodala because of his height and aggressive (though not reckless) defense. But the bonus is Durant, who in addition to his scoring is coming up big defensively against his friend and former Oklahoma City Thunder teammate. Three times in Game 2, Durant had vivid stops against Harden, twice blocking his shot. \u201cI love how we stayed poised,\u201d Durant said. All of this, coupled with playing with one healthy eye, made for another miserable night for the reigning Kia MVP. \u201cCould barely see,\u201d said Harden, who squinted through his postgame news conference. \u201cI just tried to do what I could to help my teammates.\u201d Certainly, the mere sight of Harden returning to play after the first-quarter injury was commendable. \u201cBut that\u2019s him,\u201d said Rockets coach Mike D\u2019Antoni. \u201cI didn\u2019t have a doubt he was coming back unless it was something catastrophic. Under the circumstances, I thought he played great. (But) I\u2019m sure he would\u2019ve liked to have played better.\u201d For a second straight postseason vs. the Warriors, Harden would like to play better. He melted away when the Rockets needed him most in the 2018 conference finals, after Paul suffered a hamstring pull and missed Games 6 and 7. The Rockets led the series 3-2, but Harden didn\u2019t do his team any favors. He was strikingly inefficient those last two games of that series, combining to shoot 22-for-53 and failing to conjure the legendary moment the Rockets needed to oust Golden State. The word then was Harden was simply whipped from a long season where he logged heavy minutes, all designed to win him his first Kia MVP, which he accomplished. But did the load hamper him in late May? He denies it, but that didn\u2019t stop the speculation. And what about now? Is fatigue, if that\u2019s the case, settling in early this time? Harden never missed a game this season and was forced to play hero ball in December when Paul once again missed time with injuries. He rescued the Rockets from falling in the West and did the finest one-man performing act West of Milwaukee. Maybe this isn\u2019t giving the Warriors the applause they richly deserve for their defense this series. Their tactics, whipped up by assistant coach Ron Adams, are forcing Harden to work harder than normal. Certainly at this point in his career, Harden has seen almost every defense known to man. Maybe the Warriors aren\u2019t giving him looks that are foreign to him \u2026 maybe they\u2019re just doing it better than anyone else. \u201cI think Houston has raised our awareness,\u201d Thompson said. At least that\u2019s the verdict after two games. Much can change in a snap, because this is Harden \u2013 perhaps the best player in the NBA over the last four seasons who\u2019s always capable of turning it on. The Rockets will be back home and will have a sense of desperation. Remember, the only time these Warriors lost a series after holding a 2-0 lead was in the 2016 Finals. \u201cThat\u2019s a ballclub that can get going,\u201d Green said. \u201cThey can become impossible to stop.\u201d Plus, you figure Harden will be able to read an eye chart by Saturday\u2019s Game 3. He\u2019d better, because he and the Rockets are on the mat and must find a way to rise. The Warriors are doing a number on Harden, and it\u2019s time he flips roles and puts some numbers on them \u2014 the kind that made his season so special. At this point, does he have any choice? * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years. You can e-mail him  here , find his archive here  and follow him on  Twitter  .

The shorthand version \u2013 \u201cpounding the rock\u201d \u2013 has been embraced as the organization\u2019s mantra across 23 seasons under coach Gregg Popovich. The Spurs hold no monopoly, though, on that saying. It has been in play in both games so far of the Milwaukee-Boston Eastern Conference semifinal series at Fiserv Forum. In the opener, the Bucks were relieved to still be within a possession at halftime after bringing none of their usual energy or intensity. Then the Celtics struck their pivotal blow, splitting the stone when they dominated the third quarter 36-21. This time, in Game 2 Tuesday night at Fiserv Forum, the roles were reversed. Milwaukee dialed up everything, threw in a couple of adjustments and still couldn\u2019t get much separation from Boston. Then wham! Again it happened in the third quarter, the Bucks delivering the blow this time, 39-18. One moment, Milwaukee was up 74-71. The next, 98-73. By the end it was 123-102, the best-of-seven series even at 1-1 . Games 3 and 4 will be in Boston Friday ( 8 ET, ESPN ) and Monday ( 7 ET, TNT ).  Fans watch scoreboards, the equivalent of counting each team\u2019s whacks at the rock. Coaches watch everything else, which is why both Milwaukee\u2019s Mike Budenholzer and Boston\u2019s Brad Stevens felt Game 2 was won well before it broke open or officially was decided. Stevens wasn\u2019t fooled by the points. He saw how both teams were getting or denying them, and that was enough. \u201cI thought they dominated a lot in the first half and we were lucky to be down by four,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cThey owned their space on both ends of the court better than we did. Our reaction to that was to settle on offense, and it led to some run outs. Then it just steamrolled us.\u201d Budenholzer had the all-full perspective. \u201cThat\u2019s more what we\u2019re accustomed to seeing,\u201d he said. \u201cI liked our spirit, our activity and our competitiveness up and down the roster.\u201d Those things had been absent, or at least in short supply, when Milwaukee lost its homecourt edge in the series on Sunday. That\u2019s why this one turned must-win so swiftly for the East\u2019s No. 1 seed. Mathematically, the Bucks had wiggle room, but going to Boston down 0-2 raised the very real specter of not getting back to Fiserv at all. The Bucks players claimed not to let that bad mojo in, focusing only on the frustration they felt in starting the series with such a clunker. True or not, they fixed what needed fixing. Giannis Antetokounmpo, especially early, tried less often to bust through a wall of Boston defenders. Instead, he gave up the ball to wing Khris Middleton or let guard Eric Bledsoe probe the defense in a more aggressive performance. Antetokounmpo\u2019s teammates did their part in the symbiotic relationship by taking and making the good perimeter looks he earned them by drawing so much defensive attention. With so many dropping \u2014 the Bucks were 20-of-47 on 3-pointers, outscoring Boston by 30 in that category \u2014 there invariably was more space for Antetokounmpo to work. \u201cThe Greek Freak\u201d scored 29 points and grabbed 10 rebounds, and shot more free throws (18) than the Celtics\u2019 starting lineup combined (11). He wasn\u2019t likely to get the scolding from his older brother Thanasis that he\u2019d gotten in after the first game . Middleton was the one who served notice to the Celtics that their jobs would be tougher, scoring 20 of his 28 points by halftime. Seven of the 3-pointers were his, on 10 tries. \u201cWe need to get better with that,\u201d Boston\u2019s Al Horford said. Bledsoe forced action and got the better of his matchup with the Celtics\u2019 Kyrie Irving, who, in 48 hours, went from a game worth bronzing to one in need of forgetting. Irving scored nine points on 4-of-18 shooting and shouldered a lot of the responsibility after. \u201cI tried to get to my spots but they were really sending guys over every time,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a sign of respect and I just have to be more efficient in controlling the tempo of the game, the pace, where I want to get to on the floor and making reads better around that mid-range area.\u201d Irving said that Milwaukee\u2019s \u201cfrantic\u201d defensive style in Game 2 revved up Boston\u2019s offensive decisions, and not in a good way. When rushed shots missed, the Bucks pounced for run-outs. The Celtics shot 39.5 percent after their 54 percent success in the opener. Budenholzer unleashed that \u201cfrantic\u201d defense by having his guys switch their assignments with each screen. That\u2019s not how they played this season, but those who were around in 2017-18 did that sort of stuff under Jason Kidd. It kept the energy level high, even when a pair of Bucks occasionally ran into each other. The Bucks\u2019 other adjustment was starting Nikola Mirotic at forward in place of Sterling Brown, the sub who\u2019d been holding injured Malcolm Brogdon\u2019s place. Mirotic scored just nine points, finally hitting a 3-pointer after it mattered, but his size was helpful defensively, Budenholzer said. Boston heads home knowing it can advance without winning another game in Milwaukee. The Bucks assured themselves of a Game 5 and have fresher, happier film to study for the weekend games. As a series, this rock feels like it\u2019s going to take a lot more whacks. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Same goes for Damian Lillard. That would take the Blazers\u2019 coach and star point guard through Game 7 of their Western Conference semifinal series against the Denver Nuggets, themselves hunkered down and prepared to go the distance in this series, if need be. Game 2 is Wednesday night and both sides seem resigned to the fact that the victor won\u2019t get out of this series anytime soon. The Blazers are undaunted after coming up short in Monday\u2019s Game 1, when the Nuggets capitalized on 18 Portland turnovers and turned them into 23 points in a 121-113 win . \u201cIt\u2019s a seven-game series,\u201d Stotts said Tuesday. \u201cI think both teams feel like they can play better. I read where coach [Michael] Malone and their players seem to think they can play better. We think we can play better. That\u2019s part of a NBA series. \u201cThere\u2019s certainly a lot we could have done better. And when you have a chance to go back and watch it on video, you need that confidence going into the next game. A lot of it was at the defensive end. Offensively, the turnovers were a big concern. Hopefully, we\u2019ll take care of that. But defensively there were a lot of areas we could clean up.\u201d The Blazers had no answer for Nikola Jokic , who played a fantastic all-around game and took advantage of every defender Stotts tried on him. But the Nuggets didn\u2019t fare much better against Lillard, who had his way with them to the tune of a game-high 39 points. \u201cHe still had 39 points, so we still have to do a better job and I think we will,\u201d Nuggets guard Gary Harris said. \u201cWe just have to continue to stay locked in, continue to come back and get ready and just look at the film and look at the areas we can get better.\u201d Any data you want to utilize from each team\u2019s first-round series may not apply here. Not only is the style completely different, but also the sense of urgency shifts \u2014 given what\u2019s at stake for the winner \u2014 has shifted into high gear. \u201cIt\u2019s a completely different game and opponent,\u201d Malone said. \u201cFrom Derrick White and DeMar DeRozan, who are not known as 3-point shooters, to guarding CJ [McCollum] and Damian Lillard, who are very efficient 3-point shooters. So your mindset has to change there on that alone, the personnel. \u201cBut now, I think going into this series, Damian Lillard in the first round, he was averaging 33 pick-and-rollls per game. That\u2019s a crazy number. Your bigs are under constant duress, constant pressure to guard and contain, as are your smalls.\u201d Lillard and McCollum promise to keep the pressure on, but must forget what worked and didn\u2019t work against in the first round and focus on the Nuggets. Attacking Denver\u2019s perimeter defenders might not produce the same results that did against the Thunder, as Denver boasts an assortment of longer and more active defenders. With only a day between games to make adjustments, mistakes must be kept to a minimum. \u201cEvery series is going to be different,\u201d Lillard said. \u201cTeams are different. The first round is not the second round. The Thunder are not the Nuggets. So I think your approach \u2026 obviously, that\u2019s why you prepare so completely different. But the mentality has to stay the same as far as what we\u2019re trying to get done. \u201cBeing aggressive, being connected, doing everything together. I think in that way it\u2019s the same. They\u2019re a completely different team. And all that said, we had a chance to win the game \u2026 so in the end it\u2019s just one game.\u201d There\u2019s a chance for six more in this series. And both sides seem prepared for as much. * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

Barnett has been their TV analyst for over three decades and has verbalized it all, from Sleepy Floyd to Don Nelson to Chris Washburn to the \u201cWe Believe crew\u201d and right up to the Stephen Curry-led rampage that\u2019s still in progress. Barnett played for the Warriors from 1971-74, giving him an additional perspective on the franchise. His 11 seasons as an NBA player was spent hopscotching around the NBA and was a teammate of Bill Russell, Julius Erving, John Havlicek, Pete Maravich and Nate Thurmond (among others).  An member of the 1970-71 expansion Portland Trail Blazers, Barnett averaged 18.5 ppg that season. During one game, a rally against the Los Angeles Lakers, Barnett heaved a lengthy shot that swished and tied the score. Blazers broadcaster Bill Schonely became excited and inexplicably shouted \u201cRip City!\u201d into the mic, creating Portland\u2019s signature hoops catch phrase . Barnett was a lively, breezy, quick player with a quirky personality, but never was a star. His first contract paid $11,000 and, he says, he never had a guaranteed deal. To help make ends meet, Barnett had a side hustle in sales. Eventually, though, the game came calling again, and Barnett became the Warriors\u2019 TV analyst in 1985 . The Warriors initially had moderate success and then went through a dry spell where they missed the playoffs in 17 of 18 seasons. But all bad things must come to an end, and the turnaround was launched with the drafting of Curry and then, Klay Thompson. He\u2019s known for his wit, analytical mind and gift of gab \u2013 as well as the perspective of someone whose NBA knowledge goes back five decades. Not many team TV analysts have outlasted Barnett, which he owes to luck but also his connection with the evolving audience. Barnett spoke recently with NBA.com about his career, how the game was played back in the day, those losing Warriors\u2019 seasons and how Golden State\u2019s dynasty stacks up with the Boston Celtics\u2019 of the 1960s . * * * Q: You were drafted by the Celtics as the eighth pick overall in 1966 . That was also Bill Russell\u2019s first season as player\/coach. How was he as a teammate and coach? A: He was very intimidating to me. I mean, this was Bill Russell. He won 11 championships in 13 years. My first impression was he was very fair, and I knew if I played hard, I\u2019d get a fair shake. He was also kind of aloof and quiet. Q: You arrived right in the thick of Boston\u2019s dynasty, correct? A: Those guys had won eight straight championships. You have to understand, when I came into the league, hell, I was afraid I wasn\u2019t going to make it. I was very intimidated. Guys today think about playing in the NBA when they\u2019re in eighth grade. I just wanted to go to college and maybe start by the time I became a sophomore at Oregon. My goals were modest. I didn\u2019t think about the NBA until I was a junior in college and averaging 18 a game. When I went to Boston I worked by ass off. Q: What was that first training camp like? A: Wayne Embry, who later became the longtime general manager of the Cavaliers but was the backup center then, hadn\u2019t worked out all summer. Guys in those days came to training camp to get into shape; they weren\u2019t already in shape, not like today\u2019s players. Well, someone stole Russell\u2019s shoes, so they thought and hoped camp that day would be cancelled, because Russell was a task master and we needed a break. Turned out Sam Jones stole his shoes. Well, Russell didn\u2019t get mad often but he was angry that day. He had us run in place for about two hours. And Embry, poor guy, was in a puddle of water. Looked like he took a shower right there. Q: You had the fortune of playing in the NBA and yet the misfortune of missing out on not just one championships, but two, right? A: My rookie year with the Celtics we lost in the conference finals to that great Philadelphia team. The Celtics had won eight straight titles before I arrived. Then I left and they won it the very next year. I was with the Warriors for three years and then I went in the expansion draft in 1974 [to the New Orleans Jazz] . The Warriors won the \u201975 title. I got picked up by the Sixers in 1977, that was (Julius Erving\u2019s) first year. Early on I\u2019d asked to be released because they were going to put me on injured reserve. Worst decision I ever made. I went home and World B. Free got hurt. I would\u2019ve been activated and played in the NBA Finals. The Sixers lost to Portland, but still. Q: Big regrets? A: I wished I\u2019d won a championship, sure. But I\u2019m not one to regret too much. I go on because I\u2019m a survivor. Getting divorced is a bigger deal; I end up crying for a few days. Things happen to you. What are you going to do about it? You\u2019re not going to change things. Q: Speaking of change, you played in the \u201860s during great social, political and racial shifts. What did you see? A: There were racists on the team in St. Louis when Lenny Wilkens played for the Hawks, that\u2019s for sure, and I know he went through a lot. I\u2019ll tell you a story: I went to a get-together not long ago and someone in a group that was all white made a comment about African American players, a stereotypical comment about whether they\u2019re taking care of their money. Well, I spoke up and said that most of the greatest people I\u2019ve ever been associated with didn\u2019t look like you. I went on and on. I said I wish I had the character and integrity and intelligence of a Stephen Curry. That changed the conversation. Q: What are the major differences in the players from your day and the players today? A: The players were smarter then because we all went to college for four years. We were better from the neck up. And we never had some of the advantages that players today have, like travel, modern medicine, surgical procedures, better diet, strength and conditioning, all the things that make you more athletic and careers longer. What would a guy like Elgin Baylor do with the modern physical therapy that would save his knees? But the players today are much more athletic. And better for the most part. If you put Steph Curry or Kevin Durant back in our day people would be amazed by them. They\u2019d be just as good if not better than they are today.  Q: Not only do you watch the great Warriors of today but you played next to Rick Barry, a Hall of Famer and certainly one of the great Warriors ever. How was that? A: I think he\u2019s one of the most under appreciated players because he\u2019s alienated a lot of people because of his personality. Rick and I have done a lot of personal things together and I know him well. He was one of the great basketball players, one of the 20 best of all time. He\u2019s the greatest Warrior of them all and a smart broadcaster who really should have had my job all these years. But they were never going to hire Rick Barry. Sometimes he sticks his foot in his mouth. I respect him highly and I think he\u2019s really smart. But as I told him years ago, \u2018Rick, you\u2019re your own worst enemy and sometimes you\u2019ve got to let the other guy win even though you\u2019re right 99 percent of the time. You\u2019re right, but it doesn\u2019t serve you well to insist you\u2019re right.\u2019 I love Rick but he gets a little intense when, at this age, you can\u2019t take it that seriously. Q: Best centers of all time? A: Russell for sure. Wilt (Chamberlain) was the most dominant player to ever play. Inch for inch Michael Jordan was the most dominant but not like Wilt. Wilt got 55 rebounds against Russell. Kareem (Abdul-Jabbar) for his longevity, and (Hakeem) Olajuwon. Then Shaquille (O\u2019Neal). Q: Guards? A: Jordan, Jerry West, Oscar Robertson, Magic Johnson and then you got Kobe (Bryant). When Stephen Curry retires he\u2019ll have some credence. Q: Forwards? A: LeBron James, Larry Bird, Dr. J, Karl Malone. (John) Havlicek played both ends, and Rick has to be in there. Kevin Durant makes the game look so damn easy and it\u2019s hard. Q: You mentioned Curry. What impresses you besides the obvious? A: Who he is and how he handles himself. He goes on these tears where he gets 24 points in a quarter and changes the game. But he\u2019s just so calm about it and about himself. Everywhere we go we get thousands of people wanting to see him, and these kids with his jersey on, and most of them are white, they love him. Kids are saying, \u2018I don\u2019t have to be 6-8 and 250 pounds to play in the NBA. I can look like Steph Curry.\u2019 He\u2019s transformative. Q: What about Steve Kerr? A: Steve Kerr is one of the most remarkable, special men I\u2019ve ever met in my life. Obviously he gets a lot from his father who was a diplomat, and from his upbringing. He\u2019s extremely intelligent. His parents were remarkable. That\u2019s rubbed off on him. He has incredible integrity. I wish I could be like that. I\u2019m not. He has been a great son, great father, great husband, great human being. He\u2019s extremely stable. To persevere with all he has gone through with his ailing back has been remarkable. He\u2019s in pain a lot and things are very difficult for him. He doesn\u2019t talk about it but I know he\u2019s hurt more than he lets on. I marvel at it. When he gets fired or leaves or retires or whatever, I\u2019m going to write him a note. I have the utmost respect for him. Q: What\u2019s his best attribute as a coach? A: He knows how to communicate and I think communication is the key to life. He can communicate with Draymond Green who\u2019s very different and Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, he can talk to anybody. He can talk to fans and say the right things, he can talk to the media and have good conversation. He\u2019s very patient. He can be hard. He can be demanding when he has to be and he has a temper and start breaking clipboards. But he gets his point across. Q: Kevin Durant could leave this summer through free agency. How will that affect the Warriors, who can\u2019t replace him, obviously, even if they wanted to? A: I think the Warriors will still be one of the best teams. Whether they win another championship, I don\u2019t know because everybody\u2019s getting better. They\u2019ve raised the standard. Other teams are reaching their potential because of the Warriors. The league is getting stronger. Milwaukee and Giannis (Antetokoumnpo) is getting better. The Celtics, Toronto, Denver, a few others. The Warriors are still going to win 50-55 games with or without Durant. They\u2019re better with him but won\u2019t all of a sudden slide into the second tier. Q: How did you deal with the bad old days, before Curry and Kerr and Durant, when the Warriors were dreadful? Was it tough calling those games on TV? A: I didn\u2019t look and say they are 17-62 and a bad season. I just looked at each game and compartmentalize. For me it was easy to do that. I\u2019ve got natural enthusiasm. I can have fun and be enthusiastic. And those were great years for me in broadcasting because people got to realize I knew how to play the game and it was a stage for me to put my brand on the Warriors and basketball. Because we were so bad as a team, we also didn\u2019t have all the advertising and things we have now that interrupt the game, so I could talk more about the game. Q: It\u2019s tough to win one championship let alone two straight or string together a stretch that makes you legendary. You had a stint with the Celtics and now work the Warriors games. Which dynasty was tougher? A: Look, no team today can win 11 championships in 13 years. But there\u2019s a reason for that. There were only 10 teams in \u201966 when I came in so it was easy for the Celtics to dominate. You had great players on the team and your competition wasn\u2019t as much. The Celtics could dominate because they had Russell and they were just better. Now you\u2019ve got 30 teams and while it makes it easier to win more games in the regular season because you\u2019ve got patsies out there, you also have to go through more playoff rounds and there\u2019s free agency. I think it\u2019s more difficult to do it now because of the sheer number of teams. It\u2019s much more difficult for the Warriors to repeat than the Celtics. Q: The Warriors have only two more months, assuming they\u2019re good as well as fortunate to last that long, to call Oakland their home. Will the move to San Francisco be a good one? A: It\u2019s going to be different. A more sophisticated crowd, more elite. It\u2019s exciting to get into a new arena because it will be modern but the most exciting thing to me is I want the Warriors to win a championship this year in order to go over there with a positive thing. The owners we have are great. They put up $1 billion to pay for an arena without any tax money or public funding and that\u2019s great. It will be a big plus for ownership if they go over there with a championship and make a seamless transition. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re moving across the country, just across the Bay and I suspect the local support won\u2019t change. It\u2019ll just be different inside the building. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years. You can e-mail him  here , find his archive here  and follow him on  Twitter  .

When that does take place, though, he will remain the NBA\u2019s highest-paid coach. Per ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski, once Popovich formally commits to return for season No. 24 in San Antonio, he is expected to sign a three-year deal with the team. Popovich made it clear on Monday that he and the team were negotiating a contract \u2014 news that was a marked change for a coach and team that both value privacy regarding transactions. Additionally, Wojnarowski reports the deal Popovich signs won\u2019t change the fact he will continue to take his coaching future on a season-to-season basis. The team\u2019s ownership believes that Popovich is entitled to manage his future how he wishes. Popovich\u2019s last contract, a five-year deal, ran out with the Spurs\u2019 Game 7 loss to the Denver Nuggets in the first round of the playoffs, Wojnarowski reports. Popovich has 1,245 wins, third-most in NBA history behind Don Nelson and Lenny Wilkens, and is one of five coaches to win five NBA championships. He will coach USA Basketball in the FIBA World Cup in China this summer, and will coach the Americans in the Tokyo Olympics next summer should the team qualify. The Spurs have reached the playoffs the last 22 seasons, a streak that ties for the longest in NBA history. Many doubted the Spurs would continue that streak this season with all the turmoil and turnover. A year ago, Kawhi Leonard played in only nine games while nursing a right thigh injury. Reportedly upset with how his rehabilitation was handled, Leonard forced his way out of San Antonio in the offseason and was sent to Toronto along with Danny Green in a trade for DeMar DeRozan and Jakob Poeltl. The Spurs also lost Manu Ginobili to retirement and Tony Parker left the team in free agency along with veteran Kyle Anderson. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what to expect, to be honest,\u201d Popovich said Monday. \u201cI didn\u2019t know how this group would respond to that kind of adversity, but they showed us a lot in continuing with the program and trying to do what we wanted them to do. So, that was very impressive to me.\u201d San Antonio had eight new players on its roster this season, the most in Popovich\u2019s tenure. That turned out to be one of the highlights for the veteran coach. \u201cIt was kind of one of the more enjoyable seasons because you got to see people develop,\u201d Popovich said Monday. If that wasn\u2019t enough to overcome, the Spurs also lost starting point guard Dejounte Murray to a season-ending knee injury in the preseason and his replacement, Derrick White, missed the first month with a knee injury. In one four-game stretch, the Spurs lost three games by 30-plus points; in Popovich\u2019s first 1,758 regular-season games as coach, the Spurs had only lost by 30-plus five total times. Of course, they also won five straight games by 25-plus points for the first time under Popovich and ended up seventh in the Western Conference as DeRozan and veteran LaMarcus Aldridge helped carry the team\u2019s young roster.

On The Ringer\u2019s \u201cWinging It\u201d podcast with teammate Kent Bazemore and co-host Annie Finberg, Carter said he\u2019s ready to play season No. 22 in the NBA. Carter, who spent last season with Atlanta, said that he would like to return to the Hawks. The conversation about Carter\u2019s future comes about five minutes into the podcast as he and Bazemore are discussing the retirement seasons of Dirk Nowitzki and Dwyane Wade. Carter then shared his thoughts on Nowitzki announcing his plans to retire after his final home game with the Dallas Mavericks. \u201cI think he was at peace with his career and what he accomplished and felt it was time to go \u2026 not ya boy,\u201d Carter said.

He crossed the 25,000-point mark last season with a 14-point game against the Toronto Raptors \u2014 who he played for from 1999-2004 \u2014 on Nov. 21. Fittingly for the former Slam Dunk Contest champion, he surpassed the 25,000th mark with a dunk. Overall, he finished the season as one of the Hawks\u2019 leading 3-point shooters (38.9 percent). Carter also helped call a game on TV for Fox Sports Southeast, doing so on the April 3 broadcast vs. the Philadelphia 76ers . He has made it clear throughout the last few seasons of his career that moving to broadcasting remains his goal once his playing days are done. Carter signed a one-year veteran minimum contract last summer, making the Hawks the eighth team he played for (joining the Raptors, Orlando Magic, New Jersey Nets, Dallas Mavericks, Memphis Grizzlies, Phoenix Suns and Sacramento Kings). He wanted to play for the Hawks because they offered a chance to earn extra minutes.

That\u2019s the easy answer for why the Denver Nuggets had the best home record during the regular season. The real culprit is the waves and waves of talent, size and versatility these young Nuggets are bringing to the Western Conference semfinals . They are by far the youngest group still alive in the 2019 playoffs. And despite coach Mike Malone\u2019s refusal to use that \u201cyoung\u201d tag as a descriptor for his team, they have only two players \u2014 veteran power forward Paul Millsap and center Mason Plumlee \u2014 who had ever set foot in this round of the playoffs prior to Monday night\u2019s 121-113 Game 1 win against the Portland Trail Blazers at Pepsi Center. It is no surprise, then, that Millsap was the focus for the Nuggets early on. He made four of his first five shots and finished the first quarter with 10 points, setting the tone for the rest of the Nuggets. \u201cWe\u2019ve been playing inside-out all year,\u201d Millsap said. \u201cThat\u2019s where our strength comes from. For us to be effective, we\u2019ve got to establish something down low inside-out. I think when we do that and start games off like that, guys start hitting shots and the rhythm is there. It\u2019s up to us to set the tone.\u201d Millsap did exactly that \u2026 and Nikola Jokic and Jamal Murray took it from there. That dual force of talent combined for 60 points and 14 assists and made play after play to beat back the Blazers down the stretch. \u201cWe just adjusted,\u201d Murray said. \u201cJoker got into the middle of the paint and was able to make some plays. Gary [Harris] hit some big shots and \u2018Sap was great as well. We have a lot of weapons and the ball was moving for us early.\u201d There\u2019s another reasonable explanation as to why these Nuggets are so good at home. It is an established fact that role players in the NBA play better at home. When a team has a hand-picked, organic bunch that fits together as well as the Nuggets do, you get a team that\u2019s been a nightmare for foes at home (an NBA-best 34-7 in 2018-19). Harris and Torrey Craig, the other two starters, played huge roles in Game 1. They were putting in work on both ends, particularly with their size and length defensively on Lillard and C.J. McCollum. The same can be said about reserves Malik Beasley, Monte Morris and big man Mason Plumlee, all of whom made timely plays on both ends. \u201cThey play faster and better at home,\u201d Lillard said after his 39-point, six-assist effort Monday night. Denver earned the No. 2 seed in the Western Conference playoff chase this season on the strength of its performances here all season. But they are far from a finished product. That they\u2019re not even close to being what they could be is what is scary for the Nuggets, the rest of the West and the entire league. They are still figuring out who they are \u2026 and yet are three wins from the West finals. \u201cIt\u2019s great, it\u2019s part of the goal, you know?\u201d Harris said, as his amazing reverse layup and chase down block on Lillard late serving as two of Game 1\u2019s best plays. \u201cOne win down, we\u2019ve got thee more to go. We are not satisfied. We have to come in, locked in, and ready to play Game 2 [Wednesday night], because if we lose Game 2 this one doesn\u2019t really matter like that.\u201d Monday\u2019s game was sloppy defensively and there were some frayed nerves at times, too. Both factors kept Denver from creating any lasting distance from Portland. The Nuggets showed resilience beyond their years, making plays to finish this one off after dropping Game 1 in the first round to the San Antonio Spurs. That\u2019s perspective Malone sees paying off now. His young group is learning and comprehending the playoff lessons they\u2019re learning in real time. Just as they leaned on that to survive their first round series against San Antonio with a down-to-the-wire Game 7 win Saturday night, they tapped into that collective energy to outlast Lillard and the Blazers last night. \u201cObviously, Saturday night, an emotional high winning Game 7. That was probably my biggest concern tonight,\u201d Malone said. \u201cObviously, you\u2019re worried about guarding them. But how would we reach from that emotional hangover? I thought or guys did a pretty good job. Obviously, defensively we have to be a lot better moving forward. Defense was not a part of the game from either team tonight. But we were able to get enough stops. \u2026 You use the word resiliency and that\u2019s very appropriate.\u201d The budding duo of Jokic (37 points, nine rebounds, six assists) and Murray (23 points, eight assists and just one turnover) proving to be too much for the Blazers to handle after halftime and especially down the stretch. They are the two who could drive this team to places no one imagined last season, when the Nuggets missed out on the playoffs on the last night of the regular season with a loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves. Murray is still learning be the point guard his team needs, both as a scorer and facilitator. Jokic is still getting comfortable in his All-Star and Kia MVP-candidate skin, which requires him to be a much more aggressive scorer in addition to the brilliant facilitator that makes the Nuggets\u2019 offense go. \u201cHe just picks his spots,\u201d Murray said of Jokic\u2019s evolution. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t force many plays, he sees the open man, but he\u2019s such a willing passer. He also gets his teammates involved and sometimes when has an easy shot, he doesn\u2019t take it. But that hasn\u2019t been the case, especially in games where we were down 2-1 against San Antonio. He was just being aggressive, Game 7, being aggressive. I think he\u2019s found his mission when he has to go the rack and when he has to defer and pass it.\u201d * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

The pace has relatively slow and defense has ruled the day, with the two teams combining to barely score a point per possession (386:385) through two games. The Raptors have now held their opponent under a point per possession in six straight contests , but the Sixers were the better defensive team in Game 2 on Monday, and they evened the series with a 94-89 victory . Leonard and Pascal Siakam torched the Sixers for 74 combined points on 74-percent shooting in Game 1 on Saturday. Those numbers surely weren\u2019t sustainable. But the Sixers weren\u2019t going to stand pat and count on regression. Instead, they Sixers put their best and biggest defenders on the Raptors\u2019 forwards from the jump in Game 2. Ben Simmons had the Leonard assignment, and Joel Embiid guarded Siakam. The adjustments worked. Leonard still scored 35 points on Monday, but wasn\u2019t as comfortable stepping into his pull-up jumper as he was two nights earlier and made just 3-of-12 shots from outside the paint. Siakam toasted Embiid with a Siakam special (reverse pivot spin move) early in the first quarter. But more typical of his night was the previous possession, when Embiid sat back on a Kyle Lowry-Siakam pick-and-roll and Siakam missed a one-handed push shot from 14 feet out. The favorite for the Kia Most Improved Award was 7-for-12 in the restricted area, but shot more and worse (2-for-13) from outside it. \u201cI like that shot,\u201d Siakam said of his floaters. \u201cI got to make that.\u201d He can say that, but there\u2019s a big difference between a layup and a shot just a few feet from the basket. In the regular season, Siakam shot 71 percent in the restricted area , but just 43 percent on other shots in the paint. Both of those numbers are better than average, but keep him from getting all the way to the rim, and dramatically increase the chances of getting a stop. The Raptors weren\u2019t completely stunned by the Sixers\u2019 adjustments. But it took time. In the first quarter of Game 1, they scored on 15 straight possessions \u2013 on their way to 39 points by the end of the period. On Monday, the Raptors scored just nine points on their first 15 possessions. The Sixers\u2019 defenders stayed in front of their man, their rotations were sharp, and the Raptors couldn\u2019t get where they wanted to go. \u201cI thought our defense at the start of the game,\u201d Sixers coach Brett Brown said, \u201cwas almost as good as it could be.\u201d The assignment changes left Tobias Harris guarding Marc Gasol, but the Raptors\u2019 center was unable to take advantage. His post-ups sparked a 7-2 run in the third quarter, but Gasol finished with just five points on 1-for-6 shooting. \u201cI feel like putting Harris on Marc probably got us out of rhythm a little bit,\u201d Leonard admitted. \u201cOnce we started figuring it out, I feel like we started playing better.\u201d Not much better. That 7-2 run via Gasol post-ups was the only time the Raptors scored on more than two straight trips down the floor in the first 45 minutes. With Leonard drawing more than just Simmons\u2019 attention, there were opportunities for other Raptors to make shots. According to Second Spectrum tracking, Leonard passed the ball twice as often in Game 2 (38 times) as he did in Game 1 (19). But the Raptors shot just 10-for-37 from 3-point range. Danny Green, who ranked second in 3-point percentage during the regular season (45.5 percent), was 1-for-6 on Monday. When the Raptors finally put together a string of four straight scores late in the fourth quarter, Green got a wide-open 3-point attempt to tie the game with 10 seconds left \u2026 and it rimmed out. \u201cI think we\u2019re doing a pretty good job of attacking them and getting downhill and getting it inside,\u201d said Raptors coach Nick Nurse. \u201cThey\u2019re sending a lot of bodies. We saw that in the first series and we\u2019ve got to make the right reads out. When do, you\u2019ve got to knock them down. You can take \u2019em all day, you\u2019ve got to make some.\u201d \u201cWe got lucky there at the end,\u201d Brown admitted. The Sixers haven\u2019t been efficient offensively in either game of this series. Embiid is 7-for-25 from the field, Butler and Harris have each made fewer than 40 percent of their shots, and Philly has committed 36 turnovers in two games. But it doesn\u2019t matter how many points you score, as long as you score more than your opponent. And the difference between Games 1 and 2 has been on the Raptors\u2019 end of the floor . On Monday, it was the Sixers who dictated what happened. As a result, they\u2019ve taken home-court advantage as this series heads to Philadelphia for Games 3 and 4. \u201cWhen we play like that, guard like that,\u201d said Jimmy Butler said, \u201cwe\u2019re such a good team.\u201d * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

But if they underreact in Game 2 Tuesday at Fiserv Forum, it will be at their own peril. Adjustments \u2014 from game-to-game, at halftime, even on the fly during live action \u2014 are as much a part of the NBA postseason as podium interviews. The reason is simple: Strategic mistakes, small failings and tendencies you can get away with facing random teams during the season are sniffed out and exploited by an opponent you see as many as seven times in a two-week span. You can stubbornly stick with a pat hand, but most coaches and players would rather change things up to minimize what didn\u2019t work last time and might, if repeated, prove fatal again. The Bucks, though, sounded a little clingy Monday in the wake of their 112-90 defeat. Wanting to hold on to everything that worked so well from October until, well, noon on April 28. \u201cNo, no. Definitely not,\u201d forward Giannis Antetokounmpo said. \u201cWe\u2019re just going to keep doing what we\u2019ve been doing all year.\u201d You might be inclined to read that quote assuming sarcasm, as in: Oh right, we\u2019re just going to keep doing exactly what got us blown out and stripped of home-court advantage. Sure. After all, Antetokounmpo had one of his worst performances of the season (7-for-21 FGs, a minus-24 rating). But no, \u201cThe Greek Freak\u201d was sincere. \u201cI don\u2019t think there should be no change at all,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy should there be a change after a game that we lost, like \u2026 we should not be the team that makes the adjustments.\u201d Antetokounmpo was not alone. \u201cThe way we\u2019ve been playing all season has been just letting it fly,\u201d center Brook Lopez said. \u201cSo even if we miss it 10-out-of-10 times, just keep [shooting].\u201d The Bucks made 13 of their 39 3-point shots Sunday, well off their regular-season rate of 38.2 percent. Lopez was 1-for-4 on 3s and 1-for-5 overall, combining with fellow Bucks starters Sterling Brown and Eric Bledsoe to shoot 3-for-17 from the floor. Said Milwaukee coach Mike Budenholzer: \u201cI think adjustments and all those things are sometimes overrated.\u201d So unless the Bucks are trying to snooker the Celtics with some tweaks they weren\u2019t willing to share, we\u2019ll get to see how that pat hand plays out. Milwaukee did get serious mileage out of its formulas prior to Game 1. Offensively, they\u2019ve surrounded Antetokounmpo with potent 3-point shooters, relying on his drives into the lane to draw defenders and offer them unobstructed views from the arc. Defensively, they committed to defending the other guys\u2019 3-pointers, protecting the rim and keeping foes off the foul line. What did that leave? Contested 2-pointers and mid-range jumpers \u2014 so ugly and out-of-style in the NBA of 2019. It all worked tremendously \u2014 until the Celtics shot 15-of-27 on mid-range attempts in their rout. Suddenly, the Bucks\u2019 sagging defense against pick-and-rolls looked as gimmicky and ineffective as its plan of guarding Houston\u2019s James Harden from behind. Once the prolific Rockets scorer got over his shock at the unusual method, he was able to pick it apart. Ditto for the Celtics\u2019 shooters. Kyrie Irving is one of the most dangerous scorers from any place on the floor but particularly inventing ways to put the ball in the hoop in the mid-range. Celtics veteran Al Horford savored his looks inside the arc, as did Gordon Hayward. The Bucks, meanwhile, were 5-of-12 from mid-range. However, there is one area in which the Bucks believe they can adjust without adjusting. They can play harder. A pervasive lack of hustle and urgency was apparent in real time at Fiserv but was undeniable when Budenholzer and his staff went to \u201cthe truth machine\u201d before practice Monday. That would be the video the Bucks reviewed before Monday\u2019s workout. \u201cHe chewed us out. And like I say, \u2018Film don\u2019t lie,\u2019 \u201d Bledsoe said. \u201cIt was effort, man. We weren\u2019t playing our game.\u201d Antetokounmpo said he got scolded on that front in a postgame phone call from his older brother, Thanasis. \u201cNo. 1, I play for my family,\u201d he said. \u201cSo when he\u2019s like, \u2018C\u2019mon man. Giannis! You\u2019ve got to go, you\u2019ve got to go. You\u2019ve got to still be aggressive. You\u2019ve got to make the right pass,\u2019 it stabs you in your heart. But at the end of the day, I know it\u2019s the truth.\u201d The Bucks appeared a step slow on both ends. It showed when they went after loose balls or closed out on Celtics shooters. And it showed when lollygagging, relatively, in getting to their spots on offense. Boston already was sending extra defenders at Antetokounmpo, and the Bucks not being crisp in their execution never made them pay. \u201cWe weren\u2019t as quick in transition,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cOur pace wasn\u2019t great \u2026 We can be better at getting it out. Everyone running the floor, finding their spots. Keeping the spacing wide.\u201d It should be noted the Bucks only lost two games in a row one time all season (March 2-4 against the Jazz and Suns). They\u2019re proud of that resiliency. Of course, in the regular season, they only played the same opponent in consecutive games one time (New York, Dec. 25-27). The Bucks never had to react after losses to specific things the other guys did. They merely had to be themselves, only better. \u201cEven though we lost the first game, we\u2019re just gonna come out and play our hardest and see how Game 2 goes,\u201d Antetokounmpo said. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t go well for us, then you can think about adjusting. But right now, we\u2019re not adjusting nothing.\u201d But unless someone rattles Boston out of its comfort zone in the mid-range, Milwaukee\u2019s adherence to its style of play could contribute to its undoing. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Gregg Popovich enjoyed it so much he is coming back for a 24th season as coach in San Antonio. Normally extremely private, Popovich said Monday he is negotiating a new deal with the Spurs after his current contract expired this season. There was some uncertainty surrounding his return, but the 70-year-old Popovich put an end to that with a quip or two. \u201cI\u2019m currently in negotiations and could very well end up with either the Portofino Flyers or the Positano Pirates (or the Spurs),\u201d Popovich said dryly. \u201cI think it\u2019s like one-third Positano, one-third Portofino and one-third San Antonio. So, we\u2019ll see where I end up.\u201d There is little chance Popovich ends up anywhere but San Antonio, where he has enjoyed unprecedented success. His desire to return was apparent during an 18-minute news conference to wrap up a season that ended with a loss to the Denver Nuggets in Game 7 of their first-round series. Popovich has1,245 wins, third-most in NBA history behind Don Nelson and Lenny Wilkens, and is one of five coaches to win five NBA championships. He will coach USA Basketball in the FIBA World Cup in China this summer, and will coach the Americans in the Tokyo Olympics next summer should the team qualify. The Spurs have reached the playoffs the last 22 seasons, a streak that ties for the longest in NBA history. Many doubted the Spurs would continue that streak this season with all the turmoil and turnover. A year ago, Kawhi Leonard played in only nine games while nursing a right thigh injury. Reportedly upset with how his rehabilitation was handled, Leonard forced his way out of San Antonio in the offseason and was sent to Toronto along with Danny Green in a trade for DeMar DeRozan and Jakob Poeltl. The Spurs also lost Manu Ginobili to retirement and Tony Parker left the team in free agency along with veteran Kyle Anderson. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what to expect, to be honest,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know how this group would respond to that kind of adversity, but they showed us a lot in continuing with the program and trying to do what we wanted them to do. So, that was very impressive to me.\u201d San Antonio had eight new players on its roster this season, the most in Popovich\u2019s tenure. That turned out to be one of the highlights for the veteran coach. \u201cIt was kind of one of the more enjoyable seasons because you got to see people develop,\u201d Popovich said. If that wasn\u2019t enough to overcome, the Spurs also lost starting point guard Dejounte Murray to a season-ending knee injury in the preseason and his replacement, Derrick White, missed the first month with a knee injury. In one four-game stretch, the Spurs lost three games by 30-plus points; in Popovich\u2019s first 1,758 regular-season games as coach, the Spurs had only lost by 30-plus five total times. Of course, they also won five straight games by 25-plus points for the first time under Popovich and ended up seventh in the Western Conference as DeRozan and veteran LaMarcus Aldridge helped carry the team\u2019s young roster. \u201cI think that when we all reflect on the season, they achieved a lot more than a lot of people gave them credit for having the opportunity to achieve,\u201d Popovich said. San Antonio was able to reach the postseason while also developing young players like White, Poeltl and Bryn Forbes on the court and prepping rookies Lonnie Walker IV, Chimezie Metu and Drew Eubanks in the G League. \u201cIt\u2019s the beginning of a new culture for a new group,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cSo, we\u2019ll have a little bit of corporate knowledge going into next season and they\u2019ll show that, I think.\u201d"},{"id":33998,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/l2m-report-game-1-warriors-rockets","date":"2019-04-29","title":"L2M Report: Correct non-call on Harden's late 3-pointer in Game 1","content":"The NBA\u2019s Last-Two Minute report says there were three incorrect non-calls in Game 1 of the Western Conference semifinals between the Golden State Warriors and Houston Rockets.

He told reporters on Friday he was on the mend, but recovering from the injury was taking time. \u201cIt\u2019s getting there, it\u2019s a process,\u201d Kanter said before practice on Friday. \u201cI think the Blazers doing a very good job taking care of it. Obviously I\u2019m not going to lie, it hurts pretty bad. I\u2019m having a hard time changing my shirt or even eating food. It\u2019s a process, just taking it day-by-day, seeing how it feels.\u201d Even if Kanter does suit up, a considerable amount of the front court minutes will also go to youngsters Meyers Leonard and Zach Collins. Kanter, 26, has had a somewhat turbulent season already. He was waived by the New York Knicks following the trade deadline. Once a starter, he fell out of the rotation altogether when New York \u2013 which finished with the worst record in the league \u2014 turned its focus to younger players. He was signed by the Blazers just before the All-Star break as a backup to starter Jusuf Nurkic. But Kanter became vitally important for Portland when Nurkic broke his leg in an overtime victory at home over the Brooklyn Nets on March 25. Nurkic was averaging 15.6 points and 10.4 rebounds a game this season. Kanter averaged 13.1 points and 8.6 rebounds in 23 games down the stretch with the Blazers, including eight starts. In the playoffs, he is averaging 13.2 points and 10.2 rebounds. In Game 1 against the Thunder, he had 20 points and 18 rebounds and was dubbed the game\u2019s MVP by teammate Damian Lillard. He has faced challenges beyond the court as well. A native of Turkey, Kanter missed a game in Toronto shortly after joining the Blazers because he thought his life might be in danger if he left the United States. As a result of his criticism of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Kanter had been labeled a terrorist by his native country. His passport was revoked and Turkey has reportedly issued a warrant for his arrest with Interpol. Kanter has been working out lightly and doing some lifting. The concern isn\u2019t just whether he can play through the pain, but whether there\u2019s a chance for further damage, he said. He said he will work with the team\u2019s trainers and see how the shoulder feels. \u201cThey just said it\u2019s a separation, it\u2019s normally around a month to just heal it,\u201d he said last week. \u201cBut I mean, you don\u2019t have a month to take off, so I\u2019m just going to push through it.\u201d Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":34032,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/thunder-sam-presti-anticipates-billy-donovan-will-return","date":"2019-04-29","title":"Presti 'anticipates' Donovan will return as Thunder coach","content":" Oklahoma City Thunder general manager Sam Presti made it clear today: he is planning on Billy Donovan returning as coach. Presti said at today\u2019s news conference that he \u201canticipates\u201d Donovan returning for his fifth season. Donovan, who has gone 199-120 in four seasons as OKC\u2019s coach, had the option for his fifth season picked up in November. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t expect anything to change,\u201d Presti said. \u201cThere\u2019s nobody that works harder than him.\u201d Despite the winning record during the season, Donovan is 4-12 in the playoffs over the last three seasons. Since Kevin Durant left the team via free agency in 2016, the Thunder has lost three straight playoff series \u2014 the most recent coming a week ago at the hands of the Portland Trail Blazers . Presti told reporters he hasn\u2019t had a chance to sit down and talk with Donovan, but that Donovan\u2019s perspective on the season and team is important.. One of the other key topics addressed at Presti\u2019s news conference was that of star guard Russell Westbrook. The All-Star averaged a triple-double for the third straight season and nearly averaged one in the playoffs. But Portland bounced the Thunder in five games, and Westbrook\u2019s poor shooting played a significant role in another first-round exit. He shot 36 percent from the floor during the series and made just 11 of 31 field goals in the deciding Game 5 loss. He got into a verbal altercation with fans in Utah, led the league with 16 technical fouls and was suspended a game for them, engaged in trash talking with Portland\u2019s Damian Lillard during the playoffs and responded during postgame news conferences with, \u201cNext question.\u201d Regarding Westbrook\u2019s issues and off-the-court demeanor, Presti was nothing but supportive of his star. \u201cRussell Westbrook has been here 11 years. The reason there\u2019s so many people in the room and people watching is Russell Westbrook has helped up achieve as certain level,\u201d Presti said. \u201cWith all that being said, he\u2019s not perfect, none of us are. I\u2019m not going to let 11 years of his contributions and performance be completely overshadowed by a couple of pretty tough months. \u201cAs a leader of the team and face of the franchise, we\u2019ll have those conversations. Would we prefer he handled a few things differently? Yeah, we\u2019ve talked about that. He made an adjustment to that particular approach and I think that\u2019s a sign of growth.\u201d Change may be afoot for the Thunder after another disappointing playoff performance, but Presti is not in a rush to make knee-jerk transactions as a result of that. \u201cWe\u2019re not looking to be quick. We\u2019re looking to be rigorous,\u201d Presti said. \u201cWe\u2019re looking to be the same problem-solving group we have been over the years \u2026 pretty methodical. We just don\u2019t have the liberty to be momentary problem solvers. \u201cOur greatest path to improvement is going to be the improvement of our core group.\u201d Guard Paul George was solid statistically this season (28.6 ppg, 8.6 rpg, 3.6 apg, 43.6 FG pct., 31.9 3pt FG pct), but could face surgery on his right shoulder in the offseason. His status for the series against Portland was initially up in the air before Game 1 , but he wound up playing the entire season. He declined to comment on the specifics of his injury in last Thursday\u2019s exit interviews, but wants to get it resolved before 2019-20 tips off. Presti said the team will work with George to get the injury handled this offseason. \u201cEverybody knows he was battling a couple of different things throughout the year,\u201d Presti said . \u201cWe work with the agent, the player, a specialist. Everybody felt comfortable with him playing, but we knew that at the end of the season he\u2019d have to be looked at.\u201d OKC\u2019s playoff exit comes after a surprising first-round, six-game series loss to the Utah Jazz in 2018 and a five-game exit at the hands of the Houston Rockets in 2017 . The Thunder were aggressive in the offseason following each exit, adding former All-Star Carmelo Anthony and George to their group in the 2017 offseason and, last summer, picking up reserve guard Dennis Schroder and Nerlens Noel (among others) while also re-signing the free agent George. How much roster and salary cap flexibility the Thunder have this summer is limited. George is in the midst of his four-year contract while Schroder and starting center Steven Adams each have two more seasons left on their deals. Westbrook signed a five-year, $205 million deal in 2017 as well. Noel and reserve Patrick Patterson both have player options this summer, while veterans Raymond Felton and Markieff Morris will be unrestricted free agents.

And that place is right in the eyes of the nearest official, which means if this keeps up, then it\u2019s not Warriors vs. Rockets in the Western Conference semifinals, it\u2019s Annoyed Player vs. Overwhelmed Referee. A perfect logo for Warriors-Rockets is a player (or coach) with outstretched arms, arched eyebrows, gaping mouth and bewildered expression. The flavor of this highly anticipated Game 1 was noticeably salty and possibly pushy as well. But, that all depends on whether the league office believes an agitated Chris Paul brushed referee Josh Tiven during the tense, closing seconds of the Warriors\u2019 104-101 victory . If so, then the Rockets have bigger problems than falling behind 1-0 in the series as Paul might be facing a suspension. Regardless of that ruling, what\u2019s certain to endure is the game within the game \u2014 Harden\u2019s tactics designed to draw fouls, the Warriors\u2019 ability to avoid them (or not), the boundary-pushing of a shooter\u2019s \u201clanding space\u201d and of course, the judgment of the men whose whistles serve as the final say. Rockets coach Mike D\u2019Antoni earned one of three Houston technicals, and Paul was hit with the other two and the ejection that came along . The game was chippy and the language was blue. At times, spectacle interfered with the spectacular \u2014 as in Kevin Durant\u2019s continued scorching pace in the post-season: 35 points in this latest spree. Much is on the line here. Harden is perhaps the toughest cover in the game, so crafty with the dribble, so stretchy with the shooting range, so knowledgable with his body and the angles which he uses to make contact and manipulate the officials. This is, of course, nothing new. This helped Harden win the Kia MVP last season and compile even more historical numbers and feats this season. This is his gift. \u201cHe\u2019s an amazing player,\u201d said Warriors guard Stephen Curry. \u201cSo the approach against him has to be the same, the attention to detail and the awareness of all five of our guys on the floor. We gotta try to wear on him as much as possible.\u201d This is someone who averaged 36.1 points a game and heavily controls the ball, dictating the Rockets\u2019 flow and, by extension, their chances of winning games. When he doesn\u2019t get the benefit of the doubt and\/or becomes bogged down by inefficiency \u2014 and both were the case Sunday \u2014 the Rockets labor. After making his pleas during the game, ones he felt fell on deaf ears, Harden reiterated postgame that he could use some assistance, and not just from Paul and Eric Gordon and Clint Capela. \u201cJust call the game the way it\u2019s supposed to be called and we\u2019ll live with the results,\u201d Harden said, adding with some exasperation, \u201cI just want a fair chance, man.\u201d But what is fair? That\u2019s the question that could determine the length of this series or at least the manner in which the Warriors D-up. Coach Steve Kerr put forward Andre Iguodala in the starting lineup, hoping to get \u201cPlayoff Andre\u201d \u2013 and for the most part, did \u2013 from a wise veteran who knows the ropes. Also, Iguodala was important because Klay Thompson, who would normally guard Harden, only did so on 17 possessions (compared to Iguodala\u2019s 37 ). The second line of defense was Draymond Green, who combined with Thompson to hold Harden to just 9-for-28 shooting overall and 4-for-16 on 3-pointers. It was effective defense or, in Harden\u2019s view, suspiciously effective. Harden\u2019s sticking point was his landing point, specifically the reasonable space that a shooter is given once he lands after a jumper. He felt that space was constantly violated, especially in the closing seconds of a three-point game when Green rushed him with a raised hand and then stood still while Harden\u2019s kicking legs made contact with Green. Foul or not? Well, the whistle stayed silent, so the answer was negative. Harden raised the potential for injury and cited \u201cwe all know what happened a few years back with Kawhi,\u201d referring to Kawhi Leonard\u2019s injury in Game 1 of the 2017 Western Conference finals after he made contact with Zaza Pachulia . Of course, once relayed by media, this drew a reaction from some of the Warriors. Green turned comical and said loudly: \u201cHuh?\u201d He added: \u201cI\u2019ve been fouled by James on a James 3-pointer before, so I ain\u2019t trying to hear that,\u201d Green was referencing moments when Harden either leans into a defender or whip-kicks a leg, forcing that determination of who initiated contact and whether it necessitates a whistle. Green said Harden is deliberately stretching the landing spot in order to get calls. Does that landing space become an airport runway? \u201cWhen you land three feet ahead of where you shoot the ball from,\u201d Green said, \u201cthat ain\u2019t my issue.\u201d Such is the challenge of guarding and officiating a game with Harden in it. \u201cYou have to figure out how they\u2019re calling the game and you adjust as the series goes on,\u201d Iguodala said. \u201cTry to figure that out earlier than later. And he\u2019s a great player so you need patience and being disciplined. We\u2019ve got a great defensive unit with good individual players, but the league is geared toward offensive players and I\u2019m not as good defensively as James is offensively, so I got to rely on help. I know Draymond is behind me and has my back.\u201d Whether or not he\u2019s getting the calls, the issue for Harden remains the same in these playoffs: His shot is faultier than usual and he\u2019s being forced to work harder for the ones that do fall. His shooting percentage has dropped from 44.2 percent in the regular season to 36.4 percent in the playoffs. Even if Harden gets to the free throw line, and he attempted 14 in Game 1, the Warriors will take that every time. The goal is to get him to miss far more than he makes, which minimizes the chances of him dropping 40 or 50 points and completely breaking down the Warriors\u2019 defense. \u201cYou have to be very disciplined,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cAnd you have to be able to play without putting your hands on the cookie jar.\u201d Certainly, Houston needs more. There\u2019s also the potential impact of Paul, who was mostly neutralized and made only five baskets. He never hurt Golden State but, depending on the determination of the league office about that murky contact with the ref, he might hurt the Rockets if socked with a suspension. Also, the Warriors took away the damaging lob passes that Harden sneaks to Capela; he only scored one basket and played just 26 minutes because the Warriors never really had a true center on the floor \u2014 and appear ready to go this entire series without one. Harden and the Rockets can continue to work the referees and bark at calls they feel are unfair and maybe it\u2019s all with some justification. Or there\u2019s another choice in this series. \u201cWe just need to suck it up and not worry about how they officiate and take it, yeah,\u201d said D\u2019Antoni. He was being sarcastic. Possibly. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years. You can e-mail him  here , find his archive here  and follow him on  Twitter  .

A perfect offensive start to Game 1 of their best-of-seven series against Boston would look something like Giannis grabbing the basketball, racing downcourt with one of his breathtaking, three-dribble, end-to-end run-outs and attacking the rim with the ferocity and scowl with which he\u2019s played all season. Perfect, that is, until Jaylen Brown slides over to plant himself between Antetokounmpo and the restricted area. Whoops! Pancaked Jaylen gets the whistle, while chastened Giannis picks up his first foul and turnover of the Sunday matinee. It\u2019s a strategy out of judo or jiu-jitsu, using your opponent\u2019s power and aggression to your advantage, and it\u2019s one the Celtics likely will deploy against the Bucks\u2019 star and Kia MVP candidate. Getting between Antetokounmpo and the rim isn\u2019t the most comfortable way to defend the against the Greek Freak\u2019s drives into the lane, his maddening Euro Step and his ability to reach up, over and beyond with arms fit for a crane. He\u2019s all elbows and knees, muscles and bones, and at 6-foot-11 and 242 pounds, he\u2019s been giving as much physical punishment as he takes this season. A defender has to absorb that and then sell the move, too, falling backward to the floor. No fun. But it might be one of the few effective ways to slow \u2013 if not stop \u2013 Antetokounmpo on a Bucks possession, with the added benefits of killing momentum, planting some doubt and ticking up his personal fouls count closer toward an all-critical sixth. Brown and Celtics teammate Terry Rozier both suggested Antetokounmpo could be slowed by such a maneuver. Celtics coach Brad Stevens, in a conference call with reporters Saturday, wasn\u2019t so sure. \u201cThe bottom line is, if you go downhill with the force and speed that he does, there are going to be moments where he charges,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cThere also are moments where he draws blocking fouls and scores \u2018and-ones.\u2019 He does that a lot more than he charges. \u201cSo you\u2019d better not let him get that head of steam very often.\u201d Easier said than done. Antetokounmpo has become one of the most ferocious rim attackers in the league. He was seemingly unstoppable inside this season, shooting 72.6 percent from five feet or less per NBA.com stats. With 583 field goals from that range, Antetokounmpo had nearly 100 more than the league\u2019s No. 2, Detroit center Andre Drummond (486). Oh, and counting the games against the Pistons in the first round, Antetokounmpo has successfully dunked the ball 289 times \u2013 119 of which have come without assists, meaning either put-backs or throwdowns in which he brought the ball in there with him. Here\u2019s where the 24-year-old\u2019s attack mode can be used against him: He also committed 68 offensive fouls this season \u2013 tied for most in the NBA with Minnesota\u2019s Karl-Anthony Towns. Certainly he got fouled with the ball way more than he fouled \u2013 Antetokounmpo shot 686 free throws , second only to James Harden\u2019s 858. Nearly seven of his 27.7 points per game came from the line. But foul trouble can slow Antetokounmpo\u2019s roll, as with anybody. If it\u2019s early enough or severe enough, it can take him off the floor completely, and for long stretches. At the least, it might make him a bit less assertive, a wee more passive the next time he might otherwise barrel downcourt. \u201cI definitely keep it in my mind,\u201d Antetokounmpo said Friday, asked about the charge\/block challenge he might face against the Celtics. \u201cIt\u2019s not just them. A lot of teams try to stop me by taking charges. \u201cBut that\u2019s the fun part about it. They\u2019re not thinking about how they\u2019re going to defend me; they\u2019re thinking about how they\u2019re going to try to take charges. If I can be under control and be at my own pace and try to be smart with not taking charges, if I get to my spot it\u2019s going to be tough.\u201d Here\u2019s a breakdown of Antetokounmpo\u2019s impact with and without nagging foul concerns: In the 31 games in which he was called for four fouls or more (including two disqualifications with six), the Bucks star averaged 25.7 points and eight times logged fewer than 30 minutes. Milwaukee\u2019s record: 23-8 (.742). In the 41 games Antetokounmpo finished with three fouls or fewer , he averaged 29.2 points. He played at least 30 minutes in 34 of the 41, and the Bucks went 33-8 (.805). Boston has defenders willing to give up their bodies, including three of the NBA\u2019s top 20 in charges drawn: Aron Baynes (18), Marcus Smart (15) and Kyrie Irving (13). Smart, still out with a left oblique tear, won\u2019t play in at least the first two games of the series. But Semi Ojeleye is a physical forward who drew Antetokounmpo as an assignment at times in the three regular season meetings \u2013 he started twice \u2013 and took three charges this season. In the three games, Antetokounmpo was called for a total of seven fouls, including three charges. (For the record, Milwaukee\u2019s Ersan Ilyasova led the NBA in that defensive category with 50, despite playing only 1,231 minutes in 67 games.) Several Celtics will try standing in or stepping in, depending how the referees call it, against Antetokounmpo. It will take timing, footwork, physical sacrifice \u2026 and some good fortune. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those things that\u2019s easier said than done,\u201d said Milwaukee coach Mike Budenholzer. \u201cLuckily for us, it\u2019s nothing that he hasn\u2019t seen or nothing new.\u201d Said Stevens: \u201cThe No. 1 thing [Giannis] has always been is exceptional downhill, exceptional in transition. And when I say \u2018exceptional\u2019 I mean one of very few to ever have played the game. \u201cI just think, ultimately, you have to be able to move your feet. You have to be able to guard with pride. You have to be able to do all that, but nobody can do that by themselves against him.\u201d * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Actually, kinda hard to give it to the Raptors or 76ers either. I\u2019m waving the white flag on this one . Shaun Powell : It\u2019s hard to tell because of the lack of competition; the 5-through-8 seeds were all flawed and none won a home game. That said, let\u2019s give this to the Celtics , who needed a friction-free first round and they got it. With Kyrie Irving and Gordon Hayward \u2014 both missing last spring \u2014 delivering solid performances, this was finally the Celtics team we originally expected to see . But Boston\u2019s problem all year is consistency and wild mood swings. Let\u2019s see what this round brings. John Schuhmann : The Bucks remain the best team in the East, but it\u2019s difficult to take much out of a series against an 8 seed that was missing its best players for two of the four games. Toronto\u2019s dispatching of the Orlando Magic was more noteworthy in that the Raptors looked like the defensive force that we thought they could be when they added Kawhi Leonard, Danny Green and, eventually, Marc Gasol to a team that ranked fifth defensively last year. In winning four straight playoff games for the first time in franchise history, the Raps allowed Orlando to score just 93 points per 100 possessions . If they have all these great defenders on the same page, the Raptors are really freaking good . Sekou Smith : I know this could come back to bite me in the coming days, but the Celtics suddenly resemble the team we thought they\u2019d be in the preseason , when we were all picking them as the crew most likely to upset the Golden State Warriors in their bid for a third straight title run. They played the most difficult (on paper, at least) opponent in the first round and handled the Pacers. Their quality of depth, the superpower that was supposed to propel them to the top of the standings this season) has finally come into focus now. The reason so many of us refused to jump off the Celtics\u2019 bandwagon during the regular season was because we knew they were capable of playing the way they did in the first round. Now all they have to do is do it again while facing the best team in the league all season . We\u2019ve all been pointing to the Eastern Conference semifinals for months. We knew what the possibilities were, if everyone stayed true to the game, to their specific missions. And now it\u2019s here, staring us all in the face. Steve Aschburner : Milwaukee. I can\u2019t make a case against the Bucks\u2019 level of play, anyway, even though they had the least formidable of the first-round foes. They still miss Malcolm Brogdon, Nikola Mirotic hasn\u2019t found his rhythm yet after his thumb injury, and a series could quickly turn on Giannis Antetokounmpo getting into (offensive) foul trouble for a game or two. Toronto seems pretty well-oiled these days in depth and performance, Philadelphia might have the highest capacity to blow out opponents and Boston is finding itself at the right time. But yes, in the moment, as a snapshot, the answer here is Bucks. * * *"},{"id":34066,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-biggest-surprise-2019-nba-playoffs","date":"2019-04-27","title":"Blogtable: Biggest surprise so far in these playoffs?","content":" * * * Biggest surprise in these playoffs so far?   * * * Tas Melas :  Damian Lillard\u2019s growth. I did not expect him to carry a team the way he did. He enters an elite level of player who can drag his team to a series win: LeBron, Durant, Curry, Harden, Kawhi, Giannis (a little projection on my part with Antetokounmpo.) Shaun Powell :  With all due respect to the plucky Spurs and Gregg Popovich, the Clippers taking a pair from the Warriors gets the slight nod. Keep in mind the Warriors with Kevin Durant had lost two or more games in a series only once before, and the Warriors in the Steve Kerr era were 16-2 in first-round series. And of course, the Clippers lacked an All-Star and home court advantage. John Schuhmann :  With apologies to the Blazers\u2019 ability to dispatch the Thunder so quickly, I think the biggest surprise is the Warriors losing two games at home in the first round . Over the last two postseasons, the champs were 19-1 at Oracle Arena. Maybe their stumbles against the Clippers (who deserve credit for not being overwhelmed by a 31-point deficit or a 3-1 deficit) will be a footnote on their third straight championship, and maybe it\u2019s the first sign that we\u2019re going to have a new champion this year. The Warriors didn\u2019t need to win either of those games, but there was a clear penalty (playing an additional game while the Rockets rested) for losing Game 5 and they couldn\u2019t get the stops they needed. Sekou Smith :  The Clippers shocked me. I knew they were a grinding, blue-collar crew that was easy to root for. But to see them push the Warriors the way they did, in particular at Oracle Arena, was a revelation. Could there be a better advertisement for free agency? Seeing the culture of this team and how they were locked in together for the challenge, it was something special. They have young guys to continue to develop and two of the best bench players in the league already in place. Toss in all that cap space, Los Angeles as a backdrop and a coach (Doc Rivers), front office (led by Lawrence Frank) and owner (Steve Ballmer) that any fan base would love to have, and what\u2019s not to like about what\u2019s going on in Clipper Land? Steve Aschburner :  The tenacity of the Los Angeles Clippers against Golden State has gotten so much attention, I\u2019ve got to zag where others might zig. So I\u2019m going with Portland\u2019s manhandling of Oklahoma City . This required equal portions of Trail Blazers goodness and Thunder underachievement. It wasn\u2019t just Damian Lillard kicking Russell Westbrook\u2019s butt in their positional matchup in the series, it was Enes Kantner outproducing Steven Adams and C.J. McCollum keeping pace with Paul George. The Thunder didn\u2019t keep Portland off the offensive glass, shot worse (per eFG%) and turned over the ball at a higher rate in suffering its third consecutive first-round ouster. I was surprised by OKC\u2019s overall lack of pushback.

Meeting a round earlier benefits the Rockets\u2019 best player because James Harden\u2019s performance declines as he gets deeper in to the playoffs. The Warriors just lost consecutive home games for the first time since the Cavs in 2016 (the 3-1 horror show) which means home court doesn\u2019t mean all that much. These Warriors don\u2019t look as on point as their last two championship teams. The Rockets are better rested, Steph turned his ankle Friday, and so did Klay. Still, they\u2019re the favorite. Shaun Powell :  Same chance. Unless you strongly believe Trevor Ariza would\u2019ve made a big difference in this series, this is virtually the same core the Rockets offered up last season when they took the Warriors to the limit. It\u2019s all about James Harden and Kevin Durant, and how efficient they can be. One advantage is Harden is seeing the Warriors much earlier this time, meaning he\u2019s fresh compared to last spring. John Schuhmann :  It\u2019s about the same , which means that they have a decent chance. Two factors in the Rockets\u2019 favor \u2026 1. The Warriors look more vulnerable going into the series, having been unable to flip the switch defensively as well as they did last year. 2. James Harden has become an even better scorer over the last 12 months. Two points in the Warriors\u2019 favor \u2026 1. Not having Trevor Ariza makes it a little more difficult for the Rockets\u2019 defense to switch as effectively as it did last year. 2. The champs have home-court advantage this time. Sekou Smith :  The Rockets have a better chance this time around for a couple of reasons. The Warriors are even more vulnerable now than they were when the Rockets had them down 3-2 in the Western Conference finals last spring. And the Rockets, given their experience dealing with the Warriors in that setting, are better equipped to handle the challenge now. That doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m picking the Rockets to knock off the two-time reigning champs, not as long as the Warriors have home court advantage and a dialed in Kevin Durant on their side. But the opportunity is knocking for the Rockets (or perhaps someone else, say from the Eastern Conference) to end the Warriors\u2019 current run. Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson could both be dealing with lingering ankle issues in the conference semifinals and the Rockets have gotten a few extra days of rest. If ever they are going to do it, the time is now. Steve Aschburner :  Better chance. Now, let\u2019s not get it twisted, I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s going to happen. But I\u2019ve been saying for months that it might be 2-3 teams, rather than one, that knocks off the defending champs in a cumulative effort, and Houston just got more help than expected from the Clippers. It also has to have benefited from its experience against the Warriors in last year\u2019s playoffs. And Chris Paul is \u2013 for the moment, anyway \u2013 healthy. Golden State has not consistently looked like its former dominant self and get minimal time between rounds. Look, I don\u2019t think the Rockets are as good this spring as they were a year ago, but neither are the Warriors. So if Houston can avoid more 7-of-44 nonsense, they might flip the outcome. Might. * * *"},{"id":34028,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/memphis-grizzlies-tayshaun-prince-official-release","date":"2019-04-27","title":"Grizzlies promote Tayshaun Prince to Vice President of Basketball Affairs","content":" MEMPHIS, Tenn. \u2014 The Memphis Grizzlies today promoted Tayshaun Prince to Vice President of Basketball Affairs within the franchise\u2019s basketball operations department. \u201c We are excited to establish Tayshaun as a core member of our front office ,\u201d Executive Vice President of Basketball Operations  Zachary Z.

And maybe the Warriors needed seven months and 88 games to recognize this, because when you\u2019ve won three championships in four years and bring four All-Stars in their prime and play nightly against the rank-and-file, there\u2019s a tendency to doze off just to, you know, make things interesting. Well, nap\u2019s over. After Friday\u2019s 129-110 victory over the Clippers, the buzzer has shifted to the opening tip, and suddenly the Warriors are aware of where they are and who they\u2019re up against and what time it is. At least, those are the signals they\u2019re giving off now, on the eve of the second round of the playoffs, when there is no better moment \u2014 to paraphrase the noted prophet Kevin Durant \u2014 to let folks know who you are. They\u2019ll be led into their next basketball battle by Durant, fresh off a fiddy , which of course is basketball slang for 5-0 points, which finally silenced the Clippers and made the basketball world revisit the belief that the Warriors are not to be denied. This of course will be put to the test by the Rockets , arguably the biggest threat facing the Warriors between now and a June champagne sip. But really, now: If Durant plays like he has the last few games, does it really matter what James Harden and Chris Paul bring in this upcoming best-of-seven? \u201cHe\u2019s in a groove right now,\u201d said Steph Curry. \u201cSpecial to see.\u201d With the exception of last year\u2019s Western Conference finals, when Houston took Golden State to the limit, the Durant Warriors have been one level above all others in the playoffs. The Clippers just took two from them \u2014 despite Durant \u2014 and nobody else claimed more than one victory in a best-of-seven. Overall, excluding that Rockets\u2019 series, the Durants are 32-5 in the postseason, a clean 9-0 in series play. Everything that the Warriors were projected to do once Durant signed up for duty two summers ago has come true. They\u2019re three superstars ahead of good teams and two superstars ahead of very good teams. Right now, they\u2019re alone on the island, the only true great team in the league, even on nights when they don\u2019t play the part. With all due respect to Damian Lillard, no one has has drawn more awe lately than Durant, who\u2019s on pace to cause major problems for whomever crouches in a defensive stance before him. In the last four games, he averaged 42 points on 55 percent shooting, and at times was a singular force against the stubborn Clippers. Remember, Steph Curry is trying to climb out of a fog, stifled and troubled by missed jumpers in the last week and momentarily sidelined Friday by a tweaked right ankle, which always causes the Warriors to hold their breath. Klay Thompson, as is his pattern, went ballistic for one game, then was rather tame by comparison in the others. \u201cI just play my game through it all,\u201d Durant said. \u201cI definitely don\u2019t want to go away from my teammates if they\u2019re struggling to shoot the ball. But at the same time, I have to be aggressive and try to win the game as well.\u201d Given how leaky the Warriors\u2019 defense looked and how carelessly they handled the ball, the one constant in the first round was Durant drilling shots from all angles and distances, especially once he confined his chatter to making shots instead of taking them at Pat Beverley, the Clippers\u2019 All-Star instigator. Warriors coach Steve Kerr called it \u201cone of the greatest performances I\u2019ve ever seen\u201d and this is someone who rode with Michael Jordan and Tim Duncan. Whether Kerr was simply caught up in the moment, it doesn\u2019t minimize what Durant did to close out the Clippers and what he\u2019s capable of doing against the Rockets. \u201cHe\u2019s the ultimate weapon because there\u2019s no defense for Kevin,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cNo matter what anybody does, he can get a good shot. And he knew we needed him badly. And he just took over the game in the first half and set a great tone.\u201d Durant appears to be locked in and on a mission, and if this is his last run with the Warriors, it\u2019s morphing into a gallop. His 50 points Friday were a personal playoff high and his 38 in the first half tied Charles Barkley for second on the all-time list. And this came on the heels of the 45 points he delivered in a losing Game 5 effort. \u201cSometimes you come across special people and it doesn\u2019t matter what defense you send to them,\u201d said Clippers guard Lou Williams. \u201cThere is no scheme. There\u2019s nothing you can do with special people. He\u2019s one of them and he showed it. He put them guys on his shoulders. He proved exactly who people think he is, who he thinks of himself, and he did it.\u201d The Warriors finished with the best record in the West this season, almost on reputation or cruise control. Once again, there were lapses that seemed suspiciously like a team bored with the schedule and awaiting a summer coronation. This breezy attitude seeped into the opening round, when the Warriors choked away a 31-point lead and then lost another home game to an eighth-seeded team devoid of All-Stars. This doesn\u2019t happen unless the heavily-favored one-seed is taking their championship rings for granted. \u201cI think I made a joke like this first round felt like it was two months,\u201d said Curry. \u201cIt was just the emotional part of it, I mean, losing (DeMarcus Cousins) and a 31-point lead and trying to come back on the road and the mental investment you put into it. We\u2019ve got to be able to flip the switch from one team to the next and that will be the biggest test.\u201d Well, and this might be a stretch, but expect the Warriors to show the Rockets a lot more respect. Deep down, Kerr knows losing a pair to the Clippers was perhaps the face-slap his team needed, and at the right time. The Warriors know any lapse in this series will likely be their last, and a fatal one as well. \u201cWe know what Houston\u2019s about,\u201d said Kerr. \u201cWe know how good they are. We\u2019ve got to be ready.\u201d There are positive signs beyond Durant. Thompson will be the first line of defense against Harden, the league\u2019s leading scorer this season, and Thompson is coming off a lockdown of Williams, who finally cooled and went 3-for-21 Friday. This will be of major importance, of course, given Harden\u2019s usage rate and relentlessness. \u201cIf you\u2019re not focused,\u201d Durant said, \u201che can drive past you, he shoots floaters now, he\u2019s a strong finish with either hand and obviously the step-back 3-pointers is one of his staples. He can score in a variety of ways so you have to be locked in from the beginning. You\u2019ve got to be ready to play tough all game.\u201d Draymond Green is coming off a triple-double, while the aging Andre Iguodala seems springy and active, usually his profile this time of year. Yes, there\u2019s finally perhaps a sense of urgency or at least an understanding of what\u2019s at stake and more of an emphasis on staying woke for the Warriors. \u201cObviously we would love to win every series 4-0,\u201d said Durant. \u201cThat would be ideal. But we know it\u2019s not really going to happen that way.\u201d Perhaps not. But the Durant Warriors, based on their track record, are convincing enough. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

The spindly sharpshooter absolutely torched the Clippers in the first half of Friday\u2019s Game 6, drilling jumpers from all over the court and dunking without conscience en route to a ridiculous 38 points. In addition to setting a personal best for one half, it tied the second-highest total in NBA playoff history. The highest? Set by the illustrious Eric \u201cSleepy\u201d Floyd, who lit up the eventual-champion Lakers for 39 while playing for none other than \u2026 the Warriors, in 1987. Missing out on an obscure team record proved a minuscule price for Durant to pay on what otherwise was one of the most memorable outings of his career. In addition to leading the Warriors, finally, past the feisty Clippers and into the second round for a much-anticipated matchup with the Rockets, Durant finished with 50 to: * Set his overall playoff career high for the second time in as many games * Become the 24th player in league history to score 50 or more in a postseason game * Become the first player with 95-plus points over two non-overtime playoff games since Michael Jordan in 1993 * Tie for the ninth-highest scoring total in a road playoff game * Score the fourth-most points in a series clincher * Join Russell Westbrook, Kobe Bryant and Jordan as the only players in the past 30 postseasons with consecutive 45-point games. Whew! The 50-spot also completed an epic four-game stretch for Durant following his unusually passive performance (eight shots, 21 points) in the Warriors\u2019 Game 2 meltdown. Durant proceeded to shred the Clippers for 38, 33, 45 and finally 50 points, averaging more than a point per minute and shooting a ridiculous 57 percent in the process. Even his fellow players couldn\u2019t quite believe it: And when you\u2019re hitting shots like this \u2026 \u2026 against defense like that, a little idolatry is in order.

Beverley: \u201cWhat you think? (laughter) I mean, he\u2019s Kevin Durant.\u201d Williams: \u201cI promise we tried. We tried everything.

(AP) \u2014 Trail Blazers center Enes Kanter\u2019s status for the second round of the playoffs remains uncertain because of a shoulder injury as Portland waits to learn its opponent. Kanter says he separated his left shoulder early on during Portland\u2019s deciding Game 5 against Oklahoma City on Tuesday in the opening round. The Blazers returned to practice Friday. Kanter was shooting during the workout, although at times he rubbed the shoulder. \u201cI think the Blazers are doing a very good job taking care of it. But, I mean obviously, I\u2019m not going to lie, it hurts pretty bad,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean I\u2019m having a hard time changing my shirt or eating food. So it\u2019s a process. We\u2019re just taking it day by day, see how it feels.\u201d Despite the injury, Kanter had 13 points and 13 rebounds in Portland\u2019s 118-115 victory over the Thunder, which sent the Blazers through to the Western Conference semifinals. The Blazers will play the winner of the first-round series between the Nuggets and the Spurs, which is tied at 3-3. Game 7 is Saturday night in Denver. Blazers coach Terry Stotts said he was hopeful Kanter could play in Game 1, set for Monday regardless of the opponent. He said the extended break \u2013 Portland was the first team in the West to advance to the next round \u2013 will help. \u201cI know it\u2019s too early,\u201d Stotts said about the decision. \u201cThe good thing is we don\u2019t play until Monday, so we don\u2019t really have to make any decisions until then. So we\u2019re hopeful.\u201d Kanter, 26, has had a somewhat turbulent season already. He was waived by the New York Knicks following the trade deadline. Once a starter, he fell out of the rotation altogether when New York \u2013 which finished with the worst record in the league \u2013 turned its focus to younger players. He was signed by the Blazers just before the All-Star break as a backup to starter Jusuf Nurkic. But Kanter became vitally important for Portland when Nurkic broke his leg in an overtime victory at home over the Brooklyn Nets on March 25. Nurkic was averaging 15.6 points and 10.4 rebounds a game this season. Kanter averaged 13.1 points and 8.6 rebounds in 23 games down the stretch with the Blazers, including eight starts. In the playoffs, he is averaging 13.2 points and 10.2 rebounds. In Game 1 against the Thunder, he had 20 points and 18 rebounds and was dubbed the game\u2019s MVP by teammate Damian Lillard. He has faced challenges beyond the court as well. A native of Turkey, Kanter missed a game in Toronto shortly after joining the Blazers because he thought his life might be in danger if he left the United States. As a result of his criticism of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Kanter had been labeled a terrorist by his native country. His passport was revoked and Turkey has reportedly issued a warrant for his arrest with Interpol. For now, Kanter is working out lightly and doing some lifting. The concern isn\u2019t just whether he can play through the pain, but whether there\u2019s a chance for further damage, he said. He said he will work with the team\u2019s trainers and see how the shoulder feels. \u201cThey just said it\u2019s a separation, it\u2019s normally around a month to just heal it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I mean, you don\u2019t have a month to take off, so I\u2019m just going to push through it.\u201d"},{"id":34029,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/raptors-og-anunoby-out-game-1-vs-sixers","date":"2019-04-26","title":"Raptors' Anunoby to miss Game 1 vs. Sixers","content":" The Toronto Raptors made it through the first round without key reserve OG Anunoby in the lineup.

Milwaukee had hoped that Brogdon, who has been sidelined since mid-March with a plantar facia tear in his right foot, would be back in time for the semifinals. Coach Mike Budenholzer told reporters on Thursday that his return in the series hasn\u2019t been ruled out, but that Brogdon will not play in Sunday\u2019s Game 1 ( 1 ET, ABC ) or Tuesday\u2019s Game 2. \u201cWe\u2019ll reassess him after the first two,\u201d Budenholzer said, per Matt Velazquez of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel . \u201cWe\u2019re hopeful that it (his return) will be this series.

We\u2019ll assess it when we kind of get through this next little wave.\u201d Brogdon had played through the plantar fasciitis pain for weeks before the tear and, overall, had a career season in 2018-19 with averages of 15.6 points, 4.5 rebounds and 3.2 assists per game in 64 games. While Brogdon has been out, the Bucks have turned to a variety of guards to fill his role, including Sterling Brown, George Hill and Pat Connaughton. Collectively, that trio is averaging 8.9 ppg, 5.1 rpg and 3 apg in the playoffs while also providing a variety of different skills that helped Milwaukee sweep the Detroit Pistons in the first round . \u201cThat\u2019s our job,\u201d Connaughton said, per the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel . \u201cFor us as guys that are coming off the bench, it\u2019s about having that spark, having that energy, impacting the game in wherever it needs to be. I think that\u2019s something we\u2019ve done a great job of throughout the entire season. \u201cWe have a little bit of a deeper rotation than people really, I think, give us credit for.

No one\u2019s surprised this is the series headed to seven games. The Nuggets, for all their regular-season success, are making their inaugural playoff run with this core \u2014 an NBA recipe for early exits and anguish. The Spurs, well \u2026 they\u2019re the Spurs. Sure DeMar DeRozan is new, but the rest of the roster is a blend of experienced vets and up-and-comers steeped in San Antonio culture. Pop. RC. Y\u2019all know the drill. We had a Derrick White game, the only surprise was the identity of the Spurs\u2019 postseason breakout star in that previous clause. And then, Thursday. Backs against the wall, in front of the home fans, the Spurs raced out to a 34-26 lead after one behind 13 points on 6-of-9 shooting by LaMarcus Aldridge. They only briefly turned over the lead before halftime, and it was a gradual wrap from there. Rudy Gay ripped off 12 in the second quarter (4-for-5 shooting) and DeRozan 12 in the third quarter (6-for-7 shooting). \u201cDo or die, literally,\u201d DeRozan said. \u201cWe was on our home court, it was on me and LA to come out aggressive, and we did.\u201d While Nikola Jokic came through in every possible way, posting a franchise postseason-best 43 points (19-for-30), 12 rebounds and nine assists, the Nuggets left the offense at home. While the Spurs were hitting at a 57.1 percent clip, Denver shot a pedestrian 45.8 percent from the field, including a crushing 6-for-24 from 3-point range. A tough performance, especially considering Jokic was putting everybody in the post blender: defenders, bystanders \u2026 himself. \u201cWe didn\u2019t defend,\u201d said Nuggets coach Michael Malone. \u201cJust wasn\u2019t good enough tonight \u2026 The good thing for us is we worked hard to have homecourt advantage to go home and play a Game 7, and we had the best home record in the NBA this year.\u201d Paul Millsap, succinctly, and fairly firm: \u201cWe\u2019ll take care of business.\u201d A moment of controversy came early in the third quarter when Spurs center Jakob Poeltl set a hard screen for White, one that left Murray crumpled in a heap. The Nuggets guard crawled his way into a limping jog, finally getting up on his own power and massaging his knee. Murray stayed in the game, but was ineffective thereafter, contributing only five points (2\/8 FGs) and four assists after halftime. He didn\u2019t meet with media postgame, though coach Malone did acknowledge that he and the Nuggets staff have been in contact with the league regarding the perceived legality of San Antonio screens. \u201cJamal got taken out on that play, I don\u2019t know if it was dirty or not,\u201d Malone said. \u201cI don\u2019t think Jakob Poeltl is a dirty player \u2014 I really don\u2019t. I\u2019ll have to watch the film to see how that happened and how Jamal went down with that injury. But they\u2019re a physical team and they set good screens and we have to learn from that.\u201d Poeltl told reporters, \u201cI think I am setting legal screens. If I\u2019m not, somebody is going to let me know about it. I\u2019m not really worried about it.\u201d One more game to see whether the Nuggets can adjust \u2014 the first Game 7 in Denver since 1978 \u2014 and they\u2019ll likely need Murray at something close to full strength if the Spurs shoot anything close to their Thursday mark. Either way, San Antonio says they\u2019re ready. \u201cThat\u2019s what it\u2019s all about,\u201d DeRozan said. \u201cGame 7, live for the moment. Got to lay it all out on the line.\u201d Sad news arrived midway through the game, when the Boston Celtics announced the passing of NBA legend John Havlicek . The Hall of Famer died Thursday at age 79, having dealt with Parkinson\u2019s disease in recent years. Havlicek set Celtics career records for points and games , earning recognition as one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA history . He won eight championships, snagged a Finals MVP and the Celtics retired his No. 17. Here\u2019s to one of the all-time greats. While the LA Clippers were busy extending their series against the Warriors, the Rockets were busy \u2026 preparing for a series against the Warriors . Yikes. Per ESPN\u2019s Tim MacMahon: The goal is to get adjusted early to Pacific time, given that series is set to open in San Francisco if the Warriors win either Game 6 or 7. And if a Clippers shocker means heading back to Houston, well, they\u2019ll at least have advance notice."},{"id":46591,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/jazz-offensive-punch-offseason-ap","date":"2019-04-26","title":"Jazz will focus on adding offensive punch in offseason","content":" SALT LAKE CITY \u2014 Few teams could match the Utah Jazz in their ability to dominate on defense this season. An inability to generate consistent offense, however, ultimately doomed Utah in the postseason. After getting knocked out of the first-round of the postseason by the Houston Rockets, change is in the air for the Jazz as the team heads into the offseason. Utah plans to target shooters and playmakers in free agency who can take some of the defensive focus away from leading scorer Donovan Mitchell. \u201cWe want to move the group forward,\u201d Jazz GM Dennis Lindsey said at the team\u2019s practice facility Thursday. \u201cWhile we have a very good team, the results told us that we don\u2019t have a great team.\u201d Utah does have a solid foundation in place thanks to continued progress from Mitchell and center Rudy Gobert. The duo helped lead the Jazz to a 50-win season and a third straight playoff berth. Mitchell overcame a sluggish start to his sophomore season and showed his stellar rookie campaign was no fluke. After January 1st, Mitchell averaged 26.5 points, 4.5 rebounds, and 4.8 assists to lead the Jazz. His season average of 23.8 points led all second-year NBA players. He is the first second-year NBA guard to average more than 23 points since Dwyane Wade in 2004-05. Mitchell impressed teammates with his relentless work ethic throughout the season. He showed up at the team\u2019s practice facility at all hours, trying to work on every possible facet of his game. Even after all he\u2019s accomplished, Mitchell is driven to prove he belongs \u201cI wasn\u2019t expected to be here and I really don\u2019t want to lose this,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cAs a kid, my favorite subject was recess. Why? Because I could go play basketball. As a 22-year old kid now, to have that all come full circle, it\u2019s a blessing.\u201d Gobert is driven to push himself, too. The reigning NBA Defensive Player of the Year showed a stronger offensive dimension in his game this season. Gobert led the league in field goal percentage (.669), dunks (306), and screen assists per game (5.9). He posted per game career highs in points (15.9), rebounds (12.9), and assists (2.0) in 2018-19. Along the way, Gobert became only the second NBA player to total more than 1,200 points and 1,000 rebounds while shooting over 65 percent from the field in a single season, joining Wilt Chamberlain, who did it in 1966-67. Like Mitchell, Gobert is hungry to prove he can do more. \u201cI haven\u2019t scratched the surface of what I can become offensively,\u201d Gobert said. \u201cI want to take it to the next level. I\u2019ve been putting too much limits on myself and what I can do for this team. Now, I have a little bit more time to work and come back as a better player.\u201d Here\u2019s a few other things to watch with the Jazz in the offseason: POINT GUARD CHANGES? Finding a new starting point guard may top the summer agenda for the Jazz. Ricky Rubio is an unrestricted free agent after spending the last two seasons in Utah. Rubio has been an effective scorer at times during his stint with the Jazz. Over the past two years, he had 26 20-point games \u2013 five more than his previous six seasons in Minnesota combined. On the other hand, Rubio also struggled with inconsistent shooting. Lindsey said he can envision multiple scenarios that include a return to Utah for Rubio. The veteran guard wants to take his time and see which coach and team will offer the best fit for him. \u201cI want to be happy,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cSo I\u2019m going to try to find the best situation for me to perform and to be happy.\u201d FAVORS RISING Derrick Favors has one more year remaining on a two-year deal he signed last summer to remain in Utah. The second year is a team option that needs to be picked up by July 6th to become fully guaranteed for 2019-20. Odds are good Favors will return for his ninth full season with the Jazz. He adjusted to a new role, splitting time as the starting power forward and backup center to Gobert. Favors flourished as the season progressed. 12 of his 15 double-doubles came after January 1st and Favors finished the season with a career-best effective field goal percentage (60.0). His play received a boost after he slimmed down from 274 pounds to 248 pounds before the season. \u201cIt\u2019s something I\u2019ll be focusing on again in the offseason,\u201d Favors said. \u201cI\u2019ll be slimming down even more. Getting quicker so I\u2019ll be able to guard on the perimeter and be able to guard in the pick and roll.\u201d KORVER RETIREMENT? Veteran guard Kyle Korver helped energize a sagging Jazz offense in his second stint with the team. Utah went 25-4 in games in which he hit two or more 3-point field goals and posted a 36-18 (.667) record after acquiring Korver in a November trade The Jazz have a team option to pick up Korver\u2019s contract for the 2019-20 season. It becomes partially guaranteed after July 7. At age 38, Korver is uncertain whether or not he will return for a 17th season. \u2032 \u201cThere\u2019s a real cost as you get older,\u201d Korver said. \u201cThere\u2019s all of what you need to put into the game, but there\u2019s also a family cost. That\u2019s probably where I\u2019m at, is weighing that cost.\u201d 3-POINT FLURRY Utah\u2019s inability to make open shots in the postseason put a damper on an otherwise solid effort from the perimeter during the season. The Jazz set a franchise record by making 10-or-more 3-pointers in 65 games this season. Their bench provided a big push in achieving that mark. Utah\u2019s second unit knocked down 5.7 3s per contest. That was the second most of any NBA team and the highest rate in franchise history. DOMINANT DEFENSE For the third straight season, Utah earned a top-five defensive rating among NBA teams. The Jazz finished with a 105.2 defensive rating, which ranked second in the league. After Jan. 1, Utah sported a league-best 105.4 defensive rating. The Jazz also posted a plus 7.7 net rating during that same stretch. Gobert keyed much of that defensive success with his ability to lock down around the rim. He contested 16.0 shots per game, the second-highest rate among NBA players."},{"id":34110,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/doc-rivers-hand-control-find-success","date":"2019-04-26","title":"'Relieved' Rivers handed off control to find success with Clippers","content":" * Tonight on ESPN:  Game 6, Warriors vs. Clippers (10 ET) LOS ANGELES \u2013The expiration date for the lowest-seeded team in the Western Conference playoffs keeps getting delayed, and this is buying more time for the Clippers to pull a major surprise or at least gain more respect for what they\u2019re doing in the first round best-of-seven. It\u2019s now late April and they\u2019ve won twice against the two-time defending champion Warriors without the benefit of single All-Star, and this is due to a group of hustling players and also a coach enhancing a reputation for pushing the proper buttons. Yes, Doc Rivers is pulling his weight once again, but the hidden reason for this surprising run by the Clippers goes back two years ago, when his load was in the process of being reduced. A major organizational shift happened in the fall of 2017 when Rivers surrendered the top job in the basketball operations department, which he\u2019d held in addition to coaching. It was done at the insistence of owner Steve Ballmer, who thought Rivers should concentrate on what he does best, and it was endorsed by Rivers, who Thursday described how he felt about being stripped with one word: \u201cRelieved.\u201d But two months prior, with the personnel job still under his command, there was one final major decision to make, and the ripple effect is still evident, and positively so, two years later. Chris Paul, the Clippers\u2019 All-Star guard and unquestioned leader, was shipped to the Rockets. Lou Williams, Montrezl Harrell and Pat Beverley arrived in return. The Clippers lost the best player in that deal and somehow became better for it, in almost every way. The Clippers would likely be finished in this series without those three. Williams, Harrell and Beverley have had impactful moments against the Warriors and at times even outplayed the All-Stars on the other bench. The evidence is too compelling. * Williams:  Game 5 with 33 points and 10 assists . If the Clippers force a Game 7 and he does it again on the road, he\u2019ll literally close down Oracle Arena. * Harrell: He\u2019s been downright beastly around the rim, pounding the Warriors with vicious dunks produced from put-backs and lobs. He provides defensive intimidation as well with timely blocks, too. * Beverley: The barking and pestering from Beverley are generating all the noise about him, and rightly so, yet this tends to overlook the other areas where Beverley is causing problems. His 3-point shooting is surprising the Warriors when they disrespectfully leave him open, and he\u2019s active on the glass, getting nearly seven a game despite being 6-foot-1. Paul wanted out of L.A. and expressed a desire for Houston, giving the Clippers only one team to negotiate with. Those situations rarely work to the trading team\u2019s advantage \u2026 and yet it did for the Clippers. \u201cWhat we got out of it,\u201d said Rivers, \u201chas turned out to be terrific.\u201d While Rivers was officially in charge at the time in terms of having final say, the deal was mainly assembled by Lawrence Frank, now the basketball operations chief. (Rivers hired Frank and was given sway in personnel matters.) Paul was one-third of \u201cLob City\u201d and arguably the most important piece of that entertaining and productive system. Yet the Clippers never went beyond the West semifinals and there was a sense they\u2019d gone as far as possible with Paul, DeAndre Jordan and Blake Griffin. Plus, Paul wanted a max contract extension, and when the Clippers hedged against a point guard in his 30s who couldn\u2019t stay healthy, the separation became mutual. \u201cWe clearly needed the trade,\u201d said Rivers. \u201cWe were kind of stuck in our identity and we weren\u2019t going anywhere.\u201d The Rockets were anxious to add an important piece next to James Harden. When Paul exercised the remaining year on option on his contract, with the understanding the Rockets would give him the max, the deal was set. The Clippers knew what they gave up \u2014 a lot. But what did they get in return? \u201cPat was definitely one we asked for,\u201d said Rivers, \u201cand to be honest, we asked for even more. You wouldn\u2019t believe what else we asked for. But the package we were getting at the time was a good package. We didn\u2019t know it was going to be that good.\u201d Beverley was the Rockets\u2019 starting point guard next to Harden, which means he wasn\u2019t really a point guard at all, since Harden controlled the ball. Williams was a proven scorer off the bench, yet the Clippers would become his sixth team. And Harrell was seen as a worker bee. \u201cWe knew Lou would give us scoring. That\u2019s the one thing for sure we knew we had in terms of production,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cWe knew what we were getting with Pat as far as his toughness. Trez was the unknown. We liked that he played hard and it literally stopped there.\u201d Williams is a heavy favorite to repeat for his third career Kia Sixth Man of the Year award. After the Clippers traded leading scorer Tobias Harris in February, Williams became the savior by attrition \u2014 a role he\u2019s taken to with much pride. Williams, say his teammates, get rankled when the Clippers are accused of lacking a go-to player. This hasn\u2019t been the case in fourth quarters of the two playoff games the Clippers took from the Warriors. \u201cLou is one of the best players in this game,\u201d Beverley said. \u201cHe belongs right up there with the best.\u201d Beverley, the Clippers\u2019 emotional leader, will never be a volume scorer. But his offseason work on 3-pointers is showing, as he shot 39.7 percent on 3-pointers in 2018-19 and is making 42.9 percent of them in this series. I said, `I swear I think he can score.\u2019 And one of our coaches hilariously said, `Yeah, on us. But we don\u2019t know if he can score on an NBA team.\u2019 \u201c Doc Rivers on Montrezl Harrell The shocker was Harrell. He was a clean-up man in Houston, a role that didn\u2019t change much in his first season with the Clippers. So what happened and when did this \u2014 getting his number called, becoming a primary option, showing enough confidence to average 16.6 points \u2014 happen exactly? \u201cIn training camp,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cIn our coaches meeting on the third day, I asked, `Is it me, or can Trez score?\u2019 And our guys rolled their eyes, because at that point Trez never scored. And I said, `I swear I think he can score.\u2019 And one of our coaches hilariously said, `Yeah, on us. But we don\u2019t know if he can score on an NBA team.\u2019 I said, `Well that\u2019s a hell of a statement.\u2019 \u201cThen through preseason he kept scoring. The post-up game, we saw at the end of last year, and coming into this year it was catches. We could throw it to him. His first step is lethal and he does it with great power.\u201d As a side bonus, the Clippers also received a 2018 first-rounder from the Rockets, which they used in a three-team deal to get Danilo Gallinari. So that\u2019s four rotational players for Chris Paul. \u201cLawrence had already been hired by me the year before so it was probably the last trade Lawrence and I made together before we brought in others to the group,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cWe do everything together as a group. But Lawrence basically did this whole trade. He called me and gave me all the names and my thought was we had to get something. I told Lawrence this is a really good package because it can help us now and potentially help us later.\u201d The end result was the Clippers didn\u2019t pay a point guard in his twilight (Paul will still be owed two years and $80 million after he turns 35) and had an excuse to eventually dump Jordan and Griffin as well. The \u201crebuilding\u201d of the Clippers wasn\u2019t painful or lengthy, and today they\u2019re making life complicated and miserable for the Warriors. Even better, the Clippers are positioned to add one or two A-list free agents this summer. That\u2019s because they refused to stick with \u201cLob City\u201d, a core that had run its course, and also because they wisely gave team-friendly extensions to Williams and Harrell before this season. Everyone is relieved, and no one more than Rivers, who has less on his plate and doesn\u2019t feel hunger pains. \u201cI wanted to do both jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this is right. I needed this. It has worked out.\u201d * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years. You can e-mail him  here  .

He was 79. The Celtics said Havlicek died Thursday in Jupiter, Florida. The cause of death wasn\u2019t immediately available, but The Boston Globe said he had Parkinson\u2019s disease. Gravel-voiced Johnny Most\u2019s radio call of the 1965 steal \u2014 \u201cHavlicek stole the ball! Havlicek stole the ball!\u201d \u2014 helped make the play one of the most enduring moments in NBA history. \u201cJohn Havlicek is one of the most accomplished players in Boston Celtics history, and the face of many of the franchise\u2019s signature moments,\u201d the Celtics said in a statement. \u201cHe was a champion in every sense, and as we join his family, friends, and fans in mourning his loss, we are thankful for all the joy and inspiration he brought to us.\u201d Havlicek posted impressive numbers during his illustrious 16-year career. In 1,270 regular-season games, he scored 26,395 points and averaged 20.8 points to rank as the Celtics\u2019 all-time leading scorer. He also grabbed 8,007 rebounds, recorded 6,114 assists, and played on eight Boston championship teams. He appeared in 13 consecutive NBA All-Star Games, earned 11 selections to the All-NBA First or Second Team and was named to the NBA All-Defensive First or Second Team eight times. Nicknamed \u201cHondo\u201d for his resemblance to John Wayne, Havlicek was drafted in the first round in 1962 out of Ohio State by a Celtics team stocked with stars Bill Russell, Bob Cousy, K.C. Jones, Sam Jones, Tom Sanders, Tom Heinsohn and Frank Ramsey. Boston won NBA championships in his first six years with the team. Then, as the veteran players gradually moved on, Havlicek became the team\u2019s elder statesman and moved up to become a starter. The team won championships in 1973-74 and 1975-76 with Havlicek leading teams that included Dave Cowens and Jo Jo White. Havlicek went on to win eight NBA championships and an NBA Finals MVP award, setting Celtics career records for points and games. He was named one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History and enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1984. At Ohio State, he helped lead the Buckeyes to the 1960 national championship. Via Twitter, Russell posted the following about Havlicek: It is getting difficult each time I hear about another contemporary that passes! What is harder is when we lose guys like John Havlicek, he was not just a teammate & a great guy, but he was family. That is how our @celtics teams were. #RIP Hondo @NBA #RIPJohnHavlicek @NBAonTNT\u201d As much as his deadly jump shot or his heroics in Boston\u2019s triple-overtime NBA finals victory over Phoenix in 1976, Havlicek was known for his durability. He played at least 81 games in each of his 15 seasons with the Celtics and he didn\u2019t just play: He was on the run constantly and was perpetually in motion. In his NBA career he scored 26,395 points in 1,270 games. He seldom rested. \u201cThe Boston Celtics are not a team, they are a way of life,\u201d Red Auerbach once said. And no one personified the Celtic way more than Havlicek. His No.17 was raised to the rafters in old Boston Garden and now resides in TD Garden, retired soon after he retired in 1978. The child of Czechoslovakian immigrants, Havlicek was born in the small town of Martins Ferry, Ohio, home to coal miners and steel workers. As a boy he loved to run, sprinting to and from school or from one mile marker to another on a local highway. He once said that he was forced to keep up with his bike-riding pals on foot because his parents refused to let him have a bicycle.  At Bridgeport High School, Havlicek starred in basketball, baseball and football. An All-State selection in all three sports, he was a highly recruited quarterback who could throw the ball 80 yards. He chose Ohio State but did not play football. Although he did play baseball and batted over .400 in his freshman year, he focused on basketball. A collegiate All-American, Havlicek scored 14.6 points in three seasons, playing on Buckeyes teams with Jerry Lucas, Bobby Knight and future Celtics teammate Larry Siegfried. Havlicek\u2019s Ohio State teams compiled a 78-6 record and won an NCAA championship in 1960. After his senior season, Havlicek was drafted into two professional sports leagues. The NFL\u2019s Cleveland Browns selected him in the seventh round of the 1962 NFL Draft, and the NBA\u2019s Boston Celtics nabbed him in the first round of the NBA Draft. The Browns, impressed with Havlicek\u2019s athletic ability and his 6-foot-5, 205-pound frame, tried him at wide receiver. He played in several exhibition games that summer before being released by the team in favor of future All-Pro Gary Collins. As a sophomore at Ohio State, he scored 12.2 points a game as the Buckeyes won the national championship, beating California 75-55 in the final. His junior and senior years, Ohio State again won the Big Ten titles and made it to the NCAA title game but lost to Cincinnati each time. During Havlicek\u2019s three years at Ohio State, the Buckeyes went 78-6, dominating most games unlike any team up to that time. All five starters from Ohio State\u2019s title team in 1960 \u2014 which included Lucas and Siegfried \u2014 played in the NBA. Backup Bob Knight went to a Hall of Fame coaching career. Havlicek remained in Boston after his retirement, managing investments. He later split time between New England and Florida. He occasionally returned to Ohio State for reunions of the championship team and Celtics events. His Ohio State number was retired during ceremonies in the 2004-2005 season.

He was a great champion both on the court and in the community, winning 8 NBA championships and an NBA Finals MVP, while holding Celtics career records for points scored and games played. Named one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History, he is enshrined in the Basketball Hall of Fame and his retired #17 hangs in the Garden rafters. His defining traits as a player were his relentless hustle and wholehearted commitment to team over self. He was extraordinarily thoughtful and generous, both on a personal level and for those in need, as illustrated by his commitment to raising money for The Genesis Foundation for Children for over three decades through his fishing tournament. John was kind and considerate, humble and gracious. He was a champion in every sense, and as we join his family, friends, and fans in mourning his loss, we are thankful for all the joy and inspiration he brought to us. John Havlicek was a wonderful friend who represented the best of the NBA.

A trusted teammate who prioritized winning, John\u2019s passion and energy endeared him to basketball fans and made him a model for generations of NBA players. We send our deepest sympathies to John\u2019s wife, Beth, his son, Chris, and his daughter, Jill, as well as the entire Celtics organization."},{"id":34103,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/thunder-exit-interviews-donovan-westbrook-george","date":"2019-04-25","title":"OKC's stars, coach Donovan expect improvement after playoff ouster","content":"The Oklahoma City Thunder face an offseason full of questions after their first-round series loss to the Portland Trail Blazers. On Thursday, coach Billy Donovan and All-Stars Paul George and Russell Westbrook attempted to look ahead as a critical offseason looms. The Thunder picked up Donovan\u2019s option for 2019-20 in December, thus keeping him under contract for now. However, based on what he said Thursday, Donovan plans to talk further with team officials this summer about his long-term future there. \u201cFor me it\u2019s just kind of like business as usual,\u201d Donovan said, per Barry Trammel of The Oklahoman . \u201c[Thunder GM] Sam (Presti) and I had a chance to visit a little bit on the plane yesterday on the way back, just talking about the next couple days and getting together. So I\u2019m sure he and I will get a chance to sit down as some of this stuff slows down and talk in detail and look forward to that, but for me it\u2019s just, OK, handling our players today and the team today and giving them some things to think about going into the off-season, most importantly where we can get better and where we can improve.\u201d Individually, Westbrook was solid from a pure statistics standpoint in the series against Portland. He averaged 22.8 points, nine rebounds and 10.6 assists per game in the series and had a triple-double ( 29 points, 12 rebounds, 14 assists ) in the Game 5 ouster. But those number don\u2019t tell the whole story, as Westbrook shot 36 percent overall and had a 46.6 true shooting percentage in the series \u2014 marked drops from his regular-season marks of 42.8 and 50.1 percent , respectively. The Thunder point guard shot 20.8 percent between three and 10 feet and 33.3 percent between 10 and 16 feet. When asked about what he can improve upon for next season, Westbrook did not shy away from the question. \u201cThere\u2019s room for improvement every year \u2026 I expect a lot out of myself,\u201d Westbrook said. \u201cWhen you lose a series, everybody looks at series and says this is why you lost \u2026 but ultimately there are different things through the season that happen to you or the team. It\u2019s a combination of things. I will do what I need to do to stay consistent and be better.\u201d He also said he is putting a lot of pressure on himself to improve for 2019-20. \u201cThere used to be conversations if I was a ball hog, but now I lead the league in assists for the past three years or whatever it is, that\u2019s getting squashed out,\u201d Westbrook said, per Erik Horne of The Oklahoman . \u201cSo now the conversation is about shooting. Next year I\u2019m going to become a better shooter. After that it\u2019ll be probably, (expletive), my left foot is bigger than my right one. Who knows. \u201cBut to me that\u2019s why I know when you do so much with the game, got so much impact on the game, I expect a lot out of myself, put a lot of pressure on myself to become a very, very great player because I know that I\u2019m able to do so much throughout a game to impact the game, impact winning. So that\u2019s why, back to your point, I don\u2019t really care what people say, what they think about me, because it doesn\u2019t really matter. I know what I\u2019m able to do and know what I\u2019m able to do at a high level every night, and nobody else can do what I can do on a night in, night out basis, and I truly believe that. If they could, I\u2019m pretty sure they would. But I know for a fact that nobody can.\u201d As for George, he was solid statistically as well (28.6 ppg, 8.6 rpg, 3.6 apg, 43.6 FG pct., 31.9 3pt FG pct), but could face surgery on his right shoulder in the offseason. His status for the series against Portland was initially up in the air before Game 1 , but he wound up playing the entire season. Still, he was slowed by the shoulder injury late in the regular season, missing games on Feb. 28, March 2 and March 3. He also had problems with his left shoulder down the stretch of the season, but they are unrelated. George declined to comment on the specifics of his injury on Thursday, but did say he was dealing with it long before he was forced to miss that time in late February and early March. His goal, per Maddie Lee of The Oklahoman , is to get his shoulder situation resolved to prevent it from becoming a recurring problem. \u201cI will address it soon,\u201d he said, per The Oklahoman, \u201ctry to get it fixed and get back out there come this next season. \u201cI\u2019m not sure of the exact timetable on it. Again, we\u2019re still trying to put a plan together on how to address it, and you know, what needs to be done.\u201d With their five-game series loss to the Blazers, the Thunder are 4-12 in their last three playoff runs. This season\u2019s exit comes after a surprising first-round loss to the Utah Jazz in 2018 and a five-game exit at the hands of the Houston Rockets in 2017 . The Thunder were aggressive in the offseason following each exit, adding former All-Star Carmelo Anthony and George to their group in the 2017 offseason and, last summer, picking up reserve guard Dennis Schroder and Nerlens Noel (among others) while also re-signing the free agent George. How much roster and salary cap flexibility the Thunder have this summer is much more limited. George is in the midst of his four-year contract, starting center Steven Adams has two more seasons on his deal. Westbrook signed a five-year, $205 million deal in 2017 as well. Noel and reserve Patrick Patterson both have player options this summer and veteran guard Raymond Felton will be an unrestricted free agent.

The teams are set to meet again this postseason, marking a rematch and the continuation of a rivalry between the team with the upper hand (Golden State) and the opponent (Houston) trying to oust their nemesis. Since 1984-85, there have been a lot of these rematch playoff series \u2014 and for the purposes of this exercise, we\u2019re excluding rematches in The Finals. Why? Because the Rockets are trying to reach The Finals for the first time since 1995. For a good number of teams, getting past that team keeping them from The Finals was a magical moment. In others, it was just good to vanquish a playoff demon. Other series were simply entertaining, even though they were over quickly. We went with \u201984-85 because it was Michael Jordan\u2019s rookie season, and he played a role in denying many a team and player a shot at their next goal. Here\u2019s a look at some great playoff rematches in NBA history since the 1985 playoffs. * * *  Why it gets a nod:  Boston won an East-high 57 games, but Detroit, which had pushed the Celtics to the limit in the East finals in 1987, won 54 games and the Central Division. General manager Jack McCloskey and coach Chuck Daly had surrounded 6-foot-1 star guard Isiah Thomas with rugged rebounders Bill Laimbeer and Rick Mahorn, scorers Adrian Dantley, Joe Dumars and Vinnie Johnson, and young, aggressive defensive forwards Dennis Rodman and John Salley. As for Boston, it boasted its core of Larry Bird, Kevin McHale, Robert Parish, Dennis Johnson and Danny Ainge as it sought a third straight NBA title. However, the Pistons bounced back from that \u201987 East finals loss with a vengeance. They won two of the first three games at the vaunted Boston Garden and closed out the Celtics in Game 6, reaching their first Finals in franchise history. The Pistons fell just short there, losing in Game 7 to the Los Angeles Lakers \u2014 but fittingly, reached The Finals again and swept the Lakers in the 1988 series. Why it gets a nod:  These teams didn\u2019t meet in a playoff series ever year from 1993 to 2000 \u2026 but it sure seemed that way. Overall, the teams met six times in that span, with the teams splitting those series (Indiana won in \u201995, \u201998 and 2000; New York won in \u201993, \u201994 and \u201999). Consider, too, that the winner of this series reached The Finals three times, including back-to-back matchups in the East finals (New York won in 1999; Indiana won in 2000). While the players on the periphery changed, the stars driving this series remained the same. For the Knicks, it was Patrick Ewing, John Starks, Charles Oakley, Derek Harper and Anthony Mason with Pat Riley (and later Jeff Van Gundy) on the sidelines. The Pacers countered with Reggie Miller, Mark Jackson, Rik Smits, Dale Davis and Derrick McKey\/Chris Mullin\/Jalen Rose with Larry Brown (and later Larry Bird) on the sidelines. The play in these series epitomized 1990s-era basketball and delivered countless playoff moments \u2014 Miller\u2019s eight points in 8.9 seconds, Ewing\u2019s jubilation in Game 7 of \u201994, Larry Johnson\u2019s four-point play \u2014 that still resonate with NBA fans today."},{"id":34109,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/top-merchandise-jersey-sales-2018-19-season-official-release","date":"2019-04-25","title":"LeBron, Lakers top NBA's most popular merchandise lists","content":" NEW YORK \u2013  The National Basketball Association (NBA) and National Basketball Players Association (NBPA) today jointly announced that LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers secured the top spots on the NBA\u2019s Most Popular Jersey and Team Merchandise lists.

The Kings and the league said Thursday they will be looking into the accusations contained in a lawsuit filed earlier in this week in Los Angeles by former sportscaster Kelli Tennant. The statement read as follows : Walton\u2019s attorney, Mark Baute, has called the allegations \u201cbaseless\u201d and says the coach will prove that in court. Tennant contends Walton attacked her when he was an assistant coach for the Golden State Warriors, which was from 2014 to 2016. Tennant said she confided in people at the time but never filed charges because she was scared. Her lawyer, Garo Mardirossian, said because years had passed, he believed it would be difficult now to file a police report and put together a criminal case. Tennant said Walton continued to harass her after he became coach of the Lakers and she was working as a broadcaster in Los Angeles for Spectrum SportsNet and SportsNet LA. She now does a wellness podcast. Tennant said she considered the 39-year-old Walton, the son of Hall of Famer Bill Walton, to be a longtime friend and mentor. The coach had written the foreword to a 2014 book she had written and she went to give him a copy while he was at a Santa Monica hotel during a Warriors road trip to Los Angeles. Tennant said Walton met her in the lobby and invited her to his room. After discussing the book, Tennant said Walton suddenly grabbed her, pinned her to the bed and forcibly kissed her. Tennant said that when she asked him to get off \u201che laughed at me.\u201d Tennant said Walton relented and she started to leave the room when he grabbed her again and kissed her ears and neck.

Lou Williams came off the bench for 33 points and led the Clippers past Golden State with a flurry of points in the final four minutes. The 129-121 victory on the Warriors\u2019 home court overshadowed a stellar game by Kevin Durant, who finished with a playoff career-high 45 points. But Wednesday night belonged to Williams, Montrezl Harrell, Danilo Gallinari and Patrick Beverley, who extended the first-round series to Game 6 on Friday. The Clippers led most of the game, but the Warriors made a run late in the fourth and took a 118-117 lead with 2:40 left on a drive and dunk by Durant, his final score. Williams then proceeded to reel off nine points, including this fadeaway jumper at 1:29 that put the Clippers up by seven, 125-118.

Harrell also contributed big time off the Clippers bench, dominating in the paint with dunk-after-dunk and finishing with 24 points. Here are a couple of examples: Beverley grabbed 14 rebounds, took a key charge late and finished with 17 points. \u201cHe came out with more energy and that set a tone,\u201d said Warriors coach Steve Kerr, noting that Beverley fought for three early offensive rebounds. Gallinari added 26 points and seven rebounds. Durant\u2019s shooting \u2014 he was 14-for-26 with five 3-pointers and 12-for-12 at the line \u2014 kept the Warriors within striking distance. This heavily contested 3-pointer, which resulted in a four-point play, shows his shooting prowess. Durant passed John Havlicek for No. 12 on the all-time playoffs scoring list, moving past Havlicek\u2019s 3,776 points late in the first quarter. Durant, who poured in 21 in the first half, passed Havlicek with his second 3-pointer with 2:37 left in the first quarter. His 45 for the game gives him 3,815, and Larry Bird is next on the list with 3,897. The Jazz didn\u2019t have the firepower to overcome the Rockets, falling 100-93 in Game 5 and losing the first-round series 4-1 . But they\u2019ve showcased a way to keep reigning Kia MVP James Harden somewhat in check \u2014 guard him from behind, taking away the step-back 3 and forcing him to drive and shoot floaters. Despite an 0-for-7 start from the field, Harden still finished with 26 points. But that\u2019s well off his league-leading regular-season average of 36.1 points. Harden made this floater in the fourth quarter, but this is how Ricky Rubio guarded him, sliding behind and allowing a lane to open. The Jazz forced him inside and tried to protect the rim without fouling, forcing the two-point shot instead of the 3-pointer from distance with the possibility of a foul and a four-point play. Harden also misfired a bit more than usual in his 10-for-26 shooting night as this failed dunk attempt shows: The strategy employed by the Jazz showed up in the limited number of times Harden went to the foul line: only five and hitting three. He averaged getting to the line 11 times per game in the regular season and scored 9.7 points from the line. And Harden wasn\u2019t a big factor from behind-the-arc, going 3-for-12. But the Jazz couldn\u2019t capitalize on the offensive end, missing many open 3-point looks. They were a woeful 9-of-38 from behind the arc, or 23.7 percent. Joe Ingles (11 points, nine assists) and Rubio (17 points, 11 assists) played well, keeping Utah in the game, but the Jazz couldn\u2019t break through down the stretch. Donovan Mitchell, who was only 4-for-22 and finished with 12 points, missed a 3-pointer in the final minute and Chris Paul sealed the win with two free throws. Mitchell misfired on all of his nine 3-point attempts. Andrew Bogut joined the Warriors near the end of the regular season after playing Down Under with the Sydney Kings. The big man has filled a valuable role with the leg injury to DeMarcus Cousins. In Australia, they\u2019re under the impression he would like to do it again next year. The Rockets had 12 steals and 12 blocks in Game 5 tonight. The last time they had double-digits in both categories was in Game 5 of the 1994 Western Conference finals \u2014 a series which, coincidentally, saw them play the Jazz. After clinching the series in that Game 5, the Rockets would reach The Finals and win their first NBA title."},{"id":34092,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blake-griffin-undergoes-arthroscopic-procedure-official-release","date":"2019-04-25","title":"Blake Griffin undergoes arthroscopic procedure","content":" DETROIT, Mich . \u2014 The Detroit Pistons announced Wednesday that forward Blake Griffin underwent a successful arthroscopic procedure on his left knee in Los Angeles, California.

It was that way in the 1960s and early \u201870s when he was known as \u201cMr. Clutch,\u201d and it is that way now, even at age 80. Jerry West cuts a figure you cannot easily forget, and not just because his silhouette inspired the NBA\u2019s logo. Sporting silver hair and a smile, West seems far from the brooding figure he was as a Hall of Fame combo guard for the Los Angeles Lakers \u2014 and later as a general manager (also most famously with the Lakers). He\u2019s pleasant and approachable before and after games. But when the ball goes up, West shows his trademark intensity while watching from courtside. Only West has had two legendary careers in the NBA. The highest honor any player could receive is to have their silhouette used as the league\u2019s logo. And more than a few GMs have remarked, regarding the annual Executive of the Year Award: They ought to name it after him. He has scaled back, to an extent and his official title with the LA Clippers is consultant. Yet his influence and fingerprints are all over a franchise about to embark on the most important summer since Steve Ballmer took over as owner six years ago. Ballmer\u2019s smartest decision was building a bond with Bill Gates. Doing so made him a billionaire 25 times over. Perhaps the next smartest move was hiring West, which may make Ballmer a champion. It all depends on what the Clippers \u2014 with West dropping knowledge in the back room \u2014 do with their money, assets, Draft picks and salary cap space this summer. And what does West say? \u201cWe know we can be a player.\u201d  But first, he will address the elephant in the room. Sort of, anyway. Because you\u2019ve asked, he hasn\u2019t heard from the Lakers about any possible return there after Magic Johnson\u2019s hasty resignation as team president . Yes, he obviously knows Jeanie Buss. Yes, there was an uncomfortable departure more than a decade ago because West lost a bitter power struggle with then-coach Phil Jackson (who also had a relationship with Jeanie Buss). Yes, she chose Magic, who had no experience, to run the Lakers instead of West. No, West insists he holds no resentment or grudges \u2014 the Lakers, after all, still employ one of his sons, Ryan. And no, he would not glance at the caller ID and just let the phone ring if Jeanie Buss did call. Yet, West isn\u2019t exactly waiting by the phone, either. \u201cI don\u2019t work there and I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on over there,\u201d West said. He seems all-in with the Clippers, if only because they hired him quickly once his advisory role with the Warriors ended more than a year ago. West was somewhat surprised by the interest, yet it demonstrated how much respect there is for his opinions about personnel. Aside from his stellar front office work with the Lakers (which resulted in eight NBA titles), it was West who helped build the Memphis Grizzlies (after they relocated from Vancouver) and advised the Warriors not to trade Klay Thompson for Kevin Love . It was West who, fresh on the job, pushed the Clippers to trade Blake Griffin last season , which opened cap space. Naturally, West downplays his role. He says the Clippers are set in the front office with basketball ops president Lawrence Frank calling the shots (with help from Michael Winger and Trent Redden) and Doc Rivers as coach. He saves his biggest applause for Ballmer, though, and said the NBA\u2019s wealthiest owner will have the biggest sway this summer when the Clippers chase a superstar. \u201cI think everyone talks about his money when they speak about him,\u201d West said. \u201cI found him one of the most unique people I\u2019ve been around. He\u2019s a people person, a man of the people. It\u2019s a breath of fresh air to be around him. I\u2019ve been fortunate enough to be involved with some outstanding people and leaders who were really good, but this guy\u2019s at the top of the list. \u201cHe embraces the people and wants to learn and is great with our front office, with Lawrence and our coaches. I don\u2019t see any flaws with him as an owner. I wish all owners could be like him.\u201d West says Ballmer has created a culture that impacts every corner of the franchise. These aren\u2019t your father\u2019s Clippers, nor the one that employed West\u2019s close friend and former teammate, Elgin Baylor. \u201cWe have competitive people in our front office,\u201d West said. \u201cAnd Steve is as competitive as it comes. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m hopeful we can show (free agents) to look at what\u2019s been accomplished in a short time with him as an owner and a lot of the basketball people we have involved, along with Doc\u2019s resume, Lawrence\u2019s resume and how people are treated here.\u201d West gushes with praise over the job Rivers has done, too. He got 48 wins from a team that lacked an All-Star and shifted gears mid-season by trading top scorer Tobias Harris to the Philadelphia 76ers . \u201cDoc\u2019s been phenomenal,\u201d West said. \u201cHe\u2019s got a bunch of guys believing in themselves in order to win as many games as we did. I always try to predict before the season in my own mind how many games we can win, and I was off by some. Usually I\u2019m not off by very many. It has been amazing, really fun. \u201cWhen you see people competing and playing hard and believing in practice, it has an enormous amount of what happens during the games. I\u2019m thrilled for Doc. A season like this has to be very rewarding.\u201d The Clippers find themselves in an interesting position, as they could sign two free agents to near-max contracts. Already, they have a solid core in Lou Williams, Montrezl Harrell, Danilo Gallinari, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Landry Shamet and Pat Beverley (should he re-sign). Plus, of course, there are the charms of living and working in Los Angeles. Is this enough to get a Kawhi Leonard and\/or Kevin Durant and\/or Jimmy Butler and\/or Kemba Walker? The Clippers may never be in this great of a position again. West, however, throws caution to the wind.  \u201cCap space is fool\u2019s gold,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to spend it wisely or not spend it. One of the two. \u201cAgain, it starts with ownership. A lot of people talk about free agency. You have to have a compelling reason for somebody to come to you. With the enormous amount of money that players have today obviously that\u2019s good, but the top free agents want more. We\u2019re obviously in the position to do something but we have to make a compelling case for people. It\u2019s nice to be one of the teams in that position, but we have to make a case going forward.\u201d The Clippers are sitting on a potential gold mine \u2026 if they manage it correctly. The Harris trade fetched the Miami Heat\u2019s unprotected No. 1 pick in 2021. That pick is projected to be very attractive because of the Heat\u2019s salary-cap situation and unknown desire to rebuild quickly. They also have the Sixers\u2019 2020 first-round pick (which is protected). Could those picks plus some Clippers players be used in potential trades (for maybe Anthony Davis)? \u201cWe have a lot of assets to work with, Draft picks that are very attractive,\u201d West said. In short, West is thrilled to part of a situation that could be franchise-changing. \u201cThis has been like a shot of adrenalin in my arm, to be involved with the people I\u2019m involved with,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery time I go over to the office, people are happy. Everyone is not there because they have a job. Everyone is here because they love it. Everyone kids each other and if you don\u2019t like to be kidded, don\u2019t come. It\u2019s fun. Everyone is having fun.\u201d While West could be salty or troll the Lakers and their perceived disorganization and dysfunction, he expresses the exact opposite sentiment for them. \u201cIt would be great if the Lakers were great and the Clippers were great,\u201d he said. \u201cWith the people they have over there, they\u2019re going to get a lot better. You see and hear a lot of negative things. People expect the Lakers to be up here because they have LeBron James. \u201cThere\u2019s so much more to this game and building a team. It\u2019s all about finding the people who compliment him best. Those young kids were probably looking at him in awe through the season and you certainly had no control over the injuries. With LeBron in the mix, anything\u2019s capable of happening. If they do something this summer, obviously it\u2019s going to be even better for them.\u201d But West also wants to make something very clear: \u201cWe want a better summer.\u201d * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

Taking matters into his own hands, Lillard scored a career playoff-high 50 points, including a 37-footer at the buzzer to eliminate the Oklahoma City Thunder from the playoffs in five games with a 118-115 victory . Amazingly, this wasn\u2019t the first time Lillard called series. He did the same thing to the Houston Rockets in 2014. Lillard was having a game for the ages even before the shot heard around the NBA. He played all 24 minutes of the first half, single-handedly keeping the Blazers close by scoring 34 points \u2014 the most by any player in one half in the postseason since Steve Nash in 2005. It was a signature performance for Lillard, capped by a buzzer-beater that will go down in history. Let\u2019s give it the Horry Scale treatment, shall we? A reminder on The Horry Scale: It breaks down a game-winning buzzer-beater (GWBB) in the categories of difficulty, game situation (was the team tied or behind at the time?), importance (playoff game or garden-variety night in November?) and celebration. Then we give it an overall grade on a scale of 1-5 Robert Horrys, named for the patron saint of last-second answered prayers. * * * DIFFICULTY: Lillard is no stranger to hitting big shots, but this was a 37-footer to clinch a playoff series. When it\u2019s Dame Time, Lillard has a way of making the most difficult shots look easy. GAME SITUATION: The Blazers erased a 15-point deficit in the fourth quarter and pulled even, 113-113, on CJ McCollum\u2019s 22-footer with 57 seconds left in regulation. Paul George and Lillard then exchanged buckets before Russell Westbrook missed a driving layup, which was corralled by Al-Farouq Aminu with 17.1 seconds left. Lillard took the handoff and calmly dribbled just inside of halfcourt near the Blazers logo, stared down Paul George, and then pulled up and hit the game-winner. CELEBRATION: The 3-pointer gave Lillard 50 points for the game and he waved good-bye to the Thunder bench amid a thunderous roar from the hometown crowd. He was promptly mobbed by his teammates as confetti rained down. As the Thunder left the floor, Lillard circled the court, high-fiving fans while the crowd chanted \u201cMVP! MVP!\u201d GRADE: It doesn\u2019t get any better than this. Five Horrys.  To say the Toronto Raptors and Philadelphia 76ers took care of business Tuesday night would be an understatement. Both teams started fast and crusied to series-clinching wins in their respective Game 5s, advancing to face each other in the Eastern Conference semifinals. Kyle Lowry set the tone for the Raptors, scoring Toronto\u2019s first nine points. Meanwhile, the Orlando Magic missed 10 of their first 11 shots and went 0 for 7 from 3-point range in the first. The Raptors jumped out to a 24-7 lead and never looked back in their 115-96 victory . Kawhi Leonard had another ruthlessly efficient game, scoring 27 points on 8-for-11 shooting, including 5 of 5 from 3-point range. He checked out to cheers of \u201cMVP, MVP\u201d with 8:05 to play and Toronto up by 30. The Sixers faced even less resistance from the Brooklyn Nets, who looked overmatched since winning the series opener. Joel Embiid again shook off a bad left knee and had six points and five rebounds in the first two minutes. The Sixers scored the first 14 points of the game, and led 30-6 with two minutes left in the first quarter. \u201cThey did whatever they wanted before we could even get on the board,\u201d Nets All-Star guard D\u2019Angelo Russell said. Embiid finished with 23 points and 13 rebounds in just 20 minutes, and no starter played more than 27 minutes in the 122-100 romp . If there\u2019s one play that summed up this game, it\u2019s Embiid\u2019s baseline jam over Rondae Hollis-Jefferson. So we finally get another Sixers-Raptors series. It\u2019s been 18 years since Philadelphia and Tornoto met in the playoffs, when Allen Iverson\u2019s 76ers defeated the Vince Carter-led Raptors in seven games. The Denver Nuggets are on the verge of their first playoff series victory since 2009 after dismantling the San Antonio Spurs 108-90 in pivotal Game 5. Once again the story was the Nikola Jokic, who finished with 16 points, 11 rebounds and eight assists before sitting out most of the fourth quarter. For the series, Jokic is averaging 19.6 points, 11.6 rebounds and 9.0 assists. \u201cWhat Nikola Jokic is doing in his playoff debut has not happened very often in the history of this game,\u201d Nuggets coach Mike Malone said. \u201cHe can impact the game in so many ways \u2026 I hope this national TV audience is watching us and saying, \u2018Man, this kid is for real.'\u201d Quote of the night  \u201cThere\u2019s really nothing he can\u2019t do \u2014 other than jump.\u201d  \u2014 Jamal Murray on Nikola Jokic Stat of the night  Kawhi Leonard has never lost a game to the Philadelphia 76ers.

Walton also wrote the forward to her book. She says she went to give him a copy while he stayed at the Casa Del Mar Hotel during a Warriors road trip to Los Angeles. Tennant said Walton met her in the lobby and invited her back to his room. After discussing the book, Tennant said Walton suddenly pinned her to the bed and forcibly kissed and groped her. She said Walton used his full body weight to keep her on the bed and laughed when she yelled \u201cstop!\u201d Tennant said Walton relented and she started to leave the room when he grabbed her again and kissed her ears and neck.

Phoenix fired Kokoskov \u2014 the first European-born coach in NBA history \u2014 early Tuesday morning, two weeks after he finished his first season as an NBA coach. The former Utah Jazz assistant and Slovenian national team coach guided a Suns team that finished with the worst record in the Western Conference (19-63). \u201cAfter extensive evaluation, I determined it is best to move in a different direction with our head coaching position,\u201d Suns president of basketball operations James Jones said in team statement . \u201cI want to thank Igor for his work this past season and wish him the best with his future endeavors.\u201d ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski reports that the Suns are hoping to hire Monty Williams to replace Kokoskov. Williams coached the New Orleans Pelicans from 2010-15, going 173-221 while making the playoffs twice (2011, \u201915), where he amassed a 2-8 career postseason record. Williams is reportedly also a top candidate for the Los Angeles Lakers, who parted ways with Luke Walton shortly after the regular season concluded. Despite having high-scoring guard Devin Booker and No. 1 overall pick Deandre Ayton at his disposal, Kokoskov was also left with Isaiah Canaan, De\u2019Anthony Melton and Elie Okobo as his best options at starting point guard before the team acquired Tyler Johnson in February. In-season injuries to TJ Warren and Kelly Oubre further depleted the rebuilding Suns. Instead of a revitalizing season, the Suns continued to mire in mediocrity, missing the playoffs for the ninth straight season. Phoenix had a franchise-worst 17-game losing streak in 2018-19 and became the first team in the shot-clock era (1954-55) to be held under 10 points in the first quarter of consecutive games. Jones became the full-time GM after the Suns removed the interim tag earlier this month and his first big move was to fire Kokoskov, an assistant with the franchise from 2008-13. Now, Phoenix is in limbo again, searching for its fifth coach in five seasons. The Serbian Kokoskov spent 18 seasons as an NBA assistant before becoming a coach, including stints with Utah, Orlando Cleveland, Detroit and the LA Clippers. He also was the head coach of the Georgia national team from 2008-15 and led Slovenia to its first EuroBasket title in 2017. Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":34162,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/kentucky-washington-complete-package-after-staying-around","date":"2019-04-23","title":"Kentucky's Washington ready to show off complete package","content":" Kentucky coach John Calipari\u2019s program has seen great players \u2014 John Wall, Anthony Davis, Karl-Anthony Towns, etc. etc. \u2014 come and go during his 10 years in Lexington, most logging the mandatory one season before moving on to the NBA. A notable exception to that stream of one-and-done departures was P.J. Washington , who arrived as a freshman in 2017-18, stayed for his sophomore season and blossomed into a star some thought capable of hijacking Tennessee forward Grant Williams\u2019 bid to become a two-time Southeastern Conference player of the year. Washington didn\u2019t quite get that done, but he did boost his NBA Draft stock while also etching his name in Kentucky lore with what can only be described as a gut check return from a sprained foot suffered against the Vols in the semifinals of the SEC tournament. The 6-foot-8 Washington missed Kentucky\u2019s first two games in the NCAA tournament, and though the Wildcats didn\u2019t need him in a first-round victory over Abilene Christian, it was scary facing pesky Wofford \u2014 an excellent mid-major team with the perfect blend of size and shooting \u2014 without him. But Kentucky got past the Terriers, advancing to the Sweet 16 against Houston. Would Washington, who made the aggressive decision to have his foot encased in a cast instead of a walking boot to speed the healing process, be able to go? The Cougars, a formidable No. 3 seed that didn\u2019t lose a non-conference game and finished 31-2 through the regular season and American Athletic Conference tournament, were playing in their first Sweet 16 since 1984 and eager for a crack at mighty Kentucky. Speculation about Washington\u2019s availability ran rampant, but Wildcat fans were encouraged after he posted a meme on Twitter that clearly showed he had shed the cast. Calipari added to the intrigue with a tweet of his own that included the meme and the words \u201cUh oh.\u201d Still, Washington wouldn\u2019t bite during a pregame press conference when he was asked multiple times whether he\u2019d play. \u201cI don\u2019t know yet,\u201d Washington said. \u201cI walked over here. That\u2019s good. I\u2019m thinking of giving it a go. It\u2019s just up in the air.\u201d As it turned out, Washington did more than give it a go. He played 26 minutes, scored 16 points and was clutch in the final five minutes as Kentucky got past the Cougars 62-58 and advanced to the Elite Eight. \u201cWe don\u2019t win the game today without him,\u201d Calipari said. How did Washington do it? \u201cI took some pain pills before the game,\u201d he said. \u201cKind of started hurting in the second half, but I had to tough through it.\u201d Though Kentucky lost to Auburn \u2014 a team it had beaten twice in the regular season \u2014 in the Elite Eight, that didn\u2019t put a damper on Washington\u2019s comeback, or the season he put together. Washington struggled late in the non-conference season and early in SEC play, failing to reach double-figure scoring against North Carolina (five points in 33 minutes), Texas A&M (nine in 28) and Vanderbilt (three in 32), but once he emerged, he was hard to handle. Starting with a 21-point effort against Mississippi State\u2019s rugged front line on Jan. 22 and ending with 23 against Tennessee on Feb. 16, Washington averaged 21 points in an eight-game stretch. Kentucky lost just once during that run and only twice through the January and February. Washington was a big reason. SEC pundits began to take notice of his all-around game and some began to opine he could overtake presumptive league player of the year favorite Williams. Williams went on a tear of his own in the regular season\u2019s final few games and wound up with that POY trophy, but Washington\u2019s efforts \u2014 he averaged a team-high 15.2 points and 7.5 rebounds \u2014 weren\u2019t lost on NBA scouts. Washington has a complete package. He uses his 7-foot-3 wingspan to full advantage, blocking shots or launching a deadly jump hook. After shooting 23.8 from 3-point range as a freshman and taking just 21 shots from behind the arc, he became a legitimate threat (41.9, 31-for-47). He\u2019s has the patience to see plays develop and affect them with his passing ability. Washington, again taking advantage of his length, can also defend multiple positions. After Washington racked up 20 points and 13 rebounds against Kansas in a late-January game in the Big 12-SEC Challenge, Calipari raved about the sophomore\u2019s energy. Cal\u2019s job isn\u2019t necessarily easier because he recruits so many five-star freshmen. Great players have to exert effort, too, and sometimes it can be difficult to convince them that a higher level of competition demands a higher level of engagement. \u201cI think when he plays at a different pace, a different level of intensity, a different level of bouncing and alertness, he\u2019s as good as anybody in the country,\u201d Calipari said. \u201c When he doesn\u2019t, he\u2019s okay. So that becomes, what do you want? And then when you play that way, the hard thing is, to live up to that and have to do that all the time. That\u2019s when you become special, where you thrive in that environment.\u201d After making a wise decision to stay in school after his freshman season, Washington bought into Cal\u2019s logic and thrived in the environment. The results were evident on the floor, and should be on NBA Draft day, too. He\u2019s a consensus first-round pick and some mock drafts have listed him in the lottery. SEC coaches who watched miles of tape trying to figure out how to handle Washington were particularly impressed with his progress. \u201cHe is versatile, he can face up, he can bounce it, he can create off the dribble, he\u2019s a good passer, and he can score with his back to the basket,\u201d Mississippi State\u2019s Ben Howland said. \u201cHe can hurt you in any way possible.\u201d \u201cI thought Washington really, all year he has turned into one of these big shot guys, timely guys, and they play through him and they\u2019ve got good connectivity offensively,\u201d Florida\u2019s Mike White said. * * * Chris Dortch is the editor of the Blue Ribbon College Basketball Yearbook .

But give Jazz guard Donovan Mitchell credit: Two days after his late-game meltdown allowed the Rockets to steal Game 3 despite a historically bad shooting night by James Harden, the budding young star bounced back with a vengeance. Refusing to go quietly into the offseason, Mitchell exploded for 19 of his 31 points in the fourth quarter as the Jazz extended the series with a 107-91 victory in Monday\u2019s Game 4. Up until that decisive fourth, the contest was playing out in remarkably similar fashion to Game 3. The Rockets were struggling on offense, shooting just 41 percent from the floor despite sinking 17 3-pointers, and somehow led by three heading in to the final 12 minutes. Enter Mitchell. In stark contrast to Saturday, when he missed 16 of his last 20 shots \u2014 including the potential tying 3-pointer in the final seconds \u2014 Mitchell lifted the Jazz on his shoulders and carried them home. His 3-pointer on the first possession of the fourth tied the game at 79. He followed with two more during a personal 10-0 run that gave the Jazz a commanding 91-80 advantage. The Rockets never seriously threatened after that as Mitchell helped finish them off for good with the type of finish that was sorely lacking in Game 3: The Jazz now head back to Houston for Game 5, where the Rockets won 31 of 41 games during the regular season. Even if Utah pulls that one out, they\u2019d still have to win Game 6 at home, then again in Houston to execute what would be the greatest comeback in NBA history. The odds of that are somewhere between slim and none. But you\u2019ve got to start somewhere, and thanks to Mitchell, the Jazz finally have a much-needed beachhead. For any real championship contender, the first round is merely the warmup for what promises to be a much longer, far more grueling journey. But the Bucks can be forgiven for taking an extra moment or two to savor their first-round sweep of the Pistons, which they completed with a 127-104 victory in Game 4. This wasn\u2019t just any series victory. This was Milwaukee\u2019s first series victory since 2001, and its first sweep since 1983 \u2014 a triumph over Larry Bird\u2019s Celtics that took place more than a decade before the birth of current franchise savior Giannis Antetokounmpo. (In addition, the Bucks\u2019 plus-95 point differential in the series marked the second largest in a four-game sweep in NBA history. The Pistons, meanwhile, lost their 14th straight playoff game to set a new league mark for futility.) Per usual, the Greek Freak had his enormous fingerprints all over the game, erupting for 41 points on 23 shots to become the first player in playoff history with 40-plus in less than 32 minutes. Antetokounmpo\u2019s shot chart illustrates the Thanos-level dominance he brought to bear with a snap :  When he wasn\u2019t throwing down the usual array of rim-rattling dunks, Antetokounmpo \u2014 who also earned 20 free throws \u2014 was doing stuff like this, for which the Pistons had absolutely no answer: Giannis also pulled down nine rebounds, dished out three assists and blocked four shots, swooping in at one point to spike Ish Smith\u2019s ill-advised floater into the court with such force that even Pistons fans couldn\u2019t help but be amazed: Yup, Giannis will do that to you. And now the Celtics are next up to take on the NBA\u2019s long-armed angel of death and a Bucks team that is already reaching heights the franchise hasn\u2019t been to in a generation. \u201cIt means a lot,\u201d Antetokounmpo said. \u201cI\u2019ve been six years in the league, and just to win our first playoff series with this group, it\u2019s unbelievable. We played great basketball.\u201d And for anyone who celebrates the Bucks\u2019 triumph a little too hard\u2026"},{"id":34156,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nets-joe-tsai-fined-detrimental-statements","date":"2019-04-22","title":"Nets' Joe Tsai fined $35K for comments detrimental to league","content":"NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Brooklyn minority owner Joe Tsai was fined $35,000 by NBA Commissioner Adam Silver on Monday for public statements detrimental to the league, becoming the latest member of the Nets organization to be penalized for actions during their playoff series against Philadelphia.

Harris, the league\u2019s leading 3-point shooter (by a comfortable margin) in the regular season and the winner of the MTN DEW 3-Point Contest at 2019 NBA All-Star, has shot 3-for-16 (19 percent) from 3-point range in the first-round series between his Brooklyn Nets and the Philadelphia 76ers. All of his 3-pointers came in the first quarter of Game 1 and, over the last 15 quarters, Harris has gone 0-for-12 from deep. It\u2019s the first time in more than two years ( since Jan. 2017 ) that he\u2019s gone three games without making a 3-pointer . Credit goes to the Sixers\u2019 defense for keeping Harris from getting open too often. He\u2019s been able to fire off just six 3-point attempts in 121 possessions with J.J. Redick guarding him . But Harris has also missed some wide open looks, none more important than the one he got midway through the fourth quarter of Game 4 on Saturday. With the Nets up six, coach Kenny Atkinson drew up a play that left Harris wide open on the right wing after setting a screen for D\u2019Angelo Russell. Redick switched onto Russell, but Ben Simmons didn\u2019t stay with Harris, who didn\u2019t have a defender within 10 feet of him when Russell got the ball back to him. In the regular season, Harris shot 48.1 percent on catch-and-shoot 3-point attempts, best among players (including Stephen Curry) with at least 200 catch-and-shoot attempts. If he had made that wide-open shot, the Nets would have had a nine-point lead with 5 1\/2 minutes to go. \u201cWe love,\u201d Atkinson said Monday, \u201cthat shot.\u201d The shot rimmed out, but that wasn\u2019t the Nets\u2019 only missed opportunity in the fourth quarter of Game 4 \u2014 when the Sixers scored just twice on a stretch of 11 possessions and the Nets couldn\u2019t put them away. Harris missed two open 3-pointers, D\u2019Angelo Russell missed a layup, and both Spencer Dinwiddie and Caris LeVert missed free throws. If any of those shots go down, the Nets are probably going back to Philadelphia for Game 5 on Tuesday ( 8 p.m. ET, TNT  The league\u2019s Last Two Minute Report also acknowledged that Tobias Harris got away with a \u201cwrap\u201d foul when Jarrett Allen began his roll to the rim that ultimately resulted in the turnover that ended the Nets\u2019 hopes for tying the series. Atkinson pointed out the no-call in his postgame news conference: \u201cThat\u2019s a point of emphasis from Day 1 at the coaches\u2019 meeting, how they\u2019re going to really emphasize that, beginning of the game and end of the game, and all season.\u201d Additionally, Nets general manager Sean Marks was suspended for Tuesday\u2019s game and fined $25,000 for entering the referees\u2019 locker room after Game 4. The Last Two Minute Report also pointed out that Dinwiddie got away with a discontinued dribble before Russell hit a go-ahead three with 1:26 left in the fourth. Atkinson had put the missed call behind him by the time he spoke to the media on Monday afternoon. \u201cThat is not the reason we lost,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Nets lost because we weren\u2019t good enough quite honestly. We weren\u2019t good enough. We didn\u2019t make the plays. We didn\u2019t make the shots. We didn\u2019t execute.\u201d Harris, meanwhile, wouldn\u2019t dwell on the open threes that he missed. \u201cThe shots, all that stuff, kind of comes and goes,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to be hitting every single game. You wish that you could. But there\u2019s a lot of other areas to impact the game where I focus more on. So I was more concerned with, position-wise, where I was at defensively on certain plays and what I could have done differently, rather than about missing shots.\u201d To his credit, Harris responded from that wide-open miss and put the Nets ahead in the final minute of Game 4 with a tough finish over Joel Embiid, one possession before Mike Scott hit the game-winner on the other end of the floor. \u201cJoe\u2019s not just a shooter,\u201d Atkinson said. \u201cHe\u2019s much more. These highs and lows come with shooting and generally you look at our last two games, I can back it up analytically, we\u2019re getting shots. We\u2019re not shooting it at the level we have even during the year. We\u2019re not shooting the ball well. I think that will come back. I think we\u2019re due; we\u2019re overdue so hopefully it happens this next game.\u201d Harris did admit to feeling the 12 consecutive misses. \u201cWhen you\u2019re going through a game and you miss your first couple,\u201d he said, \u201cyou definitely put a little bit of added pressure on yourself. And there is that sense of frustration. You got to block it out and realize that the whole goal of what I\u2019m trying to do is just get open shots. If I can get a clean look, I do feel confident that it\u2019s going to go in.\u201d He\u2019ll have more opportunities on Tuesday. If the Nets are to extend their season beyond that, they\u2019ll need to put the frustration of Game 4 behind them. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of what we\u2019ve done all year,\u201d Caris LeVert said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had tough losses that we\u2019ve had to shake out of our memory and kind of go out there and try to correct in and get a win.

But if there were, Damian Lillard\u2019s rating would be off the charts. The Portland Trail Blazers\u2019 star put on a dazzling display Sunday night at Chesapeake Energy Arena, teaching a masterclass while taking on one of the league\u2019s other elite point guards: Oklahoma City\u2019s former Kia MVP and triple-double machine, Russell Westbrook. Lillard staked the Blazers to a sizable third-quarter cushion, one that expanded to as many as 19 points. He manipulated the entire floor down the stretch and helped his crew exit the building with a momentum-stealing 111-98 victory and a 3-1 lead in this series. It was the sort of performance Lillard hinted at a day earlier, when the Thunder were still riding high from a Game 3 win where they taunted and tweaked the Trail Blazers, using every tool they could to make a dent in this series. Lillard swore he wouldn\u2019t allow his team to fall into the trap of trading taunts. There would be no retaliation for Paul George\u2019s Game 3 reverse dunk that didn\u2019t beat the final buzzer when the game was already well in hand. There was no need to respond to Westbrook\u2019s gestures and chatter after seemingly every basket. He stuck to his word. There was too much at stake in Game 4 for the focus to be anywhere and, in doing so, the Blazers snapped an eight-game road playoff losing streak dating to 2016. Lillard and the Blazers, still smarting from last spring\u2019s sweep at the hands of the No. 6-seeded New Orleans Pelicans, can ill afford to play petty games with so much riding on this postseason. They stumbled down the stretch of the regular season, dealing with injuries to CJ McCollum and then the devastating loss of their starting center, Jusuf Nurkic, on March 25 . Portland\u2019s margin for error this spring is razor thin, what with all the doubters wondering if they\u2019d fall victim in the first round again after earning the No. 3 seed in back-to-back playoffs. \u201cWhen we had our backs against the wall dealing with those injuries, we trusted each other, we leaned on each other more,\u201d said Lillard after roasting Westbrook and the Thunder for 24 points and eight assists. \u201cIt just made us better in the long run, instead of us saying \u2018We got some injuries, Dame you gotta average 35 and do all this extra stuff,\u2019 instead of that the mentality was, \u2018Let\u2019s keep the ball moving, make the right plays defensively and let\u2019s just be a better unit.\u2019 Instead of turning to me or somebody else to score a bunch of points. We just made it a group thing and I think that was for our team. \u201cAnd as far as people doubting us coming in, you don\u2019t just become the third seed luckily, especially two times in a row. Last year our performance wasn\u2019t great in the playoffs. But I think we showed a lot by backing it up this year and getting the third seed again. We don\u2019t focus on doubters. We focus on ourselves. We accept the responsibility for our past two playoff performances and we\u2019ve moved on. And I think that\u2019s one of the biggest and best things we did for ourselves is we did not hold on to it. We moved on and we have a better run now. We just have to finish it.\u201d They have an opportunity to finish this series at home Tuesday night because they\u2019ve learned to move on immediately. Their appetite for all of the \u201cperiphery\u201d antics, as Blazers coach Terry Stotts categorized all of the back and forth from the first three games of the series, was nonexistent. Steady had to be the rule. \u201cThis was the chance they would have had to tie the series up,\u201d Lillard said. \u201cSo you expect the excitement, you expect the passion. But after last game it was a big deal being made out of the back and forth and we weren\u2019t emotional about it. We were just competing and passionate about the game as well. \u201cBut it\u2019s like I said earlier. We didn\u2019t really engage in it because our focus was our team. Like I told you guys, we\u2019re not going go out here and go crazy on the refs. We\u2019re not going go out here and get in shouting matches and all that stuff. We\u2019re going go out here do whatever gives us a chance to win games. And I was proud how our team stuck to that.\u201d While Westbrook played a strange, disengaged game at such a crucial time (5-for-21 shooting, missing his last 10 shots), Lillard was plugged in from the start. He probed and studied OKC\u2019s defense until he felt it was the right time to strike. It was \u201cDame Time\u201d in the third quarter, like it was in Game 3. Lillard scored 15 points \u2014 including three straight back-breaking deep 3-pointers \u2014 during a wicked run that saw the Blazers build that 19-point lead. Even after a rough 2-for-8 shooting start in the first half Sunday night, Lillard said he relished the position his team was in. \u201cI loved it, I think anytime we can be on the road playing against a really good team and not playing well and I haven\u2019t been scoring the ball and we have a lead that late in the game that\u2019s a great situation,\u201d Lillard said. \u201cJust because a lot of time I\u2019m not in that position. I\u2019m usually getting attempts, scoring the ball and that\u2019s what\u2019s working for us. Tonight it wasn\u2019t like that. But I also know that all I need is to see it go in one time and once it goes in that can turn into three or four or five. That\u2019s kind if what happened in the third quarter.\u201d The Blazers know what happens when Lillard taps his arm, pointing at the imaginary watch that signals his time to shine. \u201cWell, we\u2019ve kind of come to expect it,\u201d Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. \u201cI think he really manages the game. I think he senses the moment when we need him to do different things. He\u2019s an ultimate competitor. However the game is going, if it\u2019s going well, if it\u2019s not going so well, he\u2019s going to give it his all. A lot of times that\u2019s with his scoring. But I think his leadership, his passing, the way he directs the team, the example he sets, all that.\u201d \u201cAll that\u201d was on display when the Blazers needed it most in Game 4. Lillard was also the counselor, floor general and calming presence needed to handle this delicate business. He calmed down young big man Zach Collins to keep him from getting a technical foul for jawing with an official. He repeatedly found Al-Farouq Aminu (19 points, 4-for-9 on 3-pointers) for quality shots. When the Thunder tightened up their defense on Lillard, he deferred to McCollum (team-high 27 points) to beat back OKC\u2019s late rally. \u201cI think we\u2019re a lot more mature than we\u2019ve been in past years,\u201d said McCollum, who closed the Thunder out late with 13 points in the fourth quarter. \u201cWe can handle adversity, understanding what we wanted to accomplish tonight \u2026 multiple times we had discussions about the fact that if they don\u2019t have a black-and-red jersey on, don\u2019t talk to them. Don\u2019t talk to the refs, don\u2019t talk to the other team. Execute our game plan, and let\u2019s get out of here with a win.\u201d That shared mindset and leadership style from Lillard and McCollum is what drives these Blazers. It\u2019s what will allow them to advance in this postseason and what will guide them in the future. When the pair embraced on the floor as they subbed out late in Sunday\u2019s game, there was an acknowledgement of all they\u2019ve been through \u2026 and could envision as well. \u201cWe\u2019ve dealt with a lot of criticism and lot of praise and we were just having a good conversation that was private, so I won\u2019t share with you guys,\u201d McCollum said. \u201cBut we were just talking about what we can accomplish going forward and what we\u2019ve accomplished so far and just the fact that we got love for each other.\u201d * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

He quietly and deftly managed a remade Raptors roster, incorporating four new starters while keeping a 10-man rotation happy en route to a second-place finish in the Eastern Conference. Toronto\u2019s early playoff success \u2014 Sunday\u2019s win over Orlando marked the first time the franchise has ever led a series 3-1 \u2014 will further boost Nurse\u2019s reputation. So will the newest iconic GIF on NBA social media, courtesy of Nurse after a three-second violation with which he did not agree. Nurse was sincerely bemused when asked about the reaction after the game. \u201cIs trending good?\u201d he quipped. \u201cGood\u201d might be up for debate, but there is no doubt his nationally televised reaction will at least be useful to countless social media users in the months to come. The Boston Celtics completed their first 4-0 series win since since they swept the New York Knicks in the first round in 2011. It was the first time they\u2019ve swept the Pacers since 1992. The Celtics\u2019 depth and defense was simply too much for the overmatched Pacers, who were without star Victor Oladipo. Indiana hung tough with Boston through the start of the fourth, but couldn\u2019t withstand a flurry of 3s by the Celtics in the final minutes. Gordon Hayward came off the bench for 20 points and Marcus Morris added 18 points. The two combined for five 3-pointers in the final five minutes to lead the Celtics to the 110-106 victory in Game 4 . Kyrie Irving finished with 14 points and seven assists, but the firepower he brought to the previous three games wasn\u2019t needed to complete the sweep. On the other side, at least Pacers fans got this one to play all offseason: Damian Lillard is reigning All-NBA First Teamer, yet he can only do so much on behalf of the Blazers\u2019 postseason effort. Enter CJ McCollum, who is enjoying the best playoff run of his career. The former No. 10 overall pick is averaging 26.3 points, 6.3 rebounds and 4.5 assists against Oklahoma City while shooting a scalding 51.6 percent from 3. McCollum has produced in playoffs past, but there is an added edge to his play this spring. That was evident in this back-to-back sequence in which he rejected Paul George on one end and buried a shameless pull-up 3. When both halves of the Blazers\u2019 backcourt are clicking, few offenses are equipped to keep up. Klay Thompson enjoyed one of his signature microwave nights for the Warriors, putting up 27 first-half points and finishing with six 3s on nine attempts. The performance was Thompson\u2019s first with 20 points or more since March 31. It turns out he was very aware of his low-scoring stretch. Thompson admitted to reporters after the game that, while playing beach volleyball with Jonas Jerebko on Saturday, he decided to take a quick swim to \u201cclear his head.\u201d Shooters, you heard it from Klay. If your shot\u2019s in a funk, go take a dip. Terry Stotts is no-frills kind of guy, but that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s not culturally unaware. After observing that \u201cboth teams played hard,\u201d the Blazers coach thoughtfully pointed skyward and paid his respects to Rasheed Wallace. For those who don\u2019t remember, Wallace repeated that phrase ad nauseam during a 2003 playoffs postgame news conference. Magic Johnson has mostly kept a low public profile since his surprise resignation as the Lakers\u2019 president of basketball operations. But he and his wife, Cookie, stepped out in style as they prepared for Sunday\u2019s Easter observance: David Lundy also contributed to this edition of About Last Night."},{"id":34155,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/curry-goes-cold-no-one-notices","date":"2019-04-22","title":"Curry goes cold, but no one notices","content":" LOS ANGELES \u2014 The world occasionally bears witness to rare phenomena: snowfall in early summer, the total solar eclipse, and yes, a pair of all-time great shooters who share three Kia MVPs hitting nothing but rim in a not-quite-24-hour span across two series. Saturday in Salt Lake City, James Harden missed his first 15 shots. Sunday afternoon in Los Angeles, Stephen Curry doinked all but one of his nine 3-point attempts . Did someone misalign their moons? Curry nearly drowned in misfires, no matter how open he was left by the LA Clippers. Yet, just as Harden\u2019s team discovered a night earlier, it didn\u2019t alter the eventual outcome. Yes, ultimately it was all about the Clippers falling even if Curry\u2019s shots didn\u2019t. That means all was well with the Warriors after a 113-105 Game 4 victory that moved them closer to an anticipated Western Conference semifinals series with Harden and the Houston Rockets. This is the luxury the Warriors enjoy, that even an off-night by one All-Star \u2014 or All-NBA \u2014 player can be compartmentalized by others, in this case Kevin Durant (33 points) and Klay Thompson (32). But this is nothing new for the Warriors in this dynastic era, where \u201cStrength In Numbers\u201d is a team slogan (and bad news for the rest of the league). Curry watched the Rockets-Jazz game, in which Harden, the league\u2019s leading regular-season scorer at 36.3 ppg, couldn\u2019t break through until the final quarter . The Rockets astonishingly kept the game close before the basketball gods finally bestowed mercy on Harden and released the handcuffs on his wrists. He and the Rockets are now one win from moving on. \u201cI like what [Harden] said afterward \u2014 it\u2019s all about winning,\u201d Curry said. \u201cWhether you have it going or not, whether you see the ball going in or not, you still have to stay engaged and obviously this is a team game. You have to have everyone contribute. You really don\u2019t care about who\u2019s night it is.\u201d That sounds nice in theory and though there is some truth, the reality is only a handful of NBA teams can play this \u201cteam game\u201d of which Curry speaks about, these few who are blessed with multiple stars who can cover for each other. How many can watch their franchise player go 3-for-14, as Curry did Sunday, then yawn and simply throw the ball to Durant? Or Thompson? Again, this is what makes the Warriors the Warriors. While his fellow Splash Brother was busy building homes, Thompson ripped through the poor Clippers with 27 in the first half, making his first seven shots. Then Durant picked his spots to chip in, and suddenly the level of angst dropped considerably. Curry had a good feeling about Thompson when he saw his teammate return to the team hotel Saturday in typical Thompson fashion. \u201cHe walked into the hotel with a wet T-shirt with his shades on,\u201d Curry said. \u201cTypical Klay vibe. I knew what that meant. Nice for him to show out like he did. We needed every bit of it.\u201d If you survey the playoff landscape, you wonder if anyone can offset this many weapons in the fight. How about the Bucks and their singular force, Giannis Antetokoumnpo? Can they win a game, or even two, if he disappears offensively? How about the Philadelphia 76ers or the Toronto Raptors or the Boston Celtics going far with their top gun going cold? Should the Warriors and Rockets meet, we\u2019re set for an interesting scenario over the weekend. Because of the considerable gap between Harden\u2019s ability to get buckets and the next leading scorer on the Rockets, Chris Paul, the Rockets will lean heavily on Harden to drop at least 30, or else. The Warriors have no such worry unless two stars are suffering in the same game, and how unusual would that be, if, say Durant and Curry are brothers in misery? Even if one of them goes cold, what are the chances of it happening to that same player in the same series, or even the next game? As Warriors coach Steve Kerr said: \u201cGuys sometimes have a huge night, sometimes they struggle, but the great players like Steph, Kevin and Klay, they bounce back pretty quickly from tough shooting nights.\u201d Don\u2019t be surprised if Curry closes out the Clippers with a ballistic Game 5 on Wednesday. Matter of fact, be shocked if it doesn\u2019t happen, considering his history and his pattern. \u201cIt\u2019s basketball, you can\u2019t get too high or low,\u201d Curry said. \u201cThe numbers don\u2019t look good but it\u2019s timing and making the right decisions and being a threat until something opens up. You like to have a game where things might not be going your way but you\u2019re still impacting the game in some way or another.\u201d True enough, because Curry is much more than a shooter; his court vision can bail him out when the shot\u2019s not falling. Curry racked up seven assists and also added 10 rebounds Sunday, a productive night despite the missed shots. \u201cYou can\u2019t get down and let that energy affect you,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to make some tough shots. I got 14 shots and 11 were solid ones. I forced up three of them and I know that because I think about those positions and I want them back. You just try to be as patient as possible, knowing that it\u2019ll come around eventually. You still have to be a threat out there, be aggressive and stand out on the floor and make the right plays. Play great defense, not turn the ball over, just play hard.\u201d Curry will be fine and the Warriors didn\u2019t miss his shot much on Sunday, anyway. It helped that the Clippers, bless their hard-working souls, lack the superstar needed to take advantage of these situations in the playoffs. All roads point to the second round and another round with the Houston team that took the Warriors to the seven-game limit last spring. It\u2019s a series where the Rockets might pay the price this time if Harden rolls another 3-for-20. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years. You can e-mail him  here  .

When the doors open at Oracle Arena, hundreds of fans make a mad rush to the lower seats near the north basket to catch a glimpse of Curry in action before he takes the court roughly an hour later at tipoff. This is a common scene not only at Oracle but wherever the Warriors play. Yet only at Oracle are the fans blessed with a closing treat \u2014 Curry heaving 40-foot 3-pointers from off the court and out of view. In what is now famously known as the Tunnel Shot, Curry retreats beyond the mouth of the tunnel used by the Warriors when they enter the game and takes three or four shots from the tunnel. Often, he\u2019ll make at least one, and rarely does Curry go more than two games without splashing. What began as a playful ending to his pregame warmup is now a part of the Curry lore \u2014 and a popular one, too. In addition to being enjoyed by the fans, the Tunnel Shot has been shown on countless TV and Internet highlights and written up in newspapers worldwide. There is a co-star to this show. He is Curtis Jones, a 67-year-old grandfather who works security at Oracle. Jones has the responsibility of throwing passes to Curry for the Tunnel Shot, which he does underhanded from about 15 feet away and with amazing aim and a fierce determination to get each pass right where Curry likes it. Therefore, Jones has become an unlikely side player in the Warriors\u2019 dynasty as well as a staple at the oldest arena in the NBA, which will be permanently vacated once the Warriors\u2019 season ends. Shaun Powell spoke with Jones about Curry, the shot, the arena and what may become the end to an unexpected dream.  Shaun Powell: Why has the Tunnel Shot become so popular? Curtis Jones: It\u2019s because of the person doing the shooting and the difficulty of the shot. A lot of people have seen Steph take unbelievable shots during games, I mean crazy shots. But this shot might be the most amazing. He\u2019s not on the court. He\u2019s at a weird angle. He can\u2019t get a lucky bounce off the rim. And most people can\u2019t even see him release the shot. Plus, I imagine he might be a little tired from the warmup. But he takes it seriously and so I take it seriously. That\u2019s my nature anyway when I\u2019m doing my job. It\u2019s also fun and a lot of people enjoy it. I get a kick out of it, too. SP: How did this get started? CJ: One day Steph was shooting around and my security post is right at the tunnel entrance and so he always passes me on the way to the court and the way off the court. So I kind of inquired about his shot. All of a sudden, and I didn\u2019t know he was going to do this, he threw the ball to me and asked for it back. So I threw it back and he took the shot form the tunnel. It kind of like became a ritual as he would go out and warm up. After he would leave the court, he would tap me on my shoulder and it got to a point where it was understood what I was supposed to do from that point on. SP: Just like that? CJ: Yeah. It was a way of us connecting and if you know Steph, he connects with people naturally and very easily; that\u2019s why so many fans like him. Anyway, Steph said he got the idea for the shot from Monta Ellis, his former teammate, but from what I understand Monta, took the shot after practice and I don\u2019t go to practices. I don\u2019t recall Monta taking it before a game. Maybe he did and I didn\u2019t notice. SP: What\u2019s the best Steph has ever done with the shot? CJ : He made five in a row. SP: How did you get the job? CJ: I started here in 1994 after I got a tip from a friend of mine that the arena was hiring. I just came down, filled out an application and got a call later on to come to orientation. I\u2019ve been working in the building for 25 years and working on the floor for 21 years. SP: Did you play basketball? CJ: Not anywhere near this level. I\u2019m from Monroe, Louisiana. We had a basketball rim in our back yard. We ended up breaking it and replacing it with a basket tied to a tree. SP: But you seem so natural with the ball in your hands and especially making those passes to Steph. CJ: I always liked to pass when I did play as a kid. I developed strong hands and I could always get the ball to the right spot. I also learned how to get a good grip on the ball because when we played, we played either in the street or on the grass, and sometimes the ball would take a funny bounce. You had to grab it to keep your dribble. Who knew that this would help me many years later? It\u2019s a blessing. You just never know. SP: I noticed that when you came here today, you grabbed a ball from the rack and placed it underneath the courtside seats. Why? CJ : Well, I just don\u2019t want to throw any old ball to Steph. It has to be the right ball, not too old, not too new and slick. Something that would give him great rotation. So I look for the perfect ball as soon as I walk in the door and well before Steph comes out. Once I find it, I put it away so it\u2019ll be fresh for him, nobody else\u2019s hands on it. I put it under the seat and then put some chairs around in so nobody will notice it. SP: What if he misses the shot? Do you use another ball from the rack? CJ: No, we\u2019ll have someone get that same ball and then give it back to me. Nobody throws the ball to Steph but me. I don\u2019t think Steph wants it any other way. SP : How would you describe the atmosphere from the crowds? CJ : Funny thing is, we didn\u2019t have any crowds the first couple of months, the crowds were very sparse, then all of a sudden people started to come and get into position. It became a big deal. It\u2019s come to the point where everyone understands to get here as soon as they can and stay in their place. SP : Does it get out of hand? CJ : Not really. The fans are really under control and so there\u2019s no real pushing and shoving and people getting into disagreements. They just want to see the shot, and there\u2019s no bad seat in the house. SP : So many people are bending over the railing to get a piece of Steph. How does he handle that? CJ : Well, he can\u2019t really stop and do something for everyone. It bothers me to see a child disappointed and hurt. Curry means that much to them. Even a high five, a kid will remember that for the rest of his life. And he does as much as he can. But every now and then we\u2019ll get a kid who\u2019s challenged in a way, maybe in a wheelchair, or someone from Make A Wish. And someone will let me know, so when Steph comes off the court, I\u2019ll make sure that kid gets some time with him. He talks to them as if everything is OK. He doesn\u2019t waver. It\u2019s a natural reaction. He walks over and greets him like I\u2019m speaking to you right now. I respect him for that. He has a gift for that. SP : Have you and Steph had any meaningful conversation? CJ: You know, not really. We\u2019ve exchanged a few words every now and then and he\u2019s always very happy to see me. The only time I see him is when he\u2019s coming on the court or coming off the court and there\u2019s no time to talk. Besides, I have to keep my concentration at my post, because there\u2019s always people around and I have to constantly check their credentials and make sure nobody gets on the court that doesn\u2019t belong. SP: What would you two talk about? CJ : It would be a normal conversation because I\u2019m a down to earth person and he\u2019s a down to earth person. We\u2019d probably talk about his kids, how\u2019s his family. SP: You realize you\u2019re a celebrity, right? CJ : (Laughs) I guess I am, although I really don\u2019t carry myself that way. It was amazing to see myself on TV for the first time. And my family, they\u2019re more excited than I am. I have a nephew in Delaware who saw me and he told all his friends and they got excited. I\u2019m kind of humble, actually. SP: Oracle Arena is closing the doors as soon as the season\u2019s over. The Warriors are moving to Chase Center in San Francisco and depending on the configuration of the floor, the Tunnel Shot might become extinct or impossible. Anyway, are you moving there as well? CJ : We haven\u2019t really had that discussion about that. I\u2019d like to go but I don\u2019t know. I\u2019d go. I\u2019m retired. I don\u2019t want to sit down in my life. I want to be active. If I\u2019m not part of it any longer, I guess I\u2019ll stay here and work whatever events they\u2019ll have here. That would be bittersweet. After you do something for so long you get accustomed to it and enjoy it. In life you look for positive things to enjoy so you\u2019ll have great memories as you grow older. And I\u2019m getting older. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years. You can e-mail him  here  .

And yet, somehow, with advantages you\u2019d happily pay several months of gameday revenue for as you attempt to dig out of a 2-0 deficit, you \u2026 lose?!?!? Such is the extent of the wounds the Jazz will have to lick before Tuesday\u2019s Game 4 as they dissect how in the world the Rockets were able to escape with a 104-101 victory that, if NBA history is any guide, all but ensures their advancement to the second round at 3-0. As great players are wont to do, Harden still had a big impact, finishing with 22 points despite shooting a miserable 3-for-20 from the field. (Not only did he set the aforementioned record for most consecutive misses at any point in a playoff game, his 15.0 shooting percentage was the third-worst of his career when taking at least 15 shots.) Harden insisted after the game he had no idea he was shooting that poorly, and his fourth-quarter production backs that up. Attacking the Jazz at every opportunity, he accounted for 22 of Houston\u2019s 30 points in the period, scoring 14 and assisting on eight more, as the Rockets held on against virtually all odds. His first bucket? A dunk with less than eight minutes remaining: He followed with a pair of 3-pointers, including a back-breaker at 1:11 after Jazz star Donovan Mitchell cut Utah\u2019s deficit to one with a 3 of his own. \u201cThat\u2019s James Harden,\u201d said Jazz coach Quin Snyder. \u201cHe\u2019s that good at the end. You give yourself a very small margin (if the game is close).\u201d Combined with great defense, good ball security, ample support (led by 18 points from the foul-plagued Chris Paul, five other Rockets scored in double-figures) and a nightmarish shooting night for Mitchell (18 missed field goals, one more than Harden), it was juuuuuuuuuust enough for the Rockets to escape.  \u201cJust keep shooting,\u201d Harden said of his mentality. \u201cMy job is to go out there and produce and be in attack mode. Nothing changes (at 0-15).\u201d Said Paul, \u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s win the game. It doesn\u2019t matter what he shot. We won the game.\u201d Just like championship runs have become a rite of early summer in San Antonio, so have early exits in Denver. When the Nuggets even make the playoffs at all, which they did this season for the first time since 2013. That was the last of 10 straight postseason appearances for the Nuggets. All but one resulted in first-round exits, with two of those coming after they squandered home-court advantage in the first two games. So it came with a strong sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, perhaps even inevitability, that the Nuggets promptly stumbled out of the gates once more with a 101-96 loss to the Spurs in the opening game of their first-round series. That put them in the unenviable position of needing to win their first game of any kind in San Antonio since 2012 \u2013 a stretch of 13 straight losses \u2013 and their first in the playoffs since 2007, when the team was anchored by Allen Iverson and Carmelo Anthony. Attempt No. 1 failed with a 10-point loss in Game 3 that wasn\u2019t that close. But with a 3-1 deficit staring them in the face, the Nuggets found some nerve, shaking off both their woeful history and a sluggish start to outscore the Spurs by 26 over the final three quarters for a commanding 117-103 victory in Game 4. Even with home-court advantage restored, they still have plenty of work to do if they hope to advance. But the maturity and composure displayed by Nikola Jokic and company on Saturday indicate these Nuggets, unlike so many of their predecessors, could actually be up for that challenge. I saw a confidence, a belief that\u2019s necessary to come in here and win. Nuggets coach Michael Malone \u201cI saw a confidence,\u201d said Nuggets coach Michael Malone. \u201cI saw a young team that wasn\u2019t thinking about 2012, because if you think about the last seven years, it will overwhelm you. We were living in the present, for Game No. 4. That\u2019s all we worried about. We know we didn\u2019t show up the way we needed to in Game 3. But guys stepped up (in Game 4), and it wasn\u2019t just veterans. I saw a confidence, a belief that\u2019s necessary to come in here and win a game like we did.\u201d Malone can put himself in that category as well, after making the necessary-but-gutsy decision to bench a struggling Will Barton in favor of undrafted 28-year-old Torrey Craig. The former G Leaguer made the 43rd start of his NBA career count, more than tripling his regular-season scoring average with 18 points while helping limit Derrick White, the star of Game 3 with 36 points, to just eight. (Just don\u2019t call him a postseason rookie. \u201c I\u2019ve been to the playoffs in Australia!\u201d he joked, as reported by Nuggets.com .) Barton, meanwhile, shook off his disappointment \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t agree with it,\u201d he said of his benching after the game \u2013 to contribute 12 points and three 3-pointers. Combined with quality outings from Jamal Murray (24 points, six assists) and the incomparable Jokic (29 points, 12 rebounds, eight assists), the Spurs were the ones losing their cool and questioning their own toughness \u2013 a predicament the Nuggets usually find themselves at this stage, rather than their opponents. \u201cThe Nuggets competed and we did not,\u201d said Spurs coach Gregg Popovich. \u201cTheir physicality was obvious from the get-go. You knew that was going to happen and we did not respond. So, it was a very disappointing loss.\u201d And for the Nuggets, a potentially defining moment. The best defensive stance of the day belonged not to Jimmy Butler, or Giannis Antetokounmpo, or P.J. Tucker. No, that honor belonged to Bucks assistant coach Taylor Jenkins, whose quick thinking and impeccable form helped his players keep their cool during a potential skirmish with the Pistons. The Bucks assistant made sure no one cleared the bench \ud83d\ude02 pic.twitter.com\/r5y4unBBP1 \u2014 Bleacher Report (@BleacherReport) April 21, 2019 Consecutive days Joel Embiid has gone without throwing shade: 0.

For only one of the 256 could you say the following: His team was at least five points per 100 possessions better offensively and at least five points per 100 possessions better defensively with him on the floor than they were with him off the floor. That player was Joel Embiid . The additions of Jimmy Butler and Tobias Harris this season have given the Sixers a ridiculously talented starting lineup. And with Embiid missing Game 3 of their first-round series against the Brooklyn Nets on Thursday, the rest of that lineup took care of business. But Embiid remains the Sixers\u2019 \u201ccrown jewel,\u201d as head coach Brett Brown has called him. He\u2019s a matchup problem for every team in the league and the difference maker for the Sixers on both ends of the floor. In Game 4 on Saturday, the Nets just couldn\u2019t match up, Embiid was the difference, and the Sixers came away with a 112-108 victory to take a 3-1 series lead. Embiid\u2019s line: 31 points, 16 rebounds, seven assists, six blocks and two steals in less than 32 minutes. He was the fulcrum on both ends of the floor. The Nets were one of five teams that took more than 40 percent of their shots from 3-point range this season. But they also led the league with 30.9 points per game scored on drives. The Nets\u2019 biggest offensive weapons in this series have been Caris LeVert and Spencer Dinwiddie, guards who can attack the rim by exploiting the Sixers\u2019 lack of quickness on the perimeter. Brooklyn was successful at the rim against Embiid on a few occasions, with both LeVert and Dinwiddie scoring over him. He also had a close-up look at a Jarrett Allen dunk when LeVert drove at him and dished off. But while the Philadelphia defense did bend at times, it never broke when Embiid was on the floor. And when Jared Dudley was ejected for shoving Embiid early in the third quarter, Brooklyn lost the only player who could possibly play center and make Embiid pay for hanging near the rim. \u201cI know these guys are going to go at me, because they want me to retaliate,\u201d Embiid said about the skirmish that started when he hit Allen with what was deemed a flagrant foul. \u201cSo I got to be the mature one on the court and just stay cool and don\u2019t react. I could have reacted, but I felt like my team needed me more than they did Jared Dudley. I just got to stay cool and mature and do my job.\u201d On defense, his job was to help the Sixers get stops. And with Embiid on the floor, Brooklyn scored just 62 points on 71 possessions. With him off the floor, the Nets scored 46 points on just 33 possessions. On the other end, Brooklyn just couldn\u2019t deal with Embiid in the paint. When they tried to front him in the post, the Sixers flashed a man to the foul line and got the ball to Embiid with high-low action. When he was doubled in the post, he found the open man, often Ben Simmons cutting to the rim after the Nets sent help off him. When Embiid caught the ball on the perimeter, he didn\u2019t settle, instead backing down into the post where he could score more easily or draw an extra defender (or two). In this series, Embiid has shot 22-for-35 (63 percent) in the paint and 3-for-14 (21 percent) outside it. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to live in the paint,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to have to double-team me. I figured that. They\u2019re going to have to send two or three guys. If they\u2019re going to guard me in single coverage, I\u2019m going to dominate. And then I\u2019m also going to make the right pass. That\u2019s my job. We found it.\u201d With the Sixers down one with 25 seconds left in the game, the Sixers looked to Embiid, with Allen fronting him in the post. Joe Harris crashed from the weak side and knocked the ball out of Embiid\u2019s hands, but Embiid beat Traveon Graham to the ball and, with one hand, got the ball to an open Mike Scott (Harris\u2019 man) in the corner for what turned out to be the game-winning 3-pointer with 18.6 seconds left. The goal in NBA offense is to find an advantage and use it to exploit the defense and get an open shot. Embiid is that advantage for the Sixers whenever he walks on the floor. And with him on the floor on Saturday, the Sixers scored 80 points on 69 possessions. With him off the floor, they scored just 32 points on 35 possessions. \u201cHe was dominant,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThere were times you can see that it\u2019s still raw, and there are some decisions that he probably would like to have over again. But given the volume of playing time lately that he hasn\u2019t had, it\u2019s just a dominant performance. What more can you say?\u201d Embiid remains the most important piece to the Sixers\u2019 puzzle. Really, when it comes to competing with the best teams in the league, he is the puzzle. The question is just how much they\u2019re going to have him going forward. For every game in this series, Brown hasn\u2019t known until shortly before tip-off whether or not he\u2019s going to have his most important player. Embiid was clearly hobbled in Game 1, better in Game 2, absent in Game 3, and dominant in Game 4. Maybe things are trending in the right direction. And maybe Embiid\u2019s status will remain a question from here on out. The Sixers\u2019 ability to compete for an Eastern Conference championship hangs in the balance. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

The breakneck pace, the hostile environment, the intensity and whatever drama the Oklahoma City Thunder and Russell Westbrook bring to the party in this first-round playoff series against Lillard\u2019s Portland Trail Blazers is all good. Bring all the smoke you want, Lillard insists. His crew is ready. So whatever craziness ensues in Sunday\u2019s Game 4 at Chesapeake Energy Arena will not surprise the unflappable leader of the Trail Blazers. The Trail Blazers persevered through it all before, during and after Friday\u2019s Game 3 loss here when the Thunder tried to rattle them. They endured every taunt, bump and sign of disrespect, the overt ones and the more subtle digs, because they had to. \u201cWe\u2019ve just got to focus on us,\u201d Blazers coach Terry Stotts said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to be us and do what we do and all of the peripheral stuff \u2026 doesn\u2019t have to do with us.\u201d Except when it does. When it fuels the opposition the way it appeared to gas up the Thunder before their home crowd. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be talk, it\u2019s going to be fouls, it\u2019s going to be all that stuff. All that stuff is going to be part of it. But it\u2019s who can deal with that stuff and not be too emotional,\u201d Lillard said Saturday, the day after a wild Game 3 atmosphere. \u201cWho can be more even-keeled. Who can handle it more and still have the right mentality through all of those things. And we just stay within ourselves, play hard and we compete. \u201cAnd if something is brought to our doorstep, we\u2019re going to open the door and see what\u2019s going on. And that\u2019s all it was. Because we don\u2019t go out there talking and acting no type of way. But like I said, if it comes to our doorstep, we\u2019re going to open the door and see what\u2019s going on.\u201d Love it or hate it, the playoffs come fully stocked with some built-in animosity between the combatants. When the foolishness fades, though, it\u2019s about the basics, about who can execute under duress with everything on the line. But the Blazers understand the importance of maintaining your composure better than anyone after losing their way last season in a first-round sweep against the Anthony Davis, Jrue Holiday, Rajon Rondo-led New Orleans Pelicans. This group is different. They\u2019ve been hardened by that failure and inspired by the resilience they showed this season in capturing the No. 3 seed for the second straight season. They won\u2019t take the bait. It\u2019s hard enough to maintain your focus and execute game plans against elite competition in the postseason crucible without added drama. Portland has lost eight straight road playoff games and is 0-3 in this city this season, regular season included. \u201cThat\u2019s their team, they can do whatever they want,\u201d C.J. McCollum said. \u201cOur team was wearing red last night. So I was worried about the team in red. It\u2019s easy for me. I just go hoop, same thing I\u2019ve been doing since I was 3 years old. It\u2019s just more cameras and more attention and more pressure for some people. \u201cBut I don\u2019t feel that. I just go hoop. And I become my best self in these types of moments. I just lock in, understand the game plan and play as hard as you can \u2026 and live with the results.\u201d The Thunder rode Westbrook\u2019s emotions and the palpable energy from their fans down the stretch in Game 3. With he and Paul George grinding away and shots falling from behind the 3-point line, it was easy to see how momentum shifted the way it did. \u201cObviously, the Oklahoma City fans are always going to have their team\u2019s back,\u201d said Blazers center Enes Kanter, who played in 179 games in two-plus seasons with the Thunder, and knows exactly what type of edge Westbrook can bring to help stir things up in this building. \u201cWhether they are up 20 or down 20, they are not going anywhere. \u201cThe environment is so much more intense anyway. I feel like the regular season compared to this is like AAU compared to college basketball. It\u2019s that much different. Every possession matters. There is no coming back when you make those fatal mistakes. So you have to be as prepared as possible \u2026 and play smart.\u201d And make sure to avoid the emotional land mines that can shake your focus. The Blazers have two players who will make sure to steady things for Game 4 in Lillard and McCollum, who in turn will make sure no one else strays. \u201cThey follow the leaders,\u201d McCollum said of the collective composure that will be critical for Game 4. \u201cThey follow Dame and I. Our demeanor and our mentality and our approach rubs off on them and they see it. They always say captains never panic. They won a game. Kudos. But a series is the first to four.\u201d * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

Who knew he\u2019d actually need one here in the playoffs? Life comes at you fast, and so does opportunity, and suddenly Bogut has gone from insurance policy to rotational player and perhaps the Warriors\u2019 best big man, all in a matter of days. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy,\u201d he said in that familiar Aussie twang. Two months ago, Bogut was in his native country, having just wrapped up an MVP season in Australia\u2019s National Basketball League when his caller ID showed a familiar area code from the U.S. On Sunday, he\u2019ll get some significant burn at Staples Center when the Warriors try to push their first-round lead over the Clippers toward 3-1. This is a case of a player being in the right place at the right time and a two-time defending champion not taking their place in the league for granted. As a result, Bogut has found new life for his NBA career at age 34 and the Warriors, a capable replacement for starter DeMarcus Cousins, who\u2019s probably done for the season with a torn right quad. \u201cAndrew has been a godsend,\u201d said coach Steve Kerr. \u201cThe reason it was such a great signing for us, is not that he\u2019s just a hell of a player, but because he has been with us and he is so familiar with what we do.\u201d Yes, this is a remarriage of convenience \u2014 Bogut knows the system and his way around the locker room, and the Warriors know what he brings and how to squeeze him into the system. When they signed him in mid-March, the plan was for Bogut to back up Cousins but mostly be someone who could provide additional leadership in the locker room and a wise voice on the bench. The bonus is Bogut is healthy, in tremendous shape and moving smoothly on the floor. This is the pleasant surprise the Warriors weren\u2019t fully expecting, but will take, even though the center position has never been emphasized during the Kerr era. Bogut\u2019s play in Game 3 made the Warriors more confident and reassured about the 5, anyway. He started, grabbed 14 rebounds, found open teammates and dished out five assists, proving respectable while defending the rim. Bogut played 25 minutes, his most in the NBA since January of 2017. \u201cHe looks amazing,\u201d Draymond Green said. \u201cIncredible to have him back where he belongs.\u201d Bogut has a bit of unfinished business with the Warriors. During his previous tour of duty, he suffered a knee injury in Game 5 and was lost for the remainder of the 2016 NBA Finals, which the Warriors ultimately lost to Cleveland. Bogut was a factor in that series and his injury, along with Green\u2019s infamous one-game suspension, probably cost Bogut a second championship ring and the Warriors a potential fourth during this ongoing dynastic run. The former No. 1 overall pick closed out his first 13-year stint in the NBA as a drifter, seeing scattered playing time with the Mavericks, Cavaliers and Lakers after the Warriors didn\u2019t re-sign him, just 51 games total. When the Lakers released him after 24 games in 2017, there were no other takers and Bogut retreated to Australia, all but retired from the NBA. Once his body healed, he chose to return to the game to success with the Sydney Kings. He was league MVP and Defensive Player of the Year, averaging 11.4 points, 11.6 rebounds, 3.4 assists and 2.7 blocks in 30 games. Besides basketball, Bogut began raising a family and the balance was beneficial to him. \u201cI feel good,\u201d Bogut said. \u201cProbably more mentally as well. Just felt burnt out mentally with the grind of the NBA season for 13 seasons straight. It was good to just get home and get back to some normality, playing in Australia once or twice a week. And then obviously having a family now. Family kind of changes my perspective of what should be stressful and what shouldn\u2019t be and what\u2019s important in life.\u201d The urge to return to the States simmered inside him, however, especially since he wouldn\u2019t need to trudge through an entire NBA season. Bogut says that\u2019s unlikely to happen again, no matter how well he plays from here. Still, he wants to make the most of the next two months, assuming the Warriors are still in business. \u201cLeaving and coming back makes you appreciate this much more,\u201d he said. \u201cHaving another opportunity to play with the best players in the world is great. I probably appreciate it much more now. When you\u2019re stuck in the moment as I was the first time around, I don\u2019t think I enjoyed it and been appreciative of it as I should\u2019ve been.\u201d From a numbers standpoint, the Warriors didn\u2019t need Bogut, even though Damian Jones, the starting center at the season\u2019s onset, is out with a torn pectoral muscle. Not only was Cousins healthy, but Kevon Looney showed growth and a new confidence in his mid-range shot. Looney, however, is more of a power forward, and the Warriors had nothing to lose by bringing in Bogut, a favorite of Kerr thanks to his instincts and intelligence. \u201cAndrew is a brilliant basketball mind,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cHe\u2019s one of those guys when you call a play or teach him a play, he gets it right away. He understands where all five players should be and he understands why you\u2019re running the play. He just has beautiful feel for the game. He sees and feels the game like Andre (Iguodala) does, only at the center position. His voice is so prominent, when you\u2019re down on the floor and our team is on defense, you can hear Boges barking out commands, barking out signals, letting guys know where they need to be, like he \u2019s like a quarterback out there.\u201d While Cousins was obviously a productive player, he often struggled in the pick and roll and has never been known for defense. Those are areas of strength for Bogut and it gives Kerr more options with Steph Curry and Klay Thompson, shooters who are deadly when sprung off picks. Also, with the emphasis on half-court play in the playoffs, Bogut\u2019s 7-foot stature becomes an asset near the rim on both ends. \u201cThis is the reason we signed him,\u201d Curry said. \u201cWe never wanted to talk about it and want to admit of the possibility. But it was to shore up that center position in case of injury. It\u2019s how it has played out. We have to be ready to adjust and win basketball games.\u201d The Clippers don\u2019t offer much resistance in the middle. Yet if the playoff seeds hold true and the Warriors see the Rockets in the second round, Bogut will be valuable against Clint Capela, who is active offensively in the pick and roll. \u201cI just want to be a positive to the team,\u201d Bogut said. \u201cThey don\u2019t need me to score, obviously. But whatever they need, really. I can be a voice defensively, control the paint and do what they need me to do. I feel I fit in pretty well. Not a whole lot has changed in the system and the flow of the game since my first time here. Hopefully as an older guy who\u2019s played around the world I can use my voice a little more and get guys going.\u201d One month into this reunion, Bogut and the Warriors have discovered they need each other more than either imagined. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

Jimmy Butler didn\u2019t like the way Dudley tried to show it. They both ended up getting ejected Saturday after their reactions led to a scuffle. Butler and Dudley were thrown out in the third quarter of the Philadelphia 76ers\u2019 112-108 victory over the Brooklyn Nets after pushing and shoving that spilled into the stands. Dudley reacted to Embiid\u2019s hard foul on Jarrett Allen, bumping the 76ers\u2019 All-Star center. Butler then shoved Dudley from behind to start the scrum. Dudley had been inserted into the starting lineup in Game 4 and was agitating the 76ers with his defense and his talking to Ben Simmons. \u201dI don\u2019t be paying attention to him too much,\u201d Butler said. \u201dI just don\u2019t think you should run up on anybody like that.\u201d \u201dEspecially because the foul was actually all ball,\u201d Embiid interjected. That\u2019s not the way the referees saw it, with crew chief Ed Malloy saying they ruled it a flagrant 1 after a video review because of Embiid\u2019s windup and unnecessary contact they saw as excessive. Dudley and the Nets had already been angered by Embiid, who elbowed Allen in Game 2 and was given a flagrant 1 that the Nets thought should have been a 2, which means an automatic ejection. They were further upset when he laughed afterward while apologizing during his postgame news conference. \u201dYeah, for sure I send a message,\u201d Dudley said. \u201dWhen you have a guy giving flagrant fouls, I mean Joel Embiid is second in the league in flagrant fouls. So for that elbow he had before just to have a flagrant 1, no fine, no nothing, laughing in the media, if you think that a team that I play on is going to have (to accept) that, that\u2019s another thing coming, especially on this young team.\u201d Simmons and Dudley \u2013 who had exchanged words earlier \u2013 along with Malloy all went tumbling into the front row as referees rushed in to intervene. Dudley and Butler were both given technical fouls. \u201dDudley and Butler were ejected for their role as escalators, from taking a situation that was under control and escalating it to a heightened altercation,\u201d Malloy said.

He bothers shooters, and he\u2019s really great at chasing and staying with guys. He mixes in making some threes and he\u2019s going to the basket and finishing. He and I were laughing that he\u2019s turned into our best power forward with a jump hook.\u201d Why not? Connaughton also is the Bucks\u2019 best hard-throwing righthanded major league baseball prospect. That\u2019s real, made official when the Baltimore Orioles made the native of Arlington, Mass., the 121st pick in the 2014 MLB draft and signed him for a $428,000 bonus. Connaughton had been fascinated with the possibility of excelling in two sports, dating back to his days rooting for both Paul Pierce and Pedro Martinez as a fan of the Celtics and Red Sox. He thrived in both basketball and baseball in high school, then sold the coaches at Notre Dame on pursuing the dream in college.  Connaughton spent the summer of 2014 in Class A, striking out 10 in 14.2 innings for the Aberdeen (Md.). Then he returned to Notre Dame to help the Irish go 32-6 and reach the \u201cElite Eight\u201d of the NCAA tournament. He averaged 12.5 points and 7.4 rebounds and made 93 of 220 (42.3 percent) from 3-point range. That spring, in his workouts for NBA teams, Connaughton showed enough to snag the No. 41 spot in the 2015 draft, a pick traded from Brooklyn to Portland that night. In three seasons with the Trail Blazers, Connaughton and his startlingly springy game averaged 3.7 points and 1.6 rebounds in 12.6 minutes. But by 2017-18, he had earned a regular rotation spot (5.4 ppg, 18.1 mpg, 82 appearances). All the while, he had friends, fans, critics and advisors whispering in his ears, one on each sport like the kid in \u201cAnimal House,\u201d only pushing the merits of baseball vs. basketball and vice versa. Connaughton fended them off to sign a two-year deal with Milwaukee last summer, and he worked through some mid-season inactivity to become a reliable call for Budenholzer now for duty at both ends. Between the best postseason game of his NBA career and the Bucks\u2019 flight to Detroit for Game 3 Saturday night, Connaughton talked with NBA.com\u2019s Steve Aschburner about the sport in his present and the other one possibly still in his future: Steve Aschburner : You and your team\u2019s other reserves have been around for this special season, contributing in ways big and small as bench players all hope to do. But to have such an impact \u2013 18 points, nine rebounds, four blocks in 31 minutes \u2013 in a playoff victory has to have been especially gratifying, doesn\u2019t it? Pat Connaughton : It\u2019s been great. But one of the things I\u2019ve tried to be better at as this year has gone on is understanding it\u2019s one game. As NBA players, so much of the game is mental, as far as confidence and playing against the best players in the world. You have to feel you belong but you also have to keep that chip on your shoulder. You need to be ready to try to do the same thing the next game and the game after that, to be as consistent as you can be. SA : Wait, that sounds almost like a coach. Coaches don\u2019t trust or can\u2019t fully enjoy the successes, even as they feel the full force of their losses. Don\u2019t you ever get to feel satisfied? PC : You have to be smart about how you do it. You pick your spots. After [Game 2], I was happy. I was satisfied with myself that night. You get a mix of texts from past friends or family or former coaches, and that\u2019s awesome, but you also hear from some people who thought you\u2019d never be able to do it. Now they think that\u2019s the best you could ever play and there will never be another game like it in your life! For me, that fuels the fire a little bit. Yeah, I played well and I\u2019m happy I was able to help my team win. But it\u2019s also kind of a backhanded compliment, when people look at it like I shouldn\u2019t be here. I should be off pitching somewhere right now and I was just \u201clucky\u201d to do it. SA : I\u2019ve noticed people are more comfortable second-guessing you because you\u2019ve had two major sports paths. If it was either the NBA or selling insurance, for example, fewer folks would be open about doubting you. But because you\u2019ve had the option to purse basketball or baseball, people feel free to offer up their opinions. PC  never going to have success at either sport because I wasn\u2019t giving my best effort at one of them. What I learned from that is, people will want to be right about what they told you more than they\u2019ll want to see you succeed at what you\u2019re trying to do. SA : I\u2019m not even going to ask you which sport you prefer, because I\u2019ve seen the inconclusive answers you give to that question. So I\u2019ll ask this instead: How do you get through four years of academics while juggling two varsity sports? PC : And Notre Dame academically isn\u2019t a walk in the park. But if it\u2019s really something you love, you\u2019ll figure out a way to get it done. I think there are a lot of people who say they want to be professional athletes, say they want to make millions of dollars, but don\u2019t necessarily like doing the hard work that goes into it. And any time there\u2019s adversity, they\u2019ll say, \u2018Well, I tried.\u2019 And go on to the next thing.  For me, it was my dream as a kid to play two sports at the highest level I possibly could. Doing that at Notre Dame just meant I had to sacrifice in ways a normal college student wouldn\u2019t have had to sacrifice. I went back to summer school every year, to make sure I got ahead of my classes. I took the hard classes in summer and was in position, if needed, to take a lighter load in the fall or spring semester. Or be in position to potentially graduate early and really prepare myself for the NBA draft combine. There were times during summer school where, on a Friday or Saturday night, I had to be in the baseball training center working on my arm strength or in the gym putting up shots. Quite frankly, it didn\u2019t feel like a \u201chave to.\u201d It was something I wanted to do. SA : Kyler Murray, the Oklahoma quarterback and Oakland Athletics prospect, has critics, as have other two-sport athletes. In your case, do you think the situation is complicated by being a white guy who\u2019s not seven feet tall and therefore not fitting into preconceived notions about NBA players? PC : Definitely. I\u2019ve tried to say it a little more politically correct. I use the phrase \u2018I didn\u2019t pass the eye test.\u2019 The eye test in the NBA is different from the eye test in baseball. If you take my build, make-up, everything into consideration, in baseball that\u2019s sought after. You don\u2019t find a 6-foot-5 pitcher with the athleticism and coordination I have all that often. It\u2019s why I was able to pick up on things very quickly when I went through a summer of minor league baseball. But in basketball, in most people\u2019s eyes, I\u2019m in the lower half or don\u2019t even make the cut for what they perceive to be an NBA player. SA : You have explained your sequencing of sports, with the NBA first and MLB perhaps later, by noting that athleticism could fade while your arm stays strong. But did you factor in the level of player \u2013 reserve vs. star \u2013 you might become in each sport? PC : I definitely have thought of that. I looked at my life from the standpoint of what I dreamed of doing when I was a kid. Obviously I\u2019ve wanted to be as successful at both sports as possible. You have to shoot for being an All-Star to have a chance to even make it in either, right? But I did think, \u201cIf I really went into baseball right now, if I dropped basketball when I was coming out of high school, I fully believe I\u2019d have had the chance to be an All-Star, to be one of the top two pitchers on a championship team.\u201d But something drew me to basketball, something drew me to having success in two sports. I\u2019m not saying there may not be a day when I play baseball \u2013 maybe in 10 years \u2013 and I might or might not reach that [All-Star] level. But it meant more to me to have success in both sports than to give up basketball before really having the opportunity. SA : How different are the sports, as you see them? PC : In baseball there\u2019s so much camaraderie and team things just from hanging around the ballpark together. But in the end, you\u2019re the one at the plate or you\u2019re the only one on the mound at that time. In basketball, everyone\u2019s involved in the play all the time. That\u2019s something I enjoy. Being a pitcher, and walking the bases loaded with no out and having to get out of the jam, it takes a mental toughness that I almost enjoy bringing on myself, to figure out how to get the outs. At the same time, to make a mistake in a basketball game and to immediately have the opportunity to run downcourt and get a block or a steal to make up for it and help your team, that\u2019s also something I enjoy. If a guy hits a home run off me, I have to wait eight batters to see him again. SA : So far in the 2019 playoffs \u2013 small sample size \u2013 you have an offensive rating of 146 and a defensive rating of 89. Those are straight-to-Springfield numbers over a career. What do you think about analytics, which got their early traction in baseball? PC : I think analytics are good for figuring out what guys do best. But I think they\u2019re more for coaches. Sometimes I don\u2019t think analytics tell the whole story. I try to not get too caught up in it. For me, it means giving the best effort that I can. And making fewer mistakes than the guy across from me. SA : Tell us something about Giannis Antetokounmpo that we don\u2019t know.  PC  has to work that hard\u2026\u201d Combined it with his talent, his size, his quickness, how much higher could his ceiling be? It started with us doing extra shooting drills and morphed into lifting extra weight. I think it\u2019s become part of who he is as a player. And he understands how having that work ethic affects the culture of your team. SA : OK, some background and personality stuff. What was the first car you owned? PC  Jeep Wrangler when I was going into my senior year of college. Got it after playing a summer in minor league baseball, with the signing bonus I got. Still have it. SA : Tell me a song you need to hear often, that means something to you? PC  \u201cHomecoming\u201d by Kanye West . It makes sure I never forget where I came from. I was once a random, little chubby kid from Arlington, Mass., who had no ties to professional sports. But I had a dream of it. Everyone who coached me, played with me, played against me had a hand in getting me to where I am today.  SA : What\u2019s your favorite place on Earth? PC  Hampton Beach, N.H. Because it was a place I finally grew up, going in the summers. And it\u2019s a place I\u2019ll always be able to go back to in the offseason. I have friends and family who have been there since the beginning. I\u2019ll be able to run around on the beach with my little cousins and act like the little kid I am at heart. SA: Your basketball coach at Notre Dame, Mike Brey, once said rather indelicately about you, \u201cHe has a horseshoe up his ass.\u201d What do you think he meant by that? PC [laughing] : I didn\u2019t see that, but it sounds like something that would be right up his alley. I think what he means by it is, I\u2019m a fortunate kid, which I definitely am. But I also think he would say I\u2019ve helped create some of that luck that a horseshoe may bring. Whether by hard work or doing the right thing or having the right people around me. \u201cIt definitely doesn\u2019t suck to be Pat Connaughton\u201d would be another one of his quotes. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

To watch at least. On the court, throughout this first-round series between the third-seeded Portland Trail Blazers and No. 6 Oklahoma city Thunder, the competition between Damian Lillard and Russell Westbrook seems a bit, ah \u2026 intense. Ya know, since first there was this: And then this: And then, over the next 9:50, there was this: After Lillard\u2019s playoff career-best flurry in the third closed the gap, the lead kept creeping just beyond the bramble in front of the Trail Blazers. Eventually, Westbrook (33 points, 5 rebounds, 11 assists) and the Thunder closed out a crucial 120-108 victory to stall the series at 2-1, Portland. And then, in the closing moments, Paul George saw fit to put a point on the evening\u2019s on-court festivities, taking a final-seconds turnover and opting to ascend for a 180-double-pump-reverse dunk as time was expiring. That went over exceptionally well with Lillard, who claimed he \u201ccouldn\u2019t care less\u201d while managing to insinuate if one were to care, if that level of effort could possibly be justified by such an action, that perhaps it was wildly out of line and that was obvious to anyone watching AND CAN WE JUST TIP OFF GAME 4 ALREADY?!!!??! (The full quote, for the record: \u201cI don\u2019t know. It was after the clock, but just doing that, whatever. I don\u2019t really care. It\u2019s the playoffs \u2014 people do things that, maybe they\u2019re trying to get under somebody\u2019s skin. Or maybe trying to make a statement. The game was over. The game was decided. Typically, people say you don\u2019t do stuff like that, but honestly I really couldn\u2019t care less. The game had been decided and if that was something they needed to do to make themselves feel more dominant or feel better, then so be it.\u201d Dame Time runs 24\/7. Never forget.) The sneaky truth of this series is that Lillard is doing the superstar thing of pushing Portland beyond what would seem to be their season limit, given the debilitating and untimely injury to Jusuf Nurkic, and a first-round opponent almost tailor-made to drag down his individual game. Friday\u2019s OKC victory required a monster (efficiency) effort from Westbrook \u2026 along with a team-wide uptick from 3-point range, led by Jerami Grant\u2019s 4-for-5 showing. If George continues to struggle through the shoulder injury that derailed a once-clear-cut case for No. 3 in this season\u2019s Kia MVP race, the Thunder might not be able to generate much disruption the rest of the way. The Celtics jumped all over the Pacers early in Friday\u2019s Game 3 victory, opening a 41-28 lead after one. The surprise scoring leader was third-year swingman Jaylen Brown, who put up 12 points in the quarter, hitting all four of his shots (three from behind the arc). But down the stretch, it was \u2014 of course \u2014 Kyrie Irving who helped ice these feisty Pacers: \u201cThe little floating shot he hit was just a joke,\u201d said Celtics coach Brad Stevens. \u201cHe\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d Irving finished the 104-96 win with 19 points, five rebounds and 10 assists. Another ho-hum day at the office. Ha. Pascal Siakam is (one of) the favorite(s) for the Kia Most Improved Player Award, and performances like Friday\u2019s are a prime reason why. The third-year forward posted 30 points, 11 rebounds and 4 assists in 41 minutes as the Raptors cruised to a 98-93 victory that never felt quite as close as that final score indicated. Also, he faked Terrence Ross out of his socks: Didn\u2019t hurt that Kawhi Leonard was out here on his usual ridiculous terrorize-both-ends tip, even after not having practiced for two days due to illness, per coach Nick Nurse postgame. A thing that happened today, in which choices were definitely, definitely made:"},{"id":34211,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/russell-westbrooks-legacy-hinges-playoffs","date":"2019-04-20","title":"More than ever, Westbrook's legacy hinges on playoff success","content":"OKLAHOMA CITY \u2014 Russell Westbrook\u2019s greatness is an old debate he decided a few years ago by doing things no other player of his generation can do. His legacy, however, is a different matter. For all of his triple-doubles, his breathtaking highlights and a frenzied and furious playing style that would resonate in any era, it\u2019s fair to question what exactly the Oklahoma City Thunder have to show for all of his energy and effort. Westbrook is in the physical prime of a surefire Hall of Fame career but without a signature accomplishment the franchise can trumpet beyond his Kia MVP honor from the 2016-17 season. The cold truth is the Thunder haven\u2019t been able to draft off Westbrook\u2019s rage in any meaningful way at playoff time. At least not yet. They\u2019ve won a grand total of four playoff games since Kevin Durant departed these premises for Golden State via free agency in July 2016. And that includes Friday night\u2019s 120-108 victory over the Portland Trail Blazers, when Westbrook played brilliantly at times and needed every one of his 33 points, 11 assists and five rebounds to outduel Damian Lillard (32 points, 23 of which came in a 10-minute stretch of the third quarter after Westbrook hit Lillard with his infamous Rock-da-Baby celebration). Westbrook vowed after Game 2 to be better. He had to be with the Thunder in an 0-2 hole. And he was. But Westbrook and Paul George, his Kia MVP candidate teammate and the replacement for Durant on the other side of the marquee at Chesapeake Energy Arena, haven\u2019t had the postseason breakthrough either man has been searching for since they joined forces. After three games against the relentless Blazers backcourt of Lillard and C.J. McCollum, there is no indication that it\u2019s in the offing now. The fact is, the Thunder are a perplexing bunch that, despite having two of the NBA\u2019s biggest stars as headliners, sit outside of true contender status in the Western Conference as presently constituted. This is no dig at Westbrook. Far from it. He\u2019s the most competitive human being wearing an NBA uniform today, a player willing to exhaust every fiber of his being to beat you. He plays with the sort of meddle that fans of all ages can appreciate. He\u2019s universally adored in Oklahoma City, where a rabid and raucous Thunder fan base cheers his every move on the court and celebrates the way he has embedded himself into the community off the court (when others chose to chase their destiny elsewhere). He should be applauded for giving everything he has in pursuit of becoming one of the greatest players of this or any generation. But at 30 and with seemingly all the security a superstar could ask for, have we already seen the best of what a Westbrook-led team will do? Is he satisfied with chasing 50-win seasons and playoff berths and the love and respect of these fans and his teammates above all else? Can he stomach having sniffed the air of The Finals just once, that 2012 run alongside Durant and James Harden when they were all too young and naive to know that return trips to the promised land are anything but promised? Or will he push for more? Will a player who revels in doing things his way even consider an alternative operating system? Because as fun as it might be to cherish these small victories, moments like these will wind up being empty calories if this is all there is. And like so many of his generation \u2014 the 30-and-over crowd \u2014 the clock ticks on everyone in this league, all-time greats and journeymen alike. Watching it all come to an end this season for Dwyane Wade and Dirk Nowitzki, luminaries Westbrook competed against and lost out to for championships or opportunities to play for them, should serve as a salient reminder for Westbrook that he\u2019s closer to the end than the beginning. If he\u2019s not willing to look in the mirror and ask himself the hard questions, to examine his NBA existence at this stage of his career, someone else here has to be willing to force the issue and do it for him. Someone has to be willing to go there, to dig in at a time like this, and give an honest assessment of where this Thunder team is right now and whether or not they see a road to a permanent perch in the upper echelon of the Western Conference playoff chase for the foreseeable future. Because if not, if there is no light on that horizon, then perhaps it\u2019s time to dive in on the debate. No, not of Westbrook\u2019s mercurial greatness, he\u2019s already provided more than enough data in his favor; his work in crunch time Friday night being the latest exhibit. It\u2019s time to debate whether that situational, spectacular, jaw-dropping greatness, as thrilling and crowd-pleasing as it might be, can produce anything more than what we\u2019ve already seen from the Thunder and its superstar. * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

All is right in his world and the Warriors\u2019 as well, with the five-alarm fire effectively being snuffed with a gale force that blew through Staples Center in Thursday\u2019s Game 3 . Gone is the memory of a blown 31-point lead in Game 2 and multiple Durant meltdowns, replaced by a splash of normalcy and restored order in the first-round playoff series against the overmatched LA Clippers. There are fewer questions being asked and less head-scratching taking place today about Durant. The former Kia MVP-turned enigma had been distracted by pesky Clippers guard Patrick Beverley in the first two games, none of which Durant finished. Durant was ejected from Game 1, a Warriors win, and fouled out of Game 2, a Warriors\u2019 gag, both times related to his engagement with Beverley. That\u2019s now over with after his 36-point effort in a 132-105 win last night . \u201cHe showed you what he was about,\u201d said teammate Klay Thompson. What Durant showed is what he\u2019s capable of doing when he directs his concentration and attention toward playing basketball and less toward Beverley. Rather than trying to win the game within the game, Durant chose to win the game. Does that make sense? Now more than ever in this series, it does. Durant did so with stealth and controlled fury, cranking his intensity right after the tip and taking his first shot 42 seconds into the game. By halftime he had 27 points , a personal first-half best in a playoff game, doing so without making a 3-pointer. The Warriors were up 21 points in what became a runaway win \u2014 this time, minus the Clipper comeback. But you knew this was coming. \u201cNot many people can stop Kevin Durant,\u201d said Warriors forward Draymond Green, \u201cwhen he doesn\u2019t want to be stopped.\u201d That goes for Beverley, who was finally humbled and checked and didn\u2019t have the sympathy of the referees this time. There was less chatter from Durant whenever Beverley used a low center of gravity on defense. While Durant did get two first-quarter fouls , Warriors coach Steve Kerr never gave any thought to subbing him out. Kerr sensed Durant was fully under control and wouldn\u2019t do anything borderline to risk getting into foul trouble or fall for Beverley\u2019s tricks. Durant felt, perhaps with some justification, that the officiating leaned toward Beverley and cited the David vs. Goliath tale. Yet Durant took exception to any suggestion that he had to \u201cprove\u201d something in Game 3. \u201cI\u2019ve been in the league 12 years, I\u2019m 30, I don\u2019t need to show anybody nothing at this point,\u201d he said dismissively. \u201cI just play.\u201d There were some in the organization who expressed concern about Durant\u2019s persona this season and especially lately. He finished second to Green in technical fouls this season and refused to ease in the playoffs. Durant earned a pair of techs for his suspension in Game 1. In Game 3, he earned another for carrying on a spirited conversation with Clippers forward JaMychal Green far too long for referee Scott Foster\u2019s liking. That\u2019s now three techs for Durant, and assuming the Warriors are soon headed to the Western Conference semifinals, there\u2019s a lot of playoff games to be played. How will Durant\u2019s teammates and Kerr feel if Durant gets his seventh playoff technical \u2014 and the one-game suspension it draws \u2014 sometime around Game 2 of The Finals, (assuming the Warriors reach that point)? Durant vs. Beverley has referees on heightened alert, which means there will be little patience or tolerance for verbal engagement going forward. That won\u2019t hurt Beverley, not with the Clippers down 2-1 in the series and seemingly on the their way out. It only jeopardizes those who are moving on. In Game 3, though, Durant put performance over agenda and it was infectious. The Warriors fell in line and delivered a dominant win. \u201cHe\u2019s a two-time Finals MVP and coming off a poor performance,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cThat\u2019s what happens. He had a different mindset and set a tone right away.\u201d Said Clippers guard Lou Williams: \u201cHe made that \u2018I\u2019m Kevin Durant\u2019 statement with confidence. He announced himself before he came here, and we didn\u2019t respond.\u201d Warriors center Andrew Bogut said: \u201cHe was pumped. He was the KD we know.\u201d Durant was on pace for 50 points, but Kerr showed some mercy and pulled him after 29 minutes. By then, the lead was secured. Bogut blocked a shot and threw to a streaking Andre Iguodala for a dunk and a 31-point lead. It was one that the Warriors didn\u2019t surrender because improbability doesn\u2019t strike twice. The Warriors are a win away from being able to keep one eye on finishing the job by Wednesday and another eye toward the Houston Rockets. They are flexing in their first-round series with the Utah Jazz and perhaps readying for a Warriors semifinal series roughly a week from now. As a side note, Staples contained a fair number of Warriors fans Thursday, just as it did during the regular season, killing any thought of L.A. turning up for the Clippers. This may change next season (depending on the Clippers\u2019 offseason), but for now, the atmosphere should be very much the same for Game 4 on Sunday ( 3:30 ET, ABC ). That means a segment of the building will be rooting for a certain Warriors superstar to stay true to his name, reputation and track record. \u201cWell,\u201d said Clippers coach Doc Rivers, \u201che\u2019s Kevin Durant. But I already knew that.\u201d You suppose? * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years. You can e-mail him  here  .

For most of this season, the Philadelphia 76ers\u2019 designated shooter was a better shooter when he shared the floor with center Joel Embiid. But with Embiid missing Game 3 of the Sixers\u2019 first round series against the Brooklyn Nets on Thursday, Redick scored more points than he did in Games 1 and 2 combined. And despite the absence of their most important player, the Sixers rolled to a 131-115 victory and took a 2-1 series lead. The Sixers\u2019 offense, which ranks No. 1 in the postseason at 120.8 points scored per 100 possessions, kept rolling without Embiid, even though replacement starter Greg Monroe shot 4-for-13. In scoring 32 points or more in all four quarters, the Sixers got big games from Tobias Harris (29 points on 11-for-19 shooting, 16 rebounds) as well as Ben Simmons (31 points on 11-for-13 shooting, nine assists). But it was Redick that had the Brooklyn defense scrambling for much of the second half. After scoring 10 points on 3-for-9 shooting in the first half, Redick broke out in the third quarter to help the Sixers gain separation in what had been a close game. A 14-3 Philly run turned a three-point lead into a 14-point cushion. Redick scored nine of those 14 points during the run. First, with Jimmy Butler probing the Brooklyn defense, Redick got loose from Joe Harris for a catch in the right corner, side-stepping Harris\u2019 closeout to drain a 3-pointer and put the Sixers up eight. Two possessions later, Redick cut from the right block to the left wing, side-stepped another Harris closeout, and hit another 3-pointer to put the Sixers up eight again. And two possessions after that, he drained a more standard catch-and-shoot 3-pointer off a pin-down to push the lead to 14. After that, Redick started opening things up for his teammates. Midway through the third, D\u2019Angelo Russell took his eyes off his own man to see where Redick was going. That man, Tobias Harris, found himself open for an easy catch-and-shoot 3-pointer. With their own Harris struggling to keep up with Redick, the Nets gave the assignment to Spencer Dinwiddie. But later in the third, Dinwiddie got caught in a dribble hand-off from Simmons and Jared Dudley fouled Redick on a corner three. When the Nets went to a zone, Redick circled through it, caught the ball at the top of the floor, and hit a pull-up three that put the Sixers up 16 late in the third. The Nets got back into the game with an 8-0 run to close the period. But Redick\u2019s gravity was felt midway through the fourth. With Dinwiddie trying to deny him the ball, he flared to the corner. As Dinwiddie closed out, Joe Harris took a step away from his man, Mike Scott. Redick got the ball to Scott, who ran a quick pick-and-roll with Simmons. And Simmons got a clean roll to the basket, because Dinwiddie was still attached to Redick in the corner. Instead of Redick benefiting from Embiid\u2019s presence on the floor, it was the other Sixers benefiting from the attention paid to Redick. \u201cI thought J.J.\u2019s run there really got us all out of kilter defensively,\u201d said Nets coach Kenny Atkinson. \u201cWhen a guy gets hot like that, guys start helping and cheating, and other guys get off too. That was a big part of the game when he got going.\u201d The Nets have been top-blocking Redick all series, trying to deny his perimeter catches and keep him from getting clean runs into dribble hand-offs. So Redick has had to find different paths to the ball. That has meant running on the inside of the handoffs or flaring to whatever open space he could find. Mapping routes to his catches in Game 3 would be a fun exercise. \u201cBen and I have an amazing thing,\u201d Redick said. \u201cIt\u2019s very organic. We don\u2019t really call plays. We just get into stuff. We talk about it in the huddle if we see something that a team is doing and we feel like we can exploit it. There were three or four plays tonight when we did that.\u201d Through the first two games, both teams had kept the opponents\u2019 best shooter in check. Entering Game 3, Redick had 22 points on 9-for-19 shooting (3-for-9 on 3-pointers). Joe Harris scored 17 points on 6-for-11 shooting, going 3-for-6 from beyond the arc. On Thursday, one of the shooters broke free. The other did not. While Harris scored eight points on 2-for-7 shooting (including 0-for-4 from 3-point range), Redick finished with 26 points on 7-for-17, draining 5-of-9 attempts from beyond the arc. His nine free throw attempts were one shy of a season high. \u201cHe\u2019s elite at getting open,\u201d Atkinson said. \u201cThey did a fantastic job of screening for him. That was big. We\u2019re chasing him, he\u2019s flying off, and they\u2019re setting great screens. We didn\u2019t do a good enough job staying attached. Same game plan. We didn\u2019t change it. Just didn\u2019t execute it at a high enough level.\u201d Only two of Redick\u2019s seven field goals came off a clean catch. A less-determined shooter would think that, with the way he was being guarded, it just wasn\u2019t his series to score. But Redick hasn\u2019t stopped moving, and he certainly didn\u2019t let Embiid\u2019s absence keep him from looking for the ball. In the regular season, Redick\u2019s shooting splits (FG%, 3PT%, eFG%) relative to Embiid were: The with-Embiid and in-games-Embiid-played numbers are so similar because \u2014 when health allowed \u2014 Embiid was on the floor for 86 percent of Redick\u2019s minutes. Sixers\u2019 coach Brett Brown staggers his starters\u2019 minutes in pairs, and he has typically kept Redick and Embiid together, because of how tough it is to guard their two-man game. Asked about his poor shooting with Embiid off the floor this season, Redick brushed it off. \u201cI believe in sample size,\u201d he said. \u201cSmall sample size this year.\u201d Not really. Redick took 360 shots (222 of them from 3-point range) with Embiid off the floor. But a professional shooter is trained to forget the last failure. And Redick knows that he\u2019s had success without Embiid in the past. \u201cI think the best basketball of my career,\u201d he said, \u201cwas probably last year when we went on the winning streak.\u201d Redick averaged 19.0 points on an effective field goal percentage of 59.9 percent over the Sixers\u2019 16-game winning streak to close the 2017-18 regular season. With Embiid missing the last eight games of that run, Redick averaged 22.4 on an effective field goal percentage of 64.5 percent. And over the course of last season, Redick shot better with Embiid off the floor than he did with Embiid off the floor. The number of shots he took with Embiid off the floor in \u201917-18? 371 . So sure, this year was a (slightly) small(er) sample size. The Sixers still need Embiid to compete with the best teams in the East. But with or without him, they have both the opportunity and the ability to take complete control of this series in Game 4 on Saturday (3 ET, TNT). * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

But he always seems to happen here. It\u2019s a spring tradition, the San Antonio Spurs in the NBA playoffs \u2014 22 straight seasons and counting \u2014 with a fresh-faced prospect from the incubator ready for a star turn. Tony Parker, Manu Ginobili and Kawhi Leonard all traveled this path at some point over the past two decades. In the absence of a future Hall of Famer or franchise icon to lean on, the Spurs have turned to their break-the-glass point guard. The second-year man starred against his hometown team on the biggest stage Thursday night at AT&T Center, making play after play to lead the Spurs to a 118-108 Game 3 victory against the Denver Nuggets. The seventh-seeded Spurs lead the series 2-1 thanks in large part to stellar work from the 29th pick of the 2017 Draft. \u201cHe was obviously spectacular on both ends of the floor,\u201d Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said of White, who shredded the Nuggets for a career-high 36 points (on 15-for-21 shooting), five rebounds, five assists, three steals and a block. \u201cI don\u2019t know what else to say.\u201d There\u2019s no need, Pop. White\u2019s actions did all the talking. After getting burned by Nuggets guard Jamal Murray\u2019s 21 points in the fourth quarter of a Game 2 loss in Denver, White countered with a virtuoso effort of his own. He had 26 points at halftime and flattened the Nuggets\u2019 defense with his dribble penetration to set the tone for a monster night. \u201cI felt like a lot of those were on me and I had to step up and make him work today,\u201d White said of his battle within the game against Murray. \u201cI was just trying to be aggressive and trying to get to the paint. I know a lot times they try to bluff and get back, so I just tried to finish strong when I was driving to the paint and make the right play.\u201d While Murray entered the league with all of the hype that accompanies a lottery pick from a blue blood program [Kentucky], White was a lightly recruited combo guard who started out at Division II Colorado-Colorado Springs. He finished his college days at the University of Colorado and caught the eye of the Spurs\u2019 scouting staff. The growth and development that ensued, including extended time in the NBA G League during his rookie season, is paying dividends now. White\u2019s 36 points were the most by a Spur in the playoffs since Leonard\u2019s 36 in April 2017. And he\u2019s the first Spur to finish with 35 or more points and five or more assists and rebounds in a playoff game since Parker did it in April of 2008. \u201cIt was awesome, especially defensively,\u201d said Spurs All-Star DeMar DeRozan, who burned the Nuggets for 25 points, five assists, four rebounds and three steals. \u201cHe took on a challenge from last game versus Murray, got us going and we fed off him. He led us offensively and defensively.\u201d From wicked open-court defense on Murray to a slick, no-look pocket pass to Jakob Poeltl for a layup to the presence of mind to know when to attack and when to facilitate, White played like someone who had been in the moment before. While these moments could overwhelm a 10-year veteran, none of it seemed to shake White. He was the best player on the floor in just his third playoff start. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t stop him,\u201d said Nuggets coach Mike Malone. \u201cI mean, they had 62 points in the paint. We gave up 16 blow-by, 1-on-1 containment, not game planning or anything. It was just the ability to guard 1-on-1, or the lack thereof. He was impressive. From jump street, he attacked, he got wherever he wanted and he finished. He was into us defensively. That was a hell of a performance from a young player.\u201d It was a performance that might not have been possible were it not for the torn ACL Dejounte Murray suffered in the preseason , prompting Popovich to experiment with White as his replacement. White doesn\u2019t get his chance to play hero otherwise. Well, that late Game 2 blitz from Murray certainly added some incentive to White\u2019s first playoff start before the Spurs faithful, who even showered him with a smattering of MVP chants late in the final minutes. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt in my mind that Derrick White the last couple of days has been reminded about Jamal Murray\u2019s fourth-quarter performance,\u201d Malone said. \u201cDerrick White came out like he hadn\u2019t eaten in two days. He came out hungry, he came out pissed off and he sent a very loud and clear message. \u201cNow I\u2019m anxious to see our guys. How do we respond to that? Where is your pride? Where is your toughness? Where is your grit? So Game 4 is going to be really like a great insight into who we are as a team, especially our young players, especially Jamal Murray.\u201d White refused to play up the potential duel with Murray for Saturday\u2019s Game 4 . But he was caught up in the swirl of emotions Thursday night, pointing to his bicep and engaging the crowd. \u201cI mean, every now and then I get like that,\u201d the soft-spoken White said. \u201cIt\u2019s not really my thing. But just the emotion of the game \u2026 I think I just had a chip on my shoulder. This is the way I\u2019ve played since I was young. And I was just trying to go out there and compete and have fun. \u201cA lot of things have gone crazy. I am extremely blessed to be in this situation. I am not taking anything for granted, but just trying to stay in the moment.\u201d * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.
