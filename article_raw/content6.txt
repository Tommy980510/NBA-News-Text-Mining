Let\u2019s dig in and take a closer look at these must-watch matchups. Golden State Warriors at Brooklyn Nets (7 ET, TNT) Kevin Durant is set to play his first NBA game in 18 months and make his debut with the Brooklyn Nets when he faces his former team in the opening game of the 2020-21 NBA season. Durant\u2019s run as a Golden State Warrior ended in Game 5 of the 2019 NBA Finals as he suffered a torn Achilles\u2019 tendon that not only derailed Golden State\u2019s hopes for a three-peat (the Raptors would clinch the series in six games), but also cost Durant the entire 2019-20 season as he rehabilitated one of the most devastating injuries for a basketball player. Durant is one of the most potent scorers the game has ever seen \u2013 he ranks sixth all-time with a 27.02 career scoring average \u2013 but admits he\u2019s unsure of what to expect in his first game action after a year-and-a-half. \u201cWho knows?\u201d he told the media on Tuesday . \u201cI\u2019ve just got to see how I feel in a real NBA game again.\u201d This game will also mark the debut of the Durant\/Kyrie Irving partnership as the two signed with Brooklyn as free agents prior to last season but knew it would be a full year before they could be on the court together. It will also mark the head coaching debut of Steve Nash, who worked as a consultant the Warriors in the past, but now will be opposite Steve Kerr on the sidelines. For the Warriors, they have not played since the season was suspended the night of March 11 due to the coronavirus pandemic. With Klay Thompson out for the full season and Stephen Curry playing only five games, the Warriors\u2019 streak of five straight Finals appearances and seven straight playoff appearances came to a halt as they finished the year at 15-50. Golden State selected James Wiseman with the No. 2 pick in the 2020 Draft, but on the same day learned that Thompson had suffered a torn Achilles\u2019 that would cost him a second straight season. LA Clippers at Los Angeles Lakers (10 ET, TNT) The Los Angeles Lakers were crowned 2019-20 NBA champions on October 11 \u2026 and will begin their title defense just 72 days later in a matchup against their intra-city rivals. The Lakers\u2019 17 th championship tied them with the Boston Celtics for the most in NBA history, and they take their first step to try to break that tie against the Clippers on Dec. 22. The Lakers will open with a number of new faces: Dennis Schroder (traded from Oklahoma City), Marc Gasol (signed from Toronto), Wes Matthews (signed from Milwaukee) and reigning Kia NBA Sixth Man Montrezl Harrell (signed from the Clippers). Harrell\u2019s decision to move down the Staples Center hall to join the Lakers adds another layer to an already fun rivalry. The Clippers added Serge Ibaka from Toronto to join former teammate Kawhi Leonard (they won the 2019 title together with the Raptors) and Paul George as the core pieces for the Clippers, who will be led by new head coach Tyronn Lue; the Clippers and Doc Rivers parted ways after seven seasons. The Clippers and Lakers split their season series last season and will open the campaign against one another for the second straight year. Milwaukee Bucks at Boston Celtics (7:30 ET, TNT) The Milwaukee Bucks have finished atop the Eastern Conference standings in each of the past two seasons, but have not been able to match their regular-season success in the playoffs. Last season, the No. 1 seed Bucks and No. 3 seed Celtics each saw their seasons end at the hands of the No. 5 Miami Heat. Yet both the Bucks and Celtics enter the 2020-21 season among the top contenders in the East. The Bucks will be led by the reigning back-to-back Kia NBA Most Valuable Player Giannis Antetokounmpo. Only three players in NBA history have ever won three consecutive MVPs \u2013 Bill Russell (1960-61 to 1962-63), Wilt Chamberlain (1965-66 to 1967-68) and Larry Bird (1983-84 to 1985-86). Can Giannis become the fourth? The Bucks shook up their roster a bit to add Jrue Holiday from the New Orleans Pelicans. The one-time All-Star and two-time All-Defensive Team selection is expected to bolster the Bucks lineup and give Milwaukee a big three of Giannis, Khris Middleton and Holiday to lead them this season. The Celtics will be counting on the continued development of young stars Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown to lead them this season, especially early on \u2014 Kemba Walker is expected to be out until January following a knee procedure that addressed an injury that hampered him last season. Gordon Hayward left in free agency, but Boston added veterans Tristan Thompson (signed from Cleveland) and Jeff Teague (signed from Atlanta) to add depth to their lineup. Dallas Mavericks at Phoenix Suns (10:30 ET, ESPN) What does Luka Doncic have in store for his third season in the NBA? Doncic made a huge leap in his sophomore season, earning All-NBA First Team honors as he averaged 28.8 points (6 th in NBA), 9.4 rebounds (17 th ), 8.8 assists (3 rd ), racking up a league-high 17 triple-doubles over 61 games. Doncic became the first player to earn All-NBA First Team honors in either his first or second season since Tim Duncan in 1998-99. The Mavs will be without fellow All-Star Kristaps Porzingis as he continues to recover from offseason knee surgery. Dallas did add Josh Richardson (from Philadelphia) and James Johnson (from Minnesota via OKC) in trades to help bolster their lineup. The Suns were the story of the NBA restart as they went a perfect 8-0 in the bubble, but finished just a half-game back of qualifying for the play-in game for the final playoff berth. Coming off that progress, they made a big play in bringing Chris Paul to the Valley. With young stars like Devin Booker and Deandre Ayton continuing to develop under Paul\u2019s steadying presence, the Suns will look to build on their success from the bubble as they open the 2020-21 season with an eye on playoff contention. New Orleans Pelicans at Miami Heat (Noon ET, ESPN) The five-game slate of Christmas Day games begins in Miami where the defending Eastern Conference champion Heat open their season by hosting the New Orleans Pelicans. The Heat are coming off a remarkable run to the NBA Finals in October, even as their title hopes were dampened by injuries suffered by starters Goran Dragic and Bam Adebayo. Behind Big Face Coffee owner Jimmy Butler and young stars like Tyler Herro and Duncan Robinson, the Heat took two games off the Lakers but were unable win the franchise\u2019s fourth title. The Heat will look to run it back as they re-signed Dragic, and added veterans Avery Bradley and Maurice Harkless to offset the losses of Jae Crowder, Solomon Hill and Derrick Jones Jr. They face an up-and-coming Pelicans squad led by the duo of Brandon Ingram and last year\u2019s No. 1 overall pick Zion Williamson. The Pelicans re-signed Ingram to a max deal in the offseason and Williamson is set to begin his second season healthy after missing the first half of his rookie campaign due to a knee injury. Joining the young duo will be a pair of veterans acquired via trade: Eric Bledsoe (from the Bucks) and Steven Adams (from the Thunder). Golden State Warriors at Milwaukee Bucks (2:30 ET, ABC) The Warriors open the season with a pair of road games against two of the top teams in the Eastern Conference as they follow their season-opener in Brooklyn with a Christmas Day meeting in Milwaukee. Both teams will be fun to watch early on, mainly to see how their new pieces fit in with their established stars. After adding Andrew Wiggins last season, the Warriors acquired Kelly Oubre Jr. from the Thunder in the offseason to help offset the loss to Klay Thompson to his second-straight season-ending injury. Throw in rookie James Wiseman and you get an interesting chemistry experiment for Steve Kerr and veterans Stephen Curry and Draymond Green to solve. The Bucks moved a lot of pieces for a team that finished atop the regular standings in each of the past two seasons. In addition to acquiring Jrue Holiday, the Bucks signed free agents Torrey Craig, D.J. Augustin, Bobby Portis and Bryn Forbes to complement All-Stars Giannis Antetokounmpo and Khris Middleton. Brooklyn Nets at Boston Celtics (5 ET, ABC) If you\u2019re looking for a battle of dynamic duos, how about Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown against Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving? Throw in Irving facing his former team in Boston for an extra layer of intrigue in this matchup of Eastern Conference contenders. Tatum was named to the All-NBA Third Team in 2019-20 as he continued his steady climb into NBA stardom in his third season. He averaged career-highs across the board \u2014 23.4 pts, 7.0 reb, 3.0 ast, 1.4 stl, 0.9 blk, 2.9 3PM, 40.3 3P% \u2014 and was rewarded with a max contract extension by the Celtics. Irving was limited to 20 games during his first season in Brooklyn as both he and Durant look to make a strong and healthy start to the 2020-21 campaign. Irving did average a career-best 27.4 points in those 20 games to go with 6.4 assists (the second-highest average of his career). Irving finding his balance between scorer and playmaker while playing alongside Durant will be fascinating to watch. Dallas Mavericks at Los Angeles Lakers (8 ET, ABC\/ESPN) LeBron vs. Luka. It\u2019s a matchup that sets one of the game\u2019s all-time greats \u2014 who continues to defy Father Time as he enters his 18 th season \u2014 against a young phenom that has taken the league by storm and will be one of the faces of the NBA for the next decade or more. Both were members of the 2019-20 All-NBA First Team. For LeBron, it was a record 13 th First Team Selection and 16 th overall (also a record). For Luka, it was his first; he became the third-youngest player to earn First Team honors. One of the two players he\u2019s trailing? LeBron James. Youngest Players to Earn All-NBA First Team Honors Doncic led the NBA in triple-doubles last season with 17, with LeBron tied for second with 13. LeBron ranks fifth on the all-time triple-double list with 94; Luka already has 25 as he enters this third NBA season. The Lakers won the 2019-20 season series, 3-1, as LeBron averaged a triple-double (28.0 pts, 11.0 ast, 10.8 reb) against the Mavericks. LA Clippers at Denver Nuggets (10:30 ET, ESPN) Christmas Day is capped off with a rematch of last year\u2019s Western Conference semifinal series that saw the Denver Nuggets overcome a 3-1 deficit as they rallied to eliminate the Clippers in seven games to advance to the Western Conference finals. This is our first national TV look at the Nuggets, who are led by the one-two punch of Jamal Murray and Nikola Jokic. There were 13 40-plus point performances during the 2019 NBA Playoffs \u2014 Murray had a league-high four of them. Murray showed off all aspects of his offensive arsenal during the postseason: he shot from distance, drove to the hoop for acrobatic and crafty finishes and had his pull-up and floaters working as he frustrated opposing defenders on a nightly basis. Meanwhile, Jokic one of the game\u2019s best passers and playmakers, a 7-footer who made a second-straight All-NBA showing. The Clippers have a formidable duo of their own in Kawhi Leonard and Paul George, who are looking to bounce back from last season\u2019s disappointing end in their debut season as teammates. A good first step would be knocking off the team that knocked them out of the postseason back in September."},{"id":432244,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/hawks-look-for-big-step-forward-behind-bogdanovic-gallinari","date":"2020-12-03","title":"Hawks look for big step forward behind Bogdanovic, Gallinari","content":"ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 Bogdan Bogdanovic is tired of losing. In what seems a rather strange twist, he believes the Atlanta Hawks can make him a winner. \u201cThis is a perfect group for success,\u201d Bogdanovic said Wednesday. \u201cI can see only a bright future here.\u201d The sharp-shooting guard was the prize of Atlanta\u2019s hefty free-agent class, which also included Danilo Gallinari, Rajon Rondo and Kris Dunn. They\u2019re joining one of the league\u2019s most intriguing teams, a franchise that has gone through a complete overhaul the last three seasons but now feels it is poised for major success. Gallinari was thrilled when the Hawks made a big pitch for him, even accepting an expected role coming off the bench after starting most of his career. \u201cThe young guys we\u2019ve got are very, very good,\u201d said Gallinari, who agreed to a three-year, $61 million deal. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t believe in these young guys, I wouldn\u2019t have picked the A-T-L. I really believe in the group that we\u2019ve got. My focus since I\u2019ve been playing basketball is winning. Whatever the coach wants me to do and needs me to do win, that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do.\u201d Bogdanovic is certainly eager to win after spending the last three seasons with the Sacramento Kings, who haven\u2019t finished above .500 or made the playoffs since 2006. When the Kings signaled that they didn\u2019t plan any major additions, Bogdanovic was ready to move on. The Hawks signed the restricted free agent to a four-year, $72 million offer sheet, which Sacramento declined to match. Bogdanovic feels like he\u2019s a perfect fit for an Atlanta backcourt led by the face of the franchise, point guard Trae Young, who averaged 29.6 points and was voted an All-Star Game starter in just his second season. The Hawks are looking for someone to take a bit of the load off Young, perhaps by handling some of the playmaking duties and creating easier chances for the budding superstar. Likewise, a 3-point weapon such as Bogdanovic should provide Young with a lot more options. \u201cWe\u2019re going to mesh perfectly, especially offensively,\u201d predicted Bogdanovic, who averaged a career-best 15.1 points a game last season while shooting 37% from beyond the arc. \u201cHe\u2019s an unbelievable shooter and I\u2019m an unbelievable shooter. We can both handle the ball. He\u2019s a little bit better at driving the ball into the paint, which is going to get us a lot of open shots. \u201cI think teams are really going to be in trouble trying to guard us together.\u201d While the Hawks are hopeful the 28-year-old is just entering the prime, Gallinari is a little further along in his career and willing to take on a bit of a different role. Atlanta valued the 6-foot-10 player not just for his versatile abilities \u2014 he averaged 18.7 points for Oklahoma City last season and can play both forward positions as well as shooting guard \u2014 but his willingness to work with young players such as John Collins, De\u2019Andre Hunter, Cam Reddish and Kevin Huerter. Rondo is likely to fill a similar role with Young, not only providing valuable point guard minutes off the bench but serving as his mentor. \u201cWhen you\u2019re a veteran and speak to a lot of these young players, teach them a lot of things, it\u2019s amazing to me the way they\u2019re able to translate that to the court,\u201d the 32-year-old Gallinari said. \u201cIf they listen and do what you say, they\u2019re going to get better game by game.\u201d Hunter, the Hawks\u2019 top draft pick in 2019, is thrilled to have a player such as Gallinari pushing him to improve \u2014 even if it possibly means less time on the court. \u201cThat\u2019s how you get better: competing with guys,\u201d Hunter said. \u201cThe playing time will work itself out. You can\u2019t worry about that. Just come in and do what you\u2019re supposed to do. It\u2019s in the coach\u2019s hands after that.\u201d The Hawks haven\u2019t been to the playoffs since 2017, two seasons removed from their surprising run to the Eastern Conference final. Gallinari believes this team is capable of something special, as well. \u201cThe only goal is to take this team to the postseason,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd not just to get there. We need to do some damage when we get to the postseason.\u201d"},{"id":432214,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-pistons-reach-deal-with-liangelo-ball","date":"2020-12-03","title":"Report: Pistons reach deal with LiAngelo Ball","content":"DETROIT (AP) \u2014 The Detroit Pistons have agreed to a non-guaranteed deal with LiAngelo Ball, according to a person with knowledge of the agreement.

LiAngelo Ball spent some time working out for the G League\u2019s Oklahoma City Blue this year. Shams Charania of The Athletic and Stadium first reported the deal with the Pistons. LiAngelo Ball started the 2017-18 college season with UCLA, but he was involved in a shoplifting scandal during a team trip to China. UCLA suspended him, and he ended up leaving school.

The Wizards shipped a future lottery-protected first round pick to the Rockets on Wednesday night. ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski was first with the news, later noting that the deal came together \u201cin a matter of hours.\u201d Shams Charania of The Athletics clarified the pick would be a protected 2023 first. \u201cHaving the opportunity to acquire a player of Russell\u2019s caliber and character was something that we could not pass up when looking at both the immediate and long-term future of our team,\u201d Wizards general manager Tommy Sheppard said in a release. \u201cWith that said, the decision to part ways with John, one of the greatest players in franchise history, was extremely difficult. What he has meant to our organization and our community is immeasurable and will not be forgotten.\u201d While Wall has played his entire professional career in the nation\u2019s capital, the move ends Westbrook\u2019s tenure in Houston after just one disappointing season. He arrived from Oklahoma City in July 2019 for Chris Paul and draft picks. The Rockets had hoped that the 32-year-old Westbrook would be the final piece they needed to win their first title since winning back-to-back championships in 1994-95. But instead, Houston was eliminated from the playoffs by the eventual champion Los Angeles Lakers in the Western semifinals. Westbrook was the 2017 NBA MVP and is a nine-time All-Star, but has failed to win a title. Many questioned whether the pairing of two ball-dominant guards like Westbrook and James Harden would work in Houston, but the longtime friends insisted that it would. After the Rockets were sent home from the playoffs early again, rumors started to swirl that the two weren\u2019t happy in Houston and both wanted out. But after spending years building their entire team around Harden, who won MVP honors in 2018, the Rockets weren\u2019t interested in parting with him. This move could be new general manager Rafael Stone\u2019s way of appeasing Harden so the Rockets can continue their quest for a title this season instead of rebuilding without the superstar. Stone was promoted to GM last month after Daryl Morey stepped down before quickly taking a job with the Philadelphia 76ers. The Westbrook-Wall deal works under the NBA\u2019s rules because the two players are owed about the same amount: Each gets more than $80 million over the next two seasons, plus each has a player option of more than $45 million for 2022-23. And both were looking to move on.  Wall, the No. 1 overall pick out of Kentucky in the 2010 draft, became the face of the franchise for Washington, a five-time All-Star who repeatedly helped get his team to the playoffs. But Wall\u2019s Wizards never reached 50 wins in a season or made it past the conference semifinals. Wall, who is 30, has averaged 19 points and 9.2 assists for his career. He has been troubled by injuries of late, appearing in only 41 games in 2017-18 because of left knee surgery, then just 32 in 2018-19 because of a left heel problem that required an operation. While recovering from that, Wall tore his left Achilles tendon and sat out all of last season. Yet he remained heavily involved in the D.C. community, most recently providing significant rent relief for Ward 8 residents. After a report surfaced that Wall wanted out of Washington, Sheppard said on Nov. 23 that Wall \u201cdidn\u2019t request\u201d to be moved when they spoke that morning. \u201cThere\u2019s no plans to trade John,\u201d Sheppard said during a video conference with reporters that day. He said he and Wall speak \u201cpretty much every other day\u201d and characterized their relationship as \u201cvery, very close.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no issues with John and I,\u201d Sheppard said then. \u201cThere\u2019s no issues with John and the Wizards.\u201d But he also reaffirmed that his plan is to build around shooting guard Bradley Beal, whose scoring average of 30.5 points last season was second in the league behind Harden. After a stretch of getting to the postseason four times in five years, Washington has missed the playoffs each of the past two seasons, losing 47 games last season and 50 the season before. Hall of Famer Magic Johnson believes the pairing of Beal and Westbrook will be what the Wizards need to be a contender in the Eastern Conference. \u201cEveryone now has to watch out for the Wizards! They traded for Russell Westbrook today,\u201d Johnson tweeted. \u201c(Westbrook)\/(Beal)\u2069 will terrorize the East and make the Wizards a playoff team.\u201d Wall was beloved in Washington and team owner Ted Leonsis lauded the player and his contributions to the team and city in a series of tweets Wednesday night. \u201cHe has been a great, all-star caliber player and a fantastic citizen and leader in our community,\u201d Leonsis wrote. \u201cI am proud of how hard John has worked to come back to the league after two years away from competing. Our fans, our franchise and I will miss him very much.\u201d AP Sports Writer Howard Fendrich in Washington contributed to this report.

There were also injuries, along with concerns about his weight and conditioning that led to a protracted rehabilitation from arthroscopic knee surgery just before the start of the season \u2013 and minute restrictions after he made his long-awaited debut in the 44th game of the 2019-20 regular season. Still, the 6-foot-6, 284-pound Williamson made impressions with both his consistent production and more than a few highlight-reel finishes at the rim. In 24 games, he averaged 22.5 points and 6.3 rebounds per game on 58% shooting. \u201cLast year, so much happened and I feel like it all happened at once, and there were so many directions I had to look, and things I had to do, that I couldn\u2019t live in the moment,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cBut I think this year I have a better understanding of it and will be living in the moment. Because I feel like when I live in the moment, I can cherish it a lot more, and that allows me to have fun and be who I am.\u201d Williamson said he now feels \u201cgreat\u201d physically after working out primarily under the direction of his stepfather this offseason and does not expect to be under any restrictions. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to that very much,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cNo player wants restrictions. I\u2019m hoping Year 2 is going to be lot different.\u201d It will certainly be that. For one, he\u2019ll have a new coach in Stan Van Gundy, hired to fill the vacancy created when the Pelicans fired Alvin Gentry. Williamson said he has spoken with Van Gundy and has gotten a \u201cgreat\u201d impression of him. Williamson even compared him to his coach at Duke, Mike Krzyzewski. \u201cHe\u2019s a great guy. He\u2019s old school just like my stepfather and just like coach K.

Meanwhile, Williamson and another former Duke star, Brandon Ingram, are in position comprise the nucleus of the Pelicans for the next half decade or so. Ingram, a first-time All-Star last season who also was named the NBA\u2019s Most Improved Player, recently signed a five-year extension worth about $158 million. \u201cI\u2019m glad he\u2019s going to stick around,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cMe and him have a great relationship and honestly we\u2019re just excited to make some moves and try to win.\u201d When the subject turned to the nature of his offseason workouts or elements of his game on which he worked hardest to develop, Williamson largely deflected, saying, \u201cI can\u2019t go into too much detail because I just don\u2019t like doing that.\u201d Apologetically, he said he\u2019s keeping public comments about his goals vague. \u201cThe part I\u2019m looking forward to is showing the world me \u2014 just being myself and going out there and having fun and showing my competitive nature and trying to win,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cI just want to show the world my love, passion and my competitive spirit.\u201d"},{"id":432008,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/kemba-walker-says-stem-cells-calmed-my-knee-down-a-lot","date":"2020-12-02","title":"Kemba Walker says stem cells 'calmed my knee down a lot'","content":"BOSTON (AP) \u2014 Boston Celtics point guard Kemba Walker said Wednesday that his left knee has responded well to a stem cell injection that is expected to keep him out until at least January. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely calmed my knee down a lot,\u201d Walker told reporters in a teleconference from the team\u2019s training camp. \u201cFeeling really good right now.

Sure, he knows he\u2019s in his mid-30s and time isn\u2019t going backward. Yes, he\u2019s ready to pair with Devin Booker, who just turned 24 and is one of the game\u2019s top young scorers. And certainly, after 15 years, 1,020 regular-season games and 109 postseason games, he\u2019s learned a few things along the way. But just because he\u2019s got a Ph.D. in NBA basketball doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s coming to the desert to be a professor. \u201cI\u2019m not James Naismith by no means,\u201d Paul said grinning. \u201cIt\u2019s fun for me. First things first, I\u2019m not just coming here to teach everybody. I\u2019m (Booker\u2019s) teammate. We\u2019re here to hoop, we\u2019re here to compete and that\u2019s the way I approach this.\u201d Paul, 35, showed he can still play at a high level last season in Oklahoma City, making his 10th All-Star team while averaging 17.6 points and 6.7 assists per game. He\u2019ll be surrounded by Booker, who made his first All-Star game last season, and Deandre Ayton, a talented 7-footer who was the No. 1 overall pick in the draft in 2018. Now they\u2019ll team with Paul, who knows he has a reputation as a demanding teammate. He said his leadership style has evolved over the years, but he\u2019s still just as driven to win as ever. \u201cI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s always right, I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s for everybody,\u201d Paul said. \u201cBut I\u2019ll never ask you to do something that I wouldn\u2019t do myself.\u201d The Suns haven\u2019t made the playoffs since 2010 but are coming off an encouraging season. They finished 34-39 after going 8-0 in the NBA\u2019s restart bubble in Florida and narrowly missed a spot in the postseason. GM James Jones still felt the Suns needed another star player to continue their rise and made one of the biggest moves of the offseason when he acquired Paul and Abdel Nader from the Thunder while sending Ricky Rubio, Kelly Oubre Jr., Ty Jerome and Jalen Lecque to Oklahoma City. Rubio and Oubre were two big pieces in the Suns\u2019 rise last season, and coach Monty Williams praised them both, but said adding a future Hall of Fame-caliber point guard was too good of an opportunity to pass up. \u201cWe added a first-ballot Hall of Fame point guard to our team,\u201d Williams said. \u201cObviously, that comes with a bit of sacrifice, but we felt like it was one that was worth the risk. We felt like there wasn\u2019t much negative risk.\u201d Paul and Williams reunite nearly 10 years after the two were together in New Orleans. Back then, Paul was a rising young star and Williams was a rookie head coach. They finished 46-36 in 2011 and lost in the first round of the playoffs before Paul was traded to the Los Angeles Clippers. \u201cIt was one of the most special years that I remember,\u201d Paul said. \u201cI think we lost every preseason game and then started the season like 11-1 because it\u2019s all about principles and building.\u201d Now the two get to build something together in Phoenix, which hasn\u2019t been a true threat in the Western Conference since guys like Amar\u2019e Stoudemire, Steve Nash and Grant Hill were on the floor. Paul thrived in a similar role with Oklahoma City last season. Not much was expected of the inexperienced Thunder, but they finished with a 44-28 record and pushed the Houston Rockets to seven games in the first round of the playoffs. Paul said having a young team is sometimes a good thing because it\u2019s a clean slate. \u201cThe biggest thing I learned last year is you can write your own story,\u201d Paul said. \u201cI think that was the big thing our team did. We didn\u2019t care \u2014 no offense to any of y\u2019all \u2014 we didn\u2019t care about your predictions or what your expectations are. You aren\u2019t in the locker room with us.

He is certain of this much: It won\u2019t be the most challenging of his career. Go back to 30 years ago, when the Raptors coach and reigning NBA coach of the year was in England leading the Derby Rams. His team could afford to rent a court to hold practices on Tuesdays and Fridays. And the Rams couldn\u2019t get on the floor until exactly 7 p.m., because badminton nights never ended early. \u201cLiterally, it\u2019d click 7 o\u2019clock, and they\u2019d take the nets down and we\u2019d come onto the floor,\u201d Nurse said. It wasn\u2019t perfect, but Nurse made it work. To the best of everyone\u2019s knowledge, there is no badminton club in Tampa, Florida that will be needing to share a venue with the Raptors this season. Toronto will open the season playing \u201chome\u201d games at Amalie Arena, home of the Stanley Cup champion Tampa Bay Lightning, and the plan is for the Raptors to practice inside a ballroom at a nearby hotel when they\u2019re in Tampa. The combination of Nurse\u2019s somewhat nomadic coaching life and the fact that the Raptors just went through a most nontraditional existence in the NBA\u2019s restart bubble at Walt Disney World earlier this year have him convinced that this season\u2019s setup, while not ideal, will work as well. \u201cThere\u2019s been some other doozies in there,\u201d Nurse said as he thought back some of the other practice setups over a career that has seen him coach in England, Belgium, the United States Basketball League and the NBA Development League before it was called the G League. \u201cBut I always say, just get me to a practice floor, to the games and we\u2019ll be happy.\u201d The Raptors are spending this week getting settled in the Tampa area, holding training camp through Dec. 11 at Saint Leo University, about a half-hour drive north of where the 2019 NBA champions will be playing their home games. Nurse said he\u2019s getting settled into his new routine of hotel living. Players and staff are getting used to what will be the new normal, at least for a few months. General manager Bobby Webster is looking for a good place to get a cup of coffee. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge strain on us as an organization,\u201d Webster said. \u201cBut when faced with different challenges or obstacles we thrive and we like it. So, we\u2019re looking at it much more as a really unique experience for our team, for our staff. Most of us came from Disney where we had a similar situation, so it\u2019s not altogether foreign for us.\u201d The Raptors are slotted to play just one home preseason game, that being Dec. 18 against Miami. Their schedule to start the regular season should be finalized in the coming days; the final drafts are being worked through now. They are in Tampa because of the coronavirus pandemic and how it forced the closure of the U.S.-Canada border to non-essential travel. The Raptors tried to find ways to get government clearance around that, but for many reasons \u2014 numbers spiking in both countries being among them \u2014 a solution to play games in Toronto wasn\u2019t possible. \u201cI can only say this: I know I\u2019d rather be in Toronto, but I\u2019m not,\u201d Nurse said. \u201cAnd now I\u2019m going to make the best of it here. I\u2019m not going to make any excuses and I\u2019m going to get to work and we\u2019re going to expect to play at a super-high level. And that\u2019s it. There\u2019s a lot of things surrounding what\u2019s happening and we\u2019re going to do our best to focus in on just becoming the best basketball team we can become.

James\u2019 agency, Klutch Sports, confirmed the deal Wednesday and the Lakers announced it as official on Thursday during the first week of training camp for the NBA champions. The Lakers also finalized their new contract with Anthony Davis, who is also represented by Klutch CEO Rich Paul. \u201cLeBron James is a transcendent basketball player, and human being,\u201d said Lakers general manager Rob Pelinka. \u201cLeBron put his trust in the Lakers in 2018, and now this contract extension paves the way for LeBron to further solidify his legacy as an all-time Lakers great. We could not be more honored by this commitment.\u201d The Los Angeles Times reported James\u2019 extension is a two-year, $85 million deal through the 2022-23 season. The four-time NBA champion is getting the maximum deal to extend his tenure in Los Angeles, where he moved two seasons ago after his second stint with his hometown Cavaliers. James\u2019 previous contract ran only through the upcoming season with a player option for 2021-22, allowing the third-leading scorer in league history to become a free agent next summer if he chose. Instead, James reportedly committed to play through his 20th NBA season with the Lakers, where he moved in 2018 after title-winning tenures in Cleveland and Miami. James turns 36 years old in four weeks, but the 16-time All-Star\u2019s level of play hasn\u2019t dipped even slightly after 17 seasons in the league. Davis and James teamed up last season to win the franchise\u2019s 17th championship in the bubble in central Florida. James averaged 25.3 points and led the NBA with 10.2 assists per game last season before winning the NBA Finals MVP award while beating the Miami Heat in a six-game series. The Lakers are returning this winter with a roster that looks even better than last season\u2019s group on paper, with veterans Dennis Schr\u00f6der, Montrezl Harrell, Marc Gasol and Wesley Matthews joining the rotation around James and Davis. Under the terms reported by the Times, James will make more than $39 million this season, more than $41 million next season and more than $44 million in the final year of his new deal, during which he will turn 39 years old. The Lakers have a history of rewarding superstars in their later seasons, allowing them to finish with the franchise rather than forcing Lakers icons to make difficult decisions about how they will wrap up their careers. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, James Worthy, Magic Johnson, Elgin Baylor, Jerry West and Kobe Bryant all finished their Hall of Fame careers with the Lakers rather than making a late money-grabbing pit stop with another franchise. Los Angeles famously gave a two-year, $48.5 million extension to Bryant when he was 35 years old in November 2013. The deal was criticized at the time for its largesse compared to Bryant\u2019s diminishing dominance, but owners Jeanie and Jim Buss felt the contract was an appropriate reward for Bryant\u2019s contributions to the franchise. The new deal for James currently carries none of those concerns, since he is still a matchless player even after spending half of his life in the NBA. James has career averages of 27.1 points, 7.4 rebounds and 7.4 assists over his 17 seasons, and he stayed close to those marks in points and rebounds last season despite becoming a 6-foot-9 point guard who won his first NBA assists title. James and his family already appeared to be comfortable with a long-term future in Los Angeles. James is increasingly involved in media production in Hollywood, while his oldest son, Bronny, is on track to graduate from private Sierra Canyon School in Chatsworth in 2023. Davis is all but certain to re-sign with the Lakers this week, and the delay is widely interpreted as part of talks between Davis and the Lakers about the best way to keep the team in championship contention over the next few seasons. For instance, Davis could structure his deal to allow Los Angeles to pursue a third superstar in free agency next summer. James\u2019 agreement on an extension guarantees Davis will have an invaluable teammate for at least the next three seasons if Davis chooses to stay that long. James made remarkable alterations in his game last season to become a playmaker running the Lakers\u2019 offense and clearing space for Davis to excel."},{"id":431482,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/gregg-popovich-knows-filling-us-olympic-roster-may-be-a-challenge","date":"2020-12-02","title":"Gregg Popovich knows filling US Olympic roster may be a challenge","content":"(AP) \u2014 Game 7 of the 2021 NBA Finals, as of now, would be played on July 22. The opening ceremony of the Tokyo Olympics, as of now, would be the next day. And when presented with this potential scheduling conundrum, San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich \u2014 who will coach USA Basketball men\u2019s national team at the next Olympics \u2014 came up with a very quick, very lighthearted solution. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to let the finals go seven games,\u201d Popovich said. All jokes aside, Popovich knows that the NBA schedule and how it comes very close to the start of the rescheduled Tokyo Games will be a challenge for USA Basketball to navigate next year when choosing the 12 players who will try to win a fourth consecutive men\u2019s Olympic gold medal. Popovich will be head coach of the Olympic team for the first time, succeeding Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski. \u201cThe Olympics is always on my mind, just as Coach K told me it would be,\u201d Popovich said Tuesday. \u201cYou can\u2019t get away from it. So, this scenario, as it stands right now, does seem problematic in the sense that organizing things and figuring out who\u2019s going to be part of the team is yet to be determined.\u201d There is a plan. As with everything else in a coronavirus world, it\u2019s tentative, but there is a plan. The pool of finalists \u2014 if past form holds, it\u2019ll be around 40 or 50 names \u2014 will be revealed by USA Basketball sometime in early 2021, the first step in what the Americans hope is a somewhat normal sequence of events leading up to the Tokyo Games. The 2016 Olympic team was picked about six weeks before the start of the Rio Games, allowing time for a training camp and exhibitions before heading to Brazil. If the same timetable holds next year \u2014 and assuming the NBA schedule isn\u2019t changed along the way \u2014 the U.S. Olympic team could be picked in mid-to-late June, around the end of the second round of the NBA playoffs. \u201cWe know there\u2019s so many variables,\u201d said Sean Ford, USA Basketball\u2019s men\u2019s national team director. \u201cWe\u2019re going to talk to all the organizations that we can, to try to find a pathway to include as many NBA players in our final roster as possible.\u201d Plenty of elite NBA players like LeBron James, Stephen Curry, Draymond Green, Devin Booker, James Harden and more all said entering last season that they were interested in playing in the Tokyo Games. That, of course, was months before the coronavirus struck and changed so much. The complexities aren\u2019t just limited to U.S. players. Many international players \u2014 like Milwaukee\u2019s two-time MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo of Greece and Denver\u2019s Nikola Jokic of Serbia \u2014 have said they would like to play, but their nations need to still qualify next summer just to get to Tokyo and those qualifying rounds will take place during the NBA playoffs. Toronto coach Nick Nurse is slated to coach Canada in its efforts to qualify; he, too, may face a schedule conflict if the Raptors go deep into the playoffs again. Popovich sounded confident that the U.S. is more than capable of figuring things out. \u201cThe timing does make everything difficult,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cAnd it will demand some real soul-searching and out-of-the-box type of thinking to put together the best team we possibly can.\u201d"},{"id":431116,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/spurs-ready-to-move-into-new-era-with-talented-group-of-youngsters","date":"2020-12-02","title":"Spurs ready to move into new era with talented group of youngsters","content":"From the Twin Towers era of David Robinson and Tim Duncan, San Antonio shifted to Manu Ginobili and Tony Parker, and morphed into the Beautiful Game Spurs along the way. They captured five titles and maintained the longest postseason streak (22 years) in pro sports, before finishing last season out of the playoffs for the first time since 1997. Yet bursting from the NBA bubble in Orlando might just be the newest iteration of the San Antonio Spurs, if you ask coach Gregg Popovich. He\u2019s certainly ready to see it all take shape. \u201cThe strategy, the philosophy, the way we play is gonna stay the same [as in Orlando], and everybody\u2019s going to have to adjust to that because the guys did a great job,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cThey enjoyed it. We changed our approach as far as practice was concerned, how we wanted to teach. The young players really took time to understand what we were doing.\u201d Most importantly, San Antonio won games, simultaneously mocking up the blueprint for the way the team wants to play for 2020-21 and perhaps beyond. If you go back to when the NBA tipped off its restart on July 30, the Spurs ranked 12 th in the Western Conference with San Antonio stressing a focus on development and maintaining the momentum behind causes for racial and social justice as they touched down in Orlando missing three starters in Bryn Forbes (quadriceps), Trey Lyles (appendectomy) and second-leading scorer LaMarcus Aldridge (shoulder). Popovich also made the decision to sit Patty Mills, the club\u2019s longest-tenured player, to preserve him for the future while developing the youngsters. That led to San Antonio tipping off the bubble experiment with a four-guard starting lineup of DeMar DeRozan, Dejounte Murray, Derrick White and Lonnie Walker IV to play off center Jakob Poeltl. That small-ball lineup fueled an up-tempo offensive style and a swarming, pestering defense that often turned into offense, as the Spurs won five of their first seven seeding games, before falling to Utah in a meaningless finale with their record postseason run already snapped. Through those eight games in Orlando, promising young contributors emerged in Keldon Johnson, Quinndary Weatherspoon and Drew Eubanks, while veterans DeRozan and Rudy Gay adapted their games for an increased emphasis on defense and a faster pace offensively. \u201cPeople like DeMar and Rudy were great in mentoring these guys, and actually ended up changing some of the ways they have played over the years pace-wise; making defense more of a priority,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cThey bought in. They really enjoyed the young guys and melded together with them. Those two guys I was really proud of because they became leaders in that sense. So, the growth that took place there in some ways was unexpected, but it happened. We\u2019re just gonna go forward from what we did there.\u201d You can expect a few bumps in the road as White, Johnson and Weatherspoon will be limited to start training camp Friday due to what Popovich called \u201cbumps and bruises.\u201d In fact, Popovich anticipates there\u2019s a good chance none of those players will be available for the start of the regular season. Complicating matters is Aldridge, a seven-time All-Star and one of the game\u2019s best midrange scorers, who missed all of San Antonio\u2019s time in the bubble. How will he adjust to San Antonio\u2019s new style of play? Will he actually buy into it? \u201cTrey [Lyles] wasn\u2019t there either for the most part. And we\u2019ve got a couple of new players,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a couple of players that won\u2019t be there to start that were there in Orlando. So, it\u2019s a little bit of a mishmash in that sense. And I think that L.A. will have no problem adjusting to how we play because he wants to win. We want to get back in the playoffs, and he is committed to taking another huge step as far as becoming more of a 3-point shooter, which is necessary in this league for success we all know. \u201cHe took a big step last year, and he\u2019s taking even a bigger step this year. His workouts all summer long and into the fall have centered around that. He\u2019s bought into that and knows how much that can help us. So, I\u2019m excited for the whole group to come together.\u201d Aldridge (18.9 ppg) fired up a career-high 157 attempts from 3-point range last season, knocking them down at 38.9% to improve San Antoni\u2019s spacing and help slashers such as DeRozan, Murray and Walker to thrive. Led by leading scorer DeRozan (22.1 ppg), San Antonio features six returners averaging double digits in scoring in Aldridge, Murray (10.9 ppg), White (11.3 ppg), Mills (11.6 ppg) and Gay (10.9 ppg). Johnson averaged 9.1 points last season as a rookie and racked up 20 points or more in three games inside the Orlando bubble, including 24-point nights in his last two outings. So, it\u2019s understandable why Popovich and the rest of the Spurs organization continue to express optimism about the future. They all know it\u2019s time to move into the next era of San Antonio basketball. \u201cThe bottom line in all frankness is I don\u2019t remember winning a championship last year,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cI don\u2019t remember being in the playoffs.

Long pause. Of course, the young, ascending Dallas Mavericks maneuvered more meaningfully than just that in trading away Seth Curry on draft night for former Philadelphia guard Josh Richardson (and the 36 th pick they used to draft Tyler Bey) while adding forward James Johnson (an undefeated mixed martial arts fighter) in a three-team trade that sent Justin Jackson to Oklahoma City and Delon Wright to Detroit. In ensuring protection for their franchise player, the Mavericks believe they\u2019ve boosted their collective toughness with long, athletic players expected to shore up last year\u2019s struggling defense, which failed to properly complement the most efficient offense in the play-by-play era and, most likely, NBA history. \u201cWhen you establish that you\u2019re a galactically successful offensive team, but below average defensively, that\u2019s not gonna win you a championship,\u201d Carlisle explained Tuesday on a Zoom call ahead of Friday\u2019s start to training camp. \u201cI don\u2019t believe there\u2019s ever been a team that\u2019s won a title in the NBA that hasn\u2019t been a good defensive team. \u201cIt\u2019s great to be the very best at something as we were last year. We were the best offensive team in the history of the game on a points-per-possession basis. That is a substantial accomplishment. But we\u2019ve got to raise the level of our defense. We feel that with some of the changes we\u2019ve made, and also with the way we\u2019re gonna approach things, we\u2019re just going to put a greater emphasis on the defensive end of the floor.\u201d Behind Doncic\u2019s wizardry, the 2019-20 Mavericks broke Golden State\u2019s 2018-19 record for offensive efficiency (115.9 points\/100 possession) but ranked in the bottom half of the league in points allowed (112.1), defensive rating (111.2), points allowed in the paint (48.8) and points allowed in transition (16.4). Toss in the lessons learned from watching the Los Angeles Lakers\u2019 postseason run after their own 4-2 series loss to the L.A. Clippers in the opening round, and it\u2019s easy to see how the Mavericks arrived at their current state. \u201cYou watched the Lakers as they went through their playoff run,\u201d Carlisle said. \u201cThey lost Game 1 to Portland, and then they just put the clamps down defensively the next four games. Defensively, they were dominant. Same thing happened in their next series against Houston. Houston won Game 1, and they just tightened the screws. They won those series with defense. \u201cUltimately, they won the title with defense and a lot of their offense came off of their defense. They\u2019re a great transition team. And with LeBron and [Anthony] Davis, they were a great execution team. To aspire and realistically have a chance to be a better defensive team, you\u2019ve got to get better defensive players. I think we\u2019ve added some really good elements there through the draft, through trades. We\u2019re looking forward to getting this thing going.\u201d So is Doncic, after taking inventory of Dallas\u2019 offseason moves. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna make a difference for sure,\u201d Doncic said. \u201cWe got some great pickups. The players we traded for, they\u2019re amazing players, amazing defenders and I think they\u2019re gonna help us in a lot of ways.\u201d Some of the holdovers should play a role, too, with second-leading scorer Kristaps Porzingis expected to sit until at least January, according to Carlisle, as he recovers from October surgery to repair a torn meniscus in his right knee. Center Dwight Powell returns after suffering a torn right Achilles tendon last January along with guard Jalen Brunson, who missed the remainder of 2019-20 following surgery in March to correct a torn right labrum. \u201cAs a young, developing team that\u2019s gone through one stage of development of getting out of the lottery and into the playoffs, but experiencing a loss in the playoffs, we\u2019ve got to look at this as a situation where our collective toughness will increase anyway, regardless of who\u2019s on the team,\u201d Carlisle said. \u201cSo, you can never have enough toughness on an NBA team, particularly in the Western Conference. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to be very competitive. We\u2019ve got to be tough-minded, unselfish. I don\u2019t know what the exact pace of our game is going to be. We\u2019ve got to be able to win games by getting stops as well as by scoring. So, that\u2019s the basic gist. The identity of this team is largely gonna be a reflection of Luka because the best player always is a big part of the identity of the team. \u201cLuka in the playoffs last year showed that he can sit down and defend people, too. We\u2019ve had him guard all different kinds of positions. He\u2019s guarded point guards, he\u2019s guarded 4 men, at times he\u2019s guarded centers. He could do that. So, I want us to be an edgier team defensively. I think we\u2019ve added pieces that will help us do that.\u201d Richardson sounded ready to relish his new role alongside Doncic. Richardson, 27, has been a starter for the majority of his career, helping his teams advance to the postseason in three of his five years in the NBA. A guard for the Miami Heat at the time, Richardson first encountered Doncic when the star guard was a 16-year-old, training in Santa Barbara, California, and the youngster made an immediate impression after just a few pickup games. \u201cThe first time we played, I came back to Miami and I told some of my best friends,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cI was like, \u2018Yo, I just met this kid. He\u2019s gonna be the first pick in the draft.\u2019 I still think he should\u2019ve been. But he\u2019s lived up to my expectations so far and more. We\u2019ve just been cool since. I\u2019m excited to play next to him because he\u2019s one of the best playmakers in the NBA. \u201cHe has a really high gravity on the court. So, he\u2019s gonna need guys to help take pressure off of him. I think I can take some of the defensive pressure off of him. The other team\u2019s best guard, I\u2019ll usually be picking up. So, he can just get in where he fits in on defense and handle what he has to on offense.\u201d But will Richardson also serve as a protector for Doncic against teams looking to knock around the rising third-year guard? \u201cI don\u2019t know. A guy like me, I don\u2019t really take well to my brothers being messed with,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not an instigator of situations. So, I\u2019m not gonna be out there just trying to get in people\u2019s faces and do a lot of extra stuff. But I have no problem doing what needs to be done if people aren\u2019t being treated right. And I feel like there\u2019s a few other guys on this team that feel the same way about that.\u201d As for Doncic, he\u2019s spent the bulk of this offseason working to improve as a shooter after leading the NBA in triple-doubles (17) last season, while averaging 28.8 points, 9.4 rebounds and 8.8 assists. \u201cEvery year, I want to be better,\u201d Doncic said. \u201cThat\u2019s the goal for me. Like I always say: \u2018I want to win the championship.\u2019 That\u2019s the goal we entered last year [with]. That\u2019s the goal we\u2019re gonna enter this year [with] as a whole group.\u201d *** Michael C. Wright is a senior writer for NBA.com.

There was hardly time to process the sudden change when another deal struck two days later sent him back to Minnesota where his NBA career began. After three years away, the slick-passing, fan-favorite point guard has returned with a deeper life perspective, a thick beard and a slightly better jump shot. Rubio, drafted by the Timberwolves as a 19-year-old out of Spain in 2009 with the fifth overall pick, was more than happy to reunite with coach Ryan Saunders and join a team with offense-minded guards he ought to fit well with. \u201cI feel like I left with something that was unfinished, I would say, and I feel like I have a chance now to really prove myself again, prove I can help the team to get to the playoffs,\u201d Rubio said on a video conference call Tuesday with reporters from Minnesota\u2019s practice facility on the first day of training camp. \u201cI\u2019m a different player than when I came here and when I left. I have a lot more experience, especially in the NBA. I grew up as a player and as a person, too, and I feel like it\u2019s a good time.\u201d Injuries were a significant limitation early in his career, starting with the torn ACL in his left knee on March 9, 2012, that cut short what had been a promising rookie season. Rubio\u2019s mother died of cancer four years later, a heartbreak that helped him forge a stronger bond with Saunders, whose father, Flip Saunders, died of cancer in 2015. After one season under coach Tom Thibodeau, Rubio was traded to Utah when Thibodeau sought a different skill set at the position. With the Jazz, he mostly thrived next to Donovan Mitchell. After signing with the Suns as a free agent last year, deferring interest from the Timberwolves because he didn\u2019t feel ready to return, he meshed well with Devin Booker. Over the last three seasons Rubio has posted the three best field goal percentages and scoring averages of his nine-year career. He shot a career-best 36.1% from 3-point range in the pandemic-shortened 2019-20 season. Whether he comes off the bench to spell D\u2019Angelo Russell or plays next to him in a three-guard lineup, the 30-year-old Rubio will only enhance the improved depth around star center Karl-Anthony Towns. \u201cRicky does things that don\u2019t always show up on the box score, and he impacts winning in a way where he can help young players grow, and that\u2019s what the thought process behind this was,\u201d Saunders said. \u201cIt\u2019s documented, mine and his relationship, but yesterday, when we talked in my office, it was basketball and how we\u2019re going to improve this team and how we\u2019re going to build a winner, and that\u2019s our goal here.\u201d The Timberwolves also acquired veteran power forward Ed Davis during their draft-week maneuverings, highlighted by the selection of shooting guard Anthony Edwards with the first overall pick. They still have a long way to go, especially on defense, to be included in the conversation about Western Conference contenders for the playoffs, but their roster is undoubtedly stronger one year after president of basketball operations Gersson Rosas took over and initiated an aggressive renovation. \u201cI can really relate to the construction of the team they have here,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cI know KAT very well. I know how to get the best out of him, and hopefully we can do the same with D-Lo and all the young guys here to really help winning.\u201d"},{"id":431001,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/kevin-durant-unsure-what-to-expect-in-return-from-torn-achilles","date":"2020-12-02","title":"Kevin Durant unsure what to expect in return from torn Achilles","content":"NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Kevin Durant used to worry about how he would play. There hasn\u2019t been reason for concern for years. He became an NBA MVP and a two-time champion, an explosive scorer who could get 25 points on a bad night and 45 on a good one. But that was before having one of the most serious injuries a basketball player could face. Now, 18 months after rupturing his Achilles tendon and finally set to play for the Brooklyn Nets, Durant once again has reason to wonder if he will be one of the league\u2019s greatest players. \u201cWho knows?\u201d he said Tuesday. \u201cI\u2019ve just got to see how I feel in a real NBA game again.\u201d He hasn\u2019t played in one since Game 5 of the 2019 NBA Finals, when he went down early in the second quarter of his last appearance for Golden State. Surgery followed and then shortly after he decided to join the Nets along with friend and fellow superstar Kyrie Irving. With that duo plus a deep and talented roster, the Nets have a chance to be one of the NBA\u2019s top teams. But that may depend on how quickly \u2014 or if \u2014 Durant regains his form. Few players have bettered it. The 6-foot-10 forward is a four-time scoring champion who has averaged 27 points, easing whatever fears he had earlier in his career. \u201cI definitely used to have crazy anxiety wondering how I was going to play the next day or the next series and it used to drive me crazy,\u201d Durant said. He got over that by relying on his work ethic and he believes that will help him overcome the uncertainty he faces now. Nets officials have praised the way he attacked his rehab and it seems clear that if Durant does struggle, it won\u2019t be because he wasn\u2019t prepared. Instead, it will be because he\u2019s a 32-year-old coming off an injury from which some players much younger have never fully recovered. \u201cI\u2019ve been through surgeries and injuries before, but the longest recovery I had was three months,\u201d Durant said. \u201cBut the first phase of the Achilles, I couldn\u2019t walk or run. You had to use a scooter. \u201cSo I think those milestones of reaching, like learning how to walk, learning how to run, jump again and getting used to certain movements again, I think that\u2019s underestimated.\u201d Irving thought Durant was perhaps rushed back from his last injury, when he missed nine games during the 2019 postseason and then suffered the Achilles injury the night he returned. This time Durant has had more time than expected because of the coronavirus-interrupted NBA schedule, but the Nets still want to make sure he isn\u2019t overdoing it. \u201cKevin\u2019s done everything you could have ever asked to put himself in this position,\u201d new coach Steve Nash said. \u201cHe is truly a gift for all of us with not only his talent but his love for the game and the joy he brings in the building every day. Perhaps we have to protect him from himself in a way because he brings so much joy and passion to the sport. He\u2019s so eager and hungry after such a long layoff in his prime.\u201d Durant said he\u2019s been doing every individual drill as hard as he can. Soon will come team workouts and eventually two preseason games to get himself ready for a season that opens in three weeks. Only then will he start to get some answers. \u201cWe\u2019re going to see how I feel going forward, but I\u2019m exited about the first day and putting on my practice jersey again,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a cool feeling today. We\u2019ll see how I feel tomorrow.\u201d"},{"id":430986,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/76ers-need-rivers-to-tap-into-simmons-full-potential","date":"2020-12-02","title":"76ers need Doc Rivers to tap into Ben Simmons' full potential","content":"PHILADELPHIA (AP) \u2014 Ben Simmons captioned an Instagram post celebrating his selection to Forbes\u2019 list of top young athletes under 30 with \u201cThey stay talking. I stay working.\u201d They\u2019re always talking about Simmons in Philly. They \u2014 fans, teammates, media, gossip columnists \u2014 all want more out of the reticent Simmons than he is often inclined to give. Their biggest hangup is the All-Star guard\u2019s seeming unwillingness to bend to the demand that he develop a shot beyond 15 feet. His former coach publicly exhorted Simmons to shoot more 3s. Simmons ignored Brett Brown. His new coach? Well, without a practice held, Doc Rivers is just fine with whatever production he can squeeze out of the prodigious talent the 76ers are counting on to lead them out of the middle of the pack in the Eastern Conference. Simmons is 2-for-24 lifetime from 3-point range. That stat is meaningless for Rivers, starting his first season in Philadelphia after coaching stops in Orlando, Boston and with the Clippers. \u201cI don\u2019t care about Ben\u2019s shooting as much as so many other people seem to care about it,\u201d Rivers said Tuesday. \u201cI care that he\u2019s a great player. I\u2019m going to let him play. I\u2019m going to give him the keys and let him be free and play. If he takes no shots, I\u2019m fine. If he takes 10 3s, I\u2019m fine. If he gets to the line 15 times, I\u2019m fine. Ben is brilliant enough for me to allow him to play and not get in his way and try to cloud his head up with a bunch of crap. It\u2019s about winning, and that\u2019s what I want Ben to focus on, how to make each other better and win.\u201d The Sixers didn\u2019t do enough winning last season and grossly underachieved in a year that was deemed NBA Finals or bust. Simmons missed the postseason with a knee injury and the Sixers were swept by Boston. The 24-year-old Simmons has been the primary ballhandler for the Sixers for the bulk of his three-year career, but the 6-foot-10 triple-double threat played power forward when the NBA season resumed in the bubble. \u201cIs Ben a point guard? Honestly, I don\u2019t care, I don\u2019t know that yet,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cBut I know one thing, if you can get him in space going downhill, the ball gets to the right place. We want to do that as much as we can.\u201d Simmons is as good as it gets at slashing and finishing, and his 1-on-1 defense earned him a spot on the NBA\u2019s All-Defensive first team. Is that enough? Rivers has a cram session of sorts to figure out how he wants to use Simmons \u2014 and the rest of his roster \u2014 because of COVID-19 protocols that shortened prep time. Training camps opened Tuesday, though on-court sessions were limited to individual workouts and full group practices can\u2019t start until Friday. The Sixers\u2019 identity may not truly take shape until deep into the season. Rivers said little about what kind of style he wants to craft for his new team, other than to mention he wants it to rank in the top 10 in both offense and defense. \u201cI call it the lab. You\u2019ve got to get in there first,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cThe identity has to be what they believe it is, not what I want it to be. I know that we should be a great defensive team. I know that.\u201d Joel Embiid has anchored the defense for the Sixers, even as he\u2019s fought injuries and conditioning woes that prevented him from developing into an elite NBA superstar. Rivers didn\u2019t single out Embiid but he noted it was necessary for the Sixers to get in the \u201cbest shape possible\u201d if they want to win their first NBA title since 1983. Embiid and Simmons have been simultaneously considered one of the top duos in the NBA \u2014 they are both All-Stars with max contracts \u2014 and a pair that has fallen well shy of championship expectations. \u201cWhat they have to do is win,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re all here, right? It\u2019s amazing how I hear they haven\u2019t won together. \u2018Yet\u2019 Rivers said he planned to run more pick-and-rolls for Embiid and Simmons to maximize their talent. The Sixers ranked next-to-last in pick-and-roll offense last season, and the Sixers hope acquiring shooters (notably Seth Curry) to create space for the pair will make them flourish. The Sixers open the preseason Dec. 15 vs. Boston and have one more exhibition before the season is expected to start around Christmas. The Sixers don\u2019t have to figure out by the new year how to help Embiid and Simmons reach their potential. But those championship runs won\u2019t start until they do."},{"id":430981,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/cavaliers-eager-to-get-into-gym-after-months-apart","date":"2020-12-02","title":"Cavaliers eager to get into gym after months apart","content":"CLEVELAND (AP) \u2014 The eight-month, pandemic-induced layoff deprived the Cavaliers of valuable games and drained coach J.B. Bickerstaff of some competitive juices. He took drastic measures to replenish them. \u201cI\u2019m ashamed to say it, but I found myself at 8-year-old and 9-year-old girls\u2019 soccer games yelling at referees,\u201d Bickerstaff said on a Zoom call as the Cavs opened training camp Tuesday. \u201cI\u2019m sitting there watching second- and third-grade girls and I\u2019m on edge, and the hair on the back of my neck is standing up.\u201d Bickerstaff can finally relax \u2014 a little. The Cavs, who had an already tumultuous 2019-20 season hijacked by COVID-19 and after just 11 games with Bickerstaff in charge, returned to the floor Tuesday for individual workouts as they began cramming for an upcoming season that\u2019s only weeks away. For now, players are only permitted to work out individually before the team can practice as a group starting Friday. Due to a storm that dumped up to a foot of snow across northeast Ohio, forward Larry Nance Jr.\u2019s commute to the team\u2019s training facility in Independence, Ohio, took much longer than usual. He would have gladly driven a day to get there. \u201cIt\u2019s just fitting,\u201d he said. \u201cMerry Christmas. I certainly don\u2019t live in Los Angeles anymore.\u201d There was a certain joyful holiday giddiness as the Cavs got back in the gym for the first time in months. Not only did the virus abruptly end their season just as they were playing their best ball, but the Cavs took another hit when they were one of the eight teams omitted from the NBA\u2019s \u201cbubble\u201d in Orlando. The exclusion prevented them from growing, bonding and continuing a rebuild that suffered a setback last season when coach John Beilein stepped down following the All-Star break. Bickerstaff acknowledged the Cavs were punished by not getting to play. \u201cThere were other teams that got to experience things that we didn\u2019t get an opportunity to experience,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s young players who got valuable minutes in that bubble that our guys didn\u2019t get. You look at the leaps that some of the teams made, whether it\u2019s Phoenix or San Antonio, they got a lot of valuable experience that we weren\u2019t afforded because we weren\u2019t in the bubble. \u201cSo having said that, none of those are excuses and none of those are copouts for our guys. Our expectation is we show up, we go to work and we compete no matter the circumstances, so we\u2019re excited and we\u2019re looking forward to that.\u201d Bickerstaff\u2019s agenda over the next few weeks includes fixing Cleveland\u2019s shoddy defense. The Cavs were awful with their backs to the basket, and while not giving away any of his plans, Bickerstaff said his goal is to simplify things for his players to make them better defenders. Of course, it will help that Andre Drummond decided to come back. The 6-foot-11 center, who came to Cleveland in a surprising trade with Detroit in February, opted into his contract last month by picking up his $28 million option. There had been speculation about whether Drummond truly wanted to stay, but he said the Cavs were his only choice. \u201cMy plan was always to come back to Cleveland,\u201d he said. \u201cJust waiting to see what we were doing as a team and see what we\u2019re looking for so I didn\u2019t mess anything up. But other than that, my plan was to come back to Cleveland and just work my way from here.\u201d Drummond only played in eight games before the season was halted. However, the two-time All-Star likes the pieces he sees in Cleveland and is eager to start anew with a hungry team. \u201cIt\u2019s a young team, really, really young team and guys that are willing to learn and want to win,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just they need a little bit of guidance. And I think J.B., myself, Kevin Love and Larry are gonna be able to help these guys a lot. And the process is fun for me.\u201d Drummond will be tasked with helping protect the rim, and he\u2019s set a goal to be named the league\u2019s top defensive player. He\u2019s got even larger plans for the Cavs. \u201cWe\u2019re not too far off,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have the caliber guys here to really make some noise.

Young was fourth in the league in scoring and shots from the field last season, but he\u2019s quick to note he also was second in assists. \u201cPassing is nothing new for me,\u201d Young said. \u201cI love getting my teammates involved and when my teammates are open I\u2019m going to find them and I\u2019m going to put my teammates in the best position to succeed. That\u2019s just my job as a point guard and as a leader of this team, to help my teammates be in the best position.\u201d The offseason additions by general manager Travis Schlenk make Atlanta a contender to return to the Eastern Conference playoffs for the first time since 2017. Bogdanovic, Gallinari and others provide needed help for an offense that relied too heavily on Young and forward John Collins. Young averaged 29.6 points and 9.3 assists last season. Collins averaged 21.6 points and 10.1 rebounds. The returning core also includes former first-round picks De\u2019Andre Hunter, Kevin Huerter and Cam Reddish. Seeking to improve the Hawks\u2019 3-point shooting, defense and depth, Schlenk also traded for Tony Snell and signed free agent Solomon Hill. The Hawks had free-agent funds available and they found veteran players eager to join the rebuilding effort. \u201cThis is the new free-agent destination,\u201d Hawks coach Lloyd Pierce said Tuesday. \u201cEverybody wants to come to Atlanta and that\u2019s how we want to keep it. \u2026 They know we can do something special here and they\u2019re excited to be a part of it.\u201d Another player poised for his Atlanta debut is center Clint Capela, who was recovering from an injury when he was acquired from Houston last season. This year\u2019s first-round draft pick, former Southern Cal center Onyeka Okongwu, should add more defense while he is expected to play behind Capela and Collins. The wealth of depth is a new luxury for the Hawks. \u201cYou look at all the positives and your mind just starts to race,\u201d Collins said. Suddenly, there will be a more intense competition for starting spots and playing time. \u201cI think we\u2019re all interested to see how that\u2019s all going to mesh together,\u201d Collins said, adding the depth \u201calso creates a competitive edge and gives guys that mindset that every possession counts and if I do mess up or whatever there\u2019s another guy on the bench who can take my spot.\u201d The Hawks won only 20 games before the coronavirus pandemic left them in the bottom eight of the NBA and secluded from the NBA bubble in Orlando. Being left out of the bubble motivated Collins. \u201cObviously it hurt to not be there,\u201d Collins said. \u201c\u2026 It gave me more motivation each morning to go get my workout in.\u201d The Hawks have missed the playoffs while finishing with fewer than 30 wins for three consecutive seasons. The busy offseason created a buzz that has been missing in Atlanta. \u201cIt\u2019s good to have people talking about Atlanta basketball right now,\u201d Young said. \u201cI want it to stay this way. The city deserves it, this organization deserves it. We have a lot of exciting pieces, a lot of exciting players. It\u2019s good we\u2019re getting attention right now.\u201d"},{"id":430904,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/michael-jordans-recruitment-helped-hornets-land-gordon-hayward","date":"2020-12-01","title":"Michael Jordan's recruitment helped Hornets land Gordon Hayward","content":"CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) \u2014 Hornets owner Michael Jordan and general manager Mitch Kupchak had no intentions of spending money on a big-name free agent this offseason. But things changed quickly when Gordon Hayward opted out of his contract with the Boston Celtics. The prospect of getting a playmaking wing \u2014 something Jordan has coveted for years \u2014 proved too intriguing to ignore, prompting the Hornets to veer slightly away from their well established plan of developing young players and pursue the 2017 All-Star. \u201cI did not think that we would be in a position to pursue a free agent of Gordon\u2019s caliber,\u201d Kupchak said Tuesday on a videoconference call. \u201c\u2026 It looked like Gordon would be a free agent next year, which based on how we felt our team was positioned we might have chosen to pursue him next year. But he opted out. When he opted out and we quickly found out we were in the picture, we quickly started the recruiting process.\u201d Kupchak said Jordan was \u201cvery involved\u201d in that process. The six-time NBA champion sent text messages to Hayward and called him twice, hoping to lure him to Charlotte six years after giving him a four-year $64 million offer sheet as a restricted free agent that the Utah Jazz ultimately matched. The offer sheet, Hayward said, meant a lot to him. \u201cHe texted me that he has wanted me for years,\u201d Hayward said. \u201c\u2026 He was just saying how he would be really excited to have me here in Charlotte and thinks I can make a huge difference and have a big impact on helping this team and being a difference maker. So that was the main message: helping us get to that next level.\u201d Despite Jordan\u2019s phone calls and the Hornets\u2019 big push, Kupchak said he still didn\u2019t have a good feeling about landing Hayward when free agency began. But as the first day of the signing period began, talks quickly heated up with Hayward\u2019s agent and the result was a four-year, $120 million contract agreement drawing a congratulatory phone call from Jordan. Hayward, who averaged 17.5 points, 6.7 rebounds and 4.1 assists per game last season, said the decision to opt out of his deal with the Hornets wasn\u2019t so much about his role with the Celtics as it was the intrigue of helping build Charlotte into a winning franchise. The Hornets have failed to reach the playoffs in each of the last four seasons and haven\u2019t won a playoff series since 2012. \u201cThe more and more conversations that I had with the coaching staff and with some of the front office guys, the vision that they had, the impact they believe I can have, helping us get to the next level \u2014 that was very powerful for me,\u201d said Hayward. Hornets coach James Borrego is brimming with excitement over the addition of Hayward and No. 3 overall draft pick LaMelo Ball, players he considers outstanding playmakers with great size. He can\u2019t wait to get the 6-foot-7 tandem on the floor Friday when the Hornets have their first team practice of training camp. \u201cFor him to leave a storied franchise like that, I just didn\u2019t expect it,\u201d Borrego said. Hayward suffered a significant injury in 2017 when he fractured his tibia and dislocated ankle in his first game with the Celtics. Last year he injured his ankle while Boston was playing in the NBA bubble in Orlando, Florida and was relegated to spot playing time for most of the postseason. But Kupchak said Gordon passed the team\u2019s physical examination \u201cwith flying colors.\u201d The GM also has no problem that Hayward is 30 years old, saying the former Butler star is \u201cin the prime of his career.\u201d The Hornets acquired unprotected second round draft picks in 2023 and 2024 from the Celtics as part of the sign-and-trade deal for Hayward. They surrendered a protected second-round pick next year that will only wind up going to Boston if Charlotte shocks the NBA world and finishes in the top five in the league. \u201cHe\u2019s a bona fide starter in this league and we are happy to add him not only at a position of great need, which is a true wing, but we are also excited to have his leadership and stability in the locker room,\u201d Kupchak said. Kupchak said the addition of Hayward and their draft picks leaves the Hornets about $4 million under the NBA salary cap this year and a projected $27 million under for next year, despite the decision to stretch the contract of Nicolas Batum, who was waived on Sunday. \u201cWe\u2019re in a good place,\u201d Kupchak said. \u201cWe are trying to add to our talent base, and I think we have done that.\u201d"},{"id":430874,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/pair-of-warriors-players-test-positive-for-covid-19","date":"2020-12-01","title":"Two Warriors players test positive for COVID-19","content":"The Golden State Warriors have delayed the start of individual workouts after two players tested positive for COVID-19, general manager Bob Myers announced on Tuesday.

Cousins has not played since an injury-abbreviated 2018-19 season with Golden State in which he averaged 16.3 points and 8.2 rebounds in 30 regular season games. The production was encouraging given that Cousins was coming off a torn Achilles tendon suffered the previous season with New Orleans. But the versatile 6-foot-10 center\u2019s return was cut short by a torn quadriceps in the first round of the 2019 playoffs, keeping him sidelined until the Finals. Cousins signed with the Lakers the following season, only to the suffer a torn ACL during preseason workouts that cost him the entire 2019-20 campaign. The fifth overall pick in the 2010 Draft and a four-time All-Star, Cousins has played in just 78 regular season games over the last three seasons. His arrival comes at a pivotal time for the Rockets, who are working through reported trade requests by superstar guards James Harden and Russell Westbrook.

However, some subtle changes to them \u2014 both on and off the court \u2014 make them worthy of a second look. Just like last season, the Clippers have partnered with globally renowned artist, Mister Cartoon, on their look. New to the mix this season is LA-based graffiti artist Royyal Dog, who has been tapped to \u201ccelebrate the authentic spirit of L.A. street culture\u201d with Mister Cartoon for the team\u2019s City Edition uniform and merchandise line. This season\u2019s City Edition keeps the popular \u2018Los Angeles\u2019 wordmark from last season , but changes the primary color of the uniform from white to black. Per the team, the design is a symbol of the Clippers\u2019 efforts to cultivate the next generation of talent in the city through its \u201cMake Your Mark\u201d campaign. As part of that campaign, the Clippers and Mister Cartoon will host monthly, digital workshops for high school students from various organizations in L.A.-based school districts. During those sessions, 50 students will receive live, personalized instruction from Mister Cartoon via Zoom as well as a Clippers art kit with the supplies needed for each workshop. \u201cIt\u2019s been real cool working with the Clippers for the past two seasons,\u201d Mister Cartoon said in a statement via the team.. \u201cOur focus has been to motivate the youth and encourage them to have a work ethic like pro athletes do.

Guard Kemba Walker, an All-Star last season, will be out until at least early January as he works to strengthen his troublesome left knee. Per the team, Walker consulted with multiple specialists in early October and received a stem cell injection in his left knee. Afterward, he was put on a 12-week strengthening program. He is expected to return to on-court activities in early December, but his status for game availability won\u2019t be known until at least the first week of January, the team said. Walker appeared in 50 games prior to the season\u2019s suspension in mid-March and averaged 21.2 points, a team-leading 4.9 assists per game and 4.1 rebounds per game. From the season\u2019s start until mid-March, Walker sank 165 3-pointers and was on pace to hit more than 260 of them. By mid-January, Walker had begun to experience soreness in his left knee. He missed 10 games over the course of the two months leading up to the suspension of the 2019-20 season because of the coronavirus pandemic. After February, the injury clearly affected Walker\u2019s game: he shot 31.7% overall after shooting 43.9% through January. The Celtics also announced on Tuesday that guard Romeo Langford, who had successful surgery in September on a torn scapholunate ligament in his right wrist, is continuing to rehab from his injury. Additionally, new forward\/center Tristan Thompson suffered a minor hamstring strain during an offseason workout prior to arriving in Boston. His availability for the first week of training camp will be limited."},{"id":430389,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/bogut-retires-calls-quits-on-his-bid-for-an-olympic-medal","date":"2020-12-01","title":"Bogut retires, calls quits on his bid for an Olympic medal","content":"SYDNEY (AP) \u2014 Andrew Bogut is calling quits on his bid for an Olympic medal and has decided to retire after 15 years in professional basketball. The 36-year-old Australian had earlier cited back and ankle injuries, the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent postponement of the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo as potential reasons to retire. On Tuesday he made it official. Bogut, a 2005 No. 1 draft pick by Milwaukee and who won an NBA championship with the Golden State Warriors in 2015, had been planning to retire after playing for Australia at the Tokyo Games. Those games have been delayed until July 2021. \u201cI just can\u2019t physically and mentally get to 2021 with the way the body has been,\u201d Bogut said on his \u201cRogue Bogues\u201d podcast. \u201cI mean, I could, on a lot of painkillers and with a lot of physical and mental anguish, but it\u2019s just not worth it at this point in my career.\u201d Bogut played for Sydney in the National Basketball League the past two seasons, winning the NBL\u2019s MVP in 2019 and leading the Kings to a grand final last season. \u201cThe last two years have been a real challenge for me just to get out of bed in the morning some days, let alone go to a training session or a game,\u201d Bogut said. \u201cThe body, probably from 2018 onwards, was hanging by a thread. \u201cIt was real challenging and from the 2019-20 season that thread was completely frayed and in little pieces. It was real frustrating for me.\u201d Bogut played a key role in Australia\u2019s fourth-place finish at last year\u2019s World Cup in China and has been on the Australian team\u2019s roster since the 2004 Athens Olympics. The Melbourne-born Bogut was named The Associated Press college basketball player of the year in 2005 while playing for Utah, just before being chosen No. 1 in the NBA draft by the Bucks. The Australian Olympic Committee paid tribute to Bogut, who played at Athens in 2004, Beijing in \u201908 and helped the Boomers to fourth place at the 2016 Games in Rio de Janeiro. Bogut missed the London Olympics in 2012 because of injury. \u201cAndrew was so much more than a big man, he had an aura about him,\u201d said John Coates, who leads the AOC and is a vice-president of the International Olympic Committee. \u201cHe was an inspirational figure for the Australian Olympic team and a leader on and off the court. \u201cThis is not just a loss for basketball in Australia but a loss for the Australian Olympic movement. I know it must have been a difficult decision for him, but the great athletes know when it\u2019s time.\u201d"},{"id":430348,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/usa-basketball-beats-mexico-to-clinch-americup-berth","date":"2020-12-01","title":"USA Basketball beats Mexico to clinch AmeriCup berth","content":"USA Basketball went into a bubble and emerged with a berth in the 2022 FIBA AmeriCup. Yante Maten scored 21 points, Josh Maggette added 19 and the U.S. topped Mexico 94-78 on Monday, moving to 4-0 in Group D qualifying and securing a spot in the tournament that serves as the championship of the 44 teams in the FIBA Americas zone \u2014 comprised of nations from North America, South America, Central America and the Caribbean. \u201cIt means a lot because I get to represent for my country,\u201d Maten said. \u201cI think everyone can represent in a different way and I represent mine through basketball. I\u2019m very honored to be here and to be able to say that I helped accomplish something big.\u201d John Jenkins scored 16 points, Travis Trice had 14 and Levi Randolph added 12 for the Americans, who ended their weeklong stay in Indianapolis \u2014 inside a bubble, where players and coaches were all tested often for the coronavirus and fans were kept away \u2014 with a pair of wins in two days under coach Mike Fratello. As has been the case throughout qualifying, the U.S. used a team of players with primarily G League experience for the games. NBA training camps are starting this week, and some members of this team will have invites to join rosters in the coming days. But many players on the U.S. roster face uncertain futures, and Fratello told them before Monday\u2019s game to play as if it would be their final game for a while. \u201cI wanted to be part of helping the United States move on and qualify for the next thing,\u201d Fratello said. \u201cThe fact we were able to do that was very rewarding to me. I love to see young guys get together, form a team, work together, play defense together, pass the ball together and then have success. That\u2019s what this week, these last two weeks, have been all about.\u201d The U.S., which has won the AmeriCup gold medal seven times in nine previous attempts, is the second country to clinch a spot in the 12-team final field. Brazil is the other nation that has clinched; there are 14 teams left to vie for the 10 remaining spots in the tournament that is scheduled for Sept. 2-11, 2022 at a to-be-determined site. All the Americans needed to clinch a spot was to finish in the top three places of their four-team qualifying group. They got that done with ease; Mexico is now 2-2, while Puerto Rico and The Bahamas are both 1-3 \u2014 Puerto Rico rallied in the final minutes to beat The Bahamas 91-85 earlier Monday. In their first three games of AmeriCup qualifying, the U.S. never trailed. That wasn\u2019t the case Monday; the Americans trailed on three occasions, all of them in the first quarter, for a total of 77 seconds. By halftime, they were in control. The U.S. lead was 27-26 midway through the second quarter; a 25-8 run over the next five-plus minutes pushed the margin out to 52-34 at the break. The lead grew to as much as 26 in the second half before Mexico got within 11 midway through the fourth quarter, but the outcome never seemed in much doubt. Lucas Martinez led Mexico with 17 points. \u201cWe finished the game tough,\u201d Mexico coach Paco Olmos said. \u201cFor us, this was really important.\u201d The final qualifying games are in February. Mexico plays Puerto Rico and the U.S. faces The Bahamas on Feb. 18; then on Feb. 21, Mexico meets the U.S. again and The Bahamas will play Puerto Rico. For the Mexicans, Bahamians and Puerto Ricans, those games will decide their AmeriCup fates. For the Americans, they\u2019ll be little more than scrimmages. It\u2019s unclear if Fratello will remain as the coach for the last two qualifying games; his NBA broadcasting commitments may keep him away. The AmeriCup qualifying is part of the complex qualifying system for nations to reach events like the 2023 Basketball World Cup and the 2024 Paris Olympics. Only the host nations \u2014 the Philippines, Japan and Indonesia for the next World Cup, and France for the 2024 Olympics \u2014 automatically qualify for those tournaments. All other nations must graduate through a series of other tournaments, such as the AmeriCup, to make those fields."},{"id":430307,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/ready-or-not-nba-training-camps-are-set-to-open-once-again","date":"2020-12-01","title":"Ready or not, NBA training camps are set to open once again","content":"For the Los Angeles Lakers and Miami Heat, it was the shortest offseason ever. For the eight teams that haven\u2019t played since March, the offseason dragged for longer than most seasons last. And for all 30 clubs, questions are far more prevalent than answers these days. Ready or not, the NBA is back. Training camps open around the league Tuesday, though on-court sessions will be limited to individual workouts and only for those players who have gotten three negative coronavirus test results back in the last few days. Mandatory \u201cgroup training activities,\u201d another way to describe what would otherwise be called practice, will begin in some cities Friday and for most clubs Sunday, the league said. \u201cI feel like a kid getting excited for the first day of school again,\u201d Atlanta guard Trae Young tweeted. As is the case with school, there will be tests in NBA camps. Lots of them. Players and coaches will be tested for coronavirus daily around the league, and a positive test at this point would likely derail someone for most of camp and probably into the preseason. The rules are so strict that clubs cannot even hold a team dinner on the eve of training camp; the NBA isn\u2019t allowing those to take place until at least Dec. 11, or the start of Phase 4 in the league\u2019s five-phase plan for health and safety. \u201cWe\u2019re all going to have to be very nimble, first of all keeping guys safe and healthy,\u201d Utah general manager Justin Zanik said Monday. \u201cWe\u2019ll get an idea of the schedule, how travel is, how the pandemic affects us. \u2026 No one in the NBA, other than a three-month bubble, has ever gone through what we\u2019re about to go through.\u201d Preseason is less than two weeks away, starting Dec. 11. The regular season starts on Dec. 22, three weeks from Tuesday. A schedule for the first half of the shortened 72-game regular season could be known in the coming days, and many teams are still deciding if they can begin the season with fans in their arenas or not. The NBA champion Lakers have already said they aren\u2019t having fans in their building to start the season; Charlotte and Oklahoma City announced Monday that they will begin their home schedules the same way. \u201cThis is going to be a challenging season for us,\u201d Phoenix general manager James Jones said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do everything in our power to make sure that we try to stay COVID-free and try to stay healthy. With 72 games in a condensed season and more or increased back-to-backs means that we\u2019ll have to manage our time appropriately.\u201d For nine coaches \u2014 Tom Thibodeau in New York, Steve Nash in Brooklyn, Billy Donovan in Chicago, Doc Rivers in Philadelphia, Nate Bjorkgren in Indiana, Stan Van Gundy in New Orleans, Stephen Silas in Houston, Mark Daigneault in Oklahoma City and Tyronn Lue with the Los Angeles Clippers \u2014 this week marks the formal start of their on-court tenures with their clubs. It\u2019ll also be the first training camp as head coach for J.B. Bickerstaff in Cleveland; he took over as coach of the Cavaliers in February. Some teams haven\u2019t played since March 11. Others saw their seasons resume in July, then end in August or September. And for the Lakers and the Heat, the NBA finalists, the season went until mid-October. Not even two months later, it\u2019s time to play again. \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say that coming into the season, given everything that\u2019s going on in the country relative to COVID and the effects that it\u2019s having on everybody both locally and nationally, this is going to be a pretty unique season,\u201d Oklahoma City general manager Sam Presti said. \u201cWe\u2019ve never been through a season like this before.

Just know you\u2019ll catch a physical beatdown trying to defeat the New Orleans Pelicans this season. That\u2019s the thought that immediately crossed the mind of Pelicans coach Stan Van Gundy when New Orleans sent away Jrue Holiday in a four-team trade to acquire former Oklahoma City Thunder center Steven Adams and former Milwaukee Bucks guard Eric Bledsoe to play alongside Zion Williamson, Brandon Ingram and the rest of the club\u2019s collection of promising young talent. \u201cFind me a 4 and 5 together anywhere in the league that\u2019s as physical as those two guys,\u201d Van Gundy said of New Orleans\u2019 new frontcourt duo of Willamson and Adams during a Zoom call on Monday. \u201cWhen we made that trade, I said, \u2018Look, the one thing I know for sure: you might come in here and shoot the ball great. You might find a way to beat us. You\u2019re not punking the New Orleans Pelicans ever with those two guys next to each other.\u201d The shortened offseason wheeling and dealing of executive vice president of basketball operations David Griffin yielded what the organization believes are key ingredients to completing its vision for a tougher, more competitive squad capable of consistently living up to New Orleans\u2019 mantra of \u201cWon\u2019t Bow Down.\u201d The reboot for 2020-21 started off with Griffin\u2019s October hiring of Van Gundy, who led teams that finished in the top 10 in defensive rating in nine of his 12 seasons as a head coach in Miami (2003-06), Orlando (2007-12) and Detroit (2014-18). Van Gundy inherits an underachieving Pelicans squad that finished last season ranked 21 st in defensive rating (118.8), 28 th in opponent points in the paint (52.2), 28 th in opponent fast break points (15.4) and 26 th in opponent second-chance points (13.6). To further assist Van Gundy in the effort Griffin acquired two physical, defensive-minded veterans with playoff experience in Adams and Bledsoe. Griffin envisions Bledsoe playing alongside Lonzo Ball in the starting backcourt, while Williamson and Adams man the 4 and 5 spots, respectively, with 2019-20 Kia NBA Most Improved Player Brandon Ingram holding it down at small forward. Griffin mentioned Williamson could play some small forward this season, as the team plans to put the ball into his hands more. Ingram, meanwhile, officially signed a five-year max deal worth a reported $158 million early Monday before Van Gundy and Griffin addressed the media. When the Pelicans bussed out of the NBA bubble in Orlando back in August after finishing a disappointing 2-6 and out of the postseason, Ingram shared his thoughts on the future with Griffin and general manager Trajan Langdon. Griffin described the moment as \u201cvery, very powerful.\u201d \u201cBrandon shared very plainly with Trajan and I he doesn\u2019t intend to [miss] the playoffs again in his career and he was taking a position of leadership in this franchise,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cHe\u2019s somebody that really represents the things that we are about, and his on-court talent is very clear and evident. He\u2019s just scratching the surface of who he can be. I think the thing that might be most exciting from a basketball perspective is Brandon knows he\u2019s got a lot of room for improvement on the defensive side of the ball, and he really wanted to be pushed on that side of the ball. So, I think the synergies that could exist between Brandon, the players that we\u2019ve mentioned already in [Eric Bledsoe] and Steven [Adams] as leaders for our group are significant. But I also think the coachability of those three as our leaders really lend themselves to coach Van Gundy and his staff making the kind of impact that they want to as well.\u201d Locking up Ingram for the next five years, in addition to signing Adams to a two-year extension last week certainly helps. As it stands now, three of New Orleans\u2019 starters (Ball, Ingram, and Williamson) are 23 years old or younger, while Adams is just 27 with 59 games of playoff experience under his belt. Bledsoe turns 31 on Dec. 9 and has played in 48 postseason games. That\u2019s not even accounting for all the other young talent on the Pelicans roster. Remember, New Orleans benefitted last season from timely contributions from 2019 first-round picks Jaxon Hayes and Nickeil Alexander-Walker. The Pelicans also used the 13 th pick in the draft earlier this month to select Alabama point guard Kira Lewis Jr., and they\u2019ve got a couple of solid veteran contributors in Josh Hart and sharpshooter J.J. Redick. \u201cTo express a higher level of competitiveness as a group, we needed more grit and toughness and more of a defensive identity,\u201d Griffin explained. \u201cLiterally every move that we\u2019ve made fits that theme. There is not a player that we brought in here that isn\u2019t about the things that we cared the most about, and everyone we\u2019re bringing in here on a human level is the types of people that we really wanted to represent us.\u201d Will it all translate to winning? It\u2019s impossible to know at this point. But when the Pelicans hit the court Sunday for their first practice, the plan is to start putting the building blocks in place, according to Van Gundy, who expects to immediately run through \u201ctransition defense, right from our offensive rebounding rules, to getting back will be the very first thing we address basketball wise.\u201d Van Gundy pointed out four areas of defensive improvement he\u2019d like to see this season. \u201cNo. 1, we just talked about: we\u2019ve got to get back. We can\u2019t be giving up easy buckets in transition,\u201d Van Gundy said. \u201cNo. 2 is we\u2019ve got to keep the ball out of the paint. We gave up 52 points a game in the paint last year. I don\u2019t think you can build a sustainable defense around that. What sort of goes along with that and helps is we\u2019ve got to cut our fouls. We gave up almost 25 free-throw attempts a game last year. So, if you\u2019re giving up 52 in the paint and you\u2019re giving up 25 free-throw attempts, it gets really, really difficult no matter what else you do. The fourth one is we\u2019ve got to be a better defensive rebounding team. We were a really good offensive rebounding team and got a lot of second-chance points, and a really poor defensive rebounding team that gave up a lot of second-chance points. So, if we can do those four things, I\u2019d be pretty happy.\u201d * * * Michael C. Wright is a senior writer for NBA.com.

His first contract took care of that. And the way he sees it, his next contract sets his family up for generations. Adebayo and the Miami Heat agreed on a five-year extension that will be worth at least $163 million, the team and Adebayo\u2019s agent Alex Saratsis said Tuesday. It will be the richest contract in terms of total value in Heat history. \u201cThis is an accomplishment I always wanted to get,\u201d Adebayo said. \u201cJust being able to reach this milestone and being able to generationally change my family\u2019s life and also take care of the people around me, it\u2019s a big deal to me.\u201d Adebayo will make $5.1 million this season, the final year of his rookie contract. From there, the extension will kick in with a starting salary of somewhere around $28.1 million for the 2021-22 season. And if he makes an All-NBA team or wins another top leaguewide honor this season, his annual salary would only rise more. \u201cIt\u2019s another challenge I\u2019m willing to take on,\u201d Adebayo said. \u201cI\u2019m all about helping this team win. If my individual accolades help, then I\u2019m for sure in.\u201d The Heat had until Dec. 21 to agree with Adebayo on an extension this season, or else would have had to table the matter until next summer. Miami has said the team\u2019s intention was to give Adebayo a new deal \u2014 the question was only when. By waiting until next summer, the Heat would have had more salary-cap flexibility. They\u2019ll still have plenty of space next summer, and the Heat have a history of swinging deals even when their spending power is limited. In the summer of 2019, when Miami had no cap space, they found a way to secure Jimmy Butler \u2014 who wanted to come to the Heat, in part, because of the chance to play alongside Adebayo. The 6-foot-10 Adebayo is coming off the best season of his career. He was an All-Star for the first time, won the skills competition at All-Star weekend, had the game-saving block of a Jayson Tatum dunk attempt in the final seconds of Miami\u2019s Game 1 win over Boston in the Eastern Conference finals and made the NBA\u2019s All-Defensive team. Adebayo got hurt in the NBA Finals \u2014 a six-game loss to the Los Angeles Lakers \u2014 as did Heat point guard Goran Dragic. Both are healthy now, and the Heat are bringing back much of the core from the team that won the East. \u201cI want to get back there and I want to do something special for the city,\u201d Adebayo said, speaking Tuesday night at a Thanksgiving holiday giveaway where he was distributing turkeys to families. When this deal is done, he\u2019ll become the fourth member of the 2017 NBA draft class to secure a max extension, the others being Sacramento\u2019s De\u2019Aaron Fox, Utah\u2019s Donovan Mitchell and Tatum. Adebayo averaged 15.2 points, 10.2 rebounds and 5.1 assists this past season. Only one other player in the league had those numbers \u2014 two-time reigning MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo of the Milwaukee Bucks, with whom Adebayo shares an agent. And no player in Heat history ever finished a season with those averages in all three categories, until Adebayo. \u201cThey going to push you no matter what, whether you\u2019ve got 160 M\u2019s or you\u2019ve got 1.5. We all get treated the same and that\u2019s what I love about this organization,\u201d Adebayo said. He told The Associated Press during the NBA\u2019s restart earlier this summer at Walt Disney World that his lone financial goal is to take care of his mother, Marilyn Blount. She raised him by herself in North Carolina, making about $15,000 a year from her multiple jobs and with them calling a single-wide trailer their home. \u201cThat competitive nature comes out when I feel like I\u2019m playing bad and when things aren\u2019t going right,\u201d Adebayo said in the September interview with AP. \u201cI think about how she fought through struggle. \u2026 You see that for 18 years straight, you take that load on and feel that responsibility. And my responsibility is to provide for my mom, and the best way to make sure I can do that is to help us win.\u201d His first plan: to buy his mom a house, wherever she wants. \u201cTo know that she\u2019s set for life is a real stress-reliever for me,\u201d Adebayo said."},{"id":421896,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/reports-jae-crowder-leaves-miami-heat-for-phoenix-suns","date":"2020-11-28","title":"Jae Crowder signs with Suns","content":"Jae Crowder has officially signed a contract with the Phoenix Suns, the team announced.

And then things get really interesting, with the Phoenix Suns adding Paul and the Golden State Warriors getting Stephen Curry back. They\u2019re joined on a tier by the Memphis Grizzlies and New Orleans Pelicans, two squads that were surprisingly competitive last season. At least two of those teams are going to miss the playoffs.

But none more so than the nine teams with new head coaches for 2020-21. Nearly a third of the league\u2019s teams will have new faces, which means new philosophies, new tactics and new relationships. They range from known quantities such as Doc Rivers in Philadelphia and Stan Van Gundy in New Orleans to newbies getting big opportunities, like Houston\u2019s Stephen Silas, Indiana\u2019s Nate Bjorkgren, and Oklahoma City\u2019s Mark Daigneault. There\u2019s even an enshrined Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer, about to work with two current stars still working to put up numbers and accolades worthy of Springfield. The \u201cnew nine\u201d are eager to get going, to speed up their various learning curves in this ready-or-not ramp-up to Opening Night Dec. 22. Here are rundowns on each team and the biggest challenges they face: Last season: 35-37, 7th in the East. Swept in first round by Toronto. This season: The roster is set and stars Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving are said to be healthy, so Nash\u2019s two biggest tasks in his new gig as an NBA head coach are a) determining the style of play that best suits these Nets and b) nurturing a chemistry around some strong personalities, facing high expectations, in heavy media glare. The staff Nash has assembled should help him on both fronts, with big-brain and\/or big-rep folks such as Mike D\u2019Antoni, Jacques Vaughn, Ime Udoka and Amar\u2019e Stoudemire not necessarily pushing the \u201cseven seconds or less\u201d style in which the new coach thrived in Phoenix. Durant and Irving might realize their reputations and legacies are very much in play, highly dependent on the success of this Brooklyn experiment. Last season: 22-43, 11th in the East. This season: Donovan is a huge upgrade in credibility for the Bulls, not just because of his coaching resume but because he was the first big move by the front office newcomers who\u2019ve been flipped the keys by ownership: VP of basketball operations Arturas Karnisovas and GM Marc Eversley. Much of last season\u2019s underperforming roster is intact, which sets the Bulls up as something of an IROC auto racing experiment . That\u2019s the series in which identical cars were lined up, allowing the drivers\u2019 skills to separate winners from losers. Chicago fans have had this young core sold to them for a while now, so compared to the most recent washout season under Donovan\u2019s predecessor Jim Boylen, it at least will be interesting to see what a different cook can do with nearly identical groceries (Zach LaVine, Lauri Markkanen, Wendell Carter, Coby White). Bonus task: Demonstrating why a player who never started a game in college, Florida State\u2019s Patrick Williams, wound up as the No. 4 pick in the Draft . Last season: 44-28, 4th in the West. Lost in conference semifinals, 4-1, to the Lakers. This season: Silas has the backing of multitudes inside and outside the Rockets organization, which serves as a reminder that this is no quick-turnaround situation. Oh, there\u2019s still significant talent. But part of Silas\u2019 and new GM Rafael Stone\u2019s agenda involves walking back Houston\u2019s small-ball style. Additions of bigs such as DeMarcus Cousins and Christian Wood make it clear the front office wants Silas to have a more complete toolbox. Shifting gears for that, while adding some actions in what largely had been a free-style offense, will take familiarity and time. This is a job Silas has been prepping for his whole life \u2013 growing up as Paul Silas\u2019 son assured that \u2013 and having John Lucas at his side adds heft. Last season: 45-28, 4th in the East. Swept in the first round by Miami. This season: Bjorkgren\u2019s career arc resembles that of his former boss in Toronto, Nick Nurse, which is good. One big difference is that his rookie season in the top job won\u2019t include an acquisition anywhere close to Kawhi Leonard, the way Nurse\u2019s did. That\u2019s not so good. Bjorkgren inherits Indiana\u2019s best player, Victor Oladipo, in a down cycle \u2013 his game still stunted by his quadriceps tear and year layoff. One of them, coach or player, fully getting on the other\u2019s page is essential. In sheer Xs & Os, Bjorkgren has marching orders to modernize the team\u2019s style at both ends from Nate McMillan\u2019s tried-and-true approach. That means picking up the pace, shooting more 3-pointers (dead last in 2019-20) and getting more creative with zone and switching defenses. Last season: 49-23, 2nd in the West. Lost in the conference semifinals to Denver, 4-3. This season: As one of two new coaches to get promoted from within (OKC\u2019s Mark Daigneault is the other), Lue allegedly has the advantages and the disadvantages of moving one seat over on his team\u2019s bench. He was on the inside to see what worked and what did not. Then again, in theory he emptied his tank suggesting ways to improve the outcome in real time and thus has little new to offer. How will Lue be less like Doc Rivers? That\u2019s not an easy question to answer productively. But what worked for him in Cleveland when he took over midway through 2015-16 for David Blatt was he sharply defined everyone\u2019s role and even challenged stars LeBron James, Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love in specific ways to earn locker-room respect. Given the leadership and chemistry issues that got the Clippers sideways, demanding more and better from Kawhi Leonard and Paul George will certainly be on Lue\u2019s punch list. The whole squad needs to play 2020-21 with the bitter taste in its mouth of that blown 3-1 lead to the Nuggets. Last season: 30-42, 13th in the West. This season: Van Gundy was considered a popular choice by Pelicans fans, because he\u2019s a familiar name and because things soured for Alvin Gentry when the team went 2-6 in the bubble restart and missed the playoffs. There are three primary to-do items for the veteran coach. One is on him \u2013 show he can coach a faster-paced offense than his team historically have run, fully tapping into the skills of Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram and Zion Williamson. One is on the players \u2013 hitch up their pants and play the tenacious defense for which Van Gundy\u2019s teams typically have been known (the arrival of center Steven Adams should help here). Then there\u2019s No. 3, probably the task on which Van Gundy ultimately will be judged: Nurture and challenge Williamson to be the most versatile, freak-of-nature performer he can be, which means better ball skills and a full repertoire of offensive moves. Last season: 21-45, 12th in the East. This season: As the initial smoke of free agency cleared, the Knicks had shown a sober approach. No style-over-substance marketing ploy like bringing back Carmelo Anthony, no spending of outrageous sums just because they were there. That means new bench boss Thibodeau will roll up his sleeves for some roster development whether he likes it or not. At his previous stops in Chicago (Derrick Rose, Joakim Noah, Luol Deng), Thibs had stars hitting their prime or obviously on the way up. Ditto in Minnesota with Jimmy Butler and No. 1 overall picks Karl-Anthony Towns and Andrew Wiggins. The Knicks at this stage have a roster full of role players. Aside from draft picks Obi Toppin and Immanuel Quickley, the newcomers are journeymen such as Alec Burks, Austin Rivers, Nerlens Noel and returnee Elfrid Payton. They all will be entrusted with mentoring, maybe challenging, younger counterparts. Can Thibs\u2019 molars survive a gap year? That might be the No. 1 question. Last season: 44-28, 5th in the West. Lost in the first round to Houston, 4-3. This season: Coaches love it when their teams have a bunch of high draft picks, players with demonstrated potential and in some cases a glimmer of stardom waiting to be tapped. Coaches don\u2019t love it when those high draft picks are sitting behind glass, unpicked, awaiting a future that might not arrive in time to boost a fella\u2019s W-L record. But Daigneault is a team player, with seven years in the Thunder organization and now the first NBA G League coach to ascend to that job with the parent NBA team. At 35, he\u2019s considered bright and \u201cmodern,\u201d perfect to be tabbed by GM Sam Presti as the Thunder\u2019s fourth coach. Mostly, that means ready and willing to take on the losses inevitable in OKC\u2019s rebuild. If Chris Paul, Dennis Schroder, Steven Adams and Danilo Gallinari still were around, we\u2019d learn more about Daigneault\u2019s coaching chops. Then again, he wouldn\u2019t have the job. Last season: 43-30, sixth in the East. Swept out of the first round by Boston. This season: Rivers didn\u2019t wait long after his dismissal by the Clippers, landing in Philadelphia within a week. That might raise some eyebrows among the team\u2019s diehard fans, because it didn\u2019t allow for much of a vetting process of last season\u2019s issues in Clippersland. Leadership and chemistry were in question as that team collapsed in the West semis vs. Denver, not unlike issues that have dogged Philadelphia the past couple seasons. Maybe Rivers\u2019 upbeat demeanor will resonate on fresh ears and he\u2019ll get the buy-in this operation needs from stars Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons.

Those concerns kept him from the NBA\u2019s restart bubble. They won\u2019t keep him from this season. Bradley has finalized his new contract with the Miami Heat \u2014 the team he would have faced off against in the NBA Finals had he gone to the bubble at Walt Disney World this summer with his previous team, the Los Angeles Lakers. And when the Heat open camp next week in advance of the Dec. 22 start of the regular season, Bradley said he\u2019ll be ready. \u201cI mean, this is the new normal,\u201d said Bradley, who wore a mask for his first media session as a member of the Heat on Tuesday \u2014 a call held over Zoom. \u201cMy decision right now is to just focus on playing. That\u2019s my focus. I feel like everyone has a better idea of this virus; obviously, there\u2019s still some unknowns. But my decision not to go to the bubble just was about the impact on my family.\u201d Bradley and his wife sat down this past June, weighed the pros and cons, and he ultimately decided not to take the risk . The Lakers beat the Heat for the NBA title in six games; the Lakers also gave Bradley their blessing to exercise his right to not play, something that the league and the National Basketball Players Association agreed was an appropriate option to offer players before going to the bubble. This season won\u2019t be held in a bubble. Teams will be on planes, in hotels, playing road games again. There will be risks, though the league is still working on health and safety protocols that will be designed to mitigate those risks as much as possible. \u201cObviously, it\u2019s going to be a unique start of this season and some new things that we\u2019re going to have to get used to, but I\u2019m ready for it,\u201d Bradley said. \u201cWe\u2019re just going to try to navigate through it as best as we can.\u201d Miami becomes Bradley\u2019s sixth team.

He has viewed Miami as the place he\u2019d like to play for some time. \u201cWe all know what it means to be a Miami Heat player, the passion and the dedication it takes to be a part of this culture,\u201d Bradley said. \u201cAnd I always felt like if I ever got an opportunity to play here, then I would fit in perfect. \u2026 It\u2019s here now, and I\u2019m going to make sure I take advantage of it. I\u2019m prepared and I\u2019m excited about it because I do feel like a perfect fit.\u201d"},{"id":425856,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/memphis-pays-homage-to-its-music-history-with-city-edition-uniforms","date":"2020-11-25","title":"Memphis pays homage to its music history with City uniform","content":"Memphis has a rich history of soul and music that has long shaped the city.

The Kings had 48 hours to match the Hawks\u2019 offer, which was reportedly for four years and $72 million. With recent extensions for guards De\u2019Aaron Fox and Buddy Hield already on the books, Sacramento declined. Instead, Bogdanovic will become part of a rapidly evolving Atlanta roster that also includes veteran forward Danilo Gallinari and 2020 sixth overall pick Onyeka Okongwu. The Serbian swingman had been part of a reported sign-and-trade deal to the Bucks last week before that move fell apart. \u201cBogdan has a great feel for the game, and we expect him to be a great fit for us with his high-level offensive skill set, experience and toughness,\u201d Hawks general manager Travis Schlenk said in a team statement. \u201cIt\u2019s no secret that one of our biggest areas of focus in free agency was adding shooting and quality depth. With Bogdan as part of our incoming group, we feel those are now areas of strength.\u201d Last season, Bogdanovic averaged 15.1 points while shooting 37.2% from 3-point range while also adding 3.4 rebounds and 3.4 assists per game. He became a starter for the Kings in January, supplanting Hield before Sacramento ultimately fell short of the playoffs during bubble play in Orlando. With All-Star guard Trae Young leading the way, the Hawks have their sights set firmly on their first playoff appearance since 2017. Young averaged 29.6 points and 9.3 assists, but he was a big liability at the defensive end and the offense struggled to create scoring chances anytime he took a breather. Bogdanovic figures to make Young even more effective, giving Atlanta another weapon at shooting guard. Gallinari also provides a bit of insurance with young forward John Collins heading into his final year before restricted free agency and reportedly looking to land a max contract that the Hawks may be reluctant to hand out. Atlanta will have a completely new look at center with Okongwu and expected starter Clint Capela, who was acquired from Houston last season at the trade deadline but was injured and never got on the court with Atlanta before the season shut down. This is exactly what the Hawks had in mind when they began a major overhaul in 2017, only two years removed from a surprising 60-win season and run to the Eastern Conference final. Schlenk stuck to his plan of building first through the draft, hoarding young talent while taking on big-money contracts that would come off the books about the time he thought his squad was ready to make a major leap forward.

The Hawks announced on Tuesday that they had acquired free agent forward Danilo Gallinari and cash considerations from Oklahoma City in exchange for a conditional 2025 second-round pick in a sign-and-trade transaction. \u201cDanilo checks a lot of boxes for what we have prioritized. We wanted to add productive veterans and high-level shooting to our group and he provides both. At his size, he is one of the league\u2019s most versatile and efficient scorers and he has proven to be the type of veteran you want in your locker room,\u201d said Hawks President of Basketball Operations and General Manager Travis Schlenk. The 6-foot-10 sharp-shooting forward will provide an immediate target for All-Star guard Trae Young, who ranked second in the league in assists per game (9.3) last season. Gallinari averaged 18.7 points while shooting 40.5% from 3-point range in his lone season with the Thunder. The 32-year-old Italian has been relatively healthy in each of the last two seasons after an initially injury-riddled career. Gallinari adds an immediate veteran presence to a Hawks team that often featured a full starting lineup of players younger than 25 years. And though Young achieved All-Star status in just his second year in the league, Atlanta failed to win at least 30% of its games for the second time in the last three seasons. The Hawks have also signed restricted free agent swingman Bogdan Bogdanovic to a four-year, $72-million offer deal after the Kings declined to match their restricted free agent offer sheet. They also added Rajon Rondo and Kris Dunn in the offseason as well. Adding Bogdanovic, Gallinari, Rondo, Dunn and rookie Onyeka Okongwu to a promising core of Young, John Collins, De\u2019Andre Hunter, Kevin Huerter and Cam Reddish \u2014 all first-round picks the previous three years \u2014 suddenly makes the Hawks one of the Eastern Conference\u2019s most intriguing teams.

For a few other Eastern Conference teams \u2014 the Chicago Bulls, Indiana Pacers and Orlando Magic \u2014 the last eight days have been pretty quiet. A couple of Draft picks, an end-of-the-roster trade and only the smallest bites in free agency. The most important decision of this abbreviated offseason is the one in the hands of the two-time reigning Kia MVP. And if Giannis Antetokounmpo chooses not to sign his contract extension (he has until Dec. 21), things will take a dramatic turn in a few select markets around the league.

A two-time All-Defensive team honoree, Holiday shot 45.5% overall and 35.3% from 3-point range last season. The 30-year-old guard has averaged 19 points or better in each of the last three seasons.

Here are some key moves from today:  See below for all of the reported deals from Day 4. DeMarcus Cousins is reportedly ready to restart his career in Houston. Multiple reports have the former All-Star big man joining the Rockets on a one-year deal. Cousins has not played since an injury-abbreviated 2018-19 season with Golden State in which he averaged 16.3 points and 8.2 rebounds in 30 regular season games. The production was encouraging given that Cousins was coming off a torn Achilles tendon suffered the previous season with New Orleans. But the versatile 6-foot-10 center\u2019s return was cut short by a torn quadriceps in the first round of the 2019 playoffs, keeping him sidelined until the Finals. Cousins signed with the Lakers the following season, only to the suffer a torn ACL during preseason workouts that cost him the entire 2019-20 campaign. The fifth overall pick in the 2010 Draft and a four-time All-Star, Cousins has played in just 78 regular season games over the last three seasons. His arrival comes at a pivotal time for the Rockets, who are working through reported trade requests by superstar guards James Harden and Russell Westbrook. Houston will also reportedly sign 25-year-old free agent forward Christian Wood . \u2014 6:45 p.m.   The Cleveland Cavaliers have agreed to a 1-year deal with free agent guard Matthew Dellavedova, according to reports from Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN and Marc Stein of The New York Times . The veteran guard averaged 3.1 points and 3.2 assists over 57 games with Cleveland last season. \u2014 3:53 p.m.  The Toronto Raptors continue to add to their frontline in the wake of Marc Gasol\u2019s departure, agreeing to a deal with former lottery pick Alex Len. The former No. 5 overall pick of the 2013 draft split last season between the Atlanta Hawks and Sacramento Kings, averaging 8 points and 5.8 rebounds in 55 total games (15 with Sacramento, 40 with Atlanta). \u2014 2:52 p.m.  Markieff Morris says he will be back for another go around with the Lakers in 2020-21. Morris took to Twitter on Monday, writing \u201cRun it back!\u201d He was a key reserve on L.A.\u2019s championship squad from 2019-20, acquired for the stretch run on Feb. 23 after he was waived by the Detroit Pistons. Morris appeared in 14 regular-season games (averaging 5.3 points and 3.2 rebounds) and 21 playoff games (5.9 ppg, 3.0 rpg), providing rebounding and scoring punch for the Lakers. Per Shams Charania of The Athletic, Morris\u2019 deal is for one year at the league minimum. \u2014 12:28 p.m.  The Cleveland Cavaliers have reportedly added former New York Knicks guard Damyean Dotson to the fold, reports ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski. Dotson has agreed to a two-year deal with the Cavs after averaging 6.7 points, 1.9 rebounds and 1.2 assists in 48 games with New York in 2019-20. A former second-round pick in 2017, Dotson will join a Cavs backcourt that features Collin Sexton and Darius Garland. \u2014 12:21 p.m.  Atlanta has put a premium on adding veterans to its mix this offseason and that trend continued Monday with the reported addition of Solomon Hill. ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski reports Hill has agreed to a one-year deal with the Hawks after splitting last season with the Memphis Grizzlies and Miami Heat. Hill came to the Heat in the Andre Iguodala trade and appeared in 11 regular-season games and seven playoff games for the defending Eastern Conference champions. Hill joins an Atlanta frontcourt that includes Clint Capela, John Collins and Danilo Gallinari, who reportedly agreed to a deal with the Hawks over the weekend. \u2014 11:54 a.m.  The Phoenix Suns have not been bashful in the offseason in adding new talent to their mix. But they\u2019re also not about to let a key performer from last season walk away, either, it seems. Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN reports forward Dario Saric and the Suns have agreed on a three-year deal that keeps him with Phoenix. Saric averaged 10.7 points, 6.2 rebounds and 1.9 assists in 66 games (51 starts) in what was his first season with the Suns after he landed there via an offseason trade by the Philadelphia 76ers. Exactly one week ago today, the Suns pulled of a trade with the Oklahoma City Thunder that netted them All-Star point guard Chris Paul. Since free agency opened, they have reportedly reached deals with free agents Jae Crowder, E\u2019Twaun Moore and Damian Jones while also bringing back reserve guard Jevon Carter to a core that is lead by Paul and All-Star guard Devin Booker. \u2014 10:38 a.m. "},{"id":422102,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/reports-rajon-rondo-to-sign-with-atlanta-hawks","date":"2020-11-23","title":"Rajon Rondo signs with Hawks","content":"Veteran point guard Rajon Rondo has officially signed a multi-year deal with the Atlanta Hawks, the team announced on Monday.

The 29-year-old Favors started in 49 of the 51 games he played for New Orleans, averaging a career-high 9.8 rebounds in just 24.4 minutes per game. Now, it appears one year apart was more than enough for both Favors and the Jazz, who are eager to bolster their depth after a disappointing first-round exit to the Denver Nuggets. Favors could revert to a bench role in Utah behind All-Star center Rudy Gobert and Bogdan Bogdanovic, potentially joining Joe Ingles and Jordan Clarkson to form one of the more productive reserve units in the league. Clarkson officially re-signed with Utah on Monday, reportedly for four years and $52 million. Acquired midseason in a trade with Cleveland, the 6-foot-4 combo guard provided immediate scoring off the bench for a Jazz team in desperate need of it.

The 6-foot-7 big man has outperformed all expectations since being drafted 32nd overall by Houston in 2015, but is coming off a poor playoff performance in which he averaged less than 20 minutes per contest. This move would bolster an already productive offseason for the Lakers, who acquired another Sixth Man candidate in Dennis Schroder via trade with Oklahoma City earlier this week. Los Angeles has also come to a reported agreement with free agent swingman Wesley Matthews. Davis\u2019 free agency, meanwhile, remains a top priority for the defending champs. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope\u2019s free agent status is also up in the air."},{"id":422321,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-lakers-re-signing-caldwell-pope","date":"2020-11-23","title":"Lakers re-sign guard Kentavious Caldwell-Pope","content":"The Los Angeles Lakers are bringing back Kentavious Caldwell-Pope on a three-year, $40 million contract, per Shams Charania of The Athletic.

That interest has paid off in the form of a reported three-year, $60 million contract with the rapidly rebuilding Detroit Pistons, which was consumated via sign-and-trade with Denver on Sunday. Detroit will also acquire the draft rights to 2015 second-round pick Nikola Radicevic, while the Nuggets will receive cash considerations. Grant\u2019s combination of defense, athleticism and 3-point shooting (38.9% last season) make him one of the more versatile forwards in the league. Detroit is in the midst of an offseason overhaul under the direction of new general manager Troy Weaver. The Pistons have already come to reported agreements to sign Jahlil Okafor, Mason Plumlee and Josh Jackson. Earlier this week the team drafted point guard Killian Hayes seventh overall and traded shooting guard Luke Kennard to the Clippers as part of a multi-team deal that landed them 19th overall pick Saddiq Bey, Rodney McGruder and others.

Well, that extended to the first weekend of 2020 free agency, where Michael Jordan will give Gordon Hayward more in four years than His Airness made in his entire career. Yes, while this free-agent crop lacks marquee players, that hasn\u2019t discouraged teams from paying marquee money. Call it the High Cost Of Pretty Good Players, where the likes of Hayward and Davis Bertans cashed in and made the best of a market that followed the rules of supply and demand anyway. What didn\u2019t happen over the weekend was contracts for Anthony Davis and Brandon Ingram, the two biggest names, mainly because everyone expects them to re-up with the Lakers and Pelicans. Also, the crazy saga of Kings swingman Bogdan Bogdanovic will get sorted out very soon, now that he signed an offer sheet from the Hawks . Meanwhile, at least a half-dozen teams are holding firm with their money, saving up for next offseason when Kawhi Leonard, Paul George and maybe the big whale, Giannis Antetokounmpo, are scheduled to hit free agency. Here\u2019s the top 20 signings so far based on scope of contract, level of surprise and potential impact: 1. Gordon Hayward to the Hornets: Hayward hadn\u2019t caused this level of fuss since barely missing the championship-winning buzzer-beater against Duke in college. The Hornets are making a habit of overpaying: Bismack Biyombo, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, Nicolas Batum, Cody Zeller, Terry Rozier. Oh, well: Michael Jordan will simply hike the price of Air Jordans. Anyway, at four years and a reported $120 million, who knows, Hayward might revert to being the Utah Gordon Hayward. He\u2019ll help \u2026 but wow. 2. Montrezl Harrell to the Lakers: Basketball fans in L.A. want to know which Trez the defending champs are getting. Is it the high-motor worker who hustled for inside buckets the last few seasons? Or the undersized big who was dreadfully exposed in the playoff bubble? Yes, the Lakers did steal him from the LA Clippers, and he doesn\u2019t need to guard many centers with Anthony Davis around, but he got far less money and years than he envisioned after winning the Kia Sixth Man of the Year award, which means the league was cool on him. 3. Danilo Gallinari to the Hawks. This was the big head-scratcher after Hayward. Why did the Hawks commit so much (three years, $61 million) to someone who plays the same position as John Collins, who\u2019s nine years younger, better all-around and due a significant contract extension? Gallo will at least rescue an inefficient shooting team that\u2019s still waiting on Kevin Huerter and Cam Reddish \u2026 and a verdict on Bogdanovic. 4. Christian Wood to the Rockets. He\u2019s a rags-to-riches story and the most intriguing of all free agent signings. Now that Wood has left the Pistons, securing the bag (three years, $41 million) and a meatier role \u2014 he\u2019ll compliment James Harden and Russell Westbrook assuming they\u2019ll stick around \u2014 the undrafted big man must demonstrate he wasn\u2019t a tease last season (13.1 points, 6.3 rebounds per game). 5. Serge Ibaka to the Clippers. He\u2019s more versatile and brings better shooting as the replacement for Harrell. He\u2019s also a proven fit in the pick and pop. You wonder, though, how much less of a defender he\u2019ll be at an age (31) when that skill begins to decline. 6. Fred VanVleet staying with the Raptors. This wasn\u2019t much of a surprise; VanVleet was destined gets paid (four years, $85 million) by the Raptors and the combo guard loves Toronto. Still, you wonder how he\u2019d have fit in Atlanta next to Trae Young (instead of Rajon Rondo), Dallas next to Luka Doncic or given the keys to the New York Knicks. 7. Rajon Rondo to the Hawks. This is a somewhat sensible addition to the Hawks but not without some questions. While he\u2019ll be a good tutor for Young, Rondo can\u2019t play off the ball, so the two can\u2019t be on the floor for long stretches. Also, with Atlanta reportedly adding Kris Dunn, too, the Hawks now have three point guards \u2026 and only one can shoot. 8. Davis Bertans staying with the Wizards. Just repeat to yourself \u201cit\u2019s not my money\u201d and this reported five-year, $80 million contract extension suddenly makes sense. Bertans only does one thing well, but shooting range is highly valued, and he\u2019s one of the best high-volume shooters in the game (42.4 percent on 8.7 3-point attempts per game). That said, if the Wizards won\u2019t have a healthy John Wall and Bradley Beal back, Bertans won\u2019t make a big difference. 9. Joe Harris staying with the Nets. It\u2019s a rich deal (four years, $75 million) for someone who\u2019s a secondary option, but the Nets have championship dreams and Harris will get plenty of open looks next to Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving. 10. Jerami Grant to the Pistons. He won this three-year, $60 million contract with his sparkling play in the bubble, an astonishing rise by a career role player. While Grant is a solid defender, the analytics people have convinced him to abandon his inside game \u2014 where he once flourished \u2014 in favor of falling in love with the 3-pointer. 11. Rookie max deals. Kings guard De\u2019Aaron Fox has gotten better each year, is quick, pushes the ball and brings an improved jumper. But a $163-million max extension is a steep price for a potential All-Star (he\u2019s not there yet). There are less questions about already-stars Donovan Mitchell, who\u2019ll sign the max in Utah , and Jayson Tatum, who will do the same in Boston . 12. Wesley Matthews to the Lakers. Matthews cashed in four years ago when the Mavericks overpaid him, so money wasn\u2019t as big of a motivator as the chance to play next to LeBron and Davis and get plenty of open looks. The Lakers hope he works out a lot better than the dreadful Danny Green experience. 13. Tristan Thompson to the Celtics. If reports about the Celtics declining a sign-and-trade involving the Pacers and Myles Turner for Gordon Hayward were correct, then Turner would\u2019ve been a better option than Thompson. Anyway, Thompson brings grit and a scent for rebounds to a team loaded with finesse players. 14. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope staying with the Lakers. KCP came up large during The Finals, so of course he was staying. The Lakers, Klutch Sports and LeBron have been very good for him and his bank account. 15. Jae Crowder to the Suns. Crowder wanted multiple years, which the Heat weren\u2019t offering because they want to keep money next year in case they can get Giannis Antetokounmpo. Phoenix isn\u2019t a bad alternative for a solid 3-point shooter and defender. The Suns are onto something. 16. Kris Dunn to the Hawks. He might be the best defensive point guard in the NBA, which makes him valuable to the Hawks because Young is one of the worst. If you could fuse their talents together you\u2019d have an Kia MVP contender. 17. Marcus Morris stays with the Clippers. Whenever a team surrenders assets for a player headed to free agency \u2014 the Clippers gave the Knicks a No. 1 pick for Morris last spring \u2014 it always backfires in negotiations. That team loses all leverage because it has to sign that player to justify the trade. The Clippers rewarded Morris (four years, $64 million) for overcoming a poor start in L.A. with solid play in the bubble. 18. Derrick Jones Jr. to the Blazers. A young, athletic wing and ferocious finisher at the rim, he\u2019s part of a reloading project that gave the Blazers some much needed depth. Portland also re-signed Carmelo Anthony and Rodney Hood and traded for Robert Covington and Enes Kanter. 19. Jordan Clarkson stays with the Jazz. Clarkson\u2019s career was in danger of falling off a cliff just a year ago. Then he joined the Jazz, gave them a big scoring boost off the bench and cashed in at four years and $52 million. What a turnaround. 20. Goran Dragic stays with the Heat. As Dragic said, teammate Jimmy Butler threatened his life had he signed elsewhere. Anyway, Dragic knows he\u2019ll be in Miami beyond this guaranteed season; the player and team are a good fit. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

The Trail Blazers have acquired forward Robert Covington from the Houston Rockets in exchange for Trevor Ariza, the draft rights to Isaiah Stewart and a conditional future first round pick, it was announced Sunday by Portland president of basketball operations Neil Olshey. Covington, acquired from Minnesota in the middle of last season, averaged 11.6 points, 8.0 rebounds, 2.2 blocks and 1.6 steals in 22 regular-season games with the Rockets. The 6-foot-7 forward often held down the middle at center, a necessity with Houston opting for a \u201csmall-ball\u201d lineup that featured no traditional big man. That experiment, however, ended with a Western Conference semifinals loss to the eventual-champion Los Angeles Lakers. Now, with new general manager Rafael Stone and head coach Stephen Silas in place, the Rockets face a future of uncertainty. James Harden and Russell Westbrook each reportedly wants out of Houston, though other reports describe the Rockets as willing to keep both All-Star guards for the 2020-21 season. Covington, meanwhile, will reinforce a once-injury-ravaged Blazers frontcourt that could not hold up against the Lakers in the first round of the 2020 playoffs. The 29-year-old joins Jusuf Nurkic and Zach Collins in that rotation, providing further support for Portland\u2019s long-time backcourt duo Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum. Hassan Whiteside and Carmelo Anthony, both unrestricted free agents, could also return. Ariza will return to Houston for a second stint after being part of contending Rockets teams from 2014-2018. After bouncing round the league since then, the veteran swingman found his stride in Portland, where he shot 40 percent from 3-point range after the Kings traded him mid-season."},{"id":420823,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/wesley-matthews-to-sign-with-lakers","date":"2020-11-22","title":"Wesley Matthews signs one-year deal with Lakers","content":"Free agent guard Wesley Matthews has signed a one-year deal with the Los Angeles Lakers, the team announced on Sunday .

Meyers Leonard ended last season wanting a second run with the Heat. As such, their time as free agents didn\u2019t last long. Dragic and Leonard have both decided to return to the reigning Eastern Conference champions, each telling The Associated Press on Friday evening that they have agreed to accept Miami\u2019s offer of two-year deals to remain with the Heat. The second year is a team option on both contracts. Dragic\u2019s deal will be worth about $18 million for this season. Leonard agreed to a deal that will pay him around $9 million this season. The team officially signed Dragic on Sunday. \u201cHappy to be back,\u201d Dragic told AP . \u201cThat was my plan, to come back, but in this crazy business you never know.\u201d With Dragic and Leonard back, and with Udonis Haslem announcing last week that he will return for an 18th season \u2014 he did that before the Heat could even talk to him, though it is clear that they\u2019ll want the Miami native and three-time champion back for as long as he wants to keep playing \u2014 Miami is well on its way to team president Pat Riley\u2019s and coach Erik Spoelstra\u2019s goal of bringing back last season\u2019s team as close to intact as possible. The Heat won the East as a No. 5 seed last season, Jimmy Butler\u2019s first year in Miami and a year where the team\u2019s young core \u2013All-Star Bam Adebayo, Duncan Robinson, Tyler Herro and Kendrick Nunn \u2014 all blossomed at once. \u201cI wanted nothing more than to come back to Miami. Literally nothing more,\u201d Leonard told The AP . \u201cI felt so damn blessed to feel at home right away and feel that way all year long. From top to bottom, Pat to Spo, Jimmy to Bam, Goran to UD and the rest of my teammates, something just felt so right. There\u2019s just no other way to put it.\u201d Dragic will be entering his seventh season with the Heat and is coming off a year where he averaged 16.2 points while playing off the bench in the regular season. He became a starter again in the playoffs and tore his plantar fascia in Game 1 of the NBA Finals against the Los Angeles Lakers, an injury that hurt Miami\u2019s chances. The Heat surprised Dragic with billboards in his native Slovenia in recent days, with slogans such as \u201cYour second family is always with you.\u201d That gesture, Dragic said, was deeply moving. \u201cI was in the car with my wife and her brother and they drove me past those billboards,\u201d Dragic said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know. They told me nothing. They just said, \u2018Look to the right.\u2019 And when I saw myself, saw what they said, it really touched my heart. This is my home. I want to stay here in Miami. I appreciate Pat Riley, Andy Elisburg, the whole organization and what they did for me.\u201d Leonard averaged 6.1 points for the Heat this past season, starting for much of the regular season. He said he had no desire last year to try to put up big numbers in a contract year, deciding instead to simply focus on doing whatever it took for Miami to win games. He hoped that would be enough for the Heat to want him back. It was. \u201cIt feels good to be wanted, No. 1. But more to me, I am incredibly, incredibly thankful that the Heat appreciates Meyers Leonard as a total package,\u201d said Leonard, who intends to fly from his offseason base in Los Angeles back to Miami shortly. \u201cThe human being, the teammate, the player. Everything matters to them and that matters to me. I have found comfort in knowing exactly who I am as a person and as a player and I\u2019ve shown enough people exactly what that is and I\u2019m not changing for anybody.\u201d Also Friday, the Heat said Gabe Vincent signed his two-way qualifying offer."},{"id":423096,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-mitchell-agrees-to-5-year-195-million-extension-with-jazz","date":"2020-11-22","title":"Report: Mitchell agrees to 5-year, $195 million extension with Jazz","content":"Utah Jazz All-Star guard Donovan Mitchell has agreed to a five-year, $195 million designated rookie max extension, according to ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski.

Harrell averaged career-highs in per-game scoring (18.6) and rebounding (7.1) last season. \u2014 9:42 p.m. * * * ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski reports that Washington will sign forward Anthony Gill, who most recently played for Khimki Moscow Region, to a two-year deal. The 6-foot-8, 28-year-old Gill posted 8.3 points and 4.5 rebounds in 19 minutes across 25 Euroleague games (11 starts). \u2014 9:12 p.m. * * * Per ESPN\u2019s Tim MacMahon, guard Trey Burke is returning to the Mavericks on a three-year deal for roughly $10 million. \u2014 9:10 p.m. * * * Dwight Howard and the Philadelphia 76ers have reached an agreement on a one-year contract, agent Charles Briscoe tells Shams Charania of The Athletic. The eight-time All-Star center and 16-year NBA veteran is coming off a season of redemption with the Los Angeles Lakers, establishing himself as a reliable bench player. Howard averaged 7.5 points and 7.3 rebounds per game in the regular season, as well as 1.1 blocks. \u2014 9:05 p.m. * * * Atlanta appears ready to take a step up the Eastern Conference ladder. ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski reports that veteran forward Danilo Gallinari has agreed leave Oklahoma City and sign with the Atlanta Hawks for three years and $61.5 million. The 6-foot-10 sharp-shooting forward, now 32 years old, averaged 18.7 points while shooting 40.5% from 3-point range in his lone season with the Thunder. \u2014 8:55 p.m. * * * Shams Charania reported that the Timberwolves have reached agreement with restricted free agent Malik Beasley on a four-year $60 million deal. The midseason acquisition made a strong impression in a short time, averaging 20.7 points in 33. 1 minutes across 14 games after being unleashed following the trade from Denver. \u2014 8:49 p.m. * * * Per ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski, forward Rodney Hood will re-sign with the Blazers for two years and $21 million. After a strong playoff performance in Portland\u2019s 2019 run to the conference finals, Hood blew out his Achilles in December 2019 and missed the remainder of the 2019-20 season, including the Orlando restart. \u2014 8:40 p.m. * * * Per ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski, former No. 4 overall pick Josh Jackson (2017; Phoenix) has reportedly agreed to join his hometown Detroit Pistons. Traded to Memphis prior to last season, Jackson eventually settled into a bench role and posted career-best efficiency numbers while averaging 9.0 points and 3.0 rebounds in 17.3 minutes. \u2014 8:24 p.m. * * * After spending the majority of his career with the Jazz, Derrick Favors is reportedly ready for a reunion. The 29-year-old Favors started in 49 of the 51 games he played for New Orleans, averaging a career-high 9.8 rebounds in just 24.4 minutes per game. Favors could revert to a bench role in Utah behind All-Star center Rudy Gobert and Bogdan Bogdanovic, potentially joining Joe Ingles and Jordan Clarkson to form one of the more productive reserve units in the league. Clarkson is reportedly set to re-sign with Utah for four years and $52 million. \u2014 8:17 p.m. * * * Per ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski, forward Patrick Patterson will remain with LA on a one-year deal. The 10-year veteran averaged 4.9 points (39.0 3P%) in 13.5 minutes across 59 games, mostly off the bench. * * * Add another big man to the Detroit Pistons\u2019 growing cast of them. Jahlil Okafor, the former No. 3 overall pick of the 2015 draft, is reportedly headed to Detroit, per ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski . Okafor was an All-Rookie performer in 2015-16 with the Philadelphia 76ers after averaging 17.5 points, 7.0 rebounds, 1.2 assists and 1.2 blocks per game. But his numbers steadily declined as the Sixers shifted more in the direction of future All-Star center Joel Embiid. Okafor the past two seasons with the New Orleans Pelicans in a backup role, averaging 8.1 ppg, 4.2 rpg and 1.2 apg last season. He will join a Detroit roster that \u2014 provided all the reported deals go through \u2014 will have a frontline of Okafor, Mason Plumlee, Blake Griffin and Dewyane Dedmon. \u2014 7:08 p.m.  * * * Detroit has spent the early part of this offseason reshaping its roster, and that continued on Friday. Per ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski and others , former Denver Nuggets center Mason Plumlee has agreed to a three-year deal with the Pistons. Plumlee spent the last four seasons with Denver, averaging 7.2 points, 5.2 rebounds and 2.5 assists per game in 2019-20. A solid shot-blocker and paint defender, Plumlee will join new Pistons big man Dewayne Dedmon in a revamped center rotation. Plumlee\u2019s reported departure means the Nuggets must shift their attention to two other key frontcourt free agents on their roster: veteran Paul Millsap and youngster Jerami Grant. \u2014 6:47 p.m.  * * * Former Charlotte Hornets swingman Dwane Bacon has found a home in the same division, it seems. Bacon has reached a two-year deal with the Orlando Magic, reports Vincent Goodwill of Yahoo Sports , in a move that reunites him with his first coach in Charlotte, Steve Clifford. After averaging a career-best 7.3 points and 47.5% shooting in 2018-19 with the Hornets, Bacon\u2019s stats dipped last season (5.7 ppg, 34.8% FG) as he struggled offensively and, by February, was playing in the G League with the Greensboro Swarm. \u2014 6:40 p.m.  * * * The San Antonio Spurs are willing to keep investing in Drew Eubanks. ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski reports Eubanks and the Spurs have agreed to a three-year deal that will keep the former undrafted big man in San Antonio. He took a slight step forward in 2019-20, averaging 4.9 points and 3.8 rebounds in 12.4 minutes per game after posting 1.8 ppg and 1.5 rpg in just 4.9 mpg as a rookie in 2018-19. Eubanks was originally signed the Spurs on a two-way deal in September of 2018. \u2014 6:33 p.m.  * * * Veteran swingman Wes Matthews is reportedly headed back to the Western Conference. Shams Charania of The Athletic reports Matthews plans to sign with the Los Angeles Lakers in free agency after spending last season with the Milwaukee Bucks. He played and started in 67 games with the Bucks (all starts), he averaged 7.4 points, 2.5 rebounds and 1.4 assists per game while nailing 36.4% of his 3-pointers. A solid defender and career 38.1% 3-point shooter, Matthews would give the Lakers a capable outside presence and help space the floor for LeBron James and Anthony Davis. Matthews previously played for the Utah Jazz (2009-10), Portland Trail Blazers (2010-15), Dallas Mavericks (2015-18), New York Knicks (2018-19) and Indiana Pacers (2018-19) before joining the Bucks as a free agent in the summer of 2019. \u2014 6:30 p.m.  * * * The Denver Nuggets have agreed to a deal with 29-year-old guard Facundo Campazzo, ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski reports . Last season with Real Madrid, Campazzo averaged 9.6 points, 6.1 assists and 2.7 rebounds in nine games. He is known for his flashy, creative play and was once teammates with Dallas Mavericks star Luka Doncic when both players were on Real Madrid. Per The Denver Post \u2018s Mike Singer, Campazzo is expected to share backup point guard duties in Denver with Monte Morris. \u2014 6:26 p.m.  * * * Miami Heat point guard Goran Dragic is staying put in free agency. And while you\u2019re at it, take Meyers Leonard off the free-agent board as well. The veteran point guard posted a video on Twitter that he is staying with the Heat. Per Tim Reynolds of The Associated Press, the deal is for two years , with the second being at the Heat\u2019s option. As for Leonard, he told Reynolds he intends to sign a two-year deal with Miami with the second being at the team\u2019s option. Dragic has spent the last 5 1\/2 seasons with the Heat, becoming an All-Star in 2017-18. Last season, he was instrumental in Miami\u2019s run to The Finals as he averaged 16.2 points, 3.2 rebounds and 5.1 assists in the regular season. He upped those numbers in the playoffs to 19.1 ppg, 4.1 rpg and 4.4 apg. However, he was hobbled by a torn plantar fascia in his left foot suffered in the first half of Game 1 of The Finals. Leonard played his first season with the Heat in 2019-20 and also proved valuable. He averaged 6.1 ppg and 5.1 rpg as regular starter during the season. He was limited to three playoff games as he fell out of the Heat\u2019s rotation as the team opted to start Jae Crowder to give the team more versatility on the perimeter. \u2014 6:17 p.m. * * * In their quest to rise up the Western Conference, the Minnesota Timberwolves are welcoming back to a point guard from their recent past. Ricky Rubio, a former Timberwolves lottery pick who played for the team from 2011-17, is back on the team via a trade involving Minnesota, the Oklahoma City Thunder and New York Knicks. In the trade, Rubio and the Draft rights to Jaden McDaniels (No. 28 pick in 2020 Draft) head to the Timberwolves from the Thunder. The Draft rights to Leandro Bolmaro (No. 23 pick in 2020) also head over from the Knicks. Minnesota will send forward James Johnson, the Draft rights to Aleksej Pokusevski (No. 17 pick, 2020 Draft) and a 2024 second-round pick to the Thunder. Minnesota sends the Draft rights to Mathias Lessort (No. 50 pick, 2017 Draft) and Detroit\u2019s 2023 second-round pick to the Knicks while the Thunder send the Draft rights to Immanuel Quickley (No. 25 pick, 2020 Draft) to New York. The move had been reported in the wake of the 2020 Draft, but became official on Friday afternoon. In his six seasons with the Wolves, Rubio averaged 10.3 points, 8.5 assists 4.2 rebounds and 2.1 steals in 353 games. One of the team\u2019s more popular players, he was dealt to the Utah Jazz before the 2017-18 season and spent two seasons there. After that, he signed with the Phoenix Suns last season and was traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder in this offseason\u2019s blockbuster Chris Paul trade . \u2014 4:42 p.m.  * * * Enes Kanter is heading back to Portland after a one season hiatus, it seems. Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN reports the Boston Celtics are trading Kanter to the Trail Blazers as part of a three-way deal also involving the Memphis Grizzlies. In the reported deal, Memphis gets Mario Hezonja and the 30th pick in the 2020 Draft (Desmond Bane) while the Celtics get a future Draft consideration from the Grizzlies. Kanter left the Blazers as a free agent last summer to sign with Boston. Before that, he joined Portland in Feburary of 2019 after being waived by the New York Knicks. In Portland, both he and the team flourished as the Blazers made the Western Conference finals. Kanter averaged 13.1 points, 8.6 rebounds and 1.0 assists in 23 regular-season games, filling in for the injured Jusuf Nurkic. In the 2019 playoffs, he averaged 11.4 ppg and 9.7 rpg. Kanter reportedly opted into his contract for 2020-21 as of Thursday and, on Friday, was clearly happy about this trade. On Twitter, he posted a \u201chome\u201d emoji shortly after news of it broke. \u2014 3:50 p.m.  * * * Two teams with playoff aspirations in the Eastern Conference have made a trade to address some key needs. The Atlanta Hawks have sent center Dewayne Dedmon to the Detroit Pistons for guards Tony Snell and Khyri Thomas, the latter of whom was waived by Atlanta. The trade was first reported by ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski and confirmed by the teams today . The move frees up considerable salary cap room for the Hawks after shedding Dedmon, who is making $13.3 million this season. Snell will make $12.1 million in 2020-21, which is the final year of his contract, while Dedmon\u2019s $13.3 million for 2021-22 is non-guaranteed. Dedmon gives the Pistons a frontcourt presence and rebounder. He averaged 8.1 points and 8.2 rebounds in 10 games with the Hawks last season after being traded there by the Sacramento Kings on Feb. 6. Snell is a solid 3-point shooter, making 40.2% of those shots last season with the Pistons and is a career 38.5% shooter from 3-point range. \u2014 3:34 p.m.  * * * Guard Ky Bowman, who appeared in 45 games for Golden State in 2019-20, was waived by the team on Friday. Bowman averaged 7.4 points, 2.7 assists and 2.9 assists and 1 steal per game for the Warriors as a rookie last season. He started 12 games for Golden State and, per Charania, is expected to receive interest around the league. \u2014 2:28 p.m.  * * * A pair of second-year players in New Orleans will be hitting the open market, reports Andrew Lopez of ESPN . Forward Kenrich Williams and guard Frank Jackson will not get qualifying offers from the Pelicans and will be unrestricted free agents. Last season, Williams averaged 3.5 points, 4.8 rebounds and 1.5 assists in 39 games with the Pelicans, while Jackson, a guard, averaged 6.3 ppg, 1.4 rpg and 1.0 apg in 59 games. \u2014 2:18 p.m. "},{"id":419069,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-timberwolves-in-talks-to-add-ricky-rubio-in-trade","date":"2020-11-20","title":"Timberwolves reacquire Ricky Rubio in 3-team trade","content":"In their quest to rise up the Western Conference, the Minnesota Timberwolves are welcoming back to a point guard from their recent past.

The Raptors had been looking at other sites for several weeks, including Sunrise, Florida, the home of the NHL\u2019s Florida Panthers. But with NBA training camp less than two weeks away and a season starting on Dec. 22, the Raptors were pressed to make a final decision. Instead, they will play home games at Amalie Arena, home of the Stanley Cup champion Tampa Bay Lightning. \u201cUltimately, the current public health situation facing Canadians, combined with the urgent need to determine where we will play means that we will begin our 2020-21 season in Tampa, Florida,\u201d Raptors President Masai Ujiri said in a statement Friday . An official familiar with the Canadian government\u2019s decision told The Associated Press there is too much COVID-19 circulating in the United States to allow for cross-border travel that is not essential. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity and not authorized to talk publicly about the matter, said there\u2019s a chance that the decision could be reviewed next year. The Raptors, the NBA\u2019s lone Canadian team, and the league needed an exemption to a requirement that anyone entering Canada for nonessential reasons must isolate for 14 days. The U.S.-Canada border remains closed to nonessential travel. Dr. Andrew Morris, a professor of infectious diseases at the University of Toronto and the medical director of the Antimicrobial Stewardship Program at Sinai-University Health Network, said the Canadian government made the right decision. \u201cWith the current situation it is almost impossible for the government to reasonably sanction travel back and forth travel outside a bubble,\u201d Morris said. So, for the Raptors, it\u2019s now time for Florida to be home away from home again. Toronto was the first NBA team to arrive in Florida last summer to begin preparations for the restarted season inside a bubble at Walt Disney World near Orlando. The Raptors began with a training camp at Florida Gulf Coast University in Fort Myers, then went to Disney a couple weeks later \u2014 doing so because the virus and travel rules would have kept them from getting their team together in Canada. And now, they\u2019re on their way back to the Sunshine State. The league will release the first half of the schedule around Dec. 1; the second half of the schedule is likely to come in January or February, and there is a possibility that the team \u2014 for now, anyway \u2014 could return to Toronto at that point. \u201cSo we\u2019ll be away from our home and our fans for now,\u201d Ujiri wrote in his statement. \u201cThey say absence makes the heart grow fonder. I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s possible for us \u2014 we love Toronto and Canada, and we know we have the best fans in the NBA. For now, I\u2019ll ask you to cheer for us from afar, and we\u2019ll look forward to the day we are all together again.\u201d The Raptors will remain in the NBA\u2019s Atlantic Division. Assuming the Raptors play all 36 of their home games this season in Tampa, seven teams \u2014 Atlanta, Miami, Washington, Orlando, Charlotte, Brooklyn and Philadelphia will be scheduled to visit there twice. The league\u2019s other 15 teams will all go there once. The plan for the Raptors to come to Sunrise, about 30 miles north of Miami, was fairly far along as well. The team had worked out several arrangements with the NHL\u2019s Panthers, including even sharing the club\u2019s practice facility. Other U.S. cities known to have had interest in serving as the Raptors\u2019 temporary home were: Nashville, Tennessee; Newark, New Jersey; and Kansas City, Missouri. The Canadian government denied the Blue Jays\u2019 request to play in Toronto this year because health officials didn\u2019t think it was safe for players to travel back and forth from the U.S., one of the countries hit hardest by the coronavirus pandemic. The number of cases in both countries, but particularly in the U.S. has surged since. The Blue Jays failed to persuade the federal government to grant exemptions and played home games in Buffalo, New York, this year. The Canadian government required a comprehensive public health plan and written support from local health officials. The plan was reviewed by the Public Health Agency of Canada."},{"id":420641,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-enes-kanter-traded-to-blazers-in-3-team-deal","date":"2020-11-20","title":"Enes Kanter traded to Blazers in 3-team deal","content":"Enes Kanter is headed back to the Portland Trail Blazers.

Dedmon gives the Pistons a frontcourt presence and rebounder. He averaged 8.1 points and 8.2 rebounds in 10 games with the Hawks last season after being traded there by the Sacramento Kings on Feb. 6. Detroit struggled to get rebounds and defensive stops last season overall, but took a particular dive in both categories after it traded All-Star center Andre Drummond to Cleveland. From Feb. 6 to the season\u2019s hiatus on March 11, the Pistons ranked 25th in rebound percentage (48.1%) and Defensive Rating (114.8), two categories that Dedmon may be able to help Detroit address. The Pistons were busy on Draft night, picking German guard Killian Hayes at No. 7 overall and trading Luke Kennard to the LA Clippers . The Hawks used last season\u2019s NBA trade deadline to address their deficiency at center. They acquired center Clint Capela from Houston as part of a 12-player, four-team trade and he is seen as a foundational player along with phenom Trae Young, guard Kevin Huerter and forward John Collins. Atlanta also added to its frontline in the 2020 NBA Draft, taking former USC big man Onyeka Okongwu with the No. 6 overall pick. Snell is a solid 3-point shooter, making 40.2% of those shots last season with the Pistons and is a career 38.5% shooter from 3-point range. His ability to stretch the floor will help Young as well as give big men John Collins and Clint Capela more room to operate on offense. Last season was Snell\u2019s first with the Pistons after he arrived in a 2019 Draft-day swap with the Milwaukee Bucks. Overall, Snell averaged 8 points, 1.9 rebounds and 2.2 assists per game while shooting 40.2% on 3-pointers in 59 games (57 starts) with Detroit.

The Celtics did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Brad Stevens, who also coached Hayward in college at Butler, recruited Hayward to Boston in 2017 and the team signed him to a four-year, $128 million deal that made him the biggest free agent signing in franchise history.

Through its mission to leverage the game\u2019s influence to raise awareness, educate and advocate for meaningful reform, the Coalition will focus on action and change in several areas, including voting access and criminal justice system reform at the national, state and local level. The National Basketball Social Justice Coalition will be led by a group of five team governors, five players and two coaches. Additionally, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver, NBA Deputy Commissioner and Chief Operating Officer Mark Tatum and NBPA Executive Director Michele Roberts will serve on the Coalition\u2019s board. The inaugural board members are: NBA Board of Governors: National Basketball Players Association: National Basketball Coaches Association: The formation of the Coalition is another step in the NBA and NBPA\u2019s ongoing efforts to advance social justice, building upon a shared goal of the 2019-20 season restart in Orlando and continuing decades of work by players and teams to address racial inequality, advocate for meaningful change and promote greater civic engagement. Throughout their time on the Orlando campus, players, coaches and staff participated in social justice programming organized by the league and union and accessed educational resources and expert speakers, including former first lady Michelle Obama, motivational speaker Eric Thomas and NBA legend and former United States Senator Bill Bradley, to help sustain momentum in addressing systemic inequities and creating meaningful change.

In early August, the NBA Board of Governors announced a $300 million initial contribution to establish the first-ever NBA Foundation dedicated to creating greater economic empowerment in the Black community and in October named the inaugural Board of Directors, which included Sacramento Kings Forward Harrison Barnes, New Orleans Pelicans Governor Gayle Benson, Philadelphia 76ers Forward Tobias Harris, Charlotte Hornets Chairman Michael Jordan, Atlanta Hawks Principal Governor Tony Ressler, NBPA Executive Director Michele Roberts, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver and NBA Board of Governors Chairman and Toronto Raptors Governor Larry Tanenbaum.  The NBA and NBPA also took leaguewide action to promote greater civic engagement and expand voting access and voter awareness ahead of the 2020 election. In total, 23 teams committed their arenas or practice facilities for voting-related activities, and all 30 teams were actively involved in promoting greater civic engagement. The league and union worked with players, network partners and non-partisan organizations, including I Am A Voter and When We All Vote, to feature advertising spots during the postseason, participated in National Voter Registration Day, National Vote Early Day and National Black Voter Day, and shared voting, registration and census resources with teams and players. The NBA family also partnered with More Than A Vote, the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and Power The Polls to support the \u201cWe Got Next\u201d poll worker recruitment campaign, which signed up 20,000 new poll workers, including 10,000 who registered after the league and union hosted 40 first-time volunteers, President Barack Obama and NBA legends in a virtual fan section during Game 1 of the 2020 NBA Finals."},{"id":420451,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/pistons-draw-from-citys-automotive-heritage-in-city-edition-unis","date":"2020-11-20","title":"Detroit's automotive heritage inspires City Edition unis","content":"Detroit has a long history with the automotive industry and the Pistons\u2019 new City Edition uniforms for 2020-21 are trying to reflect that bond.

The days and especially the nights managed to lift the basketball fog that had suffocated the Bay Area for roughly two decades, and raised the entertainment level even higher, and gave the NBA a must-see moneymaker that demanded and deserved a place in prime time for several years. The Warriors had a blast, and truthfully, we all did. But apparently their time as a championship contender has come to a painful end with the latest grim news about Klay Thompson and yet another body part that failed him and his team. The truth, well, hurts. And it stinks. And add any other angry description that comes to mind about this rapid reversal of fortune that for some reason is punishing the Warriors for, exactly what, making basketball enjoyable? That\u2019s their crime? They\u2019re guilty \u2026 and that\u2019s a sin? Since winning their third championship in four years, way back in 2018 when the world and the Larry O\u2019Brien trophy was in a different place, the Warriors have suffered a pair of torn Achilles\u2019 tendons, an ACL tear and a broken hand to their three biggest stars, all of whom will be in the Hall of Fame someday. You simply cannot recover quickly from that. That is tougher to take than blowing a 3-1 lead in the NBA Finals, tougher to accept, actually. What\u2019s even more cruel is how the rug was pulled from under Thompson just as he was ready to gallop back to the starting line. After 14-plus months of rehab from knee surgery, thanks partly to a virus-interrupted NBA season, Thompson was healthy and anxious and ready to return to the lineup and help the Warriors return to glory. And then, hours before the NBA Draft with the Warriors holding the No. 2 overall pick and in position to add even more muscle, Thompson tore his right Achilles during a workout with fellow NBA players. He\u2019s staring at another rehab that will cost him another season and could be costly to his spot among the NBA\u2019s best players. He\u2019ll be 31, rusty and surgically-repaired twice when the 2021-22 season tips. By then, the Warriors might be a middle-of-the-pack team, ready to check out of the playoffs by the second round, hopelessly hanging onto the prime years of Steph Curry. And that\u2019s if they\u2019re lucky and avoid more trouble. In this league right now, time waits for no one or keeps a seat warm for the departed. The Warriors without Klay are about to discover that. There are almost a half-dozen teams in the West alone who are rubbernecking at the Warriors\u2019 wreckage while whizzing by. The Lakers and Nuggets, Clippers and Jazz, and maybe the Mavericks are all built to take advantage of former dynasty that\u2019s ready to die nasty. Actually, maybe it\u2019s more remarkable how the Warriors kept the good times rolling. It began with the drafting of Curry, then gained steam when Thompson arrived and the Splash Brothers were formed, then became a tornado once Draymond Green and Andre Iguodala and finally Kevin Durant made the Warriors a pop culture phenomenon. They crushed teams, won 73 games in a season, went to the Finals five times, won three, flourished on the fast break and in the half court, and were well worth the price of admission or the streaming and cable TV bill. It\u2019s not often when a franchise makes a string of bull\u2019s-eye decisions in the draft, free agency and trades in such a short amount of time. The Warriors were also lucky to a degree, but they made their own luck and ruled the NBA for the past decade. With a salary cap and luxury tax and free agency and superstars with selfish motives all conspiring against you, it\u2019s tricky to build a championship team, and trickier to keep one going. Coach Steve Kerr was always quick to remind everyone that the Warriors didn\u2019t live in the real world. They somehow escaped the lumps suffered by the majority of teams in this league. Well, you might say the bill finally came due, unfairly as it seems. Crazy, but until Durant grabbed his lower leg in the 2019 playoffs, the Warriors had lived a blessed life since 2015. Until he grabbed it again in Game 5 of the 2019 Finals, they were still ready to add a fourth championship in five years. If you could freeze the moment right before it happened, and assume that Durant stayed healthy for that championship series against the Raptors, maybe Golden State does add to the trophy case, and Durant re-signs with the team, and there\u2019s no need to play the Finals game where Thompson suffered his knee injury. But sports doesn\u2019t work like that. Sports can be evil and unforgiving and ready to curse a great team so another team can get a chance. With Thompson out last season, Curry suffered a broken hand shortly after and the Warriors embarked on a lost and lousy season where they finished dead last in the standings. Maybe those grueling and deep runs into the summer put their bodies in a tough spot, although it never seems to harm LeBron James. At least the last place came with a sweetener, allowing the Warriors to get the No. 2 pick which they used on James Wiseman, the seven-footer who played a handful of games in college yet made enough of an impression anyway. Wiseman was supposed to give the Warriors an extra dimension they never had during their dynasty \u2014 a functional big man who might see a few plays run for him. He would give them a bit of balance and keep defenses from cherry-picking on the perimeter against Curry and Thompson. You say the Warriors aren\u2019t finished yet? Well, that requires some perspective. Making annual trips to the Finals is unfathomable without Klay. Same goes for putting a scare into LeBron and Anthony Davis. Curry is good enough to carry a club to the middle of the conference standings and reaching the playoffs are certainly not out of the question, but anything beyond that? Let\u2019s be real. They\u2019ll have Steph and Draymond and maybe Andrew Wiggins wakes up and perhaps Wiseman develops more rapidly than expected. There\u2019s Kelly Oubre, a decent swingman who can help with scoring, on the way. But the rest of the league doesn\u2019t shiver at the sight of the Warriors anymore, not the Warriors we came to know. They won\u2019t have Klay Thompson \u2014 again \u2014 and while there is great sympathy for Thompson both inside and outside of the NBA, everyone will eventually move on once the ball goes up on 2020-21. The Warriors will, too, just not on the path they\u2019re accustomed to taking, and definitely not with any speed that can put distance between themselves and their crummy luck. * * *  Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

Here are some key moves to know today: Here\u2019s a team-by-team look at every reported move from Nov. 19: Two teams with playoff aspirations in the Eastern Conference have worked out a reported trade to address some key needs. Per multiple reports, the Atlanta Hawks are sending center Dewayne Dedmon to the Detroit Pistons for Tony Snell and Khyri Thomas. The trade was first reported by ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski. The move frees up considerable salary cap room for the Hawks after shedding Dedmon, who is making $13.3 million this season. Snell will make $12.1 million in 2020-21, which is the final year of his contract, while Dedmon\u2019s $13.3 million for 2021-22 is non-guaranteed. On the court, Dedmon gives the Pistons a frontcourt presence and rebounder. He averaged 8.1 points and 8.2 rebounds in 10 games with the Hawks last season after being traded there by the Sacramento Kings on Feb. 6. Dedmon has proven to be a capable frontcourt player in the past, averaging 10.8 ppg and 7.5 rpg in 2018-19 and 10.0 ppg and 7.9 rpg in 2017-18. Snell is a solid 3-point shooter, making 40.2% of those shots last season with the Pistons and is a career 38.5% shooter from 3-point range. His ability to stretch the floor will help the young Hawks and their All-Star guard, Trae Young, as well as give big men John Collins and Clint Capela more room to operate on offense. \u2014 3:25 p.m. > Free Agent Tracker Boston Celtics forward Gordon Hayward has decided to opt out of his $34-million option for next season, according to reports from Shams Charania of The Athletic and Marc Stein of The New York Times . Hayward reportedly has been in demand on the trade market and could still be acquired via a sign-and-trade deal. The 30-year-old former All-Star has struggled with injuries during his three seasons in Boston. He posted averages of 17.5 points, 6.7 rebounds and 4.1 assists over 52 games during 2019-20. \u2014 5:13 p.m. * * * Boston Celtics center Enes Kanter has decided to stay with the team for the 2020-21 season, according to a report from Tim Bontemps of ESPN . Kanter\u2019s option for next season reportedly is worth $5 million. \u2014 4:37 p.m. * * * Celtics guard Brad Wanamaker is set to become a free agent, according to a report from Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN. Boston reportedly decided to decline the second-year guards qualifying offer, which would make Wanamaker an unrestricted free agent. \u2014 4:39 p.m. > Free Agent Tracker  The Brooklyn Nets are moving on from their time with swingman Garrett Temple. The veteran combo guard joined the Nets last season as a free agent, but will not have his $5 million option picked up for 2020-21, reports Chris Haynes of Yahoo Sports . Brooklyn marked Temple\u2019s ninth different team in his 11-year career and he enjoyed a standout season there, posting career highs in scoring (10.3 ppg), rebounding (3.5 rpg) and assists (3.0 apg). He took on a significant role when injuries hit the Brooklyn backcourt, moving into the starting lineup for a two-month stretch from Nov. 12 to Jan. 6. \u2014 2:56 p.m. > Free Agent Tracker  \u2014 12:10 p.m. > Free Agent Tracker  The Dallas Mavericks have an All-Star in the backcourt in Luka Doncic and a capable sidekick for him in Tim Hardaway Jr., too. Per Tim MacMahon of ESPN, it appears that duo will be in place for 2020-21. The Mavs are picking up Hardaway Jr.\u2019s contract option for next season after he averaged 15.8 points, 3.3. rebounds and 1.9 assists in 71 games for Dallas. Hardaway Jr. took a marked step forward in his 3-point shooting in his second season with the Mavs, going from 32.1% in 2019-20 to 39.8% last season. \u2014 1:55 p.m. * * * The Philadelphia 76ers have acquired Seth Curry from the Dallas Mavericks in exchange for Josh Richardson and the 36th overall pick, the team announced. Curry brings elite shooting skills to the Sixers. The 30-year-old guard shot a career-high 45.2% from 3-point range last season. In addition, Curry is married to Callie Rivers, the daughter of Sixers coach Doc Rivers. \u2014 11:24 p.m., Nov. 18 > Reported Draft night deals The Warriors reportedly have reached an agreement to acquire Kelly Oubre Jr. from the Thunder, according to multiple reports.

He averaged a career-high 18.7 points with 6.4 rebounds and 1.5 assists during 2019-20. \u2014 5:24 p.m. Clippers forward JaMychal Green will become an unrestricted free agent after declining his $5-million player option, according to a report from Shams Charania of The Athletic. Green was a key contributor off the bench for the Clippers with averages of 6.8 points and 6.2 rebounds over 63 games. \u2014 5:02 p.m. The Los Angeles Lakers\u2019 will be without one familiar face and will have another one back in the mix. Shams Charania of The Athletic reports Quinn Cook, who had a non-guaranteed deal for 2020-21, is being waived . Backup center JaVale McGee, however, is picking up his player option for 2020-21 and be back with the Lakers. The underafted Cook has proven to be a valuable bench scorer in his career and last season, averaged 5.1 points and 1.2 rebounds while making 36.5% of his 3-pointers in a reserve role for the Lakers. He is a career 40.7% 3-point shooter and has valuable playoff experience in his career that could make him an interesting prospect in the 2020 free-agent market. McGee started 68 regular-season games and 11 of 14 playoff games as the Lakers won the 2020 NBA title. He was part of a center platoon with veteran Dwight Howard and the two teamed up to give L.A. some effective minutes at times alongside All-Star big man Anthony Davis. Howard is an unrestricted free agent this summer and Davis is planning to opt out of his deal, but the Lakers are seen as favorites to keep Davis. \u2014 3:03 p.m. * * * The Los Angeles Lakers have acquired guard Dennis Schroder from the Oklahoma City Thunder in exchange for Danny Green and the draft rights to Jaden McDaniels, it was announced today by Vice President of Basketball Operations and General Manager Rob Pelinka. Schr\u00f6der averaged 18.9 points, 4.0 assists and 3.6 rebounds in 65 games (two starts) for Oklahoma City last season. Additionally, he led the league in points scored off the bench and finished second in NBA Sixth Man Award voting, while shooting career highs in field goal percentage (.469) and three-point percentage (.385). Schr\u00f6der owns career averages of 14.1 points, 4.6 assists and 2.8 rebounds in seven seasons with Atlanta and Oklahoma City. \u2014 1 a.m. > Free Agent Tracker  Kelly Olynyk, one of the key reserves from Miami\u2019s run to the 2020 Finals, will be back in the mix for 2020-21. Per Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN, Olynyk has exercised his option to return for next season. He averaged 8.2 points, 4.6 rebounds and 1.7 assists per game last season while connecting on a career-best 40.6% of his 3-pointers. In the 2020 playoffs, Olynyk averaged 7.6 ppg, 4.6 rpg and 1.1 apg in 17 games. In Game 3 of The Finals, Olynyk was key in Miami\u2019s 115-104 victory as he had 17 points and seven rebounds off the bench. While Olynyk will be back, several other key players from Miami\u2019s 2020 Finals team \u2014 a group that includes Goran Dragic, Jae Crowder, Derrick Jones Jr. and Meyers Leonard \u2014 are unrestricted free agents this summer. Veteran big man Udonis Haslem, who was also an unrestricted free agent, said he will be re-signing with Miami for 2020-21. \u2014 11:54 a.m. > Free Agent Tracker   The New York Knicks are acquiring Ed Davis and two 2023 second round picks in a trade with the Jazz, according to Tony Jones of The Athletic and Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN. The 31-year-old center played 28 games for Utah during the 2019-20 season. \u2014 5:55 p.m. * * * New York attempted to make a splash in free agency last summer with a trio of moves. A year later, all three players the Knicks added are on the way out. The Knicks declined the option on Bobby Portis as well as waiving Taj Gibson, Wayne Ellington, Kenny Wooten and Elfrid Payton. Portis was scheduled to make $15.7 million, with Gibson at $10.29 million and Payton at $8 million for 2020-21 had they been kept on board. The move frees up some salary cap space for New York as it continues its rebuilding efforts under new GM Leon Rose and coach Tom Thibodeau. The Knicks signed all the veterans as part of a seven-player class in the summer of 2019. They enter free agency Friday with only Julius Randle and Reggie Bullock remaining from the group, having traded Marcus Morris to the Clippers during the season. The Knicks also declined their option on guard Theo Pinson. \u2014 1:30 p.m. > Free Agent Tracker  Veteran big man Mike Muscala is forgoing free agency in 2020 and will stick with the Thunder going forward. ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski reports Muscala has opted into his deal for next season. The 2019-20 campaign was Muscala\u2019s first with the Thunder and he averaged 4.8 points and 2.3 rebounds in a reserve role for them. Muscala began his career with Atlanta in 2013-14 and spent his first five seasons with the Hawks. He has proven to be a reliable 3-point shooter in his career, making 36.8% of his shots from there while also proving to be reliable from the free throw line (83.9% from there). \u2014 12:44 p.m. * * *  Suns center Frank Kaminsky will become an unrestricted free agent after the team decided to decline his $5.2-million option, according to a report from Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN. The 7-footer averaged 9.7 points and 4.5 rebounds over 39 games with Phoenix last season. The Phoenix Suns got a nice boost in their playoff push during the NBA restart from point guard Cameron Payne. They appear to be intent on keeping that relationship going. Per Keith Smith of Yahoo Sports , the Suns are opting into 2020-21 with Payne. The former No. 14 overall pick of the Oklahoma City Thunder in 2015, Payne had bounced around the NBA before Phoenix signed him a few weeks before the 2019-20 restart began. Joining the Suns suited him well, as he averaged career highs in points (10.9), rebounds (3.9), shooting percentage (48.5%) and 3-point percentage (51.7) in a reserve role. He is expected to return to that role in 2020-21 after Phoenix\u2019s blockbuster trade for Chris Paul days ago. \u2014 1:51 p.m. > Free Agent Tracker "},{"id":419915,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nuggets-unveil-city-edition-uniform-add-new-color","date":"2020-11-19","title":"Nuggets unveil City Edition uniform, add new color","content":"The Denver Nuggets revealed their latest City Edition uniforms.

Thompson will miss the 2020-21 season because of a season-ending Achilles tear, the team confirmed today. ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski was first to report the news. However, the good news for the Warriors, per Wojnarowski, is that Thompson has been told he is expected to make a full recovery from the injury. \u201cGolden State Warriors guard Klay Thompson suffered a torn right Achilles tendon, an MRI confirmed today in Los Angeles,\u201d the Warriors said in a tweet posted Thursday. \u201cThompson suffered the injury yesterday in a workout in Southern California. He is expected to miss the 2020-21 season.\u201d On Wednesday, the Warriors announced that Thompson injured his right leg Wednesday during a workout in Southern California. The team announced the injury without providing further details about the severity or any timeline for his availability with training camp starting Dec. 1 and the season beginning Dec. 22. It was unclear how this might affect Golden State\u2019s draft decisions. The Warriors selected big man James Wiseman with the No. 2 pick. Thompson didn\u2019t play at all during the coronavirus-shortened season this year as he worked back from surgery for a torn ACL in his left knee. He suffered that injury in the deciding Game 6 of the 2019 NBA Finals against the Toronto Raptors. The injury could be a severe blow for the Warriors, who finished worst in the NBA last season as they struggled without Thompson and at times without Stephen Curry, who was nursing a broken left hand that sidelined him for more than four months. \u201cI guess this business teaches you to wait to hear for sure on any of these things,\u201d Warriors general manager Bob Myers said Wednesday. \u201cObviously dealing with some of the injuries we\u2019ve dealt with in the last couple years, it doesn\u2019t harden you, it doesn\u2019t make it easier but I was hoping we were through all that and maybe we are.

I can\u2019t wait to be able to get out there and compete with the rest of my teammates.\u201d In Miami, Achiuwa will join another player of Nigerian descent in Bam Adebayo, who became a first-time NBA All-Star last season with a breakout campaign in which he averaged 15.9 points and 10.2 rebounds per game in helping Miami earn a trip to The Finals. Prior to the Draft on Wednesday, the NBA featured nearly 20 players of Nigerian heritage on NBA rosters (more than 30 if we\u2019re counting former players), most notably Giannis Antetokounmpo (as well as his brothers Thanasis and Kostas), Adebayo, Deandre Ayton, and Victor Oladipo. In the leadup to the Draft, the NBA noted that seven players in the current class have ties to Nigeria in Azubike and Achiuwa, who are from the country, as well as five more prospects with at least one parent from Nigeria in Isaac Okoro (fifth overall by Cleveland), Onyeka Okongwu (sixth overall by Atlanta), Zene Nnaji (22 nd overall by Denver), Daniel Oturu (33 rd overall by the New York Knicks, and reportedly traded to the L.A. Clippers) and Jordan Nwora (45 th overall to Milwaukee). The league left out Desmond Bane (30 th overall by Boston), whose father Etieno Ekiko hails from Nigeria. So, it\u2019s clear the country has come a long way since 1984 when the Houston Rockets selected Hakeem Olajuwon, born in Lagos, Nigeria, with the No. 1 overall pick. In fact, 10 years passed before the league took a chance on another player of Nigerian descent (Yinka Dare, 14 th overall to the New Jersey Nets). Okoro became the first player of Nigerian origin on Wednesday to have his name called among the 2020 draft class, which broke the previous record (five) for the most players from Africa selected in one NBA Draft. \u201cIt feels great to be the first Nigerian in this Draft to be drafted,\u201d Okoro said. \u201cIt\u2019s also just a blessing. My mom (Gloria Okoro) always tells me to keep that Nigerian pride. Even though I wasn\u2019t born in Nigeria, I\u2019ve still got Nigerian blood.\u201d * * * Michael C.

Per multiple reports, the sign-and-trade deal between the Kings and Bucks that would send Bogdanovic to the Eastern Conference faces an uncertain future now. ESPN reports that Bogdanovic now plans to enter restricted free agency at 6 p.m. ET on Friday. Wojnarowski reports the Kings and Bucks had hoped to agree to the framework of the deal on Friday when negotiations between teams and players can open. However, Bogdanovic is planning to enter the free-agent marketplace and seek out other sign-and-trade scenarios. Jason Anderson of The Sacramento Bee reports that a source told him \u201cthere is no deal\u201d and \u201cthere never was a deal\u201d even when the sign-and-trade swap broke late Monday night. Per Anderson, Bogdanovic never agreed to the terms of any deal and cannot do so because free agency doesn\u2019t open until Friday. Sam Amick of The Athletic reports the deal \u201chas issues\u201d and that signs may indicate Bogdanovic will ultimate head elsewhere in free agency. Additionally, The Athletic reports the deal is \u201cin peril\u201d because Bogdanovic never agreed to the terms of the deal to begin with. In the original reported sign-and-trade deal, Bogdanovic was to head to the Bucks for Donte Divincenzo, Ersan Ilyasova and DJ Wilson. Last season, Bogdanovic averaged 15.1 points while shooting 37.2% from 3-point range while also adding 3.4 rebounds and 3.4 assists per game. He became a starter for the Kings in January, supplanting Buddy Hield. James, a 6-foot-7 guard who is entering his second NBA season, averaged 2.5 ppg in 36 games. The Bucks\u2019 reported move to add Bogdanovic came roughly an hour after a reported trade with New Orleans netted Milwaukee former All-Star and All-Defensive point guard Jrue Holiday from the Pelicans . With that pair of reported moves, the Bucks would have featured a 2020-21 starting lineup that would feature Holiday and Bogdanovic in the backcourt, with All-Star Khris Middleton, center Brook Lopez and two-time defending Kia MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo in the frontcourt. Per The Sacramento Bee , Bogdanovic turned down a $51.4 million extension before the 2019-20 season, which was offered after the Kings gave lucrative contracts to Hield and Harrison Barnes last offseason. The Kings overhauled their front office in the offseason, with new general manager Monte McNair taking over after GM Vlade Divac and assistant GM Peja Stojakovic stepped down in August. The sign-and-trade of Bogdanovic likely signals another rebuild for the Kings, who have not made the playoffs since 2006. Information from The Associated Press was used in this report.

Heck, even if you have James and Davis, it helps to have some guys who who can space the floor and knock it down from deep. A lot of things \u2014 turnovers, free throw rate, offensive rebounding \u2014 affect overall efficiency. But shooting is the most important factor there is. Not surprisingly, there\u2019s a strong correlation between how well a team shoots from 3-point range and how efficiently it scores. Even if a team doesn\u2019t shoot particularly well, it can improve efficiency by increasing its 3-point volume. Just ask Philadelphia 76ers president Daryl Morey, whose Houston Rockets led the league in 3-point rate (3PA\/FGA) in each of the last seven seasons, taking over 50% of their shots from beyond the arc in each of the last three. The Rockets didn\u2019t rank any higher than 12th in 3-point percentage over those seven years, but still ranked in the top seven in offensive efficiency in six of the seven. The Sixers, believe it or not, have ranked in the top 10 in 3-point percentage in each of the last three seasons. But the volume hasn\u2019t been there. Their two stars are both at their best in the paint and they\u2019ve had enough high-volume shooters around them. In the 2020 playoffs (when they got swept in the first round), the Sixers ranked last in 3-point percentage (26.4%) and 15th in the percentage of their shots that came from 3-point range (36.0%). They were missing the guy \u2014 Ben Simmons \u2014 who ranked third in the league with 226 assists on 3-pointers, 48% of the 469 3s his teammates made while he was on the floor. But they were also missing real shooters. Al Horford, Josh Richardson, Tobias Harris are capable from downtown, but they aren\u2019t 3-point shooters by nature. Among 190 players with at least 200 field goal attempts from outside the paint last season, Horford (1.80), Richardson (1.66) and Harris (1.59) ranked 141st, 147th and 152nd in their ratio of 3-point attempts to mid-range attempts. And neither moved without the ball like JJ Redick in the Sixers\u2019 offense two seasons ago. All three are good players, but context is everything. The context in Philly is that the two franchise players \u2014 Simmons and Joel Embiid \u2014 are beasts in the paint who need to be complemented with as much shooting as possible. So Morey got to work on Wednesday. Horford is gone, reportedly heading to Oklahoma City in a deal that yielded Danny Green and Terrance Ferguson. With the Lakers last season, Green took 69% of his shots from 3-point range, the 10th-highest rate among 248 players with at least 300 field goal attempts. Richardson is also gone, heading to Dallas in a trade that brings Seth Curry to Philly. Curry ranked third in 3-point percentage (45.2%) and the 48.1% he shot on catch-and-shoot 3s was the best mark among 209 players who attempted at least 100. Ferguson (29.2%) was near the bottom of that list , but does at least give the Sixers some additional wing depth. That will allow Harris to play mostly at power forward. There were 133 players who shot better than the league average (35.8%) on at least 100 3-point attempts last season. The Sixers finished the season with six of those guys, two of them \u2014 Alec Burks and Glenn Robinson III \u2014 free agents . On Wednesday, they added two more without losing any. Before we hit free agency, the Sixers are one of two teams with six of those 133 guys \u2014 Curry, Green, Harris, Furkan Korkmaz, Shake Milton and Mike Scott \u2014 under contract for next season. The Sixers did lose some defense in the two trades they made, and there are still questions about just how well Simmons and Embiid fit together offensively. But as long as they have both, their defense will hold up, and there are now fewer questions about how the rest of the team fits around them. \u201cHaving a truly elite shooter,\u201d Morey said late Wednesday , \u201creally changes the dynamic for Ben and Joel.\u201d The Sixers probably aren\u2019t going to take half of their shots from 3-point range this season. But they\u2019ll climb the ranks in regard to 3-point rate, with more of a \u201clet it fly\u201d attitude from the supporting cast.  In total, 10 of those 133 players who shot 35.8% or better on at least 100 3-point attempts have been traded. The other team that\u2019s added two is the Phoenix Suns, who got Chris Paul (36.5% on 304 attempts) and Abdel Nader (37.5% on 128 attempts) from Oklahoma City. The Thunder had five of the 133, traded three (Paul, Nader and Dennis Schroder) and are likely to lose a fourth (Danilo Gallinari) via free agency. Their fifth was Mike Muscala, who has a player option for next season. The other five members of the group expected to be on the move (not all deals are official): Interestingly, the other team with six of the 133 above-average 3-point shooters under contract for next season is the San Antonio Spurs, with LaMarcus Aldridge, Trey Lyles, Patty Mills, Dejounte Murray, Lonnie Walker IV and Derrick White. Alas, only two of those six guys (Mills and White) fired off more than 175 3-point attempts last season . The Spurs ranked 28th in the percentage of their shots that came from 3-point range (in the bottom seven for the fifth straight season). * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

Killian Hayes became the highest-drafted French player ever when he was selected 7 th overall by Detroit Pistons. Deni Avdija became the highest-drafted Israeli player ever and just the second Israeli player to be drafted in the first round when he was selected 9 th overall by the Washington Wizards. And Leandro Bolmaro became the highest-drafted Argentinian player ever when he was selected 23 rd overall by the New York Knicks. With Hayes and Avdija\u2019s selections, at least two international players have been drafted in the top 10 in each of the last eight NBA Drafts. Precious Achiuwa was selected 20 th overall by the Miami Heat and Udoka Azubuike was selected 27 th overall by the Utah Jazz, marking the first time that two players from Nigeria were selected in the first round of the same NBA Draft. Achiuwa and Azubuike are among the eight draftees from or with at least one parent from Nigeria, including Isaac Okoro (5 th overall by the Cleveland Cavaliers), Onyeka Okongwu (6 th overall by the Atlanta Hawks), Zeke Nnaji (22 nd overall by the Denver Nuggets), Desmond Bane (30 th overall by the Boston Celtics), Daniel Oturu (33 rd overall by the Minnesota Timberwolves) and Jordan Nwora (45 th overall by the Milwaukee Bucks). Below please find storylines about the international players selected in NBA Draft 2020 and in the NBA. \u2022 Killian Hayes (France; born in Lakeland, Fla.;  ratiopharm Ulm)  was selected 7 th overall by Detroit Pistons , becoming the highest-drafted French player ever. Hayes was named an All-Star at two Basketball Without Borders (BWB) Global camps as part of NBA All-Star 2018 and 2019 and becomes the ninth former BWB camper to be drafted in the top 10 in the last five years. There were eight French players on 2019-20 opening-night rosters. \u2022 Deni Avdija (Israel; Maccabi Tel Aviv)  was selected 9 th overall by the Washington Wizards , becoming the highest-drafted Israeli player ever and just the second Israeli player to be drafted in the first round (Omri Casspi, 23 rd overall in 2009). Avdija was named MVP of Basketball Without Borders Europe (BWB) 2018 and BWB Global 2019 and becomes the 10 th former BWB camper to be drafted in the top 10 in the last five years. Avdija\u2019s father, Zufer, won a bronze medal with Yugoslavia at the 1982 FIBA Basketball World Championship and played professionally in Serbia and Israel. His mother, Sharon Artzi, is a former championship runner. \u2022 Aleksej Poku\u0161evski (Serbia; Olympiacos) was selected 17 th overall by the Minnesota Timberwolves, becoming the highest-drafted Serbian player since Darko Mili\u010di\u0107, (2 nd overall in 2003) and the fourth Serbian player to be drafted in the first round in the last 15 years. Poku\u0161evski participated in Basketball Without Borders Europe 2018 in Belgrade, Serbia alongside fellow 2020 draftee Deni Avdija (9 th overall by the Washington Wizards; Israel). There were six Serbian players on 2019-20 opening night rosters, the fifth most of any country outside the U.S. \u2022 Josh Green (Australia; University of Arizona) was selected 18 th overall by the Dallas Mavericks, becoming the highest-drafted Australian player since Ben Simmons (1 st overall in 2016) and the seventh Australian to be drafted in the first round. Green was named an All-Star at Basketball Without Borders Global 2018 and participated in the 2018 NBA Global Camp in Treviso, Italy alongside fellow 2020 draftees Killian Hayes and Theo Maledon (France). \u2022 Precious Achiuwa (Nigeria; University of Memphis) was selected 20 th overall by the Miami Heat, becoming the third Nigerian player to be drafted in the first round since 2000. There are 10 current and former NBA players from Nigeria, tied with Senegal for the most of any African country. There are more than 90 current and former NBA players from Africa or with direct family ties to the continent, including 13 African-born players on 2019-20 opening-night rosters. \u2022 Leandro Bolmaro (Argentina; FC Barcelona) was selected 23 rd overall by the New York Knicks, becoming the highest-drafted Argentinian player ever. Bolmaro participated in Basketball Without Borders Americas 2017 and Basketball Without Borders Global 2018 , where he was named an All-Star alongside fellow 2020 draftees Killian Hayes (7 th overall by Detroit Pistons; France) and Josh Green (18 th overall by the Dallas Mavericks; Australia). In March 2018, Bolmaro joined top prospects from the league\u2019s NBA Academies at Next Generation Sunday at the NCAA Men\u2019s Final Four in San Antonio , where he participated in educational and life-skills sessions, competed against peers from around the world, and experienced aspects of the Final Four from a player\u2019s perspective, including attending Final Four semifinal games. Prior to the event, he spent a week training at NBA Academy Latin America in Mexico City alongside top prospects from across the region. \u2022  Udoka Azubuike (Nigeria; University of Kansas) was selected 27 th overall by the Utah Jazz, marking the first time that two players from Nigeria were selected in the first round of the same NBA Draft (Precious Achiuwa was selected 20 th overall by the Miami Heat). \u2022 Th\u00e9o Maledon (France; ASVEL) was selected 34 th overall by the Philadelphia 76ers. Maledon participated in the 2018 NBA Global Camp in Treviso, Italy alongside fellow 2020 draftees Killian Hayes (France) and Josh Green (Australia). \u2022 Vit Krej\u010d\u00ed (Czech Republic; Casademont Zaragoza) was selected 37 th overall by the Washington Wizards, becoming the first player drafted from the Czech Republic since Tomas Satoransky (32 nd overall in the 2012). Krej\u010d\u00ed participated in Basketball Without Borders Europe 2017 and Basketball Without Borders Global 2018 . \u2022 Nick Richards (Jamaica; University of Kentucky) was selected 42 nd overall by the New Orleans Pelicans, becoming the highest-drafted Jamaican player since Rumeal Robinson (10 th overall in 1990) and the first Jamaican player drafted since Jerome Jordan (44 th overall in 2010). \u2022 Marko Simonovi\u0107 (Montenegro ; Mega Soccerbet) was selected 44 th overall by the Chicago Bulls. \u2022 Yam Madar (Israel; Hapoel Tel Aviv) was selected 47 th overall by the Boston Celtics, marking the first time that two Israeli players were selected in the same NBA Draft (Deni Avdija was selected 9 th overall by the Washington Wizards , becoming the highest-drafted Israeli player ever). \u2022 Nico Mannion (Italy; University of Arizona) was selected 48 th overall by the Golden State Warriors, becoming the highest-drafted Italian player since Danilo Gallinari (6 th overall in 2008). Mannion was born in Italy and holds dual citizenship. His father, Pace, played in the NBA and the Italian League. His mother, Gaia, was a professional volleyball player in her native Italy.  \u2022 There were 108 international players from 38 countries and territories on 2019-20 opening-night rosters (press release from 10\/22\/19 linked here ). \u2022 The 2019-20 season was the sixth consecutive season that opening-night rosters featured at least 100 international players. \u2022 Canada had the most NBA players of any country outside the U.S. for the sixth straight year with 16 players (Australia and France had nine each). \u2022 The Dallas Mavericks led the league with seven international players on 2019-20 opening-night NBA rosters. \u2022 A record six international players were named to a 2019-20 All-NBA Team: Giannis Antetokounmpo (Milwaukee Bucks; Greece; All-NBA First Team); Luka Don\u010di\u0107 (Dallas Mavericks; Slovenia; All-NBA First Team); Nikola Joki\u0107 (Denver Nuggets; Serbia; All-NBA Second Team); Pascal Siakam (Toronto Raptors; Cameroon; All-NBA Second Team); Rudy Gobert (Utah Jazz; France; All-NBA Third Team) and Ben Simmons (Philadelphia 76ers; Australia; All-NBA Third Team)."},{"id":419452,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/unexpected-uncertainty-fails-to-shake-top-of-2020-nba-draft","date":"2020-11-19","title":"Unexpected uncertainty fails to shake top of 2020 NBA Draft","content":"NBA Commissioner Adam Silver looks on after announcing the Warriors\u2019 selection of James Wiseman at No. 2 overall. Whether there\u2019s an obvious no-brainer choice in a given year or, as with this 2020 edition, a fair amount of debate over the player most likely to go first, the spotlight on the NBA Draft almost always shines brightest on the No. 1 pick. In the hours before Wednesday\u2019s event, though, the glare shifted abruptly to No. 2. That\u2019s where the Golden State Warriors sat, any excitement over the potential of that pick morphing rapidly into anxiety and distraction with the news that All-NBA marksman Klay Thompson had gotten hurt in a pickup game in southern California. It was rotten timing for lousy news. The Warriors were in a rare position, selecting so high, to add a critical piece to their resuscitated championship core of Stephen Curry, Draymond Green and Thompson. Maybe they could trade down for proven help. Maybe they would take the long view, plucking a player who might keep them afloat as a contender for years. All of a sudden, with the severity of Thompson\u2019s right leg injury still to be determined, Golden State was facing urgency. Quite possibly a new agenda. Draft a wing to plug Thompson\u2019s spot, based on the grim prospect that the five-time All-Star \u2014 who hasn\u2019t played in an NBA game since tearing his left ACL in Game 6 of the 2019 Finals \u2014 might be out for an extended period again? Really scramble to trade the pick for a Thompson replacement? Front office folks have to be nimble on Draft night, but this was something above and beyond. So what did the Warriors do, in their moment of crisis? They stuck to the script. After the Minnesota Timberwolves selected Georgia wing Anthony Edwards with the top pick, Golden State went with Memphis center James Wiseman, the guy meant to fill their immediate needs for rim protection and rebounding, as if Thompson won\u2019t miss a beat with this latest setback. Or as if the future is a little more important than the present, given the vision general manager Bob Myers, coach Steve Kerr and the rest of the brain trust have for Wiseman\u2019s development. They took a supremely gifted, 7-foot-1 athlete who knows what he doesn\u2019t know, welcoming the chance to grow and learn from Warriors\u2019 veterans in their winning culture (aside from last season\u2019s 15-50 injury-induced hiccup). \u201cJust fit in my role, stay humble and be coachable, which I am,\u201d Wiseman said in a Zoom interview afterward. Knowing Thompson had gotten hurt, Wiseman wasn\u2019t certain at first how it might affect his chances of going to Golden State. \u201cAs soon as I saw it, it was kind of down for me emotionally,\u201d he said. \u201cBut as a team we\u2019ve got his back no matter what, and he\u2019s going to be in great recovery.\u201d Edwards, on the No. 1 Anthonys scale, will try to land closer to the Lakers\u2019 Davis from 2012 than Bennett, Cleveland\u2019s inconsequential top pick a year later. The 6-foot-5, 225-pound Edwards already has an NBA player\u2019s build and grace, and is seen slipping naturally into a needy Timberwolves lineup built around All-Star center Karl-Anthony Towns and guard D\u2019Angelo Russell. The Draft itself was staged virtually, headquartered in ESPN\u2019s studios in Bristol, Conn. That meant no handshakes from NBA commissioner Adam Silver after he read their names, no awkward waiting in the green room if a guy\u2019s stock slid, no booing from impossible-to-please Knicks fans. Thanks to the various pandemic shutdowns across college and pro basketball, it was held 146 days later than the original date of June 25. Players were linked in remotely, surrounded by family and friends, while tasked with pulling their own team caps from the stash sent by the league to the top prospects. What viewers got, then, were snapshots of euphoria and tears, more so than in the standard Draft location of Barclays Center in Brooklyn. In Edwards\u2019 case, the family setting included paintings of his mother Yvette and grandmother Shirley, both of whom passed away form ovarian cancer during an eight-month period in 2015-16. The \u201cAnt Man\u201d had vowed that the two would be part of his special moment, and they were. \u201cAs far as just being excited,\u201d Edwards said, \u201cand just being happy and ready to go and ready to work and ready to get there as soon as possible, those emotions were overwhelming with just my mother and grandmother being there.\u201d Once Golden State\u2019s turn passed without Myers & Co. calling an audible to address the Klay news, the lottery selections played out with no real surprises. LaMelo Ball, brother of New Orleans\u2019 point guard Lonzo Ball, went at No. 3 to Charlotte , giving the non-descript Hornets a player many scouts consider to have the greatest star potential and charisma. He and Lonzo, the second pick overall in 2017, became the first brothers in NBA Draft history chosen in the top five. Florida State\u2019s Patrick Williams\u2019 selection at No. 4 by the Chicago Bulls went against some experts\u2019 mock drafts. But the ACC Sixth Man of the Year\u2019s stock had been rising, despite not starting a single college game. Cleveland believes it found some badly needed wing defense in Auburn\u2019s lanky Isaac Okoro, taken fifth. By snagging center Onyeka Okongwu at No. 6, Atlanta grabbed a big body and hustling pick-and-roll man that Washington reportedly had its eye on three spots later. Teams rounding out the top 10 seemed pleased without having to maneuver for their prizes. Detroit picked France\u2019s Killian Hayes at No. 7, giving the Pistons an eventual replacement at point guard for Derrick Rose. New York had Dayton forward Obi Toppin fall to them at No. 8, a Brooklyn native whose shelf of college-player-of-the-year awards might have silenced boo birds had they been on hand. The Wizards soothed their loss of Okongwu by taking Israel point forward Deni Avdija, who some thought might go as high as No. 4. Phoenix then went for Maryland big man Jalen Smith at No. 10, hoping his Serge Ibaka-like upside pans out. The final four lottery picks: Florida State guard Devin Vassell to San Antonio at No. 11, the Spurs\u2019 first lottery pick since 1997; Iowa State guard Tyrese Haliburton to Sacramento at No. 12; Alabama guard Kira Lewis Jr. to New Orleans at No. 13 and, with the highest of three first-round picks with which the Celtics began the night, Vanderbilt forward Aaron Nesmith at No. 14. While the lottery selections slotted in routinely enough, there was plenty of jockeying later in the first round. In fact, of the final 15 picks from Nos. 16-30, eight were traded as teams maneuvered for either young talent or for salary-cap flexibility with free agency negotiations set to begin Friday at 6 p.m. ET. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson. Do-everything Draymond Green and much-improved big man Kevon Looney. Wiseman became a part of that group Wednesday night as the Warriors selected the Memphis center with the second overall pick in the draft. \u201cI know it\u2019s going to be a long process for me, for my career, but I\u2019m truly ready,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just going in there to try to learn as much as possible and stay humble and work hard every day and just win.\u201d Wiseman averaged 34.2 points in three games as a freshman for the Tigers before a 12-game suspension by the NCAA because his family received money during the recruitment process. While serving the penalty, the 7-foot-1, 240-pound Wiseman decided to turn his attention to the draft. News that Thompson injured his leg earlier Wednesday during a workout on his own in Southern California put a damper on Golden State\u2019s draft. The team announced the injury without providing further details on the severity or any timeline for his availability with training camp starting Dec. 1 and the season beginning Dec. 22. This could be a severe blow for the Warriors, who finished worst in the NBA this season. Thompson didn\u2019t play during the coronavirus-shortened season as he worked back from surgery for a torn ACL in his left knee. He suffered that injury as the Warriors lost the deciding Game 6 of the 2019 NBA Finals to the Toronto Raptors. Golden State finished 15-50 for the NBA\u2019s worst record this season with Thompson out and Curry nursing a broken left hand that sidelined him for more than four months. Two-time NBA Finals MVP Kevin Durant departed in free agency to join the Brooklyn Nets. The 19-year-old Wiseman would be thrilled to make an immediate impact and be in the Rookie of the Year race. He isn\u2019t getting ahead of himself \u2014 hoping to demonstrate a versatile game and ability to do things on both ends of the court with his length and wingspan. \u201cIt\u2019s a great position for me, great fit for me,\u201d Wiseman said. \u201cI\u2019m just ready to go in there and play my role.\u201d"}]
