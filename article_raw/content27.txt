Last year,the LA Clippers sent the face of their franchise (whom they had just signed to a five-year, max contract) to Detroit 10 days before the deadline. This year, the New York Knicks traded the face of their franchise to Dallas with six days to go before the deadline. We\u2019ll be talking about the Kristaps Porzingis trade for a long time. It appears to be another gamble by the Knicks that they can bring established stars to New York. And Kyrie Irving added fuel to the fire by saying (in Madison Square Garden) that we\u2019ll all have to wait until July 1 to see what he\u2019ll do in free agency. We don\u2019t have to wait nearly as long for Thursday\u2019s 3 p.m. ET trade deadline. But the two biggest names on the market \u2014 Anthony Davis and Mike Conley \u2014 are under contract beyond this season, so getting a deal done in the next three days isn\u2019t imperative for the New Orleans Pelicans and Memphis Grizzlies. While speculation runs hot, actual basketball games, some of import, continue to be played. And the Milwaukee Bucks are back at No. 1 in the Power Rankings, having won the most important game (on the road and rather handily) of the last seven days.

He\u2019ll get a chance to do more with Portland. Hood was traded Monday by the Cavaliers, who acquired guards Nik Stauskas and Wade Baldwin \u2014 and their expiring contracts \u2014 along with second-round picks in 2021 and 2023 from the Trail Blazers. Before the trade could be completed, the Cavaliers needed Hood to agree to the deal because he signed a one-year $3.4 million qualifying offer this summer. The 26-year-old waived his no-trade clause to join the Blazers, who are 32-20 and have the fourth best record in the Western Conference. Hood will give Portland some more scoring punch and can take some pressure off guards Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum. He is averaging 12.2 points and 2.5 rebounds this season. The Cavaliers acquired Hood at the trade deadline from Utah last season, and they envisioned him being another scoring option to complement LeBron James and Kevin Love. However, the 6-foot-8 forward never fully fit in with the Cavs, and after starting Cleveland\u2019s first playoff game, he was pulled from the rotation by then-coach Tyronn Lue. The rebuilding Cavaliers are collecting draft assets following a four-year run to the Finals. It is possible they will deal Alec Burks or J.R. Smith before Thursday\u2019s trade deadline. Stauskas and Baldwin have expiring contracts, which will allow the Cavaliers to clear more salary-cap space to pursue free agents. Cleveland has added seven draft picks this season in deals for Hood, Kyle Korver, Sam Dekker and George Hill. To make roster room for Stauskas and Baldwin, the Cavaliers released guard Kobi Simmons from his 10-day contract. Stauskas averaged 6.1 points and 15.3 minutes in 44 games for Portland this season. He also has played for Sacramento, Philadelphia and Brooklyn. The Kings selected him with the No. 8 overall pick in 2014. Baldwin has played in 16 games for the Trail Blazers this season. He also has been with Texas Legends of the NBA\u2019s G League."},{"id":35883,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/week-was-nba-week-16-2019","date":"2019-02-04","title":"Recapping Week 16 in NBA: Nuggets notch key wins, a big trade in N.Y. and more","content":"Take a look back at the week that was in the NBA with a collection of some of the best games, videos, photos, features and more from around the NBA world. * * * Nuggets 95, Grizzlies 92 \u2014 Among centers, only Joel Embiid has scored more clutch points than the Nuggets\u2019 Nikola Jokic. The big man came through on Monday in Memphis, nailing a go-ahead hook shot with 28.9 seconds left that helped Denver cap a 25-point comeback. Pelicans 121, Rockets 116 \u2014 Yes, James Harden kept his 30-point streak rolling (he finished with 37 on Tuesday night). But give credit to the Pelicans, who \u2014 in their first game since word of Anthony Davis\u2019 trade request became known \u2014 rallied to drop Houston. Jahlil Okafor scored 27 points and Jrue Holiday came up big, too, logging six blocks in New Orleans\u2019 victory. Sixers 113, Warriors 104 \u2014 Philadelphia did something it hadn\u2019t done in nearly six years: win a game at Oracle Arena. In addition, it did something no other team had done to Golden State for 11 games: deal them a loss. Behind Joel Embiid (26 points and 20 rebounds), the Sixers got a big road win on the same night they learned Ben Simmons was tabbed as an All-Star reserve. Lakers 123, Clippers 120 (OT) \u2014 Ahh, the comforts of having LeBron James back in the mix. L.A.\u2019s star returned after a 17-game absence and nearly got a triple-double (24 points, 14 rebounds, nine assists) as the Lakers topped the Clippers after blowing a 14-point, fourth-quarter lead. Nuggets 136, Rockets 122 \u2014 Consider this another confidence-boosting win for Denver in a season full of them. Nikola Jokic got it done (31 points, 13 rebounds) and Malik Beasley ran wild (career-high 35 points) to help the Nuggets end a nine-game losing streak to the Rockets. Harden again hit for 30-plus points (25 straight games and counting), but this one was all about Denver, which is off to its best start in NBA history. Warriors 115, Lakers 101 \u2014 Some storylines that you could discuss from this game: Klay Thompson\u2019s return, Stephen Curry\u2019s shooting struggles, the Lakers showing fight vs. the champs and more. The storyline that will resonate for months to come? DeMarcus Cousins\u2019 poster jam over Kyle Kuzma that sparked Golden State\u2019s comeback win. Nuggets 107, Wolves 106 \u2014 Who knows if Nikola Jokic and Karl Anthony-Towns will be foes or teammates come the NBA All-Star draft this week. But if Saturday\u2019s showdown is a preview of a potential playoff series between these bigs and their teams come April, we\u2019ll take a first-round series there, please. Jokic logged a triple-double (13 points, 16 rebounds and 10 assists) while Towns (31 points, 12 rebounds, seven assists) held his own, too, in a fantastic big man matchup. Celtics 134, Thunder 129 \u2014 Behind Kyrie Irving (30 points, 11 assists), the Celtics put an end to OKC\u2019s seven-game win streak \u2026 and did so in thrilling fashion. The Thunder kept the game close in the final minute, but Irving stripped Russell Westbrook with 8.1 seconds left. That eventually led to a pair of Jayson Tatum free throws, which helped seal a big win for Boston. CJ McCollum (30 points, 12-17 FG, 3 reb, 2 stl in 30 minutes) & Damian Lillard (36 points, 12-21 FG, 11 reb, 2 stl in 37 minutes) \u2014 The Jazz came into Wednesday\u2019s showdown with the Blazers looking solid after logging wins in nine of their last 10 games. Then, McCollum and Lillard happened. The big night got started thanks to McCollum, who went 9-for-9 and had 20 points in the first quarter. | Watch | Video box score Joel Embiid (26 points, 8-24 FG, 20 reb, 5 ast, 2 stl in 33 mintues) \u2014 This was supposed to be DeMarcus Cousins\u2019 first chance to shine before the Oracle Arena crowd. However, Embiid had other plans on Thursday night, pounding away at the Warriors en route to a 20-20 game that put an end to Golden State\u2019s 11-game win streak. | Watch | Video box score Luka Doncic (35 points, 13-25 FG, 11 reb, 6 ast in 32 minutes) \u2014 The Mavs\u2019 rookie sensation will participate in the Rising Stars game at NBA All-Star 2019, but he wasn\u2019t picked as a reserve for the All-Star Game itself. Perhaps this showing he delivered on Saturday \u2014 two days after the All-Star reserves were named \u2014 was to show he\u2019s got the kind of stuff worthy of the showcase stage? | Watch | Video box score James Harden (43 points, 12-22 FG, 15-15 FT, 12 reb, 5 ast, 6 stl, 4 blk in 39 minutes) \u2014 We\u2019re getting a little more choosy around here for Harden\u2019s weekly barrages. So, this line he put up against Utah on Saturday gets the nod because of it\u2019s overall greatness and the fact he was one block from logging a 5\u00d75 game. Simply amazing stuff. | Watch | Video box score Buddy Hield (34 points, 12-21 FG, 7-13 3pt FG, 6 reb, 3 ast in 35 minutes) \u2014 The Kings continue to hang around in the West playoff picture, thanks to performances like this from Hield. He set a personal high for 3-pointers made and by night\u2019s end had 180 3-pointers made, topping his single-season career high set in 2017-18 (176). | Watch | Video box score \u201cI thought that they outplayed us, outcoached us, out-physicaled us, out-executed us.

I\u2019ve never seen a smile on him that bright.\u201d \u2014 Bucks forward Giannis Antetokounmpo , on Khris Middleton being named an All-Star reserve \u201cIt\u2019s nothing but a distraction at this point.\u201d \u2014 Celtics guard Kyrie Irving , on the \u201cWe want Kyrie!\u201d chants echoing through Madison Square Garden on Friday \u201cHe\u2019s in a groove, man.

Provided they were able to stay awake, more than 100 million were expected to have tuned in. Some of them were NBA players, who, if nothing else, could at least appreciate Tom Brady\u2019s remarkable feat of capturing his sixth Super Bowl title over 17 years. Here\u2019s a selection of reactions to that and more from Sunday\u2019s big game. "},{"id":35882,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/about-last-night-02-02-2019","date":"2019-02-03","title":"About Last Night: Poster party","content":" With 24 teams playing on the eve before Super Bowl Sunday, it should come as no surprise that Saturday\u2019s NBA slate was loaded with great highlights and memorable performances, the latter of which we\u2019ll get to in just a bit. For now, allow us to wade through an uncommonly impressive assortment of poster dunks. So many, in fact, that we dare not embed them all lest your WiFi disconnect under the strain. Ben Simmons punished Nemanja Bjelica. Brandon Ingram muscled one down over DeMarcus Cousins. Andre Iguodala victimized former teammate JaVale McGee, and enjoyed every bit of it. Nikola Vucevic challenged a pair of Brooklyn Nets, and won. Donovan Mitchell nearly got Nene, but had to settle for an acrobatic three-point play instead. Willie Cauley-Stein gave Joel Embiid a taste of his own medicine. On a different date, any one could have been the play of the night. But on Saturday, there could be only one. OK, three: Tomas Satoransky over Brook Lopez Tough call as to which was better, Satoransky\u2019s enormous finish \u2026 \u2026 or his matter-of-fact explanation. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I would dunk, but I saw the opportunity and I just took flight,\u201d Satoransky said with a literal shrug. Almost as good: Bucks forward Christian Wood\u2019s concern for the well-being of his posterized teammate. Karl-Anthony Towns over Mason Plumlee Towns might be a little awkward at times. But as Plumlee found out the hard way, his combination of size, strength and fluidity is a rare \u2014 and in this instance, devastating \u2014 gift. DeMarcus Cousins over Kyle Kuzma And finally, the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance: Boogie absolutely ends Kuzma. In true Cousins fashion, he drew a technical foul for staring Kuzma down after the finish. But, seriously, how do you NOT gloat a little bit after a dunk like this? Cousins lamented the tech afterward \u2014 \u201cI wish I could have that back,\u201d he said \u2014 but the Warriors weren\u2019t complaining too much. Including the slam and ensuing free throw, they outscored the scrappy Lakers by 22 from that point to claim a 115-101 victory that wasn\u2019t quite as easy as it appeared. \u201cIt brought the arena to life, and it brought the team to life,\u201d said Warriors coach Steve Kerr. As if all those posters weren\u2019t enough, Saturday also saw no shortage of outstanding individual outings: Denver Nuggets All-Star Nikola Jokic got a head start on Super Bowl festivities with this majestic full-court touchdown to Malik Beasley. Bill Walton, eat your heart out: Stop us if you\u2019ve heard this one before: A bat invaded the AT&T Center court, sending Spurs and Pelicans players scrambling. But with Manu Ginobili retired from the pest removal business (and also basketball), a new hero stood and delivered in San Antonio. If you watch closely, even Gregg Popovich is amused! Despite playing half way across the country, somebody decided to ask Brook Lopez what he thought about the recent spate of bat invasions. It was worth it. With four straight Finals appearances (and very likely counting), the Warriors have played the equivalent of nearly a full extra regular season over that span. As such, Kerr was just a little psyched at the prospect of a Nuggets victory, which would give him and his staff the week off instead of forcing them to serve in this year\u2019s All-Star Game. The Nuggets, meanwhile, were just a bit more enthused for their coach, Michael Malone, who secured the honor of coaching Team LeBron thanks to the Nuggets\u2019 37th victory of the season. Ladies and gentlemen, we give you the 70s-inspired splendor of Jarrett Allen\u2019s afro. \u201cKeep runnin\u2019, gunnin\u2019, having fun and playing together,\u201d \u2014 Sacramento Kings guard Buddy Hield on his team\u2019s philosophy.

Nothing but net. Sporting a Batman costume \u2014 cape and all \u2014 The Coyote rushed the court and trapped a live bat Saturday, the second time one of the winged intruders disrupted a Spurs home game this week. The mascot dived to capture the bat with a fishing net near the scorer\u2019s table, getting big cheers from fans, players and Spurs coach Gregg Popovich. The Coyote ended a frantic few seconds with the courageous capture. The bat interrupted the first quarter of a game Thursday night against the New Orleans Pelicans. The refs whistled for a timeout, Spurs player Rudy Gay bolted off the floor and hid behind an official, and LaMarcus Aldridge tried unsuccessfully to hit the bat with a basketball. Seconds later, The Coyote bolted out from the opposite baseline, whiffed with one diving effort in front of a cackling Popovich, then pounced on the bat with his net. An arena worker covered the bat with a towel and took it off the court while the mascot celebrated near center court. After three bats delayed a game Thursday night against Brooklyn, San Antonio had devised a game plan for another invasion. Prior to the game, officials set up lengthy netting to ensnare any bats that flew over the court. The Coyote made that all unnecessary.

With Saturday\u2019s 107-106 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves, the Nuggets (37-15, .712) clinched a tie with the Golden State Warriors for the best record in the Western Conference through games played on Sunday, Feb. 3. According to NBA rules, the first tiebreaker to determine an All-Star Game head coach is better head-to-head record. Denver and Golden State are 1-1 against each other this season. The second tiebreaker is better record against teams in own conference. The Nuggets have a 23-10 (.697) record against Western Conference teams and the Warriors have a 22-10 (.688) record against Western Conference teams, giving Malone the spot over Golden State head coach Steve Kerr.

Milwaukee Bucks head coach Mike Budenholzer and his staff previously earned the spot to coach Team Giannis, captained by Milwaukee\u2019s Giannis Antetokounmpo.

(AP) \u2014 LeBron James was ruled out for the Los Angeles Lakers against the Golden State Warriors, two days after he returned from a 17-game absence with a strained left groin he hurt at Oracle Arena on Christmas night. Coach Luke Walton made the announcement about James\u2019 \u201dload management\u201d some 80 minutes before Saturday night\u2019s tipoff, saying James woke up Friday \u201dpretty sore\u201d after playing 40 minutes in a 123-120 overtime victory over the LA Clippers on Thursday night in his return. James had 24 points, 14 rebounds and nine assists in that game, when the Lakers had hoped to keep James to 32-35 minutes but needed him in overtime. \u201dThere was no taking him out at that point,\u201d Walton said. \u201dWho knows how sore he would have been if wasn\u2019t overtime but I\u2019m sure he still would have been sore. He hadn\u2019t played that type of basketball in five weeks. He does a lot when he\u2019s out on the court.\u201d Walton said by resting James it gives the 34-year-old four-time MVP a few more days to recover before the Lakers play at Indiana on Tuesday night. \u201dHe hadn\u2019t been able to play a lot of basketball prior to that. We\u2019ve got a couple days until our next game, so just load management,\u201d Walton said. \u201dHe was going to come here and kind of feel, get a workout in and see how he felt before making a final decision.\u201d James is averaging 27.2 points, 8.5 rebounds and 7.2 assists. Walton said there may be other times James could need days off for his body to recover. \u201dIt\u2019s a possibility but a lot of it will be dependent on how he\u2019s feeling and what the schedule is like at those times,\u201d Walton said. \u201dRight now, it\u2019s more just him being sore after five weeks of not playing basketball. It is a few days from our last game until our next one in Indy so when me and him talked, spoke, it was \u2018As much as you want to play, let\u2019s make sure you\u2019re making the smart decision,\u2019 so he came over early and the decision was made.\u201d Reserve center Tyson Chandler also was resting for L.A.

Worms everywhere. Per Adam Himmelsbach of The Boston Globe : He might as well have lit a firecracker under the free-agency boardwalk. With the trade deadline buzz already at peak vibrato, Irving injected further chaos, and were the fans at Madison Square Garden ever ready by gametime : Irving heard \u2019em. (Of course he heard. They all hear. It\u2019s the blocking out that makes them pros.) \u201cAt this point, it\u2019s nothing but a distraction honestly.\u201d Irving said to ESPN\u2019s Cassidy Hubbarth after a 113-99 Celtics victory . \u201cI appreciate the fans, I appreciate the support, but it\u2019s really about our team now and what we want to accomplish this season \u2013 and that\u2019s a championship, so my focus is stuck on that.\u201d Irving\u2019s acknowledgement that the Celtics season hasn\u2019t quite come together as expected isn\u2019t news, given the back-and-forth with the young bucks a few weeks back. But paired with the renewed focus on his future, it felt more than a little revealing, the tremor that either passes or ends up an earthquake. Only five months to find out! Man, if it weren\u2019t for ridiculousness happening on such a regular basis in this high-octane season, we might fully appreciate exactly what we\u2019re witnessing through Nikola Jokic\u2019s ascendant campaign. The Nuggets center, recently named to his first All-Star team, put up 31 points (12-15 FGs, 6-6 FTs), 13 rebounds and nine assists to lead a rousing victory over the Houston Rockets. When the big man is posting up this fluidly and then delivering passes like this one: \u2026 what\u2019s anyone supposed to do except watch? Lovely. Can we talk about Paul George for a minute? This dude is balling OUT this year. Newest reason to elevate George into your next MVP conversation: These career- and franchise-best 10 3-pointers. George finished with 43 points (14-23 FGs, 10-16 3FGs), seven rebounds, five assists and two steals as Oklahoma City hammered the Miami Heat. He\u2019s averaging a nightly 27-8-4 while shooting 45 percent overall, 41 percent on 3s and 83 percent at the line. Good grief. Also for the Thunder, Russell Westbrook put up his fifth straight triple-double : 14 points, 12 rebounds, 14 assists. The record for consecutive triple-doubles is eight by (surprise!) Wilt Chamberlain. Russ is currently tied with two others for second place on that list with seven straight games, which he\u2019s done twice \u2013 Nov.-Dec. 2016 and March-April 2017. Can you guess the other players? Probably, but the answer is below either way. After a much-publicized moment of emotion earlier in the day, Rudy Gobert went out and reminded everyone exactly why this particular All-Star snub has created such controversy . His final line against the Atlanta Hawks: 25 points (7-7 FGs, 11-15 FTs), 13 rebounds and two blocks, including this textbook rejection of Kevin Huerter: That draft-night trade between the Hawks and Mavericks hasn\u2019t quite gotten as far from Atlanta as it seemed during that early #HalleLuka run for the 19-year-old Slovenian sensation. Hawks rookie Trae Young, who\u2019s now ripped off 20-plus in seven of his last nine games is even producing productive clunkers. When he shot 1-for-12 against the Bulls on January 23, Young still dished 12 assists and pulled down seven rebounds in a 20-point victory. With his current run of 20-point, 8-assist showings, Young has become the first rookie since Damon Stoudemire in 1996 to log four straight. Either way, I\u2019m here for Young-to-Collins:  TRIVIA ANSWER: Michael Jordan (March 25-April 6, 1989) was most recent. Oscar Robertson holds the other run."},{"id":35879,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/anthony-davis-not-told-pelicans-preferred-destination","date":"2019-02-02","title":"Davis says he feels like it's 'time to move on'","content":"METAIRIE, La. (AP) \u2014 Anthony Davis feels like he\u2019s given the New Orleans Pelicans all he can and that his time to move on has come. \u201cI don\u2019t know how long I\u2019m going to play this game,\u201d said Davis, who turns 26 on March 11. \u201cPeople\u2019s careers are short and I feel like it\u2019s my time to move on.\u201d The All-Star forward and center, who recently informed New Orleans he would like to be traded, said Friday that his intention remains to play for New Orleans as long as he is healthy and under contract with the Pelicans. \u201cObviously, it\u2019s a tough situation, but my intention is to still play and when I\u2019m able to play I\u2019m going to suit up,\u201d said Davis, who has missed six games with a sprained left index finger since his injury occurred at Portland on Jan. 18. While Davis and Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James share an agent, Davis said he has never provided New Orleans a list of preferred destinations and added that where he winds up is \u201con the Pelicans.\u201d \u201cI never gave them a timetable, never gave them a destination,\u201d Davis said, emphasizing that the Pelicans have shown him \u201cnothing but respect \u2026 and I feel like I need to do the same thing for them. \u201cI wanted to do it now just for the simple fact that they have enough time to make the best decision for the organization,\u201d Davis said. The Pelicans are mulling over what to do with the six-time All-Star and several other prominent players as the NBA\u2019s trade deadline approaches on Feb. 7. Davis, forward Julius Randle, forward Nikola Mirotic, guard E\u2019Twaun Moore and guard Elfrid Payton have not played since Davis\u2019s agent made public on Monday his client\u2019s desire to be traded. Some of the sitting players are listed with minor injuries that they\u2019ve played through previously while the Pelicans have put an undermanned team on the court for their past two games. Davis did not make any immediate public statements in the days after agent Rich Paul made the trade request, for which Davis was fined $50,000. However, Davis has remained with the club and broke his silence after Friday\u2019s practice. Davis is under contract with New Orleans through the end of the 2019-20 season. He was drafted by the Pelicans with the first overall pick in 2012 after winning an NCAA national championship with Kentucky and has been named an All-Star the previous five seasons. However, the Pelicans have made the playoffs in only two of his six full NBA seasons and won only won playoff series, sweeping Portland in the first round last season before falling in five games to champion Golden State in the second round. Davis has averaged 29.3 points and 13.3 rebounds per game this season, but has missed the past four games with a sprained left index finger while the Pelicans have fallen to 23-29 heading into Saturday night\u2019s game at San Antonio. Had Davis been committed to remaining in New Orleans, he would be eligible this summer for a five-year, roughly $240 million extension with the Pelicans that would have kicked in beginning with the 2020-21 season. The Pelicans have acknowledged Davis\u2019 preference to be traded and appear inclined to honor it rather than lose him for nothing. But a statement from the franchise made it clear that the Pelicans\u2019 brass are prepared to be patient while awaiting a deal done on their terms and timeline. The implication is that a trade may not come before the Feb. 7 deadline to make a deal this season, and more likely could come after the season, when 2019 draft slots are known and when the Boston Celtics are eligible to enter the fray. Boston, which has a stockpile of draft picks and promising young players as trade bait, is not eligible to trade for Davis under NBA rules until July 1, unless the Celtics also trade away Kyrie Irving. Irving is a factor because of what\u2019s known as the Rose Rule, which says NBA teams cannot trade for more than one player who has signed an extension. Irving currently is playing under an extension signed with Cleveland that has an option year after this season, meaning it could be renegotiated in a way that also allows Boston to bid for Davis."},{"id":35864,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-porzingis-wont-play-mavericks-season","date":"2019-02-02","title":"Report: Kristaps Porzingis unlikely to play for Mavericks in 2018-19","content":" Kristaps Porzingis has been traded to Dallas after three-plus seasons in New York, but per a report by ESPN\u2019s Tim MacMahon , the 7-foot-3 big man isn\u2019t expected to return to the court this season as he continues to recover from a torn ACL in his left knee.

Save for an uncharacteristic lapse to end the month with their 132-105 loss to Portland, the Jazz were one the NBA\u2019s best teams in January. Rallying behind talented leaders Rudy Gobert and Donovan Mitchell \u2015 both at the forefront of All-Star snubs discussions \u2015 Utah has rallied from a disappointing start to the season. Gobert led all players with 204 rebounds in January and finished second in blocks with 37. Mitchell averaged 27.7 points per game \u2015 the highest mark he\u2019s had in a calendar month in his young career \u2015 while shooting 41 percent from beyond the arc. As a team, Utah closed out the month winning nine of its last 11 games, including a 114-108 triumph over the Denver Nuggets. Prior to that stretch, the Jazz were 20-21 and stationed outside of the Western Conference playoff mix. That\u2019s when their second-half switch was turned on, a button that appears to be hit practically annually. January is the same month the Jazz began their vaunted run last season, an exemplary stretch in which they won 21 out of 23 games after starting the season 19-28. Heading into February, Quin Snyder\u2019s unit has positioned themselves for another mid-season playoff push. The Jazz currently sit at seventh place in the West, one game ahead of the eighth-place LA Clippers and two games ahead of the ninth-place Los Angeles Lakers. With LeBron James back in the fold (and a mega trade possibly on the horizon), there is a chance the Jazz or Clippers are on the outside looking in come April. But the former isn\u2019t playing like they\u2019ll be the ones left out. Here\u2019s a look at the best records, offenses and defenses based on numbers from Jan. 1 to Jan. 31 only. The Nets captured double-digit wins in a calendar month for the first time since March of 2014. In the West, a 12-4 January stretch has the Nuggets at 35-15 overall, their best record through 50 games in franchise history. There\u2019s a good chance this crop will remain the same for the rest of 2018-19. Another ghastly month in New York \u2015 part of a 48-day stretch with just one win \u2015 ended with Kristaps Porzingis wanting out of town and being traded to Dallas . Meanwhile, the Grizzlies and Suns are no longer battling for someone with the last name Brooks , but instead\u2026 Williamson? ( Points scored per 100 possessions ) We all knew Golden State would overcome its early-season inconsistency and go on some pristine run, sparked by its deep pool of All-Stars. The Sixers halted that streak on the last day of the month and illustrated how dangerous their own All-Stars are. Portland had its best month of the season and, oh yeah, James Harden did some pretty unbelievable stuff to spark Houston\u2019s offense. With LeBron sidelined for essentially the entire month, the Lakers took a sharp drop offensively to rank 27th in the league throughout January. Not far behind were the Pistons, whose offensive woes continued despite Blake Griffin having a career season. Detroit finished the month with a 6-10 record, on par with its NFL team. ( Points allowed per 100 possessions ) Milwaukee moved ahead of Oklahoma City in mid-January to boast the NBA\u2019s best defense overall this season, while Brad Stevens\u2019 crew continues to stay in the mix. The most impressive ascent comes from the Wizards, who came into January with the third-worst defense in the league, but have showcased a \u201dNew Year, New Me\u201d mindset on that end in 2019. While the talk in Houston is solely centered around Harden\u2019s monster scoring streak, the Rockets are still missing the elite defensive efficiency that helped generate 65 wins last season. In the East, Chicago hasn\u2019t improved on either side of the ball since firing coach Fred Hoiberg, and the Cavaliers are in the midst of their worst defensive season by far since ratings became available in 1973."},{"id":35886,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/dangelo-russell-replaces-victor-oladipo-all-star-roster","date":"2019-02-01","title":"Nets' Russell replaces injured Oladipo in All-Star Game","content":" NEW YORK \u2014 Brooklyn Nets guard D\u2019Angelo Russell has been named by NBA Commissioner Adam Silver to replace injured Indiana Pacers guard Victor Oladipo in the 2019 NBA All-Star Game , which will be played on Sunday, Feb. 17 at Spectrum Center in Charlotte, North Carolina.

He\u2019s also shooting a league-high 65 percent from 2-point range this season. \u201cI feel disrespected,\u201d Gobert told reporters in Salt Lake City. \u201cDisrespectful, not only towards me but towards the team, the organization and towards the game. All the coaches preach about defense. Every day they talk about defense, they talk about how important it is to get stops in order to win basketball games.

Irving has a player option for next season, but said in early October at a Celtics fan event at TD Garden: \u201cIf you guys will have me back, I plan on re-signing here.\u201d That notion has apparently changed for Irving.  As he spoke with reporters in New York before tonight\u2019s road showdown with the Knicks, Irving offered up a near 180-degree turn on his stance. With rumors swirling about the New York Knicks and other teams and that Irving may not be fully committed to his earlier stance to stay in Boston, Irving was asked about his mindset in re-signing. His answer?: \u201cAsk me July 1.\u201d Further, Irving said of his potential change of heart about staying in Boston: \u201cI don\u2019t owe anybody [expletive].\u201d \u201cAt the end of the day I spent the last eight years trying to do what everybody else wanted me to do in terms of making my decisions and trying to validate through the media, through other personnel, managers, anybody in this business,\u201d Irving said. \u201cI\u2019m not worrried about a reputation, I\u2019m not worried about a legacy to leave, I\u2019m just trying to be a human being and make the best decision for me and my family.\u201d http:\/\/At%20the%20end%20of%20the%20day%20I%20spent%20the%20last%20eight%20years%20trying%20to%20do%20what%20everybody%20else%20wanted%20me%20to%20do%20in%20terms%20of%20making%20my%20decisi The July 1 date is when free agency opens in the NBA and when, in theory, Irving could re-sign with the Celtics \u2026 or move on. The questioning of Irving comes in the wake of the Knicks clearing salary cap space with their blockbuster trade of Kristaps Porzingis yesterday to the Dallas Mavericks. By making that trade, the Knicks could potentially have enough salary cap space to sign Irving and perhaps another top-level free agent. Still, Irving in now way closed the door on staying with Boston, either. He said he has confidence in the team, adding: \u201cobviously Boston is still at the head of the race,\u201d in keeping his services. \u201cWhat excited me a lot about the beginning of the season was the opportunity to come into this season really just doing what we planned on doing, set a goal and go after it and then see what happens at the end of the season,\u201d Irving said. \u201cThat was the plan before and that\u2019s still the plan now.\u201d Irving is averaging 23.7 points. 4.8 rebounds and 6.9 assists per game this season for the Celtics, who are 32-19 and No. 4 in the Eastern Conference . The six-time All-Star\u2019s future has been a trending topic entering the final year of his contract. Rumors persisted that several teams, including the nearby Knicks, were harboring hopes luring Irving via free agency.more than the rest. That\u2019s a challenge in itself and I willingly accept \u2026 I\u2019m looking forward to it.\u201d On Oct. 5, Irving spoke with reporters and reiterated his commitment to re-sign with the Celtics when the summer of 2019 rolls around. \u201cI\u2019m talking to our media people and we\u2019re just like \u2018I think you\u2019re supposed to say something.\u2019 I\u2019m like, you know what, timing is everything with this. I\u2019m glad I can share this with the Boston fans and everybody there,\u201d Irving said. \u201cI was just happy to get it done with. I just have every intent to sign back. I just wanted to clear that up.\u201d Irving said it became clear to him recently he wanted to re-sign with Boston and that he aspires to finish his career among the franchise\u2019s greats. \u201cI do have a dream of putting my No. 11 in the rafters one day if I\u2019m so blessed to do that,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of great players have come before me, but to throw my name in Boston Celtics tradition and history is something I\u2019m glad I can do and plan on doing.

The only place where the calendar could complicate things is for LeBron James and his ability to catch back up in the Kia MVP race he was eyeballs deep in on Christmas morning. Now that the Lakers\u2019 resident superstar has finally returned to the lineup after a five-week absence caused by that groin injury he suffered Christmas Day , we\u2019re left to wonder if there\u2019s enough time left for LeBron to get back in the mix? The math doesn\u2019t look good. Seventeen games in street clothes, even for a player capable of operating at the level LeBron can for a sustained period, is a huge chunk of time to make up for. And he didn\u2019t hide the fact that the weeks away from game activity have taken a toll. \u201cI\u2019m not feeling particularly great right now,\u201d James said. \u201cDefinitely ecstatic about being back out there with my guys and getting a great road win versus a team that we\u2019re kind of climbing [against] in the playoff race. After being out five weeks, I\u2019m feeling it right now. I wish I could click my shoes together and be home right now in my bed, but it was great to be back out there.\u201d Still, the Lakers\u2019 remaining 30 games simply might not provide a large enough canvass for LeBron to finish what he started in his first season in Los Angeles. And who knows what next week\u2019s trade deadline will (or won\u2019t) bring? Then again, James did come off the shelf with a vintage effort \u2014 flirting with a near triple-double (24 points, 14 rebounds and nine assists in 40 minutes) \u2014 in a much-needed overtime win over the Los Angeles Clippers Thursday night. And if we\u2019ve learned anything in this crazy season (raise your hand if you thought a Kristaps Porzingis trade would happen days after Anthony Davis made his trade desires known), it\u2019s that anything is possible. There could be plenty of time for LeBron to close the gap on the players currently occupying the top spots in the Kia Race to the MVP Ladder. * * * The top five this week in the 2018-19 Kia Race to the MVP Ladder: * * * Last week:  No. 1 Season stats:  36.3 points, 8.1 assists, 6.7 rebounds, 2.1 steals Harden\u2019s case for a second straight Kia MVP got it\u2019s strongest jolt of energy from his monstrous January run that saw him average a staggering 43.6 points (on .430 shooting, .335 shooting), 8.7 rebounds, 7.6 assists, 2.1 steals and 1.2 blocks. As crazy as it sounds, some of Harden\u2019s finest defensive work we\u2019ve seen also came during his current stretch of offensive brilliance. So it\u2019s not as if he was just carrying the Rockets offensively while Chris Paul, Clint Capela and other key players went in and out of the the rotation due to injury. But for all of the deserved hype surrounding Harden\u2019s run of 30-point games ( now at 24 ), the real heavy lifting is still to come. Harden\u2019s pushed ahead to the front of this race but will have to keep it up to hold off the field. And now that Paul his back, his nuclear usage rate figures to come back to human levels. If coach Mike D\u2019Antoni is planning properly, he\u2019ll do whatever else he can to ease the burden on his star to make sure he\u2019s properly rested for a potential deep playoff run. Last week:  No. 2 Season stats:  26.4 points, 12.6 rebounds, 5.9 assists, 1.5 steals, 1.4 blocks Antetokounmpo will have plenty of company in Charlotte for the 68th All-Star Game now that Khris Middleton has earned his first All-Star nod and Mike Budenholzer and his staff will serve as the coaches representing Team Giannis. There\u2019s no doubt \u201cThe Greek Freak\u201d has taken his game to another level this season. But he\u2019s far from a one-man show, which was clear to see as the Bucks wrapped up the season series with the Raptors (3-1) with an impressive road win Thursday night . Giannis finished with 19 points (on 7-for-13 shooting), nine rebounds, five assists, four steals and two blocks and dominated the floor. He did so while another MVP candidate, Kawhi Leonard \u2014 who is an elite defender \u2014 was unable to slow Antetokounmpo down. The Bucks have clearly established themselves as the team to beat in the Eastern Conference heading into the All-Star break and now have to stay locked in and focused through the stretch run of the regular season to hold on to that distinction. It shouldn\u2019t be a problem, sustaining the energy, with all of the good vibrations surrounding the franchise right now. That\u2019s especially true when you are drafting off of the juice Antetokounmpo provides. Last week:  No. 3 Season stats:  29.6 points, 5.4 assists, 5.1 rebounds, 1.2 steals Curry did everything he could to keep the Warriors\u2019 win streak going, but not even his 41 points (including a 10-for-18 showing from 3-point range) was enough to hold off the Philadelphia 76ers on Thursday . With his \u201cSplash Brother\u201d and fellow Western Conference All-Star Klay Thompson missing from the lineup with an undisclosed illness, the Warriors couldn\u2019t find enough pop offensively to keep up with a Sixers team that pounded them inside. The loss overshadows what\u2019s been an absolutely wicked January run for Curry \u2014 31.3 points (on .515 shooting, .460 from 3-point range), 5.6 assists and 4.9 rebounds as the Warriors went 11-2. Curry\u2019s regained his MVP form after that adductor strain cost him all but three games in December. Curry had just finished off a monster November (33.0 points per game on .549 shooting, .529 from deep, 5.9 assists, 5.0 rebounds and 1.2 steals) even better than his past month\u2019s worth of work. Last week:  No. 3 Season stats:  27.2 point, 13.4 rebounds, 3.6 assists, 1.9 blocks No one enjoys showcase games more than Embiid, who put his entire arsenal on display Thursday night in a huge road win against the Warriors . He outplayed DeMarcus Cousins in his home debut, finishing with 26 points (bolstered by a 10-for-12 showing from the free throw line), 20 rebounds, five assists and two steals. It was a statement win for the Sixers and an interesting snapshot of how they could potentially match up against the champs. Whether or not the Sixers have what it takes to come out of the East remains to be seen, no matter how confident Embiid is about their prospects. What is no longer up for debate is Embiid\u2019s ability to stick out in a crowd, even one overrun with other All-Stars, as was the case Thursday in Oakland. Both Embiid and Ben Simmons, who received his All-Star news before the game, physically overwhelmed the Warriors at critical times in the game. It\u2019s a recipe coach Brett Brown will surely use repeatedly down the stretch this season. Last week:  No. 5 Season stats:  27.3 points, 8.0 rebounds, 4.0 assists, 2.3 steals If the Thunder have truly become a clear danger to the Golden State Warriors\u2019 stranglehold on the Western Conference throne, it\u2019s because of George\u2019s play. Russell Westbrook was piling up triple-doubles and collecting individual hardware before George showed up. And their inaugural season together, however choppy it was early, has given way to a second season where they have clearly defined roles. There\u2019s an ease in their give-and-take that signals huge things to come for these two All-Stars (and everyone else along for the ride). And if that ride includes more of what we saw from George in Tuesday\u2019s win over Orlando (31 of his 37 points before half-time) and more of what we saw from him to finish January (29.3 points, 8.2 rebounds, 4.3 assists and 2.9 steals), all of the momentum being built now will pay off handsomely in the coming months. * * * 6.

The Knicks receive Dennis Smith Jr., DeAndre Jordan, Wesley Matthews and two future first-round draft picks from the Mavericks in the deal. Courtney Lee, Tim Hardaway Jr. and Trey Burke are headed to Dallas as the Knicks look to create cap space for free agency this summer. Porzingis, who will become a restricted free agent this summer, reportedly plans to sign the qualifying offer with Dallas, which would set the stage for him to become an unrestricted free agent in 2020. Earlier on Thursday, ESPN\u2019s Wojnarowski and Ramona Shelbourne reported that Porzingis met with team management and left them with the impression that he would prefer to be traded before next Thursday\u2019s NBA trade deadline. \u201cWhen he came in today, it was clear to us that it was time to pull the trigger on something,\u201d Knicks President Steve Mills said Thursday. That was a seven-player swap with the Dallas Mavericks that also netted New York two future first-round draft picks and possibly enough room to afford two top free agents this summer. Porzingis has been sidelined for nearly a year after tearing his left ACL. The Knicks said recently he would undergo testing during the middle of February that could have determined if he would be able to return this season. \u201cAs is standard for this time of year, we were exploring various option on potential trades,\u201d said GM Scott Perry in the Knicks\u2019 official release . \u201cConsidering uncertainty regarding Kristaps\u2019 free agent status and his request today to be traded, we made a trade that we are confident improves the franchise. We thank Kristaps, Tim, Courtney and Trey for their contributions and with them all the best.\u201d > Players React To Porzingis Trade Porzingis talked with Knicks management about the state of the franchise and his future with the team. Porzingis and his brother, Janis, who is also his agent, expressed their frustration with the franchise\u2019s losing ways, past dysfunction on the team and uncertainty over creating a sustainable, successful organization, Wojarowski reports . Porzingis would join forces with rookie sensation Luka Doncic in Dallas. The two can form an intriguing international frontcourt. They both played professionally in Spain before coming to the NBA as top-five picks. \u201cHe\u2019s big, he can shoot, he can rebound. He can do a lot of things,\u201d said Doncic, who was with the Mavericks at their game in Detroit. \u201cI think he can be one of the best players in this league.\u201d The Knicks, for their part, felt like they did well in the trade. \u201cWe feel like we did the right thing,\u201d Mills said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re trying to think about how you want to build your team for the long term, you don\u2019t want to commit a max (contract) to a player who clearly says to you he doesn\u2019t want to be here.\u201d The former No. 4 overall pick of the 2015 Draft, Porzings was named an All-Star in 2017-18, but his ACL injury occurred days after that and he never got to play in that game. The Knicks have never won more than 32 games in each of Porzingis\u2019 three seasons and he played for three coaches \u2014 Derek Fisher, Kurt Rambis and Jeff Hornacek \u2014 during that span. In December, team president Steve Mills said the team was pleased with Porzingis\u2019 recovery from his ACL, and another round of testing scheduled for mid-February could clarify his timeline for his return. Porzingis was hurt Feb. 6 after landing on a dunk in a game against Milwaukee. The Knicks are last in the Eastern Conference at 10-40. The 7-foot-3 Porzingis averaged 17.8 points and 7.1 rebounds in New York, where he was expected to be the Knicks\u2019 franchise player for years. But they declined to give him a contract extension before this season \u2013 they say he was in agreement with that decision \u2013 and now by trading him and Hardaway seem instead to be gearing up to pursue players in free agency, with nearly $70 million in cap space. Hardaway has two more years and about $37 million left on his contract, and moving that was necessary if the Knicks were going to find a way to open the most cap space possible. New York (10-40) has the worst record in the NBA and is headed toward landing a high pick in the draft. Then the Knicks will be set up to be big spenders in a free agent market that could include Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Kyrie Irving and more. But they won\u2019t have Porzingis, who they once believed was the kind of talent who could help attract those players. The Latvian has 3-point range on offense and shot-blocking skills on defense, and had made his first All-Star team just before tearing his ACL after a dunk against Milwaukee on Feb. 6. He had been frustrated with the franchise before, skipping his exit meeting after his second season before returning to Europe for the summer. But Knicks coach David Fizdale had said Porzingis was frequently around the team even while he couldn\u2019t play, taking part in meetings and some activities on the court. However, Mills and Perry saw otherwise, noticing how often Porzingis was in the gym and how long he stayed when he did come.  He was there Thursday, and after a meeting the Knicks had their answers. \u201cWe wanted a confirmation from him whether he was completely in or out,\u201d Mills said, \u201cand he made it clear to us when he came in to meet with us that no longer wanted to be part of our group.\u201d The most valuable player in the deal from the Knicks\u2019 standpoint is likely Smith, the point guard they passed on with the No. 8 pick in 2017 when they instead took Frank Ntilikina. The Mavericks took Smith one pick later, and he posted the second triple-double of his career Wednesday when Dallas won at Madison Square Garden. Jordan is a former U.S. Olympian and top defensive center. The Knicks said they wanted to keep Jordan and Matthews, believing they could help their younger players.

LeBron James has finally reported for duty, and who would\u2019ve thought he\u2019d beat Anthony Davis to the team\u2019s lineup? Five weeks felt like forever to the franchise as they sweated out LeBron\u2019s 17-game absence from a groin injury. It was the first injury of any concern in his 16-year career, and given his workload over such time, maybe that will serve as one of the more amazing feats by LeBron. A sense of normalcy crept back into the Lakers\u2019 season if only for a night when LeBron suited up Thursday, played 40 minutes without a hiccup, and \u2014 on the surface anyway \u2014 all seemed well. That doesn\u2019t mean all is well. All is very confusing. The Lakers are juggling a pair of sensitive uncertainties: Davis and whether they can swing a deal to acquire the New Orleans Pelicans\u2019 All-NBA player \u2026 and the Western Conference playoff chase. The Davis dilemma has the more urgent expiration date. Thursday\u2019s deadline means one way or another, the Lakers will have clarity on one of the more uncomfortable scenarios in recent memory. And when there\u2019s finally a verdict, and no matter what it is, there will be a sense of relief (to an extent). That\u2019s because the young core of the Lakers are essentially being held hostage while the club enthusiastically tries to pawn one of two or all of them off in order to get Davis. Imagine being Kyle Kuzma, Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram and\/or Josh Hart now and figuring out what they\u2019re going through. This Davis trade request is in their heads. They don\u2019t know if by next week they\u2019ll be passing the ball to LeBron or \u2026 E\u2019Twuan Moore. They don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll be playing in L.A. or \u2026 La. They don\u2019t know if LeBron, whose agency also represents Davis and is helping to orchestrate his New Orleans exit, has their back or is sticking a fork in it behind the scenes. There\u2019s so much at work here, so many moving parts, so much head scratching. By all indications, there are exploratory conversations between the Lakers and Pelicans about what it will take to land Davis. The Lakers are dangling young players and Draft picks, and that might not be enough. Meanwhile, the Pelicans are dealing with their own prickly situation. The trade request caused a measure of saltiness and the front office doesn\u2019t appear to be warm to the idea of having Davis around. The Pelicans scrubbed him from their pre-game video intros, as though he doesn\u2019t exist anymore. He\u2019s still on the team bench during games but it\u2019s a weird optic. Davis is with a team he doesn\u2019t feel is good enough for him anymore. In a perfect world, the Pelicans would take their time and weigh considerable offers from other teams, but that may stretch until this summer. Davis\u2019 contract only runs one more season. If he tells other teams he won\u2019t sign an extension with them, he can sabotage deals. Why would those teams surrender assets for a one-year rental? The stare-down continues as the weekend approaches and LeBron returns to face the league-leading Golden State Warriors in Oakland on Saturday ( 8:30 ET, ABC ). \u201cWith LeBron back, we have to adjust again as to how we play,\u201d said coach Luke Walton. \u201cBut he looked fine to me.\u201d He was initially on a 25-minute restriction Thursday, but played the entire overtime in the Lakers\u2019 win. He was feeling and looking stronger as the game progressed, finishing with 24 points, 14 rebounds and nine assists. \u201cI\u2019m about 80 (percent) right now,\u201d James said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take me a while to get my rhythm back. We got a lot of games coming up. I want to see how my body feels tomorrow after playing tonight. Toughest stretch of my career. I worked my butt off to get back to this point. \u201cI wasn\u2019t positive every day throughout this process. There were times when I felt great and thought I could come back faster. It wasn\u2019t reacting the right way so I had to be patient. I\u2019d never been injured before like that. I didn\u2019t come here to put on a suit everyday. I came here to put on a jersey, when you see your team struggle and you can\u2019t help them in a suit and tie, that was frustrating.\u201d The Lakers went 6-11 without LeBron and dropped games to the likes of the New York Knicks, Sacramento Kings, Cleveland Cavaliers and two to the Minnesota Timberwolves. It was unsightly and discouraging at times, and the losing \u2014 combined with LeBron\u2019s sense of mortality \u2014 perhaps kick-started the Davis chase. Perhaps team president Magic Johnson and GM Rob Pelinka (with input from LeBron) decided it\u2019s time to get into the express lane, at the expense of youth, and quicken the process. \u201cI\u2019m excited about being back out there with my guys,\u201d James said. \u201cWe\u2019re ready for the challenge. We want to get back into a groove and get a playoff spot. That\u2019s what I\u2019m here fore, that\u2019s what we\u2019re here for.\u201d The playoff chase begins in earnest for any team in the West with those aspirations. To reach 48 wins, which should be enough for a playoff spot, the Lakers need to win 21 of their last 30. And given the stiff competition out West, that likely means LeBron will need to play meaningful games in April \u2014 a time which normally would call for rest \u2014 and perform at a high level, too. Keep in mind if the Lakers are gutted to get Davis, the supporting cast around the two stars will be depleted. In such a case, the real pursuit of the Warriors wouldn\u2019t realistically begin until next season. Even that depends on what else the Lakers can do this summer with their salary-cap surplus. Remember, LeBron is 34 \u2026 and just sat for the longest stretch of his career. When you sign LeBron, the end game is a championship or at the very least, a reasonable chase. The Lakers are getting him on the back end, so in this situation, there\u2019s a clock and the Lakers are on it. Time is ticking on their chances of getting Davis this season in what would be a major shakeup. And time is also ticking on their playoff pursuit, which if it fails, would be a major letdown. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

James came up one assist shy of a triple-double, finishing with 24 points and 14 rebounds in his first game since Christmas Day when he strained his left groin. With no minutes restriction, LeBron paced himself and lacked his usual explosiveness on drives to the rim. But he was clutch in overtime, hitting the go-ahead jumper with 1:15 left and the feeding Lance Stephenson for a fastbreak, and-1 layup that essentially sealed the game. \u201cDefinitely ecstatic about being back out there with my guys,\u201d James said after the Lakers\u2019 victory, \u201cbut after being out five weeks, you know, I\u2019m feeling it right now .\u201d Clippers coach Doc Rivers couldn\u2019t believe the call that sent Stephenson to the line. In fact, he thought Stephenson should have been hit with a flagrant foul for elbowing Boban Marjanovic. \u201c I though it would be overturned ,\u201d Rivers said at his postgame news conference. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you can come to that judgement.\u201d So maybe the Warriors are not invincible, even with DeMarcus Cousins back in business. Joel Embiid had 26 points and 20 rebounds to spoil Cousins\u2019 home debut with the Warriors, and the 76ers snapped Golden State\u2019s 11-game winning streak with a 113-104 victory . In his toughest test since returning from a left Achilles\u2019 tendon injury, Cousins collected seven points on 3-for-10 shooting and six rebounds in 25 minutes. Embiid had a lot to do with that. \u201cObviously, I\u2019m still not where I want to be,\u201d Cousins said after the game. \u201cI\u2019m working my tail off every day to get back to being that player or better. This process isn\u2019t over for me.\u201d With Klay Thompson scratched due to illness, the Warriors struggled from deep. Not Stephen Curry, of course. He scored 41 points with 10 3-pointers. The rest of the team went 1-of-20 from 3-point range. Steve Kerr was not pleased with his team\u2019s effort. \u201cIt was a little bit of a pick-up game out there,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re just out there launching, not playing with any mindfulness at all out there. You can\u2019t do that in this league.\u201d Kristaps Porzingis is headed to Dallas after a surprising trade the Knicks say the All-Star forward requested. The deal came together after Porzingis met briefly with Knicks management Thursday and left franchise officials with the impression that he wanted to be traded, sources told ESPN . Hours later, Porzingis\u2019 wish was granted. Porzingis posted a goodbye message to New York and the Knicks fans on Twitter and Instagram after the trade became official. Later in the evening Porzingis hinted there may be more to the story when he posted a cryptic Instagram story that read: \u201cThe truth will come out :)\u201d The NBA announced the 14 reserves for the 2019 All-Star Game , four of whom will be first-time All-Stars: Denver\u2019s Nikola Jokic, Milwaukee\u2019s Khris Middleton, Philadelphia\u2019s Ben Simmons and Orlando\u2019s Nikola Vucevic. Jokic, who became the first Nuggets All-Star since Carmelo Anthony in 2011, revealed the pandemonium that resulted when he heard the news. \u201cMy girlfriend started to cry and my brother started yelling and screaming,\u201d Jokic said on TNT. Among the potentially deserving players who did not make the cut were Luka Doncic, Andre Drummond, Rudy Gobert, Tobias Harris and Donovan Mitchell. Doncic, who was among the leaders throughout the voting process, was bidding to become the first rookie selected since Blake Griffin in 2011. He learned of the bad news minutes before tipoff. The Nets-Spurs game was delayed for 2 1\/2 minutes early in the first quarter when three bats began hovering just above the court. Officials had players return to the bench as stadium staff, security and ballboys attempted to shoo the bats away with towels. A stadium official eventually brought out a net, but the bats were scared up to the rafters. Some fans shouted \u201cManu! Manu!\u201d in tribute to recently retired Manu Ginobili, who famously swatted a bat with his hands in 2009. Milwaukee coach Mike Budenholzer and his staff are heading to the All-Star Game. The Bucks\u2019 105-92 victory over the Toronto Raptors clinched the best record in the Eastern Conference through games played on Sunday, Feb. 3. As a result, Budenholzer will coach in the All-Star Game for the second time in five years. He also coached in 2015, when he was with the Atlanta Hawks. \u201cIt\u2019s a great honor,\u201d Budenholzer said. \u201cIt says a lot about our team.

The previous record was held by Isiah Thomas, who had 442 points in March 1983. \u2022 Giannis Antetokounmpo and Khris Middleton are the first Bucks duo to be selected to an NBA All-Star game since Ray Allen and Glenn Robinson made it in 2001. \u2022 Andre Drummond posted his eighth 20-point, 20-rebound game of the season, the most such games by any player before the All-Star break since Kevin Willis in 1991-92."},{"id":35920,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/release-budenholzer-all-star-coach-team-giannis","date":"2019-02-01","title":"Milwaukee's Mike Budenholzer earns spot as head coach of Team Giannis in 2019 NBA All-Star Game","content":" NEW YORK \u2014 Milwaukee Bucks head coach Mike Budenholzer and his staff will coach Team Giannis in the 2019 NBA All-Star Game on Sunday, Feb. 17 at Spectrum Center in Charlotte, N.C. The 68th NBA All-Star Game, featuring Team LeBron vs. Team Giannis, will air live at 8 p.m. ET on TNT and ESPN Radio in the United States. NBA All-Star 2019 will reach fans in more than 200 countries and territories in more than 40 languages. With Thursday\u2019s 105-92 victory over the Toronto Raptors, the Bucks (37-13, .740) clinched the best record in the Eastern Conference through games played on Sunday, Feb. 3. As a result, Budenholzer earned the spot to coach Team Giannis over the 13 other eligible Eastern Conference head coaches. The Detroit Pistons\u2019 Dwane Casey was ineligible because he coached Team LeBron in the 2018 NBA All-Star Game as head coach of the Raptors.  Each NBA All-Star Game head coach will lead the team that includes the captain from the same conference. Budenholzer and his staff will coach the All-Star team captained by their own player, Milwaukee\u2019s Giannis Antetokounmpo. The head coach of the team with the Western Conference\u2019s best record through games of Feb. 3 will coach the All-Star team captained by the Los Angeles Lakers\u2019 LeBron James. Houston Rockets head coach Mike D\u2019Antoni is ineligible because he led Team Stephen in last year\u2019s All-Star Game. This marks the second NBA All-Star Game head coaching honor for Budenholzer, who led the Eastern Conference in 2015 as head coach of the Atlanta Hawks. Budenholzer is the Bucks\u2019 second All-Star Game head coach, joining Larry Costello (1971 and 1974).

The 68th NBA All-Star Game, featuring Team LeBron vs. Team Giannis , will take place on Sunday, Feb. 17 at 8 p.m. ET at Spectrum Center in Charlotte, N.C.

The team rosters will be revealed on TNT in a special NBA All-Star Draft Show on Thursday, Feb. 7 at 7 p.m. ET. James and Antetokounmpo will make their picks without regard for a player\u2019s conference affiliation or position. Each captain will choose 11 players to complete a 12-man roster. The 2019 NBA All-Star Draft rules include: The 10 All-Star Game starters, unveiled last week, were selected by fans, current NBA players and a media panel. The Eastern Conference starter pool consists of Antetokounmpo, Philadelphia\u2019s Joel Embiid, Toronto\u2019s Kawhi Leonard, the Boston Celtics\u2019 Kyrie Irving and the Charlotte Hornets\u2019 Kemba Walker. The Western Conference starter pool is James, Golden State\u2019s Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant, Oklahoma City\u2019s Paul George and the Houston Rockets\u2019 James Harden. The 14 All-Star Game reserves were selected by the NBA\u2019s 30 head coaches. The coaches voted for seven players in their respective conferences \u2013 two guards, three frontcourt players and two additional players at either position group. They were not permitted to vote for players from their own team. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver will select the replacement for any player unable to participate in the All-Star Game, choosing a player from the same conference as the player who is being replaced. Team LeBron will be coached by the head coach from the Western Conference team with the best record through games played on Sunday, Feb. 3. Team Giannis will be led by the head coach from the Eastern Conference team with the best record through games played on Feb. 3. Below is a closer look at the NBA All-Star Game reserves and a complete list of this year\u2019s All-Star selections. LaMarcus Aldridge, Spurs (7th All-Star selection) Aldridge is an All-Star for the seventh time in the last eight seasons. The Spurs have now had at least one player selected to 21 consecutive All-Star Games, the NBA\u2019s longest active streak. Anthony Davis, Pelicans (6th All-Star selection) An All-Star for the sixth year in a row, Davis scored a record 52 points in the 2017 All-Star Game. Nikola Joki\u0107, Nuggets (1st All-Star selection) Selected with the 41st overall pick in the 2014 NBA Draft, the Serbian center is Denver\u2019s first All-Star since the 2010-11 season (Carmelo Anthony). Damian Lillard, Trail Blazers (4th All-Star selection) Lillard is the fourth player to earn at least four All-Star nods with Portland, joining Clyde Drexler (eight), Aldridge (four) and Sidney Wicks (four). Klay Thompson, Warriors (5th All-Star selection) This marks the fifth consecutive All-Star selection for Thompson, who made a game-high five three-pointers and scored 15 points in the 2018 All-Star Game. Karl-Anthony Towns, Timberwolves (2nd All-Star selection) Towns is the third player to be named an All-Star multiple times with Minnesota, along with Kevin Garnett (10) and Kevin Love (three). Russell Westbrook, Thunder (8th All-Star selection) An All-Star for the eighth time in the last nine seasons, Westbrook is the only player to win the Kia NBA All-Star MVP Award outright in back-to-back years (2015 and 2016). Bradley Beal, Wizards (2nd All-Star selection) This is the second straight All-Star selection for Beal, who scored 14 points in his All-Star Game debut last year. Blake Griffin (6th All-Star selection) Griffin is set to appear in the All-Star Game for the first time since 2014, when he scored 38 points as a member of the LA Clippers.

Khris Middleton, Bucks (1st All-Star selection) The 39th overall pick in the 2012 NBA Draft joins Antetokounmpo to give Milwaukee multiple All-Stars in the same season for the first time since 2000-01 (Ray Allen and Glenn Robinson). Victor Oladipo, Pacers (2nd All-Star selection) Oladipo has been named an All-Star in each of his two seasons with Indiana. He sustained a season-ending ruptured quad tendon in his right knee on Jan. 23. Ben Simmons, 76ers (1st All-Star selection) The reigning Kia NBA Rookie of the Year makes his All-Star debut in his second season \u2013 just as Philadelphia teammate Embiid did last year. Nikola Vu\u010devi\u0107, Magic (1st All-Star selection) The eight-year NBA veteran from Montenegro is Orlando\u2019s first All-Star selection since the 2011-12 season (Dwight Howard).

The All-Star forward, who has only played four games this season, took part in a full contact, 5-on-5 scrimmage on Thursday, a major step in his recovery from left foot surgery. \u201cHe actually did pretty well,\u201d Cavs coach Larry Drew said following the encouraging workout. \u201cMoved around really well. Got a little winded, which is expected. It\u2019s the first time he\u2019s really been in a contact situation where we actually went up and down and there was actual contact. I thought he moved really well, shot the basketball well.\u201d Love has been out since late October after undergoing surgery on his left foot, which he injured in Cleveland\u2019s exhibition opener against Boston. The 30-year-old tried to play through the pain early in the regular season before doctors recommended surgery. The Cavs have been anxiously awaiting Love\u2019s return. Initially, the club hoped he would be back in the lineup by the end of December. Then his returned was bumped back to mid-January. Now, they\u2019re pleased he\u2019s coming back at all. Cleveland hosts Dallas on Saturday, but Drew said it would be \u201cpushing it\u201d for Love to play then. \u201cWe\u2019re just kind of waiting to see how he is after going through a full practice with contact,\u201d Drew said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see how he is when he comes in tomorrow. If there are no setbacks, we\u2019ll have another practice and see how he does. But I can\u2019t project when he when actually be ready to play a game.\u201d Drew was excited to see Love run and get roughed up by teammates. \u201cWe know he can shoot the ball, but just his movement is what\u2019s been really encouraging,\u201d Drew said. \u201cHow he\u2019s been moving around, how he\u2019s been planting, how he\u2019s been cutting. Because any time you come off any type of injury that deals with a leg, a foot, an ankle, whatever, you\u2019re always looking to see how a guy responds to contact. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to go out and get shots up on your own. But when you actually have people kinda banging with you, knocking you off your course. That can take a toll on you. We\u2019re hoping there are no setbacks; right now it looks like there aren\u2019t any. We\u2019ll see how he is tomorrow.\u201d After facing the Mavericks, the Cavs host Boston on Tuesday. The 30-year-old Love signed a four-year, $120 million contract extension last summer. He had hoped to keep the Cavs in playoff contention as they rebuild in their first season since LeBron James left as a free agent. But the Cavs have been hit hard by injuries \u2013 forward Tristan Thompson is still out with a sprained foot- and are just 11-41. Drew has been encouraged by the team\u2019s recent play. The Cavs have won two straight heading into their matchup with the Mavericks."},{"id":35888,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/hang-time-podcast-los-angeles-lakers-lebron-james-trade-deadline","date":"2019-01-31","title":"Hang Time Podcast: Latest from Los Angeles","content":"John Schuhmann and I discuss the Pacers\u2019 struggles without Victor Oladipo.

After meeting with the team\u2019s management on Thursday, though, it seems the star player and the team could be heading toward a parting of ways. Per ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski and Ramona Shelburne, Porzingis left the impression with team management after Thursday\u2019s meeting that he would prefer to be traded. The Knicks are expected to commence discussions on trading Porzingis before next Thursday\u2019s NBA trade deadline. If a trade does take place, the Brooklyn Nets, LA Clippers, Miami Heat, San Antonio Spurs and Toronto Raptors are expected to be among the teams who would pursue him, Wojnarowski reports. Porzingis talked with Knicks management about the state of the franchise and his future with the team. Porzingis and his brother, Janis, who is also his agent, expressed their frustration with the franchise\u2019s losing ways, past dysfunction on the team and uncertainty over creating a sustainable, successful organization, Wojarowski reports . The former No. 4 overall pick of the 2015 Draft, Porzingis has been sidelined for nearly a year with an ACL injury. He was named an All-Star in 2017-18, but his injury occurred days after that and he never got to play in that game. Porzingis can become a restricted free agent this summer. Per Wojnarowski, he has been searching for clarity on his future role with the team and the franchise\u2019s direction. Since being drafted in 2015, Porzingis has seen his name in trade talks several times. The Knicks have never won more than 32 games in each of Porzingis\u2019 three seasons and he played for three coaches \u2014 Derek Fisher, Kurt Rambis and Jeff Hornacek \u2014 during that span. In December, team president Steve Mills said the team was pleased with Porzingis\u2019 recovery from his ACL, and another round of testing scheduled for mid-February could clarify his timeline for his return. Porzingis was hurt Feb. 6 after landing on a dunk in a game against Milwaukee. The Knicks are last in the Eastern Conference at 10-40, so Porzingis won\u2019t be able to save them this season. But having him on the court could help them in the summer, as potential free agents may want to see if the 7-foot-3 Latvian is fully back before they would consider the Knicks. But Mills said in December that won\u2019t play into the Knicks\u2019 thinking. \u201cThe most important thing for us is to have Kristaps on the court when he feels comfortable being on the court and we feel comfortable that he should be out there,\u201d Mills said. \u201cThat\u2019s more important than any timetable this season, some point in the summer. The most important thing is that we know that we\u2019ve got this guy in a place that he feels comfortable on the floor and we feel comfortable in his ability to be part of what we\u2019re doing long term. That\u2019s more important than anything else that we can lay out.\u201d Mills also declined to discuss how Porzingis\u2019 recovery would factor into whether the team offers him a contract extension in the summer. He believes then that Porzingis \u2013 who grew so fed up with the franchise in its final days under Phil Jackson that he skipped his exit meeting before returning to Europe for the summer \u2013 was pleased with the team. Mills said Porzingis is almost always at the practice facility and sits with teammates during film sessions.

Days later, the Pelicans appear to be holding firm to that approach. The Los Angles Lakers are the team that may have the most interest in the NBA in acquiring Davis. To actually do so, however, may require a longer road than perhaps they expected. Per ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski and Zach Lowe, Pelicans GM Dell Demps had not returned a call from Lakers GM Rob Pelinka. That changed on Thursday, though, as executives from both teams connected on the phone, per Wojnarowski. They are expected to talk again before the Feb. 3 trade deadline. The Lakers are thought to be the top suitor for the superstar big man Davis, but the Pelicans are taking their time in any kind of deal \u2014 especially one that might involve the Lakers. L.A. already has a star on its roster in LeBron James, who also happens to be represented by the same agent as Davis \u2014 Rich Paul. Wojnarowski and Lowe report that the Pelicans are seemingly content to wait out their next move with Davis \u2014 even as the trade deadline looms. Here\u2019s more from ESPN\u2019s story: Brad Turner of the Los Angeles Times reports that Lakers team president Magic Johnson and Demps talked on the phone Tuesday about how to proceed in Davis trade talks. Johnson presented Demps with five different trade scenarios for Davis on Wednesday, Turner reports, and are waiting to hear back from Demps about which ones interest him the most. One of those scenarios would include Lonzo Ball, Kyle Kuzma, Brandon Ingram, Ivica Zubac and a No. 1 pick. The Lakers want to get a deal done and have no plans on trying to outbid the Boston Celtics this summer. The Lakers, at that point, will then pursue other free agents besides Davis, Turner reports. Just about every other non-Lakers team in the NBA is expected to (or already has) inquired about landing Davis. The Celtics are thought of by many NBA insiders as the team that could contend with the Lakers in trading for Davis. However, Wojnarowski and Lowe report Paul and Davis\u2019 camp have warned other teams that trading for Davis may be nothing more than a short-term rental. Davis can become a free agent in the summer of 2020 and, per ESPN, teams are learning that his plan is to treat any trade destination as a one-year stop \u2014 unless that team is the Lakers. On Monday, the Pelicans issued a statement that acknowledged Davis\u2019 trade request, but also made it clear they will deal him when it suits the team best. \u201cThis past weekend, Anthony Davis\u2019 representatives informed us that Anthony does not wish to sign a contract extension with our team and subsequently has requested a trade,\u201d the Pelicans\u2019 statement said . \u201cAlthough we are disappointed in this decision, our organization\u2019s top priority is to bring an NBA championship to our city and fans and build our team for long-term success. Relative to specific talks of a trade, we will do this on our terms and our timeline. One that makes the most sense for our team and it will not be dictated by those outside of our organization. We have also requested the League to strictly enforce the tampering rules associated with this transaction.\u201d On Tuesday, the NBA fined the Pelicans star $50,000 because of his agent\u2019s comments that Davis won\u2019t sign an extension and wants to be traded. The Celtics cannot trade for Davis under NBA rules until July 1, unless they also trade away Kyrie Irving \u2014 which likely won\u2019t happen. Irving is a factor because of what\u2019s known as the \u201cRose Rule,\u201d the one that says NBA teams cannot trade for more than one player who has signed an extension. Per ESPN, Boston is hopeful that it can swing a trade for Davis when the time comes without sacrificing Jayson Tatum in any future deal. The New York Knicks also have interest in trading for Davis, ESPN reports, but their chances at landing him may hinge on what kind pick they land in the 2019 draft. Overall, Davis does plan to play for the Pelicans again before the trade deadline and wants to play in the 2019 NBA All-Star Game (provided he is selected as a reserve), ESPN reports. Before last night\u2019s 105-99 home loss to the Denver Nuggets, the Pelicans edited their usual pregame video shown on the large center scoreboard just before tip-off. Davis, their five-time All-Star who publicly requested a trade through his agent Monday, was conspicuously absent from the video. He was present at the game, however, sitting on the end of the bench in street clothes. Davis could sign a 5-year, $240 million super max extension this summer and can become a free agent in the summer of 2020. He is averaging 29.3 points, 13.3 rebounds, 4.4 assists, 1.7 steals and 2.6 blocks per game this season . Last season, Davis was instrumental in the Pelicans\u2019 playoff run, powering them into the postseason as the No. 6 seed. Once there, they swept the No. 3-seeded Portland Trail Blazers in the first round before losing in five games in the West semifinals to the Golden State Warriors. He\u2019s an elite superstar on a team that hasn\u2019t gotten past the West semifinals since he\u2019s been in New Orleans \u2014 and in four of his first six full seasons, the Pelicans didn\u2019t qualify for the playoffs at all. A five-time All-Star, Davis was an All-NBA first team member in three of the last four seasons. He has made three All-Defensive teams in his career and is the Pelicans\u2019 all-time leader in points, rebounds, blocks, field goals attempted and made and free throws attempted and made.

Split-seconds were circling the drain as Towns tightroped the baseline, turned and jumped. All too aware of what a tough shooting night he\u2019d had through regulation and most of the overtime \u2013 6-for-16 overall, 0-for-6 on 3-pointers \u2013 Towns didn\u2019t want to beat down his percentage any worse. He held onto the ball, landing as the horn blew, and let the hoops gods decide the Timberwolves\u2019 and Grizzlies\u2019 fates in a second overtime. Minnesota lost.  * * * The end of the Wolves-Grizzlies game Wednesday at Target Center didn\u2019t play out that way, but it could have. In the real world of non-italic type, Towns drained a baseline jumper that counted, boosting his team to a cool 99-97 OT victory on a subzero night in Minneapolis. Yet based on trends in the NBA that seems to have grown over the past several seasons, Towns\u2019 thought process and actions in the final two seconds could have flipped his buzzer-beater into a buzzer-clutcher. He even could have gone a little thespian, making an instant calculation that ensured the ball would not leave his fingertips until a hair too late, while feigning that \u201cDarn it!\u201d he really had tried. Just a few nights earlier, remember, the Golden State Warriors\u2019 Kevin Durant had the ball and ample time before halftime to try a midcourt shot at Boston. Durant \u2014 arguably the most skilled practitioner in the league, as far as hanging onto such shots \u201cjust a bit too long\u201d \u2014 exposed the selfish maneuver for what it is when his casual fling swished through. But hey, the Warriors were up 61-59 and won 115-111 , so the three points weren\u2019t important after all, right? https:\/\/twitter.com\/DrewShiller\/status\/1089343954728804352\/video\/1 Maybe try taking a poll of coaches on that and see what they\u2019d say. Three points here, three points there, you start to add \u2018em up and soon you\u2019re talking real outcomes. No one on the bench and by this point few in the stands are fooled that the aw-shucks late heaves are legit. Most of the time, they are intentionally tardy and no longer cute ways to preserve the player\u2019s shooting percentage. Durant admitted to it years ago to ESPN\u2019s Royce Young. \u201cIt depends on what I\u2019m shooting from the field,\u201d Durant said in 2013 . \u201cFirst quarter, if I\u2019m 4-for-4, I let it go. Third quarter, if I\u2019m like 10-for-16 or 10-for-17, I might let it go. But if I\u2019m like 8-for-19, I\u2019m going to go ahead and dribble one more second and let that buzzer go off and then throw it up there.\u201d Durant, by the numbers, has gotten quite good at this dubious art. Since he joined Golden State, he has gone 0-for-3 on shots from halfcourt or farther, with fewer than 10 seconds left in the first, second or third quarters. He took and missed just one in 2016-17 , did it twice last season and so far hasn\u2019t risked one in 2018-19 . During the same time frame, teammate Stephen Curry is 1-for-25 (4.0 percent). Curry\u2019s 3-point rate has felt the effect, settling at 42.5 percent vs. 43 percent without the flings. Some might say, meh, no big deal. A decision like that, with so much game to play, doesn\u2019t determine who wins or loses. No one\u2019s slowing down, the equivalent of a referee allegedly \u201cswallowing his whistle,\u201d at the end. And as much as players hate having to rush up shots to beat the 24-second clock, you don\u2019t see the same sticky-fingered indulgence then. Compare the move and Durant\u2019s casual explanation for it to the disrespect and anger NBA players feel when an opponent does nearly the mirror image, that is, puts up a shot he probably shouldn\u2019t. Launch a needless field-goal attempt in the dwindling seconds of a game clearly decided and risk the other guys\u2019 wrath. The Celtics\u2019 Kyrie Irving was fined $25,000 when he took umbrage at a last-second 3-point hoist by the Denver Nuggets\u2019 Jamaal Murray, who was trying to reach 50 points in a game the Nuggets won 115-107. The Celtics point guard fired the ball into the stands afterward, rather than meekly hand over a souvenir, over the breach of perceived NBA protocol. Consider Irving\u2019s explanation afterward: \u201cYou just don\u2019t. There\u2019s a tradition and a respect within the league, as well as in any basketball game.\u201d And: \u201cI mean, when everyone knows the intent of it, I think it just makes it clear of what\u2019s going on.\u201d And: \u201cIt\u2019s a tradition in the league, but it\u2019s just immature.\u201d Any coach or teammate of a guy who purposely let the clock beat him at the end of a quarter or half could say the exact same things. What\u2019s to be done about it? There really are only two possibilities. Players have to stop doing it, period. Or the league has to stop counting such heaves, as a way to incentivize them back into significance. The former isn\u2019t happening, although the trend has changed course a bit so far this season; so far, we\u2019ve had 22 players attempt at least three \u201cdesperation\u201d attempts for a total of 81 such shots. Overall 140 players have hoisted them, slightly more than halfway through the schedule. In all of 2017-18, 206 players legitimately tried, including 18 who had three or more. Then again, Dallas Mavericks rookie Luka Doncic is 0-for-9 so far. He might not yet be wise to the ways of this league, in preserving his personal percentages. The latter option reportedly has been brought up in Competition Committee meetings and really is overdue. Just stop counting the heaves and flings and Hail-Mary bombs against the guys willing to try them. If a player tries to nail an improbable 3-pointer for his team, at the peril of his own stats, don\u2019t penalize him. In other words, do not count the shots in an individual\u2019s 3-point or overall shooting numbers. If he makes it, fine, that\u2019s a 1-for-1 on his ledger. But if he misses, it\u2019s simply 0-for-0. The league already has categories for team rebounds and team turnovers that don\u2019t count against an individual. To generate a bit more of what makes the game exciting, to have folks in the stands thrill rather than smirk when such a shot goes up, it\u2019s time to list \u201cteam heaves\u201d in the box scores. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

They\u2019ve taken steps backward on both ends of the floor, having scored 0.5 fewer points per 100 possessions and allowed 2.4 more. But the Raptors remain a top-10 team in both offensive and defensive efficiency. And they may have a higher ceiling than they ever have, with a Kia MVP candidate (depending on how voters take missed games into account) and a seemingly deep supporting cast that includes a couple of players that have taken big steps forward this season. One reason why we probably haven\u2019t seen the best of the Raptors yet is that their two best players \u2014 Kawhi Leonard and Kyle Lowry \u2014 have played just 27 games together . Leonard, with a couple of minor injuries and a \u201cload management\u201d program that has kept him from playing both games of back-to-backs, has missed 14 games. Lowry, with leg and back issues, has missed 11. The 825 total minutes that the pair have played ranks 10th on the Raptors and 153rd among two-man combinations league-wide . Still, the Raptors have the league\u2019s third best record (37-15) and can regain possession of first place in the Eastern Conference with a win against the Milwaukee Bucks on Thursday (8 p.m. ET, TNT). Here\u2019s one number to know about the 2018-19 Raptors as they play one of their biggest games of the regular season\u2026 The Raptors have been 19.1 points per 100 possessions better with Danny Green on the floor than they\u2019ve been with Green off the floor. That is the second-biggest on-off NetRtg differential among 238 players that have played at least 750 minutes through Wednesday. The differential is more about how good the Raptors have been with Green on the floor (outscoring their opponents by 12.7 points per 100 possessions) than how bad they\u2019ve been with him off the floor (getting outscored by 6.4 per 100). The on-court number is the third-highest among those 238 players. Green was much more than a throw-in in the trade that brought Leonard to Toronto . He\u2019s been a critical part of the Raptors\u2019 success, second on the team in minutes played and 12th in the league in 3-pointers . The Raptors got a better Green than the one that played for the Spurs last season. He has an effective field goal percentage of 58.8 percent, a career-high mark and up from 49 percent last season . That\u2019s the second-biggest jump (smaller than only that of the Spurs\u2019 Davis Bertans) among 182 players with at least 250 field goal attempts both seasons. Green\u2019s bigger on-off differential has been on offense, where the Raptors have been 14.9 points per 100 possessions better with him on the floor (scoring 116.6) than with him off the floor (scoring just 101.7). That\u2019s the biggest on-off differential on offense among the 238 players that have played at least 750 minutes this season. The differential on defense is smaller (4.2 points per 100 possessions), but not insignificant when you consider that Green is mostly on the floor against the opponents\u2019 starters and the players replacing him are mostly on the floor against reserves. And really, Green\u2019s off-court differential is an indication that the Raptors\u2019 bench hasn\u2019t been nearly as good as it was the last few years. Last season, the Raptors had the league\u2019s best *aggregate bench NetRtg (plus-8.3), and it was the sixth straight season that they ranked in the top six. This season, they rank 22nd (minus-4.0) and no team has seen a bigger drop-off. * Aggregate bench NetRtg = Point differential per 100 possessions with reserves on the floor. This number is based on an estimate for possessions, rather than true possessions from play-by-play data.  Continuity has been an issue with the bench. Last season, the Raptors had a bench unit \u2014 Fred VanVleet, Delon Wright, C.J. Miles, Pascal Siakam and Jakob Poeltl \u2014 that played 340 minutes together and outscored its opponents by 19.2 points per 100 possessions, the sixth best mark among 48 lineups that played at least 200 minutes . This season, the Raptors\u2019 most-used lineup that doesn\u2019t include at least four starters \u2014 VanVleet, Wright, Miles, OG Anunoby and Jonas Valanciunas \u2014 has played just 48 minutes together . Each of those guys has missed at least six games, with Valanciunas having missed the last 22 with a thumb injury. Miles, the bench\u2019s designated shooter, has shot just 30 percent from 3-point range, and the Raptors have been outscored by 10.4 points per 100 possessions with him on the floor . Norman Powell, a guy who can\/has\/will take Miles\u2019 minutes, missed more than five weeks with a shoulder injury. VanVleet is a plus-126 for the season, but that\u2019s mostly about his minutes with the starters. In fact the five players that VanVleet has played the most minutes with are the five regular starters , and the Raptors have outscored their opponents by at least 4.5 points per 100 possessions with any of those five combinations (VanVleet plus a starter) on the floor. They\u2019ve been outscored by at least 2.2 points per 100 possessions with any combination of VanVleet and another reserve on the floor. So it\u2019s been a very different starters\/bench dynamic for the Raptors this season. For most of the last few years, they were at their best with reserves on the floor. This year, their starters have carried them, despite the lack of continuity with that group. Their most-used starting lineup has played in just 24 of their 52 games. The Raptors have outscored their opponents by 319 points in 1,135 minutes with at least four of the five regular starters on the floor and have been outscored by 38 points in 1,386 minutes with three or fewer on the floor. As long as they\u2019ve had four of the five on the floor, they\u2019ve been terrific. Well, unless the guy not on the floor is Green. In 73 minutes with the other four starters on the floor without Green, the Raptors have been outscored by 28 points . According to the numbers, he\u2019s the glue guy.

The game, which used to pit Rookies vs. Sophomores (my personal favorite iteration), has evolved through the years and now pits first and second-year players against each other in a battle of U.S. stars versus international standouts. This week, the rosters were revealed for the Mtn Dew Ice Rising Stars , and it should be a fun one.  Three rookies will suit up for the U.S. Team \u2014 the Sacramento Kings\u2019 Marvin Bagley III, the Memphis Grizzlies\u2019 Jaren Jackson Jr. and the Atlanta Hawks\u2019 Trae Young. Team World will feature five rookies: the Phoenix Suns\u2019 Deandre Ayton (Bahamas), the Dallas Mavericks\u2019 Luka Doncic (Slovenia), the LA Clippers\u2019 Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (Canada), the Brooklyn Nets\u2019 Rodions Kurucs (Latvia) and the Minnesota Timberwolves\u2019 Josh Okogie (Nigeria). The U.S. Team will be led by honorary coach Kyrie Irving, while Dirk Nowitzki will lead Team World. When Doncic was asked about playing for his German teammate, the Mavs rookie joked that he\u2019d be seeking a team change. \u201cI told him he\u2019s got to play hard or I\u2019m going to sub him out,\u201d Nowitzki said. \u201cI\u2019m going to be tough on him. I\u2019m going to teach him a lesson.\u201d Here are the full rosters and details . Tip off will be Friday, Feb. 15 at 9 p.m. ET ( TNT ). * * * Last week:  No. 1 Another week, another incredible noteworthy performance for Doncic. This time, Doncic got his second triple-double in 10 days by putting up a career-high 35 points with 12 rebounds and 10 assists in Dallas\u2019 loss to Toronto . In scoring 35, he became the first teenager in NBA history to tally a 30-point triple-double and the fourth rookie to get a 35-point triple-double. The others? Stephen Curry (Feb. 10, 2010), Jason Kidd (April 11, 1995) and Michael Jordan (Jan. 14, 1985). 2. Trae Young, Atlanta Hawks  Last week:  No. 5 Young makes a jump this week thanks to Ayton\u2019s injury and a week of solid performances. In three games, Young averaged 26.3 points and 7.7 assist s while shooting 63.6 percent from the floor (40.9 on 3s) . Young had a 30-point, eight-assist outing in a loss at Portland, then followed that with an impressive 26 points and seven assists to help the Hawks beat the Clippers in L.A. for the first time since 2016. \u201dHe\u2019s really been composed over the last couple games,\u201d teammate John Collins said after the win in L.A . \u201dHe\u2019s made an effort to really make the right play.\u201d 3. Marvin Bagley III, Sacramento Kings  Last week:  No. 3 Bagley had another solid week, capped off by a 17-point, 12-rebound showing to help the Kings blow away the Hawks on Wednesday. Bagley can score in so many ways \u2014 mid-range jumpers facing up his defender, low-post spins to the baseline and even has the handles to get to the rim on the break. In his three games this week, Bageley averaged 15 points, 8.7 rebounds and 1.3 blocks to help him maintain his third rung. If Young hadn\u2019t had such an outstanding week, he might\u2019ve climbed up to second. 4 . Deandre Ayton, Phoenix Suns  Last week:  No. 2 Ayton held his No. 2 spot last week, but he gets bumped down this week after missing his sixth straight game with a left ankle injury. He\u2019s getting closer to return, though (Phoenix doesn\u2019t play until Saturday), so once he returns he should climb right back up the Ladder. 5. Jaren Jackson Jr., Memphis Grizzlies  Last week:  Not ranked In four games this week, Jackson averaged 12 points, 5.3 rebounds and 1.3 blocks as the Grizzlies continued to struggle. His best game came in the Grizzlies\u2019 lone win, in which he put up 20 points with six rebounds in a 106-103 victory agianst the Pacers . Just missed the cut:  Mikal Bridges, Phoenix Suns Bridges has made a name for himself with his work on the defensive end, but this week he had a pair of double-digit scoring games, putting up 16 with six rebounds in a loss to the Lakers. Bridges followed that up with 17 points, six rebounds and four steals as the Suns nearly pulled off the upset in San Antonio . His scoring uptick could be attributed to him finding his outside touch, as he\u2019s gone 6-for-11 in those two games. Bridges also hasn\u2019t had less than five rebounds in the last four games, filling a need as Deandre Ayton\u2019s been sidelined with an ankle sprain. Allonzo Trier, New York Knicks Trier falls out of the Top 5 this week after coming down to earth a bit. In four games, the Knicks\u2019 rookie averaged 10.5 points in 21 minutes per game, but had an uncharacteristic 0-for-7 shooting night in New York\u2019s loss in Charlotte . Frank Jackson, New Orleans Pelicans The Pelicans are banged up and seeking answers amid the Anthony Davis drama , and Jackson is making the most of his opportunity. Jackson, who has started the last two games, has averaged 11.5 points and 4.3 rebounds in 24.2 minutes per game over his last four games. Kenrich Williams, New Orleans Pelicans It\u2019s a small sample size, but the undrafted rookie out of TCU has been huge over the last two games. In New Orleans\u2019 win in Houston , Williams had eight points and grabbed 16 rebounds in 30 minutes, then followed that with 21 points, eight rebounds and two blocks in Wednesday\u2019s loss to the Nuggets. In the NBA, it\u2019s all about making the most of opportunities and Williams is taking advantage of the team\u2019s injury woes and proving he can contribute in the league.  Kevin Knox, New York Knicks Knox had a strong finish to his week to return to the bottom five this week. Knox put up 19 points in a loss the Hornets , hitting 3 of 4 3-pointers, then led New York with 17 points in Wednesday\u2019s loss to the Mavs, while also grabbing five rebounds. Knox has certainly seen his production dip, but he\u2019s been more assertive of late, which is a good sign. * * * ( All stats through Wednesday, Jan. 30 ) Send any qfuestions or comments to my email or find me on Twitter @drewpackham .

Off an errant shot from Andrew Wiggins at the top of the key with about three seconds left in overtime, Towns managed to snag a long rebound over Marc Gasol, who was boxing him out. He jumped while turning and let fly a 14-foot desperation try, nailing the baseline jumper as he fell away and overtime expired. \u201cI knew it was in,\u201d said Towns, enjoying his first ever game-winning, buzzer-beater. \u201cIt felt good.\u201d Towns finished with 16 points, well below his 22.8 point average, but he came up big when it counted. In foul trouble early, he spent a lot of time on the bench during the first three quarters. As always, we rate game-winning buzzer-beaters on our Horry Scale. Reminder: The Horry Scale breaks down a game-winning buzzer-beater (GWBB) in the categories of difficulty, game situation (was the team tied or behind at the time?), importance (playoff game or garden-variety night in January?) and celebration. Then we give it an overall grade on a scale of 1-5 Robert Horrys, named for the patron saint of last-second answered prayers. *** DIFFICULTY: For a two-pointer, Towns\u2019 effort was near the top in degree of difficulty. He had to secure the rebound over defenders, keep possession and turn for the shot immediately from a tough toward-the-baseline angle, knowing that only a second or so remained. There was no way to use the glass on this shot. Towns\u2019 14-footer barely glanced the rim as it swished through. Moving backward, he ended up out of bounds. GAME SITUATION: As the announcer put it: \u201cA KAT-a-strophic finish for the Grizzlies.\u201d Down to the buzzer in overtime, Memphis needed the game desperately, having gone 1-9 over the past 10 games and above only Phoenix at the bottom of the Western Conference. So Towns\u2019 shot in overtime to give the Timberwolves the hard-fought win was a dagger for the struggling Grizzlies. CELEBRATION: Towns had a smile on his face even before it was confirmed that the shot left his hand a tenth of a second before the buzzer. Arms upraised, he moved toward the center court where Wiggins and Jerryd Bayless embraced him and the bench joined the celebration. GRADE: This was an exceptional shot, performed under pressure and in competition with Gasol, a good defender and rebounder. It was a routine game, though this gives the Timberwolves a slight boost in the playoff hunt.  Three and a half Horrys. The Utah Jazz came into Wednesday\u2019s game with the Portland Trail Blazers on a roll. They had won nine of their last 10 and were the second-hottest team in the league behind the Golden State Warriors, who have won 11 straight. The Blazers\u2019 backcourt of Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum changed that fast. Call them the coolers. The duo combined for 66 points in the Blazers\u2019 132-105 win over the Jazz, scoring 45 points in the first half to put Utah well in the rear-view mirror. In a one-two punch, McCollum poured in 20 points in the first quarter and Lillard posted 15 in the second. It was the third time this season that Lillard and McCollum have each scored 30 or more. The Blazers never let up and finished with 132 points against one of the stingiest teams in the NBA. Two young Celtics displayed outstanding dunking prowess in the Celtics\u2019 126-94 win over the Hornets. Boston, by the way, has won seven of its last 10 games. In the third quarter, Jayson Tatum finished an outstanding alley-oop pass from Terry Rozier, slamming it down with one hand after attacking the basket from the left wing. In the second quarter, Jaylen Brown did a little Dominique Wilkins-like rock the cradle on a breakaway dunk. He\u2019s still an official member of the team, but are the New Orleans Pelicans moving on without Anthony Davis? Head coach Alvin Gentry couldn\u2019t give a definitive answer when asked before the Nuggets topped the Pelicans 105-99 whether the franchise player would ever play another game for New Orleans. Davis missed a sixth straight game with a sprained index finger, and set the NBA abuzz early this week with his desire to be traded. \"It's not awkward at all.\" Hear from Pelicans head coach Alvin Gentry on Anthony Davis #10BeforeTip  pic.twitter.com\/tCtXFVp2Jw \u2014 NBA TV (@NBATV) January 30, 2019 Other evidence that the Pelicans consider Davis gone is the fact that the team removed him from the introductory video played before home games. He\u2019s still listed on the team Web site\u2019s roster , but every other player on the active roster is part of the video. The Pels already took AD out of their intro vid. Petty \ud83d\ude02 pic.twitter.com\/sndEOIKHsD \u2014 Bleacher Report (@BleacherReport) January 31, 2019 And after the Pelicans beat the Rockets the other night, Gentry appeared to ignore Davis as he walked past toward the locker room. This is more fuel for the speculation fire. https:\/\/twitter.com\/TheRenderNBA\/status\/1090470050828615681 The awkwardness is not likely to end soon. The Pelicans reportedly are in no rush to move Davis before the Feb. 7 trade deadline. How much does Knicks\u2019 big man Enes Kanter like his job? Well, he kissed the Knicks\u2019 logo on the Madison Square Garden floor when he finally got into the game vs. the Mavericks in the third quarter. Kanter had been a \u201cDNP\u201d for four straight games. But his first action of the night didn\u2019t turn out that well. Maybe there\u2019s a reason for not getting too much playing time. Enes Kanter finally gets into game for the Knicks. Kisses the floor, immediately airballs. pic.twitter.com\/wpvb3Y9dWj \u2014 Rob Perez (@WorldWideWob) January 31, 2019 The crowd had been chanting \u201cwe want Kanter,\u201d which he acknowledged with a wave before entering the game. Dirk Nowitzki may have made his last appearance at Madison Square Garden, scoring a season-high 14 points in the Mavericks\u2019 114-90 win over the Knicks. He got a standing ovation from the appreciative crowd when he entered the game during the first quarter."},{"id":35916,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/lakers-lebron-james-could-return-thursday","date":"2019-01-30","title":"James ramps up work at practice, listed as out for Thursday","content":" * Thursday on NBA League Pass:  Lakers vs. Clippers (10:30 ET) LeBron James continues to make progress in his groin injury rehabilitation work. While the Los Angeles Lakers aren\u2019t quite ready to declare James ready to play yet, his status is trending toward a return to the court. However, despite increased participation from James at practice, coach Luke Walton and the Lakers are preparing to play without James against the LA Clippers on Thursday ( 10:30 ET, NBA League Pass ) and he\u2019s officially listed as out. After Monday\u2019s practice, Walton said the team would take a \u201cday-to-day\u201d approach with James\u2019 availability. Walton said that James is moving well, getting into the paint and shooting jumpers, if not driving aggressively to the rim and looking for tomahawk jams. When the media was let in after Monday\u2019s practice was over, James was seen nailing 3-pointers around the line and then from 5 to 10 feet beyond it, writes Mike Trudell of Lakers.com . \u201cHe did more \u2026 we did some more up and down contact today, so the day before was half court contact, today we got up and down a little bit, did some short scrimmages,\u201d Walton said. \u201cHe did that, and we just got a bunch of shots up.\u201d James took part in some short, three-minute scrimmages on Monday. Those sessions were full-go and were the closest James had gotten to replicating game action, Walton said. James put a post on Instagram yesterday that made it appear as if he\u2019s getting closer to his return, writing: \u201cAlmost that time again! I\u2019ve missed you so damn much! #BeenACagedAngryLion . #striveforgreatness  #jamesgang \u201d James took part in full-contact defensive drills in practice late last week, marking the first time he\u2019s done that since the four-time Kia MVP winner strained his groin. The 34-year-old James has been out since Christmas due to the most significant injury of his 16-year NBA career. He had never missed more than 13 games in an entire season, but missed his 16th consecutive game on Sunday. James practiced with his teammates Saturday at their training complex, but won\u2019t return this weekend. The Lakers\u2019 next game after that is Tuesday at home against Philadelphia. James was selected this week to be a starter and a team captain in the NBA All-Star Game in Charlotte on Feb. 17.

LaMarcus Aldridge , Rudy Gobert , Tobias Harris , Damian Lillard and Russell Westbrook would flesh out my stellar bench. I like Gobert over Utah teammate Donovan Mitchell because I want to see defense (Gobert\u2019s shot-blocking) in the All-Star Game. Unfortunately, Dallas loses out at both ends of the NBA legend life cycle, with no spot to honor Dirk Nowitzki and a directive for Luka Doncic to showcase himself in the Rising Stars Game. East: Trying to think like a conference coach here, I\u2019ll go with Bradley Beal , Blake Griffin , Kyle Lowry , Khris Middleton , D\u2019Angelo Russell , Nikola Vucevic and Ben Simmons . I still contend that Dwyane Wade, the people\u2019s choice in fan balloting, should get a spot because this is an exhibition for the fans. We can get all serious and honorary with the All-NBA teams at season\u2019s end. But coaches aren\u2019t prone to sentiment on this sort of thing. Shaun Powell :  West:  Make it Anthony Davis , Karl-Anthony Towns and Nikola Jokic as the frontcourt, Russell Westbrook and Damian Lillard as the guards, and the wild cards are Rudy Gobert and Luka Doncic . East:  Give me Blake Griffin , Nikola Vucevic and Khris Middleton in the front court, Ben Simmons and Victor Oladipo the guards, and the wild cards are D\u2019Angelo Russell and Bradley Beal . Oladipo\u2019s replacement is Jimmy Butler . John Schuhmann :  West:  Anthony Davis , Damian Lillard and Nikola Jokic are easy picks. After that, Rudy Gobert and Karl-Anthony Towns are most deserving. And finally, LaMarcus Aldridge and Russell Westbrook edge out Tobias Harris, Donovan Mitchell and Klay Thompson for the last two spots. East: The first five are pretty easy: Bradley Beal , Blake Griffin , Victor Oladipo , Ben Simmons and Nikola Vucevic . D\u2019Angelo Russell has earned a spot with the way he\u2019s played over the last two months and the Oladipo injury (and the need for a replacement) keeps us from having to choose between a second Buck and a second Raptor.

I consult a book of aphorisms, reminding myself to \u201cmeasure twice and cut once\u201d and that \u201cgood things come to those who wait.\u201d Then, I breathe deeply and relax between now and the Feb. 7 trade deadline. There\u2019s no reason to rush into any Anthony Davis trade. Look, if someone blows off my socks with a package, by all means, the All-NBA big man will be leaving a forwarding address. But I want as many suitors and as much known info as possible, which argues against a deadline deal. I want to know which teams have which lottery picks to dangle and I want the Boston Celtics to have bellied up to the bar (free from the Kyrie Irving contract\/CBA restriction). Whatever anyone, a.k.a., the Los Angeles Lakers, will offer in the next week, they\u2019ll bring again in June \u2014 they don\u2019t want to wait to sign him as a free agent in 2020, which would mean getting their first playoff run with Davis and LeBron James when James is 36. And that\u2019s why, ultimately, I\u2019ll do my darnedest to send Davis to anyone but the Lakers, whether now or later. No need to facilitate James\u2019 and Magic Johnson\u2019s dreams given their massive competitive advantages in L.A. and relative disregard for markets such as our Pelicans\u2019. The league and the agents who try to dominate it need a reminder, too, that four-year contracts aren\u2019t supposed to fizzle after two-and-a-half years. Honor your business. Shaun Powell :  First, I\u2019m going to sit tight and listen and not make a rash decision even if the trade deadline is creeping closer. While I\u2019m not willing to make LeBron James and the Lakers happy, I\u2019m also not going to let personal feelings get in the way of making a sound business decision. The goal is to maximize the trade value of Davis no matter the team and if that\u2019s the Lakers, so be it. Unless I felt the Celtics could truly offer something better this summer, I\u2019m sending Davis to LA for young players and picks. John Schuhmann :  Step 1:  Anthony Davis is not playing another game for the New Orleans Pelicans. He doesn\u2019t want to be here and when it comes to the future of this franchise, our own 2019 Draft pick could be just as important as any pick we acquire. So he can go work out with Carmelo Anthony, Chandler Parsons and J.R. Smith while they all wait for trades that may or may not come. Step 2: I\u2019m aggressively shopping Nikola Mirotic (who has an expiring contract), Julius Randle (who has a player option this summer), and my other players on smaller expiring deals , getting whatever I can for them between now and the trade deadline. I\u2019ll take calls about Jrue Holiday, but there isn\u2019t much urgency with him. He has at least two more years on his contract, other teams will have more payroll flexibility in the summer, and while I\u2019m ready to call this season over, I\u2019m not eliminating the possibility that we can compete for the playoffs next season (or the season after) with whatever pieces we get back in trades. Step 3: I\u2019m taking calls about Davis, but I\u2019m probably waiting until the summer to trade him for a couple of reasons. Primarily, that\u2019s when the Celtics can trade Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown and the picks that they have. Also, it won\u2019t be until after the Lottery that I know where every team is picking in the Draft.  Sekou Smith :  The plan is to stretch this process out all the way until July. We\u2019ll suck it up and take whatever public relations hits come from the fans and the basketball public. But I\u2019ll be damned if we\u2019re going to rush into anything where Anthony Davis is concerned. It\u2019s bad enough we have a transcendent talent, one of the top five players in the game, requesting a trade. We all know this tends to end horribly for he team stuck on this side of this scenario. My job is to do what\u2019s best for the present and future of the New Orleans Pelicans. And that means taking my sweet time and being patient. I\u2019ll wait for Boston and see what they are willing to deliver in a trade (I want it all, young stars and picks) for AD. But the trade deadline is just anther day to me right now. I feel no pressure to do anything hasty where AD is concerned."},{"id":36006,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-who-should-be-west-reserves-2019","date":"2019-01-30","title":"Blogtable: Who should be the Western Conference's All-Star reserves?","content":"* * * Name seven players in the West who should be chosen as All-Star reserves .

Both are league highs and seem unsustainable with any ambition to play into June. There\u2019s no easy way to lighten Harden\u2019s load on the court, but D\u2019Antoni has to try and part of Paul\u2019s leadership is to see that it happens. Of course, the veteran point guard needs to cloak himself in bubble wrap as well, so that he\u2019s intact for whatever winds up as Houston\u2019s final game. John Schuhmann :  Obviously, Harden\u2019s load is a little lighter. Harden has averaged 35.9 minutes in the 25 games both he and Paul have played and 39.2 minutes in the 22 games Paul has missed. Harden\u2019s usage rate has been much lower with Paul on the floor (32.3 percent) than it\u2019s been with Paul off the floor (41.6 percent) , and his field goals have been assisted more than twice as often . With Harden, Paul and Eric Gordon healthy, you can have at least two of those guys on the floor at all times and none of the three is ever responsible for making every play. How much Paul helps on defense is as important as the offense. The Rockets rank 27th defensively overall , having allowed 112 points per 100 possessions in their 50 games. But they\u2019ve allowed 109.7 per 100 (a rate which would rank 18th) in the 28 games Paul has played and just 105 per 100 (a rate which would rank sixth) with Paul on the floor. Better defense takes some of the pressure off Harden on the other end of the floor.  Shaun Powell :  Harden should power down to a comfortable stage where he can still be productive and yet not place as much strain and wear on his body. Let Paul handle much of the ball handling duties because, you know, that\u2019s what CP does best. Concentrate on being a catch-and-shooter. Sekou Smith :  He gets some rest, particularly on the offensive end and in terms of facilitating for anyone else (which Harden wasn\u2019t doing a ton of recently, anyway). But Chris Paul\u2019s return allows Harden to ease off the gas just a little bit. There\u2019s no need for his usage rate to remain sky-high with Paul back in the mix. And the truth is, the Rockets need to be mindful of making sure Harden preserves a little something for the stretch run of the season and the playoffs. As magical as his January run has been (and it might have clinched him a second straight Kia MVP in the eyes of many voters), it cannot be the high-point of his season. The Rockets need him to go nuclear in the postseason far more than they need him to keep up his torrid scoring streak."},{"id":36024,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/about-last-night-1-29-19","date":"2019-01-30","title":"About Last Night: Okafor comes up big","content":" Who needs Anthony Davis when you have \u2026 Jahlil Okafor? OK, the Pelicans aren\u2019t in any hurry to move on from Anthony Davis, who missed his fifth straight game with a sprained left index finger and more importantly made headlines this week by expressing his desire for a trade. But Okafor\u2019s play of late has been a revelation, and Tuesday was his biggest game yet. Okafor put up a season-high 27 points and grabbed 12 rebounds as New Orleans beat the Rockets 121-116 in Houston to snap a three-game skid. Okafor was a beast inside, hitting 11 of 15 shots in 36 minutes of action to help the Pelicans weather 37 points from James Harden (his 24th straight of 30-plus points). Okafor, who has struggled to live up to expectations since being drafted third overall by the 76ers in the 2015 draft , picked up the slack Tuesday night and doesn\u2019t show signs of slowing. \u201cEverybody wants to go out there and show just how good they are,\u201d Okafor said afterward. \u201cWhen we play hard and play together, we give ourselves a chance to beat anybody.\u201d While Okafor has been an afterthought most of the season \u2013 averaging just 12 minutes on the season \u2013 this latest stretch could help revitalize his career and boost his confidence. Over the last five games, Okafor has averaged 21.2 points, 11 rebounds and 2.6 blocks while shooting 74.6 percent from the field. He has double-doubles in four of those five. When asked about Okafor\u2019s emergence, Jrue Holiday said he was happy for him and wasn\u2019t surprised. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason why he was the No. 3 pick,\u201d Holiday said. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason why he won a championship his freshman year in college [at Duke]. Given the opportunity and confidence, he\u2019s a load down there too [in the low post].\u201d The Thunder got a little bit out of everyone Tuesday night as they pulled out a 126-117 win in Orlando to extend their winning streak to six. Paul George started the game on fire, scoring 31 in a dominant first-half performance. He\u2019d finish with 37 on 14-for-24 shooting, including this insane floater after drawing the foul. Russell Westbrook did his thing, notching his fourth straight triple-double with 23 points, 14 rebounds and 14 assists and this nifty Eurostep: Nerlens Noel started in place of the injured Steven Adams, chipping in 12 points, seven rebounds and five blocks. But no one stood out quite like Dennis Schroder, who took over in the fourth quarter, scoring 18 of his 21 down the stretch as OKC rallied to take control. At one point, Schroder hit seven straight including a pair of 3s and two three-point plays. \u201dI do the same every night,\u201d Schroder said. \u201dI try to stay aggressive, look for my shot, look for open teammates and just make the right play. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m out there 48 minutes, but it\u2019s working out so far.\u201d A reminder on The Horry Scale: It breaks down a game-winning buzzer-beater (GWBB) in the categories of difficulty, game situation (was the team tied or behind at the time?), importance (playoff game or garden-variety night in January?) and celebration. Then we give it an overall grade on a scale of 1-5 Robert Horrys, named for the patron saint of last-second answered prayers. * * * The Spurs nearly blew it late against the Suns, but Rudy Gay saved the day. With the game tied at 124, Gregg Popovich opted to not take a timeout and instead left the game in the hands of his veteran. Gay, who finished with 16 points on 7-for-17 shooting, had an isolation at the top of the key and calmly nailed a 21-foot jump shot over Kelly Oubre Jr. to give San Antonio the 126-124 win. DIFFICULTY: The final play was a simple clear-out isolation with Gay initially being guarded by Suns forward Josh Jackson. After LaMarcus Aldridge came to set a screen, the Suns switched, leaving Oubre Jr. as the man tasked with stopping the 12-year veteran. Gay dribbled to his left from the top of the 3-point line, crossing over once before pulling up and taking the jumper while fading slightly to his left. Oubre Jr. played it as well as he could, getting a hand in Gay\u2019s face, but Gay was able to get the shot off. GAME SITUATION: The Suns came into Tuesday\u2019s matchup on an eight-game losing streak, and nearly pulled off the upset. Devin Booker finished with 38 points, but it wasn\u2019t enough. With 24.9 seconds left, the Spurs clung to a 124-122 lead. After receiving the inbounds pass, Marco Belinelli was stripped by Jackson, who flew in for the game-tying dunk. Instead of calling timeout, Popovich let his team play out the final seconds and Gay got the job done. CELEBRATION: Gay\u2019s been here before, and his reaction to knocking down the game-winner showed it. After seeing the shot drop, Gay turned around and calmly strutted toward the Spurs\u2019 bench before his teammates mobbed him at midcourt. They continued jumping on the hero before Gay finally took a tumble to the ground. GRADE: There wasn\u2019t anything spectacular or overly difficult about the winner. It came down to a simple one-on-one play we\u2019ve all done in our backyard courts. But Oubre Jr. is a solid defender and it was a nice between-the-legs dribble to set up the slightly fading jumper. Gay\u2019s length and veteran presence won on this day. Two and a half Horrys . \u201cThey outplayed and out-coached us, out-physicaled us, out-executed us. We had no respect for them or for the game. We didn\u2019t play with each other and it was a pathetic performance. Phoenix got robbed.\u201d \u2014 Gregg Popovich, after the Spurs\u2019 126-124 win over the Suns Brandon Ingram had a big night in the Lakers\u2019 121-105 loss to the Sixers, scoring 36 points, which featured this monster dunk and staredown over Corey Brewer: Stat of the Night, II  James Harden became the fourth player in NBA history to tally 600 points, 100 rebounds and 100 assists in a calendar month. And he did it in just 14 games. Flat-Footed 3-Pointer  You know you\u2019ve got it going when you\u2019re hitting shots like this with one shoe dangling off your foot: Shabazz Napier scored 24 points off the bench and matched a career-high with five 3-pointers, to help Brooklyn beat Chicago 122-117 for a ninth straight win at home.

The NBA fined the Pelicans star because of his agent\u2019s comments that Davis won\u2019t sign an extension and wants to be traded. The league office said in a written statement released Tuesday evening that Davis violated a collectively-bargained rule prohibiting players or their representatives from making public trade demands. The NBA said the fine is for statements that were made by Davis\u2019 agent, Rich Paul, on Monday in an intentional effort to undermine the contractual relationship between Davis and the Pelicans. Davis is under contract with New Orleans through the end of the 2019-20 season. He was drafted by the Pelicans with the first overall pick in 2012 after winning an NCAA national championship with Kentucky and has been named an All-Star the previous five seasons. However, the Pelicans have made the playoffs in only two of his six full NBA seasons and won only won playoff series, sweeping Portland in the first round last season before falling in five games to champion Golden State in the second round. Davis has averaged 29.3 points and 13.3 rebounds per game this season, but has missed the past four games with a sprained left index finger while the Pelicans have fallen to 22-28 heading into Tuesday night\u2019s game at Houston. Had Davis been committed to remaining in New Orleans, he would be eligible this summer for a five-year, roughly $240 million extension with the Pelicans that would have kicked in beginning with the 2020-21 season. In previous years, Davis had professed his affection for New Orleans. But Davis has also said that his NBA salary is secondary to winning \u2014 a clear sign to Pelicans management that they could not take re-signing him for granted if they failed to take concrete and successful steps to surround him with a cast of players who would make New Orleans a contender. When healthy, the Pelicans have looked formidable in short spurts, but injuries have exposed their lack of depth and cohesion as they\u2019ve slipped near the bottom of the Western Conference through the first half of this season. The Pelicans have acknowledged Davis\u2019 preference to be traded and appear inclined to honor it rather than lose him for nothing. But a statement from the franchise made it clear that the Pelicans\u2019 brass are prepared to be patient while awaiting a deal done on their terms and timeline. The implication is that a trade may not come before the Feb. 7 deadline to make a deal this season, and more likely could come after the season, when 2019 draft slots are known and when the Boston Celtics are eligible to enter the fray. Boston, which has a stockpile of draft picks and promising young players as trade bait, is not eligible to trade for Davis under NBA rules until July 1, unless the Celtics also trade away Kyrie Irving. Irving is a factor because of what\u2019s known as the Rose Rule, which says NBA teams cannot trade for more than one player who has signed an extension. Irving currently is playing under an extension signed with Cleveland that has an option year after this season, meaning it could be renegotiated in a way that also allows Boston to bid for Davis."},{"id":36028,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-pelicans-no-rush-deal-anthony-davis","date":"2019-01-29","title":"Report: Pelicans in no rush to deal Davis","content":"New Orleans Pelicans star Anthony Davis delivered a shock to the NBA world on Monday with news of his desire to be traded .

To acquire Davis, the Lakers would likely have to part with a combination of future Draft picks and young assets such as Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram, Kyle Kuzma and Josh Hart. On Monday, the Pelicans issued a statement that acknowledged Davis\u2019 trade request, but also made it clear they will deal him when it suits the team best. \u201cThis past weekend, Anthony Davis\u2019 representatives informed us that Anthony does not wish to sign a contract extension with our team and subsequently has requested a trade,\u201d the Pelicans\u2019 statement said . \u201cAlthough we are disappointed in this decision, our organization\u2019s top priority is to bring an NBA championship to our city and fans and build our team for long-term success. Relative to specific talks of a trade, we will do this on our terms and our timeline. One that makes the most sense for our team and it will not be dictated by those outside of our organization. We have also requested the League to strictly enforce the tampering rules associated with this transaction.\u201d Davis\u2019 agent, Rich Paul, told several media outlets yesterday of Davis\u2019 desire to be moved. Paul and Davis are expected to tell teams that Davis\u2019 preferred destination is the Lakers and he\u2019ll be a rental player if he\u2019s dealt anywhere else. Davis can become a free agent in 2020. The Lakers are not the only team thought to be a threat to acquire Davis, as the Boston Celtics have the combination of assets and future Draft picks that could make them a player for Davis. The Celtics cannot trade for Davis under NBA rules until July 1, unless they also trade away Kyrie Irving \u2014 which likely won\u2019t happen. Irving is a factor because of what\u2019s known as the \u201cRose Rule,\u201d the one that says NBA teams cannot trade for more than one player who has signed an extension. Other teams, per ESPN, are weighing the possibility of making offers for Davis \u2014 even those teams that would essentially be renting him as described above. According to Chris Haynes of Yahoo Sports , the New York Knicks have also started to prepare trade offers for Davis. In addition to the Knicks, Lakers and Celtics, the Milwaukee Bucks and Toronto Raptors are also expected to make trade offers, too, per Kevin O\u2019Connor of The Ringer . In addition, the Denver Nuggets are considered by NBA front-office types to be an \u201coff-the-radar\u201d team that has the assets to pursue Davis, writes O\u2019Connor. Davis could sign a 5-year, $240 million super max extension this summer and can become a free agent in the summer of 2020. \u201cAnthony wants to be traded to a team that allows him the chance to win consistently and compete for a championship,\u201d Paul said Monday . \u201cAnthony wanted to be honest and clear with his intentions and that\u2019s the reason for informing them of this decision now. That\u2019s in the best interests of both Anthony\u2019s and the organization\u2019s future.\u201d Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry spoke with Davis on Monday morning and said Davis told him he\u2019d play the rest of the season once he recovers from his finger injury. He was diagnosed with a sprained left finger late last week that was expected to sideline him up to two weeks . \u201cHe plans on playing out the season,\u201d Gentry said Monday afternoon . \u201cThat\u2019s my role as to try and win as many games as we possibly can. I think AD is a professional guy. He\u2019s going to play as hard as he can once he gets well and we\u2019re going to the best we can to try and put our team in a position to win games. \u201cI spoke to the team this morning and I think everybody understands it\u2019s part of the business,\u201d Gentry said. \u201cI thought we had a good practice. It was a spirited one. That\u2019s all we can do. We have to come out and prepare the team. He\u2019s still under contract. When he gets healthy, he\u2019ll play.\u201d When asked if Davis could be dealt prior to the NBA\u2019s Feb. 7 trade deadline, Gentry said that was something \u201cyou\u2019d have to take up with (Pelicans general manager) Dell (Demps) and (Saints general manager\/Pelicans executive vice president of basketball operations) Mickey (Loomis).\u201d Davis is averaging 29.3 points, 13.3 rebounds, 4.4 assists, 1.7 steals and 2.6 blocks per game this season . He\u2019ll almost certainly become a six-time All-Star later this week when the NBA announces the full rosters for this year\u2019s game that will be played Feb. 17 in Charlotte. Davis\u2019 finger injury occurred in a 128-112 loss to the Portland Trail Blazers on Jan. 18. Various other injuries \u2014 including an ankle injury earlier in the season and a hip injury in November \u2014 have limited Davis to 41 games this season. Despite those bumps in the road, though, Davis has been spectacular when healthy. He has scored 30 or more points 12 times this season and 40 or more points seven times . However, the Pelicans are just 11-8 in those 19 games. New Orleans is 22-28 and has lost three straight and seven of its last eight games, putting it at No. 13 in the Western Conference playoff chase . Last season, Davis was instrumental in the Pelicans\u2019 playoff run, powering them into the postseason as the No. 6 seed. Once there, they swept the No. 3-seeded Portland Trail Blazers in the first round before losing in five games in the West semifinals to the Golden State Warriors. He\u2019s an elite superstar on a team that hasn\u2019t gotten past the West semifinals since he\u2019s been in New Orleans \u2014 and in four of his first six full seasons, the Pelicans didn\u2019t qualify for the playoffs at all. A five-time All-Star, Davis was an All-NBA first team member in three of the last four seasons. He has made three All-Defensive teams in his career and is the Pelicans\u2019 all-time leader in points, rebounds, blocks, field goals attempted and made and free throws attempted and made.

It was Anthony Davis who changed representation four months ago \u2014 to Rich Paul of Klutch Sports Group, who represents LeBron James among a slew of other NBA talent. And then it was Davis again who told the New Orleans Pelicans he would not sign a \u201csuper max\u201d contract extension next summer and wants a trade. There are no dots to be connected here. It\u2019s a pretty straightforward line, stretching from New Orleans to L.A. But how and when does Davis get from there \u2026 to there? That\u2019s where it gets interesting, and the fates of two franchises are at stake: The championship-chasing Lakers in the LeBron era, and the long-term health of the Pelicans, who have nothing to show for Davis and his generational talent except two playoff berths and a trip to the Western Conference semifinals last year. When Paul, a LeBron friend and business partner who runs Klutch, broke the stunning news to the Pelicans, it hit the NBA fan. From there, it created a firestorm in several NBA cities that have either the assets to work out a trade or the money under the salary cap \u2014 or both. Davis is the rare player whose availability can cause teams to hastily rearrange the roster furniture. His impact on both ends of the floor is unquestioned and he\u2019s still in his prime at only 25. He\u2019s averaging 29.3 points, 13.3 rebounds, 4.4 assists, 1.7 steals and 2.6 blocks this season. His kind doesn\u2019t come available often. With the Feb. 7 trade deadline looming, the number of teams capable of swinging deals for Davis would seem endless. There is, however, a catch: Davis holds most, if not all, of the leverage \u2014 his contract only runs one more season. He can impact any proposed deal the Pelicans might seek by simply telling the other team: I\u2019m not signing an extension. Why would the Celtics surrender a package including Jayson Tatum and multiple No. 1 picks for a one-year rental? Especially since the Celtics still would need to re-sign Kyrie Irving, who becomes a free agent next summer? Why would any contender part company with their best players without any guarantee Davis will stick around? If that happened, they\u2019d become \u2026 the Pelicans. The San Antonio Spurs were in a similar situation with Kawhi Leonard last summer. They managed to swing a trade with the Toronto Raptors for a fairly solid return: All-Star DeMar DeRozan and filler . There were reports, however, that the Raptors were ready to shake up the team within the next two years anyway. By getting Leonard, they decided to go all-in this season, and if he leaves next summer through free agency, then it\u2019s back to their original plan. This is all about Davis and his preferred landing spot and while he hasn\u2019t said anything publicly, the situation has transparency. There\u2019s LeBron, the L.A. lifestyle, the desire by the Lakers to compete immediately and a very real chance to win \u2014 which Paul cited as why Davis wants out. It\u2019s hard to create a scenario where the Lakers aren\u2019t the clear leaders in the clubhouse. In that situation, the trade will be made based on who blinks first: the Pelicans or the Lakers. If the Pelicans are indeed dealing with a one-card deck \u2014 meaning, just the Lakers \u2014 then their options are limited. Lakers president Magic Johnson can squeeze New Orleans in negotiations by offering only one of their young trio (Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball and Kyle Kuzma) and toss in some veterans to make the contracts work. The Pelicans can refuse and keep Davis until next summer, trying to force the Lakers into upping the offer. If New Orleans decides to play hardball and holds onto Davis through the end of the season or even until his contract expires in 2020, that becomes the risk for the Lakers. LeBron is already 34 and will likely miss his 17th straight game tonight with a groin injury. The window for surrounding him with another singer who can take lead mic during a title run is half-shut, and closing. So the stare-down begins, and continues. It\u2019s an awkward time for Ball, Kuzma and Ingram, because one or perhaps two seem to be certain sacrifices in any deal. This season, they\u2019ve spoken about the chance to play alongside LeBron and learn from him. Now, one or two of them will potentially explore their own path in New Orleans. It\u2019s also a clumsy time for the Pelicans. Davis is currently sitting out while mending from a finger injury . But why would the Pelicans welcome him back once he heals? It makes for bad optics to have him in the locker room when he already stated a desire to leave \u2014 essentially saying those teammates aren\u2019t good enough to win \u2014 and there\u2019s always an injury risk given his history. It might be better for all involved if the Pelicans shut him down. The ripple effect might also cause the Pelicans to trade Jrue Holiday, their pricey point guard, whose value to the team diminishes without Davis. Losing Davis means the Pelicans are ripe for a tear-down, an excuse to start the full implosion right away and prepare for a 2019 draft that\u2019s top-heavy with talent. Another issue the Pelicans must address: should they let GM Dell Demps be the triggerman on any potential deal of such magnitude? By demanding a trade, Davis implicitly indicated lost confidence in the general manager \u2014 if not the entire basketball operation \u2014 and the Pelicans\u2019 ability to build a winner. They\u2019ve squandered the early part of Davis\u2019 career with bad Drafts, bad free-agent signings and foregone first-round picks. Demps was singled out by former commissioner David Stern in an October Sports Illustrated article for being \u201ca bad GM\u201d who\u2019s \u201cprobably going to lose Anthony Davis.\u201d  The Pelicans did have lousy luck involving DeMarcus Cousins when the All-Star center suffered a torn Achilles\u2019 tendon last spring . At the time, the Cousins-Davis pairing showed enormous potential ( both were All-Stars starters last season ). In the end, New Orleans refused to offer Cousins a new contract last summer \u2014 with understandable concern about his health. They have nothing to show for a trade that cost them Buddy Hield , who\u2019s averaging 20.2 points for the Sacramento Kings. There remain minor questions about Davis. Only twice in his almost seven seasons has he played more than 70 games. Can he stay healthy? And despite his all-around greatness, why hasn\u2019t Davis managed to carry an average team in the manner of other generational talents? The most obvious example that comes to mind is James Harden during Chris Paul\u2019s recent month-long absence in Houston. And then there\u2019s a better example: James himself. Davis would be an ideal match for James in talent but also temperament. Davis doesn\u2019t bring a big personality and seems to welcome another big star, as he did last season with Cousins. At this point in his career, Davis seems unlikely to feel threatened and flee LeBron, searching for something else, as Kyrie Irving did two years ago . At the Pelicans\u2019 request, the league is investigating whether any tampering has taken place with regard to Davis, the timing of the trade demand and even the demand itself. Clearly, the Pelicans are irked by this, but they should\u2019ve seen it coming. Davis gave New Orleans nearly seven seasons. They gave him little in terms of help. So the All-Star decides to call the shots and dictate the terms of his future. He will have a large say in where he ends up, and the best match is melodic: \u2019Bron and \u2019Brow. Someone just say when. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

Nope. The Warriors never trailed, and led by as many as 35, as they demolished a hard-working Pacers team only just beginning to adjust to life without Victor Oladipo .  Defensive linchpin Draymond Green was held out to rest a variety of aches and pains, Kevin Durant missed 14 of 21 shots, and the Warriors still rolled to their 11th straight win as Stephen Curry scored 26 points in 26 minutes and DeMarcus Cousins added 22 in 25. \u201cWe\u2019ve been more dialed in the last month than we have for sure all season, and for much of last season,\u201d Kerr said after the 132-100 final. \u201cYou can just see, turnovers are down and guys are moving the ball. We\u2019re in a good place. Just gotta keep it going.\u201d Given their upcoming schedule , it seems almost impossible that they won\u2019t. Indeed, with seven of their next nine at home, the Warriors could push their streak up to 20 without too much trouble before they head back out on the road for a four-game swing beginning Feb. 25. The toughest date before then is a road game in Portland on Feb. 13, the final contest before the All-Star break. But with the NBA\u2019s best road record at 18-8, the Warriors will certainly like their chances. Otherwise, their other road game over that span is against the lowly Suns, while just two of their seven home opponents \u2014 Miami (13-11) and Utah (14-13) \u2014 have winning away records. If they can take care of all that business, the Warriors would have their second 20-game winning streak in four-plus seasons \u2014 their 28-win run spanned the 2014-15 and 2015-16 campaigns \u2014 but only the sixth in NBA history. And at this point, with Klay Thompson emerging from his season-long slump and Cousins quickly settling into the Warriors\u2019 quad All-Star lineup, it would be foolish to bet against them. While the Warriors averted their letdown game, the Denver Nuggets very nearly did not, falling behind by 25 points midway through the third quarter to a Memphis Grizzlies squad languishing 14 games behind them in the standings. Then, pure magic. Having cut the lead to 17 points entering the fourth, they outscored the Grizzlies 35-15 over the final 12 minutes \u2014 including two go-ahead buckets in the last 43.9 seconds \u2014 to steal a 95-92 victory .  Nikola Jokic muscled his way inside to finish a tough leaner over Marc Gasol that put the Nuggets ahead for good at 93-92. But it was Will Barton\u2019s 3-pointer on the previous possession that gave the Nuggets their first lead, albeit briefly, and triggered a moment of pure, unadulterated joy. (If Barton had yelled any louder, he just might have broken his jaw.) \u201cWe were not ready to play tonight, and that was very evident,\u201d Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. \u201cBut we stayed with it. That\u2019s a lot of character. You\u2019re down 70-45, and you don\u2019t give up \u2026 that bodes well for our future.\u201d \u201cWe started playing together. We started to play for each other,\u201d added Jokic, who continued his All-Star push with 24 points. \u201cEven when they were scoring, we didn\u2019t give up. It was one hell of a comeback for us.\u201d One of their best ever, to be exact. The 17-point deficit tied for the largest Denver has erased entering the fourth quarter. (And that doesn\u2019t take into account that the Nuggets immediately fell behind by 19.) Keeping pace with the Warriors atop the West standings will be almost impossible. But victories like this could be crucial as the Nuggets battle Oklahoma City, Portland and anyone else that can wedge their way into the mix for the No. 2 spot. As for the Grizzlies, who continue to plummet after their hot start, it only adds fuel to speculation that they\u2019ll move Gasol and\/or fellow mainstay Mike Conley Jr. and enter a full-blown rebuild. \u201cThey\u2019re going to do what they think is best for the franchise,\u201d Gasol said. \u201cI told them I wanted to stay. Either way, they\u2019re going to do what they have to do, and you have to respect that.\u201d Known far more for his silky shooting touch, Thompson continued his recent assault on the rim with an aggressive slam against the Pacers. The best part, however, was another Shaqtin\u2019 moment from Curry as he celebrated \u2014 or more accurately, tried to celebrate \u2014 on the bench. Watch closely \u2026 \u201c(Thompson\u2019s dunk) was phenomenal,\u201d Curry said. \u201cHe started an earthquake situation or something. I succumbed to it on the sideline. \u201d It came only days after his now-infamous wipeout against the Lakers while loading up for a dunk of his own. As much as we enjoy these brief moments of vulnerability, Curry was quickly back to his invincible self as he blowtorched the Pacers for six 3-pointers in his point-a-minute outing. In doing so, he surpassed 200 3s for the seventh straight campaign, briefly extending his own NBA record. (Barring an injury or epic slump, Thompson will join him later this season.) Curry also took yet another moment to do something nice for one of his many fans. The Boston Celtics rejected 16 shots by the Brooklyn Nets, their most since at least 1983-84 per Basketball Reference. Six of those swats came from veteran center Al Horford, who put up a line not seen from a Celtic since The Chief, Robert Parish, in 1986: Oladipo has already vowed to come back \u201cbetter than ever\u201d from the ruptured quad tendon he had surgically repaired on Monday. His team gave him a nice little lift as he prepares to undertake that quest:"},{"id":35965,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/release-spencer-dinwiddie-medical-update","date":"2019-01-29","title":"Dinwiddie undergoes surgery on right thumb","content":" BROOKLYN \u2014 Brooklyn Nets guard Spencer Dinwiddie underwent successful surgery today to repair ligaments in his right thumb.

He doesn\u2019t want to talk about it, of course. He never does, whether things are going well or not. But it is clear he is enjoying this because his scoring outburst has coincided with Houston climbing the standings, back among the top teams in the Western Conference after an early-season slump. \u201cI love to hoop,\u201d he said. \u201cI love to just be out there and the grind.\u201d He scored 40 points in Houston\u2019s win over Orlando on Sunday night to extend his stretch of consecutive 30-point games to 23, the fourth-longest streak in NBA history behind three such streaks by Chamberlain. In 13 games this month, last season\u2019s MVP is averaging 44.1 points. He has scored at least 40 points in eight games in January, including two 50-point games and a franchise-record 61 in a win over the Knicks. \u201cIt\u2019s remarkable,\u201d teammate Eric Gordon said. \u201cI\u2019ve been around a lot of big-time players and he\u2019s for sure the best scorer I\u2019ve ever been around and he does it so easily. It\u2019s a credit to him. He\u2019s one of the best scorers ever.\u201d It isn\u2019t only Harden\u2019s teammates who have been wowed by his work. Memphis coach J.B. Bickerstaff, who worked for the Rockets from 2011-16, gushed about him. \u201cWhen we left here we thought he was really good and then somehow, some way he\u2019s gotten even better,\u201d he said. \u201cLast year he was the MVP and now he\u2019s even better and it\u2019s a credit to him, his work ethic and the passion that he plays the game with.\u201d Harden led the league in scoring last season for the first time by averaging 30.43 points a game, but injuries to Chris Paul and Clint Capela have forced him to carry an even bigger load this year and he\u2019s averaging in NBA-best 36.33. If he keeps this pace up for the rest of the season he would be the first player to average more than 36 points a game since Michael Jordan averaged 37.09 in in 1986-87. If the season ended today, Harden would have the seventh-highest scoring average in NBA history behind that season by Jordan, which ranks fifth, and five seasons by Chamberlain. His average is seven points higher than Steph Curry and Anthony Davis, who are tied for second with 29.3 points a game. But as much as Harden is scoring, he\u2019s also finding ways to get his teammates involved, and his 8.2 assists a game are tied for fourth in the league. \u201cI know the attention I draw on the court and the defense is locked on me so I try to help the guys get their opportunities to make it easier for them to score,\u201d Harden said. As Harden has been piling up points, opponents are searching for ways to slow him down. He\u2019s often asked about the different things teams have thrown at him and seems amused at the varying tactics. \u201cI\u2019ve been seeing double teams, triple teams, zones,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been seeing it all these past few weeks.\u201d During this streak more than one opposing coach has considered it an accomplishment to limit Harden to less than 40 points. Kenneth Faried, who signed with Houston last week, has had to defend Harden in the past and noted the mindset he had when faced with that task. \u201cHe\u2019s going to get 30,\u201d Faried said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to happen. So you might as well just mark that down in the book. You\u2019ve just got to make sure he doesn\u2019t get the 60 points.\u201d In the days following his 61-point show at Madison Square Garden, the Beard was asked if he feels like he\u2019s un-guardable right now. \u201cI mean, I\u2019ve always felt like that,\u201d he said with a sly smile and laugh. \u201cSo I don\u2019t know about now, but I\u2019ve had that feeling. It\u2019s just confidence. That\u2019s all it is.\u201d Houston went 12-5 in 17 games without Paul, who returned over the weekend. The Rockets have won three straight to improve to 29-20 and are in fifth place in the Western Conference. While they\u2019ve made strides since a terrible start had them near the bottom of the conference, Harden and Houston know they need to get much better if they hope to bring the team its first title since 1995. That, Harden says, is why he doesn\u2019t like all the talk about his high scoring and why those close to him know they shouldn\u2019t discuss it either. \u201cNobody can praise me,\u201d he said. \u201cNone of my friends and close family, I don\u2019t want them to be talking about it.

Additionally, The New York Times \u2018 Marc Stein reports Paul has not given the Pelicans a preferred trade destination for Davis. https:\/\/twitter.com\/wojespn\/status\/1089859367590158342 https:\/\/twitter.com\/wojespn\/status\/1089859367590158342 Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry spoke with Davis on Monday morning and said Davis told him he\u2019d play the rest of the season once he recovers from his finger injury. He was diagnosed with a sprained left finger late last week that was expected to sideline him up to two weeks . \u201cHe plans on playing out the season,\u201d Gentry said on Monday afternoon, writes Andrew Lopez of The Times-Picayune . \u201cThat\u2019s my role as to try and win as many games as we possibly can. I think AD is a professional guy. He\u2019s going to play as hard as he can once he gets well and we\u2019re going to the best we can to try and put our team in a position to win games.\u201d Gentry, who addressed the media just hours after the Davis\u2019 trade request went public, said the team understands Davis\u2019 request. \u201cI spoke to the team this morning and I think everybody understands it\u2019s part of the business,\u201d Gentry said, per The Times-Picayune . \u201cI thought we had a good practice. It was a spirited one. That\u2019s all we can do. We have to come out and prepare the team. He\u2019s still under contract. When he gets healthy, he\u2019ll play.\u201d When asked if Davis could be dealt prior to the NBA\u2019s Feb. 7 trade deadline, Gentry said that was something \u201cyou\u2019d have to take up with (Pelicans general manager) Dell (Demps) and (Saints general manager\/Pelicans executive vice president of basketball operations) Mickey (Loomis).\u201d Davis declined to speak with reporters today after the Pelicans\u2019 practice, but Gentry said Davis had treatment and went through a normal workout in the morning. New Orleans is traveling to face the Houston Rockets tomorrow ( 8 ET, TNT ). \u201cI didn\u2019t want to imagine it happening, but in the NBA, stuff happens,\u201d Gentry said. \u201cYou deal with it. That\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. We\u2019re dealing with what we have here. That doesn\u2019t mean we won\u2019t continue to compete and try to turn the season around.\u201d Pelicans guard Jrue Holiday spoke with reporters at Monday\u2019s practice and was asked about Anthony\u2019s reported trade request. Holiday said Davis told him of about his desire to be traded prior to it coming out today. \u201cI\u2019ve really enjoyed playing with Anthony. He\u2019s like 90 percent of the reason why I stayed (in New Orleans),\u201d Holiday said, per Will Guillory of The Athletic . \u201cAnthony had to do what\u2019s best for him, Holiday said. \u201cIt\u2019s business. \u2026 he\u2019s going to come in here and work.\u201d News of Davis\u2019 trade request presents a prime opportunity for the Los Angeles Lakers to make a run at him. Paul also represents Lakers star LeBron James and the team has been determined to acquire Davis in a deal, Wojnarowski reports. According to Chris Haynes of Yahoo Sports , the Lakers and Knicks have started to prepare trade offers for Davis. The Boston Celtics have also been rumored off and on for years as a potential landing spot for Davis. The Celtics have a treasure trove of assets \u2014 young players, future Draft picks and veterans on favorable deals \u2014 that could make such a super-trade possible. However, the Celtics cannot deal for Davis because a rule tied to when he and current Celtics star guard Kyrie Irving signed their last contract extensions. Known as the \u201cRose Rule,\u201d this provision allows certain players coming off their rookie-scale contracts to earn 30 percent of the salary cap as opposed to 25 percent. To be eligible, a player must have achieved one of the following four accolades in his first four seasons: Kia MVP award, Kia Defensive Player of the Year Award or two All-NBA selections. (When Davis and Irving inked their extensions, All-Star selections were in the wording instead of Kia DPOY.) Davis was a two-time All-Star by the summer of 2015 ( when he signed his extension ) as was Irving (when he did likewise in the summer of 2014 ). Per the NBA collective bargaining agreement, teams cannot trade for more than one player who has signed an extension under the \u201cRose Rule.\u201d The Celtics picked up Irving from the Cleveland Cavaliers in August of 2017, so they cannot trade for Davis until Irving either leaves in free agency or agrees to a new deal. The earliest that can take place is July 1, 2019. If Davis is traded and plays out the rest of his current contract, his new team could sign him to a five-year, $205 million extension next summer. If he enters unrestricted free agency in 2020, the most Davis could sign for with a new team is four years at $152 million. Davis is averaging 29.3 points, 13.3 rebounds, 4.4 assists, 1.7 steals and 2.6 blocks per game this season . He\u2019ll almost certainly become a six-time All-Star later this week when the NBA announces the full rosters for this year\u2019s game that will be played Feb. 17 in Charlotte. Davis\u2019 finger injury occurred in a 128-112 loss to the Portland Trail Blazers on Jan. 18. Various other injuries \u2014 including an ankle injury earlier in the season and a hip injury in November \u2014 have limited Davis to 41 games this season. Despite those bumps in the road, though, Davis has been spectacular when healthy. He has scored 30 or more points 12 times this season and 40 or more points seven times . However, the Pelicans are just 11-8 in those 19 games. New Orleans is 22-28 and has lost three straight and seven of its last eight games, putting it at No. 13 in the Western Conference playoff chase . Last season, Davis was instrumental in the Pelicans\u2019 playoff run, powering them into the postseason as the No. 6 seed. Once there, they swept the No. 3-seeded Portland Trail Blazers in the first round before losing in five games in the West semifinals to the Golden State Warriors. He\u2019s an elite superstar on a team that hasn\u2019t gotten past the second round of the playoffs since he\u2019s been in New Orleans \u2014 and in four of his first six full seasons, the Pelicans didn\u2019t qualify for the postseason at all. His telling New Orleans that he wants out is the latest power move by a star player who wants to get traded, following a path now similar to what Kawhi Leonard did when he wanted to be traded by San Antonio and what Paul George did when he decided it was time to move on from Indiana. Telling the Pelicans that he won\u2019t re-sign with them provides a blunt message: Move me, or lose me for nothing. But New Orleans, which controls Davis\u2019 contract through the 2019-20 season, has been steadfast for months: The Pelicans have no desire to move their best player, who is in line to sign a $240 million, five-year extension in 2020. \u201cWe\u2019re not trading him,\u201d Gentry said last month, one of many times he\u2019s addressed the topic. \u201cI can say that to the world. We\u2019re not going to trade him, no matter what. That\u2019s not an option.\u201d  A five-time All-Star, Davis was an All-NBA first team member in three of the last four seasons. He has made three All-Defensive teams in his career and is the Pelicans\u2019 all-time leader in points scored, rebounds, blocks, field goals attempted and made and free throws attempted and made. A year ago at this time, the Pelicans had perhaps the most dominant frontcourt in the NBA with Davis lining up with DeMarcus Cousins. Then Cousins tore his Achilles, and wound up signing this past summer with Golden State.

And when it does, it wakes up early. It was a little after 7 a.m. ET on Monday when ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski first reported the news that Anthony Davis is ready to leave New Orleans after 6 1\/2 years with the Pelicans. During that time frame, his team has won a single playoff series. The timing of the news is seemingly about getting Davis to the Los Angeles Lakers, because the team with the best collection of trade assets is the Boston Celtics. They can\u2019t trade have both Davis and Kyrie Irving on the same roster until Irving is done with his current contract (which he can opt out of on July 1). Of course, the Pelicans have no obligation to deal Davis in the 10 days before the Feb. 7 trade deadline, because he\u2019s under contract until July of 2020. Waiting until July, when Boston can enter the bidding, would seemingly be the best play. But the Lakers will surely make an effort to get a deal done now, and other teams will put some interesting assets on the table. Buckle up. It\u2019s going to a wild run to the deadline.

That setting seemed appropriate for Ron Adams, the Warriors\u2019 defensive guru and one of the NBA\u2019s most thoughtful interview subjects. Adams, 71, is a wholistic coach, a native Californian whose career instructing and imparting wisdom to players dates to 1969, when he started as an assistant at Fresno Pacific University (his alma mater). His theories and concepts have been honed through stops at Fresno State and, starting in 1992, in the NBA at San Antonio, Philadelphia, Milwaukee, Chicago, Oklahoma City, Boston and now Golden State. During his time as an assistant, Adams\u2019 teams have reached the postseason 17 times, including four Finals and three championships in his time with Golden State.  Adams joined the Warriors in 2014 as much to mentor then-new coach Steve Kerr as to shape their defense. It was a merging of old school and new age that both men swiftly embraced. NBA.com\u2019s Steve Aschburner spoke with the veteran coach after the team\u2019s practice in Cambridge. * * * Steve Aschburner:  So much attention has been paid to DeMarcus Cousins\u2019 addition to your lineup, as far as giving you five dangerous scorers and no one that opponents comfortably can leave to double-team elsewhere. But I\u2019m eager to learn about Cousins as a defender and what your team and he are facing on that side of the ball. Ron Adams:  There are some challenges. One of them is, he hasn\u2019t played for a year, regardless of any of the skills you\u2019re looking at. But we kind of anticipated what we thought he could do and build a system that works for him. Having said that, I\u2019ve been pleased with his defense in the four games that he\u2019s played. He gives us a different look in the paint, obviously, but he\u2019s a quick player. He\u2019s got good feet. I don\u2019t think defense has always been upper-most in his mind in the past. But he\u2019s been quite good thus far. He\u2019s shown that he anticipates well and reads well. We do quite a bit of switching \u2014 he\u2019s done a little bit of that lately, and he\u2019s pretty good at it. But we\u2019re trying to bring that aspect along with him. I think he\u2019s shown good awareness and he\u2019s played with good spirit, and really has been a pleasure to be around. SA:  You mention quick feet, but this is a guy recovering from Achilles tendon surgery. RA:  If you look at DeMarcus\u2019 career, and he\u2019d tell you this too, he\u2019s been pretty oriented toward offense, toward rebounding the ball and defending in the paint. But he does have good feet \u2014 I don\u2019t think the injury has hurt him at all. In fact, that Achilles is a lot stronger than the other one, I\u2019m sure now. These rehabs are really intense and he put a lot of good work into it. It\u2019s more of a mentality with him. I think he\u2019s bought in well. He wants to do well. And he\u2019s shown good focus on the defensive end. SA:  How much does it help that he\u2019s with a team that demands defense and has proven the value of it? As opposed to Cousins\u2019 exuberance over this opportunity and wanting to be a good employee who doesn\u2019t rock the boat? RA:  It\u2019s a little bit of everything you\u2019ve mentioned. But he\u2019s a good basketball guy. He likes the game. He wants to get better. Certainly, the emphasis of the team has helped him, as far as wanting to be balanced offensively and defensively. If you want to win championships and you\u2019re not playing great defense, that\u2019s not going to happen for you. But I\u2019ve found him very open to what we\u2019ve had to say. I see him working on things that are important to our program. I think he\u2019s internalized those things so they\u2019re important to him. SA:  What role do the other players play in this, on court and off, in blending him into the team\u2019s culture? RA:  Certainly the nature of our group has helped him. Our guys were so supportive of him after the first game, it was really gratifying to watch the response of our team. They want him to do well, as do our coaches. This might be a very short stay here, who knows? But to a man on our coaching staff, and Steve [Kerr] is so great at this, we really want him to get back on his feet and be the player he was \u2014 and some. I think he understands that about us. Steve is so inclusive and so helpful to a player like DeMarcus. So we\u2019re making progress. It\u2019s going to be a while. He\u2019s really helped us offensively already \u2014 he\u2019s a great passer, he\u2019s been a good quarterback for us too. The other part of his game is growing.  SA:  Do you anticipate he\u2019s going to be attacked on pick-and-rolls? He has been a target for that in the past. RA:  Teams had their strategies. But I don\u2019t see that being a huge problem. In the orthodox coverages of the game I think he\u2019s fine. In the new age, when people are coming off shooting threes and that pick is set at the 3-point line, that\u2019s when you have to make some adjustments. I think he\u2019s shown already he\u2019ll be capable of doing that. SA:  You\u2019ve mentioned Steve, a guy you have been mentoring as a coach. Five seasons in, what are your impressions? RA:  What you would expect just from the technical standpoint. He\u2019s become a very good coach on both sides of the ball, and he really enjoys it. Keeps growing in that regard, which is to be expected. Steve is a very bright guy, knows the game well before becoming a coach. He\u2019s such a measured person in how he looks at the game \u2014 he\u2019s a very competitive guy \u2014 and what his long view is. I mean, we all get better. I\u2019m 71 years old and I\u2019m learning every year. This league \u2026 even this year from last year, there\u2019s changes in how the game is played. The mentality. Now we\u2019re into a \u201cnot practice too much, make sure your guys are healthy\u201d phase. It\u2019s much more of an emphasis now. So you have stark changes and a lot of subtle ones. Steve\u2019s philosophy for how a team should operate is, I think, spot-on for the modern age. And I think this has been helpful for DeMarcus, by the way. We don\u2019t want him changing his style as a player, but we do hope, as with all of our guys, that they play the game with joy. Enjoy themselves, enjoy each other, stay mindful of how fortunate they are.  SA:  As a defensive-focused coach, you\u2019ve been around from the days of hand-checking and intensely physical play to this new era of \u201cfreedom of movement\u201d in which defenders dare not even breathe on an opponent. RA:  This year\u2019s been a little frustrating at times. It just means you have to do certain things better. One thing is defensive transition, and even when you transition well, so many people are shooting early threes. We have teams with five 3-point shooters in their lineups and it\u2019s putting a lot of stress on defensive transition. Your team aspects, your help aspects have to be good. How you handle the kinds of penetrations that the new rules are allowing for more. Seemingly the offensive player can do little wrong. We\u2019ve got a lot of pushing off offensively on guys, which seems to be OK at the moment, perhaps until the playoffs come, I don\u2019t know. These changes, you can adjust to them through your help-side defense, your cell, the kinds of things every team teaches. But when something is taken away from you in a system, you have to put more emphasis on team play. SA:  Do you ever feel picked on, which so many changes favoring offense? RA:  I don\u2019t feel picked on. I look at it as a challenge. It has its frustrations. But I think when all is said and done, the good defensive teams will be there at the end. Whatever the definition of that is. You adjust. The NBA is so fascinating \u2014 there are so many facets to it. \u2026 It taxes one but it also broadens one. SA:  You long have been a devotee of switching on defense, to maintain maximum pressure on the ball. Now so many teams do that \u2014 is it gratifying to see them adopt your methods? RA:  When a team is winning and does something, everyone looks at it. You look at the roster and say, \u201cWell, maybe we should build our roster like Team A has.\u201d I must say, some teams have emulated us and emulated us very well, because they\u2019re very tough. [laughs] And they\u2019re loaded with great depth and do things so well. SA:  Can you compare the Warriors\u2019 defense from one year to the next? Or even rank them? Maybe it\u2019s like ranking your kids. Or maybe the rules and personnel changes make that difficult. RA:  No, I can make some comparisons. We have been kind of up and down. Statistically, we\u2019re a middle-of-the-pack team right now. Some stats are good, others aren\u2019t. I\u2019d like our field-goal defensive percentage to be a little better and our 3-point defensive percentage to be better. Early in the year, I think we were tops in 3-point defense. We kind of play up and down in the regular season. But seldom do we not get the other team\u2019s best game. Statistically, I allow for that. [Saturday] was a huge game for Boston \u2014 you get people\u2019s best. When we let down, and it can be any team \u2026 Phoenix does not have a glossy record but they have talent and they\u2019re tough to play. If we\u2019re not ready on that given night, the evening can get long. That\u2019s the fun thing about being a champion, that\u2019s the thing you have to embrace and recognize. Steve goes a masterful job of understanding this. Working around it and not getting too distraught when things aren\u2019t picture-perfect on the court. He helps me in that regard. SA:  So which edition of the Warriors was your best defensive team? RA:  I would say the first three teams were awfully, awfully good. Probably with more consistency in the regular season. But with us, we look at what we do when the second season starts. And we\u2019ve been sterling. That\u2019s the confidence that we have. When the playoffs start, we really start focusing on our opponent and feel good about what the defense will do on any given game. That\u2019s been pretty much the story the last four years. Last year\u2019s team, when it came down to it, in certain moments was every bit as good as those other teams. SA:  You\u2019re talking experience, muscle memory, confidence? RA: We all know what we can do when we\u2019re focused. When those times come in a game when we\u2019re not as focused as we\u2019d like, in a traditional coaching sense, we kind of understand our team. And again, Steve is so good in having foresight and believing in this team. SA:  Are you guys able to weigh the cumulative wear and tear of four extra-long seasons, going on five, against the accumulated knowledge and confidence of successfully handling it all? RA:  Once you win a championship, it changes your perspective \u2014 I\u2019m talking about players. It\u2019s not easy, very difficult to achieve, but the confidence that comes with it serves you well in critical periods of the games. SA:  So how are your players holding up from 100-plus games year after year? RA:  I keep going back to this, but Steve\u2019s done a good job with that. Sometimes when our performance is up and down, there\u2019s an understanding of that. It\u2019s not college. You\u2019re not going to beat your guys up in practice, but you want to be efficient. You want to stay organized. You want to reinforce all the good habits that allow us to do what we do. But there has to be a good formula with the end, the playoffs, being the thing you\u2019re tailoring everything around. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

The first came on Monday, as it breezed past the Rockets despite James Harden passing the 30-point mark again. Warriors 130, Lakers 111 \u2014 Just when you think Golden State can\u2019t one-up themselves in the shooting department, they prove you wrong.

James Harden will never have to answer that question after torching the New York Knicks for 61 points (a career-high) as well as logging the game-sealing dunk and steal down the stretch. Rockets 121, Raptors 119 \u2014 Another night, another thrilling win for Houston. This one was a true matchup of star power as Harden (35 points) and Kawhi Leonard (32 points) put on a solid scoring show all night long. Toronto made a late run at the win, but Leonard couldn\u2019t sink a potential game-winning 3-pointer at the buzzer. Warriors 115, Celtics 111 \u2014 National TV spotlight. Star power galore. And a game that did not disappoint. These two Finals favorites waged a game that featured 21 lead changes. Boston had three chances to tie or take the lead down the stretch, but couldn\u2019t deliver. And, it was a historic game, too: Warriors coach Steve Kerr became the fastest coach to amass 300 wins. Thunder 118, Bucks 112 \u2014 Oklahoma City star Paul George has garnered some Kia MVP buzz ( on this very web site, even ) of late. On Sunday, he showed any doubters why that was the case. In a national TV game against a fellow MVP type (Giannis Antetokounmpo), George had his way in guiding OKC to one of its biggest wins of the season.  James Harden (37 points, 12-26 FG, 6-13 3-point FG, 6 reb, 3 ast, 2 blk in 31 minutes) \u2014 Yes, this came in a blowout loss to the Philadelphia 76ers on Martin Luther King Jr. Day. Still, you have to sit back and watch the many different ways in which Harden manages to keep this 30-point scoring streak going each night. | Watch | Video box score James Harden (61 points, 17-38 FG, 22-25 FT, 15 reb, 4 ast, 5 stl in 40 minutes) \u2014  Harden not only notched his career high on Wednesday, but tied Kobe Bryant\u2019s record for a visiting player at the current Madison Square Garden. Harden made the night even more memorable, too, sinking the clinching layup with 3.8 seconds to seal the win. | Watch | Video box score James Harden (35 points, 9-25 FG, 15-15 FT, 2 reb, 7 ast in 40 minutes) \u2014 Make your free throws, kids. On a night when he struggled from deep \u2014 2-for-13 on 3-pointers \u2014 he went 15-for-15 at the line. As he did in New York two nights earlier, he also had a key layup \u2014 this one with about 90 seconds left that pushed Houston\u2019s lead to 117-105. | Watch | Video box score James Harden (40 points, 14-27 FG, 4-12 3-point FG, 8-9 FT, 11 reb, 6 ast, 3 blk in 37 minutes) \u2014 Hard to believe, but it was Harden\u2019s defense that might have been the story Sunday vs. the Orlando Magic. He was instrumental in shutting down Magic center Nikola Vucevic \u2014 who had killed Houston in the first half \u2014 and scored five critical points down the stretch in a comeback win. | Watch | Video box score Kevin Durant (33 points, 10-23 FG, 12-13 FT, 9 reb, 3 ast, 2 blk in 39 minutes) \u2014 He had the most points for Golden State on Saturday in Boston, but he was hardly the only one to come up big vs. the Celtics. Props here to Klay Thompson (who sank two critical late free throws) and Stephen Curry (two more late FTs with 6.2 seconds left) to ice the game. Durant got the headline here scoring-wise, but this game \u2014 especially down the stretch \u2014 showed why Golden State is so dangerous. | Watch | Video box score Luka Doncic (35 points, 14-24 FG, 12 reb, 10 ast in 36 minutes) \u2014 Pick an NBA legend. Got one in mind? Now, realize that none of them has accomplished what Doncic did Sunday in getting this triple-double. Doncic became the youngest player to record a 30-point triple-double, bypassing LeBron James (40-10-10 at 20 years, 100 days old) and De\u2019Aaron Fox (31-10-15; 20 years, 316 days). | Watch | Video box score Paul George (36 points, 12-21 FG, 8-12 3-point FG, 13 reb, 3 ast, 3 stl in 38 minutes) \u2014 Maybe there is something to this Paul George-for-Kia-MVP talk after all, huh? The Thunder star put on a show \u2014 including a must-see (and clutch) poster jam over Giannis Antetokounmpo \u2014 as the Thunder won their sixth straight game.

Carmelo Anthony was one of the people who told him he needed a proper goodbye. On Sunday, Wade\u2019s final lap around the league even brought Anthony back to Madison Square Garden. Anthony sat courtside at his former home to watch Wade help Miami beat the New York Knicks 106-97. \u201cI didn\u2019t know he was coming. I found out before the game. But it meant a lot, man. I am glad,\u201d Wade said. \u201cI talked to him this summer. We went out to dinner and I was contemplating retirement and Melo was one of the ones that was pushing me to come back and he was like, `Flash, you can\u2019t go out like that. You got to come back and get that love, that last tour kind of.\u2019 And he was a big part of me making that decision. I am glad he came out (to) see me play in person, you know, maybe for the last time. So it\u2019s cool.\u201d Anthony spent 6-plus seasons with the Knicks before they traded him to Oklahoma City in September 2017. He\u2019s still looking for a team after the Houston Rockets traded him to the Chicago Bulls, who are expected to either trade or waive the 10-time All-Star. Anthony received a loud ovation when he was shown on the overhead videoboard in the first quarter. He told MSG Network it was important to come back and see Wade, who is scheduled for one more game back in the arena in March. \u201cIt means a lot because it was very difficult for me to come out of the house and come to an NBA game,\u201d Anthony said , \u201cbut if there was one moment that I could come out and be here in this seat it\u2019s to come see him finish it out here in the Garden. \u2026 It\u2019s deeper than basketball when it comes to us.\u201d Anthony holds the single-game record at the current Garden with 62 points, one more than James Harden scored for Houston last week in a win over the Knicks. The New York native expects to return to the arena as more than a fan in the future. \u201cI\u2019ve had some great years in this building and I look forward to coming back and playing in this building some more,\u201d Anthony said."},{"id":36101,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/about-last-night-1-27-19","date":"2019-01-28","title":"About Last Night: Thunder rattle Giannis","content":" On Saturday night, with 4:11 left in the fourth quarter of Oklahoma City Thunder\u2019s 118-112 triumph over the Milwaukee Bucks, Russell Westbrook stayed on a switch as Giannis Antetokounmpo began to post from the left block. He spun as Thunder guard Dennis Schroder closed from the weak side. Westbrook held his position and swatted Antetokounmpo\u2019s soft layup off the bottom of the backboard. It was the seventh time an Oklahoma City Thunder player turned back one of Antetokounmpo\u2019s shots, a career-worst for the MVP candidate and the most suffered by any player in a single game this season. Giannis was bottled up thoroughly in the first half \u2013 0-for-6 FGs, three points, three turnovers \u2013 before pulling together a respectable final line of 27 points, 18 rebounds and 4 assists in the loss. The Thunder, who entered the game fourth in defensive efficiency (105.7 points allowed per 100 possessions) and exited it third (104.5), impressed a Bucks team that ranked among the top five offenses heading in. \u201cThey were just really active tonight,\u201d said Bucks swingman Khris Middleton , per the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel . \u201cWe knew they were going to be active in the passing lanes, in the paint guys were coming to pack the paint on Giannis and whatnot. I think we tried to do a great job of making the extra pass, those extra plays. Some we just didn\u2019t get the bounce or the roll and some we did.\u201d Yet none of the defensive success would\u2019ve mattered were it not for the heroics of Paul George, who did other things but will be remembered primarily for melting down #NBATwitter with this clutch dunk over Giannis: Not exactly PG-13, as ESPN\u2019s Marc J. Spears cleverly put it , and a suitable climax to a commanding 36-point, 13-rebound, three-steal performance. George shot 12-of-21 overall (8-12 3-point FGs) and, among other key plays, deflected a pass to earn a steal and position Westbrook to extend the lead to seven with 31.3 seconds remaining. In this best individual season to date, George has rightfully claimed an All-Star starting nod and a place in any MVP debate you\u2019d care to have. Chris Paul missed 17 games with a left hamstring strain, and returned to James Harden producing at historic levels, unprecedented for a guard or anyone else not named Wilt Chamberlain. When Kenneth Faried assisted an early floater against the Orlando Magic, it was the first bucket Harden hadn\u2019t created for himself in more than seven games , a total of 87 straight makes. Harden finished with 40 points, stretching his 30-plus streak to 23 games and bumping his season average to 36.3 ppg, the highest since Michael Jordan\u2019s 37.1 ppg in 1986-87. He hit several monster shots in a closing rally during Houston\u2019s 103-98 win. Paul, meanwhile, played 25 minutes \u2014 including the final stretch \u2014 to tally 12 points (4-8 FGs, 2-5 3-pint FGs), five rebounds, six assists and three steals. There were a few moments during which the rust was evident, but there was also this: Familiar, and not just for this observer, either. Said Harden : \u201cHe looked like he had extra pep in his step. He made that spin move and some other moves too, to check his body and how he felt. He looked great. It was good to see him back on the floor.\u201d If Harden manages to keep on keeping on, and Paul\u2019s able to ease his way back and eventually let \u2018er rip, Houston might be a lot closer to last season\u2019s 60-plus form than we thought during all that opening month mishegoss. We get to watch so much more of this AND THEN THERE ARE THE PLAYOFFS. Count me in. Let it never be said that Gregg Popovich can\u2019t find new ways to keep everyone on their toes \u2026 just 16 seconds into the 51st game of the this 23rd season as head coach: That was a friendly greeting to the squad that allowed this rim-rocker from Thomas Bryant on the opening possession against the Washington Wizards. The San Antonio Spurs went on to  a 132-119 victory . Message received, it would seem. The rookie that must insipire crippling angst \u2014 or whatever passes among pro athletes \u2014 for others in his class, Luka Doncic continues to do things that are either casually spectacular or actually record-breaking \u2026 like Sunday\u2019s 35-point, 12-rebound, 10-assist showing. Doncic became the youngest player to record a 30-point triple-double, bypassing LeBron James (40-10-10 at 20 years, 100 days old) and De\u2019Aaron Fox (31-10-15; 20 years, 316 days); Blake Griffin was the last rookie to hit the mark at all, doing so in 2011. This postgame interview went sideways quick: (For the Record: It\u2019s not inside out. But c\u2019mon \u2013 he knew when he put that on. The bullet-pointed list was so ready I could see the back-pocket flashcards.) Derrick Jones Jr. went down on the break in Miami, and it immediately drew strong concern from the bench: The Heat later provided a series of updates, first confirming the injury , then indicating X-rays were negative and that Jones will be re-evaluated Monday. Here\u2019s to a smooth recovery. Tough week for knees, though. Yikes. Though he\u2019s still on hardwood hiatus after a recent trade to the Bulls, Carmelo Anthony returned to his old Eighth Ave. haunt for Sunday\u2019s Knicks-Heat matchup \u2014 the first of two #OneLastDance visits for 2003 draft classmate Dwyane Wade. A tribute video covering the six-plus seasons Anthony spent in NYC warmed up the Garden crowd, which showed hearty appreciation for the man they call Melo: Well earned. Happy Monday, everyone."},{"id":36055,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/about-last-night-1-26-19","date":"2019-01-27","title":"About Last Night: Kerr obliterates coaching record","content":" During this Warriors dynasty, KD and Steph and Klay and Draymond have us accustomed to the unprecedented, to the previously unfathomable expansion of options for that which can simply *be* during a basketball game. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to acknowledge another moment in the league-wide, pace-and-space mayhem: On Saturday, Steve Kerr, the coach overseeing Golden State\u2019s championship ascent, won regular-season game No. 300 on the road in Boston. He has been coach for 377 games. Less than five seasons. Let that simmer. It took previous record-holder Pat Riley \u2013 an NBA legend and bag-full-of-rings champion as a player, coach and executive \u2013 415 games. Half an NBA campaign behind! With the Showtime Lakers! In fact, Kerr is the fastest to reach 300 victories in any of the nation\u2019s major sports leagues, beating out MLB\u2019s Frank Chance (426), the NFL\u2019s Don Shula (442) and NHL coach Bruce Coubdreau (496). (No MLS coach has yet achieved the feat.) This is a thing, what Kerr has accomplished. None of this is to say Boston made this easy. The Celtics pushed the Warriors throughout, with Kyrie turning in a 32-6-10, Al Horford adding 22-13-3 and Marcus Smart nailing a tying 3 within the final minute of regulation. But there\u2019s a reason Kerr set a record, and it\u2019s blending this talent every step of the way. They\u2019ve now ripped off a winning streak of at least 10 games in each of the past six seasons, matching an NBA record held by the San Antonio Spurs (2010-16). Also, remember how we all wondered exactly how DeMarcus Cousins would fit into the Warriors offense? No? Me either. Boogie finished with 15 points, eight rebounds, three assists and three steals in 23 foul-plagued minutes. Goodness. That squad is trouble. This we knew. Of this we are reminded. Kerr wasn\u2019t the only coach out here setting records. The NBA\u2019s reigning coaching dean, Gregg Popovich, claimed space \u2013 also from Riley \u2013 as the career coaching leader in road victories after a 126-114 romp over the New Orleans Pelicans. Out in Denver, the Nuggets hosted a shorthanded Sixers squad playing without all three frontcourt starters , and it was off to the races \u2026 for everybody. The teams combined for 78 points in the first quarter and more than 140 at the half. This Gary Harris break preeeeeeetty much sums it all up: Beyond that, the rolling scoreboard set up Nikola Jokic to do his all-everything deal and rack up a 32-point, 18-rebound, 10-assist triple-double. Just a day in the work for an #NBATwitter favorite . Also, if you blinked at the end of the third, you might have missed the rarest of NBA sights: Ben Simmons\u2019 first 3-point attempt of the 2018-19 season (and just the 12th since his 2017 debut). Do we applaud him for putting the attempt on the scoresheet? Or throw a #smh out there for wasting a Mewtwo-level rarity on this low-percentage heave? \u00af_(\u30c4)_\/\u00af We finally heard from Pacers guard Victor Oladipo since his season-ending injury on Wednesday, who posted a lengthy, emotional note on social media vowing he\u2019d return \u201cbetter than ever.\u201d That confidence is going to be necessary during what will be an arduous recovery . A ruptured quad knocked Charles Barkley quite a ways down the playable pyramid, albeit it near the end of his career, and not rushing the recovery is always tough to balance with an athlete\u2019s aggressive mindset. That said, the NBA family continues to support and acknowledge Oladipo in ways big and small, with Warriors guard Quinn Cook \u2013 a high school teammate \u2013 penning a visible tribute on his kicks for Saturday\u2019s game in Boston. Thought you blew by Myles Turner, did you, Justin Holiday? Nope. That said, Memphis pulled out a 106-103 victory , and for all the recent hullabaloo , stars Marc Gasol and Mike Conley were clearly enjoying the sweeter spoils ."},{"id":36053,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/reports-jimmy-butler-out-sprained-wrist","date":"2019-01-27","title":"Reports: Butler confirms wrist sprain, out Saturday","content":" The Philadelphia 76ers, already planning to rest center Joel Embiid in Saturday\u2019s game against the Nuggets, found out Saturday they\u2019ll be without swingman Jimmy Butler after a specialist confirmed the star Sixer has a sprained wrist.

It finally happened. The gates to the kingdom have opened, putting everyone on equal footing in hopes of snatching the elusive crown. With the King falling into the field, everyone drops back by default, but that doesn\u2019t mean their play has suffered. The big man in San Antonio, for instance, is gaining serious traction in his trek to the top of the mountain. Staying in the River City, a pair of veterans have joined the chase after productive stints. The same can\u2019t be said for DeMarre Carroll, Jeff Green and Gerald Green, who all fall off the list after the briefest of stints. 1. LeBron James (34), Los Angeles Lakers Previous rank: ATHO Latest stats: Injured Season stats: 27.3 ppg, 8.3 rpg, 7.1 apg Fourteen. That\u2019s the number of games you are allowed to miss before being placed back among the masses. If this keeps up, the guy below may have enough juice to do the unimaginable and trek to the top of the mountain. But we\u2019re thinking James returns by mid week and order is quickly restored. Right? 2. LaMarcus Aldridge (33), San Antonio Spurs Previous rank: 1 Latest stats: 6 games, 20.2 ppg, 8.5 rpg, 3.3 apg Season stats: 20.6 ppg, 8.6 rpg, 2.5 apg We\u2019ve stated in the past that one game can prevent you from sliding down. Well, Aldridge certainly made sure of that with his 56-point performance on January 10. Adding to that, he pocketed three additional games of 25 or more points while shooting 51.6 percent from the field and averaging 1.8 blocks during the six-game stretch. 3. Lou Williams (32), LA Clippers Previous rank: 2 Latest stats: 5 games, 18.2 ppg, 3.8 rpg, 4.8 apg Season stats: 18.5 ppg, 2.8 rpg, 4.9 apg Williams has slowed a tad, eclipsing 20 points just twice in the last five after surpassing the mark six times in nine games. The biggest culprit has been shooting. After managing 50.0 FG% and 51.7 3PT% in 11 December games, Williams has slipped to 43.5 FG% and 33.3 3PT% in January. Note: Williams\u2019 triple-double Friday missed the cutoff, so that goes toward next edition. 4. J.J. Redick (34), Philadelphia 76ers Previous rank: 3 Latest stats: 7 games, 19.1 ppg, 2.0 rpg, 2.4 apg Season stats: 18.4 ppg, 2.2 rpg, 2.8 apg Let\u2019s get the somewhat ugly out of the way first: 43.8 FG% and 39.7 3PT% in the last seven games. On the positive ledger, he\u2019s still managed to score in double figures in all 47 games and is still averaging a career-best 18.4 points. For good measure, he\u2019s making a career-high three 3-pointers per game. 5. Marc Gasol (33), Memphis Grizzlies Previous rank: 4 Latest stats: 6 games, 13.7 ppg, 8.7 rpg, 7.0 apg Season stats: 15.4 ppg, 8.7 rpg, 4.8 apg Let\u2019s again return to that \u201cOne game can save you\u201d theory. We were ready to drop Gasol down at least one notch, and then he decided to turn in his first triple-double since Jan. 26, 2018. Before that gem, Gasol had combined for just 60 points in five games. We\u2019re guessing the easy way to ignite Gasol is to put him on the trade block. 6. Kyle Lowry (32), Toronto Raptors Previous rank: 5 Latest stats: 7 games, 13.3 ppg, 5.0 rpg, 8.1 apg Season stats: 14.2 ppg, 4.5 rpg, 9.4 apg The shooting remains off (34.2 FG%, 29.2 3PT%), but he\u2019s scored in double figures in six straight while connecting on three or more 3-pointers in the last two. He\u2019s also chipped in seven or more assists in seven consecutive games, keeping his season average at 9.4 assists, easily a career best. 7. Marco Belinelli (32), San Antonio Spurs Previous rank: NA Latest stats: 5 games, 17.6 ppg, 2.4 rpg, 2.0 apg Season stats: 10.9 ppg, 2.3 rpg, 1.9 apg Averaging just 25.9 minutes while shooting 50.9 FG% and 44.4 3PT%, Belinelli has scored a dozen or more points in seven straight while nailing at least three 3s in five of the six. Since the calendar flipped to 2019, Belinelli has been locked in, averaging 14.6 compared to 9.1 in November and 10.3 in December. 8. Rudy Gay (32), San Antonio Spurs Previous rank: NA Latest stats: 4 games, 18.0 ppg, 5.0 rpg, 2.5 apg Season stats: 14.0 ppg, 6.4 rpg, 2.4 apg Gay has shown consistency no matter the team result. In two wins, he averaged 18.0 points, 4.0 rebounds and 60.0 FG%. In two losses, Gay averaged 18.0 points, 6.0 rebounds and 69.6 FG%. After missing five games with a wrist injury, Gay seems to be back in a groove, which is welcome news to the Spurs. 9. Trevor Ariza (32), Washington Wizards Previous rank: Just missed Latest stats: 5 games, 20.4 ppg, 6.8 rpg, 5.4 apg Season stats: 12.1 ppg, 5.8 rpg, 3.8 apg The change of scenery from Phoenix to Washington continues to work wonders for Ariza, who is averaging 15.4 with the Wizards compared to just 9.9 when he was with the Suns. That tends to happen when you get about five more shot attempts per game. No wonder he\u2019s gone for 20 or more points in four of the last five. 10. Al Horford (32), Boston Celtics Previous rank: NA Latest stats: 6 games, 14.8 ppg, 7.3 rpg, 2.3 apg Season stats: 12.2 ppg, 6.4 rpg, 3.6 apg He\u2019s scored in double figures in four straight, including a season-high 24 on Wednesday against the Raptors. Horford also pulled down a season-high 12 rebounds in Monday\u2019s win over the Heat. Equally impressive is that he shot 62.7 from the field and 42.9 from deep in the last six games.

Such was the case for the red-hot James Harden, who is still averaging 44.4 points in January and extended his streak of games with at least 30 points to 22 as the Houston Rockets held off the Toronto Raptors 121-119 . It wasn\u2019t the best shooting performance for the Rockets All-Star starter. He shot 2-of-13 from beyond the arc, but supplemented his scoring at the free throw line by draining all 15 attempts. A balanced effort propelled Houston to victory. Every starter reached double figures, and the Rockets outscored the Raptors by 10 points when Harden was on the bench, an anomaly to their -31 total with Harden off the court this season. While all-around production helped the Rockets win their first consecutive games in 2019, it was the Kia MVP frontrunner who continued his assault on the record books. Here\u2019s the latest on Harden\u2019s astronomical pace:  The Milwaukee Bucks trailed for majority of Friday\u2019s contest against the Charlotte Hornets and faced a double-digit deficit entering the fourth quarter. That\u2019s when All-Star captain Giannis Antetokounmpo had enough. Rebounding from a massive Shaqtin\u2019 moment in the first half (see below), Antetokounmpo was locked in during the final quarter and outscored the entire Charlotte team 14-12 . Each of those 14 points came inside the paint as the generational talent got to the rim with ease, lifting Milwaukee to its sixth straight victory .  PJ Tucker and Eric Gordon have some weird inbounds chemistry. Earlier this week, Tucker made Shaqtin\u2019 A Fool for his bizarre refusal to touch the ball on Gordon\u2019s inbounds pass late in the fourth. With less than two minutes to go in Friday\u2019s game, Gordon was on the receiving end of Tucker\u2019s pass and, well, this happened: Gordon went on to make another inbounds error with 35.9 seconds left and the game within five points, stepping out after retrieving the inbounds pass (this time from Faried): An idea: Maybe the Rockets should just let Harden inbounds to himself? Meanwhile in Milwaukee, when you see Giannis Antetokounmpo on a fastbreak, you\u2019re bound to see something special. Just not this time. Donovan Mitchell grew up with dreams of being a professional baseball player. But after suffering a broken wrist in high school while playing the sport, Mitchell turned his sole focus to basketball and his pitching days took a back seat. As you can see, however, he definitely hasn\u2019t lost his fastball.  It\u2019s never too late to add something new to your hoops resume. Lou Williams registered the first triple-double of his career, totaling 31 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists in the LA Clippers\u2019 106-101 triumph over the Chicago Bulls. Williams, 32, became the first player in more than two decades to log a triple-double off the bench and did it in his 904th career game. Two players got their first NBA points at the free throw line late in their respective games, and the best part was watching their respective team benches erupt.

Walker was injured in the closing minutes of the fourth quarter, during a scramble for a loose ball. Giannis Antetokounmpo blocked Michael Kidd-Gilchrist\u2019s attempt near the rim, and Walker and Eric Bledsoe dove to gain possession, with Antetokounmpo and Kidd-Gilchrist entering the fray. Walker and Antetokounmpo collided, and the Bucks forward then rolled over Walker, who remained on the ground holding his neck until being examined by a trainer. He eventually rose and walked off on his own, though he didn\u2019t return to the game, finishing with 10 points (3-12 FGs), 8 rebounds and 5 assists.

On Thursday, guard Chris Paul was listed as questionable for tonight\u2019s game against the Toronto Raptors. However, he will not be suiting up tonight. It\u2019s not all bad news for Houston fans, though, as coach Mike D\u2019Antoni told reporters during today\u2019s shootaround that he expects Paul will play Sunday when the Rockets host the Orlando Magic ( 7 ET, NBA League Pass ). \u201cIt looks like Sunday, not tonight, probably,\u201d D\u2019Antoni told reporters Friday. \u201cI think he\u2019s ready to go, we\u2019re just being extra careful and Sunday seems to be a good day. \u201cIf it was a playoff game tonight, he might go.

Much of that success is due to Harden, who has scored 30 or more points in 21 straight games, including a 61-point effort against the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden last night. Including playoffs, the Rockets are 77-22 when Paul plays. An injury to his other hamstring kept him out of the last two games of the Western Conference finals last season.

Surely someone would have eventually noticed the considerable skills of Morant. The 6-foot-3 sophomore guard \u2014 who\u2019s now stars for Murray State \u2014 leads the nation in assists per game (10.7) by a huge margin. He\u2019s averaging 24.1 points and almost 5.8 rebounds per game, blowing up YouTube with an eye-popping array of acrobatic dunks, all while being seriously considered as both a national player of the year candidate and an NBA lottery pick. Back in 2016, Morant was just another overlooked prospect who lived in the country (Dalzell, S.C.), didn\u2019t play for an AAU team backed by a major shoe company and didn\u2019t even use social media. He was a textbook example of a sleeper \u2014 until Kane asked someone at the combine where the concession stand was. On his way there, he heard a basketball bouncing in a side gym, far from the main action. Curious, he looked inside. There Kane first laid eyes on Morant, who was playing in a game of three-on-three. After watching for five minutes, during which Morant\u2019s 44-inch vertical leap, quickness and uncanny passing eye were on full display, Kane forgot about his hunger pangs and dashed off to call Murray State coach Matt McMahon. \u201cHe said, \u2018this kid\u2019s gonna be a pro,\u2019 \u201d McMahon says. \u201cSo I jumped in the car and got up there the next day. We tracked him all through July.\u201d Murray State\u2019s coaches quickly built a relationship with Morant\u2019s close-knit family and then sat back and hoped no other recruiters would notice what Kane saw. By the end of July, Morant committed to Murray State, intrigued by the possibility of following former Racer point guards Isaiah Canaan and Cameron Payne \u2014 both of whom made it to the NBA \u2014 and playing alongside senior Jonathan Stark, who had averaged 22 points and six assists as a junior. Only after announcing his decision did Morant start getting flooded with offers, but by then it was too late. \u201cI decided to set official visits to Murray State and South Carolina,\u201d Morant says. \u201cBut once I went to Murray, I knew that\u2019s where I needed to be. The point guard tradition played a part, but not as much as the community \u2014 I felt like everybody, from the players to the coaches to the fans, were like a family. I\u2019m a big family guy. Everybody in the community loves the team.\u201d Another lure was Murray State\u2019s up-tempo offense, which gives breathing room to point guards with the talent to make plays. Morant fits in perfectly, and although his turnover rate is high, McMahon isn\u2019t about to shackle him. \u201cI want him to play with all the creativity and freedom and confidence he can,\u201d McMahon says. \u201c[In games from Jan. 17-24] he made 11 turnovers, but he had 32 assists. That\u2019s a 3-1 assist-to-turnover ratio. I\u2019ll take that any day of the week.\u201d Morant\u2019s assists are of the spectacular variety, like the half-court, one-handed lob for a dunk he threw to Brion Sanchious for a dunk in a recent game against Belmont. Thirty-three NBA scouts were there, and though Morant turned an ankle early in the game, in his diminished state he still delivered 20 points and nine assists . Those scouts already know what Morant can do when he\u2019s healthy. He\u2019s racked up a collection of impressive performances this season, leaving opposing coaches search for the right comparison. After Morant torched Alabama for 38 points, nine rebounds and five assists , Crimson Tide coach and former NBA point guard Avery Johnson reached back into his past. \u201cI saw flashbacks of a lot of guys I played against,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWhether it\u2019s the old Isaiah Thomas \u2014 the Detroit Pistons\u2019 Isaiah Thomas \u2014 that craftiness and cleverness. John Stockton\u2019s passing ability. Russell Westbrook\u2019s athletic ability. My God. When I saw him on film \u2026 to watch him play in person \u2026 it was better than on film. We gave him about five or six different looks. Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn\u2019t.\u201d Missouri State coach Dana Ford saw plenty of Murray State when he was coach at Tennessee State. That didn\u2019t stop him from scheduling the Racers in his first season in Springfield. Morant delivered a 29-point, 13-rebound, 12-assist triple-double . \u201cI coached against all three [Canaan, Payne, Morant],\u201d Ford says. \u201cHe is by far the best NBA prospect of the three. He is so fast and athletic \u2026 a blur. He is a Kansas type of guard \u2026 long [limbed] and competitive. He sees the play before it develops. He\u2019s turnover prone, but that\u2019s correctable. He\u2019s a little bit of John Wall mixed with Chris Paul. He\u2019s special.\u201d Middle Tennessee coach Nick McDevitt sees traits of Westbrook in Morant, fitting because the Thunder\u2019s triple-double machine is Morant\u2019s hero. Morant didn\u2019t produce great numbers (nine points, seven assists, three rebounds) in a 64-42 win over MTSU \u2014 he didn\u2019t need to \u2014 but McDevitt saw plenty, on the court and in film scouting before the game. \u201cHe has speed, and you can\u2019t teach that,\u201d McDevitt says. \u201cCertain guys are a one-man fast break that can turn negative numbers into positive numbers for your team in a hurry. That always puts pressure on the defense. At this level anyway, it keeps you from being very aggressive on the offensive glass, because once they get it, and once he gets it, he will run by everybody you have. \u201cThat\u2019s what Westbrook figured out a long time ago. Just go get the ball. Get a defensive rebound and outrun everybody. Some guys, like Ty Lawson, he had that speed, but he couldn\u2019t go get the ball. Somebody else had to get it for him. Guys like Westbrook, and Morant \u2014 which he\u2019s shown he can do at this level \u2014 Morant can go get it himself and then he\u2019s gone. If you don\u2019t have guys back, he\u2019s gonna go shoot layups.\u201d Or more often dunks that must be watched repeatedly to be believed , like the one Morant pulled off against UT Martin earlier this month. Morant, in the left corner, snuck back door on his defender and received a perfect bounce pass from Tevin Brown as the Racers\u2019 6-foot-8 Quinton Dove moved in front to take the charge. Morant took one step, then another and launched himself over Dove for a two-handed slam . Stunning doesn\u2019t begin to describe it. Scary \u2026 that\u2019s the word. \u201cYou think you\u2019ve seen it all, and then he does something like that,\u201d McMahon said. \u201cI turned and looked into the stands and people were running up and down the aisles. The noise after the dunk was deafening. I saw a lot of shocked looks. Fortunately, there were some great camera people there in the right place at the right time.\u201d Morant laughs at the recollection. To the man who spent hours training with his father \u2014 often repeatedly jumping on top of old tires from an 18-wheeler \u2014 that dunk was just what he does. \u201cI saw the defender move over to try and take the charge,\u201d Morant says. \u201cMy mindset was just go finish the play.\u201d Morant gets a charge out of moments like that, but his favorite play in basketball is the assist. \u201cI love making my teammates\u2019 jobs easier,\u201d Morant says, \u201cputting them in spots where they can score. Just to see them with smiles on their faces, giving them confidence \u2014 that makes me feel much better than scoring the ball.\u201d McMahon has coached Morant for two seasons and never ceases to be amazed. But not necessarily by Morant\u2019s physical gifts. \u201cEveryone talks about his freakish athleticism, his explosiveness, his change of speed,\u201d McMahon says. \u201cThat\u2019s all very accurate. He\u2019s elite in those categories. But now you combine that with a guy who has an unbelievable IQ, feel for the game and vision. To me, he\u2019s a basketball genius. Now you combine that with high character and work ethic. He\u2019s all about the team and making everyone around him better. \u201cThose are the ingredients of a once-in-a-lifetime player.

The Western Conference was too stacked with frontcourt talent. And Paul took fire from all directions after he opted to re-sign with the Oklahoma City Thunder last summer instead of joining other potential suitors. There wasn\u2019t going to be enough All-Star oxygen in OKC for both George and triple-double machine (and 2017 Kia MVP) Russell Westbrook, they said. But it turns out there\u2019s more than enough shine to go around. George\u2019s decision to stick with what he and Westbrook started building in their first season together has worked out brilliantly for all involved. He\u2019s an All-Star starter in the Western Conference , as was revealed Thursday , and also a solid MVP candidate himself in what\u2019s turning out to be his finest NBA season. \u201cWhen I got traded here, it was almost (like) people thought it was gonna be the end of me being an All-Star, coming out the West,\u201d George told reporters after dropping 23 points, 11 rebounds and seven assists in a win against the New Orleans Pelicans last night. \u201cBut God is good.\u201d George recently talked about his comfort level, on and off the court , in Oklahoma City. He said he\u2019s at peace with his life, his game and his place in the league as one of its elite players. His comfort level shows in his play, too. He\u2019s notching career highs in scoring (27 points per game) and rebounding (7.9 rpg) to go along with 4.1 assists per game and 2.3 steals per game ( second on the team to Westbrook ). \u201cIt just feels honestly, man, like everything has slowed down at this stage of my career,\u201d George said. \u201cAll the years I\u2019ve been in this league, it\u2019s like \u2026 say a kid is being taught algebra. And he\u2019s got all of these math problems going on. And everything, I\u2019m just pulling from it and grabbing it and I can see through concepts and understand what\u2019s going on out there. It\u2019s a fun way to play, when there aren\u2019t any crazy surprises that anyone can throw at you. * * * The top five this week in the 2018-19 Kia Race to the MVP Ladder: * * * Last week:  No. 1 Season stats:  36.3 points, 8.3 assists, 6.6 rebounds, 2.1 steals If you were wondering just how out of hand things have gotten since Harden\u2019s franchise-record, NBA season-high and career-best 61-point outburst at Madison Square Garden Wednesday night, consider that he\u2019s averaging an absolutely filthy 52.2 points, 9.4 rebounds, 4.2 assists and 2.6 steals in his past five games. And the Rockets need all of what he provides as they try to keep the pace in the Western Conference with several critical players unavailable right now. Harden\u2019s streak of consecutive games scoring 30 or more points is at 21 (and counting), the fourth-longest streak in league history behind three different Wilt Chamberlain runs of 30 or more points. Harden tied Kobe Bryant\u2019s record for an opponent scoring high at Madison Square Garden, coming up a point short of Carmelo Anthony\u2019s scoring record . He also saved the Rockets late, with a steal and dunk to seal the win . Before the game, Harden was hunting for the kind of \u201cGarden moment\u201d he ended up enjoying. The Rockets need him to keep it all up for the foreseeable future. Last week:  No. 2 Season stats:  26.5 points, 12.6 rebounds, 5.9 assists, 1.4 blocks, 1.3 steals Antetokounmpo and the Bucks are riding the wave of a five-game win streak into tonight\u2019s home game against the Charlotte Hornets ( 8:30 ET, NBA League Pass ). Antetokounmpo has been tremendous during the streak, averaging 25.6 points on .558 percent shooting during victories against Atlanta, Miami, Memphis, Orlando and Dallas. The schedule cranks up a bit after Friday, with stops in Oklahoma City ( Sunday at 6 ET, ESPN ), Detroit ( Tuesday at 7 ET, NBA League Pass ), Toronto ( Thursday at 8 ET, TNT ), Washington ( Feb. 2 at 7 ET, NBA League Pass ) and Brooklyn ( Feb. 4 at 7:30 ET, NBA TV ). As good overall as the Bucks have been, they are vulnerable on the road (where they\u2019ve suffered eight of their 12 losses this season). Antetokounmpo is the one outlier, with numbers that are nearly identical at home and on the road. The Bucks need him at his dominant best during this upcoming stretch. Last week:  No. 3 Season stats:  29.5 points, 5.5 assists, 5.2 rebounds, 1.2 steals The Warriors have rolled up nine straight wins and show no signs of struggling with adding DeMarcus Cousins into the mix. Curry continues to show why he is one of the most resilient performers in the game, bouncing back with a monster 38-point game Thursday (on 14-for-24 shooting) after a brutal 11-point effort (on 3-for-12 for shooting) Monday against the Los Angeles Lakers. It\u2019s no stretch to think James Harden will win Western Conference Player of the Month honors for January. But Curry would be a lock most any other time with the work he\u2019s put in to open 2019 (31.6 ppg, 5.1 rpg, 6.1 apg on 50.2 percent shooting and 42.6 percent on 3-pointers). Warriors coach Steve Kerr showed prudence in allowing Curry back into the rotation from that groin injury earlier this season. Curry looks as fresh as he has in quite some time. He\u2019s feeling so frisky that he\u2019s even thinking about working on his above-the-rim skills during games (see his Shaqtin\u2019 moment against the Lakers ). Jokes aside, Curry is soaring and it couldn\u2019t come at a better time for the Warriors. Last week:  No. 5 Season stats:  27.2 points, 13.3 rebounds, 3.5 assists, 2.0 blocks Is there any player in the league having more fun competing these days than Embiid? He pushed through lower back tightness to ensure that he played in the past week\u2019s statement games against the Oklahoma City Thunder , Houston Rockets and San Antonio Spurs . Embiid torched each of those foes for 30 or more points and has scored 30 or more in four of his past five games . He was often been the most dominant player in each of those games, be it on offense or with his rebounding and shot-blocking on defense. Embiid\u2019s personal dust ups with both Russell Westbrook (in a loss) and James Harden (in a Martin Luther King Jr. Day win) overshadowed how Embiid wore out his big man counterparts in OKC and Houston. He saved plenty for the Spurs on Wednesday , finishing with 33 points, 19 rebounds, three assists and a block. The Sixers are drafting off Embiid, who has an NBA-best 21 games with 30 or more points and 10 or more rebounds. Philadelphia has won five of its last six games and is within a game of the No. 3-seeded Indiana Pacers . Last week:  No. 7 Season stats:  26.9 points, 8.0 rebounds, 4.0 assists, 2.3 steals Not that he needed validation, but George\u2019s decision to re-sign with Oklahoma City last summer is looking better by the day. He had his moxie questioned by those who felt he shied away from the challenge of playing in Los Angeles, where he would have starred alongside LeBron James (and whoever else the Lakers would have signed). But would he have been as perfect a fit in L.A. as he is in OKC? We\u2019ll never know. And George shouldn\u2019t even entertain that discussion after how he\u2019s playing this season. He\u2019s been every bit as critical as Russell Westbrook to the Thunder\u2019s rebound from their early-season hiccups and 0-4 start. George\u2019s game-after-game brilliance has the Thunder looking capable of challenging the Golden State Warriors in ways perhaps no other West team can. The Thunder\u2019s defensive prowess, led by George, is what sets them apart from other challengers. And you better believe George will relish the opportunity to embrace that challenge \u2013 should it happen months from now. * * * 6. Nikola Jokic, Denver Nuggets 7. Kawhi Leonard, Toronto Raptors 8.

The Pelicans made the announcement after an MRI taken Thursday confirmed the initial diagnosis. Mirotic, who averages 16.7 points and 8.3 rebounds per game, suffered the injury Wednesday night against Detroit. He missed Thursday night\u2019s game at Oklahoma City. The Pelicans already were without star center Anthony Davis, who missed his third straight game with a left index finger sprain."},{"id":36156,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/about-last-night-1-24-19","date":"2019-01-25","title":"About Last Night: Westbrook's exclusive club","content":"The statistical anomaly attention is squarely on James Harden. And yet, Russell Westbrook is out in these NBA streets, mired in a season-long shooting slump and still putting up triple-doubles with aplomb. Westbrook dropped 23 points, 16 rebounds and 17 assists in a 122-116 win over the New Orleans Pelicans on Thursday. That marks the third 20-15-15 Westbrook has submitted this season, the most in a single campaign since Wilt Chamberlain posted four in 1967-68. With four now on the career log, Westbrook trails only Wilt (6) and Oscar Robertson (14). He is, for the third consecutive season, averaging a triple-double: this time, 21.9 points, 10.8 rebounds, 10.7 assists. With the starters released , the competition out West means an All-Star nod isn\u2019t quite the gimme lock it\u2019s been since 2011. Perhaps we\u2019ve been taking this run for granted, and that potential absence \u2014 stunning to consider \u2014 would mark the moment we know. For Westbrook, a snub would likely serve as more fuel for the ever-consuming competitive fire that has driven this ahistorical statistical success. The schedule reveals a match in Miami on Friday, Feb. 1 \u2013 the day after the reserve roster is announced. Not sure I\u2019d like to be lining up across the court, especially if Westbrook is ready to avenge (or justify!) that decision. Will definitely want to watch with the rest of #NBATwitter though. Though the Phoenix Suns again took it on the nose, this time in a 120-106 loss to the Blazers on Thursday, guard Devin Booker stamped his name in the record books. With a midrange jumper six minutes into game No. 245, Booker became the fifth-youngest player to reach 5,000 career points. He finished with 27 on the night, shooting 9-of-20 from the field and 7-of-8 at the line, dishing out three assists to eight turnovers. After taking an L \u2014 Phoenix\u2019s 39th of the season, against 11 wins \u2014 Booker downplayed the accomplishment: \u201cI\u2019m just at a point in my career where I just want to be a winner,\u201d he said, per Suns.com . \u201cI\u2019ve done the individual accolades countless of numbers of times. So for me, it\u2019s figuring out how to win and we\u2019re not doing that right now. So, until we start winning, that\u2019s when all those things will matter to me.\u201d YOUNGEST TO SCORE 5,000 POINTS Hornets guard Kemba Walker earned his third All-Star appearance on Thursday, but his first as a starter, an achievement all the more memorable because he\u2019ll be playing in front of the Charlotte fans he\u2019s dazzled for a career. In a special message posted to the Hornets Twitter feed, Walker thanked the Hornets fanbase for believing in him throughout these seven-plus seasons, cheering Walker on as he developed into one of the league\u2019s most prolific scorers. Prior to Thursday\u2019s 126-118 victory in Washington, Stephen Curry took some time to chop it up with a young fan, who dished a clean assist to cap warmups: Curry went on to tally 38 points, shooting 14-of-24 from the field to lead all scorers. Also in attendance was Wizards guard John Wall, who\u2019s been rehabbing after season-ending heel surgery and was ready to stump for teammate Bradley Beal as an All-Star: After missing 14 games dating to a Christmas Day injury to his right ring finger, Rajon Rondo returned to action for the Lakers, and there were stats (15 points, 6 rebounds, 13 assists) but also there was this: Yup, he\u2019s back.

James Harden, Rockets (7th All-Star selection) The Kia NBA MVP for the 2017-18 season has been an All-Star in each of his seven seasons with Houston, putting him third behind Hakeem Olajuwon (12) and Yao Ming (eight) for the most selections in franchise history. LeBron James, Lakers (15th All-Star selection) With three NBA All-Star MVP awards, the career All-Star scoring leader (343 points) is one shy of the record shared by Bryant and Bob Pettit. Giannis Antetokounmpo, Bucks (3rd All-Star selection) Antetokounmpo, who finished second in fan voting among all NBA players for the second year in a row, has been named a starter for the third consecutive season. Joel Embiid, 76ers (2nd All-Star selection) A starter for the second straight year, Embiid scored 19 points for Team Curry in his All-Star Game debut last season.

Reserve guard Brandon Knight \u2014 who appeared in 12 games this season \u2014 has also been upgraded to questionable.

Much of that success is due to Harden, who has scored 30 or more points in 21 straight games, including a 61-point effort against the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden last night. Including playoffs, the Rockets are 77-22 when Paul plays. An injury to his other hamstring kept him out of the last two games of the Western Conference finals last season. Paul missed two games early this season because of a suspension for his role in a fight with the Lakers and sat out three games in November with a sore hamstring.

No replays were shown on the video screen that stretches from free-throw line to free-throw line, and fans began chanting Oladipo\u2019s name. (The Pacers eventually won the game, 110-106 .) Coach Nate McMillan said he was unsure when Oladipo would have surgery or whether he would be ready for the start of next season. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate. He\u2019s a special player and a special person,\u201d McMillan said Thursday. \u201cIt will be tough but we have to continue to move on.\u201d Concerned reactions \u2014 from the hometown fans, players on the court and those watching from afar \u2014 quickly began pouring in . The sixth-year guard eventually left the court on a stretcher, raising his arms to acknowledge the crowd. Former Pacers star Paul George, who suffered a catastrophic leg injury while training with Team USA in 2014, chimed in with a show of support via Twitter . \u201cWe kind of knew last night [about Oladipo\u2019s injury],\u201d McMillan said. \u201cBut we got the word this morning.\u201d McMillan said Tyreke Evans will replace Oladipo in the starting lineup and first-round draft pick Aaron Holiday will get more playing time off the bench. In addition, the Pacers intend to promote Edmond Sumner from the NBA G League to the playing roster. They could still make a move before the Feb. 7 trade deadline. \u201cWe will talk about that,\u201d McMillan said. \u201cWe will talk about where we go from here.\u201d This season, Oladipo was averaging 18.8 points, 5.6 rebounds, 5.2 assists and 1.7 steals in 31.9 minutes. He ranks third in the NBA this season in clutch points with 5.1 ppg , was named Eastern Conference Player of the Week for Week 3 (Oct. 29-Nov. 4) and was an All-Star last season. Entering last night\u2019s game, he had led the team in scoring 17 times this season \u2014 the most on the Pacers. Losing Oladipo is an enormous blow to the Pacers\u2019 postseason hopes. Indiana currently holds the No. 3 seed in the Eastern Conference but the Pacers face a more challenging second half of the season. They surprised the league last year when many projected them to be a lottery team after trading George to Oklahoma City for Oladipo and Domantas Sabonis. Instead, the Pacers made the playoffs as one of the season\u2019s biggest surprises. Oladipo\u2019s teammates are convinced they can do it again. \u201cThe season\u2019s not over,\u201d Collison said a few minutes after players were told the extent of Oladipo\u2019s injury. \u201cThey don\u2019t know our mindset in the locker room. They don\u2019t know what we have.\u201d Indiana went 7-4 when Oladipo missed 11 games earlier this season with a sore right knee. McMillan said he had not been told whether the previous knee problem had any relationship to the new injury. \u201cI haven\u2019t talked to the trainers about it, but he wasn\u2019t complaining before last night,\u201d McMillan said, though Oladipo appeared to be favoring the knee as recently as last week. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to come together and play inspired basketball,\u201d said Myles Turner, who had 13 points and 10 rebounds last night. \u201cWe can\u2019t let this get us stuck in the mud. It\u2019s emotional, but we have to overcome it and play.\u201d Each of Oladipo\u2019s former teams, the Oklahoma City Thunder ( who traded Oladipo in the 2017 deal for George) and the Orlando Magic (who drafted him No. 2 overall in 2013 ), expressed messages of support: Information from The Associated Press was used in this report.

After what was a seemingly sluggish first half of the season, the Warriors have won eight straight games and sit in first place in the Western Conference . A win in Washington on Thursday would give them the league\u2019s longest winning streak this season. The Warriors have yet to really turn it up defensively. They rank 14th on that end of the floor overall (having allowed a league-average 109.9 points per 100 possessions) and 19th in January (111.2), even with the eight-game winning streak. But the Golden State offense has been better than ever. The Warriors have scored an incredible 126.7 points per 100 possessions over their last 10 games , the best stretch of offense they\u2019ve had in five seasons under coach Steve Kerr. (Prior to this season, their 10-game high was 122.2 points scored per 100 possessions.) Here\u2019s one number to know about the 2018-19 Warriors as they look to extend their winning streak \u2026 The Warriors have taken 61 percent of their shots from outside the paint. That is the highest rate in the league. Four years ago, Charles Barkley said \u2014 in reference to the Warriors \u2014 that a jump-shooting team couldn\u2019t win a championship. He was wrong, of course . He was wrong about the Warriors being that much of a jump-shooting team, first of all. In the 2014-15 season, the Warriors took only 54 percent of their shots from outside the paint. That was the 13th-highest rate in what turned out to be this core\u2019s first championship season. The Warriors were obviously a great shooting team, but they also leveraged their shooting to get layups and dunks. Only one team averaged more points per game in the restricted area than the Warriors that season, when the real jump-shooting team was the LA Clippers, who took 62 percent of their shots from outside the paint. But every season since, the Warriors have gradually become more of a jump-shooting team, seeing an increase in the percentage of their shots that have come from outside the paint. This season, the champs have been outscored by 7.3 points in the paint per game, the league\u2019s third-biggest discrepancy. They\u2019re also in the bottom 10 in regard point differential on free throws (minus-1.5 per game). League-wide, shots in the paint are worth more (1.11 points per attempt) than shots from outside the paint (0.98), even when you take the extra value of 3-pointers into account. Obviously, within those basic boundaries, restricted area shots are worth more than other shots in the paint and 3-pointers are worth more than mid-range shots. But over the last two seasons, the Warriors\u2019 jump shots have also been more likely to come from inside the arc than they were the two seasons prior. The league as a whole has taken 2.2 times as many 3-pointers as mid-range shots this season, up from 1.0 in 2014-15, the first season when the league took more 3-pointers than mid-range shots. The Warriors\u2019 ratio of 3-point attempts to mid-range attempts that season was 1.3, the league\u2019s sixth-highest mark. It climbed to 1.9 (second) the following season and stayed relatively high (1.8 \u2013 seventh highest) in 2016-17, Kevin Durant\u2019s first season with the team. But it dropped last season and the Warriors\u2019 ratio of 1.5 this season is the fourth-lowest in the league. While other teams are extremely disciplined about not taking long 2-point shots (to the point of penalizing players for taking them in scrimmages), the Warriors launch from mid-range without hesitation. Only the Spurs, led by mid-range monsters LaMarcus Aldridge and DeMar DeRozan, have attempted more mid-range shots than the Warriors , who have taken about five times as many mid-range shots as the Houston Rockets. Kevin Durant (311) and Klay Thompson (310) are two of 10 players who have attempted more mid-range shots than the Rockets (208) this season. So in regard to having a analytics-friendly shot chart, the Warriors are near the bottom of the league. And it hasn\u2019t mattered. This season, with all the jump shots, the Warriors have scored 115.6 points per 100 possessions . That makes them the most efficient offensive team of the 23 years for which we have play-by-play data. The Warriors rank 11th in turnover rate , a big improvement from last season, when they ranked 25th . But they also rank 25th in free throw rate and 20th in offensive rebounding percentage . They have the best offense we\u2019ve ever seen almost exclusively because they\u2019ve shot so well and have given themselves more opportunities to shoot by not turning the ball over so much. The Warriors rank second in field goal percentage in the paint, first in mid-range field goal percentage and second in 3-point percentage . No other team ranks in the top five in all three. Durant (74.4 percent) and Thompson (72.1 percent) have been two of the league\u2019s best finishers in the restricted area among non-bigs. Stephen Curry ranks third in field goal percentage on non-restricted-area paint shots (minimum 50 FGA). Durant has been the league\u2019s best mid-range shooter . And Curry ranks fifth in 3-point percentage (having attempted a lot more 3-pointers than anyone else in the top 25 ). Both Curry and Thompson have seen an increase in the percentage of their shots that have come from outside the paint since that first championship season. But the biggest change in the Warriors\u2019 shots from four seasons ago has come from their bigs. It\u2019s not about where their bigs\u2019 shots are coming from, but in the number of shots their bigs have been getting. Warriors bigs not named Draymond Green \u2014 Kevon Looney, Jordan Bell, Damian Jones and DeMarcus Cousins \u2014 have attempted just 8.9 shots per game this season, down from 15.4 last season (from the first three guys plus David West, Zaza Pachulia and JaVale McGee) and 18.4 in \u201914-15 (Andrew Bogut, Marreese Speights, etc.). Cousins, of course, has played in just two games thus far. Over his nine seasons in the league, only *six players have scored more points in the paint than Cousins. The percentage of his shots that have come from the paint has **dropped over the last two seasons, and he hasn\u2019t been ***a very good finisher in the restricted area for his size. Still, he gives the Warriors the best paint scorer they\u2019ve had on this five-year run. So, as the season goes on and Cousins plays more minutes, the Warriors should become less of a jump-shooting team. And we\u2019ll see if a more balanced offense (in regard to shot location) is a more efficient one. If so, yikes.

Oladipo had been averaging 18.8 points, 5.6 rebounds, 5.2 assists and 1.7 steals in 31.9 minutes. Per ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski, the Pacers fear the injury could be season-ending . Here\u2019s more from Wojnarowski on the injury Oladipo suffered: \u201c\u2018I didn\u2019t see what happened,\u201d Siakam said after Wednesday\u2019s game. \u201cWatching the replay, he stuck his leg while he was falling. That\u2019s when he hit me. It\u2019s just an unfortunate situation. It\u2019s really scary, it\u2019s tough.\u201d The Pacers ended up defeating the Raptors, 110-106 , behind Thaddeus Young (23 points and 15 rebounds) and Darren Collison (16 points). Losing Oladipo would be an enormous blow to the Pacers\u2019 playoff hopes. But after going 0-6 without Oladipo last season, the Pacers went 7-4 without their best player as he recovered from a sore right knee in November and December.

Kings coach Dave Joerger has been reluctant to give his prized pick big minutes early in the season, opting instead to roll with veteran Nemanja Bjelica and bring Bagley off the bench. But with Bjelica nursing a sore back Tuesday night, Bagley got the first start of his career and showed he may be ready for an increased role. The forward from Duke scored 22 points on 10-for-20 shooting, grabbed 11 rebounds and blocked two shots in a 120-105 loss to the Raptors. \u201dI\u2019m really impressed with what he\u2019s done with his game,\u201d Joerger said. \u201dThe sky is the limit for Marvin. He\u2019s going to be a heck of a player for us.\u201d At 24-24, the Kings are 10th in the Western Conference , but only two games back of the 8th playoff spot. On the season, Bagley is averaging 12.7 points and 6.4 rebounds in 23.4 minutes per game. The 19-year-old, who also has six double-doubles in 2018-19 , is saying all the right things about his role. \u201cI love playing and being out there,\u201d Bagley told James Ham of NBC Sports Bay Area . \u201cI\u2019ll do whatever I can to help the team win. We came up short tonight, but every game I try and come out and play like it\u2019s my last game.\u201d As the season rolls on and the Kings potentially fade in the tough West, stay tuned to see how Bagley\u2019s role changes. * * * Last week:  No. 1 Doncic had one of the worst shooting weeks of his young career, so it\u2019s no wonder he was in a jersey-tearing mood . In three games, Doncic averaged 14 points, but was just 2-for-18 from 3-point land (11.1 percent) and 30.4 percent overall. He had just the fourth single-digit game of his career ( eight points in a 111-99 loss to the Pacers). Doncic, of course, only played 24 minutes after being ejected in the third quarter for kicking the ball into the stands. Doncic claims he was just trying to juggle the ball, and later got hit with a $10,000 fine . \u201cI wasn\u2019t playing well,\u201d Doncic explained. \u201cFor sure, it was one of the worst games I\u2019ve played this season, so yes, I was frustrated. I didn\u2019t know I would be ejected because there are different rules in Europe.\u201d Doncic followed that with the first triple-double of his career with 18 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists. He became the second-youngest to ever tally a triple-double , just 10 days older than Markelle Fultz, who accomplished it last season.  Last week:  No. 2 Ayton only played two games this week, putting up a big line of 15 points, 17 reounds, two steals and two blocks in a loss to the Raptors, then suffered a sprained ankle in Saturday\u2019s loss to the Hornets . Ayton played just 22 minutes before leaving with the injury. Ayton has been reliable all season, but missed the past two games and will likely miss more time as the Suns will most likely be cautious with their franchise big man. Last week:  Not ranked Bagley jumps into the Top 5 thanks to a solid start to the new year. Bagley returned Jan. 7 after missing 11 games with a bone bruise in his left knee. Since his return, the No. 2 pick has scored in double digits in six of the eight games , averaging 12.8 points and 7.4 rebounds while shooting 50 percent from the floor. Last week:  Not ranked Trier burst onto the scene early this season , but fell out of the Knicks\u2019 rotation when he missed eight games in December with a hamstring injury. Trier returned on Christmas , and this week finally showed glimpses of the early-season scorer that stole New York\u2019s hearts. The undrafted rookie averaged 20 points, six rebounds, 4.7 assists and 1.3 steals in his last three games and nearly helped the Knicks weather James Harden\u2019s 61-point night Wednesday at Madison Square Garden. Trier scored 31 points on 12-for-18 shooting and grabbed 10 rebounds to become the first Knicks rookie to top 30 and 10 since Patrick Ewing in 1985-86. Prior to Wednesday\u2019s incredible outburst, Trier nearly saved the Knicks in London on Jan. 17 . However, his last-second block attempt was ruled a goaltend , giving the Wizards a 101-100 win. Still, coach David Fizdale loved the effort. \u201cIt was almost a game-winning, game-saving block,\u201d Fizdale said. \u201cThat he didn\u2019t give up on the play says a lot about the kid.\u201d Last week:  No. 3 Young had his first single-digit scoring game since Jan. 2 , scoring five points on 1-for-12 shooting (1-for-7 on 3s) in Wednesday\u2019s 121-101 win against the Bulls . Even with his shooting woes, Young still handed out 12 assists and grabbed seven rebounds in the victory. I feel like I say this every week, but after a solid showing last week, Young came down to earth over the last three games, hitting just 3 of 19 3-pointers. Just missed the cut:  Landry Shamet, Philadelphia 76ers Shamet had a nice week, scoring 18 points in a win against the Rockets, then scoring 14 to help the Sixers rally past the Spurs. Over four games this week, Shamet was 11-for-17 from beyond the arc. Shamet only sees about 20 minutes per game, but he\u2019s become a major contributor for the East contenders, making his contributions all the more impressive. Jaren Jackson Jr., Memphis Grizzlies The Grizzlies are listening to offers for Marc Gasol and Mike Conley , which means we might see even more from their young star. Memphis is in a tailspin, but Jackson has scored in double digits in 11 of 12 games in January. In four games this week, the No. 4 pick averaged 17 points on 48 percent shooting (44.4 on 3s). Kevin Huerter, Atlanta Hawks Huerter falls out of the Top 5 this week after missing a pair of games with a sore neck. Huerter is having an impressive month , averaging 15.1 points, 4.1 rebounds and 4.1 assists while seeing his playing time rise to 37.5 minutes per game. Rodions Kurucs, Brooklyn Nets The Nets have won five straight, and although Kurucs has seen his playing time dip, he\u2019s still producing and doing all of the little things. Kurucs scored 13 points with a steal and block Wednesday as Brooklyn beat Orlando to keep its win streak alive. That showing followed a 16-point outing by Kurucs in Monday\u2019s win against the Kings. Josh Okogie, Minnesota Timberwolves The Wolves\u2019 surprise rookie averaged 11.7 points this week , thanks in large part to a career-high 21-point outburst in the Wolves\u2019 118-91 win against the Suns on Tuesday. Okogie was 7-for-11 from the field, hitting 4 of 7 3-pointers and had five rebounds and a pair of steals. * * * ( All stats through Wednesday, Jan. 23 ) Send any qfuestions or comments to my email or find me on Twitter @drewpackham .

Kanter was one of four Knicks who didn\u2019t make it onto the floor; per reports out of New York, Kanter claims to have been told he was starting earlier in the day during a team meeting. \u201cI think what they\u2019re doing to me is pretty messed up because they just told me this morning that I\u2019m starting,\u201d Kanter told reporters, per Steve Popper of Newsday . \u201cCoach said it himself that I\u2019m starting. I come to the game and didn\u2019t even play. I\u2019m trying to be a good teammate here, man. The whole league knows me. I\u2019m always with my teammates, with the organization, that I play for.

Overall, Fizdale has preferred to play the Knicks\u2019 younger players as the team assesses its talent and moves forward. However, on Wednesday night, the 30-year-old Lance Thomas got the starting nod over the 26-year-old Kanter.  \u201cIt\u2019s so frustrating,\u201d Kanter said after the game, per Newsday . \u201cThis morning in the meeting he said I\u2019m starting. Now coming to the game ready to go and I\u2019m sitting on the bench. I can not get caught up with all that stuff. My job right now is just cheer for my teammates and try to be a good teammate.

The NBA trade deadline \u2014 Feb. 7 \u2014 is looming and Memphis is losing ground in the Western Conference playoff chase after an optimistic start to 2018-19. At Wednesday\u2019s shootaround, Conley told reporters that Grizzlies owner Robert Pera told him Tuesday that the team has placed he and Gasol on the trading block. Gasol declined to share details of his conversations with the Grizzlies owner, saying he considers those private. Both players have spent their entire careers with the Grizzlies, with Gasol in his 11th season and Conley in his 12th. Gasol initially made a quick exit from shootaround, per David Cobb of the Memphis Commercial Appeal , but then agreed to talk. \u201cMy relationship with the Grizzlies might change, but my relationship with Memphis won\u2019t,\u201d Gasol said. \u201cWhat I feel inside and how I feel about Memphis and its people has nothing to do with a franchise or a temporary thing. It\u2019s not going to change.\u201d When asked about the possibility of playing his whole career in Memphis, Gasol said: \u201cDoes it feel like it\u2019s up to me right now? No. So why even think about it. It\u2019s irrelevant. You go out there and do your job. That\u2019s plain and simple. I don\u2019t want anyone to use this as an excuse not to do so.\u201d Conley said he heard from Pera last night about the trade talk and is trying to do what he can to help Memphis as long as he\u2019s around. \u201cIt\u2019s where we\u2019re at, I guess. It\u2019s part of the business. It\u2019s not like we\u2019ve been traded yet or anything like that. It\u2019s part of it,\u201d Conley said, per Omari Sankofa II of The Athletic . \u201cWe knew the way things have been going the last few weeks that anything can happen. From here on, it\u2019s about coming to work, continually trying to do things I can to help this team. \u201cI hadn\u2019t been paying attention at all, actually [to any recent trade talk]. Robert [Pera] called me yesterday just to make me aware that they were going to go about doing this. \u2026 I almost got traded my rookie year or my second year in the league. It\u2019s not new to me, it\u2019s just been a while. It\u2019s all part of the business.\u201d Gasol expressed frustration Wednesday that Conley was even being included in trade talks. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why Mike is in those talks either,\u201d Gasol said. \u201cMike is one heck of a player, and we\u2019re going to need good players moving forward. I don\u2019t understand why Mike is in this.\u201d Per ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski , Gasol and Conley recently met with Pera in Memphis, but neither expressed a desire to be dealt. Memphis began the season well, boasting a 12-5 mark after a road win against the San Antonio Spurs on Nov. 21 \u2014 a victory sealed by a pair of Gasol free throws with 0.7 seconds left. Since then, the Grizzlies have swooned, going 7-23 and falling to 14th in the West . The Grizzlies have lost five straight and are 1-9 in their last 10 games. During the five-game skid, opponents have shot 42 percent from 3-point range and the Grizzlies have allowed 117.6 points per 100 possessions . Memphis hosts the Charlotte Hornets tonight ( 8 ET, NBA League Pass ) to start a five-game home stand that lasts through Jan. 30. Gasol can become a free agent this summer if he opts out of the final year of his current contract. Conley has an early-termination option for 2020-21 and, per ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski , has $22.4 million of his $34.5 million salary guaranteed. The balance of the deal will become fully protected once he plays in 55 games (Conley has played in 46 games so far).

Cousins doesn\u2019t have to carry Golden State, though two victories by 18 and 19 points and per-36 numbers of 22 points, 15 rebounds and eight assists suggest he could do that as his minutes ramp up. All he has to do is fit in and, in the team\u2019s embrace of him and his talents, provide a rallying point for the other Warriors. This is something different, a basketball challenge that can crowd out other possible, less helpful distractions. The only potential downside I could see would be a physical setback for Cousins once the Warriors really began to rely on him. But heck, that would provide a different sort of rallying point. This is all going to work out precisely the way the \u201clight years ahead\u201d organization scripted it. Good for them, bad for everybody else. Shaun Powell :  My thought is the same as it was before the season started: that the Warriors from a personnel standpoint have never been scarier in the Steve Kerr era . Which says a lot. With five All-Stars, four of whom are career 20-point scorers, you can\u2019t double team anyone. They don\u2019t even need DeMarcus Cousins and yet Cousins (so far) is showing no sign of an injury slowdown. Assuming everyone stays on the same page from here, well, we know how this will end. John Schuhmann :  I don\u2019t know if the Warriors could be happier with the Cousins addition thus far. He has looked more mobile than expected and he certainly hasn\u2019t upset the champs\u2019 rhythm as they\u2019ve run their winning streak to eight games. The team\u2019s five-All-Star starting lineup has outscored its opponents 55-20 in its 18 minutes and has recorded assists on 22 of its 23 field goals (with only four turnovers). We\u2019ll learn more with every game and the Celtics will be a great test for Cousins defensively on Saturday, but so far, so good. Sekou Smith :  My preliminary thoughts and concerns about the Warriors folding Cousins into their mix were allayed after watching how well the big man fit in with his All-Star teammates in those first two games. They were already the favorites to win it all again, but Boogie\u2019s addition had the potential to derail things. But I just don\u2019t see it happening. He\u2019s been around the Warriors long enough to know that you dive into the culture and embrace that whole strength in numbers thing and it tends to work out for all involved. I\u2019m going to enjoy seeing how all of the Warriors\u2019 stars handle yet another All-Star needing his touches. I want to see just how far you can stretch the fabric of this team before something (or someone) breaks."},{"id":36203,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-who-bucks-second-star","date":"2019-01-23","title":"Blogtable: Who is second star on the Bucks this season?","content":"* * * The Milwaukee Bucks have the best record in the NBA and one of the game\u2019s best players in Giannis Antetokounmpo. My question for you: Who is Milwaukee\u2019s second star?  * * * Steve Aschburner :  Khris Middleton , like it or not. You can make small-to-medium-sized cases for other Bucks such as Brook Lopez, Eric Bledsoe and Malcolm Brogdon, each valuable in significant ways to the ensemble. But Middleton is the shooter, scorer and defender to best complement Giannis Antetokounmpo, a potential full-service sidekick \u2026 who has disappeared at an alarming rate through the first half of 2018-19. Being able to bring it every night in support of the team\u2019s Kia MVP candidate is vital, especially given Milwaukee\u2019s salary-cap limitations. I can\u2019t see GM Jon Horst snagging an alternative No. 2 in the next couple weeks. So it\u2019s on Middleton to demonstrate his true worth from now through springtime. Shaun Powell :  It\u2019s Khris Middleton. However, this team is pretty close to being a shotgun-by-committee because of what Malcolm Brogdon and Drew, er, Eric Bledsoe and others bring almost on a nightly basis. And you could also make an argument that the second star is coach Mike Budenholzer. He changed the offense , introduced the 3-pointer and employs a solid defensive scheme. John Schuhmann :  If the Eastern Conference coaches need a suggest for a second All-Star from Milwaukee, Eric Bledsoe is the pick. He\u2019s been a more efficient scorer than Khris Middleton, more of a playmaker than Malcolm Brogdon, and an important on-the-ball defender for the league\u2019s No. 1 defense . But really, it doesn\u2019t matter who the Bucks\u2019 \u201csecond star\u201d is, all of their starters have played important roles, and while Antetokounmpo is the MVP right now, he\u2019s got a terrific ensemble around him. What\u2019s interesting is that the team with the league\u2019s best pace-adjusted point differential by a wide margin has a starting lineup that ranks just 15th (at plus-4.3 points per 100 possessions) among the 26 lineups that have played at least 200 minutes together . The Milwaukee reserves have been critical to the team\u2019s success as well. What\u2019s even more interesting is that (assuming Middleton declines his player option) each of the other four starters will be free agents (and worthy of bigger contracts that they currently have) in July. No matter how things go in the postseason, the Bucks are going to have a very interesting summer.  Sekou Smith :  I don\u2019t know if the Bucks have a legitimate \u201csecond star,\u201d though Khris Middleton and Eric Bledsoe do a fine job of playing that role at times. I\u2019ll be curious to see if the Bucks get two players on the All-Star team this season, and if so, who gets the nod. The beauty of what Mike Budenholzer has built (in short order) in Milwaukee is that it almost doesn\u2019t matter who the No. 2 guy is alongside Giannis. An assembly of high-quality players backing up \u201cthe Greek Freak\u201d is more than sufficient for contention in the Eastern Conference this season. Crafting the right system to take advantage of all of these guys the way the Bucks have is just another example of Bud\u2019s perfect touch."},{"id":36180,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-pelicans-playoff-chances-davis-injury","date":"2019-01-23","title":"Blogtable: How will Davis' injury impact playoff hopes for Pelicans?","content":"* * * With Anthony Davis out for up to two weeks ( and perhaps longer ) with a sprained finger, the Pelicans\u2019 chances of making the playoffs are ____________?  * * * Steve Aschburner :  Acquisition-dependent. The Pelicans as currently constituted aren\u2019t going to reach the postseason. There are too many teams to climb over from their current perch in the West and they haven\u2019t played defense well enough to rely on clamping down night after night to get there (they should be better on that side of the ball, frankly, with Anthony Davis to anchor them). This team needs help at the trade deadline or in the buyout market afterward, not just for a playoff push but to finish strong enough to persuade Davis New Orleans remains the long-term locale for him. Tall order. Shaun Powell :  I\u2019d say fragile , a lot like Davis. The West is simply too deep this year and two teams that were struggling \u2014 the Houston Rockets and Utah Jazz \u2014 got their acts together and now appear strong. The Pelicans haven\u2019t had the same level of bounce, and time could be running out soon. The good news is last year they were in a similar situation. They caught fire right after the All-Star break, not only making the playoffs but advanced to the Western Conference semifinals . They\u2019ll need to copy that. John Schuhmann :  Slim. The Pelicans were fortunate to begin this no-AD stretch against the Grizzlies, who have been one of the worst teams in the league over the last six weeks. But after they host the Detroit Pistons on Wednesday, the Pelicans will play six straight games against teams no worse than the 27-21 Spurs. Overall, New Orleans has the West\u2019s sixth-toughest remaining schedule in regard to cumulative opponent winning percentage. Twenty of their 35 remaining games are at home, but they\u2019re an uninspiring 7-5 at the Smoothie King Center since Thanksgiving . The Pelicans\u2019 offense ranks in the top five , a fact which defies the idea that they need more talent around Davis. Big runs from the Rockets and Spurs took both of those teams from 14th place to the top six in a about a month. But the Pelicans\u2019 defense has been terrible ( it currently ranks 26th ), and it\u2019s hard to see them turning things around on that end of the floor (enough to climb four spots in the standings) with almost 60 percent of the season in the books.  Sekou Smith : It is going to be a grind for the Pelicans, with or without Anthony Davis healthy and in uniform. The more perplexing question about their season is why a team with Davis as its anchor is floundering near the bottom of the Western Conference standings in the first place? The Pelicans \u2014 given their accomplishments last season and the expectations that accompany a superstar like Davis \u2014 have been one of the NBA\u2019s more disappointing teams this season. But Davis\u2019 injury history and the Pelicans\u2019 checkered history with Davis as their anchor should be cause for pause. The future of this partnership is on shaky ground if the Pelicans miss out on the playoffs. And that appears to be a very real possibility right now."},{"id":36202,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/james-harden-i-want-my-name-there","date":"2019-01-23","title":"Harden: 'I want my name up there' with all-time greats","content":"* Tonight on NBA League Pass:  Rockets vs. Knicks, 7:30 ET For 20 games (and counting), James Harden has etched his place in NBA lore. During that stretch, he\u2019s logged at least 30 points in each game, scored 40 or more nine times and broken the 50-point plateau three times. Harden\u2019s run of 30-point performances now trails only NBA legend Wilt Chamberlain, who posted runs of 20, 25, 31 and 65 games at various points from 1960-62.

Obviously, you want to win championships and want the individual accomplishments, but every day (when) I\u2019m in the gym and work on moves, I think about that. \u201cWhen I\u2019m done, whenever that is, I want my name up there with them. It\u2019s a good place to be in.\u201d Harden\u2019s scoring run began on Dec. 13, in a 126-121 win against the L.A. Lakers . He finished with 50 points, 10 rebounds and 11 assists, and at the time, the Rockets sat in 14th place in the Western Conference standings . Since then, Houston has gone 13-6 and moved to No. 5 in the West . Over the past 20 games, Harden is averaging 42.3 points per game , upping his league-leading scoring average from 30 ppg entering that Dec. 13 game versus the Lakers to 35.7 ppg . That average would be the NBA\u2019s highest since Jordan led the league in scoring with 37.1 ppg in 1986-87 . If he maintains this pace, Harden\u2019s average would be the ninth-highest single-season scoring average in league history. Only five players in NBA history \u2014 Chamberlain (5 times), Jordan, Bryant and Rick Barry \u2014 have averaged at least 35 ppg in a season. * NBA.com\/Stats:  Digging into Harden\u2019s scoring surge Injuries have made life rough on the Rockets at times this season.

The thing is, they\u2019ve somehow managed to play like it, improving to 11-2 when he sits after Tuesday\u2019s 120-103 rout of the Sacramento Kings. Full disclosure: The Kings were also short-handed thanks to De\u2019Aaron Fox\u2019s sore toe. But neither were they making any excuses after the Raptors outscored them by 20 over the final three quarters, a comprehensive beating aptly summarized by their social media team. Leonard was ably replaced in the starting lineup by Fred VanVleet, who played alongside Kyle Lowry in the backcourt while Danny Green slid into Leonard\u2019s vacated spot at small forward. VanVleet and Lowry complemented one another perfectly, scoring 19 points apiece while dishing out seven and nine assists, respectively. They also got big performances from Serge Ibaka (15 points, 10 rebounds) and Pascal Siakam (18 points). But the Raptors, who are 25-11 when Leonard plays, mostly did it with balance as eight players took at least six shots and\/or scored at least eight points. Bad news for the Indiana Pacers: Not only is Leonard, who is being rested, expected to sit out for tonight\u2019s game, the Raptors are 8-1 on the second night of back-to-backs.

The Bulls have no plans to play Anthony and will look to either trade the 10-time All-Star before the Feb. 7 deadline or ultimately waive him and make him a free agent. Anthony averaged 13.4 points in 10 games with the Rockets. He has not played since Nov. 8. Anthony was traded by Oklahoma City to Atlanta in July, a move that preceded the Hawks releasing him to sign with the Rockets. The Bulls, technically, are Anthony\u2019s fourth franchise in seven months. Anthony was the No. 3 pick in the star-studded 2003 draft class that also included No. 1 LeBron James, No. 4 Chris Bosh and No. 5 Dwyane Wade.

Johnson of the Chicago Tribune . Anthony reportedly will be waived by the Bulls and become a free agent if he clears waivers, Johnson and Wojnarowski report. Here\u2019s more from Johnson on the trade : The Rockets signed Kenneth Faried after releasing James Nunnally on Monday afternoon.  Here\u2019s more from Wojnarowski on Anthony\u2019s next steps: In the summer of 2014 , the Bulls tried to woo Anthony \u2014 then a top-level free agent \u2014 to Chicago. Two giant digital images above the entrance on Madison Street showed Anthony in a Bulls No. 7 jersey dribbling next to a championship trophy. Anthony arrived at a decked-out United Center on the afternoon of July 1, 2014 with agent Leon Rose and coach Tom Thibodeau, a police SUV trailing their oversized limousine. However, a move to Chicago never happened as Anthony opted to re-sign with the New York Knicks , his team at the time. Anthony and the Rockets agreed to part ways in mid-November after the team\u2019s slow start to the season. The 10-time All-Star played just 10 games for Houston after signing a one-year, $2.4 million deal during the offseason. Anthony was traded from the Oklahoma City Thunder to the Atlanta Hawks last July before the Hawks released him to clear the way for him to sign with the Rockets. Houston thought he could be the piece it needed to finally get past Golden State and win its first championship since back-to-back titles in 1994-95. Instead the Rockets limped out to a 6-7 start and the emergence of undrafted rookie Gary Clark made it appear that Anthony would have to take a reduced role. In the end the Rockets decided it would be better to move on than to force Anthony to do that. \u201cWe just had to see how things worked out,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said at the time . \u201cAnd the way we play probably wasn\u2019t conducive to his game and he was trying to make the necessary sacrifices and it wasn\u2019t fair to him as a Hall of Fame player to play in a way that wasn\u2019t good for him, wasn\u2019t good for us. It just wasn\u2019t a fit.\u201d The 34-year-old Anthony has had a tough time over the last two seasons. He averaged a career-low 16.2 points in 78 starts in a tumultuous season for the Thunder last season before coming to Houston \u2014 and accepting a reserve role for the first time in his 16-year career. Eight of Anthony\u2019s 10 appearances for the Rockets came off the bench after he had started all 1,054 games he\u2019d played in his first 15 NBA seasons. D\u2019Antoni said he feels for Anthony that things ended this way and made it clear that it wasn\u2019t a matter of Anthony not having the right attitude in Houston. \u201cIn the summer we tried to hit a home run and it didn\u2019t work out,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said. \u201cHe tried everything he could. He was great while he was here. It just didn\u2019t work out for whatever reason. I just thank him for his professionalism. It was good. He tried everything he could to make it work and it just didn\u2019t work out.\u201d The third overall pick in the 2003 draft has averaged 24 points, 6.5 rebounds and 3 assists in a career that also included stints with the Denver Nuggets and the New York Knicks. Anthony sat out Houston\u2019s last three games with what the team called an illness. His last appearance for Houston came in a blowout loss to Oklahoma City on Nov. 8 when he had two points and five rebounds.

The Hawks hosted Civil Rights icon Andrew Young , a former Atlanta Mayor and King confidant who also served in numerous other key leadership positions as a politician and activist. They also put a fun spin on their player introductions . Out in Memphis, where King was assassinated in 1968 and the team has established a strong connection to the National Civil Rights Museum , guard Mike Conley Jr. recently joined NBA legend Isiah Thomas in meeting with several students from Grizzlies Prep : The team also discussed the impact MLK Jr. had on their lives .

May we all recognize that The Dream is rooted in a reality that isn\u2019t as comforting as many of its isolated quotables. \u2014Ben Couch Klay Thompson tied an NBA record by nailing his first 10 3-pointers. He further cemented his legacy as one of the league\u2019s deadliest shooters ever with his fifth game of double-digit triples. Though teammate Stephen Curry tops that leaderboard with 12 such games, no one else in NBA history has more than three. Want to rack your brain? Who held the record Thompson tied? We\u2019ll catch you up post-Googling. In the interim, take a moment for schadenfreude, and watch Curry, ah \u2026 not quite achieve that which he set out to accomplish . Twice. Yikes. Warriors beat the Lakers by 29, btw. It wasn\u2019t that close. (The trivia answer: Ty Lawson .) Yes, James Harden hit 30 points again. 37, to be exact, which puts his seemingly never-ending streak at 20 games overall. James and Wilt. Wilt and James. Get used to hearing those in tandem. Unfortunately, only newcomer Kenneth Faried and mercurial forward Gerald Green joined Harden in double digits as the Rockets were blown out by the Sixers, 121-93. Harden played just 30 minutes (he averages 37.3), and coach Mike D\u2019Antoni thought another 50-pointer could\u2019ve been in the cards. Alas. #OnToTheNextOne. It\u2019s been a season for young Luka Doncic, who\u2019s averaging 20 points, 6.7 rebounds and 5.1 assists per game. Those numbers were boosted Monday after the rookie swingman finally pushed over the 3\u00d710 plateau, putting up 21 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists in the Mavericks\u2019 116-106 loss to Milwaukee. That triple-double made Doncic the second-youngest player in NBA history to achieve the feat, following only Markelle Fultz, who did it while 10 days younger. Giannis Antetokounmpo suited up against his younger brother, Kostas, for the first time in the NBA. Kostas is with Dallas on a two-way contract and joined the Mavericks on this road trip after spending most of the season in the G League. Kostas was on the bench but did not play. \u201cI wish I\u2019d played against him,\u201d Giannis said. \u201cBut those few moments that we spent before the game and during the game and after the game, they were amazing.\u201d The Antetokounmpo brothers left the arena together, alongside their mother."},{"id":36175,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/luka-doncic-becomes-second-teenager-post-triple-double","date":"2019-01-22","title":"Doncic second teenager to record triple-double","content":"With 21 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists in the Mavs\u2019 116-106 loss in Milwaukee, Luka Doncic became the second-youngest player in NBA history to record a triple-double.

And while Week 14 marked the return of DeMarcus Cousins from a near year-long absence, it also came with more injuries to important players. Clint Capela was actually injured at the end of Week 13, but had surgery on his thumb on Thursday and is set to miss the next 4-6 weeks for a team \u2014 the Houston Rockets \u2014 fighting for a top-four seed in the Western Conference. The Rockets got Eric Gordon back from injury last week and Chris Paul will return eventually, but neither of those guys can replace what Capela brings on both ends of the floor. The New Orleans Pelicans are in a more desperate situation than the Rockets and lost a more important player than Capela, with Anthony Davis suffering a sprained finger in Portland on Friday. Davis will only miss 1-2 weeks , but, sitting four games out of a playoff spot with Davis\u2019 contract-extension decision coming in less than six months, the Pelicans need every game they can get. So do the Los Angeles Lakers, who have fallen out of playoff position with LeBron James having missed the last 13 games. James should be returning soon , but before they got him back, the Lakers lost Lonzo Ball to an ankle injury that will have him out 4-6 weeks . Like Capela, Wendell Carter Jr. had thumb surgery last week and could be out even longer. Carter\u2019s team isn\u2019t fighting for anything but Lottery combinations, but an extended absence will stunt his development, with him having played just 191 minutes alongside Kris Dunn, Zach LaVine and Lauri Markkanen.

The 10th overall pick in the 2010 Draft, George started his career in Indiana, helping the Pacers to back-to-back trips to the Eastern Conference finals , where he shined on the big stage against Miami\u2019s \u201cBig 3\u201d Heat squad led by LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh. But a devastating injury , a trade demand and wild, free-agent summer that-never-was later, led him to his current situation as one of the faces of the Oklahoma City Thunder. George and Russell Westbrook are the leaders of a Thunder squad that is again a legitimate challenger in the Western Conference \u2013 both now and for the foreseeable future. The timing couldn\u2019t be better for George, the Southern California native who spurned LeBron and the hometown Lakers for an opportunity to find his own lane with the Thunder. Overall, he\u2019s in a great place, on and off the court. One of the league\u2019s top two-way players, George has emerged as a dark horse Kia MVP candidate this season while playing alongside triple-double machine\/2017 Kia MVP Westbrook. His family is comfortable in Oklahoma City, the midwestern city that embraced the Georges at what turned out to be the perfect time. George spoke to NBA.com \u2018s Sekou Smith about all that and more. * * * Sekou Smith:  You\u2019ve been a great player in this league for a long time, played in two Eastern Conference finals and competed against the best at the highest levels. But I\u2019ve never seen you as good on both ends as you\u2019ve been this season. Do you feel like your game has ascended to another level? Paul George:  Yeah, yeah. Definitely. I think you just get a feel, an understanding of the game that leads to where I am now. I know my pace, I know my game and what\u2019s comfortable for me. And at this point in my career, I\u2019ve seen every defense you can see. There\u2019s nothing you can throw at me that I haven\u2019t already seen, mentally or physically. And defensively I know every angle. I mean \u2026 I do my homework. I know what guys like to do, I know tendencies. I just know what an average basketball player would do in certain moments, and I just play to that. SS:  It\u2019s almost like you\u2019ve solved the matrix or something. PG:  It just feels honestly, man, like everything has slowed down at this stage of my career. All the years I\u2019ve been in this league, it\u2019s like \u2026 say a kid is being taught algebra. And he\u2019s got all of these math problems going on. And everything, I\u2019m just pulling from it and grabbing it and I can see through concepts and understand what\u2019s going on out there. It\u2019s a fun way to play, when there aren\u2019t any crazy surprises that anyone can throw at you. SS:  I know when you come into this league, everybody is working to get there. Everybody wants to be on that list of truly elite players in this game. Does it feel different when you actually get there after all the years of hard work? And how do you know when you\u2019ve gotten there? Is it a certain way teams deal with you, a respect level for you, that shows up when you get there? PG:  It does, especially in the way other teams deal with you and come at you. I think the notion now is to \u201cbe physical and get into him.\u201d And then a lot of times it\u2019s like an emphasis to try and take me out of the game early, which again, I\u2019ve seen every way I can be guarded. So it almost helps, in a way, for teams to start the game off aggressively coming at me and trying to trap me. That plays into my game. I like to play myself into a game. I\u2019m never going to come out shooting, trying to get mine or anything like that. I like to let the game come to me and set guys up. And then I can pick and choose when I can be aggressive, when I need to be aggressive. So when teams play like that, when they are deliberate about trying to take me out of the game, they\u2019re just playing into my hands. SS:  Are you as comfortable off the court now as you are on the court? You\u2019re not the young buck anymore. You\u2019re all grown up now, settled in Oklahoma City with your family and everything else seemingly in place. P G:  Listen, life has been good. I\u2019ve got two little ones and a beautiful woman at home. I\u2019m close with my teammates here. I\u2019m at peace, honestly. I\u2019m at peace. All I have to do is go out there and play. I don\u2019t have to worry about trade rumors or things like that. I don\u2019t have to worry about contract extensions or how things are going to work out. Everything is set in stone right now and I\u2019m really comfortable, in the best way possible. I\u2019m relaxed in that part of my life. SS:  Based on the conversations you and Russ(ell Westbrook) had in the offseason, do you think this team is where you expected it to be a little past the midway point of the season? PG:  Yeah, I definitely think so. With that being said, though, I think there is a lot of room for improvement for us. We knew where we wanted to be coming back off of last season. And we\u2019re in that neighborhood. We wanted to be one of the best teams in the West. SS:  I know it started slow \u2026 PG:  It did, it started slow. But that\u2019s expected when you consider what we were coming from last season. We started without Russ and we had to learn to play without Russ. I had to carry a little extra weight in trying to get us going offensively and defensively. And we played without countless numbers of guys being out of the rotation who play a lot of minutes for us. It was a little bit all over the place to start the season. But I think still, we\u2019re right where we need to be. SS:  For years the Western Conference had its own hierarchy in terms of which teams fit where in the playoff picture. It feels a little different now with all these upstart teams challenging for playoff spots. Even with the Warriors, seeming as vulnerable as they\u2019ve been in years, it feels different now. Is the chase different now as well? PG:  It\u2019s still Golden State as the team to beat, regardless if they are No. 1 in the standings or wherever they are seeded at. They\u2019re still the team we have to go through, that everybody has to go through in the West. We just wanted to be seeded well come playoff time. That\u2019s when we have to be at our best. And that\u2019s the team we have to be gunning for. SS:  Does the evolution of some of these younger guys on the roster, coupled with the veteran stars already established, make you feel better about the pursuit, whatever it is and wherever it ends, this season? PG:  Let me say this: I think Steven Adams is one of the best players at his position, and he doesn\u2019t get a lot of credit for what he does. Terrance Ferguson is one of the young promising defenders and 3-point shooters in our league. And he has so much room where he can take his game to. I just wanted to point that out. And look, we rely on so many young guys, outside of myself, Russ, Ray (Felton) and a couple of our other vets, we lean on a group of guys who are basically three or four years and younger into their NBA careers. Even Jerami Grant, who has been great for us, is still a young guy. He\u2019s just 24. But he\u2019s been huge, the X-factor really. His ability to switch on defense, run the floor, play above the rim and then stretch the floor, as just been huge for us. And he\u2019s still young. But I think that\u2019s a good thing, that we really, really count on our young guys to help us get to where we are right now. SS:  That brings up a great point about where this team and really this franchise sits right now, in terms of the foundation. There aren\u2019t many teams fortified at all levels, at so many positions, and with stars and role players and everything else in between. Does is it seem a little crazy in this league how things can seem so shaky one minute and then so solid the next? PG:  It does. It really does. It\u2019s clear [GM] Sam [Presti] and our front office guys have done a hell of a job. And I can only think of how good we can be, especially defensively, once Andre Roberson is back in the rotation and the lift he\u2019ll give us. We\u2019re already one of the best defensive teams in the league and now we\u2019re talking about adding one of the best individual defenders in the game back into the mix and our starting lineup. You just never know where we could be when it all comes together this season and into the future. You never know who\u2019s going to want to come and join me and Russ and the rest of these guys on this journey. But I feel comfortable saying that we\u2019re solid right now and in a really good spot. * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

Harden topped 50 for the third time in 2018-19 and the 12th time in his career while topping 40 points for the 14th time this season. Hornets 108, Spurs 93 \u2014 Of all the defeats San Antonio may log this season, this is one they probably won\u2019t be too upset over months from now. The reason? Tony Parker came back to town with the Hornets, and while the former Finals MVP and Spurs legend had a quiet night (eight points, three rebounds, four assists), he was treated like a living legend all game long. Warriors 142, Nuggets 111 \u2014 Who says Golden State doesn\u2019t get riled up and fully into playoff form until sometime in April, May or June? Denver got a taste of all the Warriors have to offer as they blitzed the Nuggets with 51 first-quarter points (an NBA record). For good measure, familiar Warriors heroes Stephen Curry (31 points) and Klay Thompson (31 points) rampaged from deep to fuel this matchup of No. 1 (Denver) vs. No. 2 (Golden State) in the West standings. Celtics 117, Raptors 108 \u2014 As they say, winning cures everything. And winning big against a team leading the charge in your conference? That only helps the cause. Kyrie Irving set the tone all game and sealed the win, too, with a clutch 3-pointer that helped Boston end a three-game skid and quiet talk of discord in the locker room. Nets 145, Rockets 142 (OT) \u2014 James Harden started out with a slow first half, blazed for 39 in the second half and added five more points in overtime. That got him to 58 points, but on his big scoring night, the Rockets were done in by Spencer Dinwiddie. The Nets\u2019 guard nailed a clutch 3-pointer to send the game to OT and went for 25 of his 33 points in the fourth quarter and OT to give Brooklyn a big road win. Jazz 129, Clippers 109 \u2014 Don\u2019t look now, but Utah may be starting to figure things out. Donovan Mitchell (28 points) and Rudy Gobert (23 points, 22 rebounds) powered the Jazz to a fifth straight win as they improved to 8-2 over their last 10 games. Even bigger, though, is that the Clippers are fighting for a lower playoff seed like Utah, and a win such as this one will help the Jazz if things get hairy as the season winds down. Warriors 112, Clippers 94 \u2014 After more than a year of waiting for him and months of waiting for his new team, Warriors big man DeMarcus Cousins made his debut for Golden State. He looked pretty sharp for not having played since Jan. 26, 2018, finishing with 14 points, six rebounds, three assists, a steal and a block in Friday night\u2019s big win. Thunder 117, Sixers 115 \u2014 You want last-minute thrills? This was the game to watch for that this week. Saturday\u2019s matinee featured (what seemed to be) a go-ahead steal and layup by Jimmy Butler with 6.9 seconds left. But then, Paul George came through with a clutch 4-point play with 5.1 seconds left that sealed the victory for OKC. Rockets 138, Lakers 134 (OT) \u2014 Another day, another 40-plus points from the reigning Kia MVP. Yes, James Harden worked his magic again, this time heating up late to help the Rockets climb from a 21-point hole to drop the Lakers in a Saturday night thriller. In addition, Eric Gordon nailed several key 3-pointers \u2014 including the one to force overtime \u2014 to lighten Harden\u2019s burden. James Harden (57 points, 17-33 FG, 17-17 FT, 9 reb, 2 ast in 38 minutes) \u2014 The work Harden puts in to get these kinds of games on the regular is astounding. Consider that his 57-point game Monday was entirely needed for Houston, which had only three other players \u2014 Danuel House Jr., Austin Rivers and Gerald Green \u2014 score in double figures. | Watch | Video box score Anthony Davis (46 points, 16-34 FG, 12-12 FT, 16 reb, 4 ast, 3 stl in 38 minutes) \u2014 Anthony Davis told teammates after the first quarter that he stunk. Then, he turned back into his All-Star self and went nuts, shooting 14-for-27 and nailing four late free throws to close out the win. New Orleans can\u2019t afford to lose ground in the West and Davis continues to do all he can to keep it in the thick of things | Watch | Video box score Stephen Curry (31 points, 10-18 FG, 8-13 3pt FG, 6 reb, 4 ast in 29 minutes) & Klay Thompson (31 points, 13-19 FG, 5-8 3pt FG in 24 minutes) \u2014 Splash Brothers, do your worst. That seemed to be the marching orders for Golden State on Tuesday in Denver, and the Warriors\u2019 guard combo delivered with a classic shooting display in Denver. As impressive as the Nuggets have been this season, this loss took some of they hype out of their fast start in the West this season. | Watch | Video box score James Harden (58 points, 16-34 FG, 5-19 3pt FG, 21-23 FT, 10 reb, 6 ast in 45 minutes) \u2014 Years from now, perhaps this run Harden is on \u2014 which hit 18 straight games with 30 or more points Wednesday \u2014 will just be a footnote in an even bigger legacy. In short, he showed that he simply cannot be slowed. He started with 14 first-half points, then carved up the Nets the rest of the game \u2014 but ultimately couldn\u2019t deliver a victory. | Watch | Video box score Spencer Dinwiddie (33 points, 13-22 FG, 4-8 3pt FG, 10 ast in 32 minutes) \u2014 The Nets continue to gain confidence, but Wednesday\u2019s big win in Houston wouldn\u2019t have happened without Dinwiddie. He forced overtime, making three 3-pointers in the last 30 seconds of regulation. Then, in OT, he hit the go-ahead basket with 28 seconds left. | Watch | Video box score Stephen Curry (41 points, 11-22 FG, 9-17 3pt FG, 10-10 FT, 5 reb, 3 ast in 35 minutes) \u2014 Talk about a hot streak. Curry has 28 3-pointers in his past three games, became the first player in NBA history to make eight or more 3s in three straight games and helped the Pelicans and Warriors combine an NBA-record 43 3s on Wednesday night. | Watch | Video box score James Harden (48 points, 14-30 FG, 8-19 3pt FG, 8 reb, 6 ast, 4 stl in 48 minutes) \u2014 What more can be said at this point about what Harden is doing? His performance on Saturday night marked the 10th time in the last 13 games he went for 40 or more points. That\u2019s amazing in and of itself \u2026 and yet it still doesn\u2019t do justice to Harden\u2019s hot streak. |  Watch | Video box score \u201cI felt like a kid on Christmas.

Towns shouldered the load for the Minnesota Timberwolves in the first half, pouring in 28 points on 14 shots. But as the budding young star cooled off in the second, scoring just two points while misfiring on 7 of 8 shots, Rose was more than ready to pick up the slack. Continuing his improbable comeback season, the revitalized former Kia MVP erupted for 29 of his 31 points over the final 24 minutes, capped by his clutch jumper with 0.6 seconds remaining to give the Timberwolves a 116-114 victory . With the nation\u2019s attention fixed firmly on the NFL\u2019s conference championship games, the shot didn\u2019t get nearly as much attention as some of his previous heroics, including his 50-spot against the Utah Jazz on Oct. 31. But it was more indication, after a recent ankle sprain cost him eight games, that Rose isn\u2019t ready to let his remarkable ride end just yet. Sunday marked the 19th time in 36 games he\u2019s scored 20 points or more this season, a consistent source of production for a team in need of any kind of steadiness it can get during what has been an exceptionally turbulent season. And while his status as a high-flying superstar has long since expired, the instinct to take charge remains fully intact. Rather than run a pick-and-roll with Towns on the final play, as drawn up by interim head coach Ryan Saunders, Rose saw a matchup with Suns rookie Mikal Bridges and chose to attack. \u201cIt was a rook sticking me, right?\u201d he said, as reported by The Athletic . \u201cA rookie. C\u2019mon, I gotta go at him in that situation.\u201d In the old days, Rose almost certainly would have looked to attack the rim. But now, with injuries having reduced his athletic ability to nil, he instead went to the step-back jumper. Swish. Another moment to remember in what has already been an unforgettable season. \u201cLike I always say, I believe in myself, and I work on this all the time,\u201d Rose said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to force anything.\u201d Brooklyn Nets center Jarrett Allen has made quite the name for himself as a shot blocker of highlight-reel caliber .

The Miami Heat guard \u2014 who has dubbed his 16th and final NBA season \u201cOne Last Dance\u201d \u2014 was the guest of honor at Marquette\u2019s game against Providence on Sunday. Wade starred for the Golden Eagles during the 2001-02 and 2002-03 seasons, leading Marquette to the Final Four in his last year of college before he jumped to the NBA. It was part of a weekend celebration for Wade, who played for the final time in his hometown of Chicago on Saturday night when the Heat topped the Bulls. He and his family made the quick trip north to frosty Milwaukee, where students and fans donned gold T-shirts bearing his name and No. 3 on the back for \u201cDwyane Wade Day.\u201d \u201cI think my younger self would be proud of me,\u201d Wade said. The big surprise came at halftime, when Marquette and some members of Wade\u2019s inner circle stunned him by having his two oldest sons and the nephew that he\u2019s raising come onto the court. Zaire Wade, his oldest, presented his father with the Marquette letter jacket that he never got as a collegian \u2014 and Zion Wade, the younger son, gave him a baby-sized jacket for the family\u2019s newest addition, Kaavia James Union Wade. Wade thought his kids were in Miami, unable to attend because of conflicts with their own basketball schedules. \u201cI\u2019m not surprised much,\u201d Wade said. \u201cBut y\u2019all got me today.\u201d Flanked by his wife, Gabrielle Union, on one side and his mother, Jolinda Wade, on the other as they sat in baseline seats adjacent to the Marquette bench, Wade was the recipient of several tributes during the game \u2014 some of them shown on the video screens during timeouts, and another of the on-court variety during halftime. Travis Diener and Jae Crowder were among the former Marquette players who sent well-wishes via video, as was Georgia coach Tom Crean, who coached Wade at Marquette. Wesley Matthews, another onetime Golden Eagle, did the same and also was at the game since he and the Dallas Mavericks will be back in that building on Monday to take on the Milwaukee Bucks. Steve Novak, a college teammate of Wade\u2019s, was in the crowd. \u201cThank you so much for being back here and allowing us to honor you, the great career that you\u2019ve had, the impact that you\u2019ve had on Marquette and the impact that really you had on the game of basketball and every community you\u2019ve touched,\u201d Marquette coach Steve Wojciechowski said in a taped speech serving as Wade\u2019s introduction at halftime. \u201cWe love you.

That\u2019s especially true of Joel Embiid and Russell Westbrook, who collided with more than words during Saturday\u2019s 117-115 Thunder victory. The Sixers center sent Westbrook to the floor in transition, and the Thunder star immediately took exception to what he felt was extra contact at the end of the play. After the game, Westbrook doubled down on his point of view. \u201cI don\u2019t think he just landed on me,\u201d Westbrook said. \u201cHe had a little extra to it. But it\u2019s OK.\u201d When asked if he and Embiid were \u201ccool\u201d now that the play and game were over, Westbrook quickly answered, \u201c[Expletive] no!\u201d For his part, Embiid denied any malicious intent but did not resist observing that Westbrook is \u201calways in his feelings.\u201d This is not the first time the former Kia MVP and Rookie of the Year have clashed. The pair shared not-so-pleasantries after last year\u2019s triple-overtime game between the two teams. First Embiid waved a fouled-out Steven Adams off the court: Then Westbrook returned the favor after Oklahoma City ultimately edged the Sixers 119-117. As for Saturday\u2019s on-court result, Paul George turned up big yet again for OKC with the game-winning 3-pointer 5.1 seconds remaining. The five-time All-Star is averaging career-highs in points (26.7), rebounds (8.0), steals (2.3) and made 3s (3.4) per game. The Thunder and Sixers meet again on Feb. 28, and yes, the game will be nationally televised. A reminder on The Horry Scale: It breaks down a game-winning buzzer-beater (GWBB) in the categories of difficulty, game situation (was the team tied or behind at the time?), importance (playoff game or garden-variety night in January?) and celebration. Then we give it an overall grade on a scale of 1-5 Robert Horrys, named for the patron saint of last-second answered prayers. * * * Buddy Hield was hot, cold and then hot again for the Kings, who remain well within the Western Conference playoff race thanks to his game-winning 3-pointer at Detroit . The play capped off a night in which Hield scored 20 in the first half, went scoreless through for the first 20-plus minutes in the second half, and finally poured in 15 points in the game\u2019s final 3:26. DIFFICULTY: Technically, Hield was triple-teamed on the game\u2019s final play. Yet somehow all three defenders lost him as he stopped through for a leaning, one-handed push shot as time expired. The move and form aren\u2019t ideal, but the shot itself wasn\u2019t nearly as contested as it should have been. That being said, you try and make duplicate that in a game of H-O-R-S-E. GAME SITUATION: With 3.4 seconds remaining on the inbounds play, the Kings had plenty of time for a solid play and a few dribbles to boot. Unfortunately Hield lost his dribble on the pass and was immediately swarmed behind the 3-point arc. With his team down one and time running out, Hield made the most savvy and aware play he could under the circumstances. CELEBRATION: Hield channeled his inner soccer player and sprinted a lap around the court even as his teammates tried to chase him down, which they ultimately did in the locker room. The sequence highlighted the collective youth and renewed energy within the team, which has seen them off to their best start since 2004-05. GRADE: Sacramento needs every win it can get to stay afloat in the competitive West. Hield has been one of the biggest reasons behind the word \u201cwin\u201d being used in Sacramento again. Slap this moment in the Kings\u2019 feel-good scrapbook of 2018-19. Three and a half Horrys . We\u2019re at the point that James Harden putting up 40-plus is more of a thing than an event. The reigning Kia MVP added a 48-point night to his historic run in Houston\u2019s dramatic 138-134 overtime win over the Lakers. Yet it was the other Rockets who made some of the game\u2019s most pivotal plays. PJ Tucker added to his fan favorite status with the kind of hustle and offensive rebounds that kept both fans and teammates engaged. Gerald Green scored eight of his 17 points in the fourth quarter. Eric Gordon poured in 10 points in the five-minute overtime. The Rockets are in full all-hands-on-deck mode without the services of Clint Capela and Chris Paul. In a key Western Conference matchup, Houston saw that call answered. For much of Saturday\u2019s game at Atlanta, it looked like Kyrie Irving would continue to be displeased with the course his team has taken. Boston trailed nearly all of the first three quarters despite 23 first-half points from Irving, who last week called out his younger teammates\u2019 ability to win. A Celtics lineup of Jayson Tatum (20), Jaylen Brown (22), Semi Ojeleye (24), Terry Rozier (24) and Aron Baynes (32) ripped off a 14-4 run to start the fourth quarter, forcing coach Brad Stevens to actually pull Irving back from checking in earlier than he did. The Celtics ultimately pulled away for the 113-105 win. As for Irving, he\u2019s averaging 32.3 points, 11.3 assists and 5.0 rebounds per game while shooting 61 percent from the field and 60 percent from 3. Miami\u2019s living legend continued his swan song season where his life started, putting up 14 points, 10 rebounds and seven assists in his final game at Chicago. The Bulls paid homage to their native son with a look back at this brief time on the team and within the community: Wade in turn honored his hometown team by swapping jerseys not with a player, but with the team\u2019s iconic mascot, Benny the Bull. Neither Luka Doncic nor Deandre Ayton had memorable nights. The Mavs\u2019 lead playmaker was tossed in the third quarter after earning a second technical foul , winding up with eight points on 3-for-14 shooting in Dallas\u2019 111-99 loss to Indiana. Ayton, meanwhile grabbed just two rebounds in 22 minutes before leaving Phoenix\u2019s 135-115 loss to Charlotte with a sprained ankle."},{"id":36224,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/lonzo-ball-injures-ankle-x-rays-negative","date":"2019-01-20","title":"Ball exits after injuring left ankle vs. Rockets","content":"The hits keep coming for the Los Angeles Lakers, who not only lost on Saturday after leading throughout regulation of a 138-134 loss to the Rockets in Houston, but also had to watch point guard Lonzo Ball exit in the third with a left ankle injury.

We look forward to recognizing his prolific career on March 24.\u201d \u201cI am moved beyond words by such a gesture,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI have always held a special place in my heart for the fans who supported the Bucks during my time there. For the organization to honor me this way, means more than words can express. Sometimes it takes being away from a situation to really appreciate what you had. I had long felt a sense of disappointment for falling short of the NBA Finals. What I have come to realize is that the fans of Milwaukee only ask that you play hard and give your best.\u201d Part of one of the most dominating eras of Bucks basketball, Johnson, a four-time All-Star and three-time All-NBA honoree with the Bucks, led Milwaukee to a 347-227 (.605) regular season record and playoff appearances in six of his seven seasons with the team. This included five straight playoff appearances from 1980-84, two Eastern Conference Finals berths in 1983 and 1984 and four consecutive 50-win seasons from 1980-84. Johnson averaged 21.0 points (fourth-highest in team history), 7.5 rebounds and 3.7 assists per game and shot 53.0 percent from the field (fourth-highest in team history) in his time with the Bucks. He ranks among the franchise\u2019s all-time leaders in nearly every statistical category including being sixth in points (10,980), fourth in field goals made (4,546), third in rebounds (3,923), first in offensive rebounds (1,468) and ninth in games played (524). He averaged more than 20.0 points in five seasons and was named to the 1977-78 All-NBA Rookie Team after averaging 19.5 points and 10.6 rebounds per game. Johnson was also a First Team All-NBA pick for the 1978-79 season and a Second Team All-NBA selection after the 1979-80 and 1980-81 seasons. Originally selected by the Bucks with the third overall pick in the 1977 NBA Draft out of UCLA, Johnson won the 1975 NCAA Championship with the Bruins under legendary head coach John Wooden. He was also named the Associated Press and Naismith Men\u2019s College Player of the Year, and won the first-ever John R. Wooden Award following his senior season in 1976-77 in which he averaged 21.4 points and 11.1 rebounds per game. UCLA retired Johnson\u2019s No. 54 in 1996. Currently an Emmy-Award-Winning analyst for Bucks broadcasts on FOX Sports Wisconsin, Johnson is a nominee for the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame, a member of the College Basketball Hall of Fame and will be inducted into the Wisconsin Sports Hall of Fame on Thursday. Johnson\u2019s No. 8 will hang from the Fiserv Forum rafters alongside Oscar Robertson (No. 1), Junior Bridgeman (No. 2), Sidney Moncrief (No. 4), Bob Dandridge (No. 10), Jon McGlocklin (No. 14), Bob Lanier (No. 16), Brian Winters (No. 32) and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (No. 33)."},{"id":36208,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/pelicans-anthony-davis-sidelined-1-2-weeks","date":"2019-01-19","title":"Pelicans' Davis expected to miss 1-2 weeks with finger injury","content":" NEW ORLEANS (AP) \u2014 The New Orleans Pelicans say Anthony Davis has a sprained finger that is expected to sideline him up to two weeks .

So was that of Festus Ezeli, of JaVale McGee, of Anderson Varejao, of Andrew Bogut, of Jordan Bell and, of course, the Zaza. Who will ever forget the Zaza? They were all fine men and devoted teammates who suited up every night at center and did whatever the Golden State Warriors asked of them, which means not much because the demands weren\u2019t, shall we say, steep, or extending beyond what their skills were capable of offering. For the first time since the Warriors began collecting jewelry, they have a body in the middle who could put the other team, and certainly all the referees, on notice almost every night. On Friday, DeMarcus Cousins officially brought his four All-Star honors along with a surgically-repaired Achilles\u2019 tendon to the mix against the Clippers. And the two-time defending champs \u2014 certainly not deprived of talent \u2014 are nonetheless hoping their title chances in the Cousins Era will mirror his first basket of the season: A slam dunk. Cousins made a grand entrance that was 11 months in the planning, roughly the duration of his rehabilitation. Set up perfectly by Kevin Durant on the pick-and-roll just 90 seconds into the game, Cousins took a bounce pass and shook the rim, punctuating the dunk with a satisfying scream and a stinkface for effect. \u201cJust glad to know I can still dunk,\u201d he said. \u201cIt felt good. Never in a million years would I have thought a dunk would be my first basket coming back.\u201d You can understand the outbreak of pent-up emotion. When Cousins fell hard to the floor last January, he was a member of the Pelicans and prepping for a big free agent payday that summer. Sadly, he didn\u2019t get that cash because of the serious injury, and not-so-sadly, he left the Pelicans for the formidable Warriors, who now run out a starting five that have each made multiple trips to the All-Star Game. Cousins is working on the cheap, so to speak, this season, yet has drastically increased his odds of cashing in on his first title by playing alongside Durant, Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green. One night, encouraging as it was \u2014 14 points, six rebounds and 15 not-so-exhausting minutes \u2014 didn\u2019t unlock all the questions swirling around Cousins and his body and how he\u2019ll fit with his decorated teammates and the uptempo style they often play. For the time being, it\u2019ll do . \u201cI felt like a kid on Christmas,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long journey. It was one of the best days of my life being on the floor again playing the game I love. My teammates supported me this entire process. Made it easy as possible for me. They understood my struggle.\u201d Cousins, at age 28, should still be in the prime stage of a solid career \u2014 a center with a collection of offensive skills that set him apart from his peers. Yet he knows all too well about the history of players recovering from such a debilitating injury; only Dominique Wilkins bounced back to All-Star form. Plus, Cousins is a big man carrying a listed 270 pounds. That\u2019s not an obvious recipe for continued of success. With the Warriors, there\u2019s no urgency from a basketball perspective. Golden State won three titles without him and, with him, are heavily favored to add a fourth. He\u2019s a bonus, an insurance policy, or perhaps even a final piece to another celebratory result come June. Between now and then, the Warriors and Cousins will go about the business of searching for a tailored fit. It\u2019s something that coach Steve Kerr says will be a challenge, though a pleasant one, he suspects. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to figure out how all that works with rotations and substitution patterns and ease him back,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cWe\u2019ve already had discussions as a staff and team. We\u2019re just trying to win. That means players have to accept roles and accept that some nights it\u2019s their nights and other nights it\u2019s someone else\u2019s night. As long as we\u2019re in step as a team \u2014 and we\u2019ve established that over the years.\u201d There\u2019s another element at work here: Cousins is playing for money this summer as a free agent. He was in line for a nine-figure payday before his injury, but didn\u2019t receive any offers after, which led him to the Warriors on a one-year deal. Cousins figured if he couldn\u2019t cash in right away, he might as well play for a more economical wage with the league\u2019s best team. Will Cousins put aside personal goals and accept lesser touches for the good of the Warriors and the championship chase? On this team, he might not even be the third option. In that sense, Kerr doesn\u2019t want Cousins to feel any outward pressure to be his pre-injury self right away. \u201cIt\u2019s been a year since his injury but this is almost like training camp,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cThe game is going to be moving fast. He\u2019s got to get his legs, feel comfortable with his new teammates. These things take time. I think that\u2019s the biggest message. This is not the end of the story, it\u2019s the middle of the story. It\u2019s a milestone and there\u2019s a long way to go.\u201d By all accounts, Cousins has the support of the locker room. NBA players are a fraternity and in this case, they know Cousins missed out on riches. They realize the sacrifice he\u2019s making -\u2014 or was forced to make -\u2014 and sympathize. That much was evident a split-second after Cousins\u2019 dunk; the entire Warriors\u2019 bench went airborne in celebration. And after Cousins fouled out, he walked to a bench full of teammates who smothered him with a standing ovation and high fives. He chuckled at that. \u201cProbably the fakest love I ever seen,\u201d he said, laughing. The first game presented the full Cousins experience: Good shots, a few solid plays, and arguing over foul calls. If this is any indication, Cousins will be hard to miss on the floor, even among All-Star teammates And he appears at ease with the Warriors. Over several years, he developed a reputation as a sulking, moody and temperamental star with a Kings franchise that never made the playoffs with him. Part of it was immaturity, which led to suspensions, and part due to the misery of the Kings, who drafted poorly and failed in almost every effort to give Cousins help. He went to a better place after being traded to the Pelicans two Februarys ago, but the injury prevented him from gaining any traction with the Pelicans. With the Warriors and ample talent around him, Cousins feels totally unburdened from expectations. It\u2019s not too unlike his stint with Team USA, in that both the Olympians and the Warriors are embarrassment of riches. Cousins, for instance, was caught off-guard by the lack of defenders thrown his way Friday by the Clippers, who couldn\u2019t afford to leave Thompson or Durant or Curry open. \u201cThis is a first,\u201d Cousins said. \u201cI definitely can get used to this.\u201d There were the expected moments when he stumbled with the ball and was out of sync on the floor. Cousins chalked most of it up to nerves, but also his lack of preparation with the team. \u201cEvery time I touched the ball I felt like I was going to travel, going to trip over my feet,\u201d he said. \u201cI just had to take my time with my decisions. And then I was feeling my rhythm.\u201d He hit three of his four 3-pointers, which shows how easily he can fit right in with the long-ball Warriors if that continues. That\u2019s they lacked in the starting centers who came before him. None were remotely this offensively gifted. \u201cI like that he\u2019s going to keep people honest at the three-point line,\u201d said Durant. \u201cHe was running the floor, setting screens, just playing his game. In 15 minutes, he had 14 points and six rebounds so turn that to 25 minutes, that\u2019s an easy 20 and 10. I like where he\u2019s going. It was a good first step and hopefully he keeps moving forward.\u201d Of course, the next game might not be as friendly for Cousins. Comebacks can turn drastically without much warning; such is the unpredictability of the body and timing and dealing with a new situation. \u201cWe\u2019re all just trying to reassure him that it\u2019s not just about tonight,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cThere will be a lot of criticism and judgments and maybe compliments. He\u2019s going to get a lot of love, or a lot of \u2018Is this a fit?\u2019 One of good things about him being here the first few months, he\u2019s got an up close look at the world we live in, where when we lose a game it\u2019s the end of the world to a lot of people. He\u2019s felt that and he knows the spotlight\u2019s going to be on him, good or bad, and he\u2019s got to take it for what it is.\u201d Said Cousins: \u201cYou get judged by your every moment. As long as the guys in the room know what the situation is and ultimate goal, that\u2019s all that matters.\u201d And then he said something else, something that could send chills around a league that\u2019s already fretting over the Warriors: \u201cWe can get a whole lot better. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

This was DeMarcus Cousins in his first game of the 2018-19 season.  You see that extra fire? Cousins, a motivated star searching for his resurgence , is officially back from an Achilles\u2019 tendon injury, suffered 357 days ago. The skilled center also made his debut as a Golden State Warrior, a long-awaited moment after Cousins relocated to the Bay Area last summer and joined the two-time defending champs. It was an excoriated move, but one he felt was necessary after not receiving the respect \u2015 or more specifically, the money \u2015 he\u2019d hoped for in free agency. In the process, he joined what he believes is the \u201c most hated team in sports \u201d and is not looking back. After months of rehab, Cousins was finally ready to make his first 2018-19 appearance and Golden State was more than ready to unleash him. The Warriors boasted a starting lineup with 25 combined All-Star nods when they tipped off Friday\u2019s game against the LA Clippers at Staples Center. They became the first team since the 1975-76 Boston Celtics to start five players that were All-Stars the previous season. Once the game tipped, Cousins was finding his groove and utilizing his prodigious gifts. In just 15 minutes of action, the Warriors\u2019 new weapon finished with 14 points, six rebounds, three assists, one steal and one block. He also went 3-of-4 from beyond the arc and posted a plus-21 when on the floor. \u201cI felt like a kid on Christmas,\u201d Cousins said after the Warriors\u2019 112-94 triumph . \u201cIt\u2019s been a long journey. This was probably one of the best days of my life.\u201d The 6-foot-11 talent did show some rust to his game, picking up six fouls in 15 minutes. It\u2019s the 50th time of his career he\u2019s fouled out \u2015 more than twice as many times as any other player since he entered the league in 2010 \u2015 but Cousins, in true Cousins fashion, said the referees and new rules are to blame. \u201cThey was hating on me tonight,\u201d he said on the television broadcast. \u201cI gotta get used to this new NBA.\u201d And we have to get used to seeing this:  Much was made about Kyrie Irving publicly lambasting the young members of the Boston Celtics last weekend. The eighth-year point guard apologized to his teammates ( as well as a certain former teammate) and made a tweak to his leadership style. Part of the new approach includes having more trust in a group of teammates that were one win away from the NBA Finals without him, while steadily maintaining the killer instinct that helped earn him a title with the Cleveland Cavaliers. That combination has been on display in the two games since his public critique, and one could argue these are the best consecutive games he\u2019s played this season. The five-time All-Star has registered 29 assists in wins over the Raptors and Grizzlies, the most he\u2019s had in a two-game span since joining the Celtics. In Friday\u2019s contest, Irving showcased a melange of facilitating and scoring while pulling above his average on the glass. The 26-year-old had never posted a stat line with at least 38 points, seven rebounds and 11 assists in his NBA career before Friday. He also became the first Celtics player to put together those totals in a game since Larry Bird in 1992. Seven of Irving\u2019s 11 dimes were on 3-pointers as the point guard was consistently penetrating and kicking it out to teammates on the perimeter. Here\u2019s one to Jaylen Brown\u2026 another to Terry Rozier\u2026  and a behind-the-back beauty to Marcus Smart.  Smart, known more for his rugged defense than his sharpshooting skills, drilled 6-of-8 from 3-point range. A leader elevates his teammates, and a cognizant Irving is doing just that right now. This version of him could be scary.  The Brooklyn Nets are quietly having quite the season. The motivated, contract-year D\u2019Angelo Russell is playing the best ball of his career, the underrated and overlooked Spencer Dinwiddie is putting up Sixth Man of the Year credentials and the fearless, rim-protecting Jarrett Allen has been racking up highlights. Since Dec. 7, the Nets are tied with the Milwaukee Bucks for the best record in the NBA. A significant amount of credit goes to coach Kenny Atkinson, who has directed an improved squad \u2015 Brooklyn has won 16 of 21 since an 8-18 start \u2015 that earned its latest victory in Orlando by erasing a 21-point deficit. Here are four incredible stats: Russell finished the night with 40 points and reached that mark on a cold-blooded 3 with 27.1 seconds left in the game, lifting Brooklyn to a 117-115 win.  Ice in his veins.   The Utah Jazz, one of the more disappointing teams this season, have now won six straight games. Are the gents in Salt Lake City turning their season around the same way they did last year at this time? Let\u2019s see: They\u2019ve beaten the Cavaliers, Clippers, Pistons, Bulls, Lakers and Magic during their recent run. So, close call. The Jazz do have the league\u2019s best defense throughout their winning streak.  Seriously, name one. https:\/\/twitter.com\/warriors\/status\/1086465827178668033  Shai Gilgeous-Alexander on Klay Thompson\u2026  Dwyane Wade on Reggie Jackson\u2026 or Blake Griffin on James Johnson.   Griffin\u2019s smooth, \u201clegal\u201d step-back out of the spin added some extra spice to get my vote.

Veteran guard Rajon Rondo has been cleared to resume full-contact practices, the Lakers announced today . Rondo had missed the last 12 games after suffering a Grade 3 sprain to his right ring finger in a Christmas Day win against Golden State . He had surgery three days after that and was slated to miss four to five weeks with the injury. In that same game, star forward LeBron James suffered a groin strain that has kept him out of the lineup since. James will miss the Lakers\u2019 two-game road trip , but the team announced earlier this week that he has been cleared to return to practice next week . Rondo is averaging 8.4 points, 6.7 assists and 4.4 rebounds while providing solid leadership in his first season with the Lakers, who signed him as a free agent in July.  But the veteran has appeared in only 14 games because of a three-game suspension for fighting and a 17-game absence after breaking a bone in his right hand, an injury that also required surgery. He only returned from his broken hand Dec. 21, playing in three games in five days before getting hurt again. The Lakers have not yet ruled out James for their rematch with the Warriors on Martin Luther King Jr. Day on Monday ( 10:30 ET, TNT ). Coach Luke Walton said he was \u201cencouraged\u201d by James\u2019 level of play during practice on Tuesday. \u201cHe didn\u2019t do the up-and-down stuff, he did the half-court shooting and passing,\u201d Walton said after shootaround. \u201cI just know he seems to be in good spirits.

Prior to this stretch, James had never missed more than 13 games in a row during his 15-year NBA career.

He has never missed a playoff game despite innumerable minor knocks, and he played in all 82 games for the Cavs last season while leading the NBA in minutes played in both the regular season and the postseason. James is the NBA\u2019s sixth-leading scorer with 27.3 points per game along with 8.3 rebounds and 7.1 assists.

Harden did win the NBPA\u2019s first MVP in a vote of his peers, but the sting of losing out to Curry was already there. The place where Harden came up short in both instances was in the narrative department, which, like it or not, has always been a crucial component for the media-panel voters. Westbrook\u2019s campaign came both during his historic (first) triple-double season and immediately after 2014 Kia MVP Kevin Durant bolted for the Warriors in free agency. Curry\u2019s first win was on the strength of his (and the Warriors\u2019 breakout season) that ended a 40-year title drought . His second MVP came as he fueled the Warriors\u2019 record-breaking 73-win season . Truth be told, a large part of Harden\u2019s compelling narrative last season was his previous near-misses (not to mention the Rockets\u2019 wire-to-wire run as the NBA\u2019s best team and their league-best 66 wins ). With the winds changing seemingly by the day in this season\u2019s MVP chase \u2014 thanks to the work Harden and Milwaukee\u2019s Giannis Antetokounmpo are treating fans to \u2014 Harden is crafting yet another gripping drama for voters to consider. Dragging the Rockets from 14th place in the Western Conference standings last month to their current fifth-place perch is a great place to start. Doing it with Chris Paul and other rotation players injured fed the drama. And chasing history \u2014 18 straight games of scoring 30 or more points in a run the league hasn\u2019t seen since Wilt Chamberlain\u2019s days \u2014 always punches up the script. \u201cAll you need is eyeballs to know what\u2019s going on. James has been unbelievable and what he\u2019s done for that team is unreal,\u201d a Western Conference executive said. \u201cThe hard sell this season is in what these guys are doing on the court, both he and Giannis. There really isn\u2019t a need to create some back story for any of these guys, and I include Steph in that as well. He\u2019s on that level, too. There\u2019s plenty of season left, though, for all of these guys. It\u2019s too early to make any final declarations, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Indeed. There is much more season to play out, for the current frontrunners and everyone else. But as they all know, it\u2019s never too soon to start weaving that narrative that might push your campaign over the top. * * * The top five this week in the 2018-19 Kia Race to the MVP Ladder: * * * Last week:  No. 2 Season stats :  35.4 points, 8.5 assists, 6.3 rebounds, 2.0 steals His quest for a back-to-back Kia MVPs is a very real possibility, given Harden\u2019s current performance. He\u2019s on a nuclear run, averaging 40 points per game over his past 20 and scored at least 30 points in 18 straight games , which is the longest streak since the ABA\/NBA merger. He is averaging a bonkers 47.6 points, 9.8 rebounds, 7.6 assists and 2.6 steals in his past five games. His back-to-back games of 58 and 57 points mark the NBA\u2019s first back-to-back 50s since he did it on Dec. 20 and 22 of 2017 . The last time a player posted back-to-back games with 55 or more points was Wilt Chamberlain on Dec. 11 and 14 of 1962 . Harden\u2019s work rate is at an all-time high these days because so much of his usual supporting cast is wounded and\/or unavailable. Chris Paul is still out . Center Clint Capela could miss anywhere from four to six weeks after thumb surgery . If Harden keeps the Rockets in the mix through all of this, it would be hard for anyone to argue against him keeping that MVP trophy he so adores. Last week:  No. 1 Season stats:  26.6 points, 12.8 rebounds, 6.0 assists, 1.5 blocks, 1.3 steals Antetokounmpo has been forced to get his work done in limited minutes recently, what with the Bucks dominating the competition in their past three games. He pounded the Hawks for 33 points in 31 minutes in Sunday\u2019s win in Atlanta. Then, he snagged a 12-point, 10-rebound, 10-assist triple-double in 24 minutes in Tuesday\u2019s annihilation of the Miami Heat. That was followed by 27 points, 11 rebounds, three assists and two blocks in a 22-minute effort to lead a road win Wednesday against the Memphis Grizzlies. Milwaukee\u2019s roll allows coach Mike Budenholzer to ease up on Antetokounmpo\u2019s grind as the trade deadline and NBA All-Star 2019 come into focus. That\u2019s a good thing for \u201cThe Greek Freak,\u201d whether he realizes it or not. Because the load he\u2019ll be asked to carry in the 2019 playoffs trumps anything that\u2019s been asked of him in the past. These Bucks will enter the playoffs with high expectations and Budenholzer will need their catalyst at his healthy best down the stretch of this season. Antetokoumpo must steal moments for a rest wherever he can get them now. Last week:  No. 3 Season stats:  29.8 points, 5.4 assists, 5.2 rebounds, 1.2 steals Harden isn\u2019t the only player on this list making history these days. After roasting the New Orleans Pelicans for 41 points and nine 3-pointers Wednesday , Curry became the first player in NBA history to make eight or more 3-pointers in three straight games . To open 2019, Curry has three 40-point games while averaging 34.1 points (on 50.6 percent shooting and 47.7 percent on 3-pointers), 6.0 assists, 5.3 rebounds and 1.7 steals. The Warriors have won six straight games and expect to welcome DeMarcus Cousins into the starting lineup tonight against the LA Clippers ( 10:30 ET, ESPN ). Any concerns about the Warriors\u2019 focus were answered by Curry and Co. this week. They smoked the Nuggets in Denver in Tuesday\u2019s showdown\/statement game between the West\u2019s top two teams. Curry scored 31 points and went 8-for-13 on 3-pointers to serve notice that he, too, will wage a vigorous MVP campaign of his own as 2018-19 wanes. Last week:  No. 4 Season stats :  27.6 points, 7.9 rebounds, 3.1 assists, 1.5 steals Pascal Siakam rescued the Raptors at the buzzer against Phoenix Thursday night with Leonard in street clothes. That continued Leonard\u2019s season-long trend of not playing on the second night of back-to-back sets. (The Raptors, by the way, are an impressive and NBA-best 8-1 this season in the second night of back-to-backs.) But working without one of the league\u2019s elite two-way players is something Raptors coach Nick Nurse can live with now because he knows he won\u2019t have to do so come playoff time. In fact, preserving Leonard at this time makes sense for a team with designs on a playoff run they hope stretches into June and, thus, The Finals. Those designs are realistic right now because Leonard is on the roster. He\u2019s shown himself to be every bit the difference-maker Raptors boss Masai Ujiri hoped he\u2019d be when he shook the franchise up last summer in trading for him. Leonard\u2019s work this month \u2014 31.6 points on .570 shooting, .364 from deep \u2014 is his best offensive work to date . In all, things are going according to plan. Last week:  No. 7 Season stats:  26.9 point, 13.3 rebounds, 3.5 assists, 2.0 blocks For a player who has missed so much time early in his NBA career, one of the most impressive things Embiid has shown this season is an ability to play through aches and pains. Last night, the Indiana Pacers likely would have rather seen Embiid give his sore lower back. Instead, he wore them out to the tune of 22 points, 13 rebounds, eight assists and three blocks in a huge win. It was both a critical win in the East chase for Philadelphia as well as a chance for Embiid to let the league know exactly where he is at this stage of the process. No offense to Anthony Davis, Nikola Jokic, Rudy Gobert or DeMarcus Cousins, but conversations about the NBA\u2019s best big man cannot be had without mentioning Embiid\u2019s name first. He\u2019s been that good on both ends of the floor this season under all sorts of circumstances, including some choppy nights as he adjusts to life with Jimmy Butler in the fold. * * * 6.

Then we give it an overall grade on a scale of 1-5 Robert Horrys, named for the patron saint of last-second answered prayers. * * * One night after after a slugfest in Boston, the Raptors gave Kawhi Leonard the night off with the Suns in town. Pascal Siakam was happy to pick up the slack, contributing 10 points, 12 rebounds, five assists, two blocks and the Raptors\u2019 first game-winning buzzer beater since 2015. DIFFICULTY: With Leonard unavailable, Raptors coach Nick Nurse put the ball in Siakam\u2019s hands on the final possession. Siakam was checked by Suns rookie Mikal Bridges, who forced Siakam to use his left hand. Still, Siakam bulldozed his way to the rim with the clock winding down, and despite a challenge by Deandre Ayton, was able to bank in the game-winning layup as time expired. The basket was confirmed following a review. GAME SITUATION: After a Devin Booker 3-pointer gave the Suns a 107-105 lead, Siakam sank two free throws to tie the game with 1 minute, 16 seconds remaining. After a defensive stop by the Raptors, Serge Ibaka\u2019s hook shot put Toronto up 109-107. Ibaka then fouled Bridges, who made both free throws with 13 seconds left. CELEBRATION: Siakam\u2019s teammates mobbed him after the shot and the high fives continued down the bench and into the locker room. Siakam said he appreciated the fact that his team entrusted him with the ball with the game on the line. \u201cTo be honest, I didn\u2019t know what I was going to do,\u201d he said. I just had to make sure that I took the last shot.\u201d GRADE: Siakam has been a revelation for the Raptors this season, and he rose to the occasion Thursday night. But with or without Leonard, Toronto shouldn\u2019t need a buzzer beater to beat Phoenix. Two Horrys .  The Lakers pulled off an impressive road victory, defeating the Thunder 138-128 in overtime . Kyle Kuzma led the way with 32 points and Lonzo Ball added 18 points and 10 assists, but the X-factor was Ivica Zubac. The third-year player finished with a career-high 26 points and 12 rebounds in 28 minutes off the bench. LeBron James, who missed his 12th straight game with a left groin strain, could not contain his excitement over Zubac\u2019s performance. Chicago\u2019s Jim Boylen has a reputation for being a hard-nosed coach. He proved he can take a charge in the first quarter of the Bulls\u2019 135-105 loss in Denver. Torrey Craig was trying to save an errant pass from Nikola Jokic from going out of bounds when he fell on top of Boylen after tumbling out of bounds. Boylen, 53, was not injured on the play.

Waiters made the comments to reporters from two South Florida newspapers after Miami\u2019s lopsided loss in Milwaukee on Tuesday night. The Heat were off Wednesday and announced the fine Thursday. \u201cWe fined him and we addressed it as a team,\u201d Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. Waiters has played in five games this season, all as a reserve. He missed just over a full year while recovering from surgery to repair a long-problematic ankle, and has repeatedly said that being patient throughout the process is a challenge for him. \u201cLook, this is going to be very difficult for Dion,\u201d Spoelstra said. \u201cI have empathy for everything he\u2019s gone through in the last year to get back to where he is right now.

And he\u2019s trying to get minutes now with Miami having a slew of wings already in the rotation, including Dwyane Wade, Josh Richardson, Rodney McGruder and Tyler Johnson. Even Wayne Ellington, who set a Heat franchise record for 3-pointers made in a season a year ago, has fallen out of the rotation this year in large part because of Miami\u2019s depth at the wing. Spoelstra said no one is going to volunteer their minutes for Waiters. \u201cWe value him. We need him,\u201d Spoelstra said. \u201cIt won\u2019t be on his terms.

To Cousins, it seems, no team is more disliked than the Warriors. Cousins was recently interviewed by ESPN\u2019s Rachel Nichols and says he has not focused on the reaction from fans since he decided to sign with the Warriors last summer in free agency. \u201cI don\u2019t really pay attention to storylines,\u201d Cousins told ESPN . \u201cI mean, they\u2019re gonna say what they have to say. They\u2019re gonna add their opinions. We\u2019re the most hated team in sports. Cousins has not played since late January of 2018 after being sidelined by an Achilles injury while playing for the New Orleans Pelicans. He was named an All-Star last season, but did not play in the game due to injury, and chose to sign with the Warriors last summer . He is set to debut tomorrow night against the LA Clippers ( 10:30 ET, ESPN ) at Staples Center. When Nichols countered Cousins\u2019 point by saying perhaps the Dallas Cowboys and New York Yankees are among the most hated teams, Cousins laughed and said: \u201cWell, put us up there. I would say the Warriors are for sure. You know they hate Kevin [Durant]. They hate me. I think the only guy they really like is Stephen [Curry]. Actually, they may hate him, as well. They hate Draymond Green. But I mean, it is what it is. I can\u2019t worry about that.\u201d Yahoo Sports\u2019 Chris Haynes reported Thursday that Cousins tried to move his return from injury up a few weeks ago. Per Haynes, Cousins wanted to speed up his timeline to return, but the Warriors wanted to implement a 10-minute playing restriction. Rather than deal with those constraints, Cousins decided to continue his rehab process in order to get his minutes increased upon returning. Cousins told Yahoo Sports he opted not to come back in last night\u2019s game against the Pelicans to avoid a media circus-type atmosphere. \u201cNo, I wasn\u2019t going to return against them,\u201d Cousins told Yahoo Sports before the Warriors\u2019 victory. \u201cI didn\u2019t because I didn\u2019t\u2019 want to give [the media] a storyline. Straight up. You can ask [general manager] Bob [Myers] that. I didn\u2019t want to give y\u2019all a storyline. That\u2019s why [my return] is Friday.\u201d Cousins has made it clear on other occasions he\u2019s not too concerned with fan reaction to his joining Golden State. Days after signing with the Warriors last summer, a teaser for a Showtime documentary about Cousins\u2019 rehab road hit social media. In it, he addressed his return from injury and free agency choice while also not mincing words about his move to California. * Blogtable:  Expectations for Cousins\u2019 return? \u201cI knew how it would be perceived by some \u2026 I don\u2019t give a [expletive],\u201d Cousins said in the video, released on Twitter last July . \u201cThere\u2019s some [expletives] out there that\u2019s ripping their hair out, and I love it. It\u2019s just another test for me to overcome. \u2026 I\u2019m a fighter, I never give up and I\u2019m taking this challenge head on.\u201d Warriors coach Steve Kerr said last week that Cousins will start immediately when he makes his long-awaited Warriors debut. Golden State\u2019s coaching staff has spent the past couple of weeks more intensely planning for Cousins\u2019 return and how he will be incorporated into different rotations throughout games, while also holding regular discussions with Cousins about the plan. Before suffering his injury last season, Cousins averaged 25.2 points, 12.9 rebounds and 5.4 assists in 48 games. The 28-year-old Cousins doesn\u2019t expect to dominate from Day 1, especially playing in a lineup that will feature four other All-Stars \u2014 Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson. Kerr said he hasn\u2019t thought about the star-studded lineup yet, knowing there\u2019s still half the season to go for Cousins to get comfortable and acclimated. In the interview with ESPN, Cousins said Atlanta Hawks legend and Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer Dominique Wilkins was someone he leaned on during his rehab process. Wilkins tore his right Achilles in 1992, but came back in 1992-93 to average 29.9 ppg, which ranked No. 2 in the NBA that season . \u201cHe just basically tells me to attack it,\u201d Cousins said of Wilkins\u2019 advice. \u201cOnce you realize you are healed, like, don\u2019t think about it. Just go forward. \u201cOne thing that Dominique also spoke on is \u2014 they don\u2019t know your heart, and they don\u2019t know your drive. So, you know, the people that do know me, they know I can be very stubborn. I don\u2019t like to be proved wrong.\u201d Cousins told Yahoo Sports that he\u2019s keeping the expectations he has for himself in his return realistic. \u201cMan, I\u2019m coming out and I want to enjoy the game of basketball,\u201d Cousins told Yahoo Sports. \u201cI miss the hell out of it. I\u2019m going to come out and play with joy. I\u2019m going to be happy to be on the floor just playing the game. I\u2019m going to help this team in whatever way I can. I\u2019m going to be a physical force on the boards. I\u2019m going to do what I do. I\u2019m going to do it to the best of my ability. \u201cAs far as trying to come in and be a savior or anything like that, that\u2019s not where my mindset is. It\u2019s about coming in and helping this team win more games and I\u2019m going to do my part.\u201d Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":36272,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/kyrie-irving-called-lebron-james-apologize","date":"2019-01-17","title":"Irving says he called LeBron to apologize, discuss roles as leaders","content":"Kyrie Irving said Wednesday night he called LeBron James after last Saturday\u2019s frustrating loss in Orlando to apologize for how he acted as a young player in Cleveland. \u201cI had to call \u2018Bron, and tell him I apologize for being that young player that wanted everything at his fingertips,\u201d Irving said after the Celtics beat the Toronto Raptors 118-107 on Wednesday night . \u201cI wanted to be the guy that led us to a championship. I wanted to be the leader. I wanted to be all that.\u201d Irving admitted he \u201cshould have kept it in house\u201d when criticizing his younger teammates after the loss to the Magic. \u201cI did a poor job of setting an example for these young guys what it\u2019s like to get something out of your teammates,\u201d he said. \u201cGoing forward, I want to test these young guys, but I can\u2019t do it publicly. That was a learning experience for me, realizing the magnitude of my voice and what I mean to these guys.\u201d And that also made him realize that he owed James an apology for bristling when the star returned from Miami to a Cleveland team that Irving had come to think of as his own. \u201cHe\u2019s been in this situation, been there with me, where I\u2019ve been the young guy, been the 22-year-old kid, wanting everything, wanting everything right now,\u201d Irving said. \u201cThe responsibility of being the best player in the world and leading a team is something that\u2019s not meant for many people.

Kanter said he feared he could be attacked or killed over his opposition to Turkey President Recep Tayyip Erdogan if he were to travel to London. Istanbul-based newspaper Daily Sabah reported that an arrest warrant was issued for Kanter by Turkish prosecutors on Wednesday. Silver said NBA officials never suggested that Kanter skip the game but understand why he chose not to travel. \u201cThere are significant issues that he is dealing with, and I recognize that for the NBA, by virtue of the fact that we\u2019re a global business, we have to pay a lot of attention to those issues as well,\u201d Silver said. \u201cI will say there\u2019s nothing more important to me, as the commissioner of the league, the safety and security of our players, and so we take very seriously the threats that he has received, (even if) it\u2019s just people on social media. \u201cAgain, I support Enes, a player in this league, and I support the platform that our players have to speak out on issues that are important to them.\u201d The Daily Sabah reported that Turkish prosecutors are seeking an Interpol \u201cred notice,\u201d which is an international request for arrest and extradition, for Kanter, who was accused of membership in a terror organization. He was said to have provided financial support to exiled Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, who has been blamed by the Turkish government as being responsible for a failed coup in Turkey in 2016. The Associated Press has been unable to independently verify those reports. Kanter said Wednesday on Twitter that the Turkish government could not present \u201cany single piece of evidence of my wrongdoing\u201d and that he doesn\u2019t \u201ceven have a parking ticket in the U.S.\u201d Kanter, who has frequently criticized Erdogan, has had his Turkish passport revoked. He noted in an op-ed he wrote for The Washington Post earlier this week that he does not yet have U.S. citizenship or a U.S. passport \u2013 either of which would offer him greater legal protection. He learned of the cancellation of his Turkish passport on May 20, 2017, when he was detained in Bucharest, Romania, upon returning from a trip to Indonesia to run a basketball camp for his charitable foundation. He was later granted safe passage to London before returning to the United States. Turkey has insisted on numerous occasions that its detention of academics and activists for allegedly supporting anti-government protests, which have intensified following the failed coup, are an important part of its fight against extremist groups. \u201cErdogan is doing whatever he can, such as using institutions like the Interpol to execute his brutal international policy of persecution against his critics, including abductions and kidnappings of innocent Turkish people living abroad,\u201d Celine Assaf Boustani, an international lawyer at the Human Rights Foundation, told The Associated Press. \u201cInterpol should reject Turkey\u2019s request to issue a red notice arrest warrant for Kanter and uphold its constitution, which strictly forbids Interpol to undertake any politically motivated intervention or activity.\u201d Kanter, who had played in every Knicks game this season until missing the last two with an illness, is averaging 14.4 points and a team-high 11 rebounds. Several of his teammates were reluctant to address the situation when asked before the Knicks\u2019 practice on Wednesday, though forward Kevin Knox called it \u201cunfortunate.\u201d \u201cObviously, we miss him, but that\u2019s a decision that we respect and understand and we\u2019ll be happy to see him when we get back,\u201d coach David Fizdale said. Meanwhile, Silver, speaking ahead of the ninth regular-season game in London, said the NBA is considering moving the game to Paris next year. \u201cI\u2019m told I\u2019m not allowed to break news today, but yes, it is possible,\u201d Silver said, smiling. \u201cParis has traditionally been a very important market for the NBA \u2026 and we\u2019re looking forward to coming back to Paris.\u201d"},{"id":36275,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/all-star-voting-2019-third-returns-official-release","date":"2019-01-17","title":"2019 All-Star Draft to air February 7 on TNT","content":" NEW YORK \u2014 The NBA announced today that the 2019 NBA All-Star Draft will be televised by TNT on Thursday, Feb. 7 at 7 p.m. ET .

But really now, who\u2019s dealing with pain \u2014 him or his teammates? The Lakers are 4-7 without James, and lost at home to the likes of the bottom-feeding New York Knicks and Cleveland Cavaliers . They have appeared foggy at times while shooting poorly at others, yet because LeBron does so much for them, maybe this shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise. Or should it? While waiting for LeBron to get the medical green light to suit up \u2014 he\u2019s skipping this current road trip to Oklahoma City and Houston \u2014 there are two very evident Lakers issues that a healthy LeBron covered up for the season\u2019s first two months: 1. They didn\u2019t add all the necessary pieces to this team besides LeBron last offseason. 2. Their young core hasn\u2019t developed as much as projections. The first factor is the least important. When they remodeled the team last summer, the Lakers had one priority besides signing LeBron: maintaining future salary-cap flexibility. That meant one-year contracts for any free agents and no trades for players whose contracts would extend multiple years for big dollars. Refuting either would potentially crimp the Lakers\u2019 chances of attacking marquee free agents in 2019, when Kevin Durant and Kawhi Leonard (among others) hit the market . This philosophy was sound, then and now. They would\u2019ve bent this rule for Paul George last summer, but he stayed in Oklahoma City. Why would the Lakers lock themselves into players who could limit their odds of adding one or maybe two A-list names this July? The downside for this budget-minded approach was the Lakers were forced to load up on marginal veterans riding out their sunset years. JaVale McGee, Rajon Rondo, Lance Stephenson, Tyson Chandler and Michael Beasley came cheap and can easily be discarded next summer if better options come along. This group as a whole, though, has produced fairly well \u2014 or as solid as expected (especially Rondo and McGee). Notice, though, that there isn\u2019t a shooter in the group to help fix the Lakers\u2019 biggest weakness (they rank 28th in 3-point field goal percentage ). Yet, this is the failing of team president Magic Johnson and GM Rob Pelinka \u2026 to an extent anyway. Before laying the criticism too thick on the Lakers\u2019 braintrust, understand that Johnson and Pelinka weren\u2019t working with much last summer on the market. Perhaps the only established free-agent shooter who would possibly meet the Lakers\u2019 guidelines was Marco Belinelli, who signed with the San Antonio Spurs instead . The more alarming problem here in LeBron\u2019s absence is the lack of player development. Except for Kyle Kuzma, what young Laker is good enough to ride shotgun with LeBron? In the 11 games without an injured LeBron, the Lakers\u2019 youngsters have collectively looked uninspired. Good stretches and good moments are quickly followed by lapses and mistakes. Kuzma, Lonzo Ball, Brandon Ingram and Josh Hart are all 23 and under and wi th that comes inconsistency. Yet when you add LeBron and invite championship talk in the very near future, the developmental clock \u2014 fair or not \u2014 runs faster. The Lakers are still waiting for someone to have a breakout season. \u201cI believe in this group,\u201d said Lakers coach Luke Walton, and yet there are concerns as well. Here\u2019s a look at how each youngster is fairing \u2026 * * * Lonzo Ball:  Playing point guard next to LeBron might be the NBA\u2019s toughest position, as you are no longer the best option with the ball. It\u2019s even more of a challenge for Ball because he can\u2019t shoot. He\u2019s not, for example, Mario Chalmers, who could play off the ball and therefore made it work with LeBron on the Miami Heat. Ball is often left standing on the perimeter, where he\u2019s not a threat, while LeBron runs the offense. When he does have the ball, Ball rarely attacks the rim and draws contact, which is probably just as well, because he\u2019s shooting 42 percent from the free throw line, by far the lowest among NBA guards. His court vision remains sharp, he ranks No. 8 among guards in rebounds per game (5.4) , and is on pace to demolish his steals total from last season (88). Brandon Ingram:  Of all the young players, the Lakers have more riding on Ingram if only because he\u2019s a year beyond the others and therefore is extension-eligible this summer. The Lakers need to see growth and know what they have in Ingram to make a smart money decision come July. The returns on Ingram after two-plus months is mixed. He\u2019s wiser with the ball around the basket, but his 3-point shooting (30 percent) has fallen off after a career-best 39 percent last season. Walton singled out Ingram (and Ball) last week about his lack of intensity. Overall, Ingram remains a puzzle. Is he a keeper who can be an important piece for a contender, or someone to be dealt before the deadline? Another scenario has the Lakers extending Ingram this summer and then including him in a package to the New Orleans Pelicans for Anthony Davis should he turn down the a super-max extension this summer. Josh Hart:  At times this season, Hart was the best shooter among the young bunch. He has started 20 games this season, but his stats have cooled after a solid October ( 11.9 ppg, 40.5 3-point percentage ) to 7.8 ppg and 17.5 3-point percentage this month . The Lakers value his toughness, and he\u2019s shooting 34.6 percent this season on 3-pointers. In terms of his ceiling, Hart appears to be a very good role player and an asset off the bench.  Kyle Kuzma:  His 41 points against the Pistons last week was not only the most impactful non-LeBron game by any Laker, but one of the most efficient in the NBA this season. Kuzma chopped up the Pistons in 29 minutes, going 16-for-24 \u2026 and then went 4-for-18 in a loss to the Utah Jazz . He\u2019s young and inconsistent, but at least Kuzma\u2019s lapses aren\u2019t as vast. When LeBron is healthy, Kuzma found a useful role finishing plays and saw shots caused by double-teams on LeBron. He\u2019s averaging 18.7 ppg and has averaged 20.8 ppg since Christmas . * * * LeBron\u2019s longest extended absence due to injury came in 2014-15, when he missed eight games due to back and knee aches. James is 34 now and his latest absence could be a sign of what may be a new normal for him as he ages \u2014 no matter how much injury-prevention training he does. That makes it more urgent for Kuzma, Ball and Ingram to step forward. Even if the Lakers land another star this summer to become a more serious title threat, they\u2019re on the clock with LeBron. And it won\u2019t restart until at least two more games, if not more. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr, for one, thinks so. \u201cHe\u2019s a brilliant player. I think he\u2019s already an All-Star,\u201d Kerr said earlier this week. \u201cI don\u2019t know how the vote\u2019s gonna shake out, but he looks like an All-Star player to me.\u201d The fans, too, think he\u2019s ready. The NBA released the second returns of fan voting last week, and the Dallas Mavericks\u2019 rookie (2,220,077) trails only LeBron James (2,779,812) among Western Conference frontcourt players. The fan vote is only part of the equation, though, with media votes and player votes also weighing into the calculations. If Doncic is voted an All-Star, he\u2019ll be the first rookie since Blake Griffin in 2011 to make the team. Yao Ming also did it during his first season in 2003 . Doncic could secure his spot by winning the fan vote, but he\u2019d have to make up more than 500,000 votes to pass James. If that were to happen, Doncic would be team captain for the West and select his roster for the Feb. 17 All-Star Game. Fans have until Monday, Jan. 21 to cast their votes and assure Doncic\u2019s All-Star spot. * * * Last week:  No. 1 In three games this week, Doncic put up some ridiculous numbers, averaging 26.7 points, 7.3 rebounds and 8.3 assists while shooting 45.2 percent. Doncic just doesn\u2019t seem to be slowing down or showing any signs of fear. In fact, his numbers in the clutch are putting him in rare company. Per Basketball-Reference.com (via Zach Kram of The Ringer ), Doncic leads all players with 16 shots to tie or take the lead in the final five minutes and has a 60.9 percent effective FG percentage. Last week:  No. 2 The Suns got one of their biggest wins of the season this week, beating the Nuggets 102-93 on Saturday, and Ayton was right in the middle of it. The big man had 22 points, 13 rebounds and three blocks. It was his most blocks since Dec. 26, and the defensive effort was crucial in slowing Denver. \u201dWe were the aggressors today,\u201d Ayton said. \u201dThat\u2019s the main part of it.\u201d For a guy who\u2019s had some dud games (like last Wednesday\u2019s six-point outing in 20 minutes ), the increased effort is a welcome sight. Last week:  No. 3 OK, it looks like the Hawks\u2019 franchise point guard is for real. After struggling mightily with his shot to begin the season, Young seems to be getting more comfortable finding his spots. This week, Young helped the Hawks to two huge wins. First, he scored 18 (hitting 3 of 8 3-pointers) as Atlanta won 123-121 in Philadelphia . Then, Young had a monster showing, scoring 24 and handing out 11 assists in a 142-126 win against Oklahoma City in Dennis Schroder\u2019s return to Atlanta. Young was 4-for-9 from beyond the arc and scored 13 in the fourth quarter to seal the win. Last week:  No. 4 Knox and the Knicks only had two games this week, thanks to a trip to London for Thursday\u2019s game against the Wizards ( 3 ET, NBA TV ). Still, Knox had one of his best games of the year, scoring 31 points in Sunday\u2019s 108-105 loss to the Sixers . That showing put the 19-year-old in rare company, as he became the youngest Knicks player to score 30 and sixth-youngest player in NBA history to do so (joining Kobe Bryant, Devin Booker, Jaren Jackson Jr., Kevin Durant and LeBron James). Last week:  Not ranked Huerter is emerging as a serious scoring threat, and he and Young are forming a nice connection as Atlanta has seen a mini-resurgence. In three games this week, Huerter averaged 19 points on 55.6 percent shooting (57.1 percent on 3s). The No. 19 pick out of Maryland is really finding his groove and has scored in double figures in eight straight . * * * Rodions Kurucs, Brooklyn Nets Kurucs has scored in double digits in four of his last five and was huge in helping the Nets win against the Celtics (19 points on 7-for-11 shooting) on Monday and Rockets (14 points on 7-for-12 shooting) on Wednesday. Collin Sexton, Cleveland Cavaliers Sexton helped the Cavs end a 12-game losing streak by scoring 17 (on 7-for-14 shooting) in a 101-95 win over the Lakers in L.A. , but it was the single turnover in 33 minutes that most pleased coach Larry Drew. \u201dHe made some really good decisions,\u201d Drew said. \u201dHe made some really smart plays that probably a month ago he probably wouldn\u2019t make, so I saw growth tonight.\u201d M arvin Bagley III, Sacramento Kings Bagley has been solid since returning last week after missing 11 games with a bone bruise in his knee. The No. 2 pick has averaged 10.5 points and 8.3 rebounds in four games, including a 13-point, 11-rebound showing Monday in Portland for his fifth double-double. The Kings are currently two games over .500 and one game back of No. 8 in the West, so Bagley\u2019s emergence could help them rise up the standings. Jaren Jackson Jr., Memphis Grizzlies In three games this week, Jackson averaged 10.7 points, 5.3 rebounds, 1.7 steals and two blocks. But Memphis is in a tailspin, having lost all three of those contests and nine of its last 10. With the trade deadline fast approaching, it will be interesting to see what path Memphis takes \u2014 do they deal their veterans and turn the reins over to JJJ, or do they stand pat? Josh Okogie, Minnesota Timberwolves Okogie has seen his playing time increase over the last few weeks, and he had a pair of double-digit scoring games this week while getting a steal in all three games. He had 15 points in 23 minutes in a 119-115 loss to Dallas , then put up 17 points and five rebounds to help the Wolves rally past the Pelicans 110-106 . For a guy who\u2019s making his mark with his energy and defense, those offensive numbers are just gravy. * * * ( All stats through Wednesday, Jan. 16 ) Send any qfuestions or comments to my email or find me on Twitter @drewpackham .

Kyrie Irving would like to have a word: That, ah \u2026 expressive moment came after he nailed a dagger three over Kawhi Leonard in the final two minutes of a 117-108 victory over Eastern Conference power Toronto. The emphatic win, which came during a maladroit stretch for the Celtics, served notice that \u2014 on this night or any night to come after April \u2014 they\u2019re not to be quickly dismissed from the contending conversation. And we might have LeBron to thank. Really. After the game, Irving admitted he called his former teammate for advice, having realized he knew no one more familiar with the responsibility of leading young players toward their championship aspirations. \u201cHe\u2019s been in the situation,\u201d said Irving , who scored 27 points and dished out a career-best 18 assists. \u201c[LeBron\u2019s] been there with me being the young guy, a 22-year-old kid and wanting to have everything, and wanting everything right now.\u201d (For the record: They\u2019re good, him and \u2018Bron. Irving said so.) One game doesn\u2019t prove the Celtics are all the way out of what, at times, has felt like a season-long rut. But, considering the competition and stakes in the moment, it\u2019s tough to undersell the impact. Seasons slip away fast. At the very least, Boston\u2019s found purchase for a next step. We\u2019ll soon find out if it\u2019s a foot planted forward. Even if they regress, not sure I\u2019d recommend any Eastern opponent start lining up a seed to see them in seven. Against the Nets on Wednesday, James Harden scored 30-plus for the Rockets \u2026 again. (Yawn. Somehow a yawn. SMH.) His streak of 18 straight ties Elgin Baylor for fifth-most all-time, behind Wilt (20), Wilt Chamberlain (21), Wilt (31) and Wilt (65). But he didn\u2019t stop there as Harden scored 50-plus \u2026 again. Back-to-back games! He\u2019s the only NBA player to achieve the feat since 2008, and he\u2019s now done it twice (previously Dec. 20 & 22, 2017). Wednesday\u2019s 58-point season-high marks four 50s on this iteration of the schedule, most in a single season since Kobe dropped 10 half-centurys in 2006-07. Overall, it\u2019s 13 for the career books, one ahead of LeBron among the active elite. And yet, Harden\u2019s night ended in frustration after slights both personal: \u2026 and of the team variety. Houston coughed up a 13-point lead in the final 4 minutes of regulation, then faded in overtime after opening a seven-point margin, as both teams combined to launch an NBA record 106 3-point attempts.

James was re-evaluated on Wednesday, which is the three-week mark since he injured his groin against the Golden State Warriors on Christmas Day. After the re-evaluation, the Lakers announced James was cleared to return to practice next week. The Lakers have not yet ruled out James for their rematch with the Warriors on Martin Luther King Jr. Day on Monday ( 10:30 ET, TNT ). Coach Luke Walton said he was \u201cencouraged\u201d by James\u2019 level of play during practice on Tuesday. \u201cHe didn\u2019t do the up-and-down stuff, he did the half-court shooting and passing,\u201d Walton said after shootaround. \u201cI just know he seems to be in good spirits. He\u2019s got another test tomorrow to get some more information on it. \u201cI think we\u2019ll get good news back.\u201d The injury has proven to be one of the most significant of James\u2019 career. If you include this week\u2019s games against the Thunder and Rockets, James will have missed 13 games because of the injury. Prior to this stretch, James had never missed more than 13 games in a row during his 15-year NBA career. The Lakers and James, who turned 34 last month, are being prudent with this injury to a star famous for playing through all types of physical ailments, both major and minor. He has never missed a playoff game despite innumerable minor knocks, and he played in all 82 games for the Cavs last season while leading the NBA in minutes played in both the regular season and the postseason. Before his injury, James was off to yet another outstanding start in his first season with the Lakers, who are a playoff contender after missing the postseason in a franchise-record five consecutive years. James is the NBA\u2019s sixth-leading scorer with 27.3 points per game along with 8.3 rebounds and 7.1 assists. The Lakers (24-21) began Wednesday in eighth place in the Western Conference standings after beating Chicago on Tuesday night to improve to 4-7 in James\u2019 absence.

He could call or text his peers in the Eastern Conference with a gentle nudge in Dwyane Wade\u2019s direction for when they flesh out their All-Star ballots later this month in choosing the East\u2019s seven reserve spots. The Miami Heat coach could do that. But he won\u2019t. \u201cI\u2019m not that kind of guy,\u201d Spoelstra said Tuesday morning, before his team faced the Bucks at Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee. \u201cIt would come across so shocking and probably disingenuous. When I receive those emails that are not written by the coach, just cookie-cutter letters, I kind of roll my eyes.\u201d If Spoelstra, who loves Wade, can\u2019t get sentimental over his veteran player\u2019s prospects to play in the 2019 All-Star Game , he\u2019s not about to lobby the other 14 who\u2019ll hold power over Wade\u2019s 13th selection. Especially since Wade isn\u2019t feeling it, either, in what he\u2019s announced as his final season. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter to me,\u201d the 12-time All-Star said. \u201cOne last hurrah is not going to make or break what I feel about my career. I\u2019ll be down there anyway.\u201d There still is a chance that Wade could be voted in as a starter. He ranked second among East guards through the second week of fan voting results , behind only Kyrie Irving. Fan balloting, which will account for 50 percent of each player\u2019s total, ends Jan. 21. NBA players (25 percent) and media (25 percent) also will contribute to the selection of starters, to be announced Jan. 24. Then the coaches\u2019 choice of reserves will come Jan. 31. \u201cI think it\u2019s cool from a fan perspective who love this game,\u201d Wade added, \u201cthat they have so many favorite players that they always want to see \u2018em on that stage. [But] when it comes to the All-Star, you want the guys that deserve to be an All Star, the best first half of the season, to be able to go and live out a dream. I had that opportunity multiple times.\u201d The dream Wade is living out now is about the 40 games left on Miami\u2019s schedule, plus any postseason. When this is over, it\u2019s over, Father Prime cleaning out his desk and clocking out for Father Time. This last lap through the league has been a season unlike any other for Wade, and for those inside and outside the Heat organization who admire the 6-foot-4 guard and the career he\u2019s built over the past 16 years. \u201cA lot of guys in this locker room are going to be as sad and emotional as him on the last game,\u201d teammate James Johnson said after Miami\u2019s 124-86 loss to the Bucks. \u201cThe fight\u2019s still there. It sounds crazy, but I\u2019m not the only one who notices it \u2013 his want to still get better. And help everybody else get better at the same time.\u201d The native of Robbins, Ill., south of Chicago \u2013 and arguably the greatest pro athlete in south Florida\u2019s history \u2013 has crafted highlights and memories everywhere he\u2019s gone in this league. But Milwaukee, if not first among equals, ranks near the top for him as far as NBA opponents\u2019 venues and crowds. It\u2019s where he went to college, at the Marquette University campus that\u2019s a Steph Curry 3-pointer to the west. It\u2019s where he played, sort of; the Bucks and the Golden Eagles shared MECCA till 1988, then Bradley Center through last season and now Fiserv. Wade never had competed at the city\u2019s new downtown arena before Tuesday, but as he spoke courtside with reporters in the morning, a banner with his No. 3 Marquette jersey hung in the rafters directly overhead.  \u201cI always talk about coming to Marquette \u2013 many years ago now \u2013 with a hope and a dream,\u201d Wade said. \u201cHoping to become good enough to play at the next level, and I was able to accomplish that. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of memories coming back. Played in the Bradley Center a lot, a lot more memories [there].\u201d Wade played just two seasons at Marquette, but left his mark. Especially in 2002-03 when he averaged 21.5 points and led the school to its third Final Four, and first since Al McGuire\u2019s 1977 championship \u201clast hurrah.\u201d The program had produced some solid professional players during and immediately after McGuire\u2019s heady 13-year run, including Maurice Lucas, Jim Chones, Dean Meminger and Doc Rivers. But in the 20 years after Rivers was drafted in 1983, only five Marquette players got a sniff in the NBA. Starting with Wade, who was the No. 5 pick in 2003, eight players from the program have been drafted, including Wesley Matthews, Jae Crowder and Jimmy Butler, and 14 have drawn NBA paychecks of some duration. \u201cIt was really cool early in his career when coach [Tom] Crean was still at Marquette,\u201d Spoelstra said. \u201cHe\u2019d come to our shootarounds and our practices, and you could just feel the legacy that Dwyane had created.\u201d In years past, the Heat often would hold practices on the Marquette campus in a nod to Wade\u2019s roots and as a moment for his younger teammates. \u201cFor guys to see that connection,\u201d the Miami coach said. This time, Wade got to town the day after the demolition of Bradley Center went public with an impressive implosion of the building\u2019s roof. Wade watched video of it with Johnson. Imagine your old grade school being razed, or seeing your favorite playground turned into a shopping mall. \u201cIt was a little emotional,\u201d Wade said. \u201cThere was a lot of memories go in that explosion for me, y\u2019know?\u201d Wade and his team won\u2019t like the memory they made Tuesday in the new place. In the final game of his 36th year \u2013 Wade turns 37 Thursday \u2013 he entered to a loud cheer midway through the first quarter and stuck around for 10 minutes, then came back for the final 94 seconds. He played another 11 minutes after halftime, but it was hopeless. \u201cAn onslaught,\u201d Spoelstra called it, as the Heat fell to 21-21. Wade finished with nine points on 4-of-7 shooting, with three rebounds and four assists. (He came up empty in the one stat that still intrigues him: Wade needs 28 blocked shots in the final 40 games to match Michael Jordan\u2019s record for guards of 893.) That\u2019s the side of the ball that speaks to Milwaukee coach Mike Budenholzer. \u201cHe does amazing things on the biggest stages,\u201d Budenholzer said. \u201cBe it a postseason game or a regular season game, when he dials it up defensively. It\u2019s amazing some of the things he can do. Whether it be blocking shots or getting into the passing lanes and getting steals. His athleticism, his anticipation \u2026 I\u2019ve been on the wrong side of those steals too many times.\u201d Wade is averaging 13.8 points, 3.5 rebounds and 3.9 assists in 25.3 minutes, shooting 42.2 percent overall. His per-36 numbers have been solid \u2013 19.8 points, 4.9 rebounds, 5.5 assists \u2013 but his efficiency rating is low for him and his days of dominating games by getting to the line are over. He plays now more in the service of the other Heat players, running dribble handoffs for the big men, spacing the floor as much as he can as an average 3-point shooter. He\u2019s no longer what Johnson called \u201cthe always-aggressive D-Wade.\u201d  \u201cThe thing is playing a different role, playing with different guys,\u201d Wade said. \u201cI\u2019m not necessarily always playing to my strengths. I\u2019m playing to their strengths.\u201d The Heat and the Bucks play twice more this season, including March 22 in what looms as Wade\u2019s final regular-season game in Milwaukee. Given the uncertainty of injuries and playoff seedings, though, the teams might meet several more times on the Bucks court. Or the game Tuesday could have been his last there. He swapped jerseys after the game, as has become his custom, with Bucks veteran George Hill. Wade will be back at Fiserv Sunday, when Marquette \u2013 at current coach Steve Wojciechowski\u2019s urging \u2013 honors their greatest hoops alumnus. After Miami plays at Detroit Friday and at Chicago Saturday the entire team will bus to Milwaukee for the school\u2019s 11 a.m. matinee against Providence. Only after a ceremony saluting Wade will the Heat head to Boston for its game Monday. \u201cI was flattered,\u201d Wade said. \u201cJust to be able to come back here and create another memory, another moment, with a total different group of guys, with a different student body. So I\u2019m humbled and appreciative of the opportunity on Sunday to say \u2018Thank you\u2019 once again for all the support.\u201d Miami hasn\u2019t been happy with its record, weighed down by wasted opportunities against mediocre foes. Wade has had his moments, but mostly he has looked like a soon-to-turn-37 perimeter player. Will this farewell season be memorable? \u201cI dunno,\u201d Spoelstra said, \u201cbut I\u2019ll be telling Dwyane Wade stories for the rest of my coaching career. And how he was willing to sacrifice and do different things for the betterment of the team.\u201d Wade said that, even on such a moribund night as Tuesday, his commitment to see this through hasn\u2019t wavered. For 22 minutes, he was able to lose himself in the game that largely has defined him, certainly brought him most of what\u2019s good in his life. \u201cThere are other guys in there who are going to carry this loss, and coach is going to, more than I will,\u201d Wade said. \u201cI\u2019m on the downside now. There\u2019s only 40 games left in my basketball life. For me, I\u2019m just enjoying the process. \u201cThis is probably our third one like this. It\u2019s going quick. We\u2019ll be at the All-Star break before we know it, and it\u2019s downhill from there.\u201d * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Sabah newspaper says the Istanbul chief prosecutor\u2019s office had also prepared an extradition request for the NBA player. Officials at the prosecutor\u2019s office could not be reached by The Associated Press for comment. Kanter, who didn\u2019t go with the Knicks this week for their game in London because he feared he could be killed over his opposition to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, responded on Twitter that the Turkish government could not present \u201cany single piece of evidence of my wrongdoing.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t even have a parking ticket in the U.S.,\u201d he wrote Wednesday.

Kanter said he feared assassination if he left the U.S. or Canada when he announced last week that he wouldn\u2019t travel with the Knicks, who play the Washington Wizards at The O2 Arena on Thursday. The team said at the time Kanter wouldn\u2019t make the trip because of a visa issue.

And a learning curve for all involved that will last until the All-Star break . Incorporating an elite big man with an offensive game to attend to will take time, patience and some sacrifice. Draymond Green, Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant grace the biggest adjustments in minutes, touches and pecking order, respectively. As we head toward spring, though, they\u2019ll figure it out and become, potentially, frightening. Shaun Powell : Expectations for Warriors fans, who happened to be a bit spoiled? Around 25 points and 15 rebounds a night. Oh, wait: Realistic? I suspect the Warriors won\u2019t throw much toward DeMarcus Cousins right away in terms of minutes and role ; that will evolve over time, depending on how his body adjusts. Besides, they\u2019re not exactly starving for his production. That said, he\u2019ll be the best big man in the Steve Kerr era merely by suiting up. And if he can be the antidote for Nikola Jokic should the West come down to a Warriors-Nuggets showdown, then that\u2019ll be good enough. John Schuhmann :  The primary hope has to be that he doesn\u2019t disrupt things. The Warriors\u2019 offense is on fire, having scored more than 128 points per 100 possessions as they\u2019ve won seven of their last eight games . On Tuesday, the Nuggets, a top-10 defensive team, couldn\u2019t keep up with the ball and player movement, which didn\u2019t stop until the ball was going through the net. You have to think that the movement will be affected by the presence of Cousins, who\u2019s a good passer, but not necessarily a good fit with how the Warriors move. On defense is where the Warriors actually need some help right now ( they rank 16th on that end of the floor overall and 18th since Christmas ), but will he be moving well enough to defend effectively? No matter what, it will be fascinating to watch. Sekou Smith : Since when do the Warriors and \u201creasonable\u201d go together? They jumped that shark after the 73-win season. But I\u2019ll definitely play along here. The most reasonable expectation for the Warriors with Boogie Cousins in the fold is the same expectation we all had for them without that fifth All-Star in the starting lineup. The road to a championship goes through Oakland. Someone has to vanquish the champs to take what is theirs. Cousins could be the jolt to the system this Warriors team has been searching for to get them back on that otherworldly level they\u2019ve played on in recent seasons. Steve Kerr has already made it clear that there will be no easing Boogie into the mix. If he\u2019s starting in his debut, it\u2019s pretty obvious the Warriors are going for broke right from the very start."},{"id":36304,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-are-celtics-danger","date":"2019-01-16","title":"Blogtable: Have Celtics entered crisis mode?","content":" * * * Real or mirage: The Celtics are in danger of falling into the bottom half of the Eastern Conference bracket. * * * Steve Aschburner :  Real. There are five teams vying for the top four slots in the East. Boston\u2019s embarrassment of riches in talented players won\u2019t save them from slipping to the bottom of that pack if they don\u2019t figure out how to put the good of the group first. Seeing as how the Celtics\u2019 best player, Kyrie Irving, landed there because he essentially had that issue in Cleveland, it\u2019s possible they don\u2019t figure it out by the end of 82. I think they will and expect to see Philadelphia opening the playoffs on the road. But going seven games in the conference finals last season assures Boston of nothing. Shaun Powell :  Aren\u2019t they already there, or close enough? What really matters is where the Celtics are come April. If they\u2019re still looking up to the Pacers, for example, then there\u2019s some issues here and this is no disrespect to Indiana. That\u2019s not the ideal way to go into the playoffs \u2014 no home court advantage and a measure of doubt. John Schuhmann :  They\u2019re already there! It\u2019s definitely a surprise to see the Celtics in fifth place this late in the season. But with all the angst about roles and all the ups and downs with their offense, the Celtics have the league\u2019s third best point differential , that of a team that\u2019s 31-12 instead of 25-18. Part of that comes from four wins by 28 points or more (including one by 56) against the three worst teams in the East, but a good point differential is a good thing and the Celtics\u2019 mediocre record (10-10) in games that were within five points in the last five minutes should improve over the second half of the season. Of course, the four Eastern Conference teams ahead of them in the standings are all really good, so there\u2019s no guarantee that improvement from the Celtics will lead to a top-four seed. Boston, Indiana and Philadelphia all have similarly tough schedules going forward. (The Raptors have the easiest remaining schedule among the East\u2019s top five.) Sekou Smith :  Mirage. Things are sticky right now in Boston. There is clearly a disconnect in that locker room right now that has to be remedied sooner rather than later. But I don\u2019t think the Celtics are in danger of falling out of the playoff mix in the Eastern Conference. They are, however, already stumbling out of the position that should be non-negotiable, given all of the talent on the roster. The Celtics needing to chase the top four pack in the standings is an insult to the work Danny Ainge and Co. have done compiling talent and assets. The depth and versatility on the roster should have made this kind of slide impossible. But again, that disconnect in the locker room \u2026 now that\u2019s no mirage.

That means the reigning Kia MVP\u2019s job just got harder . It\u2019s difficult to envision a scenario in which the wear \u2018n\u2019 tear doesn\u2019t catch up to him and the Rockets come playoffs. Shaun Powell : It probably won\u2019t mean anything drastic on the win-loss column because Chris Paul should return in a few weeks. That said, the Rockets have nothing to compensate for Capela\u2019s rebounding and interior defense . Which means James Harden will be asked to shoot more because as you know, he simply doesn\u2019t get enough touches anyway. John Schuhmann : There\u2019s no replacing Capela, who has become the ultimate roll-man complement to Harden. The 147 assists that Harden has to Capela are 39 more than any other player has to a single teammate this season. Capela\u2019s combination of size, leaping ability and great hands makes him an easy target for Harden at the basket if his man takes one step too many toward the MVP. Without Capela, defenses won\u2019t be punished as easily for having an extra defender guarding (or just leaning toward) Harden , who will obviously need to carry more of the scoring load for the next 4-6 weeks. In 1,131 minutes with Capela on the floor, Harden has averaged 21.1 field goal attempts and 9.0 assists per 36 minutes. In 354 minutes with Capela off the floor, he\u2019s averaged 26.5 and just 6.2 per 36 . The eventual returns of Chris Paul and Eric Gordon will obviously ease some of Harden\u2019s burden on offense, but Capela\u2019s size and athleticism will also be missed on defense, which has been a bigger concern for the Rockets this season. Sekou Smith : With the way James Harden is rolling right now, I\u2019m not sure anything can change the trajectory of the Rockets\u2019 season, not even a devastating blow to yet another one of the team\u2019s most critical players. Capela was having a fantastic season before suffering this thumb injury. And perhaps no player on the Rockets\u2019 roster worked in concert better with Harden. Still, if Capela misses all of the time expected, the Rockets will need an assortment of their role players to step up dramatically to help fill the void. Ultimately, they are going to feel the impact of Capela\u2019s absence severely if Harden slows down at all."},{"id":36331,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/about-last-night-1-15-19","date":"2019-01-16","title":"About Last Night: Warriors send message in Denver","content":" If the Warriors wanted to send a message Tuesday night in Denver, they didn\u2019t wait long to do it. Facing the West-leading Nuggets, Golden State set an NBA record for points in a first quarter, erupting for 51 while setting a franchise record for 3s in a first quarter with 10. And they hardly slow down from there. Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson scored 31 points apiece, and Kevin Durant added 27 as the Warriors cruised to a 142-111 win to climb past the Nuggets for the top spot in the Western Conference. It was the Warriors\u2019 fifth straight win and snapped Denver\u2019s 12-game home winning streak. Some more superlatives from the Warriors\u2019 beatdown: While the Warriors played one of their best games of the season \u2013 \u201cbeautiful, beautiful basketball,\u201d coach Steve Kerr said afterward \u2013 Durant was quick to downplay talk that this was a statement win for the Warriors. \u201cI think they know who we are,\u201d he said. After the game, all anyone could talk about in the Warriors\u2019 locker room was Thompson\u2019s career-high four dunks \u2013 and especially his celebration that had his teammates dying on the bench. Thompson, who has a running friendly wager with former teammate Zaza Pachulia on who finishes the season with more slams, said it \u201cfelt better than hitting 10 3s\u201d and stopped mid-interview to text Pachulia when told by reporters that he now holds an 11-1 lead. Durant, in typical KD fashion, wasn\u2019t impressed. \u201cHis dunks don\u2019t look that good,\u201d he joked. \u201cProbably his last four of the year. He\u2019s 6-7, he should be jumping higher than that.\u201d Durant can be a little salty, so you be the judge: 21 \u2013 Number of 3-s made by the 76ers, a franchise record. It was part of a 149-point night, the most scored by the Sixers since March 30, 1990. The Hawks have won eight of their last 15 and picked up one of their best wins of the season, surprising the Thunder 142-126 as Trae Young outdueled former Hawks point guard Dennis Schroder. Young had 24 points (13 in the fourth quarter) and 11 assists, including this fine dime to fellow rookie Kevin Huerter, who finished with 17 points and five 3s. The Hawks are still languishing at the bottom of the Eastern Conference standings, but Young and Huerter have formed a connection that should continue to blossom. Leave it to Joel Embiid to deliver the best tweet of the night. This, of course, is in reference to the infamous Timberwolves practice in which a disgruntled Jimmy Butler challenged his teammates, reportedly winning a scrimmage with a group of third-stringers. Butler, as we know, was later traded to Philly, where Embiid enters the picture. Embiid put up 31 points and 13 rebounds while holding Karl-Anthony Towns to 14 points as Philly rolled to a 149-107 rout of the Wolves. Butler scored 19 in his first meeting with Minnesota since the trade, and helped Philly score 83 in an impressive first half. \u201dIt was everything that I thought it would be,\u201d Butler said. \u201dSeeing some old faces. Not too much trash talking, though, I don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s talking like that. I like the fact that we beat them.\u201d \u201cThat wasn\u2019t no normal game. Them dudes was at our heads. Jimmy [Butler] wanted to beat us. We all know that. Joel Embiid wanted to beat KAT. That ain\u2019t a normal game.\u201d \u2014 Wolves point guard Jeff Teague, after the Wolves\u2019 149-107 loss to the Sixers Former Sixers Dario Saric and Robert Covington returned to Philly and received a warm ovation from the fans, while T.J. McConnell welcomed Saric back with a friendly little tap on the butt after knocking down a third quarter jumper.  Three teams scored 140-plus points Tuesday: 76ers, 149 Hawks, 142 Warriors, 142 According to NBA.com\/Stats, the last time three teams topped 140 points in the same night was Jan. 7, 1984 (Warriors \u2013 154, Nuggets \u2013 141, Knicks \u2013 140). On a six-game night, the closest game ended up being the Lakers\u2019 107-100 win over the Bulls. The other five games ended as laughers. Pacers 131, Suns 97 Sixers 149, Wolves 107 Hawks 142, Thunder 126 Bucks 124, Heat 86 Warriors 142, Nuggets 111 The average margin of victory in the six NBA games was 28 points, which is the largest average margin of victory ever in a single night in NBA history (minimum of five games).

Last week, reports circulated that Cousins was targeting Friday\u2019s road game against the LA Clippers ( 10:30 ET, ESPN ) as his return date. After Tuesday\u2019s shootaround, Warriors coach Steve Kerr told reporters that Cousins remains on track to suit up for Friday\u2019s game. Kerr said last week that Cousins will start immediately when he makes his long-awaited Warriors debut. There was some thought that Cousins could suit up Wednesday against the New Orleans Pelicans ( 10:30 ET, ESPN ) \u2014 which is Cousins\u2019 former team \u2014 but that seems unlikely now. Golden State\u2019s coaching staff has spent the past couple of weeks more intensely planning for Cousins\u2019 return and how he will be incorporated into different rotations throughout games, while also holding regular discussions with Cousins about the plan. \u201cIt\u2019s a relief. It\u2019s been a long year for me, a lot of ups and downs,\u201d Cousins said after practice last week. \u201cBut the finish line is ahead and I\u2019m extremely excited to be back on the floor. The big man has made significant strides with his condition in recent scrimmages, showing Kerr and the Warriors medical staff he is nearly ready to play in games again. Cousins tore his Achilles late last January and it prematurely ended his season with the Pelicans. Before the injury, Cousins averaged 25.2 points, 12.9 rebounds and 5.4 assists in 48 games. The 28-year-old Cousins doesn\u2019t expect to dominate from Day 1, especially playing in a lineup that will feature four other All-Stars \u2014 Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson. Kerr said he hasn\u2019t thought about the star-studded lineup yet, knowing there\u2019s still half the season to go for Cousins to get comfortable and acclimated. Not that the fiery Cousins, known for drawing technical fouls, will change. He loves that Kerr and Green and the others love to show their emotions during games. \u201cSame person. I play with a chip on my shoulder,\u201d Cousins said last week. \u201cI use different things as fuel to keep me moving forward. I\u2019m going to use the same things. I\u2019m looking forward to proving myself on the floor.\u201d Cousins is appreciative of the support he received from family to get through the tough days of rehab. In turn, the young Warriors centers were grateful for the guidance from Cousins as he dealt with watching night in and night out from the bench. \u201cA lot of things switch up for you when you kind of are out of the picture. Reality hits,\u201d Cousins said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of an out-of-sight, out-of-mind type of thing. A lot of people that were all about you kind of disappear. Reality hits you and you realize the people that really are in your corner, so this was a good year for me on top of all the negatives because you really realize who\u2019s in your corner.

This reunion isn\u2019t about the crowd reaction. The Philly crowd will certainly be happy to welcome back Robert Covington (who is out with a right knee bone bruise) and Dario Saric, two starters from the team that made a surprise run to the Eastern Conference semifinals last season . Butler won\u2019t make his return to the Target Center until late March, and we\u2019ll see then how Minnesota fans feel about him in the aftermath of his departure . Tonight, all eyes will be on Butler and his former teammates, the ones he chose to leave behind when he asked to be traded last summer . It took almost eight weeks of distracting drama in Minnesota \u2014 an off-site meeting with then team president Tom Thibodeau, a no-show in training camp , boorish behavior in a scrimmage , missed games for \u201cgeneral soreness,\u201d and a disappointing, 4-9 start \u2014 before the Wolves finally traded Butler , along with Justin Patton, to Philadelphia in exchange for Covington, Saric, Jerryd Bayless and a second-round pick. Nine weeks later, both teams seem to be in a better place. In regard to how well they\u2019ve played since, the trade has worked for both the Sixers and Wolves. They had a combined record of 12-15 at the time of the deal and are a combined 37-23 since . Both still have room to grow over the final 12 weeks of the season. The Sixers want to reach The Finals, and with Butler able to opt out of his contract this summer, they have urgency \u2014 even though Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons are just 24 and 22 years old, respectively. The Wolves, meanwhile, are still very much in the race for a playoff spot in the deep Western Conference, sitting just one game in the loss column behind the eighth-place Jazz. Here\u2019s how each team has fared since the trade \u2026  The early days of Butler\u2019s time in Philadelphia will be remembered for his late-game heroics. Butler hit two (almost identical) game-winning 3-pointers \u2014 one in Charlotte and another in Brooklyn \u2014 in his first seven games with the Sixers. After losing their first game with their new star ( blowing a 16-point, fourth-quarter lead in Orlando on Nov. 14), the Sixers won 10 of their next 12 . That was against a relatively soft (and home-heavy) stretch of schedule, though. And seven of the 10 wins were within five points in the last five minutes . Butler made an immediate impact by helping his new team win those close games, shooting 5-for-10 with the score within five in the last five over that 10-2 stretch, with the two game-winners being the highlights. Butler suffered a groin injury at the end of that stretch and missed the next two games (both losses at home). The Sixers lost five of their last nine games in December, including their Christmas game in Boston , when some late-game offensive struggles \u2014 the Sixers shot 3-for-17 with the score within five points in the last five minutes of the fourth quarter or overtime \u2014 brought questions of offensive fit to the forefront. Embiid hasn\u2019t been happy about having to spend so much time on the perimeter, with Simmons occupying the paint when he doesn\u2019t have the ball. Butler has reportedly voiced concern about his role in the offense as well. The Sixers rank eighth in offensive efficiency since the trade , but they\u2019ve played a lot more games against bottom-10 defenses (14) than they have against top-10 defenses (eight) over that stretch. And in 383 minutes with all three of Simmons, Butler and Embiid on the floor, the Sixers have scored just 105.8 points per 100 possessions , a mark well below the league average (108.7). They\u2019ve been much better offensively (scoring more than 118 points per 100 possessions) in 562 minutes with just two of the three stars on the floor. There\u2019s still a lot to figure out in Philadelphia, and the upcoming schedule will challenge the Sixers to do just that. The Wolves will be both the best team Philly has faced in the last two weeks and the worst team it will face over the next four. Beginning with their visit to Indiana on Thursday, the Sixers will play 12 straight games (and 16 of their next 18) against teams that currently have winning records . They\u2019re just 7-8 against that group thus far.  While the Sixers improved offensively since the trade, the Wolves have taken a step forward on the other end of the floor. In fact, in each of their first nine games after the trade (including one before Covington and Saric suited up), they allowed less than 109 points per 100 possessions , something they had done just once in their 13 games before the trade . The Wolves won nine of their first 12 games after the trade and ranked third defensively over that stretch (having ranked 29th on defense prior to the deal). But, as was the case with the Sixers\u2019 early post-trade success, the Wolves benefited from a friendly stretch of schedule. Ten of those 12 games were at home and seven were against teams that currently have losing records. The Wolves then went 4-9 in a stretch where they played 10 of 13 games on the road. And at the end of that stretch, they lost Covington to the knee injury that will have him missing a seventh straight game tonight. They returned home to beat the Magic and Los Angeles Lakers, but that wasn\u2019t enough for Thibodeau to keep his job. He was fired on Jan. 6 , with the Wolves in 11th place at 19-21 . New coach Ryan Saunders has led the team to two wins in his first three games. The Wolves are one of just three teams that ranks in the top 10 on both ends of the floor since the trade. But they\u2019re just 17-13 ( fifth-best mark in the Western Conference ) over that stretch, in part because they\u2019re 7-8 in games that were within five points in the last five minutes (perhaps missing Butler\u2019s ability to get late-game buckets). Through the various stages of their season, the Wolves\u2019 offense has improved steadily. In 30 post-trade games, Karl-Anthony Towns has averaged 23.5 points on 51 percent shooting , up from 19.9 on 46 percent prior to the trade . But the Minnesota defense has had its ups and downs. If they get stops, they win. The Wolves are 14-0 when they\u2019ve allowed 104 or fewer points per 100 possessions and 7-22 when they\u2019ve allowed more than 104. The opportunity is there to get back to the playoffs and prove to Butler that they didn\u2019t ****ing need him. But the Wolves have one of the league\u2019s toughest remaining schedules, with 24 of their final 39 games against teams that are currently over .500. The Sixers are one of those over-.500 opponents and, for both teams, tonight\u2019s game in more than a reunion. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

Coming off a catastrophic Achilles injury in the midst of his 17th season, with the prospect of ample time on the bench as the San Antonio Spurs\u2019 third-string point guard, Parker instead said no thanks and shocked pretty much everyone by signing with the Charlotte Hornets last summer. \u201cThey really didn\u2019t take me seriously that I was going to leave,\u201d said Parker, as reported by ESPN . Monday, however, was no time to obsess about the past. Both parties have moved on, and Parker\u2019s first appearance in San Antonio since he departed was an opportunity not to grieve, but to celebrate a player who joined the Spurs as a raw teenager from France and left with four championship rings, six All-Star appearances, a Finals MVP award and status as one of the very best players to ever wear their uniform. It started early as Parker was shocked during warmups to find his immediate family at courtside, flown in from France by the Spurs. It continued before tipoff with an emotional video tribute that brought the AT&T Center to its feet \u2026 \u2026 and then another standing ovation as Parker checked in for the first time. And they still weren\u2019t finished! Not satisfied with the 150-minute lovefest, Spurs fans urged Hornets coach James Borrego to sub Parker back in for the final seconds, so they could shower him with adulation one more time. Not surprisingly, it was a stark difference from the recent homecoming of former Spur Kawhi Leonard, who was booed relentlessly throughout his return game earlier this month. While Parker didn\u2019t have the best game, shooting just 4-for-12 from the floor, he did finish with eight points, including a vintage coast-to-coast drive as the Hornets pulled away for their 108-93 victory . Given how many times he ripped off that exact same play over nearly two decades with the Spurs, it was only fitting he did it to help finish them off. Important as it was to the Hornets, who are battling hard for a lower-tier playoff spot in the East, the victory couldn\u2019t help but take a distant back seat to the reunion between Parker and the franchise he served so well, for so long. \u201cI\u2019m very tired,\u201d Parker said. \u201cIt was draining, mentally and emotionally. It was just an awesome night. I want to thank the fans. It was unbelievable love, and I appreciate everything. It\u2019s a great memory I will cherish for the rest of my life.\u201d Said Spurs coach Gregg Popovich, who shared a lengthy embrace\/exchange with his long-time point guard after the game: \u201cI expected nothing less. Tony was a great player for us and he deserved all the love that he received.\u201d James Harden continued his monster scoring run with 38 points against the Magic on Sunday, but it came with a rare blemish: His 16 missed 3-pointers tied the single-game record for most misses from beyond the arc. But the relentless NBA schedule offers immediate opportunities for atonement, and Harden took full advantage. The reigning Kia MVP punished the Grizzlies with one of the best games of his career, a 57-point onslaught in which he set the Rockets team mark with 36 in the first half while extending his streak of 30-point games to 17 , the NBA\u2019s best since the 1976 merger and trailing only Elgin Baylor\u2019s 18 among everyone not named Wilt Chamberlain. Even more impressively, it came just as the Rockets learned they\u2019ll be without interior lynchpin Clint Capela for up to six weeks. With starting point guard Chris Paul expected to be out for at least a few more weeks with a bad hamstring, the Rockets will need as much greatness as Harden can give them. And as he\u2019s proven over the past 17 games (41.3 points, 9.2 assists) \u2014 indeed his entire tenure with the Rockets \u2014 he\u2019s more than ready for the challenge. Rumors of the Celtics\u2019 ascendance have, once again, been greatly exaggerated. Just as a previous eight-game streak was followed by a lengthy stretch of mediocrity, they\u2019ve now dropped three straight after a modest four-win stretch had seemingly signaled that they were ready, finally, to pursue their expected perch near the top of the Eastern Conference standings. The latest setback came courtesy of the Nets, who outscored the Celtics by 23 in the third quarter and led by as many as 27 in the fourth before a cosmetic run in garbage time made the 109-102 final far closer than it should have been.  Adding insult to injury, Nets fans taunted the Celtics after star point guard Kyrie Irving, who missed the game with a quad injury, criticized his teammates following Saturday\u2019s loss to the Magic. https:\/\/twitter.com\/BleacherReport\/status\/1085001067690115079 Irving was contrite at Monday\u2019s shootaround, attributing the censure to his competitiveness. \u201cI just want to win so bad,\u201d he said. He followed that up by reportedly praising his teammates after their comeback attempt against the Nets in what was described as a \u201cpositive message\u201d by NBC Sports Boston\u2019s A. Sherrod Blakely. But at least one of those teammates, Jaylen Brown, didn\u2019t seem quite convinced after a pointed statement of his own. \u201cWe have to have everybody\u2019s back,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t make comments, we can\u2019t point fingers. It starts from the top to the bottom, not bottom to the top. It\u2019s not the young guys\u2019 or old guys\u2019 fault \u2014 it\u2019s everybody.\u201d The world\u2019s largest 12-year-old, Clippers center Boban Marjanovic, motors to the locker room.

Entering the second half of the Rockets\u2019 matchup with the Grizzlies, Harden had scored 36 points , giving him 17 straight games with 30 or more points. That surpassed Kobe Bryant\u2019s streak of 16 consecutive 30-point games, achieved in 2003 . \u201cThe Beard\u201d finished with 57 points in the Rockets\u2019 112-94 victory and was virtually unstoppable. He shot 17-of-33 from the field and 17-of-18 from the free throw line. He was 6-of-15 from long distance. His point total was higher than the combined points \u2014 53 \u2014 scored by the Grizzlies starters. The 30-plus streak is the NBA\u2019s longest since Wilt Chamberlain strung together 20 such performances in 1964. Elgin Baylor scored 30 or more in 18 straight games from December 1961 to October 1962. Remarkably, Chamberlain also had three other streaks, according to Elias Sports Bureau: a jaw-dropping 65 games of 30 or more from November 1961 to February 1962; 31 games of 30 or more from February 1961 to December 1962; and 25 games from November 1960 to December 1960. Over his last 17 games, Harden has recorded 702 points and 157 assists. Per Elias Sports Bureau, he joins Chamberlain and Bryant as the only players in NBA history to score 700 or more points over a 17-game span in a single season. In addition to the streak, Harden\u2019s 36 set a career high for a first half and tied his career high for either half. It tied Klay Thompson for the most points in a half this season. The 57 was the second-highest point total for a game in Rockets\u2019 franchise history. The record is owned by, you guessed it, Harden with 60 points on Jan. 30th of last year versus the Magic. The reigning MVP has scored 40 or more 14 times this season, and he\u2019s topped 50 points three times this season. Since the 2014-15 season, Harden has 12 games of 50 or more points \u2014 the most in the NBA. On Sunday night, Harden finished with 38 points as the Magic rallied for a 116-109 victory over the Rockets. Harden was just 1-for-17 on 3-point attempts in that game. He did get fouled three times shooting from beyond the arc and was 9 for 9 from the free throw line on those occasions (15 of 16 overall), but it was never enough to give the Rockets a comfortable advantage. Harden made his first two 3-pointers on Monday night to quickly outdo his 3-point shooting from Sunday and finished 6-of-15.

A 6-foot-7 forward from UCLA started winning awards and championships at Crenshaw High School in Los Angeles and continued that with the Bruins (1975 NCAA title). He was the first winner in 1977 of the John Wooden Award and that spring, he was drafted No. 3 overall by the Milwaukee Bucks. That puts the start of his NBA career squarely in the first half of league history. His exploits as a five-time All-Star best found on YouTube, the nature of his game (mid-range, arriving two years before the league adopted the 3-point shot) and his Twitter handle \u2014 @olskool8888 \u2013 all holler \u201cvintage.\u201d So does the fact that he again is candidate for the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, for which he has been eligible for nearly 25 years. Johnson stays up to date on the game for his job as one of the Bucks\u2019 TV color analysts, a role that\u2019s been especially fun so far this season. He splits his time between Milwaukee and Los Angeles, where he has racked up 26 acting credits per IMDB.com, including his famous turn as \u201cRaymond\u201d in \u201cWhite Men Can\u2019t Jump \u201d [1992]. His NBA resume is strong enough for Springfield, as he averaged 20.1 points, 7.0 rebounds and 3.6 assists in 691 games. The Bucks were 347-227 in his seven seasons, and were considered one of the NBA\u2019s best-ever uncrowned teams. Johnson spoke recently with NBA.com\u2019s Steve Aschburner about a variety of topics.  * * * Steve Aschburner:  I recently wrote a piece about players who have made or are making the transition into broadcasting you did, and the help they got from a program known as \u201cSportscaster U.\u201d But you\u2019ve been doing this for more than 25 years, long before that type of program was available. Were you self-taught? Marques Johnson:  I feel like I\u2019ve been training all my life. When I was little, I set up my own little basketball court. I\u2019d cut out little cardboard rims and tape \u2018em against the wall of my room. I\u2019d clip out the stats of every game from the L.A. Times, so I\u2019d have matchups like John Havlicek against Dave Gambee. I\u2019d do my \u201cChick Hearn,\u201d rapid-fire play-by-play. Just to give you an idea of where my imagination took me. When I got to UCLA, I had a professor who started a sportscasting class. He wanted some of the athletes to participate. So myself, Rick Walker \u2014 who was one of the \u2018Hogs\u2019 for the Washington Redskins \u2014 and a couple other guys who made it in the NFL, we all took the class. It really opened up my eyes to the possibilities, and I had such a great time doing it. I had a campus TV show that deal with non-sports issues \u2014 I was the host and other students in the class were the producers. So that kind of helped prepare me. By the time I got to Milwaukee, I did a lot of stuff for the local NBC affiliate. I took a camera guy on the road and put together a piece of us going against the Sixers and the Celtics. I interviewed Red Auerbach and Dr. J. So I was preparing myself for a long time to make the transition.  SA:  I guess I overlooked you being a theater arts major. With that, and you living in southern California, that probably explains you the acting roles you\u2019ve had, right? MJ:  Again, growing up, I played Conrad Birdie in a production of \u201cBye, Bye Birdie.\u201d I did some acting at UCLA and at Crenshaw. I was Li\u2019l Abner in \u201cLi\u2019l Abner.\u201dWe did \u201cDamn Yankees.\u201d We did \u201cThe Pajama Game.\u201d So just being around acting class and musical theatre, drama class, in seventh and eighth grade, I fell in love with that at about the same time. It was really my first love, but broadcasting pays the bills. SA:  So humor me for a minute. How did your involvement in \u201cWhite Men Can\u2019t Jump,\u201d and your role as \u201cRaymond,\u201d come about? You even mention him in your Twitter profile, so I\u2019m guessing you get asked about that a lot. MJ:  Here\u2019s what happened: We were doing a film for a guy who was a student at the American Film Institute, and it was based on this L.A. legend Raymond Lewis. A bunch of ballplayers and a bunch of actors, shooting up in the Hollywood hills on cold nights. https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v Cylk Cozart, who\u2019s an actor, told me he had a director friend by the name of Ron Shelton who he played basketball with at the Hollywood \u201cY.\u201d That\u2019s where Denzel Washington and these other actors used to play. Shelton had a new movie he was getting ready to cast, and there was a role he thought I\u2019d be good for. So Cylk told Ron Shelton about me, and Shelton brought me in to read with Wesley Snipes. I did my prep work and had a scene where I pull a knife out on Wesley Snipes\u2019 character. Now, my dad was a barber and he had these straight razors. I had seen a movie a long time ago where a guy did this fancy maneuver with his razor, pulling it out to brandish it. So I worked on that for days before I went in to read. When I did the scene, I pulled it out of my pocket and did the thing with my hand, then chased Wesley around the office where the audition was. They loved it. But they told me, \u201cLook, next time don\u2019t bring a real razor in here. You could hurt somebody with that thing.\u201d SA:  How do you think the actors did with the basketball scenes? MJ:  We had a six-week training camp at a park in south central Los Angeles \u2014 Rancho Cienega playground, near Dorsey High School. We went 10 to noon, five days a week. They wanted everybody to be in basketball shape. And it gave Wesley and Woody Harrelson a chance to really work on their games and get some skills of their own. Wesley was a great athlete but not a basketball player. He couldn\u2019t get the hang of the three-man weave they had us doing, and every time you messed it up, you had to do it again. So every time he was at the front, you had other guys suddenly needing to tie their shoes, \u201cGo ahead of me, man,\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ve got to tighten my jock strap.\u201d Wesley was like, \u201cJust wait. Give me a couple of weeks, I\u2019ll get this done.\u201d And he did. Woody on the other hand was a gym rat. Great basketball gym rat type of guy. I remember he called this bogus foul on me and I told him, \u201cC\u2019mon, man, that\u2019s a BS foul.\u201d And he was like, \u201cAre you impugning my integrity?! How dare you!\u201d I was like, \u201cLook, man, first of all, I went to Crenshaw. I don\u2019t know what impugn means. And second, I\u2019m not doin\u2019 that. I just thought that was a bullcrap foul.\u201d We had a great time. SA:  I\u2019m thinking that current NBA players might know you better from that movie than from your playing career. MJ:  Even when I was at the Wooden Awards the year Grant Hill and Big Dog [Glenn] Robinson were nominated [in 1994]. We were at the downtown L.A. Athletic Club, and I was the speaker. I got up to the microphone, maybe a year or two after \u201cWhite Men\u201d came out, and I said, \u201cProbably you young guys have no idea what I did as a basketball player, but I\u2019m gonna give you a frame of reference for who I am.\u201d I asked them, \u201cHow many of you saw \u2018White Men Can\u2019t Jump?\u201d They raised their hands. \u201cHow many remember the guy who robbed the liquor store?\u201d They just went crazy. \u201cThat\u2019s Raymond!\u201d I told Grant Hill\u2019s mother, \u201cSee what it\u2019s come down to? Five-time All-Star in the NBA, and I\u2019m the thug who robbed the liquor store to today\u2019s generation.\u201d SA:  I had moved from Milwaukee to Minneapolis in the late \u201880s and kind of lost track of you \u2014 Minnesota didn\u2019t have the Timberwolves yet. So when I saw you on the screen, my reaction was, \u201cMan, Marques has fallen on hard times.\u201d Now I know that was acting!  MJ:  The irony of that scene was, when you get to the league, one of the first stories you hear is about this player named Reggie Harding. He was a roommate of [former NBA senior VP] Rod Thorn\u2019s at one point, a big kid who went straight from high school [in Detroit] to the pros. Don\u2019t ask me how that happened back in those days. He was just this street-life type dude who went into the neighborhood liquor store with a ski mask on. He\u2019s 6-10, 6-11, so the guy in the store is like, \u201cC\u2019mon Reggie, you can\u2019t be doing this, man.\u201d And he was like, \u201cThis ain\u2019t me. This ain\u2019t me!\u201d I immediately thought of that when I read the script, I knew that\u2019s who they were talking about. [Harding was killed in a street shooting in Detroit in September 1972, four years after his brief NBA\/ABA career ended.] SA:  I hadn\u2019t realized how many acting roles you\u2019ve had. MJ:  Yeah, my last one was on \u201cCastle,\u201d where I played one of a group of old-school superheroes, where the star Nathan [Fillion] solved the case. It was a lot of fun. I got to shoot a live machine gun \u2014 they were like, \u201cDo you want a stand-in to do it?\u201d \u2014 but I said, \u201cNah, I got this.\u201d I try to do whatever\u2019s feasible and makes sense. I don\u2019t pursue it as much as I used to. SA:  Any similarity between acting and playing basketball at the highest level? MJ:  It all goes back to what [UCLA coach John] Wooden and my coach in high school, Willie West, and my dad told me about preparation. I compare it to a duck on the pond that\u2019s floating real smooth, but underneath the water, its feet are moving at 100 mph. The easier it looks, the harder the work is. It\u2019s the same thing with acting and with basketball. I\u2019ve learned that from the actors I\u2019ve worked with, like Nick Nolte in \u201cBlue Chips.\u201d I spent time in his trailer and saw him with these voluminous notes on Indiana basketball and every practice, every player. Notes taped to the walls of his trailer, kind of like the mindset of a coach. SA:  In your primary job now with the Bucks now, you get to see Giannis Antetokounmpo\u2019s continued growth. What do you make of him now compared to four years ago when you started coming back to Milwaukee? MJ:  He was good but he hadn\u2019t reached this level of greatness he\u2019s at now. I reminded him of a story from New Year\u2019s Day my first year there [2015-16]. He had seen some footage of me, and we had a practice that day. He was like, \u201cHey man, you were really good. I watched the film and you got buckets. Wow! My New Year\u2019s resolution is to get buckets the way you got buckets!\u201d I reminded him of that a couple of weeks ago. And he and [Bucks play-by-play broadcaster] Jim Paschke had lunch not long ago and he was asking Jim who my game was like. Was it like Tobias Harris? Jim said, \u201cWell, Tobias is not a five-time All-Star.\u201d Jim asked me what he should tell him and I said, \u201cTell him what Alex English told me a few years back, that Dwyane Wade is probably the guy who game is most like mine, among current players.\u201d Giannis loved that.  SA:  Nice that Milwaukee has such a budding young star again, isn\u2019t it? MJ:  Giannis is just a joy to be around. My favorite Giannis story is from last season. They had just lost a game and he had struggled from the line that night. I\u2019m walking to my car in the parking structure, and it\u2019s probably 2 degrees outside, so I\u2019m hurrying to get there. The crowd of people had just been let out of the game, and I see this tall skinny black dude kind of weaving his way through the crowd, and he\u2019s got on [an undershirt] and shorts. I\u2019m like, \u201cWhat\u2019s this fool doing out here half-dressed?\u201d And it was Giannis, running to the practice facility to get up some free throws. It just blew me away. That\u2019s just the mindset he has. It\u2019s really refreshing to be around. SA:  He and the Bucks have taken a big step this season under Mike Budenholzer and his coaching staff \u2026 MJ:  Yeah, but don\u2019t forget Jason Kidd. I\u2019m not a J-Kidd basher. I thought, for how long he coached, he was progressing and eventually would turn into a pretty good coach. You have to give Jason credit for that year he put Giannis at the point guard position, making him the primary ball handler. Giannis really took off then. Jason would stand on a chair at practice to see what Giannis saw when he was on the court. True story. That way he could see and make the proper decisions. SA:  A lot of media folks consider Antetokounmpo a top MVP candidate, maybe even the favorite halfway through the season. Your thoughts?  MJ:  Yeah. James Harden is coming along strong, and Kawhi [Leonard] in Toronto. Paul George in OKC gets some mentions. It\u2019s interesting because Jason Kidd a couple years ago talked about how the difficulty of pronouncing Giannis\u2019 name might work against him. I remember saying on air to Jim, \u201cThat\u2019s going to help him, because it\u2019s so unusual.\u201d The whole \u201cGreek Freak\u201d thing, I thought it would give him some extra recognition. But it\u2019s all about what you do on the court. Giannis, despite the 3-point shooting [struggle], he still finds a way to make a difference. And the value he brings to other guys, like [Malcolm] Brogdon and [Brook] Lopez and the open shots. The operative word in the league now is \u201cgravity.\u201d You pull the defenders toward you and open things up for your teammates. SA:  Do you see him adding a reliable 3-point shot? Does he need it? MJ:  He needs it. And you\u2019ll see it, I think, in the playoffs. The first time we played Miami down there, they really overexaggerated packing it in the paint, and he had like nine points. He\u2019s going to see more and more of that. If the Bucks aren\u2019t knocking down 3-point shots, they become a little vulnerable. But I\u2019ve noticed, when guys sag off of Giannis, he\u2019s able to pick up this head of steam, which makes it almost impossible to keep him out of the lane. With his slender build and his footwork, with his speed and quickness, he\u2019s able to get them shifting, going one direction and then cross back the other direction. The thing with developing a jump shot, it will just be easier for him to score. That\u2019s one thing I was taught early in my career: if I could hit five mid-range jump shots a game, I would average 20 points easy because of my offensive rebounding and ability in transition. So that was my goal, to knock down 3-5 little jumpers, and then the rest of the game would open up for me. The same thing with Giannis. If he can hit those jumpers, the game will become easier and he won\u2019t have to expend the same type of energy SA:  Defenses are doing everything they can to make him work. MJ:  He\u2019s getting kind of the \u201cJordan Rules\u201d approach defensively , where teams are knocking him down, playing him physical and just trying to wear him down. It\u2019s a good, aggressive strategy \u2014 people can have their qualms about whether he\u2019s getting fouled more than the calls being made \u2014 but if you\u2019re playing against him, that\u2019s how you have to play. You have to make him feel you and make him earn those points. SA:  So Wade is in Milwaukee Tuesday, facing the Bucks for the last time in the city where he went to college. I\u2019m curious about the comparison you made between your games. You had a few inches on him and played forward. MJ:  Aw, but he\u2019s 6-5 or so. I\u2019m listed at 6-7 \u2014 I always wanted to be Dr. J\u2019s size \u2014 but I\u2019m really more 6-6. But just as a player who is fundamentally sound, who can do all types of things, a 5-tool player, and who has enough athleticism to pull off a spectacular play every now and then. He\u2019s an efficient scoring machine who\u2019s not a 3-point shooter, and that was kind of my game, working in that mid-range area and getting to the basket with great body control. I\u2019ve been a big admirer since his Marquette days, and what he did in Miami has been nothing short of spectacular. SA:  I think it\u2019s funny that his jersey number has been hanging in the rafters in Milwaukee for years because of his time at Marquette, but we\u2019re still waiting to see yours. Is that going to change? MJ:  Uh \u2026 not yet. [There has been speculation that Johnson might be honored by the Bucks this season, in conjunction with his enshrinement Jan. 24 in the Wisconsin Sports Hall of Fame.] SA:  What stands out when you think back to your game with the Bucks? MJ:  I think about how, in my second year in the league with Alex [English] gone, when Dave Meyers hurt his back, I had a great year. Averaged 25.6 points and supplanted Dr. J on the first all-NBA team [in 1978-79]. Going into my third year [1979-80], Nellie calls me into his office and asks me what I think I\u2019m going to average. I said, \u201cWell, I worked real hard on my jump shot and on my conditioning. I feel like I could average 30 pretty easily this year and seven or eight rebounds.\u201d He said, \u201cI believe you can too. But for the good of this team and the balance, and having Sidney Moncrief and Brian Winters \u2026 I\u2019m going to bring in a couple other pieces, upgrade the center position [the Bucks acquired veteran Bob Lanier in a midseason deal with Detroit ]. So I\u2019m going to need you to average 20, 21 points a game, seven rebounds, play good defense and buy into this balanced scoring system I\u2019m trying to implement. SA:  What did you make of that request?  MJ:  We went back and forth on that \u2014 it wasn\u2019t easy to accept, because scoring was kind of my thing. But if you look at my numbers that year, I was always around 20, 21 points. It\u2019s a thing where being a team player may cost me a chance to get into the Hall of Fame, because I might have had another 5,000 points in my career and then I\u2019m getting close to 20,000. That\u2019s more kind of Hall of Fame numbers than where I am now. But you look at my scoring average, it drops from 25.6 to 21.7, and it was at the request of Don Nelson, doing what they wanted me to do. SA:  It\u2019s true. Your shooting percentage kept going up, but your attempts dropped. MJ:  I didn\u2019t make a stink about it with Nellie. But what I tried to do was become in the playoffs the scorer I was meant to be. That was always my chance to be \u2014 not a ball hog or steal the glory \u2014 but a little more aggressive shooting the ball. That\u2019s why my playoff numbers are a little ahead of my regular season numbers. SA:  Those \u201880s Bucks are considered some of the best teams to never reach The Finals. It was just too much to be powerful Philadelphia and Boston teams in the same postseasons. MJ:  One of my bigger regrets was not even winning a championship but not getting to The Finals. In hindsight, though \u2014 and this hit me about 20 years ago \u2014 I started thinking the quality of the players we were going against. I was being guarded by Bobby Jones and having to guard Dr. J at the other end. I\u2019m going against Kevin McHale with his size and reach, and then I\u2019m guarding Larry Bird. I think of all the talent that these teams possessed, and they were just better than us. I always thought, though, and still feel if we had been able to get a center like Bob Lanier two or three years earlier, that would have made a huge difference. He was still good when we got him, about 15 points, eight rebounds, but a couple years earlier might have changed things. We just couldn\u2019t beat teams that were better than us.  SA:  You got traded to the Clippers in 1984, got back to the All-Star Game in 1986 \u2014 and then had the opposite of a farewell tour when your career ended abruptly. What happened? MJ:  I hurt my neck Nov. 20, 1986. We played the Dallas Mavericks, and my jump shot was clicking, I had like 10 points in the first quarter. I went up for one rebound and a friend of mine heard them say it on radio, \u201cThat\u2019s the highest Marques Johnson has jumped since he\u2019s been a Clipper.\u201d Everything was great. But I got one rebound and went to push the ball up the floor, and my teammate Benoit Benjamin was standing right there at the free throw line. My forehead barreled into his big chest. The last thing I remember seeing was two big zeroes \u2014 he was \u201c00.\u201d It was too late to change direction, and it snapped my neck back. I lost the feeling in my upper body for a few minutes. I went down in a heap, couldn\u2019t move, scared out of my mind thinking I was paralyzed. They carried me out on a stretcher. The feeling came back but I went to a lot of specialists who wanted to do a spinal fusion. There were questions whether I\u2019d be able to play again if I got the surgery or play again if I didn\u2019t get the surgery. I had a protruding disc and there was talk if I took another hit, it could cause some paralysis. So I sat out two years. SA:  That sounds miserable. MJ:  Things got worse. In the interim, I lost a son [Marques Jr., 15 months old] in a drowning accident in our pool that following year, 1987. You can imagine, my head was all messed up. It was the darkest time in my life. Alcohol, all that \u2026 Every summer I\u2019d work out and think about trying to come back. But I\u2019d always chicken out, \u201cNah, I don\u2019t want to risk this neck thing.\u201d Finally, in 1989, I got into my workout routine again. Started going up UCLA and playing with some of the Lakers, Vlade Divac, Magic [Johnson]. This one day, Magic came up to me and was like, \u201cWhat\u2019s goin\u2019 on? You gonna play or what?\u201d I wasn\u2019t sure I still had the ability but he was like, \u201cYou got it man. Get back out there.\u201d So I called up Nellie, he was at Golden State, and told he I wanted to come up there. He had Chris Mullin, Mitch Richmond, Tim Hardaway, that crew, and have him take a look at me. I did well and he told me he wanted to bring me to training camp. But after I got to Golden State, they had some injuries \u2014 Alton Lister went down, Manute Bol went down \u2014 and we lost a lot of size. Nellie told me they had to get somebody bigger and younger who could play some long minutes. But he had arranged through [agent] Warren LeGarie for me to be able to play in Italy if I wanted to. I was disappointed but I told him, \u201cThat\u2019s cool.\u201d [Johnson played 10 games for the Warriors before being waived on Nov. 29, 1989.] SA:  How did you like playing overseas? MJ:  I played in a small town, Udine, Italy. Was scoring about 25 a game, but I knew \u2014 based on playing maybe twice a week but practicing sometimes twice a day \u2014 that I was done. I just didn\u2019t have the motivation. Bob McAdoo was over there, Micheal Ray Richardson, and they kept telling me, \u201cYou can play till you\u2019re 40 over here.\u201d But after that first season, I was like, nah, I\u2019m good. Gotta get back to the States and get on with my life. But I always appreciated what Nellie did. At that point in life, bouncing back from what I\u2019d been going through, I needed that carrot dangled in front of me, reaching out and helping me out from what I was going through emotionally. [Johnson has seven children now, five boys and two girls, from son Kris, 43, to 9-year-old daughter Shiloh.] SA:  You played for two coaching legends \u2014 Wooden late in his career and Nelson near the start of his. What were they like? MJ:  Let me correct you on that. I actually played for three. Willie West is a Hall of Fame nominee. My high school coach at Crenshaw has about 16 city championships, about 10 state championships. I was fortunate \u2014 his second year was my first year. We went undefeated for two years. By the time I got to UCLA, Coach Wooden had won nine national champipmships. So you knew what you were getting into with that. That was a highlight, being around him every day and learning some of the life lessons that didn\u2019t resonate with me while I was there but kind of kicked in when I became an adult. Ten years, 12 years later, when going through adversity. SA:  And Nellie?  MJ:  One thing I appreciated about him \u2014 and it\u2019s the same thing I see with Budenholzer and his staff \u2014 Nellie had this way of approaching me as if I was an empty vessel, and he was going to pour in this NBA basketball knowledge that he had gained in the Boston Celtics organization. He went in with the attitude that you didn\u2019t know the footwork needed coming off screens or anything. And Nellie would tell you, \u201cI was one of the slowest guys in the league, but I was one of the best guys in transition because I knew when to run and how to get a head start on the break.\u201d He was the perfect coach for me. Nellie would ask me in particular, if I\u2019d go out there and try to split two guys and turn the ball over, during the timeout he\u2019d say, \u201cWhat did you see out there?\u201d Well, I thought I could beat this one guy to the right, split the two and, if I could draw the third defender, I could flip it to Brian Winters for an open 20-foot jumper on the left wing. And Nellie\u2019d be like, \u201cOK, man. That\u2019s nothing I could ever speak about doing. But you\u2019ve got that kind of talent, I can buy that. OK, I like that.\u201d As long as you had a plan that fit into what he was trying to do, he was OK with whatever mistake you would make. SA:  We\u2019ve talked before about him using you as a point forward. He and Del Harris, among others, had used frontcourt players to initiate offense. But you claim to have coined the term. MJ:  It was my terminology. It\u2019s funny, I came across on the Internet, Game 6 against the New Jersey Nets in 1984, that was the series where it was created. You could see plays in that game where I\u2019m looking over to the bench, getting the calls from Nellie, bringing the ball up the floor, setting the offense, drawing Bob Lanier\u2019s man and throwing dimes. There\u2019s even one play where [Paul] Pressey and me are coming up the court, and he won\u2019t give me the ball \u2026 Remember, Paul out of Tulsa was a point guard and he played point guard for us the year or so before I left. He was great with the ball in his hands. I was always a small forward who would catch it on the wing and scored. He was used to initiating. SA:  These days we hear about positionless basketball. How do you think your game would have translated \u2014 I notice your career stats are 14-for-92 from 3-point range. MJ:  I was taking end of quarter, end of half, end of shot clock too. If I took 15 3-point attempts in a year, probably 10 or 11 were desperation-type shots. SA:  So flings. The kind of shots guys often don\u2019t quite release in time today, so their shooting percentages don\u2019t suffer. MJ:  The other part is, I worked on what I needed to work on to become a great player back in those days. That was the mid-range to 20-foot jump shot. I got that down pat. If a coach would have said or I would have felt, \u201cYou need to work on this 3-point shot,\u201d I believe in all honesty I could have shot 36, 37 percent. But there was no reason to focus on shooting long-ass 25-foot jumpers when I could get to 16 feet and knock down 75 percent of those. SA:  The game has changed in its physical demands, too. Taking games off for \u201cload management.\u201d Obviously flying charter vs. commercial. What do you make of those changes? MJ:  It amazes me how much emphasis they place on proper rest. And they have these trackers telling the trainers how many miles they\u2019re running. People don\u2019t realize, we had training camp for 30 days, going six, sometimes seven days a week. And we had two-a-days all camp. They weren\u2019t worried about making allowances for the wear and tear. We\u2019d go two practices hard, every day, for the whole time. SA:  Now the league tries to minimize back-to-back games. But in your rookie season, the Bucks played five sets of back-to-back-to-back games. You had a stretch from Dec. 2 to Dec. 10, 1977, when Milwaukee played seven games in nine nights, beginning and ending with games on three consecutive nights. It started with a game at New York sandwiched between two home games. Then you flew to the West Coast to face Lakers, and wrapped up that trip at Golden State, at Seattle and at Denver. MJ:  We got back on Sunday, we had to face the Sixers on Tuesday and Nellie had us practicing on Monday. I\u2019d been playing hard minutes, probably averaging 43 those last three games. I remember, I called up Nellie\u2019s secretary, Jean Schuler, and told her, \u201cI can\u2019t get out of bed, I\u2019m so sore right now.\u201d And she said, \u201cThat\u2019s OK, Marques. Nellie said you\u2019d probably call, and to take the day off.\u201d The next night against Dr. J, I went out and had 29. He had 29 too. [laughs] SA:  So what\u2019s your take on your Hall of Fame candidacy, knowing you\u2019re up again for the Class of 2019? MJ:  My name just kind of stays in nomination. Y\u2019know, I\u2019ve come across some Web sites about guys who are Hall of Fame-worthy based on \u201cwin shares\u201d and other analytics, and they say I am deserving of that. And I probably could have played another four or five years if not for the neck injury, so the numbers would have looked a lot better. But five All-Star Games, first-team all-NBA, second-team NBA a couple of times. I played for some great teams in Milwaukee. There\u2019s an honor in being nominated with Willie West, my high school coach, and Sidney Moncrief. I\u2019d like to see Sidney and myself both get in, but it\u2019s out of my hands. Just got to see what happens. I\u2019m definitely one of those guys who\u2019s not a shoe-in. But looking at some things the other day, I thought, I might get to the point where I become an \u201cearly African-American pioneer.\u201d [laughs] * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

And things have become a little more interesting in the Eastern Conference, where teams 9-11 in the standings have shown some signs of life. The ninth-place Orlando Magic had lost nine of their previous 12 games before sweeping a home-and-home back-to-back against the Boston Celtics and Houston Rockets over the weekend. The 10th-place Detroit Pistons had lost 16 of 20 before Blake Griffin took revenge on the Clippers on Saturday. The 11th-place Washington Wizards, meanwhile, have beat the Oklahoma City Thunder, the Philadelphia 76ers and the Milwaukee Bucks in the last eight days, and almost knocked off the Toronto Raptors on Sunday. The West has remained dominant. Its winning percentage in interconference games (.587) is its second highest in the last 15 years, and the 11th-place Minnesota Timberwolves have a better record (against a tougher schedule) than the team (Brooklyn) that sits in seventh place in the East. But that doesn\u2019t mean that we can\u2019t enjoy a little drama for those last few playoff spots in the weaker conference. And it\u2019s not that weak at the top, where the Toronto Raptors sit with a five-game winning streak in hand and a big game in Boston this week.

This game marked the debut of interim coach Ryan Saunders, the son of franchise icon and former coach Flip Saunders. The Wolves got a monster night from Andrew Wiggins (40 points) and survived two late potential game-winning 3-pointers to claim the win. Celtics 135, Pacers 108 \u2014 This victory was Boston\u2019s fourth straight, which, in the course of a season is nothing to write home about. However, this was also the Celtics\u2019 fifth straight game with 30 or more assists, which is worth noting. Could this be the game where, months from now, we\u2019ll remember it as the one where it all came together for this Finals-hopeful squad? Bucks 116, Rockets 109 \u2014 There\u2019s a good chance teams that have Houston on their upcoming schedule will want to look at this game film. Milwaukee did a masterful job on Wednesday in not only beating the Rockets, but limiting some of what makes Kia MVP contender James Harden such a tough cover. The Bucks\u2019 myriad of defenders forced him to go right (away from his strong hand) and got an other-worldly game from Giannis Antetokounmpo to secure a key road win. Spurs 154, Thunder 147 (2 OT) \u2014 David Robinson, Tony Parker, George Gervin and now, LaMarcus Aldridge. The Spurs\u2019 big man joined the short list of the top scorers in San Antonio history with his 56-point barrage that was 100 percent old school in its execution (no 3-pointers taken). Not to be outdone, Russell Westbrook dropped in a massive triple-double in a Thursday night thriller. Rockets 141, Cavs 113 \u2014 A matchup between a 24-17 team (Houston) and a lottery-bound, 8-35 one (Cleveland) gets a nod here because of Harden \u2026 and Harden only. The Rockets\u2019 guard continued his sizzling scoring production (43 points) and added a triple-double for good measure (10 rebounds, 12 assists) to keep Houston (and himself) hot. Magic 116, Rockets 109 \u2014 Just when we\u2019re all about ready to write Orlando off as a playoff-contending squad, they pull out a big win to stay in the mix. Such was the case over the weekend, as they rallied on back-to-back nights, coming back to beat the Celtics on Saturday and doing likewise to the Rockets on Sunday. Orlando used a late 14-4 run to drop Houston and move up to No. 9 in the East. Raptors 140, Wizards 138 (2 OT) \u2014 Who says Toronto is watching Kawhi Leonard\u2019s minutes? The Raptors\u2019 star played a season-high 45 minutes, notching 41 points and 11 rebounds in a closer-than-it-should-have-been win in D.C. Toronto led by 23 at one point, but Bradley Beal (43 points, 15 assists, 10 rebounds) powered a Wizards\u2019 comeback that forced OT and another before Washington fell short. LaMarcus Aldridge (56 points, 20-33 FG, 16-16 FT, 9 reb, 4 ast in 48 minutes) \u2014 The Spurs\u2019 big man, always among the league leaders in mid-range attempts , was at his jump shooting best on Thursday night. Aldridge\u2019s path to 50 points was paved with 1990s-era goodness as he did not attempt a single 3-pointer and 13 of his 33 field goal attempts came from mid-range. | Watch | Video box score Anthony Davis (36 points, 14-20 FG, 13 reb, 3 ast, 2 stl, 2 blk in 35 minutes) \u2014 Seven dunks, pulling off a \u201cShammgod\u201d and more than a point per minute. Not too shabby for New Orleans\u2019 resident superstar, who shrugged off his scoring feats for the defensive work the Pelicans put together on Monday against Memphis. | Watch | Video box score Landry Shamet (29 points, 8-15 FG, 8-14 3pt FG, 3 reb in 23 minutes) \u2014 Rare is the rookie who gets a nod in this space, but we\u2019ve got to give it up for Shamet\u2019s performance off the bench. Yes, all but one of his field goals was a 3-pointer. That said, the Sixers needed his hot shooting to put away a pesky Wizards team on Tuesday night to keep from losing ground in the East playoff chase. | Watch | Video box score Nikola Jokic (29 points, 11-21 FG, 11 reb, 10 ast in 39 minutes) \u2014 Is any big man in the league more smooth and under control in pressure situations than Jokic? We\u2019re open to suggestions. However, before you suggest a name, watch Jokic\u2019s performance Tuesday in Miami \u2014 especially his game-winner with 2.4 seconds left \u2014 and then get back to us. | Watch | Video box score Klay Thompson (43 points, 18-29 FG, 7-16 3pt FG, 2 reb in 33 minutes) \u2014 Just about the time we\u2019re all ready to forget about Thompson, he goes out and reminds us he\u2019s still here. This was a prime Klay kind of game, with him sizzling from deep and doing it with minimal ball handling ( four dribbles all game , to be precise). | Watch | Video box score Kyle Kuzma (41 points, 16-24 FG, 5-10 3pt FG, 2 reb in 29 minutes) \u2014 The Lakers are trying to keep things together until LeBron James recovers fully from his groin injury. Credit Kuzma for doing his part on Wednesday night against Detroit, thanks in large part to a beastly performance around the basket all night long. | Watch | Video box score Karl-Anthony Towns (27 points, 10-23 FG, 27 reb, 3 ast, 2 stl in 37 minutes) \u2014 In a head-to-head showdown with fellow star big man Anthony Davis, it was Towns who put up the monster stat line in a win Saturday. His 27 rebounds were the most in a game to date in 2018-19 and made a key 3-pointer with 2:55 left to seal the win for Minnesota. | Watch | Video box score Kawhi Leonard (41 points, 15-29 FG, 11 reb, 5 ast, 3 stl, 2 blk in 45 minutes) \u2014 This game was another example of why Toronto traded for Leonard in the offseason. He had 13 straight points in the fourth quarter and overtime as he played in his most minutes since January of 2017. Overall, Leonard is averaging 31 points, 6.7 rebounds, 4.5 assists and 2.8 steals over his last six games.  | Watch | Video box score Bradley Beal (43 points, 17-36 FG, 6-12 3pt FG, 10 reb, 15 ast, 3 stl, 2 blk in 54 minutes) \u2014 Washington\u2019s go-to guy joined elite company with this showing on Sunday. He and Oscar Robertson are the only players in NBA history with multiple games of 40 points, 15 assists and 10 rebounds in a season. Robertson had three such games in 1961-62. | Watch | Video box score \u201cThe young guys don\u2019t know what it takes to be a championship level team. What it takes every day.

Everyone surpassed whatever they expected for themselves. This year? We all have high expectations. The players, the coaches, everyone. And that\u2019s good, but we aren\u2019t doing it yet.\u201d \u2014 Celtics guard Kyrie Irving \u201cI\u2019d be surprised if this team\u2019s not in the playoffs.

According to Chris Haynes of Yahoo Sports , the veteran big man is eager to secure a buyout from the Bulls in order to join two-time defending-champion Golden State Warriors. Chicago, however, reportedly has no intentions of letting Lopez walk only to bolster the already formidable Warriors. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s an NBA player that doesn\u2019t want to be on a winning team, a playoff team,\u201d Lopez told Yahoo Sports on Friday. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m kind of smack dab in the middle of the prime of my career. Who doesn\u2019t relish playing in playoff situations? That\u2019s something very appealing and whether that\u2019s something the organization and myself come together and decide, that\u2019s something we want to work towards with this team, or whether that\u2019s something that\u2019s going to happen somewhere else, I\u2019m just going to keep grinding. I think right now we definitely aspire to be a winning team, and I want to help out with that. Haynes reports that Lopez has not personally approached management about his future. \u201cI\u2019m not heavily involved in [buyout talks] because I try to stay focused in on the day-to-day,\u201d Lopez told Yahoo Sports. \u201cMy [agent] keeps me informed of the bigger bullet points, abreast of the more important news.\u201d Lopez got an up-close look at his desired team when the Warriors embarrassed Chicago by 37 points on Friday . The former 15th overall pick is playing just 16.3 minutes per game for the Bulls, the fewest since his final season in Phoenix (2011-12). Joe Cowley of the Chicago Sun-Times reports trading Lopez has been atop the Bulls\u2019 list of priorities for the last few months. However, they Bulls are seeking future Draft assets in any deals for their veteran players. The Bulls, 10-33, are in the midst of a seven-game losing streak and have lost 10 of their last 13 games overall."},{"id":46640,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/about-last-night-1-13-19","date":"2019-01-14","title":"About Last Night: Peak Kawhi coming?","content":"Led by Kawhi Leonard\u2019s stardom and an absurd abundance of depth, the Raptors have climbed and camped out atop the league standings. Their ceiling might be even higher if Leonard\u2019s apparent New Year\u2019s resolution to score more holds up. Less than two weeks after pouring 45 points on the Utah Jazz, the two-time All-Star dropped 41 in Toronto\u2019s 140-138 double-overtime win at Washington. The victory was Toronto\u2019s fifth straight and seventh in their last eight. Leonard is averaging 30.7 points, 7.0 rebounds, 3.9 assists and 2.4 steals in that stretch while shooting 54.3 percent from the field. When he attempts 22 shots or more, the Raptors are now 10-1. As for the Wizards, going toe-to-toe against the best has to feel good after the depressing first two months of the season. Washington had won five of its last seven entering Sunday\u2019s contest, thanks in large part to the dominant play of Bradley Beal . Since John Wall\u2019s absence (heel surgery) became permanent, Beal is averaging 30.2 points, 6.4 assists, 5.4 rebounds and 2.4 steals for a Wizards team that is only 2.5 games out of the playoffs. The seventh-year guard punctuated Sunday\u2019s monstrous triple-double \u2014 43 points, 15 assists, 10 rebounds \u2014 with game-tying baskets at the end of regulation and overtime. It doesn\u2019t hurt that Beal looks pretty comfortable in that go-to role. Sunday saw a whopping four players clear the 40-point mark. Stephen Curry joined Leonard and Beal thanks to the shot he has made look easier than anyone in NBA history. The two-time Kia MVP sank 11 3-pointers in Golden State\u2019s 119-114 win at Dallas, marking the 12th time in Curry\u2019s career he has made 10 or more in a game. That\u2019s far and away the best, with Nos. 2 and 3 on that list (Klay Thompson and J.R. Smith) combining for seven such performances. Curry\u2019s 11th and final triple \u2014 the last field goal of his mammoth 48-point night \u2014 put the Warriors up for good. Denver, meanwhile, saw its own MVP candidate go off for 40 points , 10 rebounds and eight assists. Nikola Jokic was just eight days removed from dropping 39 on Charlotte, and opposing defenses have even more to worry about if the 7-foot big man is moving like this: Orlando appeared in danger of cratering out of the Eastern Conference playoffs race, but a most unlikely weekend kept them in the conversation. One night after fending off a healthy Celtics squad, the Magic scored a shocking 116-109 upset over the scorching Houston Rockets. Nikola Vucevic (20.1 ppg, 11.9 rpg, 1.1 bpg, 1.0 spg) will garner All-Star consideration, but Terrence Ross blossoming as one of the league\u2019s best sixth men will be just as responsible for Orlando\u2019s remaining relevance moving forward. Count the Warriors coach among the Luka Doncic\u2019s growing fan base. Steve Kerr holds a vote when it comes to All-Star selections, and it sounds like he\u2019s open to applying it on the Mavericks rookie. \u201cWhether he makes it or not, he\u2019s an All-Star,\u201d Kerr said of Doncic on Sunday. \u201cCertain guys just stand out. You see what they do, you see what they mean to the game. If he doesn\u2019t make it this year, he\u2019s going to make it soon enough.\u201d James Harden\u2019s incredible scoring streak continued after his 38-point performance in Houston\u2019s head-scratching loss to the Magic. The effort tied Kobe Bryant\u2019s longest stretch of 30-point outings (16). His output came at efficiency\u2019s expense, however: the reigning MVP shot just 1-for-17 from 3, tied with Damon Stoudamire for the worst outside shooting mark in NBA history.

With 30 points through three quarters against Orlando on Sunday, the Rockets superstar matched Kobe Bryant\u2019s streak of 16 consecutive 30-point games, achieved in 2003. Those two mark the NBA\u2019s longest since Wilt Chamberlain strung together 20 such performances in 1964. Larry Jones (23 in 1969) and Connie Hawkins (16 in 1968) also hit those marks in the ABA. Harden finished with 38 points as the Magic rallied for a 116-109 victory over the Rockets. Harden was just 1-for-17 on 3-point attempts. He did get fouled three times shooting from beyond the arc and was 9 for 9 from the free throw line on those occasions (15 of 16 overall), but it was never enough to give the Rockets a comfortable advantage. Entering Sunday\u2019s game, the reigning Kia MVP was averaging 40.5 points, 7.3 rebounds and 9.5 assists in his previous 15 outings. He is attempting 15 3-pointers per game at a 40.9 percent clip during that stretch. However, his string of five or more 3-pointers in a game ended at 12 on Sunday. Bryant\u2019s 30-point streak ran from Jan. 29, 2003 to Feb. 28, 2003 and, within that streak, he had nine straight games with 40 or more points.

They sold him a max contract offer based on the idea of that vision, which even included a mock jersey retirement. The ink was hardly dry on Griffin\u2019s new contract before they dealt him to Detroit at midseason, pivoting to the nebulous world between contending and rebuilding. The five-time All-Star hasn\u2019t forgotten \u2014 unless you believe the 44 points in his first game as a Clippers opponent at Staples Center were merely coincidental. Meanwhile, the Clipper faithful were forcefully reminded of their best homegrown star during the franchise\u2019s LA era. The post moves. The improved jumper. And yes, the dunks. If those players or Detroit\u2019s 109-104 win weren\u2019t enough, Griffin might have sent a non-basketball message to the owner that ultimately signed off on his departure. Steve Ballmer was there and waiting for his former star to finish pregame warmups. Despite an extended hand and a verbal address, Ballmer was rewarded only with the sight of Griffin running off in the opposite direction. The Pistons forward denied the slight was intentional after the game \u2014 only to like a tweet that seemed to indicate his brush-off was calculated. Regardless, it appears the bridge between the Lob City era and one of its key members is all but severed. That rumbling you felt came from up north, where Karl-Anthony Towns and Anthony Davis waged a big man war reminiscent of the 1990s and its golden age of centers. Towns gobbled up an NBA season best 27 rebounds to go along with 27 points in Minnesota\u2019s 110-106 win over the Pelicans. Numbers like that have only been posted five times since 1984. Davis was hardly a slouch, slapping up a cool 30 points and 14 rebounds. It\u2019s the 54th time Davis has reached those numbers, tying him with Hall of Famer Nate Thurmond for 17th all-time. Only 448 more to go to catch Wilt Chamberlain. One night after Stephen Curry passed Jason Terry for third on the all-time made 3s list, Korver did the same to nestle just behind Curry at fourth. It was a good night for the accomplishment, as it helps erase one of the most unlikely sightings in NBA history: a Kyle Korver airball. The Jazz sharpshooter makes enough of them that we can forgive and forget that. The grass is not greener in Beantown, where the Celtics suffered a disappointing 105-103 loss to the Magic. The setback comes just days after Kyrie Irving dubbed a late-December team meeting as a turning point for the team. They might need another one after Irving\u2019s on-court confrontation with teammate Gordon Hayward, followed by some specific postgame criticism of his younger teammates. \u201cThe young guys don\u2019t know what it takes to be a championship level team,\u201d Irving said. \u201cWhat it takes every day. And if they think it is hard now, what do they think it will be like when we\u2019re trying to get to the Finals?\u201d Assuming \u201cyoung\u201d means under 25 years old, Irving\u2019s words apply to nine of the Celtics\u2019 17 rostered players. If the shot is this good, should a heartless buzzer really cancel it out completely?

Finishing the game 4-for-8, Korver sits on 2,284 total. While Korver could exchange spots with Curry here-and-there, considering their age difference (Korver turning 38 next month, is almost exactly seven years older) it\u2019s only a matter of time before Curry pulls away for good.

Collison announced his retirement this past May after spending all 15 years of his career with the Thunder franchise. His No. 4 will be the first number retired by the Thunder. \u201cI am thrilled that Nick Collison will be the first Thunder player to have their number retired in Oklahoma City,\u201d said Thunder Chairman Clayton I. Bennett. \u201cHe has cemented himself as part of the fabric of this community and our organization by setting an example of commitment, hard work and authenticity. Congratulations Nick.\u201d Over the course of his career, Collison appeared in 910 regular season games (177 starts) and posted career averages of 5.9 points, 5.2 rebounds and 1.0 assist in 20.4 minutes per game. Additionally, Collison saw action in 91 postseason games where he averaged 4.3 points and 3.8 rebounds in 16.8 minutes. \u201cNick Collison\u2019s career in Oklahoma City was unique. Unique in that he helped create the internal standards for work ethic, selflessness, citizenship and \u200eprofessionalism for an organization that was starting from scratch. Unique in that as a role player, he embedded himself as a legacy player for the Thunder because of his consistency both in times of success and adversity and respect for his teammates and the organization,\u201d said Thunder Executive Vice President and General Manager Sam Presti. \u201cIt is fitting that Nick will continue his unique and singular relationship with the organization by being our first retired number.\u201d Originally selected No. 12 overall in the 2003 NBA Draft, Collison is one of two players (Russell Westbrook) to spend the first 10 years of the Thunder era all with the team. He retired as one of Oklahoma City\u2019s leaders in games played (second, 602), assists (fourth, 638), blocks (fourth, 258), rebounds (fifth, 2,561), steals (sixth, 296) and points (sixth, 2,846). During his 10 seasons in Oklahoma City, Collison helped lead the Thunder to the second-best record in the NBA (.608; 489-315). The Iowa Falls native finished his career with 69 double-doubles and 184 games in which he scored in double figures.

While that may still be a ways off from happening, there\u2019s a handful of players who are making noise and could present a challenge to the kingdom. Meanwhile, another very familiar face is close to losing his spot in the chase. He\u2019d join a group of names that have been all too familiar to the OSPR (Dirk Nowitzki, Dwyane Wade, Pau Gasol). ATHO. LeBron James (33), Los Angeles Lakers Previous rank: ATHO Latest stats: Injured Season stats: 27.3 ppg, 8.3 rpg, 7.1 apg James, who has missed the last eight games with a strained groin, is progressing but will be out until at least Jan. 16 . He\u2019s been cleared for more on-court activities. In the meantime, his grip on the \u2018ATHO\u2019 standing continues to loosen, with a few names inching closer and closer to being in the same room as the King. ________________________________________________________ 1. LaMarcus Aldridge (33), San Antonio Spurs Previous rank: 1 Latest stats: 7 games, 24.7 ppg, 5.7 rpg, 3.6 apg Season stats: 19.8 ppg, 8.6 rpg, 2.4 apg The scoring and shooting have been there (20 or more points in six of last eight; 50 percent or better from the field in seven of eight), but the rebounding continues to be a letdown. Aldridge has just one double-figure rebound game in the last 12. You won\u2019t be overthrowing the King if you\u2019re not filling up the box score. 2. Lou Williams (32), LA Clippers Previous rank: 4 Latest stats: 6 games, 23.2 ppg, 4.0 rpg, 5.2 apg Season stats: 18.5 ppg, 2.7 rpg, 4.9 apg Williams has eclipsed the 20-point mark in four of the last six despite averaging just 27.7 minutes. He\u2019s also connected on two or more 3s in three straight. In fact, he\u2019s failed to score in double figures just twice since Nov. 25, a span of 17 games. And we\u2019d be missing the mark if we didn\u2019t mention Williams\u2019 career-high 36 points last Friday. 3. J.J. Redick (34), Philadelphia 76ers Previous rank: 3 Latest stats: 4 games, 19.0 ppg, 1.5 rpg, 2.3 apg Season stats: 18.3 ppg, 2.3 rpg, 2.8 apg He missed the last two games with back spasms, but that wasn\u2019t enough to bump him down a rung. In the four games he did play, Redick shot a respectable 47.9 from the field and 44.8 from deep. He also managed to score 18 or more points in three of the four while nailing 13 treys over that span. 4. Marc Gasol (33), Memphis Grizzlies Previous rank: 2 Latest stats: 7 games, 13.1 ppg, 8.7 rpg, 5.3 apg Season stats: 15.7 ppg, 8.7 rpg, 4.5 apg Most of the time, one impressive game can prevent you from sliding down the list. Not this time, as Gasol\u2019s other six performances left such a bad taste in our mouth. Outside of Wednesday\u2019s 26-point, 14-rebound showing, the big man failed to score more than 15 while also being held under 10 points twice. 5. Kyle Lowry (32), Toronto Raptors Previous rank: 5 Latest stats: 2 games, 14.0 ppg, 2.5 rpg, 7.0 apg Season stats: 14.4 ppg, 4.3 rpg, 9.6 apg Had any of the names below him made substantial noise, Lowry definitely would have slipped down at least one spot. That said, he did manage to score 12 or more points, dish out six or more assists and snatch three or more steals in both games. Of course the shooting (40.9 FG%) left a lot to be desired. 6. Marvin Williams (32), Charlotte Hornets Previous rank: 6 Latest stats: 7 games, 12.7 ppg, 6.0 rpg, 1.4 apg Season stats: 10.2 ppg, 5.6 rpg, 1.1 apg Williams is another example of doing just enough to keep his position. What really stood out were the home-away splits. In three home games, Williams averaged 8.7 points, 5.0 rebounds and 32.1 FG%. In four road games, he averaged 15.8 points, 6.8 rebounds and 47.1 FG%. Maybe he\u2019s afraid of getting an MJ \u2018love\u2019 tap . 7. DeMarre Carroll (32), Brooklyn Nets Previous rank: Just missed Latest stats: 6 games, 18.2 ppg, 5.2 rpg, 2.3 apg Season stats: 10.7 ppg, 4.8 rpg, 1.1 apg Despite averaging 24.1 minutes (his lowest since \u201912-13), Carroll is on a solid run, notching 15 or more points in six straight while shooting 54.7 from the field and 48.6 from deep in the process. If we\u2019re going to nitpick, we\u2019d like to see more work on the boards, as Carroll has just one double-digit rebounding game this season. 8. Gerald Green (32), Houston Rockets Previous rank: NA Latest stats: 6 games, 14.8 ppg, 3.3 rpg, 0.5 apg Season stats: 8.9 ppg, 2.7 rpg, 0.4 apg Green has stepped up during Chris Paul\u2019s extended absence. After averaging 21.1 minutes in December, Green has seen the court for 29.9 minutes in January. He\u2019s rewarding coach Mike D\u2019Antoni for the extra playing time, shooting 49.2 from the field, 40.0 from deep and scoring more than 15 in four of the last six. 9. Jeff Green (32), Washington Wizards Previous rank: NA Latest stats: 7 games, 13.6 ppg, 5.4 rpg, 3.7 apg Season stats: 11.4 ppg, 4.8 rpg, 1.7 apg There was nothing spectacular about the last seven games from Green, but it was good enough to make it onto the bottom of our list. Despite seeing his double-figure scoring streak snapped at six, Green has emerged as a consistent scoring option for the Wizards, who need to extra punch with John Wall out for the season. 10. Chris Paul (33), Houston Rockets Previous rank: 8 Latest stats: Injured Season stats: 15.6 ppg, 4.0 rpg, 8.0 apg Recovering from a hamstring injury that will likely keep him sidelined until the end of January, Paul is barely hanging on to a spot on our list. While he\u2019ll likely lose his spot in the next edition, we aren\u2019t going out on a big limb when we predict he\u2019ll be back in the top tier before it\u2019s all said and done.

Not only did the Mavericks\u2019 rookie sensation hit the game-deciding 3 in Friday\u2019s 119-115 victory over the Timberwolves, he nailed two other go-ahead buckets in the final two minutes, becoming the first rookie to do so since Vince Carter in April, 1999. Doncic finished with 29 points, 8 rebounds and 12 assists \u2014 just shy of his first triple-double, which would\u2019ve matched Markelle Fultz for youngest ever at 19 years, 317 days old. He still has 48 days to join him as the only teenagers to do it. And that late flurry rendered irrelevant an awesome game by Karl-Anthony Towns, who put up 30 points, 11 rebounds and 4 blocks, including this soul-crusher on Wes Matthews: Yet Doncic wasn\u2019t the only rising star soaring in a clutch moment, as Hawks rookie Kevin Huerter\u2019s long-distance 3 set up second-year man John Collins for an unguardable, ice water fade to steal back a game it looked like the Sixers were closing out. Collins finished with 25 points and nine rebounds; Huerter posted 29 points, three assists and two steals. Toss in Trae Young and the Hawks, quietly, seem to be establishing a foundation for the future. Note that bomb might not have been Huerter\u2019s best shot of the night. Just take the letter. Let\u2019s get to it, shall we? Good talk, see you out there. For the second night in a row, someone staked a claim to third place on an all-time list. Thursday, it was Pop; Friday, it was Steph Curry. With his third triple (No. 2,282 overall) in Friday\u2019s 146-109 blowout of the Bulls, the two-time Kia MVP passed Jason Terry; Curry now trails only Reggie Miller (2,560; 1,389 games) and Ray Allen (2,973; 1,300 games). The kicker is that Curry\u2019s gotten there in roughly half their games played . It\u2019s only been 656 in the books for Steph, who\u2019s been dropping more than 250 threes in each healthy season since 2012-13, including that bananas 402 in \u201915-16. Assuming pace, that next 700 could come by the end of calendar year 2020(!!), if not that \u201920-21 season, which Curry would complete at age 33. Lotta time to run up the score on that one, yikes. Tomas Satoranksy set the bar early, tallying 18 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists in the Wizards\u2019 113-106 victory against a Giannis-less Bucks squad. Ben Simmons cleared it with 23, 10 and 15 against the Hawks. Also, James Harden did this: \u2026 in 30 minutes. Chalk up a 43-point, 10-rebound, 12-assist 3\u00d72 on the game log, which has now officially rocketed out of orbit. With Doncic and Blazers center Jusuf Nurkic (11 points, 11 rebounds, eight assists, six blocks) both threatening to join the club on Friday, it nearly set a new mark for most in a single day of action. Alas, the record stands at four, achieved three times to date, most recently on Feb. 25, 1999. Victor Oladipo and the Pacers generally crushed it at life at The Garden, routing the hapless Knicks 121-106 as the star guard posted 19 points, six assists and four rebounds. That said, Oladipo did put up five turnovers, including this Shaqtin\u2019-bound lowlight: Sometimes dunking is an Everyday Struggle.

With all due respect, Mr. \u201cGreek Freak,\u201d the basketball world begs to differ. You are definitely there, sir, based on your performance through the midpoint of this NBA season. In fact, if there were hardware to hand out from Kia Race to the MVP Ladder HQ at this point, Antetokounmpo would be the recipient (edging out a crowded field that includes the reigning MVP, James Harden). By the grace of the scheduling gods, the two leading candidates just happened to hook up on Wednesday night, the official halfway point of 2018-19 . And they put on a show worthy of MVP mention, with Antetokounmpo\u2019s Milwaukee Bucks knocking off Harden\u2019s Houson Rockets at Toyota Center. Harden continued his torrid scoring streak, collecting his league-leading 14th 40-point game of the season . In doing so, he tied Tracy McGrady for the second-longest 30-point streak since the ABA\/NBA merger at 14. (Kobe Bryant has the record at 16 straight.) But Harden didn\u2019t have his most efficient outing (shooting 13-for-30 overall with nine turnovers) as the Bucks took control late. All Antentokounmpo did was shred the Rockets for 27 points on eight-for-16 shooting to go along with a career-high 21 rebounds, five assists and yet another showcase performance for his MVP resume. (The Bucks pounded the Rockets to the tune of a 70-24 advantage in points in the paint and outscored them 19-2 in fast break points.) The Bucks have won seven of their past eight games heading into tonight\u2019s game against the Washington Wizards at Capital One Arena ( 7 ET, NBA League Pass ). They\u2019ve stormed the top of the Eastern Conference standings and own a 10-5 record over Western Conference opponents with Antetokounmpo as their undisputed leader and, yes, MVP. Not there yet, huh? Yeah, right. * * * The top five this week in the 2018-19 Kia Race to the MVP Ladder: * * * Last week:  No. 2 Season stats:  26.6 points, 12.8 rebounds, 6.0 assists, 1.5 blocks, 1.3 steals Antetokounmpo seems to be the only person on the planet who isn\u2019t moved by his consistent brilliance this season. If he doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s \u201cthere yet,\u201d then the rest of the league should brace themselves for whatever comes next. He\u2019s been an unstoppable force on both ends of the floor, but particularly as an offensive catalyst on one of the most improved teams in the league. Doing it without the aid of a reliable long-distance shot is what has made watching Antetokounmpo crush the competition so intriguing. If there was any skepticism about the Bucks being both a legitimate threat in the East and a title contender, that should be vanishing as the second half of the season begins. As long as Antetokounmpo stays focused and healthy (he\u2019s probable Friday with right quadriceps soreness and a left hip bruise), the possibilities are endless. Last week:  No. 1 Season stats:  33.9 points, 8.6 assists, 6.0 rebounds, 2.0 steals Harden has moved into hallowed ground with his current scoring barrage, as his 14 straight games of 30-plus points ties Hall of Famer (and fellow Rockets legend) Tracy McGrady for the second-longest streak since the ABA\/NBA merger. Those debates about whether or not Harden is the best offensive player ever aren\u2019t out of line, not when you consider the way he generates offense for himself and his teammates. Harden has a chance to obliterate the record with the Rockets\u2019 friendly upcoming schedule (they play seven of their next 10 games at Toyota Center). The only glitch for Harden as he\u2019s hit this nuclear level is the one key flaw in his game is rising, too. He\u2019s averaging 5.7 turnovers this season, which ties his career-high from 2016-17 . He\u2019s up to 7.3 tpg in his last five games, which he, of course, would point out is world-class nit-picking of a guy playing as well as he is. Last week:  No. 3 Season stats:  28.9 points, 5.5 assists, 5.2 rebounds, 1.3 steals Curry shot a rather un-Splash Brother-ish 5-for-19 in Tuesday\u2019s home win against the New York Knicks, which includes an ugly 3-for-12 showing from 3-point range. That was a huge come down from his 42-point outburst (including 10 made 3-pointers) Saturday in a road win against the Sacramento Kings. But as often happens with a rare rough shooting night for the two-time former MVP, Curry displayed a brilliant floor game against the Knicks. He finished with 14 assists (and just one turnover) while grabbing seven rebounds as Klay Thompson went off for 43 points and Kevin Durant dropped 24. Curry\u2019s had just three hiccups since returning from his 11-game, groin-injury induced absence on Dec. 1. Over his last 18 games, Curry has failed to score at least 20 points only once. What should worry the Chicago Bulls, who visit Oracle tonight ( 10:30 ET, NBA League Pass ), is what Curry has done in those other two games after he struggled (averaged 32.0 points). Last week:  No. 4 Season stats:  27.3 points, 7.8 rebounds, 3.1 assists, 1.9 steals MVP voters must decide if the work Leonard did while he was playing outweighs how good the Raptors were all season whether he was in or out of the lineup. As convenient as it might be to try to diminish what Leonard has done by knocking him for the games he missed, you\u2019d be wise to pay attention to just how good he\u2019s been when he plays. The Milwaukee Bucks can certainly attest to his impact after what Leonard did to them Saturday. He logged 30 points and a season-high five steals, playing his trademark lockdown defense, as the Raptors won the battle between the NBA\u2019s top two teams (in the standings). Leonard has such tight control over his own game that he continues to play as efficiently as anyone on this list. He has notched eight games this season where he\u2019s scored 30 or more points while shooting better than 50 percent, including his last two games (30 on 50 percent shooting in the win against the Bucks and 31 points on 61.1 percent shooting in Tuesday\u2019s win against the Hawks). Last week:  No. 7 Season stats:  19.2 points, 10.2 rebounds, 7.6 assists, 1.5 steals Jokic continues to deliver for the Nuggets in every category, doing his crafty best to help keep coach Michael Malone\u2019s team at the top of the Western Conference . He notched his 21st career triple-double ( 18 points, 14 rebounds, 10 assists and two blocks ) in Thursday\u2019s win over the LA Clippers. It was his second straight triple-double, coming two days after lighting up the Heat in Miami for 29 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists . In doing so, he tied Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for the second-most career triple-doubles by a center and can now chase Wilt Chamberlain\u2019s big man record of 78. Jokic will probably dig into that deficit considerably the season if he keeps playing the way he has to kick off 2019 (27.2 points on .523 shooting, 12.6 rebounds, 7.2 assists and 1.4 steals in his last five games ). Jokic and the rest of the Nuggets are focused on team goals first, of course. After missing out on the playoffs on the season\u2019s final night in 2017-18, they\u2019re making sure to avoid any such drama this time. * * * 6. Paul George, Oklahoma City Thunder 7.

That\u2019s a subjective opinion, of course. ( Wizards-Suns and Rockets-Warriors would like a word.) But here are some indisputable facts from the Spurs\u2019 154-147, double-overtime triumph: And that says nothing about the sheer drama we were treated to along the way. As you would imagine for a game featuring 114 field goals, there were any number of twists and turns as the Thunder battled back from 16 down in the second quarter, and seven with 3 minutes, 14 seconds left in regulation. That set up a wild \u201cfinish\u201d in which Grant\u2019s layup off a lob from Westbrook tied the game at 130 with 5.6 remaining, and DeMar DeRozan \u2014 one of the few players who didn\u2019t quite rise to the occasion \u2014 missed from midrange at the buzzer. The extra sessions belonged to Aldridge, who followed James Harden, LeBron James, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, Blake Griffin, Kemba Walker and Derrick Rose to become the ninth player to score 50 or more this season . While the Thunder gradually sputtered, the Spurs just kept pumping the ball to Aldridge inside, and the 13-year veteran kept delivering. He finished with 13 of the Spurs\u2019 24 points over the final 10 minutes, frequently feasting on the undersized Grant as Thunder center Steven Adams struggled with a sprained ankle. Aldridge was hyper efficient along the way, hitting 20-of-33 shots and all 16 free throws for the NBA\u2019s highest point total without a single 3-point attempt since Shaquille O\u2019Neal went off for 61 in 2000. And that, along with the Spurs\u2019 ridiculous 3-point shooting and a massive block by White down the stretch, is what it took against a game opponent in a contest with zero margin for error. \u201cI was just trying to be dominant,\u201d said Aldridge, clutching the game ball. \u201cI felt good, and I was just going. Just trying to get to the rim. I had a good rhythm. We try to play inside-out, and it worked tonight. That\u2019s a good team over there, and we had to stay calm \u2026 and we did it.\u201d Kyrie Irving can do so many things on the basketball court. With full credit for the effort, contesting the rim is not one of them. This, Uncle Drew, is how it\u2019s done, courtesy of your hard-nosed teammate, Marcus Smart. Enjoy the latest highlight-reel dime from one of the best passing big men to ever play this game en route to his fifth triple-double of the season. Jokic finished with 18 points, 14 rebounds and 10 assists in the Nuggets\u2019 121-100 victory over the Clippers."},{"id":36360,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/gregg-popovich-moves-3rd-all-time-coaching-wins","date":"2019-01-11","title":"Gregg Popovich climbs to third in all-time coaching victories","content":" San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich stands alone, now third all-time in NBA career coaching victories.

(AP) \u2014 LeBron James\u2019 strained groin is turning out to be perhaps the most significant injury of the famously durable superstar\u2019s 16-year NBA career. James likely will miss at least three more games after being cleared to increase his on-court activity in his comeback from the injury, the Lakers announced Thursday after an evaluation by their medical staff. The Lakers say James\u2019 healing is \u201cprogressing,\u201d and the four-time NBA MVP will participate in more functional basketball activities during the upcoming week. But the team also says it will provide another update on Jan. 16, which probably means James will miss the Lakers\u2019 three upcoming games against Utah, Cleveland and Chicago. If James sits out as expected, he will miss 11 consecutive games before his next update, and he will have been out of action for over three weeks since getting hurt during the Lakers\u2019 win at Golden State on Christmas. Those are significant numbers: James never missed more than 13 games during any of his first 15 NBA seasons, and he never sat out for more than two full weeks during his decorated tenures with the Cavaliers or the Miami Heat. The Lakers and James, who turned 34 last month, are being prudent with this injury to a star famous for playing through all types of physical ailments, both major and minor. He has never missed a playoff game despite innumerable minor knocks, and he played in all 82 games for the Cavs last season while leading the NBA in minutes played in both the regular season and the postseason. Before his injury, James was off to yet another outstanding start in his first season with the Lakers, who are a playoff contender after missing the postseason in a franchise-record five consecutive years. James is the NBA\u2019s sixth-leading scorer with 27.3 points per game along with 8.3 rebounds and 7.1 assists. The Lakers (23-19) began Thursday in eighth place in the Western Conference standings after beating Detroit on Wednesday night to improve to 3-5 in James\u2019 absence. Fans haven\u2019t forgotten about him, of course: James leads the NBA with 2,779,812 votes for a spot on the Western Conference\u2019s All-Star team, according to returns released earlier Thursday. The Lakers traveled to Salt Lake City on Thursday to face the Jazz on Friday night, followed by a return for home games against the Cavs and Bulls. The next update on James\u2019 condition will be delivered one day before the Lakers travel to Oklahoma City to begin a difficult stretch of consecutive games against the Thunder, Rockets and Warriors."},{"id":36429,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/hang-time-podcast-giannis-harden-utah-jazz","date":"2019-01-10","title":"Hang Time Podcast: Giannis vs. Harden + latest from Utah","content":"John Schuhmann and I break down the Bucks\u2019 big win over the Rockets in Houston on Wednesday.

(AP) \u2014 DeMarcus Cousins will start immediately for coach Steve Kerr when the All-Star center makes his long-awaited Warriors debut in about a week following a lengthy recovery from surgery on a torn left Achilles tendon. Cousins has targeted Golden State\u2019s game Jan. 18 at the Clippers as his return date and first game of the season, though Kerr said it could even be sooner if all continues going well \u2013 perhaps even against his former New Orleans team at home next Wednesday. \u201cThe idea is we have to give ourselves a little leeway,\u201d Kerr said Thursday. \u201cThat Clipper game is sort of the one we\u2019ve targeted but we should give ourselves some leeway on either side, because we have to see how the next week goes. I suppose it\u2019s a possibility that it could be New Orleans, maybe there\u2019s a possibility it\u2019s whoever\u2019s after the Clippers \u2026 Lakers. That\u2019s the range that we\u2019re looking at.\u201d The coaching staff has spent the past couple of weeks more intensely planning for Cousins\u2019 return and how he will be incorporated into different rotations throughout games, while also holding regular discussions with Cousins about the plan. \u201cIt\u2019s a relief. It\u2019s been a long year for me, a lot of ups and downs,\u201d Cousins said after practice Thursday. \u201cBut the finish line is ahead and I\u2019m extremely excited to be back on the floor. The big man has made significant strides with his condition in recent scrimmages, showing Kerr and the Warriors medical staff he is nearly ready to play in games again. Cousins tore his Achilles late last January and it prematurely ended his season with the Pelicans. Before the injury, Cousins averaged 25.2 points, 12.9 rebounds and 5.4 assists in 48 games. The 28-year-old Cousins doesn\u2019t expect to dominate from Day 1, especially playing in a lineup that will feature four other All-Stars \u2013 Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson. Kerr said he hasn\u2019t thought about the star-studded lineup yet, knowing there\u2019s still half the season to go for Cousins to get comfortable and acclimated. Not that the fiery Cousins, known for drawing technical fouls, will change. He loves that Kerr and Green and the others love to show their emotions during games. \u201cSame person. I play with a chip on my shoulder,\u201d Cousins said. \u201cI use different things as fuel to keep me moving forward. I\u2019m going to use the same things. I\u2019m looking forward to proving myself on the floor.\u201d Cousins is appreciative of the support he received from family to get through the tough days of rehab. In turn, the young Warriors centers were grateful for the guidance from Cousins as he dealt with watching night in and night out from the bench. \u201cA lot of things switch up for you when you kind of are out of the picture. Reality hits,\u201d Cousins said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of an out-of-sight, out-of-mind type of thing. A lot of people that were all about you kind of disappear. Reality hits you and you realize the people that really are in your corner, so this was a good year for me on top of all the negatives because you really realize who\u2019s in your corner.
