Chris Haynes of Yahoo Sports reports that Green even challenged his superstar teammate to leave. \u201cWe don\u2019t need you. We won without you,\u201d was the emotional forward\u2019s verbal gauntlet. Green and Durant were reunited on Thursday, and they appeared to have put the recent past behind them in the opening minutes. Things fell apart quickly after that, however, with the Warriors toppling to the Rockets 107-86 . Durant shot just 6 for 15, Green had as many turnovers as assists (five) and failed to score, and the Warriors simply looked shell-shocked.  It\u2019d be foolish to not mention the absence of two-time Kia MVP Stephen Curry (groin). It would also be equally silly to dismiss the remaining two-time Finals MVP (Durant), former Kia Defensive Player of the Year (Green), and a historically great 3-point shooter (Klay Thompson). It\u2019s too early in the season \u2014 and too soon after the Green-Durant tiff \u2014 to tell whether the Warriors\u2019 latest mini-drama will last. For Golden State, however, every day with their current dynastic makeup matters. Durant\u2019s free agency inches closer. The ripple effects from it will be very real and very expensive, one way or another. Will a November confrontation matter? Don\u2019t ask Durant. The Carmelo Anthony experiment came to a very abrupt end in Houston with the Rockets parting ways with the 10-time All-Star after just 13 games. Now they will rely on other means to replace the presence of Trevor Ariza and Luc Mbah a Moute, both of whom defected during the offseason. Night one of that adjustment went pretty well. The Rockets entered Thursday as a bottom-half team on defense. Then they held the Warriors to just 42.1 percent shooting, including a frigid 4-for-18 from 3-point range. Just as telling was who picked up the 30 nightly minutes that are now available with Anthony out of the picture. It\u2019s a one-night snapshot from a blowout win, but telling nuggets can still be found. Ennis and Clark are now Houston\u2019s best big wings not named PJ Tucker, and they\u2019re already being asked to shoulder a bigger load. Isaiah Hartenstein provided valuable stretch five minutes behind Capela and was a plus-27 in that playing time. On nights they don\u2019t produce, coach Mike D\u2019Antoni won\u2019t hesitate to bump his regulars\u2019 minutes back into the mid-30s. As for Anthony, don\u2019t assume that a win over the Warriors makes his odd departure any easier to witness for the stars who have shone alongside him. Speaking of stars having each other\u2019s backs\u2026 That\u2019s \u2744\ufe0f, Dwyane. At what point did DeMar DeRozan\u2019s brilliant, brilliant mind say, \u201cYeah, this the best and easiest way to score these two points right here\u201d? We need to see Chuck win one of these someday."},{"id":37421,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/lopez-twins-center-nba-evolution","date":"2018-11-16","title":"Lopez twins at center of NBA revolution","content":" Given their genealogy and shared background at Stanford, what\u2019s going on with Brook and Robin Lopez would seem to ripe for one of those scientific research studies on twins in some lab in Palo Alto, Calif. Short of that, it speaks to the divergent circumstances of their respective NBA teams, while offering up the veteran 7-foot centers as poster guys for the current challenges faced by the league\u2019s big men. On one side, you\u2019ve got Brook Lopez and the opportunities he and the Milwaukee Bucks have seized through the season\u2019s first four weeks. The Bucks have been bombing through their early schedule with one of the most unabashed 3-point-centric attacks , using their Lopez as a so-called stretch five. Head-scratchingly so, in fact, if you were to base his role on the first eight years he played in this league. On the other side, you\u2019ve got Robin Lopez, and the predicament he\u2019s in with the Chicago Bulls. The Bulls are down near the bottom of the Eastern Conference again, this time not by design (they played for lottery balls in 2017-18) but by the distress of multiple injuries. And yet their Lopez, though healthy, has been relegated to deep reserve and rah-rah status from the side as coach Fred Hoiberg and the team\u2019s front office focus on the team\u2019s younger players. Same age (30), same size, same position, same DNA. But with just enough variance in their skill sets and surroundings to yield almost diametrically opposed results. The brothers both will be in the house at Milwaukee\u2019s new Fiserv Forum Friday night ( 9:30 ET, ESPN ) for their 19th head-to-head meeting since they got to the NBA, five picks apart, in the 2008 Draft . But their current fortunes hardly could be more different. Right now, nurture is kicking nature\u2019s butt. The nickname crystallized on Twitter, courtesy of one @2LTDiesel, even as Milwaukee was still busy beating the Nuggets 121-114 Sunday in Denver. That\u2019s the game in which Brook Lopez essentially auditioned for a role in the Golden State Warriors\u2019 backcourt by hitting eight of his 13 3-point attempts, including 6-of-7 in the third quarter. Once on a roll, he seemed oblivious to the exact location of the 3-point line, needing to know only that he was behind it before he launched. At a time in league history when lumbering 7-footers represent little else besides obsolescence, Brook Lopez was going all Steph Curry or Klay Thompson on the Nuggets and on us. So there it was: One of the league\u2019s biggest players making like one of the Splash Brothers? \u201cSplash Mountain\u201d was born. Surely his brother and best friend Robin must have spoken to Brook and gotten some feel for his sibling\u2019s excitement. After all, they talk by phone daily. \u201cNo,\u201d Robin said 24 hours later, flatly, about asking Brook about the game he had. \u201cNot one time. It seems like they\u2019re doing pretty well. Looks like he\u2019s having fun out there.\u201d Fact is, while the brothers talk every day, they rarely discuss their jobs. They are a creative and curious pair, fans of comic books and cartoons (Robin had on a Chip \u2018N\u2019 Dale T-shirt before the Bulls game Monday, two characters from the Lopez\u2019s beloved Disney staple). They\u2019re intrigued by art, history, tech and hundreds of other topics, but claim to seldom, if ever, talk basketball. About the closest they come in regards to each other are some teasing jabs. Their publicly snarky relationship drew attention when Robin played for the Knicks in 2015-16, with Brook across the river in Brooklyn. Now they\u2019re geographically close again, 90 miles by way of I-94, Brook on a one-year deal with the Bucks while Robin is in the final year of his contract with Chicago. Sure enough, Robin had a dig for this occasion. \u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d he said of the Bucks\u2019 fit for his brother, \u201cthey\u2019ve figured out, what\u2019s best for him is, figuring out one thing he\u2019s really good at, limiting him, not giving him too much responsibility out there.\u201d Uh, not exactly. Milwaukee coach Mike Budenholzer has welcomed Lopez\u2019s size in recent clashes with the likes of Joel Embiid, Karl-Anthony Towns and Nikola Jokic. Neither of the Lopez brothers dazzles as a rebounder, but their fundamentals in attending to the boards historically boosts their teams\u2019 results in that category. Still, it is Lopez\u2019s ability to shoot from deep that has the Bucks revving so high. And this stretch five is a guy who made only three of 31 3-pointers (9.7 percent) in his first eight years combined.  So what gives? He made it sound like a skill lost but resurrected. \u201cA lot of players growing up can shoot the ball,\u201d Brook Lopez said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re just playing, scrimmaging or playing high school ball, you shoot it a little bit. But when I came into the league, I was really just a back-to-the-basket guy. There weren\u2019t many teams looking for a stretch-five then. \u201cSo it wasn\u2019t something I even thought about doing. I focused on getting my points in the paint. I still shot mid-range twos, but we never thought about pushing it past the three.\u201d That changed in the fall of 2016. Kenny Atkinson took over as head coach, bringing principles shared by his boss in Atlanta \u2013 the same Budenholzer for whom he nowplays. Encouraged to dust off that skill, Lopez launched 387 3-pointers for the Nets in 2016-17 and hit 134 (34.6 percent). That continued last season with the Lakers, where Lopez nearly matched his Brooklyn numbers. Now, green-lit with the Bucks and so far successful 41.8 percent of the time (41 of 98), he is on pace to shatter all 3-point marks for 7-footers. This is not unlike Clippers big man DeAndre Jordan unexpectedly cranking up his free-throw proficiency this season. Identifying it as a trend finally got Robin to chime in. \u201cWe\u2019ve all evolved as players throughout our tenure in the league,\u201d the Bulls big man said. \u201cThere have been times we recognize, \u2018I need to get better at this particular aspect of the game.\u2019 When someone like DeAndre or Brooks \u2026 recognizes, \u2018I want to work on this,\u2019 they know what it takes to get better at it.\u201d For the league\u2019s tallest, broadest players, with offenses focused on the fast and the far, there truly is a sense of adapt or perish. Brook is out in front of that \u2014 sometimes 26 feet out. \u201cI was playing inside and out in Brooklyn when I started shooting threes,\u201d he said. \u201cThen going to L.A., it was a big adjustment for me. My [playing] time went down, my usage went down. A lot of times I found myself just spacing the floor. \u201cIt was a whole new world for me. It was, \u2018OK, I\u2019ve got to find my shots from here now.\u2019 I wasn\u2019t finding my normal bunnies in the post or anything like that. \u2018I\u2019m just sitting and spacing \u2013 that\u2019s my job.\u2019 It was a big adjustment, getting the rhythm right and everything. \u201cI\u2019m pretty comfortable into that now and I\u2019ve kind of found my niche, as far as my rhythm.\u201d  Robin Lopez was penciled in as the Bulls\u2019 starting center this season. He was, after all, a highly paid ($14.3 million) veteran who had started all 450 games he had played since 2012-13. Chicago\u2019s other bigs were short on experience, raw in their skills or both: Bobby Portis, Cristiano Felicio, 2018 all-rookie Lauri Markkanen and newcomer Wendell Carter, Jr., the prized lottery pick for whom the Bulls steered themselves downward in the standings. Then everything got fast-tracked. Injuries to Markkanen and Portis, along with guards Kris Dunn and Denzel Valentine, have shifted Chicago\u2019s agenda. Carter\u2019s precociousness at both ends and off the court showed he could handle more minutes than anticipated. And Lopez\u2019s handling of the home stretch last spring, when he was a healthy scratch from 18 of the Bulls\u2019 final 26 games, had him facing the situation again. As helpful as Lopez was two years ago when the Bulls still were striving for the playoffs, as well as he played (10.4 ppg and 6.4 rpg), the bushy haired-and-scraggly bearded center fits neither the team\u2019s current timeline nor Hoiberg\u2019s preferred style of play. This Lopez is, er, a traditional NBA big \u2013 4-of-21 from the 3-point line over 11 seasons. \u201cHe\u2019s very talented and I think he can shoot the ball too,\u201d said brother Brook, who always has been the more offensive-adept twin (17.8 ppg vs. Robin\u2019s 8.9 in their careers). \u201cI\u2019ve seen it first-hand, growing up, playing with him my whole life. I know the value he adds to a team. \u201cObviously, the situation in Chicago, he\u2019s being professional. They\u2019re trying to play their young guys, and that\u2019s the way they want to go regardless of what happens on the court.\u201d Robin Lopez doesn\u2019t like it, mind you. He talked with the coaching staff about the diminished role and expectations. It generally is assumed Chicago would trade him if they could find a taker for his salary. But unlike last spring, when he sat on the side in street clothes, he is in uniform and available. Mostly he\u2019s called when one of the young guys picks up early fouls or if a particular substitution or matchup arises. \u201cI\u2019m a competitive person,\u201d Robin Lopez said. \u201cSo at first it was a change for me. But now, it\u2019s always just a pleasure to be in the arena. To be with the guys. To have some role on the team. Whatever I\u2019m doing, whether I\u2019m stepping on the floor or not.\u201d Said Carter, the quick-study rookie: \u201cIt\u2019s a great honor that he\u2019s allowing that to happen without too much pushback. He\u2019s being realistic. He knows what\u2019s going on. He\u2019s a great helper \u2013 he\u2019s not selfish at all. Behind close doors, he tells me where to be on defense, where to be on offense, how to be a great teammate. He wants to help me take over his role in a very good way.\u201d Or, as Lopez said recently about potentially getting cranky and refusing to help: \u201cI\u2019d be a huge jackass.\u201d Being as this is a Lopez, though, sibling deprecation is even better than self-deprecation. Asked if he was happy for his brother\u2019s re-invention in Milwaukee, for the step he has taken in his game and how Brook is getting some credit for the Bucks\u2019 strong start, Robin shrugged. \u201cSure.\u201d Brook responded in kind, verifying that \u2013 as much as their work situations change \u2013 the brothers\u2019 dynamic remains intact. Asked if he expected to bang against Robin Friday for the 19th time as NBA opponents (each man\u2019s team has won nine times), or perhaps wave to him from the court while Robin sits all night in warm-ups, Brook seized yet another opportunity. \u201cI\u2019m going to do my job regardless,\u201d Brook Lopez said. \u201cHonestly, I guess selfishly \u2013 but mean to Robin \u2013 I\u2019d rather he be out there so I could destroy him.\u201d * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Rockets general manager Daryl Morey released a statement Thursday saying the team is \u201cparting ways\u201d with Anthony and \u201cworking toward a resolution.\u201d Anthony played just 10 games for Houston after signing a one-year, $2.4 million deal during the offseason. Morey added that: \u201cCarmelo had a tremendous approach during his time with the Rockets and accepted every role head coach Mike D\u2019Antoni gave him. The fit we envisioned when Carmelo chose to sign with the Rockets has not materialized, therefore we thought it was best to move on as any other outcome would have been unfair to him.\u201d Anthony was traded from the Oklahoma City Thunder to the Atlanta Hawks in July before the Hawks released him to clear the way for him to sign with the Rockets. Houston thought he could be the piece it needed to finally get past Golden State and win its first championship since back-to-back titles in 1994-95. Instead the Rockets limped out to a 6-7 start and the emergence of undrafted rookie Gary Clark made it appear that Anthony would have to take a reduced role. In the end the Rockets decided it would be better to move on than to force Anthony to do that. \u201cWe just had to see how things worked out,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said. \u201cAnd the way we play probably wasn\u2019t conducive to his game and he was trying to make the necessary sacrifices and it wasn\u2019t fair to him as a Hall of Fame player to play in a way that wasn\u2019t good for him, wasn\u2019t good for us. It just wasn\u2019t a fit.\u201d The 34-year-old Anthony is a 10-time All-Star who has had a tough time over the last two seasons. He averaged a career-low 16.2 points in 78 starts in a tumultuous season for the Thunder last season before coming to Houston \u2014 and accepting a reserve role for the first time in his 16-year career. Eight of Anthony\u2019s 10 appearances for the Rockets came off the bench after he had started all 1,054 games he\u2019d played in his first 15 NBA seasons. D\u2019Antoni said he feels for Anthony that things ended this way and made it clear that it wasn\u2019t a matter of Anthony not having the right attitude in Houston. \u201cIn the summer we tried to hit a home run and it didn\u2019t work out,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said. \u201cHe tried everything he could. He was great while he was here. It just didn\u2019t work out for whatever reason. I just thank him for his professionalism. It was good. He tried everything he could to make it work and it just didn\u2019t work out.\u201d The third overall pick in the 2003 draft has averaged 24 points, 6.5 rebounds and 3 assists in a career that also included stints with the Denver Nuggets and the New York Knicks. Anthony sat out Houston\u2019s last three games with what the team called an illness. His last appearance for Houston came in a blowout loss to Oklahoma City on Nov. 8 when he had two points and five rebounds. D\u2019Antoni expects the rest of the Rockets to handle this professionally, but knows that the move will be tough on them. \u201cI\u2019m sure they hate it,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said. \u201cThere\u2019s some good friends in there and there will be friendships. But above all this is a business.\u201d"},{"id":37397,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nba-promotes-new-referees","date":"2018-11-15","title":"NBA promotes five referees to 2018-19 officiating staff","content":"NEW YORK \u2014 NBA G League referees Mousa Dagher, Ashley Moyer-Gleich, Matt Myers, Phenizee Ransom and Natalie Sago have been promoted to full-time NBA staff officials, it was announced today by Monty McCutchen, NBA  Vice President, Head of Referee Development and Training .

We\u2019re moving forward,\u201d Green said at Thursday afternoon\u2019s shootaround. \u201cThere\u2019s no secret that I am an emotional player. I wear my emotions on my sleeve, I play with that same emotion. Sometimes they get the best of me and it doesn\u2019t work in my favor. I\u2019m going to live with that because it works in my favor to the good \u2014 as my resume speaks and this team\u2019s resume speaks \u2014 moreso than it doesn\u2019t. So, I\u2019m never going to change who I am. \u201cI\u2019ve read a lot about how \u2018is this the end of the run? Or \u2018Is it over?\u2019 Or \u2018did I force Kevin to leave?\u2019 \u2026 What you must know, nobody in this organization, from a player \u2014 not myself, not Kevin not anybody else \u2014 is going to beat us. If you\u2019re one of them 29 other teams in this league, you\u2019ve got to beat us. We\u2019re not going to beat us. We\u2019re going to continue to do what we do. I\u2019m sorry if that ruins everybody\u2019s stories.\u201d Green was suspended Tuesday for one game without pay for conduct detrimental to the team following an altercation a night earlier with Durant, though general manager Bob Myers declined to offer specifics on the All-Star forward\u2019s behavior that was considered going too far. Myers and coach Steve Kerr collaborated on the decision. Durant had not yet addressed the media Thursday, but he and Green were photographed on social media both entering shootaround together as well as shooting together on the same side of the court. In the closing seconds of regulation during Monday\u2019s 121-116 overtime loss on the road to the Clippers, Green secured a rebound and, with Durant calling for the ball, instead dribbled the length of the court into traffic and lost control as the Warriors failed to get a shot off. Durant was shown on camera visibly upset immediately afterward. Then, back on the bench waiting for the extra period to begin, the two traded words and gestured with Klay Thompson seated between them and Andre Iguodala, DeMarcus Cousins and others trying to calm the situation. Kerr said on Thursday he has faith that this disruption will not stop the Warriors from their bigger goals for the season. \u201cWe met in the locker room before practice and went through our usual gameday routine,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cWe addressed some things that will remain private. I know Kevin and Draymond have spoken. That\u2019s as much as I\u2019m going to reveal. I can tell you that I am extremely confident in this team\u2019s ability to get through any adversity. \u201cI know what this team is made of \u2026 I know the character of the group. I know the history of this group. It\u2019s way too strong and way too powerful to be upended by the type of adversity that may hit any team in the season.\u201d Green remained steadfast as well that this incident is not enough to shake the Warriors from their moorings. \u201cIf this only makes Kevin, myself and the rest of my teammates stronger, that\u2019s what it\u2019s going to do,\u201d Green said. \u201cYou think you saw something before, good luck with us now. We\u2019re not going to crumble off of an argument. We\u2019re going to move forward. That\u2019s all I\u2019ve got to say.\u201d For everyone who figures this franchise is perfect, Myers quickly cleared up that notion on Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to win a championship. You can\u2019t allow anything else in your locker room, in the narrative. This team has done a good job of that,\u201d Myers said Tuesday. \u201cI know it may appear as if it\u2019s looked easy over the last however many years. It\u2019s not. If you\u2019re in our locker room, if you\u2019re in our organization, it\u2019s hard. The Warriors made the announcement of Green\u2019s suspension four hours before they were set to host Atlanta, and the 28-year-old Green served the suspension against the Hawks. Golden State won that game 110-103 , but Green was not at the arena for it. Jonas Jerebko started in place of Green and had season bests of 14 points and 14 rebounds. After the game, Durant\u2019s first public comments were more cranky than conciliatory. While minimizing the incident \u2014 \u201c(Expletive) happens in the NBA,\u201d he said \u2014 Durant didn\u2019t exactly bend over backwards to extend any olive branches. \u201cWhat happened, happened,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t really think that matters at this point (whether he and Green are friendly).\u201d Myers and Kerr have long supported Green\u2019s fiery nature that leads to technical fouls. Myers even sat with Green next door to Oracle Arena at the Oakland Coliseum when Green was suspended for a crucial Game 5 loss to LeBron James and the Cavaliers in the 2016 NBA Finals. The Warriors wound up losing in seven. Green apologized after yelling at Kerr during halftime of a game at Oklahoma City in February 2016. \u201cMy feeling on Draymond and his impact on our team doesn\u2019t change. These things happen sometimes over the course of an NBA season,\u201d Kerr said Tuesday. \u201cWe deal with it \u2014 again, internally \u2014 so any conversations that are happening or have happened it\u2019s our business.\u201d This wasn\u2019t the first verbal altercation between Durant, the two-time reigning NBA Finals MVP, and Green. In another overtime loss, 109-106 at Sacramento on Feb. 4, 2017, they shouted at each other and argued near the bench. Kerr said he spoke to Green, who was part of the recruiting group that worked to sway Durant to the Bay Area from Oklahoma City before the 2016-17 season. Green has been off to a strong start this season for the two-time defending NBA champions, averaging 7.5 points, 7.8 rebounds and 7.4 assists.

James, 33, now sits directly behind Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, Karl Malone and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar on the NBA\u2019s all-time scoring list. James finished the game with a season-high 44 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists in the Lakers\u2019 126-117 win over the Portland Trail Blazers. His 44 points were the most a Laker has scored in a game since Kobe Bryant\u2019s 60-point performance in the final game of his career. The historic game ball and James\u2019 uniform will be donated to the I Promise School in Akron, LeBron announced after the game. After the game, James reflected on this history of the game, but wasn\u2019t about to reflect too much on what it meant to pass Chamberlain wearing a Lakers jersey. \u201cOne of the most dominant forces we ever had in our game along with Shaq,\u201d James said of Chamberlain. \u201cOne of the greatest Lakers ever to play the game.

Then we give it an overall grade on a scale of 1-5 Robert Horrys, named for the patron saint of last-second answered prayers. Reggie Bullock hit a running lay-up off an inbounds play as time expired and the Pistons rallied from a 19-point deficit to beat the Raptors 106-104 , making a winner out of coach Dwane Casey in his return to Toronto. DIFFICULTY: Casey called timeout with 2 seconds left and designed a play with Jose Calderon lobbing a pass to Glenn Robinson III near the basket. But Pascal Siakam swatted the shot out of bounds along the baseline. Detroit took the ball under the basket with 1.2 seconds left, and Calderon inbounded to a cutting Bullock, who calmly hit the five-foot fadeaway for the win. GAME SITUATION: Kawhi Leonard tied the game at 104 with a jumper with 38 seconds remaining. Blake Griffin missed a jumper at the other end and Kyle Lowry grabbed the rebound, giving Toronto 10 seconds to try a go-ahead shot. Leonard brought the ball up but lost it out of bounds. CELEBRATION: Bullock was mobbed by ecstatic teammates, while Casey raised his arms in triumph, pumped his fist, then ran onto the court to celebrate with his new team on the court he once called home. GRADE: Considering the comeback and the buzz surrounding Casey\u2019s return to Toronto, it was a signature win for the Pistons, who had lost six straight games to the Raptors. Revenge is a dish best served at the buzzer. Four Horrys .  LeBron passes Chamberlain  With 44 points in the Lakers\u2019 126-117 victory over the Blazers, LeBron James moved past Wilt Chamberlain to become the fifth-leading scorer in NBA history. Fittingly, James passed Chamberlain with an old-fashioned three-point play . He drove in and hit a floater with 3:55 left in the game and got fouled. The ensuing free throw was James\u2019 39th point of the night and the 31,420th of his career. James\u2019 44 points was the most by any Laker since Kobe Bryant scored 60 in the final game of his career. Ahead of James on the NBA\u2019s career scoring list are Michael Jordan (32,292), Kobe Bryant (33,643), Karl Malone (36,928) and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (38,387). Assuming James maintains his season scoring average (26.4 points) and doesn\u2019t miss more than a few games, he should pass Jordan before the All-Star break. Jimmy Butler had 14 points in his Philadelphia debut, but the 76ers surrendered a 16-point fourth-quarter lead and lost to the Magic 111-106 after Terrence Ross hit a tiebreaking 3-pointer with 8.7 seconds. Acquired Monday from Minnesota in a five-player trade, Butler played 33 minutes and shot 6-for-12 from the field. After the game, Butler talked about playing with new teammates, saying he has \u201cthe easy job:\u201d The four-time All-Star showed glimpses of why he was the headliner of the trade, but it was clear that it will take time to adjust to his new teammates. Butler generally deferred to his teammates on the court, especially to Joel Embiid, who posted his first career triple-double (19 points, 13 rebounds and 10 assists). \u2018Stache brothers reunion  The friendship between Steven Adams and Enes Kanter is a gift that keeps on giving. Known as the \u201c Stache Brothers \u201d during their time together in Oklahoma City, the former teammates had some fun with each other throughout the Thunder\u2019s 128-103 win over the Knicks. The shenanigans started as soon as Kanter subbed into the game midway through the first quarter. The highlights: \u2022 With Kanter at the free throw line, Adams yelled \u201cEnes! Enes! Enes! I know you can hear me!\u201d \u2022 After Kanter traveled, Adams ran up behind him and gave him a little shoulder and with a big smile on his face yelled in his ear, \u201cYou suck!\u201d \u2022 After posterizing Kanter from a pass out of a pick-and-roll by Dennis Schroder, Adams apparently told the Knicks to sub Kanter. Adams won this battle, but Kanter didn\u2019t seem to mind. The two teams meet again on Jan. 21 in New York. Raptors fans still have a special place in their heart for Dwane Casey. Casey was welcomed back to Toronto with a standing ovation during the Pistons\u2019 visit at Scotiabank Arena, their only trip to Toronto this season. Fans roared in approval when a video tribute was shown during the first timeout. Players from both benches also stood and applauded as Casey acknowledged the crowd with a wave. Casey won 320 games in seven seasons with the Raptors, more than any other coach in franchise history. He was selected NBA Coach of the Year after Toronto set a team record with 59 wins last season, but had been fired by the time he received the award. Casey was let go after the Raptors were swept in the second round of the playoffs by the Cavs. Stat of the night  Bradley Beal drilled his 900th career 3-pointer in the first quarter, and in doing so became the youngest player in NBA history to reach that mark, passing J.R.

(AP) \u2014 Jimmy Butler listens to country music, enjoys playing cards and drives a minivan. * Tonight on NBA League Pass:  76ers vs. Magic ( 7 ET ) Oh, the four-time All-Star forward loves to win. Butler was greeted by more than 250 employees of the Philadelphia 76ers at his introductory news conference at the team\u2019s practice facility Tuesday. He made it clear winning a championship is his main priority. \u201cI already got enough money to have me and my family set for the rest of my life. It\u2019s not about the money,\u201d said Butler, who can opt out of his contract and become a free agent at the end of the season. \u201cI have to love where I\u2019m at and have a great chance to win a championship.\u201d The Sixers believe adding Butler to a roster that includes Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons will allow them to compete for an NBA title. They won 52 games last season and advanced to the Eastern Conference semifinals after going 75-253 combined the previous four years. Robert Covington, Dario Saric and Jerryd Bayless were traded to Minnesota along with a 2022 second-round draft pick for Butler and Justin Patton. \u201cWith Joel, Ben and Jimmy, we have a strong, dynamic team,\u201d Sixers general manager Elton Brand said, pointing to a \u201cchampionship window.\u201d Butler is expected to make his debut with his new team on Wednesday in Orlando ( 7 ET, NBA League Pass ). Also, according to multiple sources, Butler will be starting. The 29-year-old Butler has averaged 21.8 points a game since the start of the 2014-15 season, the 13th-highest clip in the NBA over that span. The deal to Philadelphia ends a two-month saga that began when Butler told the Timberwolves shortly before training camp that he wanted to be moved. Critics, often citing anonymous sources, called Butler a disruptive presence on a team. Butler defended his reputation. \u201cYou really wouldn\u2019t know who I am unless you\u2019re around me every day,\u201d Butler said. \u201cFor the most part, that\u2019s why I don\u2019t worry too much about what everybody says. If you know me, if you\u2019re around me, you know my heart. You know how I go about what I go about. \u201cI love my teammates. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s too many of them that\u2019ll tell you that I\u2019m a bad teammate but people get whatever they want to say out. It is what it is, but I think that I\u2019m an incredible human being and teammate and I\u2019ll show that to the guys that are here.\u201d Brand said he spoke to several of Butler\u2019s former teammates and came away more than satisfied. \u201cIn the locker room, they loved him,\u201d Brand said. \u201cOn the court, he\u2019s demanding and he wants to win.\u201d Butler\u2019s hard-charging style of play will certainly fit well in Philadelphia. \u201cI\u2019m not the most talented guy. I\u2019m not the best shooter. I\u2019m not the fastest guy. I just work hard,\u201d Butler said. I take great pride in that. I love to work. I love to grind. It doesn\u2019t change now. I\u2019ll take it up a notch. I think the city will love that.\u201d Butler isn\u2019t concerned about not getting enough touches on offense with Embiid, Simmons, JJ Redick, Markelle Fultz and others on the Sixers. He handled the ball a lot in Minnesota but doesn\u2019t worry about fitting into coach Brett Brown\u2019s system. \u201cI\u2019m great at sharing the ball, moving without the ball,\u201d Butler said. \u201cIf I need the ball, I\u2019ll go steal it, go the other end and lay it up. Go get an offensive rebound. There\u2019s more than one way to get the ball. I think the way these guys play, sharing the ball, setting screens, slipping, all of that good stuff, I think that\u2019s actually easier than having to create all the time in iso situations and off the pick-and-roll.\u201d"},{"id":37389,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-76ers-jimmy-butler-addition","date":"2018-11-14","title":"Blogtable: With Butler aboard, what are the Sixers' title chances?","content":" * * * GM Elton Brand says the addition of Jimmy Butler can push the Sixers toward their goal of an NBA title. What say you? * * * Steve Aschburner : Toward is correct. To, not so much. Philadelphia is better with the addition of Butler. His pluses as a top two-way player and willing closer outweigh his minuses, mostly the trade-off in shooting range the Sixers made in the deal. (No worries here about Butler\u2019s impact on chemistry \u2014 he\u2019ll be on his best behavior now until he gets paid in the summer.) But the shooting need is real and so are concerns about Philly\u2019s depth. This deal tightens the grouping near the top of the East but IMO doesn\u2019t leapfrog the Sixers past either Boston or Toronto. Shaun Powell : Yes, he\u2019s right: This can push the Sixers toward that goal. Whether they actually reach it is a whole \u2018nother thing. The math says the Sixers have a Big 3, although none of the members have actually won anything. What\u2019s in their favor is Joel Embiid is having a Kia MVP-like year, Butler should feel rejuvenated with the new digs, and JJ Redick has played at a career high so far. But depth and inexperience could be their downfall at least this season. John Schuhmann : Yes, they\u2019re closer. Butler gives them more punch off the dribble, somebody they can give the ball to late in games. But the Sixers lost some depth, they still lack shooting, and we don\u2019t know how well the pieces, specifically Butler and Ben Simmons, are going to fit together. Right now, it\u2019s hard to favor Philly over the Raptors or Celtics when it comes to predicting the East representative in The Finals, but the playoffs are still five months away and a lot can change in that time. Brand will obviously keep shopping for some shooting. Sekou Smith : I understand the excitement of Elton Brand and all of the folks in Philadelphia who are fired up about the addition of Jimmy Butler. And they might all be right about Butler being the final, championship piece for the Sixers. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s happening this season. Even with a player as dynamic as Butler in the fold alongside Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons, I don\u2019t see the Sixers passing up the Toronto Raptors, Boston Celtics or the Milwaukee Bucks without seeing these new-look Sixers in action for at least a few weeks. You are asking Butler to do and be something he has not been previously in his career, and that\u2019s a championship-level superstar. He\u2019s got the talent and the drive to be that type of player. We know he believes himself to be that type of player. Now we\u2019ll see if he can play up to it."},{"id":37395,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-best-spot-carmelo-anthony","date":"2018-11-14","title":"Blogtable: What would be the best landing spot for Carmelo?","content":" * * * If the Rockets and Carmelo Anthony do part ways, where else could Anthony fit in? * * * Steve Aschburner : Indiana? The Pacers could use more firepower and it would give Anthony the opportunity to blend into and help a team that, more than most, gets serious mileage from its chemistry. But there\u2019s the rub \u2014 does Nate McMillan risk upsetting that for a player who hasn\u2019t demonstrated a willingness to defer to the greater good (other than in his admirable Olympic stints)? Maybe Gregg Popovich in San Antonio or Pat Riley in Miami decides to remind everyone that they can handle and deploy anybody, regardless of rep. Maybe LeBron gets him to the Lakers as another placeholder for when that team really steps it up next summer. Beyond those, it\u2019s hard for me to see a team signing off on the risk\/reward equation. Shaun Powell : My pick is Memphis. The Grizzlies have forever needed scoring on the wing, they play a slower tempo and they don\u2019t rely so much on the 3-pointer, which means Melo can return to shooting the mid-range jumper. They also can cover Melo on defense. John Schuhmann : This question would be easier to answer if we knew exactly why there\u2019s an issue in Houston. Yes, Anthony hasn\u2019t played very well, has the worst plus-minus on the team , and isn\u2019t as good as Trevor Ariza. But he\u2019s played in only 10 games and has been on the floor with Chris Paul and James Harden for just 37 minutes . It seems a tad early to judge this situation a complete failure. Michael Carter-Williams has been DNP\u2019d the last six games, and he\u2019s on the bench cheering on his teammates, accepting his status as the fifth guard on the depth chart. There\u2019s a huge Twitter crowd and maybe some media that blames Anthony for the Rockets\u2019 slow start, but so what? NBA players should be able to block that out and the Rockets\u2019 early issues clearly go beyond Anthony. So, is there an internal issue? Is Anthony unable to accept the possibility that he might get DNP\u2019d from time to time? It feels like we\u2019re missing a piece of the story, and until we find out what that missing piece is, how would we know if there\u2019s a better situation for him? Sekou Smith : There is no place Carmelo Anthony can go and outrun the narrative that has been chasing him for years now. Carmelo becomes an easy scapegoat in whatever situation he finds himself in next. It\u2019s not fair. It\u2019s not right for a future Hall of Famer of his ilk to suffer such a cruel fate in the twilight of his career. Yet here he is, facing yet another disastrous exit. There is no utopia out there for \u2018Melo, not in the sense that there is a place he\u2019d go and avoid the scrutiny and drama that has drained the life out of his past few seasons. I will tell you a place I\u2019d be fascinated to see him go to and see if he could he replenish his career, and that\u2019s down the road from Houston in San Antonio . I know it sounds crazy. And I know he\u2019s not necessarily the type of player you\u2019d ever expect to see in a Spurs uniform. I believe in the healing powers in that city and organization.

Who could be next? * * * Steve Aschburner : I\u2019d like to see Kyle Korver, with whom I spoke over the weekend about the possibility of a trade, get freed from the inevitable rebuild in Cleveland. He\u2019d be a great get for Philadelphia, for instance, if they could finagle the cap math. But since there\u2019s no urgency for the Cavs to make a deal, the time factor of \u201cnext\u201d in the question suggests a team in dire need of \u2026 doing something . That screams Washington to me. Yeah, I know, \u201ctwo in a row now,\u201d and potentially four straight victories by the end of the week. But climbing to 6-9 isn\u2019t reassuring with their schedule from there (Blazers and Clippers, then seven of 10 on the road). So add me to the chorus speculating about a deal involving John Wall , super-max contract and all. Shaun Powell : Does Carmelo Anthony still count as a big name? Because he\u2019s certainly next. But in the spirit of the question, let\u2019s go with Kent Bazemore of the Hawks , who could look to move a big contract. Kyle Korver\u2019s another candidate. Also, if the Wizards keep going south, there could be a midseason shakeup and it wouldn\u2019t shock me if they move John Wall, who\u2019s set to make $40 million-plus per season on his super max which is ready to kick in. John Schuhmann : If the Wizards don\u2019t turn things around, we should start there. Trading John Wall\u2019s contract would be difficult, but there are a couple of teams out there desperate for a point guard. Bradley Beal is clearly the most tradeable of their three highest paid players, but also the one they\u2019d most like to keep, I would imagine. With Otto Porter not living up to his deal, he\u2019d be a tough sell. Elsewhere, we should expect the Cavs to trade at least a couple of their vets. J.R. Smith and Kyle Korver aren\u2019t huge names, but I wonder if the Rockets, now that Butler is off the table, would call Cleveland about a Kevin Love deal. They\u2019d only owe Love, James Harden, Chris Paul and Clint Capela a total of $592 million through the 2022-23 season. Sekou Smith : Jimmy Butler did such a great job telegraphing his eventual move that it makes picking the next \u201cbig name\u201d to be moved much harder to figure right now. There isn\u2019t another disgruntled All-Star that immediately comes to mind. For a half second I thought about Draymond Green and his situation with the Golden State Warriors and what could happen if \u2026 ah, never mind that foolishness. The Warriors aren\u2019t dealing their emotional leader just because he and Kevin Durant get in a little dust-up. The Washington Wizards have won two straight with a chance to make it three straight with Cleveland in town Wednesday night. But if the wheels fall off again before the trade deadline, might the Wizards consider moving Bradley Beal? It\u2019s worth thinking about, if we\u2019re just speculating about things that could happen."},{"id":37461,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/wolves-glen-taylor-butler-trade-thoughts","date":"2018-11-14","title":"Wolves owner Taylor: Butler 'had an agenda' team had to work around","content":" Timberwolves owner Glen Taylor no longer has the Jimmy Butler trade issue to deal with after Minnesota officially dealt him to the Philadelphia 76ers days ago. Throughout the Butler trade saga, Taylor kept up with comments from his players in the media and a watchful eye on how his team was faring with Butler around. Taylor and Butler reportedly came to an agreement early on in the trade chatter that came down to the Wolves continuing to look for trades for Butler while Butler played up to his usual standards. A 4-9 start for Minnesota, however, made it clear the team and Butler needed to move on from each other. In an interview with Chris Hine of Minneapolis Star-Tribune , Taylor said that although the Wolves vowed to not let Butler\u2019s situation affect their play, it clearly did to him. \u201cIt just appeared that they weren\u2019t working together as a team or as a unit the way that they should\u2019ve. I can\u2019t exactly answer why,\u201d Taylor told the newspaper. \u201cThe only thing that was different that we had was Jimmy\u2019s position of leaving the team. Maybe that was affecting guys more than they even knew themselves.\u201d He said the Wolves\u2019 0-5 start on the road didn\u2019t lead to Butler\u2019s trade, but that the trade might have happened around when it did anyway because of an agreement he, the coaching staff and Butler had to play at least 10 games. After that, they would evaluate where the Wolves were as well as gauge the temperature league-wide relative to making a trade for Butler. \u201cWe have to play at least 10 games and then we would see which teams were meeting their goals, which teams weren\u2019t and the teams that weren\u2019t we thought we would have a better chance to negotiate,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cWe were preparing ourselves to do this anyway. But certainly, I guess if we would\u2019ve won all five games out there, it might have been different. \u201cI don\u2019t think it was all under our control. I wish it would\u2019ve been more under our control, but I think we saw Jimmy had an agenda and we had to work around that.\u201d Taylor said he saw issues in the fourth quarter of games for the Wolves and felt the situation was potentially weighing on younger players like Karl-Anthony Towns and Andrew Wiggins. He felt the Wolves\u2019 youngsters were \u201cpositive to Jimmy\u201d and in working hard, but saw issues late in games. \u201cThe only thing I can relate back is they probably were under pressure they didn\u2019t realize as young people. \u2026 It\u2019s a negative environment,\u201d Taylor told the newspaper. After landing Robert Covington, Dario Saric and Jerryd Bayless and a 2022 second-round draft from the Sixers, the Wolves have the kind of immediate roster help coach and team president Tom Thibodeau sought in potential Butler deals. Still, Taylor wouldn\u2019t say how the trade would affect Thibodeau\u2019s job status going forward. \u201cHe\u2019ll be evaluated on how we go forward.\u201d Taylor told the Star-Tribune . \u201cThe truth is, we dug ourselves a little bit of a hole, so it\u2019s going to be harder than it would be if it was a true start of a season. We\u2019re just going to have to make that up. That\u2019s how I\u2019m going to do it. \u201cSaying, \u2018OK, you now have your team. We made the trades. These are guys that you like and let\u2019s see what we can do.\u2019 Now, I think we all know that it\u2019s a little difficult.

Was Draymond Green\u2019s sideline eruption Monday in Los Angeles merely the latest in his periodic series of blowups, or a symptom of deeper issues plaguing the seemingly impervious Warriors? What we know for sure: The Warriors certainly didn\u2019t take the ugly incident lightly, suspending the combustible All-Star one game without pay. That amounts to peanuts for a player slated to make more than $17 million this season. But the larger statement speaks volumes. Even for a team accustomed to Green\u2019s volatility, the sight of him angrily cursing out teammate Kevin Durant on the bench was a bridge too far.

Warriors general manager Bob Myers described the seven-year veteran as \u201cprofessional\u201d when told of the suspension before Tuesday\u2019s 110-103 victory over the Hawks. And coach Steve Kerr is no stranger to internecine strife. Not only has he managed Green for five seasons, he played alongside \u2014 and memorably fought with \u2014 the notoriously demanding Michael Jordan, as well as one-man sideshow Dennis Rodman, with the Bulls. In Kerr\u2019s telling, his skirmish with Jordan actually brought the two together. It surely helped that Jordan called within hours of their fight. According to Myers, that had yet to happen between Durant and Green as Tuesday\u2019s game tipped off. But neither he nor Kerr expect Monday\u2019s blowup or the ensuing suspension to significantly impede the Warriors in their quest to win a third straight championship. \u201cI know it may appear as if it\u2019s looked easy over the last however many years; it\u2019s not,\u201d Myers said. \u201cAnd so they\u2019ll get through it, and we\u2019ll keep moving. Hopefully we get to The Finals and win a championship. That\u2019s all anybody\u2019s thinking about, because I think that\u2019s all you can think about.\u201d \u201cI think we\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cDraymond is always going to be who he is. He\u2019s a powerful force. He\u2019s a huge reason why we\u2019ve had so much success here.\u201d Others, however, aren\u2019t so sure. Various observers described Myers and Kerr as being visibly shaken over the incident during their media availability. Some wondered if Green\u2019s anger stemmed less from Monday\u2019s game than lingering resentment over Durant\u2019s refusal to commit to the Warriors long term. Durant\u2019s first public comments were more cranky than conciliatory. While minimizing the incident \u2014 \u201c(Expletive) happens in the NBA,\u201d he said \u2014 Durant didn\u2019t exactly bend over backwards to extend any olive branches. \u201cWhat happened, happened,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t really think that matters at this point (whether he and Green are friendly).\u201d If you want to get really deep in the weeds, enterprising lip readers found footage of Durant seemingly muttering \u201cthis is why I\u2019m out\u201d under his breath while heading back on the court Monday \u2014 a possible allusion to his impending free-agent decision. Will Durant stay, or will he go? Will Green\u2019s temperament sink the Warriors again? With DeMarcus Cousins nearing his return to give them an unprecedented fifth active All-Star, are they simply too good for any of it to matter? \u201cWho knows?\u201d Durant said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d Two games do not a turnaround make. But the Rockets are finally starting to look like their old selves with another solid offensive performance in Tuesday\u2019s 109-99 road victory over the Nuggets. Two days after shelling the Pacers with 20 3-pointers, the Rockets shot 54.9 percent from the floor to pull within a game of .500 at 6-7. That\u2019s still light years from where they expect to be. But after a miserable 1-5 start compounded by the Carmelo Anthony saga , the Rockets will surely take any lifeline they can get. \u201dIt\u2019s going to take time, but we\u2019re getting there,\u201d said James Harden, who racked up 22 points and 11 assists. \u201cIf we keep guarding and defending at a high level our offense will come around. Once we put both together, it\u2019s going to get scary.\u201d The Cavaliers entered Tuesday\u2019s action with the worst defensive rating in the entire NBA at 114.4 points allowed per 100 possessions. Not only that, they were down five rotation players. So of course they promptly locked up the Hornets , limiting the NBA\u2019s fourth-best offensive team to 89 points on 34.7-percent shooting. Adjusted for pace, Charlotte\u2019s rate of 91.8 points per 100 possessions for the game was nearly 23 below its usual production. The Cavs did an especially impressive job on Kemba Walker. The league\u2019s third-leading scorer coming in at 27.9 points per game, he managed a paltry seven while missing 14 of 16 shots.

(AP) \u2014 The Golden State Warriors don\u2019t expect Draymond Green\u2019s latest dustup with Kevin Durant to become a long-term issue for the two-time defending NBA champions. Nor do they expect the emotional Green to change after his one-game suspension by the team Tuesday. Green was suspended one game without pay for conduct detrimental to the team following an altercation a night earlier with Durant, though general manager Bob Myers declined to offer specifics on the All-Star forward\u2019s behavior that was considered going too far. Myers and Steve Kerr collaborated on the decision. \u201cWe just felt like this rose to the level of acting the way we did,\u201d Myers said, noting of Green: \u201cHe was professional. He loves to play basketball, which is all you can ask of him.\u201d The Warriors made the announcement about four hours before they were set to host Atlanta, and the 28-year-old Green was serving the suspension against the Hawks. He wasn\u2019t at Oracle Arena and didn\u2019t immediately respond to a text message seeking comment. \u201cI think we\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cWe\u2019re a team that goes through stuff, just like everybody else. And things happen, bumps in the road. You\u2019ve got to move forward. It\u2019s all part of coaching a team, it\u2019s all part of being on a team. You have to get through the adversity and there are some difficult times and you just get through them.\u201d In the closing seconds of regulation during Monday\u2019s 121-116 overtime loss on the road to the Clippers, Green secured a rebound and, with Durant calling for the ball, instead dribbled the length of the court into traffic and lost control as the Warriors failed to get a shot off. Durant was shown on camera visibly upset immediately afterward. Then, back on the bench waiting for the extra period to begin, the two traded words and gestured with Klay Thompson seated between them and Andre Iguodala, DeMarcus Cousins and others trying to calm the situation. For everyone who figures this franchise is perfect, Myers quickly cleared up that notion. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to win a championship. You can\u2019t allow anything else in your locker room, in the narrative. This team has done a good job of that,\u201d Myers said. \u201cI know it may appear as if it\u2019s looked easy over the last however many years. It\u2019s not. If you\u2019re in our locker room, if you\u2019re in our organization, it\u2019s hard. \u201cAnd so they\u2019ll get through it, and we\u2019ll keep moving. Hopefully we get to the finals and win a championship. That\u2019s all anybody\u2019s thinking about, because I think that\u2019s all you can think about. That\u2019s something that we\u2019re going to keep doing. This team has proven that they will do that and continue to do that and have done that.\u201d Myers and Kerr have long supported Green\u2019s fiery nature that leads to technical fouls. Myers even sat with Green next door to Oracle Arena at the Oakland Coliseum when Green was suspended for a crucial Game 5 loss to LeBron James and the Cavaliers in the 2016 NBA Finals. The Warriors wound up losing in seven. Green apologized after yelling at Kerr during halftime of a game at Oklahoma City in February 2016. \u201cMy feeling on Draymond and his impact on our team doesn\u2019t change. These things happen sometimes over the course of an NBA season,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cWe deal with it \u2014 again, internally \u2014 so any conversations that are happening or have happened it\u2019s our business.\u201d This wasn\u2019t the first verbal altercation between Durant, the two-time reigning NBA Finals MVP, and Green. In another overtime loss, 109-106 at Sacramento on Feb. 4, 2017, they shouted at each other and argued near the bench. \u201cHow you handle things after they happen is the most important thing,\u201d Myers said. Kerr said he spoke to Green, who was part of the recruiting group that worked to sway Durant to the Bay Area from Oklahoma City before the 2016-17 season. \u201cThey\u2019ve won championships together, they\u2019ve been teammates, now this is the third season, they were teammates on the Olympic team,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cDraw your own conclusions.\u201d Green has been off to a strong start this season for the two-time defending NBA champions, averaging 7.5 points, 7.8 rebounds and 7.4 assists. Kerr has credited him for taking great care of the ball and establishing a tempo on both ends of the floor. The game at Los Angeles marked Green\u2019s return from a two-game absence with a sprained right foot and toe. \u201cDraymond is always going to be who he is. He\u2019s a powerful force,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cHe\u2019s a huge reason why we\u2019ve had so much success here.\u201d"},{"id":37462,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/raptors-anticipate-emotional-reunion-casey","date":"2018-11-14","title":"Raptors anticipate emotional reunion with former head coach","content":" * Tonight on NBA League Pass: Pistons vs. Raptors (7:30 ET) TORONTO (AP) \u2014 Kyle Lowry and Jonas Valanciunas spent a dozen years between them developing their games under coach Dwane Casey. Valanciunas had never played for any other NBA head coach before this season. When they welcome Casey and his Detroit Pistons back to Toronto on Wednesday night, the two longest-serving current Raptors know emotions will be running high. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be different, but hey, I\u2019m still going to try to take his head off, the team\u2019s head off,\u201d Lowry said with a laugh. The Raptors will face Detroit for the first time since Casey was fired, just days after Toronto was ousted from the playoffs by Cleveland for the third consecutive season. Lowry became a four-time NBA All-Star under Casey\u2019s watch, while Valanciunas has grown into a multiskilled big man. Casey had kind words for both Raptors on the eve of his visit. Lowry got off to a rocky start with Casey when the Raptors acquired the temperamental guard in 2012, but he and Valanciunas returned the compliment. \u201c(Our relationship) changed a lot,\u201d Lowry said. \u201cIt went from a guy who kind of wasn\u2019t trusting in what I did, and me not trusting in what he wanted, and kind of us battling back and forth, to him being like, \u2018Hey listen, I believe in what you can do, you show me what you can do,\u2019 and me saying \u2018All right, if you show me that and I\u2019ve showed you what I can do, I\u2019ll listen to you more and we\u2019ll have a good relationship.\u2019 \u201cIt turned into a great coach-player relationship. And him having young kids, and me having \u2026 they played soccer together, so we created a bond off the court also.\u201d Nick Nurse, who was promoted to head coach after Casey\u2019s dismissal, insisted he was looking forward to seeing his former boss despite rumors the two were not close. \u201cMy communication with whoever is between me and whoever I\u2019m communicating with, whether it\u2019s between Kyle and me and Kawhi (Leonard) and me or Case and me \u2026 or whoever,\u201d Nurse told The Canadian Press. \u201cI\u2019ll keep that to myself. I am looking forward to seeing him.\u201d Nurse characterized his relationship with Casey as \u201cgood.\u201d \u201cWe have five years together and a lot of success. A lot of battles and a lot of long hours together, working hard,\u201d Nurse said. \u201cHe took a team from relative obscurity or the hinterlands to relevance, and that may be the hardest thing to do in this league. I\u2019m glad I was a part of it for five years. We had a lot of success and I learned a lot from the guy and have a lot of respect for the guy.\u201d The 51-year-old Nurse said the biggest lesson learned under Casey was professionalism and diligence. \u201cThe seriousness of the day-to-day, the grind and probably most importantly is the work ethic,\u201d Nurse said. \u201cHe used to say it to us a lot. He\u2019d put his work ethic up against anybody in the league and he was right in that. The guy always had our staff prepared and our players prepared; he taught me all those things.\u201d After leading Toronto to a team-record 59 wins and the top seed in the East last season, Casey was also named the NBA\u2019s Coach of the Year \u2014 after his firing. The Raptors have a video tribute planned for the 61-year-old Casey early in the game. \u201cHe did some really good things for the city, for the team. I think everybody respects him,\u201d Valanciunas said. \u201c(But) as a business we\u2019ve got to move on and he (ended) up pretty well, so that is life.

(AP) \u2014 Jimmy Butler listens to country music, enjoys playing cards and drives a minivan. Oh, the four-time All-Star forward loves to win. Butler was greeted by more than 250 employees of the Philadelphia 76ers at his introductory news conference at the team\u2019s practice facility Tuesday. He made it clear winning a championship is his main priority. \u201cI already got enough money to have me and my family set for the rest of my life. It\u2019s not about the money,\u201d said Butler, who can opt out of his contract and become a free agent at the end of the season. \u201cI have to love where I\u2019m at and have a great chance to win a championship.\u201d The Sixers believe adding Butler to a roster that includes Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons will allow them to compete for an NBA title. They won 52 games last season and advanced to the Eastern Conference semifinals after going 75-253 combined the previous four years. Robert Covington, Dario Saric and Jerryd Bayless were traded to Minnesota along with a 2022 second-round draft pick for Butler and Justin Patton. \u201cWith Joel, Ben and Jimmy, we have a strong, dynamic team,\u201d Sixers general manager Elton Brand said, pointing to a \u201cchampionship window.\u201d Butler is expected to make his debut with his new team on Wednesday in Orlando ( 7 ET, NBA League Pass ). The 29-year-old Butler has averaged 21.8 points a game since the start of the 2014-15 season, the 13th-highest clip in the NBA over that span. The deal to Philadelphia ends a two-month saga that began when Butler told the Timberwolves shortly before training camp that he wanted to be moved. Critics, often citing anonymous sources, called Butler a disruptive presence on a team. Butler defended his reputation. \u201cYou really wouldn\u2019t know who I am unless you\u2019re around me every day,\u201d Butler said. \u201cFor the most part, that\u2019s why I don\u2019t worry too much about what everybody says. If you know me, if you\u2019re around me, you know my heart. You know how I go about what I go about. \u201cI love my teammates. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s too many of them that\u2019ll tell you that I\u2019m a bad teammate but people get whatever they want to say out. It is what it is, but I think that I\u2019m an incredible human being and teammate and I\u2019ll show that to the guys that are here.\u201d Brand said he spoke to several of Butler\u2019s former teammates and came away more than satisfied. \u201cIn the locker room, they loved him,\u201d Brand said. \u201cOn the court, he\u2019s demanding and he wants to win.\u201d Butler\u2019s hard-charging style of play will certainly fit well in Philadelphia. \u201cI\u2019m not the most talented guy. I\u2019m not the best shooter. I\u2019m not the fastest guy. I just work hard,\u201d Butler said. I take great pride in that. I love to work. I love to grind. It doesn\u2019t change now. I\u2019ll take it up a notch. I think the city will love that.\u201d Butler isn\u2019t concerned about not getting enough touches on offense with Embiid, Simmons, JJ Redick, Markelle Fultz and others on the Sixers. He handled the ball a lot in Minnesota but doesn\u2019t worry about fitting into coach Brett Brown\u2019s system. \u201cI\u2019m great at sharing the ball, moving without the ball,\u201d Butler said. \u201cIf I need the ball, I\u2019ll go steal it, go the other end and lay it up. Go get an offensive rebound. There\u2019s more than one way to get the ball. I think the way these guys play, sharing the ball, setting screens, slipping, all of that good stuff, I think that\u2019s actually easier than having to create all the time in iso situations and off the pick-and-roll.\u201d"},{"id":37463,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/tom-thibodeau-explains-butler-trade","date":"2018-11-13","title":"Thibodeau says he sought immediate roster help in Butler trade","content":" The Minnesota Timberwolves have moved on from the Jimmy Butler era, having officially completed their trade of the All-Star swingman to the Philadelphia 76ers on Monday .

You aren\u2019t the only one Joel Embiid enjoys tormenting. The 76ers All-Star took his latest wrecking ball to the Heat\u2019s Hassan Whiteside on Monday with 35 points and 18 rebounds as the 76ers triumphed 124-114 . Per usual, he took great delight in his opponent\u2019s misery. It marked Embiid\u2019s 14th double-double in 15 games, the best start to an NBA season by a Philadelphia player since Moses Malone went 57 for 58 in 1982-83. (Editorial aside: Holy wow.) It was also the first 35-18 game by a Sixer since Charles Barkley in December of 1990. The outburst pushed Embiid\u2019s season averages up to a robust 28.2 points and 13.4 rebounds per game, good enough for second and sixth in the NBA, respectively. In terms of raw totals, Embiid sits at 423 points and 201 rebounds through 15 games. He is the first player to hit those totals since Shaquille O\u2019Neal in 1999-2000, and only the fourth since the NBA-ABA merger in 1967-77. (Malone, in 1980-81, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, in 1976-77, are the others.) Put all that together, and we could be looking at the very early stages of a legitimate Kia MVP run from Embiid, especially if the addition of Jimmy Butler can elevate the 76ers among the NBA\u2019s elite teams. \u201dI will admit,\u201d 76ers coach Brett Brown said, \u201dwhen I come back and I see the stat sheet, I\u2019m shocked at how dominating at times he is.\u201d Embiid wasn\u2019t the only center to dominate on Monday. Timberwolves big man Karl-Anthony Towns overpowered the Nets for 25 points and 21 rebounds in his first game since news broke that Butler had finally been traded. (And also 10 turnovers, but hey, nobody\u2019s perfect.) It followed a monster 39-point, 19-rebound outing against the Kings on Friday. That brought his two-game totals to 64 points and 40 rebounds \u2014 thresholds reached previously over that span by only Anthony Davis and Zach Randolph over the past 20 years. Michael Jordan gave us \u201cThe Shrug.\u201d  Dikembe Mutombo had \u201cThe Wag.\u201d  Monday brought us another seminal moment in NBA history: Headband Joe. Whatever cute nickname you like, it came courtesy of Australian sharpshooter Joe Ingles late in Utah\u2019s 96-88 road victory over the Grizzlies. Per Deseret News reporter Eric Woodyard, Ingles was forced to the bench late in the fourth quarter with blood \u201cdripping\u201d down his face from a cut over his eye. (This led to a fun entry in the official play-by-play : Stoppage, Blood Rule.) Head bandaged, looking more like a combat casualty than an NBA player, Ingles not only remained in the game but served up an alley-oop for Rudy Gobert before drilling a dagger 3-pointer with 45.4 seconds left. Full credit to the Jazz social media crew, which was quick to capitalize on Ingles\u2019 pluck: The tears welling in Rondae Hollis-Jefferson\u2019s eyes pretty much said it all in regards to the horrific leg injury suffered by Nets guard Caris LeVert in Minneapolis. Not only did it interrupt one of the NBA\u2019s better young careers, it will sideline a player the Nets obviously like just as much off the court, if not more, than they do on it. And given the fact he was averaging 19 points per game, they like him a lot . As reported by ESPN , Nets coach Kenny Atkinson called LeVert \u201cthe heart and soul of our program.\u201d \u201cI just know that if anybody is coming back from this \u2014 the human, the character, the person, the player \u2014 he\u2019ll come back from this,\u201d Atkinson said. \u201cBut a tough, tough blow for the Nets. Our only thoughts are with him. Nothing else matters. The game doesn\u2019t matter tonight.\u201d Added teammate Joe Harris: \u201cThere was really just no words. We didn\u2019t talk even when we came in at halftime. There was nothing to be said. Guys were crying. It was really that horrific just to see.\u201d Amazingly, and not in a good way, it marks the third such gruesome injury Derrick Rose has witnessed in person, having previously been on the court when Paul George and Gordon Hayward were hurt in similar fashion. \u201cIt\u2019s always terrible to see something like that,\u201d Rose said. \u201cIt kind of messes you up in a way.\u201d There\u2019s always going to be a certain amount of tension around the Warriors thanks to Draymond Green\u2019s white-hot competitive fire. And sometimes that tension will erupt into open conflict. Such was the case at Staples Center, where Kevin Durant was left fuming after Green made the ill-advised decision to keep the ball following a critical stop and the score tied in the final seconds of regulation. Despite Durant\u2019s pleading, Green dribbled the length of the court for a would-be last shot\u2026 and promptly lost control of the ball as time expired. That led to an angry exchange on the bench before Durant fouled out in OT \u2014 he finished with 33 points to Green\u2019s six \u2014 and the Warriors wilted late in a 121-116 defeat . https:\/\/twitter.com\/ClippsMcGee\/status\/1062242258940874753 Warriors coach Steve Kerr took the blame for Green\u2019s miscue, saying he should have called timeout. And Shaun Livingston chalked up the disagreement to competitive spirit. But Durant was apparently still upset enough that he left the locker room without speaking to reporters. Almost a week after he picked a verbal squabble with John Wall over the Wizards All-Star\u2019s perceived lack of dedication , ESPN pundit Stephen A. Smith was reportedly front and center in D.C. for Monday\u2019s game with the Magic. While he denied that Smith\u2019s presence motivated him \u2014 specific quote: \u201cNah\u201d \u2014 Wall\u2019s teammates weren\u2019t so sure after he piled up 25 points and 10 assists to lead the Wizards past the Magic , 117-109. \u201cY\u2019all pissed him off, man,\u201d said Bradley Beal, lumping the entire media in with Smith. \u201cIt\u2019s y\u2019all\u2019s fault. I\u2019m happy you guys lit a little flame up under him. He got us all going.\u201d Not that much gloating is in order.

Not for the points as much as to avoid embarrassment. \u201cAt times,\u201d Jordan said Monday of what understandably became an aversion to shooting free throws, \u201cI would try to make sure I made the [basket for an] \u2018and-one\u2019 so I would only have to shoot one free throw.\u201d The fewer the better for a player who shot a miserable 44.6 percent from the line over his first 10 seasons. Now, though, Jordan is cavorting through the league with the swagger of converting at 81.3 percent. That represents an 83 percent increase in his accuracy, this year over career. It\u2019s more of a breakthrough than an improvement, the sort of new trick old dogs aren\u2019t supposed to learn. But there it is: 39 of 48, Dallas\u2019 team leader in free throw percentage . \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of going there,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cYeah, I don\u2019t shy away from the line anymore.\u201d Nor should he. Jordan, through the Mavericks\u2019 first 13 games, looks to be cancelling his membership in the exclusive NBA club of elite big men who have struggled at the line. From Wilt Chamberlain in the 1960s and \u201870s to Shaquille O\u2019Neal, Tim Duncan and Dwight Howard, some of the most physically imposing players in league annals have been bedeviled when everything is still, no one is guarding them and the rim is staring back from 15 feet away. Generally, those giant talents were consistent in their misfires. O\u2019Neal, for instance, shot 52.7 percent from the line in his career and never better in a single season than 62.2. For Howard, the respective numbers are 56.6 and 67.1 . That level of reliable unreliability was what emboldened rival coaches to deploy their \u201chack-a-(take your pick),\u201d catch-up strategies, grinding games to a halt by intentionally sending deficient bigs to the line. Jordan\u2019s leap from 44.6 for his career to 81.3 in 2018-19 belongs to a special category. Not just mathematically but historically. \u201cA lot of people would never have believed it would be possible for him to make this kind of turnaround,\u201d Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the most amazing things I\u2019ve seen in the NBA in my 34 years.\u201d Said Chicago Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg: \u201cWe\u2019ve used that strategy in the past, but the way he\u2019s shooting the ball, he\u2019s one of the better free-throw shooters. It looks pretty good leaving his hand right now.\u201d Given how well Jordan has shot them this season, his 0-for-2 night against the Bulls Monday qualified as man-bites-dog news. And Dallas assistant Jamahl Mosley was quick to defend his team\u2019s center, saying he saw no backslide at all in Jordan\u2019s form. Mosley should know. He\u2019s the coach who spend the most time with Jordan in and after practices, and before games, grooving his lefthanded free-throw stroke through repetition and drills. Carlisle had a few suggestions for Jordan\u2019s mechanics over the summer and Dallas has a new shooting coach in Peter Patton. But interestingly, it\u2019s the club\u2019s defensive coordinator who has polished and sharpened this particular offensive threat.  Mosley, who worked with Denver and Cleveland before landing with the Mavs in 2014, had known Jordan for years. So when the free agent signed a one-year, $22.9 million deal in July, Mosley was the one who took him on as a pet project. \u201cThe way his form is, the way he shoots it, the way he structures it, the way Rick has talked to him about some things, I think it\u2019s the process of it,\u201d Mosley said. \u201cIt\u2019s literally focusing on that every single step. \u201cWe keep reiterating what we know he is: He\u2019s a good free throw shooter. In his mind and my mind and [Carlisle\u2019s] mind, he\u2019s a good free throw shooter. The more you reiterate that, the better vs. the other [negative] side of it.\u201d When the Mavericks\u2019 shootaround opened to the media Monday morning at United Center, Jordan was at the foul line on the arena\u2019s east end. He drained five in a row. Then he worked his way to the west end, waiting momentarily as backup center Salah Mejri \u2013 who made 58.4 percent (101 of 173) in his first three seasons but has yet to shoot a free throw this season \u2013 finished up. Jordan gave Mejri a smack on the rump as encouragement, then took his place. One make, one miss, one make \u2026 and then, as if synchronized to Jordan\u2019s fourth shot, a flurry of a half-dozen basketballs from various shooters crashed down on the rim at once, each blocking the next. Jordan looked peeved, holding his arms out in a \u201cWhat the (expletive)\u201d gesture. A maestro whose work was interrupted. He sank his next four. \u201cHe\u2019s always had a good touch,\u201d Mavs forward Dirk Nowitzki said. \u201cIt was never completely broke. I don\u2019t know, a lot of this league is confidence. I don\u2019t see anything different. He still keeps the ball really high. Now he\u2019s putting it all together. Maybe a change of scenery?\u201d Jordan is delighted to be in Dallas \u2014 three years after he accepted, waffled and bailed on the Mavericks in a free-agency dry run . And the Mavs feel the same about him. \u201cHe\u2019s a charismatic guy who\u2019s doing everything possible to try to bring our team together,\u201d Carlisle said. Jordan\u2019s presence in the paint and at the rim has cleaned up problems for Dallas near the basket. He is averaging 13.7 rebounds, while Dallas ranks fourth both in defensive rebound percentage (75.4) and fewest paint-points allowed (43.8). That makes his foul shooting a happy bonus. \u201cA lot of it\u2019s muscle memory,\u201d Jordan explained at the morning shootaround. Frequently, he as tried to avoid the topic in interviews, lest he jinx the work he\u2019s done or stop doing it. But he shared a bit Monday. \u201cI got a lot of reps up this summer,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve got a routine that I love and that I\u2019m comfortable with. But I also think it\u2019s mental because a guy can come out here and shoot 85, 90 percent in practice. But then in a game, it\u2019s a different situation, different pressure. To shoot that way, it confuses people.\u201d That\u2019s the legend of O\u2019Neal, who was said to excel from the line in an empty practice gym, then sputter when he the smelled popcorn on game night. \u201cRight. It\u2019s a different energy, man,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cIt\u2019s pressure \u2014 we all love that pressure, but it is a little pressure. It\u2019s fatigue. It\u2019s 20,000 people in the stands, too. So I think it\u2019s more so mental. You get into your own head about it.\u201d Jordan took a moment to defend the Diesel, by the way. \u201cShaq made \u2018em in clutch moments,\u201d he said. \u201cI guess, in clutch moments, your mind kind of locks back in and you fall back into your mechanics and the basics. But I know I got a lot of reps in this summer.\u201d  Curiously, Jordan\u2019s field-goal proficiency is at the other end of the spectrum. By virtue of ranking among the NBA\u2019s top three in dunks in each of the past eight seasons, his 67.2 career shooting percentage is the best in NBA history. (He led the league for five straight seasons, including three in a row above 70 percent.) Throwing down dunks, though, is different from draining free throws. Jordan seems to have his feet better aligned at the line, his left toe a few inches ahead of his right. He makes sure to release the ball high and drills for that in warm-ups, launching it almost straight up and only a few feet in front of him, just to focus on his arc. There\u2019s a little trigger mechanism he\u2019s been using, too, verbally checking his rebounders along the lane. Then he dribbles twice and only twice, before firing. \u201cWhere his percentage is right now, I think that\u2019s what he is,\u201d Mosley said. Then who was that guy from even one year ago? \u201cThat was more a case of looking at not the process but the end result,\u201d Mosley said. \u201cWhen you start to focus on the end result, good, bad or indifferent, you can start thinking, \u2018Oh, if I miss\u2026\u2019 Or \u2018If I make\u2026\u2019 versus doing the exact same thing, every single time.\u201d For Jordan \u2013 a one-time All-Star, two-time all-defense selection and three-time all-NBA pick at center \u2013 there\u2019s a new satisfaction to seeing the looks he gets now from opponents lined along the lane. \u201cHey, what\u2019s going on?\u201d more than a few have said to him, as his free throws swished. \u201cEverything takes time,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cWhich I\u2019m fine with. It\u2019s something where you never want to be content with or be complacent, you always want to get better.\u201d This hasn\u2019t been incremental, though, a mild dialing-up. This has been a bust-out. \u201cThat\u2019s the nature of the beast,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cYou want a breakthrough, but then you want to keep going. We\u2019re never satisfied with where we are as players.\u201d Hard to argue, since Jordan never has quite been here before. Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Butler and Justin Patton were traded for Philadelphia, in exchange for Robert Covington, Dario Saric and Jerryd Bayless along with a 2022 second-round draft pick. Butler will be introduced by the 76ers on Tuesday and is expected to debut with his new club Wednesday at Orlando. Philadelphia is playing at Miami on Monday. The deal gives Philadelphia a legitimate \u201cBig Three\u201d with Butler joining All-Star forward Joel Embiid and reigning rookie of the year Ben Simmons on a team that already was expected to be a major Eastern Conference contender this season. \u201cWe have a championship window that\u2019s centered around the continued progression of our talented young core, as well as our ability to add elite players who elevate our program,\u201d 76ers general manager Elton Brand said. \u201cIn Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons, we have two of the NBA\u2019s top 20 players. Now, we\u2019ve added a third top-20 player in Jimmy Butler, who is one of the NBA\u2019s very best on both ends of the floor.\u201d The 76ers won 47 games in a three-season span between 2013 and 2016. They won 28 in 2016-17, made the jump to the playoffs at 52-30 last season and now will be considered an even more serious threat to emerge as the East rep in the NBA Finals. \u201cThe biggest challenge is piecing all this together,\u201d 76ers coach Brett Brown said. \u201cIt\u2019s not even close. \u2026 I say that completely from an excitement standpoint. This isn\u2019t a burden. Sure, it\u2019s a responsibility. But I\u2019m excited with piecing this together.\u201d Butler has averaged 21.8 points per game since the start of the 2014-15 season, the 13th-highest clip in the NBA over that span. \u201cI think he\u2019s going to bring toughness, scoring ability, a veteran,\u201d 76ers guard Markelle Fultz said after the team\u2019s shootaround practice in Miami on Monday, shortly before the deal was formally announced. \u201cJust going to compete on both ends of the floor and I hope he pushes this team to a higher level.\u201d There are three teams with multiple current teammates averaging at least that many points over those seasons. Golden State has three such players, with Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant and DeMarcus Cousins, though he hasn\u2019t played yet this season for the Warriors while recovering from surgery. Oklahoma City teammates Russell Westbrook and Paul George also have averaged that much \u2013 and now, Philly has such a pairing in Butler and Embiid. Butler is the obvious headliner to this trade, though there will be some adjustments for the 76ers to make now that the deal is finally done. Saric and Covington were key players for Philadelphia, combining to make 398 starters including playoffs for the 76ers during their time with the club. Saric averaged 13.5 points with the 76ers over parts of three seasons, while Covington averaged 12.9 points during his five seasons with Philly. They were the starting forwards for the 76ers in nearly every game last season, when Philadelphia had its best record since 2000-01 \u2013 the last time that the franchise went to the NBA Finals. The deal between the teams was struck on Saturday, though couldn\u2019t become official until Monday when the NBA had what\u2019s known as a trade call \u2013 where all the terms of the swap are reviewed to ensure the deal is permissible under league rules. It ends a two-month saga where there was no doubt that Butler was going to get traded out of Minnesota. He told the Timberwolves shortly before training camp that he wanted to be moved, which forced Minnesota\u2019s hand because it was obvious that Butler would not re-sign there next summer. So the options were move him for something, or lose him for nothing. \u201cHe loves to win,\u201d Fultz said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to do whatever it takes to win.\u201d * * *"},{"id":37466,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/philadelphia-76ers-jimmy-butler-trade-official-release","date":"2018-11-12","title":"Sixers officially acquire Jimmy Butler in trade with Timberwolves","content":" PHILADELPHIA \u2014 Philadelphia 76ers General Manager Elton Brand announced today that the team has acquired four-time NBA All-Star Jimmy Butler in a trade with the Minnesota Timberwolves.

Butler\u2019s teams have qualified for the playoffs in six of his seven NBA seasons. A native of Texas, Butler has been named to the All-NBA Third Team each of the past two seasons, in addition to earning All-Defensive Second Team honors four times in his career (2017-18, 2013-16). Following the 2014-15 season, his fourth NBA campaign, Butler was named the league\u2019s Most Improved Player as he saw his averages jump across the board, including a scoring hike from 13.1 points to 20.0 points per game. Internationally, Butler was a member of the 2016 USA Basketball Men\u2019s National Team, which compiled an 8-0 record en route to a gold medal at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.  Patton was originally selected by Chicago with the No. 16 overall pick of the 2017 NBA Draft before being traded to Minnesota on draft night. He played one collegiate season at Creighton. \u201cThe future of the 76ers organization got even brighter today with the acquisition of Jimmy Butler and Justin Patton,\u201d Philadelphia 76ers Co-Managing Partner David Blitzer said. \u201cJimmy Butler is one of the NBA\u2019s truly elite players, a player capable of changing the game on both ends of the floor.

That real estate \u2014 the extreme corners of courts throughout the NBA \u2014 is like Park Place and Boardwalk in this league, and Korver keeps his office there, with the best views and loftiest percentages. Korver\u2019s ability to space the floor from pretty much any point around the 3-point arc has made him one of the game\u2019s prized and best-known specialists. His accuracy from long distance, and often merely the threat of it, helped the teams on which he played \u2014 the Philadelphia 76ers, Utah Jazz, Chicago Bulls, Atlanta Hawks and now, Cleveland Cavaliers \u2014 reach the postseason 12 times in his 15 seasons. The No. 51 pick overall in 2003 , Korver was mostly a reserve in his first nine seasons. He became a starter in 2012 in Atlanta, however, and was an All-Star in 2014-15 with the Hawks. Korver\u2019s trade to the Cavaliers in January 2017 perked up the then-defending champs and got him to The Finals the past two years. And from 2009-10 to last season, Korver made 45 percent of his 3-pointers. This season? It\u2019s been different. His minutes are down (from 21.6 to 15.3), his 3-point percentage is down (38.7) and, of course, LeBron James is gone to the Los Angeles Lakers. The Cavaliers head into their home game Tuesday against Charlotte ( 7 p.m. ET, NBA TV ) with a 1-11 mark. They rank near the bottom statistically both offensively and defensively as they try to blend young players \u2014 notably, rookie point guard Collin Sexton \u2014 and veterans who have known better times into a new mix of styles and roles. That was just one of the topics Korver talked about with NBA.com\u2019s Steve Aschburner on Cleveland\u2019s weekend stop in Chicago:  * * * Steve Aschburner : As this season began, you said you were excited to be back. With so many changes even since then \u2014 injuries to Kevin Love and others, a coaching change from Tyronn Lue to Larry Drew after only six games \u2014 do you still feel that way? Kyle Korver : Yeah, I think you go into every season trying to be hopeful and optimistic. The part I was excited about, and still am excited about, is you\u2019re building a whole, brand new culture here. The last few years was kind of top-heavy with how we operated and how we played, and there has to be a new mindset. I like the building process \u2014 that\u2019s not the part that\u2019s hard. Losing\u2019s hard. And the injuries we\u2019ve had. It\u2019s hard to build the kind of culture you want when you\u2019re not healthy. It\u2019s hard to play. So we\u2019re losing. We\u2019re down bodies. There\u2019s been a coaching change. We\u2019re, what, [12] games in? A lot has happened.  SA : Quite a lot.  KK : We\u2019re all adjusting to going from the last few years to this new mindset. There\u2019s challenge to that, there\u2019s excitement to that and we\u2019re kind of caught in the middle trying to figure it all out. SA : Not to quibble, but what do you know about building a new culture? You\u2019ve been to the playoffs 12 times, including the past 11 years in a row. KK : Yeah, I haven\u2019t been on a lot of rebuilding teams, for sure. The only thing I can compare it to was when I went to Atlanta. Danny Ferry was the new GM and the whole \u201cAtlanta Hawks\u201d kind of got rebranded and rebuilt. they brought in coach [Mike Budenholzer], who brought in his staff, his philosophies and a ton of new players. I really liked those years. Building the culture \u2014 I enjoy that. But there\u2019s a lot that goes into that. You\u2019ve got to have a lot of pieces, not just on the team but throughout the organization. I think the Cavs are serious about that and working on it. SA : In training camp, Lue said you were \u201cin heaven\u201d in the revamped offense, given the movement and use of five men as opposed to the previous heavy reliance on isolation. Still heaven? KK : The last few games, we\u2019ve made progress in that. \u2026 The NBA, offensively and defensively, there\u2019s a shift in the league right now and we\u2019re trying to find our way. It\u2019s one thing to say, \u201cHere\u2019s our offense! This is how we\u2019re gonna play. Go out there and run it!\u201d But when you\u2019re going to make a lot of passes and a lot of cuts, and set a lot of screens and make a lot of reads, chemistry is a huge part of that. It\u2019s easy to draw up isolation basketball \u2014 it\u2019s not easy to draw up great motion offense with passing and cutting. There\u2019s a lot of feel to that and it takes time. We\u2019re at the beginning stages of it. SA : It would seem to allow less margin for error, with each pass or cut a potential turnover or mistake. KK : And we relied, the way we played the last few years, on LeBron to be the primary playmaker. So a lot of us have to kind of re-train our brain to be playmakers and not just get the ball and charge the basket or shoot right away. SA : Can you put into a few words, the Cavaliers with LeBron vs. the Cavaliers with LeBron?  KK : LeBron carries a certain weight. You feel him all the time. On the court, off the court, in the organization. I don\u2019t say weight in a bad way, but his presence is always felt. He is striving for greatness at all times. Because he\u2019s such a magnetic personality and such an incredible basketball player, people follow him. They look to him to lead the way. He was here for, how many years? So we have to create new leadership. Our own way. None of us is LeBron, on the court or off the court. There\u2019s an adjustment period for us all, to find our way, to find our voice. That takes time, because he filled all the gaps.  SA : LeBron is gone but Kevin Love [foot surgery] has been, too, for all practical purposes. It\u2019s probably not a coincidence that, last year, 66.3 percent of your shot attempts were considered \u201copen\u201d or \u201cwide open,\u201d according to NBA.com stats. This season so far? You\u2019re down to 48.9 percent. How much do you also miss the two-man game that you and Love honed last season, full of screens and passes? KK : [Sighs] I do miss it. Kevin is someone who, he and I had a nice little chemistry together. We could play off each other. Kevin is one of those guys where, a lot right now, the NBA is trying to switch everything and take away those threes, so you\u2019ve got to have guys who \u2014 if there is going to be a switch, you can punish it. Kevin is one of those guys. He can shoot outside, he can score inside. We had a nice little feel for each other in the playoffs there. So we miss Kevin in a lot of ways. SA : Already there have been trade rumors about some vets on this team, and they flared up again about you in particular with Jimmy Butler\u2019s trade to Philadelphia. The Sixers need shooting and that\u2019s where you began your career and still have deep roots. You\u2019re a player whose value rises as a season goes on. Are you prepared to play somewhere else? KK : You have to be. The NBA is a beautiful job in a lot of ways. But for living stability, thinking you\u2019re going to be somewhere for a long time, it\u2019s not for that. This is what you signed up for. You knew it going in, so you can\u2019t get mad about it. I have no idea what the future holds, to be honest. SA : This summer was different from previous ones. After another long playoff run and another loss in The Finals, you considered calling it quits. How did you make your decision to return? KK : That was a good four-to-six week process. I think after last year, my tank was just empty. If I can\u2019t put in the time to prepare in the offseason, I wouldn\u2019t feel good about just showing up and trying to \u201cjust hoop.\u201d I want to feel prepared, mentally and emotionally engaged with what I\u2019m doing. if I don\u2019t have those things, I\u2019m not going to be a very good player. And after everything that happened last year, with my family [Korver\u2019s youngest brother, Kirk, died unexpectedly in March ] and the playoffs and The Finals \u2026 I had to figure out first if my family was ready to do this again. It\u2019s not just about me.  SA : You\u2019ve got three little ones \u2014 Knox, Koen and Kyra \u2014 and your wife Juliet to consider. KK : My wife and I had to explore that \u2014 if we play another year, would we be OK in our marriage? Our kids are 6, 4 and 2, would they be OK? How many years are left? After giving it some time and letting the dust settle, and pulling yourself back up in the summertime, we were like, \u201cYeah, we\u2019re OK. We can keep going.\u201d SA : Had LeBron already made his decision to leave? KK : Oh yeah, he\u2019d already gone. My career\u2019s not based on LeBron. I like basketball. So it was like, \u201cDo you want to do this again?\u201d And I still love it. I went into the gym by myself \u2014 no rebounders, no friends, no family \u2014 and spent like two hours by myself thinking about it all. Dribbling and shooting. And I thought, \u201cI still love doing this, I really do. And my family\u2019s OK. Just keep going.\u201d SA : You\u2019re known for your offseason conditioning and a lot of varied, innovative workouts. But this sounds a lot more mental than physical. KK : It was definitely more that. My body, I\u2019m not too worried. But this is a big part of how I play \u2014 you have to be engaged 100 percent of the time. If I\u2019m not, I\u2019m not that good. SA : Has your family made sense yet of Kirk\u2019s death, which seized up on you all and was largely unexplained besides the shutting down of his internal organs? [Korver\u2019s parents, Kevin and Laine, had driven from their home in Iowa to the Cavs-Bulls game at United Center, and were joined by one brother and Korver\u2019s wife and kids.] KK : We haven\u2019t made sense of it. We didn\u2019t get a ton of answers. That\u2019s the hard thing. As we\u2019ve gone through this process, you hear story after story. So many people deal with this. Early death, and you\u2019re not sure why. It doesn\u2019t make it any easier, but it definitely it means there\u2019s this terrible club full of people that we can kind of lean on. But \u2026 yeah. SA : You rank fourth all time in 3-pointers made with 2,225 . At least, you do as we talk, because Steph Curry is 34 behind you. But among the top 25 on that all-time list, you and Rashard Lewis are the only ones who weren\u2019t first-round picks, and at No. 32 in 1998, he was drafted way earlier than you. Any special satisfaction from that?  KK : I\u2019ve purposely tried not to go down that path that much. I don\u2019t want to take away my focus. So I haven\u2019t given it any time. I try to see what\u2019s in front of me and keep on going forward, know that there are guys coming up quickly behind me [laughs]. SA : What do you remember about your first one? KK : I don\u2019t remember it. I do remember my first 3-point attempt . I missed it. In Philly, they had just come off the Larry Brown years [as coach] and they hadn\u2019t shot a lot of threes. I came in and shot one really quick, like in a few seconds. I missed it, but the whole place stood up and cheered. It was like, someone had come along to shoot some threes for them. SA : Any memorable threes?  KK : Some. The toughest one I ever hit, I don\u2019t even know if they have footage of it, it was so long ago. There were 24 seconds left in the game at New Orleans, and on an out-of-bounds play, I was running toward the corner when I caught it and shot it. Made it to force overtime. That\u2019s my memory, the hardest one I ever shot and made, and it tied the game at the buzzer.  SA : What do you consider to be the biggest change in NBA game since you\u2019ve been in the league? KK : It\u2019s the offensive freedom that guys are allowed to have. Obviously, players\u2019 skill sets have expanded with offensive philosophies. When I came in the league, you only shot a three if the ball went inside first \u2014 inside-out threes. The plays we had for threes, we only ran them if it was the end of the game and we needed a three. So it\u2019s really changed a lot, especially in the last five years. SA : How about changes off the court? KK : I think technology has changed everything. Everyone sees themselves as a business, as a brand. There are a lot more opportunities out there. How you conduct yourself, how you work \u2014 we don\u2019t really have offseasons anymore. Guys are constantly in the gym, constantly trying to get better, constantly improving their game. It\u2019s an all-year thing now. On the court, off the court. It\u2019s not just about playing in a nationally televised game. Everyone sees everything every night now. SA : Analytics, it would seem, has been a friend to you. Focusing on your specialty, the average team when you were a rookie took 1,224 3-pointers, taking about 18.7 percent of its shots from there. So far this season, coaches have shifted twice that portion of their attack to the arc \u2014 35.3 percent \u2014 and the average team will shoot nearly 2,500 threes. KK : For sure, for sure. It\u2019s been fun to have my career coincide with how the game has gone. To be a part of it in the beginning when things were just starting to change \u2014 my second year was when Steve Nash in Phoenix and [coach] Mike D\u2019Antoni really kind of came on \u2014 it was like, \u201cWhoa, this whole new style of basketball!\u201d And then it kind of became the norm. You saw different players come along and change the game \u2014 and change the way people see the game. What\u2019s a \u201cgood shot\u201d now is so different than back then. Then, it was \u201cHow do we get the ball in the paint? How do we get a good mid-range two?\u201d Now it\u2019s \u201cHow do you get a good corner three? How do you get shooters open? How do you space the floor better? How do you play faster?\u201d It\u2019s been fun to be a part of this whole \u2026 revolution, I guess? Evolution, revolution. SA : When you\u2019re in the car alone, are you music, talk radio or deep thoughts? KK : It depends. I\u2019ll do podcasts, a lot of spiritual things. I\u2019ll do music some times. Other times I like just quiet. Think and pray and get myself ready for the day. It\u2019s good to have \u2014 I need those 20 minutes, 30 minutes every day. So sometimes that car time is when I get my mind into it. SA : Last one. If you had NBA commissioner Adam Silver\u2019s job for one day, what would you do? KK : Hmm. I don\u2019t know. Our commissioner does a great job. I think he\u2019s on it. I\u2019d take his salary for a day, though. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Behind a monstrous 48-point game from Denver guard Jamal Murray, the Nuggets improved to 9-1 and continued their surprising start in the West. For Boston, this is one it will remember \u2014 particularly guard Kyrie Irving, who was miffed by Murray\u2019s late-game efforts to reach the 50-point mark. Trail Blazers 118, Bucks 103 \u2014 For Portland to replicate last season\u2019s run to the Northwest title, CJ McCollum will need to deliver a few wins for the team. That\u2019s exactly what he did Tuesday at the Moda Center, torching the Bucks for 40 points on a red-hot shooting night. The victory was another solid one for Portland, who have knocked off more than their fair share of playoff-worth squads to open 2018-19. Heat 95, Spurs 88 \u2014 This one obviously doesn\u2019t erase the sting of the 2014 Finals for Heat fans. But thanks to a historic game from Hassan Whiteside, Miami logged its first victory against San Antonio since that series. Whiteside put up a performance that hadn\u2019t been seen since Hakeem Olajuwon in 1989 (more on that below). Bucks 134, Warriors 111 \u2014 Milwaukee belongs in the upper crust of the NBA and made a loud statement in that department with its blowout win in Oakland on Thursday. Proving their offense is more than just Giannis Antetokounmpo doing it all, Eric Bledsoe and others blistered the Warriors to help the Bucks to their biggest win yet of 2018-19. Sixers 133, Hornets 132 (OT) \u2014 Although they go about it in markedly different ways, Kemba Walker and Joel Embiid are two of the NBA\u2019s best scorers this season. They put their sizzling (and varied) scoring talents on display Friday in Philly. Walker got the Hornets to overtime by scoring 19 of his 30 points in the fourth quarter. Embiid delivered at the free throw line, making 14 of his 16 attempts between the fourth quarter and OT to lock up the win. Lakers 107, Hawks 106 \u2014 A LeBron James-led team is expected to beat one whose better days are seemingly in the future. That\u2019s what happened Sunday \u2026 but with a heavy dose of drama. After James\u2019 dunk with 15.3 seconds to play gave the Lakers a 107-106 lead, new addition Tyson Chandler swatted away a promising floater from the Hawks\u2019 Trae Young to seal a thrilling victory. Jamal Murray (48 points, 19-30 FG, 5-11 3pt FG, 5 reb, 4 ast in 38 minutes) \u2014 Heading into Monday\u2019s showdown with Boston, Murray had scored 25 or more points just once in 2018-19. Overall, his offense was inconsistent and his 3-point percentage was under 30 percent. That all changed against the Celtics, as Murray keyed a huge win and got his overall game a bit more on track, too. | Watch | Video box score CJ McCollum (40 points, 17-26 FG, 5-10 3pt FG, 5 rebounds, 6 assists, 4 steals in 35 minutes) \u2014 Hitting the 40-point mark is no new thing for McCollum, as he had four 40-point games heading into Tuesday\u2019s game against the Bucks. The 40 points he got on that night, though, marked the earliest point in a season he reached that plateau. And, in topping Milwaukee, the win gave Portland additional confidence as it tries to stay in the thick of the West chase. | Watch | Video box score Hassan Whiteside (29 points, 10-18 FG, 0-1 3pt FG, 20 rebounds, 2 assists, 9 blocks in 32 minutes) \u2014 The modern NBA says big men should shoot 3-pointers like a guard and get comfy on the perimeter. Whiteside continues to buck that trend and showed the merits of doing so with his Wednesday effort against the Spurs. His 20-20 game with nine blocks was a stat no one had posted since Hall of Famer Hakeem Olajuwon did it in December of 1989! | Watch | Video box score Brook Lopez (28 pts, 10-17 FG, 8-13 3pt FG, 4 rebounds, 1 assists, 1 steal, 2 blocks in 36 minutes) \u2014 No, you didn\u2019t fall into a time machine and its suddenly 2011 or so. Lopez is on this list after a monstrous showing from deep in Milwaukee\u2019s latest big win, a 121-114 road win against the Denver Nuggets. He left Denver\u2019s defense baffled all night long and is on pace to make an astounding 246 3-pointers this season. | Watch | Video box score High-jump contest  Nope, not that way   Creating a buzz   \u201cOur offense is anemic.

At one point, his shoelace exploded . Lopez knocked down a career-high eight 3-pointers and scored a season-high 28 points to help the Bucks defeat the Nuggets 121-114 in a matchup of fast-starting teams. With the victory, the Bucks ended their four-game, West Coast trip with a 2-2 record, knocking off Denver and the mighty Golden State Warriors. Channeling his inner Steph Curry, Lopez drilled six of seven 3-point attempts in third quarter alone, including several from at least 25 feet. Lopez has made at least six 3s in three of his last four games and is shooting 38.8 percent from deep this season. He was 8 of 13 from distance Sunday night. Asked about his latest 3-point barrage, Lopez said, \u201cIf you\u2019re open and that\u2019s your shot, just let it fly .\u201d The Bucks certainly have been letting it fly from beyond the arc this season under new head coach Mike Budenholzer, so don\u2019t expect Lopez to stop chucking from deep. Milwaukee currently leads the league in 3-pointers made per game and are second in 3-pointers attempted per game. The boing is back. Vince Carter plans to wear his iconic Nike Shox BB4 for the rest of the season, the shoe he wore when he soared over 7-foot-2 Frenchman Frederic Weis at the 2000 Summer Olympics. Carter laced up the classic sneakers before the Hawks-Lakers game. \u201cThe success of the dunk started the legend of the shoes,\u201d said Carter. I became a star player in the BB4.\u201d Cue \u201cThe Dunk of Death\u201d \u2026 Bought out by the Suns and signed by the Lakers last week, Tyson Chandler has played a key defensive role in his first three games with his new team \u2014 all wins. After LeBron James\u2019 go-ahead dunk with 15 seconds remaining, Chandler blocked Trae Young\u2019s driving layup to preserve a 107-106 victory over the Hawks. Believe it or not, it was James\u2019 first career game-winning dunk in the final minute of a game (regular season or playoffs). \u201cI find myself acting like a kid in a candy store again,\u201d said Chandler, who couldn\u2019t hear James amid the din of music and cheering. \u201cI said, \u2018That\u2019s my dawg,'\u201d James yelled across the Lakers\u2019 locker room. Rockets rediscover identity  It took nearly a month, but the Rockets finally got their first home win. And they did it with a familiar formula. Houston took 47 shots from deep and made a season-high 20 in its 115-103 victory over the Pacers. Harden led the way with eight 3s as he posted his first 40-point game of the season.  Tough night at the Garden  Playing on the second night of a back-to-back, the Knicks came out flat and missed 10 of their first 12 shots. New York trailed Orlando 30-10 after the first quarter, and a smattering of boos could be heard from the Madison Square Garden crowd. Orlando led by 33 early in the fourth quarter and won 115-89 , handing coach David Fizdale his worst loss since coming to the Knicks. One bright spot for New York: Mitchell Robinson set a Knicks rookie record with nine blocks . Brook Lopez has made more 3-pointers (39) this season than Klay Thompson (31) \u2026 and Thompson has more rebounds (47) this year than Lopez (42)."},{"id":37517,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/carmelo-anthony-sits-again-speculation-swirls","date":"2018-11-12","title":"Rockets GM denies report that Anthony will be waived, calls speculation unfair","content":" HOUSTON \u2014 Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey denied a report Sunday that said Carmelo Anthony\u2019s time with the team will soon come to an end. Anthony, who was out for the second straight game Sunday night with an illness, is in his first season with the Rockets after one year in Oklahoma City. The New York Times had a sourced report Sunday saying Anthony has been notified that he will soon be waived. When asked about that report before Sunday\u2019s victory over the Pacers, Morey said: \u201cThat\u2019s inaccurate.\u201d Citing sources of its own, ESPN followed with a report after the game that Anthony\u2019s teammates and coaches believe he has played his last game with the team. The Rockets, who reached the Western Conference finals last season, are off to a disappointing 5-7 start after beating Indiana on Sunday . Many outsiders are blaming Anthony for the team\u2019s struggles. Morey went on to say that he wanted to speak to reporters in large part to defend Anthony. \u201cIt\u2019s unfair that there\u2019s all this speculation on just one person,\u201d Morey said. \u201cI understand it he\u2019s obviously a Hall of Famer. But it\u2019s unfair.\u201d Anthony, who is in his 16th season, has averaged 13.4 points and 5.4 rebounds in 10 games with two starts this season. When asked if he\u2019s evaluating Anthony\u2019s role on the team, Morey said they\u2019re evaluating everyone as they try to get the team on track. \u201cI know that we\u2019re talking about everything,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re a team trying to win the championship and we\u2019re 4-7 and we\u2019re not in a good place so we\u2019re looking at everything. We\u2019re looking at all aspects right now.\u201d He added that he \u201cwould expect\u201d Anthony to play when he\u2019s healthy. Anthony joined the Rockets after a tumultuous season with the Thunder where he averaged a career-low 16.2 points in 78 starts. Coach Mike D\u2019Antoni laughed off the supposition that the rumors about Anthony are a distraction to his team. \u201cOur problem is we can\u2019t shoot the basketball,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a hindrance \u2026 and we\u2019ve got to fix that.\u201d D\u2019Antoni said Houston\u2019s problems are definitely not Anthony\u2019s fault and agreed with Morey that the outside criticism of him has been unfair. \u201cMelo\u2019s been great and he\u2019s done everything we\u2019ve asked,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said. Morey said that it\u2019s \u201chis job\u201d to figure out how to get the team going, but that he\u2019s seen signs recently that things will soon turn around. \u201cI feel like we have been playing better \u2026 but the reality is we\u2019re nowhere near where we expect to be and we have high expectations and we\u2019re going to stick with those,\u201d Morey said.

We are open to Jimmy and can\u2019t wait for him to get here. I\u2019m excited to play with him.\u201d Simmons said he spoke with Butler earlier in the day about their plans for the new-look Sixers. \u201cBetween me, [Joel Embiid] and Jimmy, we all have that similar mindset of we hate losing, that pisses us off and we want to win,\u201d Simmons said. \u201cA guy like him who can come in, score the ball, veteran leadership, experience \u2014 he\u2019s going to fit in here. Our culture is winning, playing together as a team and playing hard. I think he\u2019s going to bring that.\u201d While Embiid hadn\u2019t talked with Butler yet, he did get the chance to discuss the trade with two players who have plenty of experience with Butler \u2014 former Timberwolves teammates Karl-Anthony Towns and Andrew Wiggins. \u201cThey thought that he was going to be good for us,\u201d Embiid said after the game. \u201cThey thought that we were definitely going to get along. He wants to win. [Wiggins] told me that he thought that we were going to win the East for sure.\u201d The addition of Butler isn\u2019t without its downsides, though, as the Sixers were forced to say goodbye to longtime teammates Dario Saric and Robert Covington. \u201cI miss Dario and [Covington],\u201d said Embiid. \u201cThey gave us a lot the past couple of years. I felt like we were starting to play really well together and figure it out. Dario was finding himself again, and Cov is first-team all-defense, doing his job and knocking down shots. I felt like we were starting to like really figure it out and play well together. \u201cBut it\u2019s a business. Gotta move on. Love those guys. Wish them luck. I miss them, I love them. Gotta keep in touch with them.\u201d With Butler soon to be in the fold, Embiid and Simmons aren\u2019t worried about how the four-time All-Star will affect the team\u2019s offensive ball movement. \u201cI think he\u2019s going to help us a lot offensively and especially defensively,\u201d said Embiid. \u201cWith the type of system we play, we like to move the ball. The ball goes through everybody\u2019s hands, so I don\u2019t think bringing someone else will take the ball out of my hands or Ben\u2019s hands. We are going to figure it out. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s coming in here willing to fit in. \u201cI\u2019m excited to see where he takes us, and how much better we are going to look.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not going to affect my game.

That was Rockets coach Mike D\u2019Antoni\u2019s recent answer, simple yet so perfectly evocative, when asked about his team\u2019s miserable offensive performance to start 2018-19. Those woes continued Saturday against the Spurs as the Rockets sputtered once again en route to a toothless 96-89 loss . Even as the rest of the NBA enjoys a turbo-charged renaissance, it marked the sixth time the Rockets have failed to score 100 points in 11 games this season. They did so just eight times last season, when they led the league in offensive efficiency at 114.7 points per 100 possessions. Bump the threshold down to 90, and they\u2019ve not only doubled every other team\u2019s total this season with four, they\u2019ve already surpassed their total of three from the past two seasons combined . The Rockets entered Saturday\u2019s game ranked 27th at 105.4 per 100, and a pitiful 29th in raw points per game at 102.8. Both figures dropped even further after they shot a miserable 33.3 percent with just 11 assists on 30 field goals against the Spurs. Yuck, indeed. And the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance: The Carmelo Anthony Experiment has failed miserably so far, to the point that the Rockets are reportedly pondering whether they even want him on the team anymore. (To whit: Anthony has more missed field goals than the sum total of his made baskets, assists, steals and blocked shots.) With five months until the playoffs begin, the Rockets obviously have plenty of time to turn things around. Exactly how they\u2019re going to do that, however, remains a mystery. \u201cIf I knew, I\u2019d tell you,\u201d said Chris Paul, who shot 4 for 13. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I think \u2026 the law of averages will kick in at some point, so I\u2019m expecting us to get unbelievably hot. We\u2019re still figuring it out.\u201d Hahahaha, of course not. The planet would spontaneously explode before the Warriors even considered moving game-breaking, two-time MVP Stephen Curry. But you have to hand it to Warriors reserve Quinn Cook: Give him an opportunity, and he\u2019ll invariably make the most of it. Starting just the 19th game of his career in the injured Curry\u2019s stead, Cook poured in a season-high 27 points to help the Warriors dismantle the Nets 116-100 . It continued his history of strong play in the starting lineup, having averaged 14.6 points on 49.3-percent shooting in his previous 18 opens for the Warriors. Despite such impressive production, Cook has found playing time tough to come by with the Warriors, for obvious reasons. Which makes Warriors coach Steve Kerr even more grateful to have such a dependable option when injuries and other circumstances inevitably arise. \u201cThat\u2019s the mark of a pro,\u201d Kerr said. \u201dHe\u2019s a great fit for us. Always prepared and always ready. His role is going to swing wildly based on our health and what\u2019s happening out on the floor but he\u2019s always ready.\u201d To be very clear, Zach LaVine is not Michael Jordan. Once again: LAVINE IS NOT JORDAN. That said, the flamboyant Bulls guard did a pretty passable impersonation with a series of high-altitude maneuvers in his team\u2019s 99-98 triumph over the Cavaliers. So good, in fact, that the Bulls themselves couldn\u2019t help but notice the similarity between the two on LaVine\u2019s slick reverse layup. For good measure, LaVine added this putback slam off a missed free throw, yet another callback to one of Jordan\u2019s many specialties when it came to scoring the basketball in the most athletic, stylish manner possible. The 76ers fell to the Grizzlies in overtime, in part because All-Star center Joel Embiid shot just 4 for 15 with six turnovers. He nonetheless racked up his 13th double-double in 14 games this season, becoming the first Sixers player to do so since Moses Malone in 1982-83. Could it be a good omen on an already great day for the Sixers? Malone won his third MVP award that season while leading them to their most recent championship.  DeMar DeRozan struggled through a rare off night against the Rockets with just 13 points on 4-for-13 shooting. He still finished the night averaging 25.2 points, 6.8 rebounds and 6.5 assists, joining Kevin Durant and (of course) LeBron James as the only NBA players to reach those thresholds this season. 71.7 \u2014 That\u2019s the individual defensive rating, as measured by points allowed per 100 possessions when he was on the court, for new Lakers center Tyson Chandler during his 23-minute stint against the Kings. To put that into perspective, the Lakers are giving up 109.1 per 100 as a team this season, good enough to rank 17th in the league. It comes on the heels of a 97.9 rating in Chandler\u2019s Lakers debut against the Timberwolves, providing another sign that his addition could be just what they need to shore up the leaky defense that has plagued them during their uneven start. Jabari Parker made headlines this summer during his introductory press conference with the Bulls, when he said NBA players aren\u2019t paid to play defense. (Given how offensive production has soared this season, he might have had a point.) But even Parker can be suitably motivated with the game on the line, preserving his team\u2019s one-point win over the Cavs with a clutch block. Veterans frequently mess with rookies just because they can. Such was the case the other day when some unidentified Hawks \u2014 not to drop dimes or anything, but Jeremy Lin reportedly had a leading role \u2014 filled Trae Young\u2019s $138,000 Audi with popcorn. Clippers rookie Jerome Robinson became the latest victim of this time-honored NBA tradition, and he has no one to blame but himself. According to Tobias Harris, Robinson drew his teammates\u2019 ire by forgetting breakfast for their morning shootaround. "},{"id":37554,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/jimmy-butlers-impact-sixers-stats-look","date":"2018-11-11","title":"Numbers to know: How Jimmy Butler will impact Sixers","content":" The Philadelphia 76ers are going all-in on winning now, having reportedly agreed to a trade that will send Robert Covington, Dario Saric, Jerryd Bayless and a 2022 second-round pick to Minnesota for disgruntled star Jimmy Butler and injured big man Justin Patton. The principles, of course, are Butler, Covington and Saric, with Philly dealing two starters for one. The Sixers now have a nominal \u201cBig Three\u201d in Butler, Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid. The question is how well they will fit together. Here are some numbers of note as we look at the new-look Sixers \u2026 The Sixers already have a primary ballhandler in Simmons. But when the game is on the line, Simmons takes a step backward. In each of the last two seasons, he has seen a drop in usage rate in clutch minutes, in part because he doesn\u2019t shoot from outside the paint and doesn\u2019t shoot well from the free throw line. Butler can obviously handle the ball more than Covington and Saric combined. He ranked sixth in the league in clutch usage rate last season, having used 41 percent of the Wolves\u2019 possessions while he was on the floor with the score within five in the last five minutes of the fourth quarter or overtime. Right now, the Sixers\u2019 go-to action on big possessions is a two-man game with Embiid and JJ Redick, which is difficult to defend in any situation. Embiid (18) and Redick (15) have taken 33 of the team\u2019s 47 shots in the clutch . A weak-side Butler\/Simmons pick-and-roll as a secondary option on those plays wouldn\u2019t be too bad. Non-clutch possessions are important, too. The Sixers are 8-5 after their overtime win over Charlotte on Friday, but they\u2019ve been outscored by seven points over their 13 games. They\u2019ve seen the league\u2019s sixth biggest drop in offensive efficiency, having scored 2.6 fewer points per 100 possessions than they did last season. Turnovers, as they\u2019ve always been, are an issue. The Sixers rank 25th in turnover rate , having coughed the ball up 15.6 times per 100 possessions. Shooting is another issue. The Sixers rank 21st in 3-point percentage (33.6 percent), down from 10th last season (36.9 percent). One big problem is that the Sixers are starting two guards \u2013 Simmons and Markelle Fultz \u2013 that can\u2019t shoot. The two former No. 1 picks have combined to make just 14 shots (on 61 attempts) from f rom outside the paint through 13 games, and the Sixers have scored just 94.2 points per 100 possessions (6.1 points per 100 possessions worse than the worst offense in the league) with the pair on the floor together. The Sixers\u2019 third point guard, T.J. McConnell, has attempted just two 3-pointers in 127 minutes. So three of the Sixers\u2019 top five guards are reluctant to shoot from deep. Saric\u2019s shooting has been bad, too. He was 13-for-56 (23 percent) from 3-point range before making eight of his 14 attempts over the last two games. Still, in regard to shooting, the Sixers gave up more than they got back in the trade. Covington and Saric led the team in catch-and-shoot 3-pointers last season, with Covington\u2019s 189 leading the entire league . Redick\u2019s shooting, combined with his relentless movement, is the more important complement to Simmons and Embiid, but having two forwards who can shoot off the catch has been critical. Butler (38.8 percent) has actually been a better catch-and-shoot 3-point shooter than both Covington (35.4 percent) and Saric (36.0 percent) over the last two-plus seasons, but not at the same volume, and he\u2019s been more likely to be inside the arc when shooting off the catch. On the other end of the floor, the Sixers just got smaller. They ranked third defensively last season and rank 10th this season , in part because they\u2019re huge, with four starters that are 6-9 (Covington), 6-10 (Saric), 6-10 (Simmons) and 7-0 (Embiid). Covington is now replaced by the 6-8 Butler. Simmons can surely defend the power forward position, the 6-9 Wilson Chandler is another versatile forward, and the 6-11 Mike Muscala will continue to play some minutes at the four next to Embiid. But the Sixers will lose some of their ability to consistently out-size their opponents. Butler is a terrific defender when engaged, but so is Covington, who led the league by a pretty comfortable margin in deflections per 36 minutes last season. In his final game with the Sixers, Covington was a big factor in keeping Kemba Walker in check until the fourth quarter on Friday. (In two games against the Sixers, Walker has shot 8-for-21 with Covington as his primary defender .) We can\u2019t assume that Sixers\u2019 roster won\u2019t change between now and March. They still have assets they can use to acquire more shooting. Last season, both Marco Belinelli and Ersan Ilyasova were signed after post-deadline buyouts and gave the team a big lift on the offensive end of the floor. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

And just like that, Philadelphia has a new Big Three \u2013 one that could make serious noise in the Eastern Conference. Butler was officially traded to the 76ers in a package that will send Dario Saric and Robert Covington to the Timberwolves. Justin Patton will also be sent to Philadelphia, and Jerryd Bayless and a 2022 second-round pick are also going to Minnesota. The Athletic first reported the agreement. Philadelphia\u2019s \u201cProcess\u201d led it to the second round of the playoffs last season behind two of the game\u2019s youngest, brightest stars in big man Joel Embiid and point guard Ben Simmons. Butler, an elite wing and outstanding defender, will join them in a quest to rule the Eastern Conference now that LeBron James has left that league to join the Los Angeles Lakers following eight straight trips to the NBA Finals with Miami and Cleveland. The first order of business will be making the trade official, something that could come in time to get Butler in uniform for a game at Miami on Monday. The next step for Philadelphia will be coming to an agreement on an extension for Butler, a pending free agent who made clear to Minnesota that he would not be re-signing there in 2019. Translated: The Wolves had to trade him, or they would lose him for nothing over the summer. There has been Butler drama every step of the way this season. ESPN reported that at his first practice with Minnesota this fall, Butler verbally challenged players, coaches and general manager Scott Layden while dominating in scrimmages, even when going up against stars like Karl-Anthony Towns and Andrew Wiggins. Butler said the report was true. \u201cAll my emotion came out at one time,\u201d Butler told ESPN later that day. \u201cWas it the right way to do it? No. But I can\u2019t control that when I\u2019m out there competing. That\u2019s my love of the game. That\u2019s raw me. Me at my finest, me at my purest. That\u2019s what you\u2019re going to get inside the lines.\u201d Butler continued to be miserable in Minnesota, and the Timberwolves have gotten off to a lousy start waiting for this inevitable move. Minnesota finished a 0-5 road trip with a loss in Sacramento on Friday night and is 4-9 overall \u2013 winless in eight games on the road. Butler played in 10 of those games, averaging 21.3 points. It was a peculiar arrangement; the Timberwolves were still running things through him often, even while the worst-kept secret in the NBA was that he wanted a change of address. Plenty of teams were mentioned along the way \u2013 Houston, the Los Angeles Clippers, Miami among them \u2013 as top candidates. Butler, who turned 29 on Sept. 14, has been an All-Star in each of the last four seasons. There are also concerns, though they clearly didn\u2019t put off Philadelphia. Butler has missed at least 15 games in four of the last five seasons, including a career-high 23 games last year while dealing with a knee injury. Philadelphia will become Butler\u2019s third team, after Chicago and Minnesota. He\u2019s a career 16.5 point-per-game scorer, though that is skewed by his first two seasons that were very meager on the scoring front. He\u2019s on pace this season to average at least 20 points for the fifth consecutive year. \u201cWelcome to the best sports city in America,\u201d quarterback Carson Wentz of the Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles tweeted to Butler. Saric is in his third season and averaging 11.1 points, shooting only 36 percent. Covington had been a starter for Philadelphia for the bulk of the last four-plus seasons and is averaging 11.3 points per game this year. Philadelphia and Minnesota don\u2019t meet until Jan. 15. Butler\u2019s return trip to Minnesota this season would be March 30, when he\u2019s sure to be showered with boos from a Target Center crowd that jeered him at the beginning of the home opener before quickly letting up. Butler had 33 points on 10-for-12 shooting from the floor in 36 minutes that night against Cleveland, a reminder amid the drama why coach Tom Thibodeau was so eager to acquire him the year before. Thibodeau swung a draft-night deal with Chicago that sent Zach LaVine, Kris Dunn and a first-round pick that became Lauri Markkanen to the Bulls for Butler and a later first-rounder Minnesota used on Patton. In the wake of that move, long-frustrated Wolves fans figured they were finally on their way to contending in the Western Conference for the first time since the Kevin Garnett era ended. Paired with Towns and Wiggins, the first overall picks in the 2015 and 2014 drafts, respectively, Butler immediately provided the experience, tenacity and defense the Wolves were missing, in addition to his scoring touch. He loved playing for Thibodeau, his coach for his first five seasons with the Bulls, and they helped Minnesota get to the playoffs last spring for the first time in 14 years. But the roster never truly meshed. Butler used his brash, blunt personality to challenge Towns and Wiggins to become more consistent defenders. And now, a new start awaits them all."},{"id":37522,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-minnesota-timberwolves-trade-butler-76ers","date":"2018-11-10","title":"Reports: Minnesota Timberwolves trade Jimmy Butler to 76ers","content":"The Jimmy Butler era is over for the Minnesota Timberwolves, who shipped the All-Star swingman to the Philadelphia 76ers  in a multi-player deal, per ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski and Zach Lowe. In the trade, the Wolves will reportedly receive Robert Covington, Dario Saric, Jerryd Bayless and a 2022 second-round pick while the 76ers will get Butler and Justin Patton. Wojnarowski and Lowe add that Philadelphia will be interested in giving Butler a long-term contract : Days before the Timberwolves opened training camp, Butler made his trade request known . His initial list of preferred destinations included the Brooklyn Nets, LA Clippers and New York Knicks, with the Houston Rockets and Miami Heat entering the mix days later. He was ultimately dealt to Philadelphia, where he will play alongside Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid. To date, the 76ers are 8-5 this season, sitting in 3rd place in the Eastern Conference. Following a fifth straight loss, Tom Thibodeau and the Wolves decided the team could no longer function with Butler around: Butler had been absent for most of training camp and the preseason after he requested a trade from the team in September. He played and started in the Wolves\u2019 season-opener on Wednesday, scoring 23 points in 31 minutes as Minnesota lost to San Antonio . He returned to the team in early October for a contentious practice where he reportedly called out his coaches, teammates and the front office. After the practice, Butler spoke with ESPN\u2019s Rachel Nichols to explain his actions. Prior to his trade to the 76ers, Bulter and Wolves owner Glen Taylor met and reached an agreement. The gist of the pact was that Butler would continue to play for Minnesota while Taylor and the Wolves\u2019 front office would seek trades for him. \u201cHe will be a regular team player. What I said to him in the meantime is our GM, Scott Layden, will be talking to other teams to see if there is a trade that works,\u201d Taylor told the Star Tribune recently . After one of the Wolves\u2019 final practices before the start of the season, Butler voiced his desire to provide a full effort for Minnesota for as long as he was on its roster. \u201cThey want me to go out here and hoop to the best of my abilities,\u201d Butler said. \u201cMake sure I\u2019m healthy, compete, because that\u2019s what I love to do, and do it for the guys in the same jerseys as me.\u201d The Timberwolves reportedly were close to trading Butler to the Miami Heat in early October, but the talks reportedly broke down at the last minute. Miami was most frequently mentioned as a suitor for Butler, who made it clear to Timberwolves management that he preferred to be dealt before finishing out the final year of his contract. In many of those Heat-Wolves trade scenarios bandied about, Miami guard Josh Richardson saw his name come up several times. Butler, a four-time All-Star, averaged 22.2 points, 5.3 rebounds, 4.9 assists and 2.0 steals in 59 games for the Timberwolves last season. He had a minor procedure done on his right hand in July after meniscus surgery on his right knee in February, an injury that kept him out for 21 games in 2017-18. Butler holds a player option on his contract next season, but it is widely expected he will opt out and join a 2019 free-agent market that many expect to be robust. Minnesota\u2019s All-Star big man, Karl-Anthony Towns, was entering the final year of his contract in 2018-19 as well. But he signed an extension with the Wolves shortly after training camp opened , securing his place in Minnesota for years to come. In early July, Butler reportedly turned down Minnesota\u2019s four-year extension worth approximately $110 million. Reports circulated in the offseason that Butler was frustrated with the nonchalant attitudes of Towns and Andrew Wiggins. Next season, Wiggins will begin playing on his maximum contract in 2018-19, with a $25 million-plus salary that will account for more than 20 percent of the team\u2019s cap and push the Timberwolves close to the luxury tax threshold. The Timberwolves acquired Butler from Chicago in exchange for Kris Dunn, Zach LaVine and Lauri Markkanen during the 2017 offseason. The former 30th overall pick helped propel the young Timberwolves to a 47-35 season while earning his fourth consecutive All-Star berth. The Wolves made the playoffs, ending a 14-year drought for the franchise , but they lost 4-1 to the top-seeded Houston Rockets in the first round.

The draft for the 2019 All-Star Game will reportedly be televised, and we should expect to see Joel Embiid selected early (if not serve as a captain himself). He\u2019s on pace to start his second straight All-Star Game after getting off to an impressive start to the season. Embiid exterminated the Hornets in an overtime win on Friday, finishing with an overwhelming stat line of 42 points, 18 rebounds and four blocks . The 7-foot center currently ranks second in the NBA in scoring, seventh in rebounding and fourth in blocks. He\u2019s a big reason the Sixers are now 7-0 at home.

(AP) \u2014 Stephen Curry has a mild to moderate left groin strain and will miss Golden State\u2019s home game against Brooklyn on Saturday night ( 8:30 ET, NBA League Pass ). Curry underwent an MRI exam Friday but the Warriors will wait a few days to fully determine the severity of the injury. Coach Steve Kerr said it doesn\u2019t appear to be significant. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s going to be a long-term injury. He\u2019s disappointed but it could have been a lot worse,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cWe\u2019ll just monitor his progress over the next several days.\u201d The two-time NBA MVP was hurt midway through the third quarter of Thursday night\u2019s 134-111 loss to the Milwaukee Bucks. Curry grabbed at his inner thigh after trying to contest Eric Bledsoe\u2019s shot in transition at the 6:50 mark of the third. The 30-year-old Curry has been averaging 29.5 points, 6.1 assists and 5.0 rebounds while shooting 49.2 percent from 3-point range. Curry scored 10 points Thursday in his second straight game below 20 after getting at least 23 in every game previously \u2013 including five 30-point performances and a 51-point outing in three quarters. He dished out six assists in 26 minutes. \u201cHe\u2019s a little bummed out,\u201d Kerr said. The Warriors won\u2019t take a chance with him at this early stage of the season. Curry hurt his left knee March 23 just as he had come back from a six-game absence with a right ankle injury. He also missed 11 games in December with a sprained right ankle. Curry missed the first round of the playoffs then returned for Game 2 of the Western Conference semifinals against the Pelicans as the Warriors went on to win a second straight championship and third title in four years. Quinn Cook, who filled in last season when Curry was hurt for a long stretch, will start against the Nets. He was promoted from the G League as a two-way player and received a two-year contract ahead of the playoff run. \u201cFor me to start a lot last year late and play big playoff games \u2026 that did a lot for our confidence,\u201d Cook said. \u201cJust staying ready, you\u2019ve just always got to work \u2013 come in early, stay late.\u201d Fellow All-Star Draymond Green also will miss Saturday\u2019s game, the second straight game that he\u2019ll be sidelined by a sprained right foot and toe. Key reserve guard Shaun Livingston missed his sixth straight game and eighth in the last 10 with a sore right foot, but was able to do some scrimmaging Friday. He will have to do that several times before Kerr is ready to put him back on the floor in a game."},{"id":37555,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/city-edition-uniforms-2018-19","date":"2018-11-09","title":"City Edition uniforms: Teams league-wide unveil new looks for 2018-19","content":" Across the NBA, the City Edition uniforms for the 2018-19 season are coming into view for fans. Some are updates of what teams wore a season ago, while others are a completely new look. Here\u2019s what teams will be sporting on City Edition nights this season \u2026 * 2018-19 City Edition uniforms:  Eastern Conference | Western Conference * * * As one of the most iconic players in both NBA and team history, Magic Johnson has lent his skill to the Lakers\u2019 City Edition uniforms. Per the Lakers : \u201cThrough his electrifying playmaking and personality, Magic Johnson exemplified what it meant to be a Laker during the Showtime era. The NBA legend lends his magic touch and eye for detail to Nike to help create the latest Lakers City Edition jersey.  The Mavericks chose to focus this year\u2019s City Edition uniform around a \u201cTrue Maverick\u201d theme, meant to represent the rebirth of the franchise around a new roster featuring prize rookie Luka Doncic.  The Pacers\u2019 City Edition uniforms are focused on speed. The all-caps \u201cPACERS\u201d font and the slogan \u201cAlways Lead\u201d highlight the gray and gold uniform.  The Cavaliers throw it back to 1994 with their City Edition uniforms. The orange and blue are similar to the colors worn by the team when they returned to downtown Cleveland.  The Heat had one of the more popular City Edition uniforms in 2017-18 with their \u201cVice\u201d uniform look, albeit with a new name. Called the \u201c Vice Nights\u201d uniform by the team, the new look features the classic Heat silhouette from 1988 colored in laser fuchsia and blue gale. It is meant to serve as a homage to both the history of the team and the city in the 1980s.  Miami will wear its \u201cVice Nights\u201d look 15 times this season, with the first game coming on Nov. 9 against the Indiana Pacers. The Grizzlies\u2019 City Edition uniform pays homage to the city\u2019s tradition as a destination for music, wrestling and basketball. The \u2018Main Event\u2019 uniform will be worn by the Grizzlies for six games this season.  A blaze of red highlights the Blazers new City Edition uniforms .  With a nod to their MECCA era that represented Milwaukee to many and keyed one of the team\u2019s most successful eras, the Bucks unveiled their City Edition uniforms for 2018-19. A tasteful combination of yellow, blue and green mark the Bucks\u2019 new uniforms this season.  Milwaukee is slated to play in its City Edition uniforms 12 times this season, with the first game coming on Nov. 19 at home against the Denver Nuggets. Denver opted to throw back to the uniforms the team wore from 1981-82 to 1992-93, famous for their \u201crainbow skyline\u201d popularized by the teams of Alex English, Fat Lever and other early 1980s Nuggets icons.  Per the Nuggets , the team will wear the City Edition uniforms seven times this season, with the first game coming on Nov. 13. The Wizards made a pair of announcements on Nov. 2 with their jerseys in mind. First, they revealed their new jersey sponsor, the insurance company Geico. Second, they revealed their City Edition uniforms, which is designed to pay tribute to an iconic area of Washington, D.C. \u2014 the National Mall.  Here\u2019s more from the Wizards\u2019 website about the City Edition uniforms : The Wizards plan to wear the City Edition uniforms 19 times this season, with the first game coming on Nov. 16 against the Brooklyn Nets. The Pistons will once again sport the \u201cMotor City\u201d look that has been in their uniform mix for several seasons. However, there are some changes to the colors in the uniform \u2014 specifically some bold, highway-like striping down the middle of the jersey. In addition, the City Edition uniforms have a black base with gray accents.  A music icon plays a key role in the Timberwolves\u2019 City Edition uniforms for 2018-19 as Prince serves as the inspiration for their new look. The team worked with Prince\u2019s estate, which incorporates multiple references to the legacy of Prince. From the font \u2014 which is reminiscent of the 1980s Prince era \u2014 to the tonal purple most closely associated with Prince, the uniform speaks of his legacy and bond with the state.  Here\u2019s more from the Wolves\u2019 release on the uniforms : The Wolves are set to wear the City Edition uniforms eight times this season, starting with a Nov. 16 home game against the Portland Trail Blazers. The Thunder have a City Edition look that honors the state\u2019s Native American heritage. The uniforms are turquoise, which represents the 11th anniversary stone and the native color of friendship. Oklahoma City is in the midst of its 11th season in the state. The \u201cOKC\u201d on the front of the jersey pays homage to the Four Corners as well.  Here\u2019s more from the Thunder\u2019s release on the uniforms : The Thunder plan to wear the uniforms at least six times at home this season, with the first date coming on Nov. 14 against the New York Knicks. The Nets are honoring cultural diversity, swagger and a Brooklyn icon with their new 2018-19 City Edition uniform.  The uniform\u2019s multi-color \u201cBrooklyn Camo\u201d pattern represents the cultural diversity in the borough, which is home to people of all races, religions, and ethnicities. The new uni also pays homage to Brooklyn icon Christopher \u201cBiggie\u201d Wallace with their Biggie-inspired jersey. The Philadelphia 76ers unveiled their 2018-19 City Edition uniform, presented in partnership with Official Jersey Patch Sponsor StubHub. The 2018-19 City Edition uniform celebrates Philadelphia\u2019s rich history of the challenger\u2019s mentality that inspired the \u201c Rocky \u201d and \u201c Creed \u201d films.

But so is the stuff between the highlights. Here are some things you may have missed from the last week (or so) of games \u2026 * * * Nov. 1: Nuggets at Cavs The Nikola Jokic-Gary Harris two-man game is fun to watch! But while everybody is focused on that midway through the third quarter in Cleveland, Paul Millsap sets weak-side back-screen to free up Torrey Craig for a timely cut to the basket. This appears to be an action that Millsap ad libs into the play rather than standing still and waiting for something to happen. Nov. 2: Pacers at Bulls Bulls center Wendell Carter Jr. leads all rookies with two blocks per game and ranks second with 7.9 rebounds per game . But Carter also ranks fifth among first-year players with 2.5 assists per contest . And he\u2019s not just handing the ball off to the Bulls\u2019 guards, either. Here are are a couple of nice reads from Carter after catching a pass on a pick-and-roll against the Pacers last Friday \u2026 Rolling to the basket, making a catch, and then finding an open teammate when the defense comes to help is advanced stuff for a 19-year-old. Darnell Mayberry of The Athletic had an extensive film study on Carter\u2019s all-around skills earlier this week. Nov. 5: Rockets at Pacers The Houston Rockets probably switch as liberally as any other team on defense. And they\u2019re fine with James Harden having to guard opposing big men in the post. They\u2019re not so fine with Chris Paul having to do the same. Last season, while Harden allowed just 0.73 points per possession on post-ups (the 18th best mark among 126 players who defended at least 50), Paul allowed 1.01 (the 12th worst mark among the same group), according to Synergy play-type tracking. In Indiana on Monday, there were multiple times when Paul got switched onto Domantas Sabonis, and the Rockets did their best to replace Paul with a bigger defender when Sabonis took the point guard down to the low block. On the first two possessions below, Carmelo Anthony recognizes the mismatch before an entry pass to Sabonis can even be made and is quick to replace Paul in the post, with Paul retreating to the weak side and finding another Pacer to guard. On the third possession though, P.J. Tucker is a little slower to replace Paul in the post, Paul doesn\u2019t identify his new matchup right away, and the Pacers find an open Victor Oladipo before Paul can recover out to the shooter. Nov. 5: Grizzlies at Warriors In Oakland on Monday, the Grizzlies were able to get rookie Jaren Jackson Jr. a pair of catches close to the basket via paint screens from their guards. The Grizzlies\u2019 starting lineup has scored a brutal 84 points per 100 possessions, the worst mark among 44 lineups that have played at least 50 minutes together . But Jackson has shot 68 percent in the restricted area, and getting him a couple of easy looks is important. Nov. 7: Pistons at Magic This is a cool screen-the-screener play from the Pistons to get a pair of wide-open corner 3-pointers for Glenn Robinson III in Orlando on Wednesday \u2026 Robinson sets a screen for Blake Griffin, who then sets a screen for Reggie Jackson on the side of the floor. And as Griffin sets that screen, Robinson quickly escapes to the weak side. His defender (Evan Fournier) takes a second to help in the Jackson\/Griffin action and has no chance of recovering to Robinson by the time the Pistons get it to him in the weak-side corner. Alas, Robinson missed both open looks and is just 1-for-7 on corner 3-pointers this season, having missed another wide open look from the left corner with the game on the line against Miami on Monday. * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

Sometimes it\u2019s a transcendent individual season, one that doesn\u2019t need the assistance of a championship-caliber team effort to bolster the case ( see Russell Westbrook\u2019s win in 2017 ). Other times, it\u2019s a spectacular individual season combined with a best-in-show regular season from a team that inspires voters to cast their ballots for the player leading that charge ( see James Harden\u2019s romp to the finish line last season). And on those rare occasions when a otherworldly, all-time great individual season is paired with the greatest regular season in NBA history, you get a unicorn effort (see Stephen Curry\u2019s unanimous win in 2016 , when the Golden State Warriors finished 73-9). It\u2019s unclear right now just what type of season Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Milwaukee Bucks are in the midst of crafting. And they\u2019ve had a monster start in coach Mike Budenholzer\u2019s first season at the helm \u2026 but they\u2019re not necessarily on some record pace. What isn\u2019t up for debate, though, is Antetokounmpo\u2019s or the Bucks\u2019 readiness for prime time. They\u2019ve made that abundantly clear through the first 11 games of this season, serving notice that they are indeed prepared to take that next step. Budenholzer\u2019s reconstitution of the Bucks\u2019 collective DNA, with \u201cThe Greek Freak\u201d as the fuel cell for this revival, has the entire league on notice. And that includes the two-time defending champion Golden State Warriors, who allowed the second-most points of the Steve Kerr era in Thursday night\u2019s 134-111 rout at Oracle Arena. They pounded the Warriors inside, outscoring them 84-34 in the paint, and have shown themselves to be more than the one-man-band they played like far too often before Budenholzer showed up. \u201cI think teams are starting to take notice and realize we\u2019re not the Bucks that we were when I first got here six years ago,\u201d Bucks small forward Khris Middleton told ESPN after the game . \u201cWe\u2019re a totally different team even from last year.\u201d Antetokounmpo is certainly the same monster he was a season ago, only with another year of polish and a fresh set of directions from Budenholzer on how to attack the opposition and ultimately impose his will on the game each and every night. That\u2019s the main reason he\u2019s moved into the top spot of this week\u2019s Kia Race to the MVP Ladder. He\u2019s spent plenty of time on the list the past two seasons, but usually outside of the top five due to the Bucks\u2019 lack of team success. But with that shored up now with the new look provided by Budenholzer, the Greek Freak is free to sort through the different blueprints that could lead him to the finish line in this marathon. * * * The top five in the Week 1 edition of the 2018-19 Kia Race to the MVP Ladder: * * * Last week:  No. 3 Season stats:  25.6 points, 12.9 rebounds, 5.7 assists, 1.3 blocks Antetokounmpo is living up to his \u201cGreek Freak\u201d persona on a nightly basis, filling up the stats sheet and collecting jaw-dropping highlight plays at every turn. The difference this season is that his work is coming during a renaissance under first-year coach Mike Budenholzer, whose changes have worked wonders for both his best player and the roster at large. Look no further than the Bucks\u2019 (somewhat) surprising rout of the Golden State Warriors Thursday night at Oracle Arena. Antetokounmpo led the way with 24 points, nine rebounds, four assists, two blocks and two steals as the Bucks snapped the Warriors\u2019 eight-game win streak on a night that saw Warriors star Stephen Curry leave the game early with an adductor injury . It wasn\u2019t the Bucks\u2019 only statement win during this early stretch of the season but it was easily their biggest to date, sending a message to the rest of the league that what they\u2019ve seen so far from Antetokounmpo and his crew is very real. Last week:  No. 1 Season stats:  29.5 point, 6.1 assists, 5.0 rebounds That collective gasp you heard late Thursday night was Warriors Nation reacting to the announcement that Curry, after just 26 minutes , was done for the night after suffering a groin injury. An assortment of injuries are the only thing that has slowed Curry down in recent seasons. The Warriors have been able to manage without Curry in the past and will no doubt be able to do so this time around (if that\u2019s needed). But the two-time Kia MVP was off to a raucous start to this season and didn\u2019t need anything getting in the way of what had the makings of yet another monster MVP campaign. The Warriors certainly felt his absence down the stretch against the Bucks, who limited Curry to just 10 points on 5-for-14 shooting (0-for-4 on 3-pointers) before he exited the floor for the locker room. Meanwhile, the Warriors can only wait for word from the medical staff on Curry\u2019s situation. Last week:  No. 2 Season stats:  26.0 points, 8.0 rebounds, 3.3 assists If this NBA-best 11-1 start to the season has seen Leonard operating at half speed as he gets comfortable in coach Nick Nurse\u2019s system \u2014 as Leonard claimed after Wednesday\u2019s win against the Sacramento Kings \u2014 it\u2019s scary to think about just how good the Raptors will be when Leonard finally finds his groove. As it stands, Leonard has operated beautifully in the Raptors\u2019 engine this season and All-Star point guard Kyle Lowry is making an MVP case of his own. The Raptors\u2019 depth at every position has allowed them to maintain an elite level of play with or without Leonard on the floor so far this season. (Toronto easily handled the Los Angeles Lakers and Utah Jazz on their current road trip without Leonard in the mix because of a foot injury). He returned to the lineup in the win in Sacramento with an efficient 25 points, 11 rebounds and two assists. The true beauty of his fit with the Raptors is that he\u2019s been able to fit in seamlessly without even knowing the ins and outs of the system yet. Last week:  No. 5 Season stats:  26.6 points, 5.3 assists, 5.0 rebounds The Trail Blazers have won three straight games and six of their last seven riding the wave that Lillard and his backcourt mate, C.J. McCollum, have created with their attacking style early this season. The Blazers have done something that\u2019s often hard to do in this league: improve dramatically without an infusion of star talent. Much of what\u2019s working for them right now is the comfort that continuity provides. Without leaders like Lillard and McCollum, a youngster like Zach Collins might not be empowered to contribute the way he has in his second season. But with the tone being set in the offseason, there is no confusion about the roles every Blazer has. Lillard remains the true catalyst, the alpha if you will, and the man charged with finishing games the way he did Thursday night at Moda Center against the LA Clippers . That bench boost will come in handy when the Boston Celtics come to town Sunday night for a duel between two of the game\u2019s best finishers in Lillard and Kyrie Irving. Last week:  No. 4 Season stats:  24.4 points, 12.0 rebounds, 4.6 assists, 3.3 blocks Davis should be the easiest player in the league to evaluate on a game-by-game basis because of how the Pelicans\u2019 bottom line rests on him. And it\u2019s not his performance that dictates their fortunes, because he\u2019s operating at the highest level on the regular. It\u2019s his availability that is the true measure for the Pelicans. They lost six straight games after a 4-0 start to this season, a slide that coincided with an elbow sprain that cost Davis three games and sapped the entire group of much of that early energy. Davis turned in a 32-point, 15-rebound, four-block masterpiece in Wednesday\u2019s win over Chicago, snapping that losing streak and snapping out of an individual funk on the same night. Davis missed his first five shots against the Bulls before going on a tear and making eight straight to post his first 30-point game since Oct. 23. The Pelicans were desperate for a win in their first game back home after an ugly 0-5 road trip. If you subscribe to the theory that the true gauge for a player\u2019s value to his team is how they fare without him or when he\u2019s at something less than full strength, Davis has to be on any short list of the most valuable player candidates in this league. * * * 6.

Here\u2019s more from the Magic\u2019s release on the uniforms: The Magic plan to wear the uniforms Nov. 14, when they host the Philadelphia 76ers, and will wear them other dates throughout the season. The Philadelphia 76ers unveiled their 2018-19 City Edition uniform, presented in partnership with Official Jersey Patch Sponsor StubHub.

Some are updates of what teams wore a season ago, while others are a completely new look. Here\u2019s what teams in the Eastern Conference will be sporting on City Edition nights this season \u2026 * City Edition uniforms: Eastern Conference teams * * * The Mavericks chose to focus this year\u2019s City Edition uniform around a \u201cTrue Maverick\u201d theme, meant to represent the rebirth of the franchise around a new roster featuring prize rookie Luka Doncic.  Denver opted to throw back to the uniforms the team wore from 1981-82 to 1992-93, famous for their \u201crainbow skyline\u201d popularized by the teams of Alex English, Fat Lever and other early 1980s Nuggets icons.  Per the Nuggets , the team will wear the City Edition uniforms seven times this season, with the first game coming on Nov. 13. For the first time in their history, the LA Clippers will embrace the \u201cLA\u201d in their name on their jerseys. The \u201cLA\u201d wordmark will be featured on a Clippers jersey and is inspired by the iconic 1984 Olympic Games\u2019 \u201cStars in Motion\u201d logo. The five stars on each side of the jersey represent the five Olympic Rings and longtime \u201cvoice of the Clippers\u201d Ralph Lawler will have his signature stitched into the bottom left corner of the jersey.  The Clippers plan to wear their City Edition uniform six times this season. As one of the most iconic players in both NBA and team history, Magic Johnson has lent his skill to the Lakers\u2019 City Edition uniforms. Per the Lakers : \u201cThrough his electrifying playmaking and personality, Magic Johnson exemplified what it meant to be a Laker during the Showtime era. The NBA legend lends his magic touch and eye for detail to Nike to help create the latest Lakers City Edition jersey.  The Grizzlies\u2019 City Edition uniform pays homage to the city\u2019s tradition as a destination for music, wrestling and basketball. The \u2018Main Event\u2019 uniform will be worn by the Grizzlies for six games this season.  A music icon plays a key role in the Timberwolves\u2019 City Edition uniforms for 2018-19 as Prince serves as the inspiration for their new look. The team worked with Prince\u2019s estate, which incorporates multiple references to the legacy of Prince. From the font \u2014 which is reminiscent of the 1980s Prince era \u2014 to the tonal purple most closely associated with Prince, the uniform speaks of his legacy and bond with the state.  Here\u2019s more from the Wolves\u2019 release on the uniforms : The Wolves are set to wear the City Edition uniforms eight times this season, starting with a Nov. 16 home game against the Portland Trail Blazers. Few cities have as much color and personality as New Orleans. The Pelicans are trying to capture that notion with their City Edition uniforms, which feature a vibrant mix of Mardi Gras colors: purple, green and gold.  Several aspects of New Orleans culture are reflected in the uniforms, including the Pelicans \u201cFleur-De-Lis\u201d logo in the colors purple, green and gold on the shorts. Additionally, a flap on the bottom of both legs of the shorts displays a hidden \u201cComedy Tragedy\u201d Mardi Gras mask. The Thunder have a City Edition look that honors the state\u2019s Native American heritage. The uniforms are turquoise, which represents the 11th anniversary stone and the native color of friendship. Oklahoma City is in the midst of its 11th season in the state. The \u201cOKC\u201d on the front of the jersey pays homage to the Four Corners as well.  Here\u2019s more from the Thunder\u2019s release on the uniforms : The Thunder plan to wear the uniforms at least six times at home this season, with the first date coming on Nov. 14 against the New York Knicks. A blaze of red highlights the Blazers new City Edition uniforms .  From the court to the uniforms, the City Edition look the Kings sport in 2018-19 is all about one look. Sacramento is going with a \u201cSactown\u201d look (which is splashed across the chest of the uniforms) in a baby blue and red color scheme that has been a part of the franchise\u2019s history for decades.  In addition to the City Edition uniforms, the team will also have a City Edition-inspired court as well. It will feature a \u201cSactown\u201d baby blue hardwood that will be utilized for select games.

Following a 98-80 drubbing Thursday in Oklahoma City to the Russell Westbrook-less Thunder, D\u2019Antoni sees another issue with the Rockets: their offense. \u201cOur offense is anemic,\u201d D\u2019Antoni told reporters after the loss . \u201cI mean, it\u2019s bad. I think sometimes we think we have to shut the other team out. We can\u2019t. We\u2019ve been holding everybody under 100. \u201cWe start the game off and a couple, three layups we\u2019re missing, and foul shots. That adds up. We have to start imposing our will and get our swagger. A lot of it is mental energy.\u201d In last night\u2019s loss, the Rockets scored were down by 15 points at halftime and scored less than 25 points in three of the four quarters . That performance was on par for Houston this season, as it ranks 27th in points per game (102.8) \u2014 one of many troubling offensive numbers for the Rockets this season. In 2017-18, Houston ranked second in points (112.4 ppg), 15th in field goal percentage (46 percent) and 14th in 3-point percentage (36.2 percent). This season, Houston is last in field goal percentage (42.1) and 25th in 3-point percentage (32.7). In terms of advanced stats, the Rockets were No. 1 in offensive rating , No. 1 in net rating and No. 2 in both effective field goal percentage and true shooting percentage last season. This season, Houston is 26th in offensive rating , 23rd in net rating , 24th in effective field goal percentage and 28th in true shooting percentage . Things looked up a bit for the Rockets last weekend as they pieced together a three-game win streak from Nov. 2-5. This loss to Oklahoma City not only ended that streak, but raised red flags as Houston displayed some traits from the team\u2019s 1-5 start. Westbrook missed the game as he recovers from a sprained left ankle , but the Thunder had no problem against the Rockets without their top player. That\u2019s because Houston couldn\u2019t make a shot and several key players were out of rhythm. Carmelo Anthony, Chris Paul, James Harden and James Ennis combined to shoot 14-for-48 (29.2 percent) in the defeat Thursday. Anthony shot 1-for-11 overall in his first game back against the team he played for in 2017-18. \u201cI missed them,\u201d Anthony said when asked about his poor shooting night. \u201cAt the end of the day, I missed them. I missed those looks, some open shots. As a team, we didn\u2019t shoot the ball well, extremely poor. I think that kind of got to us a little bit. Our energy, our spirit was down because of that.\u201d Paul is in the midst of a career-worst season shooting-wise, with a 39.3 field goal percentage and his 16.8 ppg his lowest mark since 2012-13. Still, he saw an easy solution to Houston\u2019s woes. \u201cMan, part of it has probably gotta be, I ain\u2019t made no shots,\u201d Paul said postgame . \u201cI mean, that\u2019ll probably help if you see some go through.\u201d The Rockets\u2019 next game is tomorrow night as they visit the San Antonio Spurs ( 8:30 ET, NBA TV ).

Curry was having a tough night (10 points on 5-for-14 shooting) before straining his left adductor, but it was the absence of Green\u2019s physical defense that allowed Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Bucks to pull away in the second quarter. Jordan Bell, Kevon Looney and Kevin Durant had no luck stopping Antetokounmpo, and Green could only watch from the bench, mouth agape. Antetokounmpo had 19 points, seven rebounds, three assists, a steal and a block by halftime as the Bucks led 64-51 at the break. He finished with 24 points and nine rebounds in just 26 minutes. \u201cWe\u2019re never as good without Draymond,\u201d Warriors coach Steve Kerr said before the game. Kerr was right. In handing Golden State its first home loss of the season, the Bucks (9-2) validated their fast start and in the process made the Warriors (10-2) look a little vulerable. Celtics pull off epic comeback  Coming off consecutive road losses, the Celtics came out flat in Phoenix. At one point, Boston missed 13 straight shots as the Suns built a 32-13 lead in the first quarter. Brad Stevens scrambled to make changes in the second half, starting Marcus Smart ahead of Jayson Tatum, who sat for the first nine minutes of the third quarter. The move energized the Celtics, who cut the Suns\u2019 lead from 20 points at the half, to 15 by the end of the third quarter, to a point with 7.3 seconds left. Then this happened: With the Suns fixated on Kyrie Irving, who scored 18 of his 39 points in the fourth quarter, the All-Star point guard split two defenders with a crisp pass to Morris, who forced overtime with a 3-pointer. It was all Boston in overtime, as the Celtics outscored the Suns 16-9 to win 116-109 . Celtics fans rejoiced, including Hall of Famer Bill Russell, who was clearly watching the TNT broadcast. Thunder keep rolling  Paul George stuffed the stat sheet with 20 points, 11 rebounds, six assists and six steals, and the Thunder beat the Rockets 98-80 without Russell Westbrook for their seventh straight victory. Westbrook missed his second straight game with a sprained left ankle. He was spotted walking into Chesapeake Energy Arena without a limp and what can only be described as a Cliff Huxtable sweater. Oklahoma City\u2019s winning streak also includes victories over the Suns, Clippers, Hornets, Wizards, Pelicans and Cavs. While that might not be a murderer\u2019s row, the Thunder have won their last seven games by an average of 12.1 points. As usual, defense has been key for the Thunder, who lead the league in steals and turnovers. The 80 points is the lowest total for the Rockets since Feb. 6, 2018 and the lowest since Mike D\u2019Antoni took over. The Warriors allowed 134 points, most at Oracle in regulation since March 15, 2009 vs. the Suns (154 points)."},{"id":37519,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-george-hill-miss-two-weeks-shoulder-sp","date":"2018-11-09","title":"Cavs' Hill to miss 2 weeks with shoulder sprain","content":" CLEVELAND (AP) \u2014 The Cavaliers are losing games and players at an alarming rate. Starting point guard George Hill could miss two weeks with a sprained right shoulder, the latest setback for the Cavs, who have won just one game and are expected to be without All-Star forward Kevin Love for at least another five weeks following foot surgery. Cleveland is also missing forward Sam Dekker, who sprained his ankle and is out for a month. Hill was a late scratch before Wednesday night\u2019s loss to Oklahoma City. The 32-year-old, who hurt his shoulder on the final possession of Monday\u2019s loss in Orlando, went through his usual pregame workout, but was experiencing pain in his shoulder and couldn\u2019t play against the Thunder. Further medical tests performed Thursday revealed the sprain. Hill\u2019s setback is yet another obstacle for the Cavs, who are an NBA-worst 1-10 and recently fired coach Tyronn Lue. Cleveland\u2019s had other issues in its first season since LeBron James bolted as a free agent after leading the Cavs to four straight Finals. Cavs forward Cedi Osman left Wednesday\u2019s game with lower back spasms, and the team is hoping rest will help and that he\u2019ll play Saturday in Chicago. One possible positive with Hill\u2019s injury is that rookie Collin Sexton will get more playing time. The No. 8 overall pick made his first career start against the Thunder and finished with a season-high 15 points, two rebounds and an assist in 42 minutes. Cleveland coach Larry Drew has urged his veterans to be patient with Sexton while he develops. \u201cAs I told a couple of the guys,\u201d Drew said. \u201cHey, you were 19 at one point. To step up to this level, I\u2019m sure you would\u2019ve been in a situation where you were making mistakes too.\u2019 In order for Collin to learn, he\u2019s going to have to make mistakes.

Thunder fans normally practice Midwestern hospitality to opposing players but they cut loose against the former Kia MVP who dumped them for the Warriors. When Carmelo Anthony makes his return to OKC on Thursday, there\u2019s a good chance of silence, which in some ways will be just as insulting, maybe more. Fans don\u2019t boo and hiss at players they don\u2019t miss all that much, players who didn\u2019t leave many memories, players they barely knew. And that will be yet another sign of reality for \u2018Melo. The reaction that superstars create and earn, good and bad, no longer follows him. He\u2019s left to salvage what\u2019s left of a Hall of Fame career as part of the supporting cast in Houston where he doesn\u2019t get his number called in the clutch. Where he doesn\u2019t take the most shots. Where the fortunes of the Rockets don\u2019t rise or fall drastically with him. The twilight can be a humbling and often haunting place for most former stars and \u2018Melo isn\u2019t an exception. The difference between OKC, where he spent one uncomfortable season coping with his basketball mortality, and Houston is he has finally come to grips with this new normal. \u201cI\u2019m just doing what I can,\u201d Anthony said. \u201cWhatever this team needs. The only thing I can really do is what they ask me to do.\u201d During \u2018Melo\u2019s prime when he was with the Nuggets and the Knicks, there was no conforming or conceding: \u201cNo chance,\u201d he said. But there was no need for that, either. With a textbook jumper and a green light, \u2018Melo was good for 25, 30 points a night. Those systems and those teams depended heavily on a player who could score anywhere on the floor and who devoured defenders one-on-one. The downshift began in his final season with the Knicks, where knee issues combined with the smashing arrival of rookie Kristaps Porzingis conspired to respectfully nudge Anthony to the side. Then the process gained speed in OKC, where he grumbled about his reduced role, wondered about his future and finally crashed in the playoffs where he spent time on the bench in the fourth quarter. This was all new to \u2018Melo, and shocking. And what did that experience do for him? \u201cIt taught me that you\u2019ve got to be willing to sacrifice,\u201d Anthony said. He admits he wrestled with that in OKC \u2014 still does, even now with the Rockets, although not as much. The tough part about players with \u2018Melo\u2019s body of work is this: When the skills fade, the ego doesn\u2019t. The belief that he can isolate on his man and score at will and the desire for the ball remains strong at age 34, almost impossibly so, stubbornly so. In retrospect, \u2018Melo\u2019s lone season with the Thunder was destined to be an unhappy one. He never wanted to leave New York, where he keeps a home, where he loved the lifestyle. He rented in OKC. And he came to the Thunder after a pair of knee surgeries and after 13 years in the NBA. Also: There was Russell Westbrook. As a ball-dominant point guard, it was Westbrook who decided who gets what shot, not Anthony. Playing with Westbrook was easier for Paul George, someone with a milder ego and who didn\u2019t need plenty of shots and could impact a game in other ways such as defense. \u2018Melo needed to score; that\u2019s what he does. Or did, anyway. And \u2018Melo never had a teammate like that in his life \u2014 high school, college or NBA. What\u2019s more, coach Billy Donovan wanted \u2018Melo out of the post (keeping the lane clear for Westbrook) and stationed outside the 3-point line. Donovan made \u2018Melo a catch-and-shooter, which he was not. In the past, Anthony\u2019s buckets came along the baseline and at the rim and on pull-up jumpers not always from deep. In his greatest seasons, \u2018Melo never made more than two 3-pointers per game on average. For the most part, he good-soldiered his way through the season although his body language didn\u2019t lie. The Thunder lurched along, reached the playoffs and then were erased by the Jazz. Annoyed at being benched in that series, \u2018Melo fed the perception, true or not, that he wasn\u2019t willing to change for the team\u2019s sake. In reality, he felt his new role wasn\u2019t helping him or the team, but no one wanted to hear or believe that. \u201cI wasn\u2019t clear on what I needed to do,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was confusing to me.\u201d So he arrives in Houston this season by way of the Hawks, who bought out his contract after a trade with OKC, and what happens? \u2018Melo is the third option, just like in OKC, and is coming off the bench, which he refused to do in OKC. Time humbles everyone. Six years ago \u2018Melo averaged 28 points and took 22 shots a night. Now he\u2019s down to 14 and 12 . And he\u2019s checking into games at the eight-minute mark of the first quarter. And he\u2019s not always on the floor late in the fourth. If there\u2019s any consolation, he\u2019s with Chris Paul, his friend, and given a fresh start by coach Mike D\u2019Antoni despite the sometimes static-filled relationship they had in New York when D\u2019Antoni coached the Knicks. \u201cI\u2019m clear about what my role is on this team and how effective I\u2019ve got to be,\u201d Anthony said. \u201cBut it\u2019s still a challenge for me as well. A challenge to play differently than I\u2019ve played in the past, to go from having the ball to relying on other guys to get you the ball, picking your spots, being ready. Sometimes you don\u2019t get the ball 4-5 times down the court, and when you do, you got to be ready to shoot it.\u201d It\u2019s all new. Still new to me. Anthony on coming off the bench As for coming off the bench: \u201cThat\u2019s a big adjustment. Its\u2019 not like I can get my own rhythm. You got to be ready from the get-go, be ready to go as soon as you get on the court. It\u2019s eight minutes and the flow of the game has already been established. Sometimes you may not have it.\u201d He adds: \u201cIt\u2019s all new. Still new to me.\u201d The tough part is \u2018Melo replaced Trevor Ariza on the wing, and Ariza was superior defensively. With the rangy and athletic Ariza last season, the Rockets ranked seventh last season on defense and it was a main reason they grabbed the top seed in the West. Now they\u2019re down to 21st \u2014 coincidence? \u2014 and when \u2018Melo\u2019s on the floor, the Rockets allow 114 points per 100 possessions, compared to 98 when he\u2019s off. Therefore, unless he\u2019s putting up points, \u2018Melo\u2019s a risk. It\u2019s not the way he visioned himself winding down a career where, at one point during a decade-long stretch, he was one of the game\u2019s top offensive players, someone who routinely drew double teams. But this sudden cold splash hits everyone who isn\u2019t willing to see it coming. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be mentally strong to fight through it, and at the end of the day, you just want to be a positive asset to this team and help us win,\u201d he said.

The future Hall of Famer has a front-row seat for Doncic\u2019s coming-out campaign and says the \u201csky\u2019s the limit\u201d for the Slovenian who plays with \u201cno fear\u201d. \u201cI didn\u2019t have that confidence, that swag, when I got in the league,\u201d Nowitzki told Marc Stein of the New York Times in a recent Q&A . \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure if I was going to make it in this league. This guy comes here basically knowing he\u2019s going to make it in the league. And that\u2019s how he carries himself on the court. No fear. It\u2019s just completely different.\u201d Nowitzki went on to say any comparisons between the two fade thanks to Doncic\u2019s upbringing and changes in the league\u2019s style of play since he came from Germany in 1998. * * * Last week: 1st Doncic had one of his better games Tuesday night, scoring 23 points on 9-for-16 shooting to help the Mavs beat the Wizards 119-100 and end a six-game losing streak. After the game, Wizards coach Scott Brooks had high praise for the young rising star. \u201cEvery game, you look at him and say, \u2018Are you sure this guy is only 19?\u2019\u201d Brooks said . \u201cI don\u2019t look at him as a young player. He\u2019s a legitimate NBA player who is going to be a superstar.\u201d The scary thing is that it seems like Doncic could be doing even more, if the Mavs would play him on the ball more and utilize his playmaking ability. Sure, he\u2019s still struggling with turnovers (4.2 per game), but there are times when Doncic gets lost on offense while Dennis Smith Jr. and Harrison Barnes create for themselves. Last week: Just missed cut After a somewhat slow start to the season, Carter is starting to produce how we thought he would when the Bulls grabbed him with the No. 7 pick in the Draft. Over his last five games, the long big man from Duke is averaging 15.6 points, 10.6 rebounds, 2.6 blocks and 1.4 steals . He had his breakout performance in a close loss to the Nuggets, putting up a balanced statline of 25 points, eight rebounds, five assists, three blocks and three steals. Carter has scored in double-digits in his last seven games, with four double-doubles in that span. But most impressive is the 19-year-old center\u2019s work on the defensive end, as he\u2019s now leading rookies in blocks on the season (2.0) and seventh in steals (0.8). Carter might not be able to keep up this pace, but for now, he\u2019s earned this top spot with a week of consistent play that trumps the up-and-down performances of Ayton and Young. Last week: 3rd Trae Young is a tough rookie to figure out. After Young\u2019s 24-point, 15-assist, six-rebound outburst Saturday in a 123-118 win over the Heat , I was ready to bump him up to the No. 2 spot. It was the kind of performance that makes you forget about the duds that have been more common. For example, two nights earlier Young had eight turnovers while scoring 14 points in the Hawks\u2019 embarrassing 146-115 loss to the Kings . And Young followed his big game by going 1-for-14 from 3-point land in a pair of losses. The most disheartening stat, though, for me is this: Young has just four steals total through 11 games and hasn\u2019t had a single steal in the last six games. For a point guard playing 30.9 minutes per game, that\u2019s a surprising number, and doesn\u2019t reflect well on Young\u2019s effort on the defensive end. Last week: 2nd At first glance, Ayton\u2019s 15-point, 13-rebound showing Tuesday against the Nets doesn\u2019t look too bad. But the 7-footer was just 6-for-17 from the field and struggled all night as Brooklyn dared him to take outside shots, often times sagging completely, almost daring him to shoot. A frustrated Ayton vowed that fans who booed the effort would see a more aggressive side moving forward. \u201cThe only thing you can possibly do is just try to win. That\u2019s just our mentality. Win. Win. Win. I was speaking to [Devin Booker], I\u2019m like we need to take over. Let\u2019s start taking over. Let\u2019s really do it. We\u2019re not in training camp anymore Let\u2019s really show the world what we can do.\u201d Last week: Just missed cut The Grizzlies have been a pleasant surprise, jumping out to a 6-4 record, and Jackson has been a big reason. The 6-foot-11 center has been an anchor in the middle and at just 19 years old, has fans in Memphis excited about the future. In his last two games Jackson has seen his minutes increase, and he\u2019s responded with big numbers. In Monday\u2019s 117-101 loss at Golden State , the Michigan State product had 15 points, six rebounds and five blocks. Two nights later, Jackson was instrumental in Memphis\u2019 89-87 win over Denver , scoring 20 points with seven blocks, three steal and three blocks while holding Nikola Jokic to four points on just one field-goal attempt. Jackson will keep himself in the Rookie of the Year discussion with his defense, and it\u2019s looking like coach J.B. Bickerstaff is riding with his young center, playing him 30-plus minutes in the last two games. Allonzo Trier, New York Knicks Over his last six games, Trier is averaging 15.8 points on 58.9 percent shooting. The undrafted rookie out of Arizona has become a sensation, but he\u2019s not doing much else besides score at this point, and most of his points are coming in iso situations. Still, Trier is proving he belongs in the NBA and will continue to be trusted down the stretch if he continues to pull off sick moves like this one in Wednesday\u2019s 112-107 win in Atlanta . Marvin Bagley III, Sacramento Kings Bagley is quietly putting up decent numbers in Sacramento as he\u2019s currently fourth among rookies in scoring (12.8 ppg), rebounding (6.5 rpg) and blocks (1.1 bpg). Landry Shamet, Philadelphia 76ers The Sixers seem to have found a gem in the No. 26 pick in the Draft. Shamet has become a valuable rotation piece behind JJ Redick, averaging 7.8 points on the season and 12.0 points over his last four games on 55.2 percent shooting (45.5 on 3s) Mo Bamba, Orlando Magic Bamba had a nice night in the Magic\u2019s 117-110 win over the Spurs on Sunday, tallying 12 points and 11 rebounds for his first double-double of his career. Bamba\u2019s hanging around here thanks to his energy off the bench, but he could find himself on the outside soon with other rookies Collin Sexton, Cleveland Cavaliers Sexton got the first start of his career Wednesday, playing 42 minutes in the Cavs\u2019 95-86 loss to the Thunder . Sexton put up 15 points on 7-for-14 shooting, but only had one assist while filling in for the injured George Hill. * * * ( All stats through Wednesday, Nov. 7 ) Send any questions or comments to my email or find me on Twitter @drewpackham .

He became the first player in franchise history to record eight blocks in a half. The 7-foot center finished with 29 points, 20 rebounds and nine blocks, a line no player has posted since Hakeem Olajuwon in Dec. 1989 . He was everywhere against San Antonio, disrupting shots and immediately running the floor to feast on the other end. His offense provided a lift to a team that was without Goran Dragic and Dwyane Wade, while his defense wreaked havoc and helped hold the Spurs to a season-low 88 points. \u201cYou seen guys, they stopped shooting, they stopped shooting around me,\u201d Whiteside said on Spurs players feeling his impact in the paint. \u201cThey started kicking it out to the 3. And guys were just turning the ball over just to keep me from blocking their shots.\u201d Indeed they were. Here\u2019s an example of the Spurs turning it over in the fourth quarter due to Whiteside\u2019s presence. He was effective and also essential to Miami earning its first victory over San Antonio since 2014. It seemed like 2011 all over again. LeBron James was wearing a headband . Tyson Chandler was giving his team extra opportunities with classic  tip outs . And Derrick Rose scored over 30 points just for Tom Thibodeau\u2019s squad to fall short to a James-lead team. We sure it\u2019s the right year? Let\u2019s take a brief moment to look at some of the mesmerizing posters from Wednesday, please. We saw Donovan Mitchell take flight in the throwback Jazz threads during last year\u2019s Slam Dunk competition. He\u2019s now donning the fresh uniform in live action and making actual defenders his props. Andre Drummond should consider making Domantas Sabonis his real estate agent. Problem solved. All in Rodney\u2019s neighborhood. Aaron Gordon goes full \u201cMailman\u201d to the delight of the Jazz . LeBron James brings the \u201cStatue of Liberty\u201d to Los Angeles. Rookie Allonzo Trier sends the veteran Hawk flying. Enes Kanter said earlier this year he plans to seriously consider a move to the WWE once his career is over. He clearly looks well-prepared. \u201cObviously, I was in the air, and then I flipped,\u201d Kanter said after the game. \u201cI\u2019m OK right now. I\u2019m trying to get ready for my next WWE career. I\u2019m fine\u2026 I watch a lot of wrestling so I know how to duck. I know how to save my neck.\u201d Nothing better than a jersey swap between blood bros. Nothing crazier than both of them having the same stat line against each other. Both Jrue and Justin Holiday scored exactly 17 points on exactly 6-for-16 shooting in their first clash of the season.

White is expected to ease his way back into NBA action, building minutes game by game.

Popovich told reporters today that he has been happy with the work Bryn Forbes has done as the fill-in starter during White\u2019s absence, writes Jeff McDonald of the San Antonio Express-News . \u201cIt worked out, because we needed it so far,\u201d Popovich said regarding Forbes\u2019 run as point guard. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to probably need him in some way, shape or form at that position.\u201d Forbes filled in solidly for the Spurs, averaging 12.7 points, 1.6 rebounds, 1.2 steals and 2.4 assists per game in 28.6 minutes per game. Veteran backup guard Patty Mills has also played well in an increased role, averaging 9.7 ppg while shooting 45.9 percent on 3-pointers.

Hey, James might wind up winning the 2017-18 Kia MVP award retroactively, given how sorely he is missed in The Land. That\u2019s a joke borrowed from social media, but this plummet by Cleveland is breathtaking and unfortunate. I thought that re-upping Kevin Love as their All-Star in residence, maintaining and fleshing out roles for the veteran supporting cast and adding the energy and freshness of rookie Collin Sexton would be enough to get the Cavs into one of the last two spots in the East. But this horrendous start is beyond even the pessimists\u2019 fears. Love\u2019s injury and surgery, the coaching change, J.R. Smith\u2019s spiral, Sexton\u2019s limited minutes and more have sucked the air out of Cleveland\u2019s season to this point. Tas Melas :  Real, and Cavs management wants it that way.  From my perspective, when Kevin Love went down with his toe injury , the organization decided to do a 180-degree turn from a postseason charge in hopes of keeping their top-10 protected pick this June (which is probably the smart move). At 1-9, and with no Love for at least the next five weeks, there\u2019s basically no chance at the playoffs. Shaun Powell :  That\u2019s as real as real can get. Not only are the Cavs headed back to the lottery, but they\u2019ll likely get the best odds of landing the No. 1 pick. Just for the sake of reference, their first rounder is top-10 protected from the Hawks, which means the Hawks aren\u2019t getting it this season. John Schuhmann :  As real as it gets. The Cavs are the worst team in the league in the standings, rank 29th statistically ( point differential per 100 possessions ), and appear to be right there with the Wolves and Wizards in regard to dysfunction. If they were going to have any chance of being a playoff team, they needed to be better than Atlanta, Brooklyn, Charlotte and Orlando. They\u2019re 1-4 against that group thus far, with three of the four losses coming by more than 15 points. If Kevin Love was healthy, this is not a playoff team. With Love out for an extended period, the Cavs are the favorite to finish last in the Eastern Conference.  Sekou Smith :  So real. The Cavaliers are headed back to the lottery with a golden ticket. I knew they\u2019d miss LeBron in this first season after his departure (don\u2019t his exes always?), but I wasn\u2019t expecting it to be as ugly as it\u2019s been. Tyronn Lue was the first casualty . Then Kevin Love goes down with an injury and J.R. Smith\u2019s desire to exit the premises hit at nearly the same time. At least we know Larry Drew is in as coach for the rest of the season. But the danger zone in Cleveland right now is that strange space they\u2019ve put young Collin Sexton in not even a full month into his first NBA season. A dysfunctional atmosphere is no place for a precocious rookie point guard you are hoping to be one of your young building blocks. I don\u2019t have a good feeling about what is going on in Cleveland right now."},{"id":37597,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-clippers-or-lakers-best-team-la","date":"2018-11-07","title":"Blogtable: Are Clippers better than Lakers this season?","content":" * * * Real or mirage: The Clippers, not the Lakers, are the best team in L.A. this season?  * * * Steve Aschburner :  Mirage . The Clippers are better at the moment, they have a lot of nice pieces, their team stats are solid on both sides. But they lack a tent-pole star, caught Houston twice in a down cycle and have yet to face the Warriors, the Raptors or the Bucks. The Lakers roster is seriously flawed, to no one\u2019s surprise, and their learning curve is steep. But if forced to pick which team will be better by the start of the playoffs, I\u2019m going with the Lakers (unless, say, the Clippers pick up Jimmy Butler for a stretch drive). Tas Melas :  A m irage, but this has been a pleasant surprise to start the season. I chalk up the Clippers\u2019 6-4 start to continuity and a couple key injuries to opponents. I chalk up the Lakers\u2019 4-6 start to zero continuity and a pretty tough schedule (and horrid perimeter defense). Familiarity is growing with the purple and gold and I see them ripping through the second 10-game portion of their sked. Shaun Powell :  That\u2019s a mirage, although no disrespect intended to the Clippers , who just like last season are playing better than most expected. But they don\u2019t have LeBron, and the Lakers haven\u2019t hit their stride yet, and we haven\u2019t reached the second week of November. John Schuhmann :  This race is too early to call. When you overhaul your team by adding LeBron James, you shouldn\u2019t expect to hit the ground running. The Lakers will be better in March than they are right now. Still, their defense, including James\u2019 effort on that end of the floor, is a concern. That the Clippers are one of the league\u2019s most improved defensive teams is a bit of a surprise, but they\u2019ve played five of their 10 games against the league\u2019s bottom-10 offenses. And overall, the 6-4 Clippers have played an easier schedule. They\u2019ve been more fortunate in regard to rest-advantage games and their 10 opponents having a cumulative record of 43-45 in other games, while the 4-6 Lakers\u2019 opponents have a cumulative record of 54-37 in other games. The Clips are about to play a tougher stretch (Portland, Milwaukee, Golden State and San Antonio), while the Lakers play just two of their next nine games against teams that currently have winning records.  Sekou Smith :  The Clippers can make that claim right now and it would be a legitimate statement. They have been the better team through the first 10 games of this season. Whether or not they will hold on to that distinction over the course of the next six months, however, remains to be seen. I think coach Doc Rivers does some of his best work when people are doubting him and his team. That said, the Lakers\u2019 ceiling is much higher this season, given all of the new faces they are incorporating and the continued growth and development of their youngsters. If the Clippers are in the playoff mix a month from now and the Lakers are still on the outside looking in, we should revisit this topic."},{"id":37594,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-stephen-curry-making-another-mvp-push","date":"2018-11-07","title":"Blogtable: Is Curry making another Kia MVP push?","content":" * * * Real or mirage: Stephen Curry is making another Kia MVP run this season?  * * * Steve Aschburner :  Real, but \u2026 Curry is making another MVP-worthy run, which means he\u2019ll deserve serious consideration on that 5-spot ballot by season\u2019s end, if he continues at this pace. Statistically, he\u2019s performing like a mirror image of his 2015-16 self, when he won that award unanimously (all 131 first-place votes). Two factors present possible challenges. First, Kevin Durant wasn\u2019t with Golden State that season, and Draymond Green and Klay Thompson hadn\u2019t fully established themselves. A lot of voters, myself included, weigh the help an All-Star player has on hand when casting our ballots. That\u2019s why LeBron sometimes slid down a few spots when teaming with Wade and Bosh in Miami or Irving and Love in Cleveland. The second factor is the competition. The No. 2 finisher behind Curry in 2015-16, Kawhi Leonard, averaged 21.2 points, 6.8 rebounds and 2.6 assists, won Kia Defensive Player of the Year and led his team to 67 victories. James went 25.3 ppg, 7.4 rpg and 6.8 apg, with 57 victories. Right now, though, Giannis Antetokounmpo is at 25.8 ppg, 13.3 rpg and 5.9 apg on a Bucks team on pace to win 66. Toronto\u2019s Kyle Lowry has been playing like vintage Steve Nash with the Raptors on pace to crash 70 victories. Arguably tougher field, at this early stage. Tas Melas :  Real, but unlikely. Steph is healthy, in his prime, and still improving. He is better than his Kia MVP seasons, but to overcome voters who think he isn\u2019t his team\u2019s best player or those who simply have voter\/Warriors fatigue, he\u2019s gonna have to do something special to win. Like Russell Westbrook and his triple-double average in 2017 , Curry has to do something historically good. He put up 50\/45\/90 shooting splits in 2016 when he won. Can he get to 50\/50\/90? That would be incredibly tough but I think that\u2019s the type of achievement he needs to win his third. Shaun Powell :  Very real. Curry is putting up solid numbers which, for him, means he\u2019s pushing towards 30 points and six 3-pointers a night. This pace keeps him in the mix and possibly the favorite, although I suspect Giannis Antetokounmpo will have a say in the race before it\u2019s done, especially if the Bucks finish among the top three in the East. John Schuhmann :  Real. Curry probably won\u2019t continue to average 31 points on an effective field goal percentage of 66 percent, and the Warriors have three other stars to take some of the credit for the team\u2019s success. But if they\u2019re head and shoulders better than the rest of the league in the regular season, voters would have to think of their most important player as an MVP candidate. We all understand that Curry\u2019s importance to the Golden State offense (which has scored 11 more points per 100 possessions than the league average, a mark which would be a record over a full season) goes beyond his own numbers. His unparalleled ability to shoot off the dribble and his movement when he doesn\u2019t have the ball are the foundation for what the Warriors do.  Sekou Smith :  Steph\u2019s MVP campaign is absolutely real. The Warriors\u2019 early blitz is certainly aiding his cause and Steph\u2019s play right now certainly puts him in the thick of the Kia MVP chase. It\u2019s not clear to me that he\u2019s actually made it a conscious move to try and see if he can win a third MVP. The competition this season is only going to get more and more interesting as things roll along. So much will depend on who stays healthy throughout a long season where the scores are rising and anything is possible on a given night. I don\u2019t think it means as much to Steph as the Warriors\u2019 pursuit of another Larry O\u2019Brien Trophy. But if you can double up this season, why not?"},{"id":37591,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/jazz-donovan-mitchell-probable-vs-mavs","date":"2018-11-07","title":"Jazz guard Donovan Mitchell available tonight vs. Mavs","content":" After missing two of the Utah Jazz\u2019s last three games due to injury, Donovan Mitchell will play on Wednesday.

Wesley Matthews had a hot second quarter and helped the Mavericks tie a franchise record with 13 3-pointers in one half and the most in a second quarter (9). Matthews contributed four treys in the second and had five for the half, finishing with 23 points. Both the Wizards and Mavericks looked for a lift as they entered Tuesday night\u2019s game with identical 2-7 records. Fresh from snapping a five-game skid with a victory over the Knicks on Sunday , the Wizards squandered a chance to build a little momentum. Instead they sputtered out of the gate. A nice third-quarter run after falling behind 70-49 at the half couldn\u2019t make up ground as the Mavericks finished strong. Hornets rookie Miles Bridges, the No. 12 pick in the 2018 draft, left no doubt about his hops in the first quarter versus the Hawks. Bridges, a 6-foot-7 forward, missed a shot from the left baseline and Willy Hernangomez grabbed the rebound. As the Hawks converged, Bridges saw a lane and took the feed from Hernangomez for a thunderous tomahawk slam. For good measure, Bridges rubbed it in a little bit by mimicking the motorcycle \u201cvroom, vroom\u201d rev that Vince Carter did with both hands earlier. Carter, who\u2019s been in the league for as long as Bridges has been alive, dunked it after a baseline move a couple of minutes before Bridges. C.J. McCollum continues to show why he and Damian Lillard are one of the best backcourts in the NBA. McCollum turned in a stellar shooting night \u2014 17-of-26 \u2014 as he erupted for a season-high 40 points and dished six assists, quieting the hot Bucks 118-103 . In the third quarter alone, McCollum posted 19 points to help put the game out of reach. Tony Parker displayed crafty patience and faked two defenders from the same pivot point near the Hawks\u2019 basket."},{"id":37616,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/los-angeles-lakers-sign-tyson-chandler-official-release","date":"2018-11-06","title":"Lakers officially sign Tyson Chandler","content":" EL SEGUNDO  \u2013 The Los Angeles Lakers have signed center Tyson Chandler, it was announced today by General Manager Rob Pelinka.

At the time of his retirement, Johnson was the NBA\u2019s all-time leader in assists with 9,981, a three-time winner of the NBA MVP and Finals MVP, and a 11-time NBA All-Star. During the 1990-91 season with the Lakers, Johnson averaged 19.4 points, 12.5 assists and 7.0 rebounds per game. Johnson triumphantly returned to the league at NBA All-Star 1992, where he scored 25 points with nine assists to win All-Star Game MVP. Two years later, after becoming a prominent spokesman for HIV\/AIDS awareness, Johnson re-joined the Lakers as interim coach near the end of the 1993-94 season. The Lakers, who sat at 28-38 when Johnson joined, went 5-1 during Johnson\u2019s first six games, but went on to lose five straight before Johnson announced his plans to not return as coach next season.

It\u2019s November 6, Election Day, and the All-Star swingman lost the popular vote in Minnesota months ago. Not only with a segment of the weary fan base, but you wonder if the mood in the Timberwolves\u2019 locker room drops faster than mercury in a Minneapolis winter when Butler walks in. Just the body language alone among some teammates is telling. Poor Karl-Anthony Towns hasn\u2019t been caught smiling since signing his super-max extension worth a reported $190 million , and only then, just barely. Yes, the joy and most likely the Wolves\u2019 performance will stay sapped as long as Butler is in uniform and the atmosphere caused by his uncertain status continues. There are two basketball crimes being committed here: one by Butler (who\u2019s pouting and playing transparent politics until his trade demands are met) and one by Tom Thibodeau (the Minnesota GM\/coach who so far seems powerless to solve it). Which means, of course, the joke once again is on a franchise that until lately tried to convince skeptical folks that decades of flogging itself were over. The Wolves\u2019 image has been overtaken by a singular and embarrassing episode. It\u2019s astonishing to think that it\u2019s now three weeks into the 2018-19 season and Butler is \u2026 still \u2026 around. How is this productive for a team that finally reached the playoffs last spring after a 14-year absence and is seeking traction in the tough Western Conference? This isn\u2019t an issue of Butler\u2019s talent, to a degree. Butler is a scrappy, self-made impact player who impressively rose from obscurity in high school to grind his way into the league. He trains hard, plays hard, doesn\u2019t shrink from the big moment and only knows one speed. If he had a consistent 3-pointer (he\u2019s a career 34 percent 3-point shooter) he\u2019d be top-shelf. Surrounded by players who lack his composure and drive, Butler brings a necessary grit. Even now, when he plays, he\u2019s usually fire: his averages are 22 points, five rebounds and he leads the league in steals. In Monday\u2019s 120-109 loss to the Clippers , he scored 16 of his 20 points in the fourth quarter. And as he reportedly said in practice last month when he returned from his awkward (and self-imposed) training camp exile: \u201cYou can\u2019t win without me.\u201d But they can\u2019t win with him, either, not while they\u2019re caught in this fog, where nobody\u2019s quite sure where Butler\u2019s head, heart and allegiances lie on any given night. It\u2019s not a good look, not the right culture, not an environment to build any sort of momentum for the club. He has missed three of the Wolves\u2019 first 11 games, two for \u201crest\u201d, and may not play Wednesday against the Los Angeles Lakers . Citing his past injury history, Butler isn\u2019t big on playing both games of back-to-backs, even this early in the season, because of \u201cgeneral soreness\u201d from missing camp. And he\u2019s made it clear that he \u2014 and not the Wolves \u2014 will decide when he plays. Of course, Butler was in the lineup against the Clippers. He has a home in LA and the Clippers are reportedly on his trade wish-list. He sat the previous game in Portland and the Wolves lost by 30. He sat against the Utah Jazz at home and the Wolves needed a 50-point performance by Derrick Rose to barely win. Rose is a battered former Kia MVP trying to breathe life into whatever time he has left in the NBA. Butler made All-NBA the last two seasons ( he was All-NBA third team in 2017-18 ) and just turned 29. He\u2019s in position to make reasonably large money, yet is trying to force the Wolves\u2019 hand a year before hitting free agency (a disturbing trend in the NBA now). It\u2019s hard to imagine the Wolves giving Butler max money after investing in Towns and Andrew Wiggins, who represent the team\u2019s future. Besides, this isn\u2019t the way for Butler to go about getting a rich extension from the Wolves. Butler\u2019s leadership style is tough-love, believing the young players need a constant buzz in their ear and an occasional foot in the behind. That technique failed spectacularly in Butler\u2019s final season in Chicago and the Bulls were anxious to ship him out of town. Thibodeau, a tough guy himself, felt Butler needed to rub off on Towns and especially Wiggins, who doesn\u2019t exactly breathe fire. But is this a repeat of Chicago after Butler, in the offseason, openly questioned the commitment of Wiggins and Towns ? After Monday\u2019s loss, the Wolves fell to 4-7 (0-6 on the road) and are in danger of seeing last season\u2019s momentum evaporate. Clippers coach Doc Rivers, whom Thibodeau was an assistant coach to years ago in Boston, said: \u201cThey\u2019re better than this. They just have so much stuff \u2014 clutter \u2014 going on. \u201cIt\u2019s tough. It\u2019s a balancing act. It puts you in a very tough spot as a coach. All of us go through these. Hopefully they are more private than public but this one is extremely public.\u201d Thibodeau has no one to blame but himself, since he also calls the shots \u2014 for how much longer, who knows. He sent three lottery picks to the Bulls to get Butler and is now looking to get something back in any trades for Butler. However, Minnesota isn\u2019t operating with a leverage advantage, given Butler\u2019s contract situation and unpredictability. So, the clumsy and uncomfortable dance continues. The Wolves are on the clock with Butler. Can they afford to wait until the February trade deadline to deal him? Their season would likely be in flames by then. If there were a solid deal from the Rockets, Clippers or another team on the table, Butler would be gone by now. The Wolves must try as best as possible to ignore the elephant in the locker room. They must cope Butler\u2019s antics ( waving a towel along with Warriors\u2019 fans after Minnesota\u2019s loss, his sitting out) until then. Butler is better than this, or at least he should be. Maybe his next team will find out, because his current one is sinking along with his attitude. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

Whether or not Butler will play in the Wolves\u2019 next game remains unclear. Butler scored 20 points in a 120-109 loss last night , and after the game he wasn\u2019t certain about his status for Wednesday\u2019s road game against the Los Angeles Lakers ( 10:30 ET, ESPN ).

In 2017-18, the Nuggets were 12-4 when the former seventh overall pick scored 25 or more points. Murray nearly doubled that total on Monday night, pouring in 48 points in Denver\u2019s statement win over the Celtics. And no, Kyrie Irving was not pleased when Murray did try to hit the 50-point mark with the game already well in hand. \u201cWhat kind of competitor wouldn\u2019t it bother?\u201d Irving explained postgame . More important to the Nuggets are the 48 points Murray did score, which helped Denver earn the kind of win that punctuates their red-hot start to the season. Denver is now 9-1, tied with Golden State for best in the West. They\u2019ve done it despite Murray\u2019s scoring and efficiency dropping, but maybe that\u2019s just more cause to celebrate what the Nuggets could be if Murray is starting to round into form. Nikola Jokic is already a star in the making, but Denver needs others to consistently produce if and when opposing defenses decide to overwhelm its do-it-all big man. On national television against another elite opponent, Murray showed he could be that guy. You hear it from nearly every player that has ever mattered. Madison Square Garden is different. There\u2019s just something about it. Zach LaVine discovered that something for himself while scoring 41 points in Chicago\u2019s double-overtime, 116-115 win over the Knicks. The former 13th overall pick has always been a willing shooter, but he\u2019s paired that trigger-happy approach with the best accuracy of his career thus far. LaVine is averaged 27.9 points per game while shooting 47.4 percent from the field \u2014 better than Kemba Walker, Donovan Mitchell and Paul George, all of whom likewise attempt more than 19 shots per game. With Lauri Markkanen still out due to injury, LaVine has been option A, B and C for his team\u2019s offense and opposing defenses. Despite the demand and attention, he\u2019s producing. Now he\u2019s just got to score 40-plus 12 more times at Madison Square Garden to match Jordan. A reminder on The Horry Scale: It breaks down a game-winning buzzer-beater (GWBB) in the categories of difficulty, game situation (was the team tied or behind at the time?), importance (playoff game or garden-variety night in November?) and celebration. Then we give it an overall grade on a scale of 1-5 Robert Horrys, named for the patron saint of last-second answered prayers. * * * In danger of following up an inspired win over the Spurs with a letdown to the Cavs, the Magic secured their first win streak of 2018-19 thanks to Evan Fournier\u2019s 22-footer as time expired. DIFFICULTY: New Magic head coach Steve Clifford drew up a beauty of an inbounds play, but Cleveland\u2019s Cedi Osman read it perfectly and immediately smothered Fournier on the inbounds catch. The French-born guard was forced to swing the ball quickly from right-to-left, take a quick dribble and use what little space he had created for a dart of a jump shot. GAME SITUATION: There was no miss-and-go-home stakes at play between these two sub-.500 teams, as the game was tied 100-100. For Fournier, it was huge. The former 20th overall pick shot just 10-for-26 in the last three minutes of five-point games or closer last season. The move and the shot, however, looked as practiced and pure as any pro. CELEBRATION: Fournier\u2019s teammates appropriately mobbed him immediately after the shot went through. It\u2019s been a long rebuild for the Magic, and Fournier has been along for nearly all of it. GRADE: There were no big stakes on the table, but it was good to see Orlando on the right side of an early-season nail-biter. Three Horrys .  At the turn of the century, Shaq was king. In the late 2000s, it was Dwight Howard. In the early 2010s, Kevin Love took over. Make way for Andre Drummond, the new king of the 20-20 club. The Pistons big man went off for 25 points and 24 rebounds in Detroit\u2019s 120-115 loss to Miami. The performance marked Drummond\u2019s fourth 20-20 game of this season . The last player before Drummond to log four 20-point, 20-rebound outings within the season\u2019s first nine games: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, with six of them in his first year with the Lakers ( per Basketball-Reference ).

The team relented to Drew\u2019s requests by restructuring his contract and signing him to be their coach for the remainder of this season \u2014 and perhaps beyond. Drew and his agent, Andy Miller, had been negotiating since the Cavs\u2019 top assistant asked for security and guarantees if he was going to become the rebuilding team\u2019s interim coach and replace Tyronn Lue, who was fired on Oct. 28 following a 0-6 start. Drew wanted a pay raise to finish out the season and got one. Drew\u2019s new deal includes a team option for the 2019-20 season.

My staff embraces the challenge.\u201d The Cavs have gone 1-2 under Drew, who didn\u2019t want to proceed this season without assurances from the organization. Drew promised to remain professional and do his job during the talks, and the 60-year-old kept his word. After ruling the Eastern Conference the past four seasons with LeBron James, Cleveland is going through a difficult transition without the three-time champion. And beyond the team\u2019s rough start, the Cavs are also trying to cope minus All-Star forward Kevin Love, who may be out two months or more following foot surgery last week. If that wasn\u2019t enough, the Cavs have also been dealing with guard J.R. Smith wanting to be traded, Sexton struggling and former assistant Jim Boylan filing an age discrimination lawsuit against the team. Drew is pleased to have his situation resolved. \u201cObviously we\u2019re a different team because of what has transpired within the past 12 months, and then coming into the season, having to lose Kevin Love,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to ask more of our players with Kevin being out, that\u2019s the reality, and we\u2019re prepared to do that. \u201cNow that this is behind us, we can really lock in and focus, and try to continue to teach and get this team moving.\u201d General manager Koby Altman is also looking forward to Drew developing a team that entered the season believing it could still compete for the playoffs. \u201cWe are pleased to have reached this agreement with coach Drew to continue leading the team on the court,\u201d Altman said. \u201cHe brings important experience and many qualities that we expect to translate well with our team as the head coach.

Their four wins were by a total of 13 points, three of them were at home and the other was against the Chicago Bulls, but 4-0 was 4-0. Now, the Pistons are 4-4, and we the point-differential context of those first four games looks important. Speaking of point differential, the Charlotte Hornets are up to their old tricks. The team that has had a losing record and a positive point differential in each of the last two seasons ( they were the only team with that distinction last season ) is 5-5, with the point differential (plus-7.6 per game, sixth best in the league ) of a team that should be 8-2. The Hornets have three wins by 29 points or more (the rest of the league has six total ), but are 1-4 in games that were within five points in the last five minutes . Charlotte and Detroit were expected to compete for the Eastern Conference playoff spot vacated by LeBron James when he left for L.A. Now, the Washington Wizards may be making room for both of them, but the Hornets-Pistons comparison should be fun to monitor all season long. Both teams go into Week 4 with .500 records and they\u2019ll meet for the first time on Sunday in Detroit. The top two teams in this week\u2019s rankings, meanwhile, will meet for the first time on Thursday in Oakland.

Forget about all that and focus on this: Klay Thompson\u2019s pure shooting stroke. That was the story in this one, as the Warriors shooting guard broke out of his season-long shooting slump with 52 points and an NBA-record 14 3-pointers . Spurs 113, Mavericks 108 (OT) \u2014 DeMar DeRozan continues to deliver go-to guy performances for the Spurs and had another one on Monday night. Although DeRozan missed a potential game-winner, he scored 18 points in the fourth quarter and overtime as he and Mavs rookie Luka Doncic waged a thrilling battle down the stretch late in the game.  Bucks 124, Raptors 109 \u2014 The scoring outburst from Thompson stole the spotlight on Monday night. But don\u2019t overlook or short-change what Milwaukee pulled off this win. It tied the best start in franchise history (last done by the defending champion Bucks team of 1971-72) and became the NBA\u2019s lone undefeated team at 7-0. More impressively, though, the Bucks got the win without star Giannis Antetokounmpo. Timberwolves 128, Jazz 125 \u2014 Seven years ago, Derrick Rose was one of the marquee names in the NBA. Injuries and other setbacks have robbed him of that post, but on Halloween night, it looked like time stood still for Rose. He went for a career-best 50 points, setting numerous personal single-game highs in an emotional game for the former Kia MVP winner. Kings 146, Hawks 115 \u2014 The last time Sacramento started a season 6-3, they won 59 games behind Chris Webber, Mike Bibby and Co. De\u2019Aaron Fox was in a zone against Atlanta, notching 31 points, 15 assists and 10 rebounds for his first career triple-double. The Kings are a long way from reaching contending status, but are showing early signs of life out West in 2018-19. Pacers 102, Celtics 101 \u2014 Victor Oladipo isn\u2019t about to fall into the background of the Eastern Conference. That much was made certain on Saturday night as he nailed a go-ahead 3-pointer against the favored Boston Celtics with 3.4 seconds left. His shot not only delighted the home crowd, but proved the Indiana Pacers are just as much of an early-season favorite in the East as anyone else. Derrick Rose (50 points, 19-31 FG, 4-7 3pt FG, 4 reb, 6 ast, 2 stl, 1 blk in 41 minutes) \u2014 In what was the most emotionally stirring on-court performance to date this season, Rose put forth the kind of game that hadn\u2019t been seen from him \u2026 ever. That block you see in his stat line? It couldn\u2019t have been more timely as he got a piece of Dante Exum\u2019s 3-pointer at the buzzer to preserve the win. | Watch | Video box score Klay Thompson (52 points, 18-29 FG, 14-24 3pt FG, 5 reb, 1 stl in 27 minutes) \u2014 Shooters gotta shoot, right? Thompson lived up to that adage on Monday night and busted out of his season-long slump in style. Even cooler than his 52 points? Watching his teammates \u2014 and Stephen Curry, whose single-game record for 3-pointers Thompson broke \u2014 egging him on all game long. | Watch | Video box score Andre Drummond (24 points, 8-14 FG, 8-10 FG, 23 reb, 1 ast, 1 stl, 2 blk in 38 minutes) \u2014 Although the Pistons lost on Wednesday night, Drummond was a beast, logging his third 20-20 game of the season. (For context, he had seven 20-20 games a season ago.) The big man is looking like a force again this season and is a big reason why the Pistons are a solid team in the Eastern Conference. | Video box score De\u2019Aaron Fox (31 points, 9-13 FG, 3-4 3pt FG, 10 reb, 15 ast, 1 stl in 33 minutes) \u2014 If you haven\u2019t seen the progress Fox has made in his game, you\u2019re missing out. After a rookie season filled with fits and starts, Fox has taken leaps in every major statistical category and showed folks in Atlanta on Thursday just how far he\u2019s come. | Watch | Video box score Joel Embiid (39 points, 10-18 FG, 1-3 3pt FG, 17 reb, 1 ast, 2 blk in 33 minutes) \u2014 There are hot starts \u2026 and then there was the first half Embiid had Saturday against Detroit. Against his favorite matchup (Pistons center Andre Drummond), Embiid got off to an 8-for-9 shooting start and, by halftime, had 32 points. Seven of those eight makes came inside the paint and, overall, he missed just two shots in the paint all game. | Watch | Video box score  An insider\u2019s view  Spencer for hire  Steer the deer  Victory roar  \u201cRight now, we\u2019re playing like crap.

He started the countdown in September, when he announced that his 16th season would be his last . He wasn\u2019t wild about the idea of a farewell tour , complete with all the bells and whistles that accompany the end of a career for a future Hall of Famer. But the three-time champion and Miami Heat icon (how many Florida counties have been nicknamed by the masses in your honor?) said something inside of him made it clear that now was the time to complete this part of his journey. As for what comes next, well, that \u2019s the fun part. At 36, Wade insists he is far from done with basketball. His son, Zaire, has made sure that the family legacy will carry on in some form or fashion. The Class of 2020 point guard has been turning heads on the grassroots circuit since middle school. The elder Wade, The Finals MVP in 2006, spent some time reflecting his own career, the state of the game now and in the future, and more with NBA.com \u2019s Sekou Smith. * * * Sekou Smith:  You\u2019ve already announced your retirement, but have you come to grips with the fact that almost everything you do this season is going to be your last \u201ceverything,\u201d so to speak? Dwyane Wade:  Yeah, not yet, really. I mean, I\u2019m at peace with it. I took a long time deciding if I was going to make this my last season and come back and play or what I was going to do. So, as I can be, because I don\u2019t know what it is not to play, right now I\u2019m at peace with it. But I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to feel next year [laughing]. But for this year, right now, I\u2019m okay with it. SS:  You look around the league at your contemporaries, at guys who have been in the league for as long as you have or longer, and everybody seems to age differently. Some guys still look spry and other guys, you can tell the years have taken a toll on their bodies. Some guys can still play at that highest level and some guys simply cannot. DW:  Yeah, [Le]Bron [James] just hasn\u2019t lost any athleticism \u2026 maybe a little bit, but not a lot. He\u2019s been blessed. But it\u2019s definitely a young man\u2019s game and a young man\u2019s league, there is no argument there. But you still have guys that can play, that can contribute in all different ways. You have a guy like LeBron who is in his 16th year and still leading a team, and still one of the best in the league. And then there\u2019s a guy like \u2018 Melo [Carmelo Anthony] who scored 28 the other night off the bench or whether it\u2019s a guy like myself, who can still get it going. Guys have different ways they can help teams as they get further in their careers. Look at Vince Carter helping this young [Atlanta Hawks] team. There\u2019s an opportunity for you to be there if you keep your body in good shape and if you evolve with the game. And I think that\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve tried to do over the years is try to evolve with the game over the course of my career, as my body has changed and really the game has changed. SS:  When you make that decision to retire, how long after that do your start seriously thinking about what is you are going to do next? Once you actually retire, there is no NBA schedule to adhere to, no daily routine you have to follow to transition from one season to the next. What fills that void for you as an elite athlete? DW:  Yeah, it\u2019s crossed my mind, because as you walk away from something you\u2019ve done your whole life, you have those moments where it\u2019s like, \u2018What the hell am I doing to do next?\u2019 Sure, I\u2019ve got business interests and all sorts of things. But what am I going to do to fill the void of 20,000 people cheering or 20,000 people booing? And you realize that you will not fill that void. You have to find something else that excites you, that makes you get out of bed every single day with that fire in your eyes. But you won\u2019t ever get this again. I\u2019ve talked to enough older guys over the years to know that. You\u2019ll never fill that void. SS:  So what advice would 2018 Dwyane Wade give to rookie Dwyane Wade, in terms of the things you need to be ready for over the course of the next 16 years? DW:  I guess it would probably be more off-the-court stuff. You know, when I came into this league nobody told me how to handle this stuff. I didn\u2019t know many NBA players if any at all really. I didn\u2019t grow up with a father that played in the NBA or an uncle or even a close family friend. So really it would be stuff off the court. Learn the hard stuff. Watch your money, you know, pay attention to how you spend your money. I guess, family, definitely don\u2019t mix business and family [laughing]. Don\u2019t ever do that. It would be a lot of things away from basketball, just things everybody needs to know as you grow from a young man into true adulthood. On the court, the message would be simple: just do what I did. I put myself in a position where people have talked about me being one of the top three shooting guards to ever play this game and to have an opportunity to further honor what I\u2019ve done as a player after I\u2019m actually done playing this game. That\u2019s amazing in itself for where I came from. So yeah, on the court, I\u2019d say just go out there and be a young bull. Play your heart out. And off the court, I\u2019d say watch everybody, watch out for yourself in everything you do. SS:  That\u2019s interesting. You talk about not knowing anyone in the NBA as you were growing up and now, you and LeBron (and some of your contemporaries) have sons that will grow up with fathers who chased and realized that dream of playing at the highest level. Does that stir up the juices in you to make sure you mentor your own son along the way, knowing that he has a chance to potentially play this game at a high level? DW:  Oh yeah. Absolutely. You know what\u2019s crazy, and it\u2019s hard to say this, but I swear \u2014 and I\u2019m sure \u2018 Bron feels or will feel the same way if you asked him \u2014 you\u2019ve wanted it for yourself. You\u2019ve put in the work for years and grinded away, so you know what it takes and how difficult a road it can be to actually get to the NBA. But I want it for my son in a way that is unhealthy. You know what I mean? I want my son to be able to experience this dream. And this is his dream. To be able to experience this \u2026 man. I want to be there, too. I want to see him in the green room [at the Draft]. I want to see him go through his rookie season. I want to see him play against his favorite player and guys he\u2019s growing up around in the locker room at the All-Star Games. I do, I really want it for him. So it\u2019s exciting to be able to be a part of something my son really enjoys doing. Obviously, it\u2019s a passion I share with him. But just being able to watch him now at this stage, watching him put the work in and the grind \u2026 it\u2019s just a great time for me as his father. I can\u2019t wait to be able to do that more. SS:  It\u2019s crazy that kids of his generation are able to track their progress the way they can in this digital and social media age. You see how much better some of these young kids get from year to year, month to month even, and it\u2019s mind-boggling. That\u2019s a luxury or a curse, depending on your perspective, you didn\u2019t have 20 years ago. DW:  Look, I knew who was in my district. And I barely knew that. But yeah, they get a global view of the game and what\u2019s going on all around them at all times. They get to compare themselves against this guy in Los Angeles when you live on the other side of the country. Or a guy from Canada or wherever. And they get to play against each other now with the grassroots circuit. It\u2019s so much different now compared to when we were growing up. So yeah, it\u2019s just a different time. And man, the talent these kids have way exceeds our talents at that same stage. Just their skills. I mean, everybody\u2019s got a personal trainer and all of the moves. I didn\u2019t have all that. I learned in the backyard with my dad teaching me. I didn\u2019t learn with professional trainers and all that. But it\u2019s the culture now. That\u2019s where we\u2019re at. It\u2019s a different day. And that\u2019s what you see in the NBA right now. SS:  In what way? DW:  We\u2019re at a place right now in the league where if you have talent, you can succeed. And I\u2019m not knocking it. It\u2019s just what it is. When I came in it was different. It was more of a thinking man\u2019s game. It was different rules to the game, you know, with hand-checking and everything. It was more of a man\u2019s league, per say. But now, if you have talent in this league, you\u2019ve got one-on-one abilities, you can succeed. If you\u2019ve got one talent, just one thing you do special, you can be great. If that talent is just setting the pick and roll and then jumping as high as I can for a lob, you can do it and you can make $200 million doing it. It\u2019s just a different day. And there\u2019s nothing wrong with it. The game changes for every generation. So I hope my son can get a little of this NBA action, because I think it\u2019s going to be a really fun era to play in and be a part of. SS:  Did you feel the twists and turns of the game during your career, the changing of the way teams played, the way the game was played, in real time? DW:  Oh yeah. It shifted a lot of times during my career, some shifts harder than others, but you knew it. Remember, I was a point guard my first year and we ran Turn-Five to the bigs. Throw it to the big man, do what you do and get out of the way. Then it shifted, guys like myself, and the pick-and-roll era kicked in hard. We come in and start running like 50 or 60 pick and rolls a night. And then it changed from there. Another change in the evolution was bigger guys running the point. And, of course, the 3-point shooting era, the pace-and-space. All of that within a 15-year span. So there have been so many changes to the game, but it\u2019s been cool not only to watch but also to be a part of. Because just as a fan, you\u2019ve got to love this 3-point generation with [Stephen] Curry and Klay [Thompson] and KD [Kevin Durant] and this next generation, they are the ones who came along at the right time and made it cool to play a new way. It\u2019s their time now. And the best part is you sit back and wonder what\u2019s going to be next? What\u2019s the next step in the evolution of this beautiful game? SS:  That\u2019s a great question. It seems like the envelope has been pushed so far already. It\u2019s hard to see where it goes next. We already have giants shooting from 25 feet, something that in a previous generation would have never happened. Do we ever really see it coming? Doesn\u2019t it just happen in the midst of whatever is already going on? DW:  True. And I think we\u2019re going to be here in this 3-point shooting, pace-and-space age for a while longer. You\u2019re definitely going to be in this generation for a while. But sooner or later something will click, some team, some coach or some transcendent player will come along and they\u2019re going to change the game. I remember those Phoenix teams changed the mentality, with Mike D\u2019Antoni, Q-Rich [Quentin Richardson], Joe Johnson and those boys running with Steve Nash. And then eventually, years later, the rest of the league caught up and it took hold on what they were trying to do before everybody else. So you really just never know where the game is going next. But rest assured wherever it goes, it\u2019s going to a fun ride for everybody. * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

On the road, the Philadelphia 76ers only beat themselves. That\u2019s what they did Sunday night in Brooklyn, committing an NBA season-high 28 turnovers in a 122-97 loss . A team that was expected to be among the Eastern Conference contenders is only 6-5, and the 76ers are 0-5 outside Philadelphia. \u201cWe are not, right now, at this present moment, amongst the royalty in the East and we understand that,\u201d coach Brett Brown said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a badge that we want. It\u2019s in us. But at this moment, after 11 games, that\u2019s not where we are. And that\u2019s OK. \u201cThis group does have fight, this group does have pride and we will find a way to move on, move up, move forward and that\u2019s my job.\u201d The 76ers were routed at Toronto, Milwaukee and Boston, but those are three of the top teams in the conference. The loss in Brooklyn, their most lopsided of the season, was such a pitiful performance \u2013 Brown called it \u201cunacceptable\u201d- that the coach made sure to stress that it was an outlier for his team. The 76ers handed the Nets 39 points off their miscues, which contributed to Brooklyn\u2019s whopping 40 more shot attempts. \u201cIt\u2019s not Golden State. We shouldn\u2019t lose a game to Brooklyn by that many points,\u201d said Joel Embiid, who finished with 16 points and 15 rebounds but got only eight shots and was pulled midway through the fourth quarter. \u201cWe didn\u2019t compete.\u201d Brown knows the Sixers have to change their ways to have any success away from home. \u201cTo win on the road, you better not turn it over at the rate that we\u2019ve been turning it over. You better have an incredible focus on rebounding,\u201d Brown said. \u201cHistorically, like, those are the tenants of road wins. \u201cAnd I think that togetherness, that toughness, the ability to take punches and still come out on the other side, that is part of growth. We don\u2019t have that right now.\u201d Philadelphia was 22-19 on the road last season, when it won its last 16 games overall and went 52-30 before reaching the second round of the playoffs behind Embiid and Ben Simmons. That strong finish has been followed by a shaky start, and players agreed with Brown\u2019s tough talk about their effort Sunday. But he insisted afterward the 76ers wouldn\u2019t overreact and would move on. They\u2019ll try to do that Wednesday at Indiana, another team ahead of the 76ers in the East. A victory smooths out a rough road that\u2019s left them puzzled. \u201cI don\u2019t know what it is,\u201d Simmons said, \u201cbut I think we just need to step it up.\u201d"},{"id":37637,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/about-last-night-11-2-18","date":"2018-11-05","title":"About Last Night: Devin Booker back in business","content":"Devin Booker missed all of training camp and preseason with a broken bone in his shooting hand. He also sat three of the Suns\u2019 first eight games with a left hamstring injury. On Sunday night, Booker looked perfectly healthy while adding to his reputation as one of the premier young go-to scorers in the league. With 1.7 seconds left, Booker drilled a 17-foot jumper that capped the Suns\u2019 fourth-quarter comeback and snapped their seven-game losing streak with a 102-100 victory over the Grizzlies. \u201cThat\u2019s what he does,\u201d coach Igor Kokoskov said about Booker\u2019s game-winner. \u201cHe\u2019s proven that many, many times \u2026 We appreciate everything he\u2019s doing. So, yes, [at the] end of the game, he\u2019s a guy who can land the plane.\u201d Playing the entire fourth quarter with five fouls, Booker scored 14 of his 25 points in the final period as Phoenix overcame a 12-point deficit for its second victory of the season. Booker, 22, now has three career game-winning field goals in the final 10 seconds of the fourth quarter or overtime. The previous two \u2014 both last season \u2014 were buzzer beaters. Ibaka can\u2019t miss  Serge Ibaka made his first 14 shots on the way to a career-high 34 points, and the Raptors didn\u2019t need Kawhi Leonard in a 121-107 victory over the Lakers. Ibaka became the first player to start a game 14-for-14 from the field since Shaquille O\u2019Neal did it in Feb. 2006. And they weren\u2019t all dunks and layups:  \u201cI was just focused,\u201d Ibaka told reporters after the game. \u201cI knew Kawhi was out tonight, so I just wanted to go out there and do my best.\u201d Big fat Greek poster  There\u2019s simply no stopping Giannis Antetokounmpo, who finished with 26 points, 15 rebounds and 11 assists in the Bucks\u2019 resounding 144-109 victory over the Kings. The triple-double was Antetokounmpo\u2019s second of the season, but we\u2019ll remember the poster dunk on Kosta Koufos. After the game, Giannis sounded almost remorseful for dropping the hammer on his countryman. The Kings, who had won five straight games, were happy to get out of Milwaukee and posted a classic \u201cTommy Boy\u201d clip to describe the 33-point rout. Three weeks into the season, five teams remain winless on the road. The Sixers could have reduced that number with a victory in Brooklyn. Instead, the Nets rolled 122-97 , improving to 9-4 against Philadelphia at Barclays Center. The Sixers looked out of sync on the second night of a back-to-back and committed 28 turnovers, most in the NBA this season, leading to 39 points for the Nets. \u201cWe are not, right now, at this present moment, amongst the royalty in the East and we understand that,\u201d coach Brett Brown said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a badge that we want. It\u2019s in us. But at this moment, after 11 games, that\u2019s not where we are.\u201d Philadelphia, meanwhile, is a perfect 6-0 at home. So there\u2019s that. The Raptors led the Lakers by 25 points after the first quarter, the largest point differential in a first quarter in the shot clock era (since 1954-55 season)."},{"id":37641,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/magic-lakers-stick-gameplan","date":"2018-11-05","title":"Magic, Lakers trying to stick to their gameplan","content":" LOS ANGELES \u2014 His basketball instincts weren\u2019t always right, but they were never wrong. There\u2019s too much evidence of this over the course of a Hall of Fame career , where Magic Johnson created dreams for himself while simultaneously crushing those of others. Where do we begin? Aside from the no-look passes that became a trademark , he once tossed the ball downcourt to avoid being intentionally fouled, the backspinning ball slowly bouncing the final seconds off the clock to send the Los Angeles Lakers to a playoff victory. Who ever thought of doing that? He\u2019s back at it, this time in charge of running and restoring the Lakers with the sole purpose of winning, and once again Magic must remember his initial instincts when he took the job and learn to trust them. His blueprint was never to have the Lakers blast out from the starting blocks and win the month of October \u2014 do they give out trophies for that? Instead, it was to ride the still-freakish talents of LeBron James with short-term veterans and let the young players develop on reasonable time so they can be ready for big-boy ball in the spring. This is probably what caught Luke Walton and outsiders by surprise the other day when the young coach heard a higher octave than normal from Magic, who gave Walton an early lecture with the Lakers in the midst of a sluggish but perfectly understandable (and harmless for now) 4-6 start. But believe the sources who yesterday stressed calm, saying Walton is in no danger of losing his job this season, that Magic\u2019s meeting was merely an early (if premature) shake-up call. This faith in Walton seemed curiously timed Sunday when the Lakers reached their LeBron-era low point, getting lapped 121-107 at Staples Center by the Toronto Raptors. That loss came with Kawhi Leonard sitting out because of a sore left foot and with the Lakers hearing boos from fans with steep hopes. Leonard is in play for the Lakers next summer when he hits free agency, but for this season anyway, he\u2019s on a team with fewer adjustment issues and the easier path to the NBA Finals (meaning, they play in the East). Toronto is 9-1 and for once appears LeBron-proof (meaning, he\u2019s in the West now). If Magic was really in a rush to keep up with the Stephen Currys, Kevin Durants and Klay Thompsons \u2014 which seems an exercise in frustration at this point, honestly \u2014 he had two chances to try a shortcut and his basketball instincts advised him otherwise, perhaps wisely. In the summer of 2017 \u2014 only months after Johnson was named Lakers president \u2014 the Indiana Pacers informally put Paul George on the trade market . There was a strong feeling in Indiana that George, a year away from unrestricted free agency, would not re-sign and it was best to get value for him now, rather than watch him walk and get nothing. The Pacers wanted a package of young players and\/or Draft picks plus salary cap filler. And negotiations with the Lakers started with Brandon Ingram. Magic passed on the deal, figuring George (a Southern Cal kid) would sign the following summer as a free agent (he didn\u2019t) and in a worst-case scenario, the Lakers would keep their cap room and Ingram would show improvement (he has). Leonard is now a year from free agency, he grew up in the L.A. area and was shopped by the San Antonio Spurs this summer. While San Antonio wasn\u2019t eager to send him to a Western rival, Kawhi would\u2019ve been a Laker at the right price. And once again, negotiations started with Ingram as part of a package. Johnson passed again as he figured Kawhi could come to the Lakers for free, so to speak, in the summer of 2019. Why not continue, then, home-growing Ingram, Kyle Kuzma, Lonzo Ball and Josh Hart \u2014 all of whom the Lakers drafted \u2014 and watch most if not all of them make noise in due time? While the volume of Magic\u2019s meeting with Walton was perhaps turned up, the subject was misleading. Magic isn\u2019t demanding the Lakers play winning ball right away, although that would be fine by him. He\u2019s demanding the Lakers play defense right away, and he holds Walton accountable for that. The Lakers rank in the bottom third of the NBA defensively, with improvements being marginal and only showing in spurts. This has occurred despite center JaVale McGee playing surprisingly well as a rim protector and all the young legs in the rotation. If the Lakers can\u2019t defend now, how can they expect to defend in the playoffs, provided they make it there? Now that would surely make Walton an endangered Laker coach. Therefore, it was better for Magic to let him know now than suffer the consequences later. The Lakers were buried by more defensive breakdowns Sunday, spotting the Raptors 41 first-quarter points and watching Serge Ibaka miss only two of 17 shots en route to 34 points (nearly 20 above his season average). But it was the second game of a back-to-back for the Lakers, and Walton was still the coach after the game. So, no, there\u2019s no hot seat. \u201cThey got to where they wanted, they got into a rhythm and it made it tough to stop after that,\u201d Walton said. The missing piece, someone who\u2019d instantly cure the Lakers\u2019 defense (among other issues), didn\u2019t play. Leonard\u2019s foot was too bruised in the final moments of the Raptors\u2019 win in Phoenix two nights earlier. Still, he\u2019s having an MVP-like start: 26.1 points, 7.6 rebounds and some of the finest perimeter defense in the league. He came to Toronto from the Spurs via a summer blockbuster trade with Danny Green, who says what Kawhi\u2019s doing right now shouldn\u2019t be the slightest surprise, even after missing virtually all last season with an injured quad muscle. \u201cI expected exactly what he\u2019s shown so far,\u201d Green said. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the best players in this league and is determined to prove that on a night-in, night-out basis. I\u2019ve seen from him this before. I\u2019m seeing it again.\u201d Here\u2019s the question the Lakers want answered: Is he happy in Toronto? \u201cYou\u2019d have to ask him,\u201d said Green, and good luck with that. All Kawhi revealed when asked about a perceived love for the Lakers while growing up near LA was this: \u201cI was an Allen Iverson fan.\u201d Which means exactly nothing on Nov. 5, other than July 1, the first day of free agency, is a long ways away. Between now and then, the Lakers and Walton are under the boss\u2019 orders to clean up the defense, reduce mistakes late in close games and stay on point. \u201cJust try to stay even keel,\u201d said LeBron, who pledged his support for Walton. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to read too much into nights like this.\u201d Tell that to Magic. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

The Phoenix Suns officially agreed to a buyout of Chandler\u2019s contract on Sunday, a move that will allow the 18-year veteran \u2014 once he clears waivers \u2014 to sign with the Los Angeles Lakers. A person with direct knowledge of the situation confirmed the plan to The Associated Press on Saturday, speaking on condition of anonymity because the Suns had not yet revealed it publicly. The New York Times first reported that Chandler and the Suns were agreeing on a buyout. Chandler was in the final season of his four-year deal with the Suns, and was due to make about $13.5 million this season. The 36-year-old Chandler played his high school basketball in Compton, California, just a few miles south of downtown Los Angeles. With the Lakers, he\u2019ll likely be the backup to JaVale McGee. Chandler was drafted by the Los Angeles Clippers with the No. 2 overall pick in the 2001 NBA draft, but has never played for either the Clippers or the Lakers. Chandler wound up debuting with Chicago, and has also played with New Orleans, Dallas, New York and Charlotte before joining the Suns in 2015. Chandler has seven appearances with the Suns this season, all backing up No. 1 overall draft pick Deandre Ayton. Chandler has averaged 3.7 points and 5.6 rebounds in about 13 minutes per game this season. He helped Dallas win the 2011 NBA title, and was an All-Star in the 2012-13 season. He\u2019s also been a teammate of new Lakers star LeBron James before \u2014 as part of USA Basketball\u2019s team that won a gold medal at the 2012 London Olympics. And he\u2019s appeared in 1,086 games, which is 10th most among all active NBA players. The Lakers beat the Blazers 114-110 on Saturday night . Phoenix next plays Sunday, at home against Memphis."},{"id":37639,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/phoenix-suns-tyson-chandler-buyout-agreement-official-release","date":"2018-11-04","title":"Suns reach buyout agreement with Tyson Chandler","content":" PHOENIX \u2013 The Phoenix Suns and Tyson Chandler have reached an agreement to buy out the veteran center\u2019s contract.

It\u2019s a gift that Victor Oladipo and the Pacers have \u2014 to be forgotten, only to provide a startling reminder of just how good they can be. Entering this season, talk of the Eastern Conference centered around the deep Celtics, the up-and-coming Sixers and Kawhi-led Raptors. Indiana was a footnote, albeit a fond one. Everyone respected and applauded last year\u2019s 48-win campaign and feisty first-round showing. Not many thought 2018-19 could be even better. Fast forward to Saturday night, when it seemed Kyrie Irving had seized the spotlight and the win with a pair of 3-pointers over the final 68 seconds. Each time, Oladipo answered. His final rebuttal was the stuff of NBA stardom: a pull-up 3-pointer to give the Pacers the lead with just 3.4 seconds left. Then, just to make sure Irving didn\u2019t have the last word, Oladipo stole the inbounds pass intended for Irving to seal the game. Just like that, the Pacers beat the team many consider the favorite to win the East. For now, they have wedged themselves at the big boys\u2019 table, ahead of both Boston and Philadelphia. It was fitting that Oladipo grabbed and pointed at his Pacers jersey after the game-winning 3. He and Indiana lacked a lasting identity until the latter traded for the former. Statistically, the Pacers are now a top-10 team on both ends of the floor. Oladipo is the engine behind those numbers, maintaining the production that saw him earn All-Star and All-NBA honors last season. Don\u2019t forget about them.  For roughly eight minutes in the fourth quarter, alarm bells were sounding in Los Angeles. A 20-6 Blazers run axed what had been a 20-point fourth-quarter lead. What would a complete collapse have meant for the underachieving Lakers and their reportedly reprimanded head coach? We never found out, thanks in large part to L.A.\u2019s three oldest players propelling them to a 114-110 win . LeBron James, Rajon Rondo and JaVale McGee excelled on a night the Lakers desperately needed a victory. Pile up enough early losses, and it\u2019s possible LeBron is fighting both a bottom-10 record and a coaching change en route to a Western Conference playoff spot. Instead, the Lakers are just a game under .500, though they\u2019ll need more to make up ground . Six teams ahead of them are on winning streaks of three games or more (including the Kings!). The Jazz (losers of three straight) probably won\u2019t flounder for long. Houston is gathering steam and coming up fast. Don\u2019t worry. It\u2019s not like they have to play the best team in the East on a second night of a back-to-back tomorrow \u2026 The first time Dwyane Wade and Vince Carter faced off, George Bush was in his first term as President, \u201cBaby Boy\u201d by Beyonce was No. 1 on BillBoard\u2019s Hot 100, and the Star Wars universe was hovering between Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith. Some stuff has changed since then, so it\u2019s pretty cool to still hear \u201cThe step-back by Dwyane Wade over Vince Carter\u201d in 2018. Also still cool: seeing Carter dunk a basketball at age 41. Also, props to Wade for his throwback shout-out to NBA TV\u2019s Steve Smith. Don\u2019t look now, but Trae Young is playing some pretty efficient offense lately. The fifth overall pick is shooting 24-for-45 (53.3 FG%) over his last three games. More importantly, he led the Hawks to a 123-118 win over Miami. The scoring is nice. The turnovers (16 in the last three games) aren\u2019t. What overshadows both is Young\u2019s passing, which produced a whopping 15 assists on Saturday, including this one-handed gem: It\u2019s heresy in Dallas and Atlanta, but maybe both Luka Doncic and Trae Young are good? Shout-out to Nikola Jokic for his Rondo-like performance in Denver\u2019s 103-88 win over Utah: seven points, 10 rebounds and 16 assists. This is a 7-footer throwing no-look skip passes: The Nuggets are 8-1 \u2014 just half a game back of Golden State \u2014 with Jokic at the wheel. At this rate, it\u2019s hard to not see the former 41st pick break through for his first All-Star appearance."},{"id":46604,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/houston-rockets-james-harden-active-eric-gordon-out","date":"2018-11-03","title":"James Harden expected to return, Eric Gordon out against Bulls on Saturday night","content":" > Tonight On NBA League Pass:  Rockets vs. Bulls (8 ET) The Houston Rockets continue to struggle with injuries to start the 2018-19 NBA season.

A few familiar faces have fallen off the list (Al Horford, Dwight Howard, Paul Millsap, Carmelo Anthony) and another (Lou Williams) just joined the 32-and-older club and is off to a stellar start and could join the chase very soon. 1. LeBron James (33), Los Angeles Lakers Previous rank: 1 Last weeks\u2019 stats: 7 games, 28.0 ppg, 8.1 rpg, 8.3 apg Season stats: 27.8 ppg, 8.6 rpg, 8.0 apg A new locale with new teammates hasn\u2019t prevented the King from storming out of the gates, chipping in at least 19 points in every game while shooting better than 50 percent from the field. In fact, that 19-point effort was the only game in which he went for less than 24. For good measure, James is adding 2.1 steals per game \u2014 his best mark since 2004-05 (2.2). 2. LaMarcus Aldridge (33), San Antonio Spurs Previous rank: 3 Last weeks\u2019 stats: 6 games, 20.5 ppg, 7.5 rpg, 3.3 apg Season stats: 20.6 ppg, 9.1 rpg, 3.1 apg The biggest reason for Aldridge\u2019s ascension to the No. 2 spot was Monday\u2019s 37-point, 10-rebound performance. But what really caught our eye was his splits over the last six games. In three home games, Aldridge averaged 16.7 points on 35.3 FG percentage. In three road games, he averaged 24.3 points on 60.4 FG percentage. 3. Chris Paul (33), Houston Rockets Previous rank: 2 Last weeks\u2019 stats: 3 games, 19.0 ppg, 6.0 rpg, 9.0 apg Season stats: 19.0 ppg, 5.8 rpg, 8.3 apg Returning from a two-game suspension, Paul\u2019s shooting remained MIA \u2014 going 3-for-13 and 6-for-19 in two subsequent games. Of course the one game he played before the suspension was impressive: 28 points (9-for-17 shooting), 10 assists and seven rebounds. He\u2019s also chipped in nine or more dimes in six of the last seven. 4. Marc Gasol (33), Memphis Grizzlies Previous rank: 4 Last weeks\u2019 stats: 5 games, 15.8 ppg, 8.6 rpg, 3.6 apg Season stats: 15.3 ppg, 8.2 rpg, 3.5 apg In addition to the above statistics, Gasol also managed 1.8 steals per game (eight in the last two games) and knocked down 10 of 21 3-pointers. After hitting more than 100 3s the last two seasons, this after just 12 in eight seasons combined , the big man looks to be well on his way to another big season from beyond the arc. 5. Kyle Lowry (32), Toronto Raptors Previous rank: 8 Last weeks\u2019 stats: 7 games, 17.3 ppg, 4.3 rpg, 11.6 apg Season stats: 18.5 ppg, 3.9 rpg, 11.1 apg Which one of these is not like the other: 6.4, 7.0, 6.9 and 11.1. Those are Lowry\u2019s assist averages over the last four seasons, with \u201918-19 being the outlier of 11.1. Maybe that\u2019s what Kawhi Leonard does for you. In addition to racking up the dimes, Lowry has poured in 20 or more points in four of the first eight, failing to eclipse double figures once. 6. Wesley Matthews (32), Dallas Mavericks Previous rank: NA Last weeks\u2019 stats: 7 games, 19.1 ppg, 2.7 rpg, 2.0 apg Season stats: 18.6 ppg, 2.6 rpg, 2.4 apg Matthews has been as consistent as possible with six of seven games scoring between 19-23 points. If he can maintain his current scoring clip of 18.6, he\u2019ll blow away his previous career high of 16.4 set in \u201913-14. One big reason for the scoring surge has been the trey, hitting four or more in four of the last seven games.  7. JJ Redick (34), Philadelphia 76ers Previous rank: 10 Last weeks\u2019 stats: 7 games, 20.0 ppg, 3.6 rpg, 4.0 apg Season stats: 18.4 ppg, 3.3 rpg, 3.3 apg Despite coming off the bench, Redick is still averaging 30.9 minutes, which is more than what he averaged in each of the previous three seasons. As should be the case, Redick has been big from deep, connecting on three or more 3s in seven straight games. Also true to form, he\u2019s gone 27-for-29 from the free-throw line. 8. Rudy Gay (32), San Antonio Spurs Previous rank: Just missed Last weeks\u2019 stats: 6 games, 13.7 ppg, 8.7 rpg, 2.3 apg Season stats: 14.3 ppg, 8.4 rpg, 2.0 apg Gay has taken to the new season nicely, shooting 52.5 from the field, 64.3 from beyond the arc and 1.3 steals. But of the main stats, the one that really sticks out is the 8.4 rebounds. His previous best mark was 7.4 in an 18-game stint with the Raptors in \u201913-14. For good measure, Gay has scored in double figures in every game. 9. Goran Dragic (32), Miami Heat Previous rank: 9 Last weeks\u2019 stats: 5 games, 18.0 ppg, 2.8 rpg, 4.6 apg Season stats: 17.7 ppg, 3.4 rpg, 5.0 apg If not for Tuesday\u2019s nine-point showing, Dragic probably would have moved up a notch. That said, in five games, the veteran guard still managed three games of 20 or more. But in two wins, Dragic averaged 20.5 points, 50.0 FG percentage and 50.0 3PT percentage compared to just 16.3 points, 39.5 FG percentage and 35.0 3PT percentage in three losses. 10. Dwyane Wade (36), Miami Heat Previous rank: Just missed Last weeks\u2019 stats: 5 games, 14.8 ppg, 2.4 rpg, 3.0 apg Season stats: 13.1 ppg, 4.4 rpg, 3.0 apg Wade has made an adjustment in his game this season, becoming proficient from beyond the arc. This season, he\u2019s shooting 44.8 on 3-pointers. His previous best mark was 32.9 in 46 games with the Cavs last season before being dealt to the Heat. Wade has hit two or more 3s in four of the last five, so let\u2019s see if this accuracy from deep continues.

OKC can only hope two ingredients from Friday\u2019s win remain: Russell Westbrook\u2019s efficiency (10-for 16 FG, 23 points, 12 assists, one turnover) and Jerami Grant\u2019s production at power forward (22 points). Both those factors were missing far too often last season for a Thunder team with ambitions of contending. Throw them in the mix, and that goal might be that much easier to achieve. For the first nine minutes of Friday\u2019s game, it looked like Dwight Howard was the cure. He was dunking. John Wall was dishing. The Wizards were winning. It wound up being a cruel tease for the home fans, who ultimately booed their now 1-7 team as they were outscored 44-20 in the second quarter. Howard\u2019s debut was an unhealthy mix of 20 points and just three rebounds. Wall coughed up seven turnovers. The Wizards shot just 9-for-30 from 3-point range. Washington finds itself facing the same questions being asked of the Thunder a week ago. What\u2019s wrong? Is it too soon to panic? What role does Scott Brooks play in all this? These questions \u2014 along with being tied for last in a LeBron-less East \u2014 aren\u2019t what a team with two All-Stars expected to face less than a month into the season. Speaking of blasts from the past, Carmelo Anthony went for 28 points in Houston\u2019s much-needed 119-111 win over Brooklyn. The 10-time All-Star has dropped 20-plus in three of the last four games, marking just the second time he\u2019s done that in the 2018 calendar year (Jan. 15-20). Remember, this is a guy who averaged more than 20 points per game in his first 14 NBA seasons. If the Rockets can figure out how to consistently unlock these offensive spurts from Anthony, they\u2019ll be in a much better place come April. \u2018Cause making impossible shots once wasn\u2019t enough\u2026 Common\u2019, Chris\u2026 Jarrett Allen paid no regard or respect to Clint Capela\u2019s help defense. Capela was even more ruthless when he returned the favor just minutes later in the second quarter. It finally happened. An undisclosed injury to Marcin Gortat forced Doc Rivers to appease the basketball gods and deliver the offering the NBA world has craved for nearly a year. Boban Marjonovic started an NBA game. The last time the 7-foot-3 jumped center circle, he put up 15 points, nine rebounds and three assists in 21 minutes for the Pistons. He was just as efficient for the Clippers in their win at Orlando , finishing with 10 points and 11 rebounds in 23 minutes of action. The appeal of Marjonovic is obvious. Every time he touches the ball, good things happen. Sometimes awesome things. When he sits, the Clippers boast a net rating of 4.3. When Marjanovic plays, that number more than doubles (9.6)."},{"id":37668,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/derrick-rose-exits-left-ankle-soreness","date":"2018-11-03","title":"Derrick Rose leaves game vs. Warriors with left ankle soreness","content":" Timberwolves guard Derrick Rose played four minutes in the first half of Friday\u2019s contest against the Warriors before being ruled out at halftime with left ankle soreness.

Via Chris Hine of the Minneapolis Star Tribune , coach Tom Thibodeau told reporters today that Butler will play after missing the Wolves\u2019 last game for \u201cprecautionary rest.\u201d Point guard Jeff Teague, who missed Wednesday\u2019s win against the Utah Jazz, is still out with a sore left knee. Additionally, backup point guard Tyus Jones will return to the lineup after a one-game absence.  Per the Wolves\u2019 game notes, Butler is listed in the starting lineup for tonight\u2019s game.   Before the game against Utah, Thibodeau told reporters at the morning shootaround that Butler\u2019s absence was not related to his trade request.   \u201cHe missed all of training camp, basically, so he has just general soreness,\u201d Thibodeau said.  Butler told ESPN he planned to attend the game against the Jazz at the Target Center and travel with the team on its five-game road trip that begins Friday at Golden State. Butler told the network he would play against the Warriors and disputed speculation that he was sitting out Wednesday in protest of the lack of action by the Wolves on his desire to be dealt elsewhere.  \u201cBecause my body is hurting and I don\u2019t want to go out there and risk an injury, people make stuff up?\u201d Butler said.  The Timberwolves are coming off the emotional high of Wednesday night\u2019s win. In that game, backup guard and former Kia MVP winner Derrick Rose torched the Jazz for a career-best 50 points .   Butler scored 32 points in 37 minutes in Minnesota\u2019s win Monday against the Los Angeles Lakers , including all five of his 3-point attempts in the fourth quarter. Players didn\u2019t practice Tuesday, however, which made the need to sideline the four-time All-Star shooting guard Wednesday peculiar. Butler did not travel with the team to Dallas for the Oct. 20 game, but that planned absence from a defeat by the Mavericks came after he played the night before in the home opener.  Butler\u2019s absence has allowed rookie Josh Okogie to see extended playing time. Okogie, the first-round draft pick out of Georgia Tech, went 6-for-17 against the Lakers for a career-best 17 points. He followed that up with 10 points, four rebounds and and two steals against the Jazz.  Information from The Associated Press was used in this report.

The prevailing wisdom said there was no way the former two-time Kia MVP winner Curry would be able to contend for a third Maurice Podoloff Trophy playing alongside Durant (a former Kia MVP himself). Their individual brilliance would be muted by the collective strength of their partnership as the two best players on the best team in the league. This notion they would continue to split Kia MVP votes made sense given their super team required all of its stars to sacrifice personal glory for the greater team good. That was the thinking before the first nine games of this season \u2026 and then Curry decided to attack things as he did in 2015-16. That season, he went nuclear \u2014 averaging 30.1 points, 5.4 rebounds and 6.7 assists per game while shooting 50.4 percent overall and 45.4 percent on 3-pointers \u2014 becoming the NBA\u2019s first unanimous MVP winner as the Warriors won an NBA-record 73 games . Durant was still toiling for the rival Oklahoma City Thunder then, sharing the spotlight with another eventual Kia MVP in Russell Westbrook. Curry\u2019s opening salvo this season, though, has been nothing short of staggering. His pace right now \u2014 leading the league in scoring while shooting nearly 55 percent overall and 53 percent on 3-pointers \u2014 could top that 2015-16 season. Doing all this with teammates who could make their own compelling cases for Kia MVP honors makes Curry\u2019s start even more mind-boggling. Both Durant (check out his 25-point fourth quarter at Madison Square Garden ) and Klay Thompson (who topped Curry\u2019s 3-pointers made record Monday in Chicago) are taking turns showing out, all of which speaks to the Warriors\u2019 mastery of a situation that easily could have overloaded these three stars. Curry\u2019s consistent brilliance sticks out in a sea of transcendent scoring performances in the early stages of this season. He was the one who dropped 51 points in 32 minutes in a win over Washington, making 11 of his 16 3-pointers. He went 6-for-11 on 3-pointers en route to 29 points when Durant worked the Knicks for 41 points at MSG. When Thompson was in the zone against the Bulls, Curry scored 23 points (on 7-for-9 shooting) in just 25 minutes. And when the New Orleans Pelicans showed up to Oracle Arena Wednesday night, Curry lit them up for 37 on 12-for-20 shooting and a 7-for-11 night on 3-pointers. That\u2019s all why Curry sits atop the first Kia Race to the MVP Ladder this season. And if he keeps this up, there\u2019s no reason Curry won\u2019t be in the thick of this season\u2019s MVP conversation when the dust settles. * * * The top five in the Week 1 edition of the 2018-19 Kia Race to the MVP Ladder: * * * Season stats:  33 points, 5.9 assists, 5.0 rebounds Here\u2019s the kind of damage Curry is doing so far: he\u2019s not only leading the league in scoring, but doing so while shooting a preposterous 54.9 percent overall and an equally bonkers 52.9 percent on 3-pointers . Scoring around the league is on the rise this season, and perhaps no one is taking more advantage of the freedom of movement rule the way Curry has. He\u2019s scoring from everywhere, against any and everyone whenever he wants in a system built around his skills. He\u2019s got one of the league\u2019s early 50-point games (51 points, Oct. 24 vs. Washington), and, given the way he\u2019s shooting now, could go for another 50-spot at any time. That\u2019s a warning for the Minnesota Timberwolves, who will see Curry tonight ( 10:30 ET, ESPN ). Season stats:  27.3 points, 7.8 rebounds, 3.2 assists Leonard is off to a monstrous start with Toronto, shattering that pesky myth that he was a product of a system in San Antonio. Anyone who forgot just how devastating a two-way player he could be after his nine-game run with the Spurs last season should have a clearer understanding of what he can do when healthy. Just ask Philadelphia 76ers stud Ben Simmons, who couldn\u2019t praise Leonard enough after matching wits with the two-time Kia Defensive Player of the Year. \u201cHe\u2019s a freak,\u201d Simmons said after turning the ball over 11 times while being guarded by Leonard on Tuesday . \u201cHis hands are huge. He\u2019s got long arms. He\u2019s a great defender.\u201d The scary part for the rest of the league? Leonard is shooting as good or better than ever on 3-pointers (44.4 percent) while logging a career-high 34.7 minutes . And, technically, he is still undefeated in a Raptors uniform (he got a rest day for Bucks-Raptors on Monday). Season stats:  26.1 points, 13.7 rebounds, 5.1 assists It took a franchise-record 24 made 3-pointers for the Boston Celtics to hold off Antetokounmpo and the Bucks Thursday night at TD Garden. It was the Bucks\u2019 first loss this season, but it wasn\u2019t because the \u201cGreek Freak\u201d didn\u2019t show up. He roasted the Celtics for 33 points (on just 22 shots), 11 rebounds, three steals and two assists. The increased floor spacing that comes with the arrival of coach Mike Budenholzer has allowed Antetokounmpo to put opposing defenders in compromising positions. His 3-point shot is still in the development stage, but if Budenholzer can help transform that part of his game (as he did for Al Horford and Paul Millsap in Atlanta), the rest of the league will be on notice. As for Antetokounmpo\u2019s groove elsewhere on the court, it has made him virtually unstoppable when he\u2019s in attack mode. Season stats:  25.2 points, 13.0 rebounds, 5.2 assists, 3.2 blocks Had there been a top five after the first four games of this season, Davis would have been a runaway pick for the No. 1 spot. He was that good in powering New Orleans\u2019 4-0 start. But the Pelicans have lost four straight and three to the four games since as Davis deals with nagging right elbow pain . Davis missed back-to-back games against Utah and Denver, then played Wednesday against the Warriors. It was clear he wasn\u2019t at his best, as he had 17 points, 12 rebounds and seven assists. (Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry held him out Thursday night in a road loss to the Portland Trail Blazers .) Davis hasn\u2019t been shy about proclaiming that he\u2019s chasing both Kia MVP and Kia Defensive Player of the Year honors, a double-dip that only half a handful of players could realistically set as a goal. The talent and high ceiling have never been in question. His availability to chase such lofty goals, however, remains a question at times. Season stats:  29.1 points, 6.0 assists, 5.1 rebounds Lillard entered this season as determined to prove his team\u2019s early 2018 playoff exit wasn\u2019t a true measure of Portland\u2019s status. Still, getting swept by the Pelicans sent the Blazers into the offseason with tons of questions and skeptics. Since the first whistle of training camp, Lillard has gone about the business of answering those questions. He\u2019s averaging career-highs in points (29.1), field goal percentage (49.7 percent), 3-point percentage (40 percent) and free throw percentage (94 percent). The Blazers finished their recent four-game road trip at 3-1, which included wins against Orlando, Indiana and the struggling Houston Rockets. Thursday night\u2019s win over the Anthony David-less Pelicans was fueled by Lillard\u2019s team-high 26 points, seven rebounds and six assists. Saturday night\u2019s home game against LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers could be another opportunity for Lillard and Co. to show they aren\u2019t stepping aside for anyone. * * * 6.

Smith, who has played sporadically to open the season, is reportedly seeking a trade. Per Chris Fedor of Cleveland.com , Smith has not officially made his intentions known to the Cavs\u2019 front office. The 14-year veteran is averaging a career low 2.5 points per game, but is only playing 12 minutes per game. He was inactive for the Cavs\u2019 season-opener against the Toronto Raptors and did not play in Tuesday\u2019s win against the Atlanta Hawks . The Cavs are in a state of transition this season and recently fired coach Tyronn Lue after Cleveland\u2019s 0-6 start. Per a recent report from ESPN , Smith was told informed recently that he would be removed from the rotation and not receive guarantees about playing time. Fedor reports that GM Koby Altman recently sat down with Smith a few days ago to ask him whether or not he wanted to stay around the team while in a lesser role. ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski reports that the NBA will consider whether or not Smith\u2019s public acknowledgement of his desire to be traded constitutes a fineable offense under the Collective Bargainin agreement. On Thursday, Smith was asked by a reporter if he hoped to be traded and Smith replied, \u201cYeah.\u201d Last season, Eric Bledsoe (then of the Phoenix Suns) was fined $10,000 by the NBA for his \u201cI Don\u2019t wanna be here\u201d tweet . Here\u2019s more from Fedor on Smith\u2019s future with the Cavs : Smith was one of the last players to leave the Cavs\u2019 shootaround today and said \u201cit\u2019s hard\u201d to come to work with a positive attitude. \u201cFortunately I to a great crew of people, former teammates, teammates, former coaches, lot of people in my ear that\u2019s helped me to go through this process,\u201d Smith told reporters. \u201cBut at the end of the day I can\u2019t take it out on my teammates. Regardless how hard it is to walk in here and actually put on, as hard as it may sound, to put on a Cavs jersey or shirt. I can\u2019t do that to my teammates. I can\u2019t do that to the fans.\u201d Smith said the hardest part is that he is not getting a chance to compete anymore, which has led to his trade request. \u201cThey know,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want me so they obviously know. Moves could\u2019ve been made to prevent this situation, but of course we\u2019re in this situation now, so, it is what it is.\u201d Overall, Smith has not played in three of the Cavs\u2019 seven games to date. Smith has played for four teams in his career, but has been traded three times in his career. The Cavs acquired him in 2015 and he became a key piece in their teams that reached four straight NBA Finals from 2015-18. He is a career 37.3 percent 3-point shooter and ranks 12th in NBA history with 1,917 3-pointers made ."},{"id":37684,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/dwight-howard-wizards-debut-friday-vs-thunder","date":"2018-11-02","title":"Howard to make debut with Wizards tonight vs. Thunder","content":" * Tonight on ESPN:  Thunder vs. Wizards, 8 ET At long last, the Washington Wizards will have Dwight Howard in the lineup.

In addition to Howard being back in the lineup, Washington will also have Markieff Morris back as well. Morris missed the Wizards\u2019 last game (a 107-95 loss to Memphis ) after entering the NBA\u2019s concussion protocol on Sunday.

Through nine games, the Kings are 6-3 and off to their best start since the 2002-03 season. Their latest win came on Thursday when De\u2019Aaron Fox posted a huge triple-double and gashed Atlanta\u2019s defense to fuel a 146-115 rout. That\u2019s now five straight victories for Sacramento, a franchise that has been starving for relevancy and production from the significant amount of lottery picks and former collegiate stars on its roster. Fox stuffed the stat sheet against the Hawks with 31 points, 15 assists and 10 rebounds. The 20-year-old became the youngest player in NBA history to post a 30-15-10 line, passing Magic Johnson (21) and Michael Jordan (21). He also joined LeBron James as the only players in NBA history to record a 30-point triple-double before turning 21. It\u2019s not just Fox feasting, as the Kings have received contributions throughout the team. Buddy Hield appears to be emerging into a consistent scorer. Nemanja Bjelica has been one of the best offseason additions. Willie Cauley-Stein is making impressions and No. 2 overall pick Marvin Bagley III is off to a strong start. Sacramento currently has the fifth-best record in the Western Conference to go along with a top-10 offense overall. Just like the Kings\u2019 talent, however, the season is young.

I am thrilled to see the NBA All-Star Game coming in 2022 with an expected $100 million economic impact to our region. Once again, our city and county will shine on the national and international stage and our businesses and residents will reap the rewards.\u201d NBA All-Star oncourt events will tip off on Friday, Feb. 18 at Quicken Loans Arena with MTN DEW ICE Rising Stars, an annual showcase for top rookies and second-year NBA players.

The game will be broadcast worldwide in 215 countries and territories and in 50 languages. NBA ALL-STAR HISTORY IN CLEVELAND Cleveland last hosted NBA All-Star in 1997, when the league celebrated its 50th anniversary season. The NBA\u2019s 50 Greatest Players were honored during a ceremony at halftime of the All-Star Game. The 1997 NBA All-Star Game featured a historic performance from Charlotte Hornets forward Glen Rice, who set an All-Star record for points in a quarter with 20 in the third period. Rice finished with 26 points to lead the Eastern Conference past the Western Conference 132-120, earning MVP honors. Also at NBA All-Star 1997, Los Angeles Lakers rookie guard Kobe Bryant won the Slam Dunk Contest, Chicago Bulls guard Steve Kerr triumphed in the Three-Point Contest and Philadelphia 76ers rookie guard Allen Iverson was named MVP of Rising Stars. The Cavaliers also hosted NBA All-Star 1981, at Richfield Coliseum, the team\u2019s home from 1974-94. Behind MVP Tiny Archibald of the Boston Celtics, the East defeated the West 123-120."},{"id":37686,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/hang-time-podcast-derrick-rose-toronto-raptors","date":"2018-11-01","title":"Hang Time Podcast: Derrick Rose scores 50 + latest from Toronto after 7-1 start","content":"John Schuhmann and I discuss Derrick Rose\u2019s throwback 50-point performance, Klay Thompson\u2019s 52-point show on Monday, and the strong start by the Sacramento Kings.

But given the circumstances and the atmosphere at the Manhattan health club where his newest NBA team voluntarily had assembled, that almost certainly would have spoiled the mood. \u201cBasically there were no X\u2019s and O\u2019s,\u201d Budenholzer said. \u201cThat was a little bit frustrating: \u2018Hey, they\u2019re all together \u2026\u2019 \u201d But this wasn\u2019t Budenholzer\u2019s party. The Bucks \u2014 about 17 or 18 of the players along with their new coach and his staff \u2014 had been invited to New York in August by what started as a group text between Giannis Antetokounmpo, Khris Middleton and Matthew Dellavedova. It was their stab at the sort of offseason workout-and-bonding thing James Harden did with members of the Houston Rockets in the Bahamas, that LeBron James had been doing for years in Miami. It was borne from an excitement to get going with Budenholzer, a new coach with a new system to be played out in a new building in 2018-19, and a realization that \u2014 with so many changes and adjustments coming their way \u2014 starting their trek along the learning curve could only help. They started on a Monday, wrapped on a Thursday and will carry those four days through the weeks and months to come. Potentially well into May. \u201cThe turnout was phenomenal,\u201d Budenholzer told NBA.com before his team faced Toronto this week. \u201cThe thing that was interesting for me was, they just played pickup ball. It was a good opportunity for me and the assistant coaches to just watch them. \u201cThen we went to a couple dinners and spent time together. You hope that organic bonding and team time pays off. It was hard as a coaching staff to sit back and watch. But you get to kind of learn them, certainly on the court and then off the court too, some quality time.\u201d Budenholzer made no secret of his plans for the team and how he wants them to play when he was hired in May . A few of the players, such as Sterling Brown, got a glimpse and a feel at NBA Summer League. Still, it came together in New York, in the gym and over pasta in Little Italy, or wherever else they ate. \u201cEverybody in one place to play and learn each other before camp started,\u201d Brown said. \u201cIt was just getting up and down, playing 5-on-5. They [the coaches] were getting a chance to see what we can do, learn our strengths. As well as us just talking to them on the side, different things they like and their tendencies.\u201d Said big man John Henson: \u201cEverybody had to go in and show what they\u2019d been working on. That\u2019s probably when the threes started flying first and [we knew] the system would be different. Me personally, that\u2019s when I started shooting threes and making \u2018em a little bit.\u201d Henson talking about 3-pointers? Yeah, that\u2019s different. The 6-foot-11 veteran was 1-for-13 on 3-pointers over his first six seasons. In Milwaukee\u2019s first seven games this season, he\u2019s already 5-for-13 . Henson always had a sweet left-handed hook shot in the paint and was strong with the tip slams and assorted put-backs. But 3-pointers? \u201cCoach Bud told me when he got hired, \u2018Work on your threes and we\u2019ll see what happens,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of been the motto: Let it fly.\u201d That\u2019s sort of how the Bucks have approached this early season. They are the NBA\u2019s only remaining unbeaten team, taking a 7-0 mark into Boston tonight . They have been having fun playing off and around Antetokounmpo, their Kia MVP candidate \u2014 and just as much fun playing without him in Monday\u2019s 124-109 victory over Toronto. The \u201cGreek Freak\u201d was cleared Wednesday from concussion protocol , the after-effects of an Aaron Gordon elbow last weekend sufficiently gone. But he goes into TD Garden for once sharing the marquee with his teammates, their coach and a style revamped and revised into something completely different. Offensively, the Bucks have been playing through a funhouse mirror. Their scoring opportunities have been pushed to the extremes, everything deep inside or way outside, with the middle almost at the point of non-existence. Their 40.6 3-point attempts per game rank second only to Houston (41.5) and account for 44.4 percent of their shots so far this season. Last season, they averaged 24.7, ranked 25th and shot threes only 29.7 percent of the time . Inside the arc, but outside the paint, things have gone in the other direction. Milwaukee\u2019s scoring on mid-range 2-pointers has dropped from 9.2 percent to just 2.6 percent. Middleton has cut his long twos from 19 percent to 2.2 percent. The success rate has followed: the Bucks are making 64 percent of their attempts within eight feet of the basket and 38.8 percent from downtown, but only 28.2 percent of the 8-to-24-footers. Defensively, their mission is straight mirror. The shots they eschew are the ones they push on opponents: Long twos, contested twos, twos shot on the move and, when that fails, tough 3-pointers with hands in shooters\u2019 faces. Budenholzer and staff have tweaked their pick-and-roll defense to draw them in, as surely as they\u2019ve altered their attack by spotting and spreading. Budenholzer found the Bucks to be more \u201cmove-in ready\u201d than some might have expected after last season\u2019s unremarkable 44-38 finish spent with Jason Kidd (23-22) and interim coach Joe Prunty (21-16). He praised GM Jon Horst, though, for surgical acquisitions such as center Brook Lopez and forward Ersan Ilyasova, a pair of \u201cstretch\u201d guys who have helped widen lanes for Antetokounmpo and guard Eric Bledsoe. A teaching aid that Budenholzer added to the team\u2019s practice court \u2014 five boxes marked in thick blue tape, fanned out around the 3-point line \u2014 is a constant reminder to the players to space themselves, something to catch their eyes even in transition. Despite the head start of the New York junket and players descending on Milwaukee soon after Labor Day, the learning, habit-building and habit-breaking continues. \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d guard Malcolm Brogdon said. \u201cWe love playing in this system. It allows us to use our IQs to make scoring cuts. But we have a tendency to overpass sometimes. We have to take the first open shot. And we had to break habits, like playing a lot of iso ball from the last couple years. It\u2019s been tough, but we have guys who don\u2019t have a lot of ego and want to play the right way.\u201d It\u2019s all predicated on Antetokounmpo, who is stronger, looks taller, has dialed up his ferocity again and is the axis of so much Milwaukee does. He literally is working in the middle of the floor, running a rut from rim to rim, cleaving opposing defenses, the ideal spot from which to find his teams\u2019 shooters. He\u2019s not a point forward as much as a point problem. Already, Indiana Pacers coach Nate McMillan and Toronto Raptors coach Nick Nurse have likened the Bucks star\u2019s rim runs to LeBron James\u2019 downhill express. \u201cThe biggest thing with him is just somehow stopping the freight train in transition,\u201d Nurse said. \u201cHe comes off and the floor is spread, and it\u2019s like [James] and him keep on coming. They go right through your numbers and you\u2019ve got to stand in there and take it.\u201d As Antetokounmpo said previously: \u201cI can do a lot of things in the middle.\u201d He\u2019s averaging 25 points, 14.2 rebounds and 5.7 assists in 30.7 minutes and his 35.1 usage percentage leads the NBA . That\u2019s why the most uncharacteristic of their victories \u2014 yet potentially the most significant \u2014 was their handling of Toronto Monday at Fiserv Forum. Neither Antetokounmpo nor the Raptors\u2019 Kawhi Leonard (rest) played, but the outcome looked eerily like a typical \u201cGreek Freak\u201d production. Cushy final margin, no lead changes after the first quarter, 19-for-45 3-point shooting for the home team and a forward \u2014 Ilyasova this time \u2014 contributing 19 points and 10 rebounds in 23 minutes. No, Ilyasova didn\u2019t initiate offense with end-to-end dribbles. But what Budenholzer\u2019s calls the \u201crandomness\u201d of his team\u2019s offense was on full display. Thon Maker, at 7-foot-1, was the big guy making the unlikely 3-pointers. The Bucks\u2019 guards grabbed 23 of the team\u2019s 49 defensive rebounds. Randomness isn\u2019t a term coaches traditionally embrace \u2014 it\u2019s too subject to whim and sounds undisciplined \u2014 but with the stigma of missed 3-pointers all but gone from the NBA, it reflects, offensively, the reactive nature of \u201ctake what the defense gives you\u201d and always allows for that vaunted extra pass. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of funny,\u201d Budenholzer said, \u201cit\u2019s really more about everybody participating and everybody being involved. The great Chicago teams when Tex Winter and Phil Jackson were there \u2014 the triangle was just amazing. I know Michael Jordan was great, but everybody touched the ball, everybody cut, everybody moved. It was just so hard to guard. And some of the really good San Antonio teams.\u201d (On which Budenholzer was coach Gregg Popovich\u2019s right-hand man, of course.) \u201cPhilosophically it\u2019s what I gravitate toward. Similar in Atlanta. Now trying to make it make sense for this group of guys.\u201d Randomness also means tolerating some bad stuff, though Milwaukee has had only one game so far where it shot worse than the 33.3 percent from the arc (13 of 43, 30.2) in last week\u2019s home victory over Philadelphia. \u201cOh yeah. sometimes it\u2019s ugly,\u201d Budenholzer said. \u201cIt looks terrible and you\u2019ve got your hands over your eyes. I\u2019d say you tend to have a few more turnovers than you\u2019d like (17.1 per game, third-most). But you see a lot of growth in players and a lot of confidence come with players. \u201cThat\u2019s going to give Giannis an even better chance to be special. The better we can make the people around him, that\u2019s going to make him rise more than anything.\u201d And with him, the franchise. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

If you\u2019re like me, there\u2019s nothing you love more than watching the first-year players find their way in the NBA. This will be my 11th season covering the rookies (first for SI.com, now here) and it has yet to grow old. The beauty of covering rookies is that every season provides something that will surprise you. There are so many storylines, so many angles to keep an eye on. Players break out. Players flop. Players live up to expectations. Players fail to live up to expectations. Players have incredible performances. Players have awful performances. But yet, night in and night out, across virtually every arena, there\u2019s something intriguing and exciting to watch. Each week, in this space, I\u2019ll do my best to highlight the Top 5 rookies (and another five just missing the cut) and rank them on the Ladder according to their standing on the season. Last year, the Ladder was primarily a video released each week with my Top 5 rookies, but this season I\u2019ll be able to write a little more and dig deeper into the ups and downs of the rookie class. So, with all that said, here\u2019s the inaugural Rookie Ladder for the 2018-19 season. ( All stats through Wednesday, Oct. 31 ) * * * Through the first week, Doncic has been the most consistently entertaining rookie and it\u2019s difficult to pick one aspect of his game to feature. Do you like step-back 3-pointers? Check. Do you dig floaters in the lane? You\u2019ll see several a game. How about court vision and slick passes? He\u2019s got it. The thing with Doncic is he looks so comfortable being the Mavs\u2019 leader, and the season is just two weeks old. He\u2019s already the team\u2019s leading scorer (19.6 ppg, first among rookies ) and put up 31 points and eight rebounds in a tough 113-108 OT loss in San Antonio on Monday. The only knock on Doncic so far are the turnovers (4.0 against 4.4 apg), but that should improve as he acclimates to his teammates and the style of play in the NBA. If you haven\u2019t tuned in to a Mavs game, now\u2019s the time. Doncic is must-see TV and earns the top rung to start the season. The No. 1 overall pick has lived up to the hype early in the season, averaging a double-double (16.9 ppg, 10 rpg) while giving Phoenix the dominating inside presence it has long desired. Devin Booker is dealing with a sore hamstring, but when the pair has been on the floor together, they\u2019ve been a tough duo to defend. Drop down on the massive Ayton? He\u2019ll kick it to Booker or his other shooters. Defend Booker on the perimeter? He\u2019ll drop it in to get Ayton going inside. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be a force down there the whole season,\u201d Booker said. \u201cI feel like teams are going to have to figure out what they want to do.\u201d Ayton is shooting at a 61.6-percent clip (85.7 pct. on free throws) and he\u2019s fourth among rookies in assists (3.3 apg), so it\u2019s clear he\u2019s comfortable passing out of the post. He\u2019s going to be in the Kia Rookie of the Year chatter all season and while he may not be as exciting as Doncic and Young, his efficiency and dominance should give him a great shot at claiming the award. The No. 5 pick has been hit-or-miss in the early going, but his big games have been impressive. In the Hawks\u2019 third game of the season, Young erupted for 35 points and 11 assists, while going 6-for-14 from 3-point land in a 131-117 loss to the Grizzlies . He\u2019s only the third rookie since 2000 to top 35 and 10. The other two? LeBron James and Stephen Curry. But Young followed that outburst with a stretch of three games in which he was 11-for-37, going 2-for-15 from beyond the arc. This is likely what we\u2019re going to see from Young throughout this season \u2014 briliant performances followed by typical rookie struggles. Still, it\u2019s clear Young can play. He leads all rookies in assists ( 6.6 per game ) and he\u2019s not turning the ball over at a terrible rate (3.0 per game). The Hawks are Young\u2019s team, so he\u2019ll have every opportunity to shine, which should keep him high on the Ladder all season. At 5-3, the Kings are one of the early surprises of the season, and Bagley has been a big reason for their success. Working with the second unit, Bagley has been key as Sacramento has looked to push the tempo. While Bagley was more of a typical post-up player at Duke, he\u2019s best when running the floor and finishing in transition. The Kings are winning, and Bagley is putting up decent numbers in just 23.3 minutes per game. Among rookies, he\u2019s currently fourth in scoring (12.4 ppg) and second in rebounding (7.1 rpg), while shooting 53.4 percent overall and 5-for-9 from 3-point land. His most notable performance came Oct. 23 in a 126-112 loss to the Nuggets in which he finished with 20 points, nine rebounds and five blocks in 32 minutes. Bagley could see his minutes increase as he improves, but he\u2019s making the most of his minutes so far, which should keep him high on the Ladder. Okogie is one of the season\u2019s early surprises as he\u2019s made the most of his opportunity in Minnesota. After not seeing the floor in the Wolves\u2019 first two games, Okogie got his chance when Jimmy Butler rested a game, then saw heavy action with Andrew Wiggins out with a quad contusion. In six games, the No. 20 pick out of Georgia Tech is averaging 9.8 points ( 8th among rookies ) and 5.3 rebounds ( sixth ). More notably, he leads rookies in steals per game (1.7), which will certainly endear him to coach Tom Thibodeau. \u201cYou just like him,\u201d Thibodeau said after Okogie scored 17 to help the Wolves beat the Lakers 124-120 on Monday . \u201cYou just like his energy, and he makes things happen.\u201d He\u2019s struggling from the floor (38.3 percent), but his energy and defense could make him hard to bench once Wiggins returns. For now, though, he\u2019s earned his rung on the Ladder. Jaren Jackson, Memphis Grizzlies Through six games, Jackson is averaging 11.5 points ( 6th among rookies ), 5.2 rebounds ( 7th ) and 1.0 blocks ( 4th ) in 22.7 minutes. Scored in double-digits in the first four games, but has just 10 points in last two games while seeing playing time dip due to foul trouble. Mo Bamba, Orlando Magic Fifth in rebounding (5.4 rpg) and leads rookies in blocks at 2.0 per game ( ninth among all players ). Also managing to put up almost two 3s a night (at a 38.5 percent clip) while seeing around 20 minutes of action. Wendell Carter, Jr., Chicago Bulls Fourth in rebounding (6.3 rpg) in just over 25 minutes per game. Field goal percentage down for a big man (43.6 percent) but he\u2019s scored in double-digits in last three games. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, LA Clippers Has been solid as Clippers\u2019 backup. His ability to get to the rim and defend has earned him a spot in the rotation and even crunch-time minutes. Averaging 8.4 points and 3.6 assists ( 4th ), while picking up a steal per game. Collin Sexton, Cleveland Cavaliers Has scored in double-digits in his last four games, averaging 14.3 points in that span. His ability to get to the line (nine times in each of last two games) may be his best feature. His career-best 17 points helped Cleveland get its first win Tuesday night , and it will be interesting to see how his role changes under interim coach Larry Drew. * * * Send any questions or comments to my email or find me on Twitter @drewpackham .

That is perhaps one of the main lessons to take away from Derrick Rose\u2019s career-best ( and highly emotional ) 50-point outburst in a thrilling 128-125 Minnesota Timberwolves win against the Utah Jazz on Wednesday night. From media members to current and fellow NBA players , the outpouring of happiness for Rose after his big game was one of the biggest stories in all of sports last night. After all the surgeries, comebacks and heartbreak Rose has endured throughout his career since winning Kia MVP honors in 2010-11 , his has been a story of both endurance and disappointment. None of that mattered last night, though, as he delivered a game that will go down in Timberwolves (and NBA) lore as legendary.

He had not scored more than 30 points in a game since Jan. 18, 2017 , when he dropped 30 points on the Boston Celtics in a 117-106 win. His last game with 40 or more points came seven years ago \u2014 May 6, 2011 \u2014 when he poured in 44 points against the Atlanta Hawks in a 99-82 win by the Chicago Bulls. As detailed above, it had been a while since Rose scored 40 or more in a game. And, per Elias Sports, the time between Rose\u2019s last game with 40-plus points and his most recent was the fifth-longest gap in NBA history.

All the surgeries. All the rehabs. All the frustration and setbacks. And overcoming all that, a renewed joy and triumph in the game stirred Derrick Rose on Wednesday night. Tears rolled down his face as he exited the court. Given the ups-and-downs of his injury-plagued career, you can\u2019t blame him for becoming emotional after his career-high, 50-point night carried the shorthanded Minnesota Timberwolves to a 128-125 win over the Utah Jazz. For good measure, the 2011 Kia MVP sank two free throws with 13.8 seconds remaining to seal the win and secure his 50 points. He scored when it counted, dropping 34 points in the second half, including 15 in the tight fourth quarter. \u201cJust a lot of hard work put into my craft,\u201d said Rose in the postgame news conference. He expressed being comfortable with coach Tom Thibodeau and the Wolves. He said Thibodeau predicts that the final stages of his career will be special. \u201cIt\u2019s all about rhythm. \u2026 Just playing basketball and being a happy player, actually.\u201d It was a gratifying and joyous \u2014 even vindicating \u2014 moment for a player who less than a year ago was considering retirement after suffering an ankle injury with the Cavaliers on top of his knee problems. Players around the NBA from LeBron James to Dwyane Wade reacted to Rose\u2019s emotional accomplishment. They understand what he\u2019s gone through. Rose missed only a handful of games over his first three NBA seasons with the Bulls, a stretch that ultimately earned him the MVP award in 2011. But he played in only 39 games the following season and tore his left ACL in Chicago\u2019s first-round playoff series, which caused him to miss the entire 2012-13 season. After the extensive rehab and lost season, 10 games into the 2013-14 season, Rose tore his right knee meniscus and missed the rest of that season. Although Rose showed flashes during the three mostly healthy seasons that followed, he rarely had the same spring or burst. Then Rose tore the meniscus in his left knee during the 2016-17 season with the Knicks, forcing him to undergo knee surgery for the fourth time in his career, which appeared to be in jeopardy. Rejuvenated this season after his reunion with Thibodeau, who coached him with the Bulls, Rose is averaging 30 minutes per game of playing time with 14.3 points, 4.0 rebounds and 4.9 assists. The Timberwolves rested disgruntled All-Star Jimmy Butler as they hosted the Jazz , which may have inadvertently helped Rose to his career night. Coach Tom Thibodeau called it \u201cprecautionary rest\u201d because of general soreness. This raised eyebrows given the team\u2019s day off Tuesday, and generated speculation that Butler is entering the hold-out phase of his plan to be traded. Despite Butler\u2019s good on-court performance (in games, at least) this season, Butler is hurting the Minnesota organization and diminishing his trade value around the league, says NBA writer and analyst Brian Geltzeiler. In six games this season, Butler is averaging 22.5 points, 5.3 rebounds, 3.3 assists and 3.0 steals. He\u2019s played a leading role in the Wolves\u2019 three wins thus far. It\u2019s wasn\u2019t a buzzer-beater, but it was about as close as you can get. Paul Millsap rebounded and put back an errant 15-foot jump shot from Nikola Jokic with 0.1 second left to give the Nuggets a 108-107 victory over the Chicago Bulls in overtime. Jokic finished with 22 points and 12 rebounds and Millsap\u2019s putback gave him 19 as the Nuggets improved to 6-1. Fans around the NBA (and LeBron as Jason) weren\u2019t afraid to don frightful or imaginative attire. The Miami Heat even had their own \u201cHouse of Horrors!\u201d And several Warriors and Lakers arrived at their respective arenas in costumes, including James and Klay Thompson. It was Curry\u2019s turn to take the spotlight for the Warriors after Klay Thompson\u2019s record-breaking performance of 14 made threes on Monday night. In a performance that most players would consider the pinnacle of their season, Curry scored 37 points on 12-for-20 shooting, including seven 3-pointers in the Warriors\u2019 131-121 win . Just another day at the office for the best shooter in the game. Only four 3-point attempts missed their mark. Pelicans All-Star Anthony Davis returned to the lineup after missing two games with an elbow sprain.

Butler told ESPN he planned to attend the game against the Jazz at the Target Center and travel with the team on its five-game road trip that begins Friday at Golden State. Butler told the network he would play against the Warriors and disputed speculation that he was sitting out Wednesday in protest of the lack of action by the Wolves on his desire to be dealt elsewhere. \u201cBecause my body is hurting and I don\u2019t want to go out there and risk an injury, people make stuff up?\u201d Butler said. Thibodeau was noncommittal when asked if Butler would join the team on the trip. Butler scored 32 points in 37 minutes in Minnesota\u2019s win Monday against the Los Angeles Lakers , including all five of his 3-point attempts in the fourth quarter. Players didn\u2019t practice Tuesday, however, which made the need to sideline the four-time All-Star shooting guard Wednesday peculiar. Butler did not travel with the team to Dallas for the Oct. 20 game, but that planned absence from a defeat by the Mavericks came after he played the night before in the home opener. The Wolves also ruled point guard Jeff Teague out Wednesday with a sore left knee. He bruised it during the game against the Lakers when he banged it against LeBron James\u2019 knee. Thibodeau said Teague had precautionary X-rays taken after reporting soreness and swelling. He also said small forward Andrew Wiggins \u201cshould be ready\u201d to play Wednesday after missing three straight games with a strained right quadriceps. The absences of Butler and Wiggins from their spots on the wing have allowed rookie Josh Okogie to see extended playing time. Okogie, the first-round draft pick out of Georgia Tech, went 6-for-17 against the Lakers for a career-best 17 points. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be tough, but we\u2019ve got that next-man-up mentality,\u201d power forward Taj Gibson said. \u201cSo far Josh has been a great surprise for us.\u201d"},{"id":37726,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/pelicans-davis-game-time-decision-vs-warriors","date":"2018-10-31","title":"Pelicans star Anthony Davis (elbow) to play vs. Warriors","content":" All-Star Anthony Davis will return tonight for the New Orleans Pelicans after missing the last two games because of an elbow injury.

Howard missed all of training camp, Washington\u2019s entire exhibition schedule and all of the team\u2019s games to date. The Wizards are mired in a 1-6 start, including a listless 107-95 road loss to the Memphis Grizzlies last night.

News of Love\u2019s injury circulated earlier this week and initial reports had him slated to miss more than a month because of it. Love confirmed the injury on Tuesday and said he will miss at least several weeks because of a painful big toe injury on his left foot. He told reporters the injury has bothered him since the preseason and he recently had trouble walking. He also did not rule out surgery. Before last night\u2019s 136-114 home win against the Atlanta Hawks, Love was wearing a walking boot. Per The Associated Press, Love said he had an MRI and visited visited Dr. Martin O\u2019Malley at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York. He was told to rest the injury and there\u2019s no clear timetable when he\u2019ll suit up again. \u201cI would like to get back obviously as soon as possible,\u201d Love said. \u201cI had high hopes for the season. I know it\u2019s been off to a really rocky start, but the more I can be out there and help this team, the better. So I\u2019m hoping to get out there as quickly as possible and hoping that it\u2019s only two or three weeks.\u201d The Cavs issued a statement Tuesday regarding Love\u2019s injury that said: \u201cCavaliers forward Kevin Love continues to receive treatment and further evaluation for his sore left foot.

A continuing treatment plan is being developed, including a timeline for his return to basketball activity. His status will be updated when his treatment protocol and return to play timeline is established.\u201d The injury is one that Love does not even know how to classify, but it did occur in the Cavs\u2019 preseason opener against the Boston Celtics on Oct. 2. It kept him out for the team\u2019s final three preseason games and Cleveland\u2019s last three games.

I was trying to fake it around you guys in the locker room and not show too much, but it was the other 21 or so hours out of the day where I was in a lot of discomfort.

What can you attribute to this near-perfect start?  * * * Steve Aschburner :  How \u2018bout a sense of gratitude and the realization that this incredible experience they\u2019re all enjoying isn\u2019t going to last forever? It\u2019d be nice to think the Warriors all realize their specialness is temporary and inevitably will end, either fractiously or through sports\u2019 natural life cycle. These teams that think the expectations and pressure to win represents some sort of burden, well, they haven\u2019t lost in a while and have forgotten what that is like. My sense is Golden State went through the anticipated, earthly challenges of managing their collective greatness and has come out the other side, where they get to enjoy this until, one day, it ends. Because it always ends (aside from Gregg Popovich\u2019s obvious deal with the devil). Shaun Powell :  Perhaps deep down, the Warriors realize that there\u2019s a decent possibility of change next summer so they\u2019re showing a sense of purpose a little earlier than usual. Or maybe the boredom stretch is right around the corner. Also: They\u2019re getting a kick out of taking turns lighting up the league. First Steph, then KD, then Klay, each trying to one-up the other. All in fun, of course (at least for the Warriors). John Schuhmann :  Talent, of course. At times this season, the Warriors haven\u2019t looked that sharp, but Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant have the ability to make something out of nothing more than anybody else in the league. They would have lost in Utah had Durant not kept them close in the first half with his unparalleled ability to simply get buckets. Still, they are defending better than they did last season, when they ranked 28th defensively in October . There\u2019s an understanding that they let things slip a little too much last season and Draymond Green said earlier this month that, with the departures of their veteran bigs, there\u2019s more to \u201cmake work\u201d this year. At the same time, this group knows who they are and how to win.  Sekou Smith :  Superior talent and exquisite team chemistry make it much easier for the Warriors to flip the switch and remember that they are the universe\u2019s best basketball outfit. The moves made around them, however, served as the perfect reminder to coach Steve Kerr\u2019s crew that their margin for error isn\u2019t as great as it should be. They had to dig out a Game 7 win on the road in the Western Conference finals last season to collect that second straight title and third in the last four seasons. That danger was real. The Warriors don\u2019t look like a team interested in testing that fate again. They recognize the importance of controlling their own destiny in their chase for another ring. When you have the firepower they possess in Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson, why not let it loose as early and often as possible, just so there is no doubt as to who is running the league right now. This hot start is a reminder that the dynasty will not slow down anytime soon (at least until there is another parade in Oakland).

Any other coaches out there who could be feeling the heat?  * * * Steve Aschburner :  This is as scientific a question as we get at the Blogtable lab. The methodology for answering: Work from the bottom of the standings up. Compare records to expectations. Factor in the years and money remaining on the coach\u2019s contract, and voila! So in the West, I\u2019m wondering about the Lakers\u2019 Luke Walton (given the impatient LeBron factor) and OKC\u2019s Billy Donovan . Washington\u2019s Scott Brooks has an underachieving team on his hands in the East but three years on his contract. None of the other teams under water in that conference is fretting, with either low expectations, newish coaches or, in Miami\u2019s case, a proven commodity and one of the league\u2019s best. Shaun Powell :  Better keep an eye on Scott Brooks in Washington , especially if the Wizards go in the tank during their upcoming homestand. Not that he\u2019s the issue \u2014 the Wizards have awful roster chemistry \u2014 but you know how this usually ends. John Schuhmann :  There are a few other teams off to disappointing starts, but I won\u2019t speculate on the job status of any coaches , which can be affected by internal relationships or the coach\u2019s contract status as much as it is by on-court success or failure.  Sekou Smith :  Cleveland\u2019s panic move to fire Tyronn Lue just six games into this season should not set off a vigorous round of coach purging. This was a very specific situation the Cavaliers were dealing with, what with the departure of LeBron James in free agency. That said, seats could be heating up in Washington and Minnesota . The Wizards have been disappointing early on and the Timberwolves are still operating with the uncertainty of the Jimmy Butler situation hanging over everything. As we all know, a coach\u2019s fate often rides the frantic rails of an owner or general manager\u2019s whims. So seats that aren\u2019t particularly warm now could heat up depending on what transpires between now and Christmas Day.

But what Houston is going through is more than a right-now problem. First, the switcheroo in its ratings \u2014 essentially mirror images of last year\u2019s, from a plus of 8.4 in 2017-18 to a minus 9.6 now \u2014 is elevator-shaft stuff. Naturally, since James Harden has missed two games, the offense is sputtering. But the defense? That became an issue when Trevor Ariza and Luc Mbah a Moute left in the summer. And given the expectations \u2014 and four home losses by an average of more than 17 points \u2014 PANIC CAN\u2019T BE FAR AWAY! If I were Minnesota, I\u2019d be on the phone constantly with Rockets GM Daryl Morey, because his team\u2019s need for Jimmy Butler is growing by the day, presumably dragging the price right with it. Shaun Powell :  Given that the stakes are higher in Houston \u2014 nobody with a basketball pulse figured OKC would compete for a title this year \u2014 the choice is easily the Rockets . They lost defensive coach Jeff Bzdelika, Luc mbah a Moute and Trevor Ariza and replaced those defensive specialists with Carmelo Anthony and Michael Carter-Williams. They\u2019ve gone from No. 7 in Defensive Rating to No. 24 this season , which might be the new normal for them this season. Not sure if the Rockets will be one game from the Finals again this season. John Schuhmann :  After another ugly loss on Tuesday, it\u2019s got to be Houston , because, with the four-year, $160 million contract they just gave a 33-year-old Chris Paul, they\u2019re all-in on being a title contender. They\u2019ve been without one starting guard or the other during this four-game losing streak, but they were 21-11 with one of the two and not the other last season. There are a couple of real concerns even when they\u2019re completely healthy. No. 1: They lost too much defensively with the departures of Trevor Ariza, Luc Mbah a Moute and assistant coach Jeff Bzdelik, and the player departures have forced them to play forwards that just aren\u2019t good enough on end of the floor or the other. No. 2: How good they were in isolation last season (setting a record, by a wide margin, for iso efficiency) was unsustainable. You can be sure that GM Daryl Morey won\u2019t stand pat and that the Rockets\u2019 roster will not be the same in March as it is now. Maybe they can add two-way talent by trading a bunch of picks (going more all-in than they already are), but that\u2019s easier said than done.  Sekou Smith :  The Rockets by a mile. Given the immense expectations that accompanied them into training camp, both internally and beyond, their early-season struggles dwarf those plaguing the Oklahoma City Thunder. The Rockets tweaked what was beautiful team chemistry from a season ago for absolutely no reason at all. We will never know what might have happened in the Western Conference finals if Chris Paul hadn\u2019t gone down with a hamstring injury late in Game 5. And the Rockets made sure of it when they let perfect fits Trevor Ariza and Luc Mbah a Moute go and added Carmelo Anthony. You can dive into the metrics all you want, but this is a chemistry problem that has nothing to do with crunching numbers. The Rockets sauntered into this season like a team that won something last season. That\u2019s a dangerous space to be occupy in a sport where the championship window for most contenders often vanishes quickly. The Rockets are searching for a quick fix (like a deal for Jimmy Butler in exchange for four first-round picks) in an effort to turn things around. They better hurry up and figure it out before the hole they\u2019ve dug for themselves gets deeper."},{"id":37718,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/interim-coach-larry-drew-cavs-contract-future","date":"2018-10-31","title":"Report: Conract talks between Drew, Cavs stall out","content":" The Cleveland Cavaliers named Larry Drew as their interim coach after they fired Tyronn Lue on Sunday following the team\u2019s 0-6 start. He led the Cavs to their first win of the season last night, a 136-114 pasting of the Atlanta Hawks . Drew has asked for a restructured contract and guarantees if he\u2019s going to take over the rebuilding team, but as of Tuesday evening, the Cavaliers had not given him any. ESPN\u2019s Brian Windhorst and Adrian Wojnarowski reported early Wednesday morning that talks between the Cavs and Drew have had no traction and the sides could be headed for a stalemate . Before Cleveland hosted Atlanta, the 60-year-old Drew said \u201cthere are no updates, which I\u2019m very disappointed about.\u201d Drew said he assured the Cavaliers he would remain professional during the negotiations. \u201cWe\u2019re actually kind of just weighing our options on [it not working out],\u201d Drew said. \u201cI really hope that we can get something resolved, but moving forward, I know there is a possibility that it may not be resolved. \u201cI would never quit. I won\u2019t do that. As I said, I remain professional and will continue to do my job. I was told that there could be a possibility of them just bringing in somebody else to finish out the year and then I can move back into my original position as an associate head coach.\u201d Drew said the Cavaliers have told him it\u2019s possible they\u2019ll bring in a full-time replacement for Lue. If that happens, he would slide back to his assistant\u2019s role. Per Chris Fedor of Cleveland.com , Drew is looking for more money and job security before taking on a bigger role full time. Fedor also reports that bringing in a new coach from the outside is not the Cavs\u2019 preferred route. \u201cObviously LD has been a veteran coach. He knows what he\u2019s doing,\u201d Tristan Thompson said after Tuesday\u2019s win. \u201cT Lue has learned a lot from him, being his mentor. We knew with LD coaching you\u2019re going to get an experienced coach who\u2019s been in the playoffs and has won a lot of games. He\u2019s been a great game manager and you saw that when he went (9-1) last year.

ESPN\u2019s Brian Windhorst and Adrian Wojnarowski report Smith was informed yesterday that he would be removed from the rotation and not receive guarantees about playing time. Smith did not play in last night\u2019s game vs. Atlanta. In addition, ESPN reports the Cavs may be looking to deal Korver this season as well.

After getting to the doorstep of The Finals last season, the Rockets had hopes for another season as the Western Conference\u2019s best team in the regular season and a lengthy playoff run. Those things are still possible for Houston, of course, but their slow start to 2018-19 has \u2014 if nothing else \u2014 delayed that timeline for it. After last night\u2019s 104-85 wire-to-wire loss to the visiting Portland Trail Blazers, the Rockets are 1-5 and tied with the rebuilding Phoenix Suns for the West\u2019s worst record. The loss was the Rockets\u2019 fourth straight in their second game without James Harden, who is nursing a hamstring injury. Houston has rarely been competitive this season, dropping their four home games by an average of more than 17 points. Coach Mike D\u2019Antoni told reporters last night he can tell his team has lost much of the mojo that made the 2017-18 special for Houston. \u201cLast year, we played well. Right now, we\u2019re playing like crap,\u201d Rockets coach Mike D\u2019Antoni said Tuesday night . \u201cWe\u2019ll look. We\u2019ll fight it. Not making shots, not making foul shots, not making layups.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s hard to explain sometimes. We lost our swagger. We\u2019re on our heels. When you\u2019re desperate, it\u2019s good on defense because your hair should be on fire, but it\u2019s bad on offense. Tonight, it was like we were pretty good defensively for most of the game, but offensively, we weren\u2019t calm and didn\u2019t have that poise and just didn\u2019t hit anything for a while.\u201d The Blazers took a 51-36 lead at halftime and, by early in the third quarter, had built a 20-point lead from which they never really looked back. Overall, the Rockets lacked rhythm on offense and had poor communication on defense, a trait that has marked Houston\u2019s play during its slow start to the season. The Rockets have struggled from 3-point range \u2014 a hallmark of their success last season \u2014 and on Tuesday made just 10 of 43 3-pointers and shot 32.3 percent overall. Guard Chris Paul led Houston with 17 points and nine assists in his second game back after a two-game suspension for his role in a fight with the Los Angeles Lakers. Harden\u2019s availability for this weekend\u2019s games against the Brooklyn Nets and Chicago Bulls seems in doubt and forward James Ennis has been out three games with a hamstring injury, too. Additionally, center Nene, who hasn\u2019t played this season, remains out indefinitely with a strained right calf strain. \u201cAin\u2019t nobody going to feel sorry for us, know what I mean?\u201d Paul said after the game . \u201cWe don\u2019t feel sorry for ourselves. We\u2019ve got to get better.\u201d D\u2019Antoni is was careful not to get too doom-and-gloom after the loss, though, and remains optimistic about Houston turning things around. \u201cI\u2019ll ask the analytical guys, but I think we\u2019re still in it mathematically,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said. \u201cWe\u2019ll figure it out, but we\u2019ve got to play well. The sooner, the better. \u201cI\u2019m down like everybody else, but I haven\u2019t lost my faith. I know we\u2019ll get this done.

When Bloch first met with then-NBA Commissioner Walter Kennedy about the prospect of an expansion franchise in Arizona, Kennedy\u2019s first reaction was not promising. \u201cPhoenix? You must be crazy. Phoenix will never support pro basketball.\u201d While others also doubted Phoenix\u2019s viability as an NBA city, Bloch would not take \u201cNo\u201d for an answer. He saw Phoenix as a growing market and knew the potential that it had to support an NBA team and urged Kennedy to take a serious look at the city. On Jan. 22, 1968, it was announced that the NBA approved expansion franchises in Phoenix and Milwaukee. Bloch, and the rest of the Phoenix ownership group, successfully brought the first professional sports franchise to the state of Arizona. They maintained ownership until 1987, when they sold the franchise to a group led by Jerry Colangelo, who had been hired as the team\u2019s first general manager back in 1968. \u201cRichard was a key person in the development of the NBA,\u201d said NBA Commissioner Emeritus David J. Stern upon hearing of Bloch\u2019s death on Tuesday. \u201c Not just because he brought basketball to Phoenix and opened up the NBA\u2019s southern strategy, but because he was designated by Larry O\u2019Brien to lead the way to solving very difficult issues. \u201cWhen Larry wanted to solve the [Oscar] Robertson litigation, he appointed Dick, among others, to a committee to do that. When he wanted to be involved in collective bargaining, he would use Dick. Dick became a point man on every issue for the NBA\u2019s growth leading to his being the chairman of the Board [of Governors] from 1983 to 1986. He was a vital, vital catalyst for the growth of the NBA.\u201d Stern, who was appointed as NBA commissioner in 1984, said having Bloch as chairman of the Board of Governors was invaluable to him during his transition to the new role. \u201cSomebody was there when I was appointed commissioner who had been through all of the issues that I was going to be tasked with,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was a source of knowledge and sometimes comfort and sometimes just plain laughter because he had a wonderful sense of humor. He was very much a mentor to me when I became commissioner. I can\u2019t say how much he meant to me as a businessman and as a friend and how I mourn his death.\u201d During Bloch\u2019s tenure as owner of the Suns, the team went from an expansion franchise with no identity, to a playoff team (in their second season), to a Western Conference champion and earning their first Finals appearance in 1976, which they lost to Boston in six games. Of course, the Suns\u2019 trajectory may have been different had Bloch made a different call back in 1969. Prior to the NBA Draft, a coin flip between Phoenix and Milwaukee was held to determine which team would earn the No. 1 overall pick. The Suns earned the right to make the call and Bloch called \u201cheads\u201d \u2014 following the voting by fans in a poll by the Arizona Republic . The coin came up \u201ctails,\u201d which allowed the Bucks to draft Lew Alcindor, who would go on to become the NBA\u2019s all-time leading scorer as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. But Bloch\u2019s impact on the game goes well beyond the city of Phoenix and the Suns franchise. As Stern emphasized, he was imperative to the league\u2019s growth during the 1960s, 70s and 80s and helped lay the foundation that the game stands on today. \u201cHe was there when we decided lets not fight with the players; let\u2019s make a settlement. And that paved the way \u2014 in the settlement of Robertson v. NBA \u2014 for the literally unimpeded growth of the NBA from 1976 on. Richard was a key ingredient in that. He was a key ingredient in future expansion discussions. He was a key ingredient in encouraging us to go international. So he was absolutely involved in the growth of the NBA and you might say he was a catalyst for it.\u201d "},{"id":37749,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/warriors-option-damian-jones","date":"2018-10-30","title":"Warriors pick up fourth-year option on Jones","content":"OAKLAND, Calif.

In 16 seasons with the Spurs, Ginobili captured four NBA championships while posting a career winning percentage of .721 (762-295), which is the best winning percentage in NBA history among players who have appeared in at least 1,000 games. S elected by San Antonio with the 57th overall pick in the 1999 NBA Draft, Ginobili appeared in 1,057 career games, averaging 13.3 points, 3.8 assists, 3.5 rebounds and 1.32 steals in 25.4 minutes. He is the Spurs all-time leader in three-pointers made (1,495) and steals (1,392), while ranking third in games played (1,057), fourth in assists (4,001), fourth in free throws made (3,380) and fifth in points (14,043). Ginobili was named to the All-NBA Third Team in both 2008 and 2011 and was a two-time All-Star (2005 and 2011).

He lost 100 games faster than anyone in history, a byproduct of overseeing the Vancouver Grizzlies in their expansion season (1995-96) and into 43 games of \u201996-97. The most recent to lose his job was Tyronn Lue on Oct. 28, 2018 after Cleveland\u2019s 0-6 start. This was more of a head scratcher as he\u2019s the only coach to win a title with the Cavs. Perhaps his biggest crime was failing to give LeBron James the wrong directions to Cleveland Hopkins Airport last summer. In that span, 245 NBA coaching changes were made in Popovich\u2019s time in San Antonio. Some of them have been understandable, others questionable, in all a spinning wheel that managed to eject all from the first seat on the bench \u2026 except one. In the wake of yet another coaching switch, it\u2019s fair to wonder: how and when will it end for Popovich in San Antonio? He\u2019s closer to the finish line than the starting line, but the finish line keeps moving. Any notion of Popovich vanishing once Tim Duncan, Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili left the organization died when training camp began. Any thought of Popovich turning sour from the organization\u2019s lethal relationship last year with Kawhi Leonard was dismissed when Popovich enthusiastically prepared himself for his 23rd NBA season. And all ideas of Popovich permanently drifting to one of San Antonio\u2019s relaxing 18-hole courses as he approaches his seventh decade on the planet should be shattered with a Big Bertha driver. \u201cI don\u2019t golf,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat a waste of time. I\u2019d rather read a book. You could be doing a lot of other things.\u201d Like, keep coaching. \u201cI still enjoy this,\u201d he said, before deadpanning, \u201cbut I don\u2019t know how to do anything else.\u201d He has survived this long because he wins. With 1,201 victories and counting, he\u2019s climbing toward Don Nelson\u2019s career record of 1,335 . With a straight face, Popovich says \u201cmy ass would\u2019ve been gone a long time ago\u201d if not for great success that he constantly credits to Duncan, among others. But there\u2019s another factor in play that keeps Popovich in control of his destiny and fate. He has rarely, if ever, had to answer to anyone in the Spurs\u2019 organization, now controlled by Julianna Holt, who keeps away from the basketball operation. Almost from the jump, Popovich ruled the empire, and that has separated him from others who\u2019ve won just as many, or more, than his five championships. It\u2019s a unique setup enjoyed by almost no one in professional sports, which are often controlled by owners who act on a whim. Phil Jackson (11 titles) left two organizations, including the Los Angeles Lakers twice, not totally on his own. Pat Riley had a prickly departure from the Lakers after winning four of his five career titles there. In both cases, the lines were clearly drawn: neither Jackson nor Riley, despite steering their teams to historical runs, carried the strongest voice in the building. Neither had tenure or were immune from the type of sports diseases that can fracture even dynasties and shove great coaches out the door. When he greased the \u201cShowtime\u201d era in Los Angeles, Riley had the biggest coaching profile since Red Auerbach and his signature victory cigars. Riley was charismatic, cool and changed the coaching culture. But inside was a gym rat and a clipboard scribbler. He released the leash on the fast break and made the Lakers intoxicating. He smooth-talked Kareem Abdul-Jabbar into taking a reduced role as age began to weather the Hall of Famer.  However, the core Lakers eventually grew weary of Riley\u2019s techniques and motivational tricks. When the Lakers were upset by the Phoenix Suns in the 1990 Western Conference semifinals , Riley heard the increased volume and split. Jackson\u2019s relationship with Bulls GM Jerry Krause showed decay early in the Bulls\u2019 run for a sixth and final championship in 1997-98 . Theirs was a clash of egos and ideas. That, and a demand by Jackson for more money, led to a Bulls breakup. In the early 2000s, Jackson restored the Lakers\u2019 franchise as they became the biggest rival for Popovich\u2019s Spurs in that decade. But the chore of coaxing two high-maintenance young stars, Shaquille O\u2019Neal and Kobe Bryant, beat up Jackson and lead to his first LA exit. His second stint with the Lakers ended mainly over money, among other issues. That\u2019s all foreign to Popovich, who had the benefit of taking over a team with David Robinson, the gentlemanly All-Star who gave no gruff. And then, blessed by the basketball gods, Popovich landed Duncan, the most no-frills superstar the game has ever seen. Duncan set the tone in the locker room for professionalism, conduct and work ethic. Everyone followed, something that\u2019s lasted for almost two decades, all while making Popovich\u2019s life easier (for which Popovich is forever grateful). Duncan also drastically changed the lives of two men. When Popovich stepped down from his GM role on Dec. 10, 1996 \u2013 taking the coaching job from Bob Hill after a 3-15 start \u2014 he went 17-47. That is his only losing season to date, and the Spurs fell into the Draft lottery. There were whispers at the time \u2014 blasphemy nowadays \u2014 that he might not see another season in San Antonio. In 1997, the Boston Celtics had better odds of winning Draft lottery and its grand prize: a bank-shot-shooting center from Wake Forest (via the Virgin Islands) who could transform a franchise. Had the Celtics gotten the No. 1 pick, perhaps Rick Pitino would still be coaching in the NBA instead of lobbying for a return . As much as Popovich heaps praise on Duncan, there\u2019s no denying Popovich\u2019s role in 21 straight years of playoff trips and his own coaching immortality. The way he runs an organization envied by many, helps find talent with low Draft picks (Ginobili was taken 57th overall;  Parker at No. 28 ), generates respect from players and rivals (LeBron James, among others) and is a San Antonio landmark (along with the Alamo) is no accident. If Popovich can\u2019t control his fate, then no one in his profession ever will. Besides, under what circumstances would Popovich be forced out? Even if it\u2019s his call, how will this end? He turns 70 in January, although the only time he ages is when a referee\u2019s whistle doesn\u2019t blow his way. He survived Leonard, the only documented sign of rebellion by a Spurs\u2019 star. And the Spurs, despite losing Dejounte Murray for the season to a knee injury , might keep their playoff streak alive with DeMar DeRozan blending well with new teammates. \u201cIt\u2019s San Antonio, OK? The faces have changed but the standards are the same and the way do things are the same,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to expect the guys to do their jobs on and off the court. None of that\u2019s going to change. The way we want to approach the game and have the respect for the game is all the same, just with different people.\u201d Asked about the Murray injury and other non-Spurs-like issues, he adds: \u201cMaybe we deserve a little bad luck. We got to draft Tim Duncan 20 years ago. So, a little misfortune. We deserve it.\u201d Coaching changes since Dec. 1996 Gregg Popovich was named coach of the San Antonio Spurs on Dec. 10, 1996 . Since then, there have been 245 coaching changes league-wide. Here\u2019s a look at how many changes each team has gone through in the Popovich era. In two years, Popovich assumes control of the US Olympic basketball team . That could satisfy his urge to coach without the 82-game grind and free up time to pursue other stuff. But who knows? \u201cBeing a wine consultant going from vineyard to vineyard, or a restaurant critic going from restaurant to restaurant, that would be more fun, for sure,\u201d Popovich said. The 1996-97 season was bloody for the profession. Seven teams, including the Spurs, changed coaches in season. The Washington Bullets (now Wizards) had three coaches that season. And, in fact, Bernie Bickerstaff held two jobs that season, resigning as Denver\u2019s coach in November and was later hired by Washington in February. Cotton Fitzsimmons lasted eight games with the Phoenix Suns. Only one new coach that season lasted more than two decades. Since Popovich\u2019s debut, the Utah Jazz have had the fewest coaching changes (two), while the Grizzlies and Wizards have been on the other extreme (13 each). The Dallas Mavericks\u2019 Rick Carlisle and the Miami Heat\u2019s Erik Spoelstra own the longest tenure after Popovich (10 years each). We\u2019ll never see another like him in our lifetime. He\u2019s a coach who gets results on the court, respect in the locker room and no orders from above. Good luck finding another combination like that. The 245 coaching changes are not a number Popovich particularly likes (because he sticks up for the profession) and it\u2019s not a number that he\u2019ll add to anytime soon \u2014 if he has any say.

He made an NBA-record 14 3-pointers and had 52 points in just over 26 minutes of work in a 149-124 Warriors win . ( And if you\u2019ve got an NBA League Pass subscription, you can re-watch the game in full here .) As our Matt Petersen detailed in the latest About Last Night, Thompson\u2019s performance was epic \u2014 from his teammates egging him on to break the single-game record (held by Warriors teammate Stephen Curry) to Thompson gutting out the game despite suffering a cut above his right eye in the third quarter . Still, there are some extra statistical tidbits to consume from this game that must not be left unsaid. We\u2019re not about to do that, so dig into these numbers and factoids from a historic game in Chicago last night \u2026 * * * * This was Thompson\u2019s third career game with 50 or more points.

We missed you. We wondered where you were. Surely not behind the 5-for-36 3-point stat line through the season\u2019s first seven games. That couldn\u2019t have been you. It seemed even more impossible after you single-handedly decimated the city of Chicago on Monday night . The Windy City was pockmarked with your NBA record 14 3-pointers \u2014 a feat that surpassed some dude named Steph. By the time your work was done and Chicago was ashes, you\u2019d registered 52 points in just over 26 minutes. We tried to find out who else had tossed up 50-plus in under 27 minutes. Basketball Reference kindly informed us that there were \u201c no results that match your search .\u201d The Warriors found you, though. And kept finding you. When you were sitting on 13 triples, one away from breaking your own teammate\u2019s record, they kept feeding you. They wanted you to break the record, especially after all the \u201cWhere\u2019s Klay?\u201d inquiries tied to your unlikely cold spell. When you finally did hit that last 3, it was only after you got your forehead gashed open and wore a headband over your war wound. You made Michael Jordan\u2019s former franchise want to go hide in a hole. When you pour boiling water into a cold glass, it cracks. On Monday, you cracked the NBA universe. Again . Welcome back, man. Thompson\u2019s outburst was directly tied to Golden State\u2019s mammoth offensive output against the Bulls. The Warriors led 92-50 at halftime , good for the second-highest first-half total in NBA history, behind only Phoenix\u2019s 107 against Denver in 1990. Golden State wound up making a franchise-record 24 3-pointers, also second-most all-time. Klay\u2019s big night should also have a drastic effect on his season shot chart.   Speaking of long-awaited returns, give it up for Karl-Anthony Towns. Minnesota\u2019s recently maxed big man, who may or may not want a certain teammate out of town , tossed up 25 points and 16 rebounds in Minnesota\u2019s 124-120 win over LeBron and the Lakers. It was Towns\u2019 best game since netting 31 points against Dallas on Oct. 20 \u2014 a game in which Jimmy Butler did not play. This time, both Towns and Butler (32 points) dominated on the same night, giving Minnesota a much-needed win during an uncertain time.  L.A.\u2019s loss only emphasized an early trend on the defensive end. After Monday night, LeBron\u2019s Lakers are solidly in the league\u2019s bottom 10 in defense. Their biggest chink in the armor: The paint, where they give up the third-most points in the league (56.6 ppg) behind only Phoenix and Houston. The clash of the last two unbeaten teams wasn\u2019t exactly star-studded. Giannis Antetokounmpo (concussion) and Kawhi Leonard (rest) both sat as their respective teams matched their unblemished records in Milwaukee. The Bucks ultimately prevailed 124-109 behind double-digit scoring from seven different players. Ersan Ilyasova (19 points, 10 rebounds) was especially effective filling in for Antetokounmpo, and early Coach of the Year candidate Mike Budenholzer will surely remember that if the Bucks ever decide to play small with the Greek Freak at center. For now, Milwaukee stands alone atop the league thanks to its best start (7-0) since Lew Alcindor changed his name to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (1971).  Lance Stephenson and Gorgui Dieng are buddies, a relationship that includes having a laugh at the other\u2019s expense. Stephenson did just that when Dieng playfully shoved him after an offensive foul call. The enigmatic Laker immediately seized the opportunity to cry wolf by dramatically staggering and drawing the nearby official\u2019s attention. Dieng was assessed a technical foul, an unjust punishment in which Stephenson openly reveled. It\u2019s not just the Warriors that are on fire. The entire league is playing a caffeinated version of basketball not witnessed since the run-and-gun 1980s. In October 2017, teams scored at least 110 points on 80 different occasions. Through Monday night, teams had surpassed 110 points a whopping 114 times. That\u2019s a 42.5-percent increase, and we\u2019ve still got two days left in the month! Sacramento sporting a 3-3 record was fun, but admittedly deceiving. The Kings\u2019 three wins came at the expense of the Thunder, Grizzlies and Wizards, teams that boast a combined record of 5-11. But the Heat are good! They\u2019re a playoff team boasting continuity, a quality coach and decent offensive and defensive numbers through the first two weeks of the season. The Kings took those facts and turned them both upside-down, earning a quality 123-113 win on the road. Buddy Hield, Willie Cauley-Stein and De\u2019Aaron Fox \u2014 three of Sacramento\u2019s most important young players \u2014 each scored 20-plus. Again, it\u2019s early. The Kings were 4-3 as recently as 2014, before an injury to DeMarcus Cousins and a coaching change sent them plummeting to their usual lottery depths. The young Kings are running \u2014 they rank third in pace, third in points in the paint and fourth in fast break points \u2014 and it will be interesting to see how far they can go. Markelle Fultz had a good game . Can we reward him with some camera time without a side of fries?"},{"id":37764,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/klay-thompson-breaks-stephen-currys-record","date":"2018-10-30","title":"Klay Thompson breaks Stephen Curry's record for 3s in game","content":" CHICAGO (AP)  \u2014 Klay Thompson has broken teammate Stephen Curry\u2019s NBA record for 3-pointers in a game with his 14th during a brilliant offensive performance by the Golden State Warriors.

The Raptors announced Monday that they will rest star forward Kawhi Leonard and that reserve OG Anunoby will miss the game due to personal reasons. Additionally, Bucks star forward Giannis Antetokounmpo will also miss the game because he has been placed in the NBA\u2019s concussion protocol. The Bucks issued the following statement regarding Antetokounmpo: Both teams enter tonight\u2019s game 6-0, with the Bucks off to their best start since 1971-72 and the Raptors in the midst of the best start in team history. Aside from Leonard, Anunoby and Antetokounmpo missing the game, the Raptors say backup guard Delon Wright is probable and fellow reserve Fred VanVleet is questionable tonight. Wright is hoping to play and will likely be a game-time decision. Antetokounmpo was hurt in Saturday\u2019s win against the Orlando Magic . He fell to the floor underneath the basket midway through the first quarter after catching an elbow from the Magic\u2019s Aaron Gordon. \u201cI just got hit in the head,\u201d Antetokounmpo said. \u201cI tried to block the shot.

Leonard\u2019s absence will hurt Toronto, as he has scored 20 or more points in each of his first five games played this season and paced the team in scoring four times. Milwaukee must offset the loss of Antetokounmpo, who is averaging a team-best 25 points, 14.2 rebounds and 5.7 assists per game.

Champions and MVPs are crowned when leaves are blooming, not when they\u2019re falling. And the notion that anything in October means much in the Eastern Conference has been a quaint one for, oh, about eight years now. But LeBron James vacated the East, there\u2019s an air of openness to the conference now and the oh-so-early clash between the NBA\u2019s two remaining unbeaten teams Monday night carries a bit of buzz. It\u2019s the Toronto Raptors vs. the Milwaukee Bucks in the latter\u2019s new Fiserv Forum tonight ( 8 ET, NBA League Pass ). As much as folks in Boston or Philadelphia might want you to believe otherwise, this isn\u2019t merely a JV game. It\u2019s early, sure, but it\u2019s a clash that could get dusted off and referred to prominently when the East finals begin in May. Only one of the two will wake up Tuesday with an unblemished record, reason enough to pay attention. Seven games \u2014 they\u2019re both 6-0 now \u2014 out of 82 is equivalent to a 2.25 mile marker in a marathon. And neither has spent much time punching in its proper weight class; the Raptors\u2019 and Bucks\u2019 opponents sport a combined 27-47 record to this point. Still, a dozen of those defeats have come against the East aspirants who will meet for the first of four times, with a rematch in Toronto Dec. 9 and two more in January. Toronto, of course, has reached these heights before. It has finished first (four times) or second (once) in the Atlantic Division for five straight seasons and was No. 1 overall in the East last season. The Raptors have a new coach, but it\u2019s a fellow \u2014 Nick Nurse \u2014 who was on the staff last season when they revamped their offense. They swapped out one all-NBA player, DeMar DeRozan, for another in Kawhi Leonard. (Leonard will miss tonight\u2019s game for rest reasons .) Milwaukee? Not so much. The Bucks cracked .500 the past two seasons but are 60 games under .500 over the last five seasons. Last season was a wasted year instead of the big, bold step forward the franchise craved. It is the team with a new coach and staff, Mike Budenholzer bringing an unabashed commitment to the 3-point game from Atlanta. It has several new faces to aid in that transformation, including Ersan Ilyasova, Brook Lopez and rookie Donte DiVincenzo. Returnees such as Khris Middleton and even John Henson are shooting with the arc in mind, too. Then there\u2019s Giannis Antetokounmpo, whose fast start and burgeoning game should render the flashy new arena as one of Milwaukee\u2019s subplots, not needed for any honeymoon effect. (Unfortunately, he also will miss this game as he was placed in the NBA\u2019s concussion protocol Monday.) \u201cNew arena, new practice facility, new coach,\u201d Antetokounmpo said after an opening-week victory over Indiana. \u201cThis is the right time to be a Buck.\u201d It\u2019s a pretty swell time to be a \u201cGreek Freak\u201d freak, too. Antetokounmpo\u2019s energized start \u2014 he\u2019s averaging 25 points, 14.2 rebounds and 5.7 assists per game \u2014 is most notable because he\u2019s doing it in 30.7 minutes per game. The Bucks needed only a strong initial push against the fractured Timberwolves in Minneapolis Friday, then had to settle Saturday for just 19:23 of Giannis as he dealt with the reverberations of an Aaron Gordon elbow in the first quarter against Orlando. Milwaukee won the games by 30 and 22 points, respectively. Per 36 minutes, Antetokounmpo\u2019s numbers are career bests \u2014 29.3 ppg, 16.6 rpg, 6.7 apg and two bpg \u2014 and his usage rate (36.7 percent) tops the league. (James Harden\u2019s was 36.1 when he won Kia MVP honors last season.) Antetokounmpo leads the league with 30 turnovers and he is 1-for-16 himself on 3-point attempts. But he\u2019s not backing off on the latter, having worked on his long-distance shooting all summer, and he likely will clean up the former as he masters the spots where Milwaukee\u2019s shooters like to launch their own. If Antetokounmpo with reliable 3-point accuracy is the rest of the NBA\u2019s greatest nightmare, having him surrounded with four other deep threats is a close second. The team\u2019s defensive improvement under Budenholzer has been profound \u2014 from a 109.1 rating last year ( 18th in NBA ) to today\u2019s 97.8 (2nd in NBA). But the stretching of Milwaukee\u2019s offense has been gaudier. Last season, the Bucks took 29.7 percent of their shots from behind the arc. So far this season? They\u2019ve launched 43.6 percent from back there , second only to Houston\u2019s 44.6 percent. They\u2019re on pace to shoot 3,266 3-pointers, a year-over-year increase of 61.3 percent. They let fly with 47 of them against the Pacers and outscored their guests by 33 points on 3-pointers. They\u2019ve made 90 so far to the other guys\u2019 63. And the greatest beneficiary of the opened offense has been Antetokounmpo, the man who invades the paint either to attack at the rim himself or to wheel and deal, kicking out to one of multiple options. \u201cOne man can\u2019t stop him all by himself,\u201d said Indiana\u2019s Victor Oladipo. \u201cWe need to load to him. \u2026 Once he finds his rhythm he starts finding guys.\u201d Said Pacers reserve Doug McDermott: \u201cIt\u2019s a five-man job. \u2026 We weren\u2019t plugging the gaps and that\u2019s what you have to do against him. You have to pick your poison a bit though, because they have a lot of shooters now.\u201d Milwaukee has weapons, Toronto has experience and new looks, neither of them has a defeat and folks in the East have some new alphas to watch.

That miscue \u2014 after a 32-point, eight-rebound, 14-assist night \u2014 was all the Spurs needed to steal the win. Veteran Patty Mills nailed a huge jumper with 6.8 seconds left to push the Spurs to a 2-1 start few had them pegged for. Pistons 133, Sixers 132 (OT) \u2014 Blake Griffin, welcome back!

Curry notched the sixth 50-point game of his career, finishing with 51 points in just three quarters of work Wednesday! He nailed 11 3-pointers in the performance, his sixth career game with 11 or more 3-pointers. Celtics 101, Thunder 95 \u2014 This game was a prime example of why so many fear Boston in the Eastern Conference. The Celtics went on a 16-1 run over the final 4:14 \u2014 a rally fueled by veterans Kyrie Irving and Marcus Morris as well as youngster Jayson Tatum \u2014 that showcased their wide array of firepower and defense in a Thursday night classic. Spurs 110, Lakers 106 \u2014 Another day, another LeBron vs. Spurs showdown. However, this time around, it was DeMar DeRozan providing the heroics. He flirted with a triple-double and hit several big shots late to salt away the win for the Spurs on Saturday. But even in defeat, history was made by James as he became the NBA\u2019s No. 6 all-time scorer . Spurs coach Gregg Popovich added to his lore by becoming the fifth coach in NBA history with 1,200 or more wins.

Walker, a two-time All-Star, is the Hornets\u2019 all-time leading scorer . At 28, the former ninth overall pick in the 2011 Draft is in his prime as a player. The 41 points he dropped on Milwaukee on opening night and the fact he\u2019s gone for at least 23 every game since (with three more games of 30 or more) seems like the next logical step. It earned him the season\u2019s first Eastern Conference Player of the Week honor and as Week 2 ended, his 31.7 ppg trailed only Golden State\u2019s Stephen Curry (33.9) and Portland\u2019s Damian Lillard (33.8).  \u201cIt was [gratifying]. Who wouldn\u2019t want it to keep going?\u201d Walker told NBA.com. \u201cI know teams will be gearing up on me and double-teaming me. But I just want to win, man. I want to get back to the playoffs any way possible. I don\u2019t care what I average the rest of the year.\u201d Walker, in the final year of a four-year, $48 million deal he signed in 2014, never has shot the ball so well \u2014 40.5 percent from the arc, 46.6 percent overall. Neither has he shot it so often and from such range. Walker is averaging 23 shots, including more than 11 3-point attempts. His usage rate of 33.5 trails only Milwaukee\u2019s Giannis Antetokounmpo (35.1) and his 29.4 PER puts him ahead of Kevin Durant and LeBron James. Is it sustainable? That was one of multiple topics Walker talked about with NBA.com\u2019s Steve Aschburner:  *** Steve Aschburner:  On Media Day, you made it sound as if you would hit this season hard from the start, and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ve seen. How do you explain it? Kemba Walker:  I knew I had a good summer. I put in the work and the time and the effort to get better. And I\u2019m healthy \u2014 I haven\u2019t felt healthy like this in a long time. Over the last three summers, I wasn\u2019t healthy, having knee surgeries and \u2018scopes. So I was rehabbing. This summer, I had a chance to work on my game. Being able to work on my shooting over a long period of time really helped as well. SA:  You took as many 3FGAs last season as you shot your first two seasons combined. Now you\u2019re launching them at a pace (11.3 per game) to break Steph Curry\u2019s single season record (886). Is this a conscious change by you or a reaction to the league\u2019s preferred style? KW : Both. The league definitely has changed from the time I first came in. Everybody\u2019s shooting more threes, no matter their position. Me, I\u2019ve just become more confident. I worked on my shot tremendously to get to this point. I\u2019m comfortable now shooting it, whenever I can get to my spots. SA:  What\u2019s your preference \u2014 pull-up threes, spot-up threes or those halfcourt threes like Steph takes? KW:  Not at all [laughing]. Steph is a different type of shooter, maybe the best to ever shoot the basketball. But I\u2019m comfortable shooting them however. It doesn\u2019t matter. If I can get \u2018em up, I try to make \u2018em. But I do love for my teammates to create for me and get me some easy ones. It does take some stress, some pressure, off of me. SA:  Your coach, James Borrego, has talked of using you more off the ball. Does that suit you? KW:  It really helps. It gets me a little bit of rest, and it opens up a different dynamic in my game. As well as giving other guys a chance to have the ball in their hands and create for others. But the main thing is, it just keeps me fresher, which is huge for me. SA:  What\u2019s your take on the Charlotte rookies? KW:  Oh, I\u2019m a huge fan. Devonte\u2019 [Graham] really hasn\u2019t gotten a chance to play yet, but I\u2019ve always been a huge fan, even when he was at Kansas. Just love his game, love his poise. And that\u2019s skill \u2014 I don\u2019t think people understand how much of a skill it is to be poised, especially at a young age. It\u2019s something that I didn\u2019t have, something that took me a very long time to get. Miles [Bridges], he\u2019s a hard-playing kid. Smart, always in the right spot on both ends of the floor. I can see him getting more minutes as the season progresses.  SA:  Malik Monk is a second-year guy who didn\u2019t have the most satisfying rookie season. What do you see from him, and can he become a reliable backcourt mate? KW:  Oh yeah, he\u2019s growing. Every single day. His efficiency will come. He needs time to learn, needs time to develop, to figure out where his shots are going to come. He\u2019s getting better already. He\u2019s passing the ball really well, getting other guys involved. He needs to know we need him every night, with him coming off the bench for us. SA:  Your rookie season was about as challenging as could be \u2014 delayed by a lockout, rushed through training camp and a quickie preseason, and then a 7-59 experience. Did that set you back as a player? KW:  Nah, it wasn\u2019t a setback. It was humbling. I took it as a point in my career where I was going through adversity. It was tough \u2014 nobody likes to lose \u2014 and through my basketball career I felt I had been a winner. But I just stuck to it, just kept working hard. SA:  You said you don\u2019t want to talk anymore about your free agency next summer \u2014 and your general manager, Mitch Kupchak, is on record saying, \u201cOur intention is for him to end his career in a Hornet uniform.\u201d Some people wonder what the market might be, though, given how many terrific point guards are out there. So let\u2019s address that another way: what is it like competing with all those rivals? KW:  It\u2019s unbelievable, man. Every night. Every single night, somebody is there to \u2026 I can\u2019t even explain it. Every team, there\u2019s so many great point guards out there who are just ready to showcase their talents. There are young guys ready to show how good they are. Yeah, it\u2019s a point guard league. SA:  We\u2019re seeing more and more teams switching everything defensively. How hard is that on a 6-foot-1 point guard? KW:  It\u2019s \u2026 tough sometimes. Some matchups, you don\u2019t want to get. But I rely on my teammates to help out as much as possible. The most challenging part probably is boxing guys out. But I\u2019m always up for the challenge. SA:  Some players talk or at least play like defense is optional. Your thoughts? KW: Not at all. I\u2019m paid to do it all. It\u2019s not even about being paid \u2014 I\u2019m just competitive. I want to play defense. I want to score. I want to do it all. SA:  I\u2019ve often wondered what it\u2019s like to play for the team that Michael Jordan owns. Other teams, the owners aren\u2019t basketball experts. But that\u2019s not the case for the Hornets. Is it intimidating? KW:  I wouldn\u2019t say intimidating. I love it. I want my owner to have played. He knows what\u2019s going on, he knows how it feels after losses, after wins. Traveling. Being tired. He\u2019s been through it. He knows what it takes to win games in this league. Even though basketball\u2019s a bit different now from when he played, but still, he knows. I feel like I\u2019m at an advantage because I can go to him, I can ask him things. Or he can just come to me, or text me or call me to let me know things. And let me know how to get past things. No, it\u2019s an honor for us, it\u2019s an honor for me to have him as an owner. SA:  How is basketball different from when Jordan played? KW:  For me, just the threes. A lot of bigs shooting threes. The bigs are different in general, you know? Back with MJ, I feel like the shooting guards and the forwards were dominant, and it was more of a post-up league. Now it\u2019s a point guard\u2019s league for the most part. And it\u2019s not a post-up league much anymore. There are so many threes up in the air. SA:  Do you little guys resent the stretch-fours and stretch-fives coming out onto your turf these days? KW:  Yeah, man, it\u2019s crazy. But it\u2019s fun. Just seeing the development and the change. Even from when I first got in the league it wasn\u2019t like that. But guys are so talented nowadays, it\u2019s unbelievable. SA:  Tell me about the Big Brothers Big Sisters work you do, mentoring four kids \u2014 two boys and two girls \u2014 in the Charlotte area. KW:  Just to be in their lives. I take \u2018em out to eat, take \u2018em to Dave & Buster\u2019s every now and then. It\u2019s fun. I try to avoid the cameras. It\u2019s not for social media. It\u2019s not for anything but them. The kids are doing great in school. That\u2019s the biggest progress, that\u2019s what you want. They\u2019ve really started to love basketball now \u2014 they come to games sometimes. It\u2019s been fun to see them grow, each and every time I see them. One of the kids, his mom passed away. I know it\u2019s been a struggle for him. For me to be able to help get his mind off of that for a time, just be there for him, that\u2019s definitely rewarding for me but I hope it\u2019s more rewarding for him. SA:  You\u2019re in your eighth season, and you\u2019ve played a total of 11 playoff games. What stands out for you about the postseason? KW:  I remember every game. We played Miami twice. The first year [2014] was when they had LeBron, Dwayne Wade and Chris Bosh. They swept us, but I thought we played really well. Obviously it wasn\u2019t enough \u2014 they had three Hall of Famers. I remember the level of intensity those guys played with. I remember telling myself, the next time I get to the playoffs, I\u2019m going to try my best to play like that. The next time [2016], that\u2019s what I did. People thought we might get swept again, but we went to seven games. It was really fun. The whole atmosphere was so intense. I loved it. You have to take your game to a whole \u2018nother level. You have to play hard every possession, every second of those games. The competitiveness, the toughness, everything goes up. SA:  A problem that team had, it still has \u2014 you\u2019re carrying such a big load offensively. Do you need a second reliable scorer, and is that guy on the roster now? KW:  Of course. We need it. I\u2019m not going to have huge games every night. It\u2019s on one of these guys to step up. I think guys are still searching for their roles at this point, especially with a new coach, new system. We\u2019re still learning. But as the season progresses, I think they will. We have guys who are capable of putting points up for us. SA:  The All-Star Game this season is in Charlotte. You\u2019ve been selected twice. What would you think of playing in that game in your market? KW:  That\u2019d be amazing. To be in Charlotte, the team that drafted me, the team I\u2019ve played with for eight years now, it would be a really special moment. Hopefully I can get there. It\u2019d be fun. A really important and fun moment in my career. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

According to ESPN\u2019s Brian Windhorst and Adrian Wojnarowski, the Cavs are concerned forward Kevin Love could miss more than a month with an injured toe in his left foot. Love has missed the Cavs\u2019 last two games because of soreness in his left foot. Here\u2019s more from Wojnarowski and Windhorst on Love\u2019s injury: Love is averaging 19 points and 13.5 rebounds per game this season and has recorded a double-double in three of the four games he\u2019s played. Cleveland (0-6) is off to its worst start since losing its first seven games in the 1995-96 season. The team fired coach Tyronn Lue on Sunday . He guided the Cavaliers to an NBA title in 2016 \u2014 Cleveland\u2019s first pro sports championship since 1964 \u2014 and helped the team to four straight Finals. On Sunday, Love posted a message to Lue on Instagram that read: \u201cYou helped me see the big picture. Life changing experiences and teaching points. Nothing but love and admiration. Know we will work towards something greater together again. THANK YOU.\u201d To date, Love ranks second on the Cavs in usage rate ( 25.1 percent ), field goal percentage usage rate ( 24.2 percent ) and rebound percentage ( 36.5 percent ).

For virtually any other player, there would be absolutely no chance to continue what the Warriors star has done through the first two weeks of the NBA season. But this is Curry we\u2019re talking about, who simultaneously brings the efficiency of a specialist (43.8 career 3-point percentage, third all time), the volume of a pure scorer (3.4 3s per game, most all time) and the combustibility of a streak shooter (10 games with 10-plus 3s, most all time). All three traits were on display Sunday in Brooklyn, where he drilled seven 3-pointers en route to 35 points as the Warriors improved to 6-1 with their 120-114 victory over the Nets . It marked Curry\u2019s seventh straight game with at least five 3s, yet another record for the best shooter in league history. \u201cAs many (3s) as I shoot,\u201d Curry said, \u201cI better make \u2019em. I want to sustain (my start) as long as I can.\u201d Just how hot has Curry been? Sunday was actually one of his worst shooting games of the young season, in which he made \u201conly\u201d 7 of 15 attempts from distance, 11 of 26 overall and was limited to 11 points after a scorching 24-point first half, which included one of his classic hit-from-Saturn heat checks: Despite cooling off, Curry returned to score six points in the final 1:02, including \u2014 what else? \u2014 a dagger 3 after the Nets cut the Warriors\u2019 lead from 19 to 2. Even after what constitutes as a relatively cold \u2014 OK, cool \u2014 game, Curry is still averaging 33.9 points and 6.6 3s per game on 70.9 true shooting percentage. (For the uninitiated, true shooting percentage accounts for 2s, 3s and free throws in an overall measure of efficiency. Anything over 60 percent is excellent. When you\u2019re at 70.9 percent on an average shot distance of nearly 19 feet? Pure insanity.) With Durant also scorching the nets for 30.9 points per game, he and Curry are the first set of teammates to average 30-plus points apiece through seven games since Jerry West and Wilt Chamberlain in 1969-70, and only the third overall. (Durant scorched the Nets as well, finishing with an efficient 34 points on 20 shots.) The Warriors have needed all of it, too, with Klay Thompson slumping badly to start the season and no other player scoring in double-figures. That would likely be a sign of trouble for most any other team. But these are the Warriors, and this is Stephen Curry, the basketball equivalent of an M-80 just waiting to be lit every time he steps on the court. And so far this season, he\u2019s 7 for 7. Most people would swap a half-eaten piece of pizza for a game-used Russell Westbrook shoe without a second thought. Most people are not this little Thunder fan, who made the obviously amused Russ work for his slice \u2026 and still ended up with both. As an added bonus, the Thunder actually won the game, too, outlasting the depleted the Suns for their first victory of 2018-19 . First Kyrie. Then LeBron. Now Tyronn Lue. The principles of the Cavaliers\u2019 first championship team continue to drift away, with their coach getting the sack on Sunday afternoon after an 0-6 start and two-plus seasons on the job. It ties the fifth-quickest firing in NBA history, with only Dolph Schayes (one game, 1971-72), Chick Reiser (three, 1952-53) and Earl Watson (three, 2017-18) coming faster. When trying to take the spider-armed Durant 1-on-1 goes terribly, terribly wrong. Mavericks center DeAndre Jordan has apparently been inspired by all the sweet dimes dropped by rookie teammate Luka Doncic. The 11-year veteran entered Sunday\u2019s game against the Jazz having dished out five or more assists a grand total of three times. You can make that four, with his nine assists crushing his previous career high by three. Jordan \u2014 a career 44.9 percent shooter at the foul line \u2014 also sank 4 of 4 free throws, bringing his season total to 26 for 30.

The Cleveland Cavaliers fired their coach on Sunday and named assistant Larry Drew interim head coach. The Cavaliers are off to a 0-6 start without James, who left Cleveland this summer for the second time in his career and signed with the Los Angeles Lakers as a free agent. Lue guided the Cavaliers to an NBA title in 2016 \u2013 Cleveland\u2019s first pro sports championship since 1964 \u2013 and helped the team to four straight Finals. \u201cWe thank him for the many ways he has contributed to our success, wish him the best and he will always be remembered for leading a very special Cavs team back against the odds to win the title in 2016,\u201d general manager Koby Altman said in a statement. \u201cThis is a different team equation, though, and one that we felt needed a different voice and approach that required this change.\u201d Assistant coach Damon Jones also was fired. A former Cavaliers player, Jones had been promoted during the offseason. Lue issued a statement in which he thanked team owner Dan Gilbert, former general manager David Griffin and Altman. \u201cMy time here in Cleveland was truly special,\u201d Lue added. \u201cI am very grateful for the dedication, sacrifice and support of all the players on our team, the tremendous coaches I\u2019ve worked with and of course, our incredible fans.\u201d Players appeared to be caught off-guard by Lue\u2019s dismissal. According to Joe Vardon of The Athletic , the players are reportedly not pleased with the decision by Cavaliers GM Koby Altman: According to Vardon, Lue and Atlman have disagreed on playing time and direction of the team since training camp. Lue reportedly preferred to play veterans over the team\u2019s younger players. Here are more details from Vardon on the dynamic between Lue and Altman. All-Star Kevin Love, who has missed the past two games with a sore left foot, posted a message to Lue on Instagram. \u201cYou helped me see the big picture,\u201d Love wrote. \u201cLife changing experiences and teaching points. Nothing but love and admiration. Know we will work towards something greater together again. THANK YOU.\u201d Love also posted a photo of him and Lue hugging on the court at Oracle Arena after the Cavaliers rallied from a 3-1 deficit and won Game 7 of the 2016 Finals over Golden State. James also expressed gratitude toward his former coach on Twitter . \u201cT Lue thanks for the memories and more importantly our partnership bringing a (championship) to that deserved city\/fan base,\u201d James said. \u201cU know how to find me.\u201d The 41-year-old Lue has three years left on a five-year, $35 million contract he signed after Cleveland won the title. He went 128-83 in three-plus seasons as coach. Drew filled in when Lue stepped aside for 10 games last season while dealing with chest pains, insomnia and anxiety. He came to Cleveland as an assistant in 2014 after serving as head coach for the Milwaukee Bucks (2013-2014) and Atlanta Hawks (2010-2013). Wojnarowski later reiterated that Drew is reluctant to accept that role without an \u201cagreement of some kind\u201d beyond this season. The Cavaliers were hoping to remain competitive without James, but they\u2019ve been overmatched. They dropped their sixth straight game on Saturday night to Indiana and are off to their worst start since losing their first seven games in the 1995-96 season. Cleveland has trailed by at least 16 points in all six losses and the club has yet to lead in the second half. The Cavs have also been plagued by poor defense and communication issues, and has looked disorganized at times. The Cavaliers host Atlanta on Tuesday night. Led by rookie Trae Young\u2019s 35 points, the Hawks clobbered the Cavs by 22 points in Cleveland\u2019s home opener last week.

It is especially so, considering Coach Lue\u2019s time with us over the last four years, including four straight trips to the NBA Finals,\u201d said Altman. \u201cWe have respect and great admiration for Ty, not only as a coach, but a person. We thank him for the many ways he has contributed to our success, wish him the best and he will always be remembered for leading a very special Cavs team back against the odds to win the title in 2016. This is a different team equation, though, and one that we felt needed a different voice and approach that required this change.\u201d Coach Lue joined the Cavaliers coaching staff in June of 2014 as associate head coach. He was promoted to head coach in January of 2016, thus becoming the 20th head coach in franchise history. As head coach of the Cavaliers, he had a combined regular season record of 128-83 (.606) and a 41-20 (.672) mark in the playoffs. Drew was named associate head coach for the Cleveland Cavaliers in September of 2016. He spent his first two seasons with the Cavaliers as an assistant coach (2014-2016), including the 2015-16 campaign when Cleveland won the NBA championship. Before his arrival in Cleveland, Drew served as the head coach of the Milwaukee Bucks in 2013-14. Prior to that, he was head coach of the Atlanta Hawks from 2010 through 2013, where he compiled a 128-102 (.557) overall record and led the Hawks to the postseason in each of his three campaigns on the bench. * * *"},{"id":37765,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/devin-booker-out-vs-thunder-hamstring-injury","date":"2018-10-28","title":"Report: Suns' Booker out Sunday vs. Thunder with strained left hamstring","content":" Suns guard Devin Booker will miss his second straight game Sunday with a strained left hamstring as Phoenix faces Oklahoma City ( 7 ET, NBA League Pass ), Gina Mizell of The Athletic reports .

With Giannis Antetokounmpo sidelined to start the second half while being evaluated for a possible concussion, the Bucks built a big third-quarter lead and cruised to a 113-91 win over the Orlando Magic on Saturday night. The Bucks have won six consecutive games to start the season, one shy of the record set by the 1971-72 team. The win sets up a Monday night showdown in Milwaukee with the Toronto Raptors, the league\u2019s only other unbeaten team. Antetokounmpo, who finished with 21 points in a season-low 19 minutes, fell to the floor underneath the basket midway through the first quarter after catching an elbow from the Magic\u2019s Aaron Gordon. \u201cI just got hit in the head,\u201d Antetokounmpo said. \u201cI tried to block the shot. I fell down. I don\u2019t remember much after that. I have to be careful with that. We did some (concussion) tests in the second quarter and some additional tests in the third quarter.\u201d When asked what he remembered about the play, Antetokoumpo said he was \u201cprobably knocked out.\u201d \u201cI just remember the hit. But I\u2019m fine,\u201d he said. Milwaukee coach Mike Budenholzer noted that Antetokounmpo continued to play close to his normal minutes in the first half after the blow to the head before being sent back to the locker room to undergo further tests after halftime. Antetokounmpo played 3 minutes in the fourth quarter. \u201cWe just wanted to be extra cautious, make sure everything was OK and give him an extra look,\u201d Budenholzer said. Gordon described Antetokounmpo as \u201ctough\u201d for coming back out on the court. \u201cHe is resilient. I hit him with the elbow, unintentionally,\u201d Gordon said. \u201cIt was hard. Props to him for coming back into the game.\u201d Khris Middleton added 18 points and Malcolm Brogdon scored 16 for the Bucks, who were coming off a 125-95 blowout of the Minnesota Timberwolves on the road on Friday night in which they made 19 3-pointers on 46 attempts, both season highs. After a tightly contested first quarter in which Orlando led by five at one point, the Bucks took control in the second and built a 14-point lead at the half. Antetokounmpo had 15 first-half points, while Middleton had 12. Milwaukee\u2019s lead grew to 26 in the third with Antetokoumpo on the bench for the entire period. The Bucks closed the quarter on an 11-1 run and headed to the fourth with a 93-68 lead. Although it took a shot to the head to keep him off the court on Saturday night, Antetokounmpo only logged 23 minutes of playing time on Friday night in the blowout win. He said he appreciates the rest during back-to-back games. \u201cI know when I\u2019m 40 and I\u2019m retired, I\u2019m going to be able to chase my kids and I\u2019m still going to have my knees and I\u2019m not going to look for knees on eBay,\u201d Antetokounmpo said. > More From This Game"},{"id":46667,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/about-last-night-10-27-18","date":"2018-10-28","title":"About Last Night: Moments and milestones","content":" The second weekend of the 2018-19 season didn\u2019t disappoint, featuring multiple milestones, unbeatens getting beaten and the second dramatic edition of Lakers-Spurs in less than a week. We cover all that and more in the latest edition of About Last Night. Five days after a high-scoring, overtime thriller in Los Angeles , the Spurs and Lakers were back in action at San Antonio. The outcome was the same: a narrow Spurs victory behind DeMar DeRozan and LaMarcus Aldridge despite valiant efforts from LeBron James and Kyle Kuzma. How each duo scored those points, however, differed greatly. The Spurs tandem stuck to its mid-range specialty, while James and Kuzma attacked from the extremes of beyond the arc or inside the paint.   The last play of the game garnered the most talk. Down four, L.A. faced a classic question: get the guaranteed two points now or a chance at three with only seconds remaining in a two-possession game? Rajon Rondo opted for the latter, passing on a blatantly wide-open layup in favor of finding a teammate beyond the arc. James\u2019 contested attempt was off the mark, ultimately sealing the Spurs\u2019 win. LeBron has been good at basketball for a long time, hence his rise to sixth place on the NBA\u2019s all-time scoring list on Saturday night. For a guy who came into the league with an extremely questionable jump shot, it was only fitting that a smooth 17-footer saw James further ascend basketball\u2019s ultimate ladder of immortality. James wasn\u2019t the only guy making his mark on Saturday. Miami\u2019s Goran Dragic surpassed 10,000 career points during Miami\u2019s 120-111 win over Portland. Not bad for a former 45th overall pick . Speaking of the Blazers, Lillard\u2019s 42-point performance was the 18th such 40-point game of his career, pushing him past Clyde \u201cThe Glide\u201d Drexler for most 40-point games in franchise history. In case you don\u2019t remember how good Drexler was\u2026 Gregg Popovich has won a lot of games. Exactly 1,200 after Saturday\u2019s win over the Lakers. Finally, if you\u2019re a Joel Embiid fan, you\u2019ll love the Hall of Fame arc his career numbers are already taking. Only four teams entered Saturday with a spotless record. That number was halved before the night was over. New Orleans found itself on the second night of a back-to-back without Anthony Davis (elbow injury) and facing a rejuvenated Jazz team. Without Davis, Utah big man Rudy Gobert (25 points, 14 rebounds, four blocks) wreaked havoc inside. Combined with Ricky Rubio\u2019s unlikely offensive outburst (28 points, 12 assists), it was more than enough to snap the Pelicans\u2019 four-game win streak with a 132-111 victory. Up in Detroit, meanwhile, the Pistons encountered the kind of overwhelming Boston depth many expected to see from day one. It didn\u2019t matter that Kyrie Irving, Jayson Tatum and Al Horford shot a combined 5-for-22 . The Celtics won by 20 anyway. One of the more surprising stats from the opening 10-plus days of the season: Milwaukee leads the league in rebounding . Then again, maybe it\u2019s not as surprising when they have teammates battling to this degree. Tell Ersan he owes you one, Brook. Without Devin Booker (hamstring), the Suns were easy prey for the veteran Grizzlies in a 117-96 defeat. Deandre Ayton, however, provided a big silver lining with 24 points ( 12-for-13 FG ), eight rebounds, five assists and zero turnovers in 33 minutes of action. That combination of production and efficiency puts Ayton in the same breath as\u2026 Adam Keefe ?"},{"id":37840,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/lebron-passes-dirk-scoring-list","date":"2018-10-28","title":"LeBron James passes Dirk Nowitzki for sixth on all-time scoring list","content":"LeBron James has reached another milestone, passing Dirk Nowitzki for sixth on the NBA\u2019s all-time scoring list.

Wade was the first to play in an NBA game, doing so on Oct. 28 against the Philadelphia 76ers. He finished with 18 points in an 89-74 loss to the Allen Iverson-led Sixers . However, Wade\u2019s rookie season would be plenty solid as he earned All-Rookie first team honors and led his Miami Heat to the Eastern Conference semifinals in the playoffs.

He did not disappoint, finishing with 25 points, six rebounds, nine assists and four steals in a 106-92 road loss to the Sacramento Kings on Oct. 29 . While his Cleveland Cavaliers would miss the playoffs in the 2003-04 season, James did help Cleveland improve by 20 wins after a 17-65 finish in 2002-03. In addition, James won Rookie of the Year honors, the first of many awards in his storied NBA career. Anthony came into the NBA with much acclaim as well, having led Syracuse to an NCAA title in 2003. His first game came on Oct. 29 and he delivered 12 points, seven rebounds and three assists in an 80-72 Denver Nuggets win against the San Antonio Spurs . Anthony led his team to the 2004 postseason and earned a spot on the All-Rookie first team, too. Bosh did not start in his first game, but that did not stop him from being productive in his debut game. He had 11 points, four rebounds and two blocks in the Toronto Raptors\u2019 90-87 win against the New Jersey Nets .

Westbrook had a rough finish last night, rushing a 3-pointer with 45 seconds left that would have broken a 95-95 tie and missing another 3-pointer with 26 seconds left that would have tied it at 98 .

Change can be a mixed bag, even for LeBron James, and we haven\u2019t yet mentioned his other new and complex surroundings, meaning, teammates to break in. There\u2019s also a third layer to this unfamiliar skin, and this could be the most uncomfortable of them all. Yes, if LeBron and the Los Angeles Lakers are to deliver more than just must-see TV for insomniacs around most of the country, they must find a way to flex muscle in the Western Conference. As LeBron has already discovered, he ain\u2019t in Kansas anymore. Actually, make that Orlando, Charlotte, Brooklyn, etc., etc., etc. For a superstar who doesn\u2019t take nights off, he can\u2019t afford to do so anyway in the Western Conference, where there\u2019s seemingly another potential 50-game winner staring from the other bench. That\u2019s what Thursday was all about, planting concern into the heads of the elite teams of the West and making them notice what\u2019s taking place in Los Angeles. The Nuggets came into Staples Center undefeated and left with some clues about what LeBron and the Lakers can be in the near future. \u201cGrowth that\u2019s continuing to happen,\u201d is how Lakers coach Luke Walton described it. LeBron had his first triple-double as a Laker and given the circumstances \u2014 no Rajon Rondo or Brandon Ingram, both suspended, for a second straight game \u2014 they delivered their most impressive 48 minutes of the season with a 121-114 win . \u201cThe first couple of games when we fell behind, we stayed behind,\u201d said LeBron, noting how the Lakers seized control from the Nuggets for good late. \u201cThe best teacher in life is experience.\u201d These are the type of games he will see more frequently than he did with the Cleveland Cavaliers and Miami Heat. For someone who spent his entire career in the Eastern Conference, the upgrade in competition will force LeBron and the Lakers to sharpen their learning curve. Already the West shows few signs of fall-off from a year ago when 10 teams finished with winning records. It\u2019s a small sample size so far, yet once again, it\u2019s business as usual in the better conference. The Golden State Warriors remain the class of the conference and league, with all the usual suspects that delivered three championships in four seasons accounted for. Yes, Klay Thompson might need to dispatch his trusty dog, Rocco, to search for his missing jumper. But as long as Stephen Curry is dropping in 51-point games (as he did Wednesday against the Washington Wizards), they\u2019ll be alright. What\u2019s interesting and most frightening about the Warriors is how they\u2019re still a few months from suiting up DeMarcus Cousins, who has advanced to light work and dropping sweat in non-contact drills. Last season\u2019s West runner-ups, the Houston Rockets, are missing the perimeter defense and shooting of the departed Trevor Ariza. Meanwhile, Carmelo Anthony is shooting 26 percent from deep and straining while trying to keep this from becoming an extension from his Oklahoma City stop. James Harden is dealing with a tweaky hamstring and Chris Paul, fresh from wiping Rajon Rondo\u2019s DNA off his face, is serving out a suspension. Yet this will not last long and, already, Rockets GM Daryl Morey is up to his tricks . Reports are circulating he\u2019s scheming to trade a plate of Texas brisket to the Timberwolves for Jimmy Butler . If Morey pulls that off, the Rockets will have three All-Stars in their starting five, second only to the Warriors four last season. LeBron must beware of Rondo\u2019s old team, which is playing like it isn\u2019t missing Rondo as much as some folks were led to believe. The New Orleans Pelicans is flourishing with a breezy style that\u2019s a carryover from their surprising run to the 2018 West semifinals. Nikola Mirotic (28 points per game) is averaging nearly as many points as Anthony Davis (30.3 ppg) and ex-Laker Julius Randle is fitting right in next to Davis. The San Antonio Spurs, speaking of unexpected teams, are off to a good start. Behind DeMar DeRozan, they could make it 22 straight playoff appearances \u2026 even after all their offseason roster moves and early injuries. And Patrick Beverley recently said the LA Clippers are the best team in LA (but take that for what it\u2019s worth). Still, it all shows you that nobody is rolling out the red carpet for the Lakers just because they added LeBron. The Nuggets missed the playoffs on the final regular season day last season and they\u2019re perhaps wiser for it. Nikola Jokic is making his top-three center case and Denver\u2019s Defensive Rating is among the league\u2019s best . What they saw Thursday was a controlled and efficient game from LeBron (28 points, 11 rebounds, 11 assists), Lonzo Ball stripping Jamal Murray in the open floor for one of his five steals, former Warriors role player JaVale McGee scoring 21 points on his 16 shots and a highly entertaining energy boost from Lance Stephenson off the bench. Nuggets coach Mike Malone was an assistant from 2005-10 in Cleveland and therefore saw the LeBron Effect first-hand in those formative years. \u201cSure, the West is tougher,\u201d Malone said, \u201cbut also this is his first time playing with all those guys. As he said, this will take time. It doesn\u2019t happen overnight, just as it didn\u2019t last year in Oklahoma City when they brought in Paul George and Carmelo Anthony and everybody thought they were going to be great right away. Playing with LeBron isn\u2019t easy. It\u2019s easy, but it isn\u2019t easy. When we traded for guys like Wally Szczerbiak, he comes in and says \u2018I\u2019ve never been this open in my life.\u2019 He had a hard time making shots because he was so open. \u201cLeBron is bringing all those guys confidence up. Josh Hart, Kyle Kuzma, they\u2019ll be better off for it. He\u2019s a great player and slowly the team will round into form. My definition of greatness is, what can you do for everyone around you? Can you take them to new heights? And he has done that repeatedly throughout his career. He\u2019s doing the same thing now in LA.\u201d A week into the season tells us this about the Lakers: They\u2019ve played four of their five games against playoff teams, winning only one but taking the other three well into the fourth quarter. They\u2019re two missed LeBron free throws from a winning record. LeBron is MVP-like and sturdy as ever, and the other pieces are slowly dropping into place. Whether it\u2019ll be good enough to make traction in a tough conference will take months to sort out. Yes, the West is better. But that\u2019s also because the Lakers fueled by LeBron, no longer the post-Kobe pushovers, are better as well. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

The reflection doesn\u2019t pain him anymore. From the outside, the Cleveland Cavaliers\u2019 All-Star forward appears to have it all: A model\u2019s striking looks, a multi-million dollar contract and dream job. At 30, he\u2019s in the prime of his career, and maybe for the first time, truly happy. \u201cI\u2019m getting there,\u201d he said, his voice conveying determination. \u201cIt\u2019s still a work in progress.\u201d Nearly a year ago, Love suffered a panic attack during a game against Atlanta. The desperate, life-altering event eventually led to revealing his long-term battle with anxiety and depression. Now Love is hoping to break down stigmas about men\u2019s mental health. He has partnered with Shick Hydro on a website series called \u201cLocker Room Talk\u201d , holding candid conversations with Olympic gold-medal swimming icon Michael Phelps, former Boston Celtics star Paul Pierce and Cavs teammate and close friend Channing Frye. No topic is off limits. The first episode with Phelps premieres next month and coincides with fundraising efforts for the Movember Foundation, which promotes men growing moustaches during the month to raise awareness for prostate cancer, testicular cancer and suicide. Love recently filmed the sit-down talks with Phelps, Pierce and Frye on Cleveland\u2019s east side while his Cavs prepared to open their first season in five years without superstar LeBron James, who signed with Los Angeles this summer. While Love knows his 11th year as a pro will be challenging ( Cleveland fell to 0-4 on Wednesday night ), his focus was on the series, which he views as an important step in his personal development and a natural progression toward a broader platform for more mental health initiatives.  Love\u2019s discussions with the three athletes cover a wide range of topics, including \u201cmasculinity, traumatic events, women and their roles in our lives, thoughts of suicide, anxiety. Everything.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re changing the paradigm of locker room talk where it\u2019s not just about sports anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s life.\u201d In their talks with Love, Phelps and Pierce open up about their past struggles with mental health. Frye brings a perspective of coping with loss and tragedy following the deaths of his parents within weeks of each other in 2016. Love hopes the frank discussions will touch people to seek help and maybe encourage them to address their problems. It took a distressing experience for Love to take the first steps in his journey. During the second half of a game on Nov. 5 against Atlanta, Love\u2019s career took an unexpected turn and it may have saved him. He suffered a panic attack so severe that Love said he felt like he was dying. He felt trapped, gasped for air and with his heart and mind racing uncontrollably, Love frantically scrambled from room to room deep inside Quicken Loans Arena before finally collapsing on the locker room floor. He was taken to the Cleveland Clinic for tests. Love already had a sense of what was wrong. He had struggled since childhood with depression and mood swings, which he said was passed down through generations in his family. As a teenager, he would often descend into \u201cmy dark place\u201d for weeks and experienced fits of rage. \u201cI was angry and would break stuff,\u201d Love said. \u201cI would never hurt anyone, but I would act out against authority and rebel. I didn\u2019t know why I felt that way.\u201d He subsequently sought counseling. But after another panic episode, Love felt compelled to go public after some teammates questioned why he left another game early. Love began his personal admission with a powerful essay for the Players\u2019 Tribune entitled \u201cEveryone Is Going Through Something.\u201d \u201cIn the immediate aftermath of Nov. 5, I didn\u2019t want anyone to know. I still don\u2019t know how I came out and played 48 hours later. I wanted to hide. I was so afraid that people were going to find out what had happened. All those events that then followed allowed me to get to a point where I was like, \u2018OK, now it\u2019s time for me to tell my story\u2019 and I wanted to tell it in my own words.\u201d Love remains overwhelmed at the outpouring since revealing his struggles. He and All-Star DeMar DeRozan are the most noteworthy players to express their issues, but Love said barely a day goes by that he\u2019s not approached by someone inspired by him. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how many guys around the league have come up to me and said, \u2018How did you get there?\u2019 or \u2018How did you get out of it?\u2019 And I\u2019ve had people ask, \u2018Hey, can you help me?\u2019 \u201cNot just becoming a sounding board but a way to help them,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s become just a great community, not just in the NBA but everywhere I go.\u201d"},{"id":46670,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/michael-jordan-esports-investment","date":"2018-10-25","title":"Michael Jordan invests in esports ownership group","content":" LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 A quarter century after being famously excluded from the cult favorite video game NBA Jam, Michael Jordan is investing in esports.

In their first regular-season showdown, Doncic scored 12 points in the first quarter as the Mavs built a 42-22 lead. The Mavs led by 26 early in the second quarter as Young struggled from the field and picked up his second and third fouls. The script flipped in the second half, though, as the Hawks mounted an epic comeback. While Kent Bazemore did the heavy lifting ( career-high 32 points ), Young delivered in crunch time, scoring 12 of his 17 points in the final quarter and getting to the line over and over again.

Way up. At this pace, that won\u2019t change anytime soon. Through the first eight full days of this season \u2013 obviously, a small sample size \u2013 NBA teams are averaging 113.4 points per game, the highest rate in 49 years. Teams are averaging 91 field-goal attempts per game, up five shots from last season, and the league is on an early pace to set records for 3-pointers made and attempted for the seventh straight year. \u201cI think guys are just getting more comfortable offensively in their games,\u201d Toronto point guard Kyle Lowry said. \u201cI think everyone is just expanding, with the centers shooting 3s. I think that just opens the floor up a lot more. A lot more shots are going up, a lot more freedom of movement. It makes it more of an exciting game.\u201d As recently as the 2014-15 season, teams were reaching the 100-point mark 51.5 percent of the time. So far this season, that figure is at 88.2 percent. And there are no shortage of other statistically baffling numbers out there in the early part of this season. In the 51 games played through Tuesday, 49 have seen at least one team score 100 points. The losing team has wound up scoring 100 or more points a staggering 80.4 percent of the time. Minnesota scored 136 points in a non-overtime game and lost \u2013 the first time that\u2019s happened in the NBA since 1992. New Orleans posted a league-high 149 points against Sacramento last week. San Antonio scored 143 , albeit in an overtime game, against the Los Angeles Lakers, the most by the Spurs in more than eight years. (The Spurs also allowed 142 points in the same game, the most points allowed by a San Antonio team since 1990, long before Gregg Popovich\u2019s coaching tenure there started.) \u201cThe whole dynamic of the game has changed,\u201d said Spurs guard DeMar DeRozan, in remarks published by the San Antonio Express-News . \u201cThe rules force you to play at a high speed. Tempo is getting pushed. So many 3s are being shot.\u201d Perhaps the most baffling stat is this: Entering Wednesday, LeBron James and the Lakers ranked No. 2 in the NBA in scoring at 125.3 points per game, and were off to an 0-3 start anyway. \u201cWe\u2019ve played well enough to win \u2026 and well enough to lose,\u201d James said. \u201cIf that makes any sense.\u201d In this wide-open NBA, that might make perfect sense. The league\u2019s officials are emphasizing what the NBA calls \u201cfreedom of movement\u201d this season, an effort to clean up some of the extra contact that happens away from the ball and impedes offensive players from cutting and getting open. And it\u2019s no surprise that the tighter whistles are an advantage to the offense, though they are hardly the only reason why scoring is soaring. NBA teams were called for 19.9 fouls per game last season; this season, it\u2019s up to 23.1. Free throws taken and made are also up slightly, though nowhere near enough to account for the entire spike in scoring. It\u2019s the sum of many parts \u2013 faster pace, perhaps caused in part by that extra freedom of movement, along with more 3s being taken. And again, it\u2019s early. Players will likely fatigue over the course of the season, and at some point defenses will adjust and catch up somewhat. \u201cI\u2019m sure some of this will level off,\u201d Miami coach Erik Spoelstra said. \u201cHow much it\u2019ll level off, I don\u2019t know.

More budget-minded patrons can take advantage of a dozen discounted items such as $1 chips, $2 jumbo pretzels or a $4 bottomless bucket of popcorn, seizing on a popular trend that started next door at Mercedes-Benz Stadium, home of the NFL Falcons and Atlanta United soccer team. But it\u2019s some of the other features that figure to draw much of the attention in the new-look arena. Most notably, there is Killer Mike\u2019s Swag Shop, a partnership with the Atlanta-based rapper that includes a full-service barber shop with four chairs facing the court on the second level, allowing customers to keep up with the home team while getting a fresh cut. Or, if the game gets out of hand, the Topgolf Swing Suites might be a welcome alternative. While fans won\u2019t be able strike actual golf balls onto the court, they can try their luck on the simulators. Hawks guard Kent Bazemore, an avid golfer, plans to slip up there himself before a game. \u201cI\u2019ll be up there smacking it around soon,\u201d he said, breaking into a sly grin. Stefansson said the designers were focused on \u201ccreating a lot of different and distinct destinations, things than fans want to go seek out and experience.\u201d Bazemore called it a sign of the times, given that fans have myriad entertainment options and ever-shrinking attention spans. \u201cIt\u2019s all about the experience,\u201d he said. The aesthetics didn\u2019t go overlooked, either. Massive clear glass windows were installed, providing views of the surrounding downtown area. Numerous walls were knocked down, allowing those on the concourses to keep up with the game even when they venture from their seats. \u201cPeople actually communicating, meeting new people, standing on the concourse talking about the game, it just opens it up for that community feel that we\u2019re trying to push here in Atlanta,\u201d Bazemore said. The project also drew its share of criticism over $142.5 million in public funding , which cleared the way for the second-biggest project of its type in NBA history. It was surpassed only by Madison Square Garden in New York, where a $1 billion upgrade was carried out over three offseason from 2011-13. This renovation \u2013 or \u201ctransformation,\u201d the preferred nomenclature of its supporters \u2013 was largely carried out over the past two summer breaks, a frenzied job that allowed little room for dallying or delay. The most striking part of the project was the removal of the stacked suites on one side of the building formerly known as Philips Arena , which required the Hawks to play all of last season with a giant covering over that construction zone and reduced capacity to just over 16,000. Even now, with much of the work complete, the arena will seat only about 16,500 for basketball, a drop of almost 3,000 seats from the original configuration when the arena opened in 1999. But the Hawks have traditionally been one of the NBA\u2019s worst-drawing seats, so there wasn\u2019t much hesitation about cutting back capacity to allow for a major upgrade. \u201cThe first thing we knew needed to do was knock down that wall of suites. Take that premium area and redistribute it around the building a little more evenly,\u201d Stefansson said. \u201cIt creates a lot more balance in the building.\u201d Many of the Atlanta players got their first look at their revamped home on Tuesday. After playing their first three games on the road, the Hawks practiced for nearly two hours on the newly installed court, beneath a massive new scoreboard and video screen. They were impressed with the new surroundings, which includes a much larger locker room and training area. So was first-year coach Lloyd Pierce. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable what this looks like,\u201d he said, glancing around. \u201cI can\u2019t even imagine once we get some people in here what it\u2019s going to feel like.\u201d"},{"id":37949,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/joel-embiid-andre-drummond-own-real-estate-his-head","date":"2018-10-24","title":"Embiid on Drummond: 'I own real estate in his head'","content":" The longstanding discord between Philadelphia 76ers center Joel Embiid and Detroit Pistons center Andre Drummond added another chapter to its lore last night. In Detroit\u2019s thrilling 133-132 overtime win against Philadelphia , Embiid put in some serious work on the court, finishing with 33 points and 11 rebounds to Drummond\u2019s 14 and 16, respectively. As our Drew Packham pointed out in the latest About Last Night filing, the two big men were going at each other all game. Embiid made a point throughout the game to let Drummond know he couldn\u2019t guard him , and with 42.8 seconds left in regulation, Drummond was ejected after picking up his second technical foul. Just before that, Embiid scored in the post on Drummond to put Philly up, 120-118. As the ball went through the net, Embiid and Drummond were standing near each other. Embiid then seemed to act as if Drummond had hit him in the face and fell to the ground. That got Drummond tossed. Per Michael Rothstein of ESPN.com, Drummond said he was warned by the officials about the physical play between the two big men . After the Sixers\u2019 loss, Embiid said that overall he feels he has Drummond\u2019s number. After hearing of Embiid\u2019s comments about owning \u201creal estate in his head,\u201d Drummond took to Twitter and posted the following message: \u201cLol does he? If that\u2019s so he wouldn\u2019t be so excited to have me off the floor? Think about it that\u2019s a silly statement ! I\u2019ll take the W though enjoy flight home #Emmyaward winning actor\u201d Drummond and Embiid have exchanged words through the media in the past, with Embiid saying last October that Drummond doesn\u2019t play defense and that he couldn\u2019t shoot . Drummond fired back by calling out Embiid\u2019s injury history and inability to play in back-to-back games for most of his career. Overall, Embiid has a 3-1 lifetime record against Drummond.

Who\u2019s the league\u2019s tallest player? Which team has the oldest average age? What jersey numbers are the most popular? All of that data and more was compiled in the 2018-19 NBA Roster Survey . Here are nine takeaways \u2026 > Complete 2018-19 NBA Roster Survey (PDF) * * * 1. Each season, the league uses its findings to determine who is the \u201caverage\u201d NBA player, with Thunder small forward Andre Roberson fitting the bill this season. The average player in the league is 26 years old, 6-foot-7, 219.05 pounds and has 4.8 seasons worth of NBA experience. Roberson, 26, is listed at 6-foot-7, 210 pounds and has played five seasons in the league. He awaits the start to his sixth season as he rehabs from patellar tendon surgery. 2. There are still two active players in the league who were born in the 1970s: Vince Carter and Dirk Nowitzki. Meanwhile, the youngest player in the league hadn\u2019t been born when Michael Jordan won his sixth and final championship in 1998. Isaac Bonga of the Lakers was born on Nov. 8, 1999, meaning next year there will be an NBA active player born in 2000. 3. Another wild takeaway in the age category is that out of 440 players in the league, 418 of them are younger than 33-year-old LeBron James, who in his 16th season is still playing at an MVP level. 4. The Cavaliers were the oldest team in the NBA last season, but that changed following James\u2019 defection to the Los Angeles Lakers. The Rockets now hold that title (28.6 years old), with the New York Knicks officially labeled the youngest team in the league (24.57).  5. The Nuggets have a roster that uniquely ranks second to last among teams with the most NBA experience (an average of 3.27 years). The Bulls have the lowest average in the league (3.13), followed by the Nuggets, Knicks (3.47), Celtics (3.53) and Magic (3.53). 6. The Knicks\u2019 Kristaps Porzingis and Clippers\u2019 Boban Marjanovic are once again the tallest players in the league at 7-foot-3, with 5-foot-9 Nuggets point guard Isaiah Thomas being the league\u2019s shortest player. A few names that fit the average NBA height of 6-foot-7 inches tall: DeMar DeRozan, Luka Doncic, Draymond Green, Kawhi Leonard and Klay Thompson. Additionally, the Nets, Nuggets, Grizzlies and Kings all sport rosters with an average height of exactly 6-foot-7. 7. Despite having the NBA\u2019s rebounding leader in 6-foot-11 Andre Drummond, the Detroit Pistons check in as the shortest team in the league overall (6 feet, 6.27 inches). The Washington Wizards are the NBA\u2019s tallest squad on average at 6 feet, 8.15 inches. 8. The University of Kentucky remains the top college represented on NBA rosters, with a total of 27 players hailing from the collegiate powerhouse. Duke (23), UCLA (15), Kansas (12) and North Carolina (11) round out the top five. 9. There are 20 players who wear No. 3, the most popular jersey number worn in the NBA. Guards Chris Paul, Dwyane Wade, Bradley Beal, CJ. McCollum each don the digit Allen Iverson once wore. Try thinking of 16 more on your own \u2026 And, here are a few more roster survey tidbits to chew on: Shortest teams Tallest teams Youngest teams Oldest teams Least experienced NBA teams Most experienced NBA teams Shortest players Tallest players"},{"id":37952,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/bulls-kris-dunn-out-4-6-weeks-mcl-sprain","date":"2018-10-24","title":"Bulls lose Kris Dunn for 4 to 6 weeks with MCL sprain","content":" Injury woes have been an issue for the Chicago Bulls early in this 2018-19 season, and they don\u2019t show signs of letting up. The Bulls announced today that guard Kris Dunn will miss the next four to six weeks with a moderate MCL sprain in his left knee . Per Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg, Dunn suffered the injury in the second quarter of last night\u2019s 115-109 road loss to the Dallas Mavericks . Dunn started the game for Chicago, playing 30 minutes while logging nine points, four rebounds and seven assists. The Bulls have been playing this season without star second-year forward Lauri Markkanen, who is out until at least mid-November with an elbow injury. Fellow second-year player Denzel Valentine has yet to suit up this season because of a bone bruise in his left ankle. Valentine is expected to miss at least another two weeks . Dunn made his season debut against the Mavs after missing the first two games to paternity leave. He was evaluated at halftime and checked out well enough to finish the game, but a postgame evaluation led to the Bulls seeking an MRI on the injury today, writes K.C. Johnson of the Chicago Tribune . Per Johnson, Hoiberg said Cameron Payne, Ryan Arcidiacono, Tyler Ulis and Shaquille Harrison will now have to step up in Dunn\u2019s absence."},{"id":37955,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/about-last-night-10-23-18","date":"2018-10-24","title":"About Last Night: Griffin goes off while big men battle in Detroit","content":" While Joel Embiid and Andre Drummond were locked in the latest iteration of their trash-talking battle (see below), Blake Griffin was having a career night in Detroit. Griffin scored a career-high 50 points, capping it off with the game-winning bucket and free throw as the Pistons outlasted the Sixers 133-132 in a wild win in overtime at Little Caesars Arena . Griffin got hot in the second quarter, scoring 22 in the frame and finishing the first half with 28. The five-time All-Star was a beast all night and finished 20-for-35 from the floor, going 5-for-10 on 3-pointers . It was the first 50-point performance from a Pistons player since Rip Hamilton scored 51 on Dec. 27, 2006 . Griffin is just the sixth Detroit player to score 50, and the first to ever put up a statline topping 50 points, 10 rebounds and five assists. Griffin spoke to NBA TV about the solid start to the season for him and the 3-0 Pistons. Pistons\u2019 50-point scorers:  New season, Same story, Different ending  Before Griffin\u2019s heroics got the headlines, the story behind the story in Detroit was the latest chapter of the Joel Embiid vs. Andre Drummond showdown. One of the best and most enjoyable matchups last season featured the back-and-forth from Philly\u2019s Embiid and Detroit\u2019s Drummond. Embiid and his Sixers got the best of Drummond, sweeping the season series as Embiid averaged 26 points and 9.3 rebounds while playing in three of the four games. Drummond, for his part, put up 12.8 ppg and 12 rpg in the four games. But it was the off-the-court trash talk that drew headlines as the pair famously exchanged words over social media, so it was no surprise to see the duo once again jawing in this season\u2019s first tussle.  Embiid got the best of Drummond in the box score, going for 33 points and 11 rebounds to Drummond\u2019s 14 and 16 (on 6-for-20 shooting). It was another physical battle, which eventually ended with Drummond being ejected with 42.8 seconds left in regulation after his second technical foul. As you can see, the call that drew Drummond\u2019s ire was dubious as Embiid may have embellished the contact just a little bit . Embiid got the call \u2014 he may get another call from the league for his \u201cEmmy Award winning\u201d performance as Drummond tweeted after the game \u2014 but Drummond got the last laugh as his Pistons won with Embiid missing the potential game-winning 3-pointer in OT. The two teams will tangle Nov. 3 in Philadelphia, so get your popcorn ready for that Saturday matinee. Davis keeps Pelicans soaring  The Pelicans improved to 3-0 with a 116-109 home win over the Clippers behind Anthony Davis\u2019 34 points, 13 rebounds and five blocks. New Orleans is one of five remaining unbeaten teams in the league and they\u2019re winning by scoring at a ridiculous rate. Through three games, the Pelicans are averaging 132 ppg, a number brought down by Tuesday\u2019s season-low of \u201cjust\u201d 116 points. The Pelicans struggled from beyond the arc, missing 18 of 24 3-point attempts. \u201cSometimes you have nights like this,\u201d Pelicans guard Elfrid Payton said of the poor shooting and tight contest after two blowouts. \u201cEspecially late in the season, come playoff time, once teams start scouting us. We needed to go through this, to see our character.\u201d Check out how the Pelicans\u2019 scoring stacks up historically through the first three games: And we\u2019re rolling along, too  With the Pistons and Pelicans staying perfect, it was up to the Nuggets to keep their record unblemished to make it a perfect 3-for-3 night for the unbeatens. Denver didn\u2019t disappoint, dominating the Kings 126-112 behind Nikola Jokic\u2019s 14 points, 12 rebounds and six assists. The Nuggets had eight different players score in double-digits and never trailed to reach 4-0. Denver has won its first four games for the first time since starting 5-0 in 2009-10. \u201cIt was a good win,\u201d Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. \u201cObviously, not the defense that we had hoped for, but we\u2019re not going to hold everybody below 100.\u201d Quote of the Night  \u201dSome of us tried to stop him, and he just had an amazing day. We tried everything but sometimes you can\u2019t, you know?\u201d \u2014 Sixers forward Dario Saric, on Blake Griffin Dunk of the Night  It was Blake Griffin\u2019s night, as Joel Embiid found out the hard way. Go with what you know  Coaches love to run plays they know will work, and Dwane Casey pulled out an oldie-but-goodie on Griffin\u2019s game-winning drive. As pointed out, Griffin\u2019s drive was eerily similar to a play last February in which Raptors big man Jonas Valanciunas (like Griffin) took the inbounds pass, faked the handoff and drove right to the hole for the bucket. Valanciunas\u2019 dunk over John Henson beat the buzzer and sent the game to OT. (He wasn\u2019t as fortunate to get the and-one.) Toronto would go on to lose that game, but Casey obviously kept the play in his back pocket."},{"id":37933,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/lakers-rockets-rondo-calls-chris-paul-bad-teammate","date":"2018-10-24","title":"Lakers' Rondo opens up about scuffle, calls Chris Paul 'horrible teammate'","content":" Lakers guard Rajon Rondo opened up about his suspension Tuesday in an interview with ESPN, continuing to deny he spit on Rockets point guard Chris Paul in Saturday\u2019s skirmish in Los Angeles.

In the interview with ESPN, Rondo went even further, taking a shot at Paul\u2019s reputation around the league. \u201cOf course, the NBA went with his side because I got three games and he got two,\u201d Rondo said . \u201cEveryone wants to believe Chris Paul is a good guy.

Part of the frustration came in seeing his team fight back to force overtime and build \u2014 and then lose \u2014 a 142-136 lead in the extra frame. Another part of his frustration came from his view of the officiating in last night\u2019s game, and, it seems, the season at large. Before the start of this season, the Points of Education disseminated to all teams promised to focus on three key areas: freedom of movement on the perimeter and in the post, respect for the game and traveling. The Lakers and Walton were frustrated during and after night\u2019s game over what they thought were a lack of calls in some of those regards. Once the game was over, Walton opened his news conference with a lengthy comment about the officiating. In last night\u2019s loss, the Spurs attempted 38 free throws (making 28) to the Lakers 26 free-throw attempts (and 18 makes). \u201cLet me start here. \u2026 I wasn\u2019t going to say anything. I was going to save my money, but I just can\u2019t anymore,\u201d Walton said. \u201cIt\u2019s [74] points in the paint [by the Lakers] to 50, [and yet] again they outshoot us from the free-throw line \u2014 38 free throws. Watch the play where I got a technical foul. Watch what happened to LeBron James\u2019 arm. It\u2019s the same thing that James Harden and Chris Paul [drew fouls on and] shot 30 free throws on us the night before. \u2026 We are scoring 70 points a night. In the paint. \u201cWatch how Josh Hart plays this game. He played 40 minutes tonight. All he does is attack the rim. Zero free throws tonight. Zero. So to me, it doesn\u2019t matter. I know they\u2019re young, I get that. But if we are going to play a certain way, let\u2019s not reward people for flopping 30 feet from the hole on plays that have nothing to do with that possession. They\u2019re just flopping just to see if they get a foul call. And then not reward players that are physically going to the basket and getting hit. It\u2019s not right.\u201d The Lakers are the No. 2 team in the league scoring in the paint, averaging 71.3 ppg (trailing only the New Orleans Pelicans\u2019 mark of 76 ppg). After last night\u2019s loss, the Lakers rank 20th in free throw attempts (71) and 21st in free throws made (53). Additionally, the Lakers are 24th in total drives this season (110) and 23rd in free throw attempts (six) and free throws made (six) off drives. In 2017-18, the Lakers finished eighth in total free throw attempts and 16th in free throws made while ranking in the top 20 in total drives, free throw attempts and free throws made off drives. Lakers star LeBron James sparked the L.A. comeback and early OT lead with 32 points, 14 assists and eight rebounds. He said he knows there is an adjustment period ahead for the Lakers \u2014 both in learning the new points of education and in getting in L.A. its first win of 2018-19. \u201cIt\u2019s just hard with the new rule changes. You literally can\u2019t touch anybody \u2014 well, you can, you can touch somebody defensively,\u201d James said. \u201cYou just can\u2019t. There\u2019s nothing [you can do]. We don\u2019t know. We\u2019re trying to figure it out. But every time we\u2019re on the defensive end, especially in the third quarter, we just kept putting them to the free throw line.

(AP) \u2014 A planned museum will tell the story of basketball great Larry Bird and his Indiana roots. Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb announced Saturday that the museum will be part of a convention center being built in Terre Haute in western Indiana. Bird plans to donate personal items and memorabilia from his career with the Boston Celtics, Indiana State University, the U.S. Olympic team and beyond, The Tribune-Star reported. Holcomb predicts the museum will be a global draw, describing Bird as \u201cLarry the Legend \u2013 Indiana\u2019s favorite son.\u201d \u201cTo have this museum, which symbolizes what being a Hoosier is all about \u2013 hard work, determination and striving to be the best \u2013 and to have that in Terre Haute, that\u2019s just a match made in heaven and I can\u2019t wait to see it,\u201d Holcomb said. Bird grew up in French Lick, Indiana. He created excitement during his days at Indiana State University in Terre Haute when he led the school to the NCAA title game in 1979, although the Sycamores lost to Magic Johnson\u2019s Michigan State team. Bird\u2019s school pride carried over to his NBA career as a player, coach and executive. When the Celtics won the 1984 NBA Championship, Bird dedicated the win to Terre Haute. Details about the museum are still being developed, but plans include interactive displays about Bird\u2019s life and career. He won three NBA championships with the Celtics. Construction on the convention center is expected to start in the spring.

Through 39 games, teams are averaging 113.3 points per game, what would be the highest mark in the last 49 years (since they averaged 116.7 in the 1969-70 season). Ten different teams have scored at least 125 points in a night , and there hasn\u2019t been a single overtime game this season. Pace has been a factor. Through 39 games, the league has averaged 103.4 possessions (per team) per 48 minutes, up from 98.1 last season. That\u2019s a huge jump, but not as huge if you look at where we were at this point last year. Through six days (40 games) last season, the league was averaging 101.3 possessions (per team) per 48 minutes, and that mark dropped as the year went on. But efficiency has also been a part of the high scoring. The league has averaged 109.5 points scored per 100 possessions, up from 105 at this point last season. Effective field goal percentage is up, free throw rate is up, and turnovers are down. And though the pace may slow down in the coming weeks and months, efficiency typically goes up as the season goes on. So we may be in for a historically good offensive season.

LeBron James is two games into his latest adventure \u2014 you may have heard about it \u2014 with the Los Angeles Lakers. Chris Bosh, the third member of the Heat \u2019 s pioneering \u201c Heatles \u201d trio of the early 2010s, has not played in the NBA since February of 2016 due to a blood clotting condition that the NBA has ruled a career-ending illness. But he has a new team of his own as well. Bosh is diving into esports arena, taking on the role of Player Management Advisor with Gen.G , cultivating a player development program for the global esports and entertainment outfit. Bosh said the talents and skills necessary to be successful in this endeavor are closely aligned with the talents and skills he sharpened over the years from his time as a high school All-American in Dallas to his standout season at Georgia Tech and, finally, to his championship NBA and international career. An 11-time NBA All-Star and two-time champion with the Heat, Bosh, 34, reflects on his new role with Gen.G, how a life competing at the highest level in basketball prepared him for what comes next, the impact the groundbreaking moves made by the Heat\u2019s \u201c Big 3 \u201d had on the NBA landscape and beyond with NBA.com \u2019s Sekou Smith. * * * Sekou Smith:  Former Lakers standout Rick Fox was one of the first former NBA players to go all-in on the gaming world. What is it about esports that speaks to the interest and talents of guys such as yourself? Chris Bosh:  I think the team concept. People are going to be competing on a worldwide basis. And you are competing to be the best at something. That definitely speaks to guys in the NBA because it\u2019s such a small fraternity and we understand how hard it is to get there and how hard it is to maintain. I mean, Rick Fox being a champion and an actor at the same time, he had a different understanding of things. He understands teamwork on a championship level. He understands it on a really bad level, when you are a part of teams that aren\u2019t great, and then again he understands it on a great level because he\u2019s been to there. It\u2019s the same for me. We understand things from top to bottom. We can lend a level of expertise in this young industry. And it\u2019s important. It\u2019s truly going to be a worldwide sport. And it\u2019s only going to get bigger the more connected the world is and the faster the internet gets. And I think it\u2019s going to be a phenomenon that only continues to grow and we\u2019re going to look back at it in five or 10 years and be like, \u2018man, I remember when nobody even knew about esports. And now everybody is going to aspire to be a part of that.\u2019 SS:  Is that something that, at this stage of your life, you look back and realize is not normal \u2026 the fact that you\u2019ve been training to compete on the biggest stage since you were probably in middle school? CB:  Absolutely. I do kind of marvel at my journey. But at the same time, I look back at a lot of the steps, and maybe not every step, but a lot of the steps, and since I was 12 or 13, I look at the people who helped me and the moments that were inspirational to me and you can recall what my mindset and what my make-up was at that time to try and be the best. And making that decision with myself to really go for it, in whatever I was doing. So, it\u2019s one of those things where I\u2019ve always been very passionate about teamwork and team building. And yeah, I remember how it\u2019s made me feel and how I\u2019ve triumphed over different situations and it helped me get to this point now. And that\u2019s one of the main things that I try to implore young people to \u2014 video games, basketball, football, lawyer, doctor \u2014 anything you want to do or be, you\u2019ve got to make a decision or a choice to be the best. And you\u2019ve got to work at it. You\u2019ve got to go for it. And you know what? You\u2019re going to fail and you\u2019re going to come up short at times, and you have to do it for a very long time, you have to be committed to calling yourself the best. You have to be ready to compete. Because lots of people dream that dream, to be the best at something. But are you ready to commit to the hard work that it takes to get there? For me, it just became a part of my life and it was what it was. Another day, another basketball practice or another game. And it\u2019s just more work. It\u2019s always about the work. SS:  When you\u2019ve competed on the stage that you have, from being a state champion and McDonald\u2019s All-American and college star and top five NBA Draft pick, is it really difficult at this stage of your life to find anything else that pushes that same button \u2026 the competitive fire button that gets the adrenaline flowing and satisfies that hunger for elite-level competitiveness? CB:  Well, you know what, I\u2019ve just kind of left it where it is. Unless I\u2019m competing at something, I don\u2019t worry about it, trying to fill the void or match that feeling I had. But it is tough. And it is very hard. That\u2019s why I make it a point to try not to pay attention to it or to try and fill the void. Because you can\u2019t. It\u2019s impossible and it won\u2019t happen. The NBA is the best league in the world. It\u2019s no way you\u2019re going to be able to fill the void that the energy of performing before 20,000 people every night gives you. That\u2019s just impossible. So, I just try and move on from that and let it be a moment in time and leave it alone. I don\u2019t look for that to fulfill me and I\u2019m moving on to different things. Now that\u2019s \u2026 if I do play again, I\u2019m not going to say hey, \u2018I\u2019m this player that I was.\u2019 I\u2019m going to be a totally different player in a totally different situation and bring all those experiences with me. But looking to fill voids, it\u2019s one of those bottomless pits, man. It\u2019s not a ghost I\u2019m interested in chasing.  SS:  Clearly, you still look at the league from your unique perspective and still pay close attention to the game. Are you surprised at all at just how radically the game has changed schematically since you, LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, Carmelo Anthony and that celebrated draft class of 2003 first hit the scene? CB:  Yeah, I\u2019m surprised but I\u2019m not surprised. I am surprised at the speed and the 3-point shooting, of course. I\u2019m with the 3-point shooting, as you know. Not all [threes] are good [threes]. But I\u2019m more surprised by the pace of the games than I am anything. That\u2019s the main thing I\u2019m looking at now. I\u2019m like, \u2018whoa, these dudes are flying.\u2019 The game has gotten a lot faster. I was anticipating changes as far back as when I first game into the league, when the spacing was changing and big guys were playing in different spaces on the floor. But when that change actually happens, and it happens so quickly, it\u2019s just amazing. Everyone has to have the skills now, everybody is switching everything now, everybody is going to the Warriors now [laughing] \u2026 it\u2019s just different. SS:  You, LeBron and D-Wade took so much grief for teaming up in Miami. And now it\u2019s like everybody wants to pair up and make sure they go somewhere with other superstars and chase the dream. CB:  Yeah, everybody is getting smarter. SS:  Do you think, in terms of eras and the way the game is viewed, you are the guys who ushered in a new era in terms of players recognizing their true power and exercising that in free agency or whatever way they can? CB:  I think so, yeah. I mean, we definitely thought outside the box a bit. And that\u2019s what kind of changed the whole landscape, because it was moreso a situation where, \u2018hey, I\u2019m going to lock into this and that\u2019s going to be it because that\u2019s how you do it.\u2019 And it doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be that way. You can make your own decisions. So that\u2019s really the event or thing that started this whole narrative. There will be a day when we\u2019re able to look back on those moments and say, \u2018oh remember this or remember that.\u2019 And that\u2019s why we\u2019re here in this day with the modern athlete. * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

The Cleveland Cavaliers know that well, having dealt with James\u2019 departure not once, but twice, now. After James opted to sign with the Los Angeles Lakers in the offseason, the Cavs were hoping a roster led by All-Star big man Kevin Love and other holdovers from Cleveland\u2019s runs to The Finals would keep the Cavs in the playoff mix in the East. While it is still very, very early in the NBA season, the Cavs are 0-3 after Sunday\u2019s 133-111 loss to the Atlanta Hawks. Rookie guard Trae Young sizzled in that game, lighting up Cleveland for 35 points (including six 3-pointers) and 11 assists. After the loss, Love and fellow Cavs veteran Tristan Thompson spoke of some troubling trends they saw from Cleveland early in the season. In particular, writes Chris Fedor of Cleveland.com , defensive breakdowns have been an issue for the Cavs early in the season. Last night, the Cavs saw the Hawks go 22-for-46 on 3-pointers (46.8 percent) and shoot 49 percent overall. Veteran forward Tristan Thompson told Cleveland.com he was unhappy with the defensive effort overall that the Cavs gave. \u201cIt was embarrassing,\u201d Thompson told Cleveland.com. \u201cWe would never expect for us to come out like that, especially at home. \u201cNo disrespect to the Hawks, but those guys, their mentality this season is for their young guys to get reps, work on their game and just go out there and compete obviously at a high level, but understand it\u2019s not about the wins and losses, for them it\u2019s about the long journey to get back to where they want to get to. For us, that\u2019s not what we\u2019re here to do. For me, Kev, Kyle (Korver), G Hill, Swish (JR Smith), all the guys that have been part of winning environments, we come to compete. That\u2019s what we\u2019re here to do and tonight there was none of that at all. \u201cWhoever\u2019s in the game has got to be ready to play, take the scout serious and understand what we\u2019re doing. If you don\u2019t know what to do, ask questions. But don\u2019t go out there and say, \u2018I know. I know,\u2019 and then you come out there and get your ass whupped.\u201d Love, too, was not impressed with last night\u2019s performance. But, in particular, he has seen bigger issues for Cleveland all season long. \u201cThe last three quarters were pretty damn alarming,\u201d Love told Cleveland.com. \u201cOpening Night at home we expect to play better. We expect to play better in front of our home crowd. I don\u2019t know if alarming is the right word but it sure sounds right, just with our effort level. Our effort level wasn\u2019t there, especially defending the three-point line. They were just gunning and we weren\u2019t getting into them, we weren\u2019t physical.\u201d To date, the Cavs are 29th in Defensive Rating (121.4), 30th in blocks per game (1.7) and 28th in steals per game (4.7). Three of Cleveland\u2019s next four games are at home, which includes an Oct. 30 rematch with the Hawks."},{"id":37947,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/about-last-night-10-21-18","date":"2018-10-22","title":"About Last Night: Trae Young breaks out","content":" Comparing a rookie with one year of college experience \u2014 even one as impressive as Trae Young\u2019s flame-throwing freshman season at Oklahoma \u2014 to a future Hall of Famer is almost always an exercise in hyperbole. But fair or not, when you\u2019re an undersized point guard with virtually unlimited shooting range and a penchant for racking up numbers in ridiculous bunches, observers are probably going to mention you in the same breath as Warriors superstar Stephen Curry. In Young\u2019s case, the parallels only grew stronger when Hawks GM Travis Schlenk, formerly of those same Warriors, nabbed him in a Draft-day trade with the Mavericks in exchange for European wunderkind Luka Doncic and an additional first-round pick. If those comparisons bother Young, well, he didn\u2019t do himself any favors on Sunday, when he enjoyed one of the finest first-year performances in NBA history. Indeed, in savaging the Cavaliers for 35 points and 11 assists , Young achieved a stat line not seen from an NBA rookie since Curry himself in 2010, and only 11 rookies overall. Per Basketball Reference , that list of 11 rookies includes such legends as Michael Jordan, LeBron James, Oscar Robertson and Jerry West. Add Young\u2019s six 3-pointers, and the list shrinks to just Curry and Jason Kidd. Add Young\u2019s single turnover, and the list shrinks to just \u2026 Young. It was a welcome showing for the Hawks, who have been treated to flashes from Young since NBA Summer League but nothing like Sunday\u2019s outburst, in which he sank 13 of 23 shots overall and orchestrated the offense like a seasoned veteran. And it came in just his third NBA game. Given his dearth of experience, and the setbacks that no doubt lay ahead for a rebuilding Hawks team pegged to again finish near the bottom of the standings, it would be foolish to anoint Young this early. After all, he only just turned 20 last month. But for at least one historic afternoon, the Curry comparisons seemed pretty dead-on. (If nothing else, Doncic was impressed! ) Most players might ease themselves back into action in their first game back after needing a month to recuperate from knee surgery. Most players are not Russell Westbrook. It\u2019s obviously still early, but the NBA\u2019s per-game scoring average entered Sunday at a whopping 113.1 points, its highest since 1969-70. So when the high-powered Nuggets took on the even more high-powered Warriors, an offensive extravaganza seemed all but assured. Wrong! Against all expectations, a defensive battle broke out in Denver, with the Nuggets holding the Warriors under 100 points \u2014 something that happened only 16 times in their 103 games last season \u2014 thanks to Juancho Hernangomez\u2019s game-winning block at the rim. (Said teammate Gary Harris postgame: \u201cMi amigo!\u201d) The game was so rugged that Nuggets center Nikola Jokic, who made history on Saturday as the first NBA player to shoot perfectly in a triple-double since Wilt Chamberlain, actually missed a shot. ( Seven , to be exact.) The Warriors\u2019 first loss of the season extended their early shooting woes, with everyone not named Curry combining to shoot just 20 percent from 3-point range through three games. Think Harris knows he got away with one on this \u201cstrip\u201d of Kevin Durant? Few people have better insight into Chris Paul and Rajon Rondo than Doc Rivers, who coached both for extended stints with the Clippers and Celtics, respectively. But even he was at a loss after the two traded punches during an ugly brawl late in the Rockets\u2019 road victory over the Lakers late Saturday at Staples Center. (Paul, Rondo and Lakers forward Brandon Ingram were all given multi-game suspensions .) Some date the obvious disdain between the two back to 2009, when Rondo reportedly told Paul he\u2019d never win a championship. (Roughly 10 years later, Rondo\u2019s alleged remark has proven to be quite prescient.) Others have reported that Paul insulted Rondo by attributing his lone ring to riding the coattails of Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce and Ray Allen in Boston. Regardless, Rivers knows one thing: The two won\u2019t be exchanging Christmas cards any time soon. \u201cThey\u2019ve had their run-ins,\u201d said Rivers before Sunday\u2019s Paul-less game against the Rockets, as reported by Andrew Greif of the Los Angeles Times . \u201cI\u2019m not actually sure what it\u2019s all over. \u201cI know at one point they both wanted to be known as the best point guard but it\u2019s got to be more than that. There always is and I don\u2019t know what it is but there\u2019s no love lost, there\u2019s no doubt about that.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m just glad they didn\u2019t suspend Boris Diaw again.\u201d \u2014 Rockets coach Mike D\u2019Antoni, obviously still scarred from the Suns\u2019 playoff loss to the Spurs in 2007"},{"id":37926,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/rockets-lakers-suspensions-official-release","date":"2018-10-21","title":"Lakers' Ingram, Rondo, and Rockets' Paul suspended for involvement in skirmish","content":"NEW YORK \u2014 Los Angeles Lakers forward Brandon Ingram has been suspended four games without pay, Lakers guard Rajon Rondo has been suspended three games without pay, and Houston Rockets guard Chris Paul has been suspended two games without pay, for their roles in an on-court altercation with 4:13 remaining in the fourth quarter of the Rockets\u2019 124-115 win over the Lakers on Oct. 20 at Staples Center.

James scored 24 points, but Paul, Ingram and Rajon Rondo all were ejected after trading blows late in the Rockets\u2019 124-115 win Saturday night . Before the late drama overshadowed everything, James got several big ovations from a tremendously lively sellout crowd in his first home game since joining the Lakers as a free agent. \u201cThe atmosphere was great,\u201d James said. \u201cThe fans were extremely excited. We gave them everything that we could. Wish we could have gave them more with this win, but it was very electric.\u201d But perhaps that energy \u2013 and a flagrant foul by Houston\u2019s James Ennis III against Josh Hart earlier in the fourth quarter \u2013 contributed to the shocking fight that broke out with 4:13 to play. The Rockets were clinging to a 109-108 lead when Ingram was called for a foul while trying to defend an aggressive drive by James Harden, who finished with 36 points. Furious with the call, Ingram shoved Harden and then confronted referee Jason Phillips after getting a technical foul. In the ensuing group argument, Paul stuck a finger into the face of Rondo, who responded by punching his fellow point guard. Ingram then threw punches in the melee. James attempted to break up the fight by grabbing Paul, his friend. Paul claimed Rondo caused their fight by spitting on him. \u201cUnacceptable,\u201d Houston\u2019s Carmelo Anthony said. \u201cWe all know what happened. Ain\u2019t no need to keep going back and forth about that. What happened was unacceptable. It shouldn\u2019t have happened.\u201d Rondo\u2019s teammates said they didn\u2019t know whether Paul\u2019s claim was accurate. Lakers coach Luke Walton said his players were playing with extra aggravation after Ennis clotheslined Hart on a flagrant foul 4 + minutes earlier. \u201cI felt like the other team was trying to provoke us, and we fell for it,\u201d said the Lakers\u2019 Lance Stephenson, another peacemaker in the brawl. When tempers cooled after a nearly 10-minute break, Houston finished the game on a 15-8 run. Harden hit a key 3-pointer with 1:12 left to propel the Rockets to their first win of the season. \u201cWe played amazing tonight, and I feel like the fight probably put us back,\u201d said JaVale McGee, who had 16 points and six rebounds in his own Lakers home debut. \u201cIf there wasn\u2019t the fight, we probably would have won that game.\u201d Paul had 28 points, 10 assists and seven rebounds before getting tossed. Clint Capela had 19 points and 12 rebounds, and Anthony scored seven points off the bench as Houston rebounded from an embarrassing season-opening loss to New Orleans. Rondo had 13 points and 10 assists before getting thrown out. LeBron also had five rebounds and five assists, but he went 1 for 8 in the fourth quarter, missing all three of his 3-point attempts. \u201cYeah, James was James. That\u2019s what he does,\u201d Houston coach Mike D\u2019Antoni said. \u201cI thought it was a great game. It had some intensity and quickness, and how fast it was.\u201d The fight could leave with both teams without key rotation players due to suspension. NBA fights rarely get serious enough for the punches thrown by the principals in this brouhaha, and league discipline executive Kiki VanDeWeghe was actually in attendance. The Rockets are staying in LA to play the Clippers on Sunday night, and Houston coach Mike D\u2019Antoni laughed at the possibility of a suspension for CP3. \u201cI don\u2019t know, I might rest him (on a) back-to-back,\u201d D\u2019Antoni said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what the NBA says.\u201d"},{"id":37993,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/chicago-bulls-sign-shaq-harrison-official-release","date":"2018-10-21","title":"Chicago Bulls sign guard Shaquille Harrison","content":" The Chicago Bulls have signed guard Shaquille Harrison.

The second biggest reaction happened when the man they couldn\u2019t see, pitcher Clayton Kershaw, threw a third strike that sent the Dodgers to the World Series. Both were muted by the gasp caused when Rajon Rondo stole Chris Paul with a left hook flush to the jaw and instantly threw a special L.A. sports night for a loop. The late fourth-quarter scuffle between the two guards, who exchanged punches, was a disturbing scene on multiple fronts. Aside from spoiling the festive mood, the domino effect spilled over off the court, where the families of the two players had words after the game. And claims of Rondo spitting on Paul to push the Rockets\u2019 veteran to the edge was roundly trashed by Houston teammates who said Rondo\u2019s actions \u2014 if he indeed spit \u2014 were out of bounds, a violation of an unwritten rule. \u201cThat\u2019s unacceptable,\u201d said Carmelo Anthony. \u201cYou don\u2019t do that to nobody. You don\u2019t even see that in the streets.\u201d Taking it a step further: You rarely see punches thrown and punches landing in the NBA anymore. This was straight out of the roughhouse 1970s, when rules were loose and fists were tight. It\u2019s now up to the league office to sort out the messy details and issue the appropriate punishment; by coincidence, Kiki VandeWeghe, the NBA\u2019s basketball operations chief, was in the stands for a point-blank view. >>> NBA Suspends Ingram, Rondo, Paul In such cases, which again are rare, multiple suspension games are most likely in order for Rondo because his punch landed. The Lakers and Rockets engaged in an entertaining and close contest for much of three quarters, yet nothing suggested mayhem was in the making. There were no previous arguments or shoves or separating of bodies. Only one flagrant foul was called, when Rockets forward James Ennis lazily hooked Josh Hart by the arm instead of playing defense, sending Hart tumbling. But Hart rose to his feet and shot his free throws. Nothing came of that. Even the total sequence of the Paul-Rondo fight didn\u2019t quite seem logical. The start: James Harden drove the lane and referee Jason Phillips called Brandon Ingram for fouling with 4:13 remaining. Ingram argued the call after the whistle, but not before shoving Harden in the back, for no apparent reason. That gathered most of the players on the floor. In the scrum, Paul and Rondo began chatting. Suddenly, Paul wiped his mouth; he told teammates later that Rondo spit. Whether the act was intentional or merely a case of accidental spittle \u2014 or just Paul\u2019s imagination \u2014 well, it didn\u2019t matter at that point to Paul. He reacted by sticking a finger in Rondo\u2019s face, not once, but twice. Then: Just before LeBron grabbed his close friend Paul in a protective bearhug and attempted to pull him away, Rondo applied the pop. And another. And it was on. This level of fight often draws an uninvited third party, and in this case it was Ingram, who snuck in a right punch that grazed Paul, if that. Again, this was unusual; Ingram is calm by nature and has never earned a flagrant foul in his two-plus seasons. By then, Rondo was headed to the locker room, not even waiting for his ejection to become official. \u201cI saw it from a distance, but I won\u2019t get in there,\u201d wisecracked Rockets coach Mike D\u2019Antoni. \u201cI had glasses on.\u201d  Following the 124-115 Rockets\u2019 win , the situation grew personal, according to sources. While getting dressed, Paul received word that his wife, Jada, was verbally confronted by at least one member of Rondo\u2019s family before the buzzer. Paul was visibly upset when he emerged 15 minutes after the game and met his family in the back hallway of the Staples Center, a few feet from the visiting locker room. There was an animated conversation, mostly on Paul\u2019s end, for several minutes. His brother, CJ Paul, standing nearby, said: \u201cIt\u2019s crazy. I\u2019m just trying to calm everybody down. That\u2019s my job.\u201d Asked if he ever saw his brother react that way on the court, CJ Paul said: \u201cNever. That\u2019s not Chris.\u201d Rondo left Staples quickly after the game and didn\u2019t speak with the media. Nor did Paul; the Rockets play the Clippers tonight at Staples but Paul\u2019s status for that game is highly questionable. The league will likely rule on him (and Rondo and Ingram) before tipoff. The next lakers\u2019 game is Monday at home against the Spurs. \u201cI don\u2019t know what it was to get to that point,\u201d said Harden, flummoxed at what caused a disagreement to escalate into violence, \u201cand I don\u2019t care what it was.\u201d It\u2019s possible that there\u2019s previous bad blood between Paul and Rondo, two fierce competitors, but even if so, rarely do players carry past incidents into a new season. Sources said Paul was caught by surprise by Rondo\u2019s punch, and replays clearly showed he didn\u2019t expect it, which is why the punch landed so squarely. \u201cAs a man, Chris reacted the only way you can react,\u201d said Harden. It was \u2026 different for the NBA, where most disagreements draw little more than angry stares and threatening words and at most, noses touching. Oh, and some minor details: The Lakers are now 0-2 in the LeBron Era, once again surrendering big points and unable to make the necessary plays in a relatively close game. Harden scored 36 points and Paul had 28 before his ejection; while LeBron had 24. Rondo was three rebounds shy of a triple double before the fight. Taking their cue from their leader, the Lakers engaged in a team-wide shutdown from making fight comments after the game. LeBron was right in the middle of it, and he claimed ignorance. \u201cI didn\u2019t see anything,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t say anything to my team after the game.\u201d And the Rockets? \u201cWe all know what happened,\u201d said Anthony. \u201cIt was BS.\u201d * * * Veteran NBA writer Shaun Powell has worked for newspapers and other publications for more than 25 years.

And then, every October, the young guys begin their real rookie transition. Consider Wendell Carter Jr. of the Chicago Bulls. In a span of five days, he will have gone through a gauntlet of imposing NBA big men that would have some 10-year veterans flinching and wondering if their tendinitis needed a night off. Carter\u2019s on-the-job rigors began Thursday, when he became only the 10th Bulls rookie to start on opening night and was met in his matchup at center with Philadelphia\u2019s Joel Embiid. It continued Saturday in Chicago\u2019s home opener against Detroit, with Carter banging at various times against both Andre Drummond and Blake Griffin. Now the 19-year-old will travel to Dallas , where he\u2019ll get his first test against the Mavericks\u2019 salty DeAndre Jordan. And just for the record, in the Bulls\u2019 final preseason game , he had to cope with Denver\u2019s crafty Nikola Jokic. For someone so young, against such a slate of established or eventual All-Stars, Carter\u2019s early lessons have been difficult. There really is no other way. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s just chaos and confusion right now for him,\u201d Griffin said after leading the Pistons with 33 points, 12 rebounds and five assists in a 118-116 victory at United Center. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t look that way, but that\u2019s just how you feel \u2013 no matter what \u2013 when you\u2019re a rookie. The game is moving so fast.\u201d Carter, the No. 7 pick from Duke in this year\u2019s Draft , fell victim to foul trouble early and the Bulls\u2019 need to play catch-up late, which had coach Fred Hoiberg sticking with Jabari Parker at the end. Carter logged less than 18 minutes, finishing with eight points, two rebounds and two blocks. Drummond had foul issues of his own, exiting with his sixth after just 23:33. Still, Drummond and Griffin won the frontcourt battle with 43 points and 25 boards to Carter and Bobby Portis\u2019 combined 14 and 16. It wasn\u2019t the sort of Windy City debut Carter would have scripted. This was, after all, kind of a big deal \u2013 he\u2019s the player Chicago landed after an entire 2017-18 season spent gaming the NBA\u2019s Draft lottery system. The Bulls consciously tried to dive deep, won a little too counterproductively in December and January and wound up waiting until after the first six picks were gone. That tortuous process led everyone to Saturday, when 21,289 in the stands got their first official look at the alleged silver lining from last season\u2019s dark cloud. Carter wasn\u2019t happy with either his or his team\u2019s performance afterward, pulling his clothes from the hangers in his locker as he dressed and bemoaning the Bulls\u2019 lack of defensive communication (they\u2019ve given up 245 points in two games). Not to worry, though, Griffin said. \u201cHe\u2019s so talented, he\u2019s going to be fine,\u201d the Pistons star said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of time for him. I watched him play probably more than any other player in college last year \u2013 I really like his game. I\u2019ve known of him since he was in high school. He would be the least of my concerns if I was over there in the front office or on the coaching staff.\u201d Hoiberg and his staff have approached Carter\u2019s trial by fire by starting him in response to the challenges he handled in summer league and in the preseason. He arrived with a maturity, poise and defensive bent some players never achieve \u2013 a young Al Horford was a frequent comp \u2013 and isn\u2019t about to blow that image, no matter how many lumps he takes. \u201cI appreciate the fact I\u2019m able to play against these very talented bigs early on in my career,\u201d Carter said. \u201cLearn what I\u2019ve got to work on. I\u2019ve got to get stronger, that\u2019s the first thing I recognized. \u2026 Just being up against the best, I love the competition. I love going against the best players.\u201d Truth be told, Hoiberg said he talked with Carter on Friday about handling the frustrations he\u2019ll surely encounter. He\u2019s a little cranky about the officiating, for example, picking up at least three fouls in all six preseason and regular-season appearances while playing fewer than 23 minutes every time. He\u2019s does the \u201cverticality\u201d thing as if from a textbook and still hears a whistle. \u201cAt this point, I just feel like it\u2019s rookie calls. I don\u2019t care what nobody\u2019s saying, that\u2019s how I really feel,\u201d Carter said. \u201cI still have respect for the game, though. I have respect for the referees. If they call it, it\u2019s a foul. I\u2019ve just got to do better, learn from it.\u201d Then there was the chatter from Embiid in Philadelphia, a 19-point Sixers romp. \u201cHe was telling me what I should and shouldn\u2019t do,\u201d Carter said. \u201c\u2018C\u2019mon rookie, you\u2019ve got to do\u2019 something \u2018better.\u2019 Carter didn\u2019t chatter back, he said. \u201cNot yet. I\u2019m gonna get there at some point though.\u201d Drummond didn\u2019t pile on, thanks perhaps only to the referees. \u201cIf I played more, I think it woulda been more of a schooling,\u201d the Detroit center said. \u201cThis is a helluva three games for him.\u201d Drummond, 25, remembers what it was like six years ago, when he was the one absorbing the lessons. His rookie year got dinged 22 games due to a stress fracture in his back, an injury that compounded the basketball education. \u201cI learned my lessons the hard way,\u201d Drummond told NBA.com. \u201cPhysically. I started out being hurt. I had to just play and figure it out game by game. Watched films. Learned the guys that I played against. And figured it out.\u201d Drummond wound up averaging 7.9 points, 7.8 rebounds and 1.6 blocks. He had nine double-doubles and earned all-rookie status. But he\u2019s glad to be wiser now in the NBA\u2019s ways, given how few the shortcuts were. \u201cIt was more of a sponge season for me,\u201d he said. \u201cLearning the NBA. I mean, I was a young kid. Just tried to have fun with it. It was the game I loved and I was playing it at the highest level, so I just tried to enjoy every moment and take it in.\u201d That\u2019s Carter today, way at the front end of his career. He\u2019s got a notebook, he said, that he scribbles in bullet points, tips and lessons from each game after he\u2019s left the arena, his mind clear. Portis said he\u2019ll share more with Carter as the season goes on \u2013 there hasn\u2019t been much time and the Bulls haven\u2019t really hit the road yet \u2013 but most of this stuff will be hands-on. \u201cIt\u2019s as important a thing as you\u2019re going to face in this league,\u201d Hoiberg said. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve got a 19-year-old kid out there, it\u2019s human nature I think when you\u2019re playing against an opponent like Wendell has gone against, to hang your head a little bit.\u201d The coach added: \u201cIt\u2019s something every player goes through in this league. It\u2019s understanding who you\u2019re playing against. We\u2019re showing him a lot of personnel, film on who he\u2019s going to be going up against.\u201d Until the day, and it will come, when young guys are studying film of Carter, going through gauntlets of their own. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.
