He\u2019s got some company at the top. After struggling to start the season, Atlanta Hawks point guard Trae Young is playing fantastic basketball of late. While early indications had some prognosticators wondering how he\u2019d ever fit in the NBA, his recent play has him looking like a future star. Since the All-Star break , Young has topped 30 points in three of four games, with back-to-back 36-point games. Young shot just 19.8 percent from 3-point land in November, but he\u2019s been constantly improving from deep since then. In Sacramento, Marvin Bagley III has seen his playing time increase, and fans are seeing a franchise cornerstone and perennial All-Star. Before Wednesday\u2019s game \u2014 which he left after spraining his knee in the third quarter \u2014 Bagley was averaging 24 points, 11.7 rebounds and 1.7 blocks in the first three games since the All-Star break . He had three straight double-doubles, including a 28-point, 14-rebound showing against the defending-champion Golden State Warriors . Deandre Ayton, who had been the biggest competition for Doncic through the first half, is still lingering, but his numbers have dropped off enough to require a serious uptick to make a run at Doncic. Will anyone be able to catch Doncic? It might take a miracle, but Young and Bagley (assuming his injury isn\u2019t serious) are going to make him earn it. * * * Last week:  No. 1 Doncic missed the first two games after the All-Star break with a sore right ankle, but returned with a pair of respectable games. Doncic put up a triple-double in Dallas\u2019 121-112 loss to the LA Clippers with 28 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists. He then followed that up by leading the Mavs to a 110-101 win over the Pacers with another big game. He put up 26 points, 10 rebounds and seven assists and hit a clutch 3-pointer in the final minute to seal the win. The only negative for Doncic has been the 16 turnovers in the last two games \u2013 nine in L.A. followed by seven vs. the Pacers. Last week:  No. 2 As mentioned above, Young might be the only rookie with a chance to catch Doncic, who has likely already won over many voters with his consistent play. But looking at his numbers from February , you can start to see Young is gaining on Doncic to make a case. For the month, Doncic finishes with averages of 24.4 ppg, 9.4 rpg, 7.4 apg while shooting 44.3 percent overall (and 36.2 percent on 3-pointers). Young\u2019s numbers? Try 23.3 ppg, 4.3 rpg, 9.3 apg while shooting 41.0 percent overall (and 43.7 percent 3-pointers). Not much of a separation there, and Young \u2014 coming off back-to-back 36-point games \u2014 is certainly looking like he\u2019s ready to make a run at Doncic\u2019s top spot. Last week:  No. 4 Bagley is due to have an MRI on Thursday for what the team called a sprained left knee, which is terrible news considering just how dominant Bagley has been lately. The No. 2 pick got a rare start on Monday, going toe-to-toe with Karl-Anthony Towns with 25 points, 11 rebounds and a pair of blocks in 37 minutes. Bagley\u2019s been big for the Kings off the bench all season, but it\u2019s clear his time has come and \u2014 if the injury doesn\u2019t turn out to be serious \u2014 the Kings\u2019 playoff hopes hinge on his continued emergence down the stretch. Last week:  Not ranked The Knicks\u2019 rookie has turned into quite the sensation, capturing the hearts of fans at Madison Square Garden. The Knicks won back-to-back games this week, and Robinson was a major factor in both victories. In the Knicks\u2019 against San Antonio on Sunday, Robinson put up 15 points, 14 rebounds and five blocks to help New York snap an 18-game home losing streak. Two nights later, the 7-foot-1 center had 17 points, 14 rebounds, six blocks and three steals in New York\u2019s comeback win vs. Orlando . Robinson became the third rookie in the last 25 years to tally a double-double with at least five blocks in back-to-back games. The other two? Hall of Famer Yao Ming and future Hall of Famer Tim Duncan. The two wins brought attention to the energetic rookie, but he\u2019s been solid all month (10.9 ppg, 8.9 rpg, 3.3 bpg in 22.6 mpg off the bench). Last week:  No. 3 Ayton has seen his numbers dip since the All-Star break , but here\u2019s the thing: They\u2019re still pretty good. In three games, Ayton averaged 13.7 ppg, 10.3 rpg and 1.3 spg, but he was -14.3 in plus\/minus as the Suns went 1-2. That lone win, of course, came just a few days after Ayton promised he was ready to \u201ctake over\u201d and the Suns snapped their 17-game losing streak with a win against the Miami Heat. It will be interesting to see how the Suns handle Ayton down the stretch, and it would be nice to see the team actually run plays for their prize big man and let him \u201ctake over\u201d as he\u2019s promised. Allonzo Trier, New York Knicks Trier has been big in the Knicks\u2019 three games since the All-Star break , averaging 15.7 ppg on 53.8 percent shooting. His most notable performance came in the Knicks\u2019 win over the Magic, in which he scored 18 points, grabbed five rebounds and had three steals in 21 minutes. Josh Okogie, Minnesota Timberwolves In the four games since the All-Star break , the Wolves\u2019 lock-down defender has averaged 2.3 steals, thanks in large part to a four-steal game in a big win against the Kings. Okogie continues to be one of this class\u2019 best defenders Jalen Brunson, Dallas Mavericks The Mavs\u2019 other rookie guard is proving he belongs, and he had his best game Wednesday in Dallas\u2019 110-101 win against Indiana . Brunson started and scored a career-high 24 points\u2019 on 9-for-14 shooting, hitting 3 of 6 3-pointers, including a clutch one in the final minute. \u201cI\u2019m there to help keep the energy,\u201d said Brunson, who is averaging 16.8 points in the four games since the All-Star break . \u201cObviously Luka means a lot to this team, but I try to play pickup defense and stay available for my teammates. I\u2019m there to play hard.\u201d Jaren Jackson Jr., Memphis Grizzlies Jackson deserves a mention solely because he\u2019s been a fixture around here. Unfortunately, we won\u2019t be seeing him for awhile as the team shut him down \u201cindefinitely\u201d with a bruise in his right quadriceps. With Memphis out of the playoff hunt, we might not see the team\u2019s cornerstone big man again this season. \u201cWe\u2019ve talked about it and we\u2019ll be patient,\u201d coach J.B. Bickerstaff said . \u201cThe negative far outweighs the positive of him being rushed back. So we\u2019re not in a hurry.\u201d * * * (All stats through Wednesday, Feb. 27) Send any qfuestions or comments to my email or find me on Twitter @drewpackham .

However, Nowitzki never officially ruled out a return for season No. 22 and seems to be pondering that notion of late. Nowitzki started in last night\u2019s 110-101 home win against the Indiana Pacers, which marked his third straight start. He finished with 11 points, five rebounds and three assists, hitting a key 3-pointer early in the fourth quarter to help keep the Pacers at bay. The game was his first home start this season and afterward, Nowitzki said he\u2019s feeling better of late. When asked if his recent surge in playing time and role has shaped his thoughts on the future, Nowitzki did not commit to an answer. But, he also didn\u2019t deny the possibility of an NBA-record 22nd season come 2019-20. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said, per Brad Townsend of the Dallas Morning News . \u201cI haven\u2019t really thought about it. I would love to be there for the young guys one more year, but I think it depends on how the body feels. I\u2019ve had issues obviously this year. I had some knee swelling here the last few weeks, actually before the All-Star break, so it\u2019s not all great. But like I said I am feeling better. I am feeling stronger. But I think I\u2019m going to make that decision later on.\u201d Playing along side rookie phenom Luka Doncic as well as newly acquired former All-Star forward Kristaps Porzingis seems to entice Nowitzki as well. \u201cI think Luka and KP, if they stay healthy, stay together, they should be a great combo,\u201d Nowitzki said, per ESPN\u2019s Tim MacMahon . \u201cThey should play great off each other. Both have an incredible skill set for their size, incredible playmaking ability for their size. They should jell well, but we have to see how it goes next year.\u201d Nowitzki, 40, missed the first 26 games of this season while he recovered from an inflamed tendon in his left foot. Since his return \u2014 which came on Dec. 13 vs. Phoenix \u2014 he played 16 minutes or less in 23 of his 25 games (including multiple games of 10 minutes or less). However, he has seen a big uptick in minutes of late, logging 17 or more minutes in six of his last eight games. He played 22 minutes last night, which came after logging 26 minutes in a Feb. 25 loss to the LA Clippers and 25 minutes in a Feb. 23 loss to the Utah Jazz . Nowitzki has scored 11 or more points in four of his last five games and is 69 points away from passing Wilt Chamberlain for sixth on the NBA\u2019s all-time scoring list. \u201cI feel like I have a little more pep in my step,\u201d Nowitzki said, per ESPN. \u201cMy legs and my wind are a lot better than [earlier in the season]. I just feel better overall. I feel like I can actually contribute, whereas earlier I was struggling just to get up and down.\u201d To open the season, Nowitzki spent most of it coming off the bench \u2014 in large part to accommodate playing time for center DeAndre Jordan. In acquiring Porzingis from the New York Knicks , though, the Mavs dealt Jordan \u2014 which opened up some more playing time for Nowitzki. Per ESPN, Porzingis has quietly lobbied for Nowitzki to return for season No. 22, as the youngster has long been a fan of Nowitzki\u2019s game and wants to play with him. Nowitzki, who led the Mavericks to their only championship as the NBA Finals MVP in 2011, took pride in playing 77 games last season as a 39-year-old. He hoped for a similar number in what could be his final season. Instead, it\u2019s been more like 2012-13, when he missed 27 games after preseason arthroscopic surgery on his right knee. The highest-scoring foreign-born player, Nowitzki is sixth on the career list with 31,351 points. He was sixth to start the season before LeBron James passed him early. James is up to fifth and is just 98 points from passing Michael Jordan for the No. 4 all-time spot.

We don\u2019t know whether Wade\u2019s wild 3-point buzzer-beater to lift the Miami Heat over the reigning champion Golden State Warriors 126-125 is a career capstone. Although this is Wade\u2019s 16th and final season, who knows, bigger moments might remain in the Heat\u2019s 22 remaining regular-season games as they battle for a playoff berth. But this one was certainly joyous, memorable and something of a rarity \u2014 evoking a 10-year-old fumbled buzzer-beater by Devin Harris. The home crowd lavished applause on the hometown hero after Wade\u2019s off-balance shot banked in as time expired. \u201cWe just kept fighting and kept believing,\u201d Wade said on-court during a walkoff interview during which he heaped praise on Kevin Durant, who made some big shots and finished with 29 points. \u201cThe ball bobbled around and everything and I just got it and tried to put it up. The Good Lord put it in. I\u2019m just overwhelmed right now.\u201d It was the fifth \u2014 and quite possibly the final \u2014 game-winning buzzer-beater of Wade\u2019s career. As always, we rate game-winning buzzer-beaters on our Horry Scale. Reminder: The Horry Scale breaks down a game-winning buzzer-beater (GWBB) in the categories of difficulty, game situation (was the team tied or behind at the time?), importance (playoff game or garden-variety night in January?) and celebration. Then we give it an overall grade on a scale of 1-5 Robert Horrys, named for the patron saint of last-second answered prayers. *** DIFFICULTY: This was a 3-pointer, but not a long-distance 3. And Wade appeared to have a good look at the top of the key after receiving a pass from Dion Waiters. But Jordan Bell closed quickly and partially blocked it, knocking it out of Wade\u2019s hands. Twisting to regain control, Wade grabbed it and tossed it toward the basket off of one leg \u2014 a difficult move for an improbable off-the-glass bank shot as time expired. GAME SITUATION:  The Heat let a 24-point lead slip away, and were fighting mightily to rally from a four-point deficit in the final minute. This was a game the Heat, losers of seven of their last 10, needed to keep place in the hunt for the No. 8 playoff spot in the East. The wild sequence began with 10 seconds left and the Heat trailing by two. Wade dribbled up court, almost lost the ball but regained it, and found Waiters who returned it to Wade with about 2.5 seconds remaining. That\u2019s when Wade tried to shoot the 3, was blocked and regained it for the wild heave as time expired. The looks of disbelief on the Warriors said it all. CELEBRATION: The Heat didn\u2019t punch their ticket to The Finals, but you would have thought so from the celebration. Wade ran the length of the court while the crowd roared and his teammates caught up and mobbed him. He then mounted a courtside table and pounded his chest three times before taking a victory lap while waving a white towel. GRADE: The only thing keeping this from being the highest grade \u2014 five Horrys \u2014 is that it won a game with relatively little on the line. 4 1\/2 Horrys .  Celtics fall again  The Boston Celtics remain winless since the All-Star break, having lost four in a row. The latest came at the hands of the Portland Trail Blazers, who are now riding a five-game winning streak. The Blazers, behind Damian Lillard\u2019s 33 points, held off the Celtics 97-92 , after outscoring them by 11 in the third quarter. Boston played with more energy tonight but things still didn\u2019t go its way. Kyrie Irving scored 31 points in the loss. He may be 42, but the Hawks\u2019 Vince Carter still has hops and he can hang with the best. Watch him defy gravity to drop in a one-handed 2-pointer on the way down over the Wolves\u2019 Karl-Anthony Towns. He also took a forearm in the abdomen. It wasn\u2019t pretty, but James Harden scored 30 points in his first game after his 32-game streak of 30-plus points was broken on Monday night vs. the Hawks. And while 30 is nothing to sneeze at for the average player, it\u2019s a mediocre day for Harden, who scored 50-plus four times during the streak. But now he\u2019s struggling with his long-distance shooting. Still, the Rockets are winning while Harden is a bit off his lofty standards, taking down the Hawks on Monday and pulling ahead of the Charlotte Hornets in the fourth quarter to hold on for a 118-113 win . Harden\u2019s performance from the line (9-for-9) down the stretch and PJ Tucker\u2019s 3-point shooting (5-for-5) gave the Rockets the win. Amazingly, Harden was 0-for-22 from beyond the arc spanning three games before nailing a 3-pointer with 3:19 left in the third quarter. He finished the night 1-of-11 from long distance after going 0-10 on Monday, when the scoring streak ended. Being off on the 3 can hurt, as this sequence shows. With seconds left in the third quarter, Marvin Williams takes an outlet pass off the rebound from Harden\u2019s clanger, dribbles a time or two and heaves a shot from 6 feet inside the half-court line to beat the buzzer. It was a six-point turnaround that gave Charlotte a 94-90 lead entering the fourth. Though Charlotte couldn\u2019t close out Houston, Kemba Walker finished with 35 points in the Hornets\u2019 loss after pouring in 18 in the second quarter and 27 in the first half. Anthony Davis\u2019 look said it all. LeBron James showed again how he makes a big shot down the stretch to put away an opponent \u2014 this time the New Orleans Pelicans. The dagger came with about 31 seconds left and the shot clock winding down as the Lakers clung to a 120-117 lead. James lost the handle against Julius Randle, regained it and dribbled to the corner where he fired an off-balance 3-point shot that touched nothing but net as the shot clock expired. With a six-point lead and the Pelicans deflated, the Lakers held on to win 125-119 . It marked a much-needed win for the Lakers, who are in danger of falling out of the playoff hunt in power-packed Western Conference. The Milwaukee Bucks edged the Sacramento Kings 141-140 in overtime , and the loss may have been costly for the Kings. Marvin Bagley III went down near the end of the third quarter and writhed in pain before being helped off. After the game, the Kings called the injury a knee sprain and said Bagley would undergo an MRI on Thursday to determine the extent of the damage. A talented and lucky fan drained a half-court shot at halftime of the New Orleans Pelicans at Los Angeles Lakers contest to bag a cool $100K. Arguably, Dean Tran of Camarillo, California, has more reason to be happy about his shot than Wade was about his buzzer-beater. The 40-year-old becomes the eighth winner, aside from ex-Laker Vlade Divac, who shot for charity, to win the MGM Big Shot Jackpot, a promotion which began during the 2006-07 season. Tran is the second MGM Big Shot Jackpot winner of the season, and first since Ali Sabbouri of Anaheim, California won $30,000 on October 22, 2018. Who says basketball is all about hand-and-eye coordination? A round ball is a round ball, and some Atlanta Hawks used a soccer drill during pregame warm-ups. Alex Len even made a nothing-but-net shot using the top of his foot. https:\/\/twitter.com\/NBA\/status\/1100917711901728768 Boston coach Brad Stevens is not known for foul language. So when he let out an \u201cF bomb,\u201d it caught some of the young Celtics by surprise. Not Evan Turner."},{"id":35299,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/pelicans-peculiar-ad-situation-reaches-pivot","date":"2019-02-28","title":"Pelicans' peculiar situation with Davis reaches a pivot point","content":" LOS ANGELES \u2014 They represent a city that takes pride in being quirky, mysterious and wonderfully peculiar \u2014 although none of these traits quite make sense for basketball. The New Orleans Pelicans are different than most NBA teams right now, that\u2019s for sure, and not for all the right reasons. The Pelicans are caught in the crossroads as the regular season begins its lurch toward the end, dropping Wednesday\u2019s game to the Los Angeles Lakers, 125-119. New Orleans\u2019 best player, a top-five NBA talent, doesn\u2019t want to be there. They can\u2019t \u2014 or either won\u2019t \u2014 play him more than 20 or so minutes a night, if he plays at all. The Pelicans are headed for a losing season, there\u2019s a long-term vacancy at general manager, questions about ownership exist, and there are limited assets on the roster to create a drastic makeover. These are not normal or healthy signs for an NBA team, and potentially troublesome for one located in a small market. Yet the Pelicans have no choice but to steer the rocky ship until solutions can be found in the offseason, starting with what to do with Anthony Davis. The team and the player are trying to make the best of an uncomfortable (though not unprecedented) situation. Last month, when Davis informed the Pelicans through his agency (which also represents LeBron James) that he wanted to be traded , neither side imagined they\u2019d be in this situation heading into March: stuck with each other for another two months. Yet, here they are. \u201cWe had discussions and this is what we\u2019re doing,\u201d said Davis, referencing an arrangement that has him on a minutes restriction, mainly to protect him and the team. If Davis gets injured, that could affect his trade value this summer, which serves no one any good \u2014 not him, not the Pelicans and not any team interested in acquiring him. Also, the league frowns upon healthy players being stashed at home, especially if they\u2019re considered box-office types, so everyone\u2019s satisfied with Davis in uniform \u2026 sort of. In truth, the Pelicans and Davis can\u2019t wait for this season to end. It\u2019s not an especially good look, both sides putting on a good face through a tough situation. The Pelicans have begun plans for life after Davis, except there\u2019s no permanent general manager in place yet, with Danny Ferry serving in the interim since the firing of Dell Demps two weeks ago. Whomever gets the job must bring sturdy boots and rolled-up sleeves. This will be a chore, and the Pelicans can\u2019t afford to miss. That means the Draft (where they\u2019ll likely select a lottery pick), in any trade proposal for Davis, and in deciding what, if anything, to do with coach Alvin Gentry (whose status beyond this season is also unclear). A series of bad moves could put the franchise in peril. The Pelicans aren\u2019t considered a destination for A-list free agents \u2014 and their franchise player wants out, which raises red flags \u2014 making it imperative that they avoid big mistakes. That could have a rippling effect on a team that isn\u2019t exactly one of the league\u2019s big earners and already dealing with the perception that ownership, which also owns the NFL\u2019s New Orleans Saints, leans football. Gayle Benson, widow of Tom Benson, now controls the Pelicans and in her statement announcing the dismissal of Demps, she dismissed any notion of the basketball team as a lower priority. She used strong words \u2014 \u201cI am prepared to provide any and all resources to compete for championships\u201d \u2014 to reassure wavering fans about the immediate and long-term future of the club. Proof is in the production, however, and Benson\u2019s pledge will be tested by the upcoming decisions that will help or hurt the reshaping of the team. With the right move, the Davis trade could greatly help put bounce in the franchise. They could try to follow the same manner as the Indiana Pacers did in trading Paul George (and Indiana wasn\u2019t holding great leverage in its trade with Oklahoma City). Once the Draft order is determined in on May 14, teams holding lottery picks will begin putting together packages for Davis. A savvy GM will essentially hold an auction and use the incoming assets to keep or deal for players who can refresh the team and build toward the future. There\u2019s an urgency to draft correctly and find young players to develop and maybe even draft the next \u2026 Davis? Their costly blunder, and the reason they\u2019re in this situation, was a failure to maximize Davis\u2019 prime years. Crummy luck with injuries have also doomed the Pelicans the last four seasons, with none more damaging than DeMarcus Cousins rupturing his Achilles\u2019 tendon 13 months ago. To get Cousins from the Kings, the Pelicans dealt Buddy Hield, now a deadly shooter who might be reaching the All-Star fringes. Cousins, meanwhile, has since joined the Warriors, meaning the Pelicans have zilch to show for the trade. Each big face-palm, especially with a lottery selection, can set a team back a few years. After winning only one playoff series with Davis, the Pelicans can\u2019t afford to start from the bottom again, or else risk the sight of empty sections throughout their arena. In the meantime, there\u2019s a season to be played between now and any potential deal, a season that doesn\u2019t seem to serve much purpose with Davis simply biding his time and only halfway invested. \u201cWe just have to continue to play basketball,\u201d said Gentry, sounding trapped and resigned to this fate. \u201cAt the end of the day, that\u2019s all we can do.\u201d * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

(AP) \u2014 Nearly a year after police fatally shot an unarmed black man in Sacramento and a series of protests ensued in California\u2019s capital, the Kings and Milwaukee Bucks collaborated on a daylong summit Wednesday to address social injustice and encourage engagement and thoughtful discussions to try to bring about change. The event held ahead of a Bucks-Kings game came nearly a year after the March 18, 2018, fatal shooting of 22-year-old Stephon Clark. Clark\u2019s death ignited a series of protests that included protesters joining hands and blocking entrances to the Kings\u2019 downtown arena as owner Vivek Ranadive pledged his support and vowed to do his part to address the issue. \u201cI made a commitment that we would work hard to have an impact and do better and bring people together,\u201d Ranadive said Wednesday. Ranadive was joined by Milwaukee co-owner Marc Lasry for a panel discussion along with Mark Thomsen, the attorney for Bucks guard Sterling Brown. The Bucks were rocked last year when Brown, then a rookie, was Tased by police. He later filed a lawsuit saying the officers\u2019 use of a stun gun during his arrest for a parking violation constituted excessive force and that they targeted him because he is black. Both owners hope further awareness might encourage more teams and communities to get on board to have a dialogue about issues and create positive change. \u201cI hope this concept goes viral,\u201d Ranadive said. Brown said he appreciated the efforts by both organizations. \u201cWhenever the team can do something as big as this for the community, it\u2019s important,\u201d Brown said after the Bucks\u2019 morning shootaround. \u201cIt definitely lets some of the community members know that it is a push to make change, especially for myself, I\u2019m pretty big on that where I stand and my situation and the platform I have. I\u2019m looking to make significant changes in the community to help the urban, the black community progress.\u201d Brown had been talking with officers while waiting for a citation for illegally parking in a disabled spot outside a Walgreens at about 2 a.m. on Jan. 26, 2018, when officers took him down because he didn\u2019t immediately remove his hands from his pockets as ordered. An officer yelled: \u201cTaser! Taser! Taser!\u201d Brown later received a formal apology from the city\u2019s police chief. \u201cI knew Sterling and it didn\u2019t sound like him,\u201d Lasry said. \u201cSterling, in my opinion, was just a great kid. And it didn\u2019t make sense, it didn\u2019t sound like him. \u2026 As we got more information we sort of came to a crossroads, which is there\u2019s Sterling\u2019s side and there was the other side. For us an organization we ended up coming down on Sterling\u2019s side simply because we knew him as a person.\u201d Thomsen credited the Bucks for backing his client from the very start.

Wednesday, however, wasn\u2019t ordinary.  Golden State coach Steve Kerr invited some students \u2014 including ones from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High, the school in Parkland where 17 students and staff were killed in a massacre on Feb. 14, 2018 \u2014 into the Warriors\u2019 game-morning practice in Miami. And long after the session was over, Curry was throwing alley-oop lobs and engaging in 3-point contests with kids who couldn\u2019t believe they were hanging out with stars from the two-time defending NBA champions.  \u201cYou hate that you have these opportunities because of what happened at our school,\u201d said Jeff Foster, a teacher and former coach at Stoneman Douglas. \u201cBut at the same time, it\u2019s nice to have these contacts and meet people and coach Kerr has been at a few of the events with our kids \u2026 you\u2019re always glad to sit around and talk to him, whether it\u2019s about basketball or politics. And we just spent time doing both.\u201d     While Kerr was chatting with teachers, some of the boys and girls got onto the court with the Warriors. Andre Iguodala, Shaun Livingston, Kevin Durant and Curry were among those who stuck around after shootaround for about an extra half-hour, posing for photos and talking about basketball.  \u201cIt\u2019s special having them here,\u201d Curry said as he watched the kids playing on the same court where the Warriors would visit the Miami Heat on Wednesday night. \u201cThey\u2019ve done so much in the wake of the shooting, speaking out, using their platform that they have, the entire student body. They come to just have fun, enjoy themselves. I know that means a lot.\u201d  Matt Fisher won\u2019t forget it anytime soon.  Fisher is among the captains of Marjory Stoneman Douglas\u2019 boys team, which lost its district championship game in quadruple-overtime and then fell in the first round of the state tournament. He plans to play college basketball at Division III\u2019s Washington University in St. Louis next season, but if that doesn\u2019t work out at least he can say he caught a lob from Curry for a dunk.  \u201cThis is just a surreal opportunity that I really appreciate,\u201d said Fisher, who talked Curry into having a 3-point contest against him. It was briefly tied at 1-1 before Curry prevailed.  Kerr invited the students into the practice, and makes no secret about his desire for gun reform. Kerr was 18 when his father Malcolm, then president of American University of Beirut, was murdered. He\u2019s followed the students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas and their \u201cMarch For Our Lives\u201d organization\u2019s efforts closely.  \u201cThe fortunate thing is the young people leading this drive are going to be much more impactful than old people like me,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cIt\u2019s true. Older people have been trying to do something but they haven\u2019t made the impact. But the next generation, the country belongs to them. So I\u2019m really proud of what they\u2019re doing.\u201d "},{"id":35296,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-thoughts-changing-draft-age-19-18","date":"2019-02-27","title":"Blogtable: Thoughts on lowering the minimum age for NBA Draft?","content":" * * * The NBA and its players reportedly are moving forward with plans to eliminate the \u201cone-and-done\u201d rule, thus lowering the minimum age for entering the NBA Draft from 19 to 18. Good decision?  * * * Steve Aschburner :  Many professions, especially those that collectively bargain with labor, set thresholds and qualifications for entry, so let\u2019s dispense with any right-to-work histrionics, OK? For the NBA\u2019s sake, I\u2019d prefer to see the age go up rather than down , so that the players we see are more developed and ready to help their teams. But the league owes nothing to the NCAA, and if the G League can function as a proper affiliate system across all 30 NBA franchises \u2013 and only the rare precocious stars leapfrog legit farm-system seasoning \u2013 then there\u2019s no reason players can\u2019t learn in Erie, Pa., and Schaumburg, Ill., rather than Durham, N.C., and Lexington, Ky. Shaun Powell :  I think lowering the age limit only helps maybe two or three players. That\u2019s it. Yes, a Zion Williamson can go straight to the pros because obviously he has an NBA body already and a decent game. But this will also encourage scores of wanna-be\u2019s to toss their name into the ring and \u2026 not get drafted at all. If that\u2019s what the rule is intended to do, then fine. But it also puts a strain on NBA GMs and scouting. Coming to a high school gym near you: Dozens of NBA scouts! John Schuhmann :  Yes. It\u2019s silly to have an 18-year-old go to college just to play basketball for one season and (in some cases) leave to prepare for the Draft before the spring semester is even over. Some players will make mistakes by skipping school and it will be tougher for both players and teams to evaluate how they measure up within the potential Draft class (a mix of high school and college players). But the improved and expanded G League offers a safer landing spot than what was in place prior to 2006.  Sekou Smith :  No-brainer decision.  And certainly from where I\u2019m sitting, it\u2019s a good decision. Folks will debate the merits for and against 18 or 19 for years to come. But it won\u2019t change the fact that there are outliers involved. I\u2019m just a believer that anything past a player\u2019s 18th birthday is a rule that goes against everything this country is about (yes, I\u2019m taking it there.). The same choice kids make to attend college should include the option of bypassing the college game altogether for the professional option, be it in the NBA or anywhere else. The players deserve the freedom of choice. The teams drafting them also deserve the opportunity to evaluate these potential prospects in a much more detailed way, so if there is going to be a rule change there needs to be some comprehensive change to the entire ecosystem for all involved."},{"id":35279,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-which-teams-primed-shine-free-agency-2019","date":"2019-02-27","title":"Blogtable: Who's your early favorite for success in 2019 NBA free agency?","content":" * * * Several teams have positioned themselves to be big players in free agency this July . Who\u2019s your early favorite to win the summer?  * * * Steve Aschburner :  We\u2019re going to have the four teams in the two biggest markets \u2014 the New York Knicks and Brooklyn Nets, and the Los Angeles Lakers and LA Clippers \u2014 all flexing max-salary cap space when free agency opens. I like pulling for underdogs, so it would be interesting to see Brooklyn \u2014 with a nice core of young talent \u2014 and the Clippers grab the biggest names and the headlines . Still, it\u2019s hard to deny the star power of the Lakers, and the presumption that team president Magic Johnson and All-Star LeBron James are going to get at least a major part of what they want. Especially with James\u2019 agency behind the scenes, spinning dials, pushing buttons and pulling levers. Shaun Powell :  I like the team in LA. The Clippers, I mean. They have solid complementary pieces on team friendly contracts in Montrezl Harrell, Lou Williams and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, along with cap space of course and all the charms of living and playing in LA. Plus, their owner, Steve Ballmer, has a few dollars in the bank. It will be a coup if the Clippers grab two A-list free agents away from the claws of the Lakers. John Schuhmann :  I can\u2019t seen the future and I probably don\u2019t think the same way that most of the high-profile free agents do. But I like the positions that that Clippers and Nets have put themselves in. They have the cap space to add a star or two, but are also ahead of the Lakers and Knicks in regard to the infrastructure \u2014 coaching, culture, role players and system \u2014 to support those stars. While the Lakers underachieve and the Knicks play for Lottery combinations, the Clippers are in seventh place (despite the transitional state of their roster) in the tougher conference and the Nets have taken a huge step forward (looking like one of the league\u2019s best franchises in regard to player development) to put themselves in position to give their young core some playoff experience  Sekou Smith :  Whoever gets Kevin Durant\u2019s commitment is going to walk away from the free agent summer as the early winner. I\u2019m excluding the Anthony Davis drama from consideration, since it\u2019s technically about free agency and not summer trade season. I love how both teams in New York and Los Angeles are prepared to be major players , which means the Lakers, Clippers, Knicks and Nets could all claim victory when the dust settles. There\u2019s enough top shelf talent to go around and plenty of cap space available for someone to take the plunge and become the (new) face of a franchise this summer. * * *"},{"id":35302,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-which-rookie-has-improved-most-season","date":"2019-02-27","title":"Blogtable: Which rookie has improved the most this season?","content":" * * * Which rookie has improved the most since the start of the season?  * * * Steve Aschburner :  It is tempting to say Marvin Bagley because the Sacramento forward seemingly has taken such a leap lately, from about 13 ppg through November to 18.4 ppg in February . But most of that is due to playing time \u2014 per 36 minutes, he has gone from 19.3 ppg to 21.8 ppg. Minnesota\u2019s Josh Okogie has boosted himself from reserve to starting his past 23 appearances, and is shooting better. But I\u2019m going with Dallas\u2019 Luka Doncic. Doncic not only is scoring more, from 18.5 ppg through November to 24.1 ppg in February , but he has been forced to improve as opponents have focused more and more attention on him since he served early notice as a Kia Rookie of the Year favorite. Shaun Powell :  Marvin Bagley has shaken off a minor injury to rise right along with the Kings , and in fact is one of the major reasons the Kings are in playoff position. He also had to hear plenty of chatter about how the Kings should\u2019ve drafted Luka Doncic instead and I wonder if that lit a fire within him. In any event, he\u2019s putting up solid big man numbers and putting the Kings in position to someday having a future big three with De\u2019Aaron Fox and Buddy Hield. John Schuhmann :  Marvin Bagley\u2019s skills \u2014 good hands, footwork and touch around the basket \u2014 were pretty clear from Day 1. But with increased opportunity and confidence, he\u2019s been making more use of those skills of late, averaging 17.9 points and 9.5 rebounds per game over the last five weeks and earning a promotion into the Kings\u2019 starting lineup. He\u2019s actually seen a drop in scoring efficiency over that stretch, but has rebounded and taken care of the ball better than he did over the first couple of months. The evolution of Trae Young\u2019s playmaking has been fun to watch over the course of the season, Mitchell Robinson ( averaging 17.4 points, 14.2 rebounds and 5.3 blocks per 36 minutes in February ) is looking like a real prospect in New York, and Kenrich Williams has been a bright spot in New Orleans over the last month.  Sekou Smith :  Based on what I saw from him early on to now, I\u2019m going to have to go with Marvin Bagley III . There are others, namely Luka Doncic, Trae Young, Jarren Jackson Jr., Colin Sexton and Deandre Ayton, who have had their moments. But I have to keep reminding myself that Bagley reclassified and should be in college right now. He\u2019s emerged from his slow start and is coming on now for a Kings team that is working hard to earn a spot in the Western Conference playoff picture. Bagley\u2019s size\/skill combination for a player as young as he is remains the most intriguing part of his game. He\u2019s averaging more than 18 points and 10 rebounds in his last 10 games and is enjoying the finest stretch of his NBA career right now. This is a better than realized crop of rookies and Bagley, the No. 2 overall pick, deserves his seat at the front table. * * *"},{"id":35297,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/lebron-reality-show-now-court","date":"2019-02-27","title":"For LeBron and Lakers, reality show now on the court","content":" * Tonight on ESPN:  Pelicans vs. Lakers, 10:30 ET LOS ANGELES \u2014 Here\u2019s a pitch for the next show to be developed by SpringHill Entertainment, the production company co-founded by LeBron James and Maverick Carter: What about an inside look at a glamorous NBA franchise and how a locker room collapsed under burning issues? The star player becomes a flashpoint for the boiling frustration, and they scramble to find elusive solutions as the season begins to pass them by. And, get this: The main role can be played by \u2026 wait for it \u2026 LeBron himself! Hollywood loves nothing more than a deliciously dramatic reality show, and how convenient is it that one is unspooling right before LeBron\u2019s very eyes, or shall we say, very weary and confused eyes? Just as he wields power over his growing entertainment empire, he\u2019s also mainly responsible for the situation buckling the Lakers as they stumble and flail and threaten to crumble during this stretch run toward the playoffs . Should they blow this chance \u2014 and it\u2019s getting slippery by the game \u2014 it would be a rude gut-punch, though not a damaging one, to LeBron\u2019s legacy, which he cares so deeply about. It would raise questions moving forward about his leadership style, his curious link to the player agency he helped form, his degree of power within the Lakers (and whether it\u2019s too expansive). And, most importantly, it would raise questions about his ability to attract A-list free agents before either his contract runs out or Father Time taps him on the shoulder. At the moment, the Lakers are broken, far from what team president Magic Johnson and LeBron and others projected upon signing last summer. Where do we start? A number of teammates, according to those close to them, resented LeBron\u2019s role in the Anthony Davis chase \u2014 when half the rotation was ready to be shipped to New Orleans \u2014 and also his comments after the All-Star break, when LeBron seemed to blame everyone but himself for embarrassing losses to the Pelicans and Grizzlies. Most of the locker room held great admiration for LeBron before the season began, and how could they not? But the mood is shifting \u2026 and how could it not? LeBron\u2019s also playing for a coach who \u2014 if the whispers are true \u2014 he doesn\u2019t totally endorse. So, how do you expect Luke Walton to feel? LeBron\u2019s play since returning from his groin injury hasn\u2019t been stellar, with notable defensive lapses, which perhaps could be blamed on age and LeBron\u2019s tendency in the past to pick his spots on when to play both ends of the floor. He could get away with that when his teams in Cleveland and Miami won. That\u2019s not so true now. Given all that, some perspective is needed and should be heard through the noise of the past few days. The Lakers simply wouldn\u2019t be in this position if LeBron didn\u2019t miss a month. Also, Lonzo Ball, who was developing nicely before twisting an ankle, still hasn\u2019t returned. Poor defense, turnovers and misfires from the free throw line are team-wide problems, not just a LeBron problem. Besides, even on his worst days, LeBron is more productive and consistent and far beyond the next best Laker, whoever that is. Finally, there is this: This was always designated as a bridge year with a still-maturing young core that needed seasoning and vets on one-year contracts. But of course, LeBron is being paid and treated as a savior, and making the playoffs was supposed to be a given. Plus, some of the Lakers\u2019 losses have been downright shameful. The Davis drama, which seemed to have LeBron\u2019s fingerprints all over it, not only hasn\u2019t helped matters, but also caused plenty of grief and distrust among his teammates. Does LeBron have their backs, or is he trying to shove a knife in them? Because of his obvious clout, not a single player will confront LeBron for answers about where they stand. They\u2019re either too young and intimidated, or too old and deep into their careers and don\u2019t want to jeopardize any chances of getting an extension. This is a different climate for LeBron. He was held in high regard in Cleveland and Miami locker rooms. He was the superstar who always and willingly shared his off-the-court riches with teammates \u2014 gifting them designer headphones, expensive cell phones and anything else he hawked. When they went out with him socially, they could count on automatic entry beyond doors closed to most people. It was good to be teammates with LeBron. He took care of them, looked out for them, elevated them. And now? Given what is transpiring with the Lakers, his current teammates probably shouldn\u2019t expect any cameos in \u201cSpace Jam 2.\u201d It\u2019s also a case study in the power LeBron has within the Lakers. He\u2019s more or less partners with Magic, a relationship he didn\u2019t have with Pat Riley in Miami \u2014 Riles drew the line more than once with LeBron \u2014 and not to this extent in Cleveland. That kind of power and voice within the organization doesn\u2019t go unnoticed among teammates. Suppose, for example, the Lakers strike out on trading for Davis this summer. Can you imagine the handful of players dangled in that trade returning to the team next season, willing and anxious to forgive and forget? There is a temporary fix. The Lakers can start winning, starting with Wednesday\u2019s game against the Pelicans ( 10:30 ET, ESPN ). They can douse the internal and external fire by moving up the standings in the West and making a run for the postseason. They can do so with LeBron being \u201cactivated\u201d, dropping MVP-like performances and serving as an example to follow. Every team involved in the chase for one of the last few West playoff spots (Kings, Clippers, Spurs) have flaws. Yet none of them also have LeBron. Should the Lakers keep stumbling, then all eyes will be on LeBron and how he handles that. Will he play out a meaningless season, a distant experience for a player who\u2019s made the last eight NBA Finals? Or will he check out? Wherever LeBron and the Lakers go from here, drama will follow, and the biggest surprise is this isn\u2019t being caught on film and ready to be produced. Is it not entertaining enough? * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

The result was no different last night, as the Toronto Raptors walloped the Celtics 118-95 in a game that was basically over at halftime. After the game, the storyline was about the Celtics, who have lost three straight and five of their last seven games. They are fifth in the Eastern Conference, 9 1\/2 games behind the first-place Milwaukee Bucks and 2 1\/2 games behind the Philadelphia 76ers for the No. 4 seed. To Celtics guard Marcus Smart, the issue behind Boston\u2019s woes is easy to pinpoint. \u201cNobody is together,\u201d Smart told reporters Tuesday night. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to have everybody on the same page doing the same things at the same time.\u201d Smart had even more to say on the topic, too, per Kevin Arnovitz of ESPN.com . \u201cWhat are the main ingredients to those collapses? Not being together. And that\u2019s it. We\u2019re just not together. Plain and simple. That\u2019s it,\u201d Smart said. \u201cBecause if we were together, that wouldn\u2019t happen. We\u2019re all talking and linking up, but like I said, it\u2019s something we\u2019re going through, and it\u2019s something we\u2019re going to have to continue to work at and figure it out.\u201d The Celtics led 32-30 after one quarter and scored the opening points of the second, but the Raptors answered with an 18-0 run to lead 48-34 at 7:14. Leonard\u2019s fast break dunk at 3:06 put Toronto up by 20, 59-39. The Celtics had twice as many turnovers in the second quarter (eight) as made baskets (four). \u201cWe have to be a lot more connected as a team,\u201d Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. \u201dThat\u2019s been the theme for a while. \u2026 \u2018I thought we were outplayed in every which way.\u201d Celtics All-Star guard Kyrie Irving had little to say about the loss to reporters on Tuesday night. When asked about the Celtics\u2019 inability to recover from opponent\u2019s runs, Irving said, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d The Celtics face the Portland Trail Blazers tonight ( 8 ET, ESPN ) and said of the focus for that game: \u201cJust remaining tough.\u201d Irving also had little to say about Stevens\u2019 comment that Boston is taking too many \u201dshortcuts\u201d on defense. \u201dI don\u2019t know,\u201d Irving said. \u201dIt\u2019s up to Brad.\u201d And, lastly, when asked about Smart\u2019s comments that the team isn\u2019t playing together, he said, \u201cI mean, that\u2019s Marcus\u2019 opinion. I respect it.\u201d When asked if he shared Smart\u2019s opinion, Irving did not respond and ended the postgame session. Overall, it was a rough night for Irving. He finished with seven points \u2014 his fewest in a game since scoring three points against Detroit on Oct. 27 \u2014 and shot 3-for-10 overall. He did not play in the fourth quarter. Last season, Boston was one of the NBA\u2019s more resilient teams as well as one of its best defensive teams. In 2017-18, the Celtics finished No. 2 in Defensive Rating (103.1) and opponent field goal percentage (44.0), first in opponent 3-point percentage (33.9) and third in opponent points allowed (100.4). To date this season, Boston ranks No. 2 in opponent field goal percentage (44.5), but has fallen to seventh in opponent points allowed (106.9), eighth in opponent 3-point percentage (34.3) and fifth in Defensive Rating (106.1). Veteran center Al Horford said he has been concerned with the Celtics\u2019 inability to weather blows from opponents in games this season. Smart, as well, express frustration at Boston\u2019s inability to capitalize on hustle plays that marked seasons past. \u201cFor whatever reason, we\u2019re not fighting, continuing to fight at that level like in the past,\u201d Horford said, per ESPN. \u201cIt happened in Chicago where we didn\u2019t recover, and it happened again tonight.\u201d \u201cRight now, it doesn\u2019t surprise me because that\u2019s just how things are going for us,\u201d Smart said, per ESPN. \u201cIt surprises me in the fact that that\u2019s not who we are, but at this moment, it doesn\u2019t. We\u2019ve just gotta fix it. Like I said, it\u2019s going to be fixed. It can and will be fixed.

Now, the Celtics are a team looking for answers. \u201cWe have to be a lot more connected as a team,\u201d said coach Brad Stevens. \u201cThat\u2019s been a theme for a while.\u201d Marcus Smart, who finished with five points and was a team-worst minus-25 on the game, echoed that sentiment. \u201dNobody is together. We\u2019ve got to have everybody on the same page, doing the same things at the same time.\u201d The Celtics were most out of sync in a brutal second quarter, when Toronto built a 31-point lead by outscoring Boston 36-13. One exchange in the quarter didn\u2019t sit well with Smart, who was waiting on the wing for what might have been a wide-open corner 3. Instead, Jaylen Brown drove down the lane, leading to a charge and a furious Smart.

At 37-24, the Celtics currently sit fifth in the Eastern Conference, 9.5 games behind first-place Milwaukee and reeling after losses to the Bulls and now the Raptors, who extended their home dominance over the Celtics to eight straight, a streak that dates back to April 4, 2015. Boston gets a chance to bounce back Wednesday at home against the Trail Blazers, who had their own troubles Tuesday, with several members spending 30 minutes stuck in an elevator in Beantown. The Knicks are on a roll, and the Garden was rockin\u2019 again Tuesday night. Thanks to a massive effort from its reserves, New York rallied to beat the Magic 108-103 for its first two-game winning streak since November. No Knicks starter scored in double digits, but the bench stepped up in a big way. The reserves scored 75 points as coach David Fizdale found a spark that ignited Madison Square Garden. Henry Ellenson, fresh off signing a 10-day contract last week, had a huge night in his second game as a Knick with 13 points, nine rebounds and five assists in a career-high 36 minutes. \u201cWe just fought,\u201d Ellenson said in a walkoff interview after the whistle. \u201cI just want to make the most of it.\u201d The Knicks, who ended an 18-game home losing streak Sunday by beating the Spurs, outscored the Magic 30-13 in the fourth quarter to pull off the win. If the Knicks are playing for this summer\u2019s No. 1 draft pick, you couldn\u2019t tell it by the effort and vibe in Madison Square Garden on Tuesday. The Thunder didn\u2019t have many answers for slowing Nikola Jokic, but someone probably should have picked him up on this not-so-fast break. Jokic was huge in Tuesday\u2019s nightcap, just missing a triple-double with 36 points, nine rebounds and 10 assists to lead the Nuggets to a 121-112 win over the Thunder . Jokic drew M-V-P chants from the home crowd and even stepped up in the final minute, showing no hesitation when the ball became lodged on top of the backboard.

Via a post on his Web site , the legendary Los Angeles Lakers and Milwaukee Bucks center said he will be selling his championship rings from 1980, \u201985, \u201987 and \u201988. All of those titles were earned while he was a member of the Lakers. In addition, he will be auctioning other items including game-worn uniforms and jerseys. One such item is the game-used and signed ball from his final game in the NBA in 1989. In his blog post, Abdul-Jabbar said he was auctioning with \u201cmuch of the proceeds\u201d going to benefit his Skyhook Foundation charity. That charity seeks to help kids learn about science, technology, engineering and math. \u201cMy sports memorabilia also have a history. My history. My life,\u201d Abdul-Jabbar said. \u201cAnd, oddly, since my life is still happening and ever-evolving, I am less personally attached to those items than I am to my desire to create new history for myself \u2014 and futures for others. Much of the proceeds from my auction will go to support my charity, the Skyhook Foundation, whose mission is to \u2018give kids a shot that can\u2019t be blocked.\u2019 \u201cSo, when it comes to choosing between storing a championship ring or trophy in a room, or providing kids with an opportunity to change their lives, the choice is pretty simple. Sell it all. Looking back on what I have done with my life, instead of gazing at the sparkle of jewels or gold plating celebrating something I did a long time ago, I\u2019d rather look into the delighted face of a child holding their first caterpillar and think about what I might be doing for their future. That\u2019s a history that has no price.\u201d The auction is being hosted by Goldin Auctions. Abdul-Jabbar also wrote that he is not having the auction because of financial problems. In addition to various items from his NBA playing days, Abdul-Jabbar is also auctioning off his class ring from Power Memorial High School, a pair of his iconic (game-worn) goggles, an ice bucket, a portrait of Abraham Lincoln, a VHS recording of his Hall of Fame induction in 1995 and various other awards from his past. Abdul-Jabbar, 71, is the NBA\u2019s all-time leading scorer with 38,387 points. When he left the game in 1989 at age 42, no NBA player had ever scored more points, blocked more shots, won more Most Valuable Player Awards, played in more All-Star Games or logged more seasons. In his storied career, Abdul-Jabbar was Rookie of the Year, a member of six NBA championship teams, a six-time NBA MVP, a two-time NBA Finals MVP, a 19-time All-Star, a two-time scoring champion and a member of the NBA 35th and 50th Anniversary All-Time Teams."},{"id":35332,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/mike-bibby-sexual-misconduct-allegations","date":"2019-02-26","title":"Bibby faces sexual misconduct allegations in Arizona","content":" PHOENIX (AP) \u2014 Police are investigating sexual abuse and harassment accusations made against former University of Arizona and NBA player Mike Bibby, according to officials in the school district where he now works as a high school coach. The Paradise Valley Unified School District issued a statement saying it was notified on Feb. 14 of the police investigation into claims against Bibby, now the head basketball coach at Shadow Mountain High School. A Phoenix municipal court granted a restraining order to a Shadow Mountain teacher last Friday, The Arizona Republic reported. The teacher said Bibby groped her and rubbed against her after pulling her into his car on school grounds in February 2017, according to the document. The teacher reported the allegations to the school\u2019s resource officer on Feb. 13, according to the document. Bibby referred questions to his attorney, Donald Harris. \u201cI can say with pretty much certainty this alleged incident didn\u2019t happen and that will be shown down the road,\u201d Harris said. \u201cMichael Bibby did not participate in a sexual assault of any way, shape or form that was alleged by this lady two years ago.\u201d The Phoenix Police Department has confirmed it is investigating allegations involving staff at Shadow Mountain.

However, it\u2019s safe to say the 2018-19 edition of the trip was hardly scrapbook-worthy stuff. The Spurs lost to the Brooklyn Nets on Monday , giving them a 1-7 mark on the Rodeo Road Trip \u2014 which, per ESPN, is the team\u2019s worst mark on the trip in history . A night after their defense was absent in a loss to the New York Knicks , the Spurs went across town and couldn\u2019t get their offense going. San Antonio was held to its lowest point total of the season, and the NBA\u2019s leading 3-point shooting team was a season-worst 16.7 percent behind the arc. After the loss, the Spurs had to settle for whatever positives they could find. \u201cI was very angry after the game last night. I\u2019m very pleased about this game because we held a good team to 101 points and if we continue to do that we\u2019ll be in good shape,\u201d Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. \u201cJust, you can\u2019t control whether the ball goes in or not, so I think it was a good night for us.\u201d Their annual road trip began because of the San Antonio Stock Show and Rodeo, which takes over the AT&T Center. The only win the Spurs scored on the trip came on Feb. 12 \u2014 a game in which they had to survive a wild finish just to get that victory. Their 1-7 mark, coupled with the rest of the goings on in the Western Conference during that span, has San Antonio sitting at No. 8 with a one-game lead over the ninth-place Sacramento Kings. The Spurs have made 21 consecutive playoff appearances, tied for the second-longest streak in NBA history. \u201dYou have to stay confident, got to believe in yourself that hard work is going to make it better. Got to believe that shots are going to fall. Got to believe that if you put effort into defense and into doing the schemes that it\u2019ll work,\u201d said Spurs forward LaMarcus Aldridge. \u201dLike I said, going home doesn\u2019t guarantee wins, but hopefully it\u2019ll put some new life into us and try to get some wins.\u201d The good news for the Spurs is that of their remaining 20 games, 12 of them are at home. San Antonio is 22-7 at AT&T Center this season and last night\u2019s game was the only rest-disadvantage game left on their schedule.  In addition, the Spurs came out of the All-Star break as the only team in the league with more games remaining against the opposite conference than they have within their own conference. Including their first three road games after the All-Star break, the Spurs will play 14 of their final 25 games against the East. That includes six total games against the East\u2019s bottom four (two each against Atlanta, Cleveland and New York). San Antonio gave up at least 30 points in every quarter Sunday in its 130-118 loss as New York snapped its franchise-worst home losing streak at 18 games. The Spurs then surrendered 28 in the first quarter in Brooklyn, falling behind by eight. \u201cIt was a terrible shooting night,\u201d Spurs guard DeMar DeRozan said, per the San Antonio Express-News . \u201cOur shooters couldn\u2019t knock down shots they\u2019ve been knocking down all year.

After 32 consecutive games of scoring 30 or more points, though, that run came to an end in the Houston Rockets\u2019 119-111 home win against the Atlanta Hawks last night. Hall of Famer Wilt Chamberlain has the all-time mark for consecutive 30-point games at 65. For his part, Harden seemed relieved to have the streak done, saying after last night\u2019s game: \u201cIt was cool but I knew I wasn\u2019t going to get to No. 1.\u201d Harden last came up short of 30 points in a Dec. 11 win over Portland, when he had 29. During the streak, he scored 50 or more points four times, including a career-high 61 in a win at the Knicks on Jan. 23. And, already this season, he has joined Chamberlain, Michael Jordan and Rick Barry as the only players with 20 games of at least 40 points in the first 50 of a season. As we bid adieu to Harden\u2019s historic run, let\u2019s take a look back at some of his best performances from the 32-game streak \u2026 Every streak has to start somewhere and, sorry Lakers fans, but you were the first victim. Harden not only scored 50 points, but also added 10 rebounds, 11 assists and two steals for his second triple-double of the season. For good measure, Harden scored 11 points in the final five minutes to help seal a 126-111 win. In a big win against a fellow playoff contender, Harden came up with a huge 47 points in a win against the Utah Jazz. However, this one might best be remembered for the shot Harden didn\u2019t make that had many fans up in arms. His attempted step-back (step-back) wing jumper with with 54.6 seconds left over Ricky Rubio had the NBA Twitterverse up in arms . (The NBA later admitted it missed calling a travel on the move.) There\u2019s always an air of drama surrounding any Rockets-Thunder matchup from any number of storylines: the Harden vs. Russell Westbrook showdown, their past playoff matchups and their respective places in the Western Conference pecking order this season. Harden scored 41 on this night, marking his seventh straight game of 30 or more in the run. That was the most in the NBA since Westbrook had eight 30-point games back in November of 2016. The Thunder, Celtics, Pelicans and Grizzlies all suffered losses fueled by 40-point efforts from Harden from Christmas Day to New Year\u2019s Eve. As the calendar turned to 2019, Harden saved a strong dose of scoring venom for the rival Golden State Warriors. He not only dropped 44 points on them \u2014 his fifth straight game with 40 or more \u2014 but nailed an improbable game-winning 3-pointer with 2.7 seconds left in OT to drop Golden State. Given the workload and number of shot attempts Harden garnered during the streak, efficient scoring stats were a rare sight for him during the run. One of those nights came in early January, though. He had 43 points, 10 rebounds and 12 assists in just 29 minutes vs. Cleveland, becoming the first player in NBA history to have a 40-point triple-double in less than 30 minutes of play. After an uncharacteristically bad shooting game a night earlier in a loss to the Orlando Magic, Harden had 57 points on 17-for-33 shooting (and 6-for-15 from deep) to power a blowout victory. This game marked the 17th straight game in which Harden notched 30 or more points, moving him past Kobe Bryant on the list. His 17 straight games was the NBA\u2019s longest run since Chamberlain had 20 such games in 1964 (a mark he would pass four games later). What do you do when you\u2019ve scored a season high a night earlier? If you\u2019re Harden, you go top it. He had 58 points and 10 rebounds as the Rockets shot an NBA-record 70 3-pointers against Brooklyn. However, it was Spencer Dinwiddie who stole the show on Harden\u2019s night, scoring 25 fourth-quarter points to spark the Nets to a 145-142 overtime victory. Madison Square Garden has been home to many great NBA moments and, on this date, several more took place . Harden scored a career-best 61 points, hitting the 30-point mark with three minutes to go in the first half. In this game, he became the first player with 60 points and 15 rebounds since 2000 (Shaquille O\u2019Neal), the first player to attempt 20 3-pointers and 20 free throws and the first player with three 55-point games in a month since 1963 (Chamberlain). Oh, and he also moved into fourth place on the 30-point game scoring streak. The Raptors and Rockets waged a classic that featured two Kia MVP types in Harden and Toronto\u2019s Kawhi Leonard. Fittingly, the game came down to a late 3-point attempt by Leonard, who was (of course) guarded by Harden. Leonard missed the shot and Harden notched his 22nd straight game with 30 or more points. In addition, he led his team and Houston\u2019s opponent in scoring for the 22nd straight game. That moved Harden past Jordan for the second-longest streak in NBA history behind Chamberlain, who did it in 40 in a row. The Jazz were victimized by Harden earlier in the streak \u2014 see the \u201cdouble step-back\u201d game above \u2014 and fell prey to him again in February. Harden not only had 43 points, 12 rebounds, five assists and six steals, but came within a block of his first career five-by-five game. In racking up this 30-plus point game, he took ownership of the third-longest such streak in NBA history (trailing only Chamberlain, of course). Some nights for Harden, getting to 30 points looked as easy as a step-back 3-pointer. Other nights, that wasn\u2019t quite the case. Such was the scenario against Dallas with under a minute to go. Stuck at 28 points and with a win well in tow, Chris Paul found a way to get Harden a decent look at a 3-pointer from the left wing. He nailed it with 52.8 seconds to go, running his streak to 30 straight games, putting him on the cusp of the second-longest mark ever. No one can take the second-longest 30-point scoring run away from Harden. That was assured on this date when he notched 30 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists against the Lakers. However, it was unlikely to be a truly memorable night for Harden. Why? He fouled out with 1:24 remaining and his Rockets blew a 19-point lead to LeBron James and Co. in stunning fashion. Still, no matter how this game is viewed, it will forever be a standout moment in Harden\u2019s career. * * * Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":35349,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/harden-30-point-streak-ends","date":"2019-02-26","title":"Harden's streak of 30-point games ends at 32","content":" James Harden\u2019s Wilt-like run of scoring is over.

The reigning Kia MVP came up just short, finishing with 28 points on another tough shooting night. Harden, who said he was still bothered by a neck problem, connected on just seven of his 21 shots and missed all 10 of his 3-point attempts. Harden\u2019s 32-game run of games with 30 or more points was the second-longest in NBA history behind a 65-game streak by Wilt Chamberlain. Harden got to 28 points with 23.3 seconds left and had the ball on Houston\u2019s last possession but didn\u2019t attempt a shot with the game in hand. Considering the quadruple team, the Hawks appeared to be aware of the situation and were not about to commit a foul or let Harden break free for a meaningless layup that would have extended the streak. Harden, who last came up short of 30 points in a Dec. 11 win over Portland, didn\u2019t seem too upset about his streak coming to an end. \u201cIt was cool, but I knew I wasn\u2019t going to get to No. 1,\u201d Harden said before walking away chuckling. Harden averaged 41.1 points during the streak. He scored 50-plus points four times and recorded a career-high 61 points on Jan. 23 against the Knicks. The streak also included a five-game run of 40-point outings. With a pick-and-roll pocket pass to Kyle Kuzma, LeBron James passed Andre Miller for 10th place on the all-time assists list with 8,525 and counting.

James finished with 24 points, 12 rebounds and 11 assists, but the Grizzlies held off the Lakers 110-105 . The triple-double was the 79th of James\u2019 career, which breaks a tie with Wilt Chamberlain for fifth-most in NBA history. DeMarcus Cousins scored a season-high 24 points and 11 rebounds in the Warriors\u2019 121-110 victory over the Hornets. It was Cousins\u2019 first 20-10 game with Golden State and the first time he\u2019s exceeded 30 minutes this season. And for good measure, Cousins received a bizarre technical foul in the fourth quarter when he tossed Jeremy Lamb\u2019s shoe, which had fallen off, out of the lane. Cousins argued his case with the referees, but the league rules stipulate that throwing an object into the stands \u2014 for any reason \u2014 merits an automatic technical foul. After the game Cousins told reporters, \u201c Next time, I\u2019ll just step on the shoe , roll my ankle, break it, tear an Achilles.\u201d Four days after emerging from a scary car accident with only minor injuries, Karl-Anthony Towns was happy to be back on the court \u2014 and it showed. Towns had 34 points, 21 rebounds and five assists, as the Timberwolves beat the Kings 112-106 at Target Center. During a 21-1 run in the second quarter that put the Wolves ahead to stay, Towns made three 3-pointers and threw down a windmill dunk. Moments later he added a monster putback. Towns, who had never missed a game in his NBA career before sitting out the last two while being evaluated for concussion-like symptoms, has a new outlook. \u201cYou\u2019re so used to just grinding your body to dust every single day, and you don\u2019t get a chance to realize how much you appreciate being there,\u201d Towns said. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to be available for my teammates, be available for the Wolves, but when you sit out you\u2019re looking at a different perspective.\u201d With Dirk Nowitzki making what was likely his final trip to the Staples Center as a player, Clippers coach Doc Rivers made sure Nowitzki received the proper recognition. Rivers called a timeout with nine seconds remaining, grabbed the microphone at center court and implored the crowd to give the future Hall of Famer a standing ovation before time expired. \u201c I didn\u2019t plan that ,\u201d Rivers told reporters after the game. \u201cHe deserved it.\u201d Side note: Nowitzki became the fourth player in NBA history to appear in 1,500 regular-season games, joining John Stockton (1,504), Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (1,560) and Robert Parish (1,611) Trae Young drilled a career-high eight 3-pointers and scored a career-high 36 points, becoming the first rookie to outscore Harden since Towns on March 18, 2016."},{"id":35328,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/bucks-giannis-antetokounmpo-out-vs-bulls-sore-keen","date":"2019-02-26","title":"Antetokounmpo (right knee) out vs. Bulls","content":" CHICAGO (AP) \u2014 Milwaukee Bucks All-Star forward Giannis Antetokounmpo sat out Monday night\u2019s game against the Chicago Bulls because of a sore right knee.

Towns was out of those games because he was in the NBA\u2019s concussion protocol after being involved in a car accident Thursday. Interim coach Ryan Saunders told reporters Monday that Towns has cleared the NBA\u2019s concussion protocol and is OK to play tonight. He is listed on today\u2019s NBA injury report as available. The Wolves host the Sacramento Kings tonight ( 8 ET, NBA League Pass ) and are trying to stay in the Western Conference playoff chase. Minnesota went 1-1 without Towns, getting a victory Friday against the New York Knicks and falling Saturday to the Milwaukee Bucks . The Wolves are 28-31 and No. 11 in the West, trailing the No. 8-seeded LA Clippers by six games. Towns had played in his second consecutive All-Star game last weekend before he was involved in a car accident on his way to the airport in Minnesota. He was cleared to fly and arrived in New York and was originally ruled questionable, but after further examination he was placed in the concussion protocol. Towns had started every game since being the No. 1 pick in the 2015 draft, the longest streak to begin a career since 1970-71.

Over the first 14 days, teams could be looking forward to the All-Star break. And over the last eight days, teams are recovering from (at least) a full week off. So the month could feature some strange results (there were a couple of those on Sunday ) and some strange numbers. Just look at the top 10 in offensive efficiency in February . Three of those 10 teams \u2014 Chicago, Detroit and Orlando \u2014 rank in the bottom 10 offensively for the season as a whole . The Bulls, amazingly, rank 30th offensively this season, but are first in the month of February. Maybe the addition of Otto Porter Jr. was a missing puzzle piece. And maybe both the Pistons (with Reggie Jackson playing the best basketball of his career) and Magic (with improved bench play) have found something in the urgency of a playoff race. Time will tell if the results are real or just a product of February\u2019s disjointed schedule. For the Milwaukee Bucks, it doesn\u2019t seem to matter what month it is. Their offense has had some hiccups in the two weeks surrounding the break, but the only loss they\u2019ve suffered this month was in the game they played without Giannis Antetokounmpo.

Losing 50 of the 61 games your team plays \u2026 it\u2019s a deflating existence for any team. For the Phoenix Suns, this has summed up much of their season to date. For a veteran like Jamal Crawford, in his 19th NBA season, he knows it could be enough to break the collective spirit of an entire group. But Crawford also knows from experience what\u2019s on the other side of the Suns\u2019 current struggles. He\u2019s been around long enough, seen tough situations evolve often enough to know that there is nothing permanent in the NBA. There is always change coming, and you better be ready to adapt. You don\u2019t last as long as Crawford has in the NBA without understanding the NBA ecosystem and how quickly things can change. So, if the Suns are looking for some light at the end of this season\u2019s tumultuous journey, they need only pull up a seat next to their veteran sharpshooter and listen. Crawford shared some of his hard-earned wisdom with NBA.com\u2019s Sekou Smith as the Suns try to shake out of their funk tonight against the Miami Heat at American Airlines Arena: * * * Sekou Smith:  You\u2019ve been in this league a long time, 19 years. You could be ring chasing at this stage of your career. What are you doing here with the Suns? And what keeps you focused, and your juices flowing, on a team that\u2019s struggling the way the Suns are these days? Jamal Crawford:  Yeah, just the knowledge. Sometimes \u2026 and not just sometimes, it\u2019s really gratifying to see something go from point A to point C, rather than just being there for the end result. Sometimes the journey is greater than the destination. And for me, obviously, on the youngest team I\u2019ve been on in years, it\u2019s a challenge in some regards because you want guys to get it right away. And that\u2019s not always realistic. I know we want instant gratification in this league and in life. You see some guys get it, the light comes on, for some guys faster than others. And that\u2019s okay, everybody develops at his own pace. So you have to be patient and just fight through the tougher times and remember that the sweat equity always pays off. It\u2019s been a challenge, yes, but you have to make the best of every situation in this league if you are committed to being a true professional. SS:  Y ou\u2019ve been around this league for so long. You know how difficult it is to climb and how difficult it can be when you feel like you might be stuck in a tough situation. How does the vet keep the young guys locked in and focused without anything tangible (in terms of wins and losses) to cling to go? JC:  That\u2019s a really good question, because as I said, we are definitely an instant-gratification society. But there are moments you have to build on. We had a streak, I think it was in December, yeah December, where we won four games in a row . And everything that we were saying, the vets at that time, was coming to fruition on the floor. So for that stretch of time it was like a lightbulb went off. \u2018These guys aren\u2019t just talking,\u2019 was the feedback. You are preaching the right things and the wins are coming to. That\u2019s when the magic happens. That was a big moment, but we didn\u2019t sustain it. SS:  Exactly, it only worked for a few games,. So how do you convince them that the hard work really pays off when they haven\u2019t really felt it? JC:  That\u2019s the challenge. When you get the wins and all of it comes together, you\u2019ve gotten through the hardest part. But when you get it going, the message hits home harder and that\u2019s when you take off as a group. But it has to be rooted in something guys can really see and feel. It can\u2019t just be words. We\u2019ve got plenty of that stuff going on, the hype, all over the league. Make sure it\u2019s real and then it\u2019s something you can really believe in. SS:  Devin Booker and DeAndre Ayton are clearly special talents. But how good can these guys be? You\u2019ve played with and against the best the game has to offer for nearly 20 years. What\u2019s the ceiling for these guys? JC:  Oh, these guys are stars. And they won\u2019t get that credit until we win. That\u2019s just the way the league is, always is and always will be. But you\u2019re talking about a 22-(Booker) and a 20-year-old (Ayton) and Book is already averaging 25 [points] and seven [assists] and [Ayton] is a guaranteed double-double. Book is already getting traps every game, getting double-teamed. He\u2019s already getting that kind of attention. But he\u2019s not going to get that respect until we win. Then he\u2019ll be an All-Star. Same with DeAndre. I\u2019m telling you.  SS:  So what\u2019s the toughest part of the transition for those guys? You\u2019ve been in this before, you\u2019ve lived it, trying to climb the food chain in this league. What\u2019s the toughest part of going from the young guy who can get numbers to a true impact player capable of changing outcomes and really leading a franchise? JC:  I think it\u2019s how you impact others and how that translates to winning. I mean, a guy can get 20 points a game. But if you are not winning, who\u2019s really paying attention? It\u2019s like, \u2018yeah, his game is nice. But I need to see him do it when it counts, when it really matters and something is on the line.\u2019 That\u2019s the flip side of when you see a guy who is just as good, but he\u2019s averaging 16 or 17 points on a team that\u2019s getting wins and respect. Everybody wants that, every guy who plays in this league is searching for that acknowledgement and ultimately that respect. Wining always cures all. And it\u2019s about timing. You have to be ready for it. SS:  You speak of timing, and I think about the way you play, the way you\u2019ve always played and cannot help but think you were a few years ahead of the time where you\u2019d have been an even more effective player given the wide-open style of this era. You\u2019ve played 19 years but it could have been crazy if that was 19 years in a different era, no? JC:  Oh my gosh, I\u2019m telling you. Totally different, totally different. And I say that because when I came into the league I was a point guard, if you took six [3-pointers] in a game you were going to be sitting on the bench, I don\u2019t care how good you were. I\u2019m serious. Back then it was about going to your dominant scorer, Shaq or Tim Duncan, or your dominant wing scorer, a Kobe [Bryant], T-Mac [Tracy McGrady], Paul Pierce or Allen Iverson, those guys. A point guard\u2019s job was to get them the ball. You weren\u2019t coming down the floor and shooting 30-footers off the dribble. A coach would be on you, and you could get that shot anytime. Work it around and get the ball where it\u2019s supposed to go. So yeah, the game has changed dramatically in my years in the league. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s fun for these [younger] guys, because it\u2019s definitely fun for me now [laughing]. SS:  Nineteen years, that\u2019s crazy. You look younger now than you did as a rookie. You\u2019ve got a full head of hair. You\u2019re always in game shape, I\u2019ve seen you in the middle of the summer and you look exactly the same. How many can you do? How long can you keep this up? JC:  Oh, I don\u2019t put a limit on it. I can keep going and going. And I will, as long as someone feels like I can bring something to the table, I\u2019ll be here. No limits. SS:  So how do you keep all of these guys on this team in that right mind while they are going through these struggles? You\u2019ve seen it, lived it, this kind of stuff can break a young team\u2019s collective spirit before they get to where a team like the Sacramento Kings are, when things start to turn in the right direction. JC:  You remind them that they have to be mindful of the bigger picture. It\u2019s like we\u2019re building a house. And right now we\u2019re on the foundation. And that\u2019s hard work. But there is beauty in the struggles. If you are learning lessons, it\u2019s not always just a loss you\u2019re taking. There\u2019s a lesson there, too. You have to be willing to accept that and not waver on your goals and your mission. I truly believe that.  SS:  I feel like you are uniquely positioned to spread the message. You\u2019ve played in so many different situations, big and small, winning and losing. There\u2019s some wisdom in your journey \u2014 that\u2019s clearly not over \u2014 that guys can learn from. You\u2019ve stayed true to the same mission you had from the start. Why did the struggle never turn you or lead you to sour on this process? JC:  Yes, yes. It wasn\u2019t my intention to keep my love of the game over everything. I love it so much. Basketball has given me everything. And even getting to this point. This might not be the ideal situation for anyone right now, but you know things can always get better. SS:  I should point out to you that you are playing the fewest amount of minutes [17.6 minutes per game] you\u2019ve played since your rookie season [17.2 mpg], taking the fewest amount of shot attempts since then [6 field goal attempts per game], playing a position (point guard) you haven\u2019t really played since the early days of your career \u2026 JC:  I know where you are going with this, and listen, I\u2019m in a great space \u2026 obviously I know I can still play at a high level, and can do much more then I am on the court. But this particular role at this time has turned into me trying to help others grow their game, and not about my own personal whatever \u2026 and there is a beauty in that as well. * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

As one of the favorites for Kia MVP honors this season, Antetokounmpo scored 12 of his 30 points in the fourth quarter to help Milwaukee hold off Boston in a key post-All-Star break game. Warriors 125, Kings 123 \u2014 Perhaps in a year or two from now, Sacramento will look at this game as a key turning point in its growth. Although the Kings fell, they gave Golden State all it could handle and likely would have prevailed were it not for an outstanding all-around effort by the Warriors\u2019 Kevin Durant (28 points, nine rebounds, seven blocks). Lakers 111, Rockets 106 \u2014 LeBron James came to L.A. to get the Lakers into the playoffs and, ultimately, back to The Finals at some point. The Lakers are a long way from the latter goal, but the former looked a little more possible after James keyed a second-half surge to rally L.A. from a 19-point deficit in the win. Raptors 120, Spurs 117 \u2014 In what was effectively (and unofficially) \u201cDeMar DeRozan Night\u201d at Air Canada Centre, its namesake was upstaged by the Raptors\u2019 new star. Kawhi Leonard stole the ball from DeRozan to score the go-ahead dunk with 15 seconds left in a thrilling game before a sellout crowd. Thunder 148, Jazz 147 (2 OT) \u2014 If you didn\u2019t stay up to watch this one on Friday night, consider that a loss on your part. A thrilling, back-and-forth game in the fourth quarter and both overtimes was decided when Paul George lofted a must-see floater over the outstretched arm of Utah\u2019s Rudy Gobert to clinch the win. Blazers 130, Sixers 115 \u2014 Portland has gotten off to an impressive start since the All-Star break, racking up a pair of blowout wins against Eastern Conference playoff teams. Their win against Brooklyn on Thursday was impressive, but this victory on Saturday served notice, perhaps, that the Blazers aren\u2019t a team to be taken lightly as the season winds down. Kings 119, Thunder 116 \u2014 Sacramento showed it is not about to let one loss to a Finals contender derail its hopes for the season. After Thursday\u2019s narrow defeat in Oakland, the Kings picked themselves up and squeezed out a win Saturday night in Oklahoma City behind a monstrous performance from Buddy Hield. Giannis Antetokounmpo (30 points, 11-19 FG, 13 reb, 6 ast, 2 blk in 36 minutes) \u2014 He was a monster in the fourth quarter, notching 12 of his points in that frame to help power the victory on Thursday night. In addition, the Bucks won the season series 2-1, their first over the Celtics since 2014-15. Milwaukee has designs on a big playoff run in a few months and if Antetokoumpo can channel this regularly, who knows how far they can go. | Watch | Video box score LeBron James (29 points, 11-23 FG, 12 reb, 6 ast in 40 minutes) \u2014 James scored 16 of his 29 points in the second half as the Lakers racked up their biggest comeback win of the season. It was James who gave L.A. a 99-97 lead with 4:15 left in the game as he set to tone to help the Lakers craft a much-needed victory in the Western Conference playoff chase. | Watch | Video box score Kevin Durant (28 points, 10-20 FG, 9 reb, 4 ast, 7 blk in 36 minutes) \u2014 A 28-point night from Durant is hardly the kind of performance that garners a spot in this space. But a closer look at his stats \u2014 in particular those seven blocks \u2014 shows just how valuable of a contributor he is. Without that defensive showing on Thursday night, there\u2019s little reason to think the Warriors would have beaten the Kings. | Watch | Video box score Paul George (45 points, 17-31 FG, 9 reb, 7 ast in 50 minutes) \u2014 When the candidacies for Kia MVP are laid before the public in the days and weeks to come, George\u2019s backers can point to this gem of a game on Friday as one of the top reasons he deserves the award. Racking up that kind of stat line is immense in and of itself. Crafting it against a top-flight defensive team like the Jazz and sinking the game-winner with 0.8 seconds left only adds to the weight of it all. | Watch | Video box score Chris Paul (23 points, 7-18 FG, 5 reb, 17 ast, 2 stl in 36 minutes) \u2014 No James Harden. A two-game losing streak. And a date with the two-time defending champs. All those facts seemed to spell doom for the Rockets on Saturday night. Yet Paul wouldn\u2019t allow that to take shape, guiding the Houston offense all night while also sinking a pair of key free throws with 1:08 left to seal the victory. | Watch | Video box score Zach LaVine (42 points, 17-29 FG, 5-11 3pt FG, 6 reb, 4 ast in 38 minutes) & Lauri Markkanen (35 points, 12-20 FG, 15 reb, 2 ast in 37 minutes) \u2014 Forgive Bulls fans if visions of the future were dancing in their heads on Saturday night. Seeing their two young stars go for career-best nights against the Eastern Conference-contending Boston Celtics will do that for a fan base. Watch | Video box score \u201dYou can come in here and win on a Monday night in February or a Tuesday night in November or December. But in the playoffs is when you have to beat a team four out of seven times. It\u2019s great tonight that we won this but in two days y\u2019all will forget this. We all will.\u201d \u2014 Rockets guard Chris Paul , after Saturday\u2019s win vs. Golden State \u201cPaul found the fountain of youth or something. He\u2019s playing like a young Paul Millsap. He\u2019s flying around. We chart everything, Paul Millsap by himself, he contested 18 shots tonight. Eighteen shots, 21 points, 16 rebounds and just impacting the game. His energy is infectious for all the other guys.\u201d \u2014 Nuggets coach Michael Malone , on Paul Millsap \u201cIt\u2019s major. We\u2019ve been having our fans come out and support every night and haven\u2019t won here since Dec. 1. I wasn\u2019t part of that one, so I\u2019m glad that we could get it tonight and just give the fans something to see.\u201d \u2014 Knicks guard Dennis Smith Jr. , after New York snapped its 18-game home losing streak \u201cYou have to change something where we\u2019re at the point we\u2019re at.

But with an overall 18-game skid having been snapped on Thursday, the Knicks decided to address their home malaise next, earning a surprisingly comfortable 130-118 victory over the Spurs in which they led by as many as 23 and trailed for only a handful of possessions in the first quarter. It was such a momentous occasion that Samuel L. Jackson gave Knicks superfan Spike Lee a head\u2019s up at the Oscars. Brie Larson could scarcely believe it! The Knicks looked every bit like one of the league\u2019s worst teams in the opening moments as they gifted Spurs forward LaMarcus Aldridge with one of the easiest baskets he\u2019s ever \u201cscored.\u201d But if the Spurs expected the Knicks to keep presenting them with gifts, they were sorely mistaken. With New York already up eight late in the first half, recently-acquired Dennis Smith Jr. served notice that his team had come to play by coming mere inches from banishing Spurs forward Dennis Bertans to another dimension with what would have been a strong candidate for Dunk of the Year. It was a challenge the Spurs were unable to answer as New York led by at least eight throughout the second half. Damyean Dotson led the way with 27 points and eight 3-pointers, and Smith, Kevin Knox and Mitchell Robinson all posted double-doubles. Smith\u2019s included 13 assists, including this beauty to Robinson that punctuated the Knicks\u2019 first home win since Dec. 1: \u201cOur guys needed to feel that at home,\u201d Knicks coach David Fizdale said. \u201cThe fans were amazing, and we got a lot of contributions. We still made a couple of mistakes \u2026 but I\u2019m really proud of how hard they competed.\u201d In addition to the Spurs losing for the sixth time in seven outings, the LA Clippers suffered a 123-96 beating by the Denver Nuggets as the race for the final playoffs spots in the Western Conference got even tighter. How tight, you ask? Just three games separate the fifth-place Houston Rockets and the Sacramento Kings in ninth, with the Utah Jazz, Spurs and Clippers sandwiched between them. The Nuggets, meanwhile, continued to keep the heat on the Golden State Warriors, whose lead atop the West was sliced to a single game with two more meetings remaining on March 8 and April 2.  Over in the East, the first-place Milwaukee Bucks got a huge assist from the Orlando Magic, who took advantage of Kawhi Leonard\u2019s rest day to rout the Toronto Raptors 113-98 . While the Bucks lead the Raptors by only two games, their position is much stronger than it looks. In addition to having an additional game advantage in the loss column, they also hold the head-to-head tie-breaker. As if all that wasn\u2019t enough, they\u2019ve also got the league\u2019s fourth-easiest schedule over their remaining 23 games. There are worse ways to celebrate wins. Backtracking to Saturday\u2019s 12-game slate, check out this tidbit: Little wonder the NBA is in the midst of its highest-scoring season, with a collective scoring average of 110.9 points per team per game, since 1970-71."},{"id":35361,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/ralph-lawler-la-clippers-broadcast-legacy","date":"2019-02-24","title":"Oh me, oh my! As retirement nears, Ralph Lawler reflects on life calling Clippers games","content":" LOS ANGELES \u2014 Lord knows this franchise has racked up enough \u201cLs\u201d in the past and sadly, the LA Clippers are bracing for a few more at season\u2019s end. Loyalty, longevity, loquaciousness, they\u2019re about to lose all that. All because the man who graced the team with those qualities has tweaked his own definition of Lawler\u2019s Law: the first Clippers broadcaster to reach 40 years on the job must retire. This is it for Ralph Lawler, the enduring voice of the franchise, the perky purveyor of Clippers basketball. He\u2019s the talking head who married \u201coh me!\u201d with \u201coh my!\u201d to create a catch-phrase that squealed how the Clippers did something special on the court at that very moment. \u201cI\u2019d rather quit a year too early than a year too late,\u201d explained Lawler, 80, whose standards always ran high while doing radio and then TV play-by-play for the Clippers. It is appropriate and respectful to lavish a parting gift on those who walk into the sunset. For Lawler, who has watched over 2,000 Clippers losses, there\u2019s an urge to give him Visine. Or better, a place in the media wing of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, which happened last weekend. Because nobody in basketball history did more with less. How about this trick? Try keeping listeners locked into games that end badly, as it was for vast stretches of Lawler\u2019s time with the Clippers. Lawler always had the respect of his broadcasting peers but none of their good fortune while calling Clippers games. The team has never reached a conference finals and the contrast has been especially stark here in LA, which was roamed by broadcasting legends like Chick Hearn and Vin Scully. It\u2019s the broadcaster\u2019s job to bring events and people to life while blowing excitement through the mic and into everyone\u2019s ears. Hearn narrated \u201cShowtime\u201d and the Kobe Bryant-Shaquille O\u2019Neal teams . Scully described Kirk Gibson\u2019s World Series homer in 1988 . Lawler explained Benoit Benjamin . Who had the tougher job? He weathered a franchise relocation, the working conditions in the dumpy LA Sports Arena, a string of crummy injuries to Danny Manning \u2026 and Ron Harper \u2026 and Shaun Livingston. There was the failed promise of Michael Olowokandi and, of course, the weird rise and shameful fall of owner Donald T. Sterling . Yet, as the Clippers\u2019 seasons ran aimlessly into each other, Lawler survived and thrived. As team broadcasters tend to become part of the family to their audiences as they age, Lawler transformed from your older brother to uncle to father to grandfather to great grandfather. And undertaker, to those in the audience he outlived. In fact, he\u2019s only missed three games in his 40 years on the job.  His punch-lines and signature calls endeared him to fans, and up until the franchise began winning more regularly a decade ago, were pretty much the best thing going for the Clippers. \u201cLawler\u2019s Law\u201d meant the first team to 100 points wins the game. The \u201coh me, oh my\u201d reaction was pure excitement. Lawler would warn fans to \u201cfasten your seatbelts\u201d to prepare for a tight finish and shouted \u201cbingo!\u201d each time a former Clipper named Bobby \u201cBingo\u201d Smith scored a hoop. When Bingo left, \u201cbingo!\u201d stayed. And, Lawler is the only NBA broadcaster who speaks into a hand-held microphone \u2014 because he finds it easier. From 1978-79, his first season, through 2010-11, the Clippers only had three winning seasons, but don\u2019t reach for a hanky on Lawler\u2019s behalf. He\u2019s had the best seat in the house and let the record show he never lost a game. \u201cI realized early on, back in the early \u201880s that I have no control over winning and losing, so why should I get too invested in winning and losing?\u201d he said. \u201cI invest 100 percent of my energy into the broadcast. We\u2019d lose a ballgame and I\u2019m going, `Man, we had a good show.\u2019 \u201cLook, I wish they\u2019d won 10 championships. I wish they were the Boston Celtics. But I love the craft. I love to broadcast, the challenge of bringing a bad game to life and making it entertaining and informative. I have loved every single second. There was a year we won 12 and lost 70 and I loved every one of those 82 games.\u201d Besides, Lawler\u2019s been with champions. He began his career in Philadelphia with the NHL\u2019s Flyers and his timing was better than Rolex, because the city celebrated two Stanley Cups . He didn\u2019t know a red line from a blue line, and it didn\u2019t matter, because he could articulate a brawl and the \u201cBroad Street Bullies\u201d had plenty of those. \u201cThe gloves are off and there they go!\u201d Lawler would scream; the audience ate it up. He left for San Diego for the great weather and an NBA team that moved from Buffalo and renamed the Clippers, and a legacy began. It was actually interrupted twice, when management tried to replace him for no reason other than to go with someone different. The first time was in 1982 when he was doing Clippers radio and the station changed owners. As the season began, Lawler worked in real estate and, one day, he and his future wife Jo went for a walk on the beach near a house he had listed. \u201cHere comes Donald Sterling walking toward us,\u201d Lawler recalled. \u201cI turned to Jo and was like, \u2018My God, do we want to have this exchange?\u2019 So we walked up and made small talk. I said, \u2018Hey, we got a house with a jacuzzi, might as well jump in and have some wine.\u2019 He said yeah. \u201cAt one point he said, \u2018Why don\u2019t you work for me anymore?\u2019 I said \u2018because you didn\u2019t hire me.\u2019 He said, \u2018we gotta change that.\u2019 Next day I got a call from the general manager saying we need you back. Were it not for that walk on the beach I\u2019m quite sure I would not be here today.\u201d When the Clippers moved to L.A. in 1984, then-GM Carl Scheer wanted a flashier presence on the mic and broke the bad news to Lawler. So back to real estate he went, and a guy named Eddie Ducette took over, and two weeks into the season, Lawler\u2019s phone rang. It was Scheer, sounding desperate. \u201cWe made a big mistake,\u201d he said. Officially, then, Lawler has missed only three games. One because of LA traffic \u2014 Lawler at the time was still commuting from his home in La Quinta, between LA and San Diego. The mother of all jams happened and it took him six hours to go six miles. Stuck on the 405, he turned around at halftime. The second time, he needed surgery to remove kidney stones. He scheduled the procedure in the morning so he\u2019d make the game that night \u2026 but a tube stuck down his throat stole his voice temporarily. The third time, he and broadcast partner Michael Smith were suspended for one game in 2009 for comments made about the homeland of Memphis Grizzlies center Hamed Haddadi. That one burns Lawler to this day. \u201cI pronounced Iran wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was 100 percent unwarranted. I did absolutely nothing wrong. One person wrote an email saying he was offended, and this was the same guy who came down and asked for an autograph and photo when the suspension was over.\u201d It was the first time anyone in the organization can recall the normally mild-mannered Lawler turn angry, but not the last. He was deeply hurt by the behavior of Sterling and the release of tapes where the former owner was overheard making racially-insensitive remarks about black players on his team as well as about NBA legend Magic Johnson. All of that, and more , led to Sterling being banned for life by the NBA and, eventually, his trust selling the team in 2014 for $2 billion. The team gave Lawler a prepared message to read over the air before the next game, and while his stomach still churned, he never mangled a single syllable of that statement. \u201cI felt sick,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat he did embarrassed me. It hurt that I had represented this man for the previous 30 years. That\u2019s a weekend that will live in infamy for me and the franchise.\u201d Not that Lawler didn\u2019t see this coming. There was a time when he and Sterling were on solid terms, especially during the early years in San Diego, when \u201cI was Ralph to him and he was Donald to me.\u201d But soon: \u201cIt was Mr. Sterling to me, or DTS. He liked to be called by his initials, all of a sudden.\u201d Not long ago, Sterling attended a coach\u2019s meeting in training camp and Dave Wohl, an assistant coach at the time, turned to the owner and said: \u201cDon, this is what we have to do \u2026 \u201c Sterling quickly corrected him: \u201c Mr. Sterling , please.\u201d Lawler does say this much: \u201cIf that hadn\u2019t happened and Sterling wasn\u2019t removed, Steve wouldn\u2019t be the owner today and that would be unfortunate.\u201d That\u2019s Steve as in Ballmer, the software billionaire who took control of the club three years ago and essentially opened the windows in the building and let the stench out. Lawler said: \u201cHe\u2019s exciting and encouraging. He\u2019s \u2018Call me Steve.\u2019 Last year we\u2019re walking into the tunnel and going through security screening, and a security woman, who\u2019s been there for years, she walks up and says, \u2018Hey Steve, how ya doing?\u2019 That\u2019s who he is. \u201cHe had a big meeting with the entire staff and handed out his email address to everybody. If you have any problems, he said to let him know, he\u2019ll get to it. Look, he\u2019s demanding and a tough taskmaster. He\u2019s not going to be patient for long periods of time but he is everything the coach and GM want in an owner.\u201d Lawler gets emotional about two others, one a former member of the organization, one current. Bill Walton suffered through a series of foot surgeries which prevented him from becoming the franchise savior when the team began in San Diego. He partnered with Lawler on team broadcasts in the 1990s and their friendship deepened. They vacationed for 18 days in the Grand Canyon, rafting the Colorado River. Their conversations always ran thick, and with Walton, how could it not? \u201cWorking with Walton on TV changed me, made me better,\u201d said Lawler. \u201cThat was a graduate course in having fun. It really helped me turn the corner in terms of how I approach the job.\u201d Also, Lawler was diagnosed with prostate cancer 10 years ago and within moments of returning home, there was a knock at the door. \u201cBill and his wife,\u201d said Lawler. \u201cAnd then he came back the following week and took us out to dinner. The nicest, most generous human I\u2019ve ever met outside of my dad.\u201d  The other difference-maker for Lawler is coach Doc Rivers. Lawler was ready to quit the business 10 years ago, but then Rivers arrived and the culture changed. The \u201cLob City\u201d era reinvigorated Lawler and the Clippers\u2019 fan base. The club suddenly made a habit of making the playoffs. And seat belts were being fastened on the couches of Clippers fans watching at home. Suddenly, winning mattered to Lawler, after all. \u201cThis was the kind of stuff you dreamed of having, after all those dark years,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have made it tough to leave. So this is a very emotional closing act for me. It will be almost impossible for me to replace this.\u201d And so on his final game this season, right after the buzzer, the only NBA broadcaster who holds a hot mic will let it drop after 40 years, and when it hits the floor, it can only make one sound: bingo! * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

"},{"id":35348,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/about-last-night-2-23-2019","date":"2019-02-24","title":"About Last Night: Paul runs the show","content":" Houston Rockets point guard Chris Paul has been around the NBA long enough, 14 seasons and counting, to know that regular-season games don\u2019t mean much of anything in the grand scheme. As such, he wasn\u2019t about to get overly excited with Saturday\u2019s 118-112 road victory over the two-defending champion Golden State Warriors, in which the Rockets overcame the absence of reigning Kia MVP James Harden and recovered to finish strong after blowing a 20-point lead. \u201cGood win,\u201d Paul said. \u201cWe got a game in Atlanta on Monday.\u201d And so the marathon continues, with that contest and 22 more to follow before the playoffs begin on April 13. But if nothing else, the Rockets\u2019 third win in as many meetings with the Warriors this season proved how good Paul can still be, even with his lead dog days behind him and his 34th birthday fast approaching. Paul worked the Warriors over for 23 points and 17 assists, joining some rare company in the process. It\u2019s hard to imagine a lineup with Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, DeMarcus Cousins, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green could struggle as mightily as it did, getting outscored at a rate of 14.8 points per 100 possessions in their 12 minutes together against the Rockets. Much of that had to do with Paul, who exploited Cousins\u2019 lack of mobility by dragging the center into one pick and roll after another. It\u2019s not exactly a novel strategy. But it might be one of the few ways to seriously threaten the Warriors, as the Rockets did last season when they led 3-2 in the Western Conference finals before an injured Paul was forced to watch the final two games, both losses, from the bench. And with another, even better initiator in Harden, there can be little doubt that the Rockets, no matter how little Friday\u2019s game means in the long run, are dying to get healthy and earn another postseason shot at the champs. We\u2019re not sure how, but Kerr managed to not immediately notice one of his best players rolling on the floor in intense pain directly in front of him. Although he didn\u2019t sound especially convincing , Green said he doesn\u2019t expect to miss any game time with the sprained ankle. Durant said it won\u2019t matter even if he does: \u201cI mean, he\u2019ll be back for the playoffs. That\u2019s the only thing we worry about here, right?\u201d First, it was Jarrett Allen . Now we have Minnesota Timberwolves forward Anthony Tolliver, who became the latest NBA player to put his life at risk by challenging Milwaukee Bucks superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo at the rim. Alas, Tolliver\u2019s incredible defensive play made little difference as Antetokounmpo dominated per usual, racking up 27 points, 10 rebounds and seven assists in a 140-128 victory for the Bucks. The Indiana Pacers suffered what seemed to be an insurmountable blow on Jan. 23, when Victor Oladipo was lost for the season with a ruptured quad tendon. But after losing four straight in the immediate aftermath, the Pacers have since recovered to win eight of their past nine outings, including Friday\u2019s 119-112 triumph over the Washington Wizards. In addition to posting the league\u2019s second-best defensive rating over that span, nine Pacers are averaging 7.9 points per game. Floor burns aren\u2019t tracked, but they\u2019re probably among the league leaders there as well thanks to hustle plays like these from Kyle O\u2019Quinn \u2026 \u2026 and Wes Matthews. The Boston Celtics suffered their latest inexplicable loss, trailing by as much as 25 and losing 126-116 to a Bulls team that entered Friday\u2019s action sitting 22 games beneath them in the standings. Not that Kyrie Irving\u2019s worried or anything. And speaking of the Bulls, how\u2019s this for noteworthy? It\u2019s been a breakout season for Brooklyn Nets guard D\u2019Angelo Russell, who made his first All-Star appearance last weekend and carries a career-high 20.2-point scoring average. What better way to celebrate those achievements \u2014 on his 23rd birthday, no less \u2014 than playing one of the best games of his life? In addition to tying his career high with 40 points, Russell earned himself an extra slice of cake by scoring the Nets\u2019 final 12, including a massive go-ahead 3 in the final minute, to almost single-handedly lift them past the Charlotte Hornets. Atlanta Hawks rookie Trae Young has quickly proven himself to have absolutely no conscience with the rock, ready and willing to launch shots from anywhere. That aggressiveness, however, doesn\u2019t always go over well with his teammates. Such was the case early in the second half against the Phoenix Suns, when Hawks forward John Collins, in verbiage unsuitable for a family web site, questioned Young\u2019s shot selection after his errant pull-up 3 led to a Suns fast break. Fortunately for the Hawks, Young didn\u2019t listen. He scored 16 points over the remaining 21 minutes, including an even deeper, game-tying 3 \u2014 naturally, off an assist from Collins \u2014 to help fuel the game-winning push . In case you forgot, Philadelphia 76ers center Boban Marjanovic is huuuuuuuuge. https:\/\/twitter.com\/sixers\/status\/1099366967499198496\/photo\/1?ref_src"},{"id":35337,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/ap-towns-misses-milwaukee-game-concussion","date":"2019-02-24","title":"Towns remains in concussion protocol, misses Milwaukee game","content":" MILWAUKEE \u2014 Karl-Anthony Towns remains in concussion protocol and didn\u2019t play for Minnesota against Milwaukee, a night after missing a game for the first time in his career. The Timberwolves lost to the Bucks , 140-128. The All-Star forward was in a car accident Thursday and didn\u2019t play Friday in New York, ending his streak of 303 consecutive games started. He traveled with the Timberwolves for the game in Milwaukee on Saturday, rather than return to Minnesota, but hadn\u2019t been cleared to play again. Towns must pass a battery of tests and be symptom-free before returning to the court. Being unable to play has troubled Towns, coach Ryan Saunders said. \u201cPeople asked me if he cared about his (consecutive games) streak,\u201d Saunders said. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t and didn\u2019t mention one thing along those lines. It was all about being there for his teammates and contributing. He even had somebody run out and make sure he could get a sport coat so he was dressed properly on the bench so he could be there with his teammates. That says a lot about Karl.\u201d Towns had played in his second consecutive All-Star game last weekend before he was involved in a car accident on his way to the airport in Minnesota. He was cleared to fly and arrived in New York and was originally ruled questionable, but after further examination he was placed in the concussion protocol. Towns had started every game since being the No. 1 pick in the 2015 draft, the longest streak to begin a career since 1970-71. Other players will have to continue to step up in Towns\u2019 absence, Saunders said. \u2033(Friday) night, we found some things that worked for us in stretches,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce again, it\u2019s all hands on deck. When you have to make up for a player like Karl, you need everybody to contribute a little more.\u201d Among the players Saunders will turn to is Taj Gibson, who had a season-high 19 points and grabbed 10 rebounds in the win over the Knicks, and then 20 points and six rebounds against the Bucks. \u201cTaj is a pro\u2019s pro,\u201d Saunders said. \u201cJust being ready. Just filling in and doing all the dirty work and really keeping the team together, too.

Coach Mike D\u2019Antoni said the reigning MVP and league scoring leader probably could have played through that. Harden hurt the neck when he got hit during a practice leading up to Thursday night\u2019s road loss to the Lakers and woke up sore the next day. \u201cHe might\u2019ve played even with a sore neck, he had a little touch of the flu.

The King has again asserted a comfortable position atop his throne. As for everyone else, a certain shooting guard in Hollywood has caught fire and doesn\u2019t appear to be cooling anytime soon. We\u2019re also keeping a close watch on a pair of gritty point guards who seem to be rounding into form for the stretch run. Is there enough time for either to ascend into the top three? Meanwhile, a 2019 \u201cAll-Star\u201d guard in his final season is picking up his play and may be able to crack the list soon, which would make for a nice little OSPR sendoff. 1. LeBron James (34), Los Angeles Lakers Previous rank: 1 Latest stats: 3 games, 25.0 ppg, 10.7 rpg, 10.3 apg Season stats: 26.8 ppg, 8.7 rpg, 7.6 apg Despite shooting just 45.8 from the field (and an even uglier 4-for-22 from deep) over the last three games, James holds onto the top spot thanks to his production across the board. In two of three games, he scored 28 or more, snatched 11 or more boards and dished out six or more assists. In addition, the 16 assists Tuesday were James\u2019 most since handing out 17 on March 21, 2018. 2. Lou Williams (32), LA Clippers Previous rank: 3 Latest stats: 3 games, 30.0 ppg, 1.7 rpg, 6.7 apg Season stats: 19.9 ppg, 2.9 rpg, 5.3 apg Just nine days after setting a season high with 39 points, Williams struck again, pouring in a new season-high 45. In fact, he has eclipsed the 30-point barrier five times in the last 11 games. Over that span, he\u2019s been doing more than just scoring, dishing out six or more assists eight times. He\u2019s also managed six double-doubles this season after seven all of last season and just three in 12 previous seasons. 3. LaMarcus Aldridge (33), San Antonio Spurs Previous rank: 2 Latest stats:  2 games, 18.5 ppg, 10.5 rpg, 3.0 apg Season stats: 21.0 ppg, 9.0 rpg, 2.6 apg The shooting was off (41.9 from the field), but Aldridge managed to pocket back-to-back double-doubles. He\u2019s now gone for 10 or more rebounds in seven of the last nine games. And his 9.0 rpg this season mark Aldridge\u2019s best since 2014-15, when he averaged 10.2. In addition to the nice board work, Aldridge has gone for 20 or more points in seven of the last nine. 4. J.J. Redick (34), Philadelphia 76ers Previous rank: 6 Latest stats: 5 games, 19.8 ppg, 3.4 rpg, 3.0 apg Season stats: 18.5 ppg, 2.3 rpg, 2.8 apg Make it now 55 straight games of double-figure scoring for Redick, who continues to be one of the most consistent OSPR players. The last five games were no exception: 50.8 percent overall shooting, 48.6 percent from beyond the arc and scoring 13-21 points in 4-of-5 games. So why did he move up two spots? Enter last Friday\u2019s 34-point performance, in which he shot 11-for-15 and 6-for-7 from deep. 5. Kyle Lowry (32), Toronto Raptors Previous rank: 7 Latest stats: 3 games, 16.3 ppg, 4.7 rpg, 8.3 apg Season stats: 14.3 ppg, 4.5 rpg, 9.2 apg It looks like Lowry is slowly getting back his shooting touch, going for 48.4 percent overall and 50.0 percent from deep in the last three. In addition to scoring in double figures in seven straight, Lowry has connected on at least three 3-pointers in five straight. Even more impressive is that he\u2019s managed 13 or more assists in two of the last four after going for double-figure assists just once in the previous nine. 6. Rudy Gay (32), San Antonio Spurs Previous rank: 5 Latest stats: 1 game, 15.0 ppg, 12.0 rpg, 8.0 apg Season stats: 14.5 ppg, 6.5 rpg, 2.6 apg Just one game on the docket, but it was a productive one, filling up most of the categories (15 points, 12 rebounds, eight assists, two 3-pointers and one block) in a win over the Grizzlies. Gay has now scored in double figures in 13 straight with three of those being 20 or more. Over that span, he\u2019s also managed to shoot better than 50 percent eight times. 7. Chris Paul (33), Houston Rockets Previous rank: 9 Latest stats: 4 games, 18.5 ppg, 6.8 rpg, 9.3 apg Season stats: 15.8 ppg, 4.3 rpg, 8.0 apg Paul appears to be back to 100 percent \u2014 or very close \u2014 after turning in four straight games of solid production. In fact, he\u2019s now gone for double-figure scoring in nine straight while eclipsing nine assists in four of the last five. During that span, Paul has also notched three double-doubles after going seven games without one (he missed 18 games with a back injury in between). 8. Al Horford (32), Boston Celtics Previous rank: 10 Latest stats: 4 games, 16.8 ppg, 11.5 rpg, 5.8 apg Season stats: 12.9 ppg, 7.0 rpg, 4.0 apg He may have started the stint slowly with a six-point showing, but Horford turned it up considerably in three subsequent games, going for 17 or more points in all three while turning in his two best rebounding efforts of 2018-19 (14 against Detroit and 17 against Milwaukee). Not enough? He\u2019s hit at least two 3-pointers in three straight and has at least one steal in five straight. 9. Trevor Ariza (33), Washington Wizards Previous rank: Just missed Latest stats: 4 games, 18.8 ppg, 5.5 rpg, 4.0 apg Season stats: 12.7 ppg, 5.6 rpg, 3.8 apg Ariza checks off just about every box over the last four games. Shooting from the field was solid: 54.9 percent. Shooting from beyond the arc was passable: 35.5 percent. Nineteen or more points in three consecutive games was impressive. Seven or more rebounds and five or more assists in two straight was great. In seven February games, Ariza is averaging 16.7 points while shooting 48.9%. 10. Marc Gasol (34), Toronto Raptors Previous rank: 4 Latest stats: 3 games, 10.0 ppg, 6.3 rpg, 1.7 apg Season stats: 15.4 ppg, 8.5 rpg, 4.7 apg This is what happens when you go from 33.7 minutes to just 20. Production takes a hit. That\u2019s especially true for Gasol, -who \u2014 despite shooting 52.2 over the last three \u2014 has scored more than seven points just once. Also, his high rebounding game so far has been seven. Give him another week and his numbers with the Raptors (10 ppg, 6.3 rpg) will be closer to his Memphis numbers (15.7 and 8.6).

On Thursday, he blatantly and unapologetically moved his chair closer to that table\u2019s head. The Thunder star also earned some sweet revenge in OKC\u2019s epic 148-147 double-OT win over Utah, which was surely hoping to see the George that underwhelmed in OKC\u2019s 4-2 first-round loss to the Jazz last year. That man is gone, replaced by the true alpha star many thought George could be but not necessarily would be. This year\u2019s edition has no issues guarding Donovan Mitchell (14-for-35 FG), nor qualms about turning a make into a message, overtime fatigue be damned. Most important of all, George took \u2014 and made \u2014 the big shot after years of missing them in Indiana. And what shot is bigger or more unmakeable than a game-winning floater over reigning Kia Defensive Player of the Year Rudy Gobert? That\u2019s a moment , one that polished off a 50-minute, 45-point, zero-turnover night for the MVP candidate that can no longer be ignored or explained away. George has effectively become what Thunder fans feared they had lost forever when Kevin Durant left in 2016: a do-it-all forward that can co-exist with Russell Westbrook and dominate on both ends. The two combined for 88 points , just the fifth time in the last 22 years two teammates have each scored 40-plus. And though both were All-Stars last year, this year\u2019s edition feels like more of a threat come May. Especially if George keeps playing like an MVP. Shorter contracts and the grass-is-greener era make franchise icons a rare occurrence. By year seven or eight, an All-Star talent is ready to move on. Not DeMar DeRozan. The nine-year Raptor had no intention of leaving the only team he\u2019d ever known. Only the availability of Kawhi Leonard, a two-time Kia Defensive Player of the Year, kept that feeling from being mutual. On Thursday night, DeRozan the Spur returned to Scotiabank Arena for the first time since he was shockingly dealt last summer. His former team drowned him with the kind of tribute and ovation fitting for the best Raptor in franchise history. And though he didn\u2019t get the win , DeRozan reminded everyone how he earned him four All-Star selections and a pair of All-NBA honors. The veteran swingman scored 23 points on just 12 shots (all of them inside the arc). Raptors fans gladly clapped for their \u201copponent\u201d when he pulled off his signature 360-degree assault on the rim: DeRozan more than deserved Toronto\u2019s warm welcome. He\u2019s their longest-tenured player, all-time scoring leader, and had moments in a Raptors uniform. Guys like that are the blocks on which a franchise\u2019s history is built. A change of scenery hasn\u2019t seen Thon Maker exactly erupt in Detroit, but the former 10th overall pick did enjoy his first signature moment with his new team. The seven-foot big man found himself catching a pass near the right corner with less than 20 seconds remaining in regulation. Maker pump-faked, launched and made the game-winning 3-pointer to give the Pistons a 125-122 win at Atlanta. The Pistons\u2019 victory was at least partly inspired by their hosts. That\u2019s according to several Detroit players, who said after the game that music artist and Atlanta celebrity Quavo unintentionally motivated the visitors. \u201cI told (Quavo) he fueled that,\u201d Andre Drummond told reporters. \u201cHe was talking too much.\u201d \u201cQuavo started talking and saying I couldn\u2019t hold Trae [Young],\u201d Pistons rookie Bruce Brown added. \u201cI just did what I needed to do. It was fun.\u201d Detroit guard Reggie Jackson (32 points) took the sentiment one step further, immediately running the game ball to Quavo as time expired. How many guys get a defender to turn a complete circle in confusion before realizing he\u2019s been duped? Trae Young is one of them. The Hornets aren\u2019t viewed as contenders, but the East\u2019s elite should be wary of taking them lightly when a first-round series shifts to Charlotte. The league\u2019s recent All-Star hosts hold a 20-9 record at home, a surprisingly solid mark given their overall sub-.500 record. Coach James Borrego made a change in hopes of stimulating more universal success, inserting rookie Mikal Bridges into the starting lineup for Jeremy Lamb. The move worked in Charlotte\u2019s comeback win over Washington. The Hornets\u2019 new starting five boasted a whopping 19.5 net rating while on the floor and assisted on 11 of its 16 makes. The sample size is small, but any consistency the Hornets can slide alongside All-Star starter Kemba Walker would be welcome."},{"id":35383,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/reports-jaren-jackson-out-indefinitely","date":"2019-02-23","title":"Jaren Jackson Jr. 'will be out indefinitely' with deep thigh bruise","content":" The Memphis Grizzlies confirmed Friday that rookie Jaren Jackson Jr. will be out indefinitely with a deep thigh bruise.

DeRozan is back north of the border for the first time since the Toronto Raptors traded him last summer. His new team, the San Antonio Spurs, face the Raptors on Friday. A four-time All-Star in Toronto who helped the Raptors to five straight playoff appearances, DeRozan is likely to receive a warm welcome when he is introduced. \u201cIf it\u2019s one of those long standing ovations, it\u2019s definitely going to be overwhelming,\u201d DeRozan said in a news conference at the Spurs\u2019 team hotel. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy when you get a whole arena on their feet just showing appreciation. I\u2019m looking forward to it, to feeling the love.\u201d Friday\u2019s game will be the first following the All-Star break for both teams. Toronto (43-16) has won six straight, and is is one game behind Milwaukee for top spot in the Eastern Conference. San Antonio (33-26) beat Memphis in its final game before the break to stop a four-game slide. The Spurs are seventh in the West, nine games behind leaders Golden State. There wasn\u2019t much love on offer when the Raptors visited the Spurs in January. Toronto forward Kawhi Leonard endured chants of \u201cTraitor! Traitor!\u201d and \u201cQuitter! Quitter!\u201d from the capacity crowd that adored him during his seven seasons in San Antonio. \u201cIt just felt like a road game, but more boos when I have the ball,\u201d Leonard said after the Raptors practiced Thursday. \u201cEnvironments like that can only get us better, being able to have the fans up in their seats excited, wanting the team to lose, it just prepares us for the playoffs.\u201d Leaving Toronto last summer was difficult for DeRozan. Still a teenager when he was drafted by Toronto in 2009, he turned into an All-Star by 2014, building his game year after year. He left town as the franchise leader in points (13,296), field goals (4,716), free throws (3,539), and games (675). DeRozan compared the emotional wounds left by the end of his Raptors career to a breakup, albeit one with a happy ending. \u201cShe moved on and I moved on,\u201d he joked. \u201cNow we\u2019re both happy.\u201d Toronto coach Nick Nurse worked with DeRozan for five years in his role as a Raptors assistant, and called him \u201cthe best dude ever.\u201d"},{"id":35405,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/kia-mvp-ladder-week-19-2018-19","date":"2019-02-22","title":"Kia MVP Ladder: Fellow stars delight in Antetokounmpo's superstar turn","content":" So far this season, Giannis Antetokounmpo\u2019s actions have spoken much louder than any words. The Milwaukee Bucks sit atop the Eastern Conference standings this morning, due in large part to the play of their 24-year-old wunderkind, who has dominated the league in a fashion that calls to mind the last Milwaukee player to win MVP. Yes, it\u2019s time to go there. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar won the first three of his record six MVP awards in a Bucks uniform, with the last coming in 1973-74 . Antetokounmpo is poised to end the Bucks\u2019 MVP drought, if he can finish this season\u2019s stretch run as he and the Bucks started the season. He\u2019ll have to outplay a loaded field of previous winners \u2014 namely, reigning Kia MVP and Houston Rockets superstar James Harden as well as two-time MVP Stephen Curry of the Golden State Warriors. The Bucks\u2019 charismatic young star seems up to the task, after serving notice at NBA All-Star 2019 that he\u2019s more than ready for the prime-time stage. He turned in a spectacular performance and is clearly just scratching the surface of his immense potential. Not that he needs the added endorsement, but his name was on the mind of his All-Star peers, (even if they are a bit unclear as to how old he is) when the topic turned to the MVP race. \u201cHe\u2019s got potential through the roof. He\u2019s still producing at an elite level, and it\u2019s scary to see how far he can keep going,\u201d said 2014 Kia MVP Kevin Durant, who was named Kia MVP of the All-Star Game. \u201cHis game is rounding into shape. He\u2019s still getting better, but he\u2019s [the] leading top five, top three MVP candidates right now at 20. How old is he, 23? To be that young and already at the top of the class as one of the elites in the game, it\u2019s a joy to watch his progression.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know how old he is, but his ceiling is still very, very high,\u201d said Detroit Pistons All-Star Blake Griffin. He said the MVP conversation is shifting as a crop of under-25 stars makes a move on established candidates. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of guys that are like \u2014 like A.D. [Anthony Davis] \u2014 there\u2019s guys you almost don\u2019t even mention when you talk about the best players in the world that you almost forget about,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cKawhi [Leonard] \u2014 like the list goes on about guys that could the next season have a crazy season, and they seem like they\u2019re the best player in the world. It\u2019s an exciting time.\u201d To Griffin, the conversation has shifted \u2013 even in the five seasons since LeBron James won his most recent (and fourth overall) MVP. \u201cYeah, I think the conversation\u2019s closer,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cI mean, LeBron\u2019s still has held that down for a long, long time, but you see Giannis, you see James [Harden] \u2026 KD, Steph, all these guys are \u2014 it\u2019s a lot of fun because it feels like the competition is like that. Everybody is pushing each other to become better.\u201d Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer is doing his part to push Antetokounmpo to his next level, providing an offensive framework for \u201cThe Greek Freak\u2019s\u201d rise. \u201cProbably the most exciting \u2014 or if you\u2019re not with Milwaukee, the most scary \u2014 thing is to think about how much better Giannis can get,\u201d Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said. \u201cI feel like he\u2019s got a lot of room to grow, a lot of room to improve. \u2026 He\u2019s only 24. We\u2019re certainly excited with where he\u2019s going.\u201d Antetokounmpo\u2019s path the next two months, with that loaded field giving chase, appears to be headed towards a seat at the table of the league\u2019s MVP elite. \u201cRight now, I\u2019m going to go with my guy Giannis,\u201d said fellow Bucks All-Star Khris Middleton. \u201cHe\u2019s having a great year. He\u2019s leading us to first place right now. He\u2019s doing everything for us. When you look at his numbers, you look at our team, you look at how we\u2019re winning and everything, I think he\u2019s the clear candidate right now.\u201d Middleton also senses the seismic generational shift Griffin mentioned. The MVP conversation \u2013 once dominated seemingly forever by LeBron, Durant and Curry \u2014 is at least a bit more complicated given Antetokoumpo\u2019s rise. \u201cI think LeBron is the best player in the world, as far as overall in his career and what he\u2019s doing for this league on and off the court,\u201d Middleton said. \u201cBut I think Giannis is headed in that direction. Giannis is still 23, 24. LeBron is in his 30s now. I think Giannis can be a LeBron-type player, like an all-world, Hall of Famer, MVP, legend, one of the best ever. He\u2019s doing the right things to put himself in that situation. I think he will get there.\u201d Provided, of course, that Antetokounmpo can finish what he\u2019s started this season. * * * The top five this week in the 2018-19 Kia Race to the MVP Ladder: * * * Last week:  No. 1 Season stats:  27.2 points, 12.7 rebounds, 6 assists, 1.4 steals, 1.4 blocks With only 24 games left in the season, the Bucks have a finite amount of time to explore the possibilities with another giant floor-spacer (Nikola Mirotic) playing off Antetokounmpo. The All-Star Game \u2014 the defense-free exhibition that it was \u2013 proved a great reminder of how devastating \u201cThe Greek Freak\u201d can be with better shooters and talent on his side. Make no mistake: Antetokounmpo was a dominant force for most of that game despite not winning MVP honors. Mirotic offers that help in smaller increments while changing things for these Bucks. Budenholzer\u2019s ability to design schemes that play to the supporting cast\u2019s strengths will only serve to boost Antetokounmpo\u2019s stock. And with Harden, Curry, Paul George and the rest of the field breathing down his neck, Antetokounmpo will need every possible edge he can get to crash the MVP party he\u2019s been on the outside of the past two seasons. Last week:  No. 2 Season stats:  36.5 points, 7.7 assists, 6.6 rebounds, 2.2 steals As much as Harden would no doubt love to win a second straight Kia MVP, the Rockets\u2019 star has bigger issues to deal with in the stretch run. \u201cI\u2019m not worried about MVP,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just excited for the second half of the season, getting a full, healthy roster and taking it from there.\u201d Harden is trying to secure a top-four seed in a rugged Western Conference playoff chase. The side benefit for his MVP chances is that to obtain that playoff goal, he\u2019ll most certainly have to continue playing at the level that rescued the Rockets after an 11-14 start. He has more help now, what with both Chris Paul and Clint Capela back in the mix. And what better motivation for a player who has everything (short of an NBA title) than to see if he can keep his 30-point scoring streak rolling, too? Harden doesn\u2019t have to favor one priority over another \u2026 they\u2019re all intertwined until the very end. Last week:  No. 3 Season stats:  28.7 points, 8 rebounds, 4.1 assists, 2.3 steals It\u2019s a credit to George that the MVP chase is a legitimate three-player competition right now and not just an Antetokounmpo-vs.-Harden sprint to the finish. In terms of this season\u2019s best two-way players, George is right there with Antetokounmpo. George\u2019s improvement in that department from last season to this one is nothing short of amazing. He\u2019s shooting an absurd 45.8 percent on 3-pointers over OKC\u2019s last 13 games (in which it has gone 11-2). Toss in the fact that Russell Westbrook is a walking triple-double every night out and it\u2019s easy to cast George in a new light. The challenge for George now is to hold onto this position as a pack of Kia MVP contenders like James, Curry, Durant, Nikola Jokic, Joel Embiid, Kyrie Irving and, to a lesser extent, Westbrook, make a late-season charge. Last week:  No. 4 Season stats:  28.8 points, 5.3 assists, 5.1 rebounds, 1.2 steals Curry was the toast of his hometown during All-Star 2019 in Charlotte , even if his mom, Sonya Curry, made the biggest shot of the weekend . But now comes the real heavy lifting for Curry and the Warriors. They\u2019ll have to work to keep the West\u2019s No. 1 spot as Denver and Oklahoma City give chase, and strength of schedule will be a serious factor for each of those teams. But Curry and the Warriors have the strength of experience component over all comers, in the conference and beyond. A healthy roster, one refreshed from a week off for big men Draymond Green and DeMarcus Cousins, will certainly aid the cause. Curry\u2019s advantage in things is that there will be so much pressure applied to the Warriors\u2019 other stars that he may find his spots a little easier (and certainly as often) as he\u2019d like. This season has made it clear how crucial Curry is to the Warriors operating at their peak. If a third straight title is in the plans, it has to come with Curry playing MVP-level ball on the road to the playoffs and beyond. Last week:  No. 5 Season stats:  27.3 points, 13.5 rebounds, 3.5 assists, 1.9 blocks It\u2019s unclear how the news of Embiid\u2019s week of rest with a sore knee is going to affect the 76ers and their chances of trying to climb in the Eastern Conference standings. The \u201cload management\u201d for \u201cThe Process\u201d is no doubt going to impact Embiid\u2019s status here, where a player\u2019s availability during the stretch run is perhaps the most critical trait for staying in the MVP conversation. That would be a shame, because Embiid was enjoying the finest stretch of his NBA career. Plus, no team needs time for their newly formed core group to develop chemistry than Philly does. The one side benefit of adding Tobias Harris at the trade deadline is that there is a natural pecking order in place for the Sixers while Embiid rests. Harris will get many more reps as a main option with Embiid out, which should pay dividends when the league\u2019s most dominant center in unavailable. Embiid should have plenty of time to stay in\/fight his way back into the top-tier mix here \u2014 provided his load management period only lasts a week. Anything longer and it could end up costing him this perch. * * * 6.  Kevin Durant, Golden State Warriors 7.  LeBron James, Los Angeles Lakers 8.  Nikola Jokic, Denver Nuggets 9.

Targeting 2024 for new digs, Ballmer and the organization believe exiting Staples Center, where they share space with their city rival Los Angeles Lakers, is the prudent move for the future. \u201c[We] need our own house,\u201d Ballmer insists. Yet the Clippers\u2019 proposed arena in Inglewood, where The Forum remains a concert and event venue, has legal obstacles to clear before the project can advance to the next stage. \u201cWe\u2019re going through the permitting process,\u201d Ballmer told NBA.com Thursday in a wide-ranging interview. \u201cAnd an environmental process, and we\u2019re going through that right now. We have some folks pushing back on us, primarily Madison Square Garden and the Knicks, if you will. They own The Forum, which is a concert venue, and they don\u2019t want to see a new concert venue, which any new basketball arena would be. So we\u2019re getting some pushback. \u201cBut 2024 is our target. And we\u2019ve given ourselves some time to get ready. And 2024 comes faster than you think, so we\u2019re pushing along down the path. We\u2019re excited. We\u2019ve seen some preliminary exterior designs \u2026 can\u2019t show them to you yet. But the community will see them not too long from now.\u201d Ballmer\u2019s vision for the new building is for it to be crafted with basketball experience as the primary focus. There have been scant public details about the project, which would be built on 23 acres of mostly vacant land. The site would include not only an 18,000-to 20,000 seat arena, but also a practice facility, team offices, sports medicine clinic, parking facilities and more. \u201cIt\u2019s about the ability to get it right,\u201d said Ballmer, the billionaire and former Microsoft CEO who bought the Clippers in 2014. \u201cWe\u2019re not putting hockey in the building. I don\u2019t think most people know just how big a difference it can make to not have hockey. You get everybody closer to the floor. The sightlines are a lot better. We\u2019re talking about how much leg room to give people, how much width. I like energy. I want people pumping and thumping in the seats. But you\u2019ve still got to have some bars and clubs. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to pull you back in. Some buildings, in my opinion, try and push you out a little bit to the bars and clubs. Then it\u2019s more of a different kind of social experience. We\u2019re trying to support both. But we want people who really love the game in the building.\u201d The new arena would provide the Clippers with an identity they simply have not had, something that sharing space with the Lakers and their 16 championship banners has always overshadowed. Ballmer took over a team that had stars on the roster \u2014 Chris Paul, Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan \u2014 and in the coaching and front office ranks with Doc Rivers. They were winning and going to the Western Conference playoffs while the Lakers were on the downside of the Kobe Bryant era and missing from the postseason picture. And yet the Clippers still had to battle history and image problems in a city dominated for generations by the Lakers and their prevalent fan culture, one that is pervasive in the Southland and beyond.  \u201cI think we made some progress since Blake, DeAndre and Chris,\u201d Ballmer said of the team\u2019s former stars, each of whom has moved on in trades or free agency. \u201cWe had a winning team basically since these guys came to the Clippers. We changed the guys, but we\u2019ve never been the big dog in town. Now there\u2019s only one other town in America where you have two NBA teams and that\u2019s in New York. So for me, it was a whole other experience in Los Angeles.\u201d Ballmer lives in Seattle, but discovered his love for the game as an 11-year-old in suburban Detroit, watching the Pistons and witnessing the appreciation the hometown team and its stars were afforded from local fans. \u201cFor me growing up in Detroit, it\u2019s the Pistons. It\u2019s always the Pistons,\u201d Ballmer said. \u201cBut in L.A., you have to think about it differently. Not only do we play in the same building, we don\u2019t have the championship pedigree. So you know what, we need our own house. We\u2019re going to define our own identity, in our own house. \u201cWe\u2019d like to build a team that\u2019s tough, competitive, hard-playing guys. I\u2019m not saying every team doesn\u2019t have some aspect of that. But I want that to be our tone \u2026 tough, competitive, gritty and resilient. And I think you have to give people their own house to go and do it. We\u2019re doing it all, the practice facility and everything. And in 2024, we\u2019ll be the newest stadium out there.\u201d That doesn\u2019t mean Ballmer is waiting on 2024 to field a competitive team. The Clippers are 32-27 in possession of the eighth and final playoff spot with 23 games left and Ballmer says, charging ahead with plans to hold on to that postseason berth at all costs. Even after trading Tobias Harris to Philadelphia in a six-player deal at the trade deadline, a deal that netted the Clippers assets including rookie guard Landry Shamet, the Sixers\u2019 own 2020 protected first-round Draft pick and an unprotected 2021 first-round pick from the Miami Heat, Ballmer said the goal remains the same this season. Ballmer loves the roster the Clippers have now and loves the process of continuing to build the basketball side as much as he enjoys being immersed in the business side. \u201cCan I use an analogy? And I don\u2019t want to take it too far,\u201d Ballmer said. \u201cPutting together the roster is a little bit like product development in any other business. Yeah, you\u2019re going to sell and you\u2019re going to market it. But how do you get that right product, the beautiful product the Microsoft Surface or the Xbox or even to competitors to Microsoft, the iPhone. You really want to \u2026 and it\u2019s not easy. You\u2019ve really got to think it through. All of the details matter. \u201cIt\u2019s fun. It\u2019s a little tricky. The other thing, I guess I sort of knew, it\u2019s not like you have invite flexibility. People like to say, \u2018Just go build your roster.\u2019 But it\u2019s really kind of clever. You have to figure all of this out. How does the Draft work? How does free agency work? How does the trade process work? Free agents. Drafts. Trades. How can you use the tools? It\u2019s not like you can trade for anybody in the league. But before you get involved [as an owner], it\u2019s like \u2018Trade for anybody, hire whoever you want, sign whatever free agent you want. I\u2019m always going to get a good draft pick.\u2019 And that\u2019s just not the way it works.\u201d Having fewer degrees of freedom forces you to be even more insightful, Ballmer said. It\u2019s also what keeps his kinetic energy on full blast. \u201cI loved it before, I love it now and we\u2019re probably a little more flexible now,\u201d Ballmer said, \u201cbut we\u2019re in it now. We\u2019re competing for the playoffs because that\u2019s who we are. We\u2019re never going to not compete. I know some other teams have taken some steps back. We bought ourselves a little more flexibility. I\u2019m glad to see our guys doing well now that they\u2019ve moved on. But I love the guys on our team. We have 23 games left and that\u2019s 23 games we\u2019ve got to kick some [expletive] to make the playoffs.\u201d * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

In a few months, some lucky team will be tasked with doing it four times. The Boston Celtics came close to earning their second victory against Milwaukee, but ultimately lost 98-97 after Kia MVP candidate Giannis Antetokounmpo poured in 30 points, 13 rebounds and six assists. The Bucks held the Celtics under 100 points on Thursday, which had only happened once since mid-November. Kyrie Irving\u2019s frigid shooting didn\u2019t help the cause as the All-Star point guard missed 18 of his 27 attempts. But nothing encapsulated the Bucks\u2019 tremendous defensive efforts better than Giannis violently chasing down Jayson Tatum\u2019s dunk attempt in the fourth quarter.  Milwaukee officially won the season series to clinch the tiebreaker, though the chance at that even mattering at this point is slim. As it stands, the Celtics are fifth in the East and 7.5 games behind the Bucks. Mike Budenholzer\u2019s group sits atop the Eastern Conference with a 44-14 record. When going against the East\u2019s next top four teams \u2015 Toronto, Indiana, Philadelphia and Boston \u2015 the Bucks boast an 8-3 record. Again, good luck beating them four times.  What was Buddy Hield doing?! Hield, who fans have enjoyed rooting for all season as part of the resurgent Sacramento Kings, passed up a wide-open, go-ahead shot on the road against the defending champions and settled for a contested turnaround jumper instead. Here\u2019s the actual play, with Sacramento down 125-123 and 6.5 seconds left on the clock.            Was it deep? Sure, but Hield leads the NBA in wide open 3s made and had just connected from that same spot about 12 seconds prior (and that one was in the face of a lengthy Kevin Durant). \u201cI should\u2019ve pulled it, man,\u201d Hield said after the game. \u201cI should\u2019ve pulled it, no excuse.\u201d \u201cI thought he was gonna shoot it,\u201d Kings point guard De\u2019Aaron Fox said. \u201cWe were like \u2018You shoulda shot that (expletive).'\u201d You can tell by Draymond Green\u2019s reaction upon noticing Hield wide open, even he thought it was going up. Nonetheless, you have to love the fight in Hield and these Kings, who came into the season as the sixth-most inexperienced squad in the league and were projected to be in the lottery yet again. Now they\u2019re in a realistic battle for the playoffs in a cutthroat Western Conference. Sacramento is 1.5 games out of the eighth seed, stationed behind the LA Clippers. Landing at that spot would presumably set up a Warriors-Kings first-round matchup, which is one enticing possibility after seeing how these two California teams have played each other this season. The Warriors won all four games, but three points was the combined margin of victory. Durant admitted neither of those were a given. \u201cThat\u2019s the fourth game that we deserved to lose against this team,\u201d he said.  What if Hield\u2019s late decision eventually haunts Sacramento? That\u2019s obviously not quantifiable \u2015 he truly could\u2019ve missed the shot \u2015 but it might certainly cross the sharpshooter\u2019s mind come April if the Kings just miss the postseason (he said himself he\u2019s always checking the standings and playoff race). The Los Angeles Lakers, fighting from the West\u2019s 10th spot, now trail Sacramento by one game after a 111-106 comeback victory against the Rockets. LeBron James declared earlier in the day that his playoff-mode has been activated. He continued that mantra after the win. \u201dI need to be in that level right now. Knowing the circumstances we are in and kick starting something,\u201d said James, who finished with a modest 29 points, 11 rebounds and six assists. \u201dI like where I am at and will continue to get better. Tonight was a step in the right direction.'\u201d  Coming off his impressive dunk to close out last Sunday\u2019s All-Star Game, Stephen Curry carried his momentum into some real action for his very first dunk of the season.            Hall of Famer Allen Iverson delivered a tribute video to another player set to join him in Springfield, Mass., one day. Iverson recognized Dwyane Wade during the Heat legend\u2019s final game in Philadelphia. \u201cYou were so great for us fans,\u201d Iverson said. \u201cSo entertaining. So exciting for us to watch. Definitely one of the best two guards to ever play the game.\u201d Wade recorded a team-high 19 points and six rebounds in the loss to the Sixers . The 37-year-old also added one block to his stat sheet, swatting away former teammate and good friend Jimmy Butler with some solid help defense.              Wade\u2019s final stretch run is here and it\u2019s time to start counting down how many games the Miami Heat\u2019s all-time leading scorer has left. Twenty-five. Twenty-five more games left in this last dance. Twenty-five more games left to watch one of the most tantalizing shooting guards the league has ever witnessed. Afterwards, and this is excluding a possible playoff run, we\u2019ll never see a player run up the court in a No. 3 Miami Heat jersey again.  Wade exchanged one of those jerseys with an up-and-coming guard who, quite fittingly, wears No. 25.  Enes Kanter made his debut for the Trail Blazers and was rather productive in Portland\u2019s win over Brooklyn. The Turkish big man finished with 18 points (8-9 FG) and nine rebounds in 19 minutes off the bench. After spending the last season-and-a-half in New York, Kanter says he forgot how it feels to be in the win column. Shabazz Napier diced up his former team in the first half, dishing eight assists in just eight minutes. For his eighth dime \u2015 he finished with 10 in the loss \u2015 the fifth-year point guard looked like a football center: hike it and protect the man behind you.

It was an ugly contest played by two rusty teams, the absence of rhythm from a weeklong All-Star break masquerading as pesky defense \u2014 yeah, that\u2019s it, defense \u2014 rather than off-kilter shooting. The Bucks\u2019 98-97 victory at Fiserv Forum on Thursday was so unsightly, in fact, that Milwaukee\u2019s new sniper, Nikola Mirotic, got his first field goal with his new club on a layup. Off an offensive rebound. Not exactly Threekola . \u201cAll I wanted to do was make the layup,\u201d Mirotic said afterward, smiling. \u201cLet me make the layup first, and then we go on.\u201d Milwaukee goes on with a 44-14 record, best in the NBA. The Bucks already have won as many games as they did in all of 2017-18, but let\u2019s face it, that reference point largely has become irrelevant. Last season is best remembered for its underachievement, a half-dozen games above .500 and a first-round ouster by these same Celtics . The designs are grander this time, and Mirotic\u2019s arrival at the Feb. 7 trade deadline is the latest reason for that. With the Philadelphia 76ers picking up Tobias Harris and Jonathon Simmons, with the Toronto Raptors adding Marc Gasol and with Boston still considered the deepest of the Eastern Conference\u2019s contenders, it was important for the Bucks to keep pace in the arms race. Mirotic, 28, is a 6-foot-10 stretch 4 who had a 59.1 true shooting percentage for New Orleans before the trade to Milwaukee, and who hit 43.1 percent of his 3-pointers in two rounds of the playoffs last spring. In his Bucks debut \u2014 and first appearance, period, since January 23, due to a right calf sprain \u2014 Mirotic scored eight points with three rebounds and 2-of-6 shooting from the arc. \u201cNiko was great,\u201d said Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer. \u201cHe just has a way of playing, has the confidence. He\u2019s been a pro for a long time, so he was anxious to get back and contribute. I think he feels great about the opportunity, the team he\u2019s joining. He just wants to help us, and I think he helped us tonight. On both ends.\u201d Mirotic did make his presence felt defensively, a must for any Milwaukee newcomer. The Bucks led the NBA in defensive rating (101.6) and opponents\u2019 field-goal percentage (43 percent) heading into Thursday\u2019s game, then held the Celtics to 97 points on 38.2 percent shooting. \u201cThat\u2019s what I do, I also play defense, that\u2019s true,\u201d Mirotic said. \u201cA lot of guys think I just shoot the basketball, shoot 3s. I feel fresh. Seriously. I\u2019ve been out for more than 10 days \u2026 I know I can guard. Last year in the playoffs was a huge step up for me, showing what I can do defensively and rebound the ball. With this team, I have to bring everything I can. They\u2019ve put a lot of trust in me.\u201d Khris Middleton made Milwaukee\u2019s biggest 3-pointer, hitting from out front to make it 98-95 with 32.5 seconds remaining. But Mirotic sandwiched a pair of them around a Boston timeout with about three minutes to go in the third quarter. Then he took to the floor for a loose ball, tussling with Celtics strongman Marcus Morris to force a jump ball. Said Middleton: \u201cFor his first game with a new team and being out a month, he came in and made some big shots. You could see what he can bring to this team. His skill set, his versatility and his IQ. He\u2019s a guy who should be able to fit right in with us.\u201d While Middleton, Bucks MVP candidate Giannis Antetokounmpo and the entire coaching staff represented the team at All-Star Weekend in Charlotte, North Carolina, Mirotic spent the break getting treatment, putting up shots and finding a house for himself, wife Nina and son Alexsej. They are settling in \u201cabout 3 minutes away\u201d from the practice facility and arena. Finally, on Wednesday, he was able to practice 5-on-5. And he had a conversation with Antetokounmpo that, they hope, fast-tracks Mirotic\u2019s comfort level. \u201cI talked a little bit with him,\u201d Antetokounmpo said. \u201cHe said, sometimes when I pass to him I caught him off guard. He doesn\u2019t think I\u2019m able to make those passes to the corner. So I told him, \u2018You\u2019ve always got to be ready. Whenever I\u2019m coming down and I see a [defender], taking a step toward the paint, you\u2019ve got to be ready. He was ready the second half. He knocked down some big shots for us. He\u2019s going to keep playing great.\u201d Mirotic\u2019s playing time looks like it will come at forward D.J. Wilson\u2019s expense, at least based on one night. But that\u2019s no issue at all for the chemistry-rich Bucks. He felt nervous initially when he subbed in, but Mirotic settled down swiftly, thanks to a rousing welcome by Bucks fans and some advice from Budenholzer. \u201cJust play simple,\u201d Mirotic said. \u201cThe way the guys played, that\u2019s exactly how I like it. Spread the floor, run the floor. Just beautiful basketball. With this team, it\u2019s easy because all they want to do is space the floor. Create space for Giannis to get to the basket, so tonight they were talking to me a lot.\u201d The more Mirotic helps Milwaukee, the more beautiful things are going to get for all of them. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

The league has sent a proposal to the National Basketball Players Association on lowering the minimum age for entering the NBA Draft from 19 to 18, and the union discussed the contents at a meeting in the Bahamas earlier this week, a person with knowledge of the matter told The Associated Press on Thursday. The person spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because neither side released the proposal publicly. USA Today Sports first reported the proposal being sent. The proposal changed hands during NBA All-Star Weekend and was not in reaction to Duke star Zion Williamson, quite possibly the No. 1 pick in this year\u2019s draft, suffering a Grade 1, or minor, sprain of his right knee on Wednesday night. Williamson, a freshman, is widely expected to be in the NBA next season and forgo his final three seasons of collegiate eligibility. Neither the league nor the players\u2019 union has hidden the fact that both sides want the current system changed. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said last July that it was time to revert back to the policy that will allow players to go into the league right out of high school, something that will have to be collectively bargained with the players. The NBPA has had previous talks with the NBA on the idea, which is likely to be in place by the 2022 draft. \u201cI think it\u2019s a good idea,\u201d Boston\u2019s Jayson Tatum, who went to the NBA after one season at Duke, said at All-Star weekend. \u201cIf you\u2019re good enough to come out of high school, I feel like you should be able to. But I don\u2019t make those decisions.\u201d Golden State\u2019s DeMarcus Cousins, who played at Kentucky, told reporters Thursday that knowing what he knows now makes him question why players need to play college basketball \u2013 especially if they\u2019re NBA-ready. \u201cI don\u2019t understand the point of it,\u201d Cousins said of the `one-and-done\u2019 rule. \u201cWhat\u2019s the difference between 18 and 19 and 17 and 18? You\u2019re immature, you\u2019re young, you\u2019re ignorant to life in general. So what\u2019s really the difference? You\u2019ve still got a lot of growing to do as a man.\u201d The one-and-done rule has been in place since the 2006 draft. Silver, who was once a proponent of raising the draft minimum age to 20 before changing his mind, said last year that he believes the league and the players \u201ccan create a better system.\u201d"},{"id":35378,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/anthony-davis-remain-lineup-now","date":"2019-02-21","title":"Davis to remain in Pelicans' lineup -- for now","content":" METAIRIE, La. (AP) \u2014 When Pelicans finished practice on Thursday, Anthony Davis went into coach Alvin Gentry\u2019s office, followed later by interim general manager Danny Ferry. As they spoke, privacy shades on windows that otherwise offer a view of practice courts were pulled down. After the meeting, Gentry said Davis was slated to start at Indiana on Friday night. But beyond that, the Pelicans weren\u2019t ready to shed much light on how they plan to handle having their disaffected six-time All-Star on the roster for the final seven weeks of the regular season. \u201cHe\u2019s playing tomorrow,\u201d Gentry said repeatedly in response to varying questions about Davis\u2019 status with the club. \u201cHe\u2019s playing the game tomorrow. Let\u2019s get to that one and then we can worry about everything else.\u201d On Saturday night, the Pelicans are scheduled to host LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers. Davis, who is represented by the same agent as James, has requested a trade. The Lakers tried to acquire Davis before this season\u2019s Feb. 7 trade deadline, but the Pelicans declined to move him, opting instead to wait until the offseason, when more will be known about draft slots and more teams can make concrete offers. NBA rules forbid clubs from resting healthy players in ways deemed detrimental to the league, particularly for nationally televised games and road games. So the Pelicans are trying to determine the best way to comply with those rules during their final 23 games while also planning for a future without Davis. Gentry characterized the ongoing saga the strangest thing he has been a part of \u201cin my life.\u201d The game at Indiana will be the Pelicans\u2019 first since they fired general manager Dell Demps on Friday and appointed Ferry as his interim replacement. Gentry, who was hired by Demps to coach a team built around Davis, said he\u2019d like to continue coaching New Orleans under the next general manager, whatever his vision for the roster may be. \u201cI love New Orleans. I like being here,\u201d Gentry said. \u201cI love my job and I\u2019d like to be here a long time.\u201d Gentry also said he retains \u201ca ton of respect\u201d for Demps. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be here without Dell,\u201d Gentry said. \u201cWe worked well together and I appreciate what he did for me.\u201d Based on the philosophy expressed in the past by Pelicans upper management, the next general manager will have the freedom to pick a new coach. Gentry sounded resigned to the possibility that his tenure here might not last beyond this season. The Pelicans are emerging from the All-Star break with a 26-33 record, six games out of the Western Conference\u2019s eighth and final playoff spot. This is Gentry\u2019s fourth season, and New Orleans\u2019 only playoff berth since he was hired came last season. \u201cWhat I\u2019m going to concentrate on is 23 more games and to have them try to play at a real high level and compete at a real high level, find out a little bit about our younger guys,\u201d Gentry said. \u201cAs a coach, you\u2019ve got to try to get your guys to see if they can focus on the task at hand, and that\u2019s playing basketball games \u2013 and you know it\u2019s not easy to do with some of the things that\u2019s going on right now. That\u2019s asking a lot out of anybody with the way things have been. But that\u2019s what we\u2019re here to do.\u201d Pelicans center Jahlil Okafor, who was the only player to speak with reporters after practice, insisted that he and his teammates were not bothered by Davis\u2019 continued presence in the lineup. \u201cIt\u2019s normal for us. That\u2019s a credit to AD. He\u2019s such a great person \u2013 he\u2019s such a great teammate \u2013 that we love having him around,\u201d Okafor said. \u201cI think everybody here selfishly would like him to stay. But at the end of the day, we want him to be happy and we want what\u2019s best for him. But it isn\u2019t awkward for us at all.\u201d"},{"id":35382,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/reports-bucks-nikola-mirotic-could-play-vs-celtics","date":"2019-02-21","title":"Bucks' Mirotic, via Twitter, declares himself ready to play","content":" * Tonight on TNT:  Celtics vs. Bucks, 8 ET Newly acquired Milwaukee Bucks forward Nikola Mirotic, nursing a calf injury, seems poised to make his Milwaukee debut tonight against the Boston Celtics.

However, Mirotic seemed to make it more certain he\u2019s playing by releasing a video on Twitter this afternoon that simply read: \u201cI\u2019m ready,\u201d followed by a fire emoji, a basketball emoji and #FearTheDear. The Bucks, currently the top team in the Eastern Conference, acquired Mirotic in a deal with the New Orleans Pelicans at the Feb. 7 trade deadline. Milwaukee gave up Jason Smith and Stanley Johnson and four second-round picks. Mirotic has played in 32 games this season for the Pelicans, and has been productive, averaging career highs in points (16.7) and rebounds (8.3) per game, and is close to his highs in steals and blocks.

If this happens, this would be the one of the most embarrassing events of LeBron James\u2019 otherwise dreamy career. That\u2019s all. Nothing else at stake here. Yes, the Los Angeles Lakers missing the playoffs would almost guarantee Luke Walton will not return as coach next season. The team\u2019s braintrust, led by team president Magic Johnson, would feel plenty of pinch to upgrade the club this summer. But those are down-the-road worries and repercussions. At the center of it all is the pride of the game\u2019s greatest player and a potential rewind to the 2004-05 season \u2014 the last time James missed the playoffs. Back then, James had a good excuse: he was only in his second season, expectations were low and his team (the Cleveland Cavaliers) wasn\u2019t exactly dripping talent. This is different. This is the first year of LeBron joining a historic franchise and the white-hot glow that comes with that. And this is the NBA so accustomed to, and somewhat reliant on, LeBron playing in springtime. Don\u2019t forget, LeBron\u2019s teams have made eight straight trips to The Finals . He said twice Wednesday how he will be \u201cdifferent\u201d in the remaining two months of the season, dropping hints that \u201cplayoff LeBron\u201d will debut here in mid-February out of necessity. \u201cI haven\u2019t been in this position in a while,\u201d he said, meaning one game under .500 after the All-Star break. \u201cThis is where we are right now. I\u2019m going to be a little bit different, a little earlier than I\u2019d like to be. My level of intensity has to be a little bit different.\u201d The Push For The Playoffs has become the Lakers\u2019 new and unexpected slogan that will text everyone involved. It won\u2019t be simple or easy, even if LeBron plays full blast. The schedule is treacherous, with the Lakers sporting the West\u2019s fourth-toughest remaining schedule . The Lakers are 28-29, three games out of the No. 8 spot with 25 to play (13 of which are road games). They must play, among others, the two conference leaders (Golden State and Milwaukee Bucks), as well as the Toronto Raptors, Houston Rockets, Boston Celtics, Denver Nuggets, Portland Trail Blazers, Utah Jazz (twice) and Oklahoma City Thunder. Some of those teams are either fighting for home-court advantage or some playoff insurance. > Schuhmann:  Breaking down stretch-run schedules \u201cI look forward to being challenged by a lot of great teams,\u201d James said. Last season, it took 47 wins to clinch the No. 8 spot . Assuming that\u2019s the mark again, the Lakers must finish 19-6. Understand, the Lakers haven\u2019t won four straight games, their longest winning streak of the season, since mid-December. And even if they reach the playoffs, it\u2019ll likely mean a first-round date with the two-time defending-champion Warriors. \u201cStranger things have happened, but it would be weird to have the playoffs and not have him in the playoffs,\u201d said Warriors guard Klay Thompson. \u201cLike, weird.\u201d The LA Clippers, currently the No. 8 seed, have dwindling motivation and ability to make the playoffs. They traded their best player (Tobias Harris) earlier this month to create cap room for a summer free-agent run. If they make the playoffs, their No. 1 pick goes to the Celtics. If they fall into the lottery, they keep it. More realistically, this is about the Lakers competing down the stretch against the energized and hungry Sacramento Kings. They haven\u2019t made the playoffs in 13 seasons and don\u2019t have a No. 1 pick in the 2019 draft. The Lakers are also fighting the proud San Antonio Spurs, who haven\u2019t missed the playoffs since coach Gregg Popovich\u2019s first season. Following their Christmas Day win in Oakland, the Lakers were No. 4 in the West . But the season was thrown for a loop with LeBron\u2019s groin injury-induced absence and other Lakers injuries and suspensions. The Lakers still aren\u2019t at full strength until Lonzo Ball recovers from his ankle sprain . That should come soon, although he has yet to practice. LeBron has made a habit of carrying lesser teams to the playoffs and beyond , although he did that in the East without missing many games. This is another, different hill to climb. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to the second half of the season, looking forward to seeing what we can do to get back into this playoff race,\u201d James said after the All-Star Game. \u201cThat\u2019s my mindset. That\u2019s the only thing that\u2019s going to happen in my mental space for these next two months, pretty much how I can get this team playing the type of level of basketball we were playing before my injury.\u201d Before the season went sideways, the Lakers were indeed intriguing. LeBron defied age once again and put up Kia MVP-like numbers, including a reliable touch on 3-pointers . JaVale McGee was a pleasantly surprising source of offense, Rajon Rondo was efficiently steady and the young core of Ball, Brandon Ingram and Kyle Kuzma had their moments. At the All-Star break, LeBron and Rondo had just returned, Ball was hurt, McGee was the No. 2 center ( behind the now-departed Ivica Zubac ), Ingram was an enigma and Kuzma was rising as a solid No. 2 scorer. And of course, the Davis drama weighed on the locker room. \u201cAll I know,\u201d Kuzma said, \u201cis when we were healthy, we won. We were fine. The goal is to get back to that. Let\u2019s get a healthy team and then we\u2019ll see. I\u2019m confident in what we can do.\u201d This was always designated as an exploratory season for the Lakers with LeBron. Entering the season, they had young players without playoff experience. They had veterans on one-year contracts serving as bridge-gap players so the Lakers can keep their salary cap flexible for 2019. In a sense, there was never any false hopes by management of making the Warriors sweat. But making the playoffs? That was expected. > The West:  Who can contend with Warriors? \u201cIt was our goal at the beginning of the season and still our goal,\u201d LeBron said. If they do, the Lakers might make it interesting in the first round if they see, for example, the inexperienced Denver Nuggets (or any other non-Warriors team). If they don\u2019t, then it\u2019s an embarrassment for the Lakers and setback for LeBron. It will fuel the perception that he needs tons of help to win anything of significance in the more competitive West (although plenty of player movement this summer could shift the landscape drastically). With the trade deadline passed and Davis still in New Orleans, LeBron must make do with what he has. And to hear him, he has plenty. \u201cI\u2019m all about being uncomfortable,\u201d James said. \u201cI like being uncomfortable, I enjoy being counted out. Look, we gotta win games. \u2026 Go out there and do your job. Control what you can control and what you can\u2019t control don\u2019t worry about.\u201d * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

They have the West\u2019s best defense thus far, an MVP candidate, a former MVP averaging a triple-double, and a starting lineup with the league\u2019s best raw plus-minus by a wide margin. The Thunder are 13-9 against the other nine teams in the West\u2019s top 10, with wins over eight of the nine. And all nine of the losses were within five points in the last five minutes. In total, the Thunder only have three losses that weren\u2019t within five points in the last five minutes. Every other team in the league has at least twice as many. Coming out of the All-Star break, Oklahoma City looks to be comfortably top three in the West, and staying there would allow them to avoid the likely No. 1 seed Golden State Warriors until the conference finals. But before they can do that, the Thunder will have to navigate the league\u2019s toughest post-break schedule , with 17 of their 25 remaining games against teams that have winning records at the All-Star break. That includes three games against the two teams \u2014 Denver (2) and Golden State (1) \u2014 ahead of them in the West and another three against the top two teams \u2014 Milwaukee (1) and Toronto (2) \u2014 in the East. The Thunder will play 14 of their final 25 games at home, where they\u2019re 20-7. But they have twice as many games with a rest disadvantage (4) as they have with a rest advantage (2). One of those rest disadvantage games is at the end of a 5-games-in-7 days stretch from March 2-8 that includes road games against the Spurs, Blazers and Clippers. Rest advantage \/ Rest disadvantage: Games in which one team (at a disadvantage) played the day before and the other (at an advantage) did not. This season, teams are 129-85 (.603) with a rest advantage, 97-42 (.698) at home and 32-43 (.427) on the road. There will be no easy matchups in the Western Conference playoffs, but there will be an advantage to finishing second or third. If the Thunder can do that after playing the league\u2019s toughest post-break schedule, they will have earned it. Here\u2019s a breakdown of every Western Conference team\u2019s remaining schedule\u2026 NOTES HEAD-TO-HEAD Golden State vs. Denver \u2013 Series tied, 1-1 . Golden State vs. Oklahoma City \u2013 Series tied, 1-1 . Denver vs. Oklahoma City \u2013 Denver leads, 2-0 .  These teams aren\u2019t necessarily safe in regard to making or missing the playoffs. The fourth-place Blazers are just four games ahead of the ninth-place Kings. But for the sake of organization (and because the teams in sixth and seven place have easier schedules than those in fourth and fifth), we\u2019ll keep \u2019em separated. Interestingly, there are only two games left to play between these four teams (see below). NOTES HEAD-TO-HEAD Portland vs. Houston \u2013 Portland won, 2-1 . Portland vs. Utah \u2013 Series tied, 2-2 . Portland vs. San Antonio \u2013 Portland leads, 2-1 . * * * Houston vs. Utah \u2013 Series tied, 2-2 . Houston vs. San Antonio \u2013 Houston leads, 2-1 . * * * Utah vs. San Antonio \u2013 Utah won, 2-1 . This is where things get really interesting. We have the Los Angeles Lakers trying to end a five-year playoff drought (the longest in franchise history) and LeBron James trying to keep his personal playoff streak (13 years \u2014 without losing in the first round) alive. And the two teams between the 10th-place Lakers and a postseason spot are a long-time rival riding a 12-year playoff drought (the Sacramento Kings) and the team with whom they share an arena (the LA Clippers). The Clippers traded their leading scorer at the deadline, but won two of their last three games before the All-Star break to hold a one-game edge over the Kings (they\u2019re tied in the loss column) for eighth place. And of the three teams, the Clips have the easiest remaining schedule. (Apologies to the Minnesota Timberwolves , who are just a game behind the Lakers and went into the break with home wins over the Clippers and Rockets. If they\u2019re still hanging around after playing 11 of their next 16 games on the road, we can certainly revisit this race.) NOTES HEAD-TO-HEAD LA Clippers vs. Sacramento \u2013 Clippers lead, 3-0 LA Clippers vs. L.A. Lakers \u2013 Series tied, 1-1 Sacramento vs. L.A. Lakers \u2013 Lakers lead, 2-1 Here\u2019s a breakdown of every Eastern Conference team\u2019s remaining schedule\u2026 While people on the outside dream of a pair of Eastern Conference semifinals that include the Boston Celtics, Milwaukee Bucks, Philadelphia 76ers and Toronto Raptors, a fifth team could prevent that from even being a possibility. As the East stands now, the Celtics and Sixers would face each other in the first round, because the Indiana Pacers are in third place, having run off a six-game winning streak before losing to Milwaukee in their last game before the break. The Pacers are without Victor Oladipo for the rest of the season, but still have the league\u2019s No. 2-ranked defense and a solid starting lineup that includes the recently added Wesley Matthews. NOTES The Raptors will be done playing the other four teams in this group before we get to March. They\u2019ve already played 14 of their 15 games within the group and they\u2019ll play their final game against the Celtics on Tuesday. HEAD-TO-HEAD Milwaukee vs. Toronto \u2013 Bucks won, 3-1 Milwaukee vs. Indiana \u2013 Bucks lead, 2-1 Milwaukee vs. Boston \u2013 Series tied, 1-1 Milwaukee vs. Philadelphia \u2013 Bucks lead, 1-0 * * * Toronto vs. Indiana \u2013 Raptors won, 2-1 Toronto vs. Boston \u2013 Celtics lead, 2-1 Toronto vs. Philadelphia \u2013 Raptors won, 3-1 * * * Indiana vs. Boston \u2013 Series tied, 1-1 Indiana vs. Philadelphia \u2013 Sixers lead, 2-1 * * * Boston vs. Philadelphia \u2013 Celtics lead, 3-0  With the Washington Wizards having lost seven of their last 10 games before the break, it appears that five teams will be fighting for the final three spots in the East over the next two months. Coming out of the break, the Brooklyn Nets and Charlotte Hornets are in sixth and seventh place, respectively. But those two teams have the Eastern Conference\u2019s two toughest-remaining schedules in regard to cumulative opponent winning percentage. The ninth-place Miami Heat could be getting Goran Dragic back from a two-month absence and the 10th-place Orlando Magic went into the break by winning seven of their last eight games. So things could get interesting, even if this isn\u2019t the most inspiring group of playoff contenders. And the last night of the season will include two games \u2014 Miami at Brooklyn and Orlando at Charlotte \u2014 within the group. NOTES The Nets actually have six rest-advantage games remaining (most in the East), and they\u2019ll have a rest advantage in three of their five remaining games within this group. HEAD-TO-HEAD Brooklyn vs. Charlotte \u2013 Series tied, 1-1 Brooklyn vs. Detroit \u2013 Series tied, 1-1 Brooklyn vs. Miami \u2013 Series tied, 1-1 Brooklyn vs. Orlando \u2013 Brooklyn won, 2-1 * * * Charlotte vs. Detroit \u2013 Hornets lead, 3-0 Charlotte vs. Miami \u2013 Hornets lead, 2-0 Charlotte vs. Orlando \u2013 Hornets lead, 2-1 * * * Detroit vs. Miami \u2013 Series tied, 1-1 Detroit vs. Orlando \u2013 Pistons lead, 2-1 * * * Miami vs. Orlando \u2013 Magic lead, 2-1 * * * John Schuhmann is a senior stats analyst for NBA.com.

It wasn\u2019t supposed to be pretty this season over on this side of the NBA. With LeBron James\u2019 decision to spend his late prime in Los Angeles , the Eastern Conference looked initially like a default situation. Somebody was going to win it, whether they were worthy of challenging whoever came out of the West (subliminal: Golden State!) or not. > The West:  Who can contend with Warriors? Nine days later, though, Toronto traded for the San Antonio Spurs\u2019 unhappy star, Kawhi Leonard . The Milwaukee bucks perked up instantly under the tutelage of new coach Mike Budenholzer . The Philadelphia 76ers flipped Dario Saric and Robert Covington for Minnesota\u2019s All-Star disruptor Jimmy Butler . And lo and behold, the East began to look not merely interesting but formidable. So much so that an arms race ensued at the trade deadline . The Raptors (Marc Gasol), the Sixers (Tobias Harris) and the Bucks (Nikola Mirotic) all upgraded their talent bases. Boston? Well, the Celtics kept their powder dry presumably for the Anthony Davis sweepstakes this summer . But then, with Kyrie Irving around after having missed last spring\u2019s playoffs and Gordon Hayward back, period, it could be argued those guys already got their infusion of help. And at a level higher than any of their rivals. Then there\u2019s the plucky Indiana Pacers, who seem almost to have been galvanized by the loss of their star player, Victor Oladipo . With insights from a few NBA advance scouts (who remain anonymous here), here is a breakdown of the East\u2019s Fab Five, in order of their position in the standings as the dash to the postseason begins. * * * Other than the Lakers (James) and the Rockets (James Harden), no team in the NBA \u2014 and certainly no team in the East \u2014 is more dependent on one player than the Bucks. Giannis Antetokounmpo probably is the leading candidate for 2019 Kia Most Valuable Player at this point, but the talent and impact gap between him and Milwaukee\u2019s second-best player is greater than any of these other contenders. The Bucks are 13.7 points better than their opponents when \u201cThe Greek Freak\u201d is on the floor. They\u2019re 2-2 in games he has missed vs. 41-12 when he plays. Now imagine even a minor injury that costs him, say, two games in a best-of-seven series. Yeah, trouble. Still, if Antetokounmpo stays healthy and gets rest late in games when wins are secure, Milwaukee has a legit shot at its first Finals trip since 1974 . The ensemble cast around Antetokounmpo fits him perfectly, spreading the floor to open penetration lanes and seizing on the kick-outs when defenders converge on him. The Bucks are third in 3-pointers made , second in attempts and \u2014 if you take out Antetokounmpo\u2019s 29-of-130 \u2014 they rise from 34.9 percent to 35.7 percent in 3-point accuracy. And this is without Mirotic. Defensively the Bucks are taking away the other guys\u2019 3-point opportunities, sweeping the defensive boards and relying on Antetokounmpo\u2019s and Brook Lopez\u2019s size as needed in the paint. There\u2019s a noticeable bump in Bucks chemistry this season that those inside the locker room will tell you sparks winning, rather than vice versa. Two ongoing goals have kept them focused and resilient, too: Milwaukee has yet to lose two games in a row, and the Bucks have struck back hard whenever facing a team that beat them previously. None of the East powers stood to benefit more from James\u2019 shift from Eastern to Pacific time zones than these guys. It wasn\u2019t just his basketball excellence that had gotten in the Raptors\u2019 way postseason after postseason \u2014 it was his dominance in the East ( eight consecutive Finals trips ) that had tormented them. Not since, oh, Michael Jordan vs. the New York Knicks had a single superstar seemed to pitch a tent inside an opponent\u2019s heads. Even a status quo version of Toronto, led by Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan, might have seen different results this time. But with Leonard, Gasol and underrated buyout pickup Jeremy Lin, this is a bolder, mentally freed squad that could be more efficient than last spring\u2019s edition. Gasol figures to keep divvying minutes with Serge Ibaka. But as well as Toronto played with Jonas Valanciunas, Gasol should be that and more. Similar size, more adept as a passer and shooter. \u201cHe\u2019s so skilled and he\u2019s really motivated,\u201d a scout said of Gasol and this opportunity to salvage a difficult season. \u201cAnd they got out of a couple contracts in C.J. Miles and Valanciunas.\u201d Granted, Toronto has gone 13-3 when Leonard has not played. But keeping one of the NBA\u2019s elite two-way players healthy is a must once the playoffs start. Forward Pascal Siakam might be the favorite at this point for the Kia Most Improved Player Award (16.1 ppg, 7.0 rpg and 55 percent shooting). Lin stabilizes the backcourt, especially while Fred Van Vleet recovers from thumb surgery . It was not without some downside risk that boss Masai Ujiri changed coaches, firing Dwane Casey to promote assistant Nick Nurse . But Nurse has tweaked the Raptors masterfully. They won their last six games before the break and 10 of 13. Not only are they 24-5 at home (and 16-6 against the West), but they are 9-4 in games decided by three points or fewer. As our John Schuhmann points out : Toronto has the easiest schedule in the league from here till the postseason (only two back-to-backs, with 16 of 23 games against foes .500 or worse). The Pacers exit the All-Star break third in the East , one game ahead of both Philadelphia and Boston in the standings. Most insiders and even Indiana fans figure them to dip to fifth, considering the loss of Oladipo. Still, it speaks volumes about the roster and staff that they\u2019re projected not just to hang onto a playoff berth, but keep a gap between themselves and the last three seeds. Granted, being up 8 1\/2 games on sixth-place Brooklyn with 24 left to play is swell math regardless. But the Pacers are the closest thing the East has to Monty Python\u2019s \u201cHoly Grail\u201d Black Knight , the feisty sentry who refuses to quit regardless of how many limbs he loses. It might not say much for Oladipo in a classic, how-much-do-they-miss-him MVP argument that Indiana looked locked into a third-, fourth- or fifth-place finish with or without him. But it says plenty about the Pacers\u2019 fortitude. \u201cI think they\u2019re going to stay in the battle,\u201d one scout said. \u201cThey\u2019re very well-coached. They\u2019ve got a lot of good character guys. And Wes Matthews isn\u2019t Victor Oladipo, but he will help them. They\u2019re a team .\u201d Indiana has tough, no-muss-or-fuss performers such as Thaddeus Young and Domantas Sabonis. Coach Nate McMillan and his staff are underrated on an annual basis. And this team rises and falls on its defense ( first in fewest points allowed and second in defensive rating ). That\u2019s key, because the Pacers don\u2019t have the firepower of the East\u2019s presumed Big Four, and the offense has been more raggedy without Oladipo. \u201cYou know what they say, \u2018defense travels,\u2019 too,\u201d said the scout. The Pacers are 8.5 points worse defensively away from home, but they have managed a 16-12 road mark. That\u2019s the East\u2019s third-best mark behind the Bucks (20-9) and the Raptors (19-11). As soon as Harris joined the Sixers , the quickie description of this team became: Best starting lineup in the NBA other than Golden State. They have All-Stars, real or worthy, at all five spots, making it impossible to double Joel Embiid, Ben Simmons or any of them, frankly. \u201cI\u2019d worry about their depth,\u201d a scout said. \u201cThen with Jimmy Butler, he just doesn\u2019t quite fit their team, for me. Yes, he can defend, but he\u2019s not a space-the-court jump shooter and he needs the ball a lot for their offense.\u201d With all the frontcourt depth Philadelphia has, you can mix and match as needed. Coach Brett Brown should never have to rely entirely on reserves unless he wants to (or it\u2019s garbage time). Butler is quite happy to take charge of second-unit duties for the ball dominance it offers. Another trade deadline move that could help came in sending Markelle Fultz to Orlando for Jonathon Simmons and a first-round pick . The pick makes up a bit for the one they shipped to Boston in a pick swap before the 2017 draft . It also closes the book on Fultz and what looks like a regrettable detour in \u201cThe Process,\u201d up there with Nerlens Noel and Jahlil Okafor. Additionally, new GM Elton Brand has been impressive in his early days on the job, so the buyout market still is in play. The \u201cfragile\u201d days of Embiid sure appear to be over \u2026 or did, until Wednesday\u2019s reveal of left knee soreness. And few other teams run as \u201chot\u201d as the Sixers emotionally, which can be a positive if directed toward the Finals prize. It would seem to be a terrific problem to have: too many quality players. Yet Boston has sagged this season in part because of a blurry pecking order, an abundance of talent in which no two or three talented leaders have emerged to embody the will of coach Brad Stevens on the group. There are personalities and insecurities involved in that, such that even a presumptive conference favorite can get sidetracked. Said one scout: \u201cWhen a team gets deeper and a guy\u2019s minutes get pinched, sometimes when they do get out there, they press.\u201d Let\u2019s not overlook the Davis speculation, either. Boston has been all about the summer on that, so the uncertainty hasn\u2019t been as pressing as for the Lakers. Still, there are young Celtics players who wonder how long they\u2019ll be around. Then there\u2019s the challenge of being the East\u2019s hunted, at least when this began. \u201cExpectations were so high for that team,\u201d said another scout, \u201cand some of them may have thought it would be easier than it\u2019s been. Working Hayward back into the rotation was a bigger challenge than many expected. There are young guys who are playing for contracts a little bit.\u201d Hayward has been better lately, averaging 14.6 points and 4.0 assists in February vs. 10.4 ppg and 3.8 rpg in December . Irving reigns as the best finisher in the league and more playoff battle-hardened than any other player in the conference. And yet the Celtics have gone 9-2 when he hasn\u2019t played. That might say less about him than it does the rest of the roster. When a herd like this gets thinned, a more streamlined pecking order can emerge. Besides, Terry Rozier is a defensive upgrade on Irving. The Celtics have confidence built over the past two seasons against the Sixers and they seem up to any challenge posed by the Raptors. The Bucks, however, could pose a matchup because Boston\u2019s frontline that gives up a few too many inches to Milwaukee\u2019s when Al Horford plays. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

(AP) \u2014 Former President Barack Obama and Golden State Warriors superstar Stephen Curry told a roomful of minority boys on Tuesday that they matter and urged them to make the world a better place. Obama was in Oakland, California, to mark the fifth anniversary of My Brother\u2019s Keeper, an initiative he started after the 2012 shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin. The death of the African-American teen sparked protests over racial profiling. The initiative was a call to communities to close opportunity gaps for minority boys, especially African-American, Latino and Native American boys, Obama said to roughly 100 boys attending the alliance\u2019s first national gathering. The My Brother\u2019s Keeper Alliance is part of the Obama Foundation. \u201cWe had to be able to say to them, \u2018you matter, we care about you, we believe in you and we are going to make sure that you have the opportunities and chances to move forward just like everybody else\u2019,\u201d Obama said. Obama, who left office in 2013, was joined by basketball star Curry. The men spoke for about an hour, answering questions from the audience and joking around. They talked about lacking confidence or being aimless as teens. Obama praised single mothers, including his own. He advised the boys to look for a mentor, and to find opportunities to guide others. Curry joined the former president in praising the value of teamwork. \u201cWhat we do on the court and the joy that comes out of that is second to none,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause nothing great is done by yourself.\u201d The former president cracked up the audience, and Curry, when asked a question about being a man. He said that being a man is about being a good person, someone who is responsible, reliable, hard-working and compassionate. Being a man, he said, is not about life as portrayed in some rap or hip-hop music. \u201cIf you are very confident about your sexuality, you don\u2019t have to have eight women around you twerking,\u201d he said to applause. \u201d\u2019Cause I\u2019ve got one woman who I\u2019m very happy with.

As such, hardly anybody knew initially about the demand. If anyone understands what Anthony Davis is thinking, asking for a trade out of New Orleans with nearly 1 1\/2 seasons left on his contract, it\u2019s Abdul-Jabbar. His trade request came with two years left on his contract in Milwaukee. Eventually, he got his wish in the summer that followed his ask and got traded to the Los Angeles Lakers . \u201cI think that the players have power because they have value,\u201d Abdul-Jabbar said. \u201cThe players that teams know that they can win with are going to be in a position to dictate what they want to do.\u201d And while few people would disagree with that, the fact that Davis\u2019 request went public \u2014 and the impact it had on the both the Pelicans and the Lakers, the team that appeared to go after the six-time All-Star the hardest before the trade deadline came and went earlier this month without a move being consummated \u2014 did not sit well with a number of the league\u2019s former players at All-Star weekend. And it isn\u2019t about the money. Top players like Davis, who will likely get his trade request fulfilled this summer are going to be well compensated one way or the other. But some think he might have been better served keeping it quiet until then. \u201cI just think it\u2019s a situation where they needed to keep it in house,\u201d Hall of Fame guard Rick Barry said. \u201cJust talk to the owners. Talk amongst yourselves. Airing your dirty laundry and putting stuff out there \u2026 I just don\u2019t understand why you want to get into a situation like that that does nobody any good and can only cause problems.\u201d Like Abdul-Jabbar, and like Davis, Barry also forced a trade. Back in his ABA days, he made it known that when the Washington Caps were moving to Norfolk, Virginia, he wanted no part of playing there. So Barry got traded to the New York Nets, the entire trade \u201csaga\u201d lasting no more than a week or two and all done during an offseason. Davis asking in-season, Barry said, had a negative effect on both the Pelicans and the Lakers. \u201cDoing it a year before, I don\u2019t understand,\u201d Barry said. \u201cHopefully they won\u2019t continue doing it that far in advance.\u201d Actually, that is nothing new. Kyrie Irving had two years, plus an option year, left on his deal with Cleveland when he asked for a trade and eventually got moved to the Boston Celtics . Paul George had a year left when he told Indiana that he wanted out . Both of those requests went public, and it could be argued that the Cavaliers and Pacers were ailed, at least somewhat, by losing leverage since it was no secret the superstars wanted to be moved. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver doesn\u2019t like trade demands, especially ones that go public. When the NBA adopted its most recent collective bargaining agreement, Silver said the notion was that teams would have the option to extend player deals a year early to avoid being blindsided by requests by those players to leave. It hasn\u2019t worked that way, with Davis just being the latest example. \u201cThe law of unintended consequences,\u201d Silver said. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t worked precisely as we had planned.\u201d Irving had a title with the Cavaliers. Kawhi Leonard had a championship with San Antonio when he asked to be moved , and ultimately got his way . George still doesn\u2019t have a championship, though flirted with one plenty of times when he was in Indiana only to be thwarted on annual basis by the Miami Heat. Davis doesn\u2019t have one. He hasn\u2019t been close. New Orleans went to the Western Conference semifinals last year, a great sign of progress. This year the Pelicans have plummeted back toward the bottom of the Western Conference. And Davis realizes that his window for winning and being elite won\u2019t last forever, so mindful of his legacy he wants to be moved. The great players are rich and going to be rich no matter where they play. The ring is also very much the thing, and Davis knows helping lead a team to a championship is vital to how he will be remembered. \u201cI just want to win,\u201d Davis said at All-Star weekend. The Pelicans haven\u2019t done enough of it, and this year was the wrong time for their winning percentage to fall off a cliff. So Davis made the ask, and Hall of Famer Dave Cowens said that\u2019s fine \u2014 as long as he accepts whatever comes next, whether it\u2019s good or bad. \u201cIf a player wants to usurp or influence a decision on personnel, then the accountability for that move if it doesn\u2019t work out, that\u2019s what it\u2019s about,\u201d Cowens said. \u201cYou can\u2019t have union and management doing the same things. \u2026 To me, it starts with the accountability. That\u2019s the biggest thing.\u201d Abdul-Jabbar said he understands why Davis\u2019 trade request is getting so much attention. It\u2019s because Davis \u2014 averaging 28 points and 13 rebounds this season \u2014 is worth it. \u201cThat\u2019s always going to be the case,\u201d Abdul-Jabbar said. \u201cThe most talented people out there in the job market are going to get the most attention.\u201d"},{"id":35463,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/powerrankings-2018-19-week-19","date":"2019-02-19","title":"Power Rankings, Week 19: Urgency rises for Lakers, others after All-Star break","content":" After an entertaining NBA All-Star 2019 in Charlotte and at least seven days off for all 30 teams, the season (which is already 70 percent complete) tips off again on Thursday, with much to be resolved in the next seven weeks. In the Eastern Conference, the final three playoff spots remain up for grabs, though the competition is a little more inspiring up top, where the Boston Celtics and Philadelphia 76ers \u2014 currently tied fourth and fifth \u2014 would surely like to improve their position. The Eastern Conference arms race heated up at the trade deadline and what happens in the next four months will surely help determine what a lot of big-name free agents decide to do in July. Who might face the Golden State Warriors in the Western Conference finals is as interesting a question as who will represent the East in The Finals. It\u2019s a wide-open race behind the champs, with the Denver Nuggets holding onto second place and the Oklahoma City Thunder looking like the safest pick to win a couple of playoff rounds. Before we get to the postseason though, there\u2019s a fascinating race for the last two playoff spots in the West, with the San Antonio Spurs\u2019 21-year playoff streak, LeBron James\u2019 13-year streak, the Los Angeles Lakers\u2019 five-year playoff drought and the Sacramento Kings\u2019 12-year drought all on the line. And there\u2019s the season-of-transition LA Clippers still holding onto eighth, too. Every game counts and the urgency is about to intensify.

The last time James Harden scored fewer than 30 points, the Rockets were sitting at 12-14 and No. 14 in the Western Conference . The next game, Harden dropped 50 on the Lakers in a victory. Then he had 32 in the next game and 47 after that \u2026 and then 30-plus again and again until he stood alone with Wilt Chamberlain, who had previously owned the four-longest streaks. As we exit the All-Star break, Harden and Chamberlain are tied for second at 31 games ; Houston plays the Lakers on Thursday ( 10:30 ET, TNT ). Harden ran out of real estate this season on a chance to tie the all-time record \u2013 Wilt reached 65 straight in 1961-62 \u2013 but he stands to finish with the single-highest scoring average the league\u2019s seen since Michael Jordan\u2019s 37.1 ppg in 1986-87 . Harden also managed to find a widely lampooned boundary for the outer reaches of his patented step-back jumper: We all realized Giannis Antetokounmpo had made a jump last season, and that the Milwaukee Bucks, under new coach Mike Budenholzer, could be among the Eastern Conference contenders \u2014 especially with LeBron James moving out West . What maybe we didn\u2019t count on was Antetokounmpo taking it up another notch as Budenholzer and GM Jon Horst surrounded him with shooting, shooting and more shooting as they gave him full reign over the offense. Antetokounmpo has averaged an astounding 27.2 points (58.1 field goal percentage), 12.7 rebounds, six assists, 1.4 steals and 1.4 blocks per game. The Bucks are an NBA best 43-14 at the break, and Antetokounmpo is the current Kia MVP favorite . Also, he does things like this: The Toronto Raptors made a bold move before the season , sending DeMar DeRozan \u2014 the homegrown face of Toronto\u2019s franchise revival \u2014 to the San Antonio Spurs in a package that returned impending free-agent Kawhi Leonard, who played only nine games last season while dealing with a quad injury. While he and the team have been cautious about back-to-backs and the overall \u201cload management\u201d, if you thought Kawhi wasn\u2019t still the player who turned back LeBron to win Finals MVP in 2014 before consecutive Defensive Player of the Year campaigns, well \u2026 Leonard is averaging 27.0 points (49.2 field goal percentage, 36.3 3-point percentage), 7.7 rebounds, 3.3 assists and 1.9 steals and has led Toronto \u2014 with a big supporting nod to breakout starter Pascal Siakam \u2014 to the second-best record in the league, just two losses back of leader Milwaukee. Another season, another triple-double average for Oklahoma City star Russell Westbrook. And this time, it\u2019s not close: Westbrook, despite struggling to keep his shot north of 40 percent from the field, 25 percent from 3-point range and 65 percent from the line, is averaging 21.7 points, 11.2 rebounds and 11.2 assists per game. And he\u2019s done it while essentially deferring to Paul George as the team\u2019s No. 1 option \u2014 his usage rate (the percentage of his team\u2019s possessions used) is at its lowest mark since his second season. He has literally entered unprecedented territory, both with this third full season of statistical prowess and the still ongoing streak of 11 games with a triple-double . The previous record \u2014 held, of course, by Chamberlain \u2014 was 10. Russ had threatened several times in recent years, stringing together runs as long as seven games. He\u2019s rocking out, indeed: On no one\u2019s timetable but their own, the Sacramento Kings made a collective leap out of the NBA dungeon to put the league\u2019s longest-running playoff drought in danger. Bolstered by the backcourt duo of speedy De\u2019Aaron Fox and sharpshooting Buddy Hield, the Kings have risen to 30-27, good for ninth in the super-competitive West \u2014 just four games back of No. 4 Portland. They added Harrison Barnes for the stretch run, and should be primed for more fun moments like this Bogdan Bogdanovic buzzer-beater: Here are some mini-records: 10-10, 15-5, 12-6. All the Celtics! They\u2019re clearly one of the better teams in the East when everything\u2019s firing \u2026 but Gordon Hayward hasn\u2019t looked quite right all season, they keep dropping bad losses between the winning streaks. And, every so often, someone seems to pop off about leadership or commitment or fun or some other aspect of \u201cThis is off and we can\u2019t quite nail it down.\u201d Heck, Kyrie Irving even called LeBron to apologize for being a knucklehead in Cleveland after realizing he was running into similar situations, now from the other perspective, with the Celtics\u2019 young core. If the league\u2019s most famous beef this side of Joel Embiid-Russell Westbrook can find resolution, anything\u2019s possible. Either way, maybe not quite the time to be super confident as a fan of one of the other East contenders until you see the four Ls this spring. You might have heard Jimmy Butler made a trade request this summer while heading into this contract year that he started with the Minnesota Timberwolves. If you missed that, you probably heard about the practice. Oh, that practice . Butler showed up for the first time in months, reportedly ran the other starters off the floor while playing with all-reserve teammates and, ah \u2026 was maybe not quiet about it. Four weeks later, he was headed to the Philadelphia 76ers with Justin Patton for Robert Covington, Dario Saric, Jerryd Bayless and a 2022 second-round pick. Butler promptly hit a pair of game-winners and reportedly stirred the system drink as he attempted to (what\u2019s the opposite of ease?) impose his way in. Butler\u2019s impending free agency \u2014 for all the chatter about the Sixers\u2019 long-term plans with this \u201cBig 4\u201d \u2014 is going to be wild interesting. Out here playing pop-a-shot: We all love Stephen Curry around these parts, and have much respect for how this greatest-of-all-time shooter has changed the game. But that this water-slide wipeout didn\u2019t make Shaqtin\u2019 A Fool is tragedy: A rare humbling moment for the three-time champ. Not expecting many more this year, ha. John Wall had season-ending surgery on his heel. Then slipped at home and ruptured his Achilles\u2019 tendon . Dwight Howard has been out with gluteal soreness (12 games) and then lower-back surgery (35 games). Le sigh. But they\u2019re still only three games out! And Bradley Beal is an All-Star ! [ Deep breath ] The Pelicans kept Anthony Davis . Tobias Harris is in Philly . Marc Gasol\u2019s a Raptor . Mike Conley Jr. is still in Memphis . Nikola Mirotic will further space the floor in Milwaukee . Markelle Fultz gets a fresh start in Orlando . The Wizards broke it up. Harrison Barnes takes his talents to Sacto. Kristaps Porzingis will return from his ACL injury a Maverick. The Knicks are set for two max slots. So are the Clippers. The Nets will have one. The Lakers, too. The Mavs. And others. Houston picked up Iman Shumpert , avoided the tax. The Celtics stood pat. Phew. And that was only the key deals. Some takeaways: But best believe they\u2019re not going to be the only ones chasing the potential of that 25-year-old future MVP. If they hold the line on gutting the team, can they come up with an alternative route that\u2019s anywhere close to as attractive? Stay tuned. Nineteen-year-old Luka Doncic entered the 2018 draft with a fair amount of hype , expected to be drafted top five, and then selected No. 3 by the Hawks . Minutes later, the Slovenian swingman was swapped to Dallas for No. 5 selection Trae Young and a protected 2019 first-round pick (likely to convey as it\u2019s top-five protected and Dallas sit eighth-worst). After a middling 10-point debut in Phoenix, Doncic rebounded to drop 26 points, six rebounds and three assists on the Timberwolves. Then truly began the breakout with a 31-point, eight-rebound, four-assist performance against the San Antonio Spurs on October 29 . He\u2019s led the Kia Rookie Ladder from the jump . And the hits \u2026 keep \u2026 coming. He\u2019s gone from showcasing one of the league\u2019s most vicious stepback 3s to developing into one of the top 10 closers \u2014 he ranks ninth with 88 field goals in clutch moments , shooting 30-of-60 \u2014 to sometimes combining both at once : He\u2019s also the second teenager to record a triple-double, and the first player to do it twice . For what it\u2019s worth, Young is actually coming along pretty well for Atlanta, who could be looking at a pair of Top-10 picks come June. But still. For all the hullabaloo out in Minnesota, Derrick Rose has quietly crafted a new path forward in a career that seemed to have stalled out after several debilitating knee injuries checked the league\u2019s youngest Kia MVP . Averaging 18.2 points and 4.8 assists (mostly off the bench), Rose has reinvented his game and is shooting a career-best 40.2 percent on 3-pointers . The highlight, without question, was a 50-point explosion on Halloween \u2014 a crucial career-high that Rose didn\u2019t seem ready to process. Out West, the unquestioned surprise at the top of the standings is the Denver Nuggets rising from a one-game playoff miss last season to a 39-18 mark, just two games behind the defending-champion Warriors. It\u2019s a total team effort \u2014 11 players average at least 18 minutes; nine, at least 8 ppg \u2014 that centers (literally) on the unique skillset of Nikola Jokic, the 7-foot fulcrum of their attack. In this fourth season of steady progression, the All-Star Jokic has boosted his season stats to 20.4 points, 10.6 rebounds and 7.7 assists per game. Yes, you read that correctly: A center  currently ranks fifth in the league in assists. He does it with handoffs and no-looks and baseball passes and \u2026 167 inches of high pick-and-roll action: Yup. A thing that happened. Almost as surprising as the Nets being good! The culture turned the corner this season, finally shedding the shadow of the infamous 2013 pick-packaging exchange with the Celtics , one that ultimately cost them the 2017 No. 1 overall pick. They started the year 8-18, but beat the Raptors in overtime on December 7 , ripped off seven straight wins and have been rolling since. They\u2019ve elevated all the way to 30-27, good for sixth in the East , a lot closer to the clear top five than the five teams chasing them for playoff position. Most surprisingly, they\u2019ve done it through injury adversity all the while. Caris LeVert opened the season on an absolute tear \u2014 averaging 19.0 points on 47.9 percent shooting, along with 4.2 rebounds and 3.4 assists in his first 13 games \u2014 before a scary dislocated foot took him out of the action for nearly three months . Spencer Dinwidde, by now a proven killer off the bench, was perhaps the leading candidate for Kia Sixth Man of the Year. He was averaging 17.2 ppg through 49 games \u2026 and then tore ligaments in his thumb that eventually required surgery. D\u2019Angelo Russell has stepped up as well, earning an All-Star nod with all those arcing 3s. He\u2019s finally looking like the floor leader everyone thought he could develop into as the No. 2 pick in 2015 . Rookie Rodions Kurucs, elbows akimbo, has crashed into the hearts of Brooklyn fans. In addition, DeMarre Carroll is having a mid-career momentum boost as the veteran leader. Also, Jarrett Allen blocks everybody . Even LeBron. Enjoy."},{"id":35457,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/state-west-contenders-second-half-2018-19","date":"2019-02-19","title":"Which teams can contend with Warriors in West?","content":" Before we survey and project the developing playoff situation in the Western Conference and its top five teams, let us begin by quoting the great philosopher and trash talker Larry Joseph Bird, upon meeting his fellow 3-point contestants in 1988 : \u201cWhich one of you is coming in second?\u201d Because the one element that appears to be missing from this picture, aside from the Phoenix Suns, is suspense at the top of the West. That\u2019s where once again we find the Golden State Warriors, owners of the last four conference banners, fully equipped to bring the heat in springtime again and make it five straight. > The East:  Five teams to watch come playoff time The issue, then, isn\u2019t whether the Warriors are monopolizing things. It\u2019s more about determining the identity of a potential Warriors slayer and the chances of such a team causing a seismic quake of an upset. * * * The discussion starts curiously enough with a team that didn\u2019t even make the playoffs last season. Losing on the final night of the 2017-18 season has served as a motivational face-slap for the Nuggets. They have seared through 2018-19 ever since, residing either at or near the penthouse in the West and desperately wanting to be taken seriously. For a team with a youthful core lacking in playoff experience, the Nuggets bring the swagger of a been-there, done-that contender and show plenty of staying power. They are a West-best 25-4 at home, but one of those rare losses came in a 31-point spanking the Warriors delivered on Jan. 15 that humbled the Nuggets at least temporarily. The Warriors did not, to paraphrase Nuggets coach Mike Malone, take that L on the way out the door. However, Denver still brings plenty to the table. They have more depth with the return of Isaiah Thomas, an All-Star center (Nikola Jokic) who runs the offense, a rising star in Jamal Murray and a drastically improved defense. Most importantly, they bring a sense that they belong in the mix. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to give (respect) to us, so what, man? We don\u2019t care,\u201d Malone said. \u201c We \u2018re going to create our own respect. We\u2019re going to do what we do, and ultimately teams will take notice, people will take notice. I think you\u2019re starting to see that more and more.\u201d Jokic poses unique problems for the opposition. He\u2019s a quirky center, comfortable on the perimeter, where he\u2019s clever with back-door passes and is a semi-decent 3-point shooter (30.8 percent). He leads the NBA in post ups and uses his wide body to score in those situations, ranking third in post-up points . With the reduction of quality big men in the NBA, Jokic doesn\u2019t have a peer in terms of all-around skills \u2014 he\u2019s a triple-double threat \u2014 and the only West center with the defensive chops to make him work up a sweat is perhaps the Utah Jazz\u2019s Rudy Gobert. \u201cHe\u2019s got tricks, man,\u201d Oklahoma City Thunder guard Paul George said. \u201cIt goes with his nickname, the Joker. He keeps you on your toes and puts on a show every night he\u2019s out there.\u201d The Nuggets\u2019 flaw is experience and maybe top-shelf mental toughness. They\u2019re 14-14 on the road and only have Thomas and Paul Millsap as their most playoff-tested players. Overall, they\u2019ve never been thrown into the playoff fire. That\u2019s a significant disadvantage to take on against Golden State, especially if it should secure home-court advantage in a series. Houston is the wildest of wild cards. They were the Warriors\u2019 biggest threat last season, pushing them to (and falling in) Game 7 of the 2018 West finals . The Rockets began this season coping with key injuries and not so successfully at that, starting off 11-14, but have righted the ship since then. Chris Paul is back after missing 23 games and Clint Capela is scheduled to return from a thumb injury sometime this week. Plus, the Rockets added Kenneth Faried and Iman Shumpert in mid-season deals to bring more experience and depth. Of course, there\u2019s James Harden, who almost single-handedly lifted the Rockets during their injuries. The reigning Kia MVP has scored 30 or more points in 31 straight games to thrust himself back into the MVP conversation . But all that burn can wear on a player as the calendar flips from April to May. Will Harden still bring heavy minutes and big shots come May and June? And if not, will Paul\u2019s body \u2014 which betrayed him in the 2018 West finals \u2014 hold up to provide necessary support? \u201cI\u2019m just excited for the second half of the season, getting a full, healthy roster and taking it from there,\u201d Harden said. \u201cWe really haven\u2019t hit our stride yet as a team.\u201d As a contender, Oklahoma City is another strange one. They sport a virtually unchanged roster from last season\u2019s first-round loss to the Jazz , when George was 2-for-16 in the Game 6 ouster . OKC has since collected itself and so has George, 28, who finds himself a serious MVP contender as he enjoys a career season. Much has been made \u2014 and rightly so \u2014 about how Russell Westbrook has altered his game to benefit George. Here\u2019s Kevin Durant, of all people, on that dynamic: \u201cI think Paul is just going out there and playing free and understanding what his role is as a go-to scorer for the Thunder,\u201d Durant said. \u201cI think him and Russ have got some nice synergy out there along with their teammates. So, you\u2019re just starting to see him shine bright. I think he\u2019s always showed this stuff, but I think he has more opportunities to do so.\u201d Westbrook is averaging a triple-double yet again and has logged an NBA-record 11 straight triple-doubles (and counting). George has become OKC\u2019s savior in clutch moments, ranking seventh in total clutch points . This 1-2 punch is propelling the Thunder up the standings in the West, which makes their determining factor the help. Can Steven Adams, Jerami Grant and assorted others provide the proper mix of aid for OKC to make the Warriors notice? \u201cWe got a lot on this team right now,\u201d George said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what\u2019s missing. Yes, we\u2019re not in The Finals and we\u2019re not in the playoffs yet. But what we\u2019ve got is enough. Me and Russ can shoulder it and we\u2019ve got enough support around us.\u201d There are plenty of imperfections among the rest of the field \u2014 the San Antonio Spurs, Los Angeles Lakers and the can-you-believe-it Sacramento Kings \u2014 but maybe the Jazz are better built for the postseason than any of them. Utah has two arguments in its favor: Defense and Donovan (Mitchell). That should be enough for the Jazz to again reach the semifinals and, if things break their way, the conference finals. Mitchell wasn\u2019t an All-Star in 2018-19, but will be someday. And he can get a jump on that support with another strong postseason. He\u2019s certainly capable of that, although after the first few months of the season, you had to wonder. He struggled with his shot and his command late in games. In addition, Utah was hurt by a difficult early schedule and didn\u2019t rise above .500 for good until Jan. 11. The good news for Utah is the schedule lightened up and Mitchell toughened up. His efficiency rate improved and his reliability returned, although opposing defenses are forcing him into attacking double teams or giving up the ball. They\u2019re wiser now and the Jazz still haven\u2019t found a solid secondary scorer. Gobert is their No. 2 scorer but he\u2019s more of a clean-up player who doesn\u2019t take volume shots. The Jazz aim to win with defense and intelligence. With Gobert among the league leaders in blocks and the Utah\u2019s defense back on track, the Jazz rank No. 4 in Defensive Rating (105.4 points per 100 possessions) . * * * To summarize, which of these four stands the best chance to come in second? Since anything\u2019s possible, we must rate the odds of one of them actually beating the Warriors. That puts the Nuggets and Rockets fairly even in that department, followed by the Thunder and Jazz. But make no mistake, for obvious reasons, there\u2019s an oceanic gap between that pack and the champs.  \u201cEvery year is a new challenge and different circumstances,\u201d Warriors star Stephen Curry said. \u201cBut make no mistake, we are motivated. We understand what\u2019s at stake.\u201d Three straight championships hasn\u2019t happened since the Shaquille O\u2019Neal-Kobe Bryant-led Lakers of the early 2000s . Four in five years is the stuff of legends, and so the Warriors are seeking a chance to reside with other legendary teams. Besides, with free agency beckoning this summer, there\u2019s no guarantee the fun times will continue much longer. Other than Draymond Green and Durant\u2019s dust-up and Curry\u2019s 11-game injury absence , Golden State has had few hiccups this season. Everyone on social media had fun with the former, until reality returned and the Warriors reclaimed their place in the NBA (for the regular season anyway). They\u2019re healthy now and, on some nights, look legendary. They have room to grow, with DeMarcus Cousins still getting his bearings. It\u2019s all good for the Warriors right now, and absent some unforeseen setback, how can they come up short for another Finals trip? You can argue that, with Cousins aboard, this is the strongest Warriors team in the Steve Kerr era. A championship must bear that out. Remember, the Warriors won an NBA-record 73 games in 2015-16 \u2026 only to become the first team to blow a 3-1 Finals lead . That ruined any argument of them delivering the greatest season in league history. One thing\u2019s for sure: Golden State isn\u2019t having sleepless nights over any team fighting for the right to deny them. \u201cBeing able to hoist that trophy at the end of the season, you can\u2019t put into words how much that means,\u201d said Warriors guard Klay Thompson. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter who\u2019s standing across from us.\u201d * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

But before we do that, we must look back at some of the best moments from NBA All-Star 2019 . * * * The man who was the toast of the town was tough to spot for much of the weekend. That\u2019s what made Charlotte Hornets owner Michael Jordan\u2019s surprise appearance at Sunday\u2019s legends brunch on the morning of his 56th birthday such a pleasant surprise. Well done, MJ. And Charlotte put on a fine show with the eyes of the world watching for the 68th Alll-Star Game. Sonya Curry\u2019s underhanded halfcourt shot at the Curry Family Foundation event Friday was the first viral clip from All-Star weekend. She upstaged her sons Steph and Seth and her husband, Dell, with that shot \u2013 all while making it clear who the real star of the (unofficial) Curry Family Reunion weekend would be. But the entire family was celebrated all weekend as Charlotte\u2019s first family of basketball played the role of gracious hosts.  New Orleans Pelicans big man Anthony Davis played just four first half minutes in Sunday\u2019s All-Star Game, slowed by a sore shoulder. That said, he still certainly got everything done he needed to. He let it all out during Saturday morning\u2019s media day festivities . After being the talk of the league in the 10 days leading up to the Feb. 7 trade deadline \u2013 which came days after his trade request was made public \u2014 Davis cleared the air about \u2026 basically everything. Yes, he intends to continue playing for the Pelicans this season (we\u2019ll see how long that lasts). And, no, he has not eliminated any of the league\u2019s other 29 teams from the list of places he\u2019d consider playing for in the future (a list that does include the Boston Celtics). Where the drama goes from here is anyone\u2019s guess. It\u2019s your move Danny Ferry, who replaced the fired Dell Demps on Friday as the Pelicans\u2019 interim general manager. Between Meek Mill\u2019s splendid work during the player introductions for Sunday\u2019s game to Fayetteville, N.C.\u2019s own J. Cole bringing the house down with his halftime show, there would be no Maroon 5 Super Bowl controversy for this NBA All-Star weekend. It pays to know your audience and what will resonate.   Were you underwhelmed by the AT&T Slam Dunk contest ? That\u2019s fine. But take another look at Oklahoma City Thunder rookie Hamidou Diallo\u2019s work to win the title. Young fella was a worthy champion. Go ahead, check the vertical, the creativity and calling out Shaq was a stroke of genius. Say hello to Lil\u2019 Superman folks! Dirk Nowitzki and Dwyane Wade will be linked forever , having battled twice in The Finals during their surefire Hall of Fame careers. Since they split  those meetings it\u2019s only fitting that these two living legends went out together in their final All-Star Game appearance. And they didn\u2019t disappoint. Dirk knocked down three deep 3-pointers for Team Giannis before halftime. Wade drained a 3-pointer of his own for Team LeBron before halftime. And he started the second half as Team LeBron rallied from a 13-point first-half deficit to take the lead at the end of the third quarter. Salute to two of the game\u2019s all-time greats. Stephen Curry\u2019s bounce pass. Giannis Antetokounmpo\u2019s head-at-the-rim-finish . Kevin Durant\u2019s reaction after being the victim of the dunk of the first half and perhaps the entire weekend. What was there not to love about a dunk that will forever be a part of All-Star Game lore? One of the most fascinating events during All-Star weekend every year is the Technology Summit, where the focus is on about basketball\u2019s future and the role of evolving technology. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver kicked things off Saturday morning by using an app on a phone to change the number and name on the back of a jersey, flipping it from a Kemba Walker model to a Stephen Curry model to a Michael Jordan model.  Kevin Durant ended up stealing the show in a game dominated early by Team Giannis (and its namesake in particular). Antetokounmpo was certainly spectacular, finishing with a game-high 38 points . KD\u2019s late-game work, however, proved critical as Team LeBron rallied from a 20-point deficit. He earned his second All-Star MVP trophy to go along with the one he bagged in 2012 . * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

The league\u2019s All-Stars gathered Sunday in Charlotte, N.C ., to put on a show at the Spectrum Center, only to see members of the two-time defending champions become the ringleaders once again. There was Steph Curry, raised in Charlotte and anxious to impress the old neighborhood, making the two prettiest bounce passes of the night, one to Giannis Antetokounmpo and one to \u2026 himself . There was Klay Thompson, wearing a different uniform than Curry for the first time in their careers. He was trying hard to bring trash-talking rights back to Oakland and came close to making a down payment. And there was Kevin Durant. He\u2019s the real MVP. All told, the 68th All-Star Game had some cold stretches and needed to be rescued, and \u2014 wouldn\u2019t you know \u2014 three members of the most decorated team this decade did what they do. It was super for entertainment value and dreadful for championship hopes held by anyone with ideas of tripping the Warriors come spring and summertime. At least the weekend wasn\u2019t a total Warriors romp: Curry did lose the MTN DEW 3-Point Contest to Joe Harris of the Brooklyn Nets. The All-Star weekend was a few years late coming to Charlotte, originally scheduled for 2017 prior to a politically charged delay , and the league hustled to do right by the city and also Michael Jordan, owner of the Hornets. The showcase gave the NBA some temporarily (and much-needed) relief from competition, not only the first two-thirds of the regular season, but also from the Anthony Davis sweepstakes . The centerpiece of the weekend was the game itself, and let the record show all of social media and the Los Angeles Lakers that LeBron James is indeed capable of picking players that can help him win. There was some question about that over the last few dramatic weeks. LeBron captained his team, perhaps notably containing four stars who\u2019ll become free agents this summer, to a 178-164 win over Team Giannis. The game was unique in that it contained 13 players on each squad instead of the usual 12. That\u2019s because Adam Silver used his commissioner\u2019s power to add two legends, Dwyane Wade and Dirk Nowitzki \u2014 one of whom is definitely retiring (Wade) and the other is expected to, but hasn\u2019t made anything official yet. When Team LeBron coach Mike Budenholzer sent Nowitzki to the scorer\u2019s table to check in, Mike Malone, not to be outcoached, immediately signaled for Wade. It was a staged photo-and-applause op and it worked; Wade and Dirk received standing ovations from the Spectrum Center as they jointly walked on the floor for the final time as All-Stars. What happened next was pure: Dirk hit his first three shots, all 3-pointers, as his teammates rose from the bench and celebrated each one. \u201cI just wanted to play a few minutes and hoist up a 3,\u201d he said. \u201cThe first shot I figured, \u2018Hey, last time on stage, I\u2019m going to go for it,\u2019 and it went in. The second one, I said, \u2018I\u2019ll get a little deeper,\u2019 and it went in. The third, I wanted to see what happened and it went in too. It was a pleasure to compete one more time with these guys. A great weekend for me.\u201d Shortly thereafter, Wade connected with his BFF and former teammate LeBron on a few lob passes, reminiscent of their winning combinations on a pair of championships in Miami. \u201cLike I\u2019ve been saying the last couple of days, it\u2019s been a bittersweet moment for me and him,\u201d LeBron said. \u201cThe bitter part is obviously this being the last time on the same floor together and the memories we have as competitors and teammates. \u201cAnd then the sweet part of it is seeing him be able to go out on his own terms, saying when he\u2019s done and nobody forcing him out and or anything of that nature. He\u2019s able to hang it up when he wants to hang it up and be at peace with it.\u201d It was fun and fitting and the two future Hall of Famers were clearly affected and choked up, especially as they accepted framed All-Star jerseys during a brief ceremony prior to the fourth quarter. But make no mistake, this was more about the Warriors here at a critical checkpoint, flexing their talent for all to see and envy and ultimately respect. Thompson found himself in a playful one-upmanship with Curry and, well \u2026 Thompson came up short. He did drill a 3-pointer from the corner, while Curry, sitting nearby on the bench, yelled for a miss. But Curry dropped a deep 3-pointer while being hacked by Thompson, falling to the floor at the feet of rapper Quavo and then completing the 4-point play. \u201cIt was good to see Steph knock down that shot over Klay because Klay is always talking trash to him,\u201d said Durant. \u201cIt was fun to see. Those guys are always joking around and seeing who can make the most shots. Their chemistry together is second-to-none. So we know we\u2019re going to be talking about that play for the next two days.\u201d Durant snagged his second All-Star Game MVP, and first with the Warriors, by tallying 31 points, including some big buckets down the stretch. There isn\u2019t a major trophy Durant hasn\u2019t won: two Finals MVPs, two All-Star MVPs, a regular-season MVP, two NBA titles. His next might be another title this summer, and after that it\u2019s time for a new contract \u2026 somewhere. For Curry, the weekend was a dream. It was 27 years ago that he watched his first All-Star Weekend from the lap of his father, who was a 3-Point Contest participant in 1992. He came from humble basketball beginnings, a scrawny teenager who couldn\u2019t draw much interest from Division I schools, and then took nearby Davidson College to national prominence. The entire Curry family soaked it all in: Steph, Dell, brother Seth \u2014 who battled his brother in the 3-Point Contest \u2014 and the rest. Appearing in Charlotte for the All-Star Game served as a career highlight to be checked off a rather long and growing list for Curry. Feeling a bit pressured to perform, especially after being upset in the 3-Point Contest Finals, Curry unloaded with a pair of plays made for YouTube. On the break, he bounced the ball off the floor and high in the air, thereby qualifying as a lob pass, which was dunked by Giannis. \u201cI think that pass was going to Joel (Embiid) but I was able to sneak in there and make it look like a good pass to me,\u201d Giannis said. \u201cIt was a nice play.\u201d And then, with the clock ticking off the final seconds of Charlotte\u2019s basketball weekend, Curry bounced another pass high, grabbed it, twisted in the air, and dunked a reverse. \u201cAll y\u2019all saw me in LA a couple of weeks ago\u201d said Curry, making mention of his embarrassing slip and fall while attempting a fancy breakaway dunk against the Clippers. \u201cWell, I redeemed myself.\u201d With that, the game and weekend were wrapped for Charlotte, by a kid from Charlotte. Everybody go home. Everybody prepare for the season\u2019s last two months. And more of what\u2019s coming from the Warriors. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

Moments later, though, an unofficial hometown hero stepped from behind the curtain at the Charlotte Civic Center Sunday to send an even bigger buzz through the Legends Brunch crowd of an estimated 2,000 people. Michael Jordan, arguably the NBA\u2019s greatest player ever and owner of the Hornets since 2010, made a surprise cameo appearance to cap the annual All-Star celebration of the league\u2019s history and pioneers. \u201cI see a lot of old friends, a lot of old adversaries, some teammates,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cYou guys know today is my 56th birthday \u2014 I look young compared to a lot of you guys out there.\u201d Jordan typically keeps a low profile publicly. Even though All-Star Weekend had flushed him out a couple of times heading toward Sunday night\u2019s game, some of the organizers of the brunch weren\u2019t told he would be dropping by. But the event, presented by the National Basketball Retired Players Association, is one of the highlights of the weekend each year and was attended by nearly 200 former NBA players. Apparently, an old college teammate from the University of North Carolina Tar Heels convinced Jordan to be one of them. \u201cSam Perkins nagged me for about two months to be here,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cI\u2019m glad I chose to do this. It\u2019s great to see the energy that you [fans] provide to us, and to see the former players and the opportunity that you provided to me.\u201d In addition to Curry\u2019s award, three other Hornets were honored: Muggsy Bogues received the Community Ambassador Award, Alonzo Mourning was given the Global Ambassador Award and Glen Rice was named Hornets Legend of the Year. \u201cI\u2019m here just to congratulate the four guys who have done an unbelievable job for the city of Charlotte,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cI played against all four of those guys and they were true, true competitors. But the thing I love most about them \u2014 I\u2019ve had the chance to spend time with them \u2014 is what great people they are, and what they have done for the city. \u201cWhen I ask them to be a part of things, I don\u2019t get a \u2018no\u2019 from those guys.\u201d Hall of Famer Spencer Haywood, chairman of the NBRPA board, spoke during the program about the improved benefits the retired players have received in recent years, thanks to financial assistance from both the National Basketball Players Association and the NBA. Among them: A health care program for the league\u2019s alumni and an increase in their pension payments. Michele Roberts, executive director of the active players\u2019 union, praised the former players for building up the league in which today\u2019s participants thrive. So did Jordan. \u201cTo all the legends, you guys paved the road for all of us,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything that I\u2019ve done, I\u2019ve paid tribute to you guys. I\u2019m glad we were able to find some way that we were able to give things back.\u201d Current Hornets All-Star guard Kemba Walker presented Bogues with his award, appearing in the morning despite his starting spot in the evening\u2019s game. Hall of Famer and fellow Georgetown star Dikembe Mutombo introduced Mourning, and Mourning in turn presented Rice\u2019s award. Singer-songwriter Anthony Hamilton performed during the poignant \u201cIn Memoriam\u201d segment of the program, in which a slideshow of NBA figures who died since the previous Legends Brunch was projected on massive video screens. TNT studio host Ernie Johnson had the crowd laughing and wincing with another one of his comic, corny and annually anticipated poems. But comedian JB Smoove, who opened the entertainment, had the event\u2019s funniest line, ripped from recent headlines. Gushing in his memory of Magic Johnson\u2019s signature no-look passes \u2014 \u201cHe\u2019d look you in the eyes and that ball is gone before you know it\u201d \u2014 Smoove then warned players on the team over which Johnson now presides. \u201cSome of you Lakers better look out,\u201d Smoove said, \u201cfor the no-look trade.\u201d * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

The original photograph was taken in 1992 when Stephen sat courtside with his father Dell Curry, a former sharpshooter for the Charlotte Hornets who had also just participated in the 3-point contest. The event was held in Orlando that year. Dell was back in front of the Charlotte crowd to kick off the 2019 3-point contest with some of his old teammates. He and the former All-Stars didn\u2019t exactly light it up , but they raised $35,000 for charity. Once the official competition began, Dell watched as his sons Steph and Seth battled for the trophy. Seth scored 16 in the first round, while Steph dropped 23 in the final round but fell just short to contest winner Joe Harris.

Don\u2019t get it twisted, the NBA relishes the idea that it can dominate news cycles and sports chatter across 12 months. The idea that free agency, roster maneuvers, trade deadlines, buyout markets, summertime player development and even rumors and gossip can keep tongues wagging and ratings high has been widely embraced at league headquarters and by its member teams. But that doesn\u2019t mean all of its business should be conducted in the street. What the NBA, the New Orleans Pelicans, All-NBA center Anthony Davis, his agent Rich Paul and the Los Angeles Lakers have been embroiled in over the past three weeks would have been better handled \u201cbehind closed doors,\u201d the commissioner told reporters at Spectrum Center in the hour before State Farm All-Star Saturday Night. \u201cWhen they make a public spectacle of it,\u201d Silver said, \u201cI hear you in terms of the enormous media interest that comes from it. But that\u2019s not the kind of media interest we\u2019re looking for.\u201d Paul notified the Pelicans near the end of January that Davis would not sign a contract extension and preferred to be traded to a championship contender. He didn\u2019t just tell the Pelicans, though; he went public, less than two weeks before the Feb. 7 trade deadline. The league fined Davis $50,000 for violating a rule in the collective bargaining agreement prohibiting players or their representatives from making public trade demands. The plot was thick from the start because Paul\u2019s biggest client is LeBron James, giving the instant perception that James and the Lakers were trying to leverage Davis to them. From there, a series of nasty dominoes fell: Paul issued a list of four preferred destinations . Davis\u2019 father publicly tried to thwart Boston\u2019s interest. The Pelicans declined to cut a deal with L.A. \u2013 and got accused of intentionally trying to stir discord within the Lakers\u2019 locker room by allegedly leaking players\u2019 names. Once the deadline passed, the NBA reportedly reminded New Orleans that sitting out Davis \u2013 to protect its asset until the offseason by avoiding potential injury \u2013 was not an acceptable tactic, even as the team seems committed to losing for draft-lottery position. It all led to Friday, when Pelicans GM Dell Demps, who held the line against the Lakers\u2019 overtures, was fired . All of that is the sort of chaos, and headlines, the NBA would prefer to avoid. \u201cWhether it be a team or a player not meeting a contractual obligation,\u201d Silver said, \u201cthat\u2019s something you just don\u2019t want to see as a league.\u201d While Davis had 18 months left on his New Orleans contract before he could become a free agent, Silver noted that current CBA is structured to encourage players and their teams to address such stalemates a year in advance. In this case, it would have been fine for Davis and Paul to notify the Pelicans this summer that the All-Star would not re-sign in 2020, thereby giving the team time to probe trades in an orderly fashion. That\u2019s where the closed doors matter. Just in the past two years, Paul George, Kyrie Irving, Kawhi Leonard, Jimmy Butler, Davis and Kristaps Porzingis have gone public while under contract with trade requests, to varying levels of disruption to their teams. Silver acknowledged that teams can \u201cblindside\u201d players by abruptly trading them, such as occurred last season with Blake Griffin and DeMar DeRozan. But loyalty isn\u2019t the same thing as a guaranteed contract; no-trade clauses, while rare, can be negotiated. The NBA, under both Silver and his predecessor David Stern, has long been committed to player movement via free agency. But players forcing their way out, in a desire to land in destination markets for basketball or even outside business reasons, can affect the balance of power in the league and the ability of less popular markets to compete. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be overly defensive here because I don\u2019t want to defend a system that is \u2018smoothly operating,\u2019\u201d Silver said. \u201cI believe it\u2019s an area where we can do better. Something we have to sit down with the players\u2019 association. \u201cBut I\u2019m ultimately confident that these are not endemic problems with the league. To me, these are very fixable issues.\u201d Silver fielded questions on topics both related and unrelated to the recent trade demands\/tampering controversy, including: He said it\u2019s too soon to know if the league\u2019s changes to the draft-lottery \u2014 flattening the odds of landing the No. 1 pick to 14.0 percent each for the three losingest clubs \u2014 will have the desired effect of discouraging \u201ctanking.\u201d Four NBA teams entered the All-Star break on pace to win 20 games or fewer this season. Silver does not believe a race to the bottom is in either the league\u2019s or those teams\u2019 best interest. Especially when franchises do it for multiple years. \u201cI understand genuine rebuilding,\u201d he said. But the idea that, if you\u2019re going to be bad, you might as well be really bad? Said Silver: \u201cI believe, personally, that\u2019s corrosive for those organizations.\u201d As encouraging as the current standings might be \u2014 with teams in Milwaukee, Denver, Oklahoma City and Indiana thriving \u2014 Silver sees payroll issues as potentially undermining competitive balance. Some teams have more money to spend, others chose to spend to the point of unprofitability. He noted that the NBA has had seven different champions over the past 11 Finals, while the NFL \u2014 known for its parity \u2014 has seen New England play in nine of the past 18 Super Bowls. Asked about the Dallas Mavericks\u2019 front-office sexual harassment and discrimination scandal that grabbed headlines almost a year ago, Silver said the team\u2019s and the league\u2019s follow-up has generated results. \u201cWhat was reported to me and through the organization was that there was a complete sea change in culture on the business side of the Mavericks,\u201d he said. Silver recently traveled to Dallas and spoke with employees. The idea to invite aging legends Dirk Nowitzki and Dwyane Wade to the All-Star Game, adding a roster spot for each, came from a fan\u2019s e-mail, the commissioner said. Silver called the Currys \u2014 father Dell and sons Steph and Seth \u2014 the \u201cfirst family of Charlotte, at least this week.\u201d Dell Curry played for the Hornets, with All-Star Steph and fellow 3-point contestant Seth raised in the area. Silver provided background on the shift of Charlotte\u2019s All-Star Weekend from 2017 to 2019, the NBA\u2019s response to a political battle in North Carolina that critics said discriminated against members of the LGBTQ community. He credited Hornets owner Michael Jordan, team president Fred Whitfield and others with helping to get the controversial HB2 bill repealed and bringing together those on both sides to restore the game.

Here are some highlights gleaned by NBA.com writers. Truthfully and officially, Dirk Nowitzki hasn\u2019t announced that he\u2019s retiring after this season, but the Mavericks\u2019 legend is already appointing his successor in Dallas. \u201cHe\u2019s a guy who can get anything he wants almost whenever he wants,\u201d said Nowitzki. He\u2019s talking of course about Luka Doncic, the front-runner for Rookie of the Year who has already taken over the Mavericks as a player and also a building block. For anyone who thinks Doncic might remind Nowitzki of his younger self, Dirk rejects that notion. \u201cHe\u2019s so much, much more prepared and better than I ever was as a rookie,\u201d he said. Nowitzki\u2019s career actually began very humbly; he averaged only eight points and shot 40 percent, hardly the makings of a future all-time great. The next season he doubled that average, became the focal point and the rest was history. Doncic is at 20.7 points, 7.2 rebounds and 5.6 assists and plays three different positions on the floor for Dallas. At just 19 \u2014 he turns 20 in two weeks \u2014 he has taken the league by storm. \u201cWith Luka we didn\u2019t know what we were going to get but he has exceeded all of our expectations,\u201d said Nowitzki. \u201cHe\u2019s been unbelievable, a gamer. He wants the ball in his hands. He\u2019s a great playmaker for himself and for others, a big shot maker. He\u2019s been amazing and not even 20 years old.\u201d Nowitzki also has high hopes for Kristaps Porzingis, still on the mend from knee surgery last summer and a surprise pickup by Dallas in a midseason swap with the Knicks. \u201cThe Kristaps deal came out of nowhere,\u201d Nowitzki. \u201cWe were all kinda surprised by it, that the Knicks made him available. We\u2019re obviously hoping to pair those two together for the next decade-plus. They\u2019re both really young and amazing talents, franchise talents. We\u2019re hoping Kristaps gets healthy enough to make that happen as soon as possible.\u201d And as for Nowitzki, who was made a special addition to the All-Star roster along with the retiring Dwyane Wade by commissioner Adam Silver? \u201cWell, right now it\u2019s super emotional,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a kid who came from nowhere in Germany 20 years ago and now getting standing ovations in opposing arenas, I\u2019m humbled by it. This is something I\u2019ll never forget.\u201d \u2014 Shaun Powell When Giannis Antetokounmpo was toiling in an obscure Greek league as a teenager, he wasn\u2019t sure exactly where his basketball dreams were headed. He knew he had the talent and the drive. But the NBA? It was a world away from where he was then. That\u2019s what makes his rise from curiosity to MVP candidate (and perhaps frontrunner) all the more remarkable for the man living the dream. Last week he was picking sides with LeBron James, putting together the rosters for Team Giannis, in advance of Sunday\u2019s 68th All-Star Game. He\u2019s still pinching himself about the whirlwind nature of his rise, especially with the entire basketball world watching him go head-to-head with LeBron. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy,\u201d he said. \u201cBefore I came into the league, I was looking up to him. Right now I was in the locker room, and I was sharing a meal with Team Giannis. Like I\u2019m leading the All-Star team. You know, picking teams with LeBron James. If you told me that six years ago, I would never, never, never thought I would be in this position right now.\u201d With his Milwaukee Bucks in prime position atop the Eastern Conference standings at the break, Antetokounmpo hasn\u2019t had much time to reflect on things. But he does understand that the opportunity to maximize the possibilities is now. And he knows his journey will serve as an inspiration for future stars who might not be on the radar right now. It all goes back to his humble beginnings. \u201cYeah, if I had to go back to my roots,\u201d he said, \u201cwhat I remember is those who helped me and helped my family for me to be in this position. There was a lot of people during my way to the NBA, from the time I started basketball. That\u2019s one of the parts that I keep inside me, and always when I go out there, I\u2019m not just representing my family, I represent, first of all, the people that helped my family and helped me to be in this seat right here that I\u2019m sitting, and representing 13 million people also.\u201d Antetokounmpo also confirmed his intentions to play for Greece in the FIBA World Championships this summer. The 32-team tournament starts on Aug. 31 in China. \u2014 Sekou Smith The Curry brothers will have a lot on the line during tonight\u2019s MTN DEW 3-Point Challenge after they placed a family-themed bet on who will win. \u201cFamily is obviously big for us and our support. I kind of wanted to weave that into the bet,\u201d Stephen Curry said on Saturday. \u201cSo whoever loses has to pick up the tab for all the tickets any time we play against each other for the rest of our careers, which the stakes are high, considering how many people show up for our games.\u201d Seth Curry should have a solid shot against his older brother. The younger Curry ranks third in the NBA in 3-point percentage this season at a clip of 46.5 percent. But Stephen isn\u2019t far behind at 44.4 percent. \u201cI got to get the best of him tonight. I know he\u2019s very confident, though.\u201d \u2014 Jonathan Hartzell The celebration of Charlotte Hornets owner Michael Jordan has been robust with the All-Star festivities in the legendary icon\u2019s home state. Toss in the fact that Jordan is celebrating his 56th birthday (Sunday) this weekend, and it\u2019s no wonder players involved with the weekend were asked what sort of gift they\u2019d get MJ. \u201cWhat do you get the man who already has everything?\u201d said Hornets All-Star Kemba Waker. \u201cI figure he\u2019s good. He\u2019s probably got everything he needs.\u201d That was a sentiment shared by most of the stars at Saturday\u2019s practices for Team Giannis and Team Lebron. Nuggets center Nikola Jokic, however, had a different idea. When asked what birthday present he\u2019d select for Jordan he said, \u201ca horse.\u201d A horse? Why not a goat? \u201cNot a goat,\u201d he said \u2014 Sekou Smith LeBron James and Dwyane Wade have shared a special bond ever since they entered the league together in 2003. Now as Wade prepares for his final NBA All-Star game, James talked about how their brotherhood has become bigger than basketball. \u201cEvery moment, every bit of time I get with him this weekend is going to be always cherished,\u201d James said on Saturday. \u201cWe\u2019ve been together almost 17 years now, since we met at the Combine in Chicago in 2003. From that moment, we just knew we were going to be together for a long time, and it hasn\u2019t stopped.\u201d James and Wade teamed up to win two championships over four seasons with the Miami Heat from 2010-14. Last season, Wade played with James on the Cavaliers for 46 games before returning to the Heat. The pair will team up on the floor for a final time on Sunday night. \u201cTo be here, for me to be able to choose him to be part of Team LeBron, for him to be here this weekend, it\u2019s a bittersweet moment, obviously,\u201d James said. \u201cThe bitter part of it, that this is his last weekend being in All-Star Weekend and knowing that his journey is coming to an end as far as a basketball player. But the sweet moment is that we\u2019ve got so much more life to live together, and we will continue that.\u201d \u2014 Jonathan Hartzell The Beard begat the Narrative, which at this point in James Harden\u2019s season reads something like this: Harden is a remarkably prolific offensive player, with an array of moves, a deft shooting touch and the strength to create space where none existed. But the way he pounds the ball, dribbling and probing until deep into the shot clock, makes him a player whose games aren\u2019t that fun to watch and whose style might not attract teammates with talents and ambitions of their own. \u201cGo ask those guys how many of them would like to play with [Harden],\u201d NBA Hall of Famer Rick Barry said as All-Star Weekend started. In what by design is a sport in which all players are available to touch the basketball, Harden\u2019s Houston Rockets are a 1 + 4 proposition. The league\u2019s leading scorer (36.6 ppg) also leads in usage rate (40.3), an estimated percentage of a team\u2019s plays a player uses while on the floor. That\u2019s second-highest since the advanced stat started to be tracked in 1977-78, behind only Russell Westbrook\u2019s 41.65 two years ago. Harden came into the schedule break with an active string of consecutive 30-point games that stretches back 31 games now. He leads the NBA in free throw attempts, which means more plays end with the ball in his hands when whistled than anyone else\u2019s. And more than 300 of his league-high 561 field goals have come without assists, further evidence of limited ball movement. As former 3-point marksman turned TNT broadcaster Dennis Scott wondered, \u201cTo play with a guy who dribbles 40 times a possession and has more than 300 baskets that weren\u2019t assisted? That would be tough. \u201cThey\u2019re winning. Guys seem to be saying the right things. He and Chris Paul are doing the \u2018your turn, my turn\u2019 pick-and-roll. When you\u2019re winning, things always seem better. But as a shooter, you\u2019re thinking, \u2018How do I get my rhythm if I touch the ball once or twice a quarter?\u2019\u201d It said something about Harden\u2019s game and how it might mesh with other great players that, in the televised All-Star Draft between captains LeBron James and Giannis Antetokounmpo, Harden was picked seven of the eight available players. Kevin Durant, Steph Curry, Kyrie Irving, Joel Embiid, Kawhi Leonard and Paul George all were picked by James or Antetokounmpo before the reigning MVP\u2019s name came off the board. Members of Team LeBron will get their chance to play with Harden Sunday (if they haven\u2019t already had it) and weren\u2019t inclined to be critical. Team Giannis players and others could be a bit more frank when asked: How would you have to adjust your game if you played all season with Harden? \u201cIf that were the case, it would just be me playing off the ball,\u201d said Mike Conley, the Memphis point guard who came to town for Saturday\u2019s Taco Bell Skills Challenge. \u201cWe all know how effective he is with the ball, so I\u2019d have to learn how to be more effective just as a shooter or getting the ball from somebody else, as opposed to being the primary ball handler.\u201d Would Conley enjoy that change in role? \u201cI have no idea,\u201d he said, laughing. Said Detroit forward Blake Griffin, back at All-Star for the first time since 2014: \u201cI\u2019d probably just spot up in the corners, to be honest with you. He\u2019s one of the best players in the world, so you just adapt to the way he plays.\u201d Milwaukee\u2019s Khris Middleton already plays with a ball-centric teammate in Giannis Antetokounmpo, though the Greek Freak\u2019s usage rate (31.9) represents 20 percent less ball dominance than Harden. Contrary to the Rockets star\u2019s tempo, Antetokounmpo tends to attack the defense hard early in a possession, then find an open teammate on the perimeter. If the looks out there aren\u2019t good, he\u2019ll frequently get the ball back. Pondering potential adjustments, Middleton said: \u201cHopefully not many. But I see the way some of those guys go there and play. It\u2019s kind of just standing around, watching him and being ready to catch and shoot.\u201d \u2014 Steve Aschburner Former No. 2 pick D\u2019Angelo Russell was a bit of a disappointment through his first three seasons in the league. After two years with the Los Angeles Lakers, he was shipped to Brooklyn to make room for another No. 2 pick (Lonzo Ball) at the point guard position. Russell didn\u2019t make much of an impact in his first season with the Nets, in part because his missed 34 games to injury. But in his second season in Brooklyn, Russell has taken a real step forward. Averaging a career-high 30.1 minutes per game and registering a career-high usage rate of 29.7 percent , Russell has shot better and scored more efficiently than he ever has, while also registering a career-high assist-turnover ratio. The improvement has earned Russell a trip to the All-Star game and has helped the Nets rise from a rough three-year stretch (in which only the Phoenix Suns had a worse record) to sixth place in the Eastern Conference at the break. Joe Harris has benefited from the development of Russell, who has a team-high 94 assists to the man who ranks second in the league in 3-point percentage . For Harris, the difference in Russell this season is about being comfortable in Brooklyn and playing under Nets head coach Kenny Atkinson. \u201cWhen you\u2019re comfortable to that level, it just makes everything that much easier,\u201d Harris said. \u201cYou\u2019re seeing it in his game. He\u2019s not overthinking things. He\u2019s just playing. Things just flow much easier for him now, having that year under his belt with familiarity with Kenny, the system, all of that.\u201d \u2014 John Schuhmann Buddy Hield is having a breakout season for the surprisingly relevant Sacramento Kings, averaging 20.5 points and ranking fourth in the league in 3-point percentage at 44.9 percent. Hield was already one of the league\u2019s best catch-and-shoot guys. Last season, he shot 50.2 percent on catch-and-shoot threes, the best mark among 94 players who attempted at least 200. This year, Hield has made 47.3 percent of his catch-and-shoot 3-pointers, the third best mark among 99 players who have attempted at least 150 through Thursday. Where Hield has seen an improvement is in his shooting off the dribble. Last season, Hield shot 35.9 percent on 2.1 pull-up 3-point attempts per game, a mark which ranked 25th among 55 players who attempted at least 100 pull-up threes. This season, Hield has shot 40.3 percent on 2.6 pull-up 3-point attempts per game, and the only players who have shot better on at least 100 pull-up attempts are four All-Stars and Orlando\u2019s Terrence Ross. Being a 40-percent 3-point shooter off the dribble is what gets defenses to adjust their schemes. It can open other things up for both Hield and his teammates. It\u2019s obviously something that Hield has worked on, and he\u2019s also got more license to shoot quickly in the fast-paced offense that the Kings have been playing this season. Hield said that the way the Kings are running is playing to the strengths of him and his teammates. But he\u2019s not necessarily more comfortable shooting off the dribble than he was last season. \u201cYou know what?,\u201d he said, \u201cI just missed last year.\u201d And it really is a make-or-miss league. \u2014 John Schuhmann By tradition, an All-Star player from the host city\u2019s team has a good shot at claiming Most Valuable Player honors in Sunday\u2019s game. That means Hornets guard Kemba Walker might be ready for his close-up. Fifteen times in the 67 NBA All-Star Games \u2014 a success rate of 22.4 percent \u2014 a player performing on his home court has been named MVP. There\u2019s the built-in advantage of familiar surroundings, including the floor, the rims and shooting backgrounds. A diverse group of fans, while not necessarily from Charlotte in this case, still look for easy hooks when it\u2019s time to cheer. All-Star teammates often try to make the local guy look good, too. As for Walker, this will be his third consecutive All-Star appearance, so he should be past any jitters. And this time he\u2019s a starter, along with Giannis Antetokounmpo and four others on \u201cTeam Giannis.\u201d Walker, as you would have expected, was a popular target during media availability Saturday, with both the local media outlets and those seeking some local flavor. He did his duty as a goodwill ambassador for the city and the Hornets franchise, but he didn\u2019t buy into any premature MVP predictions. \u201cI\u2019m just going to go out there and have fun, man,\u201d Walker said. \u201cI know everybody expects me to go out there and steal the show. But I\u2019m just going to go out and have fun.\u201d Walker, 28, is averaging a career-best 24.9 points for Charlotte. He said that just being selected as a starter in Eastern Conference balloting was \u201ca very surreal moment,\u201d so he\u2019s not indulging any notions of being Sunday\u2019s star of stars. \u201cDo I have plans for the MVP? No,\u201d Walker said at Saturday\u2019s media session at Bojangles Coliseum. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what\u2019s going to happen. Somebody else might want to go out and win the MVP. But it\u2019s not about that. I\u2019m really just going to go out and enjoy myself and represent this city the right way.\u201d Just because Walker won\u2019t tout himself as an MVP favorite doesn\u2019t mean others can\u2019t. Several fellow All-Stars had glowing things to say about the former UConn guard. \u201cThe work that he puts in the offseason, you can see it every time the season starts,\u201d Miami Dwyane Wade told reporters. \u201cHe\u2019s hungry for greatness. I think a player like Kemba, similar to myself, [felt] the unknown of what the future will be, and once you got a little taste of it, he\u2019s like, \u2018Well, I could do all right.\u2019 Then you got a little bit more and a little bit more and you continue to understand, and you\u2019re like, \u2018Wait, I could be great.\u2019 \u201cHe\u2019s one of the toughest covers in the game. He\u2019s one of the best individual players from a standpoint of personality-wise in the game. So you\u2019re just happy for his success.\u201d Houston\u2019s James Harden, a top contender for the 2018-19 MVP, said of Walker: \u201cThe way he\u2019s so crafty, his ball-handling, his shot-making ability. \u2026 Definitely one of those guys that gets overlooked.\u201d D\u2019Angelo Russell, though a mere 22, echoed Harden\u2019s assessment of Walker. \u201cKemba has always been that shifty guy that was kind of unguardable at times. You\u2019ve seen him hit the three ball at a high clip as well. He\u2019s one of those guys that you can definitely depend on day in and day out to \u2026 give you 50 or whatever it may be.\u201d Walker scored 41 points in the Hornets\u2019 opening game this season against Milwaukee. A month later, he put up 60 points and 43 points in consecutive games against Philadelphia and Boston, so he has excelled against the best competition in the East. If he stars Sunday, he\u2019ll be doing it against the best competition in the world. Working against Walker\u2019s MVP chances, perhaps? The trend of host city All-Star MVPs has cooled, with only four players doing it in the past 26 years: Anthony Davis in New Orleans in 2017, Kobe Bryant in L.A. in 2011, Shaquille O\u2019Neal (as co-MVP with Bryant) in Phoenix in 2009 and O\u2019Neal in L.A. in 2004. Also, betting odds out of Las Vegas favor Team LeBron to win the game by 5.5 points. And while Antetokounmpo is listed as a slight favorite over James for the MVP trophy, Walker and the Greek Freak both would have to buck a trend if the game\u2019s line is accurate. There hasn\u2019t been an All-Star MVP from the losing team since 1977, when Julius Erving won the award after the East\u2019s defeat in Milwaukee. \u2014 Steve Aschburner"},{"id":35428,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nba-fiba-announce-pro-league-africa","date":"2019-02-16","title":"NBA, FIBA announce plans for pro league in Africa","content":" CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) \u2014 The NBA is bringing a pro league to Africa. The Basketball Africa League, a new collaboration between the NBA and the sport\u2019s global governing body FIBA, was announced Saturday. The initial plan is for the 12-team league to begin play in January, and former President Barack Obama is among those who are expected to have direct involvement with the league\u2019s operations. It\u2019s yet to be determined which existing club teams will be part of the league. Qualification tournaments will be held later this year to determine those clubs, with teams from Angola, Egypt, Kenya, Morocco, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, South Africa and Tunisia expected to be among those taking part. No nation will have more than two teams in the league. \u201cAs we\u2019ve been talking about this concept over the last several months, there\u2019s been a tremendous reception from several of our NBA team owners,\u201d Silver said. \u201cSeveral of our partners have also expressed an interest to work with us in Africa.\u201d Silver said Pepsi and Nike\u2019s Jordan Brand are among the partners who have reached out to the NBA and said they want to be part of the Africa league. Silver also said that Obama \u2014 an enormous basketball fan \u2014 has told him he wants to have a direct role in the league, the specifics of which have yet to be determined. \u201cThere\u2019s been a fantastic reception,\u201d Silver said. Obama spoke on a video that was shown during the event where Silver announced the league. \u201cThrough sport, if you put in effort, you will be rewarded,\u201d Obama said. The NBA and FIBA\u2019s involvement will include financial support and resources toward continued growing of the game on the continent, as well as providing training for players, coaches and referees and some infrastructure for the new league. Silver said there are more than 400 companies in Africa that generate more than $1 billion annually, but that sport there has not seen the same growth \u2014 yet. \u201cAfrica has a huge economic engine,\u201d Silver said. The NBA has held three games in Africa since 2015, all of them selling out \u2014 two games in Johannesburg, the other in Pretoria. Many of the league\u2019s current players and coaches, along with several legends and Hall of Famers, have been part of those trips. \u201cI went with them last year,\u201d Basketball Hall of Famer Kareem Abdul-Jabbar said. \u201cThe NBA reaches out across the world.\u201d The league has an office in South Africa, has helped create 87 learn-and-play facilities in seven African nations, and 13 players who were born in Africa on opening-night NBA rosters this season. The league also built an academy in Senegal that opened nearly two years ago. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge joy to see our partnership with the NBA enter unchartered territory as we work together for the first time to maximize the potential of professional basketball in Africa,\u201d said Andreas Zagklis, FIBA\u2019s secretary general. This marks the first time the NBA has been involved with the operation of a league outside of North America. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to work closely with the NBA to develop and put in a place a professional league like none that we have ever seen in our region before,\u201d said FIBA Africa Executive Director Alphonse Bile. \u201cThrough the Basketball Africa League, we can provide the many great clubs and players with the best possible environment to compete for the highest stakes.\u201d The NBA says more details about the new league will be released in the coming months."},{"id":46524,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/charlotte-hornets-kemba-walker-represents-well-faces-decision","date":"2019-02-16","title":"All-Star starter Kemba Walker at home in Charlotte, hopes to stay","content":" CHARLOTTE, N.C. \u2014 Long after his playing days ended, his presence still seems everlasting and omnipresent, rising above the state that raised him and especially here in the city that worships him. Michael Jordan remains the dominant basketball symbol in Charlotte, the jump man with legs that still soar and straddle, and that\u2019s precisely the problem for the team he owns. Because the Hornets, mostly uninspiring on his watch, have long searched for a player compelling enough to put a different face on the franchise. Well, for one day at least, someone else will rep the Hornets and hear the applause and win the crowd and in some ways become bigger than the boss. And when this happens, during the introductions of the starting lineup Sunday at the 68th NBA All-Star Game (8 ET, On TNT, coverage begins at 7) , right in the arena that Jordan Built, Kemba Walker will execute an expression that Jordan made famous and \u2026 shrug. \u201cPeople think of the Charlotte Hornets and they think of me,\u201d said Walker, shaking his head. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of mind blowing to me as well.\u201d Getting the annual midseason showpiece awarded to Charlotte was an accomplishment for Jordan, who\u2019s generally recognized as the game\u2019s greatest player. Yet having one of the Hornets get voted a starting guard for Team Giannis is more gratifying for Jordan the executive and team owner. Walker serves as Jordan\u2019s opus, one of the few decisions the Franchise Got Right, a fun-to-watch little guy who has carried the club the last few years by raising his game and shedding his flaws. The ascent of Walker does come with fine print, however. The time left on his contract expires at season\u2019s end and Walker, still in his prime at 28, will be free to walk to rosier pastures if he so chooses. It will take Jordan\u2019s persuasive power, along with a chunk of money, to convince Walker that Charlotte remains the place for him. This is Walker\u2019s third All-Star trip, first as a starter, and he\u2019s only the Hornets\u2019 second All-Star since Jordan took control of the team in 2010. Charlotte couldn\u2019t have a more ideal representative as a host. Walker is gracious, humble and friendly, easily a fan favorite because of that along with his talent, a package that reflects well on the Hornets. \u201cHaving Kemba as an All-Star gives me great pleasure because I always believed this kid was an All-Star, and he has proven that three years in a row and this year by being a starter,\u201d Jordan said the other day. \u201cI always thought there was something special about this kid.\u201d This is a breakout season for Walker, placing him near the top shelf among guards: Career highs in scoring (24.9), rebounds (4.4) and tying his career high in assists at 5.6. He\u2019s made himself a more efficient three-point shooter and now registers around 38 percent. Bringing quickness off the dribble and a precise step-back jumper, he has taken over games and bailed out the Hornets countless times. He dropped a career-high 60 points on the Sixers, torched the Wizards for 47, punished the Celtics with 43. He takes 20 shots a game, eight more than the next highest Hornet, yet there\u2019s little in Walker\u2019s game that hints of selfishness, and he\u2019s respected in the locker room. \u201cHe\u2019s just a good guy and everyone gravitates towards him,\u201d said forward Marvin Williams. \u201cHe comes to play every night and works hard. There\u2019s nothing not to like.\u201d The feeling is mutual with Walker. Born and raised in the shadow of New York City, he feels at peace in Charlotte and the slower pace and among people who keep him grounded. That\u2019s why Charlotte is his year-round home and he recently purchased a large plot of land to build another. \u201cThey\u2019ve supported me through a lot of bad times; they could\u2019ve given up on my early in my career when I was playing through my mistakes,\u201d Walker said. \u201cWe\u2019re not one of those teams in the playoffs every year so it could be easy to lose interest in a team or a player but it hasn\u2019t been like that. This community, the fans, they\u2019ve been really supportive of me.\u201d Suddenly, the city had an athlete big enough to share the podium with quarterback Cam Newton of the Carolina Panthers, a frequent presence in the front row at Spectrum Center. \u201cCam and I came in the same year,\u201d Walker said. \u201cWe were both with the same shoe company at one point. Lived in the same building when we first got here. Cam is a great dude and basketball fan. Great role model for this community. Both of us got better every season. He\u2019s an MVP of his league and it\u2019s been fun to watch his growth over the years. We\u2019ve both have had huge effects on this city and it\u2019s good to know that.\u201d The Hornets took Walker in ninth in the 2011 draft, a place of misery for the franchise. In 15 drafts since the Hornets were reborn in Charlotte, Walker is the only player to reach All-Star status. Others either didn\u2019t last long or made only modest impressions: Adam Morrison, Emeka Okafor, Raymond Felton, DJ Augustin, Gerald Henderson, Michael-Kidd Gilchrist, Cody Zeller, Frank Kaminsky. That\u2019s why the Hornets have made the playoffs only three times and never made the second round. Walker gradually sharpened his decision-making and stretched his shooting range and improved on the skills that won him a national championship at UConn. \u201cMichael drafted me,\u201d Walker said. \u201cWhen that happened, the first thing that went through my mind is this guy is giving me an opportunity. So I\u2019m going to give it everything I got. That\u2019s what I do for MJ, ever since I\u2019ve been here, each and every night. To try to play the game the right way. Play hard. And a lot has to do with him.\u201d Walker\u2019s allegiance to Jordan will be tested in July when the guard becomes a free agent. It\u2019s a potentially complicated situation. For the past four years the Hornets had Walker at a bargain; right now he\u2019s their sixth highest-paid player at $12 million. He\u2019s the lowest-paid All-Star starter by $8 million. Meanwhile, the Hornets\u2019 salary cap is swollen with pricey players whose production hasn\u2019t matched their salaries. As a result, the Hornets could be in a financial pickle this summer. If Walker makes All-NBA this season, he can command a five-year, $221 million \u201csupermax\u201d contract from the Hornets. If he\u2019s not All-NBA, his Hornets\u2019 money ceiling is five years and $189 million. Another team can offer $140 million over six; the hometown Knicks, among others, have cash. If the Hornets do give Walker the max, they risk a great chance of paying the luxury tax next season, a steep price for a middle of the road, small market team. \u201cIt will be very important to keep him,\u201d said Muggsy Bogues, one of the original Hornets. \u201cHopefully they can, but it will be challenging because giving him a max and not being able to improve the team is something they\u2019re going to be looking at. I know the priority is that he\u2019s here. I cannot see any scenario where he\u2019s not in a Hornets\u2019 uniform next year.\u201d About his upcoming decision, Walker said: \u201cI don\u2019t even know yet. I just want to get to the playoffs and when the summer comes I want to make the right decision for me and my family. I\u2019ve never been a free agent, so I don\u2019t know what to expect yet.\u201d It bodes well for the Hornets that Walker never made a trade demand or expressed any public distaste for the franchise unlike Paul George and Anthony Davis and Kawhi Leonard, stars who became disenchanted as free agency approached. Walker would have good reason; even now the Hornets aren\u2019t a lock for the playoffs this year and lack ample assets besides Walker to make a drastic improvement next season. \u201cPeople go through tough times that\u2019s how I\u2019ve taken it,\u201d Walker said. \u201cI always felt like I\u2019ve grown because of it. I never let it bother me or stop me from becoming a good player. I could\u2019ve easily done that or asked for a trade. I want to build something here. I want to try and make us one of the top teams one day. I love this place. I want to help take this organization to places it has never been.\u201d He has a message for any player at the All-Star Game seeking to recruit him: \u201cFor me, I love competing. I love playing against these other players, the great players. I don\u2019t want to go join their teams. If any want to come play on my team, I\u2019m good with that. But I\u2019m a competitor. Playing against these guys drives me and fuels me. \u201cThere\u2019s something to be said for being on a team for your whole career. Not many players have done that. Only a select few. That\u2019s a goal to accomplish.\u201d Sounds like he\u2019s receptive to staying if the money is right. Until then, there\u2019s a city to represent, a franchise flag to carry and large spotlight awaiting Walker when the All-Star Game begins Sunday in this town. His town. The Spectrum Center will be flush with LeBron James, Kevin Durant, the retiring Dirk Nowitizki and Dwyane Wade and of course Steph Curry, born and raised in Charlotte. There will also be a familiar face at courtside in the form of Michael Jordan. All bring bigger profiles than a certain 6-1 guard for Team Giannis. Kemba Walker will be on his floor, though, and therefore will feel right at home. That\u2019s a good sign for the All-Star Game today, and maybe for the Hornets tomorrow. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

No other play in Charlotte is more under siege than Davis, whose career remains in limbo following a messy attempt to force his way out of New Orleans, only to have the Pelicans reject all proposed deals at the trade deadline. And then last Thursday, Davis injured his shoulder, which left his status for the All-Star Game in question. But he said Saturday \u201cit\u2019s my intent to play\u201d through any lingering shoulder issues and also said the same about playing the rest of the season for the Pelicans. At least that\u2019s his intent. The Pelicans, after a management shakeup Friday caused by the Davis situation , might have a different stance when the season resumes Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s a business, I understand it,\u201d Davis said. \u201cWhen we were talking (previously) about playing or not playing, I understood it from their perspective. We wanted to gets something done and it didn\u2019t happen. So my job is to play and that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to continue to do.\u201d Davis seemed unmoved by the decision to fire Dell Demps, the GM who couldn\u2019t build a consistent winner in Davis\u2019 six-plus seasons in New Orleans. \u201cI didn\u2019t know anything about it but the Pelicans are going to do what\u2019s best for them,\u201d Davis said. \u201cMy intentions are still the same no matter who the GM is. The Pelicans made a move for what\u2019s best of their organization and I\u2019m going to go out and play basketball with my teammates.\u201d It\u2019s a weird if not uncomfortable situation all around for Davis and the team. By expressing a desire to leave \u2014 which he reiterated Saturday \u2014 Davis essentially is saying the franchise isn\u2019t good enough for him anymore. Yet he\u2019s still playing for that franchise and with the same teammates. It caused some frayed feelings within the organization when Davis, after injuring his shoulder during the game with Oklahoma City, left the court and then the building before the game ended without informing team officials. Demps was fired the next day. Davis said he\u2019s still sticking with his list of preferred destinations should the Pelicans trade him this summer \u2014 he still has another year on his contract \u2014 and corrected reports that didn\u2019t have the Celtics on that list. They are, he said. \u201cI just want to go to a team that wins,\u201d said Davis, while adding that he won\u2019t sign an extension with any team until he reaches free agency in 2020. \u201cI had a plan,\u201d he said. \u201cI had steps to follow that plan and did what I was supposed to do. Obviously I knew there was a chance where it probably wasn\u2019t going to happen. So I\u2019m still here. You want to take control of your career. That\u2019s what I tried to do.\u201d Fellow All-Star Paul George was in a similar situation with the Pacers three years ago, with the difference being George was traded to Oklahoma City. \u201cIt\u2019s tough in AD\u2019s situation because now he has to finish a season in New Orleans and being booed and really having a city and fan base turn on him,\u201d said George. \u201cI feel for AD. It\u2019s going to make him tougher, give him a thicker skin. Him having that mental toughness is going to help him.\u201d * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

Sonya Curry, mother of Stephen and Seth and wife of Dell, did the honors Friday afternoon during a Stephen & Ayesha Curry Family Foundation event at the Carole Hoefener Center, sinking an underhanded half-court shot during, what else, a shooting contest consisting of nothing but family. Call it the official kickoff of the 68th NBA All-Star Weekend , a Queen City shindig Golden Sate Warriors coach Steve Kerr dubbed the \u201cCurry Family All-Star Weekend.\u201d There will be Currys all over the city, generations of them, great-grandparents all the way down to infant great-grandkids. Friday\u2019s showcase was just an appetizer and a snapshot of the family\u2019s quality of depth when it comes to the game. Two-time Kia MVP Steph and his wife, Ayesha, teamed up to take on his parents, Seth and his fianc\u00e9e, Callie Rivers, daughter of LA Clippers coach Doc Rivers, and their sister, Seydel and her husband, Warriors reserve guard Damion Lee, in the four-team shooting exhibition. It\u2019ll be Curry against Curry again Saturday night, with both Steph and Seth set to participate in the MTN DEW 3-Point Contest at Spectrum Center. Steph fueled the rumors that Dell, a beloved Charlotte Hornet during his 16-year NBA career, might get it on the fun as well. \u201cI doubt he\u2019ll be in the 3-Point Contest,\u201d Stephen told reporters Friday afternoon. \u201cBut there may be something happening [Saturday]. I\u2019m not sure if the plans have been finalized. But Saturday night, there\u2019s obviously surprises all over the place no matter what year it is. Just this year with me and Seth being in there it takes it up another notch.\u201d It would be fitting to have Dell involved. He was a feared sharpshooter in his own right, retiring in 2002 as the Charlotte Hornets\u2019 all-time leader in points (9,839) and 3-point field goals made (929). And he is the reason this homecoming for the second generation of NBA Currys is generating some of the best buzz of a star-studded weekend. That no one in the family saw all this coming when both Steph and Seth were trying to carve out space for themselves in what has become a rich family history in the game, makes it that much sweeter. \u201cIncredible,\u201d is the way Dell, the color analyst for the Charlotte Hornets TV network, described the Currys \u201cmini family reunion.\u201d Seth is convinced a Curry will win the 3-Point Contest; he\u2019s betting on himself and refuses to give an inch to big brother, same as always. But the big winner, of course, will be the extended Curry family and friends, hundreds of them by Seth\u2019s count, who will enjoy a raucous Saturday night and All-Star Weekend in the place where this current chapter of the family history has its deepest roots. \u201cIt\u2019s special, very special for a lot of family and friends who watched us play growing up,\u201d Seth Curry said. \u201cFrom being little kids and living my whole life growing up in Charlotte, it\u2019s very special for us to go back and participate. It\u2019s always been a dream to compete in a 3-point contest, ever since seeing my dad do it when we were younger. It should be a fun weekend and to see me and Steph out there on the court, I\u2019m sure there are going to be a lot of proud people in the building and in the Charlotte area just watching us.\u201d Steph is used to all eyes being on him, having gone from an under-the-radar high school player at Charlotte Christian to late-blooming college star at Davidson to lottery pick. No one outside of the close-knit Curry clan saw his rise to global superstardom with the Warriors coming, and even their wildest dreams didn\u2019t envision a day when he\u2019d return home on top of the basketball world. He was in the stands at his alma mater Friday night, watching Davidson knock off St. Joseph\u2019s. And he\u2019ll be in great demand all over the place all weekend, including Sunday night\u2019s main event . Seth said he\u2019ll take advantage of any opportunity available to come out victorious, even a little fatigue on Steph\u2019s end. He plans on applying the same pressure that he did when the ultra-competitive Curry brothers were battling each other in basically everything while growing up. \u201cIt was competitive, like any siblings,\u201d Seth Curry said. \u201cBut we always worked out together growing up, playing 1-on-1 in the backyard and just having fun. It got real intense, real heated at times. So as a younger brother, always having someone that was a little bit better than me at every step, I was always trying to use any trick or edge to win a game of 1-on-1 or any shooting contest. That\u2019s what helped me get to where I am.\u201d Seth is already up 1-0 this week, with the Trail Blazers knocking off the Warriors Wednesday in both team\u2019s final game before the break. He refuses to engage in any trash talk before the contestants hit the floor tonight. The rest of the field, he said, is too strong for that. But he is shooting slightly better from beyond the arc this season than his big brother (46.5% to 44.4%). And there\u2019s that bump from the pro-Curry crowd that is sure to be there. \u201cI\u2019m confident in myself. I expect to win,\u201d Seth said. \u201cBut I can\u2019t really trash talk right now. I\u2019ll say a few things if I get the job done. He already has a 3-Point Contest win and a few more accolades over me right now, so I\u2019m trying to add one to my trophy case.\u201d * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

The topic of the Houston guard and his confounding, tantalizing, vexing ways with the basketball came up during a referees roundtable discussion Friday afternoon at All-Star Weekend. Three executives who oversee NBA officials met with a small group of reporters: Byron Spruell, president of league operations; Michelle Johnson, senior vice president and head of referee operations, and Monty McCutchen, the longtime game official now working as VP, head of referee development and training. The purpose? To have an informal state-of-the-season discussion, review certain \u201cpoints of education\u201d identified at the start of 2018-19 (such as \u201cfreedom of movement\u201d guidelines) and field a few questions. It was in that context that McCutchen was asked about Harden and his many moves, some of which appear to bleed into offensive fouls or run astray of other rules, such as traveling. McCutchen, who prefers not to talk publicly about individual players, instead use the platform to discuss how referees try to apply a standard framework in which all players, in all their individual styles, can thrive. \u201cWe cannot target players,\u201d McCutchen said, noting that he and other supervisors will talk to referees about player types. \u201cJames is not the only player who does that, and I don\u2019t want to go into every player who has a bag of tricks. \u201cOur rule book doesn\u2019t support me getting inside a player\u2019s head and saying, \u2018Well, he\u2019s trying to manipulate something.\u2019 I have a physical act that took place based on the principles of our rule book. And those standards are set up so that within those rules, people can play the game that they see fit.\u201d The real test comes when an innovative player introduces something different from what officials are used to. One example McCutchen gave was the willingness of ball handlers to expose tue basketball to a defender\u2019s reach. Instead of shielding the ball, per old school tactics, many current players have enough hand strength to hold the ball in front, enticing their opponents to reach and risk rip-move fouls of them, enticing defenders to reach for it and make themselves vulnerable to rip-move fouls. \u201cHow can I sit there and say, \u2018That\u2019s not good basketball?\u2019 McCutchen said. \u201cShaquille [O\u2019Neal] was another example. We never had a 7-foot-1, 295-pound man who had 2-percent body fat who could do the things Shaquille could do. That put pressure on you [as a referee].\u201d The league\u2019s leading scorer at 36.6 points per game, Harden has been on a tear not seen in the NBA since the early prime of Michael Jordan or, perhaps, the way-back days of Wilt Chamberlain. In his last game before the All-Star break, he scored 42 points against Minnesota to push his streak of scoring 30 or more points to 31 games. That tied Chamberlain for the second-longest in league history (Chamberlain also hold the record of 65 such games). Harden\u2019s most challenging bit of trickery is his step-back 3-pointer, which sometimes results in a traveling violation and sometimes does not. What McCutchen wanted people to know, at least, was that no new rules have been written legislating for or against that move. \u201cIt\u2019s not a new rule,\u201d the former NBA ref said, again not focusing on Harden specifically. \u201cIt\u2019s always been that you gathered the ball and you took two steps to the rim. But nowhere in our rule book does it say that has to be forward. Innovation says, \u2018I can take two steps backwards.\u2019 \u201cNow here\u2019s the problem: Sometimes the feet aren\u2019t quite right. The rhythm\u2019s not quite right on that move. So now I\u2019ve got to get that little baby step in. That\u2019s where it becomes difficult, because I\u2019m also refereeing whether said player is being fouled or not.\u201d As players innovate, referees have to react and adapt. Said McCutchen: \u201cWhat we\u2019re exploring right now is how do we tweak our mechanics so that our teamwork can keep up with the innovations?\u201d McCutchen talked at length about referees striving for consistency across all 48 minutes of a game, and being as ready and willing in the final seconds to call a supposed minor violation such as traveling as they would any other foul. In the process, he shed light on the emphasis officials have put on traveling violations this season. Per data collected by the league, he said, \u201can inordinate amount of defensive fouls come after those few traveling calls that are missed.\u201d * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

With magician\u2019s hands, dancer\u2019s feet and bony elbows and knees that could come in handy in the clinches, the longtime Milwaukee Bucks guard would lock in on his matchup and make like a politician caught up in a tabloid scandal: Deny, deny, deny. And then Moncrief\u2019s Bucks would head to Philadelphia or welcome the 76ers to their house, the colorfully floored MECCA Arena, and the script would flip. Hunter became hunted, defender became defended, because Moncrief would see Bobby Jones a foot or two away, locked in on him. \u201cI couldn\u2019t do anything against him. I was a 20-plus points [per game] scorer, but Bobby was 6-9, long, quick. Scary defensively,\u201d Moncrief said Friday, after he and his Sixers nemesis became two of the 13 finalists for the Class of 2019 headed toward the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.  There was a defensive bent to the finalists announced Friday at the Spectrum Center, during this annual tradition at All-Star Weekend. The group of 13 will be cut down at the NCAA Final Four in Minneapolis on April 6 when the 2019 Hall inductees are named, then enshrined in Springfield, Massachusetts, on Sept. 6. They will be joined by direct-elect selections from the Early African-American Pioneers, International, Veterans, Contributor and Women\u2019s Veterans committees. Beside Moncrief and Jones, former Detroit Pistons big man Ben Wallace and WNBA star Teresa Weatherspoon excelled at the defensive end. But just like the All-Star Game itself, offense seems supreme at the Hall \u2014 and for most of the NBA\u2019s annual awards. \u201cThey should honor defense more,\u201d said Moncrief, who won the Defensive Player of the Year Award the first two seasons (1983, 1984) it was presented. \u201cTypically, the Hall of Fame has a lot to do with championships and points, and players like Bobby Jones, myself and Ben Wallace really played the game on both ends. Everybody says it\u2019s important, but when it comes time to pay people or give awards, normally they don\u2019t.\u201d Actually, players who won 24 of the first 25 DPOY awards are Hall eligible \u2013- Metta World Peace (2004) did not retire till 2017 \u2013- and seven of them, with a total of 13 DPOY awards, have been enshrined. Only Marcus Camby and Mark Eaton, with one DPOY trophy each and among the Hall\u2019s list of first-time nominees this year, have missed, along with Moncrief. Of those enshrined, most were considered formidable two-way players. Only Dikembe Mutombo (four DPOYs) and Dennis Rodman (two) were known on the court primarily for their defense. It was a topic Hall chairman Jerry Colangelo had given thought to this winter. \u201cFlying down to Dallas for our committee meeting, I was thinking about what the process is all about,\u201d Colangelo said after Friday\u2019s ceremony. \u201cWe give credit for all-NBA teams, All-Star, statistics and awards, but not much about defense. On the plane, I came up with a point system [based on] first team all-defense, second team, Defensive Player of the Year. That\u2019s as big as making first team all-league. \u201cAll of a sudden, a couple of guys really rose: Bobby Jones, Ben Wallace. Moncrief was as good a two-way player as we\u2019ve had. The point is, defense is a big part of the game.\u201d  Paul Westphal, another former NBA great chosen as a Hall finalist, wasn\u2019t known for his defense \u2014 he peaked as a 25-ppg scorer (51.6 FG%) in 1977-78. But he knew when he had to face it. \u201cGreat offense will always overcome great defense,\u201d Westphal said. \u201cBut great defense can find your weakness and shut you down. These guys getting recognized for their defense were phenomenal.\u201d Wallace, who helped Detroit to its 2004 NBA championship, won four DPOY awards. Moncrief was selected four times to NBA All-Defensive teams. Remarkably, Jones never was named Defensive Player of the Year, but he was a regular on the All-Defensive squads, appearing eight times. Other NBA players names as Hall finalists Friday included Marques Johnson, Jack Sikma and Chris Webber. Coach Bill Fitch will be considered for the Class of 2019, as will referee Hugh Evans. The other finalists were coaches at the high school or college level, including Eddie Sutton, Leta Andrews and Barbara Stevens. Another connection for a subset of the finalists is Milwaukee. Moncrief, Johnson and Sikma all played for the Bucks, and Del Harris -\u2013 one of the co-winners of the illustrious John Bunn Lifetime Achievement Award -\u2013 coached there. The 1980s Bucks, coached by Don Nelson and eventually Harris, are considered one of the best teams never to reach a Finals.  \u201cThat makes my heart smile,\u201d Moncrief said, of the Bucks flavor Friday. \u201cIt shows you how good we were. But it also shows you how good Philadelphia and Boston were, along with the Lakers. We had some good teams, but we were just not quite as good as those teams.\u201d The other Bunn award winner with Harris was Portland\u2019s Harry Glickman, long considered the \u201cfather\u201d of Trail Blazers basketball. The annual Curt Gowdy Media Awards went to Marc Stein in the print category -\u2013 Stein has covered the NBA for ESPN and most recently the New York Times for more than 20 years \u2013 and the Clippers\u2019 legendary Ralph Lawler in the broadcast category. Lawler has worked for the Clippers for 37 years, calling more than 3,100 games. None of the other first-time nominees with NBA connections advanced to the finalist round. Among them: players Camby, Eaton and Dale Ellis, along with coaches Rick Adelman and George Karl. Holdovers or returning nominees familiar to NBA fans who did not qualify as finalists included players Mark Aguirre, Chauncey Billups, Richard Hamilton, Tim Hardaway and Kevin Johnson, as well as coaches Rudy Tomjanovich, Dick Motta and Cotton Fitzsimmons, and referee Jake O\u2019Donnell. A number of the NBA\u2019s biggest names appeared on stage for the televised news conference, including Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Artis Gilmore, Rick Barry, Alex English, Spencer Haywood and David Thompson; fellow Hall of Famers Nancy Lieberman and exec Rick Welts also participated. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Building a true championship contender in the NBA is a unique process for each franchise, and our path in Denver hasn\u2019t always been clear. But Tim, Arturas and the rest of our staff continued to work through every challenge we faced along the way, and I hope Nuggets fans are as excited as we are about our future. We firmly believe we can bring an NBA championship to Denver, and are thrilled to continue our pursuit together.\u201d Connelly joined the Nuggets in the summer of 2013 as General Manager after spending the previous 17 years in various front office roles with the Washington Wizards and New Orleans Hornets. Karnisovas also joined Denver as Assistant General Manager in 2013 after spending five years with the Houston Rockets front office and the previous four years with the NBA league office after his illustrious overseas playing career. Under Connelly and Karnisovas\u2019s watch, Denver drafted franchise centerpiece Nikola Joki\u0107 in the second round with the 41st overall pick, and the Sombor, Serbian native was recently named to his first All-Star game as a reserve this season. They also drafted point guard Monte Morris with the 51st overall pick in 2017, turning his two-way contract into a guaranteed contract prior to this season which has seen the second-year guard lead the NBA in assist-to-turnover ratio. Connelly and Karnisovas selected starting shooting guard Gary Harris at 19th overall in 2014 as well as starting point guard Jamal Murray (7th overall) and Malik Beasley (19th overall) in the 2016 NBA draft. They also signed four-time All-Star Paul Millsap to a free agent contract in the summer of 2017 and converted undrafted free-agent Torrey Craig\u2019s two-way contract to a guaranteed deal after bringing him over from the Australian Basketball League prior to the 2017-18 season.

This year\u2019s list includes four first-time finalists: consensus National Collegiate Player of the Year Marques Johnson, seven-time NBA All-Star Jack Sikma, four-time NBA Defensive Player of the Year Ben Wallace, and five-time NBA All-Star Paul Westphal. Previous finalists included again this year for consideration are the all-time winningest high school coach Leta Andrews, 28-year NBA referee Hugh Evans, two-time NBA Coach of the Year Bill Fitch, eight-time NBA All-Defensive First Team member Bobby Jones, five-time NBA All-Star Sidney Moncrief, five-time Division II National Coach of the Year Barbara Stevens, four-time National Coach of the Year Eddie Sutton, five-time WNBA All-Star Theresa Weatherspoon, and five-time NBA All-Star Chris Webber. \u201cTo be named a Finalist for the Basketball Hall of Fame is a tremendous honor and we are proud to recognize the outstanding men and women who have impacted the game,\u201d said Jerry Colangelo, Chairman of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. \u201cWe congratulate our finalists and looking forward to revealing the Class of 2019 at the NCAA Final Four in Minneapolis this spring.\u201d Announced in December 2017, two modifications have been made to the election process starting with the Class of 2018. Potential honorees are eligible on the ballot for Hall of Fame enshrinement after three full seasons of retirement. The second notable reform to Hall of Fame eligibility requires coaches to have coached for 25 years and reached the minimum age of 60. This allows the Honors Committee to evaluate a larger body of work for those coaches nominated. This change will take effect in 2020, allowing a grace period for coaches who are nearing Hall of Fame eligibility based on previous standards. The complete list of 10 finalists from the North American Screening Committee includes: players Marques Johnson, Bobby Jones, Sidney Moncrief, Jack Sikma, Ben Wallace, Chris Webber and Paul Westphal; coaches Bill Fitch and Eddie Sutton; and referee Hugh Evans. The three finalists from the Women\u2019s Screening Committee include: player Theresa Weatherspoon; and coaches Leta Andrews and Barbara Stevens. The Class of 2019 will be announced at a press conference in Minneapolis, Minnesota at the NCAA Men\u2019s Final Four. Enshrinees from the Direct Elect Committees are also recognized at the NCAA Men\u2019s Final Four and include Early African-American Pioneers, International, Contributors, Veterans and the new Women Veterans. A finalist needs 18 of 24 votes from the Honors Committee for election into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. The Class of 2019 will be enshrined during festivities in Springfield, Massachusetts, the birthplace of basketball, September 5-7, 2019.

It is unclear how the injury might affect Davis\u2019 availability for this weekend\u2019s NBA All-Star festivities. ESPN\u2019s Ramona Shelburne reported that an MRI merely showed a muscle contusion, but \u201cnothing too bad.\u201d Per Shelburne, Davis will head to Charlotte for NBA All-Star 2019 and get treatment on his shoulder over the next few days. Davis will then see how he feels before deciding about playing in Sunday\u2019s All-Star Game. On Friday, Yahoo Sports\u2019 Chris Haynes reported that Davis plans to play Sunday, but it will depend on how his body responds to treatment of the injury. Davis was selected for the All-Star Game for the sixth straight season. But if he plays, he\u2019ll represent a team he has no plans to remain with long term. He was selected to play on Team LeBron in the 2019 NBA All-Star Game ( Feb. 17, 8 ET on TNT ). According to NBA rules, when an All-Star is unable to participate, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver shall choose a replacement from the same conference as the player who is being replaced. Davis announced on Jan. 28 that he won\u2019t sign an extension with New Orleans and wants to be traded to a contending team. However, he was not traded by the Feb. 7 deadline for this season. Davis was in the starting lineup against the Thunder and played 16 minutes during the first half. He scored 14 points, grabbed four rebounds, assisted on two baskets and blocked a shot in 16 minutes on the court. His performance helped New Orleans take a 66-63 lead into halftime. But in the final seconds of the half, Davis fouled Nerlens Noel while trying to block the Thunder forward\u2019s shot with his left hand. As Davis walked to the locker room for halftime, he appeared to keep his left arm still while his right arm swayed normally. Davis did not emerge from the locker room to start the second half and the club announced his injury status shortly afterward. Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry declined to address his reaction to Davis\u2019 departure. \u201cTo tell you the truth, this whole thing has been a dumpster fire,\u201d Gentry said, alluding to the effect Davis\u2019 trade demand has had on the rest of the team. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for guys to go through what they\u2019ve been through, and to be able to come out and beat a team of that quality, I\u2019m happy for all the guys.\u201d Davis has averaged 28.5 points and 13.1 rebounds this season. Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":35524,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/jordan-week-mj-impact-charlotte","date":"2019-02-15","title":"Back in home state of North Carolina, Jordan's weight reaches farther than court","content":" CHARLOTTE \u2014 Unlike Mark Cuban and James Dolan, the host of the 2019 NBA All-Star Game was voted in 14 times to participate and played in 13. Quite different from Micky Arison and Glen Taylor, the team owner whose arena and city will be the center of All-Star 2019 averaged 20.2 points in those 13 All-Star appearances, was named MVP three times and posted the first triple-double in the game\u2019s history (1997). And not at all like Steve Ballmer and Joe Lacob, the guy most often credited with making Charlotte All-Star worthy this weekend ignited the annual Slam Dunk Contest with his takeoff from the foul line in 1988 . He also regularly irritated former NBA commissioner David Stern into a series of fines for golfing when he should have been sitting through mandatory Friday media sessions. With a level of celebrity as arguably the game\u2019s greatest player ever, morphed now into an off-radar role as owner of the Charlotte Hornets, Michael Jordan remains as famous, as popular and as successful as any or all the active All-Star participants who\u2019ll cavort at the Spectrum Center in the city\u2019s Uptown business district. Ain\u2019t no other NBA owner who can say that . \u201cYou think about all these wealthy, successful owners in our league,\u201d said Hornets president Fred Whitfield, \u201cno one knew who any of them were, really, until they bought their team. Everybody in the world knew who Michael Jordan was before he bought his team.\u201d  Jordan\u2019s place in the All-Star galaxy in the coming days is reflective of his unique position among those who oversee the NBA\u2019s 29 other franchises. His impact on the team, on its fans, on their city and on the state in returning to his native North Carolina \u2014 he grew up in coastal Wilmington before attending college in Chapel Hill \u2014 to anchor and lend stability to the Hornets will be on full display, even if he\u2019s hard to spot this weekend. It\u2019s all a reminder, too, of the old movie line from a remarkably blessed character, wondering \u201cWhat do you do when your real life exceeds your dreams?\u201d  Most don\u2019t dare to imagine playing in an All-Star Game, never mind hosting one as the owner of the local team. \u201cNo,\u201d Jordan told some Charlotte reporters Tuesday , coming forward for one of his few appearances of the week. \u201cAs a kid growing up here in North Carolina, the first thing [was] playing basketball. And then things evolved from there \u2014 from the University of North Carolina to Chicago. Obviously you know the history from that. \u201c[The] opportunity to represent North Carolina in an All-Star Game from a different seat is truly amazing. It tells the path that I have taken. It gives me great pleasure to give that back to the community. It\u2019s been a long-traveled road.\u201d The celebration of the league\u2019s brightest stars, and the ubiquitous banners and signage devoted to it will make it even harder than usual to visibly spot signs of Jordan\u2019s ownership of the Hornets. For a typical regular season game, you might spy a flag emblazoned with his well-known \u201cJumpman\u201d logo. Occasionally he\u2019ll watch part of the game, rarely all, from seats at the end of his team\u2019s bench, though he\u2019s as likely to retreat to his suite atop the arena\u2019s lower bowl. An in-game, timeout scoreboard video meant to stoke the crowd includes shots of GM Mitch Kupchak (\u201cArchitect of Champions\u201d) and coach James Borrego (\u201cElite Pedigree\u201d) but ends right about the time you expect some dramatic silhouette of His Airness to appear. It\u2019s as if Jordan is as protective of his brand in running the Hornets as he is in maintaining its exclusivity in the marketplace. Doesn\u2019t matter, though. His fingerprints are all over the franchise, as a basketball team, as a business enterprise and as a member of the community. Jordan\u2019s greatest notoriety as an owner in a basketball setting may have come in December, when he was courtside for a tense game against Detroit . Guard Jeremy Lamb drained a 22-foot jumper with 0.3 seconds left, sending reserves Malik Monk and Bismack Biyombo onto the floor in celebration of what would be a 108-107 home victory. Trouble was, that sliver of time on the clock. Too many men. The Hornets were whistled for a one-shot technical foul and Jordan impulsively smacked Monk lightly , twice, on the back of the head. Any other owner does that, the player\u2019s agent might file a grievance with the players union. Jordan does it and, thanks to his in-the-trenches, in-the-fraternity credibility, it comes across as a goof. \u201cA tap of endearment,\u201d Jordan called it later in a statement . \u201cIt was like a big brother and little brother tap. No negative intent. Only love!\u201d Said Monk: \u201cBig, big, big brother. But it was nothing. He was just playing.\u201d The arc of Jordan\u2019s career and his reputation as a stone-cold competitor make it OK if he wants to vent \u2014 or swipe \u2014 when things don\u2019t go the Hornets\u2019 way. Doesn\u2019t matter that Jordan, who will turn 56 on All-Star Sunday, is old enough to be any of his players\u2019 dad. He still carries himself like an athlete, and their frame of reference remains, \u201cThat\u2019s Mike.\u201d  \u201cI\u2019ve seen kids come up through camps,\u201d said Buzz Peterson, Charlotte\u2019s assistant general manager under Kupchak. \u201cYou could say Julius Erving, you could say Larry Johnson, Karl Malone, whatever, and the kids\u2019 eyes are like, \u2018Who?\u2019 But you say Michael Jordan, they\u2019re gonna know. That\u2019s the separation there.\u201d Peterson is among Jordan\u2019s closest friends \u2014 he beat him out as North Carolina\u2019s prep player of the year in 1981, won an NCAA title with him as a Tar Heels teammate and is described by those who know both as someone who can disagree with the boss while staying comfortably in the inner circle. For Borrego, Charlotte\u2019s first-year coach, interviewing to run Jordan\u2019s team could have been intimidating. \u201cWe\u2019re all human beings \u2014 there\u2019s a presence that comes with \u2018Michael Jordan\u2019 when he\u2019s around,\u201d Borrego told NBA.com in January. \u201cBut it\u2019s healthy. He comes with a competitive spirit that you feel. \u201cMichael was straight with me from Day 1. When I interviewed, he said, \u2018I\u2019m going to give you space to do your job. Whatever you need, you come to me. I\u2019ll give you the resources you need.\u2019 He has not tried to interfere one time. I feel his full support. \u2026 We\u2019re starting to speak each other\u2019s language, which is pretty healthy for us now.\u201d Jordan keeps the coach apprised of his interactions with players, Borrego said. Other coaches should have such a resource at the ready. Hornets guard and 2019 All-Star starter Kemba Walker probably has benefited most from Jordan\u2019s counsel. They text frequently, a pinch-me arrangement to this day for Walker. \u201cI grew up wearing Jordans, grew up wanting to be like Jordan,\u201d Walker said recently. \u201cSo for me to get this opportunity to be on his team means the world to me. He\u2019s the one who believed in me \u2014 I had no idea where I was going to go on draft night and he traded up for me. I\u2019ve always heard the story, he was the one who actually drafted me. So it\u2019s unbelievable. \u201cHe\u2019s such a good dude. He understands what it is to be good. His delivery is always good. Only in a positive way, honestly.\u201d Said rookie wing Miles Bridges: \u201cYou think there\u2019ll be a lot of pressure having MJ as an owner. I\u2019d seen how he got on his teammates when he played. So I was nervous, thinking if I had a bad game, he\u2019d go at me like, \u2018What\u2019re you doing?\u2019 But after meeting him and bonding with him, I feel like he\u2019s the coolest owner out there. I don\u2019t feel any pressure, I feel like he wants the best for us.\u201d Big man Frank Kaminsky typically sits at the end of the bench, which puts him cheek to cheek with Jordan when he\u2019s courtside. \u201cHe\u2019s talking about what he\u2019s seeing out on the court. Talking to the refs,\u201d Kaminsky said. \u201cThings other players don\u2019t necessarily see. He still thinks the game. \u201cYou see things on the court that he sees. One game, the roll, pocket-pass, skip to the corner was open. He was saying that. We made an adjustment in a timeout, but he saw it a couple plays before that. At the end of that game, we had a big play that was a roll, pocket-pass, into the corner that put the game away. It worked the way he\u2019d seen it.\u201d The Hornets\u2019 struggles during Jordan\u2019s tenure as owner wouldn\u2019t suggest it \u2014 the last time this organization won a playoff series (2002), Jordan still was a player \u2014 but there is a prestige to playing for his team. It\u2019s not unlike being welcomed onto the list of elite athletes who endorse Jordan Brand. \u201cI\u2019m one of the lucky ones who\u2019s in both,\u201d Kaminsky said. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about the most iconic player in sports history \u2014 I might be biased because I grew up in Chicago \u2014 but when you have his approval, it means a lot. You have it in the back of your mind that he wants you here.\u201d Head smack or no head smack. Basketball is a zero-sum game and the NBA is full of stars, even if none shines quite as brightly as Jordan. But business has room for negotiation and compromise, and deals get struck daily that leave both sides happy. There, Jordan has been beyond clutch. Funnel down everything he\u2019s accomplished \u2014 six NBA championships, the league\u2019s highest career scoring average (30.1), five MVP awards, six Finals MVP, 10 scoring titles, nine All-Defensive team nods \u2014 and it invariably ends with clammy hands. The \u201cwow\u201d factor is real and the Hornets are extremely careful about leveraging it. \u201cIt gives our organization a certain cachet,\u201d said Whitfield, another longtime friend who goes back more than 35 years with Jordan. \u201cFor him to be majority owner, for him to do it in his home state as a local hometown hero, and to be able to come back and not just lead the team and the rebranding from the Bobcats to the Hornets , but his commitment to the community in giving back, it\u2019s something that\u2019s so special.\u201d That\u2019s a lot to unpack. When Jordan initially signed on with the Hornets, he did so as head of its basketball operations in 2006, purchasing a small minority stake in the team . The team was bad, the business was worse and trending down.  \u201cBack in \u201908-09, the economy was in the tank and I was mandated to \u2018displace\u2019 42 of our executives here on the business side,\u201d Whitfield said. \u201cWhen Michael bought the team, we were losing $30 million a year.\u2019 Brought back into the league in 2004 two years after the original Hornets (1988-2002) were moved to New Orleans by reviled owner George Shinn, the Charlotte expansion team was owned \u2014 and nicknamed \u2014 by Bob Johnson, a co-founder of the BET television network. The Bobcats excelled only at losing and were 122 games under .500 in their first five seasons. The front office was understaffed, Spectrum Center (then known as Time Warner Cable Arena) needed renovations almost from its inception and there was a real sense that, if a buyer with deep pockets and a commitment to the area weren\u2019t found, the franchise could be moved. In March 2010, Jordan ponied up the cash to become majority owner . But it says something that the deal stands as one of the few, if ever, instances of an NBA franchise being sold at a discount. Johnson paid $300 million for the team; Jordan purchased it for $275 million . Forbes.com recently had Charlotte worth $1.25 billion \u2014 which ranks 28th. And Jordan reportedly has one of the biggest stakes of all NBA owners, with his share estimated at upwards of 90 percent, possibly as high as 98 percent. That\u2019s a lot of success in nine years, despite the basketball team\u2019s mostly middling performance. \u201cWith MJ being with the team, you got instant credibility in the marketplace,\u201d said Pete Guelli, the chief operating officer who started on the job about 10 months before Jordan took ownership. \u201cThere had been a lot of uncertainty previously, but with his brand and his resources and his commitment, that just dissipated immediately. It was much, much easier to walk in the door and tell people about our vision for this franchise.\u201d Rebranding the team as \u201cHornets\u201d gave the franchise an existential boost \u2014 it suddenly had a history again, complete with records, archives and true alumni. The arena got a makeover and, per Guelli, is credited for events there that generate an alleged $1 billion in revenues for local businesses. \u201cFortunately, we\u2019ve been profitable pretty much since [Jordan took over],\u201d Whitfield said. \u201cThat\u2019s huge, especially since we haven\u2019t gotten where we want to be on the basketball side.\u201d It\u2019s hard to overstate Jordan\u2019s added value, not so much as some corporate or financial whiz but as a presence who brought instant motivation and energy to the staff. He imported executives with whom he had developed relationships at Nike or in other ventures and, after taking early criticism for an uncertain level of involvement, has been more diligent in recent years. \u201cI love seeing him sitting at the end of the bench encouraging his players when he attends a game\u201d said Charles F. Bowman, Bank of America\u2019s market president for Charlotte and North Carolina. \u201cAnd as a business person what impresses me is that he has empowered his management team to focus not only on the court but also on building bridges with the community. \u201cHe had a vision for where he was taking the team and a clear plan to get there. He has hired good people, gives them latitude to make decisions and he expects them to perform. Michael is unique \u2014 the best player ever who is determined to keep getting better year over year as an owner.\u201d The NBA has gotten a taste of Jordan\u2019s growth and transition at some pivotal times. This is the legendary voice of the players who, during rancorous negotiations in the 1998 lockout, countered Washington owner Abe Pollin\u2019s gripes about losing money by telling Pollin to sell his team. By the lockout of 2011, Jordan had moved to the other side of the table. But several members of the National Basketball Players Association\u2019s executive committee saw him not as an opponent or turncoat but as a role model: someone who had transformed himself from employee to employer at the game\u2019s highest level. \u201cThe players understood, he had been in their shoes,\u201d Whitfield said. \u201cHe\u2019s not forgetting what it meant to be a player. He was in the process of learning what it meant to be an owner.\u201d When the current collective bargaining agreement was negotiated with commissioner Adam Silver and union director Michele Roberts leading the talks, Jordan was an active, powerful voice. He is an influential member of the NBA\u2019s labor relations and competition committees. One Charlotte insider spoke to Jordan\u2019s clout with his fellow owners in getting this weekend\u2019s showcase \u2014 jeopardized by a political squabble in 2017 \u2014 back onto the league\u2019s short list.  \u201cThere\u2019s no All-Star Game here in Charlotte if it\u2019s not for MJ,\u201d the person said. Last summer in Las Vegas, Silver lauded Jordan for his ability to straddle the basketball and business worlds. \u201cHe brings unique credibility to the table when we\u2019re having discussions [with the players],\u201d he said, \u201cand even just among the owners, he\u2019s able to represent a player point of view\u2026 Michael can say, \u2018Well, look, this is how I looked at it when I was a player, and these are the kind of issues we need to address if we\u2019re going to convince players that something is in everyone\u2019s interest.\u2019 \u201d Jordan\u2019s powers of persuasion apparently have been even more impressive in Charlotte and North Carolina. The executives are careful about relying on him too often \u2014 Jordan\u2019s most precious commodity, now that his net worth is estimated to be upwards of $1.7 billion \u2014 is his time. But when they need Mariano Rivera to walk in from the bullpen, he is lights out. \u201cWe\u2019ve had corporate sponsors at a golf outing, and he\u2019s been there, maybe stayed at one hole to tell off with everybody,\u201d Whitfield said. Or they\u2019ll invite certain corporate sponsors to one of a few games each season in which \u201cClub 23\u201d is up and running at the Spectrum Center, a private club built for such purposes. They get a chance to visit, talk with and pick Jordan\u2019s brain on the Hornets and much more. \u201cWe\u2019ve closed all those deals,\u201d Whitfield said. Then there was the time a local CEO wanted to finalize a sizeable sponsorship deal with the team, and had his No. 2 invite Jordan over to their headquarters for the meetings. Whitfield told the tale: \u201cThis guy says, \u2018You have to come to our office. Our CEO is the man in our business.\u2019 But we\u2019re like, \u2018Nah, typically, CEOs come and meet in Michael\u2019s office or in \u2018Club 23\u2019 over here.\u2019 He said no, that wasn\u2019t going to work for them. \u201cSo Pete Guelli said, \u2018Let\u2019s make a deal: We\u2019ll take your CEO and drop him off in Beijing. And we\u2019ll drop off Michael in Beijing. Then we\u2019ll see who more people gravitate to. Whoever gets the least people, he has to come to the other guy\u2019s office.\u2019\u201d Point made. Point taken. Said Whitfield: \u201cThe guy says, \u2018You know what, I got it. We\u2019ll be over 10 o\u2019clock Friday morning.\u2019\u201d The Michael Jordan who once seemed determined to float above cultural and political frays as the most prudent way to serve commerce has not held back in recent years from making his presence felt. He has been more philanthropist than activist and, let\u2019s face it, in times of the most dire need, cash beats talk every time. Charity and investing in the community can be good for business, sure. Making that a priority after Guelli\u2019s arrival and Jordan\u2019s purchase helped the Hornets build bridges with fans and merchants that Shinn and the original franchise\u2019s departure had torched. More than that, though, giving back for Jordan and his team at this point in his life was the right thing to do. And do, and do, and do. The list of charitable and civic efforts Jordan and the Hornets have undertaken is long, with few outside the region or state aware of most of it.  Among the highlights: After the hurricane in September devastated so many homes and businesses in and near Jordan\u2019s roots, he wanted to do more than to stroke a fat check. In a meeting covered by The Associated Press , he met with Stephanie Parker and her family , including four young children, after they lost their apartment in two feet of flooding. A call from the director of the Cape Fear chapter of the Red Cross brought them together. The meeting took place at a Lowe\u2019s home improvement store. \u201cI look around the corner, and it\u2019s Michael Jordan. \u2018Oh my God!\u2019\u201d Parker said. \u201cI look at my kids, \u2018It\u2019s Michael Jordan!\u2019 I\u2019m not going to lie, some tears came in my eyes, because the first thing that went through my mind was when I was younger, his last game when he was on the Chicago Bulls team, and that flashback just came right in my mind.\u201d Afterward, Jordan was coaxed by the Charlotte Observer to talk about why that disaster resonated so deeply for him. \u201cYou gotta take care of home,\u201d he said. \u201cWilmington truly is my home. Kept thinking about all those places I grew up going to \u2026 You don\u2019t want to see any of that anywhere, but when it\u2019s home, that\u2019s tough to swallow.\u201d There\u2019s basketball, there\u2019s business and then there\u2019s real life, which sometimes intrudes in the most desperate ways. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know how many people in our community were hungry,\u201d Whitfield said. \u201cThere are people in dire need, and it\u2019s special to have that hometown hero have in his heart that \u2018This is where I can help.\u2019 \u201cIt gives not only him as a person but our organization a platform to really speak out. That commitment is what has made him a special owner, and why he\u2019s even more beloved in our community.\u201d To date, Jordan\u2019s greatest achievements have come elsewhere, at least since his baseline shot as a freshman propelled North Carolina to the 1982 NCAA championship. Those Bulls championships, the \u201cDream Team\u201d magnificence, his partnership with that sneaker company in Beaverton, Ore., his Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame induction, shooting \u201cSpace Jam,\u201d all of it \u2014 his legacy has been crafted with others, for others, mostly far from home. (For the record, Jordan, his wife Yvette and their two daughters own a mansion outside Charlotte and an estate in south Florida). \u201cLook, this has always been home for him,\u201d Whitfield said. \u201cEven though he was drafted by Chicago, WGN became a very popular station. And he just continued to elevate, so people in this state were proud to say, even though he\u2019s a Bull, we love him. When the Bulls would come here and play at the old Coliseum, these fans who were avid Hornets fans were all pulling for Michael Jordan. \u201cHe\u2019d score, they\u2019d cheer loudly. The Hornets would score, they\u2019d cheer loudly. North Carolina always felt like he was their native son who went off and achieved greatness.\u201d Coming back first to head the franchise\u2019s basketball operations and then as owner, Jordan\u2019s role \u2014 in light of the modest results on the court \u2014 has been custodial. Yes, the club\u2019s improved financial stability is important. But for this driven winner and NBA owner unlike all others, custodial isn\u2019t going to cut it for long. \u201cHe did an interview with Cigar Aficionado magazine a while back,\u201d Peterson said, \u201cand the question was asked, \u2018What would you like to do?\u2019 And he said, \u2018Win a seventh championship. Win as an owner.\u2019 So for me, every day, I\u2019m thinking, here\u2019s a close friend and you want to make your friends happy, right? So each day I think, do the best you can to reach this goal for him.\u201d Said Hornets wing Nicolas Batum: \u201cI understand. He wants to win. He wants to compete since he was born.\u201d It hasn\u2019t been for lack of trying, although Jordan has made sure to keep fiscal responsibility high on every agenda. The team\u2019s payroll for 2018-19 is approximately $122.3 million, which ranks near the middle of the NBA pack. \u201cThat Michael Jordan is one cheap dude,\u201d said an impassioned cab driver on a recent airport run. \u201cHe\u2019s only going to spend so much and the players they get shows it.\u201d The Hornets never have spent into the league\u2019s luxury-tax, and if Walker is retained when he hits free agency this summer, he\u2019ll likely become the first Charlotte player to sign a full maximum-salary contract (though the five-year, $120 million deal Batum landed in 2016 came awfully close). Injuries and dubious moves have taken a toll, a situation that Kupchak, Borrego and their staffs have been tasked with fixing. Jordan, by all accounts, is engaged yet patient, with a playoff berth and potentially a record above .500 within reach. \u201cI\u2019m sure he feels like,\u201d Whitfield said, \u201cif he were still 30 years old and could lace \u2018em up and get out there, he\u2019d help us get over the hump. I think he would cherish it as much or more than the first six. Because I think he realizes how hard it is to get it done. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t bother us if the fans see his frustration sitting next to our bench. It\u2019s important to us that they see he\u2019s not only invested, he\u2019s vested in what our team is trying to do. They can relate to him because they\u2019re feeling that same frustration.\u201d Jordan is theirs again and that\u2019s what matters. For basketball, for business, for community and in time, just maybe, in championship. * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

That\u2019s all Jrue Holiday said the Pelicans needed to do and that\u2019s all they did in an impressive 131-122 victory over a rolling Oklahoma City Thunder as the NBA closed out its pre- All-Star Weekend slate on Thursday. Holiday was part of a team-wide containment effort that checked Kia MVP candidate Paul George, who struggled through a 28-point performance, shooting just 11-of-29 (3-17 3FGs) and committing three turnovers. Russell Westbrook did his best to pick up the slack, extending his NBA record with an 11th straight triple-double (44 points, 14 rebounds, 11 assists) and entering the OKC record books: We should acknowledge here that, yes, Anthony Davis played, putting up 14 points, four rebounds, two assists, a steal and a block in 15 minutes. And yes, he suffered a shoulder injury that left him out of action for the second half. And yes, he reportedly left the arena before the game was over. But Alvin Gentry was out here to discuss the players who played and closed out the win: For what it\u2019s worth, late-night media reports indicated a muscle contusion, but \u201cnothing too bad\u201d for Davis. Pelicans fans can take solace in the W and this awesome second-quarter dunk from Frank Jackson: The Knicks finally got one, beating the Hawks end-to-end for a 106-91 victory that snapped a franchise-worst 18-game slide. Dennis Smith Jr., who\u2019s averaging 17.0 points (42.7 FG%) and 6.0 assists in seven games with the Knicks, led the team with 19 points; DeAndre Jordan chipped in 10 points, 13 rebounds and 3 blocks. Recent 10-day signee John Jenkins was second on the team with 14 points (6-13 FGs) in 25 minutes, though most of them came in an early flurry: Sign that man up for a two-week run as rando fan favorite Knicks fans will be mad they didn\u2019t overpay this offseason. The AT&T Slam Dunk is looming as part of State Farm All-Star Saturday Night , and 2013 dunk champ Terrence Ross took a chance to get the action started early. In the fourth quarter of Orlando\u2019s resounding 127-89 victory over Charlotte, Ross saw a baseline opportunity and would not be denied, finishing with an up-and-under reverse to evade a pair of Hornets. Wouldn\u2019t be out of place on Saturday. Ross finished with a game-high 21 points (8-15 FGs, 3-8 3Ps), one of six Magic players to hit double-digits. Hopefully Kemba Walker, who finished Thursday\u2019s game 4-for-20 (10 points) \u2014 part of Charlotte\u2019s season-low 4-for-31 (12.9%) shooting from 3-point range \u2014 can regroup in time for not only the upcoming MTN DEW 3-Point Contest , but also Sunday\u2019s All-Star Game in front of his home fans. Could understand him and the Hornets having their heads in the upcoming festivities, though let\u2019s not discount the Magic for this five-game run (winning seven of their last eight!). They\u2019ve outpaced the league in defensive efficiency since it began , allowing only 98.8 points per 100 possessions. For comparison, Milwaukee leads on the season at 103.5."},{"id":35491,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/westbrook-thunder-franchise-scoring-leader","date":"2019-02-15","title":"Westbrook passes Payton as Thunder franchise scoring leader","content":" Russell Westbrook\u2019s name is a common occurrence within the Thunder\u2019s franchise record books . On Thursday, the former Kia MVP climbed to the top in one of them. With a driving layup late in the first quarter against New Orleans , the eight-time All-Star passed Hall-of-Famer Gary Payton to become the team\u2019s all-time scoring leader. Westbrook needed just five points entering the game to do so, having scored all 18,203 points with the same franchise that drafted him fourth overall in 2008.

The Lakers won the Pacific Division, reached the Western Conference semifinals with Bryant leading the way with is usual scoring exploits. The 2012 All-Star Game was especially memorable for fans of the Lakers and Bryant as well. On Feb. 27, 2012, Bryant passed his idol, Michael Jordan, for No. 1 spot in All-Star Game scoring annals. Bryant surpassed Jordan\u2019s total of 262 points scored in All-Star Games with a dunk with 4:57 to play in the third quarter. In addition to that feat, the game was memorable for another reason, too. After taking a hard foul from Miami\u2019s Dwyane Wade in the third quarter, he returned to finish with 27 points on 9-of-17 shooting. He also went 7-of-8 at the foul line despite having to clean up his bleeding nostrils between shots. A CT scan revealed a broken nose, the Lakers later reported on their team website. Bryant\u2019s reign as the All-Star Game\u2019s all-time scorer did not last long, though. In the 2016 All-Star Game, LeBron James passed Bryant. At the start of that game in 2016, Bryant had 280 All-Star Game points to James\u2019 278. By the end of the game, James narrowly surpassed Bryant, 291-290 Bryant, an 18-time All-Star, retired in 2016 as No. 2 on all-time list with 290 points in the 15 All-Star Games he played in."},{"id":35579,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/jordan-week-1991-all-star-game-charlotte","date":"2019-02-14","title":"Charlotte no stranger to NBA All-Star spotlight","content":"You can\u2019t hear 24,000 fans buzzing about the novelty of pro basketball, or chuckle at Charles Barkley playfully giving the business to Karl Malone, or wonder if Dee Brown was peeking on that no-look dunk. And you certainly can\u2019t count the seconds of hang time executed by the state symbol, a guy named Michael Jordan. Not at this location. Not anymore. You can, however, get your grub on at the deli or take a bike ride or rent a two-bedroom apartment on this patch of land that, for a hot moment, once served as the center of the NBA universe. Charlotte Coliseum is ancient history, abandoned by the NBA over a decade ago, then bulldozed when they paved paradise to put up a parking lot and a mixed-use development. And there\u2019s nothing left to give the slightest hint the All-Star Game dropped by and seized the city for a weekend except your hazy memory. This was in 1991 , the only other time the annual mid-season red-carpet show was held in Charlotte. That\u2019s almost another time and another world, certainly from an optics standpoint. As the NBA\u2019s meal ticket, Jordan owned the entire league back then; now, he just owns one team, the Charlotte Hornets. They play at Spectrum Center in what the locals call uptown \u2014 which is really \u201cdowntown\u201d \u2014 and once built, the arena and surrounding area instantly became the heartbeat of a city that once shut down after happy hour. \u201cIt\u2019s really night and day, compared to the last time we hosted the All-Star Game,\u201d said Fred Whitfield, the president and vice chairman of the Hornets. \u201cIt really has been surreal, to be honest.\u201d But the All-Star Game is back in Charlotte almost three decades later because of what remains unchanged: The appetite for basketball, and of course, the power of Jordan. When the NBA awarded teams to Miami, Orlando, Minnesota and Charlotte in the late 1980s, the expansion cities were promised the All-Star Game as a perk for their $32.5 million fee, which amazingly was considered substantial then. The NBA\u2019s arrival awakened Charlotte, which until then lacked professional sports and therefore was minor league. Any doubts about the NBA\u2019s appeal disappeared almost instantly, when the Hornets lost their first home game by 40 \u2026 and received a standing ovation. That was either a sign of desperation, or appreciation, or both. The home of the Hornets became \u201cThe Hive,\u201d the league\u2019s largest-capacity arena and a quirky one as well; the Coliseum sat on the southern edge of town carved out in the woods. And it was built on a budget at just $52 million, with only six luxury suites. Because it lacked cubbyholes for rich folk, the Coliseum was a dinosaur almost the day it opened and would last only 13 years. But the place catered to pure fans and was a smash hit. The Hornets led the league in attendance in their very first season and at one point sold out 364 straight games. Muggsy Bogues was the biggest man in town, Larry Johnson and his catchy \u201cGrandmama\u201d commercials the biggest woman. Whitfield was a season ticket holder from the start and an executive with Nike then, and like everyone else became sucked in by the NBA and the prestige the league brought to town. Understand that prior to the Hornets, Charlotte was a great place to raise a family and a terrible place to throw a party, and suddenly, there was activity around 7:30 p.m. when the Hornets tipped off. \u201cIt finally put us in the big time,\u201d Whitfield said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just Charlotte; it was a big deal for the entire state to have a professional team. We hadn\u2019t had anything since the ABA and that was many years before.\u201d Three years after the Hornets were born, Charlotte\u2019s turn came up in the All-Star rotation. While Miami offered the chance to frolic on South Beach and Orlando gave everyone a reason to bring the kids along for the theme parks and Prince threw a concert when the All-Stars were in Minnesota, Charlotte offered \u2026 a reason to take a nap. The city then just wasn\u2019t built to entertain an event on a large scale for three days and nights. So it was up to the stars, led by the one who was the biggest and most familiar to the locals. Jordan was born and raised on Carolina clay and made the shot to win the 1982 national championship for UNC, so quite naturally he was the main attraction for All-Star weekend. But first, he and Nike, the company he helped create into a sneaker Goliath, were upstaged by a Celtics rookie wearing revolutionary shoes from an upstart rival named Reebok. Dee Brown was a symbol of a Boston Celtics franchise in transition in the early 1990s. The storied front line of three Hall of Famers was showing hairline cracks. Larry Bird was 34 and dealing with a creaky back, Robert Parish was 37 and Kevin McHale was 33. Fortunately, there was a youth movement \u2014 thanks to trademark clever drafting by the Celtics \u2014 led by Reggie Lewis and Brian Shaw and now Brown. He was a charismatic and athletic 6-foot-1 rookie guard with some serious spring. Brown was a late addition to the dunk contest and not considered a threat in a field that tilted to Shawn Kemp (a lethal dunker and one of the best all time) and Hornets hometown hero Rex Chapman. And yet \u2026 \u201cI was confident,\u201d Brown said. \u201cI grew up watching the dunk contest. It was the marketing event of All-Star weekend because of Dominique (Wilkins) and Spud Webb. I knew what I could do.\u201d Brown recalled walking into the Coliseum and taking a seat next to Kemp on the bench with the other contestants before the dunk-off. \u201cAt that time, me and Shawn had the same haircut,\u201d said Brown. \u201cA few people wanted autographs and one of them looked at me and said, \u2018Hey Shawn, is that your little brother?\u2019 The guy didn\u2019t even know who I was or why I was sitting there. That got me fired up.\u201d Brown quickly established himself as the new flavor, defying the laws of aerodynamics with unexpected hang time, and won over the judges with creativity and a crowd that rooted for the little guy. Back home, a group of business executives took special interest as they watched on TV. Based in Boston, Reebok was a company anxious for traction in the competitive athletic footwear business ruled by Nike. That meant Reebok had to make a splash in the NBA because teenagers increasingly wore basketball sneakers as their everyday footwear of choice. Reebok only had Dominique Wilkins then, and he wasn\u2019t in the dunk contest. But Brown was; Reebok signed him mainly because he was drafted by the hometown Celtics, and so there was anticipation. And then Brown made a spontaneous decision that would turn him and the company into overnight stars. Reebok created a shoe that, with the press of a rubber button on the tongue, would compress around the foot of the wearer, a gimmick more than anything. The \u201cPump\u201d was mostly a curiosity before the dunk contest. After TV cameras caught Brown pumping his shoe before dunking, the \u201cPump\u201d flew off the shelves. \u201cIt was something I made up the day of the contest,\u201d Brown said. \u201cReebok had no clue I was going to do that; they gave me no instructions and I didn\u2019t tell them I was going to do it. I was just trying to get the crowd into it. I didn\u2019t know what the repercussions would be a day later or 10 years later. I had no clue. I was a kid.\u201d Then on his final dunk, Brown pumped his sneaker, and in mid-air, he covered his face and eyes with his forearm and \u2026 well, if social media existed then, it would\u2019ve crashed. When his children see replays of their father\u2019s dunk now, they insist Brown became the first person to \u201cdab.\u201d Either that, or he was checking to see how well his deodorant was holding up. In any event, the improvisation forced future dunkers to get creative. \u201cThat dunk became iconic,\u201d he said. \u201cI figured since I had already won the contest even before that last dunk, I wanted to do something special, something you\u2019d talk about forever. Something like Michael Jordan and Dr. J from the free-throw line. So I just decided I\u2019m going to close my eyes. But as I was running down toward the basket, I was thinking that nobody will know my eyes are closed, so I\u2019ve got to put my hand over my eyes. Organically it went from my hand to my arm and then my elbow. If you look at the pictures, my eyes are closed and my arm is over my eyes, to make double sure.\u201d Brown added: \u201cBack then, you couldn\u2019t use props in the dunk contest. All these guys today jumping over cars, jumping over people, you couldn\u2019t do that. It was a big insurance thing.\u201d It was a game changer for Brown. He soon had his own shoe, which was rare for NBA players then. Fans would now sprint past Bird to get Brown\u2019s autographs on road trips. And whenever Brown dropped an ordinary dunk on a fast break, he\u2019d get booed, so he felt pressure to perform. Bird marveled at the transformation. \u201cBefore,\u201d Bird said, \u201ceverybody wanted to shoot like me. Now everybody wants to dunk like Dee.\u201d Also that day, Chicago Bulls guard Craig Hodges made 19 straight to win the 3-point contest for the second time and would win the next year as well. Nobody has erased either streaks since, although to be fair, most winners rarely compete more than twice anymore. It was ironic that Jordan was upstaged twice in a weekend made for him \u2014 first to a dunker, of all people, then to one of his Bulls teammates. The Saturday contests were a tough act to follow, and the next day it showed in a rather flat All-Star Game, won by the East 116-114 . Bird was a scratch because of injury, same for Isiah Thomas. The game had sloppy stretches, and without Thomas, the East lacked point guards, so Jordan was pressed into that duty. Oh, well: Jordan committed 10 turnovers with his 26 points and while it was an eyesore at times on TV, nobody in North Carolina held it against him. During the game, Wilkins had a breakaway and a chance to give Reebok another weekend highlight \u2026 then he blew the dunk, everyone laughed and he heard it from teammates. \u201cNique forgot to pump up,\u201d said Jordan, the Nike guy issuing a dig. It was that kind of night. Phoenix Suns guard Kevin Johnson had a chance to win it for the West, but his 3-pointer was waved off on basket interference by Malone. They had to give the MVP to someone, and Barkley sheepishly claimed it with just 17 points, among the lowest scoring totals by an MV (although he did have 22 rebounds). At least the game served to certify the comeback by future Hall of Famer Bernard King , who suffered a devastating knee injury six years earlier, and this was before modern surgical techniques. He was warmly applauded by fans and players. Once the circus left town, the basketball aftermath in Charlotte was bittersweet. The Hornets were winners after adding Johnson ( in the 1991 Draft ) and Alonzo Mourning ( in the 1992 Draft ). Mourning was eventually dealt to Miami , Johnson injured his back and owner George Shinn became embroiled in scandal. The Coliseum sellout streak ended and fans, angered by Shinn\u2019s behavior coupled with a losing team, came to games in a trickle. The Hornets fled to New Orleans in 2002 and the NFL replaced basketball as the only game in town. But the NBA promised a return if Charlotte agreed on a new building, and such was the case when the new arena went up and the Hornets were reintroduced in 2004 as the Charlotte Bobcats. By then, Charlotte was flush with new residents and a more vibrant downtown (or uptown), making it prime for the NBA once again, this time in a different part of town. Whitfield recalled that, during the 1991 All-Star Game, he and family and friends \u2014 Jordan among them \u2014 rented a suite at the Morehead Inn , a quaint hotel tucked away in a historic neighborhood, because the city wasn\u2019t exactly over-run with amenities and places to socialize. \u201cMichael would stop by in the evenings because with everything going on around him being back home, it was a comfort zone for him to be able to get away,\u201d said Whitfield. Now as owner of the Hornets, Jordan served as the driving force in Charlotte getting the annual weekend again, almost three decades later, because the league knows the value of keeping an association with the game\u2019s greatest player. Whitfield works directly under Jordan and is the point man in making sure Charlotte is spruced up for the occasion. \u201cThe NBA All-Star Game coming to Charlotte was something we couldn\u2019t believe was reality when it happened the first time,\u201d Whitfield said. \u201cBut right now, with a place that\u2019s suddenly very walkable, with great hotels and restaurants, a lot of activity and our arena right in the middle of all of it, well, this time, we can believe it. We know we belong.\u201d * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years. You can e-mail him here , find his archive here and follow him on Twitter .

A couple quick notes, looking back at my spreadsheet in which I keep track of how the rookies have fared. There\u2019s still a lot of season left, so anything can happen. Injuries (knock on wood we don\u2019t have anything major) could derail seasons and playing time for rookies can increase as teams shift their attention toward the future. With an extended break after the All-Star festivities, we\u2019ll check back Feb. 28 as the second half of the season kicks into high gear. Buckle up, because this rookie class could have a lot of surprises and big moments in store for us. * * * Last week:  No. 1 Count Dwyane Wade as a fan of Doncic. Before Wednesday\u2019s game, Wade raved about what he\u2019d seen from the Mavs\u2019 rookie. \u201cIt seems like he\u2019s been here before already. He\u2019s just very seasoned,\u201d Wade said. \u201cI think Dallas Mavericks fans, NBA fans, sports fans around the world should be excited about what he can do for the next 20 years in this game. \u2026 As a fan of the game, I love watching him play. He does things on the court that wows you.\u201d After the game, Wade compared Doncic\u2019s court vision to that of a certain teammate of his. \u201cQuote me right where I say this \u2014 it\u2019s LeBron James-like from the standpoint of how he\u2019s able to rope that pass to shooters in corners, getting blitzed.\u201d Doncic finished with 18 points, 12 rebounds and nine assists in the Mavs\u2019 112-101 loss to the Heat and finished the week putting up averages of 21.8 points, 8.5 rebounds and 6.3 assists in four games. Last week:  No. 2 Young had one of his best games of the season this week, and he saved it for LeBron James with the Lakers in town. Young had 22 points and 14 assists and several big plays to help Atlanta beat L.A. 117-113 to snap a three-game skid. \u201dI try to live in big moments,\u201d Young said. \u201dI feel like I belong here. He\u2019s one of the best players of all time. But when I\u2019m out on the court, I\u2019m trying to compete and get a win.\u201d In four games this week, Young averaged 18.5 points and 9.3 assists while shooting 42.1 percent overall and 47.6 from beyond the arc. Last week:  No. 4 Despite losing their head-to-head matchup, Ayton climbs past Marvin Bagley this week due to his consistency since returning from his ankle injury. In those six games, the No. 1 overall pick has averaged 17.8 points, 10 rebounds while shooting 54.4 percent from the field in 31.8 minutes per game. Phoenix tends to forget about its big man at times, but when Ayton becomes the focus of the offense and gets involved, he\u2019s tough to stop. He enters the All-Star break as the top rookie rebounder (10.5 rpg) and its No. 3 scorer (16.5 ppg). Last week:  No. 3 Bagley made a statement this week against the Suns with the best game of his young career. Bagley, taken No. 2 overall behind Phoenix\u2019s Ayton, put up a career-high 32 points and grabbed six rebounds to help the Kings to a 117-104 win . Bagley was dominant inside, going 10-for-15 from the field, 11-for-13 from the free-throw line and scored the Kings\u2019 first 12 points in the fourth quarter. Bagley\u2019s week wasn\u2019t all great, though. Two nights earlier, he had just three points in 20 minutes, but it came in a win against the Miami Heat. Bagley\u2019s not worried about stats at this point, as the Kings are in the hunt for a playoff spot in the Western Conference. \u201dWe have this goal in our heads about getting to the playoffs and it\u2019s getting close right now,\u201d Bagley said after Sunday\u2019s win. \u201dEvery game matters. I\u2019m excited, after we get done with this next game [120-118 loss to Denver], how we come back from break and see where we can go from there.\u201d Last week:  Not ranked Sexton is starting to find consistency on the offensive end. In four games this week, Sexton led all rookies in scoring over the past week, averaging 21.8 points on 44.0 percent shooting over four games. He was 43.5 percent on 3-pointers and seems to be showing more confidence in leading the young Cavs, a change Kevin Love has noticed in the 20-year-old rookie. \u201cJust confidence,\u201d Love said. \u201cI mean I think there\u2019s times when he\u2019s just trying to break habits. And being a rookie there\u2019s times where it\u2019s gonna be up and down. But he\u2019s been able to push through. He\u2019s been able to show a lot of bright spots and he\u2019s playing with a lot of confidence. It\u2019s really good to see.\u201d Jaren Jackson Jr., Memphis Grizzlies In four games this week, Jackson averaged 15.5 points and 4.3 rebounds, highlighted by a 27-point outing in a 117-95 loss to the Thunder last Thursday. It was the Grizzlies\u2019 first game after Marc Gasol was traded to Toronto. Jackson came back to earth in the three games since, but you have to imagine he\u2019ll be a focal point in the second half of the season. Landry Shamet, LA Clippers It didn\u2019t take long for Shamet to leave an impact on his new team. In his first game since being dealt to L.A., Shamet helped the Clippers rally from 28-down in Boston , scoring 13 of his 17 points in the fourth quarter. Shamet followed that with 15 points in Minnesota two nights later. Shamet has established himself as one of this class\u2019s best shooters, and he\u2019ll play a big role down the stretch if the Clippers aim to keep their playoff spot. Josh Okogie, Minnesota Timberwolves Okogie\u2019s two-way impact was on full display in Wednesday\u2019s 121-111 win over the Rockets . Okogie scored 16 points, but also made several key stops on James Harden to help seal the win. In one stretch in the third quarter that helped turn the game, Okogie had a crucial strip of Harden, then moments later blocked his step-back 3-pointer to ignite the crowd even further. Okogie\u2019s performance drew praise from teammates and coaches. \u201dWe saw him grow up tonight in a lot of ways, I thought,\u201d Timberwolves interim coach Ryan Saunders said. \u201dIn terms of game plan, following the game plan, just staying within the moment and not getting outside of himself.\u201d Mitchell Robinson, New York Knicks Fellow rookies Kevin Knox and Allonzo Trier have gotten most of the spotlight so far, but Robinson is making his mark. Over the past five games, the second-round pick (36th overall) has averaged 12.6 points. 8.8 rebounds and 2.8 blocks, while shooting 74.3 percent from the field. After Wednesday\u2019s 126-111 loss to the Sixers \u2014 in which Robinson had 14 points, 13 rebounds and four blocks \u2014 Philly\u2019s Joel Embiid spoke highly of the Knicks\u2019 rookie. \u201cHe has a lot of potential. He needs to work on his body, but he\u2019s got a chance to be a good big man in this league. \u2026 A couple times I thought I had a shot, but he just came up with his long-ass arms and blocked it.\u201d * * * ( All stats through Wednesday, Feb. 13 ) Send any qfuestions or comments to my email or find me on Twitter @drewpackham .

Portland led 110-103 before Green was called for a flagrant foul on the Blazers\u2019 Zach Collins with 3:54 left. Kerr reacted angrily, throwing his clipboard to the court and yelling at the officials before he was ejected. Referee Ken Mauer called Kerr for a technical foul immediately, which only angered Kerr more. He then threw out his right arm and fumed some more, which led to his ejection by Mauer. Warriors star Kevin Durant held Kerr back after the ejection, and Green was whistled for a technical foul of his own, too, during the sequence. After the game, Kerr told reporters he thought Green\u2019s foul on Collins was \u201ca good, hard foul.\u201d \u201cI was just shocked that was called a flagrant foul. I\u2019m not sure how it was determined. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s determined in New York or if it\u2019s the officials on the floor,\u201d Kerr said, per Mark Medina of The Mercury News . \u201cThat was head scratching that could be called a flagrant foul. The guy is going in for a dunk, you have to make sure he doesn\u2019t dunk it. I told Kenny that I beg to differ.\u201d Portland\u2019s Damian Lillard made the three technical shots and Collins made his free throws to give Portland a 115-103 lead. Jake Layman then added a 3-pointer to all but seal the win. The Warriors finished with just 12 points in the final quarter. Green, however, praised Kerr for standing up for him: \u201dThat was amazing, he was great. I enjoyed that.\u201d Kerr said he is awaiting further word from the league on the changed call. \u201dWe\u2019ll obviously get an explanation from the league, but I just thought it was a good, hard foul,\u201d Kerr said. \u201dI guess I was wrong.\u201d Green said after the game he was victim of \u201cthe Draymond rule,\u201d which he says means he gets officiated a certain way in games. \u201cI knew they would look at it because they always look at fouls with me,\u201d Green said, per The Mercury News . \u201cBut whatever.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve been officiated a certain way for years. It\u2019s noting new to me. It is what it is. I don\u2019t really care.\u201d Green has 12 technical fouls this season, and another four will lead to an NBA-imposed one-game suspension. Teammate Stephen Curry said the changed call \u201cwas a horrible call\u201d and thought \u201cnothing was excessive\u201d regarding Green\u2019s foul on Collins. Golden State played shorthanded against Portland, resting DeMarcus Cousins, Andre Iguodala and Shaun Livingston for various reasons. Kerr said before the game that Cousins and Livingston got the night off because of the back-to-back games, and Iguodala was additionally a \u201dlittle banged up.\u201d The game first got testy midway through the quarter when Durant pushed Blazers center Jusuf Nurkic after the two appeared to exchange words, but the officials quickly diffused the situation. In the fourth quarter, Collins and Klay Thompson exchanged words, and the frustration spilled over to players from both sides. The two players were given offsetting technical fouls with 7:32 left in the game.

With a four-point play midway through the third quarter of Wednesday\u2019s 121-111 loss to the Timberwolves in Minnesota, Houston Rockets guard James Harden surpassed 30 points for the 31st consecutive game , tying NBA legend Wilt Chamberlain for the second-longest string of such performances. Harden, who finished the game with 42 points, has averaged 41.5 points , 7.6 rebounds and 7.4 assists (5.2 turnovers) while shooting 44.0 percent from the field and 37.4 percent from 3-point range. The Rockets are 21-10 since the streak began on December 13 against the Lakers. https:\/\/twitter.com\/HoustonRockets\/status\/1095873845578395648 However, after the game, Harden wasn\u2019t in much of a mood to talk about his latest scoring exploits. \u201cTo me, we have no tendencies right now. The tendency is just to come out slow in the third quarters,\u201d he said. Chamberlain also holds the all-time record at 65 straight games, set during his astounding 1961-62 campaign, when he averaged an NBA-record 50.4 points and set the single-game scoring mark with 100 points against the New York Knicks on March 2, 1962.

Per Jonathan Feigen of the Houston Chronicle : The 24-year-old has missed the past 15 games with a right thumb injury suffered at Orlando on January 13th , and had broken out to start the season, averaging a career-best line of 17.6 points (63.1 field goal percentage), 12.6 rebounds and 1.8 blocks in 34.2 minutes per game through the first 42 games. Houston has been outrebounded in 12-of-14 games without Capela and by 8.1 rpg (114 total) during that span, vs. a 1.2 rpg deficit prior.

What about Okogie?","content":" By now, we know that James Harden is going to get his points. Thirty-one straight games with 30 or more points is evidence of that. Only Wilt Chamberlain has a longer scoring streak in league history. But will the Houston Rockets get the win? Harden \u2014 with rookie Georgia Tech product Josh Okogie acting as chief irritant and making it tough down the stretch \u2014 still scored 42. He had 30-plus midway through the third quarter, with many of the shots over Okogie. But it wasn\u2019t an easy 42 points, and Karl-Anthony Towns noted after the Timberwolves\u2019 121-111 win that Okogie had made Harden work for it. A key moment came late in the third quarter. Okogie had stripped Harden a few plays earlier, and Harden was in position for one of his trademark step-back 3-point attempts. Okogie, rather than taking the drive-forward bait, anticipated the move and leaped forward, blocking the shot before it could leave Harden\u2019s hands. It was a rare stuff of Harden\u2019s patented step-back. Okogie also did well offensively, scoring 16 points. But it was his defensive effort, combined with Towns\u2019 25 points and Jeff Teague\u2019s 27 points and 12 assists, that lifted the Timberwolves. Golden State has won 15 of its last 20, but the reigning champs appeared to run out of gas in a chippy contest with the Portland Trail Blazers. Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry each scored 32 points, but neither star scored in the fourth quarter and the Blazers moved ahead for a 129-117 win . With Damian Lillard leading the Blazers\u2019 balanced attack, the Warriors were outscored 35-12 in the fourth. Lillard scored 29 points as DeMarcus Cousins rested for the Warriors. Seven other players scored in double-figures for Portland, including all the starters. Portland led 110-103 before Draymond Green was called for a flagrant foul on Zach Collins with 3:54 left. Collins and Klay Thompson exchanged words earlier, and were separated. Warriors coach Steve Kerr went into a tirade following the flagrant-one call on Green, throwing down his clipboard and yelling red-faced at the officials before he was ejected. On an 11-game night with several of the league\u2019s best teams matched up, you might not have expected a meeting of the Brooklyn Nets and Cleveland Cavaliers to take the spotlight. But a triple-overtime tends to grab attention. This one had it all, stellar play in overtime and desperation shots that fell to extend the game. DeMarre Carroll, who drove to the wing after being double-teamed near the corner, drilled a three at the second-overtime buzzer to tie it up again. D\u2019Angelo Russell, who will be playing in his first All-Star Game this weekend , scored 14 points in the third overtime for the Nets and finished with 36. Joe Harris contributed 25 and Carroll totaled 18 as the Nets outlasted the Cavaliers 148-139 in their final games before the All-Star break. Jordan Clarkson poured in a career-high 42 for the Cavaliers. Isaiah Thomas was greeted with a standing ovation from Nuggets fans when he entered an NBA game for the first time in 11 months. Thomas\u2019 last appearance was March 22, with the Los Angeles Lakers, before undergoing an arthroscopic procedure to fix his troublesome hip, which he first injured while with the Boston Celtics a year prior. The Nuggets signed him to a one-year contract in the offseason and have allowed him time to recover. The diminutive guard saw limited action, playing 13 minutes in the Nuggets\u2019 thrilling 120-118 win over the Kings. He finished with eight points, including this 3-pointer. On the NBA field of battle, sometimes you\u2019re the conqueror \u2014 and other times you\u2019re the vanquished. Last season\u2019s Kia Rookie of the Year Ben Simmons, no slouch when it comes to dunking, found himself on the posterized side of the ledger on back-to-back nights this week as he tried to deny opponents at the rim. Wednesday night, Knicks rookie Kevin Knox skied and dropped a two-handed smash on Simmons. Tuesday night, in case you missed it, Simmons was victimized by the Celtics\u2019 Jayson Tatum, who drove, spun and rose for a nice tomahawk slam. As he should, Dwyane Wade is having a lot of fun in his \u201clast dance\u201d season with the Miami Heat. Before the Heat vs. Dallas Mavericks tipoff, Wade relived one of the best moments of his 15-year career: the ball launch beginning the celebration of the Heat\u2019s 2006 NBA Finals victory over the Mavs. Another memory was made when Wade and Mavericks legend Dirk Nowitzki, 41 and possibly in his final season as well, exchanged jerseys after the game. During the Heat\u2019s 112-101 victory , Mavs coach Rick Carlisle had Nowitzki enter the game when he saw Wade at the scorer\u2019s table. The pair shared a laugh upon entering the game. Wade was a factor, scoring 22 points in 22 minutes. It was the eighth time he\u2019s scored 20-plus this season. It didn\u2019t take long for the Toronto Raptors to put Jeremy Lin to work after he was signed Wednesday afternoon . The crowd in Toronto, which remembers Lin from the splash he made with the New York Knicks in the 2011-12 season, greeted Lin with a warm ovation when he entered the game vs. the Wizards in the first quarter Wednesday night. Lin, now a much-traveled veteran, electrified the league in 2012 when he fired up the Knicks and became the first player in NBA history to record at least 20 points and seven assists in his first five starts (Feb. 6-14, 2012). Lin finished with eight points, five assists and five rebounds in his Raptors debut, a 129-120 victory . Just how bad is it for the Knicks after their 18th straight loss, this one a 126-111 drubbing at the hands of Joel Embiid and the 76ers at Madison Square Garden? Well, 38 other sports teams and an animal have more wins at MSG since the Knicks last home victory. Joel Embiid came close to taking out Oscar-nominated actress Regina King as he chased a loose ball, jumping all the way over her and grazing her hair after tossing the ball back on court. For her part, King was also relieved:"},{"id":35556,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-isaiah-thomas-could-make-denver-nuggets-debut-wednesday","date":"2019-02-14","title":"Thomas \"available to play\" vs. Kings","content":"DENVER (AP) \u2014 Isaiah Thomas pronounced his surgically repaired hip as fit as it\u2019s ever going to be. His confidence? Now that\u2019s as healthy as ever with the point guard on the verge of his Denver Nuggets debut. \u201cMy job is not to fit in. It\u2019s to stand out,\u201d said Thomas, who\u2019s looking to play Wednesday night against the Sacramento Kings, the team that picked him in the second round of the 2011 draft. \u201cI\u2019m going to do whatever I can to get minutes on the basketball floor and I\u2019m going to play to win and help this team get to the next level.\u201d Thomas\u2019 last NBA game was March 22 with the Los Angeles Lakers before undergoing an arthroscopic procedure to fix his troublesome hip. The Nuggets signed him to a one-year deal in the offseason and gave him plenty of space to recover from his operation. He could provide a big boost down the stretch for the surging Nuggets, who are near the top of the Western Conference standings. His minutes, though, could come at the expense of Monte Morris and Malik Beasley, two young guards who have been pleasant surprises for the Nuggets this season. Thomas doesn\u2019t think the chemistry will be altered in the least for a team that\u2019s rolling along. After all, he\u2019s played an integral part in creating it, with his robust personality in the locker room and on the bench. \u201cIt\u2019s a great group of guys that don\u2019t have any egos,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cI\u2019ve been on a few teams like that to where guys don\u2019t care about who gets the success. We just care about winning. Since Day 1 when I came here, I\u2019ve seen that. We just care about getting wins and getting better each and every day. That\u2019s a good sign when you have that.\u201d Thomas only recently returned to 5-on-5 action with the team. Before that he was going through rehab and, on the road, looking for friendly pick-up games at local gyms in order to get his cardio and rhythm back. Take things nice and slow \u2013 all part of the master plan for Thomas and the Nuggets. \u201cI\u2019m going to be patient with my body. I\u2019m going to be patient with my game, knowing that it\u2019s going to take a while,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cIt took me years to get to an MVP level, and I know it\u2019s going to take me a while to get back to that level and get back to feeling like that player again. I\u2019m just going to take it day-by-day and continue to get better each day.\u201d Thomas, who turned 30 last week, has averaged 18.9 points over a career that\u2019s included 473 games with Sacramento, Phoenix, Boston, Cleveland and the Lakers. It\u2019s been an arduous journey back from hip surgery, but the persistent pain is finally alleviated. \u201cI don\u2019t feel what I felt last year. That has left my body,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cI got a goal that I want to reach. I want to be one of the best players that ever played the game. There\u2019s no quit in me. This is just a part of my story, and I\u2019m going to just continue to grind, continue to keep going, and continue to listen to my body and hopefully I can help this team take the next step.\u201d As for what he brings to the floor, easy: Competitiveness. \u201cA guy that makes a difference out there. Plays to win,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cScores the basketball, makes plays. I know it\u2019s not all going to come back right away, so I\u2019m not putting any pressure on myself, but at some point in time, it will come back and the world will know.\u201d The world certainly is familiar with his compelling backstory: The 5-foot-9 Thomas was the last pick in the 2011 draft. He defied the odds and became a two-time All-Star. He helped carry the Celtics in the 2017 postseason despite a balky hip and a broken heart following his sister\u2019s death in a car crash. \u201cOne of the biggest things is they\u2019ve seen what I went through a couple years ago with the passing of my sister, and how I pushed through. It wasn\u2019t just me, though, it was like the world helped me get through that,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cI know my story\u2019s inspirational to all the kids around the world. \u201cThey kind of gravitate to stories like that.

Guys being counted out.\u201d"},{"id":35521,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/76ers-joel-embiid-fined-official-release","date":"2019-02-13","title":"76ers' Embiid fined for criticism of officiating","content":" NEW YORK \u2014 Philadelphia 76ers center Joel Embiid has been fined $25,000 for public criticism of the officiating, which included the use of inappropriate language, it was announced today by Kiki VanDeWeghe, Executive Vice President, Basketball Operations.

This immediately caused a stir. It then became an uproar, and soon enough, a perfect storm. And to think, all a rookie named Michael Jordan wanted to do that weekend in Indianapolis , his first as a certified star, was to quietly fit in. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be perceived as having an arrogant attitude,\u201d he said. This particular revolution began unintentionally before it developed spectacularly. By every metric, Jordan and the company he represented, the industry they wanted to dominate and the league that needed him were never the same again. Because when you begin to chart how the sport\u2019s most successful pitchman helped make Nike the biggest player in the shoe game, their push that weekend put everything in motion. But that moment in 1985 goes deeper than Jordan and Nike. This is about a young Jordan\u2019s entry into the stratosphere of fellow stars like Magic Johnson, Julius Erving and Larry Bird, who at the time had bigger basketball cred. It\u2019s also about the clumsiness caused by that dunk contest outfit on All-Star Weekend (which led to the monster of all NBA conspiracy theories: The Freeze-Out). Understand that the basketball world was different then, completely foreign to anyone born after, say, \u201cSpace Jam.\u201d All-Star weekend wasn\u2019t the celebrity-infused spectacle it is today. ESPN showed strongman competitions. Social media was more than 20 years away. Jordan was a rising star for sure, but nobody saw the Babe Ruth of basketball or a trend-setting king of product endorsement in his future. That\u2019s important for the purpose of context. And more incredibly, there was also this: Jordan wanted no part of Nike initially. Jordan played at North Carolina, which was then a Converse school \u2014 ironically, UNC now wears Jordan Brand \u2014 and Jordan also loved Adidas. After being named college player of the year and then starring for the 1984 Olympic team, Jordan was in demand by the shoe companies \u2014 and he wanted Adidas. Howard White, a Nike executive who became close to Jordan, knew the company needed a big name to get traction into the basketball culture, but the turf was taken. At the time, the status basketball shoe was probably the Converse Weapon, worn by a handful of NBA stars including Magic and Bird. \u201cConverse was the pre-eminent shoe brand,\u201d White said. \u201cAnyone who was anyone wore Converse: Magic, Bird, Isiah [Thomas]. Then Nike came along. We got a few players but we still needed more.\u201d Jordan\u2019s agent was David Falk, a 33-year-old who worked for an agency that repped tennis players and was not yet the powerbroker he soon came to be. As Falk recently recalled, he tried to convince Jordan to weigh all offers. \u201cHe didn\u2019t want Nike,\u201d said Falk. \u201cHe didn\u2019t even want to get on the plane to meet with Nike. I appealed to his parents that it was important he go on the trip and they finally talked him into it. He went and they did an amazing job in their presentation.\u201d Nike made a highlight montage of Jordan in college while \u201cJump\u201d by the Pointer Sisters and another version of \u201cJump\u201d by Van Halen played in the background. It was a music video, back when young people actually watched music videos, this one starring Jordan. \u201cHe loved it,\u201d said Falk. \u201cWhen the meeting was over, he said he didn\u2019t want to take any more trips. But we did. We met with all of them. Then I told Nike they would have to come out with a line of shoes and clothes. They asked me what they wanted the line to be called. I thought for about 30 seconds and it just popped into my mind: Air Jordan.\u201d It was borrowed from \u201cAir Coryell,\u201d the nickname given to the Don Coryell-coached San Diego Chargers who threw the ball often. But it was a better fit in the case of Jordan. The NBA game was still dominated by big men and therefore most players were gravitationally challenged, with few exceptions, such as Erving and Jordan\u2019s idol, David Thompson. Suddenly, \u201cAir Jordan\u201d tapped into the fantasy of a culture that was changing demographically and where the congregation dreamed of being suspended high above heads and shoulders, a place where spectacular happens \u2014 essentially, to be able to fly. With Jordan playing above the rim and also sensationally as a rookie, he was fresh and different and Nike, which mainly catered to runners, was also fresh and different to the basketball world. Falk was also smart to demand constant marketing of Jordan, and his commercials (some by Spike Lee and his alter ego, Mars Blackmon, yelling, \u201cGotta be the shoes!\u201d ) were done smartly. The timing of the partnership couldn\u2019t be more right. Nike gave Jordan $500,000 a year for five years, five times more than any NBA player earned in shoe endorsements. There was a catch: If Jordan didn\u2019t sell $4 million of shoes by the third year, Nike could void the deal. Nike sold $70 million worth of Air Jordans the first three months they hit the stores. Falk said: \u201cIn the first year they sold $126 million worth. They outsold every basketball shoe in the first year.\u201d Back then, the league had strict dress code rules that applied to sneakers as well, and initially refused to allow Jordan to wear a color-coded style of the Air Jordan I. Of course, that ban was like Elvis shaking his hips. It appealed to rebellious teenagers, which meant sales kept soaring. Since the dunk contest wasn\u2019t a sanctioned NBA game, Jordan wore the shoes without catching heat from the league. And rather than represent his team as others did in the contest by wearing a Bulls warmup, Jordan went against the trend a second time. \u201cThere was no rules; it\u2019s not like you had to wear a team warmup,\u201d said Falk. \u201cSo he asks, \u2018What should I wear? Would it be cool to wear the Nike stuff?\u2019 No other player could\u2019ve asked that question because nobody else had their own stuff. Nobody else had their own line. \u201cHe didn\u2019t do it to promote the line. He did it because it was his stuff and he liked it and it was an informal contest.\u201d Given the size of his shoe deal, and the sales of his shoes, and the decision to wear a Nike warmup in the contest, a rookie stirred professional jealousy among other veteran All-Stars. Howard White said: \u201cFor a guy to show up in his own stuff, well, none of those guys had that. He was going against the norm. He caught a lot of flak from the guys.\u201d Dominique Wilkins, like Jordan, was younger than most of the others in the dunk contest, was from another generation and therefore loved it. \u201cMan, Michael didn\u2019t do anything wrong from my view,\u201d said Wilkins. \u201cBut I could understand if some of the old school guys had a problem with it. It wasn\u2019t traditional. Sometimes, when you\u2019re the first to do something, others might say, \u2018Why didn\u2019t I think of that?\u2019 This was probably the case.\u201d The dunk contest was the perfect laboratory for introducing something fresh because it was all about soaring and improvisation and excitement. The league stole the dunk contest from the ABA a year earlier and used it as a vehicle to exploit Erving. It also discouraged big men, and therefore catered to more normal-sized players that the everyday fan could relate to. This all played right into the hands of Jordan and Nike. He didn\u2019t win; the 1985 trophy went to Wilkins , but the exposure was greater than any title, which Jordan would eventually win anyway. \u201cIt was something bigger than all of us coming together,\u201d said White. Jordan then looked forward to playing the next day in the 1985 All-Star Game and perhaps dunking in game competition, but only took nine shots, fewest among the East starters. Within hours after the game, word circulated among the media that Jordan was victim of a payback, with Isiah Thomas as the ringleader. To this day, \u201cfreeze-out\u201d in basketball is never linked to a road trip in Minneapolis. It\u2019s always about Jordan and Isiah and that game, and because everyone loves a conspiracy theory, it was never put to rest. Falk believes it, still: \u201cThe minute all the reporters asked him the question, Michael has a photographic memory, so he replayed the game in his mind, and on defense they came at him every time, and on offense Isiah never gave him the ball. Can you prove it there was a freeze out? No, it\u2019s not a provable fact. But everybody knows it.\u201d White believes it: \u201cThey were either freezing him out or teaching him a lesson. Like, \u2018Here is this rookie, who does he think he is?\u2019 \u201d Jordan, when pressed by reporters, initially refused to believe it. He said then: \u201cI think Isiah played it correctly. It\u2019s hard to define why Isiah didn\u2019t give me the ball more. Maybe I didn\u2019t have the easy shot at the time. I\u2019m not questioning that.\u201d Isiah has always called baloney on this, denying any collective effort to embarrass Jordan, and circumstantial evidence bears this out. It was never evident among the broadcasters on air who didn\u2019t suspect anything was odd; Thomas only ignored Jordan twice on fast breaks, when he passed to Moses Malone (\u201crewarding the big man,\u201d said Thomas) and then faking to Jordan for his own layup. If anything, Thomas said the East players were trying to feed the ball to Larry Bird, who was back home in Indiana. Bird took 16 shots, one fewer than Terry Cummings. \u201cI challenge anyone to find spots where we as teammates deliberately chose not to give Michael the ball,\u201d Thomas said. Whether the freeze-out was real or imagined, Jordan used it anyway as rocket fuel and held a grudge against Thomas for years. \u201cWhen we returned to his apartment, he\u2019d turned off the heat and so the pipes burst,\u201d said Falk. \u201cHe\u2019s like steaming in the freezing apartment. We\u2019re watching TV and I told him, \u2018Don\u2019t get mad, get even.\u2019 By a fluke of fate, the first game back was against the Pistons, and Michael had 49 points .\u201d The dunk contest wardrobe, the so-called freeze out and the harsh Jordan response against the Pistons was the kind of marketing Nike couldn\u2019t buy. It had a domino effect and launched an empire. \u201cNike at the time was tiny, just trying to grow,\u201d said Falk. \u201cThe history of the company was in running, not basketball, because the owner, Phil Knight, was a track guy. They were just looking to expand the business and they signed the right guy. There were a lot of great players who had flair. But Michael had everything. He had the basics. He learned under Dean Smith who taught him how to play. He was a cerebral player with a high degree of competitiveness and he had athletic ability. \u201cNobody had a clue how great a player he would become. He wasn\u2019t LeBron. He was the No. 3 pick, and people questioned his shooting. People thought he\u2019d probably be exciting. Nobody had a clue he\u2019d make the kind of impact he made in marketing. Nobody.\u201d Apparently, plenty agreed with Spike Lee that it must be the shoes, because Nike is now a global Goliath. And Jordan is a sports icon who has his own line, Jordan Brand, which has made him a billionaire. Some 15 years after he retired and over 30 years since the dunk contest that helped create a revolution, Jordan is still selling sneakers. It\u2019s a funny thing, how Falk compares Jordan to Converse, whose sneaker Jordan wore and loved in college. \u201cMany years ago I told Michael the young people who will be buying his shoes one day will have no idea he played basketball,\u201d Falk said. \u201cHe thought I was crazy.\u201d * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

Young, who recorded 22 points and 14 assists, found himself guarded by James throughout the night and showcased a fearless attitude. While the rookie point guard didn\u2019t shoot particularly well overall \u2014 going 6-of-19 from the floor \u2014 all three of his 2-point field goals came when he was matched up against LeBron. His first bucket of the night came when he caught the Lakers star taking a bad angle to come out and guard him. He later blew past LeBron in a half-court set to extend the Hawks lead to seven. And with 1:28 remaining and Atlanta up five once again, the poised Rising Star got the matchup he liked in the pick-and-roll, slashed to the rim and made a clutch basket despite LeBron hacking him. Oh, and he even nutmegged The King earlier on a pocket pass that ended in Omari Spellman taking free throws (he made 1 of 2). \u201cI try to live in big moments,\u201d said Young, who is averaging 21.8 points and 8.8 assists during Atlanta\u2019s last 10 games, while shooting 46.2 percent from the field and 42 percent from beyond the arc. \u201cIt was definitely surreal the first time [we played the Lakers], but at the same time, I feel like I belong here. [LeBron\u2019s] obviously done tremendous things, he\u2019s one of the best players of all-time. But when we get on the court, I\u2019m trying to compete. I\u2019m trying to get a win.\u201d That fearless attitude \u2014 mixed with his potent ability to run the pick-and-roll as seen above \u2014 should continue to bode well for Young and the developing Hawks. As for the Lakers, this is the latest in a season a James-led team has been under .500 since his first year in the league in 2003-04. Asked when the Lakers should start worrying about missing the playoffs, James said, \u201cYou either make it or you don\u2019t make it. That\u2019s when you worry about it.\u201d  Despite the loss (and some uninspired defense), James still poured in 28 points, 11 rebounds and 16 assists. He\u2019s the first player since Magic Johnson in 1990 to reach those totals in a Lakers uniform. It was also the 78th triple-double of his career, which ties Wilt Chamberlain for fifth in NBA history. LeBron\u2019s 16 assists were the most by a Laker since Kobe Bryant dished a career-high 17 against the Cavaliers in 2015. Speaking of LeBron and Kobe\u2026 Clearly no one is safe when the Lakers are at the line . \u201cThis is not a rivalry\u2026 They always kick our [expletive].\u201d Those words from Joel Embiid came after Philadelphia\u2019s season-opening loss to Boston in October, and while Tuesday\u2019s game wasn\u2019t a beatdown, the Kyrie-less Celtics were still too much for the loaded Sixers, winning 112-109 . This time, however, the Sixers center opted to excoriate the officials after the game. \u201cThe referees [expletive] suck,\u201d said Embiid, who can undoubtedly expect a fine on Wednesday. The All-Star big man is likely referring to a no-call from the officials with 33.9 seconds left, when Embiid was challenged by Al Horford, who was credited with a block. The Magic, winners of four straight, dismantled the Pelicans 118-88 in New Orleans for their biggest road victory in a decade. Orlando came out on fire, while New Orleans was flat from the jump. In the game\u2019s first 10 minutes, Magic starters Evan Fournier had 14 points and Jonathan Isaac had 11. The Pelicans had nine. Even more disconcerting for New Orleans was the play of Davis, who said after the game it appeared \u201cnobody was interested in playing.\u201d Does Davis fall in that category? The disgruntled star who requested a trade last month had one of the worst showings of his career. He didn\u2019t make his first field goal \u2014 which was also his only \u2014 until there was 9:57 to go in the third quarter. That\u2019s the latest he\u2019s gone without buying his first basket since the 2013-14 season. The Pelicans star forward also posted a 32.9 offensive rating, his lowest ever in a game in which he played at least 20 minutes, per StatMuse .  This past weekend Marcus Morris emphatically critiqued the Celtics\u2019 unity, adding when he looks at teams around the league \u201cguys are up on the bench, they\u2019re jumping on the court\u2026 they\u2019re enjoying their teammates\u2019 success.\u201d Well, no question the Celtics bench enjoyed this throw down by Jayson Tatum. One more look at the dunk in real speed.  A quick ball-fake from C.J. Miles ended with Marco Belinelli taking a seat and even pulling out the recliner.

Westbrook notched 21 points, 14 rebounds and 11 assists on Monday against the visiting Portland Trail Blazers to secure his 10th straight game with a triple-double in the Thunder\u2019s 120-111 win. By reaching 10 straight, he breaks the single-season mark for consecutive triple-doubles he had tied with Wilt Chamberlain, who had nine straight in 1968. Not only did Westbrook set that record in this game, but he and teammate Paul George combined for one as well. George had 47 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists \u2014 his first triple-double since the 2013-14 season \u2014 as he and Westbrook became the first teammates to record 20-point triple-doubles in the same game. Here\u2019s a look at each of Westbrook\u2019s triple-double stat lines during the streak: After the game, Westbrook downplayed his latest feat. \u201cI just go play the game the right way,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s what I do. Go out and compete every night and leave it on the floor, and whatever happens, happens. I\u2019m very, very blessed to be able to go out and play, and I don\u2019t take it for granted.\u201d Westbrook clinched the record on an assist to George for a 3-pointer with 3:52 remaining in the fourth quarter. \u201cI thought he had it already,\u201d George joked after Monday\u2019s win. \u201cUsually, Russ has that by the first quarter. I didn\u2019t know it was that close.\u201d Westbrook made a 3-pointer in the final minute that gave George his triple-double. Westbrook told George that he was one assist away. \u201cYeah, we talked about it right before that play,\u201d George said. \u201cWe talked about it. I was clueless at that moment. But he told me the situation. So, it\u2019s cool to be on the other end of the triple-double.\u201d Westbrook figured he might as well get a different kind of assist. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing to go out and compete,\u201d he said, \u201cto see your teammate, your brother, do amazing things, and you can be right on the side of him doing something special as well.\u201d This isn\u2019t the only triple-double feat Westbrook has accomplished this season, though. In a win against the Brooklyn Nets on Dec. 5, he collected his 108th career triple-double, passing Jason Kidd for third on the all-time list. His triple-double on Feb. 5 was his seventh straight in the current run, making him the first player since Michael Jordan during the 1988-89 season to reach that number. The only other players in NBA history with a streak as long are Chamberlain and Oscar Robertson. Last season, in a March 13 win in Atlanta, he recorded his 100th career triple-double. He became the third-fastest player to 100 (736 games), trailing only Robertson (277 games) and Magic Johnson (656). Of the other 29 NBA franchises, 24 have fewer triple-doubles in their entire team history than the 126 that Westbrook has logged in his career. Since he entered the league in 2008, he holds more than twice as many as any other NBA franchise during that timeframe (the Cleveland Cavaliers have 48). Oklahoma City has gone 17-6 this season when Westbrook registers a triple-double and holds a 103-24 (.811) record over the course of his career. Westbrook finished 2017 with 38 triple-doubles, the most in a calendar year in NBA history ahead of Robertson\u2019s 34 in 1961, beating his previous record of 31 from 2016 (per Elias Sports Bureau). On the final night of last season, Westbrook became the first player to average a triple-double in back-to-back seasons. He got that achievement by snaring rebound No. 16 with just over nine minutes left in the third quarter against the Memphis Grizzlies in OKC\u2019s final game of the season. A standing ovation ensued and Westbrook finished with just six points, but had a career-high 20 rebounds and 19 assists. His first triple-double season \u2014 in 2016-17 \u2014 culminated with Westbrook winning Kia MVP honors . Westbrook finished 2016-17 averaging 31.6 points, 10.7 rebounds and 10.4 assists. That made him the first player to average a triple-double for a season since the Hall of Famer Robertson accomplished the feat in 1961-62 .

In a statement issued Tuesday, the NBA said: \u201c We have concluded that Magic Johnson\u2019s statements regarding Ben Simmons do not constitute a tampering violation. The Philadelphia 76ers initiated the contact with the Los Angeles Lakers by requesting a meeting between Johnson and Simmons. Both organizations ultimately concluded that such a meeting did not make sense at this time but in that context, Johnson\u2019s response to a media inquiry regarding Simmons does not run afoul of league rules.\u201d The NBA\u2019s relatively quick-moving investigation was initiated after it was revealed that Simmons wanted to meet with Johnson to talk about the art of being an elite point guard. Johnson complimented Simmons publicly on Sunday. \u201cI love his game. I love his vision,\u201d Johnson said. The NBA was slated to investigate whether league rules were broken when Simmons inquired about meeting with Johnson for playing tips. League spokesman Mike Bass had said Monday that the NBA planned to look into the matter. Johnson revealed over the weekend that Simmons expressed a desire to meet, through an intermediary, and indicated that he would be willing to partake in such a session with the 76ers\u2019 starting point guard if all parties involved granted permission. Per ESPN\u2019s Ramona Shelburne , 76ers general manager Elton Brand called Johnson on Monday afternoon to apologize for insinuating in a radio interview that the Lakers had placed an unprompted call to ask for permission for Johnson to speak with Simmons. Brand told Philadelphia radio station WPEN that when the request was made about a month ago, he declined. Brand said it was presented by members of Simmons\u2019 inner circle as a way last season\u2019s rookie of the year could raise his game by learning from various greats, and Johnson\u2019s name was on their list. Brand also told the radio station that Lakers general manager Rob Pelinka asked if such a meeting could take place. \u201cRob Pelinka called me and said `Hey, we\u2019re hearing Ben wants to talk to Hall of Famers, championship-level players, and Magic\u2019s on the list. We need authorization for him to meet up,\u201d\u2018 Brand told the radio station. \u201cAnd I said `No.\u2019 This is over a month ago, so I said no. \u2026 We didn\u2019t sign off on whatever they\u2019re talking about.\u201d The Lakers responded Monday by saying the notion of Simmons meeting with Johnson was first raised in November in an email. The Lakers also confirmed that Pelinka reached out to Brand. \u201cThat was the end of the matter,\u201d the Lakers said in a statement. Johnson said Sunday that when Simmons reached out in an indirect way about getting together, he responded by saying that the NBA, the 76ers and the Lakers would all have to sign off on such a meeting before one could be scheduled. \u201cIf everybody doesn\u2019t sign off, then we can\u2019t get together,\u201d Johnson said. Brand told the station that he may be willing to permit the meeting if he was present. The NBA is taking tampering concerns particularly seriously of late, and the Lakers have been on the league\u2019s radar before. They were fined $50,000 last year when Johnson commented to ESPN about Milwaukee star Giannis Antetokounmpo. And in 2017, the Lakers were fined $500,000 when the league found Pelinka had been communicating with Paul George\u2019s agent while George was with the Indiana Pacers. Like Simmons, Johnson was bigger-than-most point guard. Johnson is 6-foot-9, Simmons is listed at 6-foot-10. \u201cI love also, too, in terms of basketball IQ \u2026 he\u2019s very high basketball IQ. And look at him now. The East better watch out,\u201d Johnson said Sunday. Said Simmons, when asked later Sunday about Johnson: \u201cTo learn from somebody like that would be huge.\u201d Brand didn\u2019t sound worried that Simmons has any desire to change teams soon. \u201cHe\u2019s really happy here in Philadelphia,\u201d Brand told the radio station. Simmons is represented by Rich Paul, the agent that also represents Lakers star LeBron James, among others.

But there was a sense around the Milwaukee Bucks Monday night that co-owner Marc Lasry getting fined $25,000 by the NBA for tampering might be good for the franchise\u2019s street cred. The idea that Milwaukee \u2014 Milwaukee! \u2014 might be a destination market enticing enough to threaten another organization is a first. The Bucks aren\u2019t a team that tampers. The Bucks are a team that gets tampered with . Last week, Rich Paul \u2014 the agent for New Orleans Pelicans star Anthony Davis \u2014 ramped up trade speculation by issuing a short list of teams to which Davis would consider being dealt. On it: two teams in Los Angeles, one in New York and \u2026 Milwaukee? Many took that as a smokescreen, the Bucks added to the list presumably for their current winning ways but mostly to help blur the perception that Davis and the Lakers were destined for each other. Lasry\u2019s comments in a Sporting News story , however, got the league\u2019s attention. \u201cI saw that report, and I think it\u2019s great. It\u2019s a little bit of what we want. We want players to come and play in Milwaukee,\u201d he said. Lasry also was quoted: \u201cWe hope it would be players like Anthony Davis and others who want to come to Milwaukee.\u201d The Bucks, however, would be more than happy at this stage to go about their business as they see it, pushing forward in the Eastern Conference atop which they currently sit. They added to their talent base (Nikola Mirotic) and dispatched someone who didn\u2019t want to be there (Thon Maker). And retaining not just Giannis Antetokounmpo, the NBA\u2019s leading candidate for Kia MVP honors, but the complementary pieces around him in a whole far greater than the sum of its parts. New Orleans has a mess on its hands, a slow-mo implosion that could go on for months. Davis is around in body but gone already in spirit. It has holes opened via secondary roster moves at and after the trade deadline. It has earnest players (Jrue Holiday and Julius Randle) who never wanted to see their team spit out the bit like this. It is 25-32 with too many mathematical and mental hills to climb in the West to salvage its season. The Bucks, meanwhile, share market size and lack of glamour issues with the Pelicans, at least in the eyes of many NBA performers. And yet Milwaukee is too busy checking boxes to fret: \u2014 Fancy, state-of-the-art arena? Check. \u2014 Modern, almost Space Age practice facility? Check. \u2014 A top tier coach, Mike Budenholzer, and staff maximizing the players\u2019 talents and with a 2019-style system? Check. \u2014 A front office (led by GM Jon Horst) that\u2019s active in keeping the Bucks equal to or ahead of rivals? Check. \u2014 Ownership that, despite market limitations and relatively meager local broadcast revenues, has stated it will spend into the luxury tax to chase a championship? Check. \u2014 A fan base resuscitated by all the above? Check. \u2014 Finally, a superstar leader who seems sincere and legitimately happy to set up shop in Milwaukee and not grouse even once, in a public way that anyone can remember, about what he can\u2019t achieve or with whom he can\u2019t play. Folks in Milwaukee know they can thank former GM John Hammond for drafting Antetokounmpo \u2014 then a skinny, unknown teenager in a bold, all-in move \u2014 at No. 15 in 2013 . But \u201cThe Greek Freak\u201d has been more of a godsend ever since. It\u2019s not only his vast array of skills (27.1 ppg, 12.6 rpg, 5.9 apg) or the way he explodes or spins to breathtaking totals of unassisted dunks that has Bucks fans thrilled. It\u2019s how non-NBA superstar-cliched Antetokounmpo remains that gives them hope that he might actually do what he says: stay with Milwaukee his entire career. No All-Star in the Bucks\u2019 51-year history has done that. Those close to the scene cite Antetokounmpo\u2019s background \u2014 coming to the game late, growing up and developing in Greece, learning his place in the pecking order of his strong and large traditional family \u2014 as key factors for why he has yet to show common personality symptoms of certain stars bred domestically via traditional interscholastic and AAU paths. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t checking Web sites when he was in eighth grade to see where he was ranked nationally,\u201d one Bucks insider said. Instead of the yearning to \u201cplay with his pals\u201d that leads others to concoct super teams, Antetokounmpo behaves in a manner that shows his pals are his teammates. \u201cHe\u2019s been like that since Day 1 since I\u2019ve been knowing him,\u201d said teammate Khris Middleton. The two have been together from the start and Antetokounmpo\u2019s sense of loyalty had him picking Middleton \u2014 over Davis, Russell Westbrook and the rest \u2014 as the first All-Star reserve for Team Giannis in Sunday\u2019s All-Star Game . The Bucks\u2019 stellar chemistry, fueled by winning, is as genuine as their leader. \u201cHe\u2019s a positive guy,\u201d Middleton said, \u201clots of positive energy. Likes to keep things light but then again, he likes to get down to business. Even when he\u2019s doing great things like he is now, he\u2019s stayed the same person.\u201d Milwaukee has not gone without hiccups in his time there. Antetokounmpo has played on through Larry Sanders, Brandon Knight, O.J. Mayo, Rashad Vaughn, Michael Carter-Williams and Jabari Parker \u2014 all miscalculations of one sort or another. He had three coaches (Larry Drew, Jason Kidd and interim coach Joe Prunty) before Budenholzer, too. He has seen favorites leave, including Hammond, Kidd, assistant coach Sean Sweeney, Parker, Maker, John Henson and Matthew Dellavedova. He has played in the same number of playoff rounds, three, as Davis. And still he smiles. \u201cBeen around a lot of teams with a lot of great chemistry,\u201d Budenholzer said. \u201cPlayers that get along off the court, sometimes it\u2019s reflective of how they play together on the court. This group is great. They really enjoy being around each other. And they push each other, they hold each other accountable \u2014 it\u2019s not just all smiles and laughs. There\u2019s a seriousness and professionalism to them. They\u2019ve got this great balance.\u201d This all could turn on a dime, though. An early playoff exit or a crippling injury or roster changes can alter it all. Milwaukee\u2019s non-Antetokounmpo starters will be free agents this summer (Middleton is expected to opt out, joining Eric Bledsoe, Brook Lopez and Malcolm Brogdon on the market). Mirotic, who has yet to play for the Bucks, can do so, too. Then there\u2019s Antetokounmpo\u2019s continued emergence as one of the league\u2019s bright young faces. The more acclaim he gets, the more people there may be trying to convince him the grass is greener and encourage him to exercise his clout. That would likely mean the bad look of demanding out despite years left on his contract. He notably took less than a maximum contract when he signed his four-year, $100 million extension in September 2016. If some of his teammates show an unwillingness to similarly sacrifice, you can bet he will be reminded of it by rivals and media outlets elsewhere.  Horst, Budenholzer and the team\u2019s owners know winning is the elixir. The NBA can police tampering, but so much of that game gets played out of sight and off social media. The only thing the Bucks can control is the moves they make and the games they win. So far, so great. The Bucks are not the Pelicans, something confirmed by a fellow who recently has been with both. \u201cOne hundred percent,\u201d Mirotic said Monday night in the visitors dressing room at United Center. \u201cAll this was my goal, to be on a good team and try for a championship. This is my fifth year, fourth playoffs, it\u2019s going to be great. When I found out I was traded to the Bucks, for me it was a blessing. I am looking forward to playing with them because this team is really special.\u201d On the eve of the trade deadline, Mirotic put out a cryptic tweet , a single puzzle piece that had some guessing that he perhaps wanted out of New Orleans. \u201c I was just a little bit messing around,\u201d he said. But the Davis ultimatums and resulting clamor did start to undermine the basketball there, he said. \u201cAt some point, you\u2019re more like thinking and listening to what\u2019s happening outside of the court,\u201d Mirotic said. \u201cThe players, we kind of felt like this was going to happen. So it was no surprise. But they say control what you can control.\u201d If a team and market such as New Orleans cannot keep a player like Davis, Mirotic was asked, can Milwaukee hang onto Antetokounmpo? \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d the Bucks\u2019 newest addition said. \u201cI always see him smiling.\u201d * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

They also share Wilmington, North Carolina as a hometown and Laney High School as a training ground for reaching the highest levels the game provides. They both have retired jerseys \u2014 Young\u2019s No. 11 and Jordan\u2019s No. 23 \u2014 hanging high in the rafters in the gym at Laney. Young and Jordan also share a \u201cprove your doubters wrong\u201d mantra. It\u2019s a guiding principle that continues to fuel Young\u2019s decade-long WNBA career, which has included stops in Atlanta, Chicago and Las Vegas. The mindset was also a big part of Jordan\u2019s championship DNA, from his NCAA title-clinching shot his freshman year at North Carolina to his final NBA title-winning shot with the Chicago Bulls. Young, whose love and appreciation for Jordan goes deeper than a robust, Jordan-influenced sneaker collection and being kindred spirits from the same humble beginnings, spoke with NBA.com \u2018s Sekou Smith about all things Wilmington and Jordan with All-Star 2019 on tap for this weekend in their native North Carolina. * * * Sekou Smith: When did it register for you that someone from Wilmington will always have Michael Jordan as a shadow in your in career because of that connection? Tamera Young: I don\u2019t think it really registered for me until I got to high school and we started getting Jordan sneakers and we would get some gear. But honestly, I never really thought about it growing up. It wasn\u2019t until after I got older and made it to the league and you hear people talking like, \u2018Wow, I\u2019m the only woman that made it to the league\u2019 from our hometown and Jordan, the greatest of all time, went to the same high school. But it\u2019s certain things that you don\u2019t really think about until later and people start talking about it to you. For me, I was so focused on getting better and reaching my own goals that I never really dwelled on it. SS: We all have our heroes and we\u2019re all fans of certain players. Was MJ always on that pedestal for you, given the Wilmington connection? TY: For sure. Aside from my brother being someone that I looked up to, Michael was the one on the men\u2019s side. I had my women\u2019s favorite players as well. It was as much about his game and the way he played as it was anything else. I think Michael captured the imagination of generations of players, wherever you were from. And that was no different for me, being from the same place. SS: I\u2019d imagine growing up when you did, in the aftermath of Jordan\u2019s playing career, that everyone you came across as you were on your own journey had a Jordan story for you.  TY: I feel like the older people, they have their stories. But other than that \u2026 I\u2019ve heard people telling stories and talking junk like, \u2018Oh, I was better than Mike when we were kids, back in my day\u2019 and stuff like that. People always want to try to relate to Mike and what they\u2019ve known of him and known about him or whatever. But I didn\u2019t know anyone who personally knew him other than the teachers or coaches that were still at Laney when I went there. SS: Speaking of Laney, his story as a guy who came up the hard away, sort of an underdog story early in his high school career, does that fuel someone with a hoop dream coming from the same place? I mean, no offense, but Wilmington isn\u2019t exactly known as a hoops hotbed. TY: I know it happened for me as well. I didn\u2019t start playing AAU until maybe my sophomore year of high school. That\u2019s really when I first heard about it. I joined a team in Raleigh and my teammates on that team had been playing together since they were 10 years old. So I didn\u2019t start getting any real exposure until then. And then maybe my senior year, when I was playing in this East-West all-star game in Greensboro. I remember, as a matter of fact, it was one of the coaches from [North] Carolina, I had won the MVP in that game, and they were like, \u2018Who is this kid?\u2019 They didn\u2019t really know about me and they were trying to figure out who I was and what my story was. But at that moment I was already committed and going to James Madison. At that time I was getting those prospect letters but those prospect letters didn\u2019t mean anything to me. At that time it was the handwritten letters that really said something. So I can feel that late bloomer vibe, so to speak, as well. Even in college, I didn\u2019t get any real notoriety until maybe the USA Basketball tryouts my sophomore year. I got sent home. And then here I am in my senior year of college and I\u2019m the eighth pick in the [WNBA] draft from a mid-major, you know? I didn\u2019t have a lot of TV games or national exposure. But I was inspired and I went to the pre-draft camp and put in the work. I could also say for myself, I was on varsity all four years and as we know famously, or maybe infamously now, Mike wasn\u2019t on the varsity his first year. So yeah, that underdog feeling that personified certain parts of his career does resonate with me being from the same place and a somewhat similar situation. I feel like I had to put in the extra work and continually prove myself as well. SS: How often did you hear from the people around Wilmington that being from that city, in order to make it, the chances are you\u2019re going to have to travel that same route Jordan did, where you are always having to prove yourself at every stop? TY: For sure. Even with Jordan, people love to say he\u2019s originally from New York. He was born in Brooklyn. But he was raised in Wilmington. Or people want to affiliate him with Chicago because that\u2019s where he became a superstar and global icon, winning championships for the Bulls. It\u2019e easy to forget Wilmington. People always seem to overlook or discredit the fact that he\u2019s from Wilmington, North Carolina. And we\u2019re proud of that fact. It\u2019s just how the basketball world is with the notoriety. They want you to be from a certain place where the talent is always known. But I relish the fact that being from Wilmington, whether you were the greatest player of all time or me or anyone else, we\u2019ve always had to push and grind to get your respect. And no, I don\u2019t think the exposure is there. Like I said, I didn\u2019t have a lot of college coaches coming to my game or even knowing about me until I went to Raleigh, to that bigger city where there was more exposure. It\u2019s something we carry being from Wilmington that I think sets us apart.  SS: Do you sit back now at this stage of your career, after seeing all that you\u2019ve done and doing all the you have done, and think about how to change that for the next generation of kids, the next Michael Jordan or Tamera Young in Wilmington dreaming about chasing that same dream? TY: I think the people there in the city have to support the kids and that\u2019s where it starts. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I did have the support of the community behind me. But it\u2019s also about the exposure of bringing people to Wilmington to see these kids and the work they put in. I always had to travel somewhere else for the exposure. A lot of girls my age weren\u2019t loving the game the way I was or as much as I was. That\u2019s one reason I gravitated towards playing with the boys. But at the same time, there\u2019s only so long you can do that and so far your game will grow doing that before you are really going to get the exposure you need. It helped my game, no doubt, playing with the boys growing up. And believe me, every single one of them thought they were going to be the next Michael Jordan, being from Wilmington. But I also think it\u2019s just something in each generation, in terms of what the kids want and what they are willing to work for, because no one is given anything. You have to work for it. SS: We\u2019ve always heard about Jordan\u2019s work ethic and where that came from. Even after he\u2019d made it and started winning championships at the NBA level, his work ethic was legendary. Do you think that\u2019s at least partially a product of that Wilmington and Laney environment he came up in? TY: Absolutely. It\u2019s who we are in Wilmington. People work their fingers to the bone. For me, I was always determined and this was something that I loved, so I was always prepared to go that extra mile to see it through. I knew that was a part of the story, that being from such humble beginnings, you\u2019d have to put in that extra work to make it. SS: What was it about you and perhaps inside of you as a youngster that kept driving you, because the understanding you\u2019re talking about is usually absent in most people on the way up the mountain? TY: I know I keep bringing it up but it\u2019s the truth. I think the fact that I always felt overlooked gave me that extra motivation. Nobody ever really gave anything to me. I always had to prove myself. Even when I was going to college, people used to always tell me I wasn\u2019t going to make it to the WNBA from James Madison. And if you look at it, they would have seemed right. No one had ever been drafted from James Madison until I was drafted. But it was just something that was instilled in me, to prove doubters wrong and then the love that I had. Just playing outside in my backyard with my brother when I was little. I just had a love for the game. I just continued to work at it and want to be the best. And not just basketball but everything I competed in. Even when I ran sprints in track, I wasn\u2019t running for second place. I was always working to be the best. I think having that drive is what pushed me to get here and then stay at this level as long as I can. The average WNBA career lasts three and half years. And here I am going into my 11th season. So I think that was the main thing for me, being self-self-motivated and having that work ethic. SS: All-Star weekend brings an unusual spotlight on not only the city of Charlotte, North Carolina, Michael Jordan and by extension Wilmington and everyone connected to that city. What does that mean to you as a Wilmington native knowing what\u2019s coming with basketball\u2019s biggest showcase coming to your home state? TY: It means so much. More than you could understand if you\u2019re not from Wilmington. When someone from your hometown makes it, someone who has walked the same halls at Laney, someone truly from Wilmington, it\u2019s inspirational. I don\u2019t think there is any stronger element than inspiration. And this is an inspiration for all young people from where I\u2019m from that anything is possible. You feel like we all made it. This is a moment where you really feel like Wilmington is on the map now. People see where we are from. North Carolina. Charlotte. It\u2019s just the love that you know is coming for the place you are from and cherish. SS: You have a unique perspective, though, living and playing overseas as well (in Israel right now). So you also get a global view of how impactful Michael Jordan\u2019s legacy and brand is beyond the United States. I think everybody thinks they understand that but if you haven\u2019t traveled to the other side of the world, you really don\u2019t. I\u2019d imagine that makes you smile every now and then when you notice that logo in your travels? TY: Definitely. It just shows his impact on the world. Not just adults but kids, people of all ages, you see them rocking Jordans and the gear. They\u2019re buying it for babies and grandparents alike. And it\u2019s literally all over the world. How many brands are consistent with that all over the world? It just shows the impact Jordan had as a player and even more since he played. Even now, he\u2019s still one of the top-selling and most iconic brands and figures out there. It just shows the love the world has always had for him, his abilities and the inspiration he has provided to countless people from all walks of life. And it\u2019s honestly crazy to think it all started in Laney High School in Wilmington, North Carolina. * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

The Wizards announced last week that Wall would need the surgery to repair his injury, which occurred as the result of a slip and fall at his home. Wall was expected to be out at least 12 months, but that timetable could vary. Candace Buckner of The Washington Post reports Wall\u2019s recovery could take as little as 11 months or as long as 15 months. David Aldridge of The Athletic reports Wall\u2019s surgery \u201ccould not have gone better.\u201d https:\/\/twitter.com\/CandaceDBuckner\/status\/1095343432879370240 The team announced last Tuesday that Wall developed an infection in the incision from initial surgery on Jan. 8 (a debridement and repair of a Haglund\u2019s deformity and a chronic Achilles tendon injury in his left heel that was also performed by Dr. Robert Anderson in Green Bay, Wisc). The rupture was diagnosed by Wizards Director of Medical Services and Orthopedist Dr. Wiemi Douoguih during a procedure to clean out the infection. Anderson is considered an elite doctor when it comes to athletes dealing with foot and ankle problems \u2014 as evidenced by a client list that has included, among others, Cam Newton, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant and Derek Jeter. Wall played in 32 of Washington\u2019s games this season, averaging 20.7 points and 8.7 assists even while dealing with the heel pain \u2014 which has been an issue for him many times over the past two to three years. Wall was limited to 41 games last season, mostly because of surgery on his left knee. He also underwent surgeries on both knees in 2016. Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":35628,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/about-last-night-2-11-19","date":"2019-02-12","title":"About Last Night: Mining for milestones","content":" Two years after becoming the first player since Oscar Robertson to average a triple-double \u2014 and one year after doing so again \u2014 Russell Westbrook has now set a mark equaled by no one. With 21 points, 14 rebounds and 11 assists in the Thunder\u2019s 120-111 win over Portland, the former Kia MVP logged his 10th consecutive triple-double \u2014 a streak that surpasses that of Wilt Chamberlain and sets a new NBA record . Unlike his MVP campaign, Westbrook\u2019s stat-stuffing performance was accompanied by that of Paul George in a manner symbolic of OKC\u2019s season. The second-year Thunder poured on 47 points 12 rebounds and 10 assists, marking the first time in league history that teammates have logged triple-doubles with at least 20 points in the same game. More importantly, the combined effort gave Oklahoma City a vital win over a Western Conference opponent. The Thunder are now just a game back of second-place Denver while boasting a firm four-game cushion over the same Blazers team they vanquished on Monday night. George\u2019s continued dominance (28.7 ppg, 8.0 rpg, 4.1 apg, 2.3 spg) begs consideration at this year\u2019s MVP table . All of this might be possible simply because Westbrook has taken the tiniest of half-steps back while allowing George and others to flourish. His usage rate is down 3.5 percent from last season \u2014 and a whopping 11.1 percent from his MVP season. Westbrook\u2019s shot attempts are their lowest since Kevin Durant\u2019s last season in Oklahoma City, while his assists per game are at their highest. Yet even as Westbrook takes that step back, he\u2019s still breaking ground no one has touched before. With the Rockets leading Dallas by as many as 21 and James Harden sitting on a mortal scoring total of just 20 points, the reigning Kia MVP needed a pretty good excuse to continue his historic run of 30-point games. Harden got that excuse with 2:52 remaining, when a Jalen Brunson 3-pointer cut Houston\u2019s lead to just nine. Exit James. Enter \u201cThe Beard.\u201d A step-back 3-pointer. Then another. A pair of free throws. Finally, a one-dribble, you\u2019re-really-leaving-me-more-than-an-inch triple that set the Rockets faithful afrenzy and kept his ridiculous streak intact and thriving. It was vintage Harden, the kind of two-minute blitz that reminds you that he can seemingly score whenever he wants. And if that didn\u2019t remind you, well, Harden will. \u201cNobody can take me out. I\u2019m zoned in right now,\u201d Harden told EA Sports . \u201cSo, even with all the negativity, people can say negative things or make their little smart remarks or comments, that won\u2019t stop me.\u201d Certainly no one can equal him in regards to what is now 30 straight games of 30 points or more \u2014 not since Wilt Chamberlain, anyway. Yet Harden would rather avoid another streak of Chamberlain\u2019s: that of going title-less in multiple MVP seasons. Wilt went 1-for-4 in those campaigns, winning in 1967 while losing in 1960, 1966 and 1968. Right now, Harden is 0-for-1, with another Maurice Podoloff trophy in play but his first Larry O\u2019Brien trophy still waiting. And as Kobe Bryant pointed out last week \u2014 with Harden agreeing \u2014 this current version of The Beard may not be what gets the Rockets over the Bay Area-sized hump. \u201cFor right now, [Bryant\u2019s] probably right,\u201d Harden told ESPN . \u201cThis way, that we\u2019re playing, won\u2019t happen, won\u2019t get us to where we want to go. But we haven\u2019t had a full roster yet, so I\u2019m excited for that to come.\u201d Until then, we\u2019ll simply see how long Harden\u2019s incredible streak will hold out. The Brooklyn Nets continue to impress with their relentless hustle and competition even against the league\u2019s best. Their comeback bid in Toronto, however, ultimately came up short because their zone defense didn\u2019t completely account for the Raptors\u2019 best player. With the game tied, the Nets appeared to be still communicating defensive assignments right up to when Kawhi Leonard caught the ball at the elbow. The sequence left Brooklyn big man Jarrett Allen guarding Leonard, who easily created space for the game-winning jumper for the Raptors\u2019 127-125 victory. Luka Doncic is usually on the winning side of a highlight, but Houston\u2019s PJ Tucker nearly broke the Maverick rookie\u2019s ankles with a crossover of his own. Problem was, Tucker immediately followed up the camera-worthy move with an over-energetic pass. Marc Gasol received a rousing ovation and performed admirably (22 minutes, 16 points, six rebounds, two assists) in his Raptors home debut. What he didn\u2019t receive was a heads up on the pregame intros routine. It doesn\u2019t take a genius to know the Knicks have struggled for a while. Basketball\u2019s mecca has enjoyed just six playoff appearances (and three series wins) in the 21st century. Their two most recent All-Stars (Carmelo Anthony and Kristaps Porzingis) are no longer with the team. Their best hope now lies with the upcoming offseason and the hoard of cap space prepared for it. For now, the Knicks are officially mired in the worst losing streak in franchise history, which reached 17 games after their 107-104 loss at Cleveland. At least they\u2019ve got this Mario Hezonja poster dunk\u2026 Things are hardly better in the nation\u2019s capital, where the Wizards\u2019 121-112 loss ensured that Washington will win less than 50 games for the 40th consecutive season. The last time they surpassed the 50-win mark: their 1978-79 championship season."},{"id":35599,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/cavaliers-nik-stauskas-signed-rest-season","date":"2019-02-12","title":"Well-traveled Nik Stauskas finally gets chance to wear Cavaliers uniform","content":" CLEVELAND (AP) \u2014 Nik Stauskas has been in Cleveland for a week. He\u2019s finally getting a chance to wear a Cavaliers uniform. The Cavaliers have signed the well-traveled guard, who was traded three times and released last week, for the rest of the season. Stauskas was briefly with the Cavs, who acquired him from Portland in the deal for forward Rodney Hood. He never appeared in a game before Cleveland sent him two days later to Houston, which promptly traded Stauskas at the deadline to Indiana. The Pacers then waived the 25-year-old, allowing the rebuilding Cavs to scoop him up. And while being traded twice and then waived, Stauskas never left Cleveland. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy,\u201d he said. \u201cI flew to Cleveland. I was able to practice once with the team. I got traded to Houston, but no one ever booked me a flight to Houston. They were thinking they were still going to make some moves and I was possibly going to be traded again. So I stayed in Cleveland, got traded to Indiana, the same thing happened.\u201d Stauskas spoke to Cavaliers general manager Koby Altman after being let go by the Pacers. \u201cKoby called me and said, `We\u2019re going to work with you back here in Cleveland.\u2019 They were already on the road, so I stayed put at the hotel. I\u2019m glad it worked out,\u201d Stauskas said. Playing for the Cavaliers has a special meaning for Stauskas, who grew up in Toronto as a LeBron James fan and made an annual visit to Quicken Loans Arena. \u201cMy Christmas present would be a trip to Cleveland. I would watch LeBron play, then we would drive back to Toronto,\u201d he said. \u201cProbably three or four (years) in a row. My high school years, that was like when LeBron started winning his MVPs. The Q was always rocking, good fans. I remember those days.\u201d Stauskas averaged 6.1 points, 1.8 rebounds and 1.4 assists in 44 games as a reserve for the Trail Blazers. He has also played for Brooklyn, Philadelphia and Sacramento, which selected him with the No. 8 overall pick in 2014. Cleveland, which recently welcomed back All-Star forward Kevin Love following foot surgery, was 11-45 going into Monday\u2019s game against the New York Knicks . Stauskas played 20 minutes in the Cavaliers\u2019 107-104 win and finished with three points, five rebounds and one assist."},{"id":35578,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nba-kevin-durant-discontinued-dribble-call-missed","date":"2019-02-12","title":"NBA says key call missed in Heat-Warriors game","content":"MIAMI (AP) \u2014 Golden State\u2019s Kevin Durant should have been called for a discontinued dribble on the Warriors\u2019 final possession of what became their 120-118 win over the Miami Heat , the NBA said Monday in a report detailing all calls made in the last 2 minutes of the game. Golden State made a pair of free throws on that possession, the final points of the game. The league, in its Last Two Minute Report that is released after close games, said it reviewed multiple video angles to determine that Durant\u2019s dribble was not interrupted by the ball making inadvertent contact with the foot or shin of Heat defender Justise Winslow and \u201ca discontinued dribble should have been called on Durant.\u201d Also, the league opted not to fine Heat coach Erik Spoelstra for his postgame comments about the officiating \u2014 which were prefaced by Spoelstra beginning his remarks with \u201cLook, NBA, do not fine me. I\u2019m allowed to say this.\u201d Spoelstra also said multiple times in his postgame news conference that he was not blaming referees for the loss. Durant was being defended by Winslow with about 10 seconds left in a tie game, dribbling as Golden State\u2019s DeMarcus Cousins came to set a pick, the whole play unfolding not far from referee Kevin Cutler. Durant lost control of the ball and Heat assistant coach Chris Quinn \u2014 standing just a couple feet from referee Jason Goldenberg \u2014 was among those immediately lobbying for a violation to be called. Goldenberg signaled that Durant\u2019s dribble was deflected by Winslow, which replays showed was not the case. The play continued, Durant missed a 3-point try, and Cousins got the rebound, was fouled and made two free throws with 5.4 seconds remaining in what became the final points of the game. \u201cIt\u2019s a double-dribble. Everybody can see it,\u201d Spoelstra said after the game. \u201cThose are tough calls to make but everybody saw it. It\u2019s right there in front of everybody. That should be a violation and you can\u2019t miss those calls. But we had our chances. Like I said, it was back and forth. The officials \u2014 so let\u2019s be clear about it, so I do not get fined \u2014 that\u2019s not why we lost.\u201d Miami still had a chance to win, but Dion Waiters\u2019 3-pointer bounced off the rim as time expired. The loss knocked Miami, which was playing at Denver on Monday night, out of the eighth and final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. The Warriors took 26 free throws to Miami\u2019s eight, which also irked Spoelstra. \u201cYou hate to see 26-8 when our guys are going aggressively,\u201d he said. The league\u2019s review included study of 26 different events that went on in the last 2 minutes, and the league said the 25 others were all handled correctly."},{"id":35577,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/report-hawks-buy-out-jeremy-lin","date":"2019-02-11","title":"Report: Lin eyes Raptors after buyout from Hawks","content":" Atlanta Hawks veteran guard Jeremy Lin is apparently on his way to a playoff-bound team. The Hawks officially waived Lin on Monday afternoon. And according to Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN , Lin\u2019s next stop will be Toronto. Toronto has been aggressive of late in reshaping its roster for the postseason, adding former All-Star center Marc Gasol via a trade deadline-day deal with the Memphis Grizzlies. In adding Lin, the Raptors would have another playoff-tested veteran to add to their mix in what is shaping up to be a tough postseason road in the Eastern Conference. This season, Lin is averaging 10.7 points, 3.5 assists and 2.3 rebounds in 19.7 minutes. He has appeared in 51 games this season. The Hawks acquired Lin \u2014 along with a 2025 second-round pick and the right to swap second-round picks in 2023 \u2014 from the Brooklyn Nets last summer for guard Isaia Cordinier and a protected 2020 second-round pick.

He\u2019s got enough young(er) teammates in the Charlotte Hornets\u2019 locker room to qualify as one of the old heads. So, the 14-year NBA veteran insists that it\u2019s best to embrace the role rather than trying to deny the reality of his situation. But that doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t enjoy turning the clock back every now and then, as he did Saturday night at State Farm Arena with a monster dunk over Atlanta Hawks center Alex Len . Williams caught the ball on the wing, drove to the basket and rocked the rim and Len. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while,\u201d he joked afterwards. \u201cSome of the guys say that I\u2019m good for one a year, so I guess that was my one.\u201d His highlight dunk was one of the punctuation marks on spectacular night for Williams, who finished the game with a season-high 27 points for a Hornets team trying to finish the pre-All-Star weekend portion of the season with a bang. \u201cAt this point everybody is jockeying for playoff positions in both conferences and every game counts,\u201d Williams said. \u201cWe understand that the break is right around the corner but we still have work to do before the break. We just have to take it one game at a time and just focus on each game as much as we can. We have to try to go in to the break with some momentum and then continue building that momentum after the break.\u201d The ability to compartmentalize the season in that way comes easy to Williams now, years after entering the league with all of the hype that comes with being the No. 2 pick in the 2005 Draft . After playing off the bench during his freshman year at North Carolina, Williams \u2014 the ACC Rookie of the Year \u2014 played the role of hero in the Tar Heels title-game win. His tip-in with 1:26 to play broke a 70-70 tie as the Tar Heels went on to a 75-70 win over Illinois. Williams was a critical piece for a Hawks team that snapped a decade-long playoff drought in 2007-08, growing and developing in his early years in the league alongside Celtics center Al Horford, 2005 Slam Dunk champion Josh Smith, veteran All-Star Joe Johnson, youngster Josh Childress, future Cavaliers coach Tyrone Lue and others.  Now he\u2019s trying to play a similar role on a Hornets team led by All-Star guard Kemba Walker, as the Hornets try to grind their way into the playoffs in coach James Borrego\u2019s first season. Williams, 32, is a grinder on and off the court. He earned his degree in African-American studies from UNC in 2014 after spending nine years in summer school and taking classes during the season to finish what he started. He spoke to NBA.com \u2018s Sekou Smith about his journey, the Hornets\u2019 future and more. * * * Sekou Smith: Has it sunk in for you just how long 14 years is in the grand scheme of things, how long that is in an NBA career? One day you\u2019re a teenager trying to figure it all out and the next, you\u2019re the old head in the locker room. Marvin Williams: [Laughing] Only when I wake up in the morning, man. That\u2019s the only time I think about it to be honest. SS: But it is something in this league, the hard work it takes to have the longevity you\u2019ve had. Did you find yourself at this stage of your career paying forward the words of wisdom you received from your veterans when you came into the league? Are you whispering in the ears of [Charlotte rookies] Miles Bridges and Devonte\u2019 Graham about what it takes to have real staying power in this league? MW: I\u2019ve been so blessed, man. So blessed. Obviously, you know I started here in Atlanta. And to still be here in my 14th year, it\u2019s been a true blessing. But I do look at the young\u2019uns \u2014 Malik [Monk] was I think 19 and here\u2019s Miles at 20, you know how we were at that age. It\u2019s hard to figure it all out, it\u2019s hard. You\u2019re trying to learn a lot in a short period of time. But these guys are so talented, so gifted. So it is fun to watch them grow. They are all really hard workers. They have the right attitude. So what you\u2019re trying to do as a vet is model the right behavior, help them whenever and wherever you can. They have such bright futures in this game, so you just try and help out when you can and don\u2019t overdo it, but be as supportive as possible while also taking care of your own business on a daily basis. SS: How different are things for your now, working to stay on top of your game mentally, physically and emotionally? There are a lot of your contemporaries who either were in the league straight out of high school or guys you came up with who didn\u2019t make it this far, who didn\u2019t last this long. MW: That\u2019s the thing that cracks me up. For me, I remember me and [Josh Smith] used to come out here at 19 and 20 and barely even stretch and then play 35 minutes and not even feel it the next day. It\u2019s crazy what the body can do when you\u2019re a young guy. Now it takes me 30 minutes to get loose. Physically, I feel fine. Once you warmed up and locked in, it is what is. But you can\u2019t just roll it out there and show up like you did early on. There\u2019s so much to the preparation that you just don\u2019t always understand when you first step into this man\u2019s league. It can blow your mind if you don\u2019t adjust and it can cost you if you don\u2019t get up to speed quickly. Looking back, it\u2019s so important to have those times in my career when I\u2019m in a locker room with Stack [Jerry Stackhouse] and T-Mac [Tracy McGrady] and you know, guys like Joe Johnson, Tyronn Lue and Mike Bibby as they were getting older, to shine some light on the process you have to go through. I got a chance to play with Richard Jefferson in Salt Lake City with the Jazz, older guys who had been around who really understood what it takes to do this at the highest level, I picked up things from all of them, each and every one of them, and put them in my bag. You have to. I can\u2019t stress enough how invaluable those experiences were to me and my career.  SS: I know the methods have changed in terms of training, preparation, rest and the physical and emotional wellness you have to pay attention to. But how different is the game technically, between those lines on the floor? MW: It\u2019s different, it\u2019s big-time different. There is so much emphasis on pace and space, a lot of us have had to reinvent ourselves over the years. Everything is the 3-point shot now. I remember \u2018big-to-big.\u2019 And now, if you said \u2018big-to-big\u2019 to most of the guys on our roster they\u2019d have no idea what you are talking about in the pick and roll. It\u2019s just not like that anymore. There\u2019s so much [defensive] switching going on. I mean, we did it back with Woody [former Hawks coach Mike Woodson] and got crushed for it. It turns out he, and in turn we, we were really ahead of the curve. It doesn\u2019t get talked about much, but we were one of those teams back in 2007 and 2008 that had the type of personnel to play the way everybody is playing now.The entire league is doing it now. So yeah, it\u2019s different, drastically different. But it\u2019s definitely fun to play this way. SS: What do you think some of those Hawks teams you played on would look like in today\u2019s NBA? You had the right idea in terms of the size and athleticism, the length and all that. You didn\u2019t shoot it as well as group compared to the way teams are playing now, but there was certainly a lot to work with in terms of raw materials. MW: There\u2019s no way we were up to the standard in terms of shooting. No way. But I\u2019ve definitely benefitted from playing the way we did in those early days under Woody. Nothing has felt uncomfortable for me since then, not in Utah or here with the Hornets, because of how we approached the game my first six or seven years in the league. Switching on the ball, switching off the ball, having to guard bigger guys, having to guard smaller guys. All of that, operating the way we did, has helped get to this point and influenced the player I\u2019ve been and have become over all these years. I bring that with me every day, every night when I put that Hornets jersey on it\u2019s about the entire journey for me. SS: I\u2019m glad you got us back to the Hornets. What is the ceiling for this team? You guys played .500 ball without Cody Zeller available and in the lineup and stayed in the playoff mix. How high can you guys rise down the stretch of this season? MW: The biggest thing for us is we have to continue to work to finish games. Our defense throughout the year has come and gone, and you can see that in the results we\u2019ve had. When it\u2019s on point we usually win and when it\u2019s not, we struggle. So we\u2019ve got to continue to work to finish games. We\u2019ve had too many where we\u2019ve been up 20 or been up 17 or 18 points and then we trick the game away. We\u2019ve had some really good wins and some really tough losses, just like every team to this point in the season. No one\u2019s perfect, but we have to try and limit those struggle games from here on out if we\u2019re going to be the team we think we can be. Because we can\u2019t make it if we don\u2019t come out on a consistent basis and establish ourselves on the defensive end. SS: We both know there have always been questions about the supporting cast around Kemba and whether or not it was a good enough group to help do for the Hornets what the supporting cast elsewhere has done for other All-Star players in the East and around the league. What\u2019s it going to take for you guys to take it to another level? MW: I think the one thing about us, and obviously everybody talks about Kemba needing another big [name] guy with him, but the way our team is assembled, we\u2019ve got a lot of guys who are good at what they do. We\u2019ve got accomplished guys on this roster, from Tony Parker and Nic Batum to some of our younger guys, too. So when we do things collectively, I think we\u2019re more than good enough. Now we don\u2019t really have another guy who\u2019s going to go out there and get us 20 a night. Jeremy Lamb is probably the other guy on our roster who is the best scorer. And he\u2019s had a hell of year. But the bottom line is we have enough to get into the playoffs. I feel like we have guys who know their roles and understand that we all mean beyond just that next game. We have more than enough to get into the playoffs.  SS: And once you get there? MW: What did KG say? Anything is possible [laughing], right? I believe that. We believe that as a group. * * * Sekou Smith is a veteran NBA reporter and NBA TV analyst.

The franchise ended up trading Michael Beasley, Ivica Zubac and rookie Svi Mykhailiuk in a pair of deals to acquire Reggie Bullock and Mike Muscala. Johnson said before the Sunday\u2019s game in Philadelphia that he didn\u2019t believe the Pelicans engaged in good-faith negotiations at the trade deadline during the Lakers\u2019 pursuit of Anthony Davis. Johnson added that the LA players who were on the trade block are professionals who are capable of moving forward. \u201cQuit making this about thinking these guys are babies because that\u2019s what you\u2019re treating them like,\u201d Johnson said Sunday in Philadelphia, before the Lakers lost 143-120 to the 76ers . \u201cThey\u2019re professionals. All of them. And this is how this league works. They know it, I know it \u2014 that\u2019s how it goes. \u201cSo we\u2019ve got to move forward, and we are moving forward. They played outstanding against Boston. Give them credit. And we want to play well today and continue on. This is a part of the league. You\u2019ve got a good side of the business that we get paid to be professional basketball players, and there\u2019s deals like this.\u201d Johnson said the Lakers were looking to make deals, but nothing materialized for them until the week of trade deadline. \u201cNobody was going to make a move until the last week. And we were locked into Reggie for a long time. Had some great talks with Detroit. And then finally it became a deal. Mike was really last-second when we didn\u2019t know that Philly was going to make that move [acquiring Tobias Harris from the Clippers]. When they made that move and we looked up and said, \u2018Man, a stretch 4-5 could really help us out.\u2019 And we feel good about the trade.\u201d Johnson joined the team in Philadelphia on Sunday after attending a reunion with the 1978-79 Michigan State championship team to celebrate its 40 anniversary on Saturday in East Lansing, Mich. He used the trip to Philadelphia to help let his team know the goal remains ending the Lakers\u2019 playoff drought. \u201cI talked to guys individually,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cBecause that\u2019s important to have sidebars with them. Make sure that we\u2019re heading all in the same direction. And we are. And we got a goal ahead of us to try to make the playoffs. That\u2019s what it\u2019s all about.\u201d Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":46510,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/about-last-night-2-10-19","date":"2019-02-11","title":"About Last Night: Dwyane Wade's Defensive Prowess","content":" For all the stats Dwyane Wade has compiled in this 16-season career, I personally most enjoy this: Wade ranks No. 17 among active players in blocks, his 868 sandwiched between Robin Lopez (894) and Joakim Noah (857). Depending on how you classify swingmen like Vince Carter (No. 19, 852) and Andre Iguodala (No. 33, 540), Wade might well be the only guard among the top 50. Even during this #OneLastDance, that talent remains dangerous and on display. Kevin Durant got got with this wily anticipation helper on Sunday in Oakland: Sure, it was ruled a steal \u2014 maybe Durant was passing, who\u2019s to say? \u2014 and that finish might have been a little more finesse than fierce, but the play crucially gave Miami their first lead of the fourth quarter with less than a minute to go. Unfortunately for Wade, Durant had the last laugh, nailing a game-tying 3 shortly after as Golden State closed out the 120-118 victory . Wade finished with 10 points, six rebounds, nine assists, a steal and a block in 28 minutes. Even in defeat, there was plenty of love in the Bay for Wade. Warriors forward Draymond Green spoke highly of Wade\u2019s breakthrough as an \u201cundersized 2-guard\u201d and how he felt it paved the way for other so-called \u201ctweeners\u201d. \u201cD-Wade was an inspiration for me,\u201d Green said. \u201cHe\u2019s had an incredible career. What he\u2019s done for that organization, it\u2019s been amazing, and yet he\u2019s still out there this year, playing well \u2026 it\u2019s good to see a guy as great as D-Wade close out on a strong note.\u201d Indeed. And pretty sure we all saw this one coming: Here\u2019s to those three All-Defensive nods, Dwyane. Cheers. Out in Dallas, Damian Lillard looked like he had enacted a one-man Maverick takedown, scoring 16 straight Portland points (hitting eight consecutive shots) as part of a 21-point third quarter on Sunday. But then the entire Blazers squad combined for nine fourth-quarter points, outscored by rookie swingman Luka Doncic (13 in fourth, 28 overall) alone. Portland\u2019s 15-point lead evaporated, and Doncic hit several shots down the stretch, bringing him up to 11-for-16 on shots to tie or take the lead in the final two minutes of games. This kid, though. Following the pre-deadline acquisition of Tobias Harris, everyone\u2019s been locked in on Philly\u2019s potential , particularly due to the \u201cBig 4\u201d taking the floor at tipoff for Philadelphia. But it\u2019s J.J. Redick who actually might elevate his profile the most. In two blowout victories since the trade, Redick\u2019s put up 55 points on 19-of-28 shooting (9-13 3s), even chipping in eight assists. He\u2019s basically walking onto the court wide open, and is capitalizing on a career spent seeking the slivers of space necessary to get off one of the league\u2019s cleanest shots. Check this one, which resulted in a four-point play during Philly\u2019s 143-120 win over the Lakers. (He made the free throw.) If Redick\u2019s hitting those, watch out Eastern Conference. Goodness. Also, Ben Simmons took a pullup 3-pointer \u2014 just his third such attempt of the season, and the first that wasn\u2019t a heave \u2014 which allowed Redick to display his comedy chops: De\u2019Aaron Fox is wild fast, and that\u2019s most often obvious on offense, all explosive attacks toward the rim. But more than a few times this season, Fox has turned on the jets in pursuit and left layups finding fresh directions en route to the rim. The stats have the 6-foot-3 point guard averaging only 0.5 per game \u2014 he\u2019s 15th among guards with 28 on the season \u2014 but it\u2019s worth watching in case you get one of these: Sorry, Kyle Kuzma. Needed to throw a few more on that 39-point line. Looked good doing it though: Shimmy game strong.

The Chicago Bulls\u2019 arena went dark, the intro music \u2013 that final vestige of the Michael Jordan era \u2013 swelled, and Portis\u2019 mental prep kicked in as it had so many times before. [INSERT RECORD SCRATCH] Wake up, Bobby. Your new team, the Washington Wizards, already has been introduced. You\u2019re on the visitors\u2019 bench and all those Bulls buddies you\u2019ve known for so long, they\u2019re the bad guys now. Cut Portis some slack. Getting traded is tough enough, a slap of reality and rejection that in many cases the player never saw coming. Going through that, experiencing all the emotion it triggers, is compounded when a schedule quirk puts you 72 hours later right back in the same building. Some players get angry when they get traded. Some are happy. Some get depressed. Porter, by the time he emerged from the other locker room Saturday, still was a little disoriented. \u201cIt was very weird, man,\u201d Portis said after Washington\u2019s 134-125 victory . \u201cI\u2019m sitting there, hearing the starting lineups, hearing the famous song \u2026 Hearing that, I\u2019m just imagining myself getting ready to play somebody else, not [line up against] the Bulls. \u201cI check into the game and I see all my buddies on the other side of the court. Also weird.\u201d You say it\u2019s a game, they say it\u2019s a business. That\u2019s half of an old line from North Dallas Forty , but it\u2019s hardly sport-specific and seldom applies more to the NBA than in the days immediately before and after the February trade deadline. Minutes before Chicago faced New Orleans on Wednesday night, with the hoops world anticipating an Anthony Davis trade, Portis and Jabari Parker were the ones learning they were dealt to the Wizards. The Bulls preferred wing Otto Porter Jr.  Done. See ya. That\u2019s how a fellow like Portis \u2013 with a motor that revs high, a frequently off-kilter look in his eyes and a stunning dress suit that, metaphorically, bled Bulls red the way he did \u2013 can wind up feeling a little out of body. And for a minute, a bit betrayed. \u201cYeah,\u201d Portis said. \u201cObviously I got my first taste of the business side of basketball. You don\u2019t really get your way all the time. I have to roll with it now. I was hurt the last 48 hours, but when I got into the game [against Cleveland Friday], those hurt emotions went away. \u201cI took it really tough. Didn\u2019t see it coming \u2026 I was seeing all the things on Twitter, people kept @-ing me. I never thought I would get traded. But that\u2019s basketball.\u201d  Actually, the basketball helped both Portis and Parker. The game against the Cavaliers was a balm, Portis scoring 30 points in 27 minutes off Washington\u2019s bench and Parker chipping in seven points, 11 rebounds and nine assists in an easy victory. Saturday\u2019s game in Chicago, thanks to the context, had an edge, something the entertainment at United Center sorely has lacked this season. It also offered some closure to the relocated ex-Bulls \u2013 the team honored both in a tribute video during the first timeout \u2013 and a chance to channel more robust emotions. Parker had only been with the Bulls for this season\u2019s first 55 games, a rocky relationship that started with his happy free-agent signing in July but spiraled over to a cold war with his coaches, first Fred Hoiberg and then replacement Jim Boylen. Parker\u2019s hide is tough, though, thickened through a pair of ACL blowouts and comebacks with the Bucks and this hired-gun half season in his Windy City hometown. He was more matter-of-fact Saturday, speaking loudest with a forceful, energetic performance: 20 points on 9-of-15 shooting with a career-best six dunks. \u201cWe\u2019re going to use him how we\u2019ve used him the last couple games,\u201d said Wizards coach Scott Brooks. \u201cWe feel like this is his best [contribution] to our team, being a backup \u2018point forward.\u2019 Attacking and making plays. \u201cWe need a guy like that. Give Ernie [Grunfeld, Washington GM] a lot of credit \u2026 We changed the way we have to think. With [injured point guard John Wall] being out the majority of next year, we got a couple of guys who can give us some scoring the rest of this year.\u201d Portis came in too amped, barking at the Bulls bench after a chase-down block of Wayne Selden at the end of the first quarter and muscling a couple of shots that needed touch. But he finished with 10 points, 12 boards, four assists and a pair of blocks. By night\u2019s end, he sounded ready to swap out his \u201cBull for life\u201d outlook for something beginning with a W. \u201cThat\u2019s part of being an NBA player,\u201d said Brooks, a journeyman point guard as a player. \u201cI wanted to be a Sixer for life. Then a Timberwolf for life. And then a Rocket for life. Then a Maverick for life. And then a Knick for life. Then Cleveland for life. And then I wanted to be in L.A. for life. And now I\u2019m here. \u201cIt\u2019s just part of it. You play and you play as hard as you can for your organization. Things happen, and you have to move on to the next place.\u201d Porter scored 17 against his former team, but missed nine of 15 shots. At Brooklyn on Friday, he was better: 18 points (7-9 FGs), including four 3-pointers. But he doesn\u2019t run as hot as Portis, and he tends to be quieter than Parker. The Bulls\u2019 run of remember-when games continues Monday when the Milwaukee Bucks drive down I-94 with their trade-deadline upgrade, Nikola Mirotic. Mirotic, acquired from New Orleans Thursday, has been gone for a year but has yet to play at United Center (the Bulls and Pelicans were done with their series before last season\u2019s swap and Mirotic was hurt when New Orleans visited Wednesday). Two days later, Memphis comes in with longtime fan favorite Joakim Noah. Noah has played once in Chicago, just a few months after signing with New York as a free agent in 2016, but that\u2019s it. He had his best game in years Saturday with 19 points and 14 rebounds off the bench as Memphis beat New Orleans. Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

And so did James Harden, who opted for cozy fleece over a neon construction vest. Westbrook tied an NBA record with his ninth straight triple-double and the Oklahoma City Thunder overcame a 26-point deficit to beat the Houston Rockets 117-112 . It was the largest comeback in franchise history (and the second biggest comeback of the night). Westbrook had 21 points, 11 assists and 12 rebounds to match the record streak set by Wilt Chamberlain in 1968. Westbrook has 22 triple-doubles this season and 126 overall. James Harden extended his own historic run, dropping 42 points against the Thunder, eclipsing 30 points for the 29th straight game \u2014 two shy of Chamberlain for the second-longest streak in NBA history, but far behind Chamberlain\u2019s record run of 65 games. I guess that Chamberlain guy was pretty good. Paul George, who scored 15 of his 45 points in the fourth quarter, said it took a fiery halftime discussion to help the Thunder overcome the largest deficit they\u2019ve seen all season. \u201cWe just knew we had to have a better second half,\u201d George said. \u201cBeing down that much at the half, that\u2019s not the team we are. We know this team very well and we knew that wasn\u2019t us. So we had to come in here and talk and just light a fire under this team and we did that.\u201d Cruising along with a 28-point lead, everything was going the Boston Celtics\u2019 way against the new-look LA Clippers. Then Kyrie Irving left the game with a sprained knee in the second quarter, setting the stage for the biggest comeback in Clippers\u2019 history. The Celtics missed 18 of their 22 shots in the third quarter to open the door for the Clippers, who erupted for 42 point in the fourth quarter to complete the stunning 123-112 victory . A chorus of boos rained down at TD Garden during the second-half collapse and at the final buzzer. Marcus Morris was critical of the Celtics\u2019 selfish play after the game. \u201cWe\u2019re going to lose games, but we don\u2019t have no attitude, we don\u2019t have no toughness, we ain\u2019t having fun,\u201d Morris told reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long season.\u201d JaMychal Green, Landry Shamet, Garrett Temple and Ivica Zubac all made their debuts for the Clippers after being acquired at the trade deadline. Temple scored 11 points and Zubac had 12 with nine rebounds in starting roles. Shamet scored 17 off the bench, while Green scored two in limited action. Just three days after being traded to Washington, Jabari Parker and Bobby Portis returned to Chicago \u2014 with a vengeance. Parker threw down six dunks on his way to 20 points with six assists, while Portis added 10 points and 12 rebounds in the Wizards\u2019 134-125 victory over the Bulls. You could tell Parker wasn\u2019t going to be denied on this night after he threw down a nasty left-handed dunk over Lauri Markkanen. Marc Gasol had seven points and six rebounds in his Toronto debut and the Raptors sent the New York Knicks to their 16th straight loss, 104-99 . Acquired from Memphis before Thursday\u2019s trade deadline, Gasol played 19 minutes. The three-time All-Star entered late in the first quarter and made a hook shot on his first try. With the NBA about to descend on Charlotte next week, Kemba Walker is showing why he was selected to start the All-Star Game for the first time in his career. Walker hit a season-high nine 3-pointers and scored 37 points, leading the Hornets past the Atlanta Hawks 129-120 to remain in seventh place in the Eastern Conference. Walker, who is averaging 34 points and eight assists in his last four games, has three games with at least nine 3-pointers since the start of last season. Only Stephen Curry (7) has more over that span. Magic Johnson was in East Lansing on Saturday, as Michigan State basketball honored its 1979 NCAA championship team. Johnson reminisced with his former college teammates and shared his best impression of legendary coach Jud Heathcote. Asked about the fallout from trade deadline in which endless rumors swirled around the Lakers, Johnson said, \u201cIt\u2019s a part of business, it\u2019s a part of being a professional athlete. I\u2019m going to hug \u2019em and tell them that we got to come together and our goal is still in reach, which is to make the playoffs.\u201d \u201cHis approach already is respected. His spirit is acknowledged. He\u2019s got a brightness about him and a care factor.\u201d \u2014 Bulls coach Jim Boylen on Otto Porter Jr.\u2019s potential to be a leader Trae Young set the Atlanta Hawks\u2019 single-season record for assists by a rookie. Young, who has 410 in 55 games, passed Armond Hill, who had 403 in 1976-77 over 81 games."},{"id":35646,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/morris-rips-celtics-toughness-attitude","date":"2019-02-10","title":"Marcus Morris rips Celtics' toughness, attitude","content":" Though he is personally enjoying a career year, Marcus Morris isn\u2019t happy with his team\u2019s success \u2014 or overall attitude.

Despite his return (and that of Gordon Hayward) from injury last season, the Celtics are just fifth in the East behind the Milwaukee Bucks, Toronto Raptors, Indiana Pacers and Philadelphia 76ers. Irving exited Saturday\u2019s game with a right knee sprain . Most of Boston\u2019s younger players, meanwhile, have either plateaued or taken a step back after showing promise during the team\u2019s run to Game 7 of the Eastern Conference finals last season. The Celtics appeared to have turned a corner in recent weeks, a stretch that included winning 10 out of 11 before dropping their most recent games to the Clippers and Lakers. Just as concerning is Boston\u2019s competition at the top of the East. The Bucks, Raptors and 76ers each made significant additions to their respective teams before Thursday\u2019s trade deadline while the Celtics ultimately stood pat. \u201cTrade deadline\u2019s over,\u201d Morris said bluntly. \u201cThis is the team we\u2019re rocking with, this is what we going with. So, at the end of the day man, it\u2019s unacceptable what we did tonight. It\u2019s very unacceptable for a team of our caliber.\u201d With the only possible changes coming via buyout free agent acquisitions, Morris believes the current roster must improve internally, and not just in terms of on-court production. \u201cWhen I look around the league I see a bunch of guys getting up and cheering on the bench and playing for each other,\u201d Morris observed. \u201cWhen I look at us, I just see a bunch of individuals.\u201d"},{"id":35633,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/pistons-sign-wayne-ellington-official-release","date":"2019-02-09","title":"Detroit Pistons sign free-agent guard Wayne Ellington","content":"AUBURN HILLS, Mich. \u2013 The Detroit Pistons announced today that the club has signed free-agent guard Wayne Ellington.

He only needed 25 minutes to score 32 points in his first game for New Orleans since requesting a trade nearly two weeks ago. Davis also had nine rebounds and three blocks in a 122-117 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves on Friday night. Whether his presence in the lineup is sustainable for a club that is trying to move on without him \u2014 and protect his trade value by keeping him healthy \u2014 remains to be seen. But for now, coach Alvin Gentry and other Pelicans veterans sound inclined to try to make it work. \u201cHe\u2019s obviously made it known that he won\u2019t sign back, but he still loves the game of basketball. I know that he loves us as players, and he\u2019s going to go out there and play as hard as he can,\u201d Pelicans point guard Jrue Holiday said. \u201cIf Anthony\u2019s out there, that\u2019s the best chance of us winning.\u201d The Pelicans entered their game at Memphis on Saturday night at 25-31, five games behind the Los Angeles Clippers for the Western Conference\u2019s final playoff spot with 26 games left. When Davis initially made his trade request public through his agent, Rich Paul, Davis\u2019 image was largely removed from the Pelicans\u2019 website and promotional material. Gentry also started providing more playing time to younger players the club wants to develop. But after Thursday\u2019s trade deadline passed without a deal to move Davis, the Pelicans had to decide if they were willing to defy NBA rules by shelving their healthy six-time All-Star. For now, they\u2019ve put him back in the starting lineup, albeit on reduced playing time as he works his way back from a sprained left index finger that had sidelined him since Jan. 18. On Friday night, Davis was kept on the bench in a tense fourth quarter despite the teams being separated by as little as one basket several times in the waning minutes. Gentry said he limited Davis\u2019 minutes because it had been weeks since he played. \u201cI was not going to have him \u2014 first game back \u2014 play 38, 40 minutes,\u201d Gentry said. \u201cI thought he played well the minutes that he was in there and did a great job. He was typical Anthony.\u201d Gentry is hoping to find a balance that allows Davis to play \u2014 and hopefully stay healthy \u2014 while allowing other front-court players like the resurgent Jahlil Okafor and third-year pro Cheick Diallo to get meaningful minutes. \u201cWe talked about that a lot. Some kind of way, we have to keep those guys in the rotation and keep them available,\u201d Gentry said. \u201cObviously, they may not play the amount of minutes that they\u2019ve been playing \u2026 but I do think that we have to keep them in the rotation and put them in situations where we can see how their development is going and see how they are against the better players in the league and playing with our better players.\u201d The Pelicans have made Holiday the face of the franchise since Davis\u2019 trade demand. The veteran guard, who is in the second year of a five-year, $126 million contract, said he understands the inherent conflict between focusing on players who are committed to the franchise long-term and playing Davis. But he added, \u201cI think we\u2019re still trying to win. Having Anthony on our team and Anthony on the court, in my opinion, is our best chance of winning. \u201cSo I guess maybe there\u2019s a little give and take,\u201d Holiday continued. \u201cMaybe you don\u2019t play him 38 minutes or whatever. \u2026 But if you want to develop guys, we can probably find different slots.\u201d Gentry said he wasn\u2019t concerned that his players might be distracted during home games by boos directed at Davis. \u201cWe\u2019re in a hell of a lot of trouble if we\u2019re going to let boos determine if we play hard or not,\u201d Gentry said. The coach also sounded confident that team chemistry would not be undermined. \u201cWhen you\u2019re a competitor, when you step out between the lines, you\u2019re going to play basketball and you\u2019re going to try to do the best you can with your other teammates to try to win the basketball game,\u201d Gentry said. \u201cI think that\u2019s where we are right now. The shock of the whole thing is over. Obviously he said he doesn\u2019t want to be here; he wants to be traded. All that has been known. Now what we\u2019re trying to do is bring back some normalcy to the whole situation and what can we do as coaches and what can we do as teammates to try to win basketball games.\u201d Davis said he has no regrets over how he\u2019s handled the matter. \u201cI never regret anything I do,\u201d he said. He also said he would have understood if the Pelicans insisted on not playing him. \u201cObviously, it\u2019s a business,\u201d Davis said. \u201cI know their standpoint on it and I was prepared for that.\u201d"},{"id":35625,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/clippers-waive-michael-beasley-official-release","date":"2019-02-09","title":"LA Clippers waive forward Michael Beasley","content":"The LA Clippers have waived forward Michael Beasley, it was announced today by President of Basketball Operations Lawrence Frank.

Bickerstaff said Saturday at morning shoot-around that when Parsons comes back, \u201che\u2019s a part of the team like anybody else.\u201d Bickerstaff added, \u201che\u2019s still a part of the team and we\u2019ll treat him that way.\u201d Parsons, who has had knee issues , told ESPN he is \u201cready to get back to Memphis and help my team win any way I can.\u201d The 30-year-old forward remains on Memphis\u2019 roster after the Grizzlies made three different trades at the deadline Thursday, dealing away Marc Gasol, Garrett Temple, JaMychal Green and Shelvin Mack.

Now the Grizzlies have lost four of their last six and are 22-34 overall, ahead of only Phoenix in the Western Conference. He has played three games in the third season of the four-year, $94 million contract he signed in July 2016. Limited by injuries, he played a combined 70 games over the first two seasons of that contract, but his agent told The Commercial Appeal on Dec. 28 that Parsons had been cleared and was ready to play. Wallace said Jan. 6 that team officials had talked with Parsons and his agent numerous times about his rehab and how to \u201cintegrate a healthy and effective Chandler\u201d back on the court, with options including a three-game stint with the G-League\u2019s Memphis Hustle. Wallace said Parsons chose to continue rehabilitation in Los Angeles and that the Grizzlies would monitor his progress. Parsons was the Grizzlies\u2019 big free agent signee in July 2016, with Memphis believing it finally had the 3-point threat the team has lacked for years.

LaMarcus Aldridge (33), San Antonio Spurs Previous rank: 2 Latest stats: 7 games, 24.4 ppg, 11.6 rpg, 2.6 apg Season stats: 21.1 ppg, 8.9 rpg, 2.5 apg If not for James\u2019 triple-double on Thursday, Aldridge would\u2019ve claimed the throne. That\u2019s what happens when you grab double-doubles in five of the last seven, and go for 30-9 and 22-9 in the other two. In fact, over his last 10 games, he\u2019s only had one subpar performance (13 points and five rebounds on Jan. 23). 3. Lou Williams (32), LA Clippers Previous rank: 3 Latest stats: 8 games, 23.3 ppg, 4.0 rpg, 6.9 apg Season stats: 19.3 ppg, 3.0 rpg, 5.2 apg We didn\u2019t forget . Williams started the stint with his first career triple-double. If that wasn\u2019t enough, he poured in a career-high 39 four games later. If that wasn\u2019t enough, he added 31 two games after that. Despite closing out the period with a relative stinker (10 points in 17 minutes), Williams is averaging 24.5 in February after 20.4 in January. 4. Marc Gasol (34), Toronto Raptors Previous rank: 5 Latest stats: 6 games, 18.0 ppg, 8.0 rpg, 3.7 apg Season stats: 15.7 ppg, 8.6 rpg, 4.7 apg It was another mixed bag for Gasol, who managed two games of 24 or more, two games of 18-19 points and two games between 8-11 points. We fully expect Gasol to step up now that he\u2019s playing on a team in the Raptors with serious title aspirations, as he should be able to integrate nicely with both the offense and defense. 5. Rudy Gay (32), San Antonio Spurs Previous rank: 8 Latest stats: 8 games, 16.5 ppg, 6.0 rpg, 3.1 apg Season stats: 14.4 ppg, 6.3 rpg, 2.5 apg Shooting 50.5 from the field and 52.2 from beyond the arc, Gay turned in six games of 15 or more points. He\u2019s now managed to score in double figures in 12 straight while shooting better than 50 percent in eight of those contests. No wonder he\u2019s shooting a career-best 52.2 percent from the field. 6. J.J. Redick (34), Philadelphia 76ers Previous rank: 4 Latest stats: 3 games, 16.7 ppg, 1.3 rpg, 2.7 apg Season stats: 18.3 ppg, 2.2 rpg, 2.8 apg A small sample size is the reason for Redick\u2019s slip, as he failed to make any big impressions in his three games. He did, however, shoot 42.3 from deep (11-for-26) while scoring 13 or more in all three. But he\u2019ll need to pocket more 20-point games if he hopes to climb back to where he was. 7. Kyle Lowry (32), Toronto Raptors Previous rank: 6 Latest stats: 5 games, 14.2 ppg, 4.4 rpg, 8.4 apg Season stats: 14.2 ppg, 4.5 rpg, 9.3 apg In three wins, Lowry averaged 17.3 points and 9.3 assists. In two losses, he averaged 9.5 points and 7.0 assists. But the shooting remains a big issue. Lowry\u2019s 40.6 FG% is his lowest since 2012-13 (40.1) and his 32.5 3PT% is his lowest since \u201909-10 (27.2). On a positive, Lowry\u2019s 9.3 assists per game easily rise to a career-best mark. 8. Jeff Green (32), Washington Wizards Previous rank: Just missed Latest stats: 7 games, 19.9 ppg, 3.9 rpg, 3.1 apg Season stats: 12.6 ppg, 4.5 rpg, 1.9 apg Shooting 50.0 percent from the field and 42.3 from 3-point range, Green went for 20 or more points in five of seven games, including four straight \u2014 his longest such stretch all season. Green\u2019s stellar run has been boosted by increased playing time; he\u2019s averaging 35.7 minutes in three February games after averaging 30.5 minutes in 14 January games. 9. Chris Paul (33), Houston Rockets Previous rank: NA Latest stats: 5 games, 15.0 ppg, 3.8 rpg, 7.2 apg Season stats: 15.5 ppg, 4.0 rpg, 7.9 apg Paul finally returned to action Jan. 27 after missing 17 games with a hamstring injury. He\u2019s managed to turn in five straight double-figure scoring games to go along with six or more assists in four of the games. There\u2019s a little rust, but we like what we see, especially the 2.4 steals and 47.2 FG% during the span. 10. Al Horford (32), Boston Celtics Previous rank: 10 Latest stats: 7 games, 14.6 ppg, 7.9 rpg, 5.1 apg Season stats: 12.6 ppg, 6.6 rpg, 3.8 apg Horford started the stint on fire, turning in back-to-back double-doubles for the first time this season. Yes, you read that right. In addition to the double-doubles, he shot 60.3 percent from the field and 2.3 blocks, including a season-best six blocks in last Monday\u2019s win over the Nets.

Several others returned from long absences due to injury. Let\u2019s dive right in. Anthony Davis, New Orleans Pelicans When Jimmy Butler played his first home game for the Timberwolves after requesting a trade, there was a mixed reaction among the crowd when he was introduced in the starting lineup. Some fans booed. Some fans cheered. Many felt awkward. But after a while, the mixture of boos and cheers were drowned out by the latter as Butler went to work and posted 33 points in a victory for the home team. The scene was somewhat similar to how things went for Anthony Davis on Friday \u2015 against Butler\u2019s old team at that. Davis, who requested a trade a week and a half ago but wasn\u2019t dealt before the deadline, returned to the Pelicans\u2019 lineup, shrugged off early jeers and went off for 32 points in a 122-117 home triumph. Davis had initially been out of the lineup for three weeks due to a left index finger injury, but once he was healthy, the Pelicans held the All-Star forward out until after the trade deadline had passed. With no deal done, the team announced Thursday night he\u2019d play the remainder of the season. Meanwhile, Davis was held out during the entire fourth quarter on Friday. Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said he purposefully limited his minutes since Davis had been sidelined since Jan. 18. \u201cI was not going to have him \u2013 first game back \u2013 play 38, 40 minutes,\u201d Gentry said afterwards. \u201cWe had talked about playing between 22 and 25 minutes. That\u2019s why he didn\u2019t go back in the game. I thought he played well the minutes that he was in there and did a great job. He was typical Anthony.\u201d As for the boos, which might be sprinkled in at Smoothie King Center throughout the rest of the season, Davis doesn\u2019t appear to have a problem with it. \u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t bother me.\u201d Caris LeVert, Brooklyn Nets When Nets guard Caris LeVert was carried off the court in a stretcher in November, it looked as if his promising season was over. But the third-year player, who was diagnosed with a dislocated foot, was fortunate enough to avoid any fractures. He missed nearly three months and was welcomed to a standing ovation in Brooklyn. LeVert scored 11 points and tied his career high with five steals, four of which came within a span of four minutes. Kevin Love, Cleveland Cavaliers After missing the last 50 games due to left foot surgery, Kevin Love returned to the Cavaliers\u2019 lineup on an extremely tight minutes restriction. He scored four points in six minutes, but backed down former teammate Jeff Green for his first bucket since Oct. 24. Tobias Harris, Philadelphia 76ers While everyone was interested in watching how Harris would look in his Sixers debut \u2015 especially alongside the team\u2019s other three All-Star caliber players \u2015 it was the fifth member of their starting lineup that torched Denver all night. JJ Redick carried the team with a season-high 34 points and overshadowed Harris\u2019 debut, but the newly acquired Sixer was still effective in a 117-110 win over the Nuggets. Harris poured in 14 points, 8 rebounds and 3 assists. Bobby Portis, Washington Wizards The best debut took place in the nation\u2019s capital, where Bobby Portis lit the Cavaliers on fire with a dominant performance off the bench. In the game\u2019s first six minutes, the former Chicago Bull dropped 16 points on 6-for-6 shooting. He ended the night with 30 points as Washington handled Cleveland 119-106. Jabari Parker, Washington Wizards  After Friday\u2019s win, Portis said he thinks \u201cthe Wizards got a steal with me and Jabari because we\u2019re two versatile bigs.\u201d While it\u2019s far too early to determine if the first half of that statement is accurate, Parker showcased an array of skills in his Wizards debut, enough to approach a triple-double. The 6-foot-8 forward recorded seven points, 11 rebounds and nine assists. For reference: The last Wizard to post that stat line without any turnovers was Wes Unseld in 1980 . His most impressive play came when he split two defenders for an aggressive dunk. Otto Porter Jr., Chicago Bulls To the other side of the trade: Porter played his first game with Chicago and connected on his first three 3-point attempts (although Portis wasn\u2019t that impressed ). His presence helped a floundering Bulls team take down a hot Brooklyn squad as he finished with 18 points on 7-of-9 shooting from the field. He even broke some ankles in the process: Other debuts Dennis Smith Jr., who registered a new career high 31 points in just his third game with the New York Knicks, is clearly ready for next Saturday night .  An exciting night in Philly included a special halftime moment when the 76ers sent Moses Malone\u2019s No. 2 jersey to the rafters. The late Malone played a total of five seasons in Philadelphia and helped bring the city a championship in 1983, the same year he won his third Most Valuable Player award. Malone was reportedly uncomfortable with the idea of his jersey being retired in Philadelphia, but said he\u2019d approve under one condition: The Sixers would have to add 48 extra names to the banner. Those additions? Every teammate Malone had with the 76ers. Each player\u2019s name surrounded the edge of the banner, joining the Hall of Famer and 13-time All-Star in the Philadelphia rafters.

After 10 days of team-wide uncertainty during their widely reported pursuit of disgruntled New Orleans superstar Anthony Davis, Pelinka said he believes the Lakers will bounce back strongly. Pelinka already saw signs of it Thursday night, when Los Angeles beat Boston on Rajon Rondo\u2019s dramatic winning basket just a few hours after the deadline passed and Davis remained with the Pelicans. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve come to learn is that any time in life you face a challenge or a moment of adversity, you have to look at that as an opportunity,\u201d Pelinka said Friday. \u201cWhen you go through anything as a team, if you go through adversity, you can choose how to respond. Does it draw you closer together, or does it push you further apart?\u201d Pelinka and his boss, Magic Johnson, also remain confident in the Lakers\u2019 ability to end the franchise\u2019s five-year playoff drought this spring, even without Davis in purple and gold. After a prolonged slump during the longest injury absence of LeBron James\u2019 16-year NBA career, the Lakers (28-27) began Friday in 10th place in the Western Conference, but just three games behind sixth-place Utah. The Lakers\u2019 playoff drought is more than double the previous longest in franchise history. \u201cI think we \u2014 really (owner) Jeanie (Buss), Magic, Luke and I \u2014 are all aligned,\u201d Pelinka said. \u201cWe really want to make a push to try to make the playoffs this year. It\u2019s been a five-year absence for our fans, and we think that\u2019s an important step to return to contending for championships.\u201d The drama of the past several days could be a turning point in that quest. Pelinka and Johnson traded away three players this week, and several more Lakers spent several days wondering if they were about to leave for New Orleans. The speculation surrounding the Lakers\u2019 young core certainly appeared to be a distraction Tuesday at Indiana when Los Angeles looked lifeless in a 42-point loss. Pacers fans taunted the young Lakers about their possibly imminent departures in a megadeal for Davis. In the end, the Lakers only dealt Michael Beasley, Ivica Zubac and rookie Svi Mykhailiuk in two trades, getting elite outside shooters Reggie Bullock and Mike Muscala in return. The new guys joined the Lakers in Philadelphia on Friday, and they could play in Sunday\u2019s game against the 76ers. Although Pelinka can\u2019t directly discuss Davis because of league tampering rules, the Pelicans didn\u2019t trade their All-Star anywhere despite Davis\u2019 apparently significant interest in joining James in LA. Pelinka also declined to speculate whether some teams simply don\u2019t want to make deals that would help the glamorous Lakers or LeBron. \u201cThe thing I\u2019ve learned in negotiating is you can only control your own tenor and your own discussions on your side, and try to approach everything to be smartly aggressive and treat every negotiation with dignity and professionalism,\u201d said Pelinka, a former agent. \u201cI think in general, around the league, that\u2019s what you get. \u2026 In terms of, \u2018Is there a jealousy because of the Lakers\u2019 success over the years, or because of a perceived advantage because of the city that we\u2019re in?\u2032 That\u2019s probably a better question for you to ask the other teams. I\u2019d rather not sit in a seat of judgment on what other people might think.\u201d Pelinka praised Bullock and Muscala as floor-spacers who will help the Lakers\u2019 outside shooting, which has been terrible at times. The GM doesn\u2019t see the acquisition of two perimeter scorers as a change in the Lakers\u2019 early-season plan of surrounding James with versatile playmakers, rather than Cleveland-style shooting specialists. Instead, Pelinka said the moves were inspired by the injury absences of James, Rondo and Lonzo Ball \u2014 or \u201cthe engine drivers,\u201d as he called them. \u201cOnce we started having injuries at the playmaking positions, the game slows down,\u201d Pelinka said. \u201cWe can\u2019t play quite at the same pace. If everyone on the roster were healthy, we would be playing with more pace in transition.\u201d The Lakers have an open roster spot after their dealings, and Pelinka said the club is weighing whether to fill it now or later in the month before the deadline March 1. Carmelo Anthony and Markieff Morris have been widely mentioned as candidates for the spot. The Lakers are in a four-week stretch with just one home game, returning from the All-Star break to face Houston on Feb. 21. Right after that, the Lakers play two of their next three games against Davis and the Pelicans, including their visit to Staples Center on Feb. 27."},{"id":35675,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/kevin-love-returns-cleveland-cavaliers-lineup","date":"2019-02-09","title":"Love returns for Cavaliers after missing 50 games","content":"Kevin Love was back in the Cleveland Cavaliers\u2019 starting lineup Friday night after missing 50 games with a toe injury.

In an interview with a Boston radio station today, though, Celtics president of basketball operations Danny Ainge sounded confident Irving will end up staying put. The Boston Celtics cannot do anything about Irving\u2019s future until July 1. On that date \u2014 the opening of free agency \u2014 Irving will have his choice of staying with the Celtics or testing the free-agent waters. Ainge was a guest Friday on 98.5 The Sports Hub\u2019s \u201cToucher & Rich\u201d show and shared his thoughts on Irving\u2019s recent comments and his future with Boston. \u201cThe way I view the situation is, I think a lot of people because of Kyrie\u2019s announcement beginning of the year, thought that there was a marriage,\u201d Ainge said, per the \u201cToucher & Rich\u201d web site . \u201cI think it\u2019s more like an engagement and we\u2019re going to get married on July 1. And I think that engagement is still on as far as I know in my individual conversations with Kyrie; still engaged but we can\u2019t make those vows, sign that contract until July 1.\u201d When he spoke with reporters in New York last Friday, though, Irving offered up a near 180-degree turn on his stance of staying with Boston . With rumors swirling about the New York Knicks and other teams and that Irving may not be fully committed to his earlier stance to stay in Boston, Irving was asked about his mindset in re-signing. His answer?: \u201cAsk me July 1.\u201d Further, Irving said of his potential change of heart about staying in Boston: \u201cI don\u2019t owe anybody [expletive].\u201d Ainge said Friday he and Irving have had a \u201ccouple of conversations\u201d since Irving made those comments last Friday.  \u201cI don\u2019t really know all that was going on with him. But we\u2019ve have had some good conversations,\u201d Ainge said. \u201cI think you\u2019d have to ask Kyrie [about why he didn\u2019t say he\u2019d re-sign with Boston], but I think that he just doesn\u2019t like his name in all these rumors and associated with all these other players. I think he likes to be his own man and have his own mind and his own opinions. I feel like there\u2019s still a chance on July 1 that he stays here and that\u2019s what we\u2019re shooting for. We still have a date on July 1.\u201d The questioning of Irving last week came in the wake of the Knicks clearing salary cap space after their blockbuster trade of Kristaps Porzingis last week to the Dallas Mavericks. By making that trade, the Knicks could potentially have enough salary cap space to sign Irving and perhaps another top-level free agent. Still, Irving in now way closed the door on staying with Boston, either. He said he has confidence in the team, adding: \u201cobviously Boston is still at the head of the race,\u201d in keeping his services. Irving is averaging 23.8 points. 4.9 rebounds and seven assists per game this season for the Celtics, who are 35-20 and No. 4 in the Eastern Conference . The six-time All-Star\u2019s future has been a trending topic entering the final year of his contract. Rumors persisted that several teams, including the nearby Knicks, were harboring hopes luring Irving via free agency. On Oct. 5, Irving spoke with reporters and reiterated his commitment to re-sign with the Celtics when the summer of 2019 rolls around. \u201cI\u2019m talking to our media people and we\u2019re just like \u2018I think you\u2019re supposed to say something.\u2019 I\u2019m like, you know what, timing is everything with this. I\u2019m glad I can share this with the Boston fans and everybody there,\u201d Irving said. \u201cI was just happy to get it done with. I just have every intent to sign back. I just wanted to clear that up.\u201d Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":46527,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/kia-mvp-ladder-week-17-2018-19","date":"2019-02-08","title":"Kia MVP Ladder: Bucks' trade deadline deal could bolster Antetokounmpo's bid","content":" With potential power moves being made all around the league, most notably in the upper echelon of the Eastern Conference , Thursday\u2019s trade deadline produced the desired effect in most places. Teams that felt they were maybe one key piece away did their business and are now prepared for the stretch run of this season. By the same token, the players involved in this season\u2019s Kia MVP race have the landscape settled as they make their final push for the league\u2019s most prestigious regular-season honor. And perhaps no player will benefit more from the deadline shake up than Milwaukee Bucks\u2019 superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo, who moves back into the pole position on this week\u2019s Kia Race to the MVP Ladder. \u201cThe field is pretty much set now,\u201d a Western Conference scout told me in the aftermath of a busy trade deadline. \u201cAnd some of the deals that went down will impact everything, the standings and I\u2019m sure the MVP debate. [Nikola Mirotic] could be a real game changer for the Bucks if he\u2019s right physically. You add another shooter with size like that to a group that\u2019s already locked and loaded around Giannis \u2026 that\u2019s a huge matchup problem for the rest of the league. \u201cI know a lot of people had [James] Harden at the top of their list after what he\u2019s done the last five or six weeks. But Giannis has been the guy for me all along. He\u2019s been there from the start and hasn\u2019t let up, hasn\u2019t had a prolonged dip in his performance this entire season. He\u2019s got the slight edge, in my eyes, especially with the addition of another piece like Mirotic.\u201d The Philadelphia 76ers addition of Tobias Harris could have a similar effect for Joel Embiid, another member of the Kia Race to the MVP Ladder top five. His position here has been fortified now that the trade deadline is over. Marc Gasol\u2019s addition to Toronto\u2019s lineup is a huge upgrade for the Raptors, but might not boost Kawhi Leonard\u2019s MVP case. Harden\u2019s not going away, not as long as his streak of 30-point games (28 and counting) continues. The Oklahoma City Thunder\u2019s Paul George is in the mix, as is two-time Kia MVP and Golden State Warriors star Stephen Curry and Denver Nuggets center Nikola Jokic. You can never count out LeBron James, whose bid for a fifth Kia MVP took a huge hit with his 17-game injury absence that dented the Los Angeles Lakers\u2019 early season rise. Time isn\u2019t on his side, though. With the buyout market the only real way to alter a team at this point, the field is basically set. You might want to get your popcorn ready for what could \u2014 and should \u2014 be a wild finish. * * * The top five this week in the 2018-19 Kia Race to the MVP Ladder: * * * Last week:  No. 2 Season stats:  27 points, 12.4 rebounds, 5.9 assists, 1.5 steals, 1.4 blocks The Bucks raised the ante in the Eastern Conference at the trade deadline, adding yet another big shooter to their mix in Nikola Mirotic . That\u2019s just one more reason teams won\u2019t be able to clutter things up in the paint when facing Antetokounmpo, the league\u2019s most devastating rim attacker this season. And if you can believe it, \u201cThe Greek Freak\u201d is actually getting better at assaulting the rim as the season wears on. In Wednesday\u2019s win against the Washington Wizards , he shot a preposterous 17-for-21 (.810) and finished with 43 points in the Bucks\u2019 highest scoring game of the season. His six rebounds, four assists and three steals were a bonus on a night when he Eric Bledsoe took turns shredding the Wizards\u2019 defense. Lost in the flurry of James Harden\u2019s huge January was the fact that Antetokounmpo has been the NBA\u2019s most consistently dominant force from the start of training camp to now. Last week:  No. 1 Season stats:  36.5 points, 7.9 assists, 6.8 rebounds, 2.2 steals The Rockets are 10-7 in their last 17 games and firmly entrenched in the thick of the Western Conference playoff chase as All-Star weekend nears . Harden\u2019s wicked grind continues as his streak of 30-point scoring games stands at 28 as a Saturday showdown with the Oklahoma City Thunder looms ( 8:30 ET, ABC ). After Rockets GM Daryl Morey made trade deadline tweaks to the roster \u2014 and with the prospect of key players returning soon \u2014 the Rockets seem to be exactly where they want to be as the season\u2019s stretch run looms. Harden is in a similarly sweet spot in his quest for back-to-back Kia MVPs. In his most recent masterpiece, he scored 36 points and shot 8-for-13 on 3-pointers in a blowout win against the Kings . He\u2019ll have the chance to make his MVP case with his actions the rest of the way, which is all he can ask for after helping revive a seemingly lost Rockets season. Last week:  No. 5 Season stats:  28.0 points 7.9 rebounds, 4.0 assists, 2.3 steals Much of the attention on the Thunder these days is focused on Russell Westbrook and his eight straight triple-doubles . Only Wilt Chamberlain (nine straight in 1968) had more. There\u2019s no question Westbrook has been outstanding. But George has been even better in his role as the Thunder\u2019s best player this season. They\u2019ve won nine of their last 10 games and, during that stretch, George is averaging 34 points, 7.4 rebounds, 4.7 assists and 2.5 steals. Thanks to a trade during the All-Star Draft on Thursday, Westbrook and George will pair on Team Giannis to see if they can bring some of that same energy to the NBA All-Star Game . Charlotte is the perfect place for George to be recognized for the way he\u2019s performed this season. He\u2019s in a groove right now while positioning the Thunder as perhaps the greatest threat to the Golden State Warriors\u2019 death-grip on the Western Conference crown.  Last week:  No. 3 Season stats:  28.9 points, 5.4 assists, 5.1 rebounds, 1.2 steals Curry is coming off back-to-back un-Steph-like games (19 points in Wednesday\u2019s win against the Spurs ) and just 14 on 5-for-15 shooting ( in Saturday\u2019s win over the Lakers ). That means the Suns should brace themselves for a nuclear effort tonight in Phoenix ( 9 ET, NBA League Pass ). The good part for the Warriors is that their depth is so great that they can endure a couple of rough shooting nights from their most impactful player and still win (they have won 15 of their last 17 games). The Warriors are in a great space right now with DeMarcus Cousins incorporated into the mix without so much as a hiccup. Curry will get the chance to enjoy his trip home to Charlotte for NBA All-Star 2019 , where he will battle his brother Seth (and others) for the MTN Dew 3-Point Contest on Saturday and take in all of the positive vibes that come with being the unofficial host of the weekend on his home turf. Come Sunday, he\u2019ll star on Team Giannis . Golden State\u2019s three-peat business, of course, will crank up to epic levels coming into that weekend. Last week:  No. 4 Season stats:  27.4 points, 13.5 rebounds, 3.6 assists, 2 blocks Win or lose, Embiid has been dominant for a Sixers team that has morphed into a potential nightmare for the entire league with the addition of Tobias Harris. Unlike the hiccups both Embiid and Jimmy Butler endured as they tried to manage Butler\u2019s transition into their mix, there should be no such issues with Harris. Embiid has the Butler experience to draw from and Harris isn\u2019t the type of player to get in the way of the greater good for the sake of his own numbers. And if there\u2019s one thing Sixers coach Brett Brown and his staff can lean on at this time, it\u2019s Embiid\u2019s thirst for dominating the competition. DeMarcus Cousins got a taste of it last week in the Sixers\u2019 huge win at Oracle Arena, when Embiid overcame his own eight turnovers to pummel the champs for 26 points, 20 rebounds and five assists . He hit the Sacramento Kings with 29 points, 17 rebounds and four blocks Saturday and the Raptors with 37 points, 13 rebounds and three blocks . The Sixers lost both games, but you can bet Embiid will have his new-look crew amped up for tonight\u2019s showdown with fellow All-Star big man Nicola Jokic and the Denver Nuggets ( 7 ET, ESPN ). * * * 6.

The Western Conference remains the stronger conference overall. Through Thursday, the West is 170-128 in interconference games, set to have the better cumulative record for the 20th time in the last 21 seasons. And the two-time defending champion Golden State Warriors are still the clear favorite to win the 2019 NBA Finals. But the East may have four of the best five teams in the league. The Milwaukee Bucks, Boston Celtics, Toronto Raptors and Philadelphia 76ers are the only four teams in the league that rank in the top 12 in both offensive and defensive efficiency, and three of those four teams made significant upgrades at the trade deadline. The fourth \u2014 Boston \u2014 is the one that reached Game 7 of the conference finals without its best player last year. >  Recapping all the deals from trade deadline day The Milwaukee Bucks, Philadelphia 76ers and Toronto Raptors all brought their upgrades from the West. Let\u2019s dive into the deadline moves regarding the three teams that will likely fight with the Celtics to be the first non-LeBron James team to represent the East in The Finals since 2010 (with apologies to the resilient Indiana Pacers, who moved into third place in the East with a win over the Clippers on Thursday)\u2026 Trade 1: Philadelphia traded Wilson Chandler, Mike Muscala, Landry Shamet, two first-round picks (2020, \u201921) and two second-round picks to the Clippers for Tobias Harris, Boban Marjanovic and Mike Scott. Trade 2: The Sixers acquired James Ennis from Houston in exchange for a swap of 2021 second-round picks. Trade 3: The Sixers traded Markelle Fultz to Orlando for Jonathon Simmons, a 2019 first-round pick, and a 2019 second-round pick. * * * Exactly one year before they made the Harris trade (on Feb. 6, 2018), the Sixers were 25-25 and tied with the Detroit Pistons for eighth place in the Eastern Conference . Since then, things have accelerated quickly. They went 27-5 to close the 2017-18 regular season, won a playoff series, and have been big-game hunting ever since. With their two All-Stars only 22 and 24 years old, the Sixers could have maintained patience. But four weeks into the season, they added to their urgency by trading two starters (both under contract beyond this season) for Jimmy Butler, who has the option to become a free agent this summer. The Sixers are 21-11 with Butler, but just 1-3 against Boston ( 0-1 ) and Toronto ( 1-2 , with Kawhi Leonard having missed the one game the Sixers won). They haven\u2019t played Milwaukee since the second week of the season (and they lost that game too). The Sixers\u2019 starting lineup with Butler and Chandler outscored its opponents by 13 points per 100 possessions, the fifth-best mark among 28 lineups that have played at least 200 minutes together. Harris in Chandler\u2019s place makes that lineup more potent; Harris is one of five players that have averaged at least 20 points per game while shooting 45 percent or better from the field and 40 percent or better from 3-point range. He has an effective field goal percentage of 51.8 percent on pull-up jumpers, the eighth-best mark among 54 players who have attempted at least 200 (with teammate J.J. Redick one of the six players ahead of him). But Harris, like Butler before him, will have an adjustment to make with his new team. With the Clippers this season, he had a career-high usage rate of 23.3 percent and had been assisted on just 46.5 percent of his field goals ( down from 59.3 percent last season ). Chandler had a usage rate of just 11.2 percent when he played with the Sixers\u2019 other four starters. But the Sixers stagger the minutes of their starters, so that (when they\u2019re all healthy) there at least two on the floor at all times. Since Butler\u2019s first game with the Sixers, he and Simmons have played 910 minutes together , Redick and Embiid have played 862 minutes together, and the four have all been on the floor together for just 375 minutes total . Part of that is some missed games here and there, but really, adding Harris to the mix is not just about how all five guys fit together. That\u2019s where the Sixers\u2019 other two trades come in. The Sixers\u2019 starting lineup (with Chandler) averaged just 12.7 minutes per game together . Last season\u2019s starting lineup ( the best high-usage lineup in the league ) averaged just 12.3 minutes per game together (and just 9.2 in the playoffs ). That leaves more than 35 minutes per game where other guys need to contribute. And after the Harris trade, the Sixers didn\u2019t have a lot of other guys, especially on the wings. The two trades they made on Thursday give them additional depth and athleticism, though it\u2019s not clear that either guy will be a net positive in the playoff rotation. Ennis wasn\u2019t able to replace what Trevor Ariza brought (on both ends of the floor) to the Rockets and his catch-and-shoot 3-point percentage (36.2 percent) ranks just 96th among 152 players with at least 100 attempts. But he has seen a career-high mark in effective field goal percentage (59.7 percent), having basically eliminated mid-range shots ( he took just one ) upon his move to Houston. Simmons, meanwhile, has had a rough season in Orlando. His effective field goal percentage of 39.7 percent is down from 51.1 percent last season and ranks dead last among 273 players with at least 200 field goal attempts. The Magic scored an anemic 98.6 points per 100 possessions with him on the floor ( compared to 106.4 with him off the floor ). Mike Scott should get some rotation minutes as well. He was the league\u2019s second-best mid-range shooter last season (56.3 percent on 158 attempts), but has barely shot from mid-range this season, with just 28 (12 percent) of his 230 attempts coming from between the paint and the 3-point line. He has shot 41.6 percent on catch-and-shoot 3-pointers, the 23rd best mark among 152 players who have attempted at least 100 and much better than Muscala (34.9 percent). Sixers Projected Depth Chart (two-deep) PG: B. Simmons, McConnell SG: Redick, J. Simmons SF: Butler, Ennis PF: Harris, Scott C: Embiid, Marjanovic The trade: In a three-team deal, the Bucks traded Thon Maker, Jason Smith, and four future second-round picks for Nikola Mirotic. * * * Mirotic, a 6-foot-10 forward who has shot 37 percent from 3-point range over the last two seasons, appears to be a great fit for the team that ranks second in the percentage of their shots that have come from 3-point range and alongside the player \u2014 Giannis Antetokounmpo \u2014 who ranks second in the league in assists on 3-pointers. Mirotic will likely come off the bench, but should play plenty of minutes alongside Antetokounmpo, who has been starting the second quarter with the Bucks\u2019 reserves. The Bucks have been playing somewhat positionless on the frontline, with Maker out of the rotation and Ersan Ilyasova playing fewer minutes of late (he played just 6:33 in the Bucks\u2019 big win in Toronto last week). Since trading John Henson on Dec. 7, the Bucks have outscored their opponents by nine points per 100 possessions in 156 minutes with Antetokounmpo at center. That number is worse than the Bucks\u2019 overall point differential ( a league-best 9.9 points per 100 possessions ), but still very good. Mirotic gives them another shooter to use in those lineups. Mirotic\u2019s catch-and-shoot 3-point percentage (38.1 percent) ranks just 68th among 152 players with at least 100 catch-and-shoot attempts, but Antetokounmpo should help him in that regard. Mirotic had a much higher effective field goal percentage on 208 shots with Anthony Davis on the floor ( 59.6 percent ) than he did on 199 shots with Davis off the floor (50.5 percent). Health has been an issue with Mirotic, who has missed 51 games (including the last seven with a strained calf) over the last two seasons. But the Bucks were already the best team in the Eastern Conference. They\u2019re the only team in the league that ranks in the top five in both offensive and defensive efficiency, their point differential (9.9 points per 100 possessions) is tops by a wide margin , and they\u2019re 5-2 against Boston ( 1-1 ), Philadelphia ( 1-0 ) and Toronto ( 3-1 ). Bucks Projected Depth Chart (two-deep) PG: Bledsoe, Hill SG: Brogdon, Brown SF: Middleton, Snell PF: Antetokounmpo, Mirotic C: Lopez, Ilyasova The trade: Toronto traded C.J. Miles, Jonas Valanciunas, Delon Wright and a 2024 second-round pick to Memphis for Marc Gasol. * * * Gasol is an upgrade at center for the Raptors, offering a more diverse skill set than Valanciunas, who was just set to return from a 25-game absence (dislocated left thumb) when he was traded. Valanciunas started shooting 3-pointers last season, but Gasol was a year ahead of him in that regard and much more comfortable beyond the arc. Brook Lopez and Karl-Anthony Towns are the only centers with more 3-pointers than Gasol this season . And Nikola Jokic is the only center with more assists . While Gasol ranks fifth among 52 centers that averaged at least 15 minutes in 25 games or more with an assist rate of 21.8 percent, Valanciunas ranks 49th, having assisted on just 7.8 percent of his possessions. Of course, Valanciunas scores more often and more efficiently inside. Over the last three seasons, Valanciunas has shot 61 percent in the paint, where he has taken 78 percent of his shots. Over the same time, Gasol has shot just 50 percent in the paint, where he has taken 44 percent of his shots. Gasol leads the league in elbow touches (8.7 per game) for the sixth straight season (every season for which we have Second Spectrum tracking data). As a team, the Raptors rank 24th with just 10.8 elbow touches per game and won\u2019t need to run the offense through Gasol at the high post as much as Memphis did. Gasol will help on the other end of the floor, though. While he\u2019s not the same player that he was when he was the 2012-13 Defensive Player of the Year, he\u2019s still the guy that has been anchoring a top-10 defense this season. As bad as the Grizzlies have been overall, they ranked sixth in defensive efficiency through Wednesday and allowed just 97.6 points per 100 possessions in 945 minutes with Gasol on the floor with rookie Jaren Jackson Jr. We\u2019ll see if Gasol plays any minutes alongside Serge Ibaka, who has been the Raptors\u2019 starting center in 42 of their 56 games and played just 29 minutes total alongside the Raptors\u2019 other centers (Valanciunas, Greg Monroe \u2014 who was traded to Brooklyn on Thursday \u2014 and Chris Boucher). Assuming Gasol and Ibaka play only limited minutes together, one of them will have to come off the bench. It would have been tough to break up the current starting lineup earlier in the season. Through Dec. 3, the Raptors\u2019 starting group had outscored its opponents by 15.1 points per 100 possessions in 258 minutes. Injuries and continuity have been issues, but since then, the starting group has been outscored by 6.2 points per 100 possessions in 169 minutes, with the bigger drop-off coming on defense. So Gasol might be able to help that group get right. The Raptors\u2019 bench is another issue. Miles and Wright were part of the Raptors\u2019 terrific, five-man bench unit from a year ago. In 340 minutes, that group outscored its opponents by 19.2 points per 100 possessions, the sixth best mark among 48 lineups that played at least 200 minutes last season . But the Raptors\u2019 bench just hasn\u2019t been the same this season . One reason is that Miles has shot just 31 percent from 3-point range and his shooting is the one reason he was in the rotation. He was 13-for-27 from beyond the arc over the last three weeks , but was still the 11th man in the rotation (behind Norman Powell) on some nights. So with the trade, the Raptors kept the top seven guys in their rotation (their five starters, Fred VanVleet and OG Anunoby), got an upgrade at spot No. 8, and lost their ninth or 10th man. Like the Sixers, they will certainly look to add another piece or two in the buyout market.

They may have just gotten better after a trade that sends New Orleans Pelicans sharpshooter Nikola Mirotic to Milwaukee. ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski and Zach Lowe were the first to report the deal. Wojnarowski reports that the Bucks will send veteran center Jason Smith and Stanley Johnson to New Orleans to complete the deal. In addition, the trade will include the Pistons and will send multiple second-round picks to the Pelicans for Mirotic, Wojnarowski reports. Marc Stein of The New York Times reports the Pelicans will net four second-round picks in the deal. SI\u2019s Jake Fischer reports the picks New Orleans will acquire from Milwaukee in the trade are the Washington Wizards\u2019 picks in 2020 and 2021. On Wednesday, the Bucks dealt Thon Maker to the Detroit Pistons to acquire Johnson. That trade was never officially announced, though, and now Johnson will be on his way to New Orleans. The move also opens a roster spot for the Bucks, which they could use to add a player off the buyout market. >  Recapping all the deals from trade deadline day The Bucks are third in the NBA in 3-pointers made (707), rank second in 3-pointers attempted (2,398) and are tied for 12th in 3-point percentage (35.5). Mirotic should fit in nicely with Milwaukee, as he is on pace for another season with at least 100 3-pointers made (he\u2019s currently at 85) and is making 36.8 percent of his 3-pointers, too. Overall, Mirotic is averaging 16.7 points, 8.3 rebounds and 1.1 assists per game in 28.9 minutes per game. To date, the Bucks have only two players who have made more than 100 3-pointers this season \u2014 center Brook Lopez and All-Star guard Khris Middleton. The addition of Mirotic will allow Milwaukee to further stretch defense and provide more room for All-Star and Kia MVP candidate Giannis Antetokounmpo to work on the court."},{"id":35673,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/marc-gasol-toronto-raptors-report-trade","date":"2019-02-08","title":"Raptors close deal for Marc Gasol","content":" The Memphis Grizzlies have taken another big step toward rebuilding their roster, trading center Marc Gasol and leaving Mike Conley as the lone remaining piece from the core four of the franchise\u2019s best success. The trade, which was first reported by ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski , will send Jonas Valanciunas, Delon Wright, CJ Miles, and a 2024 second-round pick to the Grizzlies for Gasol. The 34-year-old Gasol is averaging 15.7 points, 8.6 rebounds and 4.7 assists over 53 games with the Grizzlies this season. Gasol has spent his entire 11-year career with the Grizzlies. The Raptors (39-16) currently sit in second place in the East. The addition of Gasol should help them keep pace with the Milwaukee Bucks and Philadelphia 76ers, who both made moves before Thursday\u2019s NBA trade deadline. Jonas Valanciunas had been sidelined since Dec. 12 with a dislocated left thumb. Prior to the trade, Valanciunas was expected to return to the Raptors\u2019 lineup against the Atlanta Hawks on Thursday night. >  Recapping all the deals from trade deadline day The Grizzlies traded Gasol, more than two weeks after owner Robert Pera told both Gasol and Conley that they would be listening to offers for two of the league\u2019s longest-tenured teammates. Trading Gasol at least got Memphis something out of a 34-year-old center, who holds a $25 million option he can exercise this summer. Conley had been linked to Utah, Detroit and even Toronto along with Gasol in a handful of reports, though $67 million over the final two seasons of the max contract Conley signed in July 2016 didn\u2019t make a trade easier to piece together. Conley said Grizzlies general manager Chris Wallace called him around 15 minutes before the deadline saying the guard would stick around. \u201cI was prepared for either,\u201d Conley said Thursday night after a 117-95 loss in Oklahoma City . \u201cWhat happens, happens, and I\u2019m here. No matter where I was going to be, I\u2019m all in. No hard feelings. I\u2019m just going to do my job and try to do my best for this team and the guys we have here because they pay me to play, and that\u2019s what we do.\u201d Grizzlies coach J.B. Bickerstaff said before the game he didn\u2019t expect all the trade rumors to be an issue with Conley. \u201cWith him, just knowing his personality and who he is, I never got the sense that he didn\u2019t want to be here,\u201d Bickerstaff said. \u201cAgain, another guy that\u2019s meant a ton to this organization. Memphis is home for him and his family, those types of things. He understands the nature of this business and how it can impact everyone from All-Star caliber players on down.\u201d Instead, the point guard whose 771 games played is a franchise-high \u2013 just ahead of Gasol\u2019s 769 \u2013 is preparing to play without Gasol and with new teammates after a handful of other moves by the Grizzlies. Conley said he thought he was ready for this but found himself dealing with an unfamiliar locker room. \u201cIt\u2019s a completely different feel,\u201d Conley said. \u201cYou get out there to play and you\u2019re bringing the guys in the huddle and there\u2019s no Marc.\u201d Memphis sent Garrett Temple and JaMychal Green to the Clippers for guard Avery Bradley and confirmed Thursday night both swapping Shelvin Mack to Atlanta for Tyler Dorsey and waiving forward Omri Casspi, who\u2019s recovering from a torn meniscus in his right knee. The Grizzlies let Zach Randolph and Tony Allen leave in 2017 after the franchise\u2019s seventh straight postseason appearance. They tried to rebuild around Conley and Gasol, who had been among just six active NBA players to spend their entire NBA careers of at least 10 seasons with one franchise. They won just 22 games last season without Randolph and Allen, and Conley out most of the season with an injured heel. After insisting they could be a playoff team this season, they matched the 22 wins from last season on Tuesday in a game Gasol left the arena early after being benched without explanation. Two days later, Memphis traded away its career leader in points, rebounds and blocks to at least get something in case Gasol opted out this summer. Valanciunas had been expected to return to the court Thursday after missing 25 games with an injured thumb. Now the center gets to try to replace Gasol. \u201cThere is no replacing what Marc has done here, and what he\u2019s meant to this team,\u201d Bickerstaff said. It\u2019s just the latest off-court drama for a franchise involved in a failed three-team trade in December over confusion about which Brooks (MarShon or Dillon) was included in the deal. MarShon Brooks finally was traded away Jan. 3 along with Wayne Selden Jr. to Chicago. Then the Grizzlies announced Jan. 6 that Chandler Parsons would continue rehab in Los Angeles after reports both sides had agreed to a split. Now Pera has to decide if he wants to rebuild around Conley and rookie Jaren Jackson Jr., or simply try to get a better offer this summer.

In addition to falling short in their ill-fated quest to acquire New Orleans Pelicans superstar Anthony Davis, they entered Thursday\u2019s action still licking their wounds from a 42-point stomping by the Pacers, the most lopsided defeat ever experienced by LeBron James and tied for the eighth-worst loss in franchise history. Only time will tell if Thursday\u2019s 129-128 victory over the Boston Celtics gets the Lakers back on track. But for one night, at least, all was well as Rajon Rondo, five teams and four-plus seasons after his final game with the Celtics, sank a buzzer-beating fling to torment the franchise that acquired him on draft day in 2006. GAME SITUATION: Rondo\u2019s bucket capped multiple comebacks by the Lakers, who persevered despite trailing by 18 midway through the second quarter and then by six with 1:24 remaining. The latter comeback set the stage for a wild finish, including Kyrie Irving\u2019s layup to give the Celtics their final lead, 128-127, with 11.5 seconds left. Brandon Ingram took the ensuing inbounds and drove the length of the court, electing to do things himself instead of deferring to James. His reverse layup was blocked, and the loose ball somehow skipped through the crowd to Rondo. DIFFICULTY: Never known for his shooting, Rondo came in hitting at 38.8 percent for his career between 16 feet and the 3-point arc. But his splay-legged 20-footer from the left wing was pure, giving the Lakers a much-needed victory as they look to right their floundering season. (Incidentally, Rondo hit almost exactly the same shot to cap a game of one-on-one with son at shootaround that morning.) CELEBRATION: Rondo\u2019s winner put Celtics fans in a weird spot. On one hand, it sealed a loss to the hated Lakers, led by one of the biggest villains in their history. (James finished with 28 points, 12 rebounds and 12 assists for his 77th career triple-double.) On the other hand, this was Rondo, the feisty point guard who helped them win their first championship in 22 years, became a fan favorite by never backing down from overpowering personalities like Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett and made four All-Star teams before his trade to the Dallas Mavericks in 2014. As such, there was a sense of grudging respect for the former Celtic even as James lifted him off his feet amidst a crowd of Lakers teammates. \u201cBelieve it or not, I always dream like this,\u201d Rondo said. \u201cBut I couldn\u2019t picture it being this sweet, coming back where it all started.\u201d GRADE: Other than the fact it was a relatively basic jumper, the first buzzer-beater of Rondo\u2019s 13-year, 800-game career was about as good as it gets for the regular season. Four out of five Horrys. James made a pregame appearance on Inside The NBA alongside fellow captain Giannis Antetokounmpo to pick his team for this year\u2019s All-Star Game. If he wasn\u2019t ready for jokes, well, he should have been as Antetokounmpo and the Inside gang were only too happy to poke fun at the Lakers\u2019 recent misadventures with the aforementioned Davis. First came Giannis after James took Davis. So now we know Giannis can do more than just dunk. But that was nothing compared to roastmaster general Charles Barkley, who knocked the softball straight out of the park when LeBron proposed a swap of Russell Westbrook for Ben Simmons. And lest he be ignored \u2014 yeah, right \u2014 Joel Embiid couldn\u2019t help but weigh in after learning that, thanks to the aforementioned trade, he\u2019ll be on the same team as long-time antagonist Westbrook. http:\/\/twitter.com\/JoelEmbiid\/status\/1093668085867921409 http:\/\/twitter.com\/JoelEmbiid\/status\/1093668085867921409 Not to be overshadowed by James Harden\u2019s ongoing 30-point run, Westbrook extended his own historic streak with his eighth straight triple-double (15 points, 13 rebounds, 15 assists) in Oklahoma City\u2019s 117-95 victory over the Memphis Grizzlies. Westbrook now stands just one behind the NBA record of nine consecutive triple-doubles, set by \u2014 who else? \u2014 Wilt Chamberlain in 1969. (Remarkably, Westbrook also has two other streaks of seven straight triple-doubles.) Even if he fails to match or break that mark, Westbrook is well on his way to averaging a triple-double for the third straight season at 21.2 points, 11.1 rebounds and 11.2 assists. Besides his triple-double, Westbrook also produced this fun series of events: First, a missed dunk. (Believe it or not, this happens fairly regularly for Russ; he blew 16 slams last season alone, which is probably unavoidable when you jam hard enough to end reality.) Then, the makeup. You did it, Russ! Just how short-handed were the Grizzlies following their deadline-day trade with the Toronto Raptors? The NBA\u2019s season-long battle with bats continued in Indiana, where another one of the winged nuisances made an appearance in the Pacers\u2019 116-92 victory over the LA Clippers. (According to an unofficial tally by SB Nation, that marks nine different appearances at three arenas this season, including San Antonio and Utah.) We know this much: Pacers center Myles Turner is no Manu Ginobili. Then again, Ginobili \u2014 or any other player not named Hakeem Olajuwon or David Robinson \u2014 never tallied six blocks and four steals in 27 minutes or less, as Turner did against the Clippers.

It\u2019s appropriate then to raise a glass in memory, or even more appropriate, throw an elbow. After Thursday\u2019s trade deadline , Marc Gasol is out the door and Mike Conley has one foot out and the other on a banana peel. All that\u2019s left to commemorate the prideful personality of a successful era is \u2026 well, nothing really. Truthfully, the Grizzlies are in tough shape, currently dealing with an identity crisis along with declining if not dwindling assets and the typical challenges faced by a small-market team. They hobbled into their game against the Oklahoma City Thunder with only a handful of available players following the trade deadline exodus , along with plenty of questions going forth. One of them is no longer about Gasol, the best player in club history, sent to the Toronto Raptors for a collection of players who may not stick around. Gasol is 34 and fading, still functioning yet no longer the elite defender and reliable scorer and certainly not fit to carry what\u2019s left of the Grizzlies anymore. Trading Gasol was a mercy move for the popular center, sending him to a conference title contender where he can be a solid complementary player and away from what promises to be a total rebuilding process once the Grizzlies send Conley packing. \u201cLove big fella,\u201d Conley said. \u201cI know he\u2019s going to do well in Toronto. You try to prepare yourself knowing it\u2019s possible Marc will not be with us. You\u2019re ready for it but when it happens it\u2019s completely different. You\u2019re bringing the guys into the huddle and there\u2019s no Marc. I\u2019ve got to be the voice for every huddle. It will take some time to adjust for all of us.\u201d For the first time since 2001, the Grizzlies don\u2019t have a Gasol, so this is the end of a peculiar era. They drafted his older brother, Pau , who was then traded five years later for Marc , who shed weight \u2014 he had become addicted to American fast food and bloated once arriving from Spain as a teenager. Marc put in quality time in Memphis as a three-time All-Star and was Kia Defensive Player of the Year in 2013. With Anthony Davis staying in New Orleans, Gasol was the biggest name to move on deadline day. \u201cThere are certain guys who are icons in their organizations that you don\u2019t replace, and there is no replacing Marc Gasol here, what he\u2019s meant to this team, this city and this fan base,\u201d said Grizzlies coach JB Bickerstaff. \u201cThere is no replacing what Marc has done here.\u201d At least Gasol\u2019s Memphis ejection was rather swift if not painless. Meanwhile, Conley said he hadn\u2019t slept in two days and didn\u2019t learn his fate until 15 minutes before the deadline. \u201cLong day,\u201d Conley said. \u201cA hard day. I was prepared either way. No matter where I was going to be, there was no hard feelings, just do my job and my best for this team. I didn\u2019t ask for any of this to begin with but I also understood our situation. They pay me to play and that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do.\u201d Conley was left as the endearing face of the franchise when the Grizzlies couldn\u2019t find enough compensation for him, though not for trying. He\u2019d been on trade alert for a couples weeks, then told he\u2019d have to stick around at least until summer when the market should be more robust for a point guard with All-Star skills \u2014 the fine print being the $68 million and two years remaining on his contract. Following an initial tease early this season, the Grizzlies cratered and gave themselves no choice but to accept the reality. They\u2019re 4-18 in their last 22 games and spiraling toward the Draft lottery, where they\u2019ll keep their first-round pick if it falls in the top-eight. Otherwise it goes to the Boston Celtics (from the dreaded Jeff Green trade). By keeping Conley, there is incentive for the Grizzlies to win enough to send that pick to the Celtics this summer, because next season it is only top-six protected and in is an unprotected pick in 2021. In addition, there could be sweeping changes in the front office if owner Robert Pera agrees with the public sentiment in Memphis and replaces general manager Chris Wallace. Ultimately, this might be the biggest decision of all facing the Grizzlies. On his watch, the Grizzlies: Gave four years and $94 million to gimpy Chandler Parsons, who has played only 73 games in two-plus years and is sitting at home; Got nothing for Tyreke Evans, traded for Green and then dumped Green, and tried to trade MarShon Brooks instead of Dillon Brooks. They failed to build around Gasol and Conley once the beloved grinders, Zach Randolph and Tony Allen, grew old. So this is where they are. Aside from Conley, the Grizzlies\u2019 only assets going into the Draft lottery in May will be rookie Jaren Jackson Jr. Sure, the Grizzlies can get the first pick and Zion Williamson and everything changes in a snap. Until then, and unless that happens, it\u2019s not a pretty picture. So it\u2019s a new journey with 19-year-old Jackson and whomever else the Grizzlies can get for Conley, a decision that will likely be made by a new GM, followed by what surely will be a difficult 2019-20 season. They\u2019re at least three seasons away from being what they once were, a routine 50-win team that won the hearts of a blue-collar town and made visiting teams cringe at FedEx Forum. This is, assuming, the Grizzlies ace their Drafts and trades between now and then. Conley is all in, at least for as long as he\u2019s in Memphis. In that sense, the Grizzlies are blessed; Conley is the consummate professional and always a positive influence. He explained: \u201cI never get down. This is just another challenge and I\u2019ll figure out a way through it. I always took that stance.\u201d Such a brave face staring at a potentially bleak road ahead. If the basketball Gods have a heart, they\u2019ll put Conley in a position as good as the one Marc Gasol finds himself in right now. He\u2019ll have mercy on a good player who deserves a better fate next season. The Grizzlies are ready to move forward, which is hard to do while backpedaling. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

During his freshman season at the University of Washington (2016-17), Fultz played in 25 games with the Huskies, averaging 23.2 ppg, 5.9 apg, 5.7 rpg and 1.6 stl in 35.7 min., while shooting .413 (52-126) from 3-point range. Fultz was the only player in the country to average at least 20 points, five rebounds and five assists. He set the Huskies freshman scoring record with 579 points. Fultz led all NCAA Division I freshmen and all Pac-12 players in scoring, while ranking sixth overall in the nation. He was named Third Team All-America by both the Associated Press and the NABC, and earned All-Pac 12 First Team honors. Oklahoma City\u2019s 2020 first-round pick is protected Nos. 1-20. If it does not convey in 2020, it becomes two Thunder second-round picks (2022 and 2023). The 2019 second-round pick will be the most favorable selection of Cleveland, Houston, Orlando and Portland. Simmons has appeared in 41 games (nine starts) with the Magic this season and is averaging 6.9 points, 2.4 rebounds and 2.4 assists in 20.6 minutes per contest.

The Golden State Warriors\u2019 Kevin Durant was selected by James with the first overall pick in the 2019 NBA All-Star Draft. Golden State\u2019s Stephen Curry was drafted by Antetokounmpo with the No. 2 overall pick. See below for the complete pick-by-pick results from the NBA All-Star Draft.  The 68th NBA All-Star Game will take place on Sunday, Feb. 17 at Spectrum Center in Charlotte, North Carolina, airing live on TNT and ESPN Radio in the United States at 8 p.m. ET. NBA All-Star 2019 will reach fans in 215 countries and territories in 49 languages on their televisions, computers, mobile phones and tablets. James and Antetokounmpo drafted the NBA All-Star Game team rosters from the pool of players voted as starters and reserves in each conference, making picks without regard to a player\u2019s conference affiliation or position. Special All-Star roster additions Dirk Nowitzki of the Dallas Mavericks and Dwyane Wade of the Miami Heat were also selected in the draft. During the draft, the eight remaining All-Star Game starters (aside from James and Antetokounmpo) were selected in the first round. The 14 reserves were chosen in the second round, followed by Nowitzki and Wade in the third round to complete each team\u2019s 13-player active roster. James, the top overall finisher in fan voting, was awarded the first pick in the first round and the third round. Antetokounmpo made the first pick of the second round. The captains alternated picks in each round until all players in that round had been selected. Conducting the NBA All-Star Draft on the same day as the NBA trade deadline, the captains did some dealing of their own. After the draft, Team Giannis acquired Russell Westbrook of the Oklahoma City Thunder from Team LeBron in exchange for Ben Simmons of the Philadelphia 76ers. For the second year in a row, both NBA All-Star Game teams will play for community-based organizations, with donations directed toward outreach efforts that benefit the All-Star host city. The winning team\u2019s charity will receive a $350,000 donation from the NBA and the National Basketball Players Association (NBPA), while the losing team\u2019s organization will receive $150,000.   Team LeBron has selected to play for Right Moves for Youth, a school-based, dropout-prevention and student-support program in Charlotte that provides resources and guidance to help teenagers improve their school attendance, behavior and grades. Team Giannis has chosen to play for Second Harvest Food Bank of Metrolina, which aims to eliminate hunger by soliciting and distributing food and household items to people in need. With Antetokounmpo representing the Eastern Conference in an Eastern Conference arena, his team has been designated the home team and was able to choose between wearing black or white uniforms. Team Giannis selected the white uniforms. Team LeBron was assigned the black uniforms as the visiting team. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver will select the replacement for any player unable to participate in the All-Star Game, choosing a player from the same conference as the player who is being replaced. Silver\u2019s selection would join the team that drafted the replaced player. If a replaced player is a starter, the head coach of that team would choose a new starter. Denver Nuggets head coach Michael Malone will lead Team LeBron, and Bucks head coach Mike Budenholzer will guide Team Giannis.

Some of those draft picks extend until 2024. And that means there are players perhaps in eighth or ninth grade, right now, who essentially have gotten traded in the last couple days \u2014 because the draft slots they\u2019ll fill five years from now have changed hands already. So nobody will know with absolute certainly what the full impact of Trade Deadline 2019 will have on the NBA, but in the short term, there\u2019s some clear teams that did really well and others who didn\u2019t come away happy from trade season. The breakdown: \u2014 Dallas Mavericks The way the Harrison Barnes trade went down was awkward and unforgettable \u2014 Dirk Nowitzki will be the answer to the trivia question \u2014 \u201cwho replaced Barnes when the Mavs had to take him out of a game because they agreed to trade him during play?\u201d \u2014 but Dallas transformed itself during trade season. They now have a ton of cap space for this summer, and the additions of Kristaps Porzingis and Tim Hardaway Jr. to play alongside Luka Doncic suggest that Dallas is ready for the long haul. \u2014 Los Angeles Clippers Their trade where they sent Tobias Harris to Philadelphia was truly smart for both sides. Getting a pair of future first-round picks is huge for the Clippers, who are well-positioned financially (and in terms of roster flexibility) to be in the mix for Kawhi Leonard this summer. The whole week was a series of good moves for the Clippers.  \u2014 New York Knicks Though it wasn\u2019t a true trade-deadline move, the trade last week that sent Kristaps Porzingis to Dallas means the Knicks will have room for two max free agents this summer. \u2014 Philadelphia 76ers The Harris trade from the Clippers says the 76ers are all-in, right now, on trying to win the Eastern Conference. Best starting five in the East, arguably. \u2014 Washington Wizards John Wall\u2019s Achilles tear changes everything for Washington, which managed to deal Markieff Morris and Otto Porter Jr. to escape the luxury tax. \u2014 Milwaukee Bucks Team with NBA\u2019s best record adds Nikola Mirotic, who gives Mike Budenholzer so many new options with the big-man lineup. The Bucks got better. \u2014 Toronto Raptors Marc Gasol will fit perfectly with this roster, and although the Raptors were fond of Jonas Valanciunias this one is unquestionably an upgrade. \u2014 Houston Rockets They got better with the Iman Shumpert addition, and escaped the luxury tax. \u2014 Erik Spoelstra The Miami Heat coach has had to juggle a massive logjam at guard all season, to the point where he said he was sickened by not being able to find minutes for Wayne Ellington. Trading Ellington and Tyler Johnson to Phoenix for Ryan Anderson gives Miami some big tax relief, but the more important part of the deal is that it gives Spoelstra some relief from the headaches he\u2019s had managing a rotation with too many wings. \u2014 Sacramento Kings Give the Kings credit. They\u2019re all-in on winning now. By getting Barnes from Dallas and adding him to their young core, the Kings are saying they have a plan not only for their playoff push this year but \u2013 since Barnes has a $25.1 million option for next season \u2013 they obviously have a plan for 2019-20 as well. There is a playoff spot to be had in the Western Conference, and the Kings haven\u2019t been to the postseason since 2006. That\u2019s the longest current streak of futility in the NBA, and it might be ending in a couple months. \u2014 Carmelo Anthony He\u2019s free to find a new home following his acquisition and subsequent waiving by Chicago, and now that the trade chips have settled Anthony will finally be able to decide where he fits best and target those teams as he offers himself up as a late-season rental. His closest friends in the league, players like Dwyane Wade and Chris Paul, insist that Anthony can still play. Soon we\u2019ll know which NBA team agrees. \u2014 Wayne Ellington Ellington was stuck in a rotation crunch with Miami, so getting traded to (and then waived by) Phoenix means he gets to choose his own future. Contenders will come calling for Ellington, the Heat recordholder for 3-pointers made in a season. \u2014 Boston Celtics Toronto, Philadelphia and Milwaukee all made significant moves. The Celtics stood pat. Clearly, the plan is to get Anthony Davis. \u2014 Golden State Warriors They were not expected to be a major player in the trade market. But now they can survey the landscape, look at who\u2019s out there on a loaded buyout market, and fine-tune their roster. Which, one would expect, they will. Nik Stauskas and Wade Baldwin IV started the week in Portland. Then they got traded to Cleveland. Then Houston. Then Indiana. And they\u2019ll be waived by the Pacers. By the weekend, they could each be on their fifth team in about seven days. They didn\u2019t win or lose. They probably just feel dizzy. \u2014 Los Angeles Lakers It\u2019s really by no fault of their own but the Lakers wound up being the unintended consequence of the Anthony Davis situation. Davis and his agent \u2014 Rich Paul, who also happens to be LeBron James\u2019 agent \u2014 asked for a trade, and all the attention immediately went on the Lakers when that happened. New Orleans didn\u2019t move Davis, half the Lakers\u2019 roster now knows they were on the trading block, and it\u2019s going to be very tough for the Lakers to right the ship now as they try to get a Western Conference playoff spot. \u2014 New Orleans Pelicans Speaking of Davis, the Pelicans lost this trade season because now they know that the miracle isn\u2019t happening. Davis is gone, either this summer in a trade, next season in a trade, or in the summer of 2020 as a free agent. How that will affect attendance, morale, winning, the job security of coach Alvin Gentry and general manager Dell Demps all remains to be seen. It\u2019s not going to be a lot of fun. \u2014 The Games Trade Season has seemed to overshadow everything on the court for the last few days. Golden State had a 15-minute stretch against San Antonio on Wednesday night where it shot 24 for 25 \u2013 96 percent! \u2013 from the field and scored 65 points in barely over a quarter. All that was overshadowed by Kevin Durant\u2019s postgame comments where he blasted reporters for what he considers to be unfair reports about his future. \u2014 Mike Conley He stayed in Memphis, and lost his wingman in Marc Gasol. Conley has faced one challenge after another in recent years, and this is going to be another one for one of the league\u2019s most-respected players."},{"id":46521,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/phoenix-suns-waive-wayne-ellington","date":"2019-02-07","title":"Suns waive Wayne Ellington","content":" The Phoenix Suns have officially released guard Wayne Ellington after they acquired him in a trade from the Miami Heat on Wednesday.

Both Davis\u2019 agent, Rich Paul, and the team itself have confirmed Davis will not be traded today. In not doing so, it pushes a potential Davis swap into the offeason at the earliest. The news isn\u2019t much of a surprise, as the tea leaves this morning surrounding a Davis trade seemed to indicate he would not be dealt . Marc Stein of The New York Times reported as much, while noting that the New York Knicks were seen to be on equal footing with the Lakers in the chase for keeping Davis long term. Now that Davis is with the Pelicans for the rest of 2018-19, he is expecting to be in the lineup and play out the rest of the season there, per ESPN\u2019s Dave McMenamin . Davis, who was available to play last night, did not do so in a 125-120 road win against the Chicago Bulls. Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry told reporters before the game that Davis will not play at least through the trade deadline . After the Pelicans\u2019 109-107 home loss to the Indiana Pacers on Feb. 4, coach Alvin Gentry said Davis has been \u201ccleared to practice\u201d as he recovers from a sprained left index finger that has sidelined him since the end of a loss at Portland on Jan. 18. ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski reported Thursday morning that the Lakers were \u201crunning low on hope\u201d for landing Davis, in particular that the Pelicans will engage the Lakers in time to get a deal done. Earlier this week, the Lakers reportedly pulled out of trade talks with New Orleans over the Pelicans\u2019 \u201coutrageous\u201d trade demands and because of their lack of initiative in the trade process.

Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry told reporters before the game that Davis will not play at least through the trade deadline . Davis had been sidelined with a sprained left index finger that he suffered Jan. 18 in Portland. On Tuesday, Wojnarowski reported the Lakers were pessimistic about a Davis trade getting done before the Feb. 7 trade deadline. The Lakers made a new offer for Davis yesterday with a trade that would have included multiple young players, future first-round picks and more. However, the Lakers have failed to get the Pelicans to budge much in dealing Davis. The Pelicans, as of Monday\u2019s reports, were seeking an offer that would overwhelm them with future Draft picks. The long and short of it all, it seems, is the clock is ticking and the Pelicans do not seem to be in a big hurry to deal Davis before the Feb. 7 trade deadline. For the Pelicans, the \u201coverwhelming\u201d card in the deal would look like this: four first-round and second-round picks as part of the trade package as New Orleans wants to be compensated for trading Davis to the Lakers now (instead of in the summer). Also on Monday,  an extended list of teams Davis would be willing to re-sign with emerged. That list reportedly consists of the Lakers, Knicks, Bucks and Clippers. Davis requested his trade through his agent, Rich Paul, on Jan. 28 . In theory, he could sign a 5-year, $240 million super max extension this summer with New Orleans. Or, he can become a free agent in the summer of 2020 when his current deal runs out. Davis is averaging 29.3 points, 13.3 rebounds, 4.4 assists, 1.7 steals and 2.6 blocks per game this season . A six-time All-Star, Davis was an All-NBA first team member in three of the last four seasons.

That deal has been made official as of Thursday afternoon . The Kings receive guard Alec Burks from the Cavs, while the Cavs acquire Houston\u2019s Brandon Knight and Marquese Chriss along with a 2019 first-round draft pick and a 2022 second-round pick from Houston. Cleveland is sending guards Nik Stauskas and Wade Baldwin IV as well as a 2021 second- round draft pick (via Milwaukee) to Houston. The Rockets will also send their own 2020 second-round pick to the Kings as part of the deal. Burks has now been traded for the second time this season, after starting the year with the Utah Jazz. Thursday afternoon, multiple outlets reported the Rockets will trade Stauskas and Baldwin IV to the Indiana Pacers for a second-round pick. The duo is expected to be waived, but will have been a part of four different teams (Trail Blazers, Cavs, Rockets, Pacers) since Feb. 4. ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski first reported the trade .

Wednesday night, as the Dallas Mavericks game against the Charlotte Hornets moved into the fourth quarter, The Athletic\u2019s Shams Charania broke news that the Kings were finalizing the acquisition of forward Harrison Barnes, and ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski quickly followed with details of the return package, which includes Justin Jackson and Zach Randolph. The team later announced the deal as official . Barnes, who started in Wednesday\u2019s 99-93 victory over the Charlotte Hornets, scored 10 points in 25 minutes before being pulled with 3:11 remaining in the third quarter for Dirk Nowitzki. Per ESPN\u2019s Tim MacMahon\u2019s, Barnes stayed out on the bench supporting his teammates the rest of the way. Nowitzki started realizing something was up when Barnes didn\u2019t replace him early in the fourth quarter as usual with the 40-year-old playing a limited role in his record 21st season with the same franchise. Since Nowitzki credited Barnes for being a positive influence in his two-plus seasons with the Mavericks, he wasn\u2019t surprised that Barnes stuck around after word of the trade got out. \u201cHe\u2019s a better man than me,\u201d said Nowitzki, who scored eight points. \u201cEverybody else would have bounced out. He\u2019s just a genuinely good dude and he\u2019s obviously got bonds with some of these players here for life. That\u2019s the kind of guy he is.\u201d ESPN\u2019s Paul Pierce reported on air postgame that Barnes\u2019 agent informed him being traded was a possibility, but Barnes requested to be in the gameday mix. Barnes and his agent, Jeff Schwartz, were apprised before last night\u2019s game that Barnes was being pursued by the Kings and Hornets, reports Marc Stein of The New York Times . The Kings\u2019 offer won out as Barnes opted to play against the Hornets. The Kings, just a game out of the eighth spot after a 12-season playoff drought, reportedly made the deal with long-term intent . Barnes currently holds a max-contract player option for 2019-20. The seventh-year forward, originally drafted No. 7 overall by Golden State before signing with the Mavericks in 2016, has averaged 18.8 points and 5.2 rebounds while shooting 44.5 percent (36.7 percent on 3-pointers) in 34.3 minutes over 204 games for Dallas. Barnes later posted an effusive thank you message on Twitter, writing that the team, executives, and fanbase all \u201cmade Dallas feel like home.\u201d The Mavericks, meanwhile, acquire Randolph\u2019s high-value expiring contract and Jackson, the No. 15 overall pick of the 2017 draft. The deal is expected to create enough cap space to allow for close to a max salary slot even after a recent trade that pairs Kristaps Porzingis with rookie sensation Luka Doncic. Per ESPN\u2019s Bobby Marks, they hold more than $13 million in room through June 30. Jackson has appeared in 52 games for the Kings this season, averaging 6.7 points while shooting 42.4 percent from the field and 34.6 percent from deep. Wojnarowski further reported that Randolph, who has yet to play this season, could become a free agent if he doesn\u2019t fit with the Mavericks plans.

Dallas brought back Tim Hardaway Jr., Courtney Lee and Trey Burke, but the core of the deal boils down to pairing Porzingis with Luka Doncic. Doncic has proven he\u2019s a franchise-changing player. Porzingis, for his part, proved to be as well, winning over New York fans before suffering a torn ACL in his knee exactly one year ago Wednesday. Now, the two of them will pair up in what could be a dynamic duo that shapes the NBA for years. \u201cOur goal is to keep these two together for the next 20 years,\u201d Cuban said when introducing Porzingis to the Dallas media this week. Doncic and Porzingis already seem to have a bond, and even with Porzingis taking his time to return, it should work out well for Doncic\u2019s future. The other rookie involved in a major trade was Philadelphia sharpshooter Landry Shamet , who has been no stranger to the Kia Rookie Ladder this season. Shamet has been in the Top 5 once and in the Top 10 in six of the 13 editions. Shamet, who had become a key contributor off the bench, was part of the Sixers\u2019 package to bring in Tobias Harris from the Clippers. Shamet had become a key contributor for the Sixers and seemed to becoming more and more valuable as a spread-the-floor shooter as the season progressed. Now, he\u2019ll move to the Clippers and play alongside another rookie, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and the Clippers, who are clearly looking toward the future. How he fits in with that roster and mindset will be interesting to watch. Will he continue to put up numbers like he has in Philly (8.3 ppg in 20.5 mpg) or will he see his role grow on a team that\u2019s taking a different approach? * * * Last week:  No. 1 Doncic played in just two games this week after missing last Thursday\u2019s loss to the Pistons with left ankle soreness. Still, Doncic was impressive in his two games to keep his top rung. In a had 35 points, 11 rebounds and six assists in the Mavericks\u2019 111-98 win against the Cavs. Then, Doncic tallied his third triple-double (first teenager ever with three in a season) with 19 points, 10 rebounds and 11 assists as Dallas beat Charlotte 99-93 Wednesday night . Doncic struggled from the field (5-for-20 FG, 2-for-10 3FG), but had several clutch plays to seal the win. Last week:  No. 2 Over three games this week, Young averaged 21.7 points, 4.7 rebounds and 9.0 assists as the Hawks went 2-1 with road wins in Phoenix and Washington. Young was especially clutch in Phoenix, scoring 16 of his 27 points in the fourth quarter to spark Atlanta to a 118-112 win . Young was also named Eastern Conference Player of the Month for January (he averaged 18.7 points and 7.2 assists) and was named a participant in the Taco Bell Skills Challenge during All-Star weekend in Charlotte. Last week:  No. 3 Another week, another run of double-doubles for Bagley, who is quickly gaining attention as a potential superstar. In three games, Bagley averaged 16 points, 11.7 rebounds, 1.7 blocks in 30.4 minutes per game. His most impressive performance came in a 127-112 win over the Spurs in which he scored a career-high 24 points, grabbed 12 rebounds and had one of the most memorable dunks of his young career. \u201dIt\u2019s been fun, man,\u201d he said. \u201dI\u2019m a totally different person from Game 1. I just feel different. I\u2019m seeing a lot of things differently out there. The game is slowing down.\u201d 4. Deandre Ayton, Phoenix Suns  Last week:  No. 4 Ayton returned to the Suns this week, but it\u2019s hard to bump him back up to his No. 2 rung as I\u2019d hinted to previously when I bumped him down the Ladder. Don\u2019t get me wrong, Ayton has been his usual self since returning from a sprained ankle, but the guys above him have been outstanding. In three games (all losses), Ayton averaged 16.0 points, 10.3 rebounds while shooting 48.9 percent from the floor. 5. Jaren Jackson Jr., Memphis Grizzlies  Last week:  No. 5 The Grizzlies appear headed toward trading Marc Gasol, which means more responsibility for \u201cTriple J.\u201d The Grizzlies have strung together two wins (the only two games for Jackson this week), and Jackson Jr. was huge in both victories. Sunday in New York, Jackson put up 16 and seven and followed that up Tuesday by going for 23 points, six rebounds, two blocks and a steal to help Memphis edge Minnesota 108-106. He finished 4-for-7 from 3-point land and his numbers should only increase if Gasol ends up elsewhere Thursday afternoon. Just missed the cut:  Kevin Huerter, Atlanta Hawks The Hawks\u2019 sharpshooter has strung together four double-digits games and proving he\u2019s a big piece to the Hawks\u2019 future. Over that stretch, \u201cRed Velvet\u201d has averaged 13.5 points, 4.5 rebounds, five assists and 1.3 steals while shooting 51.4 percent overall and 53.8 percent from 3-point range. Mikal Bridges, Phoenix Suns Bridges is establishing himself as the defensive leader of this rookie class. Over his last three games, he\u2019s had eight steals (2.7 per game) and continues to lead all rookies on the season (1.5 spg). He\u2019s also averaged 12 ppg while shooting 53.8 percent (46.7 percent on 3s). Kenrich Williams, New Orleans Pelicans With Anthony Davis still in limbo (at least until Thursday\u2019s trade deadline), Williams continues to produce while seeing big minutes. In his last three games, the TCU product averaged 10.7 points, 7.7 rebounds, 3.3 assists in 33.5 minutes per game. The 6-foot-7 swingman is proving he can shoot from deep, too, going 11-for-26 (42.3 percent) on 3-pointers. Kevin Knox, New York Knicks With the changes in New York, Knox has already seen a bump in playing time. In three games this week, Knox played 36.5 minutes, averaging 16.3 points and 4.7 rebounds. He struggled a bit from the field (35.3 percent, 31.8 on 3s), but he should have some big games down the stretch as he learns to play alongside Dennis Smith Jr. and DeAndre Jordan. * * * ( All stats through Wednesday, Feb. 6 ) Send any qfuestions or comments to my email or find me on Twitter @drewpackham .

In a related move, Dallas has also requested waivers on center Salah Mejri. Jackson (6-8, 210) holds career averages of 6.7 points, 2.8 rebounds, 1.2 assists and 21.6 minutes per game in 120 game (44 starts) with Sacramento. Last month, he scored a career-high 28 points and made five three-pointers against the Golden State Warriors on Jan. 5. The former North Carolina guard was the 15th overall pick in the 2017 NBA Draft after a three-year college career for the Tar Heels that culminated with a National Championship. As a junior, Jackson was named Atlantic Coast Conference Player of the Year, consensus First Team All American and First Team All ACC while averaging 18.3 points, 4.2 rebounds and 2.8 assists. The Houston native was a Parade All-American and a McDonald\u2019s All-American while playing in the Homeschool Christian Youth Association. Randolph (6-9, 250) holds career averages of 16.6 points, 9.1 rebounds, 1.8 assists and 31.0 minutes per game in 1,116 games (882 starts) with Portland, New York, Los Angeles Clippers, Memphis and Sacramento. He has yet to appear in a game this season, but averaged 14.5 points, 6.7 rebounds, 2.2 assists and 25.6 minutes in 59 games (58 starts) for the Kings in 2017-18. The 17-year veteran is a two-time All Star (2010, 2013) and earned All-NBA Third Team in 2010-11. He was named the NBA\u2019s Most Improved Player in 2003-04 and has averaged at least 20 points and 10 rebounds in five different seasons. The Marion, Ind., native was a standout at Michigan State and was selected with the 19th overall pick by the Portland Trail Blazers in the 2001 NBA Draft. Barnes (6-8, 225) was originally signed as a free agent on July 9, 2016. He averaged 18.7 points, 5.2 rebounds and 1.6 assists in 205 games (all starts) for the Mavericks. Mejri (7-2, 235) was originally signed as a free agent on July 30, 2015 and re-signed on August 3, 2018. He has played in 184 games for Dallas and averaged 3.2 points and 3.9 rebounds while shooting .632 from the field."},{"id":35751,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/about-last-night-2-6-19","date":"2019-02-07","title":"About Last Night: Trade Deadline Eve takes over","content":" The trade deadline waits for no one \u2014 not even the players who are still on the court. Just ask Harrison Barnes, who was dealt to the Kings while logging 26 minutes during the Mavs\u2019 99-93 home win over Charlotte. One minute, Kristaps Porzingis (last week\u2019s news) was waving hello to the Dallas community\u2026 The next, Barnes was saying goodbye\u2026 To his credit, Barnes stayed on the Mavs\u2019 bench to support his teammates even after news broke of the trade. LeBron James, however, pointed out that player movement can be unfairly skewed against athletes but in favor of teams. Sacramento is Barnes\u2019 new home now, and it will be interesting to see how the 6-foot-8 swingman meshes with his up-and-coming teammates. The Kings have only just struck on their best chemistry and on-court success in 15 years. That hasn\u2019t stopped them from shaking it up in an effort to accelerate their progress now. Dallas, meanwhile, might have lost a step in this year\u2019s playoff race, though that setback could be extremely temporary. The Mavericks, who are Luka Doncic\u2019s team now more than ever, are now well positioned to add more dynamic talent this summer. Throw in a potentially healthy Porzingis, and Dallas\u2019 2019-20 leap could be breathtaking. Barnes was one of many to reportedly address changes on Trade Deadline Eve. The most timely switch occurred in Sacramento, where Kings guard Iman Shumpert found out he was traded to the very same Houston team Sacramento was playing. Not a bad head start on meeting new teammates. Chicago and New Orleans also executed their own business even as their respective teams faced off in the Windy City. The Pelicans picked up a second-round pick for taking on remaining months of Markieff Morris\u2019 contract, while the Bulls shipped off Bobby Portis and former homecoming king Jabari Parker to Washington in exchange for Otto Porter . The move shocked Portis and Parker, each of whom spoke to reporters before the night was over. The Bulls\u2019 acquisition of Porter, meanwhile, should jog the memories of Shaqtin\u2019 fans around the world. Catch up on all our deadline updates with the NBA.com\u2019s trade buzz . Also, don\u2019t miss NBA TV\u2019s trade deadline day coverage running from 1-5 p.m. ET on Thursday. Kevin Durant went more than a week without speaking to the media, and yes, it was on purpose. The Warriors superstar was upset with the media for insinuating the Knicks\u2019 trade of Kristaps Porzingis was meant to pave the way for Durant and possibly other superstars to sign with New York in the coming offseason. \u201cI have nothing to do with the Knicks,\u201d Durant said emphatically. \u201cI don\u2019t know who traded Porzingis. That ain\u2019t got nothing to do with me. I\u2019m trying to play basketball. \u201cY\u2019all come in here every day asking about free agency,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou ask my teammates, my coaches, you rile up the fans about it. Let us play basketball. That\u2019s all I\u2019m saying. Now when I don\u2019t wanna talk to y\u2019all, it\u2019s a problem with me. Common, man. Grow up. Grow up.\u201d While the Wizards were wheeling and dealing off the court, the Bucks were blitzing them on it. Milwaukee scored a whopping 50 points in the first quarter (on 74.1 percent shooting!) en route to a franchise scoring record in their 148-129 win over Washington. Giannis Antetokounmpo was at his long-striding best, torching the Wizards for 43 points on 17-of-21 shooting. Here\u2019s a look at the All-Star captain\u2019s absurd shot chart:  The Bucks\u2019 killer quarter wound up just barely topping the Warriors\u2019 nightly post-halftime push. The two-time defending champs dropped 49 points in the third quarter of their 141-102 rout over the Spurs. DeMarcus Cousins, Klay Thompson and Stephen Curry scored 10 each in the period. Not that the Spurs were concerned, as Gregg Popovich chose to rest his stars and trot out a starting lineup of Rudy Gay, Davis Bertans, Jakob Poeltl, Patty Mills and Marco Belinelli. D\u2019Angelo Russell may be an injury replacement in the upcoming All-Star game, but he followed up the league\u2019s selection with a decisive performance against one of the West\u2019s best teams. The former second overall pick poured in 27 points, 11 assists and six rebounds while leading Brooklyn to a 135-130 win over the Nuggets The newly minted All-Star isn\u2019t a self-centered teammate, either. Just look at the part he played in the Nets\u2019 epic bench celebration following a successful Shabazz Napier Eurostep assist: Golden State did Black History Month right by hosting and honoring Olympic track and field star Tommie Smith, who became an athletic icon of civil rights in the late 1960s. https:\/\/twitter.com\/warriors\/status\/1093373087494500353"},{"id":35753,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/aschburner-davis-town-bulls-trade-porter","date":"2019-02-07","title":"Davis, Pelicans in Chicago ... but it's Bulls who make major trade","content":" CHICAGO \u2013 There was trade news at United Center Wednesday night, none of it made by the visiting New Orleans Pelicans and their currently-in-limbo all-NBA big man, Anthony Davis. Davis was healthy, back in his hometown, yet listed as inactive, a nod to the league\u2019s trade deadline at 3 p.m. ET Thursday \u2013 and the Pelicans\u2019 resolve to keep Davis out of harm\u2019s way, at least while overtures and discussions of his future whereabouts were active. Davis, averaging 29.3 points and 13.3 rebounds, has not played since January 18. He was cleared for Wednesday\u2019s game after missing the past eight, the fracture in his left index finger finally healed. But he sat and watched in street clothes from the Pelicans bench as they beat Chicago 125-122. It was left to the Bulls, instead, to swing a trade with the Washington, acquiring wing Otto Porter Jr. while sending big man Bobby Portis and forward Jabari Parker to the Wizards. The deal left some Bulls fans scratching their heads as to Porter\u2019s fit in the team\u2019s timeline \u2014 and salary structure. It had a few wondering, too, what might have been had the team gone shopping outside the P\u2019s, alphabetically speaking. > 2018-19 Trade Tracker: Keep up with every deal so far Porter is a sixth-year veteran who\u2019ll turn 26 in June and seemingly is out of sync \u2014 in pay, if not in age \u2014 with Chicago\u2019s sputtering rebuild. He is owed more than $53 million over the next two seasons on a four-year, $106.5 million deal signed in July 2017 that reportedly includes a 15 percent trade kicker. It is a contract that was considered exorbitant the moment he signed it and one that Porter hasn\u2019t exactly played up to, averaging 14 points, 6.1 rebounds and two assists in 30.7 minutes per game since then. The money, however, signals two concerns for Chicago heading toward the summer: Portis, in his fourth season, averaged 9.7 points and 5.8 rebounds for the Bulls mostly off the bench, numbers that looked better \u2014 18.1 ppg, 10.9 rpg per 36 minutes. Portis became a fan favorite at United Center for his energy and the little bit of crazy in his game. He\u2019s also the guy who slugged former teammate Nikola Mirotic in the 2017-18 preseason. When the Bulls felt compelled to trade one of the combatants, it was Portis they hung onto, shipping Mirotic to New Orleans. Parker\u2019s signing prior to this season was a failure, with the Bulls giving the No. 2 pick from 2014 and veteran of two left ACL surgeries a $20 million guarantee for this season (and mercifully for them, a team option on 2019-20). What they got was a scorer who openly disregarded his defensive responsibilities, a player who slipped quickly from starter to reserve to out of the rotation altogether under first coach Fred Hoiberg, then replacement Jim Boylen. The Wizards, facing a harsh new reality with the news that point guard John Wall will miss at least 12 months after Achilles tendon surgery, took their first steps toward their own reset. They can test-drive Portis and Parker without obligations beyond this season and are free from the money owed on Porter\u2019s deal. Neither Boylen nor Bulls\u2019 management spoke to reporters about the trade on Wednesday; the deal only become official after midnight . Another Chicago player who might be hoping for a trade or buyout, center Robin Lopez, still was in residence late Wednesday. He was asked where he might wait out the final minutes, heading toward 3 p.m. ET (2 p.m. CT) time. \u201cI\u2019m going to be asleep at 2 o\u2019clock. What time\u2019s the plane?\u201d Lopez wondered, craning his neck to glimpse the white board in Chicago\u2019s locker room. The team\u2019s flight to Brooklyn for its game Friday was scheduled, sure enough, for 2 p.m. CT. Right at the deadline. \u201cTwo o\u2019clock? Yeah, I pass out right away when I get on the plane,\u201d Lopez said, \u201cso I might be asleep. Hopefully they don\u2019t have to carry me off the plane.\u201d * * * Steve Aschburner has written about the NBA since 1980.

Porter\u2019s true shooting numbers over those two years were .628 and .602, respectively. The .628 mark in 2016-17 ranked seventh in the NBA.

However, sources told Wojnarowski that the Clippers\u2019 brass did not make this trade with the sole objective of pursuing Davis \u2014 either before Thursday\u2019s deadline or in the offseason. Torrel Harris, who is Tobias Harris\u2019 father and his agent, told The Athletic last night ( via Jovan Buha ): \u201cOur experience with the Clippers organization was great. The fans are amazing. We exceeded expectations and were in the playoff picture all season. Tobias is having an All-Star season and his experience in LA was great.\u201d Moments after the trade went through, Harris took to Twitter and posted a gif of Will Smith on a basketball court from the opening credits of \u201cThe Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.\u201d Harris certainly left a lasting farewell with the Clippers. He was the hero in last night\u2019s 117-115 comeback win against the Charlotte Hornets, as he both scored 34 points and nailed the game-winning floater with 4.3 seconds left . Harris, who\u2019s now been traded five times in his eight seasons (including a three-teamer on Draft night in 2011 ), is averaging a career-best 20.9 points per game while shooting 49.6 percent overall and 43.4 percent on 3-pointers, along with 7.9 rebounds and 2.7 assists in 34.6 minutes per game. He was widely considered one of the top players not to be named among those participating in the upcoming All-Star Game. Harris and Marjanovic came to the Clippers last year as part of the blockbuster trade that saw L.A. deal star forward Blake Griffin to the Pistons. Scott joined the Clippers in free agency last summer. \u201cI can\u2019t say enough good things about Tobias Harris and the many ways he has impacted our organization. Since Tobias came to L.A. a year ago, he has been a model of professionalism, on the court and off,\u201d Frank said Wednesday. \u201cHe developed into an All-Star caliber player here, setting a standard with his work ethic and diligence. We are incredibly grateful for his contributions. \u201cIn addition to Tobias, we will miss Boban, one of the most positive forces we have encountered in the NBA. Bobi lifted our locker room and was a game changer on the court. Like Boban, Mike Scott fit seamlessly into our team-first culture, and excelled in his role. We wish all three the best of luck in Philadelphia.\u201d Brand traded for Butler, a four-time All-Star, earlier this season, and showed again he\u2019s not afraid to make a bold move for the win-now franchise. \u201cI want to thank Wilson, Mike and Landry for their time as members of the 76ers organization,\u201d Brand said Wednesday. \u201cThey were great teammates and contributors, and consummate professionals. I wish them well in their respective careers.\u201d This could be the first of several major deals expected before the NBA trade deadline passes at 3 p.m. Eastern Thursday. The Sixers could certainly still be in the mix \u2014 possibly even making Butler available in the right deal. The Sixers are certainly listening to offers for any trade that involves 2017 No. 1 draft pick Markelle Fultz, who has been rehabbing a bad shoulder and missed most of the season. Coach Brett Brown refused to commit before Tuesday\u2019s loss to Toronto that Fultz would be part of the playoff rotation. \u201cI\u2019m hoping to be pleasantly surprised with how he arrives back with us more than assume that he\u2019s going to be there,\u201d Brown said. \u201cIt\u2019s not smart for me to think like (he\u2019ll be a part of the rotation).\u201d Per the Los Angeles Times \u2018 Andrew Greif, Harris declined a four-year, $80 million offer last summer . The Sixers now have Harris, Marjanovic and Scott as unrestricted free agents come this summer \u2014 joining a list that already includes (among others) Butler, backup point guard T.J. McConnell and veteran sharpshooter J.J. Redick.

Yahoo Sports\u2019 Chris Hayes reported Tuesday that the Pelicans prevented Davis from making his healthy return to the lineup last night. Gentry said Monday night he hoped that New Orleans\u2019 more prominent regulars will soon return to the lineup. For the fourth straight game, the Pelicans played without not only Davis, but also forwards Julius Randle (right ankle sprain) and Nikola Mirotic (right calf strain), as well as guards Elfrid Payton (right ankle sprain) and E\u2019Twaun Moore (bruised left quadriceps). The Pelicans are 23-31 and 13th in the Western Conference . Davis has said all along that he planned to play again for New Orleans once his finger injury healed up.

What say you?  * * * Steve Aschburner :  I\u2019m no fan, either . Now before we dive into this topic, let\u2019s note that James Harden is averaging eight assists per game and Kobe Bryant, in his illustrious career, never averaged more than 6.3 apg. Harden only once before this season averaged as many as 20 field-goal attempts per game, compared to Bryant\u2019s 13 such seasons. Just to keep the ball-hogging, er, ball- dominating in perspective. Given all that, though, Harden does in 15-20 dribbles what Bryant did in 3-4, and in this 3-point-centric era, he has teammates more obviously standing on the perimeter doing little. The energy he expends may catch up to him in May and the capability of a good team to lock in on him over four to seven games should worry Houston fans, too. Shaun Powell :  I second that emotion (although, imagine this coming from Kobe of all people). While I respect James Harden\u2019s ability to score, the iso-ball is a complete turnoff and hasn\u2019t gotten him or the Rockets anywhere. Now, to be fair, Kobe did say Harden had no choice, given the absence of Chris Paul for a stretch. He had to flip Houston\u2019s season in the right direction. But from here, if Harden is routinely going one-on-one, it\u2019ll be another May exit for Houston. John Schuhmann :  Harden wouldn\u2019t be playing like he is if the Rockets had a strong enough supporting cast to compete for a championship. The departure of Trevor Ariza, injuries, and the Rockets\u2019 defensive regression \u2014 they\u2019ve seen the league\u2019s biggest jump in points allowed per 100 possessions ( 6.6 ) from last season \u2014 have obviously forced him to carry more of an offensive burden. Harden is a brilliant pick-and-roll passer when defenses don\u2019t switch and when he has a full set of complementary players around him. Circumstances have forced him to play more like 2005-06 Kobe Bryant than like \u201905-06 Steve Nash.  Sekou Smith :  Kobe is speaking from experience in this matter and his words should be embraced by James Harden and the Rockets. With the way their season ended a year ago ( in Game 7 at home in the Western Conference finals without Chris Paul), the Rockets shouldn\u2019t need confirmation from Kobe Bryant for something they already knew. The one-man-band routine works beautifully in the pursuit of individual honors and for climbing the charts in the NBA record book. Winning championships, however, in this era, requires a group effort. The Warriors have proven it repeatedly, at the expense of challengers like Harden\u2019s Rockets. Having a roster as healthy as possible in May is the key for the Rockets."},{"id":35785,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-how-many-wins-lakers-make-playoffs","date":"2019-02-06","title":"Blogtable: Lakers need how many more wins to reach playoffs?","content":" * * * The Lakers will need to win ____ games to make the playoffs. Can they do it, with only 28 games left?  * * * Steve Aschburner :  No. Too many teams clawing for the last two spots in the West, with six teams \u2014 from Utah at No. 7 to Dallas at No. 12 \u2014 separated by six games in the standings, as of this morning. The Clippers appear to have tapped out with the Tobias Harris trade , but the others seem to feel a low seed and quick elimination at seventh or eighth remains a worthy goal (competiting for real, what a concept). Whether the Lakers add Anthony Davis or not, getting to 44 or 45 victories means going 17-11 or 18-10 . Factor in the convulsive strategic, rotation and manpower changes that would accompany a Davis acquisition or the emotional quagmire if they don\u2019t get him \u2013 six or seven players granted a reprieve from sudden banishment \u2013 and that\u2019s too much to overcome, IMO. Shaun Powell :  Probably 20, because 47-48 wins is likely the get-in price for the playoffs in the West. If LeBron James suffers any relapse or gets reinsured, that\u2019s a wrap for this crew, and coach Luke Walton\u2019s job as well \u2014 undeserved, in my opinion. But still. John Schuhmann :  The eighth-place Clippers certainly did their arena-mates a favor by trading one of the only healthy players on their roster who can consistently put the ball in the basket. So that eighth spot looks like it will come down to the 28-25 Sacramento Kings, who are carrying a 12-year playoff drought (tied for the third longest in NBA history), and the 27-27 Lakers, who are carrying a five-year drought (the longest in franchise history), which is kind of fun. The Kings have a two-game edge in the loss column, have the easier remaining schedule, and didn\u2019t lose by 42 points in Indiana on Tuesday. But the Lakers have a 2-1 edge head-to-head , with the final meeting in L.A. on March 24. Both teams have better records than their point differential would indicate ( they\u2019ve both been outscored this season ). They Kings have the point differential of a team that\u2019s 24-29, while the Lakers have the point differential of a team that\u2019s 25-29. Based on current record and point differential, the Kings are on pace for 41 wins and the Lakers are on pace for 40 , but time will tell if the Lakers remain as fractured they were on Tuesday. Obviously, what happens between now and 3 p.m. ET on Thursday could shake things up.  Sekou Smith :  The Lakers\u2019 math is brutal. They need to win 18 of their final 28 games just to stay in the mix and 20 to stay locked in until the final days of the regular season. And that\u2019s not factoring in what could transpire at Thursday\u2019s trade deadline and how that could impact things for whoever is left and\/or joins that locker room. Anything is possible with a healthy LeBron James. But it was much easier to buy into that theory when LeBron was in the Eastern Conference and the terrain wasn\u2019t nearly as rugged as it will surely be this season in the Western Conference. Depending on what goes down at the deadline, I\u2019m not 100 percent certain that the playoffs will be a realistic goal for this bunch. And yes, I am well aware of the expectations that were built before LeBron\u2019s 17-game injury absence (and no, I wasn\u2019t one of these people predicting they would challenge the Golden State Warriors in the conference finals). Get ready for a roller coaster finish to this regular season in LA."},{"id":35784,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/blogtable-under-radar-player-attainable-trade","date":"2019-02-06","title":"Blogtable: Who is a player attainable via trade that isn't getting much talk?","content":" * * * There\u2019s lots of trade buzz around NBA stars, but name a player who might be available \u2013 or at least attainable \u2013 in an under-the-radar deal that no one\u2019s talking about.  * * * Steve Aschburner :  When my head hit the pillow Tuesday night, Tobias Harris was a name I was thinking of here. So much for that \u2014 he\u2019s off to Philadelphia in a significant early deal . So now I\u2019m thinking about New Orleans\u2019 Nikola Mirotic and Utah\u2019s Derrick Favors . The former because of the tumult and uncertainty with the Pelicans, along with Mirotic\u2019s plug-in potential who could help almost any contender. The latter because of his reduced role with the Jazz, strong per-36 contributions and a contract that is deal-friendly Shaun Powell :  The Pistons may not find a better time to dump Blake Griffin and his mammoth contract then now. He\u2019s having a fine season, he\u2019s an All-Star and the Pistons are going nowhere special. Otherwise, as he declines, they\u2019ll be stuck with him or will need to package an asset to trade him. John Schuhmann :  I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s anything that no one is talking about. But, given the Sixers\u2019 lack of depth at the wings in the wake of their trade with the Clippers, they have to be shopping Markelle Fultz (and a Fultz-Lou Williams swap would have made that trade even more spicy). I imagine that Philadelphia\u2019s target list with Fultz\u2019 $8.3 million deal (with another two years before he becomes a restricted free agent) would look something like 1. Terrence Ross, 2. Alec Burks, 3. Garrett Temple, 4. Wayne Ellington, 5. Wesley Johnson. Nikola Mirotic also has to be on the move , given the Pelicans need to get something for him before his contract expires and every other team\u2019s need for more shooting.  Sekou Smith :  Nikola Vucevic shouldn\u2019t have his first All-Star Game ruined by trade chatter. So I hate to throw the Orlando Magic big man\u2019s name out there in this space \u2026 but I\u2019m doing it anyway. Time and again we of players who might be available at the deadline who can put a certain team \u201cover the top\u201d as it pursues a higher playoff seed or true contender status. Vucevic is the player capable of doing that for many teams. He\u2019s having a superb season on a team that clearly has other plans for his spot in the future (Mo Bamba). Park Vucevic in the front court rotation in Boston (where you\u2019ll need help to deal with Joel Embiid and perhaps DeMarcus Cousins down the road) and Celtics coach Brad Stevens might sleep better down the stretch of the season. And with all of the hype surrounding this trade deadline, you figure Celtics boss Danny Ainge will have an itch to scratch (not to mention Orlando being a potential home for Terry Rozier as a starter)."},{"id":35789,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/2019-celebrity-game-participants-official-release","date":"2019-02-06","title":"ESPN and NBA announce celebrity rosters and coaches for 2019 NBA All-Star Celebrity Game presented by Ruffles exclusively on ESPN","content":" ESPN and the NBA today announced the rosters and coaches for the 2019 NBA All-Star Celebrity Game presented by Ruffles , which will air exclusively on ESPN and the ESPN App, Friday, Feb. 15, at 7 p.m. ET from Bojangles\u2019 Coliseum in Charlotte, N.C.

The procedure, which has yet to be scheduled, will be performed by Dr. Robert Anderson in Green Bay, Wisc. Wall is expected to return to full basketball activity approximately 12 months after the surgery. Wall was already ruled out for the season in late December , when the team said he would have surgery to address bone spurs in his left heel. The team announced Tuesday that Wall developed an infection in the incision from initial surgery on Jan. 8 (a debridement and repair of a Haglund\u2019s deformity and a chronic Achilles tendon injury in his left heel that was also performed by Anderson). He suffered the rupture after slipping and falling in his home. The rupture was diagnosed by Wizards Director of Medical Services and Orthopedist Dr. Wiemi Douoguih during a procedure to clean out the infection. Wall was at the Wizards game last night, per Fred Katz of The Athletic. The five-time All-Star was wearing a boot on his left foot and using a scooter to get around. Wall has inflammation from the infection, which doctors must wait to subside before doing the surgery. Per Katz, the Wizards are hoping Wall can have the surgery some time next week. Anderson is considered an elite doctor when it comes to athletes dealing with foot and ankle problems \u2014 as evidenced by a client list that has included, among others, Cam Newton, Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant and Derek Jeter. Wall played in 32 of Washington\u2019s games this season, averaging 20.7 points and 8.7 assists even while dealing with the heel pain \u2014 which has been an issue for him many times over the past two to three years.

Gasol wasn\u2019t listed on Memphis\u2019 injured list earlier in the day, but coach J.B. Bickerstaff announced the veteran center would not play. While Bickerstaff would not elaborate on the reason for Gasol\u2019s absence, there were signs that Gasol\u2019s days in Memphis had come to an end. The No. 33 above Gasol\u2019s locker had been removed and some of Gasol\u2019s belongings were stuffed into a trash bag, according to David Cobb of the Memphis Commercial Appeal . The Grizzlies told Gasol and Mike Conley weeks ago that the organization would begin listening to offers for the two longest-tenured teammates in the NBA. Conley was drafted No. 4 overall in the 2007 draft, and Gasol joined the team after he was part of a trade that sent older brother Pau to the Lakers on Feb. 1, 2008. Gasol came out of the locker room midway through the first quarter and sat on the Memphis bench as fans responded with a standing ovation . Meanwhile, Conley was outstanding in what could be his last game with Memphis. The five-time All-Star scored 25 points and handed out nine assists in the Grizzlies\u2019 108-106 victory over the Timberwolves. As Conley left the floor, he looked around FedExForum before heading to the locker room and slapped hands with fans in the hallway. \u201cIt was a little surreal,\u201d Conley said, adding he wondered throughout if it possibly was his last game with his only NBA team. Hours after hitting a game-winning jumper, Tobias Harris was reportedly traded to the 76ers in a multiplayer deal. ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski reports Harris is headed to Philadelphia along with Boban Marjanovic and Mike Scott in exchange for Landry Shamet, Wilson Chandler, Mike Muscala and four draft picks. This marks the fifth time Harris has been traded in his NBA career, dating back to draft night when he was originally selected by Charlotte in 2011. Coincidentally, the Clippers traded Blake Griffin last season immediately after he hit a game-winner. Here\u2019s a look at Harris\u2019 parting shot \u2026 Tough night for the Lakers, especially for Brandon Ingram. With the trade deadline fast approaching, several members of the team have been mentioned as part of trade rumors for Pelicans star Anthony Davis. That didn\u2019t escape Pacers fans at Bankers Life Fieldhouse. With Ingram at the free-throw line, fans repeatedly chanted \u201cLeBron\u2019s gonna trade you.\u201d It didn\u2019t faze Ingram. He made the shots. \u201cThat\u2019s just fans being fans,\u201d LeBron James told reporters. \u201cIf you let that bother you, you\u2019re in the wrong sport.\u201d Adding insult to injury, the Pacers went on to thump the Lakers 136-94 , the worst loss by point differential James has ever experienced playing in the NBA. Russell Westbrook posted his seventh consecutive triple-double (16 points, 16 assists and 15 rebounds) as the Thunder beat the Magic 132-122 . It\u2019s the longest streak of triple-doubles since Westbrook accomplished the same feat last season \u2014 and the season before. Westbrook is averaging 20.0 points, 13.2 rebounds and 14.4 assists during the streak, and Oklahoma City is 6-1 during that span. The last player to record seven straight triple-doubles was Michael Jordan in 1989, and Jordan\u2019s streak came during a run of 10 triple-doubles in 11 games. The most consecutive triple-doubles is nine, by Philadelphia\u2019s Wilt Chamberlain, in March 1968. Get your popcorn ready. The participants for the Taco Bell Skills Challenge, Mtn Dew 3-Point Contest and AT&T Slam Dunk were announced Tuesday night.

In a surprising turn of events, though, they have reportedly pulled out of the trade talks for the star big man. Brad Turner of the Los Angeles Times reports the Lakers are not having any more conversations with the Lakers about Davis because of \u201coutrageous\u201d trade requests from the Pelicans. Lakers president Magic Johnson told Pelicans GM Dell Demps on Tuesday morning that Los Angeles had made its best offer but that the Lakers were not willing to add anything else and would be moving on. Here\u2019s more from Turner on the turn in the negotiations : The Lakers were willing to give the Pelicans salary-cap relief by taking back Solomon Hill (who has a year left on his deal after this season at $12.7 million). L.A. had also made several changes to their proposals to the Pelicans, talking out a package that included Rajon Rondo, Michael Beasley and Lance Stephenson, Turner reports. > More trade deadline buzz In addition, ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski reports the Lakers are willing to engage in trade talks with the Pelicans, but don\u2019t want to simply keep bidding against themselves. In short, the Lakers are looking for the Pelicans to show more initiative in the process. Early Tuesday, Wojnarowski reported the Lakers were pessimistic about a Davis trade getting done before the Feb. 7 trade deadline. The Lakers made a new offer for Davis yesterday with a trade that would have included multiple young players, future first-round picks and more. However, the Lakers have failed to get the Pelicans to budge much in dealing Davis. Last night, ESPN reported that the Pelicans were seeking an offer that would overwhelm them with future Draft picks. The long and short of it all, it seems, is the clock is ticking and the Pelicans do not seem to be in a big hurry to deal Davis before the Feb. 7 trade deadline. For the Pelicans, the \u201coverwhelming\u201d card in the deal would look like this: four first-round and second-round picks as part of the trade package as New Orleans wants to be compensated for trading Davis to the Lakers now (instead of in the summer). Lakers president Magic Johnson and Pelicans GM Dell Demps had multiple conversations Monday about trade packages, none of which obviously netted Davis. On Monday, per multiple reports, an extended list of teams Davis would be willing to re-sign with emerged. That list consists of the Lakers, New York Knicks, Milwaukee Bucks and LA Clippers. The Bucks and Clippers, per multiple reports, have yet to make an offer for Davis while the Knicks have not re-engaged the Pelicans in discussions. New York did try to land Davis with a deal centered on Kristaps Porzingis, but that was rejected by New Orleans, Wojnarowski reports. The Knicks dealt Porzingis to the Dallas Mavericks last Thursday. The Boston Celtics, per ESPN, are determined to land Davis after the season and GM Danny Ainge has directly urged Demps to wait until the offseason. The Celtics have a treasure trove of assets \u2014 young players, future Draft picks and more \u2014 that could entice New Orleans to make a deal and Ainge is eager to land Davis to pair him with All-Star guard Kyrie Irving, ESPN reports. The Lakers have some factors working against them, per Wojnarowski, as the Celtics wait in the wings. Of particular concern for L.A.\u2019s bid for Davis is whether or not Boston might include young talent Jayson Tatum in an offseason deal that would include first-round picks. When Davis\u2019 list of teams came out yesterday, the Celtics were not among them and Davis\u2019 father has been vocal about not wanting his son to play in Boston. After the Pelicans\u2019 109-107 home loss to the Indiana Pacers, coach Alvin Gentry said Davis has been \u201ccleared to practice\u201d as he recovers from a sprained left index finger that has sidelined him since the end of a loss at Portland on Jan. 18. Yahoo Sports\u2019 Chris Hayes reported Tuesday that the Pelicans prevented Davis from making his healthy return to the lineup last night. The Pelicans are 23-31 and 13th in the Western Conference . Davis has said all along that he planned to play again for New Orleans once his finger injury healed up. New Orleans visits the Chicago Bulls on Wednesday ( 8 ET, NBA League Pass ) in its last game before the trade deadline. If Davis winds up not being dealt by the deadline, he would be allowed to join his teammates on the court. However, Haynes reports there is a strong possibility Davis could be \u201cshut down to an extent\u201d for the rest of 2018-19 after the All-Star break.

He had 30 points and 11 assists in Boston\u2019s win over Oklahoma City on Sunday. When they face the struggling Cavs, the Celtics also will be without forward Marcus Morris, who has a sore right knee and center Aron Baynes, who has a bruised right foot. Coach Brad Stevens doesn\u2019t expect Baynes to return until after the All-Star break. Baynes is averaging 5.7 points and 4.3 rebounds. Irving\u2019s absence against his former team comes on the heels of speculation about his future. Last week, he bristled at questions about his plans for this summer when he can become a free agent.

James last played on Thursday in a 123-120 overtime win against the LA Clippers. That game was his first after missing 17 straight contests with a strained left groin suffered on Christmas night. At shootaround on Tuesday, James confirmed he would play vs. the Pacers and would not be under a minutes restriction, although coach Luke Walton said there is an ideal number they\u2019d like to keep James under minutes-wise.

Additionally, center Ivica Zubac had an MRI that revealed a small avulsion fracture on his left middle finger. He is not expected to miss any games because of the injury. James is averaging 27.2 points, 8.5 rebounds and 7.2 assists. Walton said there may be other times James could need days off for his body to recover. \u2018It\u2019s a possibility but a lot of it will be dependent on how he\u2019s feeling and what the schedule is like at those times,\u201d Walton said Saturday. \u201dRight now, it\u2019s more just him being sore after five weeks of not playing basketball.\u201d Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":35793,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/kristaps-porzingis-gets-shots-mavs-practice","date":"2019-02-05","title":"New addition Porzingis practices with Mavericks","content":" The Dallas Mavericks likely won\u2019t see Kristaps Porzingis on the court for a game this season. However, he was a part of practice on Monday, just days after the team acquired him from the New York Knicks in a blockbuster trade . Porzingis was traded to the Mavs on Thursday, but per reports is not expected to suit up as he recovers from the ACL injury he suffered more than a year ago. On Monday, videos circulated of Porzingis getting up some free throws at practice (as part of a grouping with Dirk Nowitzki and Harrison Barnes). Guards Tim Hardaway Jr. and Trey Burke, who were also acquired in the Porzingis trade, took part in Monday\u2019s practice as well. As Eddie Sefko of Mavs.com pointed out, the Mavs are more than likely to ensure Porzingis\u2019 ACL is 100 percent recovered before they pair him with Dallas\u2019 other young phenom \u2014 rookie guard Luka Doncic. Porzingis has been sidelined for nearly a year after tearing his left ACL. The Knicks said recently he would undergo testing during the middle of February that could have determined if he would be able to return this season. The former No. 4 overall pick of the 2015 Draft, Porzings was named an All-Star in 2017-18, but his ACL injury occurred days after that and he never got to play in that game. In 2017-18, prior to the injury, Porzingis averaged 22.7 points, 6.6 rebounds and 2.4 blocks while shooting 43.9 percent from the field and 39.5 percent on 4.8 3-point attempts. In December, Knicks team president Steve Mills said the team was pleased with Porzingis\u2019 recovery from his ACL, and another round of testing scheduled for mid-February could clarify his timeline for his return.

For the fourth straight game, the Pelicans played without not only Davis, but also forwards Julius Randle (right ankle sprain) and Nikola Mirotic (right calf strain), as well as guards Elfrid Payton (right ankle sprain) and E\u2019Twaun Moore (bruised left quadriceps). The Pelicans are 23-31 and 13th in the Western Conference . Davis has said all along that he planned to play again for New Orleans once his finger injury healed up. New Orleans visits the Chicago Bulls on Wednesday ( 8 ET, NBA League Pass ) in its last game before the trade deadline. If Davis winds up not being dealt by the deadline, he would be allowed to join his teammates on the court. However, Haynes reports there is a strong possibility Davis could be \u201cshut down to an extent\u201d for the rest of 2018-19 after the All-Star break. Information from The Associated Press was used in this report."},{"id":35787,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/about-last-night-02-04-2019","date":"2019-02-05","title":"About Last Night: Giannis has last laugh","content":" Monday\u2019s game between the Milwaukee Bucks and Brooklyn Nets was only minutes old when Giannis Antetokounmpo, left wide open at the top of the arc, lined up a 3-point shot and let it fly. For all his brilliance, long-range shooting is one of the few skills he has yet to master, and the result wasn\u2019t surprising: Air ball, much to the delight of Brooklyn\u2019s bench. There\u2019s a great chance Antetokounmpo would have dominated the Nets regardless. He is, after all, perhaps the only player who can prevent Houston\u2019s James Harden from winning a second straight Kia MVP award. But neither did it seem particularly intelligent to poke the proverbial bear after Antetokounmpo missed a triple-double by one assist (30 points, 15 rebounds, nine assists) and the Bucks led by as many as 25 en route to a 113-94 rout . He added three blocks in a performance that impressed pretty much everyone in attendance \u2014 including a former POTUS and, presumably, those Nets at the end of the bench. The only inevitabilities in life are said to be death and taxes. In the NBA, they\u2019ve come to be Golden State winning championships and Harden hanging at least 30 points. The Rockets superstar did it once again, pushing his 30-point streak to 27 games with 44 in a 118-110 victory over the Phoenix Suns. With Wilt Chamberlain\u2019s record of 65 straight 30-point games safely out of reach (we think), Harden is only four games away from matching the second-best stretch of 31, also held by Chamberlain. It also marked Harden\u2019s 20th 40-point game of the season, more than any NBA player since Kobe Bryant had 27 for the Los Angeles Lakers in 2005-06. (According to the Houston Chronicle , Harden also joined Chamberlain, Michael Jordan and Rick Barry as the only players with 20 40-point games in their first 50 outings.) And, as is sometimes lost in the shuffle, Harden can do much more than just score. Witness his full-court dime to Kenneth Faried, who continued his resurgence in Houston with 17 points and 14 rebounds: Again from the Chronicle, Harden\u2019s 18th game with at least 40 points and five assists tied the record set by Tiny Archibald, which he will presumably shatter. Speaking of Bryant, he made semi-waves Monday afternoon with his assertion that Harden\u2019s extreme ball dominance isn\u2019t conducive to winning championships. Bryant should know; despite winning five titles on his watch, the Lakers were also eliminated in the first round and missed the playoffs entirely during his two highest-scoring campaigns. Harden actually agreed with Bryant \u2014 but with a caveat, noting that the Rockets need everything he can give them as they work back to full strength. Until then, Harden told the Chronicle , \u201cNothing can stop me.\u201d Speaking of sweet dimes, check out the angle on this beauty from Atlanta Hawks point guard Jeremy Lin: On the other end of the passing spectrum, you have this semi-errant pass from Sacramento Kings guard Yogi Ferrell. Fortunately for him, rookie forward Marvin Bagley III is a ninja: Continuing the best stretch of his young career, Bagley finished with a career-high 24 points and 12 rebounds, helping the Kings move into ninth place in the Western Conference with a 127-112 rout of the San Antonio Spurs. As for the Spurs, it was a lackluster start to their annual Rodeo Road Trip, which clocks in this season at eight games bracketing the All-Star break from Feb. 13-21. Be aware of your surroundings at all times, especially whenever Hawks center Dewayne Dedmon has the ball:"},{"id":35786,"link":"https:\/\/www.nba.com\/news\/nets-caris-levert-practice-gleague-team","date":"2019-02-05","title":"Brooklyn Nets' Caris LeVert to practice with G League team as he works to return","content":"NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Caris LeVert will practice with the Brooklyn Nets\u2019 NBA G League affiliate on Tuesday as he works to return from a dislocated right foot. Coach Kenny Atkinson says Monday that he doesn\u2019t know how soon LeVert will be ready for game action, though he says the guard is \u201cprogressing great.\u201d Fellow injured guard Allen Crabbe (right knee) also will practice with the Long Island Nets. Brooklyn is too banged up for full practices, so having the players work out with the G League team gives them a chance to take part in full scrimmages. LeVert was leading the Nets with 18.4 points per game when he was injured Nov. 12 at Minnesota. The injury appeared to be much more severe, and he was taken off the court in a stretcher.

The morale for a team that went 35-47 last season and missed the playoffs is indeed different. It\u2019s more somber. After speaking with a number of players, their agents and other sources, the general consensus paint a picture of little joy, plenty of confusion and uncertainty, along with some anger and sense of betrayal. It\u2019s all caused by the Lakers\u2019 obvious and public pursuit of Anthony Davis and the players who unquestionably will be shipped out to New Orleans in exchange for the All-NBA forward if a trade happens before Thursday\u2019s deadline. None will speak on the record, but it\u2019s obvious the Davis issue is sensitive and weighing on most of the roster \u2014 especially the young core of Brandon Ingram, Josh Hart, Kyle Kuzma and Lonzo Ball. They wonder if their days in L.A. are numbered and also wonder what, if any, role LeBron has in determining who goes and who stays. Various reports have the Lakers offering up virtually everyone on the roster for Davis, along with multiple future Draft picks. Clearly, the pace has changed for the Lakers. After saying last summer the Lakers are intent on building a team that will be a contender for years and not just in the short term, team president Magic Johnson\u2019s timeline has accelerated if the proposed packages for Davis are true. And how can they not be? New Orleans wants a combination of young players and picks for a game-changing player such as Davis. The Lakers own no other assets. In the meantime, the Lakers, currently on a road trip, are dealing with turbulence and not necessarily while thousands of feet in the air. Michael Beasley and JaVale McGee had a verbal post-game exchange with coach Luke Walton two nights ago in Oakland after a loss to the Golden State Warriors. Although it wasn\u2019t sparked by the Davis issue directly, the trade rumors are causing stress and perhaps pushing tempers as well. In the center of it all is LeBron. Davis has been represented since last fall by Klutch Sports, the agency created by LeBron and run by his business partner and close friend, Rich Paul. The LeBron link to a player agency has caused a degree of concern among other NBA general managers, who wonder if there\u2019s a conflict of interest and if it\u2019s a good look for the league. It also has rival agents suspecting that LeBron is involved in talks for Davis and, at the very least, serving as a sounding board for Magic and Lakers GM Rob Pelinka. It wouldn\u2019t be unreasonable for the Lakers to get LeBron\u2019s hot take on this or any major decision involving personnel. That\u2019s a perk enjoyed by a number of star players throughout the NBA, and has been for years. Following the Lakers\u2019 victory against the LA Clippers last week \u2014 when LeBron made his return after missing 17 games with a groin injury \u2014 he repeatedly expressed how thrilled he was to be back on the floor with \u201cmy guys\u201d. That didn\u2019t sit well with some of his teammates, according to their agents. Essentially, they\u2019re not sure where they stand with LeBron in the Davis situation. And the young players appear too intimidated to confront LeBron and get clarity. There\u2019s another issue at play here: Are the Lakers planning to surrender too much for Davis by gutting the team? If the Lakers are willing to part with their young core and at least two veterans to make the salaries match, who\u2019s left to make them competitive with Davis and LeBron? The Pelicans, according to league sources, are insisting that any team wanting Davis must also take guard E\u2019Twaun Moore and his contract in return. This will allow the Pelicans to get young players, multiple picks and salary cap flexibility in a single transaction. In a sense, Davis is indeed a franchise player \u2014 trading him might allow the Pelicans to remake their entire franchise. Davis reportedly gave the Pelicans other teams on a wish list, yet those teams\u2019 options appear limited. One is the Milwaukee Bucks \u2014 they lack promising young players, and as the East\u2019s top team, lack an attractive first-round pick in the 2019 draft. Another is the New York Knicks \u2014 they won\u2019t have defined assets until after the Draft lottery in May when their place in the 2019 draft will be known. If the Pelicans decide to wait until summer, that means they believe there\u2019s a better deal waiting after the Draft and free agency. That places urgency on the Lakers to get something done before Thursday. One way or another, whether he comes to the Lakers or stays in New Orleans for a few more months, Davis will bring some relief and help clear the air to a Lakers team that desperately needs it. * * * Shaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.

The Heat made the announcement Monday. Bosh played parts of six seasons in Miami, before his career was cut short by recurring issues with blood clots. He last played for the Heat in 2016. Bosh helped Miami reach the NBA Finals four times and win championships in 2012 and 2013. He grabbed a rebound and tossed the ball out to Ray Allen for a game-tying 3-pointer with 5.2 seconds left in regulation of Game 6 of the 2013 NBA Finals against San Antonio, a game that the Heat would win in overtime to force Game 7. Alonzo Mourning, Tim Hardaway and Shaquille O\u2019Neal are the other Heat players to have jerseys retired. Dwyane Wade, Udonis Haslem and LeBron James will likely receive the same tribute in the coming years."}]
